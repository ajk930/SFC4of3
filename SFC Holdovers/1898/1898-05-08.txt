WASHINGTON, May 7.â Commodore Dewey's official report to Secretary Long consisted of
two dispatchesâ one from Manila and the other from Caviteâ as follows:
''MANILA, May I.â The squadron arrived at Manila at daybreak this morning. Immediately
engaged the enemy and destroyed the foUowing Spanish vessels: Reina Cristina, Castilla,
Ulloa, Isle de Cuba, General Lozo, the Duero, Correo, Velasco, Mindanao, one transport and
the water battery at Cavite. The squadron Is uninjured, and only a few men were slightly
wounded. The only means of telegraphing is to the American Consul at Hongkong. I shall com
municate with him. DEWEY."
"CAVITE. May 4.â 1 have taken possession of the naval station at Cavite, on the Philippine
Islands. Have destroyed the fortifications at the bay entrance. Paroled the garrisons. I con
trol the bay completely and can take the city at any time. The squadron is in excellent health
and spirits. The Spanish loss is not fully known, but is very heavy. At least 150 were killed.
Including the captain of the Reina Cristina. J am assisting in protecting the Spanish sick and
wounded. Two hundred and fifty-six wounded are in hospitals within our lines. There is much
excitement at Manila. I will protect the foreign residents. DEWEY."

THE OFFICIAL REPORT.
the squadron steamed into
Boca Grande, with the crews
at the guns. . This was the
order of the squadron, which
was kept during the whole
time of the first battle :
The flagship Olympia.
The Baltimore.
The Raleigh.
The Petrel.
The Concord*
The Boston.
It was just 8 o'clock, a
bright moonlight night, but the
flagship passed Corregidcr
Island without a sign being
given that the Spaniards
were aware of its approach.
Not until the flagship was a
mile beyond Corregidor was
a gun fired. Then one heavy
shot went screaming over the
Raleigh and Olympia, fol
lowed by a second, which
fell farther astern.
The Raleigh, Concord
and Boston replied, the
Concord's shells ex
ploding, apparently, ex
actly inside the shore
battery, which fired no
more.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
Our squadron slowed down
to barely steerage way and
the men were allowed to
sleep alongside their guns.
Commodore Dewey had
timed our arrival so that we
were within five miles of the
city of Manila at daybreak.
We then sighted the Spanish
squadron, Rear- Admiral Mon
tejo commanding, off Cavite
(pronounced Kaveetay, with
accent on "vee"). Here the
Spaniards had a well prepared
navy-yard, called Cavite ar
senal.
Admiral Montejo's flag was
flying on the 3500-ton pro
tected cruiser Reina Cris
tina. The protected cruiser
Castilla, of 3200 tons, was
mocred ahead, and astern to
the port and to seaward were
the cruisers Don Juan de
Austria, Don Antonio de Ulloa,
Isla de Cuba, Isla de Luzon,
Ouiros, Marquis del Onero2
and General Lezox.
These ships and the flag
ship remained under way
during most of the action.
With the United States flag
flying at all their mastheads,
our ships moved to attack in
line ahead, with a speed of
eight knots, first passing in
front of Maniia, where the
action was begun by three
batteries mounting guns pow
erful enough to send shells
over us at a distance of five
miles.
The Concord's guns bcomed
out a reply to these batteries
with two shots. No more
were fired, because Commo
dore Dewey could not en
gage with these batteries
without sending death and
destruction into the crowded
city.
As we neared Cavite
two very powerful sub
marine mines were ex
ploded ahead of the
flagship. This was at
six minutes past 5
o'clock. The Spaniards
had evidently misjudged
our position. Immense
volumes of water were
thrown high in the air
by these destroyers, but
no harm was done to
our ships.
Commodore Dewey
had fought with Farra
gut at New Orleans and
Mobile Bay, where he
had his first experience
with torpedoes. No t
knowing how many
more mines there might
be ahead, he still kept
on without faltering.
No other mines were
exploded, and it is be
lieved that the Span-!
iards had only these
two in place.
Only a few minutes later a
shore battery at Cavite Point
sent over the flagship a shot !
that nearly hit a battery in !
Manila, but soon the guns got i
better range and shells began |
'o strike near us or to burst j
close aboard, from both the;
.'hore batteries and the Span
ish vessels.

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAT 8, 1898.
DEWEY'S STANCH DISPATCH BOAT
The dispatch-boat McCulloch of Admiral Dewey's squadron, now famous in having carried the official news
of the capture of the Spanish fleet and the fall of Manila to Hongkong, thus relieving the suspense of the of
ficials at Washington, is a vessel of the gunboat type, and one of the mfcny able vessels in the fleet of Uncle
Sam's revenue cutters. Throughout the voyage, a distance of a trifle over six hundred miles, she kept up the
average speed of sixteen knots, steaming into the teeth of, a violent moi.soon for nearly one-half the voyage.
The McCulloch was built at Cramps, shipyard and launched in August last, and was on her maiden voyage
to this port when assigned upon her arrival at Hongkong to Commodore Dewey's fleet for service. She was
intended for service on the Pacific Coast, and eventually to relieve the revenue cutter Bear in the Arctic.
The dispatch-boat is 1280 tons burden and 219 feet long. Her armament consists of four 6-pounder Hotch
kiss guns; and she has a crew of sixty-two n^n. Her officers are all from the revenue cutter service and are:
Captain D. B. Hodgsdon, commanding; First Lieutenant D. P. Foley, executive officer; Second Lieutenant W.
W. Jaynes, navigator; Third Lieutenant R. Ridgeley, Third Lieutenant TV. E. Arlee, Third . Lieutenant John
Mcl; (dead), Chief Engineer F. Randall; Assistant Engineers Maccoun, William Meyers and H. Shoenborn.
quate reply to the murder of
the Maine's crew every man
shouted what v/as in his
heart.
The Olympia was now
ready to begin the fight.
Commodore Dewey, his chief
of staff Commander Lam
berton, an aid and myself,
with Executive Officer Lieu
tenant Reese and Navigator
Lieutenant Calkins, who
conned the ship most admir
ably, were on the forward
bridge. Captain Gridley was
in the conning tower, as it
was thought unsafe to risk
losing all the senior officers
by one shell.
"You may fire when ready,
Gridley," said the commo
dore, and at 41 minutes past
5 o'clock, at a distance of $000
yards, the starboard 8-inch
gun in the forward turret
roared forth its compliment
to the Spanish fortifications.
Presently similar guns from
the Baltimore and the Boston
sent 2^o-pound shells hurtling
toward the Castilla and the
Reina Cristina the accuracy
cf the aim being marvelous.
The Spaniards seemed en
couraged by this fire to fight
faster, knowing exactly our
distance, while we had to
guess theirs. Their ship and
shore guns were making
things hot for us. The pierc
ing scream of shot was varied
often by the bursting of time
fuse shells, fragments of
which would lash the water
like shrapnel, or cut our hull
and rigging. "
One large shell that was
coming straight at the Olym
pia's forward bridge fortu
nately fell within less than
ioo feet away. One fragment
cut the rigging exactly over
the heads of Lamberton,
Reese and myself.
Another struck the bridge
gratings in line with \K A
third passed just under Com
modore Dewey and gouged a
hole in the deck. Incidents
like these were plentiful.
Our men naturally chafed at
being exposed without return
ing the fire from all our guns,
but laughed at the danger and
chatted good humoredly.
A few nervous fellows could
not help dodging, mechanic
ally, when shells would burst
right over them, or close
aboard, or would strike water
and pass overhead, with the
peculiar spluttering roar made
by a tumbling rifled projectile.
Stil! the flagship steered for
the center of the Spanish line,
and as our other ships were
astern, the Olympia received
most of the Spaniard's atten
tion. Owing to our deep
draught Commodore Dewey
felt constrained to change his
course at a distance of 4000
yards and run parallel to the
Spanish column.
"Open with all the
guns," he said, and the
ship brought her port
broadside bearing. The
roar of all the flagship's
five-inch rapid - firers
was followed by the
deep diapason of her
turret eight-inchers.
Soon our other vessels were
equally hard at work, and we
could see that our shells were
making Cavite harbor hotter
for the Spaniards than they
had made the approach for
us.
Protected by their shore
batter es, and made safe from
close attack by shallow water,
the Spaniards were in a strong
position. They put up a gal
lant fight. The Spanish ships
were sailing back and forth
behind Castilla and their fire
was hot. One shot struck
the Baltimore and passed
clean through her, fortunately
hitting no one.
Another ripped up her main deck,
disabled the six-inch gun and ex
ploded a box of three-pounder ammu
nition, wounding eight men.
The Olympia was struck abreast the
gun in the wardroom by a shell which
burst outside, doing little damage.
The signal halyards were cut from
Lieutenant Brumby's hand on the af
ter-bridge.
A shell entered the Boston's port
quarter and burst in Ensign Dodridge's
stateroom, starting a hot fire, and fire
was also caused by a shell which burst
In the port hammock netting. Both
these fires were quickly put out.
Another shell passed through the
Boston's foremast just in front of Cap
tain Wildes, on the bridge.
After having made four runs along
the Spanish line, and finding the cart
incorrect. Lieutenant Calkins, the
Olympia's navigator, told the commo
dore he believed he could take the
ship nearer the enemy with the lead
going to watch the depth of the water.
The flagship then started over the
course for the fifth time, running with
in 2000 yards of the Spanish vessels. At
this range even the six-pounders were
effective, and the storm of shells poured
upon the unfortunate Spanish began to
show marked results. Three of the
enemy's vessels were seen burning and
their fire slackened.
On finishing this run Commodore
Dewey decided to give the men break
fast, as they had been at the guns
two hours -with only one cup of coffee
to sustain them.
The action ceased temporarily at
7:35 o'clock, the other ships passing the
flagship and cheering lustily.
Our ships remained beyond range of
the enemy's guns until 10:50 o'clock,
when the signal for close action again
went up.
The Baltimore had the place of honor
in the lead, with the flagship following
and the other ships as before. The
Baltimore began firing at the Spanish
ships and batteries at 11:16 o'clock,
making a series of hits as if at target
practice.
The Spaniards replied very slowly,
and the commodore signaled the Ra
leigh, Boston, Concord and Petrel to
go into the inner harbor and destroy
all the enemy's ships.
By her light draught th.c little
Petrel was enabled to more within
1000 yards. Here, firing swiftly but
accurately, she commanded every
thing still flying the Spanish flag.
The other ships were also doing their
whole duty anJ s">on not one red and
yellow ensign remained aloft cxc ;pt on
a battery up the coast.
The Spanish flagship and tho Castilla
had long been burning fiercely and the
last vessel to be abandoned was the
Don Antonio de Ulloa, which lurched
over and sank. Then the Spanish flag
on the arsenal staff was shelled down
and at 12:30 o'clock a white flag was
hoisted there.
A signal was made to the Petrel to
destroy all the vessels in the inner har
bor, and Lieutenant Hughes, with an
armed boat's crew, set fire to the Don
Juan de Austria, the Marquis Duero,
the Isla de Cuba and the Correo.
The large transport Manila and many
tugboats and small craft fell into our
hands.
"Capture or deÃt-Â«v the Spanish
squadron," were Dewey's orders. Never
were instructions more effectually car
ried out. Within se-\ en hours after ar
riving on the scene of action nothing
remained to be done.
The following wounded, all on the
Baltimore:
Lieutenant F. "W. Kellogg.
Ensign N. E. Irwln.
Enlisted men: Barlow, Budinger,
Covert, O'Keefe,Ricclardelli and Snel
grove.
They were woundsd during the
first engagement.
HERALD-CALL CABLE
READ TO THE PRESIDENT
NEW YORK, May 7.â^. Washington
special to .he Herald says: "This is
the most satisfactory and complete re
port we have yet had from any source."
This is the observation of President
McKinley to-night after carefully read
ing with earnest attention every line
of the Herald's cable from its special
correspondent on board the flagship
Olympia, graphically and â telligently
describing the greatest n.val battle of
modern history.
President McKinley was in the Cabi
net room conferring with Colonel Hast
ings of Pennsylvania and Colonel Her
rick of Ohio when the text of the Her
ald's important cable was shown to
him. It was read aloud Ly Secretary
Porter.
President McKinley and his visitors
listened with almost breathless atten
tion to every word of the message, all
those present manifesting the great
pleasure and satisfaction they derived
from the Herald's news.
President McKinley was aware that
the Herald had a special correspondent
on board Admiral Dewey's flagship,
and he had been anxiously awaiting his
description of the battle for several
days. He had expected from the first
to receive the most full and authentic
information through the Herald, and
the oemarks he -r.de after hearing read
the report to-night showed that he was
not disappointed.
The Herald's dispatch was sent to him
in installments and after reading thÂ«
first portion he eagerly requested that
the remainder be sent as quickly as
possible.
The President and his callers spent
considerable time in discussing the
great victory of Commodore Dewey, as
described by the Herald's special cor
respondent, and they were au warm in
their praise of the naval commanders
and men who participated in the great
battle and of the Herald's correspond
ent, who had so graphically described
the important event.
DECLARED WITHOUT
PARALLEL IN HISTORY
WASHINGTON, May 7.â The re
markable disparity between the casual
ties on the American and Spanish
ships, as shown by Dewey's reports,
was a source of special comment, and
the military attaches of one of the
embassies said such a disparity was
without parallel in history. How the
Spaniards could have lost 150 killed and
250 wounded, while the American loss
was confined to a few men slightly
injured, is regarded by the foreign ob
servers as clearly disclosing the utter
worthlessness of Spanish arms. The
Embassador of one of the great pow
ers said it showed that the guns of the
Spanish forts, as well as those on their
ships, were worthless, otherwise they
would have inflicted at least some mor
tality upon the American sailors.
"It recalls Solferino," said one. "At
that time France and Austria were at
war, but the range of the French guns
was longer than that of the Austrians.
That brought them together on unequal
terms, and the simple difference in the
length of the range of the French guns
determined the outcome of that battle.
So it was with Dewey. He not only
had the guns, but they had the mod
ern strength and destructiveness, while
the Spanish guns were antiquated and
guns only in name. It serves to show
that in the warfare of to-day a na
tion must have weapons of the most
modern pattern, else it is at a terrible
disadvantage, and its men are practi
cally at the mercy of an enemy having
all the latest appliances of destructive j
warfare. It is the lesson of Solferino
over again and this time Spain learns
it,"
Admiral Dewey cut the cable himself, I
and though he offers no explanation for !
doing so, it is believed his purpose was !
not only to prevent the Spanish Gov- |
ernor-General from communicating |
with his own Government, but also to
prevent the foreign Consuls at Manila
from interfering with his plans by cab
ling protests to their governments. He
made it impossible for them to sum
mon any war vessels to enforce the
protests they were expected to make
against the siege of Manila.
PANAY TAKEN
BY SPANIARDS.
MADRID, May 7.â An official dis
patch received here by way of Labuan,
an island and British colony six miles
from the coast of Borneo, says the
Spaniards have captured the island of
Panay, c-ne of the Philippine group,
which is said to have been the head
quarters of the insurrection against the
Jovernment of Spain. Panay, It Is al-
leged, was defended by 4000 insurgents,
and it is said 172 of them were killed
on the spot, . while : 500 others are re
ported to have been killed while re
treating. "â¢
L The Spanish official says that only
two Spanish - officers ' and seventy- two
soldiers were wounded, while Panay is
said to have been practically de
stroyed.
According to the Spanish official the
Spanish military operations at Panay
are looked upon as being "most import
ant for the pacification of the islands."

SPAIN'S RECOURSE
IS POINTED 0"T
PARIS, May 7.â The Temps this aft
ernoon, commenting upon the situa
tion in Spain, says: "When the mo-
ment comes, and it cannot be far dis
tant, Spain must manfully make up
her mind to inevitably sacrifice and
seek directly through the United
States or by recourse to the good of
fices of the powers a solution of her
troubles compatible with her hon r as
well as conformable with the laws of
destiny."
Death of Engineer Randall.
WASHINGTON, May 7.â A cable
gram received from the commander of
the McCulloch states that Chief Engi
neer F. B. Randall died May 1. It is
supposed that his death was due to ex
citement during the battle.

OF THE
ISLANDS
Administration Perplexed
as to What Will Be Done
With the Philippines.
International Questions Raised
May Prove Difficult to Solve â¢
and Cause Trouble.
NEW YORK, May 7.â The Washing
con correspondent of the Herald sends
the following: President McKinley and
Congress are face to face with the
question of what shall be done with
the Philippine Islands. Rear Admiral
Dewey's victory has completely broken
Spain's power over her former colony,
and the United States is responsible
far the government of the Islands per
manently, or until they are turned
over to some power capable of estab
lishing and maintaining a stable gov
ernment.
Until actually confronted with the
problem which now presents itself^ew
public men have given much thought
to its solution, and the consequence is
that few of them are now prepared to
express any decided opinion as to what
the policy of the Government ought to
be. The international questions raised
by the taking of the Philippines may
prove difficult of solution, and many of
the public men with whom I have
talked are of the o-pinion that it might
be more difficult for the United States
t<; let go of the islands than to retain
them. No one believes it will be prac
: give the islands back to Spain,
even in return for a heavy war in
nity.
Spanish rule in the Philippines was
: ottering- to its fall when Admiral
y utterly annihiliated it. Even if
could raise money enough to pay
the Indemnity she would be powerless
to re-establish her authority over the
rebellious inhabitants of the islands.
Any extension of the inlluences of one
pean nation in the Orient is re
ily by all the other
powers that it may prove to be imprac
ticable for the United States to turn
ta over to any European power
â¢ dangerir.g a world-wide war.
I friction would probably be caused
country should permanently held
.irnis.
Tilt- authorities here understand very
well that Great Britain and Japan
would welcome the United States in the
Philippines. Japan is particularly anx
to have the United .States retain !
slands. The Japanese Government i
has taken a very strong ground against
any European nation obtaining a foot
bold in Chinese territory opposite the j
newlj possession of
and it is believed that with ;
the United States in pnssession of the
Philippines, just to the south of For
:â¢ sa, the Japanese position would be
tly strengthened.
Ir is foreseen that if the United
States is to retain the islands it means
his country is to pursue a com- j
merciaJ and financial policy along the j
same lines as those c-f Great Britain, j
and that its natural tendency would;
be to lead to an alliance between the
1 States, Great Britain and
Japan. It is no wonder, with all these
perplexing problems and possibilities
thrust upon them, that public men are
: â  in making un their minds as to
olicy which this country ought to ;
pursue. When I called on Senator i
: of Minnesota, chairman of the '
Senate Committee on Foreign Rela
tions, this afternoon, I found him hard :
iit work in his library with a table full
of t ks and maps relating to the Phil
e Islands and the Orient. The
r talked interestingly about the
Islands, their inhabitants and their re
is, but he asked to be excused j
from saying at this time as to what
the policy of the United States should
regard to them. He said he had j
not been able to- make up bis mind
fully on the question up to the |
ent." and* owing to his omcial position,
he thought it would be unwise for him
to express any hastily formed opinion:
for publication.
Representative Pearson of North
Carolina, one of the Republican mem- ;
hers of the House Committee on For- j
eign Affairs, said to me: "I do not be- I
lieve that the United States Govern- j
rr.ent will hold the islands any longer
than may be necessary to secure pay
ment of a war indemnity from Spain, j
One thing of which I am firmly con- j
] is that the events of the past ten j
will insure the building of the '
,;guan canal."
â 'or J. B. Foraker of Ohio said:
pinion there is but one course
and that is a very simple one,
raise the stars and stripes over the j
Islands and keep thorn there. We have j
come by them fair and honestly enough.
i ow that we have them it would;
be foolish to give them away. They,
are worth far more to us than we could I
ever get for them and the sooner this
country realizes that it is a power
ig the nations of the world and
colonial possessions the better." j

NEW YORK. May 7.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald sends
the following: Intense enthusiasm and
serene satisfaction was expressed by
the officials in Washington to-day at
the character of the news received from
Manila. Practically unhampered as he
was by instructions from Washington
and acting under a plan of campaign
prepared by himself Admiral Dewey's
victory reflects all the more credit upon
himself. It is true that Assistant Sec
retary Roosevelt several months ago
urged that when hostilities commenced
with Spain the Philippines be taken,
and that the War Board give con
sideration to the matter, which culmin
ated in the instructions to Admiral
Dewey.
These instructions were general in
character, and it can be stated on au
thority that they directed him to steam
at once to the Philippines and capture
and destroy the vessels of the Span'sh
fleet before attempting to engage in
operations against the fortifications.
But it was Admiral Dewey's plan that
caused him to enter the harbor in the
gray of morning that brought on the
engagement when the Spaniards were
naif asleep.
In wiring to Dewey informing: him
that the President had promoted him to
be an "acting admiral," and that ha
would recommend a vote of thanks
from Congress, Secretary Long evi
dently meant "acting rear-admiral."
There is no authority in law for the
appointment of an admiral, rear-ad
miral being the highest grade recog
nized. By directing Admiral Dewey to
assume the rank and titie of that grade
he has made that officer the senior offi
cer of the naval service, an enviable
position to hold.
Although an acting admiral. Admiral
Dewey will hot draw the pay of that
grade, that being prohibited by law,
and the only reward he will get out of
his act for the present, at least, will
be the rank and title and the knowledge
of the gratification felt by the adminis
tration and the country at his glorious j
work.
From the President down to the mes
sengers in the Navy Department pa
triotic gratification is felt at the re
sult of the Philippine campaign. Many
prominent public men called upon the
chief executive to-day and congratu
lated him on the triumph of the Ameri
can arms in the far east, anJ to each
of them the President expressed his
heartfelt satisfaction and gratitude to
the officers and men of the entire Asi
atic squadron for the -bravery, skill and
judgment displayed during the entire
attack.
Secretary Long was also the recipi- ,
ent of many congratulations, and at I
the instance of Senator Mark Hanna, !
who listened with the newspaper men
and department employes to the read
ing of Dewey's dispatches this morn- i
ing, three hearty cheers were given for j
the admiral and for the brave men who
by his direction have destroyed the j
Spanish power in the Philippines. In
order that there might be no doubt of
Admiral Dewey's dispatches promptly
reaching the department I understand
that duplicates were sent over two
cable lines and they came to the de- j
partment early this morning and ne
cessitatftd double work for Lieutenant
H. H. Whittlesey and Lieutenant G. W. j
Logan, the cipher experts who are on j
duty in the Bureau of Navigation.
Assistant Secretary Roosevelt made
this statement to me this afternoon: i
"Admiral Dewey has won a victory
greater than any since Trafalgar, with !
the exception of Farragut's. It is one ;
of the greatest sea fights of all time,
and every American is Dewey's ad- j
mirer. The chief thing .that it shows is
the absolute necessity, even with the '
new engines of war themselves, to have
men in the conning towers and men be- !
hind the guns trained to the highest |
possible point. Though the American
fleet was superior to the Spanish, yet
the Spanish batteries and the danger
of navigating the bay made material j
odds against the Americans, yet so cool j
; . â : daring was Dewey, so skillful his,
captains and so well-trained his gun- j
ners that the Spaniards were smashed
to atoms, while our people were prac- |
tically unscratehed. In fact the Ameri
can fire was so overwhelming that it
practically paralyzed the Spaniards."
Members of the war board besides As- j
sistant Secretary Roosevelt gave to Ad- ,
miral Dewey the entire credit for the !
glorious victorymhe won.
"It is a most complete and glorious
victory," said Rear- Admiral Sioard, :
president of the board. "Manila being!
the key to the islands and the center.;
of the Spanish force and under his !
control, he will have no difficulty in I
holding it until troops arrive."

"It is a big thing, a glorious victory,
said Captain A. S. Barker, another j
member of the war board, "and it is a

DEWEY'S VICTORY
A TRIBUTE TO THE
AMERICAN NAVY
Rear Admiral Gherardi Says It
Demonstrated Courage and
Efficiency.
NEW YORK, May 7.â Rear-Admiral
Bancroft Gherardi, 'retired, said to
day:
"The greatest tribute to the courage
and efficiency of the United State?
navy was paid when the Spanish fleet
was destroyed by the guns of Commo
dore Dewey's squadron. That victory
is a practical demonstration and an
additional proof, if any be needed, that
the great advantages in naval action
are things pre-eminently possessed by
our navy: First, the high efficiency of
the drill of our men; the constant
training they have had in target prac
tice, and the fact that they have been
taught that the guns aboard ships are
not there to be looked at, but to be
used, and that the deadly execution
they are capable of doing is possible
only by the men's efforts.
"The victory at Manila was full and
complete. It would have been impossi
ble to exceed or add to it in any way.
"What fs Dewey's achievement? He
steams into Manila Bay at the dead
hour of night . through the narrower of
two channels and as soon as there is
daylight enough to grope his way
about he puts his ships in line of bat
tle and brings on an engagement, the
greatest in many respects in ancient
or modern warfare. The results are
known the world over â every ship in
the Spanish fleet destroyed, the harbor
Dewey's own, his own ships safe from
the shore batteries, owing to the strat
egic position he occupies, and Manila
his whenever he cares to take it.
"Quick and decisive was the blow. He
did not wait to attack the weaker
place, but struck home, unmindful of
unknown dangers that lurked about
him. Although he knew that the har
bor of Manila was so deep and broad
that he had little fear from mines or
torpedoes at the entrance, he was, of
course, aware that at some part of the
bay destruction awaited him. Yet he

took the risk, the same as his famous
predecessor and teacher, Farragut,
who, at Mobile, when he saw one of
his ships blown up by a torpedo and
another rapidly nearing destruction,
said: 'Go ahead. Captain Drayton.
D n the torpedoes.' What his pu
pil's language was we do not know, but
he certainly lived up to precepts laid
down by the then greatest naval hero.
"Another point which his victory em
phasizes is that aggressive superiority
means much in naval warfare. In that
quality Dewey was unmeasurably su
perior to his opponents. His attack
was fairly a storm.
"Another feature that should not be
lost sight of in recounting this deed of
bravery is the fact that he was handi
capped woefully in maneuvering. Of
course one of the first things done at
Manila by the Spanish authorities was
to remove from the harbor all guides
to commerce, such as lights and buoys.
This having been done, it would have
required the lyghest grade of intelli
gence to make use of the limited pail
ing directions left in the hands of his
navigating officers. Yet had he been
maneuvering his squadron in New
York harbor under friendly eyes he
could not have been more skillful in
avoiding treacherous shnnls than he
was at Manila. During the period of
the engagements his ships were con
stantly moving, yet never went amiss.
"The lesson in this, as naval experts
will take It. is that In a wide harbor
an opposing fleet once past the forti
fications may retire at any time out of
range of the shore guns and recuper
ate.
"It has been a mooted point among
naval architects â the advantage of
v.fKidwnrk inside ship as compared with
other compositions. The question was
only partially decided by the Yalu bat
tle. I think the Manila fight has con
clusively settled it. The destruction
wrought by flying splinters aboard the
Spanish ships was, from all accounts,
fearful."

TO SEND
THE MEN
AT ONCE
Troops Will Be Dispatched
to Aid in Holding the
Philippines.
Ten Thousand Regulars and Vol
unteers to Be Hurried to the
Islands in Transports.
NEW YORK, May 7-â The Her
ald's Washington correspondent tele
graphs: Troops will be ient imme
diately to assist Acting Rear Admiral
Dewey in holding the Philippines. As
soon as the official report from Dewey
had been changed from cipher to Eng
lish the President, Secretary Lori" and
Secretary Algtr had a long consultation
at the White House. Admiral Dewey
says he needs men, and it was decided
that all the men he wanted should be
given to him.
Immediately upon Secretary Aider's
return to the War Department he had a
conference with Adjutant General Cor
bin and Major General Miles and the
number of troops to be sent to Manila
was definitely decided noon.
I am told that the expedition will
leave S^n Francisco some day next
week and make all possible haste to
Manilla.
The quartermaster general of Califor
nia has already engaged the necessary
transports for 10,000 men. He wired
the department to-day that all ships be
longing to the Panama and Pacific Mail
Steamship lines had been put at the dis
posal of the United States. These are
all splendid vessels and are capable of
making very fast time.
Major General Miles says that he can
easily get in perfect organization and
ready for service 5000 men in a period
of five days. In five days more We feels
assured that 5000 more troops will be
in condition to leave San Francisco.
The War Department is very desirous
to get the men oft to Manila as soon as
possible, as in all probability the expe
dition will leave in two divisions of 5000
troops each.
Bepresentntives from all branches
of service will be sent off to the Phil-
ippines, s the Government feels sure
that there will be a great deal of ac
tual fighting.
Cavalry, infantry' and both heavy and
light artillery will leave San Francisco
for the purpose of assuring an American
victory at Manila and in the surround
ing islands of the group.
It is the purpose of President Mc-
Kinley to drive all the Spaniards from
the Philippines. Owing to the need of
some heavy artillery tftl of the Third
Regiment on the Pacific Coast will not
be removed to Manila, but I am told
that two batteries of this regiment will
be sent. Four companies of the Four- '
teenth Infantry have been recalled from
Vancouver barracks to San Francisco
and will surely be sent with the expe
dition.
It is understood other troops to go
to Manila will be taken from the vol
unteer quotas of California, Washing
ton. Oregon and Nevada. Two of the
four batteries of the artillery regiments
and two regiments of infa try in Cali
fornia's quota will be a part of the ex
pedition. Washington will furnish one
regiment of infantry. Nevada will send
all the cavalry that will go to Manila.
There is some talk that Torry's mounted
delegation will be with the command of
General Merriam. It has Iso been de
cided to send Shoup's Ranger.; from
Idaho.
The coast of California will be left
amply protected. Three troops of the

will relieve two batteries of the Third
Artillery and will do duty in the coast
defense fortifications. These men with
two batteries left from the volunteer
quota, it is considered, will be suffi
cient defense for the coast.
Having been advised by Admiral
Dewey that he is in need of ammuni
tion, it is proposed by Secretary Lonjf
to send him a supply without delay.
The entire destruction of the Spanish
fleet makes it unnecessary for a man
of-war to be sent as convoy to the
troops, and if it should be found that it
will take quite a good deal of time to
collect the number of trooos that are re-,
quired for the service in the conquered:
islands the Charleston will probably be
ordered to take a deckload of ammuni
tion aboard and sail at once for Manila.
Under direction of Captain O'Neil
ammunition for the Asiatic squadron is
being put up at Mare Island navy yard.
I learned to-day that the Carpenter
Steel Company had sent a large number
of projectiles to Mare Island, and these
will be put aboard the Charleston at
once.
"Although none of our men are
badly wounded," said Surgeon Stern
berg to me to-day, "it is still the inten
tion of the department to send out a
large supply of medical necessities.
The surgeons on board the vessels have
probably used a great deal of their
equipment in attending to the wounded
prisoners. It is therefore necessary to
replace that which has been tal. n. and
the City of Peking will convey suoolies
to Manila."
Naval Constructor Capps, with a
score of mechanics, will also go to Man
ila i:i accordance with the original pro
gramme. It is believed by the depart
ment that it will be well to attempt to
repair some of the Spanish vessels,
which will be kept for defense of the
islands.
Prompt measures were taken to-day
to send coal to Admiral Dewey's fleet.
Orders were placed with San Francisco
agents to send two shiploads of coal to
Manila. The work of placing the coal
on board the colliers is to commence at
once under the contract made, and the
ships are to proceed as rapidly as pos
sible to their destination. By taking
this prompt action the administration
believes it will be able to prevent Ad-
miral Dewey from experiencing any in
convenience arising from lack of fuel.
FARRAGUT'S MANTLE FALLS
ON DEWEY'S SHOULDERS
At a Banquet Rear Admiral Belknap
Speaks of the Brilliancy of
the Victory.
BOSTON, May 7. â At the banquet of
the Massachusetts Club to-night Rear
Admiral Belknap said the brilliancy of
Commodore Dewey's victory filled him
with gladness, and he declared that the
Spanish navy would be, or should be,
the objective point of the United States
navy, and the destruction of that navy
the sternest aim of our navy.
He deprecated the unwillingness of
Congress in times of peace to make any
appropriations for the navy. He highly
praised Commodore Dewey, and said
that if the official story of his doings
at Manila confirms the report of hia
victory there it will show that Farra
gut's mantle of resolution and bravery
has fallen upon a most worthy and in
trepid successor.

SENOR MORET
HAS AVERTED
THE CRISIS
Eloquent Assertions That
May Keep the Minis
ters in Power.
In the Cortes Deputy Mella Quotes
From the Scriptures and Is
Expelled in Disorder.
I Copyrighted, IS9S, by James Gordon Bennett.
MADRID, May 7. â Only a few
hours have elapsed since Senor Moret
made his defense of the Government's
policy, yet the change in public opin
ion is enormous. Yesterday morning
people were discussing when the min
istry would fall. To-day they are
asking themselves what they would
gain if it did. The answer pretty
generally is "Nothing."
Among members of the Cortes
there is now a pronounced feeling
that a Cabinet crisis must be averted
at all costs. This is certainly due to
the influence of Senor Moret's decla
ration. He adroitly disarmed the op
position by pointing out that the Lib
erals' autonomist policy was the only
logical development of the reforms
â which the late Premier Canovas had
begun. He proved that their policy
could not be called a failure, seeing
that even before the Cuban Parlia
ment assembled commerce had been
re-established, the insurgent insur
rectionary nucleus diminished, culti
vation of tobacco and sugar had be
gun again and customs duties in
creased up to the day the blockade
began. The fair-minded among Gov
ernment opponents are forced to ad
mit that these successes were quite
enough to justify the confidence of
the Cabinet in the belief that war
could be averted.
Then he utterly routed the in
transigeants by holding up for ex
amination what these latter have
been calling the Government's want
of foresight, and what he called fatal
ity.
"It is not through want of fore
sight." he said, "that Spain has only
sixteen million inhabitants and the
United States seventy million. It is
not through want of foresight that
the base of operations is so far from
the United States and so near to
them. Where is our navy? We have
one fleet in the Philippines, another
in Cuba and others in the peninsula,
the Canaries and the Balearic Isl
ands."
This plain speaking staggered the
Cortes. Senor Moret then made a
merciless onslaught on the Carlist
minority, and with a fervent appeal
to patriotism won an oratorical vic
tory, materially strengthening the 'â

The Reported Chase of a
Schooner Into Ha
vana Harbor.
Special Dispatch to The Calt
HAVANA, May 7.â At 8:30 o'clock
.this morning two American cruisers
â¢which were pursuing the Spanish
schooner Santiago, bound for Yucatan,
â with salted fish, approached the Vedado
batteries, which fired at them when
about five miles off shore. Six shots
were discharged at the Americans. A
local paper says that one of the pro
jectiles carried off the smokestack and
one of the masts of the American cruis
er which was in the lead, and that
another projectile fell upon the deck
of the other cruiser.
The Americans replied with twelve
shots, but the projectiles fell two miles
off the batteries and the cruisers re
treated under full steam. One of the
shots from the batteries fell near one
of the American vessels, covering her
deck with water and it is asserted posi
tively that a hole was made in her hull
below the water line.
The San L,azaro Vedado was full of
people watching the encounter through
opera-glasses and applauding the fir
ing of the Spaniards.
At 11:30 o'clock the Santiago entered
the harbor in tow of the Susie. One of
*the American scouts carried off a boat
from the schooner's stern. It is re

stopped when it can be done oppor
tunely. All interest, therefore, cen
tered around the action of the Cortes
to-day when the Chamber of Deputies
witnessed the most uproarious scenes
[ in the annals of the Cortes.
Senor Mella, a Carlist Deputy, first
censured the Government for not
making an alliance with France and
Russia, and severely denounced the
scheme of autonomy, which, he as
serted, far from averting war, had
provoked it. He declared that Presi
dent McKinley's messages were full
of insults, which the Spanish Govern
ment had tolerated. He said that
Senor Moret, the Minister of the Col
onies, who was at fault, was obliged
to be escorted when he goes into the
streets, while Lieutenant-General
Weyler is obliged to hide himself ow
ing to public ovations. Senor Mella
then quoted from Isaiah iii : 12 : "As
for my people, children are their op
pressors, and women rule over them.
O, my people, they which lead thee
cause thee to err, and destroy the way
of thy paths."
Vehement protests were entered,
and Senor Sagasta cried: "Such utter
ances were never heard inside this
house."
Mella replied that he meant if ,
peace were obtained through the
mediation of the powers, it would be
a dishonor to Spain.
Senor Sagasta, the Premier, sup
ported by a majority of the Chamber,
protested amid great confusion
against Senor Mella's language. The
Bepublicans sided with the Carlists.
The Speaker requested Senor Mella to
withdraw his words, but this the
Deputy refused to do, saying that
they were Scriptural.
The President named Senor Mella
thrice, declaring that his refusal to
withdraw the language he had used
was disrespectful to the reigning
dynasty, and submitted the question
of the expulsion from the Chamber
of tb.3 offending member. A division
was taken amid a terrible uproar, re
sulting in the expulsion of Senor
Mella by a vote of 199 to 19, the Re
publicans voting with the Carlists.
Upon the announcement of the re
sult, both the Republicans and Carl
ists walked from the Chamber. The
Carlists declare they will not return
unless Senor Mella be readmitted.
The President of the Chamber ex
plains that the expulsion applies only
to to-day's sitting.
The :-icid<?nt created intense ex
citement both inside and outside the
chamber.
M'CORD EAGER

The Governor of Arizona
Wants to Fight in the
Philippines.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHOENIX, May 7.â Governor McCord
to-day wired to President McKinley of
fering his services to go to the Philip
pines. The announcement created the
greatest surprise, for, although the
Governor had shown great activity in
making- war preparations, his friends
were not aware of his personal ambi
tion to go to the front.
Governor McCord served in Congress
from a Wisconsin district some years
ago, and during that time became inti
mately acqainted- with the President.
Subsequently, in 1893, he moved to Ari
zona and took an active part in local
politics. His appointment as Governor
of Arizona was due in a great measure
to the friendly relations between him
and the President. For this reason it
is generally thought the request of
Governor McCord will be received fav
orably at the White House, and, in all
probability, complied with.
Governor McCord is a veteran of the
late war, and is over 60 years of age.
His message to the President is as fol
lows:
I would like permission to raise and
lead a regiment to go to the Philippines
or elsewhere. I could use the National
Guard, comprised of 600 well-drilled and
well-o"fficered men, and the balance could
be enlisted quickly. The National Guard
could soon be replaced. There would be
absolutely no danger to the Territory by
this, as with regular troops and militia
and many organizations of minute men
and home guards now organized absolute
protection is guaranteed. If given per
mission to raise this regiment and go
with it I would accept leave of absence
without pay or resign. Could have regi
ment in muster in six days. We are only
thirty-six hours from San Francisco.

Special Dispatch to The CalL
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, May 7.
Telegrams from all parts of the State
are pouring in to the various members
of the California Congressional delega
tion urging the claims of different per
sons for appointment as brigadier gen
eral of volunteers. Senator Perkins re
ceived over 100 dispatches to-day, most
of them urging the appointment of
General John H. Dickinson. Colonel
Barry says he is mustering 1000 men,
and all of them favor Dickinson. It ap
pears that a great majority of the
guard prefer Dickinson to any one else.
It is understood that while the Presi
dent himself is favorably inclined
toward Colonel Otis of Los Angeles,
who served with him in the army dur
ing the civil war. Secretary Alger is
very bitterly opposed to Otis on ac
count of the criticism of his course in
the San Pedro harbor matter, printed
on the editorial page of the Los An
geles Times some time ago.
The President told Senators "White
and Perkins that he would appoint any
good man who was recommended by
tlie united delegation In Congress from
California, but as harmony seems im
possible, both White and Perkins be
lieve that California will lose the brig
adiership and that it will go to Ore*
gon or Washington. It is understood
that White is for Otis; Perkins is rather
inclined to support Dickinson; Barham
and Hilborn are for any good man that
the delegation will unite upon; DeVries
is for Budd; Maguire for Warfleld,
while Loud has not expressed a prefer,
ence but is holding aloof until other
members of the delegation have made
their recommendation.
Warren English telegraphed to-day
strongly urging the naming of Dickin
son. Warfield seems to be very popu
lar with the officers and men of the

his behalf.

STOCKTON, May 7.â The cheers of
thousands of exultant Americans, the
booming of anvils and the strains of
national anthems resound throughout
the city to-night. Mingled with this
wild demonstration of delight over the
achievements of the American fleet be
fore Manila is the clanging of bells and
the screeching of whistles throughout
the city. It was only at noon that a
public jollification was planned and the
announcement in the evening press
brought forth a. ready response. At
sundown the factory whistles ran out
their steam and by 8 o'clock Hunter
plaza and the business streets were one
mass of men, women and children, in
holiday attire. Public buildings and
business blocks were brilliantly illum
inated and in the whole history of the
city such an outpouring never before
was witnessed.
On the plaza ex-Congressman James
A. Louttit and Judge C. P. Rendon, the
latter of Spanish descent, voiced the
patriotic sentiments of the vast throng
in eloquent language.
At the armory the scene was warlike.
The soldiers were busy preparing to go
to the front to-morrow. They have
donned their uniforms and when the
other companies arrive here to-morrow
they will be escorted to,the steamship
by the Grand Army veterans, public
officials and civic societies. The Sixth
Regiment band will head the pro
cession, which will march down Weber
avenue to the steamboat landing.
There the troops will be drawn up to
await the companies from Visalia,
Fresno and Merced. A battalion will
be reorganized with the soldiers v/ho
arrive on the Valley Road train. All
told about 500 men will leave the city
to-morrow evening.
The steamship T. C. Walker has been
chartered to take the troops to the bay.
She will leave the slip at about 6 o'clock
and will steam slowly down the river,
arriving at San Francisco early in the
morning. There the soldiers will be
reorganized into battalion form and
march to the headquarters of Captain
Carrington at Page and Gough streets,
where they will be sworn into Uncle
Sam's volunteer service on Monday.
SANTA ROSA, May 7.â The City of
Roses to-night rang from end to end
with lusty cheers for Admiral Dewey
at a big public demonstration given by
the citizens. The scene on Santa Rosa's
streets has been one which will never
fade from the memory of the crowds
participating in the demonstration. A
big parade was formed in front of the
Courthouse at 8 o'clock. The order of
parade was as follows: Flag bearers,
Santa Rosa band, Company E. N. G. C.
under the command of Captain Haven,
citizens 1500 strong carrying -flags, and
Ellsworth Post of the Grand Army.

structions have been given by Captain
Charles O'Neil, chief of the bureau of
ordnance, that . armor piercers be
loaded with thi3 explosive and sent to
Key West, where they will be taken
aboard the ships of Rear Admiral
Sampson's squadron. Captain O'Neil
feels justified in taking this action in

with jovite show it is a safe explosive J
and capable of terrible execution. .
Shells of from 8 to 13-inch caliber, in
clusive, will be loaded with from 20 to
150 pounds of jovite. Captain O'Neil \
told me such snells would not be em- i
ployed against fortifications, as similar j
armor-pierdng projectiles loaded with
gunpowder could do better work
against land defenses, but they will be
fired at armored ships.
Experiments have demonstrated that j
it is practicable to fire an armor-pierc- i
ing projectile loaded with jovite against
a comparatively thick plate and by â 
means of a time fuse the explosive will
explode after the shell has passed
through the plate. If such a projectile |

KINGSTON, Jamaica, May 7.â Mr.

off the refugees there. The Adula, a
vessel of 372 tons, is owned by the At

I At a given signal the fire bell was

SALINAS, May 7.â Upon the receipt
I of bulletins containing Dewey's report
the town went wild with patriotic
, fever. Troop C, which has sent 107
names on the volunteer list to head
' quarters, was anxious to know if it
would be called upon to go to the Phil

VIRGINIA CITY, Nev., May 7.â
When news of Dewey's victory reached
here there was an upheaval of patriot
ism. Bells were rung, whistles blown,
salutes fired and a band paraded the
streets all afternoon.
SACRAMENTO, May 7.â One of the
most enthusiastic and spirited demon
strations ever known in Sacramento
took place to-night. At about 4 o'clock
this afternoon a committee of citizens
met in the office of Mayor Land and ar
ranged for a celebration of Commander
Dewey's victory. The announcement
was made in the Evening* Bee that an
impromptu parade would take place,
after which there would be speaking in
Capital Park.
At an early hour immense throngs
assembled on the sidewalks and at 6
o'clock, when the parade formed, the
streets were crowded. No such shouts
ever went up in Sacramento as those
which greeted the men who marched
through the principal streets. Grand
Army men, a company of State militia,
the Iroquols and citizens formed in line
at the plaza and presented an unbroken
line from curb to curb for a distance of
fifteen blocks. Red fire and skyrockets
Illuminated the streets and 10.000 Amer
ican flags rose and fell in the gentle
breeze which sprung up from the south.
Arriving at the Capitol, Mayor Land
first addressed the throngr and then in
troduced President D. A. Llndley of the
Board of Trade. Following Mr. Lindley
came Chief Justice Beatty. Orove L.
Johnson. Elwood Bruner, Judge Hink

and others.
The addresses were received with un
bounded enthusiasm. Many who could
not get near enough to hear formed In
line and again were led through the
streets with wild shouts and long hur
rahs. All in all it was one of the most
memorable episodes in the history of
the capital city.
VALOR OF
DEWEY IS
REWARDED.
Made an Admiral for rjis
Most Glorious Achieve

Naval Officers Amazed by His
Matchless SKiU and Greatest
Victory of Modern Tiroes.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, May 7.
To-night In the far-away Bay of
j Manila the gallant Dewey, yesterday a
I commodore, walks the deck of his flag
| ship an admiral of the United States
navy. For six days the administration
and the country waited with keenest
anxiety for the details of his wonder
ful victory over the Spanish fleet and
I batteries; to-day the cable brought the
j long-expected dispatch, and a few
: hours later flashed back to Hongkong
the nation's thanks and the bestowal
of a richly merited honor upon the hero
I of the most signal triumph recorded
in naval annals, ancient or modern.
By direction of the President, Secre
; tary Long sent the following cable, dis
patch to Dewey:
WASHINGTON. May 7.â To Dewey,
Manila: The President, in the name of
the American people, thanks you and
your officers and men for your splendid
achievements and overwhelming victory
In recognition he has appointed you act
ing admiral, and will recommend a vote
of thanks to you by Congress. LONG.
The destruction of ten warships and
the silencing of half a score of shore
batteries without the loss of a ship or
a man is a feat so stupendous that the j
most experienced naval officers could
hardly believe their ears when in
breathless silence they heard Dewey's
terse and graphic message read to a
hundred eager newspaper correspond
ents. The matchless skill with which !
the attack was planned, the speed of j
its execution, and the tremendous force j
with which the blow was struck filled j
them with amazement. No parallel is
to be found in history for this remark
able accomplishment, and to Dewey's
credit is placed the first demonstration
of the terrible effectiveness of the mod
em warship manned by brave men and
commanded by cool and skillful offi
cers.
Dewey holds Manila at the mercy of
h:s fleet, but the actual invading of
the city may be delayed until the troops
to be dispatched to the Philippines next
week have arrived to garrison the
Spanish strongholds and prevent a
counter movement against the Ameri
can forces.

Looks weak. Who says that of you? "Worried,"
some say. But you are well aware that those who
say that you are weak know the truth. In your
common sense, why do you not try to alter the
state of affairs? It is ever so much better to be
manly than puny. It is a great deal more satisfac-
tory to be certain that you can do everything your
manhood urges than to be afraid that you will awake
ill. You have burdened your brain too much. You
have spent midnight oil. Now you regret. But you
are not alone. Others have been foolish.
"Hudyan" has made up for the follies of 20,000
men. It has turned the weaklings into brawny,
healthy men. Think of the pleasing and even the
I grand sensation you enjoyed as a boyâ or as a
young manâ when you first found out what good
? health was. Do you wish to see these days again?
If you do there is a possibility. You fear that you
have transgressed too grossly. Could you but know
I how many greater sinners against nature there are
in the world you would be full of hopeâ and not fear.
"Hudyan" has never yet failed, and it will not in
your case.
WELL â â YOU
What "Hudyan" does is this: It makes up the gen-
eral vitality to the normal point. It does for the
overworked farmer as much as it does for the man
mentally tired. It cures all forms of prostration. It
is nature's most efficient remedy. Circulars and tes-
timonials, which will tell you all about it, are freely
sent. And if you will but ask for medical advice it
will be sent to you without a particle of expense. No
matter what troubles you, the big Institute stands
ready and willing to help you. Write to-day and see.
HUDSON MEDICAL INSTITUTE,
Stockton, market and Ellis Streets, San Francisco.
A hundred telegrams were sent
speeding over the wires to-day to ex
pedite the departure from San Fran
cisco of troops and supplies for Dewey's
reinforcement, and by next Friday the
advance contingent of several thousand
infantry anu artillery will pass through
the Golden Gate on their way to Ma
nila. Others will go a day or two later,
though all plans are subject to such
modification as may be suggested by
further advices from Dewey, which it is
expected may soon be received at short
intervals over the cable now known to
be in his hands.
The effect of Dewey's victory at Ma
nila it is believed cannot fail to have
a most important effect upon the war.
The details of the engagement reveal
a condition of affairs that must be in
expressibly disquieting to the Spanish
authorities while most encouraging to
those of the United States. We have
already had sufficient evidence in the
minor phases of the war in Cuban
waters to demonstrate the great super
iority of American gunners, and now
the greater effectiveness of American
ships as bulwarks behind which to
fight has been emphasized at Manila.
The inexhaustible supplies of ammuni
tion and of everything that money can
buy which are at the command of the
United States can hardly fail to impress
the Spanish officials with the hopeless
ness of attempting to carry on the
warfare with an empty treasury and a
worthless credit. All these considera
tions taken in connection with the ef
ficiency of the Cuban blockade, which
is slowly but surely starving Blanco
and his forces into surrender, must have
their effect in Madrid and serve to con
vince even those who stand in greatest
fear of a revolution at home of the
folly of wasting more money and lives
in a senseless effort to satisfy the na
tional "honor."

TAMPA, Fla., May 7.â To say that
army officers here were elated when
I showed them the dispatch announc
ing the glorious victory of Commodore
Dewey's fleet at Manila conveys but a
faint impression of their feelings. A
certain kind of satisfaction was ex
pressed at the tremendous loss of the
enemy in killed and wounded and at
the entire absence of dead on our side.
It was well that the Maine had at last
been remembered. As for the six men
wounded on the American ships, as one
officer laughingly expressed it, "they
may have fallen down and broken their
arms or legs while carrying ammuni
tion."
General Shafter's face was wreathed
in smiles after he had finished reading
the dispatch.
"Nothing like it is known in the an
nals of naval history. It is unprece
dented," he said. "I can hardly real
ize it. The only way I can account
for it Is that Dewey kept his ships, as
much as possible, out of the range of
small guns and fought at long range.
Nothing like this battle has ever taken
place. Americans may feel proud of
their navy."
General Low of the engineer corps
said: "This is indeed great and glor
ious news. Additional laurels have
been gained by the American navy and
the battle of Manila will go down in
history as the most brilliant naval en
gagement ever fought."
General Lawton declared that the
battle was proof to the world of the
efficiency of the United States navy,
and a most practical refutation of
Spanish accusations that our ships
were not equal to those of other na
tions and that our men were not ef
ficient. Spain, he said, could now
bear personal testimony of the effi
ciency of our navy.
Colonel Rand, in command of the ar
tillery camp at Port Tampa, expressed
great satisfaction at the news from Ma
nila. He agreed with General Shafter
that Commodore Dewey had probably
kept his ships out of range of the
Spaniards' small guns and had fought
the enemy at long range.
Major Groesbeck of General Shatter's
staff fairly beamed when he read the
dispatch.
"All honor to Commodore Dewey, his
officers and men," he said. "They have
certainly fought a good fight. The re
sult of this battle should be a matter
of self-congratulation to every true
American."PRAISES THE

Thursday evening, after the clos
the Reichstag, Prince Hohen
the Imperial Chancellor, gave a
tion t.i the delegates, government

Considering his age the Chancellor is
remarkably vigorous. In an animated
conversation with some of his guests
at the reception, Prince Hohenlohe
Fc'jjf!: "As far as Germany's individual
interests an* concerned, the Hispano-
American war is not likely to injure

eaily to tell how far the political and.
commercial situation may be modified
as a rtsult of the struggle. In any;
case, Germany's material interests are j
â¢â  n ly on the American side, and it
la to nee a prooi of the political im- ;
maturity of the German people, and ;
particularly of the press, that tVey are,
lour]\ and almost unanimously on the
Spain in this fight."
ThÂ«se utterances tend to prove that
the G'-mKin Government at least secret
ly wishes the United States success.
In the meanwhile, however, the German
press continues to be rather unfriendly
toward the United States, both editor
ially and in the way of presenting war
news. The Kreuz Zeitung. the favor
ite organ ->f the army and nobility,
in noting this adverse feeling, says, in
its weekly* r"'litical review, that those
in Germany who are sympathizing with
the Americans are few and far between.
This paper further r.ays it thinks that
one of the outcomes of the present war
will be the "strengthening of centralism
and imperialism in the United States."
The comments of the German press
on the dashing victory of the American
squadron rit Manila makes a curious
Btudy. Until Monday last most of the
military editors of the newspapers
predicted an initial defeat of the Amer
ican navy and army, comparing the
latter unfavorably with the Spanish
forces. When forced to believe, how
ever, that an American victory had
I attained, they said nothing else
could be expected in view of the evi
dent superiority of the Americans, and
eulogized Spanish courage in fighting
again?! overwhelming odds.
As exemplifying the general tone of
the newspapers of Germany, the main
organ of the Center party, the Cologne
Yolks Zeitung, may be quoted. It says:
"We do not favor intervention in this
war, but we are of the opinion that the
European powers ought to exert strong
diplomatic pressure at the first oppor
tunity in order to shorten the war.
The Yankees have already swollen

sive victory hardly any European coun
try will be able to consort with them
diplomatically. In view of the un
friendly sentiments entertained in the
United .States toward Germany and the
many economic differences existing
â  Ti the two countries it is very
possible that Germany may be the
next victim of American impudence."
MAY COMMAND AN
AUXILIARY CHUISFR.
Senator Perkins Urges That Captain
Carroll Be Placed in Charge of
One of the Philippine Vessels.
WASHINGTON, May 7.â Senator
Perkins called on Secretary Long to
day and strongly urged that Captain
James Carroll, formerly of the Pacific
Coast steamer Queen, be placed in
command of an auxiliary vessel to be
sent to the Philippines. Perkins told
Secretary Long that Captain Carroll
was one of the most competent, cour
ageous and daring sailors that ever
trod a ship's dock. He recited to the
Secretary of the Navy the circumstance
ft Carroll's quelling a mutiny on board
the vessel that. carried MiniJcer Bur
lmgame to China many years ago. It
ii understood that Captain Carroll is
â willing and anxious to accept the ser
vice if he is assigned to command a
vessel by Secretary Long.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 8, 1898.
THE EMPOBITJM.
Beginning Monday and until closing time next Saturday night the test of all Clothing offers hold good.
We have either bought too many or haven't sold enough of the men's suits that were manufactured to retail
at $7. co to $1750. We cannot risk having any of them left on our hands for another season, for stocks in this store
are never carried over, and we do not think it good policy to wait until the end of summer to cut the prices and try
to sell them when they will not be wanted. We therefore divide them into three great lots this week and offer
some values that have never been equaled in San Francisco. Notwithstanding the remarkably low prices, our
guarantee of "Money back if you want it" goes with each suit.
Lot J.
Men's Wool Suits, suitable for business
purposes, neat gray and brown effects, in
Cheviots and Cassimeres, substantially
lined, tailored in correct fashion. We have
selected a variety of styles
from suits that were $7.50, mm =*
$8. 50 and $10, comprising dkf^SS
a full line of sizes, and 5*P i^^'***'
put a price tag on them 11 $wPT;
marked
MEN'S TROUSERSâ We have bought from a manufacturer who met with misfortune 300 pairs of pant?. They are
made of all-wool worsted in regular weightâ only two patterns, however. The patterns are a neat, quiet stripe, These <+Â« Ad
Pants cost to manufacture $2.75 a pair. You must come Monday or Tuesday for these, as they will surely sell in that J)^^^^
time at our special price, per pair *^

HONORS FOR DEWEY.
DEWEY'S glorious victory- at Manila appears
in brighter luster in the few words of his
modest dispatch than it did in the first re
ports. He accomplished the triple task of silencing
the forts on land, destroying the Spanish fleet in the
Orient and mastering the capital of the Philippines
without losing a ship or a man. In all the tides of
time, daring and skill have never achieved a greater
feat of war, and the brave commander from this time
forth will rank among the most famous sea captains
in history.
When the war with Spain broke out Lord Charles
Beresford, the most noted fighter in the British navy,
said the result of every encounter between the fleets
of the contending nations would be dependent more
upon the men in command than upon anything else.
While other critics have regarded sea power in these
days as a thing to be measured by the number of
ships, weight of armor and force of heavy guns a
nation lias in its navy, this experienced Engishman
has insisted from the first that never did personal
courage and skill on the part of a commander count
for more at sea than in these days. The modern war
ship is calculated to excite almost as much fear in
her own crew as in that of the enemy. Only the brave
can heroically fight these monstrous war machines,
and only the skillful whose skill does not waver in the
hour of peril can make the heroism successful.
Dewey has proven the truth of the estimate made
by Lord Beresford. His victory is the result of his
courage and skill rather than of his ships. Had he
been as timid as his Spanish opponents, or had his
men fired as wildly during the battle as the Spanish
gunners, the port of Manila would be still in Spanish
hands and the Spanish fleet would still be a menace
to American commerce in the Pacific.
It is gratifying to know that hereafter we can
speak of the hero as â¢'Admiral" Dewey. This title,
given him spontaneously by the people in talking of
his victory, has now been confirmed by the President.
The promotion has been well and worthily deserved.
The whole people will applaud the action of the
President in conferring it. A mighty deed of battle
equal to the highest ever achieved by our navy has
been nobly done, and it is fitting the commander who
won the victory should wear the title made illustrious
in our naval annals by the heroic Farragut.
It was long ago that Cap^list Bradbury kicked
a smaller man downstairs and was adjudged worthy
to pay a fine of $100. Now the higher court has sus
tained the lo.ver, and Bradbury must feel that he is
paying for "dead horse." Had he put up the money
while yet the memory of the kick was fresh and stim
ulating the pang would have been less severe.
If Tesla cannot disassociate himself from some of
the wild fakes sprung in his name he will soon be the
yellow journalist of the electric world. His artificial
lightning designed to strike hostile ships and strew
them in small pieces over the sea has not yet got into
working order, although Dewey seems to have been
loaded up with something very like it.
Whether the conduct of which School Director
Waller is strongly suspected comes under the head of
felony or misdemeanor is really of less importance
than the question of his guilt. In either case his use
fulness as a public official must be regarded as in a
measure impaired.
It is nothing more than simple justice that the pay
of Consuls withdrawn from Spanish territory should
be continued while they are home. It is worth some
thing to have been chased by a mob, called a "pig-
Yankee" and perhaps to have unsuccessfully dodged
bad eggs.
The Los Angeles Herald shows excellent taste in
copying a long article from The Call on the "Heroes
of the Battle of Manila." At this point its good taste
ends. It credits the article to the Chronicle.
It is evident from the rumors that Alger is to re
sign that the Secretary has again been refusing to
present to some correspondent full particulars as to
the department plans for conduct of the war.
There is a grave and growing suspicion that Span
ish soldiers only fight with zest when they find a
hospital full of wounded Cubans and guarded by
women nurses.

ThjE BATTLE OF MANILA.
I ;-tÂ»LL reports of the battle of Manila from an
eye-witness are given to the people of the West
* this morning by The Call, and to those of the
East by the New York Herald. No other paper on
the globe will have an account of the great victory
from a skilled correspondent on the scene of action.
Thus another triumph has been achieved by The Call
and Herald news service, which for the purpose of
gathering and disseminating the news of the war with
Spain is now without a competitor worthy of being
called a rival.
The accomplishment of this brilliant feat of jour
nalism has not been the result of accident or of any
stroke of good fortune. It is the outcome of well
laid plans arranged long ago in the expectation of
war. As far back as last January it was foreseen by
The Call and Herald that war with Spain was well
nigh inevitable, and that when war came the Philip
pines would be the scene of some of the first and
fiercest encounters of the two nations. Accordingly
Mr. Joseph L. Stickney, naval editor of the Herald
and one of the foremost authorities on naval matters
now living, was selected to act as the special cor
respondent of the two papers, and dispatched to the
Orient to watch the course of events there and be
prepared to report either a war between European
nations over the partition of China or a conflict be
tween the United States and Spain in those waters.
Mr. Stickney was in Hongkong when the war
broke out. He went with the United States fleet
on the expedition for the capture of Manila and was
on board the flagship Olympia when the fleet entered
the harbor. He watched the combat from the bridge
of the flagship, standing beside the commodore, and
saw the whole battle from beginning to end. An eye
witness of the great scene, with the inspiration of vic
tory thrilling his mind, he wrote the story we pub
lish this morning. Ever) r paragraph is a narrative of
heroism, every sentence gleams with the fire of battle,
every phrase is vivid with glowing patriotism, every
word is history.
Compared with this true story of the conflict the
wild romances which the yellow fakers may publish
as news under the pretense of having received it from
the Emperor of China, the Grand Tycoon or some
other barbaric dignitary alleged to be the correspond
ent of the yellow journal, will be but a tame and silly
production. Here in The Call and in the Herald is
the truth of the most marvelous sea fight in recent
times. It comes promptly in response to popular
eagerness for news of the victory. Every word of it
will be read, and all who read it will find occasion for
rejoicing that so gallant a hero as Admiral Dewey has
had so skillful a writer as Mr. Stickney to report his
deeds to the world.
WAR OND THE PRESIDENCY.
BY the zeal with which a considerable number of
persons have been discussing the advisability
of giving Fitzhugh Lee the Democratic nomi
nation for the Presidency in 1900 the attention of the
country is directed to the possible bearings of the war
upon the Presidential succession.. It is a question
which while at present purely speculative in its na
ture cannot fail to be of general interest.
Every war in which the United States has engaged
has been the means of raising from obscurity some
hero to such eminence and popularity aj to win for
him the highest office in the gift of the people. Out
of the war of 1812 came Andrew Jackson and Wil
liam Henry Harrison. The Mexican War gave us
Taylor and Pierce. The Civil War lifted Grant from
the tanner's shop to the White House, and had much
to do in so advancing the personal fortunes of Hayes,
Garfield, Benjamin Harrison and McKinley as to
obtain the Presidency for them over the heads of
rivals in their own party who were far better known
in the fields of statecraft.
Reasoning from precedent, it is probable the pres
ent war will afford some unknown man the oppor
tunity to gain the esteem of the people to such an
extent that he will be elevated to the high office where
so many other military chieftains have preceded him.
The man to whom this high fortune is to come is as
unaware of what fate has in store for him as are the
rest of his countrymen. He is simply going to battle
to perform his duty to the flag, and his success is to
result from simple patriotism and an.eas}' mastery of
whatever opportunities come in his way.
In all former wars the heroes destined to attain the
Presidency have served in the army. No naval offi
cer however distinguished has ever come within
measurable distance of the White House. This has
been due, of course, to no preference on the part of
the people for the army over the navy, but only be
cause former wars have been fought mainly on land
and therefore the leaders of the land forces have nat
urally and inevitably held the foremost place in the
eyes of the country.
In the present war a different set of conditions will
prevail. The greater battles will be fought on the sea.
When the Spanish fleets have been destroyed the
invasion of Cuba and the capture of Havana will
hardly entail a single battle of any considerable note.
We have, therefore, to face the possibility of a naval
hero as a candidate for the Presidency. An old sea
dog in the White House might stir up a good many
things that are much in need of stirring, and the pop
ular consciousness of that fact would probably gain
votes for him.
It must be borne in mind, however, that the eleva
tion of the war hero to the Presidency does not often
immediately follow the war. Taylor and Grant were
the only generals elected while their laurels wer~ fresh
upon them. Jackson with the elder and younger
Harrison. Pierce. Hayes and the others had to wait.
A similar waiting will in all probability attend the
hero of this conflict. McKinley is entitled to re
election in T9OO, and from the present prospects can
safely count on it.
One German paper thinks that country will be
given the Philippines in return for renouncing her
claim on Samoa. It is hardly probable, however, that
Dewey has been pulling chestnuts out of a rather hot
fire for the benefit of the Kaiser. Uncle Sam is not
bent upon acquiring territory; neither is he getting
it so that a young Emperor shall have more space in
which to do the warlord act.
Apparently the estimate that the Spanish are with
out a sense of humor is correct. If they could recog
nize a joke they would regard themselves as more
laughable than anything Cervantes ever wrote.
If Blanco is really as anxious to leave Havana as
he is reported to be, doubtless Admiral Sampson
would take him aboard and treat him with the ut
most consideration.
A short article from the Governor of the Philip
pines as to his opinion of Yankee naval discipline
would be read with great interest just at this time.
Apparently the only way to defeat a pugilist so that
he will not dispute the decision is to kill him.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 8, 1898.
fISK THE QUESTIONS.
ALTHOUGH Mr. C. P. Huntington has been
under examination before the Railroad Com
mission during the better part of a week it has
not yet occurred to anybody to ask him concerning
the newspaper corruption fund which the Southern
Pacific is supposed to keep on hand at all times.
Much of the information which has been elicited by
the Commissioners is valueless. The questions pro
pounded by La Rue and Hinton have been mouthed
over till everybody is weary o f them. Stanford,
Crocker, Colton, Stubbs, Douty, Towne and every
other man fortunate enough to be connected with
the railroad has dodged or answered them a dozen
times.
As dealers in chestnuts, therefore, La Rue and
Ilinton are achieving great distinction. As investi
gators of cold facts, however, they are showing a
lamentable lack of capacity.
Why do not these gentlemen inquire concerning
that "advertising" contract with the Examiner? For
twenty-two months the Southern Pacific paid the
Mission street faker $iooo a month for keeping the
peace. Had the sheet stayed bought the payments
would have continued for thirty months, which pe
riod covered a political campaign and two Legisla
tures. The Southern Pacific also paid the Examiner
$;000 for publishing Creed Haymond's speech before
the Senate Committee on Pacific Railroads, $5000
for keeping its hands off the Pattison investigation
and $2500 for a horse which Hearst stole from Sen
ator Stanford's stables at Palo Alto. The Senator
said this theft was a '"vicissitude of associated capital,"
but the horse was stolen, and we have reason to be
lieve that the Southern Pacific reimbursed Mr. Stan
ford for it.
We call Commissioner Hinton's attention to the
fact that here is over $36,000 disbursed by Mr. Hun
tington's agents without warrant. Why not ask the
old gentleman about it? We understand he takes
the newspaper contract with him every time he visits
the commission in anticipation of a demand for it.
The document has Hearst's name attached, and, being
an original paper, is admissible in evidence to prove
that Southern Pacific money has been disbursed for
illegitimate purposes. The public is anxious to
learn all about this affair, and if Commissioners La
Rue and Hinton do not extract the facts from Mr.
Huntington while he is on the stand they need not
expect to hear the last of their failure to do their
duty for some time to come.
We have it on reliable authority that Commissioner
La Rue is a candidate for Governor. How are his
prospects going to be promoted by neglecting to ask
the important questions we have suggested? If Hun
tington is allowed to leave the stand without telling
about the Southern Pacific's newspaper corruption
fund there is certain to be a disagreeable political
reckoning hereafter.
PROTECTION IN OREGON.
PURSUANT of an intention to poll the indus
trial establishments of the various States of the
Union for the purpose of obtaining trustworthy
information as to the condition of Amei'can labor
after eight months of protection as contrasted with
its condition during the corresponding period follow
ing the enactment of the Gorman-Wilson tariff, the
American Economist has just compiled and pub
lished a series of reports from Oregon which in an
unmistakable way show that protection has been to
the people of that State a benefit of far-reaching value.
Reports were received from 102 establishments
representing thirty-three departments of industry.
They show that the number of hands employed in
March, 1898, aggregated 1886, as compared with 837
employed in March, 1895. The total wages paid in
March, 1898, amounted to $100,043, against $41,504 in
March, 1895. The average per capita wages for
March of this year were $53 04, while those of the cor
responding period of 1895 were $49 55,
From this showing it will be seen that the gain in
the number of hands employed amounted to 1049, or
125.19 per cent. The increase in total wages
amounted to $58,538 or 141.04 per cent. The advance
in per capita wages amounted to $3 49, or 7.04 per
cent. This is an extraordinary showing for a single
month, and the significance of it becomes greater
when it is remembered that it is made from but 102
establishments out of a commonwealth which re
ported in the census of 1890 upward of 1523 manu
facturing industries. If all the shops and factories of
the State had responded to the poll there can be little
doubt but what the showing made of the benefits of
protection would have been correspondingly greater.
It must be borne in mind, moreover, that in addi
tion to the advance made in the manufacturing in
dustries of Oregon there has been also a marked im
provement in the condition of the fanners. The
values of farm lands and farm stock have risen, and
with the increase of work and wages in the cities there
has resulted a better home market for all sorts of
farm products.
The publication of these papers is timely and op
portune to the campaign now under way in Oregon.
They constitute one of the best campaign documents
that can be circulated. The howls of the calamity
orators can avail nothing against the prosperous
showing made by the mills and factories. Protection
has produced results which fully justify it as a national
policy.
With this splendid record of industrial expansion,
and with an equally favorable showing for the opera
tion of the gold standard, there ought to be an over
whelming Republican victory in Oregon at the June
elections. Surely no considerable number of voters
in the State -would willingly return to the conditions
of free trade and disaster of 1894. or vote in favor of
getting payment for their crops and their wages in
silver instead of gold.
According to a dispatch from New Guinea four
teen prisoners escaped jail and dined upon eighteen
full-grown villagers. The ability of some correspon
dents in the direction of lying is remarkable, or else
the New Guinea appetite approaches the abnormal.
It is difficult to believe that even prisoners, kept prob
ably on a scant diet, would be able to celebrate liberty
by swallowing one and two-sevenths of a man apiece.
Richard Harding Davis has sent some interesting
news from the front, but when he wrote that the
Spanish were without honor he came dangerously
near sending something that was not news.
Of course merely by being a relative 'i Weyler
Colonel de Cortijo is not guilty of a capital offense,
but he must excuse us if we regard him with sus

Of course the usual dispute as to Californian ap
pointments is in progress in Washington, and the
usual result is to be expected.
One way for French vessels to avoid being cap
tured would be to refrain from the attempt to run the

WITH ENTIRE FRANKNESS.
It is -with regret I learn that a wor

scription to the paper which prints my
stuff, and has done so because of some
recent remarks of mine about Emma
Goldman. I trust, however, that he Is
not g-overned by the idea that his act
is to be regarded as a calamity, for, in
deed, he is the only sufferer. There
are more logical methods of seeking
revenge. Some people desirous of ex
pressing disapprobation send me po

A correspondent asks me to express
myself as to the right of the telephone
company to make him drop a nickel
in the slot before giving him the infor
mation that he cannot get the number
he wants. Ever ready to oblige, lam
baffled by this request. The company
has no such right; it simply assumes
that it has. It has obtained from me
more than one small coin by its sure
thing game. Ido not know what can
be done about it, for to smash the box
with a club would be regarded as an
extreme measure, and subject the
smasher to inconvenience, although
morally, the use of the club would often
be wholly Justifiable. The matter has
heretofore been called to the attention
of the police, but they have been too
busy in not suppressing poolrooms to
take any action. The telephone gen
tlemen seem to have what might crude
ly be termed the bulge on us here, but
in the last days, when the heavens shall
be rolled up as a scroll, i think they
will squirm mightily as the recording

It seems to me that William Jennings

Some people did not like his campaign

dered will have to be accepted. But
when some fool friends of Bryan ap

for it, and told that the ranks are open
if he wants to serve his country. And
if he were to enlist as a private the
very papers now advising him to do
so would howl at the act as new evi
dence that Bryan is a demagogue.

Years ago four men united in a plan
to build a railroad across the
continent. It was a big, bold
scheme. They had a little mon
ey, which they devoted to the pro
ject. The history of their undertaking
is too familiar to need recital. What
ever may have been their ambitions,
honest ambitions, perhaps, at the start,
they were more than realized. The
four became immensely rich. Three of
them have died, leaving fortunes little
less than stupendous. The fourth sur
vives, his hoard vast beyond calcula
tion. It is to be regretted that the
giant enterprise which Huntington, in
a large measure, has directed from the
first, should have been tainted by fraud,
that scandal should have attended its
progress, been a part of its history,
and seem to cloud its future. For
Huntington is a great man. In intel
lect as in physique he towers above his
fellows. At the age of four score his
mind is clear and keen. He knows the
story of the Southern Pacific as no one
else is destined ever to know it. There
are chapters he will never reveal, and
attempts to make him do so represent
wasted effort and lost time. I saw him
last week before the Railroad Commis
sioners undergoing what they were
confident was an examination. It was
nothing of the kind. Mr. Huntington
was many times more than a match
for the Commissioners. He played with
them, wrapped them about his finger,
made them seem his pitiful puppets.
An answer to such questions as they
asked would have been of no value, but
he would not even answer these. He
affably talked all around a point, but
at last evaded it. He professed the ut
most willingness to tell everything, and
told nothing. They stood in awe of
him. He was the living representative
of millions; he was railways, steam
ships, shipyards, gold. Not a man in
the lot but knew Huntington was guilty
of evasion. I say "evasion" because
myself somewhat in awe of his im
pressive personality, and checked by
the respect due old age. But nobody,
even by insinuation, expressed the be
lief that when Huntington declared
himself to have acquired nothing but
poverty by his association with Paci
fic roads, he spoke aught but truth.
Thus the examination became a farce.
The gentlemen composing- the commis
sion should remember that their wit
ness has been on the stand before. The
Pattison committee tried in vain to get
him to tell how he and his partners
had played a confidence game and won
the stake. They sought to cajole or
trap him into committing himself, but
failed utterly. Something of the bound
less iniquity of the Huntington meth
ods they did, indeed, lay bare, but
aside from a cumbersome pile of re
ports, nothing came of it. Yet Patti
son was a lawyer of acute mentality,
long experience, skilled in the art of
cross-questioning, hostile to the wit
ness. At that time there were in ex
istence many records since destroyed,
correspondence long ago committed to
the flames, intimates of Huntington,
now silent in their graves. All the se
crets they knew are locked in his
breast. There they are safe. Senator
Morgan put Huntington through a
course of Queries. He is an eminent
lawyer, was anxious to learn the truth..
By HENRY JAMES.
He, too, failed. Whatever may have
been the impression Morgan received,
it did not shake Huntington, abate his
power, lessen his standing. The man
is simply beyond the reach of law. He
can defy the Government itself. Courts
and Legislatures he can buy; journals
of some sort, corrupt; individuals, make
his own for a price. And this little
commission of doubtful authority, of
untrained personnel, assumes that it
can make Huntington onen the sealed
pages of his life. For it to delve into
the r"^ + ant past is mere foolishness.
Such accounting as Huntington may
give will be given before a higher tri
bunal than the world knows. But the
commission might reasonably ask him
if he had a $30,000 contract with the
Examiner; if he paid that paper $7000
for the printing of a certain speech;
if the figure for its judicious forbear
ance was ever set at $5000 and paid.
These are specific and recent things.
He might think it no harm to tell
about them. But as to the corruption
which has crystallized into an enorm
ous corporation, himself its head and
front, Huntington will be dumb to the
end of his time; else charm the listen
ing ear with a flood of reminiscence
and prophecy, or exalt his achievement
until the hearers yield to hypnotic in
fluence, and the session adjourns, no
whit having been added to the sum of
human knowledge.

In good faith somebody has asked
me as to the wisdom of attending a
school of journalism. Never having
attended a school having this title, I
am at loss how to reply. Still, my ad
vice would be to attend something else.
Among working newspaper people, the
graduate of a school of journalism
would be regarded as a joke, and his
first important detail would be the un
learning of all he had absorbed during
his course, unless the mere ability to
write correct English. The only place
to be relied upon for learning the news
paper business is in a newspaper of
fice. There some of us have studied
it for years, and are free to admit that
we do not know it all.
Never but once have I had the pleas
ure of seeing the Rev. Edwards Davis
of Oakland. On that occasion his shiny
hat had been joggled over one ear, his
abundant hair was askew, and the fear
in his face was not the fear of the
Lord. He was trembling lest a lot of
reporters give him a licking, as he had
used his garb to cut into their busi
ness. In other words, he had employed
the character of preacher so as to be
enabled to obtain an interview from a
man, since suddenly dead, who de
clined to talk to newspaper representa
tives. I thought then the Davis feet
were in the downward path which lead
eth to the grand bounce, and time has
proved the correctness of the theory.
The gentleman is out of a job. No
clamor to have him enter another pul
pit fills the land. The stage is crowded.
The sorrowful possibility presents It
self that Davis may have to go to
work.

It is happily the fact that I have the
privilege, subject to abrupt curtail
ment, of expressing in this column
opinions which are not indorsed by the
edit,or, and are directly counter to edi
torial policy. This relieves me, and
does nobody any harm. I think the
United States has too long followed the

business within lines so restricted that
the aggressions of nations openly hog
gish, have swept up to our very doors.
So we have had to take the Philippines,
so we will take Cuba, and, perhaps,

can be no advantage save to keep
somebody else from taking it. If we

the islands without owning them. I
hope sincerely that the' Stars and
Stripes will float permanently over the
Philippines. The mongrel people down
there need to be governed by a strong
hand, and I have more confidence in
the hand of Uncle Sam than in that
of the war-lording Kaiser. As to Cuba,
it Is certain to be ours. It will be
turned over to the Cubans until they
shall have demonstrated their large in
capacity to take care of it. If by
miracle they prove themselves capable,
then they can have their little old
island and welcome. But the proba

It Is impossible not to have an ad
miration for Theodore Roosevelt. He
seems to be an American all through.
He is ready to fight at the drop of
the hat, and Is always on the lookout
for a hat precariously balanced. If his
"rough riders" do not do good work
I shall be greatly mistaken. True,
there are many among them who habit
ually wear kid gloves while follow in*
the pursuits of peace, but the chances
are they will leave these behind.
Roosevelt has been in the West. He
knows the cowboys, and the bucking
bronco is no novelty to him. He has
acquired a becoming and consistent
hatred for the Spanish, and they will
learn to dislike him.

An evening paper remarks that at
present there is a fashion of blaming
the races every time a yâÂ»* man
turns out to be a thief. There certain
ly is such a fashion, but as the blame
is r'ghtly placed in nineteen cases out
of twenty, the fashion itself cannot be
viewed as a mere fad.
It is good to turn from contemplation
of the horrors of war to the calm and
soothing pages of the Bowling Green
Times, published in Pike County, Mis
souri. What beneficent Providence sent
this my way, I know not, yet I am
grateful to it. I shall attempt no
analytical treatment of the Pike County
product, but lay some of its gems be
fore readers who do not have the privi
lege of possessing a copy. There are
items, personal, serious and jocular.
Strangely enough, the jocuiar ones are
serious and the serious ones cause glad
some smiles. Here are samples:
Jake Moore gave a fencing Tuesday.
Jake Is a prosperous farmer, and we wel
come him into our midst.
Some four or five of the young members
of the Peno church have been walking
disorderly, and were excluded at the last
meeting of the church.
We understand there was quite a shoot
ing scrape at Curryville last week. We
did not learn the particulars.
Mrs. William Scott is on the mend
again.
pur town should feel proud for having
in its limits such a good Christian lady
as Mrs. Rooker.
Thpn is told of the sensation caused
by some wicked young men who placed
a bent pin so that the pastor, at a sol
emn moment, sat down upon the same.
There is a column account of a social
function, which event had been marked
by "Dainty ham sandwiches and ice
cream which would melt in your
mouth." It is to be observed by the
closing: paragraphs of the account that
the function was really a recherche af
fair, as note:
As the last happy guest departed.thank
ing the hostess for such a delightful even
ing, the front doors shut to with a re
sounding' clang, and the floating echoes
whispered through the now deserted de
partments.
Dark grow the shadows, and quenched is
the fire,
Sound fades into silence, all footsteps re
tire.
Xo voice in the chambers, no sound in the
hall,
Sleep and oblivion reign over all.
Then there is a charming page de
voted to personal mention. From this
I learn that " Miss Carrie White is
chilling." The information was puz
zling at first. It did not appear that
the morose disposition of Miss White
was any proper subject for comment.
But having captured a genuine Missou
rian, he made clear to me that the lady
was merely undergoing a preliminary
tussle with fever and ague. There is
another Miss White, who, instead of
chilling, is evidently thrilling. She has
contributed a poem on the loss of the
Maine, the last stanza of it being good
enough for an Examiner war bulletin,
in proof of which I present it:
Ah! well! God will lift the curtain
On the resurrection morn,
And the one who did this playful act
Will be looked upon with scorn.
From poetry to pork is but a step,
and one may glide from Macie's â I for
got to say her other name was Macie â
from Macie's impassioned lines to Ham
lett's mutilated and murdered pig, al
most with a sense of relief. I will
close with the editor's scathing ar
raignment:
Some person with a devilish spirit shot
a hog belonging to James Hamlett a few
days ago. These demons who have been
doing these devilish things to innocent
animals will soon be found, and they
should meet the same death that these
animals do.
Which strikes me as a fair proposi
tion.

INDUSTRIAL GROWTH.
The industrial and commercial growth
of the United States of late years has be
come much more symmetrical. On the Pa
cific Coast great strides have been made,
and development is going steadily for
ward on broader lines. The same thing
is true of the South. The establishment
of an enormous iron Industry and the
movement of export trade toward Gulf
ports are two important pointers show
ing the trend of advancement. â Philadel

Gossip That Will Prove Interesting
to Those Concerned Sn the
State Political Pie.
Politics brings strange bedfellows. Be
cause of this it now appears that the j
Fouthern portion of the State will be i
asked to support a Los Angeles Republi
can in the race for the nomination for I
Governor. The man is Harry Gage.
Gage would like to succeed Stephen M.
"White as United States Senator, and dur
ing- the past two months has devoted his |
best endeavors toward achieving that end.
Being a man cf rare good sense and judg
ment, he has at last come to a realization
of the fact that he is doubly unfortunate ,
in having so strong a rival as R. X. Bulla j
and so unpopular a friend and supporter :
as Harrison Gray Otis, the warrior jour- i
nalist who directs the destinies of the |
Los Angeles Times. Finding himself be
tween the devil and the deep sea, as it
â were. Gage is said to have done the only
thing left for him to doâ bidden a regret
ful adieu to his hopes for a Senatorial
toga and severed diplomatic relations
â¢with the patriotic but unpopular Otis.
As is well known, Otis is blasting the j
gubernatorial aspirations of Attorney-
General Fitzgerald by supporting, them, i
so what could be more natural than for J
Gago to take advantage of the situation t
to make use of his own personal popular- ,
ity by presenting himself as a candidate
for the place at the head of the ticket. |
Better, he thinks, to die by the ballots |
of his political adversaries than to be â¢
, bowled over by the recoil of his own ar
tilU-ryâ assuming, for the sake of tne !
metaphor, that Otis is any kind of a gun,
big or little. :V;;: V ;; ,
If it be true that Gage has, by a single
act parted company with his Senatorial
aspirations and his uninfluential friend,
the fact adds a new complication to the
situation south or the Tehaehapi line.
With Gage out of the running the chances
of U. S. Grant Jr. are very materially
increased^ and it may be i I Limed that
those of Bulla are lessened. Bulla's
strength is conceded even by his oppo
nents in his own party. His record as a
public servant is unassailable, and so far
as known the only charge his enemies
have alleged against him is that he was
born in Canada. It turns out, however,
that he was born in the State of Indiana,
and that he traces his lineage through
good American ancestors back to Revolu
tionary times.
. With Grant the case is different. No
one has had the temerity to question his
nativity] but there are many who have
not hesitated to say that in aspiring to
Senatorial honors he hopes for success
by trading on the name of his illustrous
father. While his detractors have been
enjoying a little cheap amusement at his
expense the young man has been saying
nothing, nough it now develops that he
has sawed considerable political wood.
He has enlisted the sympathy and sup
port of his mother, Mrs. Julia D. Grant,
and she in turn has solicited the moral
as well as the active support of old fam
ily friends, who are powerful in the coun
cils of the party, in furthering the am
bition of her son. It is said that Sena
tors Lodge, Fairbanks and Elkins, Chaun
cey â¢ pew and others have pledged them
selves to support young Grant's cause,
and that they have secured the services
of R. C. Kerans, an astute politician of
St. Louis, as director in chief of their
protege's campaign. Milton J. Green of
Oakland occupies the position of local
manager. He has been touring the State
with his principal for several weeks past:
The name of ex-Governor Mark ham has
Tieen mentioned as a senatorial possibility,
Ibut it is not likely that his "magnetic
hand and hypnotic tongue" will ever
again figure in a political campaign in
this State. It is related of Markham that j
he possesses, the faculty of making the
person with whom he may happen to be
conversing believe that he places implicit
trust in no one but Markham, the person
with whom he is talking and God. The !
order in which the members of the trinity
are named cannot be otherwise than flat
tering to the listener.
A majority of the voters -who helped tn
elect George L. Arnold of Los Angeles to
a position on the Board of Equalization
from the Fourth District had hoped that
he would be content with the unenviable
record he has made and that at the ex
piration of his term of office he would be
willing to retire, to the comparative se
clusion of private life for all time to

come. In this they are doomed to disap
pointment. Arnold has announced him
self as a candidate for renomination, and
will rally to his support ail of the cor
poration Influences whose interests he
has so assiduously cared for during his
term of office. The Southern Pacific Com
pany's politica.l bureau will no doubt lend
him moral and material support, after the
manner of its kind, but it will take a fine
hand and a long sack to make the voters
of the district forget or forgive the fact
that Arnold has persistently acted as the
subservient tool of the corporation. He
is besides a straggler from the violated
fold of Shepherd Hervey Llndsey. a fact
that tends to strengthen his general un
popularity.
II there were any real doubt as to the
result of Arnold's candidacy It would be
set at rest by a knowledge of the fact
that Frank Matttson of Santa Cruz i 3 in
the field for the Board of Equalization
nomination from the Fourth District. He is
the present Assessor of Santa Cruz Coun
ty and is well known from one end of the
State to the other as a man of sterling
worth and Integrity. He is also one of
the most popular and best-known mem
bers of the order of Native Sons of the
Golden West, and has for many years
held a high place in the councils of the
order. His candidacy will be a popular
L. C. Morehouse of Alameda County
will be a candidate for re-election as a
member of the Board of Equalization. As
\.t there has been no one to come for
ward to oppose him. Charles Schirmor
of Vacavllle will be a candidate for the
place now held by R. H. Beamer. Beamer
is also a candidate for re-election, and as
both men are popular in the district the
race between them may prove to be of
more than ordinary interest.
E. Dinke>spiel of Suisun, editor of the
Solano Republican, is seeking the posi
tion of coiner in the San Francisco mint.
In the meantime he enjoys the distinction
of being the "political boss of Solano
County," a position that is not wholly
without its rewards, a.s it places Dinkel
spiel In a position to render material aid
to his partner, Ben Rush, who wants to
be re-elected to the office of Sheriff of
the county. Dinkelspiel, like Mattisgn,
is a popular Native Son. a fact that will
not prove a hindrance to nis quest for a
fat Federal job.
It is nothing to the detriment of a man
to wish to fight for his country. In fact,
such a sentiment is very much to his
credit. But it is none the less interesting
to note the unanimity with which a num
ber of California's great men are squaring
their shoulders for the longed-for touch
of the epaulets of a brigadier general of
volunteers. As but one of them can be
accommodated it is pleasing to think that
the others, robbed of a legitimate desire.
will still prove true to their patriotic feel
uid enlist as privates. If a man
wants to fight for his country it does not
matter much, after all. what kind of a
uniform he wears. To be sure, there is a
wide difference between the 85000 a year
of a brigadier and the $13
a month pittance of a private: but then
true patriotism is not measured by dol
lars and cents.
The list of eligibles for the high honor
and the epauletsâ and the salaryâbe
gins with Governor Budd and goes on
down â  if names not unknown to
local fame until the eye grows weary and

General John H. Dickinson would like to

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 8, 1898.
HIS GOLDEN JUBILEE.
Father De Masini to Celebrate the Fiftieth Anniversary
of His Priesthood,
Rev. Telephorus de Masini, a priest of the Jesuit community In this city,
will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary or golden jubilee of his priesthood
this morning at St. Ignatius Church with solemn ceremony. This will mark
the first time in the history of the church where a priest of this order has
lived a member of and worked in it for fifty years and stepped over the
half-century mark with a firmness that forebodes at least a decade of con
tinued life to crown the labors of his life work and reflect a lasting mem
ory on his church, in whose interests and glory he has so fervently worke-i
and sa< rlflced his being and his Hie to perpetuate the name of the Savior.
Preparations have been actively in progress for the last week in the church
in anticipation of the event, and the clergy have spared no effort in arrang
ing a cerempny that will record a memorable epoch in the life of the aged
prelate and an event long to be remembered in the layman mind.
Solemn high mass will be celebrated at 10:30 o'clock by Father de Ma
sini in person, assisted by the clergy of St. Ignatius Church. Alary's grand
mass has been selected forÂ»rendition by an augmented choir of more than
fifty voices, which has been specially engaged and trained for the occasion.
In the evening, commencing at 7:30 o'clock, solemn high vespers, followed
by benediction, will be observed, the sermon at vespers to be delivered by-
Father Woods.
The interior of the church will present a beautiful picture of electric
light effects and magnificent decoration. The high altar will be adorned
with innumerable and myriads of flickering lights and golden candelabra
entwined, in which will be delicate streamers of smiinx. surrounded with
Bermuda lilies and artificial flowers. Directly over the altar railing will be
suspended a number of swinging candelabra, which as they hang pendant
Will form a complete semicircle of light.
Invitations to the ceremony have been extended to the pastors of nearly
every church in the city, and will be accepted without exception.
At 1 o'clock in the afternoon, immediately after the ceremony of mass.
a dinner will be served in the parochial residence adjoining, being tendered
to Father de Masini by the priests of St. Ignatius Church.
I>ater in the day. at 3 o'clock, the members of the Young Ladies' So
dality, under the direction of Father Calzia, will hold a reception in the Col
lege Hall, which will be followed by another of the same character the
following afternoon by the students of the college. At the reception on
Monday Archbishop Riordan will deliver an address, as will also a number
of prominent prelates of the secular e'ergy.
The life and career of Father de Masini present an interesting picture of
devotion and self-sacrifice to God, which, grounded as it is on a foundation
of sincerity, outlived persecution and finally triumphed over every ob
stacle that was thrown in the pathway of life that the venerable old man
had chosen from his earliest boyhood days.
He was born in Italy on the 11th of May, 1*23. and at the age of 16 years
entered the Catholic seminary of his native city, where he studied dili
gently for many years. After these years of close application to study he
left the college, as is customary in the Jesuit order, and taught for several
months in a parochial school.
Upon his return to the college, after receiving a thorough experience In
teaching, he again took up his studies, which he was compelled soon after
to temporarily abandon and retire into France, on account of the political
disturbances of 1848 in Rome. When quiet had been restored he again re
turned and compli ted his theological course. He had been engaged, after
leaving college, for some years in teaching belles lettres in the province of
Venice, when the invasion of Italy by Napoleon again forced him to set
out for France in IS6L In 1564 he arrived in Canada, where he discharged
the duties of a professor for four years, and in IS6S he set out for San Fran
cisco, where he arrived in the month of October of that year.
Upon his arrival in this 'city he joined the Society of Jesus in the old St.
Ignatius College on Market street, which formerly occupied the present site
of the Emporium building. He remained in this city until ISS7, when he
left here to accept the professorship of philosophy In the Santa Clara Col
lege and at the same time the ministry of the Catholic Church at Moun
tain View (Santa Clara).
He held the professorship of the college until July, 1594, when he was re
called to again resume his duties in this city.
From this time he has continually remained here, being employed in
teaching moral philosophy and modern languages in the new college on
Grove street. In addition to a thorough knowledge of moral philosophy,
he is an accomplished linguist, speaking French and other languages with
the fluency of a native.
GEORGE MONNIER
IS DULY MARRIED
Judge Hebbard Refuses to
Set Aside a Marriage
. Ceremony.
Male Child of Eighteen May Marry
Without Asking His Father*
Consent.
Mrs Violet T. Monnler has Just won an
Important suit against George Monnier,
guardian for his son, George H. Monnier
Senior Monnler, who Is quite wealthy, did
not like the marriage of his son. His
son's wife is a handsome young womar of
good character and education, but she
had no money in comparison with the
funds of the Monniers, and the guardian
of his son sought to annul the marriage.
He failed. , . ,
The marriage of the son took place In
March 1897. Young Monnier was soon
Induced by his father to leave his wife.
She was served with the papers in Jan
uary of this year, the husband being In
Germany. The grounds of the suit were
that the son was not quite 19 years of
ace and that he could not legally marry
without the consent of his parents.
Judge Highton was attorney for Mrs.
Monnior. He demurred to the petition on
the ground that any male child over 18
years of age may consent to his own mar
riage without any one rise's consent, the
age of 21 being the legal age for other
purposes. Judge Hebbard, who tried the
case directed that the action be dis
missed on the ground that the boy was
old enough to marry.
Another point in the case is that young
Monnier swore that he was 21 years of
age in order to get his marriage license.
He is therefore liable to prosecution for
Derjurv which is a peniter.tftiry offense.
There is a beautiful babe four months
old awaiting the return of its legal father.
The decision of Judge Hebbard fixes the
status of Mrs. Monnier as the legal wife
of George Monnier. As there is no trouble
between himself and his wife he will
probably return to her some day before
long arid become acquainted with his
child.
Police Gatling Gun.
Captain Spillane, Sergeant Perrln and
six stalwart policemen attracted quite a
crowd yesterday afternoon as they march

streets dragging a Gatling gun after
them. The gun was deposited In the as
sembly room of the Southern district at

on how to handle the gun in times of
emergency. Chief Lees said that the gun
had been secured through the ini.uence of
Adjutant General Barrett.
STAG PARTY IN THE PARK.
A Jolly Time for Jolly Fellows Out
at Leonhardt's Casino.
The private stag party given at the
I-ieonhardt Casino in Golden Gate Park
last evening was an event long to be re
membered by the jolly good fellows who
attended.
The merry old stag waltz, the two step
and the five were danced as merrily as if
the fairer sex was unknown, and the
fancy dances and that dance of twists
seen so often by travelers in the far East,
were performed to a perfection seldom
seen.
Music and the echoing sounds of laugh
ter and merriment from the picturesque
resort in the depths of the solitude of the
south drive at such an unseemly hour of
the night had the effect of startling the
passer-by and encouraging h!m to double
his speed in the opposite direction to get
beyond hearing distance of the mysteri
ous sounds, as the surrounding beauty of
the park when disturbed by anything out
of the ordinary has the effect of produc
ing a peculiar influence on the imagina
tion, which Is often anything but con
genial to comfort in a lonely place.
There were jolly fellows galore in the
brilliantly lighted dining room of the hos
telry, and the stag ended in a whirl of
pleasureâ all being happy and extremely
jolly.
Milling Men at War.

WILL COMPETE
FOR A TROPHY
League of the Cross Ca
dets Will' Give a Com
petitive Drill.
To Constitute the Last Contest
for the Montgomery
Medal.
A Glimpse of the Organization and
Its Fitness for Active
Servioo.
The third and last competitive drill for
the Montgomery trophy wH be held by
the League of the Cross Cadets Tuesday
evening, May 24. and is to decide whether
Company G is entitled to the permanent
possession of the magnificent prize.
Company G is composed of young men
of St. Brigid's parish, who have thus far
succeeded in defeating every rival com
pany in the league for the past two years
as the best-drilled cadets of the entire
organization.
The battle that will be fought this year
for the coveted prize will, it is thought,
rival all preceding attempts to wrest the
Jealously guarded medal from the St.
Brigid boys by the other companies of
the league. To prevent the company from
again carrying off the laurels of the con
test, preparatory drilling has already
begun, and if hard labor in drilling and
the study of tactics count for success,
Company G will have to look to its men,
as every member of the league is deter
mined that it shall not receive the final
decision.
The declaration of war has had its ef
fect upon the Cadets of the Cross, and, in
addition to showing Company G that they
know how to pick up one foot after the
other with as much dexterity and science
as they, they want to also show the pub
lic and the army as a body of soldiers
they are capable of going to war and
shouldering a musket as well as the best
of the regulars who have gone to Cuba
to flaunt the protecting stars and stripes
over the oppressed inhabitants of the un
happy isle.
At the conclusion of the competitive
drill, which will constitute the leading
and most interesting part of the pro
gramme of the evening, several fancy
drills and exhibitions of skiLi in the manip
ulation of the saber will be given by the
entire company. The league band, com
posed entirely of picked musicians from
the membership rollâ young men who
have earned tne well-deserved merit of
constituting one of the best organizations
of its kind in the cityâ will execute all
the marches and furnish all the music
necessary for the contest and the amuse
ment of the spectators, under the direc
torship of Professor Walton.
Judgment will be passed upon the com
peting teams, and the medal awarded to
the best-drilled and most successful com
pany by three officers of the regular army
stationed at the Presidio.
The five best out or' the following named
companies will contest for the trophy,
and are to be selected on the Sunday af
ternoon preceding the 24th of May:
Company A â Captain, Frank S. Drady; first
lieutenant, Robert Steele; second lieutenant,

LUMPY GOING
FOR TALENT
A Deluge of Despised
Outsiders in Front at
Oakland.
Satsuma Beaten Easily in the
Handicap by Crom
well.
Malay Ran a Clever Raceâ Zarro
Turned UpWlnnep â Ann Page the
Only Favorite to Earn Brackets.
The big Saturday crowd that attended
the races at Oakland track yesterday
must have thought they had bumped
up against a Spanish flotilla, for they
received a terrific raking and were,
"longsh ->tted" all to pieces. Even the
\vi.Â«" 'leads, who held a caucus and de
cided that Satsuma ought to win the
mile and a sixteenth handicap, went
astray. Hurly Burly, May W and
Judge Denny were conveniently
scratched and the big money poured
into the books on Satsuma at even
money, though the chestnut horse was
delegated to carry 121 pounds. Crom
well, an eighty-eight pounder, with
Clawson on his back, proved the joker
in the deck, for he made a runaway
race of it and beat the favorite in a
gallop in the fast time of 1:47V 4 .
The menu contained many other lus
cious delicacies, the books fortunately
escaping any big commissions on
them, and El Morn was a tart one
backed to some extent by the left
handed players at odds of 12 and 15 to
1, and Zarro, an S to 1 chance, could
â claim a slight following, but the major
portion of the crowd drew blanks.
When it was all over the two-year-old
Ann Page had the honor of being the
only winning favorite.
The latter filly was an even money
choice for the opening four furlong
scramble and justified the confidence
reposed in her by winning all the way.
The Fretter, ridden by Tompkin.s for
the first time showed to some advan
by taking the place from Rrito
martis, at the enticing odds of 30 to 1.
Polka, the second choice, seems to be
of little account.
The Burns & Waterhouse stable fur
nished the favorite in the six furlong
dash that followed, and an extremely
bad one. It was Colonel Dan, and dur
ing his vacation some one must have
ined his speed, for he chopped it
up badly and was unplaced even with
little Meany on his back. In a long
drawn out finish Kid McNichols, astride
El Moro, got the verdict from Formella,
with Clawson up. by a nose.
The Burns & Waterhnuse stable had
another favorite bowled over in thÂ«
four and a half furlong scramble for
members of the two-year-old division.
Banewor, the fast Stromboli filly, was
Fent over to thf post an 8 to 5 chance
and in a mild drive from the paddock
was led out nearly two lengths by
Bookmaker Johnny Humphrey's brown
colt, Malay, against which 5 to 1 waa
laid. E. Come, the Montana delegate,
was a close third.

TRACK NOTES.
Joe Murphy, -who has presided in the
stand both at Oakland and Ingleside
tracks the past season, departed for the
East last evening, accompanied by his
family. Judge Murphy will again preside
in the stand at Oakland next winter, but
it is more than likely that Captain Rees
will resume his old position at Ingleside
when next that track throws open Us
gates.
Barney Schi-eiber and his crew also left
for St. Louis last evening. Barney did
not put in a very prosperous season of It
here, but expects to even up things in the
Eastern country the coming summer.
Marsh Redon must have read the stars
and been aware that Colonel Dan was in
poor condition, for he nearly got becalmed
taking the money at 3 to 5. It is said the
colt was but recently nerved and showed
signs of lameness going to the post.
When Johhnny Humphreys paid $300 for
Malay he evidently got quite a bargain.
'â¢Frisco" Lind has the youngster in
splendid condition and he appears to be
ab.e to run with any of them.
The saddlegirths on Ojai loosened,
which accounted for the rather indiffer
ent finish put up by Ruiz at the end. But
for this unforeseen happening there might
have been a different tale to record.
Polish was heavily backed and exten
sively touted to win the mile selling run.
Cash Sloan rode him to excellent advan
tage, but the colt was evidently a trifle
short. He stopped the last sixteenth.
It was one of the good days that Del
Paso experiences, and had the big brown
horse not been cut off after passing the
paddock his number would just about
have been hung out.
THROWN IN A
PADDED CELL
Mrs. Heinrich Charged With
Insanity by Her Hus
band.
Convinced That She Is Mentally
Sound Dr. Lustig Ordered
Her Released.
Mrs. Dorita Heinrich, the wife of Bruno
Helnrieh, who is connected with the Cal
ifornia Electrical Works, was arrested
yesterday afternoon on complaint of her
husband for insanity. The unfortunate
woman was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital, where she was placed in a padded
cell. As she appeared perfectly rational
the doctors became suspicious and started
an investigation.
They learned that Heinrich had pro
cured the warrant for his wife's arrest,
alleging- that she was insane and likely to
kill herself. Pie also claimed that she
was in the habit of writing farewell let
ters to him announcing her intention of
doing away with herself. Fearing that she
would commit suicide Heinrich claims
that he decided to have his wife arrested
for insanity in the hope that she would
regain her mental equilibrium while con
fined in some institution for the insane.
Convinced that the unfortunate woman
was not insane, the doctors at the hos
pital summoned James Daley, secretary
of the Commissioners of Lunacy, and con
cluding that the woman was mentally
sound, Daley sent for Dr. Lustig, one of
the Commissioners of Insanity. The doc
tor had aji extended consultation with
Mrs. Heinrich. after whi<"-h he immediate
ly ordered her discharged.
" "She is not mentally deranged," re
marked the doctor. "Why her husband
bad her arreste* on that charge is beyond
my comprehension. I intend to see that
a "thorough investigation is made, and
have requested Mrs. Heinrich to be pres
ent at the next meeting of the Commis
sioners."
Mrs. Heinrich makes some damaging
charges against her husband, which she
claims she can substantiate.
Sentence Passed on Criminals.
Joseph King, convicted of burglary, was
sentenced by Judge Cook yesterday to
five years' Imprisonment at San Quentln.
John Murphy find Frederick Hutchings,
convicted of similar offenses, were sen
tenced to three years' and one year's im
meni respectively.
William J. Clark, convicted of robbery.
was sentenced by Judge Borden to seven
years' imprisonment at Folsom, and Wil
liam Miller, convicted of criminal. IlbN.
was sentenced to pay a fine of $200 or be
imprisoned in the County Jail for 100
days.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 8, 1898.
ENTRIES WILL
CLOSE TO-DAY

Show Enthusiasts Must
Use All Dispatch.
to Date the Number of Dogs
on the List Exceeds That
of Last Year.
Up
Walter Hobart's Ksnnel of Fox
hounds Will Again Bo a Fea
ture of the Exhibit.
Among the cajiines entered for the
coming bench show are some of the
most prominent dogs in the State. Miss
Ida A. Killey's Kokko is considered
the most perfect specimen of the Jap
anese spaniel extant on this coast.
Mrs. J. P. Norman's Lola is almost
BENCH SHOW FAVORITES.
too -well known to require comment.
She has taken more prizes than any
other bitch of the breed. She is the
champion mastiff brood bitch, arid her
pups, Juan, Hebe and Beau Monterey,
have equaled her prize-winning abili
ties. The last named won everything
at San Jose last month except the
prize for the best mastiff, which fell to
his dam, Lola.
The hour for the closing of the en
tries to the San Francisco bench show
is near. After midnig-ht of to-day no
entries will be accepted unless the
postmark shows that they were mailed
before that hour. Delay will be fatal.
The rule will be rigidly enforced.
No pedigree is required to- show a
dog. The moment that the animal en
ters the ring and stands before the
judge his own merits alone will con
duce to his becoming a prize-winner;
his ancestry will cut no figure. Better
a good dog without a pedigree than a
poor dog with one.
The office of the San Francisco Ken
nel Club at 224 Montgomery street will
be open all day until midnight, and
Mr. Sinclair will be on hand to receive
the entries.
Up to date the number of entries re
ceived exceeds that of last year, and if
the present rate continues the total
will be largely in excess of even that
record-breaker.
All is now harmonious in the kennel
world, and every fancier of the noble
dog seems to be striving hard to make
this show a grand success.
Walter Hobarts kennel of English
foxhounds will again be a feature of
the show this year.

Exceptionally good coursing was wit
nessed yesterday afternoon at Union
Coursing Park. The hares are now well
acquainted with the escapes, and they
make a grand effort to reach the point
of safety.
Of the very excellent courses that were
watched with keen interest by the pa-
KEKKO and LOLA, Fine Specimens of Japanese

trens of the leash, there were three or
four runs that a lover of the sport would
travel quite a distance to see. The judg

isfaction
The dogs which sold favorites did not
have it all their own way yesterday.
Moore's Prescription defeated the favor
ite. Mystery, but the upsetting of Jester
by Chiquita, a 1 to 9 shut, knocked the
starch out of the sports who are sup
posed to know the number of hairs in a
greyhound's tail,
Another upset to the talent arrived
when L. S. Conley, a 1 to 2 shot, lowered
the colors of Alameda. Then came a
crusher when Skylight, a 1 to 6 shot, dis
posed of Rorklin Belle. Susie, the once
fast little bitch, ran stiff yesterday, and
was easily beiiten by Mercy May. Wad
Shot, a doj? that is coming to the front
very fast, got a flag on O'Grady.
In the last race of the day Pastime eas

AT INGLESIDE.
A fair crowd attended the dog races at
the Ingleside Coursing Park yesterday
afternoon. With but one or. two excep
tions the talent took the money. Obediah,
the short end in a 2 to 1 shot, won from
Minerva. A tip was out that Soubrette
would win the puppy stake, but how
false it was was easily proved in the race
with White Wings. At first Soubrette
ran a no-go with White Wings, but in
the second race White Wings had it all
her own way. Crosspatch won from
Lass o' Gowrie, a 5 to 2 shot.

OPPOSED TO THE CHARTER.
Continental League Sets Forth the
Beasons Why It Should Be
Defeated.
At a meeting of the executive committee
of the Continental League held last night
the following resolutions were adopted:
A charitable. Innocent looking paragraph ap
pears In the new charter, which means much,
and provides lucrative life positions for ex
mayors. We refer to the last paragraph of
section 2, article 11. which reads as follows:
Every person who has served as mayor of the
City and County, so long as he remains a resi
dent thereof, shall be entitled to a seat in the
Board of Supervisors and to participate in its
debates, but shall not be entitled to a vote nor
to any compensation; therefore,
Resolved, That the Executive Committee of
the Continental League request the freehold
ers through the public press to inform them
why that clause was placed therein, and what
benefit will accrue to the city by its adoption.
We recall but one ex-mayor (interested), Mr.
Ellert. A member of the Board of Freehold
ers, and at present president or manager of
an Infant corporation, known as the garbage
crematory, which, with proper nursing 1 , can be
made to assume gigantic proportions.
We can but admire the sublime simplicity of
an ex-mayor, with a large family, offering his
services for life, to the city. No compensation
required (sweet charity). In that position ex
mayors will not only be able to engineer their
own personal schemes throush the h.iard, to the
detriment and injury of others, but would in
the event of large or small corporation* requir
ing the services of one or more advocates, close
to the Board of Supervisors, command a high
price for thrvse services, while protecting or
advocating their interest?, and not being an
elected officer, no responsibility would attach
thereto.
The several thousand employes of the city
1 practically appointed by the' mayor, mieht
i require the Bervicefl of the ex-mayor to retain
I them in their positions and a healthy purse
| could be raised to pay for services performed
I In that direction.
Talk about the palmy days of Boss Twee 6
and Buckley, they would not be in it, com
pared with the golden harvest the ex-boss
mayors would receive.
The division would be simply enormous, but
charity covers a multitude of sins.

Â» P- m.WORK AHEAD FOR
SAMPSON'S SHIPS
The Naval Officials Believe the
Second Sea Battle Will Be
Fought Before Tuesday.
NEW YORK, May 7.â The Herald's Washington correspondent telegraphs: Within forty-eight hours, It Is the
confident expectation of the administration, the second sea fight of the war will occur, and either Rear Admiral
Sampson's men-of-war or the battleship Oregon and gunboat Marietta will represent this Government in the engage
ment. Certainly by Monday, at the latest, naval experts say the scouts will have sighted the Spanish fleet which
sailed from St. Vincent on Friday a week ago, or they shall have fallen in with the Oregon and her consort. Ad
miral Sampson's fleet is so placed as to be able to steam quickly to intercept the Spanish fleet if the scouts should
report? that it is sailing in the direction of Porto Rico. It will be his policy to meet the Spaniards as quickly
as possible after he learns their location and force fc battle at once, giving the Spanish admiral little time to pre
pare his ships for the fight after the American fleet is sighted.
Since the official reports of the battle of Manila have furnished such* conclusive evidence of the superiority of
the American gun crews over those of Spain, very little uneasiness is felt for the safety of Admiral Sampson's
fleet in the event of a fight with the Spanish fleet. It is realized, however, that the vessels and the guns with
which he will have to contend are far superior to those which were opposed to Admiral Dewey. Most of the
Spanish vessels at Manila were of old types, and the largest guns they carried were 6.2 inch.
Admiral Sampson will be confronted with the crack vessels of the Spanish navy. Three of these carry be
tween them six eleven-inch guns, and another one carries two six-inch guns. The heavy guns in Admiral Sampson's
fleet which will be opposed to these, are four thlrteen-inch, eight twelve-inch and twenty-two eight-inch guns.
Admiral Sampson's fleet Is superior to that of the Spanish admiral in heavy guns. The secondary batteries
of the two fleets are more nearly equal.
Naval experts here, however, place more reliance in the superior handling of the American ships and guns
than in the superiority of the American batteries. The Spaniards are expecteci to put up a stubborn fight, and It
is hardly to be expected that Adn.iral Sampson will come out of the battle unhurt or without the loss of a man or
serious damage to his ships, as did Dewey.
There is no doubt, however, that this battle will as effectually destroy Spain's naval power In the Atlantic
as did the battle of Manila in the Pacific.
Should the Spaniards have gone toward Cape St. Rogue to Intercept the Oregon the battle between their fleet and
this ship and her two small companions, the Marietta and Nictheroy, would be decidedly unequal. The advantage
would all be on the side of the Spaniards, but there is no doubt among naval experts here that the Oregon would
give a good account of herself and would send some of the Spanish ships to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.
The reports that Spanish war vessels have been sighted off Martinique and at other points in the West Indies
have given rise to some little uneasiness In Washington. If these vessels are the fleet from the Cape Verde it
would indicate that the Spanish admiral had made a much more rapid voyage than was anticipated, and that he
Intended to run down to- the southward to look for the Oregon, for, if he were making a run to get into Porto Rico
before he could be intercepted he would not go so far south as Martinique. The- general belief among naval officers,
however, Is that if the vessels reported at Martinique really were Spanish war vessels, they were some of the gun
boats which had been employed for the patrol of Cuba and Porto Rico and which had escaped to the southward.
Though it has not been believed that there was much real danger of the Spanish fleet attempting to attack
the northern ports of the United States, if the scouts should be unable to locate the fleet en route for Porto Rico be
fore Monday, and if there is no report of its having returned to either the Canaries or Cadiz by that time, addi
tional precautions will be taken to prevent a possible attack on any of the northern sea-coast cities. The patrol of
the northern coast, now being maintained, will be made more thorough, and fast vessels will be sent further to
sea all along the coast to intercept and report the Spanish fleet if it should have turned to the northward.

ON BOARD THE HERALD-CALL
DISPATCH BOAT ALBERT F. DEW
EY, with the blockading squadron oft
Cuba, via Key West, Fla., May 7.â
There was a second battle at Matanzas
yesterday, and Lieutenant Commander
Kimball of the Dupont was laughing
about it this morning. When the Dewey
found the torpedo-boat ten miles to the
east of that port to exchange news, I
got a boat oown and went to the Du
pont, where the blithe commander told
me that his boat and the Hornet, with
their light guns, had shelled the block
house beside the lighthouse at Point
Maya, near tr--> mouth of the harbor of
Matanzas, and Fo*t Garcia, which is an
old hacl.-ida used as a blockhouse and
lies three and one-half miles to the
east.
As fhe Dupont was leaving her posi
tion off the lighthouse point a big shell
was fired from the middle embrasure of
a battery of the other side of the har
bor called Gorda. The line was perfect,
but the elevation was bad and the
range too long. The shell fell a thou
sand yards short.
Lieutenant Commander Kimball, on
learning that the Dewey had an agent
of the Junta on board and was in
search of a messenger from the insur
gents in Matanzas province, told me it
might be of interest for me to know
that some Spanish cavalry was scour
ing the coast off which we were talking.
I asked if he would run in with the
Dewey and allow us to take a messen
ger off under cover of the Dupont's
one-pounder.
"With pleasure," he replied, and a
little later the trick had been done and
the dispatch-boat was on her way to
Key West with brown-skinned Am
brosia Diaz, who has messages of im
portance for the Junta, He was landed
on the coast by the Leyden on May 4.
Since yesterday morning he had been
waiting in the mangrove bushes which
fringe the coast by the little village of
Boca de Camarioca, eight miles east
of Matanzas.
He completed Lieutenant-Command
er Kimball's story by telling us that
while the Hornet was throwing shells
into the block house beside the light
house yesterday afternoon the in
surgents under Colonel Rojas to the
southward climbed into the trees to
see the performance from reserved
seats, and cheered madly as the Hot
net's men got the range and hit their
target. Lieutenant-Commander Kim
ball, when he found it advisable to call
up the Hornet, with her six-pounders,
r | told her commander not to destroy the
j lighthouse tower, but only the block
! house of the garrison, and left the
I tower for the cover of the neighboring
trees. This was at 3 o'clock in the af
ternoon. The Hornet fired twelve
shells, half of which struck the mark.
The Dupont, after making sure that
Point Maya was being made too warm
fo-r Spanish occupation, steamed down
I to a blockhouse opposite called Garcia
Red, and a prominent landmark to the
eastward, and turned loose her one
pounders.
Here, as in the other place, the in
fantry men had urgent business behind
, the forest woods and hills. After mak-
S ing sure that they had gone to stay
i the Dupont resumed patrol duty. The
j cavalry afterward appeared at For
tina, but remained there only long
enough to see the torpedo-boat's men
acing one-pounders off shore.
Diaz, with his son Ramon and a col
ored insurgent soldier, had seen this
cavalry on their way from Rojas' camp
to the beach near Boca de Camarioca,
where old "Practico" was to be picked
up. Just behind the fringe of man
grove bushes on the shore is a road
running parallel with the coast, and
the guerrilla cavalry had been moving
east, and then west along it.
Once across the road and on the sea
side of the bushes the insurgents were
fairly safe, but did not relish the idea
THE SAX FRAKCISCOCALL, SUNDAY, MAY 8, 1898.
of leaving their hiding place for the
purpose of signaling the boats oft*
shore. The Dewey ran in toward shore
with the Dupont. Diaz was to wave
his handkerchief. As Dewey ran in
toward shore with the Dupont beside
her I made out a boat with fishermen
in it and beyond that, half concealed
by the bushes, a man in light clothes,
which, at the distance, appeared to be
those worn by the insurgents in the
field. He concealed himself at inter
vals, but finally advanced a little way
from cover and waved his handker
chief. We waved in reply, and then
at the suggestion of J. E. Cartay, who
had given Captain Hyers information
which enabled him to find Diaz, a white
signal was tied to a wire stay and al
lowed to flap there, it was some one's
white shirt, but It filled the bill admira-
The man on the beach waved energet
ically, and I lowered a boat from the
Dewey and with Cartay rowed in I
had told Captain Hyers to keep "his
glass on the man, and as we left the
tug he shouted to me that two men
were in the bushes beside the one which
signaled, and had rifles. These we sup
posed %vere the men sent from the camp
of the insurgents with the messenger.
â¢ so it proved. One was the son of
Diaz. The three hurried across the
sand to the edge of the rooks which
form the coast there. The little boat's
gunwale was grasped by the Insurgents
in a trice. Diaz remembered that he
and I were old shipmates, having sailed
together in the Three Friends when she
was fired on under the hills of the
south coast of Santa Clara in Decem
ber, 1897, and so he was willing to tell
what news he could.
The torpedo boat, a few hundred
yards away beside the Dewey, was our
guarantee that the cavalry would prob
ably keep on the other side of the trees
Diaz climbed into the boat and told
| his son and the other insurgents to
j hurry back to camp. They would have
tarried to give him more messages
from friends, but he reminded them of
the time, and they hurried away. We
returned to the Dewey, and as we -went
over the side shouted our thanks to the
commander of the Dupont. The tor
pedo boat steamed off shore, after
sending a boat to us with mail for Key
"West. Diaz told us the Spaniards were
hurriedly moving troops westward and
to the coast cities, and withdrawing
them from the interior. He did not
know the details of the killed and
wounded at the Matanzas bombard
ment. He said that Belancous, briga
dier of the insurgents In Matanzas
province, had about 500 men and only
a small sick list. The hospital facili
ties are bad, and men wounded would
be in a bad fix, but Rajos had only
four of them. The country folk are in
terrible straits for food.
Diaz said the insurgents had really
been feeding their friends in Boca de
Oamarioca. There disease and famine
had carried off lf>o of the wretches who
found shelter there in the last few
months of reconcentration. The dead
outnumbered the population which the
village would have in time of peace.
Some of Rojas' men who were captured
by the Spanish three days ago were re
leased and sent back with a message
that the Yankees had begun war and
that the Cubans and Spanish, being
of the same blood, should combine to
fight the United States. The insur
gents were surprised at not being killed
by their captors, and said they would
take the message gladly and hurried to
Rojas. Their story was laughed at
Colonel Rojaa said the news from the
outside world would not prevent his
fighting the Spanish. Diaz says such
efforts to make the Cubans desert are
becoming general. Little notices are
left on trees, saying that the Yankees
will leave nothing Spanish on the isl
and if they have their way, and urging
all Cubans to unite and fight them
The Spanish are still burning and de
stroying as they move, and still the
guerrilla cavalry scours the country
driving the cattle into the towns. As
far as Diaz could learn, the railway
between Matanzas and Havana has
been kept open.

ARMED MEN WATCH
THE WISCONSIN
They Patrol the Shore -Where the
Battle Ship Lies to Guard
Against Secret Attack.
Rumors That an Attempt Would Be Made
to Destroy the Vessel Cause Increased
Vigilance on the Part of Officials.
The managers of the Union Iron
Works fear that an attempt will be
made to destroy the battle-ship Wis
consin and the torpedo-boat which are
now in the course of construction. For
several days past rumors of an attempt
being made by Spaniards to blow up
the vessels have created the wildest
excitement at the works. Last night
Lieutenant Anderson of the Potrero
station was appealed to, and he sent
nil his available men It guard the ves
sels. Concluding that the force was
not large enough he telephoned to Cap
tain Spillane for more men. The lat
ter picked out four of his best officers
and sent them to assist in preventing
the vessels from being tampered with.
The managers of the Union Ironworks
have also a number of men who have
been patrolling the works looking out
for any person who might attempt to
destroy the vessels. Both the torpedo
boat and the Wisconsin are being
closely guarded, and every effort is
being made to prevent a Spanish spy
from entering the works.
Armed men are patrolling the shores
of the bay contiguous to the point
where the torpedo-boat is being con
structed, with instructions to shoot
any person who attempts to tamper
with the vessels.
Since the report that two Spaniards
were overheard on the Eastern overland
to remark that they had come to this
Slate for the purpose of blowing up
the powder works and also to assassin
ate Governor Budd, the managers of
the Union Iron Works have exercised
every caution to prevent any attempt
to injure their plant. As rumors
were current that a Spaniard answer
ing a description of one of the
INTER-CLUB TENNIS.
The First Match of the Series Woi^
by the Local Players.
The first match of the inter-club doubles
was played yesterday at the California
tennis courts between Adams and Weihe
of San Francisco and Stone and Mur
dook of Alameda. The home team won
and the Alameda cracks went home In
utter disgust.
The ttrÂ«t set was the hottest of the
match. Game by game the teams ad
vanced until it was five all. The visitors
captured the n^xt game, needing only one
more to win the set, but this they
not to get. Adams and Weihe braced
themselves and the set was the property
of the home team.
To the surprise of all the second set
was won in ridiculously easy fashion by
Stone and Murdock. They allowed their
opponents but three games out of the set.
The next two sets were attached by
Adams and Weihe. The home team
played good and fast tennis in the last
two sets, driving accurateU and placing

BILLS FOR LIGHTING.
Reductions May Be Made in the
Amounts Charged the City.
Negotiations are in progress looking to
a settlement between the city and the
San Francisco Gas Light Company and
the Edison Light and Power Company.
Several of the claims of these two com
panies have already been vetoed by
Mayor Pholan, on the ground that the
charges were excessive, owing to meters
that have a tendency to "scorch."
Two such vetoes were tiled by the
Mayor yesterday. One was of the claim
of the San Francisco Gas Light Company
for $&73 12 for lighting certain public
buildings during the month of January.

COL. TRUMBO A FREE MAN,
Fully Released From the Bonds of Matrimony in Salt
Lake City Yesterday,
News was received In this city last night that Mrs. Trumbo was granted
a divorce from Colonel Isaac Trumbo in Salt Lake yesterday. The decree
was entered by default, no defense having been entered in the case.
Mrs. Trumbo was well known as a Salt Lake belle before her marriage,
having been prominent in society for several years before the promising
aspirant for the United States Senate married her. Incompatibility of tem
per and tastes became apparent a few years ago, culminating In the suit de
cided yesterday.
The plaintiff was granted $100*) in cash, also a farm of sixty acres at Mill
Creek, fifty shares of stock in the American Biscuit Company, 10,000 shares
of stock in the Free Gold Mining Company of California and some other
minor property. In consideration of these transfers Mrs. Trumbo agreed to
deed to Colonel Trumbo certain property in San Francisco.

lurking In the vicinity of the works,
extra precautions were taken to thwart
any attempt on his part to destroy the
plant. The police were at once con
sulted, and have decided to place an
armed guard in charge of the two ves
sels.
Captain Spillane, when asked about
the matter last night, was unusually
secretive. He admitted, however, that
Lieutenant Bennett's divison had been
detailed to patrol the works, and that
he had sent four men from his division
to assist them.
oince the commencement of hostili
ties between the United States and
Spain the managers of the iron works
have been appealed to by the Govern
ment to hasten the completion of the
battleship and torpedo boat. Work on
the former has been rushed, and it is
expected that it will be put into service
before many weeks. The frame of the
torpedo boat has been finished and the
machinery is now being placed. in posi
tion. The managers of the works have
doubled their working force in order
that the vessels might be completed
as soon as possible.
The scene in the vicinity of where
the boats lie is one of activity and ex

the peace are patrolling the shore line,
keeping a sharp lookout for any spy

ber of special officers employed by the
iron works are patrolling the half-fin

hands on their guns, ready to shoot
down any enemy who might attempt
her destruction. On the outside of the

DR. PIERCES MEDICINES. _^
;WOMA|OiÂ»TLK
WAT SHE GIVES TO A XATM.
, Whether war shall descend and con-
tinue upon us now with all its indes-
cribable horrors and frightful carnage,
or the brooding angel of peace shall
"spread her white wings to the sun-
shine of love" â whatever may be the
issue to-day or any other day in our
American history â the tremendous fact
remains the same, ] that woman is for-
ever a chief and inseparable factor in
the warfare of nations.
Her rare appearance on the battlefield
or In hospitalsâ nursing, cheering and
hrf-M â¢ *â  if f( F"Â» ... /. SÂ» \ \ '^ T *^
comforting the wounded or dyingâ is a
very small part of what woman does
to promote this country's fighting ca-
pacity. She does more than roll band-
ages, scrape lint and send out dainty
boxes of provisions for husbands,
brothers and sweethearts in the field.
The wives and mothers, and the sis-
ters and sweethearts that will become
wives and mothers â contribute some-
thing more in addition to this cheering
comfort and inspiration.
Every male fighter, however brawny
and heroic, was born of woman; was
once a feeble infant drawingâ along
with his very breath of life from his
mother's own physical resources â the
hardihood, mental stamina and high
courage that become a nation's final
and impregnable defense in the last
dread arbitrament of war.
Shall we say that women contribute
the bandages and provisions? No;
they contribute the fighters!
What sort of men will the women
of this present day contribute to the
nation and the world? What sort of
help and encouragement and inspira-
tion can a woman be who is enfeebled
and broken down by the diseases and
weaknesses peculiar to her sex? Can
such a woman maintain the position
that belongs to her on the battlefield
of every-day exertion and struggle?
Can she hope to be a capable mother
or efficient wife?
The dreadful sufferings which women
endure solely because of the delicate,
special organization which makes them
wives and mothers leads a thoughtful
person to consider whether it is most
woefully deplorable on their own sad
account or for the sake of the other
lives that are sooner or later dependent
on their own.
It is certain that the great work
which has been done toward restoring
the physical capacity of women in the
last twenty years, by Dr. R. V. Pierce
of Buffalo, N. V., has had a phenomenal
share in building up the courage and
power of the present generation. But
there are fifty thousand more women
who ought to know what Dr. Pierces
extraordinary medical insight and ex-
perience and his marvelous "Favorite
Prescription" have done for their
hopeless, discouraged sisters through-
out the world.
Every woman knows that the average
doctor cannot understand her case. He
is too busy; he has too many other
cases of an entirely different nature;
he lacks the special experience and
thorough understanding which are ne-
cessary to a complete appreciation of
her troubles. A lifetime of experience
and constant study has made Dr.
Pierce the acknowledged expert au-
thority in this particular field of prac-
tice.
So many women are in almost the
same state of mind as Mrs. Elizabeth
J. Bullard of Winnie, Bladen Co., N. C.
"I was afflicted for seventeen months."
she writes. "I was confined to the
house and yard all the time. I could
not be on my feet but a very little:
could not lift the weierht of a cup of
coffee, and did not have the strength to
speak more than Â«. few words at a
time. We tried three doctors and a
lot of patent medicine, which cost over
one hundred and twenty-five dollars,
and found no relief. I had lost all
hopes of ever getting any better when
my friends advised me to take Dr.
Pierces medicines. My husband said
he would try them next. He got me
five bottles of 'Favorite Prescription'
and three of 'Golden Medical Discov-
ery.' I commenced taking these med-
icines and soon found relief. When
I had taken one bottle of each I walk-
ed half a mile to church. I commenced
taking them the first of January. 1897;
the first of the following June I took
my cooking In hand and have cooked
for eleven In family all through the
summer. It was Dr. Pierces medi-
cines that gave me all the relief I have
received. I recommend them to all
suffering females, for it is his medi-
cines and the help of God that has re-
stored me. May the Lord bless him
and his medicines for the good they i
have done me."
Another lady, Mrs. "W. G. Day of
Trussville, Jefferson Co., Ala., writes:
"I cannot find words sufficient to ex-
press my praise for Dr. Pierces medi-
cine. For two years I had suffered
with weakness, headache, pain in my
back and side which would become
so sore that I could hardly bear
the weight of my hand UDon it; had
I DR. PIERCES MEDICINES.
I cold hands and feet and many other,
bad feelings, too numerous to men-
tion. Home physicians' treatment
did me no good. I had become very
despondent and thought I would
never be well again, but with a faint
heart I wrote Dr. Pier c and de-
scribed my symptoms as best I could.
He promptly answered by letter, and
sent me a treatise on 'Woman and Her
Diseases'; he also outlined a treatment j
for me which I followed to the best of'
my ability, and after taking six bottles
of 'Favorite Prescription' I can truth-
fully say that I felt like a new woman.
iln a few months afterward, when X
was suffering with the many troubles
I due to pregnancy, I procured 'Favorite
| Prescription' and took it through that
! time. I soon became very stout and.
I felt well. I was in labor only a shortj
time and got along wellâ better than Ii
ever did before. My baby is a fine boy,
now two months old, and has never"
I been sick any. I will never miss an
! opportunity to recommend Dr. Pierces
| medicines. I hope that all suffering
ladies will consult you, for I think they
will be benefited by taking your medi-l
| cines."
In the treatment of women's diseases]
â  there must be on the part of the physi-
j cian a realizing sense first of all that
' the trouble is a specific one; that It
saps the very foundation of a woman's
j vitality. It is not to be pooh-poohed at (
j nor made light of; nor "patched up"
with "a little something for the diges-]
tion," or a little something else for the.
' heart action. The remedy must be
i radical and thorough; it must give
' specific tone, heal h, purity end or-
; ganic power directly to the fundament-
j al starting point of the difficulty; It
must entirely rejuvenate the nervous
system and recreate the supply of com-!
plete, forceful, abundant vitality.
The wisest physician is none too wise
j to deal with these troubles; scientific
! training, deep study and the widest
I practical experience are indispensable;]
, no mere unskilled nurse, however cap-,
! able in her own sphere, is at all suit- :
I able or equipped with the requisite un-i
! derstanding of physiology and mcdi->
cine to be safely trusted in difficultieaj
so delicate and complicated.
All cases are not precisely alike tai
every respect; and while, as a matter (
of fact and record, there has not beenj
found one case out of a hundred of fe-i
male difficulties but what was prompt-!
ly alleviated and eventually cured by
Dr. Pierce* Favorite Prescription, fre-
quently it happens that in obstinate!
cases a course of simple and inexpen-j
sive self-treatment at home will great-]
ly aid recovery. In all such cases Dr. i
Pierce gladly gives careful, prof es- j
sionai advice by mail free of charge.
He has been for thirty years chief!
consulting physician of the Invalids' |
Hotel and Surgical Institute at Buffalo,;
X. V., and has gathered about him a'
staff of eminent associate specialists
in the different fields of medical prac-
tice. Dr. Pierce has originated some
of the most wonderfully effective rem-
edial discoveries known in modern
medicine. The late President Garfleld
once said of him: "He is one of the!
best men in the world and is at the i
head of one of the best medical lnstl- j
tutions in the world."
Any woman may feel absolute confi-
dence in writing to Dr. Pierce: her let-
ter will be considered sacredly private,
never published except by her express
wish and permission, and will be an-
swered with a sincere and intelligent
desire to place at her command thÂ«
most capable and expert medical serv-
ice to be obtained anywhere in the
world.
"My wife 1 d been a great sufferer |
for a number of years with nervous !
prostration associated with every
j symptom that women of her age (45)
; are liable to have," writes W. O. Gard-
j ncr, Esq., of No. 122 Diamond street, I
Little Falls, N. Y. "She took a good I
deal of medicine of various kinds, and j
doctored with local doctors until I was >
I not able to pay any more doctors' bills. !
j She read the book that she procured I
! from you. and commenced to use Dr. ;
i Pierces Golden Medical Discovery and ]
j his 'Favorite Prescription.' Her health j
! is better now than it has been In six {
j years. If she had used the medicine six i
I years ago I might have been a good '
i many hundred dollars better off."
"I had been a great sufferer from, -â¢
I female weakness," writes Mrs. M. B. â¢
Wallace of Muenster, Cook Co., Texas./
"I tried four doctors and none did mer
any good. I suffered six years, but af
last I found relief. I followed yora
advice, and took four bottles of 'Gold-"
en Medical Discovery,' and eight of the
'Favorite Prescription.' I feel like a
new woman. I have gained eighteen
pounds."
The famous work entitled "Tha
Common Sense Medical Adviser," by
R. V. Pierce, M. D., is a splendid, thou-
sand page illustrated volume, which is
in itself a complete, popular medical
library. It has had a greater sale than
any other medical work ever printed
in any language, and has made Dr.
Pierces name a household word in
every corner of the English-speaking:
world. The profit from the sale of tha
first great edition of 750,000 copies, at
$1 50 each, prompted Dr. Pierce to issue
a free edition in paper covers. Most of:
this edition has already been taken up,
but while it lasts a copy will be sent,
without charge, on receipt of 21 one-
cent stamps, to cover the cost of mail-

Orders may soon i??ur for the Fif

stationed in New Mexico, to report at
once to General Merriam at the Pre

riam has received instructions from
Washington to mobilize the volunteer
â  regiments of Oregon, Washington and
Idaho at San Francisco. The purp â¢â -â¢â¢
of this military activity ..-= not con

the haughty and boastful Spanish.
According to the most trustworthy

An encampment will be established at
the Presidio of San Francisco for the
Fourteenth United States Infantry and
the volunteer forces of the States of Cali

The California volunteers will be sent
to the camp by regiments and batteries
as fast as practicable after having been

i upon their arrival in San Francisco.
First Lieutenant John M. Neil!, Fourth

in view, first, facilities for water supply,
and ..second, economy of space. The lirst
site selected will be hounded as follows:
Commencing at the intersection of the

EDWARD FIELD.
Major Second Artillery, Acting Assistant
Adjutant General.
Governor Uudd, as Commander-in
chief of the military and naval forces
of the State, has gained ready recog
nition from Major General Merriam
and other officers of distinction for the
display of executive ability in the or
ganization and movement of troops. It
will gratify the taxpayers of California
to learn that the vast work of calling
the volunteers into service will not cost
the State a sum exceeding $3000. In
an interview yesterday the Governor
remarked: "The United States Govern
ment pays the expense of bringing the
Seventh Regiment from Los Angeles t<>
this city. The Government also pays
for the clothing and equipment of the
I Volunteers. The expenses of tele~raph-
S ic and telephonic service, clerical hire
' ami many other items incident to ser
j vice at headquarters are defrayed by
the Government. Even the expense of
' returning' to the point of enlistment the
| men who fr.tl to pass the medical ex im
[nation is borne by the United States.
State expenses will not ex< I $3000."
Commenting on this, the Governor
said: "This is proper, because Califor
! nia meets her share of the general bur-
I dens imposed for conducting the war.
The State pays her proportion of taxes
for the maintenance of the General
rnment. In the reorganization of
the National Guard to replace the men

the Sheriffs of the State will be or
ganized under the direction of Sheriff
Cunningham and others. No extra
compensation will be allowed, but we
shall have an excellent force of mount
ed scouts ready for any emergency."
The good points in the organisation
of the National Guard were illustrated
yesterday when Governor Budd re
ceived a message by wire from Surgeon
General Steinberg, U. S. A., relative to
the formation of a volunteer hospital
corps. Within five minutes after the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SL'^TDAY, iltfAY 8, 1898.
message came the order was conveyed
to Surgeon General Hopkins to organ
ize the corps as directed.
The two battalions of infantry in ad
dition to the two regiments under the
President's call will be ready for mus
tering in to-morrow. Each battalion is
to consist of four companies, making
eight companies. The Governor for
good and substantial reasons of record
has taken seven of the companies from
the Sixth Infantry Regiment of the San
Joaquin Valley. The eighth organiza
tion is Company E of the Second Infan
try, Sacramento. The troops now in
rendezvous at Stockton will arrive here
to-morrow and immediately go into
camp on the Presidio reservation.
It is a source of disappointment to
many of the young men; of San Jose,
Oakland, Alameda, Petaluma, Santa
Rosa and San Rafael that the excel
lent Fifth Regiment was not called into
the volunteer service, but the truth is
thai several companies of the Fifth
wrre not up to the numerical standard.
As usual, the busy men at National
Guard headquarters yesterday were
Governor James H. Budd, General A.
j W. Barrett and Colonel Fred Burgin.
I There was no cessation of the routine
| business which they have daily been
called upon to transact since the re
ceipt of the President's proclamation
calling for volunteers from this State.
There was, however, a break in the
smooth running of affairs at about
half-past 4 <,-'olock in the afternoon,
when a message was received inform
â  ing the Governor that no provision had
been made for feeding the members of
the Seventh Volunteer Infantry of Los
Angeles. The information greatly per
turbed the Governor, and he at once
instructed Colonel Burgin to purchase
all necessary supplies for the men,
telling Colonel Burgin to "give the
boys the best in the land." These in
structions were immediately carried
out, and. notwithstanding the short
time intervening, by 6 o'clock the com-
missary of the Seventh was supplied
with everything necessary to satisfy
the wants of the men, the Governor
giving the matter his personal atten
tion by visiting the camp at the Pre
sidio himself.
The following telegram was received
by Governor Hudd at 2 p. m. yester
day from the surgeon-general of the
United States army:
To the Governor of California: Please
request your surgeon general to nomi
nate to the mustering officer a sufficient

Immediately upon the receipt of the
above telegram General Barrett for
warded the following communication to
Colonel W. E. Hopkins, surgeon-general
of California:

ferry depot to welcome the solaiers. while
Market street and Golden Gate and Van

women and children eager to voice a
greeting:. At the depot Governor Budd.

field, with thi'ir stuffs, and Captain Car
rington, U. S. A., awaited the Seventh's
arrival, together with a platoon of police
j under command of Lieutenant Birdsall;
i tiie Second Brigade Signal Corps, mount
ed, Captain Perkins; Troop A, Cavalry, ,
| N. G. C, Captain Burnett, and a detach- 1
i ment of the Naval Battalion, commanded
â  by Lieutenant Commander Nerny, .Lieu
tenants Qunn and Elliott. Ensigns Kam
merrer and Peterson and Surgeon Morris-
Bey. The First Infantry having just been
' ordered into camp, was unable to act as
escort, but Colonel Smith sent his band i
I for duty.
The escort formed in lino on East street
and as the regiment marched out of the
ferry depot anus were presented, while
the band played the "Red, White and
Blue." The Seventh did not bring its
band, but its field music, a fine drum and
bugle corps, amply made up for the de
ficiency.
Accompanying the Seventh was Briga
dier General Last, commanding the First
Brigade; Lieutenant Colonel Welch, A.
A. <i.; Lieutenant Colonel Choate, sur
geon; Major Dockweller, engineer officer,
j and Captains Bower and Baker, aids, all
| on General Last's staff. Surgeon Choate
' will resign from the brigade staff and be
come chief surgeon of the Seventh Regi
| ment. These officers were conducted to
i carriages and the signal was give?, to
I start. The police swung into Market
\ street, followed i.y the signal corps, cay-
I airy, naval battalion and officers' car
riages, and a great cheer went up as the
head of the gallant Seven in appeared.
The field and staff, acting on orders, did
not brinÂ£ their horses, consequently Col
onel Berry tramped at the head of his
regiment, accompanied by the following
members of his staff: Lieutenant Colonel
Schreiber; Captain Alfonzo. a djutant;
Captain A. S. Clark, chaplain; Lieuten
ants Hutchinson, quartermaster, and Aus
tin, commissary. Major Prescott com
manded the First Battalion, composed of
Companies B, G, A and M, Lieutenant
Hlghee being his adjutant. The Second
Battalion, Companies X, C, F and I, was
commanded by Major Wener. with Lieu
tenant Frederick* adjutant. Major Bang
ham and Adjutant Blaokstock wore in
charge of the Third Battalion, Companies
L. D. H and E, the regiment forming in
this order. The non-commissioned staff
consists of Sergeant-Major Bradbury and
Principal Musician Heydenreicti.
Officers and men were, very tired, hav
ing traveled for twenty-four hours on
short rations in ordinary coaches without
even an opportunity to stretch them
selves, but when they heard the cheers
and saw the thousands who had turned
out to welcome them they forgot hunger
and fatigue and cheerily began their
march to the Presidio. The line of march
was up Market street to Golden Gate ave
enue, to Van Ness, to Lombard street
and out that boulevard to the camp
around. Market street was a mass of
cheering. flag-waving humanity. Traffic
was entirely suspended during the puss
ing of the troops, while merchants and
their employes forgot business in their
zeal to express their well wishes.
At Van Ness and Ellis the escort fell
out and saluted the Seventh as it passed
and soon after the route step was taken
:n order to relieve the men as much as
possible. When the Lombard street en
trance to the Presidio was reached line
was reformed, and passing between the
guard of the First, drawn up on one side
of the mad. and a battalion standing at
"present" on the other side, the regi
ment marched on to the big drill ground
and waited until the camp equipage ar
rived. The men unburdened themselves
of their haversacks and canteens and
threw themselves on the hard ground, ;
I almost exhausted from their long fast j
and hard march. But their troubles were
not yet at an end.
The regiment has not been mustered
into the United States service yet, and

The Dr. Slocum System at Last
Presents to Mankind a Perfect
and Positive Cure for This Foe
of Health.
CONQUERING THE CURSE OF
CENTURIES.
By Special Arrangement Three Free Bot-
tles of the Dr. Slocum System to All
Readers of " The San Francisco Call."
Science and
consumption have been battling for ages,
and now the glad tidings are being car-
ried around the world by the army of
the saved, that at last science is tri-
umphant, at last consumption has been
overcome and vanquished.
For many
weary years men of science have delved
in a desert of despair, seeking some
means with which to lay low the despoil-
er of human lives, the wrecker of peace-
ful homes, the grim guardian of the
graveyardâ consumption. Now the time
is at hand when all should know that
the terror of consumption is a thing of
the past; that the fatality of the disease
is absolutely unnecessary; that the
means to exterminate it from this glori-
ous world of ours is within the reach
of all, and Is an assured fact.
This annihilation of
consumption, this conqueror of bron-
chitis, asthma, catarrh and all other
complaints of lungs and throat, is named
after its celebrated discoverer, the Doc-
tor Slocum System of Treatment, and
cures by the simplest, the must natural
and yet the most forceful manner, by at
once removing the cause.
You cannot
expect, when a building is on fire, to
put out all the flames by pouring water
on a portion of them: neither can you
ever expect to conquer consumption by
stupefying the cough and allowing the
deadly" germs to continue in their wicked
work.
The Doctor Slocum
System is not in any sense a half-way
worker. It at once attacks the germs
and drives them, not only out of tlie
lungs, but out of the entire system. At
the saint- time, it gradually masters the
cough, until at length it disappears.
Meanwhile
it has been adding vigor and tone and
strength to the blood, until, to the merry
music of returning health, it leaps and
bounds joyfully through the veins, sei.il-
ing the bright, rich, rosy flush of youth
to the cheeks, rill the nerves tingle with
strength, the step becomes elastic, and
the head i? held proudly erect, with the
full sense of rejuvenation and recreation.
Why you
fairly thirst for air after you have been
under the Doctor Slocum System for a
little while. Where before you were un-
able to take even the slightest strain on
your lungs In breathing, you find, after
a. little bit. that your lungs, once so
poor and tired, greedily take in copious
draughts of air, and away down in the
lower parts, which had been worse than
uselofs for so long, this pure, heaven-
s.-tit air pen. ;rates and sends the blood
bounding away with the glad ttdlnga â¢â¢:
perfect health, til! you feel, no matter
how groat the obstacle, you are ready
and able to cope with it.

The Doctor
Slocum System is the result of years of
it research and study. It is the
crystallisation, into a complete and sim-
ple system of treatment, of the discover-
ies of Koch, Virchow and Metchnikoff.
It Is as
its name implies, a comprehensive and
complete system of treatment, which at-
tacks every vulnerable point of the dis-
ease and completely vanquishes it. It
leaves no point unguarded: it leaves no
phase of the trouble neglected; it cures,
and cures forever, by absolutely obliter-
ating the cause, and with the cause re-
moved , the disease must necessarily dis-
appear.
In all the
annnls of scientific discoveries the Doc-
tor Slocum System must be accorded first

SOUTHERN BOYS.
Continued from Page Ten.
4 ie men must be examined by the regu
lar surgeons, although they have already
passed examination by the regimental
corps. As this will require two days at
least, it was at first decided to quarter
them in the Page street Armory until
they had been mustered in. At the last
I minute, however, they were ordered to
the Presidio direct, and tired as they were
and with no provision made for feeding
them, they had to set to work and pitch
their tents before they could find shelter
from the strong west wind. This wind
was most trying to the men, coming, as
they have, from an almost tropical cli
mate, and those who were not provided
with overcoats. chilled to the mar
row. One of the First's surgeons re
marked that it would not be surprising
if some of the men were attacked with
pneumonia.
To add to their misery Colonel Berry
was instructed to not bring his mess
equipage, so that although Lieutenant
.Nolan, the post commissary, soon had an
ample supply of provisions of every de
scription delivered to the regiment, there
were no ovens or cooking utensils to pre
pare the food, or dishes to serve it on.
Not a word of complaint was heard,
however, the men toiling cheerfully
through the long hours of the afternoon
pitching their tents. They were greatly
hampered in this work owing to lack of
tent pegs, and it was nearly dark before
the last company and headquarters tent
was in place. The garrison was drawn on
for utensils, and finally the half-famished
men were served with an abundance of
substantial food of excellent quality.
The regular army officers stationed at
the post are deserving of more than a
mere complimentary word for the aid ex
tended to their volunteer brothers-in
arms. It was they who laid out the camp
grounds, marked off the company streets
and in various ways did all in their power
to make officers and men comfortable. |
The officers of the Fourtn Cavalry were
particularly active in this work, while
Captain Carrington and Lieutenant Clo
man were here, there and everywhere ar-
W ranging for blankets, overcoats, camp and
~ mess supplies and attending to countless
other things calculated to add to the wel
fare of the men. Lieutenant Nolan is
looked upon by the Seventh as more than
its guardian angel because of his prompt
I steps to provide for them.
On the whole, those who were inclined
to the opinion that the "regulars" would
give the volunteers the cold shoulder are
most happily disappointed, and are now
the loudest in singing the praises of the
West Pointers. While the First went into
camp well equipped, the Seventh was al
most destitute of the necessaries of camp, I
but by Monday it will be fully provided
for in every respect by the Government.
The work of examining the men and
mustering them in will begin at 8 o'clock
â¢ this morning . The surgeons of both regi
ments will be on duty and it Is hoped to
complete the work to-night, though it
may take until to-morrow to examine
them all.
The Seventh Is composed of twelve com
panies of eighty-four men each, with five
/ extra men to the company to fill th*Â»
places of any who may fail to pass the
examination." The companies, with their
officers and their home station, are as

Chaplain Alf -'I S. Clark Is one of the
most striking I ires in the regiment. He
is a tali, handsome man of about 60 years
of ncre and is loved by every man in -the

cated by the chaplain, who declares he
A will go wherever the regiment goes. He

Christ Episcopal Church, one of the most
prominent in Los Angeles. Yesterday the
chaplain marched the entire distance with
the regiment, declining an invitation to a

to be with his boys. At Van Ness avenue

FIRST INFANTRY.
The Regiment in Camp at
the Presidio.
Tt was exact o'clock a. m. yester
day when above th<- noise of busy prep
aration the clear notes of the trumpeter's
:r,dine- to the First Califor
nia United States Volunteer Infantry t*Â»Â«
first rail to quarters. For a moment the
armory seemed a maelstrom of disorder
and chaoa as the men hurried to their
V company rooms. A few minutes later
thf- sergeant's call was blown and the
companies formed arid marched from the
armory. somo in heavy and others in
light marching order. The regiment
/ormcd upon Paef street, with its left
resting upon Market and facing -to the
' i east.
When Major Kelleher, the adjutant of
the regiment, had completed the forma
tion he rode up to Colonel Smith, who
with his staff occupied a position in front
of the color company, and reported the
formation as being completed. The col
onel then drew his sword and Rave the
command, "Port arms, fours rig-ht, for
ward inarch." which was the first com
mand he had given the regiment as a
colonel of United States volunteers, and
the long blue line of soldiers swung off at
a lively step on their march to the Pre
sidio, with the drum and fife corps play
ir.pr the martial strains of "T^mmy At
kins."
The scenes around the First Regiment
Armory as the men were preparing to
leave were interesting 1 and full of the

liveliest animation, .-with. a touch of sad
ness withal, for more i than one anxious
mother's tear-filled eyes told the story of
her heart's love for her boy. Then there
were wives to say good-by to their hus
bands. Â
There was not such a large crowd as
had been expected would be present, but
this was because the public did not know
the regiment would march so early. It
had been published that it 'would leave
the armory at noon, but Colonel Smith,
realizing the immense amount of work
to be done in getting his camp up,
thought it best, to get to the Presidio as
soon as possible.
Surgeon Major McCarthy was at the
armory at an early hour to examine the
last of the late men to. get in. He de
tailed Captain Rethers as the surgeon of
the new camp temporarily, until he has
completed the work of examining all the
men of the different commands that are
to be mustered into the Government serv
ice. â^
The line of march of the regiment was
up Van Ness avenue to Lombard street,
and thence to the Presidio. Colonel Smith,
his staff and the men who are to fight
for Uncle Sam* received an ovation all
along the route, and especially cheered
was B Company, which Is commanded by-
Captain Filmer, and to whom belongs the
honor of carrying the regimental colors.
At McAllister street the four companies,
C, F, G and K. from the Ellis street ar
mory. Joined the regiment as the third
battalion and brought up the rear. The,
first battalion headed the regiment and/
the second was in the middle. â 'â 
It was exactly twenty minutes to 12
o'clock when Company M passed through
the Lombard-street entrance of the Pre
sidio and stepped upon the Government
reservation as the sworn and trusted
soldiers of Uncle Sam. The companies
filed to the right as they entered and
marched down toward the bay, prepara
tory to being assigned to their camp.
Lieutenant J. M. Nc-all, U. B. a., received j
Colonel Smith and gave orders as to |
where he was to make his camp. He was I
also of great assistance to the officers of
the regiment in getting their companies
properly assigned.
As soon as the place for the camp was
designated, which is just to the left of
the Lombard-street entrance, the work
of erecting the tents began, and soon the
men were as busy as bees getting their
new home together and things in shape.
The company streets run north and south
with the tents facing to the east, so as
to avoid the wind from the bay. Colonel
Smith's headquarters were established
just across the road from the regiment
camp and to the right as one enters the
Presidio on the cars. The Hospital Corps
also established its camp on the same side j
of the road as that of the colonel.
On the right is the First Battalion,
composed of Companies M.-A, E and I;
in the center is the Second Battalion,
composed of Companies H, B. D and L
while upon the left is the Third Bat
talion, composed of Companies X, C, F
and G. Beyond the First Regiment is
encamped the Seventh, and to their left
will be the troops from Oregon and
"Washington.
It was shortly after 1 o'clock when the
Seventh came marching into the Presidio
with the blare of trumpets and the rattle
of drums. Just before Colonel Berry's
command arrived upon ' the grounds.
Colonel Smith ordered the assembly to
be sounded, and the men ceased work and
formed by companies without arms ps
their comrades passed in review. The !
companies uncovered as the colors of the
Seventh went by. and when the last com
pany of the . Seventh was upon the
grounds the First gave them three cheers
and a tiger as a soldiers' welcome.
Captain Carrington yesterday gave out
the following letter for publication:
Vancouver Barracks, "Wash., May 4, 189 S.
Captain P. de L. Carrington, San Francisco,
Ca!.â Sir: When the enlistment and enroll
ment of the California volunteers Is completed,
if more than California's quota desire service
please refer them to the Fourteenth Infantry
tor enlistment in that regiment upon its ar
rival in San Francisco, should any vacancies
exist. Very respectfully,
H. C. MERRIAM. Brigadier-General.
The work of pitching the tents occu
pied some time, and this with the general
formation of the camp consumed the beat
part of the afternoon and evening. Colonel
Smith was everywhere, giving his person
al attention to the many matters that
caJled for it, and his ability as an officer
of organization was never better illus
trated than it was yesterday. The cap
tains of the different companies were
busy looking after the comfort of their
men and attending to the drawing of ra
tions and blankets from the quartermas
ter. The officers of the Presidio called
upon Colonel Â£mith at different times
during the day and extended to him and
his command many courtesies.
It will be at least a day before every
thing is running in perfect working order.
Lieutenant McOnrren of Company D was
the officer of the guard yesterday. The
dt-tail consisted of thirty-two men, four
corporals and a sergeant. Colonel Smith
issued an order dividing the beats of the
sentinels into twelve posts. After the
officers' mess at supper all of the officers
were summoned to headquarters, where
Colonel Smith held a conference with
them relative to the routine matters of
the camp and its military conduct.
At 11 o'clock taps were blown, and save
for the sentinel's challenge of the hour an
his "All's well" rang out upon the nighi
air, nothing disturbed the silence that
rested like a calm of peace over the
i sleeping soldiers who were doing their
i first duty for their Government.
Captain-Surgeon Rethers and his able
corps had several slight wounds to dress
yesterday. Private Hopkins, Company F,
cut his right hand; Private Smiley, Com
pany G,' received a cut upon the jaw;
Private | Harrison, Company I. had his
right thumb cut, and Corporal Trasch
ner. Company E, had an epileptic fit and
was taken to the field hospital upon a
stretcher. He shortly recovered. He will
probably be honorably discharged from
the service.
Colonel Smith's first mall In camp
brought him the following two communi
tlons:

The property of the Giant Powder

there was an explosion at the works at
Clipper Gup, in Placer County, but that
was caused by one of the buildings being
struck by lightning. At the Clipper Gap ;
Works armed guards are constantly on '
watch to prevent Spanish sympathizers
from gaining access to the premises. It
is the plant at Giant, in Contra Costa
County, nineteen miles from this city,
that the company is most concerned
about. These works occupy a tract of
land of 350 acres, on which there are
eighty buildings, where the manufacture
of powders and high explosives is carried
on. The tract is on a point of land that
extends out into San Pablo Bay, and in
consequence the officers of the company
are able to guard it well.
As soon as the first signs of hostilities
made their appearance the secret service
agents of the Government requested the
officers of the company to take extra pre
cautions, for the plant is of great im
portance to the Government, it is the
only piace in the West where gelatine for
marine mines and dynamite guns is made,
borne Of the products carry over SO per |
cent of explosive. Only a few days ago a
huge order of this stuff was filled for the
Government. As a matter of fact, the
warning was hardly necessary, for the
manager, Julian Sonntag, had already
given directions to have the guard
doubled and no one allowed on the prem
ises not regularly employed there. Since
the declaration of hostilities the force of
watchmen has been increased, until near
ty' half of the force is cither a Deputy
Sheriff or a Deputy Constable.
Being situated on a peninsula, the place
is easily guarded, one watchman com
manding a view of large areas of land.
On all prominent places are fastened
signs, which read:
"Property of the Giant Powder
Company, Consolidated. Notice.
Any stranger found in the premises
of this company will be immedi
ately placed under arrest. FRANK
HOLLER, Superintendent.
"Approved, JULIAN SONNTAG,
General Manager."
Notices have also been placed on the
bay shore warning all boats and water
â¢ craft to keep away. The nearest thor
; oughfare passing the lands of the com
| pany is the railroad, that great highway
i that the tramps have grown to consider
â  ad bavlng been built for their special
| benefit. For about ten miles the weary
i wanderers are having a hard time of it at
! present. The deputies of the Giant have .
: an understanding with the officers of the
i California Powder Works at Pinole, five
: miles further up the road, by which
j every tramp is kept in motion until he is
I a long distance from either works, i
i Tramps are not allowed to stop or rest
: for a minute along the railroad track,
i which means that they have to hustle
along or go to jail. There is but little
fear of the genuine tramp, but it is very
easy for one sympathizing with the
Spanish cause to assume the garb of the
wanderer and so get near to the works
and thus be able to do mischief which
| would be of much importance to this
; Government.
In order that no other than employes of
the works may get upon the premises, a
clever system has been put into practice
by Mr. Sonntag. To each employe is
given a card, with the name, height,
weight, color of hair, eyes, etc., and other
peculiarities. These are examined very
frequently by the armed deputies. Dur
ing the night a large force is kept on
duty, and these men make regular rounds,
the same being registered by watchmen's
clocks placed at a number of points. In
speaking of the care being taken at the
works, Mr. Sonntag said: "We are not
going to take any chances of having any
thing happen. It is a valuable plant to
us and to the Government, especially at
the present time, and we believe that
while the country is more or less filled
with spies and sympathizers of Spain we
cannot be too careful as to whom we
allow upon the premises."

NEWS FROM THE FLEET.
Several private dispatches were received
in this city yesterday by friends or rela
tives of the men engaged in the battle
with the Spanish fleet off Manila. One
of the happiest men in town was McMil
lan Dutton, vice-president of the Fire
man's Fund Insurance Company. Mr.
Button is the proud lather of R. McMil
lan Dutton, first lieutenant of marines on
the Boston. The long, strained waiting
for authentic news gave way to rapturous
joy upon the receipt of a telegram from
young Dutton yesterday morning. The
dispatch was laconic, but told the story:
"Victorious; no casualties."
ADVERTISEMENTS.
A TRAVELING MAN.
Gives Some Valuable Hints Regard-
ing the Care of the Health
While Traveling.
I.lr. R. W. Wincherdon, a commer-
cial traveler from Birmingham, whose
j business keeps him almost constantly
'on the road, relates in the Sunday
! News the dangers to health resulting
! from constant change of residence and
j the way he overcame the usual injuri-
! ous effects.
He says: One thing people traveling
1 cannot very well avoid is the constant
change in water and food; the stomach
1 never has an opportunity to become
1 accustomed to anything and in a few
1 years or much sooner the average tray-
; cling man becomes a hopeless dyspeptic.
For several years I suffered more or
less from indigestion, sour stomachs,
headaches, distaste for food, often no
appetite, gas on the stomach and the
usual unpleasant effects of imperfect
digestion.
Nearly every traveling man has his
favorite remedy for different troubles
and I tried all of them with indifferent
results. Finally on the train between
Pittsburg and Philadelphia one day, I !
overheard a conversation between two
: ladies, one of whom had suffered se-
verely from indigestion and stated she
had been completely cured by a remedy
which she called Stuart's Dyspepsia !
' Tablets; I remembered the conversa- |
i tion because it directly interested me, j
â  and at the next town I inquired at the !
' first drug store ~nd bought a package I
i for 50 cents, and from that day to this j
I have never been without them. They j
i are pleasant tasC.ig tablets, not a se- |
j cret patent medicine, but composed of j
vegetable essences, pure pepsin, fruit \
'â  salts and Golden Seal; being in tablet^
form they never lose thei^ good quali- ;
\ ties like a liquid medicine- "would, but
are always fresh and ready for use.
I carry a box in my pocket continu-
ally, and whenever I see any symp-
toms of indigestion I take one, also one
after each meal, and for a year and a
half I have not lost a day by reason of |
poor health and can eat anything and i
relish what I eat; my digestion is ab- j
solutely perfect as far as I can judge
from my feelings, and although there |
may be other stomach r edicines just |
as good as Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets I
I do not know what they are. Certainly â 
for people who travel they are far j
ahead of any liquid medicine, as they
are so convenient, they can be carried
in the pocket and used whenever
needed.
I believe they are sold by all drug- â 
gists at 50 cents, and believe any one
who will try them will agree with me.
that for indigestion and stomach
trouble Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are j
unequaled. i

EXAMPLES
Of people who feel that they have secured
homes without paying for them are to be
found in the Heyman Tract. These people
were for years paying rent â adding to
their landlord's prosperity, but not a bit
to their own. Every month regularly they
paid their rent money and never had a
single thine to show for it. Now they
are paying for their homes with their
usual r^nt money â and see that every dol-
lar paid out goes to their own account.
Two new cottages of 4 and 6 rooms may
be paid for in this way. Take Misslon-st.
cars, transfer to Twenty-second, to Hoff-
man aye. and ask for Mr. James Cotter,
resident agrei t, who will show you these
â  cottages. JACOB HEYMAN, owner, 11

ACCUSED OF
NEGLECTING
HER DUTIES
Charges to Be Pre
ferred Against the
Matron.
Children Turned Over
to Abandoned
Women.
Locked Up in a Cell With
Them Owing to Her
Absence.
THE POLICE INDIGNANT.
They Threaten to Ask the Board of
Supervisors to Dismiss
Her.
Serious charges will be preferred
against Mrs. Walsh, matron of the City
Prison, to-day. She is accused of neglect
ing her duties, frequently remaining away
from the prison for hours at a time. Re
cently a number of complaints have
reached the ears of the Supervisors about
the manner in which she neglected her
duties.
It is claimed that on several occasions
women charged with crimes have been !
forced to take care of lost children on j
account of the absence of the matron.
Last night a two-year-old child named ;
Mabel Johnson, living at 17% Octavia |
street, strayed away from home and was
picked up by a policeman.
Not knowing where she lived, the of
ficer took her to the City Prison. She
was taken into the matron's room, but
as Mrs. WalÃh was not to be found the
desk sergeant was forced to turn the in
nocent child over to Mrs. Ella Yander
berg, who is confined in the City Prison
on a charge of assault with a deadly
weapon. The woman tenderly cared for j
the child until its mother arrived several |
hours later. She was indignant when I
she heard that her offspring had been j
placed in the charge of a woman accused ;
of a crime.
Mrs. Walsh returned to the prison
shortly after 11 o'clock. She explained
that she had been called away on busi
ness and forgot to tell the sergeant
where she could be found. As this is not
the first complaint that ..as been made
against her the police intend to call the
attention of the Supervisors to her seem- ;
ing dereliction of duty.
Desk Sergeant Brown last night made a
written report of the absence of the ma
tron, also stating that he was compelled
to enlist the services of Mrs. Vanderberg
to take care of the lost child.
A. short time ago a three-year-old boy
who strayed away from home was pick
ed up by a police officer and taken to the [
City Prison. Notwithstanding that Mrs.
Walsh should have been on duty,
she was not there, and the prison offi
cials were forced to place the child in the
cell occupied by women charged with va
rious crimes. They cared for him until (
his mother arrived, when the boy wat*
turned over to her.
The police are indignant over what they
term the negligence of Mrs. Walsh, and
will to-day file charges against her with
the Supervisors.
Mrs. Wal.Â«h was appointed to the nosl
tion of matron to the City Prison about
two months ago. Mrs. Gilmore was her
predecessor. The latter was dismissed to
make room for the woman who is now
charged with neglect of duty.

Mr. Huntinton was introduced by W. H.
Mills, who presided in the place of Presi
dent I. L. Requa of the Central Pacific,
who was troubled with a severe cold, and
in the course of his remarks paid a tri
bute of .respect to those who were with
them last year, but who have died in the
meantime. He alluded to Richard Gray,
Charles F. Sinurr, A. D. . Wilder and J.
J. Schriveley. He also referred ' to 'i the
gratification it gave him to see the men
together and referred to the high state
of discipline of the force, to the congenial
and harmonious relation between the ex
ecutive department and the heads of de
partments and the harmony between the
heads of the deartment and those under
their direction. :â -â â â â â â â

Toastmaster Irving M. Scott then clev
erly introduced Mr. Mills, who spoke- on
"Railroads and War." The theme was
some . contrasts and - parallels between
railroads as creative agencies and war as
â¢ a destructive agency.'. He called attention
to the defenses of this coast by. the line
of the Southern Pacific Company from
Portland to New Orleans, and showed
that the railroad absolved the country
from the : employment ; of from one ; hun
dred to two. hundred .thousand men to
protect the coast and borders in the event
of war by the facility by which â  forces
i could 'be moved from one point ; to an
other. ; He declared that it was the patri
otic duty of . every American to â . stand by
his country, right: or wrong. r -:-^t.j

STATE MINING BUREAU.
Suggestions Made as to How It Can
fie Shipped to Omaha. .
A meeting of the Omaha Exhibition
Commission was held at the office of Com
missioner General M. H. de Young yes
ter day morning:. A joint conference was
held between State Mineralogist Cooper
and Thomas Bishop, one of the trustees
of the Mining Bureau, on the question as
to whether It would be possible to take
the Mining Bureau to Omaha, and also
whether, it was possible to raise funds
and whether there was time enough to
buy and make a collection.
The conference seemed to develop Into
a continued debate with all possible solu
tions as to where the necessary money
would be procured to transport and In
stall the bureau at Omaha. Mr. de
Young stated .that if the Mining Bureau
would pack the exhibits he would agree
to provide the means for its transporta
tion and installation. It was maintained
that $20,000 placed in the treasury by the
California Commissioners to the Colum
bian Exposition could be used for the
purpose. In order to procure this money,
if possible, the commissioner general ap
pointed as tho committee to ascertain if
the money was available Thomas Bishop
and Tirey L. Ford.

one of the letter-box thieves is a woman.
It is known that Chief Lees is working on
this theory and has instructed his men to
be on the lookout for a woman dressed
in male attire.
Several weeks' ago, after breaking open
at least a dozen letter-boxes and pilfer
ing their contents, a police officer saw
the two thieves drive up to a box at Mc-
Allister and Octavia streets and proceed
to open it. He cautiously approached
them, intending to place them under ar
rest. Catching a glimpse of the officer,
the thieves jumped into a cart which they
had in waiting and furiously drove away.
The policeman at once informed Captain
Wittman of the occurrence and several
officers were sent out to try to capture
the thieving pair.
In his report to Captain Wittman the
policeman who had discovered the thieves
breaking open the mail box said that the
smaller of the two was effeminate look
ing and wore an ill-fitting black suit and
a dark slouch hat. Several nights later
the effeminate-looking person was seen
tampering with a box at Hayes and La-
Kuna streets. The red-painted cart which
the thieves use was standing across the
street. In it was the tall man, appar
ently watching for the approach of the
police. The citizen who discovered the
thief at work is convinced that the cul
prit was a woman.
Last night the police were informed
that a number of mail boxes in the West
ern Addition had been broken open dur
ing the past few days and their contents
rifled. The postal authorities are greatly
exercised over the nunjerous robberies
and are doing their utmost to arrest the
culprits.

FOR THE APPREHENSION AND CONVICTION OF THE PARTIES
WHO COMPOSED, PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTED THE FOLLOWINQ
LIBELOUS CIRCULAR:
To Members of thje Associated Bicycle Clubs.
FELLOW RIDERS: We, the committee appointed by the Executive j
Committee to make a complete and searching investigation into the rumors j
which have recently gained circulation to the effect that the "RAMBLER" 1
bicycle, manufactured by GORMULLY & JEFFERY for the past nineteen '
years, during which time it has stood high in public favor, is now being man-
ofactnred out of inferior material and put together in a very inferior man- J
ncr, and therefore unsafe for any other than boulevard riding, make the fol- ,
lowing statement:
As the matter was depmed important to both ourselA*es and the firm of j
manufacturers whose reputation for years has been of the best, your commit- j
tee decided to make a complete investigation and give GORMULLY & JEF-
FERY every opportunity to maintain the reputation so long enjoyed by the i
"RAMBLER" wheel.
Upon our visit to the offices of GORMULLY & JEFFERY we were very i
courteously received as the representatives of the Associated Bicycle Clubs,
but upon our stating our errand and that we would like to be given the oppor-
tunity to inspect the factory and construction of the "RAMBLER" wheel, we
were very plainly told that such request could not be granted and that it was
none of our business as to how the wheel was manufactured. Mr. Jeffery
talked very persistently of his high business standing and stated that the â¢
"RAMBLER" had been nineteen years on the market and that the rtqnora
(which he acknowledged were in circulation) were instigated by rival manu-
facturers. We informed him that we could very easily find out whether or not i
the "RAMBLER" was a safe wheel to ride if he would give us permission to
watch the construction of a set of them, but he declined.
Our next move was to place one of our members, who is well known to
you all, In the factory as an employe in the assembling department. He made
application and secured employment in the course of a few days and thus
had an excellent opportunity to keep his eye on the building of the "RAM- '
BLER" wheel. He spent ten days in the factory and then tendered his resig- i
nation, at which the foreman expressed regret, stating that he was c-ne of the \
â¢ best workmen in the room. x
Our report is as follows: "The 'RAMBLER' wheel of to-day in no way
compares with the 'RAMBLER' of a few years ago. Not only is the material ,
used in its construction of a poor grade, but the workmen are a very inferior
lot. Very few mechanics are employed in the factory, and none of the men Â«
who were with GORMULLY & JEFFERY when they made the wheel famous j
are with them to-day, on account, we are informed, of, the low wages paid.
"We therefore advise all members of the Association to let the 'RAM-
BLER' alone, as it is an unsafe wheel to- ride and will not stand road work."
This recommendation is made after a very careful study of the material
used and the methods of manufacturing the "RAMBLER," and we are as-
sured that the reports are true in fact and not instigated by jealous rivals, as ;
GORMULLY & JEFFERY assert. Respectfully,
JOHN CARLSON, OKIE M. CHESMAN, HENRY ARKSON.

could find no relief until she began using Ripans Tabules. The very

ALAMEDA, May 7.â At an early hour
this morning Andrew M. Braley, an aged
man, was found dead in bed in an old
cabin on the Cohen place, where he had
lived for a long time. He was found by
William and Joseph Jenkins, who, not
seeing the old man about as usual, went
to his cabin. Braley was 76 years of age

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 7.
r. R. Porter, the publisher of tho Oak
land Record, Intends to get optnion from
tho president of several State iinlvorslt." js
refci-'.rdlng blasphemy.
Mr. Porter ha: been urged to do this by
a very short note he recelvol yesterday
firm President Martin Kellogg of tho
University of California.
President Kellogg' s note reads: "Mr. F.
R. Porterâ Dear Sir: Please discontinue
sending me the Oakland Record. The ar
ticle I inclose with this I consider too
blasphemous to enter any Christian
home.
The article referred to is headed "The
Monarch of the Sun," and is as follows:
"We believe that If the sun should
cease to shine the creatures of this planet
would almost Immediately perish. Now,
the king of the sun, and therefore its
chief engineer, is a personage, we fancy,
whose name is God. What an irksome
task that potentate has, not only to keep
the sun in perfect operation, but likewise
to make this world, not to speak of other
orbs of the solar system, remain in activ
ity as the seat of grand phases, such as
the birth, career and death of human be
ings' Wherein does the sun king get
pleasure now from this globe of poisons,
diseases griefs and funerals? Years and
years ago, when the scheme was new.
then God derived mirth from the novelty
of the events characteristic of this whirl
ing mass of wonderful substances, but
ti.e show is a very familiar spectacle to
him to-day. One would think he would
be tired of the performance! One thing,
sure God deserves no bouquets for his
invention of this world's stock of disease*
and poisons. And he perpetrated a mean
joke when he decreed that the youth
should become by bodily growth and
chemical effervescence either the toUer
ing old woman or thfe tiecreplt old man.
Clearly, the monarch of the sun, what
ever may be that Individual's sex and
other personal traits, should right away
burn this planet to an ash flake or should
order that it become less a sheol and more
a heaven to every one of its transient
residents, and you and I are on thÂ« lists!
The editor declares that his effort Is in
no wav blasphemous, and he takes Issue
with President Kellogg. He will at once
send a copy of his paper containing the
alleged blasphemy to President Jordan
of Stanford and several other heads or
universities, asking their opinion. Mr.
Porter says that his ideas of things are
no more blasphemous than, and are quite
as clever as, those of several of the pro
fessors at Berkeley who are avowed
agnostics, atheists or deists.

Susie M. Littlefield Charged With
Living With C. A. Loughead.
OAKLAND, May 7.â l* G- Littlofield
has filed a suit for absolute divorce from
his wife, Susie M. Littlefield. He names
C. A. Loughead as co-respnndent, and
charges that on January 24 she left him
and went to live with Loughead. and has
continued to live with him ever since.
They were married in Rod Bluff ten
years ago. He Is a railroad employe,
well connected in East Oakland, where
he is living now. There are no children
nor community property.
Several months ago Mrs. Littlefield was
found nearly asphyxiated in a boarding
house. She denied ncr identity, and every
effort was made to conceal the facts in
the case. It now transpires that she and
her husband made up after this and lived
together until Loughead returned to the
city, he having lett at the time of the
asphyxiation. On his return Littlefield
alleges that she again turned to him and
deserted her husband. Hence this suit.

ported to be in the interests of certain dis

ing political prestige; therefore.

presses Its condemnation of such methods and
urges upon* the prosecuting attorneys of the
various courts the expediency and Justice of

I'nlon Leasfue resolution lias a peculiar
significance.

LEPERS FIGHT
IN THEIR HUT
Gee Him Tries to Kill
His Friend With
an Ax.
No One Will Arrest the Vicious
Chinaman Because of
His Disease.
May Bs Kept Imprisoned In a Little
Hut for the Rest of His
Days.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 7.
Out at the County Infirmary are two
lept-rs. At an early hour this morning
they became imbued with the Sharkey-
Jeffries spirit and started to ntfht with
fists and a hatchet.
The lepers are kept in a little cabin
about a auarter of a mile from the in
firmary toward the hills. Ah Lock and
Gee Him have been living for months in
the shaky hut, but their life has been
one of continual quarrel. They have fre
quently fought because of their fealty
to two different tongs in San Francisco.
Some weeks ago they decided to bury
their differences and live in peace, but
this morning the truce came to An end.
Gee Him procured a hatchet, went into
the part of the hut occupied by Ah Lock
and attacked him while the latter was
asleep. Lock was struck on the head sev
eral times before he jumped up and ran
off. Gee Him followed and cut at the
man whenever he could reach him, but
finally the bleeding leper met the night
watchman of the Infirmary and was
taken Into the operating room, where
Drs. Clark and Lilly dressed his injuries.
The doctors found twenty cuts on the
victim, some of them half an inch deÂ«p,
and others close to the jugular vein. It
is surprising to them that they were not
fatal.
Sheriff White was informed of the as
sault, but could see no way to arrest Gee
Him. The Sheriff could not brine the
leper inside the city limits, because he
would be restrained by the Health Offi
cer, so after a consultation with Health
Officer Dunn a deputy sheriff was de
tailed to mount guard over the pest
haunted rhanty in which Gee Him Is now
confined and from which he shows no
desire to escape.
The case involves many curious points.
Gee Him cannot be arrested and brought
to the County Jail, neither can he be
brought into the courts for trial. The
Sheriff says that he cannot maintain two
deputies, necessary to relieve each other,
at the shanty, and consequently there is
a possibility that Gee Him will go un
punished.
After a consultation with Judge Greene
tho Sheriff was advised to recommend to
the Supervisors that they immediately
authorize the construction of a separate
apartment in which to confine Gee Him.
Htalth Officer Dunn this afternoon served
the Sheriff with a notice that under no
conditions must the murderous leper be
brought within the city limits.
INDORSED BY TEACHERS.
Alameda County Educators in Sym
pathy With tlie Humane
Work.
OAKLAND, May 7.â At a called meeting
of the Alameda County Teachers' Benefit
Association held this morning in the High
School building the following resolution
was unanimously adopted:
"We, the Alameda County Teachers'
Benefit Association, desiring to express
our full sympathy with the efforts being
made to organize Red Cross societies,
hereby appoint a committee to attend the
meetings of the Central Society and to
co-operate with that society in whatever
>. department or share of the work it may
â  assign to us."
Miss Cyrinthia P. Leet of the Durant
School was elected their representative
to attend the executive committee meet
! ings. A committee of seven was appointed
on revision of \f\ constitution. The an
nuity section elected Miss L. White to fill
.the vacancy on the retirement committee.
Attached Their Own Road.
OAKLAND. May 7.â The Realty Syndi
cate to-day had attachments served on
the East Oakland Street Railroad Com
pany to satisfy a claim of $50,000. It cov
ers the real estate at Thirteenth avenue
and East Twenty-first street, all of the
tracks, equipments, franchises, rights,
permit to construct, lay down, maintain
and operate street railroads. It is a mere
legal technicality to secure the company
and enable it to consolidaie it with the
other lines now under the name of the
Oakland Transit Company.
THE BOARD OF HEALTH.
A Dairyman Whose Cows Give Two
Kinds of Milkâ The Death List.
ALAMEDA, May 7.â At the meeting of
the Board of Health la^t evening there
was a lengthy discussion over the case of
a dairyman named Gessler, whose milk
had been tested and had not given satis
factory results. It was shown that he
had two different kinds In different cans,
and that he served the best kind to his
wealthiest customers and the other kind
to the others. It was also sjijwn that
milk taken directly from the cows at
milking time gave a considerably better
rrsult than that taken from the wagons
during delivery. After considerable talk
it was decided to let the matter go over
a month, in the hope that a reconcilia
tion between samples might be effected
in the meantime.
There were thirty-three cases of con
tagious diseases during the month of
April, of which four were diphtheria and
three scarlet fever. The others were
measles and kindred diseases.
There were twenty-seven births during
Aprilâ thirteen male and fourteen female
âand there were sixteen deaths.
Chiquita One More Day.
OAKLAND. May 7. â Thousands of
school children visited Chiquita to-day
and were greatly delighted In the little
lady. Sunday is her last day here, for
on Monday she leaves for Sacramento.
No such wonder has ever been seen in
this city.

LOST HUSBAND
AND PROPERTY
Mrs. Jacobson's Demise
Followed by a
Suicide.
Not the "Widow" but "Once
the Wife" of the Ranch
Owner.
Will Not Administer the Estate for
the Benefit of Her Chil
dren.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, May 7.
Mrs. Theodore Jacobson was given a
decree of divorce a few months ago, but
the development of circumstances has
proved that by so doing she lost the es
tate of her late husband. Last November
the Jocobsons decided that they could no
longer live in harmony, so the wife ap
plied to the court and was granted a sep
aration.
Last month Jocobson became so de
spondent over the breaking up of his do
mestic relations that he ended his misery
on his chicken ranch at San Leandro
with the aid of a gun. A search was
made among his effects, but no will was
found, and Mrs. Jacobson, posing as the
widow of the suicide, attempted to secure
letters of administration upon the estate
on behalf of their children.
In her petition Mrs. Jacobson did not
allege that she was the "widow" of the
deceased, but she set forth that she "had
bf-i-n the wife of the deceased," and on
this plea she asked for legal permission
to administer upon the estate. The Pub
lic Administrator, in applying for letters,
asserted that Mrs. Jacobson. having been
divorced from her husband several
monthÃ prior to his death, had no more
claim than any purely disinterested indi
vidual to letters, as she was not the legal
guardian of the heirs, to whom the estate
naturally reverts.
Mrs. Jacobson then tried to upset the
Public Administrator's argument by ap
plying for and obtaining letters of guard
ianship over the children, and on the
strength of this move she anticipated no
trouble in securing permission to handle
the estate.
The Public Administrator, however, was
granted letters of administration upon
the ground that although xurs. Jacobson
was the guardian of the children there
was nothing in her petition for letters at
the time it was heard to show she had
acquired such jurisdiction over the heirs.

On that day a great matinee perform
ance will be given for the benefit of the
fund to equip the California volunteers
who have been called into active ser

manager of the amusement house, has
been most generous in his offer, saying:
'"Every cent that is taken in at the box
office and from the sale of seats will
go to the fund. Not one nickel is to
be taken from it for expenses." The
house is at the disposal of the Red
Cross for that afternoon and the corps
of performers who have made the the
ater so popular have gladly supported
Mr. Walter in his offer. Every mem
ber of the company promises some spe
cialties that will make the performance
one of more than ordinary interest. The
members of the orchestra have joined
with the manager of the house and the
performers and they will gladly give
their services for the afternoon, and
oftener if required. The Orpheum peo
ple have made a generous offer and
many a soldier who goes to the front
may have reason, when in a far-off
land, to be thankful to the merry mak

Miss Ida Kervan, the most patriotic
of San Francisco's school teachers, ad
diessed a meeting of her fellow edu
cators yesterday at the Girls' High
School. She made a spirited little taik
on the urgency of the work already
so well begun by the Red Cross So
ciety, and explained to the assembled
teachers the plan adopted at the Wash-
inpton Grammar School.
"You will find it the simplest, the
most natural thing in the world to in
terest the children in this. In fact, at
our school, for a week before we sug
gested this plan, the children had been
coming to me to beg me to go to see
the School Board and find out what
they rould do. This is not the time for
entertainments and that sort of thing-.
The need is immediate. Many teachers
to whom I have spoken agree with me
that the public school children could
and would furnish all the first aid
packets required by our soldiers who
will soon be on their way to the Philip
pines."
Miss Kervan's address was listened to

i plauded. No douht the pledge origin

meeting of the executive committee in

Surgeon General Hopkins of the Cali
fornia volunteers sent word to the com
mittee that the soldiers now in camp at
the Presidio were in urgent need of
three field operating cases, nine field
operating tables, nine emergency cases
for hospital stewards and 2000 first aid
packages. The cost of the supplies were
estimated at about $800. The funds at
the disposal of the society amounted to
about $100 less than the estimate, but
it was thought that the committee
could guarantee the difference and a
resolution was unanimously adopted
empowering the surgeon general to
make the needed purchases and have
the bills sent to the Red Cross Society
The field operating cases contain com
plote sots of surgical instruments and
the two regiments as they are now in
camp are almost totally unprovided to
give aid to any of their members should
an accident occur to any of them. The
purchases will be made at once and
emergencies at present provided for.
Thore was a good attendance at the
mooting and every one present urged
the necessity of immediate work. At
tr-r.tion was called to the fact that thore
were now about 2000 men in camp nt
the Presidio who were in a few days,
possibly within a week, to b" sent to
Manila. They were totally unprovided
for emergencies in case of accident. It
was shown that the Gnvernmoi.t would
supply them with many of thÂ« nÂ»ed>t!
instruments and other necessaries, but
they would be inadequate in an ex>
Ime emergency. The Red Cross was
to supplant the Government, but to
Ist. The necessities for the ex'rem*
ergencies the Red Cros Society
would have to supply or let the Cali
fornia boys go to the front where they
would probably endure much suffering
which by a little forethought might be
avoided.

were enlarged and suggestions given
them what lines to pursue. One opin
ion was entertained by them ali, and
that was that money was needed, and
needed at once. Estimates made by the
surgeons of the volunteers placed the
sum at about $9000, and if the purpose
of the society was to be carried out
with the greatest success it was to be
raised within the next four days.
It was announced that the six lead
ing daily papers of the city would open
subscription lists at once at their
offices, and the large stores and other
public places would be asked to do the
same thing. A vote of thanks was
unanimously tendered to the managers
of the Orpheum Theater for their gene
rous offer.
Charles L. Barrington, the president
of the School Board, announced that
the children of the schools would be
given an opportunity to aid as much
as It was in their power. He said the
rules of the School Department would
possibly be stretched to allow them to
contribute. That action cm the part of
the board might be criticized to some
extent, but under the circumstances he
thought the emergency justified it.
At the request of the society a tele
gram was sent to Colonel Otis of Los
Angeles asking him to take the initia
tive to establish some society in South
ern California that would assist the
work of the Red Cross.
44 Comfort Bags" for the
Soldiers.
BERKEI-ET, May 7.â A small army of
workers, members of the Berkeley High
School Sanitary Commission, is busy
making "comfort bags" for the soldiers
who are likely soon to leave for the Phil
ippines. Accompanying each bag will ne
a carefully prepared antiseptic bandage,
suitable for immediate use by wounded
soldiers. The "comfort bags" are intend
ed to be used for carrying trifling con
veniences for the soldier boys, and al
ready hundreds of them have been made
by the Berkeley students.
COLORS FOR THE
REGIMENTS.
Elegant Presents to Be
Made by the Chamber
of Commerce.
Several members of the Chamber of
Commerce have decided to present the
First and Seventh Regiments with regi
mental colors. The movement was start
ed by a letter from William Macdonald,
who wrote the following to Hugh Craig,
the president of the chamber:
Sir: As the Flrft Resriment of VolunteÂ«rs
enlisted for the war Is composed pxoluslvely of
men and officers taken from the First Regi
ment Infantry. K. O. C, the only regiment of
the National Guard in this city, It has occurred
to me that It would be a patriotic and proper
thing for the Chamber of Commerce to present
to the regiment Its colors. If It is necessary
to make a collection for this purpose and the
officers of the Chamber of Commerce will un
dertake It. I shall he pleased to subscribe.
Yours very respectfully,
WII-MAM MACDOXALD.
The idea was considered to be excellent,
and in a very short time Mr. Craig and
a number of others had the project well
under way. The colors, flags, etc.. will
be forthcoming in very short order as a
token of esteem from the Chamber of
Commerce. The date of thÂ« presentation
has not yet been set, ouv n is safe to say
that within a few days the bright new
colors will be floating at the heads of the
San Francisco and Los Angeles regi
ments.
THE CALL'S BEACON.
OAKLAND, May 7.â A bright glare in
the sky to the westward of this city to
night caused many to believe a big fire
was raging. It was soon learned that the
fire was across the bay and a little in
vestigation disclosed the fact that it was
the red tire on The Call building that was
being burned in honor of Admiral Dewey's
great victory. The air was clear on the
bay and the brilliant light could easily
be seen twenty miles. All around the bay
shore to Pinole Point the red fire and its
reflection in the aky could be seen high
above the ordinary glare of the city's
lights. From the foot of Broadway the
Bignal of victory furnished a fine display
and sent a distinct pathway of light
across the bay that united the two cities
with a silvery brilliancy.

USED POISON AND PISTOL
William G, Kroeger, the Well-to-Do Coffee and Suice
Merchant, Who Shot and Poisoned Himself on the
Ocean Beach,
William G. Kroeger of 2822 Bush street told his wife and son last Thurs
day evening that he was going out for a walk. He was not seen again until
yesterday noon, when his body was found on the Cliff House beach
with a revolver In his hand and a bullet wound in the head.
Sixteen years ago the deceased went into partnership with Charles F.
Thlerbach in the coffee and spice business at 306 Battery street. On March
18 of this year the partners decided that they could not agree as to the
management of the business, and the firm was dissolved, Kroeger receiv
ing $10,500 as his share of the business. Kroeger placed the money in bank
and took life easily with his wife and son Fred, the latter a man 23 years
of age.
For some time prior to the dissolution of copartnership, Kroeger and his
partner had some dispute concerning Kroeger's neglect of the business.
He did not devote that time and attention to it which was expected of him
by Mr. Thierbach, and a satisfactory arrangement not having been reached,
they agreed to dissolve the firm and Kroeger received $10,500 for his interest.
The business has been conducted since under the name of Charles F. Thler
bach & Co.
The deceased paid two or three visits to his old' partner after they sepa
rated, but he had not been near the store for several weeks.
His wife said yesterday that hÂ« had been fidgety and out of sorts ever
since he retired from the firm, but neither she nor her son had the remotest
suspicion that he was despondent or contemplated making away with
himself. He was in good humor when he left his house last Thursday
night with the remark that he was going out for a little walk. He was not
at all financially embarrassed, for he had the greater part of the $10,500
in bank.
When the body was found yesterday a bottle half full of carbolic acid
was found lying by his side. It bore the label of Shumates' Pharmacy, cor
ner of Sutter and Devlsadero streets. On the ground near the body was
lying a pasteboard box which had contained the pistol, which was a new one
of Smith & Wesson's make and haxnmerless of 38-callber. There was also
a box of fifty cartridges, from which six and heen taken and placed in the
revolver. It was evident that the dead man had purchased the weapon
just before killing himself. Before firing the fatal shot he had swal'Owed a
large quantity of carbolic acid.
The reason why the remains were not discovered sooner was because
they were hidden by a clump of bushes nearly opposite Haggerty's resort
and north of the Life Saving Station.

SHARKEY TALKS OUT.
ThÂ« Usual Attachments Hays Fol
lowedâJeffries Is Declared
to Be a Dub.
It will without doubt be a difficult
undertaking to fasten the blame for
the accident at the Mechanics' Pavilion
Friday night on any one party or par
ties. What might have been a terrible
disaster resulted fortunately In a few
bruises and fractured limbs, but peo
ple in general believe that some one
should be held accountable for those
bruises and pay damages for the In
juries sustained. All parties who were
connected in any way with the ar-
GREGGAINS "TALLIED"
SHARKEY FAIRLY OUT
Referee Alec Greggains was busy yesterday explaining why he decided
as he did and receiving the congratulations of many hundred friends who
admired his manly stand. He stated that he had warned the men before
they went into the ring that there must be a decision, as the agreement
called for one, and they both replied that that was just what they wanted.
He also told them that if one man did all the work for fifteen rounds and
in the last five the other was to make a fast finish the man who held
back would have to make a big showing to git the decision. This was also
agreed to.
"I pave a decision in favor of Jeffries, because I thought him justly en
titled to it. The fact that there was many thousands bet in the pool
rooms on Sharkey did not affect me in the least. Henry Quigg, my
brother-in-law, and my sister had money on Sharkey, as also did my best
friends, but this did not deter me. I kept tab during the progress of the
fight, and when, at the end of the twentieth round, I summed up, I could
not decide otherwise."
Mr. Greggains then produced the score card that he used during the
interesting argument, and explained his reasons for giving Jeffries a de
cision. "In the first found," he said, "both men fought evenly, and I
wrote the word 'even' under both names. Jeffries had the best of it in the
second, third and fourth. In the fifth I wrote 'even Jeffries a little," mean
ing that Jeffries had a shade the best of the round. The sixth went to
Jeffries and the seventh was an even break. I made it a point to give
Sharkey the best of it at times, and in the eierhth I wrote Sharkey. Jef
fries took the ninth, while the tenth round was about even. The eleventh
and twelfth went to Jeffries. The thirteenth was marked 'even Jeffries,'
meaning that he had a little the best of it. Jeffries did the most work
in the fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth rounds, while in the seventeenth
Sharkey improved and I marked it 'even.' In the eighteenth and nine
teenth rounds I thought Jeffries did the most work and placed his name
opposite those numbers.
"I did not mark the twentieth round, as I always tallied during the
minute's rest. "With the score before me and from my knowledge of th<>
game, I thought there was only one man in the fight and his name waÂ»
Jeffries. In my opinion Jeffries could have put Sharkey out had his hands
been in good condition. He had him groggy two or three times an<J
should have followed him up."
rangement of the seats or the seating
of the larfrp <â~~ fl which crushed into
the Pavilion to see Sharkey and Jef
fries punch one another, attempt to
throw the responsibility on other shoul
ders.
Gibbs and Groom, of the National
Club, regret that the accident hap
pened, but feel relieved that no fatali
ties occurred. Th^y state that all pre
cautions which any one could take were
taken by them, as they had the con
struction of the seats carefully exam
ined by members of the Fire Depart
ment, who were stated to be compet
ent judges of temporary or permanent
work. To have had a fatal accident
occur would have resulted in compli
cations hard to realize, but as the seats
were built by a contractor and then
collapsed when the audience was seat
ed the club will hold him responsible
for the accident, and. in consequence,
Contractor Doran will not be paid for
his work. He called on Mr. Groom yes
terday afternoon, but was referred to
Gibbs, and it was decided to withhold
all money due the contractor.
"We are not contractors, mechanical
engineers or judges of such a construc
tion as was built in the Pavilion for
the seating of the public who witnessed
the fight," paid Mr. Groom yesterday,
"but we had the work examined, and
after the examination and a few
changes It was passed upon and we
felt content. The accident Is a most
regretable one, but those who did the
work and passed upon it are without
doubt responsible. We did not let bids
for the work, but hired Doran, as he
is connected with the Mechanics' In
stitute, and we were well aware that
he would be given time to make a good
job of it. After figuring on the work
Doran was told to gn ahead and to
leave out fancy flourishes, but to make
the work strong and as durable as if
it would be left there for months to
come. When the work was passed on
we were of the opinion that our In
structions had been carried out. but
unfortunately they were not."
Mr. O'Shaughnessy states that he ex
amined the work, and after a few ma
terial changes had been made, passed
upon it and had watched the work
every day from Tuesday up to the
night of the fight. When he left the
building the ushers were in their places
and all made ready for the admission
of the public. "I cannot account for
the accident," he said, "but I have been
told the place was overcrowded, but
am unable to state so, as I was not in
the building after the doors were
opened."
The heads of the Fire Department
were also notified that the seats were
being built in the Pavilion by J. M.
Cumings, secretary of the Mechanics'
Institute, at the instigation of Charles
M. Plum, chairman of the' Pavilion
committee, and after that they felt
content, as they could not be held re
sponsible, as the building had been
rented to the club for the night on
which the accident occurred.
There are many in the audience who
are much more battered up than the
fighters themselves, and during the day
a string of people who were slightly
injured called on Gibbs and Groom and
were referred to the club's physician for
treatment.
Neither Sharkey nor Jeffries shows
any signs of having fought a long, hara
battle, and both were up and about yes
terday.
In all probability an investigation
will be held to account for the acci
dent which might have resulted in hun
dreds of deaths, and the only remark
able thing is that not even one unfortu
nate lover of fisticuffs did lose his
life on the eventful night which is
thought of only with a shudder. To
see a long tier of seats, filled with hu
manity, closing up like a fan and then
sink to the floor is a blood-curdling
sight, and those who were on the seats
will remember the accident for many
a day to come. All evidences of the
accident have been removed and now
preparations for the Masonic Festival
are under way in the large hall.
Yesterday afternoon Captain Witt
man made a report to the Chief of Po
lice, in which he states that at the time
the last two platforms fell neither of
them had over two-thirds of the seat
ing capacity filled and that the aisles
were clear.
The talk over town is equally divided
between the accident and the fight.
There are many who believe that the
fight should have been declared a draw,
but others agree with. Referee Greg
gains, and say that Jeffries can whip
Sharkey any mark of the road. Shar
key is chagrined over the decision, an
says that he was cheated by the referee
and that Jeffries is a dub.
Sharkey met Greggains in front of
Groom's place of business on Market
street yesterday afternoon, and the
conversation was exceedingly pointed,
but anything but complimentary.
"I tell you," said Sharkey, with his
finger under the referee's nose, "that
you will rue the day you gave the de
cision to that duffer, whom I battered
around the ring.
"Look at me without a dollar or a
scratch on me. and the other fellow
has got a purse that did not belong
to him. I will give it to you good and
hard whenever ~nd wherever I get a
chance. You threw me down hard
but no harder than I will throw you
whep the proper time comes. I did all
the fighting from start to finish and
got away without a scratch, and yet
you decided against me." At this junc
ture Sharkey was taken away by some
of his friends. It is thought by the
majority of sporting r^^je tnat G re ~_
gains acted in the way he thought best
but many criticize his judgment
Sharkey declares that he' has fought
his last fight in this cltv and that he
will not fight a return match as he
knows he can't get it ~- - states that
Jeffries is afraid to again enter the
ring with him.
Supervisor Sheehan was a witness to
the exciting scenes that occurred at the
Pavilion last night, and Is very much
disgusted thereat. In speaking about
the affair, he said: "I wish to be quot
ed as being emphatically opposed to
granting fight permits In future. I
have always been the first to vote in
favor of them, but last night's terrible
scenes have disgusted me. If the Su
pervisors decide to give their consent
for more fights, you can rest assured
that it will only be on condltÂ«->Â»>Â« that
the parties asking for a privilege will
give strong assurances that the seat
ing arrangements will be properly
looked after. The Chief of Police and
the Chief of the Fir- Department will
then make a thorough inspection of the
seating capacity, and if satisfactory to

Suit was instituted yesterday In the

to recover $40. It is alleged that W. P. :

Fuller purchased four tickets to see the ,

were refused admission. The suit is to
recover the price of the tickets. An

Corporal Goiman last night made the
following report to Chief Lees:
I was present at the fteht between Jeffries
and Sharkey. I was seated on a raised seat
about twenty feet from the southwest corner
Of the rinf?. My attention was attracted by the ,
breaking; of timbers of the raised se;Us at the ;
west end of the building. I saw the whole â¢
thing and venture the assertion that not two- j
thirds of the chairs were occupied. As soon j
aÂ« the crash came at the easterly row of ,
chairs I glanced in that direction and saw that j
only a few persons were occupying seats in
that particular part of the building.
Sergeant Nash has also made a report '
of the accident. In it he says:
I -walked through the Pavilion on the after
noon of the flf?ht and noticed that the stud
dlnK that supported the seats was rather lipht
and not properly braced. The carpenters were ,
working at the time and District Engineer j
Shaughnessy was superintending the work. I
mentioned this fact to Captain Wlttman.
Detective Jeremiah Dinan, In his report '
to the Chief, says: "Sergeant Campbell. ;
Police Officer Joe Burnett and myself ;
went on the platform on the east sido of
the Pavilion. We mot Judge Allen and
Attorney Garrity of Oakland. The latter
asked us if we thought the platform was
safe. "We replied in the negative and at
once left the scene. A few minutes later
the platform gave way. precipitating the
unfortunate occupants of the seats to the
floor. I am convinced that two-thirds of â¢
the chairs were unoccupied at the time." ;
The above reports were made to refute
the assertion of the officials of the Fire j
Department that the police did not do
their duty. They claimed that all the j
seats were occupied and it was the duty !
of the police to have stopped the club
managers from allowing the seats to be
occupied, realizing that the platform had
been constructed in a flimsy manner.

-- 1 IQ MONTGOMERY ST.. S.F..CALGLORIOUS VISIT OF NEPTUNE ON BOARD THE BATTLE-SHIP OREGON.
When the Oregon Crossed "the Line" Recently on .Her Way to doin the Atlantic Squadron Before Cuba She Was .Met by .Neptune and .His Beautiful Wife Jlmphitrite. It Was Such a fireat Occasion
Tftat the Battle-Ship for a Time Was Turned Over to .Neptune and Jiis Retinue. What Followed Is Told Below by Lieutenant Edward W. Eberle, Officer of the Vessel.
NEPTUNE TOOK HIS POSITION ON THE BRIDGE WITH HIS STOFF. fIND ON THE DECK BELOW WAS RIGGED A BIG SOIL FULL OF THE SALTIEST KIND OF SALT WATER; THEN THE BEARS AND WOLVES
PLUNGED INTO THE WAITER fIND WERE READY FOR THE FIRST VICTIM.
U. S. Battleship Oregon,
At Sea, I,at. 00, 00 Long. W.,
Thursday, March 31, 1898.
My Dear Little Sailorman â When a
ship crosses the "line" (equator), His
Majesty, King Neptune, comes on
board to Inspect the officers and men,
ard if he finds any strangers among
them, he proceeds to initiate them with
great pomp and ceremony and make
them pay tribute to his supreme power.
The regions along the "line" are ruled
by King Neptune, the Ruler of the Seas,
and his power can never be questioned
by any one, and woe to '*:e landsman
that hesitates to pay tribute to His
The Call Sunday Edition
Majesty.
Every one who crosses the "Hue" for
the first time is initiated by Neptune,
and Is ever afterward a son of the sea
and a faithful subject of the King and
is never forgotten by Neptune.
The evening before we crossed the
"line," as we were quietly steaming
along through summer seas, with the
band playing am 1 the men singing, there
came a thundering voice from the sea,
which shouted, "Ship ahoy!" and the
officer of the deck answered, "Aye,
aye."
Then the voice from the sea shouted
"TVhat ship la that?" and it was
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, MAY 8, 1898.
answered, "The United States Battle
ship Oregon."
"Whence come ye?" said the strange
voice. "From San Francisco," was re
plied.
"Whither are ye bound?" again was
asked.
"Across the 'line' to the Southern
Seas," was answered.
Then out of the sea arose a man
dressed in seaweeds, and on board he
came, and stated that he was the of
ficial representative of "His Majesty
King Neptune, and desired to see the
captain, saying that the ship would en
ter the King's domains next day and
that Neptune would makf his custom
ary visit on board. Then the represen
tative disappeared into the sea, and we
began to make grand preparations to
receive King Neptune.
This mornL.g I was officer of the
deck and about 9 o'clock I shouted to
the officer on the forecastle (through
the trumpet):
"Keep a bright lookout ahead for the
line, sir!" and the answer came, "Aye,
aye. sir!"
All was bustle and excitement about
the decks now, making preparations
for his Majesty and the many land
lubbors who had never crossed the
"line" were very nervous, for they had
been told blood-curdling tales of how
Neptune initiated all strangers into his
domains.
All hands were on deck keeping a
lookout for the ruler of the seas, when
the officer of the forecastle shouted out
to me:
"The line in sight right ahead, sir!"
and I answered:
"Very well, sir, keep a sharp lookout
for his Majesty King Neptune!" and
In another moment came .he word:
"The King is in sight ah id, sir!"
and I answered:
"Ask his Majesty to come on board,
sir!"
And then out of the sea and over
the ship's b ws came Neptune with his
numerous staff.
I invited his Majesty to walk aft on
the quarterdeck, where he would be of
finially received by the captain, officers
and crew.
Th-n I called "All hands to muster,"
the most formal ceremony on a man
of-war, where all the officers and men
assemble on the quarterdeck and I re
ported to the captain the arrival on
board of King Neptune.
The captain ->ceived the King on the
quarterdeck in the presence of the of
ficers and crew and turned over the
ship to him.
Neptune introduced his wife, Amphi
trite, and the members uf his staff,
and then he made a short speech, in
which he stated that he had never be
fore been on board such a great battle
ship and that when he first sighted her
he did not know whether it was some
new American up-to-date sea serpent
or 'a fort adrift upon the seas, as he
had always been aecustnme to ships
with masts and sails â an ho had not
ordered a floating lighthouse, which he
took our military mast to be.
Then 'ie looked around at tl. â  crew
and remarked with a cynical grin that
he saw many strange faces on board.
which caused the poor land-lubbers to
tremble with fear. He serenely re
marked that he did not suppose that
more than a dozen land-lubbers out of
the three hundred on board would be
killed as a sacrifice (wnereat their
knees knocked together with fright)
and that his initiation would so aarden
and toughen them that they would
consider Spanish bullets a mere picnic
party and they would be able to stand
anything hereafter.
Neptune had with him his wife. Am
phitrite, his secretary, his judge, his
barber, meri.iaids, a lot of big, burly
sea policemen and a number of bears
and wolves, all dressed in costumes of
seaweed, shells, barnacles and star
fishes.
Old Neptune had long white hair and
a beard and he looked very much like
Santa Claus, but he was dressed in
seaweed and salt Instead of furs, as
the weather here is so warm; and In
stead of a si igh and reindeer he travels
in a large shell drawn by beautiful sea
horses and he goes like the wind. For
binocular glasses Neptune had two
large empty beer bottles and he said
he could see a long distance with them.
Amphitrite also has whito hair, about
the color of new -->re and a'l . trough
her hair are brilliant crystals of salt.
After Neptune concluded his speech
he took his position on the fore and art
bridge with his staff and on the deck
below was rigged a big sail filled with
good salt water of the most salty kind.
The bears and the wolves plunged
into this water and were ready for the
first victim.
Neptune's secretar- had a Hs J of the
officers an^ men and he began with the
captain, who appeared before Neptune.
The judge then looked up the records
and found that the captain had crossed
the line before and had duly paid trib
ute, whereupon Neptune congratulated
him ~nd the next officer was called.
None of the midshipmen had crossed
the line and they all acknowledged the
authority of Neptune and offered trib
ute and were given certificates with
Neptune's seal, like the one I send you.
After they had gone through the list
of officers they called the first sailor
man on the list of uninitiated and the
big policemen brou ht the trembling
victim before the King, giving him a
good taste of their clubs on the way.
There the judge made a speech, in
which he stated that those who sur
vive - this ordeal would be ever after
hardy followers of Neptune. He cau
tioned the men to sweep the Spaniards
from the sea, as every time Neptune
had visited a Spanish ship he had been
made very sick by the odor of garlic
and vile cigarettes. For this insult to
royalty he demanded that his subjects
hereafter must s^ek vengeance. He
also cautioned his North American sub
jects against the two most noted pro
ducts of South America, fleas and yel
low dogs, and stated that a thick coat
ing of salt wouid art a* a counter
irritant fir .ea bites and would make
a yellow dog so sea sick that he would
not bite a second time.
After his speech he turned to the
first victim and in stern, deep voice
told him of the grave responsibility he
was about to assume in becoming a
follower of Neptune, and then he or
dered his men to proceed with the
ceremony. i
The victim was placed on a stool with
his b_ck to the sail filled h water.
Neptune's barber lathered his face and
head with a mixture of flour meal and
molasses, using a whitewash brush,
and then shaved the poor victim with
a large wooden razor, after which the
man was dumped over backward into
the water on the deck below and there
the wolves and bears ducked him and
beat him with paddles until he was
almo t strangled, after which he was
thrown out on deck and received his
certificate ? a Son of Neptune.
Over two hundred men were put
through this ram- ordeal, Â£id those
who fought or resisted were clubbed
by the policemen and given a double
dose.

DOWNALLDITTYBOXES,
Secretary-
Done at royal court, on the
Equator, this 31st day of March.
IS9S. according to earthly compu
tation.
The policenv n went all through the
ship searching for the victims and not
one land-lubber ; scaped.
Cheer after chter went v; as eacÃ
man was shu% - ed *d duel d and Nep
tune gave additional attentioâ to thosÂ»
whom he called the "freshest of the
fr^sh, who are fy freshy."
It took Neptune until 3 o'clock in thai
afternoon to initiate all the land-luÃ-.
bers, and he said that he had never
before struck such a rich harvest, aa
the crew was such a large one.
He recognized me as an old friend of
hi^. for you see I have crossed the
â¢"line" more than twenty-five times,
and in the Pacific, the Atlantic and the,
Indian Oceans, so old Neptune knows
me very well and he looks the same dfl
he did when he gave me my certificate*
more than thirteen years ago.
I told him about you and he gave va9
a certificate for you, but said that you
would have to pay tribute and get an*
other certificate when you crossed the
"line ' for the fir t time. He said hÂ»
hoped you would become a naval office*
like your father.
He made a farewell speech, wlshe*
us a pleasant cruise, said we would al
ways be welcome to his domains and
then disappeared into the sea. Amphi
trite sent her best love to mother and
said she would like to send her one of
her beautiful salt crystals, but that
Neptune would be angry if she should
give away the jewels he had given her,
so mother must do without the salt
crystals.
You must not worry, for the Span
iards cannot harm father's ship and wÂ»
will soon be together again, either on
the Eastern Coast or in San Francisco*
Your devoted father,
EDWARD EBERLE SR.
"What in the world are they flghtinff
about, anyway?" asked a young girl iv
an Atlanta store Saturday morning.
"For liberty, my dear child," replied
a companion with an air of superiority.
"Our country must not be insulted by
the Italians."
"I thought it was the Spaniards,*
mildly protested the first speaker.
"Well, they are all the same. It
makes no difference who it is we are
fighting, it is the principle of the thing
we are after."
"Has anybody been shot yet?" asked
the first speaker.
"I really didn't read the news clearlyj
this morning," was the reply.
Then they turned their attention to
the bargain counter, and the war waa
totally forgotten.18
FAMOUS AMERICAN BATTLE CRIES.
REMEMBER the Maine," Com
modore Schley's now famous
signal of attack on the Spanish
fleet, will undoubtedly become
immortal in American history,
in the history of the English
speaking peoples in fact, for as an ap
peal to patriotism it is as thrilling as
was Nelson's battle cry at the Nile.
â¢'England expects that every man will
do his fluty."
During the 132 years of our existence
as a nation the commodores, captains
and other officers of the navy have
made a magnificent contribution of
patriotic phases to our war literature.
As the terse embodiment of popular
sentiment in trying situations and
emergencies, they are not surpassed by
expressions of a like character in any
language.
The sea fighters started in this line at
the very beginning of the revolution, in
fact, before that tremendous struggle
with the mother country was begun.

Sir James Wallace of the British frig

DEADLY USE OF THE TORPEDO IN WAR.
TORPEDO warfare began during
the American civil war, but so
crude were the early torpedoes
and so little opportunity has there
since been to study the action of
modern torpedoes in actual war
that naval officers all over Europe have
looked forward eagerly to a war be
tween the United States and Spain as
an object lesson. That the torpedo
years ago passed the experimental
stage and stands to-day as the most
wonderful and terrible of modern
engines of war is not to be doubted,
but it has had no real test of its
power. Not one torpedo has been fired
in warfare by any of the leading naval
powers in more than twenty years, and
so great has been the advance in tor
pedo construction within this time that
the early tests are of little value to the
present student of naval affairs.
Since the torpedo became a machine
of precision it has been used in war
fare only by insurrectionists and weak
nations. The war between China and
Japan three years ago gave some idea
of the value of the torpedo, but neither
its full value nor its place could be de
termined in that short and unequal
contest between two half-civilized na
tions.
Thirty-seven torpedo attacks have
been made thus far, sinking a dozen
ships and damaging one other. Six as
sailant boats have been at.
The Whitehead torpedo record only
is interesting, for it is the only auto
mobile torpedo which has ever been
used in war and is practically the only
torpedo in use to-day. The United
States was the last leading nation to
adopt the Whitehead, the Navy Depart
ment delaying action with the hope
that an American engineer would pro
duce the Whitehead's equal, until a
half-dozen years a?o the navy's imper
ative need of torpedoes forced the
adoption of the Whitehead.

The new American Whiteheads now
building for the Government in Brook
lyn, are distinctively American torpe
does, although made under licenses
from the original Whitehead Company
at Fiume, Hungary, the birthplace of
the Whitehead.
At the time of the outbreak of the
American civil war Captain Lupuis, an
Austrian naval officer, submitted to his
Government the first automobile tor
pedo. It was run by clockwork and
guided from shore by ropes. The Gov
ernment liked the idea, but recom
mended the selection of a better motive
power and a simpler means of guiding.
Three years later Lupuis met White
head, then manager of an engine man
ufacturing company at Fiume, and ex
hibited his torpedo plans. Whitehead,
with the assistance of his son and a
skilled mechanic, secretly made the
first Whitehead torpedo, and two years
later submitted it to the Austrian Go â¢
eminent. Externally it had the ap
pearance of a modern .torpedo: its
weight was 300 pounds and it carried
a charge of eighteen pounds of dyna
mite. A compressed air chamber,
charged to a pressure of 700 pounds to
the square inch, supplied the motive
power. For short distances the torpe
do attained a speed of six knots.
The Austrian ordnance officers were
enthusiastic over the torpedo, although
it was a very crude affair. The Gov
ernment was too poor to buy it out
right, but paid for the right to make
the torpedo after Whitehead's plans.
England a year later secured the right
to make the torpedo. France, Italy and
Germany followed. England has man
ufactured the Whitehead on a large
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 8, 1&93.
scale at the Royal Laboratory at Wool
wich and at the Whitehead factory at
Portland, about 6000 having been Issued
to the navy. A few months ago the
manufacture of torpedoes in England
was abandoned, and the English ad
miralty now imports its torpedoes from
the two European factories, one in Ger
many and the other in Fiume, Hun
gary. The Brooklyn, Fiume and Ger
man factories are the only places where
Whitehead torpedoes are now made.
The new American Whitehead not
only has the power to blow up any ship
afloat, but its intricate and delicate
mechanism makes certain its path un
der the water. The variations from its
course are so slight that it can be fired
from the launching tube with the same
confidence in its ability to reach the
target as when the seacoast artillery
man fires a steel shell from a heavy
gun. The torpedo is built of steel in the
shape of a porpoise, with a big double
bladed tail. Ready for firing it weighs
1160 pounds, but its weight in the water
is but a half pound. Its length is about
16 feet 5 inches; its greatest diameter
17.7 inches. It is assembled in four sec
tions â the head, airflask and immersion
chamber, after body and tail â all fitted
together with sleeve joints and held to
gether by joint screws. The walls are
made of the finest forged steel, to re
sist the enormous air pressure. Bronze
bulkheads separate the sections. Near
the after end of the air flask is a bulk
head of the small immersion chamber.
The after body is also divided into two
compartments, so that in all there are
five compartments within the torpe
do's shell.
Compressed air is the motive power.
This is contained within the air flask,
a hollow forged steel cylinder nearly
half as long as the torpedo, slightly
tapering at the ends, with dome-shaped
heads screwed and soldered in each
end. On shipboard this flask is filled
by an air compressing engine, and the
pressure attained is 1350 pounds to the
square inch. The flask is tested for a
pressure of 2000 pounds. This great
pressure so compresses the air that the
weight of the ten cubic feet in the
flask is 69.19 pounds.
The engine consists of three cylinders
radiating out from the propeller shaft
like a three-leaf clover. The cylinders
coujd be carried in one's overcoat
pocket, but they have a combined
power of thirty horsepower.
Between the air flask and engine is a
reducing valve, operated from the ex
terior. This valve is balanced between
a spring tending to raise it and the
pressure of air on the top tending
to seat It. By screwing a crank
the spring is compressed, and the pres
sure of the air admitted to the engine
fixed for the run. The highest speed
LAUNCHING A TORPEDO AT THE ENEMY FROM THE SIDE OF fl TORPEDO-BOAT.
Majesty's ship, the Gaspe, sent the
laconic reply to Sir James: "Always
catch a man before you hang him."
The lion-hearted Whipple, who, in
the preceding war with France, in his
privateer, the Gamecock, had captured
in a single year twenty-three French
prizes, voiced in that defiant answer
the sentiments of all the rebels in the
colonies that catching them was an es
sential preliminary to the hanging busi
ness.
Who first raised the American flag on
a ship of war is one of the disputed
questions of history. John Adams
claimed the honor for Captain John
Manly, a New Englander. Paul Jopea
asserted that "my (his) hand first
hoisted the American flag." He was
then a lieutenant on the frigate Alfred.
There were several American flags at
the time, and Paul Jones does not de
scribe his particular one. Some histo
rians think it was the pine tree and
rattlesnake flag with the motto: "An
appeal to God; don't tread on me."
Others assert that it was a flag con
sisting of thirteen stripes, with the
motto, "Don't tread on me," and a
rattlesnake stretched diagonally across
them.
"I have not yet begun to fight," was
one of Commodore Jones' famous re
plies to a British captain with whom he
had been fiercely engaged for over an
hour, and who desired to know if he
had surrendered. It was not Jones who
surrendered when the battle came to an
end. That was the celebrated engage
ment between the Serapis and the Bon
homme Richard. The captain of the
Serapis having been knighted for his
gallantry on that occasion by George
111, Jones, when he heard of the pro
obtainable is twenty-eight knots for 800
yards. At a less speed the torpedo may
be sent 2000 yards. Air is admitted to
the reducing valve by means of
a starting lever. Before the tor
pedo is launched this lever lies flat
on top of the shell, the end pointing
forward. When the torpedo is launched
the starting lever catches under a
tripping latch in the launching tube
and is thrown back..
For an instant after the torpedo
leaves the launching tube it is in the
air. Were the full power of the com
pressed air turned into, the engines by
the throwing back of the starting lever
thÂ» propellers would revolve like a fly
wheel without a governor until they
were under water. Injury would result
to the machinery. This is obviated by
the retarding gear in the engine-room.
The retarding lever, when the torpedo
is launched, allows the reducing valve
to open only slightly, thus throttling
the main engine.
As the torpedo plunges into the water
a little flat water tripper is pushed
down, releasing the retarding lever and
giving the reducing valve its full ac
tion. A distance gear, moved by the
engine, provides means for automati
cally closing the reducing valve and
thus stopping the engine when the tor
pedo has run_a predetermined distance.
This gear is always set in practice, for
a torpedo costing $3000 is too valuable
to be lost. When the air is cut off a
spring is released, forcing the steering
rod forward, pulling the horizontal
rudders up, and thus bringing the tor
pedo to the surface. Many pounds of
the compressed air being lost in the
run, the torpedo naturally rises when
the mechanism is at rest.
Wet guncotton, weighing 220 pounds,
is carried in the torpedo's blunt phos
phor-bronze war head, double the
amount carried in the smaller torpedo
first issued to the navy. The guncotton
motion, characteristically remarked:
'Never mind; if I meet him again I'D
make a lord of him.' "
The first commodore of the young
American navy was Captain John
Barry. In the pnring of 17S1 he was
hailed by a British ship on his way
from Havana. To the inquiry as to his
identity he replied: "The United States
ship Alliance, Saucy Jack Barry, half
Irishman, half Yankee; who are you?"
"Not the value nor the command of
the whole British fleet could tempt me
from the American cause," was the
heroic reply of Barry to Lord Howe in
ITJfi when he offered him 15,000 guineas
and n commission in the English navy
to join the royal cause. Equally heroic
was the reply of the cc^tive American
sailor, Nathan Coffin, when asked to
enter the king's service: "Hang me, if
you will, to the yardarm, but do not
ask me to become a traitor to my
country."
Com. Stephen Decatur was one of the
very bravest men that ever walked the
quarterdeck. His famous toast at a
public dinner in Norfolk. Va., in 1814,
"Our Country! In her intercourse with
foreign nations may she always be in
the right; but our country, right or
wrong," would, if he had never said or
done anything else, have won him im
mortality.
The destruction by him of the frigate
Philadelphia in the harbor nf Tripoli
was declared by Lord Nelson to be
"the most bold and daring act of the
age." Decatur was as generous as he
was brave. "I cannot," said he to Cap
tain Carden of the Macedonian, as he
offered to surrender his sword, "take
the sword of a man who has so
bravely defended - ; ' his ship, but I'll
thank you for that hat." This was in
the 1812 war, and the reference to the
hat was a reminder of a bet between
the two officers, made previous to the
outbreak of hostilities, in regard to the
fighting powers of their ships. At the
first fire the Macedonian lost her miz
zenmast. Hearing a sailor remark to
one of his mates that " they had made
a brig of her," Decatur added: "Take
a good aim, my lads, at the mainmast,
and we'll' make a sloop of her."
To the hail of a squadron of Algerine
pirates, while cruising in the Mediter
ranean of "Dove andite?" ("Where are
you going?"), Decatur from his lone
ship answered back, "Dove mi piace"
("Where I please"), and they let him
go.
Toward the close of the 1812 war De
catur, in command of the President,
was chased by a large squadron, all of
which, with one exception, the Endy
mion, he outsailed. In the emergency
he conceived the daring design of cap
turing that ship before her sisters
could come to her assistance, and, hav
ing scuttled his own vessel, which was
injured at the time, sailing into port
on his anticipated prize. His speech to
his crew on that occasion is unique.
"My lads," said he, "that ship is com
ing up with us. As our own ship will
not sail, we'll go aboard of them, every
is in disks. Into the nose of the torpedo
is inserted a metal cylinder, reaching
back some distance through openings
in the guncotton disks. This cylinder,
the primer, holds a series of small dry
guncotton cylinders. The forward
cylinder is pierced to receive the
detonating primer of fulminate of
mercury, capped with a percussion cap.
The war nose screws into the forward
end of the primer case. When the tor
pedo is launched a blow on the war
nose will not explode the guncotton, but
as the torpedo runs through the water
a little fan on the nose is revolved like
a paper spinning wheel. A nut is
screwed through a traveling sleeve by
man and boy of us. and carry her into
New York. All I ask of you is to fol
low me. This is a favorite ship of the
country. If we allow her to be taken
by the enemy we shall be deserted by
our wives and sweethearts. What, lose
such a ship as this for nothing! 'Twould
break the heart of every pretty girl in
New York." The President at once
headed for the Endyrr.ion and the en
gagement began. During tlie action
Deeatur was wounded and the Endy
mion dismantled. Before the President
had time to repair damages the Ten
edos and Pomona came up and Decatur
was forced to haul down his flag.
"Don't give up the ship," the dying
words of Commander Lawrence, the
heroic commander of the Chesapeake,
are among the very noblest ever ut
tered. They will live as long as the
ocean rolls or ship floats.
The {gallant .terry flew that signal at
his masthead in the memorable battle
of Lake Erie, at the glorious close of
which he had the inspiration to pen
that dispatch which has canonized him
in our history: "We have met the en
emy and they arÂ§ ours." It was written
on his stiff hat in lieu of a table, on the
half of an old letter, and the additional
information in it gave the size and
number of the enemy, namely, "Two
shii'S, two brigs, one schooner and one
sloop."
Perry was a hero in peace as well as
in war. During a fearful winter storm,
while lying in the harbor of Newport,
he heard that a merchant vessel had
been driven on a reef six miles distant.
He at once manned his barge and said
to the crew: "Come, my boys, we are
going to the relief of shipwrecked sea
men; pull away." That act was ap
plauded by the country almost as much
as was the battle on Lake Erie. Dur
ing the Mexican war General Scott re
quested the loan of some guns from the
ileet, to be used on shore. Perry com
plied, but on one condition, that "wher
ever the guns go, the officers and men
must go also."
Commander Porter, father of the late
Admiral Porter, happily phrased the
sentiment of the country in the motto
which he (lew on his flag in the war of
1S12: "Free trade and sailors' rights."
In those distant days it became the text
for many a patriotic song and thou
sands of political speeches.
the turning of the fan until it rests on
the firing pin.
When the torpedo strikes the firing
pin is driven in, detonating the cap, the
fulminate of mercury, the dry gun
cotton, and then exploding the 220
pounds of wet gun-cotton. This sys
tem of explosions is made necessary by
the nature of the gun cotton. This
high explosive, one of the most power
ful destroyers ever evolved from the
chemist's laboratory, is exploded with
difficulty. Were the Avar head simply
loaded with wet gun-cotton the impact
of the head against a ship's armor
would not explode the gun-cotton.
Even dry gun-cotton might not explode.
Gun-cotton on shipboard is always
kept wet. It is more difficult to ex
plode, but more violent in its action.
Dry gun-cotton is about the only thing
that is sure to explode wet gun-cotton,
and dry gun-coUon is exploded by a
mercury fulminate detonator. The lat
ter is easily exploded by a cap, and in
stantaneously expands to 2500 times its
original volume. The sudden pressure
explodes the dry gun-cotton. The war
head is never used in times of peace.
Instead a blunter practice head of steel
is used. It is ballasted by filling it with
fresh water.
The prototype of the wonderful
Whitehead of to-day was a most er
ratic war engine. Pushed overboard
by an impulse rod, sent forward by
compressed air, the iron fish darted off
like a porpoise at play, shooting
straight forward for a moment, and
then, suddenly swinging around like a
boomerang, it dove down deep, explor
ing the bottom, and often ran its nose
into a mud bank. Again it shot up
ward and skimmed along the surface,
leaving a ribbon of white foam in its
wake. But in spite of its erratic move
ments and its small charge of explo
sive, the first Whitehead was regarded
as a terrible engine of war. Its very
imperfections worked in its favor.
A British captain, [meeting Porter,
flung out an answerikg signal to this
effect: "God and couttry, British sail
ors' best rights. Traifcrs offend both."
The belief in England.at the time was
that the crews of the* American ships
were all British deserirs. Porter an
swered his enemy ne^ day with a
fresh signal i!ag: "G(d. our country
and liberty! Tyrants Iff end them!"
When the Constitution, under the
command of Commodort Hull, engaged
the French frigate Gueriiere a dramat
ic scene was witnessed en the deck of
"Old Ironsides." As the Frenchman's
guns began to thunder out. Lieutenant
Morris, second in command, asked Hull
if he should give the order to tire.
"Not yet," replied Hull.
Nearer and nearer came the two ships.
Again Morris asked for the oider.^and
again came the answer, "Not (ret. A

The dashing Preble, during a cruise
in the Mediterranean, ran across an
other ship. It was night, and he coulc!
get no reply to his hail. .This colloquy
followed: .. ,

time; if you don't answer I'll fire a shot

Prebleâ This is the United States 44
gun ship Constitution, Captain Edward
Preble, and I'll be if I send a boat

boys.
We were at peace at the time, and the
two captains suspected that each was
a pirate. They lay to during the night.
Explanations followed in the l-orning,
when the British ship proved to be not
the formidable Donegal, but the 32-gun
frigate M.aidstone.
The English paddle-wheel sloop Ob
â eron was rigged up as an experimental
torpedo-boat and from it the first
Whitehead was launched in English
waters. The target was the wooden
corvette Aigle, surrounded by netting
fifteen feet from the ship's side and
reaching twelve feet below the sur
face. The first torpedo fired at her
dojve under the net, suddenly shot up
ward again, striking the ship and blow
ing a big hole in her bottom. The ad
miralty officers had not expected this
result, but it led the English Govern
ment to pay $75,000 for the right to
manufacture Whitehead torpedoes at
the Royal Laboratory. Before the
Aigle had sunk a second torpedo was
fired at her. This one struck the net
ting and inflicted no damage.
No Government would now spend a
cent for a torpedo which could not be
depended on to reach the point aimed
at. The maximum effectiveness of a
torpedo in an attack on a battleship is
reached when the torpedo strikes the
vessel amidships, well below the heavy
side armor belt. The explosion drives
in the armor at its weakest point, ex
plodes the boilers and nearby maga
zines and insures the sinking of the
ship. Struck near the water line, a
heavy battleship (while the havoc
wrought would be terrific) might be
able to keep above water for hours and
do effective service in an engagement.
The Ting Yuen, one of the battleships
of the Chinese fleet at Wei-Hai-Wei,
at early dawn on February 5, 1895, was
attacked by the Japanese torpedo flo
tilla. One of the six W T hitehead tor
pedoes fired at the Ting Yuen and Lai
Yuen struck the former in the stern
near the water lin<?. The torpedo toro
a big hole in the armor, and, although
the water-tight doors and compart
ments failed at the critical moment,
the ship sank very slowly and her gun
ners sank the assailant, killing all of
her crew.BROADSIDE SLAUGHTER
AT THE BATTLE OF THE YALU
The Biggest Battle of Ironclads Up to Admiral Dewey's Great Victory at Manila.
HE was only a little Japanese
bandsman, dressed in nautical
costume. But he was very pa
triotic; his small lungs were do
ing their best to fill a great
trombone with wind. And really the
volume of sound which Issued from that
instrument was amazing; the tiny man
puffed out his cheeks at one end and
a martial air burst forth at the other.
The occasion was a peaceful one, for
the Japan !â :-â¢- rruis -r which had just
been launched was not yet in a position
to do damage to ;.n enemy; the grace
ful white doves which fluttered over

the greatest naval combat of recent

he laid down his h;g instrument and
told me some of his experiences.
If the ships of .he dons ever emerge
from their hiding places on the eastern
si.ie of the Atlantic and steer west to
do battle with Uncle Sam's fleet it will,
I doubt not, be a second edition of the
Yalu struggle, though perhaps the con
flict will be even more bloodthirsty
because of the greater strength of the
- engaged. The victory at Manila,
splendid achievement though it was.
hardly furnishes a parallel, because of
the great disparity in the forces en
gaged. Moreover the Spaniards had no
ironclad vessels, while the Chinese
brought to bear against the Japs two
heavily armored ships.
The battle of the Yalu was the second
great action which the world has wit
nessed between modern ironclads. The
first was at Lipsa, far back in 1866,
when armored vessels were but in their
Infancy. During the thirty years which
elapsed between this battle and the
Yalu wonderful progress had been
made in the construction of fighting
vessels; guns were heavier, armor was
thicker and speed was greater. Yet the
advance had been achieved entirely on
theoretical grounds, naval constructors
were working in the dark, and no one
knew exactly how these complicated
floating masses of machinery would be

OUR MEN AT THE HELM IN WASHINGTON.
PRESIDENT McKINLEY shows
the strain of the stress of the
war. None but those who have
been close to him can realize
what the past three months have
meant to the nation's executive. With
full appreciation of his crrave responsi-.
bilities, knowing the power inherent in
his position to affect results, and yet
cognizant as the days went by of his
inability to prevent the fulfillment of
fate, he has endeavored to guide events
fo far ac he could in a course which
will hold him and the people blameless
in the sight of the world for whatever
may follow. That he has withstood the
strain so well bears testimony to his
mental poise and strength of character
and body.
The President's demeanor has under
gone a noticeable change. The affable,
cheery mood which formerly character
ized him has given way to a sternness
of manner which befits a humane but
just judge called upon to execute a
righteous sentence. A curious illustra
tion of Mr. McKinley's temperament is
shown in the diffÂ«, r . nee In his bearing
since the passage of the resolutions
;vhi< h made war inevitable. So long as
There was the slightest chance for peace
ihe pressure of uncertainty boro heav
i'y upon him, and his face assumed a
wan and haggard look. That look has
not entirely disappeared, but it is no
longer marked by anxiety. From the
moment the decision was reached
which imposed upon him the leadership
of a nation at war, he seems to have
experienced a sense of relief, for he
at the risk of his life, to give the world
some of the experiences it stood so
greatly in need of. "I was not fright
ened," he said, to translate his broken
English into a more convenient mode
of expression, "you see had no time.
We were working hard while the bat
tle lasted, half the time there was such
a confusion I did not know where I
was or what I was doing.
"I was in the band on board the Ma
tushima, theÂ«hip that was in the thi<*k
of all the fighting, but we did not get
much chance to play music during the
battle. It was in the morning, just
about dinner time, that we sighted the
Chinese, and we were at it all the rest
of the afternoon. I could not see much
for the smoke, but our ship shook all
the time as the guns were fired, and
then a big shell burst in the battery,
throwing one oi the guns over, and
killing the whole gun's crew.
"Very soon we were all of us at the
guns, firing away whenever we could
see the white sides of a Chinese vessel
through the smoke. Down in the bat
tery we could not tell what was going
on ; we did not even know when our
shots h!t. But we knew when one of
the Chinese shells struck us. for if it
exploded the concussion would almost
knock you down, and when the fumes
cleared away you would see bits of hu
man bodies scattered all over the
place.
"One shell exploded a heap of ammu
nition, and we found nothing of an of
ficer standing by but his cap.
"Luckily for us, a lot of the Chinese
shells were not loaded. We found one
afterward filled with cement, instead of
powder. But the fires were awful. It
seemed as if they broke out wherever
there was any woodwork to burn. And
one big blaze down in the coal bunkers
next the magazine nearly finished us.
The fire got so strong that the bulk
head between the bunkers and the
magazine grew red hot, the flames leap
ed through the crevices, and we had to
stuff our clothes into the cracks to pre
vent the magazine catching."
"Of course wp were glad when it was
over, for though we finished off the
Chinese, we came very near sinking
oursMves. Half our crew was killed
or wounded, and the rest were not good
for anything. I got off fortunately
with this." and he lifted up his cap
and showpd a jagged scar on the sldÂ«
of his head. "It was a fragment of a
shell or a flying rivet which did it, but
it laid me Tip for the rest of the war,
for I did not see any more fighting."
Even in the old days of wooden ships.
1 sees his pathway straight before him
now. no matter how rough it may be.
The President takes little recreation,
but he breaks away from his desk for
a few moments every day. Sometimes
he strolls through the White House
grounds with a member of the Cabinet,
or with some friend, and usually his
arm is locked in that of his companion.
He delights to wander through the
broad area known as the "white lot,"
Just in the rear of the executive man
sion, and during these wanderings he
is frequently followed by a curious
crowd. He has a courteous greeting for
everybody and usually a word and a
smile, which lights up rather sadly his
careworn face. Every day or two he
takes a long drive into the country late
in the afternoon, and on these drives
he always takes a friend along.

Department, shows the effect of tension

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 8, 1898.
when the captain fought his vessel
from the exposed altitude of the poop
deck, he could see comparatively little
of what was going on away from his
own vessel. And to-day, when the cap
tain is shut up in a confined conning
tower, he certainly will find it difficult
to get a general view of the engage
ment. As to the gunners, in turrets or
inclosed batteries, they will see nothing
except the ship at which they happen
to be taking aim. The only persons
likely to get a good all round view of
the fight will be the men working : the
machine guns on the upper deck, # and
in the military tops of the large iron
clads. The probability that they will
survive to relate their experiences is
extremely small.
Contemporary historians have given
us a fairly good account of the great
Yalu fight. Never was the value of
calm personal courage more clearly
demonstrated. People are fond of say
ing that our modern war vessels are
nothing but floating boxes of machin
ery. That is perfectly true, but we
must not forget that machines require
intelligent, self-possessed men to con
trol them. Therefore the most costly
ironclad is useless unless she has a
courageous" self-reliant crew to work
her. Thus it was at the Yalu. and
thus it probably will be should the
great naval battle on the Atlantic take
place. The superiority of the Ameri
can sailor over the Spaniard requires no
proof; if it did. we have lately had
brilliant instances on two sides of the
globe. in Cuba and the far away Phil
ippines.
The Chinese, in the matter of ships,
had a considerable advantage over the
.Tnnanese. They possessed two power
ful Ironclads, the Tine Yuen and the
Chen Yuen, armed with four 35-ton
Krunp guns, to say â nothing of many
smaller weapons. Their armor was
fourteen inches thick, and though their
f=peed was slow, thpv were formidable
vessels compared with the lightly arm
ored cruisers fouerht by. the Japanese.

his daily work and there is no bustle

Secretary Alger is a man of war and
has considered the Cuban situation all
along from the viewpoint of a soldier.
From the day that the news came of
i the destruction of the Maine he has re
garded war as practically inevitable,
I and his thoughts and actions have been
j guided accordingly. General Alger is
I not of a sanguinary disposition. On the
I contrary he is one of the gentlest of
men. He is regarded with a '.egree of
i estimation approaching affection by
j those who come in official and personal
! contact with him, and admiration for
his personal qualities as a man Is
equaled by appreciation of his abilities
as an official.
General Alg-er has borne the strain
remarkably well, in view of his en

and his European advisers extinguished
the flames. The last time, indeed, tho
gallant captain narrowly escaped de
struction from one of his own guns
which was fired so close to his head as
to knock him senseless.
But though the Chinese had the ad
vantage in the matter of ironclads their
guns were notably inferior to the Jap
anese. The Chinese had only the old
fashioned, slow-firing weapons, where
as the Japanese had the latest variety
of quick firers, ranging up to six inches
in caliber. The destruction wrought
bj' these weapons was so tremendous
that every naval power took the hint
and there are few ironclads now afloat
in which the secondary battery is not
equipped entirely with quick firers.
The splendid marksmanship of the
Japanese gunners enabled them to
pour a hail of these awful projectiles
upon the ill-fated ships of the Chinese,

invaluable to the President, through
his faculty for reflecting outside opin

Owing to the practical retirement of
Secretary Sherman, Assistant Secretary
Day has willingly borne the brunt of
the diplomatic battle which has been
waged with Spain. Judge Day seems
to have a remarkable aptitude for hard
work and has emerged from the days
of unremitting toil and nights of sleep
less thought without visible effect upon
his mind or his body. He is the most
modest appearing of men, reserved to
the point of taciturnity, a hard student
and little acquainted with politicians

his desk in the department, where he
broods over his books and parers more
industriously than any of the clerks,

The Japanese did not suffer so much,
for they had tak the precaution to
strip their vessels of every particle of
woodwork which could be removed.
Even the mess tables and benches had
been taken out and the hardy little sail
ors contentedly lived on the bare deck.
The burning of the Spanish fleet at
Manila gives us another instance of the
destructive effect of shell fire, and in
future war vessels will be built with
little or no wood about their fittings.
Everything will have to be of iron, cold
and comfortless, but infinitely safer in
time of action.
The fight at the Yalu was mainly a

val engagements are likely to proceed
on the same lines. The Chinese formed

hand fought in the formation known as
LOTS OF WORK FOR WOMEN IN WAR.
THE President and Secretary of
War are receiving letters from
patriotic women all over the
country anxious to be mustered
into service in case there should
be an outbreak of war with Spain.
A letter received at the White House
and addressed, "President McKinley,
Washington, D. C," reads: "I write
asking if I vould be of any use to you
in this Cuban trouble. I am only a
woman, but I can nurse the sick and
wounded. I only wish I were a man.
I would go and volunteer to take one
of our unfortunate one's place who
went down in the Maine. If you need
women to nurse, or if in any way I can
be of service to you for my country's
sake, please let me know. I am strong,
weigh 150 â  ounds, height 5 feet 5
inches, age 27 years and a good nurse.
Hoping to be of service to my God and
country I am at your command."
Another says: "I was one of the first
volunteer nurses during the war of the
rebellion; experience on transports and
in hospitals. If there is another war I
am ready."
A Canadian wrman, who says her
brother fought for our flag in the late
war, offers her services, and adds ir.
her lett- â  to the President: "Failing the
position of nurse I shall be glad to give
my services in any other capacity
where I may be of use."
From away down in Colorado an
other woman, who addresses her letter
"War Department," offers her services
in these words: "Should there be a war
between the Ui.ited States and Spain
would there be any show for us to get
transportation? We are nurses and
strong, healthy women. There are two
of Ã¼b, aged 35 years."
line ahead, the ships bringing their
broadside to bear on the enemy.
The Chinese, when they saw the
approaching, opened fire at six
thousand yards (about three and one
half miles), but the shell fell short.
The Japs, more wisely, reserved their
fire till they came within three thou
sand yards, when their guns could be
used with disastrous effect. The com
bat, as far as the Mongolians were con
cerned, soon became a general melee,
the Chinese admiral lost all control of
his fleet and each ship fought the
enemy as best she could.
Admiral Ito, on the other hand, who
commanded the Japanese fleet, kept his
ships well in hand, the attack was de
veloped on orderly, systematic lines,
and one by one the weaker Chinese ves
sels were either runk or "ilown up, or
destroyed by fire. Altogether the Japa
nese'finished off five vessels and only
the two Chinese ironclads were left in
These are but several examples of the
correspondence being received from
American women.
While the typical army nurse is al
ways described by the idealist as a
youthful, tender "angel of mercy,"
with a beautiful face, it is interesting
to know that generals in command of
armies prefer middle-aged and homely
women for such service. A circular
distributed by the superintendent of
nurses in IS6I read:
"No women under 30 need apply. All
nurses are required to be very plain
looking women. Their dresses must
be either brown or black, with no.
bows," no curls or jewelry and no hoop
skirts."
The pay given to nurses in the late
war was 412 a month, but it is said
that hundreds of women of social rank
and position, without waiting to be
formally mustered in, served without
pay or hope of reward. She who is
now volunteering to aid in a conflict
with Spain is not the "new woman,"
but the same patriotic creature who
offered herslf to her flag in 1861.
General Sherman called "Mother
Blckerdyke," the celebrated nurse of
the Civil War, one of his "best gen
erals."
The woman who would be the most
conspicuous of her sex in a great war
between the United States and Spain
is Miss Clara Barton, president of the
American Red Cross Society, who is
now caring for the starving Cubans.
Within a month after President Lin
coln's first call for the army of 75,000
volunteers an association of New York
women had chosen from hundreds of
candidates 100 competent nurses to be
trained by the physicians and surgeons
of this city. At the same time women
throughout the country organized sol
diers' aid societies, sewing circles, fairs
a condition fit for fighting at the end
of the day.
It is said that the Japs did not close
and ram these vessels because they
wished to capture rather than sink
them, otherwise the victory might have
been even more complete. The Chinese,
on the contrary, tried to use the ram
several times, but each time they wera
foiled by the superior speed of the Jap
anese cruisers.
Of course in such a stubbornly con-Â»
tested battle the loss of life was enorÂ«
mous. There were about three thou
sand men on each side and out of these
the Chinese had 700 killed and wounded,
the Japanese only 294.
The heavy loss of the Chinese was
mainly caused by drowning, for as their
vessels sank the crews perished. All
boats were early destroyed and
neither friend nor foe had the means
to save the unfortunate strugglers la
the water. J. F. ROSE-SOLEY.
and entertainments of various sorts
for the purpose of furnishing the brave
boys both necessities and delicacies.
Trains running into Washington were
weighed down with a tremendous ac
cumulation of freight for this purpose.
Its distribution was finally turned over
to the Sanitary Commission, which co
operated during the war with women's
clubs and societies throughout the en
tire North. After each battle agent*
distributed the supplies as received.
Statistics show that during the late
war the women's organizations raised
altogether fifty millions of dollars
among their societies in the Northern
States, the amount just appropriated by
Congress to put the nation upon an ef
fective defensive footing. The little
girls of the North, by their miniature
fairs and handiwork, contributed $100,
000.
Women might serve this Government
as spies in a great war. That a woman
cannot keep a secret herself or let any
t one else keep one is not borne out by
'certain secret archives kept in
a large fireproof safe in the
W;ir Department. One of the
most active and reliable Union
spies in the late war was a woman, who
worked successfully for a long period.
Eventually, however, she was caught
by the enemy and hanged to a tree.
Martial law, which states that "the spy
is punishable by death by hanging by
the neck," has no respect for sex.
The story is also told of a Confeder
ate brigadier general who sent his wife
in the night to one of our generals with
the proposal that he would for $1000 so
place his force that it might be cap
tured by the Yankees without any
trouble. It is related by an officer that
the proposal was accepted, and that the
Northern troops captured the force as
arranged.

DON CARLOS IS READY
TO SEIZE THE THRONE.
For Thirty fears He and His Followers
Have Been Striving to Take Advantage
of Just Such a Crisis in Spanish Affairs.
Don Carlos Is at Brussels vigilantly
watching the development of affairs in
Spain. His agents are everywhere
throughout Spain actively working to
spread his cause and to take - d vantage
of every mistake made by the ruling
dynasty.
He is confident he will be known as
Carlos IX, King of Spain, by June 1.
He is being backed by the legitimists
all over the world.
The legitimists are a large body of in
telligent people In Europe who look
with contempt upon what is known as
modern progress, believe that democ
racy is an invention of the devil, who
hold to the antiquated doctrine which
Pope described as the right divine of
kings to govern wrong.
It is a firm tenet with them that
Providence set aside certain men and
women to rule over the rest of their
kind, and that these God appointed hu-
mans are privileged sacrosancts whose
word ought to be accepted as law,
whose acts we lesser humans should
accept without question or murmur. To
rise in revolt against them, be they ty
rants or despots, is to commit what
they consider the heinous crime of trea
son.
They would overthrow the sovereign
will of the people in order to restore
the God appointed sovereign or his line
to the remotest generations. They rec
ognize none of the extant rulers of
England, of France, of Spain, of Swe
den and Norway, of Portugal. All of
these are usurpers because at one time
or another the people of these lands,
rising in their wrath against wrong and
oppression, decreed that they or their
predecessors should supplant other rul
ing dynasties whose title in the last
analysis depended upon exactly the
sort of "usurpation" which these en
thusiasts denounce.
Harken to the words of the Marquis
of Ruvigny, editor of the recognized
organ of the party, The Legitimist Kal
endar. He acknowledges that the ten
dency of the age is toward democracy,
but the tendency of democracy is to
ward harm. "The legitimist is above
all things a King's man, and in his eyes
democracy is nn accursed thing, to be
prevented at all costs. He views with
apprehension the gradual transference
of power from the ruler to the ruled,
the steady curtailment of the royal pre
rogative, and the abrogation by the
people to themselves of functions which
they are not fitted to perform."
The legitimist goes still further. He
believes in primogeniture and that the
descendants of an unworthy monarch
who has been deposed retain forever
the right to be restored to their former
condition. He is a Jacobite in Eng
land, a Carlist in Spain and in France,
a Miguelist in Portugal, an imperialist
in Brazil. His faith, in other words, is
not local; he is simply one of a catholic
or universal party whose ramifications
extend over Europe.
He believes that the finger of God is
directing the present crisis with a view
to bringing about the imminent res
toration of Don Carlos to his rights as
a sort of entering wedge to the restora
tion of all other legitimate sovereigns
over the lands of which they or their
progenitors were dispossessed.
The origin of the Carlist imbroglio
dates back to 1533, when King Ferdi
nand VI, after a troublous reign,
breathed his last. He left no male is
BATCHING
THROUGH
COLLEGE
SCENES AROUND THE "BACHELORS* DEN" WHERE FOUR YOUNG MEN ARE WORKING THEIR WOY
THROUGH COLLEGE.
CALIFORNIA COLLEGE, East
Oakland, April 22. 1898.âPossi
bly one of the greatest mistakes
which an outsider could make
would be in thinking that the
student who is batchins and
working his way through college is a
lean-looking dyspeptic without a friend
in the world.
To be sure, there are exceptions. In
fact, the club which preceded ours lost
that "peaches and cream" complexion
which characterized their entrance into
the bachelor state, and one of the ne
cessary adjuncts of the . table was a
bottle of powdered pepsin which was
partaken of freely after every meal.

sue, but only an Infant daughter, Don
na Isabella. The Salic law, which had
been In force since 1713, excluding fe
males from the throne, the crown
should therefore have passed to his
brother, Don Carlos.
But Ferdinand in the later years of
his life had been absolutely tinder the
domination of his fourth wife, Chris
tina of Naples, a handsome, forceful
and unscrupulous woman. Her sway
had been confirmed by the birth of her
daughter Isabella in 1830. She induced
the weak and ailing monarch to Issue
a decree disinheriting his brother in
favor of his infant daughter. That he
transcended his royal prerogative is
generally conceded.
The church threw Its influence on the
side of Don Carlos. The King, who,
according to the state of his failing
health, passed from abject submission
to the will of his wife to equally ab
ject dread of the church, was harassed
with perpetual qualms of conscience as
to the succession. Time after time he
changed his mind.
The final victory, however, was won
by the Queen.
Immediately after his death the baby
Princess Isabella was declared Queen
of Spain, under the regency of her
mother. For five years afterward the
country was desolated by a terrible
civil war, carried on with varying for
tune and unwavering ferocity between
the Carlists and the partisans of Isa
bella. But France and England sided
with the latter, and in 1839 Don Carlos
quitted Spain in dospair. The question
of succession appeared to be settled in
favor of Isabella 11, a child not even
yet in her teens.
Had the new dynasty been conducted
with ordinary prudence, good faith or
loyalty, the world might never have
heard further of the Carlist pretender
to the throne. But the scandals which
brought Queen Christina's regency to a
premature close, the ill-fated marriage
of Queen Isabella to her imbecile
cousin Ferdinand VII, and the reck
lessness of her own conduct kept alive
the hopes of the pretender's partisans.
Don Carlos, the first pretender, died
in 1555. A second pretender arose at
once in the person of his son, Don Car
los, Count de Montemolin. In 1860 an
attempt was made in Valencia to start
the Carlist Insurrection afresh. The
Count was defeated. He and his broth
er Ferdinand were captured. They
were released only after signing a re
nunciation of all their claims to the
Spanish throne.
There was a third brother, Don Juan.
In 1868, when Queen Isabella was forced
to fly from Spain and Carlism once
more became a possibility, Don Juan
abdicated all his rights in favor of his
son, the present Don Carlos, who there
upon became the third pretender.
Nor were his pretensions a mere pre
tense. Prim and Sagasta, the two most
powerful members of the provisional
government established after Isabella's
flight, offered him the crown. But the
gift was conditioned on the promise
that the co-untry should have a consti
tution, and that the church and state
should be separated. Don Carlos re
fused the gift if it came trammeled
by any conditions. He would follow
the Carlist traditions and be an ab
solute monarch or none at all.
"When I come into my kingdom," he
said, "'I shall rule as'l see fit."
It was a youth of 20 who spoke thus
firmly, for Don Carlos de los Dolores

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 8, 1898.
In 1870 Amadeus, the brother of Vic
tor Emmanuel of Italy, was chosen
King of Spain by the Cortes. Don Car
los made a solemn i^-otest against the
usurper. In the summer of 18 t 2 the
northern provinces were r-used to arms
by a body of his partisans, led by his
brother Don Alfonso. Military opera
tions began and were continued with
greater vigor on the arrival of Don
Carlos himself in July, 1873. Aom thia
time till the beginning of 1876 this de
sultory but harassing warfare con
tinued to devastate the r -rthern pro
vinces and tax the rt s urces of the gov
ernment to the utmost. In tl.e Interim
Amadeus had resigned and Alfonso
XII, a son <-: the fugitive Isabella, had
been elected in his place.
The last hopes of the Carlists were
destroyed by the reductio-i in Febru
ary, 1876, of their fortresses Bilbao,
Estella and Tolosa. Don Carlos fled
across the country into France. In a
proclamation to the Spanish nation he
announced that he did not withdraw
from any of his claims, but was merely
awaiting a more propitious opportunity.
This proclamation led to his expulsion
from French territory.
He then made a prolonged tour
through the United States, Mexico and
Europe, finally settling in a magnificent
palace in Venice as his permanent resi
dence. As he himself explains, the
contrast between the glorious past of
the Queen of the Adriatic and its pres
ent melancholy decadence are in har
mony with the feelings and the condi
tions of exiled princes. Besides Don
Carlos, Venice has been the favorite
place of residence of the Count of
Chambord, the Duke of Modena and
other royal refugees.
Don Carlos has been married twice.
His first wife was a Princess de Bour
bon and a niece of the Count de Cham
bord. At tl.e tim<* of the marriage in
1567 and for many years afterward the
couple were very poor. But the deaths
of the Count and Countess de Cham
bord, who bequeathed the larger part
of their wealth to their favorite niece,
made it possible for them to keep up a
royal state.
This was all the more opportune for
the death of the Count de Cham
bord made Dc n Carlos the legitimist
pretender to the throne of France as
well as that of Spain. In the Count de
Chambord the male line of Louis XV
became extinct. Don Carlos, as the eld
est direct male descendant of the sec
ond son of Louis XVI, takes precedence
of the Duke of Orleans, who claims di
rect descent from a brother of the same
monarch.
It may Le added as an Interesting
fact that but for the existence of Prin
cess Mary of Bavaria Don Carlos would
also be the Jacobite claimant for the
English crown.
The first wife of Don- Carlos died in
1893. The last years of their wedlock
had been unhappy, and no one was sur
prised to learn thnt she had distributed
the bulk of her fortune among her five
children, cutting off the Don with a
comparatively small annuity. Money
troubles once more weighed upon the
pretender to two crowns.
He cast about him for a mode of re
lief. Within a twelvemonth after his
first wife*s death the world was star
tled by the announcement of his en
gagement to the Princess Marie Berthe
de Rohan. She was wealthy. She be
longed to a family which had long as
serted its equality with royalty, but she
was oot actually of royal blood. Hence
the new marriage was looked upon as
a mesalliance by the legitimists.
That the disagreement between the
couple had been the result of the
Duke's disreputable behavior and ill
treatment was a notorious fact. So
notorious, indeed, was it that even so
gentle and charitable a critic as Pope
Leo XIII took public cognizance of it.
"When, in November, 1596, the Prin
cess Elvira, a daughter of Don Carlos,
eloped with a married man named
Count Folchi, to the scandal of all Eu
rope and the uproarious indignation of
her father, the Pontiff was quoted as
saying:
"It is indeed a great misfortune. The
father is punished in his child. * It is
the chastisement of his* private life."
Senor Rafael Diez de la Cortina is
the representative of the interests of
Don Carlos in the United States. Last
September he predicted that the Pre

One of the chief difficulties encoun
tered is to so divide the work that each
man will not think he is doing more
than his share. In order to live to
gether harmoniously it was found ne
cessary to get the consent of the club
to certain rules and duties. To one
man was assigned the work of cook
ing the morning meal, to another the
one at noon, and to a third the big
meal at night.
Then there are other duties, such as
keeping the rooms in order and the
floors clean, washing the dishes, col
lecting the monpy and keeping the
larder well supplied. At the c.c
the two first meals of the day each
man is supposed to wash his own
dishes, it being the duty of the cook
to provide hot yater tor thÂ»t -purpose;

Reports from Madrid Indicate that the present Government of Spain may fall at no distant day. It is said Don Carlos, the pretender to the Spanish
throne, will make an effort to gain posession of the country, and it is asserted that General "Weyler, 'who is very popular with the army, will aid him. Don
Carlos is in Brussels at present, and is said to be much agitated by private telegrams he is receiving from Madrid. A Spanish diplomatist of high position
said yesterday. "They are practically in a state of revolution, and it is the beginning of the end of the regency. The Queen Regent may make a final effort in
favor of her Bon, but he will never come to the throne. Don Carlos will be the next King of Spain, and he will be on the throne before the end of next month.
tender would have become King by
January 1, IS9B. He now transfers the
realization of his prediction to June 1,
or even earlier, which is certainly a
very fair margin of time for a prophet
to claim. I saw Senor Cortina yester
but at the close of the evening meal
the dishwasher and his assistant, the
wiper, take charge of this -work.
Possibly the most trying time is when
some one who is studious gets the posi
tion of cook. Perhaps a problem in
geometry commands his attentioa when
the mush is on the boil, or a corn
starch pudding is on the way. Some
times the chops are slightly overdone
as he tries to find whence a pe
culiarly twisted Greek verb comes, or
the tea boils over and puts his nre out.
It is somewhat annoying after you
have made an exceedingly successful
corn starch pudding, when after several
hours' hard work outside you come back
with sundry ideas in your head as to
what you are going to do to that pud
ding, and then find that some nungry
student has been there before you.
Our kitchen and dining hall combined
is situated in one of the lower rooms
of what some of the outsiders call the
tunk house, but which in our language
Is called "Eucajyptus Hall." It is a

and the conservatives, are so badly

ing their political end.
two-story frame building with three
rooms and a hallway and is surmounted
by an immense tank which supplies
water for the college buildings and
grounds. Immediately over the veati
blue stands the windmill, whirring
around with every wind that blows. Ar
first and especially during the winter
gale? we were somewhat alarmed as
the great fan spun around, causing the
building to creak and tremble, but by
B nd by we became used to it and to
the strange clanking noise which it
made, until now its click, click, click,
cling, has a certain music for us.
On the outside of this strange dining
hall various classes have painted the
years of their graduation, and a certain
wit, now a law student in San Fran
cisco, thinking that the tank house
commanded an excellent view of the
back of the college, painted on it in
large brown letters "College Observa
tory, windmill extension," and below,
in smaller letters in Latin, "Sic itar ad
astra."
The first room off the hallway on the
ground floor is where all the cooking
operations are carried on. The first
thing one sees on opening the door is
a medium-sized table covered with red
oil cloth and beyond this, next to the
window, is the stand for the dishes.
In the right-hand corner is the stove,
around which hang an imposing array
of tea pots, coffee pots, stewing pans
and skillets. Behind the door stand the
vegetable boxes and over these is the
dog proof, rat proof, cat proof, but not
student proof cupboard.
Occasionally we get some shots in the
college publications as to our manner
of living and our ability in the culi
nary art. Sometimes a group of the
co-eds, whose poverty of knowledge in
regard to cooking is appalling, will
stick their heads in at our window,
while our cook is preparing some choice
decoction, and ask in the sweetest way
imaginable for a recipe for biscuit, or
how he makes such nice custard pies.
Another thing which militates against
our happiness, is when the tank runs
over. This is liable to occur at any
time, especially when some one leaves
the city water turned on, and as the
roofing is not on the water-proof or
der we sometimes have small inunda
tions to contend with. Lately this
evil has to some extent been overcome
by putting tar paper along the cracks.
Sometimes our ears are harrowed and
our meals interrupted by the most ex
cruciating sounds with which the wind
mill expresses its desire for more
grease.
We experienced great difficulty at
first in getting biscuits to suit our
taste. The first we made had a cas
ing on them strong enough to protect
a cruiser. On consulting some emi
nent authorities we found that this was
due to two much kneading. The next
time we flew to the opposite extreme,
and did not knead them enough, and
furthermore forgot to put salt in. We
have at the present time, however, de
veloped a proficiency in this line.
It took us some time before we could
make the proper allowances for swell
ing on the part, not only of the beans
but also of the rice. Many times we
would put, as we thought, the proper
quantity in the pan, but before those
beans got through with their expansion
several other pans would be called into
requisition. Once a careless cook left
the dish water on the fire, together
with the swab, which happened to be
in the dishpan at the time. The re
sult was disastrous to gasoline, dish
water, pan and swab. The one was
burned out, the dish water had gone
up in steam, the pan was twisted out
of all shape, and the swab was a
charred stick.
Sometimes the hearts of our neigh
bors warmed toward us and many
dainty specimens of cookery found the
As to the republicans and the feder
alists, they are hopelessly split up
among themselves, some drifting to so
cialism and some to anarcmsm, with no
possible point of contact or union.
"In short," was the senor's conclu
way to our kitchen; but lately these
gifts have become less frequent, pos
sibly owing to the fact that we broke
some of the dishes on which they were
sent over and forgot to return others.
Nor must it be supposed that the
sweet dove of peace" hovers over our
little band at all times. Sometimes dis
cord, with ruffled feathers and fire in !
its eye, will swoop down upon us, and
for a time there will be a family scrap.
These little incidents occur from vari
ous causes. Stme mornings the cook
will be late with the breakfast, the
rice may be scorched a little; the man
who gets the dinner will think he is
doing too much work; the man who
runs the finances will kick on the
amount of the syrup bill; the dish
washer and his assistant will raise a
protest because delayed dinners keep
them too long over the dishes, and last
of all a row will start no one knows ex- ;
actly how â but usually there is one in
the party who fails to be ruffled, and by
his benign counsels, ail is poured on the

"But the same thing may b2 said of
dynamite, and persona who give public
performances of their hypnotic powers
are in the same category with spiritual
ists who give public exhibitions of so
called materializations. They are
charlatans. Such practices should be
stopped by legislation."
So said a well-known Eastern ohysi
cian who had retired from practice,
and who was with Charcot in Paris ten
years ago, when hypnotism, or the
"science of suggestion," was very
much less discussed and very much
less understood than it is at the pres
ent time.
"Is it possible, in your opinion, for a
man with hypnotic powers to suggest
murder and continue the suggestion
for months until it eventually results
in murder thousands of miles away?"
he was asked.
"Certainly not. There is no authen
ticated case of the kind in the history
of hypnotism in this country. The
French give two or three remarkable
instances, but in dealing with the
French we are dealing with different
people from Americans or with chil
dren of foreigners who have been
brought up here. The French are inter-
Celts. They are peculiarly fitted by
temperament for unusual manifesta
tions in the science of hypnotism."
"Suppose it is suggested to the hyp
notic subject that he shall commit
murder?"
"It is impossible to suppose such a
thing. But to answer your question. I
will say that if a man has it in his
nature to commit murder, hypnotism
or no hypnotism, then he might carry
out a suggestion that he ahould com
mit murder. They had one such case
in France, where they acquitted the
murderess and guillotined the hypno
tist. If it is not in his nature, then no
hypnotist could compel him to do it.
But such suggestions are whipping the
devil a long way around the stump."

of where four students, at an expendi

It might be interesting to know that
every member of the "Bachelors*

while getting his education, by his
own exertions. Tuition is made by put

have to be cared for, slips planted and
lawns watered. New roads have to be
made and gravel paths cared for. Fuel
has to be provided for the winter fires,
and passers-by can often hear the
steady chopping of the student's ax
and the crashing of some falling tree.
This is a homely but true picture of
how many of the students of our land
are getting their education to-day.

did not take an extreme view. "When
I was sent to England with Phil Reilly
to bring back the Bernard brothers,"
he said, "Byrnes told us before start
ing: 'Now, these fellows are very
clever. I am told that one of them is a
hypnotist, and that he has used his
tricks in getting away before. All I
have got to say is that if these fellows
get away from you, don't come bacte
here. I shan't want to see y >v again.' "
"I paid particular attention to what
Byrnes said, because of a remarkable
experience I had with a detective from,
Columbus, Ohio, a day or two before.
He came on here to get a fellow who
would net go without extradition pa
pers. A couple of professional hypno
tists were giving an exhibition at a
music hall at the time, and this detec
tive would not be satisfied without an
experiment.
"After the performance I went with
him into the manager's office, and the
Ohio man sat down for a test. I assure
you that in less than three minutes he
had that fellow completely at his
mercy. He handed me his watch, his
badge and almost everything else he
had about him. When brought to his
senses he declared that he had not
been hypnotized. Nothing but hiÂ»
empty pockets convinced him.

SAYS THIS WAR OPENS A NEW ERA IN OUR HISTORY.
Professor Charles Eliot Norton of Harvard recently made a number of comments on the present war. They
created widespread attention and discussion. Below will be found Professor Norton's own state
ment of why he made the comments and also what he has to say of the character of the Ameri
can people and the future of the country.
PROFESSOR CHARLES ELIOT
NORTON lives in a fine old
house, situated on an eminence
not fifteen minutes' walk from
Harvard. It is the house in
which he was born. It stands
In the midst of what are known as
Norton's Woods, and a wide driveway
leads to it from the traveled road. This
driveway and all the grounds are Pro
fessor Norton's private property, but
he leaves them open as a park for the
benefit of the people of Cambridge.
Shortly before I called on Professor
Norton he had attracted some public
attention by his lecture in the fine arts
course at Harvard, in advising the stu
dents not to enlist for the war with
Spain. What followed he described to
me briefly.
"Let me show you a card I received
to-day," he said, with a laugh; and
he brought from his study a postal
card which bore his name and address.
On the reverse was written in the hand
of a not illiterate man: .
"Professor Charles E. Norton is an
un-American ass," with other senti
ments of a like character, which were
signed "Massachusetts Soldier." This
was the missionary product of the pub
lication of a short paragraph summar
izing what Professor Norton had said
to -the students. He read It two or
three times with evident amusement.
"The occasion of my lecture to the
students," said Professor Norton, "was
the reassembling after the holidays.
Grave events had happened since I
had spoken to them last. War \ had
been declared and I thought it neces
sary to speak to them on the subject of
enlistment. I was moved to quote to
them what Benjamin Franklin saidâ
that there never was a good war..;
"I '.told them that in time of need
every man should be ready to go to
the defense of his country, but that
this â  was \ not in any sense -â  a national
war, and as they owed it to the United

of I'ackensack, N. J. Mrs. Bolles is a
wealthy and handsome young widow,
who lived In a palatial residence in
Hackensack, surrounded with every
luxury and comfort, but who was lured
away from her sumptuous surround
ings by the desire for nati gold and
the romantic experience of digging it
herself. The rest of the party, with
the exception of Dr. Hiller, who was
formerly a successful i ractitkrner of
Washington, D. C, and J. B. Wads
worth, who is 71 years of age and
whose hair is as white as blow, are
young men employed in the ordinary
avocations of life, and who have gath
ered together our little "all" and have
embarked upon this adventure with all
our hearts, for better or worse.
Our boat is a two-masted schooner,
measuring 87 feet over all. with a crew
of seven. Her space is divided into a
forecastle, galley, and main and after
cabin. In the center of the main cabin
is erected a framework in which the
ship's stores and our outfits are stowed.
Along the two sides are arranged six
teen berths for sleeping accommoda
tion. In the center and at the end of
the cargo-house is fixed our dining
table. Beneath our sleeping bunks are
lockers, protruding so as to form
benches to sit upon. Thus the main
cabin serves as our sleeping-roam, din
ing-room, sitting-room, smoking-room,
library, drawing-room, storeroom and
any other old purpose for which a room
is required.
When the work of chocking away our
effects and making ourselves snug
themselves as possible. I advised them
not to enlist, but to leave that for the
present to men more in sympathy with
the cause with which the war was con
cerned.
"My remarks would have attracted
no attention if one of the older men
present had not got up and asked per
mission to speak. Then he disap
pointed me by making a speech abus
ing Spain â rather jingoish in tone and
accompanied by extravagant gesticu
lation. There were about 400 students
present. They began to laugh at
first, but I asked them to be quiet and
after that they were Jas orderly as
though they had been in church.
"When the young man was through
I simply said that the country of which
he had been speaking was a strong il
lustration of the unhappy effects of bel
ligerency. Spain had lived by war ana
we could see to what condition it had
brought her." 4
Professor Norton's eye twinkled as
he narrated the incident. He looked
more serious when he said: "In en
tering on this war we have outlined a
new policy for the nation and struck a
dangerous blow at the Monroe doctrine,
I fear. We have interfered in thÂ«
government of a Spanish possession
which, though near us, is not â  a part
of this continent, and which was a for
eign possession long before "the United
States came into existence. â¢
"Europe . may use that as an argu
ment when she wants to protect ,her
Interests in South America. I foresee
grave consequences to come from this
war â consequences which this nation
will be reaping 200 years hence. I be
lieve that this conflict is going to bring
out the very worst that is in the Amer
ican people."
I asked Professor Norton if he be
lieved what Mr. Depow had quoted
to me from an anonymous urce some
time agoâ that the war : would bring
out the dormant patriotism of the
American people.
His reply to; this was. a comment on
Mr. Depew. He 3ald in effect that Mr.
Jjepew's influence on the American peo
ple was not for goodâ that he , took
nothing serious. .

time and thoughts, we naturally began
to review oar undertaking and specu

now did our first real sober thinking
upon the subject. We had instituted a
very fair library by contributing each
one his selection of books, and when
time began to hang heavily upon us
we fell to reading; but it was easy to
be seen that thoughts other than the
subject before our eyes were uppermost
in our minds.

THE WAR AS VIEWED
BY
PRESIDENT ELIOT OF HARVARD.
"Where is it," said President Eliot,
"that the people are crying for war?
It isn't here. I cannot find where it
is. Our soldiers are going in from a
sense of duty, not with any enthusi
asm."
I quoted what Nikola Tesla said to
me recently â that we lacked enthusi
asm because Spain was such an incon
siderable foe. Dr. Eliot said he did not
believe that was the reason. Besides,
he said, we were going to find the prob
lem of war difficult enough even with
an opponent like Spain.
"One reason there is no enthusiasm,"
he said, "may be that the people know
so little about the cause of war. I am
sure I don't know - hy we have gone
to war; and none of us will know until
all the notes that passed between the
two countries are made public. We
have no means of knowing whether the
tone of the President's last communi
cation to Spain was like those which
went before, or whether it illustrated a
change of sentiment.
"Certainly if all his communications
to Spain were like the last he could not
have been trying to avoid a conflict be
cause he must have known that Spain
would not give up her sovereignty in
Cuba. Possibly the members of Con
gress are a~> ignorant about the real
conditions as w* 1 are. Possibly they
yielded to the pressure of what they be
lieved to be public sentiment. That re
ruinds me of what Father Taylor of
Boston said to Senator Henry Wilson
at the time of the last war.
"Congress had done something that
Father Taylor did not approve and he
spoke to Senator Wilson about it. Sen
ator Wilson replied, saying that Father
Taylor did not understand. There was
great pressure from without, he said.
'Where were your inside braces, then?'
said Father Taylor.
"And I wonder where Congress' in
side braces were recently."
Speaking of our lack of preparation
for war Dr. Eliot said that the light
artillery of Massachusetts was
equipped with obsolete guns â guns of
thirtr years ago, of a type for which
ammunition was not made to-day, so
that it would be impossible to put them

into service. And then he quoted the
official dispatch which Governor Wol
cott sent to Washington recently an
nouncing that Massachusetts was
wholly without ammunition, as some
thing which the Sp~i Ish Minister no
doubt had foui.d great pleasure in send
ing to his Government. If the Massa
chusetts coast is first attacked by Spain
a gTeat many people probably will hold
Governor Walcott's telegram responsi
ble for that misfortune.
Dr. Eliot said that a number of stu
dents had enlisted, but he tho .ght they
were unwise. In this judgment he does
not agree with some other presidents
of great universities; but he speaks
â¢with greater authority because Har
vard's enrollment is greater than that
of any other educational Institution in
America.
grow Into months on our voyage we
began to realize with consternation
that we had an extremely long and un
pleasant trip before us from which
there was no escape. The very first
spell of rough weather had weakened
our enthusiasm and now we were left
without that wonderful buoyant ele
ment. There is nothing to break the
monotony but an occasional school of
porpoises giving us chasr, or a flock
of flying firh rising out of the water
and scudding away before the wind,
resembling a "flock" of birds more than
a "school" of fish. We are. so eager for
any kind of excitement or change that
the of "Sail, x.o!" will send us all
Bcampering up on deck with as great
a hubbub as would be justifiable if we
sighted the Flying Dutchman.
The kind of food used to provision a
vessel for so long a voyage is neces
sarily badâ consisting of salted meats
and dried and canned vegetablesâ and
we begin to grow tired a:. I sick of it.
Never in all my life have I experienced
such disgust and repugnance of any
thing as I did ."or the eternal monotony
of eating. It seemed that we did noth
ing but eat and sleep, and so soon as
one meal w^ould be cleared from the
tabl another would seem to be ready.
Sixty days after leaving ew York
we sighted land at Montevideo, Uru
guay, and I imagine â  enthusiasm
and excitement-were equal to that on
board the Santa Maria when Columbus
first sighted the land of America.
The sixty days' voyage had seemed
much longer to us, unaccustomed as we
were to traveling by water, and our
eagerness to set foot on land once more
was unbounded. Just as we were about
to enter the harbor, however, and when
our anticipations were highest, a gale
struck us and carried us a hundred
miles out to sea again and for three
days we were hove to. When we did
finally reach Montevideo we were so
sick of the confinement and monotony
that we all went ashore and abandoned
ourselves after the fashion of all good
s 3. i 1 o rs
After a stay of three days at this
place we proceeded to the Straits of
Magellan, whither we arrived fifteen
days later. We had intended to stop
and prospect for gold in Terra del Fu
ego and Patagonia, but after a general
survey of the grounds and some con
versation with the white settlers we
abandoned the idea.
Our aim was now to get through the
straits and out into the Pacific Ocean.
The distance through from the Atlan
tic to the Pacific is 300 miles, and it
proved to be the most difficult, as well
as the most eventful, part of the whole
voyage.
It must be understood that the tide
sets strongly from the Pacific to the
Atlantic through the straits, and that
the wind prevails from the southwest
eleven months in the year. It is not
a mild, steady breeze by any means,
but it ranges from a gentle
zephyr to a tornado and changes from
one extreme to the other so quickly
that navigation by sail is next to im
possible. From the day we entered
the straits to the day we got out into
the Pacific we had either a dead calm
or a heavy gale. Never did we have
a moderate breeze for more than three
hours at any one time.
We were just twenty-six days mak
ing through and not a moment was
lost when sailing was possible. There
are anchorages marked by beacons at
distances of about twenty-five miles
apart, and it is considered a good
day's work from one to the next.
The straits are so narrow and wind
ing that sailing at night Is Impossible
and time and again we failed, by only
three or four miles, to reach our next
anchorage after twelve hours' tacking
and had to put back again.
While we were anchored at Punta
Arenas, which is the only town on the
straits, a very severe gale came up
and with both of. our anchors down
we began to drift acroes the ohannei
direct tor the xoÂ«Jcy shorÂ© on th* op-
posite side. At this critical moment
one of our anchor chains snapped and |
away went anchor and chain.
We thought we were done for, butf
as fortune would have it our others
anchor fouled a sunken wreck and held!
on so fast that all our efforts for the*
next three days failed to clear it. But
it saved us from drifting: ashore.
The fourth day we had a calm and
somehow or other, while we were
floating about, the anchor came loose of:
itself. This was New Year's day and;
we were very pleased at the manner in
which the old anchor showed its pa
triotism.
But this was only the beginning of
our troubles. Fortescue Bay was our
next anchorar.e, and we spent one day
ashore looking for signs of gold. The
next day we essayed to get out, but
after beating all day against wind and
tide we put back there again. We re- <
peated this operation every morning for
nine days before we succeeded.
The eighth day we had got within one
mile of our next port when # a terriflo
storm came down upon us dead ahead,
and we were compelled to run all the
way back under bare poles. We raised
sail in an attempt to go around a sharp
turn, but it was blown into ribbons.
These s\idden storms are called by the
Chileans "williwas."
There is a remarkable thing about
the winds in the straits. There i 3 a
great range of mountain peaks Â«,n
either side of the straits, completely
walling them in, and as we sailed along
abreast of the opening between theso
peaks the wind was so strong that we
could barely carry double-reefed sails.
Suddenly, as we passed the opening and
came abreast of the mountain we were
"blanketed" by it and would be left
in a dead calm. Several times we were
left thus, helpless with the wind blow
ing a gale overhead.
January is the midsummer month
down here, but for all of this the moun
tain range was completely capped
with huge glaciers and snow. Right
beneath this at the foot of the peaks
the valleys shone with all the luxurious
verdure of a tropical summer.
On the 20th of January we sailed out
into the open sea. A3 night approached
we saw the last of those bristling rocks
that had been such a menace to us and
we were not a bit sorry.
That night a terrific gale struck us
and we expected to be blown back on
the rocks. We had just passed one
of the small boats of the big wrecked
steamer Mataura, which lay on the
rocks within a few miles of us, an ac
count of which appeared in The Call
in the latter part of January. It is
impossible to describe the feeling of ap
prehension and misery that pervaded
our little community that night. For
tunately the wind hauled enough to al
low us to make an offing, but the fury
of the gale never abated for one mo
ment until we actually ran clear out
of its latitude, which was ten days
afterward.
After this we had clean sailing right
up to the line and all was buoyancy
and hope as we flew along past the fly-
Ing spray.
On March 1, Just forty days from
the straits, we sighted a sail. This
was absolutely the first signs of life
we had seen in all this time. To be
sure it was far away from us and only
the highest sails were visible, but it
was life and served to break the de
pressing monotony. By this time our
provisions were all stale and barely
eatable. It's well enough for sailors
and old seamen to talk about salt beef ;
and hard tack being good enough, etc.,
but for we landlubbers it was worse
than any picture of Klondike suffer
ing we had seen.
In fact, the very subject of Klondike
or our final destination in Alaska was
never mentioned. We only hoped and
prayed for San Francisco. We expect
ed to be there within ten or fifteen
days, and so great was our anxiety
that it was hard to restrain ourselves
from going in the rigging to look for
land, though we knew it was hundreds
of miles away. It was at this time
that we ran into the northwest gales
that kept us out so long.
On March 10 we were within three
days' run of San Francisco. During
the next twenty-five days we were con
tinually tossed about by gales and high
seas without one moment's rest.
Without exaggeration, our little boat
was not far from being a lunatic asy
lum. Every conceivable thing was re
sorted to to occupy our minds and
maintain our composure and fortitude.
Three times we were within four
hours of the harbor and were blown
back before terrific gales. Had our
boat been the least unseaworthy she
would not have survived the last gale
we had.
We really had very little hope for our
lives and it is an experience that I
would not pass through again for any
conceivable price. We were now living
on salt meat and bread and the water
was too stale to drink. We had to drink
it in the form of tea or coffee, and it
was bad at that. We knew our friends
at home were anxious for us, and in
our poorly nourished and depressed
condition it was no wonder that now
and then some poor fellow would steal
away into a corner ~nd have it out
with himself.
We have tacked up a clipping of a
Klondiker's letter to a San I rancisco
paper, which we have paraphrased to
suit our cwn case. It 's as *->llows:
In after years, when I take my
grandchildren on my knee and
tell them of my experience in
Alaska, If they don't get down
on tiie floor and howl, I will lam
baste h out of them."
As I Bald before, we are going to
stick it out, and we all feel sure that
the worst of our experience is over,
and that nothing in Alaska will be as
hard to endurA as was our terrible con
finement of six months at nea.

WONDERS OF THE ELECTRIC ARC
Metals Melted and Welded in the Blacksmith-Shop
of the Future.
PROFESSOR ELJHU THOMSON
of Lynn, Mass., has developed a
new use for the electric arc
which has a special interest in
these days of war scares. It is
a process, moreover, which will
be put to good use in machine shops
all over the world.
It is, in short, a simple method for
perforating harveyizedplates.which are
used as an outer protective skin for
our men-of-war. A harveyized plate
is, popularly speaking, a sheet of iron
which has been excessively case-hard
ened. The surface of the metal is al
most as hard as glass; the interior is
comparatively soft and serves as a
backbone to support the outer casing.
Sometimes it is necessary to bore holes
in this outer casing, a rather discour
aging process, because the steel is
really as hard as the drill which is used
to perforate it. Professor Thomson
now comes forward with a small in
strument which generates an electric
arc and which will fuse a hole through
this hard steel surface in an instant.
There is nothing very remarkable
about the instrument itself; it is the
idea which is novel. The tool Js pri
marily two metal points, each one of
which constitutes the end of a broken
circuit. These two points are clamped
very close together. When a current

English war-brig that had riddled the pirate saw nothing
but the peaceful old tub ahead and went on into the fog,
looking for the other.
"Any port in a storm. Angel," remarked Captain
Swarth, as he flashed his keen eyes over the rickety fab
ric aloft; "but we'll find a better one soon. How do the
boys stand the pumping?"
Mr. Angel Todd, first mate and quartermaster, filled
a black pipe before answering. Then, between the first
and second deep puffs he said: "Growlin'â dammum."
"At the work?"
"Yep, and the grub. And they say the 'tween deck
and forecastle smells o' bedbugs and bilge water â and
they want their grog. "An ungodly witness scorneth
judgment; and the mouth of the wicked devoureth in
iquity.' " Mr. Todd had been educated for the Methodist
pulpit; but. going out as a missionary, he had fallen into
ungodly ways himself on the slave coast and taken to the
sea. where he was more successful. Many of ills old
phrasings clung to him. _
"Well," drawled the captain, "men get fastidious and
high toned in this business â can't blame them, but we've
got to make the coast, and if we don't pick up something
on the way we must careen and stop the leak. Then
they'll have something to growl about."
"S'pose the brig follows us in? "
"Hope she will," said Captain Swarth, with a pleasant
smile and a lightening of his eyesâ "hope she will, and
give me a chance. Her majestic widowship owes 'me a
brig, and that's a fine one." Mr. Todd had never been
known to smile, but at this speech he lifted one eyebrow
and turned his saturnine fa.cc full, at his superior, in
quiry written upon every line of it. Captain Swarth
was musing, however, and said no more; so the mate,
his long figure down the poop-ladder, and went forward to
harass the men â which, in their opinion, was all he was
good for.
According to his mood, Mr. Todd's speech was choicest
English, or the cosmopolitan, technical slang of the sea,
mingled with wonderful profanity. But one habit of his
early days he never droppedâ Vbe wore, in the hottest
weather, and in storm and battle, the black frock and
choker of the clerical profession. Standing now, with one
foot on the fore hatch, waving his long arms and objur
gating the scowling men at the pumps, he might easily
have seemed, to any one beyond the reach of his language,
to be a clergyman exhorting them. Captain Swarth
watched him with an amused look on his sun-burned face,
and muttered, "Good man, every inch of him, but he can't
handle men." Then he called him aft.
"Angel." he said, "we made a mistake !n cutting the
ports; we can't catch anything afloat that sees them, so
flow from one point to the other when
they are so separated, but when these
two points are held against a steel plato
the latter completes a very imperfect
electric circuit. It is just as though
you held the tips of two fingers near
together against a board. The cur.
rent of electricity flows down one fin
ger or point across the surface of the
plate to the other point and so on back
to the dynamo.
But this connection, electrically
speaking, is very bad, and when an
electric current encounters a bad con
nection it always makes things hot' for
it. In fact, if the points are held
against the plate for more than a mo
ment the surrounding parts would fuse.
In actual work, however, the little sec
tion of plate situated between the two
points of the fusing-tool is instantly
softened and can be easily drilled.
Heretofore there has been great trou

this new and simple process will now
remove all the difficulty.
Elihu Thomson is the high priest of
electric welding, and in his laboratory
in Lynn, Mates., he is constantly trying
to develop new uses for the electric

is being made, or where some welding
is being done by contract.
The process is very simple. Two
wires, for instance, are placed end to
end in the machine and the current is
turned on. Immediately the two ends
where they touch become white hot.
The current is instantly switched off,
the ends cool and the two wires have
become one. The joint is a little blv
swelled where the machine has pushed
the ends hard together, but the joim.
itself is just as much a single piece ot
metal as any other portion of the wires.
The operation is performed more rap
idly than it takes to tell it, and one
man may so weld thousands of bars to
gether in a day.
The reason the current so acts is as
follows: Every piece of metal resists
the passage of a current of electricity

Thrw days later, with Cape St. Roche a black Una
to the westward, a round shot across her bows brought
the vc-ssel â minus the black emblem now, and outwardly
respectableâ up to the wind, with malntopsail aback,
while Captain Swarth and a dozen of his menâ equally
respectable In the nondescript rig of the merchant sailor
âwatched the approach of an English brlg-of-war. Mr.
Todd and the rest of the crew were below hatches with
the guns.
The brig came down the wind like a graceful birdâ a
splendid craft, black, shiny and shipshape, five guns to
a side, brass-bound officers on her auarter-deck, blue â¢
jackets darted about her white deck and up aloft a home
ward-bound pennant trailing from her main truck, and at
her gaff end a British ensign as large as her main royal.
Captain Swarth lazily hoisted the English (lag to the
bark's griff, and, as the brig rounded to on his weather
beam, he pointed to it; but his dark eyeÂ« sparkled envi
ously as he viewed the craft whose Government's protec
tion he appealed to.
"Bark ahoy," came a voice through a trumpet; "what
bark Is that?" Captain Swarth swung himself into the
mizzen ripping and answered through his hands with an
excellent cockney accent: "Tryde Wind, o' Lunnon,
Cappen Quirk, fifty-woon dyes out fro' Leeverpool, bound
to Callao, general cargo."
"You were not heading for the Horn.'*
"Him a leakin' badly. Him a goin' to myke the coast

An officer Left the group and returned with what
Captain Swarth knew was a chart, which a few of them
studied, while their captain hailed again:
"See anything more of that pirate brig the day?"
"What! Whenâ a peerate? Be 'c a peorate?" answered
Captain Swarth. in agitated tones. "Be tnat you a-chasin'

The captain conferred with his officers a moment, then
called:
"We are going in to careen ourselves. That fellow

and Rio's too far to run back. Follow us -in: but if you

"Aye, that hi will. Thankee. Good marnin .
In three hours the brig was a speck under the rising
land ahead, In another she was out of sight; but before
this Captain Swartli and his crew had held a long confer
ence, which resulted in sail being shortened, though the
man at the wheel was given a straight course to the bay
described by the English captain.
Late on the following afternoon the old bark blundered
Into this bayâ a rippling sheet of water, bordered on all
sides by a sandy beach. Stretching up to the mountainous
country inland was a luxurious forest of palm, laurel and
cactus", bound and intertwined by almost impassable
undergrowth, and about half-way from tne entrance to
the end of the bay was the English brig, moored ana
slightly careened on the inshore beach. Captain Swarth's
seamanly eye noted certain appearances of the tackles
that held her down, which told him that the work was
done and she was being slacked upright. "Just in time,
he muttered.
They brought the bark to anchor near the beach, about
a half-mile from the brig toward the entrance, furled tho
canvas and ran out an anchor astern with the cable over
the taffrail. Heaving on this, they brought the vessel
parallel with the shore. So farâ good. Guns and cargo
lightered ashore, more anchors seaward to keep her oft
the beach, masthead tackles to the trees to heave her
down and preventer rigging and bracos to assist the masts
would have been next in order, but they proceeded no
further toward careening. Instead they lowered the two
crazy boats, provisioned and armed them on the in-shoro
side of the bark, made certain other preparationsâ and
waited.
On tho deck of the English brig things were moving.
A gang of blue jackets, under the first lieutenant, were
heaving In the cable; another gang, under the boatswain,
Vere sending down and stowing away the heavy tackles
and careening gear, tailing out halliards and sheets and
coiiing down the light running rigging, while topmen aloft
loosed the canvas to bunt-gaskets, ready to drop It at the
call from the de<k.
The second lieutenant, overseeing this latter, paced the
port quarterdeck and answered remarks from Captain
Bunce, who paced the sacred starboard side (the brig being
at anchor), and occasionally turned his glass on tne
dilapidated craft down the beach.
"Seems to me, Mr. Shack." he said across the deck,
"that an owner Â»who would send that bdrk around the
Horn and the master who would take her ought to be
sequestered and cared for, either in an asylum or in jail."
"Yes, sir: I think so, too," answered the second lieu
tenant, looking aloft. "Might be an Insurance job. Clear
away that bunt-gasket on the royal yard," he added in
a roar.
Captain Bunceâ round, rosy, with brilliant mutton-chop
whiskersâ muttered: "Insurance â wrecked intentionallyâ
no, not here where we are; wouldn't court investigation
by her majesty's officers." He rolled forward, then aft
and looked again through the glass.
"Very large erew â very large," he said, "very curious,
Mr. Shack."
A hail from the forecastle, announcing that the anchor
was short, prevented Mr. Shack ansÂ»wrring. Captain
Bunce waved a deprecatory hand to the first lieutenant,
who came aft at unco, while Mr. Shack descended to the
waist and the boatswain ascended the forecastle steps to
attend to the anchor. The first lieutenant now had charge
of the brig, and from the quarterdeck gave his orders to
the crew, while Captain Bunce busied himself with his
glass and his thoughts.
Fore-and-aft sail was set and head sheets trimmed
down to port, square sails were dropped, sheeted home and
hoisted, foreyards braced to port, the anchor tripped and
lished and the brig paid off from the land breeze, and
with foreyards swung, steadied down to a course for the
entrance.
"Mr. Duncan," said the captain, "there are fully forty
men on that bark's deck, all dressed alikeâ all in rod shirts
and knitted caps, and all dancing aiound like madmen.
T.n. .k!" He handed the glass to the first lieutenant, who
brought it to bear.
"Strange," said the officer after a short scrutiny;
"there were only a few showing when we spoke her
outside. It looks as though they were all drunk."
As they drew near, sounds of singingâ uproarious dis
cordâreached them, and soon they could see with the
naked eye that the men on the bark were wrestling, danc
ing and running about.
"Quarters, sir?" inquired Mr. Duncan. "Shall we
bring-to, alongside?"
"Wellâ no â not yet," said the captain, hesitatingly; "it'a
all rightâ possibly; yet it is strange. Wait a little."
They waited and had sailed down almost abreast of the
gray old craft, noticing as they drew near an appreciable
diminution of the uproar, when a flag arose from the stern
of the bark, a dusky Hag that straightened out directly
toward them, bo that it was difficult to make out.
But they soon understood. As they reached a pomt
squarely abreast of th<' l^rk, flvu points of flame burst
from her innocent gray sides, fivo'clouds of smoke ascended
and five round shot, coming with the thunder of the guns,
hurtled through their rigging. Then they saw the design
of the flag, a white skull and cro^sbones, and noted
another, a black flag, too, but pennani -shaped, and show
ing in rudely painted letters the single word, "Swarth,"
sailing up to the forepeak.
"Thunder and lightning," roared Captain Bunce.
"Quarters. Mr. Duncan, quarters, and In with the kites.
Give it to them. Put about first."
A youngster of the crew had sprung below and imme
diately emerged with a drum which, without definite in
structi r>n. he hammered vigorously ; but before he had
begun men were clearing away gunsandmanningflying-jib
down-haul and royal clew-lines. Others sprang to stations,
anticipating all that the sharp voice of the first lieutenant
could order. Around came the brig on the other 'tack and
sailed back, receiving another broadside through her rig
ging and answering with her starboard guns. Then for a
time the din was deafening. The brig bacKed her main
yards and sent broadside after broadside tnto the hull of
the old craft. But it was not until the eighth had had
gone that Captain Bunce noticed through the smoke that
the pirates were not firing. The smudge from the burning
canvas port coveriners had deluded him. He ordered a
cessation. Fully forty solid shot had torn through that
old hull near the water-line, and not a man could now be
seen on her deck.
"Out with the boats. Mr. Duncan." he said; "they're
drunk, or crazy, but they're the men we want. Capture
them."
"Suppose they run, sirâ suppose they take to their boats
and get into the woods, shall we follow?
"No, not past the beachâ not into an ambush.
The four boatloads of men which put off from the brig
found nothing but a deserted deck on the sinking bark
and two empty boats hauled up on the hoacn. The pirates
were in the woodsâ undoubtedly, having kept the bark
between themselves and the brig- as they pulled ashore.
The two lieutenants conferred for a few moments, while
the blue jackets clustered around tne bows of their boats
and watched nervously the line of the forest up the beach,
from which bullets might come at any time, and had
decided to put back, when a rattling chorus of pistol
reports sounded from the depths of the woods. It died
away then was heard a crashing of bush and nranen, and
out upon the sands sprang a figureâ a long, wierd figure
in black frock of clerical cut. Into their midst it sped with
mighty bounds, and sinking down, lifted a glad face to tho
heavens with the groaning utterance: <1 0, God, I thank
thee. Protect me, gentlemenâ protect me from those
wicked men. 1 ' . _

who had listened thoughtfully, said: "You speak of treas

Mr. Todd opened wide his eyes, looked toward the dark
shades of the forest, then at the three masts of 'the bark
sticking out of the water, and answered, Impressively.
"Gentlemen, they did not. They were Intoxicatedâ
with liquor. They took arms and a knapsack of food to
each manâ they spoke of an inland retreat to which tney
â¢were goingâ but the treasure from the passenger shipâ tne
bars of gold and the bags of diamondsâ they forgot. They
transferred it from their sinking vessel when sober, but
when intoxicated they remembered food and left it behind.
Gentlemen, there is untold wealth In the hull out there
which your fire has sunk. .It is, verily, the root of all evil;
let us hope that it remains at the bottom of the sea.
"Bars of goldâ bags of diamonds," said Mr. Duncan.
"Come on board. Mr. Todd; we'll see what the captain
thinks." _ .
During the breakfast the two lieutenants reported the
results of a survey which they had taken of the wreck at
daylight. :
"We find." said Mr. Duncan, "about nine feet of water
over the deck at the stern and about three feet over the
fore-hatch at low tide. The topgallant forecastle is awash
and the end of the bowsprit out of water, so that we can
easily reach the upper ends .of the bobstays. There id
about five feet rise and fall of tide. Now, we have no
pontoons nor casks. Our only plan, captain, is to lift
her bodily." -. . :i; >~ â  :
"And we have a diving suit and air pump," said Mr.
Shack, enthusiastically, "and fifty men ready to dive
without suits. We can raise her, captain. In two weeks,"
. "Gentlemen," said Captain .Bunce, grandly. "I have
full faith in your seamanship and skill. I leave the work
in your hands." Which was equivalent to an admission
that- he was fat and lazy, and did not care to take an
active part.
"Thank you. sir." said Mr. Duncan, and "thank you,
sir." said Mr. Shack; then the captain said other pleasant
things, which brought other pleasant responses, and th->
breakfast passed so agreeably that Mr. Todd, in spite of
the soul-felt yearning for a smoke inspired by the cigars
in the mouths of the others, felt the influence of the
enthusiasm and bestowed his blessingâ qualifiedly on the
enterprise. â¢ .. . - . -?-i.;-'
Every man of the brig's crew was eager for the work,
but few could engage at first: for there was nothing but
the forecastle deck and the bark's rigging to stand upon.
In three days the bark's nose was as high as the seven
part tackle would bring it, with as many men heaving as
could find room at the windlass brakes. Then they clapped
a luff tackle on the fall, and by heaving on this, nippering
and fleeting up, they lifted the forehatch and forecastle
scuttle 'out of â which was enough. Before this
another gang had" been able to slip the other chain to
position abaft the mizzenmast, hook on the tackle and
lead the fall through a snatchblock at the quarter bit
forward to the midship capstan. Disdaining the diving
suit, they swam down nine feet to do these things, and
When they had towed the rope forward they descended
â seven feet to wind it around the capstan and ship the
' barsâ which they found in a rack at the mainmast.
.. A man in the water weighs practically nothing, and to
heave around a capstan under water requires lateral
resistance. To secure this they dived with hammers and
nails, and fastened a circle of cleats to catch their feet.
Then, with a boy on the main fiferail (his head out) hold-
Ing slack, eighteen menâ three to a â would inhale all
the air their lungs would hold, and with a "one, two.
three," would flounder down, push the capstan around a
few pawls and come up, gasping blue in the face â
perch on their bars and recover. It went slowly, this
end, but in three days more they could walk around with
their heads above water.
' In the morning the work was resumed and more boxes
sprinkled the bay. They drifted up with the flood and
back they came with the ebb tide; but among them now
were about forty others, unobserved by captain Bunco
pacing his quarterdeck,, but noted keenly by Mr. Todd.
These forty drifted slowly to the off-shore side of tne
brig and stopped, bobbing up and down on the crisp
waves. Â«yea -though the wind blew briskly with the tide
and they .should have gone on With the others. It was
then that Captain Bunce stepped, below for a cigar, and it
was then that Mr. Todd became strangely excited, hop
ping along the port rail and throwing overboard every
rope's end within reach, to the wonder and scandal of an
open-eyed steward In the cabin j door, who immediately
apprised the captain.
Captain Bunce, smoking a freshly lit cigar, " emerged
to witness a shocking sight the good and noiy Mr. Todd,
with an intense expression on his somber countenance,
holding a match to a black pipe and puffing vigorously,
while through the ports and over the rail red-shirted men,
dripping wet and scowling, were boarding his brig. Each
man carried a cutlass and 12-inch knife, and Captain
Bunco needed no special Intelligence to know that he wad
tricked. -â  -
One hail only he gave, and Mr. Todd. his pipe glowing
like a hot coal, was upon him. The' captain endeavored to
draw his sword,' but sinewy arms encircled him, his cigar
was removed from his lips and inserted in the mouth of
Mr. Todd alongside the pipe, and he was lifted, spluttering
with astonishment and rage, borne to the rail and dropped
overboard, his sword clanking against the side as he
-descended. When he came to the surface and looked up,
he saw through a cloud of smoke on the rail the lantern
jaws of Mr. Todd working convulsively on pipe and cigar
and heard the angry utterance: "Yes, d n ye. I smoke."
Then a thundering voice behind Mr. Todd roared out:
"Kill nobodyâ toss 'em overboard." and tne captain saw
his servants, cooks and stewards tumbling over to join
him.
Captain Bunce turned and swam, there was nothing
else to do. Soon he could see a black-eyed, bla-ck-mus
tachrd man on his quarter-deck delivering orders, and he
recognized the thundering voice he had heard, but none
of the cockney accent of Captain Quirk. Men were already
on the yards loosing canvas, and as he turned on his back
to rest â for though fleshy and buoyant, swimming in full
uniform fatigued himâ he saw his anchor chains whizzing
out the hawse pipes.
He was picked up by the first boat to put off from the
bark, and ordered pursuit, but this was soon seen to be
useless. The clean-lined brig had sternway erjual to the

thirteen stars, white in a blue field,
representing a new constellation."
It seems as though the committee
that decided on the flagâ George Wash
ington, Robert Morris and Colonel
Ross â must, when it drafted the reso
lutions, have had in mind Dryden's
lines:
A constellation Is but one.
Thong- 'tis a train of stars.
Old Glory: Tes. The flag is old as
national emblems go; for, though just
completed its one hundredth and twen
ty-first year, it is older than all the
flaps of the great nations of Western
Europe. The flag of Great Britain
dates in its present form from the
foundation of the United Kingdom, in
1S00; the French tricolor was adopted
in 1794; the German and Italian ban
ners are no older than the existing
retrime of those countries, and the j
Spanish adopted theirs in 1785.
The first flag, made under the direc
tion, of the committee appointed to de
sign it, had its thirteen stars In a cir
cle on a blue field, typical of perpet
uity, and the story is that the three
members employed Mrs. John Ross,
who kept a little upholstery shop on
Arch street, in Philadelphia., to make
it. To Mrs. Ross, it is said, we owe the
five-pointed star, for the committee
had decided on six points. The legend
also is that at the time the flag was
adopted John Paul Jones was appoint
ed to the command of the continental
Fhip-of-war Ranger, and that he was
the first to raise the stars and stripes,
whtch floated over his ship.
The stars ai:d stripes as formally
adopted were the outcome of many
changes, and it was long before the
cross of Pt. fleÂ«ir?e was dropped from
previous flags that appeared in the
colonies immediately before and during
the first two years of the Revolutio-n.
Early in 1775 an American insurgent
fine appeared in New England bear
ing the red cross of St. George, and
booh the pine tree â adopted by New
England generally â was united with
the cross. The Puritans looked with
disfavor on the cross, and it wa?
dropped. Then the pine tree appeared
alone, or in connctio-n with the mot-
I "Liberty Tree," "An Appeal to
God."
From the New England navy flag of
1776 all suggestions of a cross disap
peared, and the pine tree, between the
ANNA DICKIE'S CURIOUS PROPHECY
WHEN SHE CHRISTENED THE OLYMPIA.
THE proudest little lady in the
land to-day is Miss Anna Dickie,
daughter of George W. Dickie,
managing director of the Union
Iron Works.
Miss Dickie's pride is quite pardon
able, too, for she had the honor of shed
ding the first blood for the new navy.
It came about this way.
When the cruiser Olympia was ready
fr-r launching, it was decided that Miss
Dickie should act as godmother and
christen the ship. There were some re
iic;ious objections offered by the ultra
pious regarding the use of champagne
i: t the ceremony, but this point was
finally settled in favor of the wine,
with the stipulation that only the na
tive product was to be used.
Many will remember the excitement
created when it was announced that
the day had been set and the future
pride of the new navy would meet her
native element, on November s, lÃ92. All
San Francisco was anxious to see the
spectacle and seats were at a premium.
Tugs and other small craft had been
engaged weeks ahead, .-ill b.-ing decked
Avith gay bunting, our national emblem
predominating, of course.
At last the exciting moment arrived.
A breathlt-Fs pause â the sound of ham
mers â and, whiz, the big vessel swept
down to kiss the waters.
As the good ship slid along the ways
Miss Dickie raised a bottle of cham
jvtcrne and brought it down with a
crash over the bows of the vessel.
Whistles shrieked, cannon boomed and
people shouted themselves hoarse. At
this juncture a smile of fortitude was
WHEN ANNA DICKIE CHRISTENED THE CRUISER OLYMPIA.
Anna Dickie, as she was on November 5, 1892, when she christened the United States cruiser Olympia.
Anna was born in San Francisco August 28, 1885. She is the youngest child and only daughter of G. W. Dickie, the
jaanaging director of the Union Iron Works. She is now attending school in San Mateo, but believes more in a plenti
ful use of her wheel and tennis racquet than in hard study. She rejoices to know that the Olympia helped Commodore
Dewey and his brave officers and men to secure the notable victory at Manila, and trusts that the Philippine Islands
will soon be opened up to receive the priceless benefits of liberty and civilization.
When Anna Dickie christened the Olympia she cut a finger on the champagne bottle. Turning to her father, she
said, prophetically: "This vessel will shed the first blood in war for the defense of her country." That was in 1892, long
before trouble with Spain was dreamed of. The Olympia was Admiral Dewey's flagship before Manila and led the fight.
two mottoes above given, stood on a
white field, bordered top and bottom
with blue stripes. Vessels of the Uni
ted States navy flew this flag for some
time.
At Lexington there was no American
flag, but two months later, at Bunker
Hill, there were several. One was red,
bearing only the defiant motto "Come
if you dare." Another was blue, with
a white canton quartered by a red St.
George Cross and a pine tree at the top
inner corner.
At this time Rhode Island had a
white flag, bearing a blue cross in the
center, and New York likewise flew a
white banner with a black beaver.
South Carolina first adopted, in 1775,
a blue flag with a crescent moon in the
upper corner next to the staff, but this
flag fell into disuse, and the Gadsden
flag of yellow, displaying a rattlesnake
having thirteen rattles, with the mot
to, "Do not tread on me," took its place
in 1776, and met with great favor.
It was really Benjamin Franklin who
gave the snake to American heraldry,
when, in his Philadelphia Gazette in
1754, he pictured the colonies as a snake
in thirteen parts, with the legend
"Unite or die."
South Carolina, through her dele
gate to the Central Congress, adopted
the idea, and in 1776 the rattlesnake of
the South and the pine tree of the
North were united. It was Paul Jones'
first flag. He had the green pine tree
in the center of a white banner, with
noticeable on Miss Dickie's counte
nance, as if something had happened
to cause her pain. In the excitement
of the moment this incident was quite
overlooked by the spectators, bat some
observing people wondered why she
wrapped her handkerchief around h-er
finger, where it remained the rest of
the day.
When the news was t'.'le_!?raphod
around the world that brave Dewey
had met and defeated the Spanish fleet
at Manila, it occurred to a Call man to
ask Miss Dickie what she thought of
the behavior of her ship. He found
her most enthusiastic over the news,
which was fully shared by her father.
Mr. Dickie was prr.-ud of the ship
whose every bolt and rivet, from keel
to truck, had been built under his per
sonal supervision.
Miss Dickie did
not seem to care to
discuss the subject
of the slight acci
dent that occurred
when the vessel
was launched. But
the proud father
was less reticent.
He said, "It is a
very insignificant
affair," but admits
that it verifies the
old saying that
there is still a lit
tle bit of innate su
perstittion left in
the whole human
family, which
neither education
nor civilization can
eradicate.

the rattlesnake coiled at its foot, and
the mottoes "An appeal to God" and
"Don't tread on me."
Commodore Esek Hopkins In 1776
also raised the rattlesnake, with the
"Don't tread on me" motto, but he had
the reptile lying across thirteen red and
white stripes. Those stripes had come
to stay.
This same snake and motto were on
the flag of the Culpeper minute men,
with the additional legend "Liberty or
Death."
"Liberty or Death" was a common
legend to be seen on many banners.
In 1876 it was carried at White Plains
on a white flag that bore a naked
sword, crossed with a baton carrying
a liberty cap.
While this change in flags was going
on the cross of St. George was still
seen, and in connection with the thir
teen white and red stripes, that grew
rapidly in popularity. The iloyal Sav
age, on Lake Champlain, in 1776, flew
this cross with the thirteen stripes.
The stars and stripes became more
and more common before our flag was
adopted in 1777. First the stripes, as in
the flags on the Royal Savage and
Commodore Hopkins' ship. Then came
the stars. These were often associated
with other emblems, and particularly
the eagle. There was a flag with its
thirteen red and white stripes that
bore a blue field in the middle of its
upper half on which was an eagle sur
rounded by stars. There was another
that showed Washington leaning on a
cannon, and behind him stars and
stripes and an eagle, the eagle hold-
Ing in his beak a scroll bearing the
words "E pluribus unum," and grasp
ing thunderbolts of war with one talon,

! my daughter broke the bottle over the
', ship's bow, according to a time-hon

j down over the bow and left a small
crimson streak along the rail. She did
not cry out or faint â she is a San Fran
cisco girl â but turned to me with a
i queer little smile, and exclaimed: "See,
> father! It is a good omen. The first
'â  blood for the new navy. Let me make
; a prophecy. This will be the first ship
: of the new navy to shed blood for our
i nation's honor.'
"So you see." said Mr. Dickie, "our
love for the Olympia is quite pardon
; able. She is one of the family, as it
I were."
while the other held the olive branch
of peace.
Then came the flag adopted by Con
gress. The first intention was to add
a stripe and a star for each new State
that entered the Union, but while this
was found convenient so far as the
stars went, it proved very troublesome
when the stripes began to multiply.
In the war of ISI2, after Vermont and
Kentucky were admitted, our flag had
fifteen stars and fifteen stripes, but
when the number got up to twenty it
was decided to return to the original
thirteen stripes, which was done by
act of Congress in ISIB, the addition of
a new star for each new State remain
ing as it was before.
First the stars were arranged in a
Just how much of a prophet Miss
Dickie is the reader must judge. Cer
tain it is that the Olympia was Com
modore Dewey's flagship in one of the
greatest battles known in modern his
tory. Miss Dickie- certainly does not
fit the novelist's description of the
wltchlike soothsayer worn threadbare
in fiction. She is just a demure little
San Francisco maiden, born in this city
thirteen years ago. and was but
years of age when she christened the
Olympia.
WHY BALD
HEADS SHINE.
MONS. SEBOURAND, former
pupil of M. Pasteur's school,
has found the mighty microbe
that makes men and women
lose their hair â the little beast
who Is responsible for the shiny pate of
the unfortunate baldhead. He describes
it as a minute, colorless body, pointed
at both ends, and increasing in num
bers by constant division into two, and
since the divisions do not always im
mediately break off, long chains fre
quently form, each link being a dis
tinct microbe.
The pestiferous organism congre
j gates in colonies of enormous numbers
in the upper part of the hair follicle
below the epidermis, and just where
the sweat gland Joins the follicle. At
this point there is somewhat of an en
largement, and in this little cavity it
finds a convenient habitat. Each col
ony is wrapped up into a kind of co
coon by fatty matter from the seba
ceous gland; the cocoons vary in size,
and are easy to obtain by squeezing
the skin at the mouth of the gland. '-
The microbe of baldness has been
Isolated and grown as a culture on a
suitable medium, when it appears as a
colorless form, changing later into one
of brick red hue. But how is it that
this microbe, not being at the root of
the hair, but at some distance above it
In the follicle, causes the hair to fall
out? Its method of attack is as fol
lows:
The development and growth of th?
microbe causes certain changes in its
environmentâ the breaking up, for In
stance, of substances around, from
which it obtains necessary food and
energy â and the cycle of results thus
brought about gives the production of
a substance poisonous to the root of a
hair. This toxin passes down to the
root and acts as a slow poison, not kill
ing all at once, but inducing certain
characteristic symptoms; the hair be
comes lighter in color until its pigment
has practically disappeared, its diam
eter gradually lessens, it becomes brit
tle and dried up and eventually dies
and falls out.
The root, though weakened by the
poison, sends up another hair to replace
the fallen one, but the new outgrowth
begins life feebler and poorer than its
predecessor, so it too, only with great
er speed, becomes a victim.
And so the process goes on; each
successive growth starts more weakly
its fight against the insinuating poison
and more quickly succumbs, until *
point is reached where the root can no
longer make a fresh effort, for it has
also fallen completely under the nox
ious Influence and is killed. This
course of events occurring, as it does,
simultaneously in hundreds of adja
cent hair follicles, naturaly results in
complete baldness.
To prove that this microbe is the
cause and not merely <he accompani
ment of baldness, M. Sebourand isolat
ed it and cultivated it in a suitable
liquid. After the microbes had multi
plied and developed he filtered the li
quid through porcelain, and believing
that, if his theories were true, the fil
tered liquid would contain the sub
stance they produced poisonous to the I
hair, he took a rabbit and Inoculated it
deeply under the skin with the fluid. !
As he hoped, the rabbit speedily began '
to lose its fur, and in six weeks it was
completely denuded; In fact, it had be
come entirely bald-
circle, then no rule was followed, and
they were often arranged so as to
form the letters U. S., and were also
put in in all sorts of irregular shapes
to represent a constellation. Finally
it was decided they should be put in in
regular rows, as at present.
So we have the flag as it is, with an
innovation in the revenue service,
where the stripes are perpendicular in
stead of horizontal.

LITTLE PALOMA SCHRAMM TELLS
WHAT SHE THINKS OF MELBA.
In a Letter to the Sunday Call She De
crlbes He Famous Interview With the
Diva, When She Played and Danced for
Her. Melba Mas So Delighted With the
Little Genius TV>al She Wanted to Take
the Child With Her to Parisâ Palorr>a
Promised to Meet Her There In the
Near future.
ITTL.E Paloma Schramm made a
g^ conquest of no less a personage
\ than Melba. It was not alone the
j genius of the remarkably gifted
child that made Melba marvel,
but the sweet unspoiled person
ality of Paloma,
Both Melba and Campanari had
heard much of the wonderful child
musician and they were both inclined
to believe that she was simply another
prodigy whose ability would become
mediocre with the years.
But after hearing her ] lj.y they said
that they had never heard anything
like it and that if she lived, hers would
be one of the names that would make
this century memorable.
"The technique is the least," said
Melba, "it is the soul, the delicacy, the
intelligence; that is what astounds me,
the intelligence with which she Inter
prets. She is a genius; not a talented
prodigy, but a genius."
And when , J aloma improvised from
the theme which Melba wrote for her
the tears rolled down the diva's face
and she caught the child in her arms
exclaiming:
"Where did you get it from, tell me â
your soul is music itself."
Mme. Melba, like every one else,
dwelt as much on Paloma's personality
as on her genius. For the child is
thoroughly natural; just a sweet hu
man flower of childhood; she has lived
in the garden most of the time among
the flowers and birds. She is as modest
as a wild flower and as refreshing in
her simplicity. Her face, in its delicate
purity, is as responsive to her feelings
as her fingers are to her music. When
she talks in her sweet childish way her
expression holds you even more than
her words. There is something inde
scribably spirituelle about her.
And little sister Karla is very much
like Paloma, only her dimples aJways
play hide and seek and the laughing
light in her blue eyes never dies out,
while Paloma's sometimes grow soft
with unshed tears and her face quivers
as thou. i with a pain that is half
sweet. Watch her when she plays
Chopin if you would see it.
People are constantly sending her
presents of all descriptions, but wise
parents allow her to accept as few as
possible and keep people from her as
much as they can.
"I am going to talk my letter and
have you write it out," Paloma said,
"because then people won't see my bad
spelling."
And people don't see the bad spelling,
but neither do they see c little girl
as she sat on the window sill next to
her bird cage, all the delicate contours
of her face brought out by the rays of
the sun that fell upon her; nor do they
hear the voice with which she said her
'letter"; that clear, flute-like voice
with its quaint German a- ent, and the
unaffected, modest childish way in
which she talked the following letter:
deputed to present it to him. She ran
up to his chair, her eyes sparkling with
joy, and put it into his hand.
He imediately thrust it from him, and
said, "Go and take it up, miss, and
present it to me as I have taught you."
She burst into tears, but obeyed.
"I consent to take it now, and I
thank you; but your elbow was not
quite rounded enough." â Youth's Com
panion.
MELBA AND PALOMA SCHRAMM.
(From a photograph taken during the diva's recent visit to this city.) T
DEAR CALL: I was so happy to hear Melba sing. Karla and I
sat in a box up to the stage, where we could see beautifully. I never
heard any one sing like that before.
I thought it almost was a dream, her voice was so clear. But
I was so sorry that I heard her in the Barber of Seville, because
that opera I do not like at all.
The singing was grand, but not the opera. And once they all had
to scream and it hurted my ears.
I like to write a letter this way, just talking and having you writ*
It down, because I have to ask you how to spell so many words in Eng
lish, but not so many in German. Sometimes I get the English all
twisted up.
Once I thought Melba looked right up and smiled at Karla and me.
It made us so happy, but we thought we imagined it only. , Then
she took a rose and kissed it and threw it at our box, right up. Karla
and I both put out our hands to catch it, but we couldn't reach It, and
it fell down. We would have liked to jump down after it.
Then, when Melba came out again, she kissed one other rose and
threw it at us. But it fell down. We felt like crying, and then the
violinist down in the orchestra, who caught it, threw it straight into our
box.
Karla and I are going to always keep that rose. Mamma pressed It
and put it away for us.
I love roses. When we are at home Karla and I take the roses
and squeeze out the juice and paint with it.
Once we played millinery store and I took a book and drew some
hats and colored them with the juioe of flowers. Mamma said she
liked them all so much she didn't know which one to choose. Of course
she was playing make believe, too.
We were so sorry that the opera was over. But on Sunday mamma,
papa, Karla and I went to see Melba. She was, oh, so lovely.
Melba and Mr. Campanari wrote themes for me and I played on
Melba's own piano. I was very happy while I was playing. There
were very many flowers in the room and they smelled sweet.
Then Karla played a dance and Melba took my hands and danced
with me. I cannot dance, so I just, with the music, kept time with my
feet.
Then one of the gentlemen took our pictures very many times. I
sat on Melba's lap and we had one taken, and then Melba and Karla
and I put our arms around so, and had one, and I had one sitting all
alone at Melba's own Steinway and very many others.
Melba asked me to come with her, but I told her I could do It not
without mamma and papa and Karla.
She said we could all come. I hope we do.
I was sorry to kiss her good-by. But we did not say good-by; we
said "auf wiedersehen."
And Melba says she is goinfc to send me a big doll, so high, from
Paris that can walk and talk and sing.
Oh, I liked her so very much. I always close my letters with love,
bo I will this one, too; so please write down, "With love to The Call and
every one." PALOMA.

"The plan I followed in Alaska proved
equally successful in Honolulu, where
our organization is now very strong,

the people were in sympathy with the

"In Australia I was more than satis

which I was in time aided by many
zealous co-workers. In that country I
held a mission for the promotion of
Gospel temperance work. I also got out

adapted to the occasion.
"The movement was so widespread
that colonial unions, corresponding to
our State unions, were formed and I

Union of Australia was organized.
"As the work established in the pro
vinces as well as upon the islands
needed fostering I was requested to re
main a year and give the newly organ
ized unions my personal superintend
ance, an offer which I accepted.
"It was on the pearling grounds off
the west coast of Australia, between
that country and Java, that I had the
novel experience of going down to the
bottom of the sea in a diving suit, the
first woman, I was assured by the cap
tain of the pearling fleet, who had ever
done so. The captain was my faithful
champion in the adventure, which my
friends did their best to discourage.
"One of the most necessary precau
tions to be observed by divers is that
all vital organs are thoroughly pro
tected against sudden and for
this purpose I donned two suits of
heavy hand-knit underwear.
"A great lead shield was placed upon
my back and another over my chest,
to which the front signal line was at
tached; these shields weighed twenty
pounds apiece. With a great effort I
was got into the heavy rubber suit,
which covered me from neck to feet,
upon which were drawn shoes weighing
thirty-two pounds.
"My head was protected by an iron
helmet with glass globes, through
which' l could peer, and this was fas
tened about my neck with an iron band
or hoop. Then they tied a heavy rope
around my waist, pumped air into the
suit and I was ready to explore that
part of old ocean which lay below the
ship.
'As the diving suit which encased me
weighed ISO pounds I was utterly un
able to rao'-e and so was lifted at
shoulders and feet by four men, who
literally threw me overboard.
"I found myself lying helpless upon
the water after my fall of perhaps four
feet, but soon began slowly to sink, to
my surprise and consternation, how
ever, backward and head foremost; the
air having been pumped in such a way
as to make me top-heavy.

pleasant, I pulled the signal line and
was drawn on board, when the suit was
properly inflated and I was this time
lowered feet downward, in which man
ner I gradually descended to the hard,
sandy ocean bottom sixty feet below.
The pressure of the water was so great
that I experienced no difficulty when
walking about in my heavy suit upon
what appeared like a firm, newly
washed beach with here and there a
tiny marine animal or shell.
"Twice I walked the length of the
ship, but seeing nothing of great inter
est and having accomplished my pur
of going down. I again pulled the
signal rope and was drawn on board,
after being under water eight minutes.
The sensations of that submarine trip
were in no way unpleasant, and I expe
rienced no fear, only a slight nervous
ness because of the unprotected condi
tion of my hands, which I fancied
might be seized by some wandering
creature of the deep.
'"An experience almost as interesting
as this was going to the masthead of a
steamer.
"We were off the coast of Africa, and
I was told that one of the company's
ships would pass at 10 that evening, so
I asked permission to go up with the
captain and salute her; a feat which I
knew was not impossible for me, as I
have a steady head, and the suit which
I wear when traveling does not impede
my movements.
"Oh, no, I don't wear bloomers. Just
divided skirts so full as to pass for
an ordinary plain skirt, yet which gives
me perfect freedom of motion.
"< >f course the other passengers, the
women especially, were horrified and
declared that I would fall and be killed;
but I enjoyed the climb just the same,
and sat chatting with the good-natured
captain up on the yard between sky
and ocean for over an hour.

feats of daring as man is only a tradi

there I met Andrew Murry. a saintly
character, the author of that book upon
the higher Christian life. I visited
Olive Schreiner, then a bride of a few
months, and found her to be a woman
of a wonderful personality, but through
severe mental strain she has become
what we would term a little bundle of
nerves, tapping a foot and hand con
stantly while conversing.
"She showed me the tiny house on the
great karoo.where her ' Story of an Afri

the vast expanse of the dreary karoo
and the incessant sighing and sobbing
of the wind about the little house, from
whose windows she could see tigers
creeping upon the far away hills, was
the inspiration which created the work.
"Her husband, a most fascinating
man, put an end to a brilliant political
career by yielding to her wishes in as

He expressed great sympathy with our

greatest respect for his wonderful in

Oakland Ladies Have Started a School "Where Over Eighty Children Are Divided Into
Prepare Themselves for Good Housekeepers. The School Is Already Such a Success That Its
HAMMERED LEATHER CLOSS.
From a Photograph.
IN an unpretentious house between
the railroad tracks in West Oak
land has been started what it is
hoped will grow Into a great school
of domestic science.
Other sciences have been making
great strides during the last hundred
years, but this one, which lies at the
center and foundation of life, is in Its
infant stage, comparatively.
There are more divorces and boarding
s in the United States than in any
other country, and in no other country
in the world does domestic service
stand on so low a plane. We have got
away from the old idea of "lady" and
r to be a woman. I like better
the old English derivation "lady bread
," and the picture it calls up of the
lady of the manor giving bread to the
nursing the sick, caring for the
aged and teaching the young on her
husband's estate-
It is the Duchess of Northumberland,
I believe, who to hold her title must
( arve in the servant's hall at least twice
a year. This knowledge uf all gentler
arts was the distinction between the
"laay" and the parvenu.
Now we are emancipated and pre
sumably enjoy a lot of other things, hut
still there are many women who realize
that woman's work is the highest, the
most refining, the most difficult of ail
the world's work.
Floren< c Nightingale opened the door
for trained nurses. Fon are acquainted
with thÂ« quiet, competent woman who
takes * hi- â  of sickness nowa
days, but remember the nurse who -
the best, that poor sick and worried
c Welsh Â«'i;rlyle could find. See
ing Mrs. Carlyle very weak and 111, the
nurse assured" her. "Oh, 1 can lay folks
out foin. when they're dead."
If training and the worlds approval
make such a change in the nurse's pro
fession iii a few years, what may not be
done in the simple necessary home ser
vice?
Four-fifths of American divorces are
for financial causes. When the woman is
no longer expected to know by son
vine intuition how to manage a house
ami family any more than the man is to
trust to Providence to support a family
after he g< ts one, many of these un
happy homes will disappear. The dis
contented mothers of children born
with all the taints of wretched environ
ment '\iii no longer be a disgrace to
American women.
A good many years ago Miss Louise
Emery made up her mind that she '
could not afford to wear away her life
over the books of her brother's mercan
tile house. The nprvonp strain was
wearing her out: she realizo'l that
women are not physically Jitted for
business life.
Going to Chicago she entered a train
ing school for home missionaries.
Much of her work was among the jails
and reformatory institutions. Study
ing carefuily the men and women and
the boys and girls there she became
convinced that more sin comes from
ignorance and want of something bet
ter to do than from depravity.
But how to help these women whose
best instincts were either degraded or
totally destroyed was the question that
that beset her. It was like putting
new patches on old garments or n"w
wine into old battles; it was heart
eickening.
Then came the World's Fair and Miss
Huntington, daughter of Bishop Hunt
ington of Now York, with her model
class in kitchen garden.
Miss Emery found there what she
had been looking forward to. She gave
up reformatory work and began the
formative. A prosperous school in St.
Paul with between two and three hun
dred pupils was the first result.
The school one well started required
her personal attendance no longer, so
she determined to come West. At Den
ver in the new Woman's Club building
a large portion of the building was de
voted to class rooms for kitchen gar
den.
In Salt Lake City Is another school.
In all these schools the instruction in
kitchen garden is given by the ladies
THE way to succeed in medicine
is, briefly, to look u on your pro
fession as the noblest in the
world, and to follow it as such,
with courage and enthusiasm.
But let us begin at the beginning.
Let us take the would-be medical stu
dent, standing on the threshold of his
career. The question you ask me is,
"How is this young man going to suc
ceed aa -. practitioner of the science of
medicine?"
In the first place, your typical young
man must consider whether or not he is
suited for the medical profession at all.
Does he experience a vocation, an abso
lute call toward the life of a jhysician?
Does he look upon medicine as some
thing far more than a mere money
making pursuit? Is he content to de
vote bis whole mind to the study of
medical science and its developments,
to study morning, noon and night, and
to continue unnceasingly to study until
death shall summon him to his reward?
Unless your young man can answer
these questions in the affirmative he
had better give up all thoughts of be
coming a doctor and look out for some
more suitable walk in life.
Supposing, however, that a strong
natural inclination toward medicine ac
tuates him, and that he Is <â  pable of
gras;><ne the true scope of that grand
usually prominent in society, whom
Miss Emery, trained in her normal
class. They submitted to severe writ
ten examination and proved their fit
ness before being assigned to work in
the class rooms.
Mrs. Robert "Watt of Oakland had
been wanting to . find just such a
teacher and quickly got together a nor
mal and model class among her per
sonal friends when Miss Emery came
to San Francisco/ Miss Emery's
idea is to begin at the top of society
rather than at the bottom, for women
quite as much as men have the sheep
idea and will follow wherever the
leader goes.
In the normal class of the new school
in Oakland are Miss Watt, Miss Ella
Goodall, Miss Bailey, Miss Wllcox, Miss
Lohman and six other young ladies.
The small daughters of friends formed
the model class and in one instance at
least the lessons bore immediate and
abundant fruit.
A new maid has just come to Mrs. X
As she was about to give her directions
about the work the lady. was astonished
to hear her little daughter of 11 years
singing a lesson in bed-making and air
ing and deftly showing the woman who
had been doing such work for years
how to make the bed, tucking the
clothes in so neatly that the maid was
watching with attention. Next with,
the broom the child began to sweep,
pinging the directions!
A little later in the morning the little
girl went to her mother and said: "The
grocer brought a broom, but it was a
'nadultered' one so I. told him to take
it back and bring a good one."
The child had had only: two lessons'
and had been told that brooms should
be of a certain color all through, other
wise they were likely to be of inferior
broom and dyed.
Mrs. X decided to attend her daugh
ter's lessons and hoped to still maintain
her voice in her own establishment.
All little girls naturally play with
dolls and keep house and have tea par
ties. The development of this instinct
is the formation of the kitchen garden
system. It is quite distinct from the
kindergarten and stands in the same
relation to the real housework school
as the kindergarten does to the gram
mar school.
It is intended to prepare pupils first
for the humbler homes, then rs mis
tresses in larger homes and also to be a
training school for domestic manage
ment, just as the ; hospital training
school is a training school for nurses.
With such a woman as Mrs. Watt
behind it, and with the assistants She
has chosen this now Oakland school
will be no small feature of the develop
ment of education on the coast while
the servant problem is in the present
condition. Chinese and Japanese have
driven* out the ' servant girl" and in
sweat shops she is working ten to six
teen and eighteen hours a day for the
barest necessities.
The hospital training schools have
lists of applicants yards long, not be
cause nursing is easy work, but be
cause it is a profession which a gentle
woman may enter and not lose caste
and it is well paid.
She must, however, submit herself to
the severest training and discipline and
must pass all her examinations before
she receives her diploma. Consequent
ly, when she begins her work she knows
exactly what she is about and does it
thoroughly and welL She wears proper
clothing while -at her work and respects
herself and makes every one who comes
In contact with her look up to her.
Nursing is essentially, woman's work,
but how much more so Is the work of
making homes, her own first, if she
have one; but some one's else if she
have not. This, too, will be the open
ing most appropriate for the hardest
class of woman to find her levelâ the
woman who has been carefully brought
up In her own home never expecting to
have to earn her living. If it becomes
necessary she find. that she is not able
to take her place and compete with the
woman who" has been in business from
childhood. Her refinement, â  all her
ideas are a bar to her advancement.
She is not, accustomed to the wear and
tear of business life, or to the publicity
of It.
Naturally she would prefer to re

was a graduate of Vassar, cultured and
refined by travel and intercourse with
the best society.
Her husband died and at 26 she stood
alone with nothing but ideas.
She decided she would stick to what
she knew something about, "a lady
could dignify any position, etc."
The first woman she applied to, in
answer to an advertisement, told her
flatly, "Your application i.s very suspi
cious; something must be wrong."
At last she got a situation as nur
sery governess to two little girls.
"You will, of course, not mind a cap
and my second girl will be so much
company for you," said the lady of the
house.
Well, she compromised by taking a
position in a store and a good many of
her ideas wore turned topsy-turvy.
I have asked many ladies employ
ing Chinese at wages ranging from $"0
to $80 a month, whether they would
not prefer a trained woman on the
same footing as a trn'nod nurse. In
every case the answer has been that
such a woman would be eagerly ac

she would be no more in an inferior po

In the West OaÃland school there are
now about eighty children with ten
times as many eager to enter. In

make beds, set a table and do every
thing up to the cooking stage of educa

the clothes to soak, to care for stains,
how to rub and rinse and make starch.
Besides these material diroe tions, the
ethical part of washing, rather a new
idea, is given and the pupil is taught
to respect her work and herself, be
cause it is work that is worth doing
and she knows how to do It well and
will do it conscientiously.
Then in the lesson she learns the
story of cloth; how it grows In the
South and how beautiful the cotton
fiejtds are, and then, later, how the dar
kies help pick it and carry it in baskets
on their heads.
Then the story of the mills and shops

cleanliness as their small brains can
grasp.
There is a lesson in sweeping and a
great deal about dust. Ruskin is called
in constantly, and, strange to say, the
small pupils take in his ideas.
In the dining-room work each child
has her small table and everything to
set it, even to a tiny napkin and ring,
and she learns why everything is done
as it is, and how to wash dishes by
â¢washing her own small set in a little
dishpan.
A lesson in clay modeling goes with
the table lessen. It is keenly enjoyed
by the children, who never knew how
hard it was to make the dishes. After
the modeling lesson they have much
more respect for crockery and handle
it just that much more carefully.
In sewing the work is carefully and
most ingeniously graded, from the be
ginners who "run" on Java canvas
with bright yarns, and by following the
course of the threads of the oanvc.a
learn to make a straight seam and
small even stiches. The needle used Is
easy to thread and without a point to
prick the small fingers, and uses a
thimble. In the next grade she makes
the same stitches on samples which
Miss Emery bastes carefully, intending
by her example to teach them how im
portant is good bastinr. and when the
time comes they unconsciously follow.
In the third grade comes felllr.g and
baclcstitching, the samples without any
knots showing and all th? stitches per
fectly even.
The fourth gmde Is hemming, and
the pupil begins her own basting on a
piece of cotton representing a sheet
with its wide and narrow hem. After
this is finished she hems a napkin,
making the stitches invisible on the
right side by having them set exactly
with the threads of the cloth.
In the next grade cornea rufHinrr and
putting on a band, which must all be
done by the pupil without more than
verbal assistance from her teacher.
The work of every grade must be
done perfectly before the pupil is ad
vanced, and I wish you could see that
sewing class of children from six or
seven to 13 years. They work as if life
depended upon it. When Mrs. Watt went
to the piano and said. "Now girls, it's
time to put away that work," there
was a general "Oh," although they had
been sevvinff for an hour and a half.
While they were putting their work
awny Miss Emery said she would like
to say just a word.
"Now, girls, you know last week we
had only two teachers, and I asked you
to put "your work away just as care
fully as when your teachers were here.
Weil, I want to tell you how proud I
was of you when I wanted to show
your work. It had never been put
away quite so neatly before."
You may be sure that after those
words the work was put away in neat
er piles than ever before.
At first it took a good deal of pa
tience to get the children to under
stand why they were to make their
work so perfect, but at last they
caught the idea, and now they are
anxious to learn to do each stitch per
fectly and are willing to take the work
out over and over again. They are pre
paring for an exhibition soon to be held
in connection with settlement work' and
are most caper to have their work com
pare favorably with work from other
classes. . Â
When they have learned to make all
the stitches in plain sewing and can
set on a band, baste hems wide or nar
row and make button holes, they are
promoted to the Sewing Club, which
meets in its own room. The club has
a teacher who is competent to teach
them to measure themselves, cut, fit
baste and make every garment a girl
If you could see that class of girls,
nearly all under 14 years, at their cut
ting tables and sewing machines and
the garments they have made them
selves you would require no further
proof that the work is thoroughly prac
tical Very few of the same gnis
could more than thread a needle when
they began work about six months ago.

If your young man does not like the
prospect of lifelong labor, let him not
! hope to become a successful physician.
The first question Dr. Young Man
asks himself is very often this: "Shall
i I devote myself to general practice or
I start to win fame as a specialist?" By
all means be a general practitioner. Dr.
Young Man! You will never amount to
much as a specialist unless you do. Go
ing out of college Into a special branch
of medicine is like beginning to build
a pyramid at the apex. The doctor
of the future Is going to be an "'all
around" physician: and you can take
my word for it that the very best spe
cialists are those that are forced by cir
cumstances into their particular line of
work. No surgeon can succeed uniess_

made him a pair of trousers, pockets

cast-off garments.
A small tuition â 25 cents a month, I
believe â Is paid by the children, as Miss
Emery's intention is to teach them
first of all pelf-dependence. She be
lieves that whatever is given without
compensation tends to pauperize. By
the paying of this fee th- children
value much more their lessons and it
gives them a greater interest in the
work. Indeed, the children own tfia
entire establishment, .Mrs. Watt and
all, and are not learning to get some
thing for nothing. Miss Emery and all
the teachers are learning, too, just as
much as they teachâ lessons in reaJi
ties â for they are going to school to a,
class whose stern necessities cut off all
shams.
One of the teachers told me a les
son she had received in what it meant
to help one another. A family who
had been rather disagreeable to one of
the members of the Mothers' Club
moved away from the neighborhood.
The father was out of jvork and money.
One day a man came to lrmk for him
to give him a fairly good job. No one
knew his exact address, so this mem
ber of the Mothers' Club, who had all
the work she could possibly handle,
left her baby and two smaller children
at the Settlement House and walked
twelve blocks to find the man's fam
ily. The woman never thought* of the
man's gruff ness and disagreeableness;
but he needed the work, so she did all
she could to help him.
I scarcely know which was prouder
of the two, the small boy or his little
sister mother.
Surely it is worth while to give these
children, to whom life begins its bur
dens so early, a little of the play which,
children love, if it is only the play
which teaches them how to do the
work which do they must as best they
can.
Another child, a girl of 13 years, had
only the earth for a floor at home, and
no such thing as a scrubbing brush, but
she wanted to try scrubbing. Miss
Emery told her she would hire her to
do scrubbing if sh. j could it nicely. The
child had never had a brush in her
hands before she went to the school,
but she scrubbed out the big school
room and Miss Emery was perfectly
satisfied. No more can be said.
In the class rooms there are draw
ings of plumbing and traps and a good
lesson in sanitation and fresh air.
Dr. Adelaide Brown has given talks
on health, plain and practical, to the
children who live on the street, and
they are taught what their bodies are
and how to use them and care for
them.
There are mothers' meetings, too, so
that they shall keep in touch with the
cildren.
The Boys' Club meets in its own
room, which Is always open and fur
nished with books and games. The
boys are regularly organized and havo
duly elected officers. The "ward poll
tics" methods, which tbe boys were
wtll up in, made the election a very
protracted sitting, but the boys have
grasped the idea of honest games and
elections.
The outer door is kept barricaded
during club meetings, for there are
other boys outside. When there is
more room the club will be enlarged,
but now the little house is crowded till
it can hold no more.
Cooking is to be one of the principal
features with classes for those In
homes where economy is the main
point. Later there will be more ad
vanced classes, where all the difficult
courses will be taught and graded and
the graduates will receive diplomas.
In many colleges. Stanford included.
a course in domestic science and cook
ing is included. While the West Oak
land school can never interfere with
this study, it will always be carried
after a more practical fashion in the
Oakland institution.
Let us hope it will soon be considered
no more "infra dig" for a woman to
personally attend to the work of her
own home than it is for her husband to
work all day in a business house.

he has practiced as a general practi
tioner. Suppose a disease of the eye
depends, as is frequently the case, upon
another disease which has its seat In ,
the kidneys. When your oculist, who is
merely an oculist, is called in, how can,
he cure the disease without being faÂ»
miliar with kidney troubles ? Or, how,
can a surgeon operate on the stomach
thoroughly unless he is conversant with!
the general laws of the stomach? It
will be time enough for Dr. Young Man
to think of becoming a specialist when,
he has built up a good general practice.
Now, as to the . field of labor to be
chosen. Large cities are poor places to
start in, unless the young doctor has ;
sufficient funds to keep him going dur- ;
ing : the years of dreary waiting which
must be his. Go to a country town, or
small city, Dr. Young Manâ that iis my
honest advice. There you will have a
chance ' of getting noticed. Emergency
cases are possible ' there. In big cities
the hospital ambulance takes such
cases from you, while the huge army or.:
other practitioners prevent you from
coming to the front. .' A '"
The life of a doctor in a country town
is, to my mind, most enviable. He:
grows old with \ the old folk; he sees*

practice in a country town has its lim

THERE
WILL BE NO RAIN
THIS YEAR,
SAYS
THE OLD MAN
OF
THE MOUNTAIN
LENGTH OF ROOTS
OF OLD MAN BE
FORE A WET SEA
SON.
THIS Is bound
to be a dry
year. Scarce
ly any rain is
to fall during:
the next
twelvemonth. At
least, that is whac
the "old man of the
mountain" says,
and the Indians say
that he never fails
as a weather pro
phet.
, The old man of
'the mountain is a
species of sage
brush, so called on
account of the soft
gray top that forms
on it in the fall of
the year. In some
parts of the State it
is simply called
"old man" and In
others "maiden
hair sage." Its sci
entific name is Ar
temesia California.
For countless
moons many of the
Indian tribes of this
State have looked
upon this plant as
the greatest weath
er prophet that
ever existed. Will
the season be wet
or dry? Ask the
old man.
This Is easy to do,
but you must know
a little of his lan
guage before you
can tell what he
says. The old man
speaks with his
roots. When there
is to be plenty of
rain his roots are
short, and when
there is to be little
rain his roots are
long.
The old man
knows there will be
no water from
above, so he goes
below for it. How
does a senseless
plant know there 1*
to be no rain? By
the same unknown
force that causes
seed pods to be
thick before a lons
cold winter, while
they are thin when
the winter is to be
mild.
All over the hilt
sides of Marln
County can be
found specimens or
old man and Its
roots are longer
now than they
have ever been
known to be before.
At the beginning of
a rainy season the
roots of a plant 12
Inches high are
about 6 inches lon^.
This year the sanW
plant will be found
to have roots as
much as 18 inches
long.

WHIST
PLAY FOR THE PAYOT TROPHY.
It Will lnterr-st the whist p:ayera of the Pa
clfliT Coast Whist Association to learn that the
committee in charge of the Payot trophy has
formulated a plan of play between the North
Pacific Whist Association and the Pacific
Coast "Whist Association whereby a visiting
team stands some show of winning. In the
merry-go-round contests that take place at the
annual meetings the element of luck cannot
be eliminated. A visiting club from one as
sociation to the other, entering one of these
matches and getting knocked out, can imme
diately challenge and play Inside of twenty
four hours the winning team. Ex-President
George E. Bates of the San Francisco Whist
Club formulated the plan, and It was accepted
at a meeting recently held in Portland. Or.
The following letter will explain Itself:
P J. Tormey. President Pacific Coas{ Whist
Associationâ Dear Sir: I am directed by the
North Pacific Whist Association to notify you
that the proposition submit ced at the fifth con
vention of our whist association by It. B.
Calley of the Linda Vista Club of Oakland,
representing the Pacific f'oast Whist Associa
tion, relative to the Payot trophy has been
Indorsed and approved. Respectfully yours,
GEORGE LEWIS GOWER,
Secretary North Pacific Whist Association.
SUGGESTIONS OF MILTON C. WORK.
Q. â What can you suggest, Mr. Work, to
keep up the Interest in our whist clubs In San
Francisco?
A.â From what I have seen of your whist
Clubs. I should think that it required very lit
tle effort to keep up the Interest in the game
here, as it seems to me that it la most popu
lar and sustains itself. It has occurred to me,
however, in the very pleasant week that I
have spent among your whisters, and during
which I have gained some little idea of the
â whist conditions In thin city, that you would
find it a very excellent plan to Inaugurate a
pair tournament for the championship of
either the city or this section of the country,
as you might determine most wise. In this
tournament I would suggest that you make it
obligatory that each pair be composed of one
laily and one gentleman. The tournament
could, to my mind, be most satisfactorily man
aged under a system by which each pair would
meet each other in a match say of about eight
deals, these eight deals being played all around
the room and the winner and loser being deter
mined by the positions above and below the
average. Our experience is that when a large
number of tables play eight deals the average
thereby derived is apt to be very nearly ac
curate, and therefore such matches are fairly
satisfactory tests of skill. Of course a larger
number of deals would be more satisfactory
If it were possible to so arrange, but I am
suggesting eight for the reason that It permits
three matches to be played each evening. Such
a tournament is being conducted this season in
Philadelphia with the most satisfactory re
sults, and I believe that here the field for it is
even more promising than in my own city. I
am satisfied that the announcement of it some
length of time ahead, with the title of the
champion pair of either Pan Francisco or Cali
fornia as you might decide being awarded to
the winner, would produce an exceptional iy
large entry. * most interesting event and
would in the end be of incalculable benefit to
the game of whist In this section.

Beverlpy W. Smith is the captain, has won the
challenge trophy several times and Is one of
tlv> strongest teams i:. the country. To "Wlilst
Opinion" the captain gives the following de
scription of Its system:
The chief characteristic of this system is the
significance given to the opening lead, which
is designed to show the character of the lead
er's trump holding. Both high and low cards
are used for this purpose.
Strong trumps are announced by the lead of
king or jack, or by the lead of ace, followed by
the penultimate.
The ace followed by the ultimate card and
queen, regardless of follow, are used to de
clare weakness in trumps.
When the hand Is opened with a low card
the lowest of the suit Is led to deny trump
strength, while the lowest but one card Is in
tended to affirm it.
The semi-honors, nine and ten. when led, are
generally from the top of suit, and make no
affirmation regarding the number of trumps
In hand.
False-carding second or third hand Is ordi
narily meant to suggest weak trumps.
After taking a force, the lead of king or
Jack Intimates a willingness to accept another:
queen or ace indicates a disinclination to be
forced again. In the low cards, two, three
or four. Invite a second force, and any other
low card declines it.
The eight and nine are used as arbitrary calls
through an honor turned.
The echo is made with three trumps exactly.
The boot-discard Is used, except that when
the diseuraer's partner has had the original
lead and has opened his hand from trumps the
"rotary discard" is adopted.
FINESSING IN YOUR OWN SUIT.
Judpre George L. Bunn has favored the whist
players of California with several articles of
gTeat value, and this week one of his letters
on the subject of finessing In your own But
is worth preserving. On the subject of finesse
In partner's suit, a far more important and
difficult Bubject Is the question of finesse in
the player's own suit- North has ace, jack and
two small of a plain suit; he turns a card
which indicates that he has one more of the
suit; East and West play cards that convey
no information; shall North finesse or not?
We favor a very conservative rule on this
point, believing that many tricks are lost by
taking the finesse in situations similar to this;
If North Is strong enough in trumps so that. If
the finesse loses, he can see a good chance of
making the best aftprward by exhaust
ing the trumps, then the finesse Is justifiable;
so perhaps if North has tenaces in both the
other suits with moderate trump strength, but
ordinarily we consider it trick-winning to put
up the best card on the second round. The
question of finessing on the first round of your
own suit led by your partner from weakness.
or of passing a strengthening card led by him,
is still a different variety of finesse; of course
the player Is justified in refusing to play the
best card in these cases much more often, for
the danger of losing it Is much less. For in
stance, third hand may. from king, jack and
others, pass the ten or nine led by partner, or
play jack or a smaller card led; when holding
ace, Jack and others, he is bound to pass ten
led by partner, and holding ace. queen, ten
and others, he may pass the nine led or play
the ten on a smaller card. These are a few of
the many instances whore deep finesse on the
first round of tha player's own suit is Justifia
ble; of course, a good player will be largely
governed by the fall of the cards and his own
hand, and It Is Impossible to make rules that
will be of much assistance.
SOCIAL WHIST.
Mr. King â I understand you were at the
whist club last night. Have a good time?
Miss Queenâ Splendid! I had no idea that
whist was such a delightful game.
Mr. Kingâ How many games did you play?
Miss Queenâ Oh. we didn't play one whole
game. We got talking after the first hand had
been played, and so we didn't play any more.

_ ORROR or horrors! The crln-

.1 JJL we may, wo are powerless to
down the tyrant Fashion, who
has sent forth the decree that
the crinoline must be adopted again.
The rumor has been persistently circu
late! for two or three years at every
on that the crinoline was
revived, but so far no one has been
enough to enforce the edict. But
\ve have been gradually growing up to
gradually that the skirts decorated
with rows upon rows of flounces, giving
that full, hooplike appearance which is
â¢ irerunner of the obnoxious crlno
>me a matter of little inter
est to us, and we have accepted them
matter of course.
There is only one consolation in the
thought of this revival, and that is the
that all these old fashions restored
are so modified and modernized that when
they do finally come to us they appear
Ltural and so different from what
we expected that we wonder we ever
fought against them or even imagined
they were going to be so terrible.
To the most casual of observers it is
plain that women have a tendency Just
now to revert to the dreadful crinoline of
a past period. The first sign of this re
version came with the revival of tho rows
of flounces. Then came a billowy dis
tension of the skirt. At first this was
confined to the back. But now the woman
of fashion Boatsâ that is the only wordâ
upon a perfect cloud that suggests the
da) s of long- ago. When the balloon has
gone all around the llnal development will
nave been reached.
<Jf course, there is something to be said
In favor of the crinoline. Addlson â or
was it Steeleâ once pointed out the fact
that it was a protection, in that it kept
man at a distance. But that is an ethical
point, and the science of beauty knows
iio ethical reasons.
Fancy an up-to-date woman on a wheel
wearing a crinoline! Can any picture be
more absurd, ridiculous and grotesque
than a bicyclist wearing a hoopsklrt? Yet
even this may come to pass.
The man dressmaker rears the influence
of tho bachelor maid and the new
woman in his profession. It does not
mean so much prollt to him, this fad for
severity In the matter of gowns, which
has been rearing its head among us late
ly. What frou-frous, ruffles or compli
cated trimmings can be put on a plain,
clinging skirt? What outlet has all his
â  for designing exquisite creations
when the average woman insists upon
donning plain cloth skirts and tailor-made
bodi<
Therefore, in sheer desperation, the man
imaker has started in on a new cru-
Bade. He. is determined to make woman
look more womanly, and he has brought
forth the old-fashioned hoopskirts of our
rs and grandmothers. But the
women who wore these birdcages had
more space, more room to move around
in. The world was not in a continual
rush to crowd into twenty-four hours the
work of forty-eight. We had no cable
those days, no trolley tyrants, no
conductors who stood with their hands on
the bell rope ready to ring the moment
the woman's foot was on the lowest step.
This matter of hurry, hurry is all very
veil while the modern woman wears the
present style of dress; but imagine a
woman in a crinoline hurrying to catch
a trolley car, scrambling to get on board
the bell rings and at the same time
trying to manipulate the unwieldy hoop
t-kirt in which she is caged!
Funny papers twenty-five or thirty
years ago used to be filled with carica
tures of women trying to sit down while
wearing a hoopskirt. Yet to-day woman
says she is emancipated! For all that
;-!;â¢ is a willing slave to fashion, and wnen
forth from Paris that she
don a crinoline don it she does, just
ekly ar,d obediently as she did in
C old, when she owned to pos
g a "lord and master."
As the American women are said to
the world in intelligence and pro
3, it is to be hoped, now that a
chance is given them to assert themselves
and prove their superiority, they will rise
In a body and refuse to adopt a fashion
which is bound to make them look ridic
ulous.

Although every one has his feet

BANGLES FOR THE ANKLES,
THE LATEST AAD.
THERE Is a new fad abroad In the way of betrothal giftsâ new and novel,
and one whose origin It would be hard to trace, unless we go far back into
the customs of the Orient and there find its prototype. The proper way to
a l.^trothal compact now is to give a bangle, but not just an ordi
nary bangle to slip up and down the armâ not the old-lashioned, common
place bangle which is fastened with a pretty lock, the key to which is carried
he heartâ but a gold or silver bangle, just large enough to slip up and
down the ar.kle, fastened with a little lock.
This is the latest, the very latest and newest rad. The bangle may be of
gold or silver, just as the donor's ptfcket-book will allow, and the little lock
â which fastens it must be secured by a gold or silver key.
The origin of the fad can only be found In the East, where bracelets and
bangles are as common on the ankles as on the wrists. Every one who has
r< ad "Salammbo" remembers the delicate, dainty, golden circlets which clasped
her pretty ankles, only that Salammbo's were chained so that her feet could
only sU-p just so far and no further.
The bangle must be loose enough to allow the stocking to be taken off and
put on without removing the circlet It must be tight enough to be kept in
place above the shoe top, and many button the top button of a high shoe over
the bauble to keep it in place.
It may prove an Inconvenience with a low shoe, but what girl would not put
up with the slight discomfort of having her pretty bangle slip down so that it
shows a little, just to prove to another girl that she has a sweetheart and a
le. of which he carries the key? .
HERE IS THE LATEST: THE ANKLE BANGLE.
The origin of this fad probably comes from the far East and Oriental nations.

CALIFORNIA GIRLS WHO HAVE
MARRIED NAVAL OFFICERS.
CALIFORNIA, far away as she
seems to her sister States of the
East, is the center around which
the thoughts of many a naval
officer revolves, and in San Fran-
Cisco, perhaps more than any
other city in America, there lives a per
sonal interest in "the chances of war"
that is heartfelt and intense.
When the big guns of our ships are
booming in distant waters an answer
ing throb will echo in many an anxious
heart inside the Golden Gate, when
their angry heralds of destruction are
speeding to the enemy, tender if in
tangible messages will be shot toward
the West from brave officers and men,
for mind and might, though so actively
engaged, will harbor remembrances of
home and friends.
Nowhere is our navy more closely
associated than in San Francisco; the
tie of marriage, the lover's knot, the
bond of kinship and to the twining
tendrils of the club, all combine to
make the connection a close one be
tween San Francisco and the navy.
On the Maine, to start with the ship
that has started all the others and
given them their battle cry: "Remem
ber the Maine." were three officers well
known here, two of whom married San
Francisco girls. Lieutenant Carl Jun
gen married Miss Kate Woods, whose
exquisite voice has often been heard
at socials and charitable entertain
ments, and Paymaster Ray married
the pretty Mrs. Sadie Walton, who was
Mies Richards.
Dr. Heneberger, the surgeon of the
Maine, who so faithfully and indefati
gably worked for the injured after the
disaster, has many friends here to ap
preciate how nobly he could fill his po
sition. Dr. Heneberger is considered
one of the handsomest men in the navy.
Added to this his quiet, gentlemanly
manner and a suggestion of pathos in
his smile have endeared many to him
and caused many a girlish heart to
Ilutter.
On the Oregon, whose uncertain
path is surrounded wit"h predictions,
are several officers in whom San Fran
cisco feels a special interest and pride.
Lieutenant Commander James K.Cogs
well, the executive officer, has many
warm friends here. He is a brother-in
law of Mrs. Hatch, who was Mrs.
Hawes of t'. '- city. Through his connec
tion with the Hawes family Lieutenant
Commander Cogswell is well and wide
ly known.
Lieutenant Edward Eberle was mar
ried here several years ago and his wife
â a pretty sparkling brunette who was
Miss Tazie Harrison of San Francisco â
is living here with their little boy, who
is named after his father and who is so
patriotic that he tells every one, on the
principle of "love me love my dog,"
that his intelligent brown setter is "a
true American."
With the predilection of the sailor
for nicknames, Lieutenant Eberle has
been dubbed "Pistol," and the name
probably originated from his quick, de
cisive way of going straight to the
r.oint. Lieutenant Eberle conducted
his courtship on this plan and there
was no mistaking his One night
4n the wardroom it was noticed with
two sets of numbers. These numbers
begin at 1 and run up to 13, and then
they begin a train at 1 and run up to 13.
The first numbers from 1 to 5 are known
some surprise that each officer had a
champagne glass at his place. Specu
lation was rife as to the cause and no
body knew whose treat it was. But
when the wine was poured out Lieu
tenant Eberle rose, with glass in hand,
and said:
"Well, fellows, she didn't say no and
I think you can guess her name."
Mrs. Eberle's older sister is the wife
of Lieutenant John J. Kr.app, who is
bringing the Topeka home from Eng
land.
-Mr^. Knapp is a handsome woman, a
blonde with a fresh, flower-like face
and she has a charm of manner that
is in.stantly felt. Mr. Kaapp is a fa
vorite socially, as well as with his fel
low officers.
Another popular naval officer, who

San Francisco and a small daughter,
too young to read all the speculations
regarding the pride and boast of our

"Regy" is always looked to for a good
story and he seldom disappoints the ex
pectations of his friends. Althoueh a
widower and popularly suppose^ +o be
heart whole and fancy free, the lieuten

among the fair sex, for it is always safe
to say that when a man is liked by men
he is also appreciated by the women.

Woman's Home Companion,
LINEN GOLLARS GIVE PLACE
TO STOCKS
THE popular linen collar is threatened with extermination. It has been the
standby of the tailor-made girl so long that It has seemed to have obtained
the same footing in a woman's wardrobe that it held in a man's. It was
certainly natty and tidy looking, and Rave the "mannish finish" to a
woman's costume which is considered just the thing these days. But it had its
drawbacks, its Inconveniences, and its discomforts, arid woman's sense of vanity
was the final straw which broke the camel's back of Its popularity.
Where that stiff white band had out into her soft flesh appeared wrinkles
and ridges. Instead of the curved roundness which formerly made her throat
so beautiful there was a compression not unlike what would be found in one' 3
finger from the wearing of too tight a ring. A woman who has worn linen
collars for any length of time cannot wear a low-necked dress and present that
beautiful swanlike neck about which the poets have sung for centuries.
But a woman could not give up her fhirt waists, her collars and, above all,
her Ascots and four-in-hands just as she was learning to tie them, and so a new
device has been adopted. It is simply the substitution of a white pique stock for
the stiff, starched linen collar which has been discoloring and distorting woman'!
neck so long.
THE NEWEST STOCKS.
J-|ir\ts for the Business
Woman for Summer
Weather Wear.
AS IT promises to be an unusually
hot, dusty summer, with war and
hard times, the small economies
will be great necessities.
There are many new fabrics shown
this year in cotton and linen which, made
without lining or trimming, will be very
light and cool and not affected by the
dust.
The skirts should be cut gored with a
straight width Joined to a bias one, and
all the seams "tailor" stitched to wide
tape on the under side to prevent stretch
ing when laundered. The bottoms should
be faced with the same material instead
of hemmed. In making up cotton or
linen it should be soaked for ten minutea
in warm strong salt and water, which
will both shrink and set the color and
prevent the desire to tear one's hair when
the skirt or shirt waist iirst comes home
from the laundry.
The sailor hat, which promises to be
come more popular than ever before, can
be made less severe by using a facing of
satin as nearly as possible the shade of
the warm tints in the hair, or if preferred
the same shade as the eyes. Use very
heavy, glossy satin put on perfectly
smooth. If the brim of the hat is double,
as it is in most good sailors, rip the two
portions apart and slip the satin be
tween. In bands velvet is more becoming
than ribbon. By making a band carefully
and poining it under the bow with one
half-inch of elastic it can be slipped off
and on and different ones to match the
tie or waist adjusted as easily as the hat
itself.
Ties are so easy to make it is a sur
prise that any one with a slender purse
will pay 25 or up to 50 cents for one she
could make in ten minutes for half the
price.
For lining use the double faced cotton
flannel; it costs a shilling a yard and you
will require a yard and one-eighth. Lining
from an old tie is just as good. Use rib
bon, closely woven; stitch it up on tho
wrong side and turn it with a lead pencil,
and then slip the lining inside, using a
hairpin for a needle; press and llnish the
ends and you have a tie you can wash
all summer.
A neat way of making a stock to be
worn without the starched collar during
the warm weather is to baste footing on
to the middle of a ribbon about a yard
and a half long, so that it will form a
niching. Tie the ends in the usual four
in-hand knot or in a bow with llaring
ends. To keep these in place and not
have them wilt, take a very fine piece of
hat wire, double it and twist the rough
ends together so they will come under
the center of the bow knot, leaving the
ends pulled apart to hold the bow out at
the sides.
A new veil, or, rather, one of very old
style revived, is a yard and a half to two
yards long-, with a lace edge and deep
bordered ends. Crossed at the back of
the hat it is held in place by a fancy pin
and the ends brought under the chin and
tied in a bow, which must stand out at
right angles to the ends. To keep it
on the brim in front, sew it into a small
knot, and it will stay in place without the
pin, which is so out of place. As it is very
expensive, it requires care to keep it in
order.
To clean it. let it soak a few minutes in
a small quantity of gasoline. Change the
gasoline till it is perfectly clear. Shake
the veil out well and pin it on a pillow
and let it remain for ten or twelve hours,
as it must not be ironed. A quarter's
worth of gasoline bought any place but a
drugstore will clean a veil half a dozen
times.

THE old-fashioned bar pin is here
with us again. We have had so
many stickpins â round, oval and
fancy shapedâ from which to make
a selection for tho last few years that
the bar pin, so dear to. every woman's
heart, was relegated to a back seat, so
far as popularity went.
This style of pin is much more con
venient than the more graceful and
smaller brooch of fanciful design which
succeeded it and has held its own for so
long, but whether the revival of the bar
pin presages the revival of the low col
lar and fancy la.ced trimmed dress neck
is something which just at this stage
cannot be positively stated.
When the dresses were cut low and
round in the neck or had collar bands of
the dress material, and were disfigured
with rows of closely set buttons, the bar
pin was a necessity to keep the neck
properly and neatly closed. Then when
the fashion of collarsâ straight, stilt linen
collars â came in, with all the attendant
scarfs, cravats, bows and ties, the 'bar
pin was no longer a necessity, but a su
perfluity, and its successor, the now fa
miliar stick pin. came in for its share or
popularity.

CHRISTIAN SCIENTISTS WIN
A BATTLE IN THE EAST
THE battle between Christian
Scientists and certain physicians
in Massachusetts is thus set forth
by an Eastern paper: Last month
there was introduced into the
Massachusetts Legislature a bill which
while purporting to be protective legis
lationâthat is, legislation ostensibly for
the people, was in reality designed to
protect certain medical practitioners.
The proposed bill was entitled " An Act
to Regulate the Registration of Physi
cians and Surgeons," but the secretary
of the Board of Registration announced
through the press that it was especially
Intended to prevent '"Christian Scient
ists and other charlatans from practic
ing."
The section which was designed to ef
fect this purpose read as follows:
"Any person shall be regarded as practic
ing medicine within the meaning- of this
i.,li append to his name the let
ters M. D., or shall assume or advertise
thf title "i Dr., or physician, or any other
title which shall show or tend to show that
the person assuminK or advertising the
same is a practitioner of medicine or of
any of the branches of medicine; or who
shall investigate or diagnose any physical
or mental ailment or defect of any per
son, with a view of affording relief, as com
monly done by physicians or surgeons; or
who shall prescribe treatment for a per-
Bon for the purpose of curing any real or
suppo â¢ â¢"! disease, whether by the usf
of drugs or by the application of any other
agency or alleged method of cure; or to
operate as a surgeon tor the cure or re
lief of any wound, fracture or bodily in
jury or deformity, after having received
therefor, or with the intent of receiving
theretur, either directly or indirectly, any
bon.i.-. gift or compensation."
During the three sessions which were
held for the hearing of the bill, the hall
was crowded with interested listeners,
for many thoupitful people, who had no
special Interest in Christian Science
saw in it an attack upon the personal
liberty that is st> cherished by a free
dom-lovinir people, and able romnn
strances outside the delegates from the
Christian Science Church were volun
tarily made by prominent scholars, and
well-known citizens.
The Rev. R. Fay Mills thus protested:
"I am opposed t" any law that will af
iVc i masseurs, Christian scientists, etc.,
so l"nsr as tht=y advertise themselves as
such. I do n"t see how we are to make
any real progress in any direction if we
confine ourselves to those who have
passed only through a certain course.

overture by the orchestra Grand Master
"Workman Bahrs delivered a ten-minute

the best efforts in that line of the grand

Some things that have benefited the
human race to a great extent came
from people who did not belong to any
particular society. The progress that
will be made over present conditions in
the medical profession to-day will be
as great as the progress of to-day over
the magicians. The people of the fu
ture will laugh at us just as we laugh
at the ancients."
William Lloyd Garrison said: "I de
sire to enter an earnest protest against
the bill under discussion. It is a vio
lation of individual rights and in the
interest of special privileges. Ostensi
bly an act to protect the community
from malpractice, this is really meant
to secure the monopoly of treating dis
ease to those who bear the credentials
of a recognized school. It is the in
definite repetition of an attempt to
limit admission to the temple of heal
ing, since the first organized body of
practitioners secured legal possession
of it, far back in the dim twilight of
civilization. The most cherished and
important principles held by the medi
cal faculty to-day were once maligned
and had to win recognition against the
opposition of the established schools.
In my own memory the homeopaths
were proscribed and denounced as
charlatans, just as those who practice
mental healing now, but they con
quered. To narrow the service which
offers itself for the healing of humanity
by such devices as the one proposed Is
to retard the growth of true science.
"Our protest is not against education
or skill, but for liberty, without which
both must suffer. One has only to read
the candid opinions of eminent physi
cians to realize how purely experimen
tal is the science of medicine. The
death of a patient under irregular
treatment, although it may be demon
strated that the greatest intelligence
was used, is heralded abroad as some
thing scandalous, but if any regular
physician were to make public the
deaths coming to his knowledge from
misapprehension of the disease <>r mis
taken remedies, the public might well
be alarmed."
Professor William James of Harvard
University said: "Were medicine a
finished science, with all practitioners
in agreement about methods of treat
ment, a l>ill to make it penal to treat a
patient without having passed an ex
amination would be unobjectionable.

and there was a good attendance. The
meeting was addressed by R. W. McGar

others.
R. W. McGarvie, the supreme deputy
for California, has been actively at work
of late increasing the order. He recently
j mittee reported adversely to the bill,
declaring it inexpedient and unneces-
I sary.
The Boston papers commented favor
ably upon the action taken by the com
mittee.
The Boston Evening Transcript, re
ferring to it, said: "It would be a fa

upon a Legislature the duty of licens

In another issue the same paper said:
"The principal effect of the introduc
tion of this bill has been to arouse and
unite dissenters, from the established
church of medicine, and these dissent
ers, a mighty multitude, include many
persons of recognized intelligence and
ripe judgment."
The Boston Daily Globe put the case
in this fashion: "A notable victory
has been won by the friends of pro
gress and personal freedom. After
such strong demonstrations in favor
of individual rights as those made at
the recent hearings on the restriction
issue, certain belated brethren ought
to realize that the time for expecting
the State to aid and abet certain
schools of medicine, rejecting all oth
ers, has gone by forever."
To say that the members of the La
dies' Drill Corps are proficient in their
marching maneuvers is to put it mild
ly. They are perfect, and the precision
with which they go through the various
movements is enough to cause envy in
the hearts of some of our militiamen.
There is no movement too difficult for
the members of the drill corps. As
they have been practicing it is cus
tomary for the entire company to en
ter the drill room, at the command of
the drill master, in marching order.
Passing down the center of the room
they break into squads of four, form
battalions, march in open order and go
through ail the movements possible.
The drill is interesting from the mo
ment it starts until it is finished, and

FORESTERS OF AMERICA.
The election of John J. Cordy for the
second time as grand secretary has given
general satisfaction to the great major
ity of the members of the order in this
city. Mr. Cordy has heen a hard worker
in his position, and in his business with
the members of the order all who have
called upon him in his office have always
found him affable and obliging. His
friends say for him that his course in the
past year is a guarantee that his course
in the future will be as commendable.

COMPANIONS OF THE F. OF A.
The visit of Grand Chief Companion
Mrs. Emma Harrington of the Compan
ions of the Forest of America to Uni
versity Circle at Berkeley was a pleasant
one, and the members demonstrated their
ability to perform the work by initiating
a candidate.
Last Wednesday the grand chief paid
an official visit to Evening Star Circle in
San Rafael. This council will endeavor
to pick up, as some of the members an
nounced that they would do all in their
power to have at least seven members at
the next meeting.
Last Tuesday the executive council held
its last meeting as such, and suggested
a number of amendments to be submitted
to the Grand Circle.
An agreeable feature of the visit of the
grand chief companion and other officers
to Golden Era Circle "last Thursday night
was the willingness of the officers to be
instructed in the initiatory work. The
circle has ambitious officers, who want
to appear as well as do those of other
circles. During the evening there were a
number of addresses by the officers and
visitors.
Loyal Circle will be visited to-morrow
night by the grand officers. The president
of the convention of 189 S. Mrs. Lizzie At

COURT TRBADWELL, A. O. F.
Last Thursday Court Tread well. Ancient

la. with thirty members, by Deputy High
Chief Ranger Max Boehm, assisted by
Permanent Secretary John Falconer, and
other members of the order. This new

After the ceremony of installation the

out a toothsome banquet. The high sub
chiel ranger acted as toast master, and
after the black coffee had been brought
on, Dr. F. Schwarzscbild, traffic manager
of the Alameda and San Joaquin Rail
road, was called on for an address. The
doctor expressed himself well pleased to
note the progress of the town, and to be
able to see that within its limits a bene
ficiary organization with a membership
of thirty to start with, could be organ
ized with little trouble. He also paid
a high tribute to Mr. Treadwell, for
whom the court was named. There wort;
responses to toasts by others, and before
leaving the beautifully decorated hall F.
J. Horswill. Dr. Sehwarzsehikl. James
Treadwell and Walter J. Bartnet were
proposed for honorary membership in the
ccurt.
THE NATIONAL UNION.
California Council at its meeting last

after the transaction 'of ordinary routine
business there was, under the head of
good of the order, singing by the quartet,
tenor solo by E. Lotz, patriotic addresses
by Secretary Kins. W. A. S. Nicholson
and others. At the close of Secretary
King's address, Treasurer Tickner, a vet

cheers for Commodore Dewey, and they
were given with a will.
All the councils of the order are follow

of the members who volunteer for the
war.
THE CHOSEN FRIENDS.
Crystal and Sunset Councils have de
cided to keep up the assessments and
dues of any of its members who may be
engaged in the army of the United States
during the war with Spain.
Last Tuesday evening Grand Councilor
I "Beg pardon, senor," he said, with a
| courtly bow, as he bit the end off a
huge cigar after he had Kept step with
me for a dozen paces, "but may I
trouble you for a light?"
I saw the burning lamp of a cigar
stand not ten feet from us, and recog
nized his game at once. I've had a
vast experience with confidence men. I
held my half-burned cigar toward this
stranger, he accepted it with- anoth.-r
bow, lit his own cigar, then fumbled it
awkwardly and dropped my cigar.
"Diablo! How stupid of me. A
thousand pardons, senor. Accept one
of mine, do," he urged.
I took it, a cigar of good flavor and
ample proportions, pungent and strong
as the Mexican product commonly is,
j lighted it from his and smoked a puff or
| two with ostentatious satisfaction. The
| manner in which I met his advances
! assured him I was easy game. Hl3
eyes fairly sparkled.
"Ah, senor, you are fond of a good
Mexican cigar?"
"I prefer them to any other," said I
anxious to lead him on.
"Then allow me to do you a favor, my
j friend; I will show you where to' get
them at half price. A friend of mine is
steward on a steamer just in from the
Mexican ports and he always brings a
few boxes like the one you are smok
ing; gets them in without paying duty
you understandâ l know you will not
mention itâ that is why he can seli
them so cheap. You would like a box
or two?
"Yes," said I, "I wouldn't mind if
they don't come too high."
"Oh, a mere trifle, my friend, a mere
trifle," said he, "$3 50 for a box of 100
and they are worth $7 in the market
wholesale. Come this way."
"Ah, my friend is out," said he when
he received no reply to his knock, "but
it does not matter: I have a key and
can serve you as well." He opened the
door and led me into a stuffy but well
furnished apartment, his own bed
room without a doubt. A box of cigars,
fine ones as I could see at a glance, and
from which two or three had been
taken, stood open on the table.
"Examine them, senor," said he,
pushing the box toward me; "you are
a judge of such goods, I know. See the
color, the quality, the workmanship,
and inhale the exquisite fragrance
senor."
"Yes." said I, "they are fine. I'll take
a box."
"Only one, senor? Take two or three;
you will regret it if you do not."
"No, only one, my friend, and by thÂ«
way, we must be quick about it," said
I, glancing hastily at my watch. "I
ought to be up town by this time; I
have to meet a friend. '
"Ah! I am sorry, my dear friend: I
should be charmed to make your better
acquaintance," and opening a cup
board showing a row of boxes similar
to the one on the table he began to
wrap one in paper for me.
"Hold on," said I, "lend me your
opener a moment; I want half a dozen
to smoke to-day."
"Oh, now you offend me, senor; do
I not think of opening the box for that;
! help yourself from the table; a dozen;
a pocketful!"
"< >h. no. I couldn't think of it," said I,
stubbornly, "you are too kind," and
with my pocket knife I popped the lid
off the box. Phew! burnt cabbage
leaves! They were the poorest, cheap
est, vilest smelling things ever made in
Chinatown, worth not over $1 50 a box
and dear at that. But he grasped the
situation in a twinkling and proved
himself equal to it.
"Bah! horrible!" he gasped, smelling
one of the reeking rolls. "I am so glad
we discovered the mistake. These are
some cheap things my friend keeps to
give away to the porters and hackmen.
I should never have forgiven myself if
you had taken them. Here is the kind,"
whisking the box away and taking
down another, which he placed beside
the one on the table, that I might see
that the brand was the same.
"All right," said I, nervously con
sulting my watch. "Great Scott! I
haven't a moment to spare, but I must
have the cigars; here you are; I'll take
the opened box and save time." and
throwing the $3 50 on the table I
snatched up the box and bolted for tha
door.
"Stay, senor, stop!" he cried, thrust
ing the other box toward me, "I can
not rob you so; that box is half smoked;
take this box."
"Oh, bother the difference; I can't
wait," I shouted back, and scuttled
down the stairs followed by a volley of
rumbling Spanish oaths.
I never enjoyed a box of cigars more
and could not light one of them without
laughing again at the knave's discom
fiture. I have seen the fellow, at a dis
tance, many times since, and he must
do a thriving business.
Boehm and Grand Recorder Wallis paid
a visit to Garden City Council in San
Jose, and they were welcomed by forty

AND SECOND-CLASS AUDIENCES
OF SAN FRANCISCO.
In the good old days â not so very old,
either â when we were the friends and
patrons of the Frohmans, Hayman and
the other theatrical speculators who
now make a specialty of snubbing San
Francisco, the summer closing in New
York practically meant the opening of
the season here. To be punctual, it
was just about this time of year that
we made the acquaintance of the last
play of Pinero's, of Jones', of Wilde's,
of Grundy*s, of Augustin Daly Shakes
peare's, and talked and wrote about the
condition of the drama and its actors
with easy authority.
Summer means nothing now. There
is no season for it to end, none for it
to commence. It passes unnoticed In
the continuous performance of the piece
that does not matter by the actor who
does not act. Mr. Frawley closed his
season last year with Bret Harte's
"Sue," a play that was almost great.
Robert Mantell came last week with
"A Secret Warrant," a conventional
satin-covered romance, cleanly written,
entertaining, but in no sense import
ant, unless for the fact that its hero
ine introduced, RoselleKnott, an obscure
and unspoiled young actress, who may
do big things in the years to come.
Between the going of "Sue" and the
coming of "A Secret Warrant" we have
had an underplayed version of "Under
the Red Robe." The rest has been farce
and variety, until farce has become
anything but a laughing matter, and
variety wo\ild better be called by some
other name.
â¢ â¢ â¢
With the exception of the dramatic
critics, everybody in San Francisco who
takes a serious interest in the theater
and holds the drama in any analogy
with literature, seems to have given up
playgoing altogether. Cultivated per
sons have taken to reading books, to
slippers and the fireside, to one an
other â to anything but the theater.
There Is no atmosphere, no intellectual
excitement, no artistical anxiety in the
audience that attends an opening now
adays. The first night is a faded tra
dition. The Mondays come and with
them more or less change in the play
bills, but there are no first nighters
now except the managers and the crit
ics.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Of course the San Francisco theaters
would not keep open if there was not
some interest in farce and vaudeville,
but this interest does not bespeak the
representative class of San Francisco's
playgoers, and it cannot be of normal
profit to the managers while so many
theaters are given up to vaudeville and
farce.
For months and months every the
ater in the city has been playing for
the favor of one audience with one
quality of show. Xaturally, the cheaper
theaters have done the bigger business.
While the Baldwin and the Columbia
have been coquetting with the patrons
of the Orpheum and the Tivoli, their
own clienteles have been learning to stay
at home. At present interest in the
drama does not exist here, for the very
good reason that there is nothing for
it to exist on. You cannot measure it
by the amount of favor extended the
musical farcical pieces that have been
given in the Baldwin and the Colum-
bia during the past seasonâ unless, 'n
deed, you count the empty seats to the
credit of the town.
My faith in the town is large and as
buoyant as ever; it found justification
in the record-breaking crowds that at
tended the Bostonians and Melba. I
hoped that the success of the Melba
season might readvertise our suscep
tibility to first-class attractions at firsc
class prices. In commenting on what
I wrote on this subject, Mr. Fiske, the
editor of the Dramatic Mirror, pub
lishes the statistics of the Melba sea
son and writes:
This shows that San Franciscans hun
ger for good musical and dramatic fare,
of which they have had too little in the
past. It furnishes another rebuke to the
men who recently abandoned a monopoly

of San Francisco's amusements with the
assertion that the public of that city was
"jay" and unable to support anything
worth while. All the San Francisco pub
lic wants is amusements of the first class.
Well, we have had a long experience
with amusements of the second class,
until the active play-^oing public has
come to be represented only by audi
ences of the second class. Persons of
the first class seem determined to stay
at home until the theater recovers its
quality.
This means that the amount of mon
ey expended for amusements in San
Francisco, at present, ia about one-half
of what it would be under proper the
atrical conditions.
It also means that unless an improve
ment is effected soon, some of the man
agers must go to the wall.

BaldWirv
At the Baldwin Theater on Monday j
night San Francisco theater-goers will
have their first opportunity of witness- |
ing a genuine pantomime production j
of the order popular in France. Pan- j
tomlme has become popular in this I
country only during the past few years <
and through the efforts of Pilar Morin,
who will be the star at the Baldwin on
Monday in the production of Vance
Thompson's tragic work "In Old
Japan." Mile. Morin first brought
"L'Enfant Prodigue" across the water
to Daly's Theater four years ago and
its success was such as to warrant a
return engagement at Abbey's Thea
ter. "The Dresden Shepherdess," an
nounced as the second production for
the Baldwin engagement, was also a
success in New York, where it ran for
100 performances.
Accompanying Mile. Morin are the
members of her original company â
Mile. Severine, Edwin Starr Helknap
and Edmond Morin. The latter is one
of the youngest pantomimists on the
stage, being but 12 years old. He will
be seen as the young emperor in "In
Old Japan." The piece is a pure trag
edy, written to enable Pilar Morin to
show her genius in the graver moods.
It consists of two acts and three
scenes.

the law of the nation, is obliged to kill
herself on the death of her husband.
Not being courageous enough to com
ply with this terrible requirement, she
cajoles a dancing girl into assuming
her attire.
The dancing girl is only too flattered
to wear rich garments; but almost im
mediately she is shut in a room, un
der the belief that she is the Em
press, where it is expected that she will
kill herself. The girl is totally mysti
fied and refuses to suicide. She is
brought before the tribunal of justice
and put to the torture â but at this
juncture the real Empress, stricken
with remorse, bursts in upon the court
and revealing her identity kills herself
by hara-kiri, the ritual form of death,
which is a ripping open of the body
with a knife.
The role of the Empress is played by
Mile. Severine, a upil of Pilar Morin.
Special scenery, costumes and decora
tions are being prepared for the en
gagement. The music of "In Old Ja
pan" has been founded upon the Jap
anese national hymn by the celebrated
pianist, Aime Lachaume, who will con
duct the orchestra on Monday night.
The presentation of the pantomime
occupies about an hour and a quarter.
The rest of the evening will be devoted
to an orchestral concert directed by
Fritz Scheel. Saint-Saens' Henry XIII
ballet music and vvi^niawski's polon
aise in A major, played by the young
violinist Pietro Marino, are the notable
pieces for Monday night. Mrs. Flor

appeared at this theater in the recent
successful Trilby production. The role
of Ensign Baird wi.ll be played by Fred
erick Paulding, and the part of the
child who is such an important figure
in the development of the story, by
Little Mildred. The other members of
the cast are H. S. Duffield, William
Brewer, Bert Morrison, H. S. North
rup, George D. McQuarrie, Frank Clay
ton, Charjes Shad, Franklin Kent, Mar
ion Barney, Phosa McAllister, Effie
Bond, Anita Bridger and Pauline Bow
ers. The play of "The Ensign" is not
new to San Francisco, but the manage
ment of the California believe Jit to be
up to the minute of these war times.
New scenery painted for this produc
tion includes a view of Morro Castle,
Havana. Arrangements have been
made to introduce the current system
of naval signals in accordance with
naval rules, and A. R. Carrington, bet
ter known as "The Drummer Boy of
Shiloh," will present his patriotic, scen
ic allegory with a series of "flag pic
tures," between the acts of the play.
Golumbia.
Robert Mantell will begin the sec
ond week of his engagement at the Col
j umbia Theater to-morrow evening with
I "Monbars," a drama of the romantic
| realistic order, which has been given
i here before and with considerable sue-
I cess. The action is laid in France in
the year 1810, a period which affords
some opportunity in tho way of cos
tuming. Monbars, played by Mr.
Mantell. is a man of the people and
a hero, who saves the heroine from the
attack of a mad dog, is bitten on the.
arm, cauterizes the wound with a red
hut iron (in the presence of the audi
ence), is married by the heroine for
reasons of gratitude and finance, is
nearly poisoned by a false friend and
rises from a bed of pain to fight a duel
with brilliant success. This role is
one of Mantell's favorites and is cer
tainly not lacking in heroic opportun
ity.
Morosco's.
Morosco's will have another new star
attraction next week in Frank Linden,
a well-known Eastern actor, in his own
dramatization, "The Prisoner of Al

sequel to "Monte Cristo," introducing
in the prologue the count in his Paris -

. ian palace. Albert, however, becomes
the central figure as the play advances.
! His life mission is to avenge his father,
poisoned by Benedetto, an illegitimate
offspring of Villefort's liaison with
Mme. Danglars. After her husband's
downfall, Mme. Danglars has become
the keeper of a famous gambling es
tablishment in Paris.
A lapse of three years occurs, and the
scene opens outside the walls of Al
giers, at the French encampment, dur
ing a truce. Albert is a French cap
tain and Danglars his superior officer.
The sole object of the latter is to pro
voke a Quarrel with Albert and con
summate his ruin and death. He suc
ceeds in part, Albert being court-mar
tialed and cast into prison. But he is
rescued by Danglars" daughter, Eu
genia, and next appears at the gamb
ling palace of Mme. Danglars in Paris.
Benedetto, arch enemy to- Albert, and
assassin of the count, kills his own
mother and is arrested. Albert fights
an exciting duel with Danglars at
Fontainebleau and kills him. The
French Government turns Benedetto
over to Albert, who sends him to the
Isle of Monte Cristo, and there, in a
sword contest, Benedetto is killed and
Monte Cristo is avenged.
In spite of these tragic events, it is
pledged that the Irish corporal and
other characters furnish a liberal
amount of comedy relief.
George M. Hayes, another Eastern
actor, who has been associated with
Lindon, makes his first appearance as
Danglars. Maud Edna Hall, after a
short vacation, reappears, as does also
Queen Purssell. Fred Butler, Landers
Stevens and all the Morosco favorites
are in the cast.
During every performance of "The
Prisoner of Algiers" J. J. Jeffries, the
pugilist, will box several rounds with
Jack Stelzner.
Alcazar.
Following Immediately upon the two
weeks' success of "The Gay Parisians"
"Niobe" win be revived at the Alcazar.
In "Ermine" and other plays the Paul
ton brothers have done some very
clever work, and "Niobe," their first
effort, has not yet outlived its comic
usefulness. The Alcazar management
brings from the Los Angeles company
Wright Huntington and Florida Kings
ley to re-enforce L. R. Stockwell and
the remainder of the company.

that of a 2000-year-old statue of Niobe,
found in the ruins of Thebes, valued at
$7000, and brought to life in New York
by the accidental aid of an electric light
current.
The sudden appearance of a well
developed woman scantily attired in the
presence of the family of a muchly
married man creates no end of sensa
tion. No one believes that the Parian
marble could be vitalized. Dunn, the
possessor, is frowned upon by his en
tire household and poor Niobe is the
innocent cause of a public scandal.

bill for this week include Isabelle Urqu
hart, supported by Wilmer and Vin
cent, in a one-act comedy entitled "In
Durance Vile." Miss Urcubart is one
of the many people who recently have
deserted the legitimate stage for vaude
ville.
The straight vaudeville acts include
Gruet, Beers and Gruet, said to be ex
ceedingly clever acrobatic comedians,
in a new line of work, and George H.
Fielding, who is certainly the most
original if not the very best of comic
jugglers.
Mile. Catherine Bartho, the premier
danseuse, returns for one week and will
appear in international character
dances. New subjects in Kerner's Vis

John W. Ransone, Hayes and Bandy
and Bogert and O'Brien complete a
strong bill.
TiVoli.
"Ship Ahoy," one of the Tivoli's sue-

formerly played by Ferris Hartman.
The cast includes many of the origi

sun will be seen as Commodore Colum
bus Cook, commander of the United
States steamship Cuckoo; John J. Raf

Havana and other Cuban and war
scenes. Among the new views to be

Kneisel Quartet.
The famous Kneisels will give their
first chamber concert In San Francisco
on Monday evening. May 16, at the
Sherman & Clay Hall. The other two
concerts of the short season will take
place on the following Wednesday
evening and Saturday afternoon. The
programme for the opening concert in
cludes Haydn's quartet in D major,
Beethoven's in C major, and Dvorak's
in F major.
A New York paper traces significance
in the facts that Mrs. Richard Mans
field has retired temporarily from her
husband's company and that Mr. Mans
field is learning to sing lullabies. Mr.
Mansfield, however, attended to it that
nothing interfered with his opening
the Garrick Theater last Monday
night with a production of â¢"The
First Violin." Marie Stone and
Percival Pollard have worked together
in this dramatization of Jessie Fother
gill's novel and Mr. Mansfield is
pleased with the result. The character
of Eugene Courvoisier, which is
played naturally by Mr. Mansfield, has
large possibilites for an actor capable
of appreciating the musical atmos
phere which makes the charm of the
story and it is remembered that Mr.
Mansfield is an amateur musician of
much accomplishment and the son of a
famous professional. The New York
critics vote the play weak, but the
principal part one of Mansfield's most
positive successes.
Miss Viola Allen of the Empire stock
company, who resigned from Charles
Frohman's forces at the end of the
season, has signed a five years'
contract by which she will star under
the management of the Liebler com
pany. The remarkable success which
Mr. Charles Coghlan has scored under
its management has induced the Lieb
ler company to go into the theatrical
business more extensively, and Mls3
Allen is the first of several stars to ac
cept its terms. Miss Allen will sail for
Europe early next month for a long
rest, and her tour will open in Septem
ber, probably with a production of "Tha
Courtship of Miles Standish," a drama
tization of Longfellow's work by Stan-Â»
lÃlaus Stange.
Miss Beth Franklyn, a San Francisco
girl who played "The Duchess" with the
Chimmie Fadden company here (and
elsewhere) has made a success in in~
genue parts this season, and will re
join the Baltimore Lyceum Company*
for the season to come.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. May 7.â Stock brokers had a
busy two-hours during the short session of the
exchange to-day and there were no intervals
of Idleness. ' The market was active through
out and the keenness for the stocks gathered
force as the session progressed until it had be
come very like a scramble toward the close.
Occasional offerings by operators content to
take their very substantial profits were swal
lowed up with almost no effect in prices. The
element of apprehension which had caused the
reaction at the close yesterday cleared up.
The release of the Lafayette eliminated thi,
fear of a complication with France over her
seizure. The reported announcement of the ar
rival of the McCulloch at Hongkong with dis
patches from Admiral Dewey relieved the na
tural uneasiness that was beginning to be felt
over the prolonged delay in receiving official
advices from him. There was some hesitancy
In the trading until an official confirmation
had been received from Washington of the
good news from Manila. The completeness of
the victory and the almost entire exemption |
from damage of the United States forces em
phasized the new important bearing of the
event upon the prospects for a speedy termina
tion of the war.
The depression of some American securities
in London before the opening here was ig
nored and the advance in prices was inaugu
rated from the opening. The strong Intimations
coming from official circles in Washington
that important news is expected from Admiral
Sampson by Sunday and reports that the Span
ish fleet has been sighted off the French West
Indies, aroused an expectation that the first
step toward the destruction of Spain's naval
force In the Atlantic was near at hand and
could safely be discounted in the" market. The
continued excitement and advancing prices in
wheat gave added strength to the stocks of
railroads running through the wheat belt. The
bank statement was also interpreted as dis
tinctively favorable. The force of the upward
tendency of prices was remarkable in the sec
ond hour and the day's net gains ranged be
tween 1 and 3 points for most of the leading
stocks. . ,
The animation and strength of the stock mar
ket during the week has been in strong contrast
to the lethargy of the early part of last week.
Professional operators laid in a large supply
of leading speculative stocks on Friday and
Saturday of last week, in anticipation of good
news from Commodore Dewey in the early part
of this week. It is not unusual to see prices
of stocks react upon the actual occurrence of
an event which has thus been discounted, sell
ing to realize profits. But the professional
operators who took their profits on Monday and
Tuesday on the news of Dewey's victory fail
ed entirely to estimate the force and far
reaching results of that event. Their heavy
realizing sale* were easily absorbed by the
large outside demand for stocks and instead of
reaction following the upward rush of prices
the week has closed with the furor to buy at
boiling point and with prices at the top level
of the week, â¢ with from 20 to 11 points net
gain in the active railroad stocks. Some of the
specialties exceed even that. ;. .
The week's development in the money market
shows that the long process of preparation to
meet the country's war needs has been com
pleted. It is also significant that the gold
which continues to come from abroad no
longer goes to the liquidation of loans, indicat
ing that the Imports of gold are made on cur
rent accumulation* of exchange. Business In
other fields feel the benefit of the easy monty
conditions. The confidence that the progress
toward prosperity is about to be resumed Is the
real ground of the buoyancy In the " stock
market.

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. May 7â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here were idle and dull to-day. The
only feature was the payment of the Chinese
Indemnity to Japan of Â£12,000,000. Â£1.000.000 in
Berlin and Â£11.000.000 at the Bank of England,
this being the largest check ever drawn. The
money market was less affected than had bfen
expected. Americans were lifeless. Spanish 4s
were flat, although exchange was steadier.
New York bought about Â£200.000 In gold
which arrived to-day from the Cape at 77s 9%id.

AN INCREASE IN LOANS.
NEW YORK. May 7.â The Financier says:
For the first time since the destruction of the
battleship Maine the loans of the New York
clearing house banks show an Increase. It be
came evident as the week, progressed that deal
ings in mercantile paper were on a more liberal
scale, but the increase in the loan item prob
ably represents for the most part borrowings
incident to the revival on the Stock Exchange.
While the increase was less than $1,000,000, it
must be interpreted as a favorable sign. At
this time, when the turning point seems to
have been reached, it is interesting to note
that the falling off in the loans in New York
banks since February 19 last have been no less
than 175,900,000. A considerable part of this
sum, however, represents the liquidation of
accumulated sterling bills Incident to the heavy
gold imports. __

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, May 7.â May Wheat advanced to
Jl 70 per bushel on the Board of Trade to
day. It closed at Jl 67, a net advance for the
week of exactly 50c per bushel. Joseph Leiter
has apparently proven himself complete master
of the situation, with entire control of the
available Wheat supply and shorts at his
mercy.
Another surprising advance at Liverpool to
day started the Wheat market here strong and
drove from the minds of local scalpers for the
time being all thought of the big reaction they
were calculating upon with great confidence
the day before. July, which closed yesterday
at Jl 01, opened with buyers at from Jl 02Vi@
1 03, and in the course of forty minutes It sold
up to Jl 04% without material setback. Sep
tember in the same time rose from around 84% c
and 65c, where it hung during the first twenty
minutes to 85% c, its closing price yesterday
having been 83% c. May started only %c
higher, or at Jl 50. The next short to come In,
however, did it at Jl 55. The advance in May
Wheat at Liverpool was equal to 3%c a bushel,
and In July sc. The quotations percental at
Liverpool showed the price of May Wheat to
be bringing the equivalent of Jl 54% July
I Jl 48%, September Jl 14% and December Jl 03%
Frantic efforts to buy the golden cereal began
again after a brief rest at Jl oc, for July and
Jl 55 for May. The market got at last where
bearish reports no longer influenced it. It be
came a mere matter of disappearing margins
with shorts and aggressive confidence with
longs. July rushed up from around Jl 05 to
Jl 06. dropped In two minutes back to Jl 05%
and five minutes after It was bringing Jl 06%
In the last fifteen minutes of the session it
surged up and down in great swelling billows
of excited trading between Jl 06 and Jl 06Â»i
the closing bell tap cutting it short when Jl 06%
was the current price. May, after reaching
Jl 70, closed at JJ 67. an advance of 17% c for
the day. The net gain in July was n%c; Sep
tember rose to 87% c and closed at 87% c, or 3%c

HAY AND FEEDSTUFFS.
The Hay market was very soft and dull, ow
ing to the continued flood from outside source*,
but th^re was no decline. This outside Hay
Is coming- from all sorts of sources up north,
but as the freight Is $5 per ton from Portland
It Is not likely to beat prices down very far.
Some of It from points east of Portland stands
the shippers In $11 freight, and of course they
lose on such shipments. Besides, almost all
of this outside Hay is stained and otherwise
In poor condition, and dealers do not dread it
much in competition with our choice clean
California product. Still. It has its effect.
Buyers in Sonoma and Napa counties have
Instructions to pay $17Â®18 for any kind of new
Hay. and will take thousands of tone at these
figures, but the farmers will not let go so far.

CUBBY'S
REVENGE
BY MRS. W. F. PERRY,
east Oakland.
PAPA had met with great re
verses, then his health failed. He
collected together what little he
hud left and with mamma and
myself went to a far-away city
on the Pacific Coast in hopes to re
gain both health and fortune.
It was a hard struggle for awhile,
but papa had a brave heart and told
mamma "not to fear, for he was worth
a d'-zen dead men yet." So, although
we lived in the tiniest cottage, with no
carpets on the lloor, and mamma lent a
helping hand to earn our bread, we
were not discouraged.
I made many little acquaintances on
our street and one, Kitty Henderson,
became 'my dearest friend.
"Juliet Beetle's mamma," Kitty said,
"was the biggest bug in all the neigh
borhood. She had a suite of rooms
above the grocery store and carpets
and lace curtains and a piano." In
deed, she felt the importance of it all
and so dl 1 Juliet. '
X"xt to Mrs. Beetle Kitty's mamma
dressed better than any one else upon
our street. Juliet and Hitty were great
friends.
Mrs. Beetle and Mrs. Henderson were
very patronizing toward mamma, which
made her almost 1 ugh end cry together
â the thought of such a little handful
of stuff that one could buy making a
difference in one's standing.
I felt it keenly though and tried to
hen] my nride by lelling Kitty of the
fax grander things that we had once
possessed.
Kitty told the rest of the girls and.
although it gave me some importance,
yet as Juliet Beetle said, "Seeing was
believing."
Juliet Beetle's mamma gave her a
birthday party. While the plans were
going on the girls whisper< together
slyly and looked at me as though the
chief pleasure of it lay ' my not being
allowed to enjoy it with them.
What a great thin.- it did seem to me
to live over a grocery store, to have
carpets and lace curtains and all the
girls looking up to one.
Finally, one day, Kitty came rushing
In. "Marguerite! Marguerite!" she
cried. "You are going to the party."
I gasped for brc th. "Oh, did Juliet's
mamma say I was?"
"No." said Kitty, "not exactly, but
she told me I could bring some friend,
and I'm going to take you."
I danced with joy. Mamma looked a
little dubious, but Kitty and I overruled
her objections and she consented to let
me go.
ma TÂ«.:,k one of my white frocks,
which I had worn in better days, and
tried to make it look presentable. It
was too short and small, but she
pieced it out ai ed up the places
With pome old lace. Then she tied
a pretty scarf about my waist, and
Kitty declared it looked '"just beauti
ful."
I kissed mamma, and hurried gaily
off; half worried though, by the tears
that gathered in her eyes.
Kitty, as Fhe explained to me, was
'â¢going to 1 ne of the chief mueke
mucks of .sinn." and so had
gone earlier than T.
I rang the bell and Juliet, arrayod
In her pretty dress, came to the door.
Sh-' looked me over with apparent ap
probation, then asked nu- to "wait
while she ran up and told mamma." I
heard pome of the pirls tittering at the
head of the stairs, and when Juli--; re
turned she had assumed a haughty lit
tle air, and said: "Mamma will not

let you come to my party. Your mother
â she does sewin~ you know."
I was so distressed and ashamed I
could not stir until Kitty came flying
down the stairs. She put her arm
around my neck and whispered: "I
think Juliet's ma is just as mean as
.she can be. I've a notion not to stay
myself, only we are having such a
good time, and the supper, oh, my, you
should see the nice things we are go
â  have. Toil won't be mad at me
if I stay, will you?"
I could not answer, but ran home to
mamma, trying as though my heart
would break, and mamma she cried
with me.
Well, during the next two years papa
made several lucky mining deals, and
our pecuniary troubles were ended. We
moved into a fine house on a better
street, and the girls â well, Juliet was
nowhere.
My birthday was at hand and papa
Bald I should have, and do, what I
liked on that day. I consulted with
Kitty r.hout a fine party, with lots of
ice-cream, cakes and candy, but she
"MY MAMMA WILL NOT LET YOU COME â¢ TO MY PARTY."
said: "Oh, pshaw! That's is old. Juliet
i''--ile had that. Just let me plan.
Have your papa and mamma go with
us. Spend the forenoon upon the
beach: go to a nice hotel and have
evt-ry thing we want for lunch; visit the
park in the afternoon; eat a nice din
ner, and wind " -- ith the theater in
tli.- evening. What do you think of
that for a programme?"
It pleased me very much and then,
when papa and ti.nmma had approved,
hdw we girls < l i r 7 enjoy talking 1 about
itâ all but Juliet Beetle; she was left
out, until one day, when I found her
crying over it, then I recalled my own
unha-iiness when I was excluded from
the pleasant conferences over her
party, and from the party, too.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 8, 1898.
I ran home. "Mamma," I cried,
"would you like to make your daugh
ter very happy?"
"Can you doubt it, little girl?" she
sajd;
"Well, then, let us invite Juliet Bee
tle to enjoy my birthday with us."
Papa looked a little savage when
we first suggested it to him, but after a
while he seemed pleased and said:
"Well, Cubby, have it all your own
way."
HONORING THE FLAG.
BY OLIVE RIFFLE,
SAN FRANCISCO.
THERE are many ways of honoring
the flag, and if you canr.ot honor it
in all ways you can at least do
so in one, and that is to salute it,
cither by hand or lifting your hat
While passing by or when a national
hymn is sung. Another way is to pray
for it, and for the ships which sail, and
the men who fight under the stars and
stripes.
Why were the brave boys who left
Sa.n Francisco recently going to fight.
Was it not for the honor of America's
flag? Why was it that so many, eyes
were dim as the soldiers marched by,
was it not because so many would die,
dcing- their duty fur. the flag?
And as the colors In our flag are in
the sky above, and as the sky protects
tiie whole earth, so shall the American
flag protect "The land of the free and
the home of the brave."
Will not all the judges see to it that
their opinions are sent in as soon as
possible? To-day the children are un
able to say where victory perches,
whether upon the banner of the girls
or the boys. They are anxious to get
the verdict.
WIZARD'S
CAVERN
BY SUSIE WHEELER,
NEWVILLE, CAL.
SUE and John were visiting their
grandfatehr's last summer. Their
home was in the great city of
New York. Their father was a
rich merchant. Sue was 7
years old and John was 10 years
old. One day their father came home
and told them that they could go to see
their grandfather in the summer. They
were wild with excitement and could
hardly wait for summer. At last the
time came. Their mother had all their
clothes and toys packed two or three
days before. The next morning they
were put upon the truin with a servant
to take care of them. Every time they
passed a farm they asked their servant
if it was grandpa's piace. ,Â»
At night they took a stage to grand
pa's. Both of the children were asleep.
As they came near the house, Fido, a
large dog, commenced to bark. The
door was opened and grandpa came out.
He took the two children In his arms
and kissed them. Then he carried them
in the house and put them in bed.
In the morning Sue woke up John.
Just as the" dressed the servant came
in and said breakfast was ready. After
breakfast was over the children went
out to play. They picked flowers till
noon. In the afternoon they went to a
mountain. They climbed to the top,
after resting 1 two or three times. They
w*ere going home when they heard
something singing. They stopped and
listened. It seemed as if it came from
under their feet. They hurried to the
house as quick as they could.
By the time they reached the house it
was dark. They told their grand
father about the music they heard. He
smiled, and told them that he would
tell them a story after supper was over.
They all gathered around the fireplace.
"Well, once upon a time," began
grandpa, "a young man went hunting
upon this mountain, and when he was
about half way up the mountain he saw
a large buck runnl.ig. He shot, but he
misfied it. So he went after it. After
going about 100 yards he came to a
sin;! 11 opening, where he saw the buck
going into a cave.
"The youth was not going to be fooled
that easy after coming so far, so he fol
lowed the deer into the cave. When he
had gone abou' fifty steps he came into
a large room all lighted up, and off in
one corner he saw thÂ» same buck he
had shot at a while back.
"It was playing on a harpsichord. As
soon as he saw the youth he sent a
servant to invite him in. The youth
started to run out of the rave, but the
buck played a tn-e that drew back the
youth. The servant motioned for him to
sit down. As poon as he sat ou the seat
he fell into a deep sleep. AnJ now when
people hear the music they say that
another person is being put to sleep."
TOM AND TERESA.
BY ALICE JOHNSON,
HAYWARDS.
TOM and Teresa were little or
phans. Their father died when
Tom was a baby, and their mother
had been dead a year. They lived
in a small house with only one
room, in it..
Teresa was eleven years old and
Tommy was only seven. As they lived
in the country Teresa could earn, as
small as she was, enough to feed and
clothe herself and Tommy by picking
fruit.
Every morning In summer you might
see two happy little children goirig to
Farmer Blair's big orchard with their
lunch pail. Tommy enjoyed himself
very much indeed as he went along.
He chased butterflies, picked flowers
and laughed and sang, while Teresa
walked behind more slowly.
She felt very happy to think that she
could work to keep her little brother
healthy and happy.
But something very sad happened.
The next winter there was very little
rain and very heavy frosts that killed
"WHEN HE WAS ABOUT HALF WAY HE HEARD A LARGE BUCK."
all the blossoms on the fruit trees. So
the next fruit season there was hardly
any fruit at all, and Teresa couldn't
earn much money for food or clothing.
She did the best she could, but it
seemed as if they would have to beg.
Teresa felt very badly- at the thought
of this, but begging they went.
You might see, by a large stone fence,
Teresa with her little hand held out
asking for pennies, and Tommy by her
with a basket on one arm and crying
and wiping his eyes on his sister's
dress with the other.
One morning as they were standing
tl ere Farmer Blair passed along and
was very much surprised. He asked
them how long they had been standing
that way, and Teresa told him, and he
took a child under each arm and car
ried them home to his wife saying,
"We have no children, so we might as
well have these."
His wife was very much pleased,
and so were Teresa and Tommy, for
they knew they had a good home.
A POPPY HUNT.
BY WALDRON W. ANDERSON.
Go to bed, my sleepy head.
Dream until the morning;
Slumber on till night is gone.
Till the day is dawning.
Waken then like other men.
Fresh as any rover
Bold and free, to follow me
Through the fields of clover.
Far away we'll roam to-day;
Every breeze that passes
Blows." I know, where poppies grow,
High among the grasses.
Bright and bold as yellow gold,
Soft as sunlight glancing,
Fresh and fair like sunbeams there
In the meadows dancing.
Rest we here till night is near,
Poppy breezes blowing,
Then away with poppies gay
Slowly homeward going.
CANDID
OPINIONS
WHEN our boys or girls really
exert themselves they are
to be taken seriously,
whether their energies take
the direction of story writ-
ing, basket-ball, football or
the gathering of knowledge. The judges
who were invited to decide which of the
specimen pages of The Call, one con
sisting of stories produced by the boys
and another page written by the girls,
was the better, all being connected
with educational work, have more than
others seen the necessity of care in
reaching judgment. As a consequence,
for this is the explanation furnished,
there are judges who are still deliberat
ing.
Below are submitted the opinions
so far as received. They may indicate
whether the victory lies with the boys
or with the girls. There were fifteen
judges. A majority must rule. Hence,
the winners need only eight votes, and
it is easy for the boys and girls to
count a conclusion in the matter. Still
is not considered best to comment upon
upon the opinions until they are all in.
It will be conceded that the judges are
most competent; that they have been
perfectly fair; that they are entitled to
and will certainly receive the thanks of
all the boys and girls for the time and
attention they have bestowed. Here are
the views of all the judges who have re
ported:
The girls' page
seems to me very
much better than
the boys'. It has
more variety, is
more elastic, more
SUPT. HYATT,
Riverside.
sympathetic in character.
The boys are only able to play upon one
string of the harp they have undertakenâ
the girls bring out a fuller harmony by
striking many strings.
The boys have nothing but fights
against some physical foe â wildcats,
wolves, bears, explosives, Spaniards â
even the 6-year-old had a dog-fight!
Guns, pistols and powder are absolute
necessities to the boys.
But see how much more enters into the
girls' page. Besides the fights there are
spirits, witches, hobgoblins, love, court
ship, marriage, dreams, discovery of gold,
supernatural fish, stolen children and a
dozen ' other things. Undoubtedly the
girls have more ways to play upon the
harp of our sensibilities than the boys
have. Their language is better, too â
richer, more comprehensive.
I think these pages show that the fe
male sex is superior to the male in pow
ers of expression â and that it has there
fore a literary superiority. The same
thing shows all along the line of life.
Teachers know that it is easier to get a
"story" out of a little girl of S than a
buy of the same age. The girl of 12 or 16
is more expressive, more versatile than
her brother. If an old farmer and his
wife have occasion to relate a circum
stance, whicli is readier, more sympa
thetic, more detailed? Of course appar
ent exceptions can be shown in plenty
long special practice makes some males
highly expressive, more so than females
of the same age who have not had the
training. A difference, however, is nat
urally there, and it goes down deep into
the fiber of the race. Perhaps an ex
planation can be found in the different
qualities that have been demanded of the
sexes in order to preserve themselves dur
ing all the ages of the past, back even to
the time when man and woman huddled
in the caves of the mountains. To pre
serve himself and gain happiness man
must fightâ fight off . enemies, fight for
food. To preserve herself and gain hap
piness woman must please â she must be
versatile, adaptable, expressive â if she
would escape misery or destruction she
must be able to play upon the sensibili
ties of the "tyrant man"â her relatives or
her captors. Hence the girls' page in Thdi
Call is better than the boys'.
To the intelligent admirer of children's
stories there is a charm and freshness, a
natural grace
and a delicacy
"of fancy un
known in the
adult writer.
Certainly noth
ing could be

told than the
"New Master." In "A Wild Ride" the
dramatic incidents are caught and forci
bly expressed. "The Two Dreams" is ex
cellent in its way. "Sir Holland, " I
judge, was written by a child who has
passed the myth age. "Sydney's Nug
get" is well written and gives graphically
incidents of pioneer life and peril. "The
Bad Poodle" is exceedingly ridiculous and
' a good thing of its kind. The stories all
point pathetically to the shut-in life and
consequently limited vision of the .city
girl. They are her dreams â her day
dreams, as well as the sleeping one, with
a notable absence of the astonishing
activity ever manifest in living things,
that so thoroughly characterizes the boys'
storie6.
In turning to them we find t"hem char
acteristic of their sports. There is much
of the rollicking, happy-go-lucky spirit.
The spirit of adventure and danger which
our boys court, and wSeh goes far
toward the development of a brave, sturdy
manhood.
From the foolhardy ascent in the bal
loon, the wreck with its accompanying
danger, the spirit of adventure that
prompts the boy to go as a stowaway to
the Cuban port, the desire to prove to
the Indian as great bravery as he, him
self, possesses; the trip to the mountain
to prove to friends the ability to care for
himself, all depict the boy as he
actually lives, loves, hates, works and
plays.
But after all the brobdingnag, when
the danger comes and the trial, there is
the likeness to a woman â I do not mean
weakness, yet it is the weakness and
strength of humanity covered during the
danger by the spirit of "we must act."
"But when Tom was on the ground his
strength was all gone and he fainted."
"Bose received more hugs and his head
was patted more times than could be
counted when Frank saw him once more."
The peril on the mountain is not true.
There is a false idea of bravery that leads
to danger without sufficient cause. "I am
going over the cliff to find Bill." This is
true to the manhood of the boy, but later
it degenerates to mock heroism. They
risk danger for a bearâ and a bear already
dead.
There is a ruggedness, a whole-souled
ness about the boys' stories, a -boldness of
imagination, a vision of life as they see
it. The vision of the girls is as clear and
as. cl^rly expressed, but it has been nar
rowed and cramped by their environment.
In The Call's Is
sue of April 17 the
boys presented a
page of creditable
stories, written

vigor distinctly masculine. But a week
later a page was devoted to the girls'
stories, the merits of which I put down
as follows: First, variety of subject; sec
ond, distinct individuality in style; third,
attention to minor, descriptive details;
fourth better scholarship, as evinced by
attention to technical points allusions,
etc. In freshness and originality honors
are even. But the girls are the champions
if judgment be based on the important
point of literary superiority. The girla
work suggests something J^yond the
work of to-dayâ gives a promise of better
effort later, of broader sympathies. The
boys have set up limitations for them
selves in the shape of a narrowness of
scope, suggestive of one field of sym
pathy bounded by the machine shop, the
prairie, the fortress. There is sex in
taste more than in style.
Judging from the stories alone I find
no marked distinction in the ability of
our boys and
.girls as story
writers. There
are good
stories on each
page. There
is no literary

superiority in
sex among children or adults. The good
story writer is not inspired by genius,
but by hard work, and his ability de
pends upon the training he has had in
thought and expression. The ages of the
children writing the various stories
should be taken Into consideration. On
the whole, however, I believe the boys'
page is the more interesting.
The boy is father to the man and It is
quite as true that the girl is mother to
the woman. If
you doubt this

write stories of adventure and achieve
ment, concise and well expressed. If they
boast a little and make their heroes
achieve results incompatible with the
means at their command they share
this defect with their elders.
The girl writers on the contrary, when
they are not describing the dress of their
heroines or marrying them off in some
delightful way, lose themselves in idle
and fantastic dreams. These traits man
ifest themselves early and continue
through life. They are responsible for
much of the literary trash of the day.
My judgment is that the boys have
written better than the girls have and

I was prepared toÂ» find that the girls
were superior to the boys in this trial
of skill because I have thought that they
were more ptecoeious mentally, and I
have observed that in school, whero
memory plays an important part, they
accomplish equal results. But I see
plainly that they are always girls and
cannot escape from their limitation, and
however lovely they may be and are as
girls, as writers they have not done aa

Mail Company's City of Peking can
be got ready in very short order, and if
â wanted it would not take long to put the
City of Sydney and San Jose in commis
sion. Both vessels will be due to-morrow
from Panama, the Sydney on her regular
lule time, hut the San Jose was not
looked for just yet a while. Besides these
the big colliers Progreso and Willamette
will be in port from Puget Sound, and it
would not take long to get them ready.
They are both good twelve-knot vessels,
and would make good carriers of food,
munitions of war and coal, or they could
be fitted out as troop ships. In any event
there will be lively times around the
Oceanic and Pacific Mail docks this week,
as It looks as though both the City of
Peking and Australia will be fitted out to
Manila.
George W. McNear was out â with his
family in his new launch Port Costa yes
terday. She is a very handsome craft and
one of the fastest of her kind on the bay.
She is fitted with a gns ongine. and
as it drives her a good twelve knots an
hour Mr McNear Is perfectly satisfied.
The Port Costa will be used as a pleasure
1 ".it and also as a dispatch hoat between
San Francisco and Mr. McNear's ware
houses at Port Costa.
ler Klondike steamer arrived from
the Kast yesterday. Sho was formerly a
British vessel, but a large sum of money
was spent in repairing her by her Ameri
can owners, so she was put under the
stars and stripes as the L,eelanaw. After
discharging her cargo of coal the steamer
will be put i;i the St. Michael trade, but
should the occasion warrant she â will also
me her voyages as far as the Ku-
I tick River roM fields. The Leelanaw
t * k sixty-five <;nys to come here from
Baltimore. i>ut considerable time was lost
in the Straits of Magellan.
The schooner Emma Utter bad to return
to port yesterday on nrrount of having
carried away hc-r forestay. She left here
on the 6th inst. for Willapa Bay, but was
caught in a g;i.le that was blowing out
side, and had to return on account of the
above accid> :;t.
Will Make a Technical Fight.
Ex-Ctty Treasurer A. C. Widber, who
embezzled $117,000 belonging to the city
and county, intends making a technical
fight, and when he was called in Judge
Cook's court yesterday to plead to the in
dictment tor embezzlement found against
him by the Grand Jury his attorney en
tered a demurrer to the indictment and
challenged the legality of the Grand Jury.
Judge Cook thereupon made an order di
recting the members of the Grand Jury
to appear before him next Wednesday to
be examined concerning their qualifica
tions to serve.
Violating the Eight-Hour Law.
United States Commissioner Heacock
yesterday held the John Kelso Company
and the San Francisco Bridge Company
for trial in the United States District
Court for violating the Federal eight-hour
law by working their men for ten hours
on April 18 on the site of the new Post
office building. The Kelso Company will
he tried on a similar charge on Friday

NEWS OF THE MINES.
Old Tuolumne Stands
Forth With aGreat Rec
ord for the Year.
Caminetti Law Set on a Firm
Foundation by the U. S.
Court of Appeals.
The statistics of the gold product of
California in 1897, published last week,
display Tuolumne County making the
most rapid strides in the way of in
creased production. Its product of $1,809,
572 is an increase of $739,430 over 1896, and
jumps old Tuolumne from seventh to sec
ond place in rank. Nevada remains the
banner county, with a record of $2,380,756,
in spite of the fact that this shows a de
crease of nearly $500,000. Fresno County
increased its small output more than half,
and Kern shows -an increase of more than
25 per cent. The $37,392 to the credit of
Stanislaus is an increase of 124 per cent.
The other counties showing increased pro
duction are: Humboldt, Lassen, Los An
geles, Mariposa, Mono, San Bernardino,
San Diego. With the exception of Tuo
lumne and Kern, all the counties which
are the heaviest producers show a de
crease. This is mainly due to the lack of
water last season, but possibly it may be
in some degree due, as far as the figures
go, to an increase in conservatism In
making up the estimate.
The decision of the United States Court
of Appeals last week in affirming the de
cision of Judge Ross in the case of the
North Bloomfleld Gravel Mining Company
vs. the United States, upholding and de
ciding the constitutionality of the Caml
netti act, is of exceptional importance to
the hydraulic mining industry- The origi
nal Sawyer decision, which paralyzed hy
draulic mining, was based on common law
grounds only. The North Bloomfleld
Company voluntarily built a restraining
dam before the Caminetti bill was passed,
and resumed operations, as they had a
right to do. in the absence of statutory
regulations, as long as they were not
putting debris in the streams. The Cami
netti act came along with Its prohibition
of hydraulic mining on the watersheds
of the navigable streams of this State
unless a permit was first secured from
Federal engineers composing the Califor
nia Debris Commission. The company re
fused to apply for a permit, holding to a
right to operate as they were doing, as
no damage was resulting. There seemed
no doubt that a permit would have been
readily granted if applied for, as the
company's restraining works were large
and efficient. The fight was one of legal
principle. The court finds that the act is
mandatory and constitutional and that a
permit ia an essential condition of opera
tions. This completely establishes the
jurisdiction of the engineers over all hy
draulic mining in these watersheds.
Tuolumne County's Mineral Wealth, a
bright and newÃy publication Issued
monthly at Sonora, includes this in its
latest issue:
"You can call it a boom or anything else
you please, but the fact remains that
Tuolumne County is experiencing a re
awakening that reminds the old settler of
another time. OnÂ© has not to seek far
to find these evidences of renewed pros
perity. It is to be found In the sharp de
mand for mining property all over the
county, and the enormous Increase in de
velopment work going on all about us. It
is also apparent enough to the person
not immediately concerned in financial
schemes. Look at any of the small towns
that rose like magic in early days and
th*n steadily declined up to a short time
since. A new life seems to have entered
these unpretentious burgs. In several

A man is getting rich at working w-ith
a cyanide plant a mountain of old tail
ings near Yuma, which many experts said
could not be worked at a profit. The la
test account is this from, the Yuma Sun:
'â¢The tailing pond of the old Cargo Mu
chaco mine in San Diego County, which
William D. Luce, the well-known assay
er bought for a royalty of 10 cents per
ton from Hiram W. Blaisdell of this
place, is proving a rich investment for
the deserving man who had the courage
to back his judgment and tests in the
face of repeated discouragements from
able mining men who had had experience
In the Cargo Muchacho. There are about
100.000 tons of tailings and they contain
about $2 in gold per ton. The present
plant enables the working of one hundred

The Sonora Democrat says: A com
pany has at last secured control of the
famous Mazeppa mine on the mother
lode. The property Is the south extension
of the rich Jumper, near Stent, and is
held high in the estimation of all mining
men. The mine was owned by Judge W.
N. Harris, and many efforts have been
made in the past few years to buy, bond
or lease It. One offer of $100,000 in cash
was refused without a moment's hesita
tion. The new company is hearted by
Dew R. Oliver of Stockton and includes
Thomas A. Hender of Sonora, W. H.
Straub of Stockton, David R. Oliver of
Sonora and George L. North of San Fran

A new mining company has recently

There are six men who care very little
for the excitement and boom of the Yu
kon. They have a prospect twenty miles
north of Daggett, from which they have
brought In samples of rock assaying as
high as $917. There have been over sev
enty assays made that have run from $5
to $917 to the ton. One mill run of fifty
pounds of ore netted $16 32. They have a
ledge from five to fifteen feet in thick
ness, and are down only eighty feet.
Some of the rock, to use a miner's ex
pression, was "lousy with gold." This
property is causing considerable excite
ment in the locality known as Paradise
Springs. One of the fortunate men is W.

five being Orin Staples, Y. P., Dan and
Feliz Pricarde and C. L. Lozano of Vic

It la reported that an exceptionally rich
strike of copper has just been made on
the property of the Inyo Mining Com

was made on the 700 level. Besides the
copper, gold, silver and lead ores are now
being taken from this property in pay
ing quantities. It is also reported that
a smelter is now being put in, which will
add materially to the output, as hereto
fore all the "ore was shipped either to
Denver or San Francisco to be smelted.
Owing to the recent copper finds addi
tional mechanism for smelting that ore
will be put in, and within three weeks the
smelter will be in operation.

One of the most healthy of all busi
m-pscs to-day is probably that of copper
production. 'The United States produces
fiO per cent of all the copper of the world.
All the American mines were operated
uninterruptedly last year. Employes
worked Â©very day at fair wages, and the
mines paid satisfactory dividends. Tne

from the nozzle of a monitor used in hy

monitor and was thrown some distance.
He attempted to rise and the stream of

DID NOT LEARN
OUR LANGUAGE
Jose Jacue, a Basque From
Spain, Was Denied
Naturalization.
Had Been in California Eigh
teen Years and Spoke Only
the Spanish Tongue.
Judga Do Haven Did Not Think That
the Man Would Make a Good
Yankee and Rejected Him.
Since Admiral Dewey succeeded In
knocking the enchiladas out of the Span
ish at Manila the subjects of the Queen
1-rgent are in disfavor with Uncle Sam,
but this feeling did not influence United
States District Judge de Haven in the
least when he yesterday refused to make
a citizen of Jose Jacue, a native of the
Basque province of Spain.
The Basques are the most Intelligent,
shrewd and independent of the Spanish
race. They are naturally a business peo-
ple, and nearly all the commerce of that
country is in their hands. Of this thrifty
and enterprising race Is Jose Jacue, one
of the best known traders In wool in this
State. Mr. Jacue came to California in
1880, and six years later took out his pa
pers of declaration of Intention to become
a citizen of the United States. Yesterday
he appeared in the District Court to apply
for full citizenship and to forswear all
allegiance to the Queen Regent or the
King of Spain. His sponsors were C. M.
Vergiz and George C. Alferitz, both of
this city. The sponsors are Basques and
are citizens of the United States, Mr. Al
feritz being a member of the well-known
and responsible firm of Dellepiane & Co.
of San Francisco. They told the court
that since the beginning of war between
the United States and Spain they had
conversed on the matter with Jacue and
found that his sympathies were on the
side of the United States and against
Spain, and that they were confident that
he would make a good Yankee.
Mr. Jacue was represented to be an ex
tensive wool buyer traveling all through
the State in the pursuit of his business,
and bears an excellent reputation for
truth and veracity.
Up to this point everything had gone
on well for the applicant, but there was a
change as soon as Deputy United States
Attorney Schlesinger proceeded to ques
tion him. At the first question Jacue
turned to his Basque sponsors and in
Spanish asked them to translate the
question for him. He admitted that al
though he had been a resident of this
State for eighteen years he had not
learned the English language, which by
universal consent is spoken at Washing
ton and elsewhere in the United Staves
So far as English was concerned it was a
case of "no sabe" with Mr. Jacue.
Mr. Schlesinger glanced at Judge de
Haven and the Judge returned the glance
and remarked that he did not think that
a man who had lived for eighteen years
in California, where the English language
is spoken in its purity, and had not taken
the trouble to learn it, was a fit subject
for citizenship, and denied the applica
tion.
Mr. Jacue and his friends were very

The Monitor Emphasizes the Ji'act
That Catholics of the Emerald
Isle Are Against Spain.
The Catholic organ of this city, the
Monitor, publishes an editorial on "Ire
land and the United States." The publi
cation is occasioned by a dispatch from
London, recently printed, setting forth
that the Catholics of Ireland are favor
able to Spain. That the allegation of the
dispatch was untrue there was no reasor
to doubt, as The Call explained editori
ally next day. The Monitor enlarges
upbn this idea and sustains its position
by an array of facts.
"It is." says The Monitor, "the same old
calumny which has been tramping around
the globe for ages that Catholics cannot
be loyal, cannot be patriotic, cannot be
grateful. The dispatch contains a tissue
of lies. It is a lie from beginning to end
sd far as it deals with Catholic Ireland.
The sympathy of every Irish Nationalist,
and the Irish Nationalists are mainly
Catholic, is with every nation struggling
to be free or waging the battle of lib
erty."
Proceeding, the Monitor cites the
actions of the two Nationalist parties
among the Irish members of Parliament,
thus letting "Catholic Ireland speak for
itself." At a meeting held April 25. and
presided over by John Dillon, the head of
the body, the following was unanimously
adopted:
Resolved, That the Irish National Parlia
mentary party hereby tender Its warmest sym
pathy anri good wishes to the Government and
people of the United States In their humane
efforts to liberate the people of Cuba.
The Redmondlte party has also placed
itself on record thus:
LONDON. May 2.â The Parnellite members
of Parliament have sent the following dispatch
to President McKinley: "In the names of
millions of Irishmen, the Parnellite members
of the House of Commons send their congratu
lations on the brilliant victory of the Amer
ican fleet. JOHN REDMOND "
