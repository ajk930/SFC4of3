NEW YORK. July 31.â The
Herald's Washington correspon
dent sends the following: Pres
ident McKinley and Embassa
dor Cambon, who conducted the
negotiations as to the basis of
peace between the United States
and Spain yesterday, both ex
press confidence to-night that
there will be an early termina
tion of the war. Spain is yet to
be heard from, however, and the
reply that is received from Spain
may prove a disappointment to
the President and the French
Embassador.
Embassador Cambon's powers when
he called at the White House yesterday
. â¢were much more extensive than when
he made his first visit on Tuesday of
last week to ask whether the United
States was willing to take up the ques
tion of peace. He had received in
structions from Spain authorizing him
to present her side of the case and en
deavor to obtain from President Mc-
Kinley terms which would be accept
able in Madrid as a basis for beginning
negotiations for a final treaty of peace.
Those instructions made him acquaint
ed with Spain's position on every ques- j
tion that would probably be treated
in President McKinley's statement of ,
the basis on which the United States ;
would rUscuss peace. lie was told M&at
Spain hoped to be able to get on each |
point, and he was also informed as to 5
the minimum the Madrid Ministry, ;
could consider on each point." He was, j
of course, to strive to bring the United I
States' demands near Spain's hopes, j
and try to prevent them from exceed- 1
ing the minimum that she could con- ]
sider. This was understood by the
President and Secretary Day, and their
hopefulness of an early peace agree
ment arises from the fact that they re
ceived the impression from what the
Embassador said in the course of the
conference yesterday that the terms
proposed by them, with the modifica
tion which he succeeded in obtaining,
cornea within the minimum Spain is
â¢willing to concede, and that the two
countries are therefore upon" common
ground. It is expected that Spain will
attempt to dicker and have the terms
made more favorable to her than in
the draft which Embassador Cambon
received from President McKinley yes
terday. Better terms in regard to the
Philippines is what the Spanish Gov
ernment will contend for most strenu
ously. It is believed, indeed, the con
ditions insisted upon by the United
States in regard to Porto Rico and
Cuba will receive" practically no oppo-
Bition, but Spain will be reluctant to
make any concessions whatever in the
Philippines.
Notwithstanding her reluctance on
this point, the administration believes
from the language and standpoint of
Embassado. Cambon yesterday that
she will yield on this point, too, before
many days. The President did not
make any threat to Spain through the
French Embassador that if the terms
proposed by the United States were
-hot agreed to without delay, the cost
â of the war from now on would be
charged up against Spain and that
each day of delay would r.-uJce the
terms harder. He gave the Embassa
dor to understand very clearly, how
ever, that he wished the Spanish Gov
ernment to know. that the terms pro
â¢ posed in yesterday's note were for that
day only, and if the negotiations were
unduly delayed, it might be impossible
SENATE MAY BE
CALLED TO MEET
IN EXTRO SESSION.
NEW YORK, July 31. â A Washington special to the Herald
says: When the final treaty of peace is negotiated between the United
States and Spain, it must be submitted to the Senate of the United
States for ratification before it can be effective, and it will be in the
power of the Senate to ratify it as a wh*le, reject it as a whole or
amend it. Naturally In so important a matter the Senators would
make every effort to support the administration and would yield
their own judgments as far as possible rather than risk prolonging
the war by rejecting or so amending the treaty as to make it unac
ceptable to the Spanish Government.
It is possible, in view of the dilatory methods of diplomacy, even if
the negotiations should proceed without serious interruption, that
some time may elapse before the treaty would be signed. If the sig
nature should be delayed until near the time for the regular session
of Congress it would be submitted to the Senate immediately on con
vening. If, however, the negotiations should proceed so rapidly that
the treaty may be signed some time before December 1, the Presi
dent would doubtless call an extra session of the Senate for its rati
fication-
The San Francisco Call
for the Madrid Government to again
receive such a favorable proposition.
President McKinley is showing his
confidence in the acceptance by Spain
of the propositions he submitted by al
ready giving consideration to the per
sonnel of the commission which will
represent thj United States in the dis
cuesion of questions affecting the fu
ture of the Philippines, and also to con
sidering plans for the belated summer
vacation which he had intended to fore
go altogether if the war continued.
Both the adminictration and the
Prenbh Embassy are silent as to the
e%f ct modifications of the President's
terms which were made at yesterday's
meeting. The President believes it
amounts to a mere change in the
wording to avoid a misunderstanding
of ,the true meaning of the document
in Madrid, and that it in no way
changed the meaning he intended to
convey. Th_ insistence of Embassador
Cambon for the change, however, in
dicated that he considers it of great
importance, and it may turn out in the
end that it was more material than the
President will now admit
What the desires of the administra
tion are as to territorial expansion in
the Philippines will be indicated with
considerable clearness by the appoint
ment of -r::rr.ipsioiiers on the part 6t
the United States. Members of the
Cabinet declare that no one will be ap
pointed on the commission who will
not favor holding at least all that the
administration wants, and who will not
hold out to the end for these conces
sions. Several names have been men
tioned in connection with the commis
sion. Minister Woodford will surely
be a member of It, former Senator Ed
munds has been mentioned for another
and Secretary Tracy for another.
The name of former Secretary Olney is
being brought forward to-day, and he
is being strongly urged upon the Presi
dent by some Republican Senators who
have unbounded confidence in his firm
ness and who believe he could not only
match any commissioners Spain might
bring forward in shrewdness, but that
he could be depended upon to yield
nothing beyond what might be contem
plated by his Instructions. There has
been some oppostion developed to Ed
munds on account of his known oppo
sition to territorial expansion.
Persons best Informed as to the prob
abilities declare that the answer o-f the
Spanish Government to the terms of
peace outlined by the Government of
the United States is not expected be
fore Tuesday. This opinion is based
upon a knowledge of the time when the
United States' communication was re
ceived In Madrid, which was not until
an early hour this morning, the time re
quired to decipher it, the necessity for
an extended consideration of the mat
ter by the Spanish Cabinet and also the
necessity for carefully framing the re
joinder.
Major General Joseph C. Breckin
ridge. inspecor general of the army,

Major General Wade having been or

to-night by General Breckinridge that
he would leave in the morning for
Chickamauga. General Wade will be
ordered to Porto Rico. Although the
army o-f 30,000, as originally planned
for Porto Rico, has been about com

of forming a provisional division of

ELEMENTS OF NAPOLEON'S DEATH
IN THE PASSING OF BISMARCK
Storm Raged fllong trje North Sea as the Life of the Great German
Statesman Came to a Peaceful Close.
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted. IS9S, by James Gor
don Bennett.
FRIEDRICHSRUHE, July 31.â When
Prince Bismarck died from congestion
of the lungs last night at 11 o'clock the
end came peacefully. His last words
were, "Ich danke dir, mem kind," ad
dressed to the Countesb yon Rantzau,
who wiped the perspiration off his fore
head. Immediately after his death the
windows of his room were thrown open
and the household attaches could see
from the garden their master, lying at
rest on the pillow of his bed, covered
with a white cover, and Herbert Bis
marck bending, grief stricken, gazing
into. his father's face.
The elements of the death of Naj>o
leon I seemed to participate In the
tragic occurrence. A storm raged last
nignt along the North Sea, j&nd there
was a bitter autumnal cold this morn
ing. I have just had a long conversa
tion with Dr. Schweninger, who author
izes me to state that all stories of re
cent interviews with him are pure In
ventions.
"Years ago I certainly said I hoped to
bring the Prince to see the age of 90,
but even then I had to reckon with the
possible baneful effects on his health
of the excitement of the events attend
ing his retirement recently. I have
been prepared fdr the worst, and have
lived backward and forward between
Berlin and Priedrichsruhe.
".Last Thursday I managed to rouse
him to come to dinner. I said to him:
'We must drink a glass of champagne
together.' We did so and he was in
such good spirits that he smoked five
pipes running. Then I persuaded him
to go to bed before I left for Berlin,
which I had to do, although even then I
feared it was only a case of days. Last
night 1 just returned in time to see
him pass away. I feel as if the aim in
my own life were gone. My only con
solation Is that whatever might have
been his previous physical suffering,
which he bore so heroically, his death
was singularly free from suffering and
agony. It was the going out of a light,
Indeed. This afternoon I am going to
embalm the body myself. It is the last
service I can render his precious re
mains. .
"The funeral service will take place
either on Tuesday or Wednesday. He
will pro-bably rest in his coffin in the
room he died in, for he will ultimately
rest in a mausoleum that is going to be
built on a hill opposite the Bchloss, a
spot the Prince once selected himself.
We were out driving together two years
ago when he said: 'I should like to be
buried there, just opposite where I have
lived the last years of my life.' I told
him that In that case it would be best
to put it down in writing. This de did.
and to-day at luncheon the document
containing the dead Prince's wishes
was read aloud. Bismarck will thus
sleep among the trees he loved so well.
I undertsand that when the mausoleum

body will be brought from Varzln to
rest by her husband's side."
Dr. Schweninger further tells me that
Bismarck suffered lately from frequent
intermittent, so-called, soporous at
tacks, from which he either dropped
into a sound sleep or from which he
suddenly recovered full consciousness.
On Saturday afternoon the attacks in
creased In frequency and toward even
ing they even took a more serious form
until death ensued, but even late on
Saturday morning the Prince read the
Hamburger Nachrichten as usual, and
spoke to those around him on politics,
particularly concerning Russia.
LETTER OF THE PRINCE
RESIGNING HIS OFFICE
BERLIN, July 31.â The Lokal Anzei
ger publishes a long article on Bis
marck by Dr. Morltz Busch. It gives
an alleged copy of the original text of
Prince Bismarck's letter to Emperor
William on leaving office in 1890, which
it is understood was only to be pub
lished after his death. In this docu
ment Bismarck Is represented as say
ing: "It is not rossible for me to re

Council of Ministers after your
Majesty, in respect of the same, has

freedom of action in ministerial de
cisions or communications with the
Reichstag or members of the Reichstag
which my constitutional responsibility
requires. It would also â after the lat
est decisions of your Majesty respect
ing the direction to be given over for
eign policy as set forth in the imperial
autograph letter with which your
Majesty yesterday accompanied
the reports of the Consul)â be im
possible for me to carry out the
instructions therein sriven with re
spect to foreign policy. It would
thus call in question all the important
results for the German Empire which
our foreign policy has attained under
unfavorable conuitions on lines laid
down by both your Majesty's predeces
sors. .
"In view of my attachment to the
service of rour Majesty's royal house
and the many years during which I
have grown habituated to a position
which I have hitherto regarded as an
enduring one, it i 3 very painful to me
to sever myself from my accustomed
relations to your Majesty and from the
general policy of the empire and Prus
sia, but after conscientious considera
tion of your Majesty's intentions, for
the execution of which I must be pre
pared if I remain in office, I cannot do
otherwise than beg your majesty to
relieve me of the office of Imperial
Chancellor Premier and Minister of
Foreign Affairs.
"According to the impressions I have
received during the last few weeks, as
well as communications from your
Majesty's military and civil household,
I may assume that my request to re
sign meets with your Majesty's wishes
and that I may therefore certainly re
ly upon its gracious acceptance. I
would have tendered my resignation to
your Majesty long ago if I had not
thought your Majesty wished to util
ize the experience of a true servant of
your predecessors. Since I have be
come certain that your Majesty does
not care to avail herself of them I with
draw from political life, without any
apprehension that public opinion will
condemn my decision as untimely."

PONCE. Porto Rico, Friday, July â¢ 29, .
6 p. m. (via St. Thomas, D. W. 1.. July

army is expected for several days/ j The
transports with General Brooke's army
corps and the remainder of the .First
Corps are arriving slowly. Our troops
will probably remain quiet until the
bulk of the army has been embarked.
Only three transports have arrived
since yesterday. They have just ap
peared in the offing- and only one has,
been out. It has on board the Fifth
Ohio Cavalry. |
General Miles will retain his head-
quarters at the custom house at the
port of Ponce, while General Wilson
will be in immediate command of the
troops in the city. General Wilson
posted General Ernst â ; brigade, con
sisting of. the Second and Third Wis
consin and the Sixteenth Pennsyl
vania Regiments, out a. mile and a half
on the military road after dusk last
night, retaining two companies of the
Sixteenth to act as a provost guard in
the city.
Captain Allison has been appointed
provost marshal, and with the aid of
the local constabuary has preserved
excellent order, although most of the
entire population of the city remained
in the streets celebrating the arrival
of their American liberators until long
after midnight.
During the night all sorts of " wild
rumors were brought into General Wil
son. The first was that the Spanish
were to attack the city in force.
In view of this a strong line of out
posts was maintained by General
Ernst and the men slept on their arms.
This report, however, soon gave away
to rumors that the .Spanish were re
treating, putting entire villages, plan
tation buildings and houses to the
torch, murdering and ravaging as they
went. Some. of the wealthy plantation
owners of the vicinity became horror
stricken and appealed wildly to Gen
eral Wilson to dispatch troops to the
rescue, but , it - was manifestly impos
sible to divide so small a force. None

In the _ forenoon he took luncheon,

"The whole family were assembled at
the bedside at the time of his death and
Dr. Schweninger. Dr. Chrysander and
Baron and Baroness Merck were also
present. As no breathing movement
was perceptible for three minutes Dr.
Bchweninger declared quietly and
simply that the Prince was dead. Dr.

Empfror William in Norway.
"The Prince lies as he used to sleep,
in an easy position, with his head
slightly inclined to the left. The*ex
pression on his face is mild and peace
ful. It is remarked that his head re
mained warm for an unusually long
time. Tn accordance with Bismarck's
wish, he will be buried upon the hill
opposite the castle in the vicinity if

brilliant and immortal services of the
Prince to the Fatherland, his heroic
greatness and his truly German char

Sorrowful sympathy over Prince Bis
marck's death is manifested in many
ways. The news is constantly dis
cussed in public places, and a feeling
of sadness prevails among all classes of
people. Particulars of the last moments
of the Prince and other circumstances
attending his death are eagerly sought.
Many private houses show flags at
half-mast. Secretary of State Yon
Buelow will return from Seimmering,
Austria, immediately.
The papers' comments are still rather
scant. The Vossische Zeitung, con
cluding a long editorial says: ''The
German nation sorrow for the loss of
its eminent statesman, and it will show
itself worthy of the miehty deeds of
the past by preserving the structure of
German unity strong and healthy
through the strength and light of. free-.
dom."
The Tageblatt cavp: "A statesman
of unconquerable will power and tre
mendous boldness, Bismarck was nec

unity from out the ruins of centuries,

TWO ISLANDS
An Expedition Leaves
Honolulu.
SENATOR WILCOX IN CHARGE
WILL HOIST FLAGS ON BYEB.
AND MORELL^
Important That They Be Taken In
Before Their Seizure by the
Powers for Coaling or
Cable Stations.
SEATTLE. July 31.â 0n the day that
the news of annexation was received
in Honolulu an expedition, authorized
by the Hawaiian Republic, started on
a ItOO mile voyage to annex two islands
to the Hawaiian group. The islands in
question are Byer and Morell, about
100 miles apart and noted in the latest
charts as "position doubtful."
Either or both may prove valuable
for guano beds or cable landings and
thus the importance of the expedition
is increased. The Inter-Island Com
pany's steamer Waialeale, one of the
regular passenger boats of the group,
was taken off her run to carry the Ha
waiian commissioner in search of the
new islands. Senator George N. Wil
cox.is the .accredited representative of
the Government and will carry out the
ceremonies of annexation.
The Waialeale left Honolulu a few
hours before the Pacific Mall steamer
Coptic arrived from San Francisco with
the news that Hawaii had been made a
part and parcel of the United States,
consequently Commissioner Wilcox will
not know the republic he is represent
ing no longer exists. The islands may
not be found at all, but a reasonable
length of time will be spent in search
ing for them. An outline of the correct
official precedure for annexation wus
prepared and given to AVilcox. When
he comes: to the islands he will go
ashore, read the proclamation, plant his
flag, erect, loose stone monuments and
leave papers encased in a copper box.
â 'â¢ -Byer and Morell Islands are the only
ones in the Honolulu chain on which
the flag has never been raised. It is
important that they be secured to pre
vent one of the powers seizing them
as a coaling station or for a cable land
ing. Byer Island is 1600 miles from the
islanl of Oahu. It is al*<> called Patro
cino and believed by many to have
been named by the Spanish. Morell
Island is 1700 miles from Oahu,
SHAFTER GIVES HIS
MEN GOOD NEWS
Sick Soldiers Notified That They
Will Soon Be Transferred to
Montauk Point.
WASHINGTON, July 31.â Secretary Al
per is hastening the preparations at Mon
tauk Point for the receptiop of the Fi- . ih
Army Corps now at Santiago.
Surgeon General Sternberg has just' dis
patched Colonel Forwood of his bureau to
the site of the camp with instructions to
erect at once a hospital capable of accom
modating ro lessi than 500 soldiers. Gen
em! Shaftcr ha*' been authorized by a Ca
blegram from Secretary Alger to notify
his soldiers of the good fortune in store
for them in order that the men may be
cheered up to wait with patience for thÂ«-ir
removal. This cannot be effected imme
diately owing- to the condition of the men
themselves. The present plan is to begin
as Boon as possible the transportation to
.M'litauk Point of such of the soldiers as
have recovered from the fever and those
who have not yet contracted it. The sick,
must wait, for the physicians say that the
climatic change Involved in bringing them
North would prove fatal in many cases.
But the delay is not likely to be extended.
Surgeon General Steinberg says that con
valescence in a fever of a type aa mild as
that at Santiago dots no! usually occupy
more than tÂ» n days, although as the sea
son rvns on and the virulence increases
this period is greatly extended.
As soon as that period ia passed thÂ«
men will lie embarked for home. The mat
ter of transports for ' H :.> work is already
under consideration and is likel> to be ad
justed very satisfactorily. The Navy De
partment has concluded that it can dis
pehse with the four big American lino
steamers formerly known as the New
York. St. Louis, St. Paul and Paris, and
the War Department has begun negotia
tions for chartering them. ,
Mr. Groscom, the president of the line,
will meet Colonel Hecker, in charge of the
transportation, to-morrow by appoint
ment at the War Department to make the
necessary arrangements by which the
soldiers of the Fifth Corps can make fly
ing trips on these vessels from Cuba to
the North.

pointment of Lieutenant Richmond P.
Hobson as commander of the now bat-
Ueship Alabama. It says editorially: "It
is not only pood policy, but it is only
just and right the Government should put
a premium on such splendid daring for
our country's cause as that of Hobson.
To leave his splendid deed unrewarded
would be unworthy of the nation for
which he was so ready to sacrifice his
life. We arc building a great battleship,
which has been named for Hobson's na
tive State. He is worthy and in every
way" qualified to command it. To make
Hobson captain of the Alabama would
be to perform an act of perfect justice
and piv<> substantial reward to a young
man whose name hns been written among
those of the famous heroes of the Ameri
can navy. No better recognition of Hob
son's heroic conduct could be given."

"It is not proper *o speak of the hard

I never saw the like before. Nothing

eager desire to dislodge 'the enemy. But
these men should be relieved, as the
excitement is over and a reaction will
set in. The men will lose their stamina

NEW YORK, July 31.â The reports |
that Brooklyn bridge had sunk ten feet ;
while trolley cars wen- stalled on the
south roadway of tho big structure
Frida are now known to have
had some foundation in fact. An in
spection made after the excitement had
subsided Bhowed that the bridge Bag
' ged so much because of the expansion
of the metals of which it is composed,
that the added Fagging occasioned by
the weight of the crowded trolley cars
caused the steel truss to buckle. This
bu< kling was like the removal of a

â¢until the entire weight fell upon the
noise following it
the suspended structure vibrated and
groaned in a way that was terrifying
to all persons on promenade or ill the

dents happened before, and that the |

way impaired, but others are asking

Samuel Probasco, chief engineer of :
the department of bridges, and now in
charge of Brooklyn bridge in the ab-
Bence of Chief Engineer Martin, ad
mits in an interview that the "exces- j
i;- " heat of the last few days has had |
8 the effect of expanding the cables be
yond anything they had yet undergone.
The death of a horse on the south
roadway had paused a blockade of trol

.the south roadway on the main span

I from their dally work. It made their
hearts quail when they felt the struc- |
ture Bag down suddenly and rebound.
A sigh of relief went up when the dead j
animal was removed and the blockade
lifted. It is the lief among many
who regularly cross the bridge that the
accident indicates that the bridge has
reached Its limit of strength in the
present system of elevated and trolley
'cars and that extra precautions will
be necessary to prevent a dangerous
strain on the structure.

shots took effect on the bridge and

nearly all traces of the damage done by

The firing of the port turret gun
â¢across tho upper deck shook the vessel
tder&bly, and she will need a gen
eral overhauling, as her decks and sup
ports have been loosened. If occasion
required, however, the Texas could
fight at a moment's notice, her batteries
being in excellent order. All the sail
ors who were seen said that the Texas
was a wonderful ship and her record off
the Cuban coast had laid at rest the
stories which had been circulated as to
her being an unlucky vessel.
Twenty-two sick sailors and marines
were brought back from the squadron
by the Texas and they were all trans

the navy yard. None of them had been
injured in battle and in n-' case is there
fear of fatal results. Drydock No. 2 is

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July 31.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
telegraphs: While important conclu
sions have been deducted from the ex
perlence of our navy In the existing
war which will be of benefit to the
construction of future war ships these
conclusions tend rather to emphasize
already known than to establish any new
truths. This was devloped during con
versations I have had with prominent
naval experts on duty in Washington.
Those experts have been impelled as
much because of love of their profes
sion as on account of the nature of
their duties to closely follow the war,
and being desirioua of advancing the
navy In every way possible they have
written for and received reports show
ing the performance of ships and ord
inance and of different features of the
vessels, from which they have drawn
their conclusions.
1 have talked with Captain A. S.
Crowninshield, chief of the Bureau of
Navigation: Captain F. W. Dickens,
principal assistant to- chief of the Bu
reau of Navigation; Captain Charles
O'Neill, chief of the Bureau of Ord
nance; Chief Naval Constructor Philip
Hichborn, Engineer In Chief G. W.
Melville and Civil Engineer M. T. En
dicott, the last named chief of the Bu
reau of Yards and Docks. My talk
with these experts develops that the
war has thus far shown: First, that
the gun is still the dominating factor
in war; second, that rapid fire guns are
especially valuable, but that it is ad
visable to- retain guns of large calibers;
third, that smokeless powder is abso
lutely necessary to modren warfare;
fourth, that there should be a great re
duction in the amount of woodwork on
board ship and that that left on board
should be fireproof, some going so far
as to say that woodwork should be
eliminated entirely. Its place to be
taken by some other substance; fifth,
that the armor should be distributed
over the entire ship rather than be lim
ited to the section where its vitals are
located; sixth, that monitors are use
less for cruising purposes or foriighting
in rough waters; seventh, that the
United .States should have a larger
navy, with speedier battle ships and
fast armored cruisers and with coaling
Stations in different sections of the
globe, where men of war can procure
supplies and make? repairs If necessary.

HAVANA. July Advices from San
tiago de Cuba report that the Insurgent
general, Callxto Garcia, "having Income |
disgusted with the Americans, has left
for Puerto Principe to present his com
plaint to the so-called Cuban Govern
ment." General Garcia, It Is said, Is will
ing to dismiss his separatists. The civil
elements have met to protest against the
orders given' by the commander of the
American troops. Senor Castillo will take
the protest to Washing-ton.
La Lucha, commenting on the above
statement, says: "We do not know what
effect the protest will produce on Presi
dent McKinley and his Cabinet, but we |
hope it will not prejudice the general who i
gave the orders, because it cannot be
supposed that President McKinley will
try to weaken the moral strength of the
army chief at the beginning of the cam
paign-, nor even Indirectly the military
authority needful to all chiefs to whom
are intrusted the war's direction, and who
on the ground can better than any one
else appreciate the necessary disposition
and measures to be dictated."
La Lucha adds: .. "If Senor Castillo is
obliged to return after delivering the pro
test In Washington without obtaining I
what he was expected to gain by" those j
who protested, as It Is believed will hap
pen on account of the arguments ad
vanced and the inopportuneness of the
protest of Senor Castillo and others, the
Situation will be little thought of by the
chief of the Invading army and will dem
onstrate the impatience of the Cuban in
surgents, who are not satisfied with the
plans of a government which is accus
tomed to proceed with mathematical cal
culation, the same privately as in public
life."
La c Lucha further says: "One must be
crazy to believe that a regular army, sent
by one country to another to aid a revo
lution against a Government legitimately
constituted, is to be a mere auxiliary to
a force of 8000 or 10,000 armed citizens who
are not recognized by the country 'that
sends its aid even as simple regular war
elements, which has been denied as many
times as it has asked to be recognized
as a belligerent. The United States has
always declared that the Cuban rebels
had a right to ask for" their independence,
but It is of no use to think that a power
ful 'and strong country which decides to
dispute with the sea and land forces the
sovereignty and possession of territory
of another" country to which the territory
by proper rights belongs â  has come to
Cuba to subordinate the United States
army and general to the chief of Irregu
lar forces without military organiza
tion." -â¢â¢-.â¢

On the morning of July 25, a collision

BUSINESS.
TRADE returns were somewhat inconsistent last
week. While the different mercantile concerns
reported an increase in business, the bank clear
ings showed a decrease of 3 per cent, the first loss for
a long time. As these bank clearings are simply cold
figures, without sentience, they are generally accepted
as the best indications of the state of trade, hence the
inference is that they are right and that the mercantile
concerns are wrong, and that the volume of business
was less last week than for the same week in 1897.
But the report of R. G. Dun &; Co. says that con
sidering the decline in prices during the past six
years, the volume of business is about 20 per cent
larger than the volume of clearings indicates. How
ever this may be, trade certainly shows signs of pick
ing up. The iron production during the first half of
1898 was 500,000 tons larger than in the same period
in an)- previous year, and, what is still better, the con
sumption exceeded the output. The new orders re
ceived are surprisingly large for the season, and in
clude 10,000 tons of steel rails for Russia and 5000 for
Japan. In addition, the demand for plates at Pitts
burg is the heaviest ever known. Sales of wool
continue to increase, but there is no improvement in
prices. The situation in cereals continues unfavor
able, and wheat has kept up its slow and steady de
cline, owing to the promise of liberal crops in the
United States and foreign countries. The other
staples show no changes worthy of note, nor are they
expected to until after the midsummer vacation is
over, which will be in another thirty days.
The feeling in Wall street last week was one of in
creased buoyancy. The ease with which the new war
loan was made and its failure to disturb the money
market, coupled with the peace prospects and the
abundance of money, led to a good demand for bonds
and transactions were active in consequence. The
professionals still had the field to themselves, however,
as the public, which left Wall street at the beginning
of the war, have not yet returned. The demand is for
bonds rather than stocks, which are quiet. The money
market of New York continues easy and plentifully
supplied, and present prospects are that we will be
glad to loan Europe a few more millions during the
coming fall, as it is the general expectation that con
siderable gold will be received from there before
winter, and we have got about all we can take care of
now. A country is in a curious condition when it
finds itself overburdened with gold coin, but this is
the condition of the United States to-day.
In the local market there are no new features to re
port, but the old features are more pronounced. The
decline in cereals continues with scarcely any inter
ruption, but prices are still up to a point where it pays
the farmer to raise grain and hay. Unless quotations
fall considerably lower than they are now there will
probably be an immense acreage seeded to hay and
grain during the coming fall and winter. Indeed, the
demand for land in some sections even now exceeds
the supply, which is the most flattering agricultural
sign we have had for years. It was only three years
a?o that land could hardly be rented to tenants at any
piice, hence the present demand for acreage is sig
nificant.
As the season advances the fruit prospects steadily
improve, and at the present writing are brilliant. The
cannes and driers of fruit are scouring the orchard
districts for peaches, apricots and Bartlctt pears, and
prices for all three are steadily advancing. Fresh
apricots are now selling readily up to $70 per ton,
the pears have got up to $40, and freestone peaches are
quoted as high as $45, with clingstones away up out
of sight â as high as $100 having been paid in some
cases. The foreign demand for our canned fruits is
keen, and supplies in England are reported practically
exhausted. It is rather early for new prunes yet, but
they are already selling at an advance of 1 cent per
pound, or $20 per dried ton over the opening prices
of 1807, with a stiff and advancing market. The grape
crop cannot yet be definitely determined, but present
indications point to an average yield, though prices
for grapes and wine cannot of course be forecast at
thi? early day. This is a great year for the orchardist
â that is. for the orchardist who has a good crop.
The effects of the dry winter are becoming more
pronounced as the summer advances. The Weather
Bureau weekly reports are calling attention to the
exhaustion of pasturage in many districts two months
ahead of the usual time, and to the dropping of fruit
ill over the State owing to the extreme dryness of the
ground. Even the ornamental trees around our
dwellings are showing the effects of this dryness. and
â a'e prematurely shedding their leaves, giving the ap
pearance of the approach of winter. But the season
is now so far advanced that this dropping of fruit is
rot alarming, though it will cut down the already light
yield more or less, and at the same time tend to
harden quotations for the rest of the year.
The mismanagers of Agnews are unable to dis
cover that they are anything of the sort. Also, they
are ungrateful, for the efforts to enlighten their un
derstandings, quicken their consciences and impel
their resignations have not elicited from them so
much as a vote of thanks
DEWEY AS A DIPLOMATIST.
WHILE information concerning the situation at
the Philippines is not sufficiently full to af
ford a basis for a final judgment of the extent
of the difficulties Admiral Dewey has surmounted in
maintaining order there, enough is known to justify
the conclusion that he deserves as much credit for his
diplomacy as for his naval strategy and courage in
battle.
This much of the situation is known: The destruc
tion of the Spanish fleet placed Dewey in command
of the bay at Manila and in a position from which he
could bombard and reduce the city at his pleasure,
but without a sufficient force to take possession of it
and overawe the surrounding country. In the city
was a Spanish garrison half mad with rage and hatred.
Beyond the city were numerous bands of insurgent
natives eager for plunder and massacre. A consider
able European colony with homes in the city or its
suburbs constituted an element more or less hostile
to our invasion, several European merchant vessels
lay in the bay, and there also were warships of various
powers, some of them ready to intervene at the slight
est provocation.
Running through all of these diverse elements was
a many sided antagonism exciting all and incessantly
menacing an outbreak. There was danger that the
insurgents might ravage the homes and property of
the European residents outside the city and thus af
ford an excuse for the interference of the foreign
fleets. Some of the captains of merchant vessels
claimed the right to come and go in the harbor, land
ing or receiving cargoes at their pleasure. Some of
the commanders of the warships were inclined to sup
port the merchantmen in their claims. All of these
conflicting elements Dewey had to manage and con
trol with the comparatively small force at his com
mand.
The incident of the German gunboat Irene at Subic
Bay shows the critical nature of the situation. As is
now well known, a number of German and other
foreign residents of the district around the bay had
taken refuge on Isla Grande, and there the insurgents
prepared to attack them and the Spanish force that
protected them. The Irene interfered to prevent the
assault, as her commander said, "in the interests of
humanity." It was an incident that might have hap
pened almost anywhere in the neighborhood of
Manila at almost any time since Dewey destroyed the
Spanish fleet. It was an inevitable outcome of the
situation, and a consideration of it shows how critical
that situation was.
A brave commander without tact, or a commander
of tact but without moral as well as physical courage,
would have failed to keep order under such adverse
conditions. The admiral had to hold the Span
iards in check, compel the wild and half savage in
surgents to obey the rules of civilized war, force
European merchants and sea captains to respect the
blockade, protect the property of foreigners, and at
the same time firmly refuse to permit any foreign
warship to interfere in any way whatever.
All of these things Dewey managed to do with dis
tinguished success. Now that the army has arrived
the danger is about over. Our force there will soon
be strong enough to take possession of the islands
and establish the order of military law. There will
then be little or no probability of foreign interference.
The military commander will have a difficult task,
doubtless, but it will not be so critical and so delicate
as that which confronted Dewey. To the admiral,
therefore, is due as much credit for the fighting and
conflicts he has managed to avoid as for the one he
fought out in the accomplishment of his glorious vic
tory.
SPEEDIER BATTLE-SHIPS.
REPORTS from Washington to the effect that
Secretary Long proposes to take measures to
insure for the three battle-ships recently author
ized by Congress a greater speed than that possessed
by those now in service will be gratifying to all
persons of progressive tendencies.
Our battle-ships have been constructed in the past
mainly for the protection of our coasts. The fact
that the Oregon was able to make a voyage around
the Horn and reach the seat of war in the West
Indies in a condition fit for battle was due rather
to the excellence of her construction than to original
design, for she was not intended for such service.
It is now clear, however, that we may have to fight
naval battles in the most remote parts of the world,
and, therefore, our big battle-ships must be designed
for speed as well as for strength and power.
Improvements in machinery are going on all the
time, and in no department of mechanism have those
improvements been more notable of late than in the
engines of steam vessels. It is in the highest degree
probable that with improved engines and other ma
chinery it will be possible for us to construct our
new battle-ships with as heavy defensive armor and
as powerful offensive weapons as those now in ser
vice, and at the same time make them almost as
speedy as one of our present cruisers.
The extraordinary feat recently performed by the
Turbina in what appears to have been a thorough
test off the coast of England is an evidence of what
may be reasonably expected of improved machinery.
It gives encouragement to those who believe it will
be possible to make our new battle-ships far more
formidable war machines than any now to be found
among the navies of the world.
European nations have been devoting a good deal
of attention to the construction of swift battle-ships.
The British have even sacrificed something of fight
ing force to gain it. This was on their part some
thing of a necessity, since their widely scattered em
pire Tequires a swift fleet for its adequate protection;
but the policy seems to be approved by all nations.
Cervera's fleet, for example, was swifter than our
own, and had it been well supplied with coal and
ammunition, well manned and well officered, it would
probably have steamed away from Sampson and
Schley, and menaced our Atlantic coast with com
parative impunity.
Secretary Long, it is announced, will insert in his
advertisement for bids for the construction of the
proposed vessels a clause notifying bidders that pro
posals will be given preference which promise the
highest rate of speed, and bidders *r?l] be allowed
to submit their own designs for machinery. This
plan offers a fair prospect for success. It will rouse
the emulation of all the great ship-building firms of
the country. ar| d ss t them to work obtaining the best
machinery in the world for naval construction. San
Francisco ought to get the contract for at least one
of the three battle-ships, and she should be made a
record breaker, eclipsing the Oregon itself, and
worthily bearing the name "California."
Captain Philip claims a share of glory for the
Texas, and the former hoodoo of the navy is wel
come to it. The Texas acted nobly: It not only
fought like a whole fleet, but it refrained from what
must have been a strong impulse to chase the enemy
ashore and tree them.
GraduaJJy the Eighth Regiment is becoming in
~d to the hardships of war. While it was being vac-
: nated only one man in twenty fainted.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 1, 1898.
WhJY WE FfllL. AT WASHINGTON
JOHN E. QUINN contributes to the current
number of the Merchants' Association Review
a short but striking article, setting forth the
well-known weakness of Califc/nia at Washington
and pointing out the remedy for it. The subject is
particularly pertinent now in view of the approach
ing election of Congressmen, but it will be always one
of importance to Californians until we have so
aroused ourselves and exerted our energies as to at
tain our rightful prestige in the Union.
There is, as Mr. Quinn says, no State that con
tributes so much to the national treasury and receives
so little for public and needed improvements. It is
unnecessary to cite proofs of the statement. While
other States obtain large sums for comparatively small
streams and insignificant harbors, our great rivers
and San Francisco Bay are almost neglected. While
public buildings for Eastern cities are pushed for
ward with vigor, the postofficc proposed for San
Francisco so long ago that the memory of man
hardly runneth to the contrary still remains a hole
in the ground supplemented by a blue print on file
in the architect's office.
The responsibility for this bad condition of affairs
rests not altogether upon the officials at Washington
and our delegation in Congress. The people of the
State as a whole are to blame in the matter. We have
never pushed our claims on the National Govern
ment with as much force as other States, and as a
consequence there has happened to us that which
happens to every community and to every individual
that forgets the wisdom or neglects the practice of
self-help. As Mr. Quinn says, "we petition, we hold
mass-meetings, we resolve we want such and such a
thing, and that is the end of it. Our politicians know
our weakness and act accordingly."
The remedy of a greater public spirit and a more
incessant activity among all classes of citizens to sup
port every movement for obtaining adequate appro
priations for California is suggested by the article.
There is, however, another point that should not be
overlooked in this connection. We must, as The Call
has repeatedly pointed out, maintain at Washington
a delegation sufficiently strong and experienced to
exert a potent influence among Congressmen. We
have in the past changed our representatives too
often. We have now too many free-traders repre
senting districts that require protection for their in
dustries, too many silver cranks representing con
stituencies whose welfare is inseparably bound up
with sound money, too many raw men unfamiliar with
Congress who can accomplish nothing.
At the coming election we should send to Con
gress a strong delegation thoroughly representative
of the interests and the people of the State, and
thereafter maintain it there. With such a delegation
earnestly supported at home. California would soon
gain her rightful rank at Washington, and we should
have no longer any cause to complain of the neglect
of our interests by the National Government.
STATUS OF THE WhjISKER.
NOBODY who has made use of the opportunities
for observation can deny that there are men
who joy in their whiskers, who watch
them grow as the painter watches a canvas de
velop under his touch, as the lovelorn youth eyes
the budding life of spring, writing a poem concerning
the same. Some people hear music in the soughing
of the zephyr among the trees, but it is as nothing
to the melody produced when the winds of heaven
toy with the full-blown Populist whisker. Deprive a
beaided beauty of his Van Dykes and he becomes a
lantern-jawed chromo with an exposure of chin. In
other words, the cultivation of the various whisker is
but a form of the pursuit of happiness guaranteed by
the constitution.
An attempt has been made to abridge this right.
A club made up of men who wear any sort of whis
ker they like or go bald-faced if it suits them better,
has decreed that all employes shall be smooth shaved.
That with one accord the employes sought the barber
show? that they were born to be slaves. Had they
reflected a moment they would have realized that an
imposition, inspired by jealousy, was being prac
ticed upon them. They meekly submitted and they
deserve no sympathy. As a matter of right and con
stitutional law one man has no business to say
whether or not another man shall shave. Let him
mow his own crop, but keep out of his neighbor's
field.
If the Pacific Union Club can make its servants
either shave or go jobless into the cold world it has
an equal privilege of decreeing that they shall have
their ears cropped and wear a fishbone in the nose.
An order of this sort would be as seemly and sen
sible. If a man cannot follow his notion as to the
utility of beard or no beard, where Is this boasted
American liberty which wants to spread itself to the
isles of the sea?
*' I WILL neither yield to the song of the siren,
I nor the voice of the hyena, the tears of the
crocodile, nor the howling of the wolf."
Thus Chapman wrote many years ago, showing
that the head on his shoulders was level and had
something in it. Much as Chapman knew it is hardly
possible that he looked forward to the time when
San Francisco's yellow journal would have a siren of
its own, a steam siren, a diabolical siren, and blow
it with tRe interest and perspicuity of a boy gladdened
by possession of a tin trumpet. The siren has de
veloped into a nuisance. Not content with being an
noying in a quiet fashion, the Examiner must get a
mechanical device to impress upon the community
a new sense of its unworth.
The song of this modern siren is not alluring.
Chapman would have found no strain in resisting
yielding to it, although he might have yielded to an
impulse toward profanity and called for the police.
But if the idea is to draw a crowd it is about as cor
rect as the average Examiner idea. With fingers in
iis ears, the crowd would flee away. Had the old
fashioned siren whose forte was the fooling of
mariners been run by steam, the mariners would have
been safe enough; they would have taken to the
open sea.
Still, although Chapman could not have had yellow
journalism in his mind, he hit it off remarkably well
and sized up human nature to a nicety. The voice o\
the hyena, the tears of the crocodile and the howling
of the wolf all belong to it. Chapman boldly declared
he would not yield to any of them, and greatly to the
pain and surprise of the>- Hearstlings the same spirit
prevails yet. Vainly they weep and howl, and vainly
they purchase a siren hurtling discords. Nobody is
inclined to yield.
Spain, with all her foolishness, is foxy. Vague
overtures for peace seem to have been made with a
view to checking the advance of the United States
toward Porto Rico. But this country, although dis
posed to clemency, has some thirteen-inch diplomacy
itself.
Porto Rico is exhibiting unexpected symptoms of
joy at being captured.
SONG OF THE SIREN.
NEWS OF THE MINES.
The project of unwatering the lower
lovela of the great Comstock. resuming
the working of the lower levels and going
deeper than ever before in quest of new
bonanzas is the biggest and most interest
ing one in the mining Held of the Pacific
Coast just now. There can be no doubt
that the great project will be carried out
some day, and the present effort, which
Is yet a vague one, may possibly succeed,
but if so actual operations are a good
way off. That the unexplored depths of
the lode hold undiscovered bonanzas as
rich as those which made the past glo
rious cannot fairly be doubted. ThÂ« same
bold and enterprising operations which
marked the boom times of the Cometock
would now soon uncover them. But the
same bold enterprise cannot be displayed
now. In the past, boards of directors
were able to command all the money they
wanted and take what chances they
would in costly exploration and develop
ment work, because the money could be
raised easily by assessments. The stock
holders assessed were interested only as
stock gamblers, and all they cared for
was a jump in stocks. It was ihis condi
tion that made the mining operations on
tho Comstock the boldest the world nas
seen. No private owners, however weal
thy, would have risked the same- invest
ments. The stocks cannot now be as
sessed to pay for the costly operations
planned. It becomes a legitimate mining
enterprise, for which large capital is" re
quired, and tho principal owners must
Und the money. This linding of the
money is the trouble, and ideas of yov
ernment aid ana of bonds guaranteed by
the Slate of Nevada indicate the fact that
a good deal of time and effort must be
expenued before anything is done. It is
ova that it Is just in the midst of this
new agitation that the lowest ebb of the
Comstock should be suddenly marked.
This event has brought its condition
home to the Comstock in a more forcible
way than any event of recent years. It
is compared to rats leaving a sinking
ship. But yet there is no doubt that a
new and great future Is in store for the
Comstock.
River dredgers, working bars and shore

Hall City, the mining camp in the neigh
borhood 6f Harrison Gulch, is now on
the boom, there being several mills at
work crushing high grade ore, employ
ing several hundred men. The Gold Hill
mini' alone is running with 200 men and
the daily output from the mill is about
$500 per ton of ore. Last month the clean
up was over $19,000. So says the Red
Bluff News.
John Daggett will commence opera
tions in the lower tunnel of the Black
Bear mine on an expensive scale. Two
different shafts have been commenced in
the old main tunnel, and reports are cir

discovered in the new six-foot shaft that
will run about $30 to the ton.â Scott Val

of 500 feet. The ore body shows a live
foot vein of dark, close-grained, blui^

per ton. More than anything else It
shows the permanency of the ledges: as
for the pitch of the ore chute the same
vein passes under the Kinyon and \v fÂ«f e <
only at a greater depth. The Little
Butt f people are feeling mighty good over
their prospects and employes take re

Randsburg now has its long needed
water supply In operation,. It is piped
from wells four and a half miles distant
and is delivered at flre pressure.
The Randsburg Miner says that W. K.
Miller's stage line between Johannesburg
and Ballarat will soon be extended clear
through to Keeler, and that the Santa
Fe road will sell tickets to Keeler via
Johannesburg. Very good news, if true.
The gap of about forty-three miies be
tween Ballarat ar.l Darwin will thus be
filled, the road running through Shep
herd Canyon and passing what .was
known as Panamlnt Junction In early
days, when stages were flying al over
that country.
According to the Bodie Miner-Index
that town has untold wealth in the shape
of rich gravel, which would be a bonanza
in some places, but which, under the con
ditions, does not allure capital yet. "A
few days ago," says that paper, "we saw
ten pounds of dirt prospected. It was
taken haphazard from the hillside back
of the Catholic Church, and all pulverised
finely in mortar, the result skowfng a
value of something more than $4 per
ton. We have seen several similar me
chanical tests of the hillside soil made,
and none of It showed less than $2 50 per
ton."
Somewhere about 15,000 tons of tailings
are being treated monthly at the local
cyanide plantâ the South End, Stand

not counted, though in operation. When

The mining interests of Southern Ore
gon have suffered from drought as se
verely as any part of California, accord
ing to the following statement in the Ore
gon Mining Journal:
The partial failure last winter of the
mining season in Southern Oregon has
been the most serious blow this section
has received in years. As is known, the
drought which extended all over Califor
nia extended up to the Calipoola Moun
tains, so that In Josephine County, the
great mining county of the section, near
ly all the hydraulic mines closed down
after only a few weeks' run, while the
hundreds of small placer miners operat
ing with the ground sluice failed to take
out any gold at all. The direct conse
quences of this state of affairs has been
a reduction of the gold output of the sec
toin fully one-half, and an indirect con
serjuence has been an exodus of men to
other sections in search of work during
the summer and until the fall rains shall
again make it possible to operate the
ground sluices."
As the result of securing control of new
mining territory through the war with
Spain an era of mining stampedes may be
expected. Within another year the min
eral resources of the Philippine Islands
will begin to attract attention, in all
probability, and the usual novelty of dis
tance will lend a charm to the claims
which the transportation companies will
be only too glad to magnify. There is no
doubt as to the legitimate mining wealth
of Cuba, 'ihc great iron deposits near
Santiago are capable of vast exploitation
and the production of enormous wealth.
The portions already worked cost about
$3,000,000 and have proved profitable at
that price. There is almost no limit to |
their productive capacity. Other miner- :
als abound, and Cuba as a winter propo
sition will no doubt be much sought after '
by practical miners. â Western Mining |

Is a notorious medium who limps pain
fully as he goes about his daily avocation
of raking in the coin of the credulous.
Skeptics scornfully assert that of late
the materialized spirits which issue from
the cabinet have shown a marked tend
ency toward lameness. The true believ
ers, on the other hand, are only con
firmed in their faith by this circum
stance. They point to the fact as a con
clusive proof of the exquisite sympathy
of their favorite medium, whose refined

ailments communicate themselves to the
ethereal beings which appear at his call.
The medium was holding a highly suc
cessful materializing seance, and his star
was shining brightly, when the politician
appeared in opposition. The two planets,
each luminous in its own sphere, collided,
there was an astronomical convulsion,
and hence all these tears.
The politician, with a few faithful
friends, had been traversing the cocktail
route rather freely, and the party were
in a merry mood. Some one suggested
the materializing seance as a means of
recreation. Then a brilliant idea struck
the politician. "I will buy me," he said,
"one of those lady's hatpins which are
like unto daggers, and then we will see
the kind of material with which spirits
are stuffed." He threaded the hatpin
up and down the side of his trousers, so
that it could bo easily withdrawn.
All might have gone well had not the
medium been a large, powerful man, who
once earned his living as a blacksmith.
An enthusiastic lady believer asked to see
her father, and after the usual amount
of coy hesitation that gentleman oblig
ingly emerged from the cabinet. Clad in
shimmering white, he glided round the
awe-stricken circle, stopping only to wave
a ghostly blessing over the politician's
head. That gentleman explained that he
woulrt feel much more satisfied if he could
shake hands with the spirit, and the fa
vor was granted.
orasplng firmly the clammy hand of a
being from another world, he drew forth
his trusty hatpin and jabbed it with all
his might into the mass of phosphores
cent drapery. There was an awful yell,
and the air seemed to turn blue with
profanity.
"Holy Moses!" shrieked the ethereal
spirit; "I'm killed:"
Then, from out the semi-darkness, a
huge materialized fist rushed violently
Into contact with the politician's right
eye. Instantly another performed the
same service for the left, and the politi
cian saw nothing but fireworks fot some
minutes.
When the free fight which followed was
over, a very much disheveled polltM ;u ,
lay panting on the floor, and a breathless
medium was vainly striving to commun*
with the spirits in the cabinet.

meddle with the spirits; it disturbs the

the pursuit of the proper policy, are what
offends and exasperates the relatives and
friends of the men.
"it Is the general opinion among those
who have visited the several camps |
known as Camp Merritt that It would
have been difficult for those in power to
select a more desolate, unhospitable and
unsanitary location than the one to

Those who are left to light the adverse

ADDRESS TO THE FLAG.
Chaplain Miller of the Eighth
California Delivers a Patri-
otic Sermon at Camp
Barrett
CAMP BARRKTT, SATIIKR TRACT,
July ILâ The text of Chaplain Miller's
discourse at this morning's service was
Psalms xx:j, "In the name of God we
lift up the banner." The sermon was an
address to the Hag. The colors of the
regiment were brought into the open
space in front of the colonel's tent by
the color-bearers, and the greater portion
of the regiment surrounded the chaplain
in the form of a hollo-w square. A choir
of young men of the regiment wiw pres
ent, ana the regimental hand played ac
ci.n.puniments t" the hymns. The at
tendanoe was three times as large as last
Sunday. In the evening services were
held In the Christian Commission tent,
which was crowded. During the services
Edward 1). Collins, president of the Cali
fornia Hank, who has shown a very deep
.B t in the Christian Commission
work, made a brief address.
The good moral atmosphere of Camp
Barrett is amply demonstrated by the
fact that out of about 1340 men only two
are in the guardhouse.
The officer of the day was Captain L.
E. I .yon; officer of the puard, Lieutenant
J. EL-Tyrell, and supernumerary of guard,
Lieutenant 11. B. Benson.
Mrs. John R. Kfdder of Grass Valley,
president of the Reel Cross Society of that
place, paid Camp Merrltt a visit this
afternoon and expressed herself <(.>â  highly
pleased with the society work and , the
general condition of affairs.
There are about fifteen cases In the
hospital. They are mostly colds, pros
trations, etc., from which no serious re
sults are expected. ;;'-. :
Praise for the Nurses.
In justice tn tho hospital nurse? of thÂ«
Seventh California Regiment, who have
been charged with neglect, th*Â» visiting
committee of the Catholic Truth Society,
conflating Of the Misses Glbon and Mlks
Thomas, state that they have visited the
hospital daily since the arrival of the rag;
irmnt. They have always found the
nurses at their post n.nd attending to th.-lr
duty In a capable manner. The commit
tee adds that few regiments are supplied
with more elfiHcnt and painstaking
nurses than the Seventh.
Wishes to Go to Manila.
J. IT. Goldsmith of Compnny A, Blxth
California, stationed ;it Alcatraz Island.
Is a well known newspaper man, having
published papers in various parts of Cali
fornia and Oregon. He is In hopes that
his regiment will be sent to Manila, and
is desirous of eventually publishing a
dally newspaper In that city, which he
thinks will be a paying proposition after
a <aiile bafl been laid between Manila
and Hongkong.

ter.lay morning where it was found that
both bones of her left leg were fractured.
She was going down stairs and was talk

became so excited that she forgot she was
not at the bottom of the stairs and fell.
She iÂ« nearly 70 years of age and has lived
in the city for about half Â« century.
SPAIN NEGLECTFUL OF
THE CAROLINES
I. M. CHANNON, A MISSIONARY,
SPEAKS OF THE ISLANDS.
Commercial and Agricultural Be
aources That Are Not Devel
oped for Want of Enter
prise.
I. M. Channon. a Congregational min
ister and prominent member of the Amer
ican I!oard of Missionaries, arrived In
this city yesterday on his way* to Kusai,
one of I ' the smaller islands of the Caro
line group. He has been In the East on
a well earned vacation, having spent the
last seven years of his life converting the
natives of the Caroline and the Gilbert
groups of Islands.
Mr. Channon told an interesting tale
of his missionary work and the condi
tions under which he has labored for the
sake of civilization and religion. "Mis
sionary work has showed some good re
sults In the Carolines," he said, "though
It is impeded by the presence of the
Spanish. Thlry years ago the first
missionaries went lo that coun
try, and there lias been no cessation In
the striving for the spiritual welfare of
the natives since that time. They are a
docile people and friendly to the Ameri
can flag. The greatest enemy to the ad
vancement of our work has been the
Spanish. In ISOO they landed troops on
Ponape, one of the larger islands, and
almost immediately an Insurrectionary
war broke out in which the natives
proved the better lighters. About seven
killed sums up the loss of the native
army while at least bOO Spaniards gave
up their lives. Since that time Spain has
seen fit to consider the Island under an
armed peace. Though no war of any
kind has been waged on the islands from
that day to this the Spanish soldiery has
remained, occupying Just the territory
on which they are encamped.
"The entire population of the islands
is about 100,000, and I think that out of
this number we have over 10,000 converts,
6000 of whom are active church members.
The commercial and agricultural re
sources of the Islands â¢ are far, greater
than the present development would in
dicate. Sugar cane/coffee and cobra
could bo raised in large quantities were
an energetic people to engage In the de
velopment of these natural products.
Most of the business is transacted by Ger
mans â¢ who are well established on the
several islands of the group. Spain has
not gained anything by the possession of
the Carolines. The Insurrection cost that
country $3,000,000, and they have not re
ceived that much In return since their
holding. The islands are visited once
every three months by a steamer com
ing from the Philippines. As a rule there
Is one Spanish gunboat Ptatloned t:Â»re,
but the lust I know of to have "atroled
the. bays and harbors of the Carolines
was the Callao. the gunboat whj cn
was captured In Manila Bay. The
Callao left shortly before the outbreak
of the war. and I am of the opinion that
no other vessel of any kind has arrived
nt any one of the Carolines since that
time, and that the people living there
have not yet received information that
Spain and the United States are at war.
"The Spaniards have tried to freeze the
missionaries out at the Carolines, but
they never attempted personal violence.
I think that our work will be full of
trouble as soon as the war Is at an end.
Though I have no fear that the Spaniards
will practice any indignities upon us, yet
they might make It uncomfortable for
foreigners by inciting the natives against
The Rev Mr. Channon -will return to
the Islands on a schooner flying the Eng

school for missionary teachers estab

has recently sold an unworked gold mine
he baa owned for years to an English
syndicate for $506,000, and another syn

CAUSE OF THE
GREAT DROUGHT
Unga Island Was Its
Starting Point.
JAPAN CURRENT GOT CHILLED
HAMMON'S STRIKING DISCOV
ERY AS TO THE REASON.
May Hereafter Be Able to Predict a
Dry Summer in the Preced
ing Spring.
Forecast Official Hammon is seriously
working out a way of casting the horo
scope of California's climate months
ahead, so as to be able to warn the peo
ple of the valleys and mountains when
another drought is coming. The new Idea
is that in years when the great Japan
current, which swoops across the North
Pacific Ocean just south of the Aleutian
Islands, and then down the Pacific coast,
swings farther to the north and closer
to those Islands, it becomes colder there
and later colder here, and the effect of
this chilling of the water off the Califor
nia coast is to lessen the precipitation.
This being the case, all that is neces
sary is to keep the Japan current located
up there in the north. When It is caught
swinging north, to cool off, as it appa
rently does, for some unknown reason,
now and then, it may be known that the
water will be unusually cold off the Cali
fornia coast when the chilled current gets
here. That trip takes about three
months, so that if it is known here late
in the summer and in the fall and In the
Winter what the Japan current is doing,
it can be predicted in a general way that
there will or will not be the usual pre
cipitation here three or four months
later. If it should be found that when
the current goes north in the fall it stays
thi-r^ all winter, that would give us a
pointer about our spring rains six months
off.
Mr. Hammon has developed some strik
ing facts pointing to the correctness of
his theory. He beuan with a comparative
study of the mass of water from the
north within a region of 30u miles off the
California toast. He observes:
The amount of rainfall appears to be some
what proportional to- the number of degrees
that the sea temperature is .higher than the
land. This was observed by studying the rec
ords of water temperatures taken by vessels
off this coast as reported to the hydrographlc
office. It was also -observed by Professor
George Davidson some years ago. If by any
means we were"able to distinguish those years,
when the sea r temperatures would be abnor
mally cold, we might -conclude . that these
would be dry seasons for California.
Â» â¢ â¢ Â°
A record of temperature on Unga Island, one
of the Aleutian group, has been maintained
during the past f-ur years, showing that dur
ing the past year the winter montha averaged
5 degrees higher temperature than usual. I'n
fortunately there are no other records known
to exist from those islands of previous dry
years in California, except an old Russian
record from Unabaska Island. This covers the
pt-rioil from 18$) to 1534, Inclusive. It shows
that the year IS>2S was abnormally warm, the
winter months from 2 to 10 degrees above the
normal. No California ralnfull records are In
existence for that period, but in Hancroft's
History of California are given statistics of
grain yields u.t toe Millions along tIW coast
from San Rafael to San Diego. These show
general failure of thepe crops at all missions
In 1829, the total yield being but 36.0u0 bush
ela while the average annual yield tot the de
cade of i^';-3". Inclusive, was 87.250 bushels.
This marked failure in crops In 1529 is strong
evidence of. drought during the winter of
182S-29.
Mr. Hammon worked out a chart Indi
cating by a curved line the departures
from the" normal temperature at I'nga
Island during the past four years, and a
similar chart showing the departures
from the normal precipitation here. A\ hen
these curves were opposed to each other,
with the proper three months' difference
that is, September at I'nga opposed to
December hereâ the correpondence was
remarkable. During the rainy season of
all theicf years, when the temperature
Curve of Unga Island goes up the curve
of precipitation here goes down, and the
farther orte gl>Â«S up the farther the other
goes down. Says Mr. Hammon:
Satisfactory seasonal forecasts are not un
kn. WB A.I present the Indian Meteorological
Bureau are foretelling 'jutte accurately in gfn
eral terms the character of the coming sea
Â»on The very abriormal conditions that have
prevailed during the past year over an ex
teifslvp area jnust be aesociat^d with very no
ticeable cbanges elsewhere. Should further in
vestisatiori prove that these conditions were
due to changes in the Japan current, notice
able thousands of miles from this shore, the
value of the discovery would be Inestimable.

compll-'l tables, and Is the first general
and comprehensive statement concerning
the drought that has appeared. The rain

THE SAIST FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 1, 1893.
SAVED FROM A
WATERY GRAVE
Heroic Work of Mate
Novey of the Eclipse.
A RESCUE IN A HEAVY BLOW
TWO NOTORIOUS PICKPOCKETS
ROUNDED UP.
A Mutiny on the Martha Fisher
Promptly Squelched by a
Determined Com
mander.
A thrilling incident In the passage of
the ship Eclipse, which arrived from Seat
tle Saturday night, was narrated. by one
of the crew yesterday. While off Cape
Flattery a sailor named Murphy was In
the act of reefing the Jib when a sudden
lurch of the vessel throw him into the
water. The wind was blowing a gale and
the ship was making good headway when
the accident happened. Mate Novey saw
Murphy struggling In the water and rush-
Ing to the stern threw him a lifebuoy,
which he grasped. Imedlately on the cry
of "man overboard" Captain Peterson
hove to his vessel, and Mate Novey and
four of the crew manned the lifeboat and
picked him up. '
That Murphy escaped drowning is lHtle
short of a miracle, as in scores of similar
eases the unfortunate seaman has per
! ished. That he was saved was due to tne
quickness and coolness of Mate Novey
and Captain Peterson.
The Bark Martha Fisher, which arrived
in port yesterday after a voyage of sev
enty-Bttven days from Newcastle, reported
a mutiny which was squelched in its In
fancy. Sea lawyers on board the vessel
stirred up ill feeling among thecrew by
condemning the "grub" as unfit to eat. â¢
Complaint was made to Captain Ferris, '
and five of the men. believing they were
badly treated, refused to do duty. The
commander resorted to extreme measures.
The men were placed in irons for two
days and were thoroughly cured of their ;
complaint. They appealed to Captain Fer
ris to he liberated and on promise that
they would be more obedient he set the m
free. After that all was peaceful. The
bark brings a cargo for a local firm.
Queen of the Isles, a new boat just
turned out Of Captain Turner's shipyards
at Benicia. anchored at Howard-street ]
wharf late yesterday afternoon and at- !
traded a great deal of attention. Her ;
bright appearance and graceful lines were
favorably commented on. Captain Weir,
her owner, states that she will shortly
leave for the Caroline Islands on a gener
al trading venture.
The schooner Santa Cruz, which left the '
islands after which she is named on the
15th of July, anchored in the stream y.es- â 
terday. She brought a light cargo of
wines and staple goods and as soon as she j
discharges her cargo will be completely j
overhauled.
Interest in the various transports that ,
will shortly leave for Manila is increas- \
ing. Hundreds of people visited the water
front for a glimpse of the huge steam- ;
ers. Armed guards prevented a Closer
Inspection, much to the disappointment
of those who came down.
The steamer Charles Nelson, which will
carry troops to Honolulu, arrived from
Seattle yesterday and joined the fleet.
A scene of activity hovered about the
Main-street dock. Hay and grain suttl
dent for six months' use was being taken j
aboard the three-masted ship Tacoma,
and many visited the wharf in the hope of
seeing the horses and mules of the Fourth
Cavalry hoisted aboard, but were dls
appointed, as they will not be brought
down until Tuesday. A detachment of
the Fourth Cavalry, in command of Lieu
tenant G. H. Cameron, wfll accompany j
the expedition. Thirty escort wagons and
fourteen Red Cross ambulances will also
be taken to Manila. Henry P. Ford, of
the quartermasters' department, will have
charge and will be assisted by fifteen !
men. Dr. A. Plummor. veterinary of the
Fourth Cavalry, will accompany the ex
pedition and look after the ailments ''of j
the 120 mules and ninety horses. â 
Officers T. P. Ellis and L. Shaw of the
harb6r police, captured John Tiernry and '
John Plckett. notorious pickpockets, who
were about to join an excursion venter- ,
day for the purpose of plying their nefarl- j
otis calling. The men were in company j
with two other equally well-known "lift
ers" when the police recognized them. \
Believing that matiy In the excursion
would mourn the loss of valuables if the
men were allowed to accompany them,
the police decided fo act quickly. Two I
officers were stationed at the exits to the ]
depot, while Ellis and Show boldly step- !
ped in view. The wary thieves watched',
thf plan of campaign and began search- ,
Ing for avenues of .escape. Before Plekett
and Tierney could lorp themselves in the
crowd, the officers were upon them and .
they were taken into custody. "Thelr^oom- |
panions were more fortunate and eluded
their pursuers. : . â â¢ â  '

people of intelligence. The growth of

A condition, somewhat unique, exists
at Pinole, whore explosions occur period
ically. The people oi the town live in an
atmosphere of fear and anticipation, but
among the older members this changes
in time to indifference, and in some in
stances to a belief in fatalism.
It is ' expected that sooner or later
death will come to all who make their
daily bread in the powder works, and
this- idea has been nurtured for a gen
eration. Each employe considers that he
knows as much about the dangers of the
place as his employers, â and tnis feeling
of pride is so marked that when he is
killed his relatives never dream of bring
ing i-uit for damage.
â With one word they say, "It was a
pure accident. He knew everything 1 about
powder, and his time had come, nobody
is to blame." . This was very definitely
proved at the inquest yesterday. Out

PrinciDQls in the GuardianshiD Case of Darrell Orth, Who Once Were Friends,
hut Are Now Arraued Audinst One Another,
The care of the guardianship of little Darrell Orth comes up this afternoon in Judge Hall's court, Oakland.
The most serious allegation* have been made on both sides and the session of court promises to be an Interest
ing one. A larjre batch of subpenas have been issued and many well-known Alameda woman suffragist 3 have been
called as witnesses.
Mrs. S. C. Sanford secretary of the Oakland Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to AnimalÃ, and who at
present has several wards under charge, and Mrs. Prescott. secretary of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children, have already entered into a wordy war over the matter. Mrs. Prescott claims that Mrs. Sanford has
threatened her life. Mrs. Sanford stated last night that she never used disrespectful language toward Mrs. Pres
eott, although she admits that she did say onco in reference to Mrs. Preecott, "Give her a rope and she will
hang herself." "I don't claim to be a saint," said Mrs. Sanford last night, "but Mrs. Prescott has been very
trying and insolent. I have broken down in health and my physician has advised mo to resign my position. I will
still continue secretary of the Socioty for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals."
Some time ago Mrs. Presoott and Mrs. Sanford were tho best of friends, so much so that Mrs. Sanford as
sisted her friend to gala the position she now occupies. In May, ISS6, a quarrel arose, and ever since that time
there has been a bitter feeling between the rival secretaries.
time the doctor speaks he says something
that lie has to spend a week in explaining,
and now that he has had his name before

KEEP THE WELL, WELL.
suspect that I may attribute my recent headache* to
/doina^o much nlght-wo*k of late," said a lady who earns net
own living. "I had an order to address a large number of en-
velopes and as 1 was paid by the thousand and others wanted
the work fc too, I sat up pretty late and perhaps worked in a room
not ao ni& ventilate^ as it might be. As a consequence I have
â nvore than once had a headache the next day. I have found,
however, that if I swallow a Ripans Tabule just a3 soon as I
tare premonition of the trouble, it staves It off and 1 escape
$cot free. That is why I say that Ripans Tabules are a medicine
toy wÂ«U people, for I am certainly a healthy woman, but I use the
Yabuies now and then and would not like to be without them."

afternoon and were witnesses of a frame
of baseball which was full of everything
save base hits.
I allude to the performance as a part
of the national game. but. to concede
nothing.. It resembled a-, game of "duek
on-the-rock," a primeval pastime handed
down to us.;. '*â¢.-.
If 1 remember correctly, â  and the
chances are against me, after sitting
through that contest without an inter
preter, the workers about the Tower of
Babel were, struck with the use of dif
ferent tongues. ,'â  '.' - ' "'-.'. : 'â  .:
So it was yesterday afternoon. Every
player. including the umpire, seemed ; to
speak a different language, and in con
sequence there was a misunderstanding
through the entire complication.
Now, if those players were civilized.
the game, despite its many misplays,
would have been interesting, but when a
collection of savages get together repre
senting different tribes,. trouble is certain
to ensue, and yesterday -was no exception.
My! bow they did try to make each
other understood. It was useless, how
ever. The umpire could articulate in an
unmistakable manner, as was evident
â when he told Mr. Apolugizer Stanley to
catch the game, and he would do the
umpiring, see?
The "see" was an expression used, no
doubt, to convey the fact that the gen
tleman was in earnest. The players, how
ever, made use of expressions foreign to
the ear of said Mr. Sweeney, and for
stretches of ten or teen minutes they
were compelled to lounge around until
this same Sweeney, through the assis
tance of President Bert, Mr. Raver, the
official scorer, the combined . talent in
the press box. Jack Gleason. Rube Levy,
the bar tendersand bus drivers, who
â were admitted for half price, enlightened
him, and I tell you his strategy board is
"very much" when in full session.
After this enlightening process ; would
cease, the game would proceed for . a
period, and the this fellow Sweeney
would call some one out. The moment
the strategy board heard this, a rush for
the stairs leading to the intelligent bu
reau would follow. This to be prepared
for the coming emergency. Some player,
usually a Gilt Edger. would take excep
tion to this "out" proposition, and then
all hands would argue their way toward
the position taken up by the previously
mentioned emergency . bunch. Af
ter a lapse of the usual fifteen minutes,
hotstllities in a baseball sense, would be
resumed.
So it was all through the game. No
body seemed to understand, and after
two hours wrangling the Athlestics fi
nally won the game. They deserve the
victory, for they said but little, ami com
bined this prudence with the art of mak
ing runs, when your opponents are mak
ing errors and misplays. I will be with
you again on Thursday. The score fol
lows.

SAN JOSE, July 31.â The game at Cy
clers' Park this aftenoon between the San
Francisco and San Jose teams was om 1 i
of the finest exhibitions of the national I

perb. Neither side scored till the first
half of the ninth, when with the cushions i
full Krug fumbled a hot drive of Blockers
Hanley, allowing McCarthy and Brock
off to score. San Francisco failed to score
in its half, thus .allowing San . Jose to

NEWLANDS DOES NOT
FAVOR ACQUISITION
HE IS AGAINST HOLDING THE
PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.
The Congresman Speaks of the Ills
and the Benefits oi Territo
rial Expansion.
Francis G. Newlands, Congressman for
Nevada, arrived Saturday morning from
Washington. When seen at the Palace ;
Hotel last night he said: "The trade j
benefits to be deri% r ed from the acqulsi- â 
tion of the Philippines are inestimable.
Opposite us are countries which have i
two-thirds of the population of the world,
and the possibilities of commerce between I
our people and these same foreign coun
tries are enormous. The advantages I
which would accrue to us from the pos- !
session of a naval station in the Philip
pines art also great, but I do not think i
that all these possible benefits would bal- ;
ancfi the evils that the holding of the !
Philippines would entail upon us. Tne
possession of a naval station in this
group of islands, where our ships may !
coal, is the safest solution of the Philip- '
pine problem. If we held the islands we
should be forced into complications of a j
: very serious nature, both domestic and
foreign. Of course, we have to face a ]
moral responsibility in regard to the in- |
habitants of the Philippines. It Is a j
question whether we would be justified in i
restoring the islands to Spanish misgov- !
ernment and Spanish misrule, and this !
Is a problem which must be met squarely
and unequivocally before a final conclu- |
sfon is reached. I think, therefore, the
administration is wise in testing the pub- i
lie sentiment on this question before !
coming to a decision.
"In regard to the Hawaiian Islands, the !
natural opposition to territorial aggran- j
dizement and to the violation of the pol- j
Icy which this Government has so long >
: practiced does not apply. The acquisi- j
tlon of the Hawaiian Islands means a de- i
I f"nse of what we have. The acquisition i
! of the Philippines means conquest and 'â 
I territorial expansion.
"A Government that reaches out its
i arm must be very strong at the center.
I This acquisition of large foreign territory
will bring about increased centralization
' of power. I am of the opinion that it would j
be well to throw, open to general discus- j
sion the question of the wisdom of the |
acquisition of the Philippines before
' final jud ,ment is passed. As I under
stand it the administration Is now sound
ing the country at large; yet it is true
that there seems to be a leaning toward
an abandonment of the idea of acquiring
possession of all the Philippines. The
least that will be accepted will be a naval
' station and perhaps thf> island which em
braces it. The acquisition of Luzon and
i Manila would be a compromise that ought
i to be acceptable.
"In the House the sentiment for colo
nial expansion seems to be growing, al
though the Democrats are ranging them
selves against It."

JESUITS HONOR
IGNATIUS LOYOLA
ANNUAL FEAST DAY OF THE
PATRONA3L SAINT.
An Eloquent Panegyric Pronounced
on the Life of the Founder of
the Society of Jesus.
The Feast of St. Ignatius of Loyola,
the patron saint and founder of the So
ciety of Jesuits, was solemnly commem
morated at St. Ignatius Church yester
day morning and evening. Solemn high
mass was celebrated at 10:S0 o'clock in
the morning and solemn high vespers in
the evening. The celebrant of the mass
was the Rev. J. P. Freiden, superior of
the Jesuit order on the coast, who was
assisted by the Rev. J. Sardi as deacon,
and Mr. Carroll, a scholastic, as BUb
deacon. An eloquent panegyric on the
life and work of Ignatius Loyola was de
livered by the Rev. D. Mahoney. In the
life sketch that the preacher placed
vividly before the immense congregation
of the great soldier among men, many
lessons were cited and a picture drawn
of the lnutility of earthly honors aa
placed" against and in contrast to the
great rewards of the Redeemer. The
noble Felf-sacrlfice of the saint was ex
tolled and his noble career both in the
church and in the world honored.
In the expansion of the thought of self
sacrifice suggested by the life of Loyola
the preacher touched upon the organiza
tion which he founded and which, ever
since, has been the great church mili
tant of Catholicism. "When ignorance
and barbarity threatened to crush civili
zation and the church the members of
the organization toiled and succeeded in
carrying it safe beyond the limits of per
secution and oppression. In all parts of
the earth, both barbarous and civilized.
Jesuitism is laboring to lift men from the
mire of iemorance by teaching them theTr
duty to God, to the church and to them-
Immediatoly after the celebration of
mass benediction of the blessed sacra
ment was solemnized and a ble=sing pro
nounced by the officiating priest.
In the evening an interesting and elo
quent lecture was delivered by the Rev.
Father Moeller upon the life of Loyola
and the lessons to be learned from his
career both as a soldier of the world and
a soldier of the church.
The music of the occasion was specially
arranged and chanted by an augmented
choir of over fifty voices. The mass was
by Bertlnl.

THE MISSING
PAPERS APPEAR
MYSTERIOUSLY
The Documents in the Becker-
Creegan Forgery Case Bob
Up From the Void.
Found in a Safe Where They Did Not Be
long and No Reason Given of How
They Got There.
Tho indictment, the Judgment roll and
the other papers In the Becker-Creegan
forgery case that mysteriously disap
peared from the office of the County
Clerk, just as mysteriously reappeared in
the custody of the city official yesterday.
The papers were found to be missing on
Saturday morning and all that day nearly
the entire force of tho County Clerk was
engaged in the search for them. The ut
most efforts were made to keep the fact
that the papers had gone from becoming
public, but The Call yesterday announced
the fact that they had disappeared. Chief
Lees was worried over the failure to tind
the papers in tho custody of the County
Clerk. He believed ho had been outwitted
by tho gang of forgers and that there was
a clear way for the men he is holding in
custody to regain their liberty.
It was the plan of Dean, one of the
forgers who is being held as a witness
against Becker and Creegan, to apply for
a writ of habeas corpus to-day, hoping to
secure his release. Now that the papers
are found it is not known whether that
plan will be changed or not. With the
documents missing, it would be an easy
matter for him to secure his freedom.
With Dean out of the way there would be
â nothing in the road of securing a dismis
sal of Becker and Creegan, the two prln-^
cip&ls in the forgery- case.
About two years ago a "raised" draft
on the Nevada Bank was cashed by the
Crocker-Woolworth National Bank and
the forgers cleared $22,000 by the deal.
They immediately went East, but they
â were apprehended and brought back.
Becker and Creegan were the principals
In the crime and two others named Dean
and McClusky were used by them as stool
pigeons to resist in working the forged
paper through the banks. The forgers
â¢were exceedingly clever in their work, and
â¢when caught the police could find but lit
tle evidence against them, and certainly
not enough to convict all four. Chief Leea
promised McClusky and Dean their lib
erty if they would testify against tl.-ir
comrades, Becker and Creegan. The offer
was accepted and at the trial the two
principals were convicted. MeClusky had
little to offer in the way of evidence, and
as he played only a small part in the forg
ery he was allowed to go after the trial.
The convicted men gave notice of appeal
and Dean, who was an important witness
and who was closely identified with the
principals in the case, way held as a wit
ness in case his testimony should again be
needed, at the same time consenting to re
main in confinement providing no charge
should be preferred agalrat him after the
nnal disposal of the cases against Becker
and Creegan.
A few days ago the Supreme Court
granted the two convicted men a new
trial on the ground that the lower court
had erred in admitting the evidence of
MeClueky and Dean for tne prosecution.
the court holding that the two witnesses
were accomplices in the crime. Accord
ing to the decision of the higher court it
looked like smooth sailing for the two
convicted men regaining their liberty.
The evidence of Dean was all that could
convict them and there remained some
chance of a legal technicality being found
by which it could be admitted. To make
liberty sure Dean must be got beyond
the reach of the court. It was planned
that to-day his attorney would ask the
court for a writ of habeas corpus for his
release from custody on the ground that
there was no reason for holding him in
t^ison. With the disappearance of the
papers in tho forgery case nothing could
be brought before the court to show why
he was kept in custody. His release from
Chief Lees' grasp would naturally follow
and at the coming new trial of the prin
cipals in the forgery they would secure
their acquittal lor the want of evidence.
Becker, the alleged leader of the gang
of forgers, had at tho time of his arrest a
good bank account and he boasted that if
money could secure his release and that
of his comrades they would never serve a
term in prison.
How the papers disappeared from their
proper place in the County Clerk's office
Is not known and perhaps it will never be
known. Deputy Mulcahy, who has charge
of the papers of the criminal cases, has
in the many years he has been in the
service of the city in clerical positions at
the city hall proven himself a trust
worthy man, but there are many who
have acwss to the documents llled with
him through the non -observance of the
rules and code of discipline of the office
â where he is employed. The records show
that the papers were properly filed with
him and that they were put in their
proper place according to the system of
the office. When thejr were taken from
that place, perhaps only one or two can
tell. They were, missed on Saturday,
â when it was hinted that the attorneys for

of habeas corpus on behalf of their client
with a hope of securing his release. Then
It was found that they were gone. A
year and a half had elapsed since they
were first put with the records of the

NEW "JACK THE KISSER."
F, W, Lealand, a Grand Armu Vet- â 
eran, Arrested on a Charge â 
of Insanity. â¢ :
F\Y. LEALAND, who has pained for himself the sobriquet of "Jack
the Kisser," on account of hia penchant for kissing unprotected
women, was arrested yesterday and locked up In a padded cell in the
Receiving Hospital pending an examination as to his sanity.
Several days ago Lealand was arrested on a similar charge, but as
his friends promised to take caro of him he was released.
Shortly after 11 o'clock yesterday morning Lealand, who claims to be a
Grand Army veteran, stood in front of a church on Sixteenth street and
attempted to kiss several women who were emerging from the house of
worship. Realizing he was insane, one of the women notified Police Offi
cer Winger of the Seventeenth-street station, who placed Lealand under ar
rest. He offered no objection and was at once taken to the Receiving Hos
pital.
To Superintendent Fishthaler, Lealand declared that ho had been bur
led with Gladstone, the English statesman, but being charged with elec
tricity he experienced little difficulty In escaping.
"I did not like it underground," he remarked, "and as Gladstone did
not feel lonesome I concluded to leave him. After emerging from the
grave, in which rested the remains of my old friend and companion, I went
to Ijondon and from there to this city, making the trip in exactly three
minutes."
When asked whero he lived Lea'and replied that his home Is In
heaven.
"I have been granted a leave of absence," he remarked, *â¢ but as the
time is about up I Intend to return to-morrow."
L^aland says he Is acquainted with all the dignitaries of Europo and
threatens to invoke their aid In compelling the hospital authorities to re
lease Him. To-day, he will be taken before the Commissioners of Lunacy.

H. C. Van Voorhles, representative in
the House of Congress for Ohio, arrived
last night, accompanied by his wife. Mr.
Van Voorhies is here for pleasure and
rest. He said last night at the Palaco:
"I left the cares of business behind me
when I started West. I did not think 1
would reach as far West as San Fran
cisco at the beginning of the trip, but
here we are. The principal reason of this
trip across the continent was to ~'~* my
son, who is a captain of volunteers sta
tioned at Camp Merritt.
"I see that the political campaign is a
warm one in the State and that Maguire
is a candidate for the gubernatorial chair.
I hardly think there is a chance for a
Democratic candidate this year. Every
thing points toward the complete {success
of the party now in administration of
national affairs."
Relierious Lecture on the War.
The Ilev. W. A. Waterman of rhirapro
occupied the pulpit of the Third Cdngre-
I gational Church last night and delivered
i his celebrated lecture on "The Hand of
! God in the Military History of the United
States."
The lecturer devoted most of his time
to a recital of Spain's connection with the
history oil the Western. Hemisphere, be
ginning with the discovery of this country
in 1492 and coming down to tne present
time. Of the latter period he said: "This
war between Spain and the United States
i will break the present dynasty of Spain
i and weaken every throne on earth. This
war was planned in heaven; we waged it,
not for the acquisition of territory or the
subjugation of a nation or man, but to
i life up the oppressed and bring upon the
I home and lire of the helpless the sun-
I shine of a better day."

SUDDEN DEATH OF "DICK" BALLINGER.
Popular Club Man Succumbs to an Attack of Acute
Appendicitisâ Mourned bu a Host of
Friends,
Thomas R. Ballinger. popularly known by hosts of friends as "Dick"
Balllneer p:>ssed away at St. Luke's Hospital yesterday afternoon. His
death was sudden and unexpected, the result, it is thought, of that dread
ally of the "reaper," acute appendicitis, A week ago decedent was at his
desk at the headquarters of tho Grangers' Business Association cheerlul
and uncomplaining.
One day he did not appear at his desk and Inquiry elicited the fact
that he was ill at his home. 224 Twelfth street, a sufferer, it was then
supposed, from a slight inflammation of the bowels. This, however, w.i>
an error' as subsequent developments proved. After but a few days' ill
ness the' patient's condition became alarming. Physicians consulted over
his case and diagnosed tho malady of which ho was a victim as appen-
As the disease refused to yield to treatment it was decided Saturday
that an operation must of necessity bo performed. Saturday evening
the condition of the sufferer was somewhat improved, and yesterday
morning it was thought advisable to move him to St. Luke's Hospital,
where, better facilities for performing the operation could bo enjoyed.
The trip was begun without Incident, but at the end the patient was much
weaker. Mr. Ballinger was carried to a cot in a sinking condition. It WBB
thought that the patient would rally sufficiently for the operation, but
it was not to be and while his friends and physicians worked over him
he breathed his last. Tho body was removed to his late home and there
many of his friends gathered to look upon the face of the dead. The
suddenness of his taking off was a great shock to many of his most in
timate companions and a feeling of gloom pervades all circles wherein
he was known. Ho was prominently identified with the Olympic and
other clubs of this city, but those who will miss his companlonsh.p m >st
are William Kennedy, George. McCord, John Layton and Dr. E. N. Short,
who, together with decedent, composed a little fraternal organ. zatiou
which they dubbed the "Club of Capisonious." Many a Jolly exenlng
baa seen them together in their rooms, but one chair is now vacant, that
of "Dick" Ballinger.
PHILIPPINE ISLANDS
MUST BE RETAINED
BOARD OF TRADE STANDS WITH
THE OTHER BODIES.
Course of the Commercial Organiza
tions Heartily Approved by
the People of the
Coast.
There is no abatement in the movement
to have the United States retain the Phil
ippine Islands by the people of this local
ity and entire Coast for that matter. On
Friday a joint meeting of the Chamber of
Commerce, Manufacturers and Producers'
Association and Merchants' Association
held and resulted in one of the
strongest memorials ever sent from the
I'ariiic Coast being telegraphed to Pres
ident MoKlnley, urging him to retain the
islands in the far Ka.st that Dewey so gal
lantly took away from the Spanish. The
argunn nt is 'hat if to the victors belong
the spoils there Is no reason why Uncle
Sam should give back to Spain that which
has cost good American Dlood and mil
llcna of dollars to secure. Not only aro
the business men of San Francisco urging
that the islands be retained, but the com
mercial bodies of all the other large cities
along the Coast are deeply interested to
the same end. The action of the organ
izations mentioned has been heartily in
dorsed, as shown by letters and telegrams
receleved Saturday by President Hugh
Craig, of which the following are sam
ples:
Hugh Craigâ Dear Sir: If the San Francisco
rhnmlier of Commerce makes any expression of
opinion In relation to peace with Spain, don't
forget that In any event we must retain the
I.ii'lrones and Carolines, as they are stepping
stones on the way east. Germany has already
sent a cruiser to the Carolines, and as she has
the Marshall group next east of the Carolines,
her liclnnÃ fingers are ready for any deviltry.
Soutt truly, W. F. HERRICK.
1302 Twelfth street, Oakland.
PORTLAND, Or., July 29.
Hufrh Craig: Chamber met to-day, adopted
resolutions and -wired same to President In ac
cordance with your suggestions.
"\V. B. MASON, President.
The California State Board of T^de,
representing everj' section of CalifqMia,
is not behind in this respect, but llKdi
rectors were not able to assemble atJKnrt
notice as many live some distance^Brom
the city. At first it was thought heir to
briny up the subject at the monthly meet
ing, 'which will be held next Tuesday, but
aa peace negotiations and the future of
the Philippines an- now Being considered
by President MeKlnley and his Cabinet,
it was thought best not to delay the mat
ter any longer.
Yesterday President N. p.Chlpman made
up his mind to call a special meeting of the
Hoard of Trade to frame a resolution on
similar lines to that sent by all of the
other commercial and industrial bodies of
the Coast. The meeting will be held to
morrow at 2 o'clock at the Mechanics'
Pavilion. It is well known that General
Chipman is strong for annexation. Shortly
after the magnificent victory of Admlrnl
i.i '. v.-. v in Manila Bay the people of G<-ri
eral Chlpman's home were holding a cele
bration in honor of the occasion, and the
Gem-ral made a few remarks. In his
speech he stated that he was firmly of
the belief that the islands In question
should never be allowed to go back under
Spanish rule, or worse, be ,?iven over into
the hands of a horde of semi-savages.
VACATION IS OVEB.
Considerable Confusion Expected at
the Reopening of the Schools
To-Day.
The city schools reopen this morning,
and more than the usual incidental con
fusion which follows the reorganization
of the classes after a vacation is expectci
by the Board of Education and the teach
ers. It is impossible to estimate how
many thousand children will apply for
admission to the schools, but it is known
that the number will exceed any previous
year. Considerable trouble la anticipated
in the Richmond District, where the
school rooms are wholly inadequate to
accommodate the classes. The same con
dition also exists in the Mission.
At the Dudley Stone school, near the
Park, there will be 500 children awalnting
the opening. Only eight rooms are in
there will oe 500 children awaiting the
opening. There are only eight rooms In
the building, and President Barrington of
the Board of Education says that outside
apartments must be secured before all
the children can be enrolled.
At the last meeting of the Board of Ed
ucation all vacancies among the teachers
were filled and all necessary transfers
arranged so that the work of organizing
the classes could proceed as expedltiously
ac possible. No change has been made in
the several -courses of study, and the
same text books as those used last year
will again be employed.
Probably the neatest growth la the
number of pupils has been in the Noe
Valley Primary school. A yc-ar ago when
the school opened there wan only one
class, and when it closed there were six.
Two or three new ones will now have to
be organized. The classes will hay* to
be scattered all over the district, as there
is no school building in which to teaÂ«h
them. Th*Â». Mission High school opens
to-day, although the building is only par
tially completed.

HORSES SHOD IN SEVENTEEN MINUTES.
Some of the Features of the Shoeing Tournament and
Terrier Races at Central Park,
f^i ENTRALi PARK looked like old times
I again yesterday, big men, small
I boys, policemen, horses and dogs
forming a good-natured but noisy
crowd. A number of people under the
name of the Mechanics' Athletic Union
have undertaken the furnish the pub
lic with amusement a little out of
the ordinary run and properly call
ed industrial sports. A brass band
drew a crowd of several hundred specta
tors, all of whom expected to witness
something out of the common. The prin
cipal event was a horseshoeing contest
for a prize of $150. In Australia and New
Zealand these contests are held frequent
ly, but this was the first time one has
been held in this country. It is something
after the order of shaving contests, only
in this the horse is the victim. The con
testants, provided with forges, hammers,
tongs, rasps, and all of the other imple
ments of a blacksmith shop, make tho
shoes from the bar iron and attach the
new footgear to the animals' boofs. The
two points of the Job are quickness and
neatness, and the contestants are allowed
two helpers and a boy to work tho forge.
It took some time to get the contest start
ed, but when all was ready Referee
Thomas Carroll announced that John
O'Rourke, T. F. Magee and J. Do ran had
been selected to Jtidge and C. S. Critten
den, the stakeholder, would officiate as
time-keeper.
DISGRACE
FOLLOWS
DISMISSAL
Employes at Agnews
Figure in a Divorce.
SUIT WILL BEGIN TO-DAY
CO-RESPONDENTS IN A CHARGE
OF INFIDELITY.
Names of Mina White, Lena Chap
lain and Ella Royce Again
Brought Before the
Public.
One of the most sensational divorce
suits of the year will be commenced In
Judge Hebbards court this morning by
Amelia Inguglia against her husband,
John B. Ingiiglla, on the grounds of In
fidelity. The action Involves Misses Mina
White, Lena Chaplain and Ellen Royce,
the two latter being named as the chief
co-respondents In the complaint.
In the Agnews Insane Asylum scandal,
it will be remembered, Miss Chaplain and
Miss Royce were recently discharged
from the Institution for improper conduct.
Ever since they were compelled to leave
the institution they have exerted every
effort to be reinstated on a plea of inno
cence, which they maintained they could
prove beyond a doubt to both the satis
faction of the directors of the institution
and the general public.
The story that Amelia Inguglia tells Is
an Interesting one. She claims that her
husband had been keeping company with
tho women mentioned in the complaint
for several months prior to the time she
became aware of the fact. He would
make supposed visits frequently to San
Jm.^.', when in fact he was in the city m
company with one of the three *pmen
mentioned. He would absent himselt in
this way for several days at a time. The
wife's suspicions were aroused, however,
when crossing over on the ferry boat from
Oakland to the city some time prior to
the tiling of the complaint, she noticed
her husband's head nestled in the lap or
an unknown woman. .â¢â¢â¢â 'â , Â
She said nothing at the time, but re
solved to wait for an opportune moment
when she could place the evidence of In
fidelity plainly before her unfaithful hus
band. Mrs. lnguglia upbraided her hus
band for his conduct on the evening men
tioned and he rebelled on the ground that
he was younger than she and of course
could not be expected to know as much
of worldly things and the ways of the
world us his better-half.
This episode did little toward encour
aging lnguglia to tread the path of vir
tue, lie longed for feminine company
outside his own domicile and sought to
enjoy it by making the White, Chaplain
and "Royce women substitutes for the un
congenial company ot his wife.
He represented to these women that
ho was a millionaire and cared nothing
for the minted metal which he allowed,
under their careful direction, to flow in
a steady stream for their pleasure while
his wife was In want at home.
The moment a man takes to evil ways
on the tenderloin he becomes immediate
ly known; and his reputation for a good
jolly fellow spreads like wildfire among
Its denizens. lnguglia won this reputa
tion but failed to keep It confined in tho
district where it was gained. His wife
knew of It, and before long was a wit
ness to his wild conduct.
Hoping to meet her husband and at
tempt to persuade him to forsake the life
he was leading, she wandered Into his
usual haunts and awaited his coming.
The position she occupied was opposite
ttw William Tell House. Not caring to
I gain any unpleasant notoriety by stand-
Ing there subjected to the continual gaze
of passers-by, she applied for permission
to take a position in the upper part of a
Livery stable, from which she could have
a full and unobstructed view of the^street
and hotel. Mrs. lnguglia had hardly
gained tho window when she noticed a
couple walking down the opposite side of
the street arm in arm.
The lirst casual look sufficed to con
vince her that it was her husband in
company with an unknown woman. They
entered the William Tell House and pres
ent lv appeared in apartments above,
where by the Msht in the room the wife
Identified the unknown woman as Ella
The first "heat" was by James
O'Rourke and Henry Gerlach. The latter
led off with a steady pace and sparks
were soon flying from the hot iron. His
opponent did not seem to be at his best,
for lit; frequently dropped his tools, but
somehow he had his four shoes made first.
\\'\y- helper strained every muscle to get
them lirst, and did. so far as time was
concerned, finishing the job in 24 minutes
and S2 seconds. Gerlach was two seconds
behind, but he was pronounced winner, as
his horse was more neatly shod and the
shoos were better made. The second heat
was, between Thomas Tlerney and Frank
O'Rourke. The latter won, time 17 min
utes and 46 seconds. Tierney's time was
18:10. O'Rourke was pronounced winner,
on the score of neatness and dispatch.
Next Sunday the winners will shoe
against each other, and the lowers will
compete. H. J. Winters of Sacramento
lias Issued a challenge to the winner oÂ£
the event next Sunday.
Between these events a novel amuse
ment was introduced in the shape of fox
terrier doff races. In the center of the lot
an apparatus that resembles a large
freight crane "with a long light bavnboo
arm counterbalanced with a weight, is
placed. The end of the arm is directly
over the path in which the little dogs run.
The canines are induced to exert them
selves on the track by the appearance of a
couple of fats in a wire cage, which ars
swung around in a circle a few inches
above the track. Several amusing exhi
bitions were given and next Sunday prized
will be given, for the winners in actual
contests.
