Government of Madrid Considers
That the President's Ultima

Copyrighted, 1898. by James Gordon Bennett,
MADRID, April 21.â At last the
varying phases of the Cuban question
ha-ve been merged into a concrete is
sue, with war as the arbiter. Even
those who most dreaded such a solv
ing of the problem are glad that the
strain is over, that there is no more
hesitation possible, and that, in fact,
the ball has been set rolling.
â  The Spanish Government has brok
pn off diplomatic relations with the
United States. For the last couple
of days there has been a noticeable
feeling of restlessness, and even some
little irritation, over the continued
stay in Madrid of General Woodford.
' As I told you last night, the Span
ish' Government had firmly decided
to receive no ultimatum. One Minis
ter said to me that it was an insult
fox any nation to demand from an
other the performance within forty
eight hours of a physically impossi
ble task, namely, the withdrawal of
her huge military and naval forces
from any point, so they determined
to avoid the necessity for a reply by
refusing further communication with
the United States, and, as it was cer
tain General Woodford would carry
out his instructions to the letter, a
sort of deadlock began to be feared. :
The most serious questions that
could possibly confront the country
even threatened to take on a faintly
grotesque aspect, and the presenta- >
tion of the ultimatum- to degenerate i
into a process resembling the serv- !
ing of a writ on the Government. ;
An intimation was conveyed to uen
eral Woodford that negotiations were |
at an end between the two countries
when Senor Moret called upon him
to bid him adieu.
When this somewhat broad hint j
had no effect they were quite non- |
plussed Finally, last night, shortly
before the arrival of the cable mes
sage to General Woodford from Pres
ident McKinley containing the ulti- J
matum, the Cabinet dispatched a j
note to the United States Minister j
officially informing him that diplo- \
matic relations were broken off, and j
that no fui - ther communications were I

ST. VINCENT, Cape Verde
Islands, April 21.â The Spanish
cruisers, together with the torpe

wont out from here yesterday,
are again In port. The vessels
are preparing to leave at a mo
ment's notice, their fires being
banked. The commander of the

situation which was rapidly becom
ing strained to the danger point.
With the going away of General
Woodford all lethargy has left the
people. War specials are being cried
in the streets. All the talk is war,
every one is wondering where the
first blow will be struck, and by
whom.
It seems certain that Spain will
leave all initiative to the United
States. . At the same time, all troops
are being called out and massed at
various points of the peninsula. Next
week, at the very latest, large re
inforcements will be dispatched to '
Porto Rico. In fact, a battalion ; has !
already been sent from Cuba to Porto !

General Woodford left Madrid this

An immense crowd gathered at the

THE ULTIMATUM
THAT SPAIN DID
NOT RECEIVE
Woodford Given His Passports
Before He Could Deliver Pres-
ident McKinley's Note.
WASHINGTON, April 21.â The following statement of the text of the
ultimatum to Spain was issued to-day:
Yesterday, April 20, 1898, about 11 o'clock, the Department of State
served notice of the purposes of this Government by delivering to Minister
Polo do Bernabe a copy of an instruction sent to Minister Woodford and also
a copy of the resolutions passed by the Congress of the United States on
the 19th instant. After the receipt of this notice the Spanish Minister for
warded to the State Department a request for his passports, which were fur
nished to him yesterday afternoon. A copy of the instruction to Woodford is
herewith appended.
" Woodford, Minister, Madrid â You have been furnished with the text
of a joint resolution voted by the Congress of the United States on the 19th
instant â approved to-day â in relation to the pacification of the island of
Cuba. In obedience to that act the President directs you to immediately
communicate to the Government of Spain said resolution with the formal de
mand upon the Government of Spain to at once relinquish its authority and
government in the island of Cuba and withdraw its land and naval forces
from Cuba and Cuban waters.
"In taking this step the United States hereby disc/aims any disposition or
intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction or control over the island, except
for the pacification thereof, and asserts its determination when that is ac
complished to leave the government and control of the island to its people
under such free and independent government as they may establish.
"If by the hour of noon on Saturday next, the 23d day of April instant,
there be not communicated to this Government by the Government of Spain a
full and satisfactory response to this demand and resolution, whereby the
ends of peace in Cuba shall be assured, the President will proceed without
further notice to use the power and authority enjoined and conferred upon
him by the said joint resolution to such an extent as may be necessary to
carry the same into effect. S HER MA N."
The following is the dispatch received by the State Department from
H/limister Wood ford:
"MADRID, April 21, 1898.â Sherman, Washingtonâ Early this morn
ing, immediately after the receipt of your telegram, and before I had com
municate ' the same to the Spanish Government, the Spanish Minister for
Foreign A fairs notified me thai diplomatic relations are broken between the
two i.tun ries and that all official communications between their respective
representatives have ceased. I accordingly asked for safe passports, turned
the legation over to the British Embassy and leave for Paris this afternoon.
Have notified all Consuls. WOODFORD."

In conclusion, the Correspondencia
expresses confidence in the eventual
triumph of justice.

MADRID, April 21.â The following is the text of the
note received this morning by General Woodford from
Secretary Gullon, Minister of Foreign AFfairs :
"Dear Sir: In compliance with a painful duty, I have
the honor to inform you that there has been sanctioned
by the President of the republic a resolution of both
chambers of the United States which denies the legiti
mate sovereignty of Spain and threatens armed interven
tion in Cuba, which is equivalent to a declaration of war.
The Government of her Majesty has ordered her Minister
to return without loss of time from North American terri-
Tory, together with all the personnel of the legation.
"By this act the diplomatic relations heretofore exist
ing between the two countries and all of the negotiations
between their respective representatives cease.
"I am obliged thus to inform you, so that you may
make such arrangements as you think fit. I beg your
excellency to acknowledge receipt of this note at such
time as you deem proper, taking this opportunity to
reiterate to you the assurances of my distinguished
consideration. P. GULLON."
NEW YORK, April 2iâ The

But while history

The peaceful blockade of

no one supposes for a moment

command of Rear Admiral
Sampson, now engaged in
blockading Havana harbor,
can remain in these waters an
hour without the first shot

conflict which may go down
to posterity as the greatest
sea battle of modern history.

SAILS TO-DAY
I FOR HAVANA
KEY WEST, April 21.â At 12
o'clock this noon the recall guns
boomed from the fleet, ordering
all the officers and men who
were ashore to rejoin their ships
forthwith. At nightfall, how
ever, there had been no move
ment of the fleet, and there is
not likely to be any before morn
ing, as the Cincinnati and Mar
blehead have been ordered to the
docks to take on coal and water.
April 22, 2:35 a, m.â The war
ships lying in the harbor are ap
parently drawing nearer the
flagship. Two are now moving
out. They are thought to be the
monitor Amphitrite and the gun
boat Helena. The signaling is
continuous and the searchlights
of the lowa and the New York
are industriously sweeping the
waters of the outer harbor.
The entire fleet will sail at
9 a. m.
naval strategists have come
to the front and will occupy
the field of speculation for fu
ture â how long no one can
tell.
Already they differ in their
views as to the duration of
the war. They all agree that
swift and vigorous will be the
stroke delivered by the Amer
ican navy to put an end to
Spanish misrule in Cuba. But
the loss of Cuba to Spain does
not mean an end of the war
with Spain. The members of

SCHLEY'S FLYING
SQUADRON HELD
READY TO SAIL
Steam Is K^ept Up and the Ships

Moment's Notice
Now.
OLD POINT COMFORT, Va., April 21. â In anticipation of orders
from Washington to put to sea before morning, the telegraph offices
here are being kept open all night for the first time since the flying
squadron has been in Hampton Roads. Commodore Schley has notified
the Government he is ready to move at a moment's notice, either by
day or night.
All the officers of the squadron were ordered on board at 10 o'clock
this morning. Many of them whose families are here have been living
on shore. Commodore Schley did not come ashore at all to-day or to
night. The engines on all the ships were coupled this afternoon and
everything is in readiness for immediate action. Among the officers on
shore to-day there was more serious demeanor than there has been at
any time heretofore. The news from Washington was discussed by
groups of officers in hotels and on wharves.
1 have talked with several officers regarding the Spanish fleet at
Cape Verde. I found some officers who expressed. the belief that the
Spanish might surprise us by striking very much further north than
has been anticipated as the battle ground, but none cared to allow their
names to be i:.-;ed in an interview.
Cuba. The real strength of
her navy will be kept far
away from Cuba and in posi
tions which will enable her
to prey upon- vulnerable
points along our coast and
upon our commerce, and thus
harass us in prolonging the
war indefinitely in retaliation
for forcing her out of Cuba.
The events of the day in
Washington and Madrid
which have severed diplom-
acy and culminated in war
will long be remembered in
the history of both countries.
Here, as in Madrid,
the war spirit is in
tense and every step
taken on both sides
has been for waging
war vigorously and
with all the forces at
the command of the
respective countries.
Up to this time nei=
ther country has made
a formal declaration
of war. Yet both coun
tries recognize that a
state of war exists.
When Minister Woodford
received his passports this
morning, before he had an
opportunity to present his
ultimatum demanding that
Spain pick up her goods and
chattels and leave Cuba, the
President considers that Spain
has flung down the gauntlet.
He promptly picked it up by
issuing orders for our military
and naval forces to begin op
erations for carrying out his
plans for intervention.
The proclamation which the Presi
dent will issue to-morrow, calling for
Volunteers, and the notification to for
eign powers of the existence of a block
ade of Havana harbor, will be evidence
enough that war is upon us.
If necessary, however, the Congress
Â»f the United States, which, under the
constitution, has the sole power of de
claring war, will within five minutes
after the first shot has been fired, pass 'â 
the required resolutions. Some of the \
members of the Foreign Relations
Committee with whom I talked to-day
said that this course would probably
be necessary to avoid any further com
plications with foreign powers in re
gard to neutrality.
The question of privateering also re
ceived some consideration by members
of the Foreign Relations Committee to
day. Generally Congress fully agrees
with the President that the policy of
this country should be against resort
to that form of legalized piracy.
If Spain shou 1 persist in pursuing '
warfare of this character, Congress i
may feel called upon later to exercise
any right granted by the constitution,
which permits the granting of letters
<>f marque and reprisals. The whole
tendency of both the administration
and Congress, however, is violently op
posed to anything of this kind, and
should Spain seek to prolong war by
engaging in it it is believed the prin
pical powers of Europe will combine to
prevent it, and that in this way Spain
may be forced to give up the fight after
we have ousted her from Cuba.
History was made at the White
Hou.se to-day with lightning-like ra
bidity. This has been one of the most
eventful days at the Executive Mansion
in the history o. this Government.
The first sensation of the day was the
announcement that the Spanish Gov
ernment had given our Minister, Wood
ford, at Madrid, his passports.
More startling ; nd at the same time
exasperating was the official statement
that Minister Woodford had received
his passports before he had an op
portunity to present to Sagasta the
President's ultimatum.
This information was delivered to the
President at 10 o'clock by Assistant
Secretary Day. When Judge Day ar
rived ther;> were present Senator Davis,
chairman of the Committee on Fon<jc:n
Affairs; Senator Lodge and Senator
Cullom of that committee, Senator Al
lison and Senator Platt of New York.
The conference did not last very long.

NOW RAGING IN
PORTO RICO
Foreigners Panic Stricken, as They
Expect Â£ln)ericao Bon)bard
mer)t and fire Afraid
to Retreat.
Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gordon Bennett.
ST. THOMAS, West Indies, April 21.â 8y advices just to hand from
the Herald's correspondent in tfan Juan, Porto Rico, I learn that a revo
lution has broken o-ut in the Ponce district and that there is rioting all
through the island. Residents of other countries now in Porto Rico are
panic-stricken. They feel that there is no safety in ports of the island,
as they are momentarily expecting bombardment by the American war
ships. This feeling is particularly strong in San Juan. But when the
question of going to the interior arises foreigners fa.cc a new danger â
that is, the rioters ihere. So far as I have been able to learn, rioting
is going on in many places.
An a-erent of the United States reached St. Thomas yesterday to buy
coal. To-day he started for the Windward Islands on the same mis
sion. A steamer which arrived here yesterday from Cardiff brought
3100 tons Of coal. On the steamer which is due from Philadelphia to
morrow I am told there are 4000 tons, the bulk of which is on the mar
ket. I understand that 1000 tons will go to Porto Rico.
tcr Woodford by giving him his pass- I
ports without permitting him to deliver
this country's ultimatum, Senator
Platt, in his quiet, easy style, related
the Bubstance of Minister Woodford's
dispatch with the same calmness he
would display in manipulating a Re
publican convention in the State of
New York. There was no trace of
anxiety or warlike indignation when
he remarked: "They have given Wood
ford his passports, which is practically
a declaration of war by Spain."
Senators Davis and Lodge confirmed
the statement of Platt, and Senator
Cullom, in a burst of indignation, de
clared: "This is another instance of
Spanish treachery which they will call
sharp diplomatic practice. It is as
much an insult to this Government as
if the Spanish Government had torn
down our Has and spit upon it. It can
not be regarded as anything else than
a declaration of war, and, for my part,
I think the time has come to teach her
that she cannot insult the United
States any further with impunity. I
fear we have been too poiite in our
dealings with Spain, and her conduct
toward Minister Woodford will con
vince even the most peacefully inclined
Americans that the hour for aggres
sive action has come."
It took but little time for the real
significance of the Spanish action to
become known abroad. At the White
House, at the State, War and Navy
Departments and throughout the city
generally the news spread like a prairie
fire before a windstorm. All of the
Senators and Representatives who saw
the President this morning concurred
in the opinion that Spain was guilty
of a direct insult to this Government
which could not be construed otherwise
than as a practical declaration of war.
The indignities heaped upon Minister
Woodford and the reported movement
of the Spanish squadron convinced the
President's advisers that the time for
retaliation had arrived. He was ad
vised to order our warshi>s to Havana
without further delay, and the Presi
dent, inspired by the consciousness of
the high duty devolved upon him, con
cluded to take that advice. He
promptly summoned the Secretary of
the Navy. Secretary Long hurried over
to the White House, accompanied by
his naval aid, Captain Barker. It was
decided that the situation warranted
the calling of a special Cabinet meet
ing, and messengers were dispatched
notifying the various Cabinet officers
that their presence was desired at the
White House at 1 o'clock. The text of
the ultimatum and the official state
ment from Woodford was promulgated
at the State Department.
Just before the special Cabinet meet
ing assembled the great surprise of the
day was announced. It was a break
in the Cabinet. Postmaster General
Gary, wirhout a suggestion or a word of
warning to the public, tendered his
resignation as a member of the Presi
dent's official family. The nomination
of Mr. Charles Emory Smith of Phila
delphia was sent to the Senate to fill
the vacancy.
The Cabinet was in session nearly
two hours. During its ser :ion General
Miles, commanding general of the
army, and Captain Crowninshield of
the navy, who is the actual command
ing officer of the naval forces, were
summoned to the White House. It was
decided that orders should be at once
issued to the fleet and to the land
forces.
The question whether a formal decla
ration of war by Congress was neces
sary- was fully considered. The general
opinion of the Cabinet was that the
Spanish had practically declared war
against the United States and there
fore this Government was released
from any friendly obligations to that
nation.
Secretary Alger stated after the Cabi
l net meeting that the action of Spain
! could not be regarded other than as
' a declaration of war, and he added: "I
; am going back to the War Department
' to Issue the necessary orders to employ
our land forces r ain's* Spain."
Secretary Long also regarded the ac
1 tion of the Spanish Government as a
i declaration of war and he stated that
! he would order the fleet at Key West to
move on Havana at once.
Judge Day W; a little more guarded

in hia statements and when asked to
define the st t s between the two Gov
ernments he rei ied: "While giving
Minister Woodford his passports under
the existir- circumstances is practical
ly a declar tion " war, yet diplomat
ically speaking war has not been offi
cially declared."
Resistance attempted by the Spanish
vessels now in Cuban and Porto Rican
waters to the blockade instituted by the
North American squadron will be fol
lowed by their destruction. Under in
stf'uctiens given him it will be the duty
of Ttear-Admiral Sampson, as he has
been officially designated, to capture
or destroy every ship Spain has in Cu
ban waters, and when ttiis nas been ac
complished to impose the blockade
contemplated by the Government plan
of campaign. Naturally it is not ex
pected that the execution of this in
struction will be performed without
damage to American vessels, and it is
anticipated by the officials that by to
morrow evening 1 reports will reach the
"department of engagements which
have been fought by American and
Spanish vessels. Although Spain has a
total of fifty-eight Fhins distributed in
Cuban and Porto Rican waters, no
doubt exists in official circles of the
ability of the North American squad
ron to easily destroy those which it
will meet in" the veicinity of Cuba.
Of the Spanish force, its largest
cruiser, the Alfonso XII, of 3900 tons
displacement, lies in a disabled condi
tion in Havana harbor, and it is ex
pected it will remain there until the
American flag displaces that of Spain.
Spain's next largest ship in Cuban
waters is the cruiser Relna Mercedes
of 3090 tons, built in 1887, which is re
guarded as a very good vessel of her
type. The only other ships which the
American men-of-war have to fear are
seven torpedo cruisers, the Filpenes of
770 tons, and twenty knots, the Jorge
Juan of 935 tons and thirteen knots, the
Nueva Espana of 630 tons and 18.6 knots
and the Galicia, Marquis de Molins,
GRAVE FEARS
FOR THE OREGON
WASHINGTON, April 21. â
Grave fears were expressed at
the Navy Department to-day
that the Spanish fleet at Cape
Verde might be sent to cut off
the battle-ship Oregon, now on
its way from the Pacific Coast
around to join Captain Samp
son's command. There is also
some fear that the Oregon may
be taken at an unfair advantage,
without knowledge of the exist
ence of war, by the Spanish tor
pedo boat destroyer Temerario,
which is now lying at Buenos
Ayres. Possibly with a view to
avoiding a conflict in the Straits
of Magellan, where she would be
at a disadvantage, the Oregon
has been ordered to go around
Cape Horn.
Martin Alonzo and Vincente Yanez,
each of 571 tons and 18.6 knots. Four
cruisers of between eleven and twelve
hundred tons are distributed around
the island. In addition to this force
Spain has stationed in Cuban ports a
large number of gunboats, ranging
in displacement from 500 to 2000 tons.
It is recognized by the officials that
Captain-General Blanco, in view of
the hostile parade being made by Rear-
Admiral Sampson's fleet, will not di
rect the confinement of Spanish vessels
to Cuban ports, where they will be pro
tected by land batteries, and it is the
expectation of the authorities that
these ships will attempt to do as much
damage to the blockading squadron as
possible.
Rear- Admiral Sampson is expected to
take measures to destroy any vessels
making an attack, and while he will
not bombard any fortifications he is
i expected to direct the commanding of
l ficers of the vessels of his fleet to cap
ture or destroy any Spanish men-of
war which they may meet
This will be especially the case with
the torpedo gun vessels which Spain
has in Cuban waters, as naval experts
fear that these hornets may attempt
to put torpedoes into the hulls of the
battle-ships and monitors forming the
attacking force.
Information has reached the au
j thorities that the Spanish officials in
: Cuba and Porto Rico, in anticipation of
j the arrival of the American fleet, have
| placed mines in the harbors of these
islands, and have taken every precau
tion possible to defend them against
attack. It is not proposed to risk any
vessels of the North Atlantic squadron
by sending them into a harbor in or
der to attack cities or any men-of-war
that may be lying therein.
As the Herald has stated, the inten
tion of this Government is to Institute
a pacific blockade, but it is not ex
pected that its pacificatory character
will last long, in view of the practical
certainty that the Spanish ships in Cu
ban waters will resist the coming of the
American fleet.

Since the destruction of the Maine
our Navy Department has used great
effort to augment the navy by pur
chases abroad of suitable war vessels
and in home ports to secure all the
steamers that could be utilized for aux
iliary cruisers, gunboats, dispatch
boats, transports, tugs, distilling ves
sels, colliers, etc. Latest advices have
it that about 100 vessels have been se
cured, but the list is so incomplete and
contradictory as to make a detailed
enumeration inaccurate. The efforts in
Europe were not very successful and
there is some doubt as to the utility of
the torpedo-destroyer Somers.
All the available vessels of the reve
nue, marine and lighthouse service
have been turned over to the navy and
are being rapidly fitted for naval ser
vice. It is even proposed to bring the
Gresham down from the lakes, to do
which it will be necessary' to cut her
in two. It is possible that by the time
she is ready for use her services may
not be required.
First among the auxiliary cruisers
come the American line steamers
Paris, New York, St. Louis and St.
Paul, of 10,800 to 11,630 tons and 21 to 22
knots speed. These steamers are now
receiving their batteries, which are 12
6-inch, 6 6-pounders and 6 machine
i guns for the Paris and New York, while
j the two others will cary 8 6- inch, 4
6-pounders and 4 machine guns.
Next in importance are the four Mor
gan line steamersâ El Norte, El Rio,
El Sol and El Sud. They have been
renamed Yankee, Dixie, Prairie and
Yosemite in the order named, and the
two first will carry 10 6-inch rapid
firing guns and the two latter 10 5-lneh
rapid-firing guns. They have speed of
about 16 kru>ts and will make excellent
auxiliary cruisers.
About twenty more steamers, suited
in a pinch, like the present, for active
naval service, are being fitted with
guns, but the stock of larger caliber :
modern ordnance has been exhausted
and old-style rifles of 1881 are being
brought into service temporarily.
Nearly all the fast steam yachts have
been purchased, ranging in size from
the giant Mayflower erf over 1200 tons
down to the Wahda of 35 tons. They
will be utilized as gun and torpedo
boats, and will be serviceable. The i
larger yachts will have steel belts put
on their sides in the wake of the ma
chinery sufficiently thick to keep out
machine gun fire.
The tugs, colliers and the ambulance j
ship Solace completes this impromptu
navy, w whatever its defects may
be when matched against regular yes- !
sels of war, is on the whale far supe
rior to the auxiliary forces Spain can
put afloat.
The American naval strength in the
Pacific Ocean is considerable. Of sea
going monitors there are the Monterey
and Monadnock. The latter is identical ,
with the Terror class on the Atlantic,
but has a speed of twelve knots, while
the Monterey, of 4084 tons and thirteen j
knots speed, is more powerful even than
the Puritan. She has thirteen inches
at Harveyired steel armor and carries
two 12-inch and two 10-inch guns. The
Camanche, single-turret monitor, armed
With two 15-inch smooth-bore Rodman :
guns, is serviceable at short range, .
where the smashing effect of her 400
pound shells will come into play. The
protected cruisers Baltimore, Phila
delphia and Charleston are well known j
on the coast, their speed and armament
making them more than a match for !
any vessel of a similar class which I
Spain might obtain and send out hen?
to harass the coast. Of gunboats there
are the Yorktown, Bennington and '
Concord, of 1710 tons, 17-knot speed,
and<carrying batteries of six 6-inch
rifles. On the China station are the !
Olympia, Raleigh and Petrel, the two j
first being protected cruisers, 5870 and ;
3213 tons, and 22 and 19 knots respect- !
ively, while the Petrel of 890 tons and ,
]3-knot speed carries four 6-inch rifles
The Wheeling, gunboat of 1200 tons, a ;
sistership to the Marietta, is in Alaskan
waters. She has a speed of 12 knots j
and carries six 4-inch rapid-fire guns.
The Spanish fleet around the Philip- I
pine Islands includes only one cruiser I
of any size, the Reina Mercedes, of 3520
tons, 17-knot speed and with an arma
ment of six 6.2-inch rifles. The other ;
vessels are only gunboats and include
the Don Antonio de Ulloa, Don Juan de j
Austria of 1130 tons, 14 knots, and car- ,
rying four 4.7-inch guns; the Isla de i
Cuba, Isla de Luzon, of 1030 tons and 16
knots; Velasco, 1152 tons and 14 knots;
Eicano and General Lezo, 524 tons and
11 knots.
The Navy Department has not been *
unmindful of the importance of afford
ing adequate protection to this coast
and while the regular navy is fully
competent to ward off any attack by
Spanish naval vessels provision had to
be made for guarding against priva
teers. For this duty the acquisition of
the powerful and fast tugs Fearless,
Vigilant and Acti i are well suited, ,
and there are a dozen good steamships <
which could become valuable auxiliary
cruisers and coast guards.
DEED GIVEN BY THE
LATE DR. TYNAN.
Litigation and Depreciation Cause a
Big Faling Off in the Estate's
Value.
MODESTO, April 21.â A deed was re
corded to-day in this county for all of
the land and real and personal property
of the late Dr. T. E. Tynan, who died at
San Francisco last week, aged 80 years.
The property was all deeded to the widow,
Mary Tynan. Dr. Tynan was the aged
pioneer who was in hiding for two years
while two stepchildren by a former mar
riage attempted to secure their alleged
interest in the property, which was
valued at 1250,000. Dr. Tynan nfose
quently returned from Boston, and the
Supreme Court of the State handed down j
an opinion that the contestants had no !
rights to the property. Owing to the de
preciation and costs of litigation the es
tate is not now considered worth more j
than HFiO.OOO. The deed was made in ImmJ,
but was not recorded until to-day.

MASSING AT
CHICKAMAUGA
Troops Being Assembled^
at the Famous Old
Battlefield.
Destination of Infantry Started
for New Orleans Changed
Somewhat Suddenly.
Enlisted Men and Officers Now EagÂ«r
for the Early Invasion of
Cuba.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHATTANOOGA, Term., April 21.â
Five and perhaps more of the infantry
regiments now en route to the encamp
ments at New Orleans, Mobile and
Tampa will pitch their tents on the
( hickamauga battlc-fleld. Acting on
orders received from Washington, Ma
jor-General Brooke late this afternoon
telegraphed to the commanding officers
of all the regiments which have not al
ready gone by Chattanooga, ordering
them to proceed h:re at once. Arrange
ments were also entered into with dif
ferent railroads entering at this point
for the prompt moving to Chattanooga
of the infantrymen who arrived at
ju ction points. The Twelfth Infantry,
from Fort Niobrara, Neb., on its way
to New Orleans, was diverted at Nash
ville, and will arrive here late to-night
and will be the first white infantry reg
iment to be . camped on the Chicka
mauga battlefield. ,
The Second Infantry, from Forts
Keogh, Harrison and Yates, Mont.,
which passed through St. Paul to-day
on the way to Mobile, will be diverted
at Nashville and come through to Chat
tanooga without stopping, proba"bly
reaching here Saturday morning.
The Nineteenth Infantry from Forts
Brady and Wayne, the Twentieth from
Fort Leaven worth, Kan., and the
Twenty-second from Fort Crook, all
bound for Mobile, were both communi
cated with, and by Saturday a good
sized army will have gone into camp
at Chickamauga. It is net yet certain
whether any regiments besides those
mentioned will come here, as it is un
derstood it is not the intention to recall
the infantrymen who have already
reached their Southern rendezvous or
have so nearly reached there that turn
ing them back would entail an extra
loss of time.
But all troops that have not proceeded
that far on their journey will be
brought here. No reason for this sud
den change of plans as regards the
placing of regular troops were vouch
safed at headquarters. It is believed,
however, that facilities for the accom
modation at that Southern camp
ground of such large bodies of troops
as it was at first contemplated send
ing are inadequate at present.
By night nearly 1500 of the 5000 cav
alry and artillerymen who have been
ordered to Chickamauga were camried
on that battlefield. Late this evening
the number already encamped there
w;is swelled by the arrival of detach
ments of the Second Artillery and the
First Cavalry. By to-morrow night it
is expected that a large proportion of
the troops now on their way to ChicKa
maÂ«pa will have arrived.
Major-General Brooke to-day put
Major Dillenhack in command of the
artillery at Chickamauga, while Colonel
S. S. Sumner of the famous Sixth Cav
alry took command of the cavalry
forces.
The news of the ordering of the North
Atlantic squadron to Havana created a
good deal of commotion among the sol
diers, who discussed eagerly the pros
pects of early orders for departure to
the seacoast. Among the officers a
good deal of quiet satisfaction was
manifested. It was apparently the
general opinion among them, however,
that no forward movement of the
Chickamauga troops would be given for
some time, as the gathering and. equip
ping of the large force of militia neces
sary for the contemplated Cuban In
vasion would necessarily consume sev
eral days.

>TEW TORK, April 21.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: The bill
for thr- formation of a volunteer army,
subject to the orders of the President,
will probably become a law to-morrow.
Immediately upon the passage of this
bill by the House, as amended by the
Senate, the President will affix his sig
nature and a requisition will be sent
to the Governors of the States to fur
nish their quotas of a force of 100,000
men, distributed according to popula
tion. The organization and equipment
of this force will be assigned to the
War Department, subject to the ap
proval of the President.
The troops, when they are organized
and are ready to move, will be added
to the division of the regular army â 
now mobilizing at Gulf points, where j
they will be under the command of
generals now commanding the regi
ments of the regular army already i
there. The provisional troops will be ;
organized into brigades and divisions
as so<->n as practicable, and the volun

Into an army corps, which will be com- I
manded by officers holding the rank of
major-ger.or.al of the regular army or '

brigades and divisions of these corps to
be formed of â¢ rovisional troops, will be
appointed by the President, and will be
selected from the various States repre

The general officers of the regular di

officers of the present military estab

HAVANA, April 21.â The Official Ga- !

The general Government of the island j
of Cuba to the inhabitants of Cuba: '
Without any reason or legality, without
the least offense on our part, and at a
time when they have received from us
only proofs of friendship, the United
States are forcing- us into war just at the !
moment when Quietude began to settle
over the country, when production was
nourishing, commerce taking courage and !
peace approaching, with the, co-operation
of all classes and all parties under the I
new institutions granted by the mother
country.
i Such a proceeding is without precedent
in history. It evidently mani'e~s the
bogus politics of the republic, demonstrat
ing the tricky plans and purposes that I
have always been nourished against i
Spain sovereignty in Cuba, which the 1
enemy has been conspiring for nearly a |
century to destroy. Our foes now carry
their hypocrisy and falsehood to the ex
tent or demanding immediate peace in a
war provoked and sustained by them

HAVANA, April 21.â There is a de
ficit of $2,304,532 88 in the treasury of
Havana. The Mayor declares it is
chargeable to the previous administra
tion, which- spent large sums to pay
expenses not included in the budget.
Yesterday the Mayor threatened to re
sign at the meeting of the Council un
less something was done to make up
the deficiency. Representations were
made to him that such action on his
part at this time would not be patriotic
and he decided to remain in office.
El Pais, the official organ of the au
tonomist party, publishes to-day a list
of men to be voted for as representa
tives before the Insular Cabinet. Ex
cept about ten they come from the re
formist group and are unknown. Most
of them are lawyers without clients.
On account of the last news received
about war between Spain and the
United States being nearer, it is gen
erally believed that the elections will
not take place, and in case they should
it will be difficult for the Cuban Par
liament to assemble and legislate to the
music of cannon shots.
The Conservatives also publish in
their official organ, La Constitucional,
the names of the candidates whom they
will present for election. It is noticed
that they also have not designated men
really up to the gravity of the situa
tion.
Union Constitucional. in an edltoriaJ,
says it is not possible to conceal the
fact that Spain wishes war because she
cannot allow anything to offend her
dignity. She does not mind the num
ber of her enemies. The editorial denies
that the Puritans were the founders of
the Northern American republic, and
declares that when independence was
secured the United States became the
receiving place of the universe, where
adventurers from all the world have
gone fleeing from punishment deserved
because of their crimes. They are anx
ious, it continues, to procure money by
all possible means.
La Lucha in an editorial says Spain
began this century with Trafalgar,
fought with Napoleon when he wished
to take hold of Spain as he had done
of other territories, and will finish the
century defending her territory that a
greedy foreign country wishes to snatch
from her.
History, it continues, does not record
a deed in a civilized country analogous
to that which the American hogs wish
to perform. Spain, it declares, does not
regard the situation as either difficult
or dangerous.

WAR SPIRIT
ON THE COAST
People of Fresno Give
General Shafter a
Welcome.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, April 21.â General Shafter,
his aid, W. H. McKittrick. and wife,
son-in-law and daughter of the Gen
eral, arrived in this city on the 5:20
train this evening on the way to New
Orleans. A number of citizens, headed
by Fulton G. Berry, prepared a recep
tion for the army officer, and while
there was but little time to arrange it,
the affair proved a grand success. The
commander of the California regij]ars
was tendered an ovation.
When the train arrived Companies C
and F of the National Guard and the
hospital corps wert lined up by the
side of the tra^k, while a mass of peo
ple crowded about the troops and
craned their necks to catch a glimpse
of General Shafter. Anvils were fired
and the regimental band played "Hail
to the Chief." Flags were waved by
enthusiastic people.
General M. W. Muller and Dr. Pedlar
boarded the car and asked the general
and party to partake of a collation
which had been served at the Grand
Central Hotel. Mr. Berry invited a
number of representative citizens, in
culuding war veterans, to meet the
general and party. The party had only
half an hour together, but managed to
exchange a few words. The party then
went out on the balcony of the hotel,
and the impatient crowd which was
awaiting outside cheered to the echo.
Ex-Assemblyman Bachman introduced
General Shafter. General Shafter then
made a speech which produced much
enthusiasm, lie made a rousing ad
dress, which fanned the already in
tense enthusiasm of the crowd, and
when he declared that the troops would
take every banner a-s soon as they
could reach it a prolonged shout
went up.
He declared that never had a more
popular support been given a Presi
dent, and while not of a sanguinary
nature he declared that troops would
be landed in Cuba and the island taken
in a very short time.
MONTEREY, April 21.â 01 d Monte

DEFENSE
OF NATION
PROVIDED
Senate Passes Three Very
Important Measures
of War.
Sundry Civil, Naval Appropria=
tion and Volunteer Army
Bills Disposed of.
Call Office, Rlggs House,
Washington, April 21.
Three important measures were
passed by the Senate this afternoon,
all of which relate largely to the na
tional defense. The sundry civil bill,
which has been pending for wo weeks
and which carries a large amount of
money intended to be used in the
strengthening of the country's coast
defenses, was finally passed. The na
val appropriation bill was immediately
taken up and practically completed, al
though pending the decision of an
amendment concerning the price of ar
mor plate the bill was displaced in
order that the measure temporarily in
creasing the :nilitary establishment of
the United States in time of war might
be considered.
After a long discussion the bill as !
amended by the committee was passed, j
Joint resolution was adopted giving
the President power to prevent the ex
portation of coal or other war material.
Morrill of Vermont secured the pas
sage of a bill to restore to citizenship
Mrs. Nellie Grant-Sartoris, daughter of ;
the late President Grant.
Quay of Pennsylvania introduced the
following resolution:
"That the President is hereby author- j
ized, at his discretion and with such :
limitations and exceptions as shall
seem to him expedient to pro
hibit the export of coal or other
material used in war from any seaport
of the United States until otherwise
ordered by Congress."
When the sundry civil bill was laid
before the Senate, its consideration be- i
ing by agreement, under the five min
ute rule, Money o( Mississippi said he
had noticed in a morning paper the
statement that the State Department
had announced there would, during the
coming war, be no privateering by the
United States, and that this Govern
ment would abide by the treaty of
Paris, made in 1556.
"I desire to inquire," said he "wheth
er any member of the Foreign Rela
tions Committee can inform the Senata
if the statement made in the newspa
pers is true."
"I have heard nothing about the mat
ter," responded Davis, chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee, "except
what I have seen in the newspapers."
Money, continuing:, said that he could
not believe the President had taken
such action. 'But," he said, "it is well
enough that the powers delegated to
the President be clearly defined here
and now. The power to issue letters
of marque and reprisal belongs exclus
ively to Congress. Neither the United
States nor Spain is signatory to the
treaty of Paris; but in everything re
lating to the rights of neutrals, the
United States has taken most advanced
ground. It was because the United
States took more advanced grounds
than other nations in this regard that
the United States did not become a
party to the Paris treaty."
The naval appropriation bill was laid
before the Senate. The bill, as it passed
the House, carried $38,014,0f>5. As it
was reported to the Senate it carries
$46,277,558.
Pending the consideration of the na
val bill Hawley of Connecticut, chair
man of the Military Affairs Commit
tee, called up the resolution introduced
a few days ago and reintroduced to
day, relating to the exportation of coal
and other war materials. After so
amending the resolution as to enable
the President not only to lay but to
raise the embargo the resolution was
passed without division.
The reading of the naval bill waa
then resumed and completed with its
amendments at 2:40 p. m. An amend
ment was added by the committee pro
viding that the Secretary of the Navy
may establish depots for coal or other
fuel for warships and appropriating
$250,000 for that purpose.
Perkins of California secured the
adoption of an amendment appropriat
ing $100,000 for the reconstruction of
buildings destroyed recently by an
earthquake at Mare Island navy yard.
Several minor amendments were
adopted.
As the bill was about to pass the
armor matter was brought up, and as
it was likely to lead to debate. Haw
ley brought up the volunteer army bill,
which was considered by unanimous
consent.
Several amendments prepared by the
military committee were offered by
Hawley and agreed to.
Bacon of Georgia suggested that the
bill be so amended as to provide that
no man in the military service should
be compelled to enlist by the vote of
the company of which he is a member.
Hawley explained that nobody could
be forced to enlist as a volunteer In the
service of the United States and there
would be no practical difficulty in car
rying into effect the provisions of the
bill. He further explained that no mem
ber of a militia < rganization could be
forced to go out of the country to per
form service unless he should volun
teer for such service.
Pettus of Alabama explained that the
matter suggested by Bacon would be
arranged by the Governors of States.
All of the militiamen would not, of
course, volunteer for service. No in
dividual company or regiment would
be compelled to enter the service, al
though the great body of them would
doubtless volunteer for the service.
Faulkner of West Virginia said that
the militia organizations throughout
the country thoroughly understood the
matter, as they had been in communi
cation with the War Department con
cerning it. Every member of the Na
tional Guard understood that he could
not be forced to enlist in the United
States service.
The bill, after an extended discussion,
was passed.
Consideration of the naval appropri
ation bill was then resumed in order
that certain amendments might be of
fered.
Butler proposed an amendment that
the Government should pay no more
than $400 a ton for armor plate and ap
propriating $G.f>oo,ooo for an armor
plate factory, and $1,000,000 for the man
ufacture of armor plate for vessels
now being constructed. The amend
ment went over.
The Senate then, at 5:50 p. m on
motion of Quay of Pennsylvania, went
into executive session, and adjourned
at 7:06 p. kl
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, April 21.
The consideration of the contested
election case of Patterson vs. Carmack,
from the Tenth Tennessee District, was
interrupted to-day to allow the pas
sage without division of the joint reso
lution to authorize the President in his
discretion to prohibit the exportation
of coal and other war material.
The measure is considered of vital
importance to prevent the shipment of
coal to Cuban, Porto Rican and other
ports where it could be used by Spain.
The Speaker signed it just before the
House adjourned.
Representative Hull of lowa, chair
man of the Committee on Military Af
fairs, reported back to the House the
army organization bill with a number
of amendments. It gives eighty-four
instead of one hundred privates to each
infantry company, and makes this im
portant proviso, authorizing the call for
troops:
"Provided, that in the event of a call
by the President for either volunteers
or the militia of the country the Presi
dent is authorized to report the quotas
of troops of the various States and Ter
ritories, including the District of Co
lumbia, as organized under the laws of
the States and Territories, including
the District of Columbia."
There is : lso a provision that nothing
in the act is to be construed to au
thorize a permanent increase of the
commissioned or enlisted force of the
regular army beyond that now pro
vided by the present law, except as to
the increase of twenty-five majors. The
committee says that as now presented
the bill authorizes the twenty-five regi
ments of infantry to be recruited to a
total of 31,800 enlisted men, the re
cruitment of the ten cavalry regiments
to 12,000 enlisted men, the seven regi
ments of artillery to a total of 16,457
men and the engineer battalion of five
companies to 752 enlisted men, making
the total maximum strength 61,010 en
listed men.
The military committee was in ses
sion during the day, going over the bill.
Chairman Hull is anxious to secure
speedy action and expects it may be
brought up in the House to-mnrnnv.
The bill to restore Mrs. Nellie Grant
Sartoris to American citizenship was
passed.
Kirkpatrlck (R.) of Pennsylvania
then called up the Tennessee contested
election case. Kirkpatruk, Grosvenor
and Brundidge (D.) of Arkansas spoke
<>n the case to-day and a vote will be
had at 6:30 o'clock to-morrow. At 5:45
p. m. the House adjourned.
CANNOT CLEAR
FOR CUBAN PORTS.
No More Vessels Will Be Granted
Their Clearance After the Presi
dent's Proclamation Issues.
NEW YORK, April 21.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: When
President McKinley to-morrow pro
claims the ports of Cuba in a state of
blockade no more vessels will be al
lowed to clear from ports of the United
States for any of the blockaded ports.
Up to the present time all vessels
leaving the United States for Spanish
ports have done so at the risk of be
ing intercepted by any blockade which
may be established before their ar
rival. As soon as the blockade is ex
tended to the ports of the Island of
I'orto Rico vessels will be refused
clearance to these ports, and the same
rule will be followed as to other Span
ish ports that may be blockaded during
the progress of the war.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
A woman's work is hard in many ways.
Unless the woman is strong and healthy hei
work will cause her much distress and pain,
and she will suffer from headaches, and
backaches and side-aches, and each evening
will find her utterly worn-out, sick and dis-
gusted with life. In this condition of mind
and body she cannot be a loving and ami-
able companion for her husband when he
returns from his work weary too in body
and mind.
If a woman wants to live a happy, con-
tented, loving, helpful married life she can-
not take too much care of the health and
vigor of the organs distinctly feminine, for
her general health and strength is largely
dependent upon her special health in a wo-
manly way. Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescrip-
tion enables a woman to be always well and
strong where a woman most needs health
and strength. It acts directly on the im-
portant and delicate organs involved in her
wifehood and motherhood. It makes them
strong and healthy. Taken during the pe-
riod preceding motherhood it banishes the
â usual discomforts and makes baby's coming
easy and comparatively painless. It insures
the new-comer's health and provides an
ample supply of natural nourishment. It
cures all weakness and disease, and head-
aches, backaches, and side-aches no longer
torture her in her work. Over 90,000 wo-
men have testified to the wonderful vir-
tues of the "Favorite Prescription" over
their signatures. An honest druggist will
not try to force on you a substitute for the
sake of a few pennies added profit.

SACRAMENTO, April 21. - State
Treasurer Levi Rackliffe, who has been
In ill health for a long time, a victim
of dropsy, died shortly before noon to
day at his residence, 706 M street. The
Immediate cause of his death is said
to have been an attack of pneumonia,
the ravages of which his system was
too weak to withstand. Although he
was in bad health, Mr. Rackliffe went
to his office in the Capitol to attend
to his duties, working when he should
have been resting, but the State Treas
urer was a man whose conscience
would not permit him to shirk a duty.
Levi Rackliffo was one of the most
popular men in the State, and at the
last election, when he was chosen State
Treasurer on the Republican ticket, he
received the largest plurality of any
man on that ticket. Mr. Rackliffe was
a native of Maine, aged T>s years. He
served as a soldier in the War of the
Rebellion, and at the time of his death
he was a member of Fred Steele Post,
G. A. R. t of San Luis Obispo. Mr.
Rackliffe came to California in 1866, lo
cating in Sonoma County, where he
taught school for a number of years.
From Sonoma County he moved to San
Luis Obispo, where he again engaged
in school work, tinally filling the posi
tion of principal of the schools for a
number of years.
After giving up his work as an in
structor Mr. Raekliffe engaged in the
mercantile business, but he was such
a warm friend of the public schools
that he accepted the position of trustee
and filled it a number of years.
Treasurer Raekliffe leaves a widow
and four children, two daughters and
two sons. One of his daughters is the
wife of F. W. Judson, Deputy State
Treasurer. Besides belonging to the
G. A. 1;., Mr. Raekliffe was a prominent
member of the Masonic order, the
Knights Templar and the A. O. U. W.
It has nut yet been decided when the
funeraj will be heid.
As soon as Governor Budd learned
of the death of Treasurer Rackliffe he
Instructed Deputy Treasurer Judson to
take charge of the office temporarily.
The vault door was closed and sealed.
The State Board of Examiners will hold
a meeting to-morrow for the purpose
of counting the money in the vaults.
An extra guard was appointed to watch
the treasury. The flag on the Capitol
is flying at half-mast in honor of the
dead Treasurer.
] >uring the afternoon the Governor
tendered the treasurership to ex-Sena
tor Cox of Sacramento, who is presi
dent of the California State Bank and
a member of the State Board of Agri
culture. When ex-Senator Cox was
asked to-night whether Governor Budd
had tendered him the treasurership he
replied:
"Governor Budd telephoned me this
afternoon and asked me if I would ac
cept the appointment. I replied that it
would simply be impossible. My busi
ness in behalf of others and in my own
interests requires constant attention
and in justice to all concerned I could
under no circumstances accept." I
When asked if the Governor had
asked him to accept the position for
thirty days the Senator replied:
"When Mr. Shields, the Governor's
private secretary, asked me to do that
I was also compelled to decline. While
I would very much appreciate an ap
pointment to favor or accommodate
the Governor I do not feel the urgency
is so great as to necessitate my sacri
ficing personal and other interests.
While I very much appreciate the offer
I feel that other and prior demands
upon me compel me to decline. If it
was a case of absolute necessity in or
der to meet urgent public demands I
would hesitate in declining, but feeling
that the Governor will have an abun
dance of materi-al fully qualified to se
lect from I do not feel that I am prov
ing unworthy of his confidence in de
clining. Under no circumstances can
I accept the appointment. "
It is understood that the Governor
will tender the appointment to William
H. Alford, who served as Assembly
man from Tulare County, and who is
nt present chairman of the Democratic
State Central (Vimmittee.
CONVICTS WHO NOW
WANT TO GO TO WAR.
SAN QUEXTIX. April 21.â Seventy
convicts have petitioned for the priv
ilege of freedom, that they may enlist

Jealousy Causes a Sensational
Double Tragedy at
Redding.
Fearful Deeds of a Desperate Char
acter Who Was Infatuated With
a Disreputabla Woman.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING, April 21.â A double trag
edy occurred shortly after 4 o'clock
this afternoon in a small house facing
the alley back of the Golden Eagle
Hotel. Fred Sample shot Lena Clif
ford twice through the back, then
turned the weapon against his left
breast and flred a bullet through his
heart, dying instantly. The woman lay
stretched out on the floor on her back
while Sample was lying partly across
; her limbs and abdomen. She was not
dead, but was unconscious when found.
The woman lived ten or fifteen minutes
and then expired without a moan. The
place in which the tragedy occurred is
a negro's disorderly house. Lena Clif
ford and Jennie Russell were the oc
cupants. When the shooting com
â¢ menced a negro named Tom Scott was
engaged in playing cards with the Rus
sell woman. They both ran outside
and sought refuge in an adjoining
blacksmith shop.
The Russell woman says that Lena
j Clifford came down from Keswick to
; day and that Sample followed later in
. his own private conveyance. When
Sample reached Redding he visited the
house and had a long conversation with
the woman he killed. Sample thÂ«n left
i the house. The Russell woman and
Tom Scott commenced a game of cards
jin the living room. Lena Clifford stood
1 in her bedroom doorway looking on.
\ Sample returned to the house unex
[ pectedly, appearing at the kitchen door.
j He called to Lena and as she turned
I partly toward him he stepped inside
! and fired. Lena lied into her bedroom.
Sample rushed in and flred twice more,
! two balls entering her back and one
j shattering her arm. She fell on her
i back on the floor. Sample, it is sup
! posed, sat down by the side of his victim,
j placed the pistol against his breast and
I sent a bullet through his own heart.
I falling back, face upward, across his
victim.
When Sample left the house before he
â¢ reappeared to do the shooting he went
I directly to James Young's hardware
store and purchased a Colt's revolver,
which he said he would pay for on the
first of the month. Sample had been
I a resident of this town for years, and
j was regarded as a desperate character.
!He owns property here. He removed to
! Keswick some time ago. He conducted
i a laundry, a restaurant and a barber
I shop there and was altogether well-to
| do. ' He leaves a widow but no child-
I ren. Lena Clifford was a magnificent
specimen of her race and Sample was
madly infatuated with her. She was
; one of the attractions of the tender
loin district both here and in Keswick.
â  She came here from San Francisco.
| Marshal Fisher was one of the first to
j reach the house. He placed Tom Scott
i under arrest, pending the Coroner's In
i vestigation. The cause of the tragedy
J was the Insane jealousy of Sample.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 22, 1898.
GRAND JURY
AFTER ROGUES
Consternation Among the
Monterey County
Boodlers. ,
Books of the Officials Will Be
Thoroughly Examined
by Experts.
As New Thefts Ara Discovered, It
Would Seem a Ring Was Formed
to Rob the Taxpayers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALINAS, April 21.â Tills morning
the Grand Jury made a partial report
to Judge Dorn. The report says that
the expert appointed to examine the
books of the Tax Collector and other
officers for the years 1893-94-95 had
completed the work and discovered a
deficit of $4524 45 in the Tax Collector's
office for those years.
In view of the unsatisfactory condi
tion of the accounts of the office and
the discovery of another deficit a
sweeping investigation will be made of
the books of all the county officers. The
shortage in ex-Tax Collector West
lake's books makes the total deficiency
charged against him amount to over
$21,000. Two new indictments, making
ten in all, have been filed against him.
An order was also made authorizing
the District Attorney to institute pro
ceedings aginst C. L. Westlake, ex-Tax
Collector, and his bondsmen to recover
the amount of the deficit. The fact that
the Grand Jury had ordered an exam
ination of the books of the Recorder,
Treasurer, District Attorney, School
Superintendent, Board of Supervisors,
the County Poor Farm, Justices of the
Peace, Coroner and Public Administra
tor has created some consternation, as
from the time of the arrest of Westlake
last October there have been persistent
rumors of the existence of an alleged
court house ring, and that others be
sides Westlake were equally as guilty.
Experts were changed and still defi
cits were found, till at this morning's
session the Grand Jury concluded that
it would find if there was any truth in
the report. Thus far the only short
ages found have been those of the Tax
Collector, who has had two trials on
one indictment, resulting in a disagree
ment, and one trial in an acquittal on
another charge, and Assessor W. A.
Anderson, who was short twice in his
accounts of some $1800, which he was in
some unexplained manner informed of
and allowed to make good. Until after
the next meeting of the Grand Jury
there will be many anxious Inquiries as
to how county affairs have been admin
istered.
TOMEET NEXT

Adjournment of the Session of
the State Medical
Society.
Report Made on the Controversy and
Encounter Between Drs. Potter
and Macmonaglc.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, April 21.â The final day's
meeting of the State Medical Society was,
in comparison with the session of yester
day, a very tame affair. More than half
of the members from San Francisco re
turned to their homes by the night train
on Wednesday, after the banquet, while
a number of the men from the south took
the afternoon train. The usual number of
excellent papers were read and discussed.
In the morning the special committee ap
pointed to investigate the encounter be
tween Drs. Beverly Alacmonagle and Pot- ;
ter reported. They said that they nad !
investigated the matter and concluded I
that both men were hasty and should be
censured. The report was. on motion of
Dr. Carpenter, laid on the table, and so
the matter ended for the time. What will
happen if the two men meet, it is hard :
to say, but it is safe to prophesy that i
then' will bo trouble.
Jn the afternoon the citizens of Fresno
invited the members of the society to !
drive through the vineyards of the coun- â¢
ty. The drive was most enjoyable and
tne members thoroughly appreciated the
courtesy extended to them.
In the evening papers were read by
Drs. yon Hoffman, Macmonagle, Briggs
and McKee, and a large amount of rou
tine business was transacted. The . so
ciety then adjourned to meet next year
at Monterey.

The election of Sol Cahen ns depart
ment commander of California and Neva
da will not be much of a surprise to
those comrades who had a knowledge
of his real strength. Notwithstanding
the efforts put forth by some of Lincoln
Post to make Captain Seamans the pop
ular choice, there were a number of the
delegates who would not be whinped into
line, and to those on the inside ft was to
be a contest between Colonel George
Stone of Thomas Post and Sol Cahen of
James A. Garfield Post.
Department Commander Sol Cahen has
been a resident of San Francisco since
1869. When President Lincoln called for
volunteers in mi he was among the first
to offer his services, and became a mem
ber of Company C, Third California Vol
unteer Infantry, in September, IS6I. He
was actively engaged fighting the In
dians, and participated in all the battles
which took place under the command of
General Connor while that gallant Cali
fornian was keeping open the overland
route from Sacramento to Salt Lake
City.

HIGHBINDERS
SET FIRE TO
MOKELUMNE HILL
MOKELUMNE HILL, April 21.â A fire broke out this morning that
threatened to make this eld mining town a thing of history, and its
location to be remembered by a pile of ruins. The blaze was started
by two Chinese highbinders who have been hanging around this place
for some weeks and in Amador County. They were threatened with
lynching about a month ag), having been suspected of killing: two
Chinamen.
It has been rumored for some time that a fire might be expected
and last night a secret message came warning the constable. A num
ber of residents volunteered to guard the town until 5 o'clock this
morning, at which time thoy retired, thinking no harm wouid be done
in the daylight. About three hours and a half later a blaze was seen
in Chinatown, which is very near the business portion, and two women
saw the suspects by some cabins, creeping along with ignited paper.
An alarm was given and soon the whole town was aroused. All handa
went to work, and had it not been for the prompt service of the fire
department and the good judgment of E. E. Burce, the fire warden,
Mokelumne Hill would now b<Â± in ashes.
There was a quantity of powder m several of the stores and two
explosions occurred. " A powder house was in proximity and the
explosives were removed just as the fames licked their way to the part
where they had been kept. There were about fifteen houses de
stroyed and four partly, the total loss being over $20,000, and the in
surance $2200, Chung Kee & Co. carrying the insurance. Two China
men were sew Â» ely burnt and two others, who were sick, would have
been crushed had it not been for some of their countrymen, who
dragged 'hem from the houses. The women in this place were panic
stricken when the fire broke out, many dragging 1 everything they had
into the streets. The fire burned for four hours and would have been
extinguished sooner had the firemen possessed more hose.
This is the largest fire that has been in this- county since 1874, at
which time this place was nearly all destroyed. Sparks are all over the
town and the smoke can be seen miles away.
SMITH SUCCEEDS OrJ^RTT.
Tlie Eciitor of tlie Fliiladelpliia IPress
-Appointed and Confirmed as
Postmaster-General.
CHARLES EMORY SMITH, the New Postmaster-General.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, April 21.
The President has sent this nomina
tion to the Senate:
Charles Emory Smith of Pennsylva
nia to be Postmaster-General, vice
James Gary, resigned.
It is stated at the White House that
Postmaster-General Gary's resignation
has absolutely nothing whatever to do
with our present foreign complications.
It was owing entirely, it is stated, to
the condition of Mr. Gary's health. He
is suffering from a general breaking
down of the system.
Charles Emory Smith, the new Post-
master-General, is editor of the Phila
delphia Press. He has been Minister to
Russia, is an earnest, active Republi
can, and known to public men through
out the United States. He is at pres
ent in Washington and was informed
by telephone of his nomination. He
received many congratulations this aft
ernoon at the office of the Philadelphia
Press in this city.
Postmaster-General Gary was seen as
he was about to leave for the White i
House to attend a Cabinet meeting, and
he said: "Yes, I have resigned, and
Charles Emory Smith will be my sue- I
cessor. The ground of my retirement i
is my health, which has been growing i
worse steadily, until I regarded it as !
imperative that I should lay down the
labors of the Postoflice Department. I
Some time ago I acquainted the Pres
ident with my desire to retire, indicat
ing to him that I would, of course,
await his selection of a suitable man as
my successor. He found such a one in
Mr. Smith.
Gary was asked if his resignation,
coming at the time of the Spanish war
crisis, could in any way be attributed
to that. He said:
"That has not entered into the con
sideration in any way whatever. I have
at all times supported President Mc-
Kinley's policy on the Spanish question,
and I support it now. My Cabinet re
lations have been most agreeable, and i
there have been no differences of pol
icy."
Gary's letter of resignation and the
President's answer will be made public
after the Cabinet meeting.
The nomination of Charles Emory
Smith to be Postmaster-General was
confirmed by the Senate in executive
session to-day without objection. The
doors had no sooner closed on the ex
ecutive session than Senator Gear of
the Postoffice Committee moved the
confirmation of the nomination. Sen
ator Quay then suggested that the
nomination had not gone to Congress,
and Senator Chandler moved to refer
to the Committee on Postofflces. There
waa no objection to this course and the
nomination was immediately reported
back and acted on forthwith, there be
ing no c-pposition. This expedition was
rendered possible by the fact that the
committee had previously been polled,
all the members voting for confirma
tion. .
MUCH ANXIETY
FOR VESSELS
Three Long Overdue and
at Seattle Are Given
Up for Lost
They Are the Chilean Ship Lake
Leman and Barks Santa
Rosa and Forest Queen.
The Last Mentioned Left the Sound
on March 6 for San Pedro and
Probably Foundered.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Wash., April 21.â Along
the water front much anxiety is felt
for the safety of three vessels, two of
which are long overdue in this port, and
one of which left the Sound early in
March and has never been heard from
since. The vessels bound for Seattle
are the Chilean ship Lake Leman and
the Peruvian bark Santa Rosa. The
outbound vessel missing is the bark
Forest Queen.
She may turn up, but there seems to
be little doubt that she has gone to the
bottom like the ill-fated Ivanhoe and
countless other sailing vessels that
have gone out through the straits never
to be heard of again.
The Forest Queen sailed from the
Sound on March 6 for San Pedro. Cal.
She was lumber-laden and had aboard
every stick she rould carry. Her hold
was filled with sawed lumber and her
deck was piled high with a heavy load
of piles. The latter, it is believed, con
tributed to the disaster, if disaster has
overtaken her.
She ran out past Cape Flattery on
March 7, and it is believed encountered
a series of heavy gales. The masters
of several of the sailing vessels in port
agree that the weight of the piles on
her deck probably opened her seams
during the terrible storms, and that
she went down carrying with her all
hands:
The list of her officers and crew fol
lows: J. W. Basley,. master, San Fran
cisco; H. Alberts, first mate, San Fran
cisco; C. A. Bell, second mate, Tacoma;
C. Suzuki, cook, Tacoma; A. Baertson,
seaman, San Francisco; C. Jaesen, sea
man, San Francisco; C. O. Anderson,
seaman, San Francisco; Victor Boden,
seaman, San Francisco, and Harvey
Anderson, seaman, San Francisco.
The Forest Queen was owned by

The Chilean ship Lake Leraan, which
left Guayaquil 253 days ego for Seattle,
has been causing coast underwriters
considerable anxiety. She is long over
due, and it is feared in shipping circles
that she has gone down with her large
crew. The Lake Leman is in command
of Captain Bozzo, an experienced navi
gator, and is a vessel of 1035 tons bur
den.
August 10, 1897, is the date on which
she left Guayaquil. The Peruvian bark
Rosa left Payta, Peru, for Seattle July
28, 1897, and has not been seen by any
vessel since. She has been out 270 daj r 8
and is long overdue here. She is com
manded by Captain Roistein, and car
ries a small crew. She is a compara
tively new vessel of 430 tons.
The Valley Bead's Progress.
STOCKTON, April 21.â Vice-President
Watt, Director Payson. Chief Engineer
and General Manager Storey and Traffic
Manager Moss have returned from a two
days' trip over the Valley road. It is now
thought that it will be June before the
road is completed to Bakersfield. Mr.
Moss announced that there would be no
change of freight rates of grain this sea
son, so far as he could see. This morning
the officials left on the steamer for a
trip up the river and a view of the pro
posed route across the tules to Point

WHY WHY
Q ONTINUE TO BE A Mis-
erable and a wasting man?
Is there a good reason? It is
not only that the world laughs j
at you, but you are so sure of
your weakness yourself that it
is really the most horrible tor- I
ture that can be imagined. You
want to get rid of it, then why
not do it? The way is simple.
"Hudyan" has cured others; it
will cure you. One week and
you will be full of fire. You j
will be brimming over with joy
at the alteration.
NOTâ NOT
Not one man In a thousand
knows how weak he is till ho .
breaks down, and . then the
truth is forced on him sudden-
ly. Then he often gives up
hope. But there is hope for
every creature . as t long as
"Hudyan" is to be had. Ask
what it has done for the most j
hopeless cases, and then im-
agine, what it will do for
you. If you were dying you I
would be loud in your calls for <
help. And now that you are
wasting away why not be man
enough to at least

If you will send your address or

! cases of nervous debilitation. These,
circulars are free, too. So is medical

U. S. CAVALRY
READY TO GO
Significant Order Issued at the Presidio Last
Nightâ General Shatter Goes to
Washington.
IMPORTANT orders received
at the Presidio last night
indicated that troops B, C,
J and X of the Fourth
United States Cavalry, now
stationed here, will soon
leave for the front.
Early in the evening Lieu
tenant Colonel Louis T. Morris,
commanding the squadron of
cavalry and the post, issued an
order directing that no trooper
should leave the reservation
without special permission.
To officers and enlisted men
this order to remain on the res
ervation day and night signifies
that the command to go to the
front is hourly expected.
The gallant riders of the
Fourth Cavalry are ready to
march at a moment's notice and
are eager to join their comrades
of the infantry and artillery
now hastening to the scene of
conflict.
The garrison of the Presidio
now consists of four troops of
the Fourth Cavalry and three
batteries of the Third Artillery.
It is believed that the Gov
ernment will soon order a regi
ment or brigade of volunteers
to garrison the post. Signs
point to the use of all available
regular troops for the campaign
in Cuba.
ORDERS TO TROOPS.
The destination of the First Infantry
has betm changed from New Orleans to
Chattanooga. General Shafter has been
notified of the change and on the ar
rival of the Presidio troops early next
Sunday morning in New Orleans they
will continue their journey to Chatta
nooga, via the Queen and Crescent
r^ute. a distance of 492 miles from the
Crescent City and about fifteen hours'
ride in the cars.
Not only has the destination of the
First been changed, but telegraphic or
ders were issued from the War Depart
ment yesterday afternoon to the com
manding officers of the infantry and
cavalry regiments now en route to I^evv
Orleans, Mobile and Tampa, to proceed
t Chattanooga for the purpose of con
centrating all the United States troops
at Chickamauga Park.
The significance attached to this sud
den departure from original plans
seems to be the concentration of the
regular army at a point from which, m
a few boars, it can embark on trans
ports for Cuba, New t 'rleans. Mobile
and Tampa will likely be garrisoned by
volunteers and militia.
From an officer on General Shafter's
staff it was learned that on the gen
eral's arrival in Chattanooga he will
proceed at once to Washington, accom
panied by one aid, to confer with Major
General Ml
General Merriam, U. S. A., command
ing the Departments of California and
the Columbia, was seen at the Occi
dental Hotel last evening. He con
firmed the report that the First United
States Infantry and other regiments on
the rail had been directed by the major

General Orders No. 1.
General orders No. 38, series of 1897, are
k hereby modified to read as follows: When
f a fire occurs In the parrison the trum
peter of the guard will sound fire call,
which will be taken up by all the trum
peters of the garrison. At the alarm of
fire Troop X will proceed *to thÂ« . hose
house and take the small and lar?3 hose

The resignation of First Lieutenant
Alexander T. Dean, Troop B, Fourth
Cavalry, has been forwarded to head
quarters in Washington. The officer,
who was recently placed under arrest,
is still confined to the limits of the res
ervation. Until his resignation is ac
cepted he is subject to military con
trol. It was said by a prominent offi
cer at the Presidio yesterday that Lieu
tenant Deans chief offense was the
breaking of his pledge to keep sober.
STATE TROOPS.
Scenes of Activity at Head
quarters -â  Vigilance
Aboard Vessels.
The scenes around Adjutant-General
Barrett's headquarters yesterday were
those of the liveliest animation, while a
suppressed air of excitement pervaded
everything and everybody.
The Governor and his military advisers
expect, in consequence of the passage of
the bill calling for 100,000 volunteers, that
orders will be received to-day from the
Bast making demands upon the State of
California for her pro rata of the troops.
As to tiie disposition of these troops
Adjutant-General Barrett said: "I can
not say what will be done with the forces
California may be called upon to furnish.
Our pro rata of men may be ordered East
to participate in the actual fighting, and
then the Government may desire the
State to protect its own coast with the
remainder of the National Guard.
"Should the entire guard be ordered
East volunteers can be easily raised in
the State more than sufficient to protect
any point in California which may be
threatened with invasion."
Late yesterday afternoon Major-General
Dickinson, acting under instructions from
the Governor, issued orders to the officers
of the Naval Reserve to take the pre
caution of having guards placed aboard
the United States ships Marlon and Pinta.
There is much ammunition and stores
aboard these ships. The Marion Is here
and the Pinta is at San Diego. Last
night guards were placed aboard these
vessels, in three different, watches reliev
ing each other. This is the first real
war-like precaution that has been taken
by the State.
Late last night Surgeon-General Hop
kins of the National Guard had a long
conference with the adjutant-general. He
was at headquarters, having been or
dered to report there. He reported the
medical corps to be in the best of con
dition, and prepared for immediate ser
vice.
The surgeon-general has had many of
fers from effcient doctors and trained
nurses, who are anxious to serve In case
they are needed. The medical corps of
the State National Guard is the best
equipped and most efficient of any in the
United States. To-night, when the First
Regiment assembles at the Mechanics'
Pavilion, the medical corps will give a
practical exhibition of their service upon
the iield of battle. Men will be osten
sibly wounded, and th<; Held working of
the corps will bo illustrated.
Coldnels Burglri, Choynski, Bush and
Young were at headquarters yesterday
for the purpose of keeping in touch with
the adjutant general. They discussed the
present situation with their superior offi
cers, and all of them, In fact every offi
cer of the guard, seemed to reaiize and
appreciate the terrible gravity of the
impending crisis.
Adjutant General Barrett has commu
nicated with all the officers of the Na
tional Guard throughout the State, and
he states that everything is in readiness.
With orders from the Government he can
mobilize the entire fighting strength of
the State, 4500 men, at any point within
the State, in thirty hours. In event of the
entire National Guard being: ordered East
the adjutant general says 60,000 men can
be Immediately recruited and twice that
number in a short while. This estimate
is based upon the present average of ap
plications for membership in the guard
now on file.
The present fighting strength of the
guard is on a maximum 103 men to a
company.
MONTEREY REMAINS.
League of the Cross Ca
dets Ready â First In
fantry Demonstration.
The Chamber of Commerce received a
dispatch yesterday from the Secretary of
the Navy in response to a dispatch sent
Senator Perkins asking that the Monterey
be left at this port for protection. The
Secretary said that the Monterey should
remain here while the Monadnock was or
dered to Puget Sound.
This information was hailed with delight
by the merchants of San Francisco. In
addition to this order from the Secretary
of the Navy, it was stated in the dispatch
that other vessels had been purchased by
the Government for the protection of San
Francisco.
Colonel W. P. Sullivan has received the
following letter from Adjutant General
Barrett, acknowledging the tender of the
First Regiment, League of the Cross Ca
dets, for service in the war:.

A WIDE FIELD
FOR HUMANITY.
There cannot be a greater
field for the person of hu
mane instincts than that of
fered by the Ked Cross So
ciety, which is organized in
the principal countries of the
world. lam glad to see the
movement under way here.
Hide the fact as we may,
modern warfare is a terrible
thing, and the best military
arrangements are not ade
quate to properly minister to
the wants of the wounded
and sick on the field of bat
tle. It is a glorious thought
that the spirit of humanity
and Christian charity per
meates the field where the
cruelties of war reign with
unabated fury. Wherever
the red cross is seen on a flag
of white the hearts of soldiers
will beat in gratitude for the
angels of mercy that hover
near.
It is a beautiful thought
that all the places touched by
those ministering to the
wants of the wounded and
dying are hallowed ground.
Their stores and supplies are
sacred under the terms of the
Geneva treaty, and it is a hu
mane sentiment that makes
these concessions on behalf
of the wounded and dying.
I know of no more worthy
and patriotic field for those
who desire to aid than to fol
low the example of the Red
Cross Society. To Miss Clara
Barton is due the noble work
of inducing this Government
to sign the Geneva treaty.
Her sisters in California can
not do a nobler service than
extend all possible aid to that
movement, which recognizes
the rights of the helpless
even amid the terrors of war,
and makes generous conces
sions to those who go forth to
aid the wounded, under what
ever flag they fall. â William
S. Barnes, District Attorney.
WOMEN IN WAR.
A Place for Them Under
the Red Cross Flag.
Yesterday was ladies' day In sanitary
commission affairs. San Francisco wo
men have discovered that there is a
place for them in the economy, or ex
travagance, of war. And that discovery
has gone far toward reconciling these
unconverted members of the great
peace party.
"I don't believe there should be a
war. I hoped there wouldn't be any.
No one â nothing could make me believe
that it waa coming. Yes, one thin,?
could, and it did. When I saw those
poor fellows yesterday with their stern,
serious faces, when I realized that the
five hundred might never come back, I
eried â yes, cried like a bab*-. It's a ter
rible thing, and the only way to curÂ«
one's heartache is to do what David
told Christie in Louise Alcott's 'Work.'
Remember?
" 'Don't mourn, dear heart,' he sale,
'but work!' "
It was a school girl who said this
yesterday. She had a tiny flag on
which was printed "Remember the
Maine" pinned on the lapel of her
Jacket. She still wore the colors upon
her breast to do honor to the men from
the Presidio, and her sailor hat, set
back on her wind-tossed blonde ha'.r,
had a red-white-and-blue band around
ft.
This little girl has sounded the key
note. She hRS expressed in a word
what is the feeling of every womim in
GALLANT ACT OF A PARK POLICEMAN.
Park Policeman James Kavanagh performed an act of heroism yes
terday that wins for him distinction and places his name upon the roll
of honor that is kept by the little gray-coated squad that guards the
peace of the great pleasure-ground. He, at the risk of his life, stopped
a runaway team of horses, and perhaps saved the lives of the six occu
pants of the carriage.
The team was driven by Fred Smith of 42 Turk street, and with him
were three ladies and two children, one of them being a baby in arms.
The team was improperly hitched, and It took fright by the carriage
running down on the heels of the horses on the down grade near the
east end of the speed track. The driver was unable to manage the
team as soon as it started, and down the drive it went at the top
of its speed. At every Jump the carriage struck the of the
frightened animals and spurred them on at a faster gait. Smith's
strength gradually became exhausted, and after a few moments all he
could do was to try to keep the horses on the driveway and hope for
assistance.
That assistance came at an opportune time. Policeman Kavanagh
was on his horse in a little path near the western end of the speed
track. As soon as the runaway came in sight he put spurs to his horse
and darted after the flying and scared team. He came out on the
driveway about 200 yards behind the frightened horses, and after them
he went. At that point the road was down a steep grade, and a
sharp turn was just before them. The ladies in the carriage were
preparing to jump for their lives, expecting at the turn that the rig
would upset. The pursuing policeman called to them to keep in the
rig, and a moment more and his horse was alongside the flying team.
He grasped the bridle of the plunging animal, and the fight for mastery
was on.
It was a brilliant struggle, but the policeman and his trained horse
were equal to the battle. Time after time the runaway horses were
thrown on their haunches, but instantly they were on their feet plung
ing under the restraining hand of the brave policeman. The team
nearly reached the ocean beach before Kavanagh gained the mastery
and had the animals under control.
San Francisco to-day. Of all the wi.
men I met yesterdayâ and the great
humanitarian party knows not such
boundaries as Nob Hill or south ot
Marketâ every one deplored the war.
"What's fame to a woman?"
Her stake is too great. She cannot
look upon the probabilities of loss with
philosophy. She has hoped against
hope that it was all a false alarm, and
now that the months of restless anxiety
have culminated, now that Uncle Sain
and the haughty little Don have given
each other the cut direct, she wakes al.
of a sudden to the fact that it v-asn't
make-believe after all, and complains
that it all happened so quickly she can
not realize it.
But though San Francisco women's;
hearts may be unpractical, their heads
and their hands are steady and skill
ful. All day to-day inquiries have come
in to The Call office. Women have tel
ephoned, they have written, they have
come to offer their services personally.
"Show us the way," the voices sayâ
and never was there a sweeter sym
phony concert â "we'll follow."
And what such following means may
be understood when one remembers
that California contributed $1,234,-J.'>7 31
in three years during the Civil War.
"It was just at this crisis when the
commission's plans for a thoroughly
national work were embarrassed with
the practical difficulties of a feeble and
inadequate supply of money," says the
official history of the Unit-id States
Sanitary Commission, "which there ap
peared to be no adequate means of in
creasing; when a system of canvassing
the country for money and cupplies
was hindered by the want uf means to
support canvassers in the home rie!d â
it was just at this point of time and at
this crisis in its history when three
months more of such trials as had em
barrassed the commission for the three
months preceding, would have probably
brought it to a premature death, that
the news reached the public that the
Mayor of San Francisco had telegraph
ed the President of the United States
that $100,000 had been raised in that
city for the benefit of sick and wounded
soldiers, and had ask^J his advice
| through v hat channel this magnificent
contribution should be apptieL The
Prceldf-nt consulted the burgeon gen
eral, vho immediately recommended
that the Sanitary Commission should
bÂ» selected as the almoner vi Callfor
ma'f L"i nty."
This time San Francisco is going to
j take the lead. The State will follow.
' and then the nation will join the glori
ous procession.
Within a day or two now the com
mission must be formed. The emotion
of the non-combatants who saw those
straight, steadily moving lines of blue
sweep down the broad avenue and off
toward the bay is fast crystallizing
into power. It is feeling made action â
the most powerful weapon for effect
ing miracles.
"Let us each be taxed to a certain
j amount weekly suggested a woman
yesterday. "There's no limit to the
sum we could raise."
"Let's sell another sack of flour for
$40,000," said another.
"Let's inaugurate a monster fair,"
said a woman who is president of two
societies, an officer of a third and a
member of two others.
"I haven't any strength to give,"'
sighed a woman whose life is devoted
to the unfortunate. "I'm really so ill
that I'll have to give up what I'm
doing. But â but. oh, of course, you
know, it's all nonsense! If war conies
then it isn't a question of what we can,
but of what we must. It doesn't make
any difference what I say I'll do.
When the time comes I'll be in it â I
know I will. Nothing could keep me
cutâ not all the doctors' threats in the
world. This is the way we women
right, and the nurse's cap and apron
is our regalia. I'll wear the red cross
with the rest of them. I'd feel like a
deserter if I didn't."
All this energy of sympathy, all this
altruism is not a hysterical emotion
which will pass away when once fie
memory of those marching lines of blue
become dim. The women who have
been first to volunteer, who have ear- :
liest recognized the needs of the situa
tion â this First Infantry of women is
made up of the busiest women in San
Francisco to-day. Those whose lives
are devoted to helpfulness â whether
they live in beautiful homes high upon
the hill or in the most modest of lodg
ingsâwomen who serve the poor and
the sick; women whose days are taken j
up with insistent calls upon their time,
their patience, their purses; these are
the ones who have time. They don't
know what it is â  - shirk. These are the
ones who will sign a call for a meeting
and* who will attend and serve upon
a commission with that same enthusi
asm that made Easterners say envious
ly in IBt>6, "it the Sanitary Comtnission
had adopted in all the loyal States the
method it employed on the Pacific
Coast twice the large revenues they en
joyed might have been realized."
Up at the Pacific Heights School,
where principal, teachers and pupils
are one at heart â and that a big, hu
man, loyal heart â there's patriotism
enough to equip a sanitary commis
sion single-handed. These boya and
girls have a plan which they don't in
tend to reveal till things are ripe. But
the first gun fired will set these young
patriots ablaze. And 35.000 other boys
and girls are waiting to be made aids
de camp of the peaceful corps that
fights only disease and suffering.
Here's a story that was told me yes
terday: One of the belles of San Fran
cisco Is weary of social triumphs. She
has implored her people to permit her
to follow the bent of a temperament
which takes naturally to nursing. The
rehabilitation of exhausted nature, the
making well again, the sight of that
convalescence which is the hygienic
artist's triumph in his skill, appeals
more to this girl than ballroom vic
tories and cotillion favors. So pro
nounced Is her vocation that she made
a friend of a trained nurse, who starts
shortly to the front, and asked per
mission to accompany her. Her people
and hor friends are L -t yet aware of
this determination. But to change itâ
now that men have suddenly been
transformed into soldiers and women
into nurses â they will find a harder
task than it w: s before. So one of the
prettiest of society's daughters will
humbly place herself at the feet of this

Patriotic Windows.
p C and R. B. Hale, who constitute
t ho' firm of Hale Bros., have shown their
patriotism in a decided way. One of
the entire front show windows has been
Riven over to a patriotic display in the
form of "California" gayly dressed, sur
rounded by the national colors prettily
draped. The figure representing the
Golden State is seen standing on a rock
covered with war-like trappings with a
massive silver belt thrown loosely around
her waist. At her feet is a banner, on
which the word "One Flag, One Country"
is inscribed and on a shield are the words
of the poem, "As the Flag Goes By."
The patriotic and martial spirit with
which the merchants of this city are
imbued is being given practical expres
sion in the elaborate decoration of their
places of business with flags of the na
1 One of the most noticeable, and at the
same time most appropriate, is that of
Raphael's clothing establishment on
Kearny street, the small wlndo.v "f
which represents a patriotic object les
son for children, and contains an immens%
shield with Webster's famous quotation,
"Liberty and Union, now and forever, one
and inseparable." There are also flg
tires of enndren holding miniature flags.
In the large window stands a life-like
figure of "I'ncle Sam," on whose face
has been made to appear a smile of pride
as he looks upon the two flags between
which the figure stands, the one a hand
somely made American flag, the other the
lone star flag of the Cuban insurgents.
The entire front of the building is also
profusely decorated, while an immense
flag floats from a staff at the apex of the
building.

Question.
Troublous Times on Board the Tramp
Steamer Amarapoora, Now
at Hakodate.
There was a big crowd of people down
to see the steamer Alameda away for
Australasian ports yesterday. Considerable
good-natured badinage was passed be
tween the passengers on the steamer and
their friends on the wharf, and the ex
pression, "Look out that a Spanish priva
teer doesn't get you," was frequently
heard. The Alameda took away a very
valuable cargo and the following cabin
passengers:

ter and wile. R. W. Davie and wife. Miss
Grace Dickey, Miss Millicent Fell, Miss M.

The unfortunate British tramp steamer
Amarapoora seems doomed to spend her
last d^-s In Japanese waters. Ever since
she came to Pacific waters the captain
and crew have been in hot water, and the
steamer has been alternately in the hands
of the United States Marshal and on the
drydock for repairs. She left Puget Sound
last October with a load of lumber for
China, but on November 20 put into Hako
date in distress. On January 19 she was
overhauled, but the surveyors refused to
give her a certificate, and ever since the
engineer's crew has been trying to patch
up the boilers so as to make her pass
muster. By last steamer from Yokohama
comes the news that there was almost a
riot in the engine-room. Squire Shires
and John Nesbit, two boiler-makers, dis
obeyed Captain Cameron's orders, and
furthermore assaulted Second Engineer
J. W. Karston. The chief engineer also
was in the trouble, but as he was too
drunk to appear in court when the case
was called the outcome of the fracas will
not be known until the Rio de Janeiro
arrives.
The steamer Venus is still in quarantine
and is liable to remain there until Cap
tain McGregor and his men submit to
being fumigated. Two tugs were sent over
to bring the vessel to tno dock, but Dr.
Rosenau would not release the vessel. It
would now appear as though the quaran
tine muddle was about to become an in
ternational question. Captain McGregor
asserts that the State quarantine officer
passed his vessel and admitted her to
pratique. Then along comes the Federal
officer and places her in quarantine. Cap
tain McGregor refuses to submit to fumi
gation and has appealed to the British
Consul, and there the matter rests. In
the meantime the Occidental and Oriental
Steamship Company and the consignees
of the vessel are making the stubborn
skipper's life miserable w...h petitions
asking him to give in and take the neces
sary bath.
Captain "Dan" Haskell started for Fn
alaska on the steamer Bertha yesterday.
He has been given a year's leave of ab
sence by the Pilot Commissioners in or
der to superintend the towing of the
Alaska Commercial Company's river
steamers from Unalaska to St. Michael,
and also the workings of the company's
fleets on the Yukon.
William E. Mighell has purchased the
ship James Nesmith from her New York
owners. She is now at San Diego, having
made the voyage around the "Horn in the
fast time of 122 days. From San Diego
the Nesmith will go to Puget Sound,
where Captain McLeod, who is expected
daily from Portsmouth, N. H., on the
schooner Concord, will take command.
From the Sound the Nesmith will take a
load of coal to St. Michael, and will there
meet the ship Rufus E. Wood, which is
now loading here for that port. The
Wood is in command of Captain W. J.
McLeod, brother of the McLeod on the
Concord, and at St. Michael the brothers
will#change ships. W. J. will take the
Nesmith and "Concord" McLeod the
Rufus E. Wood.

THE PRIVATEERING PROBLEM.
WJ HILE the nations of Continental Europe may
growl a good deal over the interference of
the United States between a European mon
archy and its colonies in this hemisphere, and Great
Drirain may be loud and cordial in its commendation
ci the course taken by this country, it is likely that
both the Continent and Great Britain are at heart
much more interested just now in the question of
i-rivateering than in any other involved in the pos
sibility of war between che United States and Spain.
Feelings of sympathy on the part of foreign na
tions for one side or the other are after all but
niar.ifestations of sentiment, and are not at all likely
to icsult in action of any kind. The question of pri
vateering, however, is addressed directly to the
pockets of every commercial people. Merchants of
all rations \m.Â» watch with anxiety to note how far
privateering is to be practiced on either side, and to
what extent their own governments may be relied
upon to protect goods shipped under their flags.
The only legal restraint upon privateering is that
international agreement entered into by several of
the great nations at the treaty of Paris in 1856, but
to this treaty neither the United States nor Spain is
a party. Neither of them, therefore, is bound by
it. There has grown up, however, in recent years a
sort of cosmopolitan public opinion against the prac
tice, and possibly this may have some power to pre
vent either ourselves or the Spanish resorting to it.
Strangely enough the first open declaration in favor
of a return to free privateering comes from Great
Britain, the home of commercialism and the prime
mover in bringing about the international agree
ment to suppress it. This declaration comes from
the Post, one of the most influential papers in Lon
don, and consists in a statement that it agrees with
Lord Charles Beresford, rear . dmira., that Eng
land's most simple and most honorable plan would be
"formally to denounce the declaration of Paris,
which we ought never to have signed."
In the short reports of the Post article that have
come to us it is not stated on what grounds either the
paper or Lord Beresford has reached such a singular
conclusion. In the meantime it is announced that
our Government has made efforts to bring about an
arrangement with the maritime powers of the world
whose ships carry American goods whereby such
goods will be protected under their flags. It is also
reported the powers will not only agree to this, but
will strive to induce Spain to observe their declara
tion of such protection.
In any event the world has passed the stage of un
limited privateering. The property of private citi
zens is respected on land during war, and it should be
equally respected on sea. If any extensive pri
vateering is carried on against our commerce it will
not be long before some foreign flag will be involved,
and then the issue will be brought to a swift and final
settlement.
At a time of public excitement, when the air is full
of rumor, almost any report may receive temporary
credence. Even the papers anxious to print only the
sober truth may be misled by the prolific liar at the
other end of the line. Yet it is a shameful thing that
falsehoods known to be such should be blazoned as
the truth. The evening papers, in their anxiety to
print news before it appears in the morning papers,
have fallen into the habit of lying in big type, la
beling the product "Extra" and selling it to people,
who have then to wait for the morning to find
whether they have been reading fact or fable. And
generally they have been reading fable.
There will be surprise at the circumstance that
some Englishmen desire to join the American navy,
a course tending just now to make them bad insur
ance risks. But it may be remembered that during
the present trouble England has been more than
merely kind. And then the instinct of a Britisher is
for a bit of a scrap, anyhow.
Whatever the issue of the war, it will never be
completely satisfactory unless it involve the ridding
of the earth of that monstrous fiend, Weyler. Ameri
cans are not bloodthirsty, but they want murderers
hanged.
Unless upon the hypothesis of hysteria, it is diffi
cult to understand the attitude of an evening paper
which in one editorial upholds the administration and
in another attacks it.
To scoop the world by publishing what has not
occurred is hardly a thing to brag about.
LET THE SICK BE REMEMBERED.
THE CALL'S interviews with many citizens
yesterday on the subject of sanitary work aux
iliary to the hospital corps of the regular army
disclose the necessity for timely organization to care
for the sick.
In our Civil War soldiers were fighting under fa
miliar physical conditions, in a climate to which they
were native, yet nearly a million Union soldiers and
half a million Confederates died who never felt a
wound. Of our annual pension payment of $148,000,
000 at least half is for permanent disability ensuing
upon camp diseases, and not for wounds received in
battle. If timely measures had been taken to supple
ment the work of the army surgeons and hospital
corps it is safe to say that one-fourth of our pension
appropriation, or $37,000,000 a year, would have been
saved. The war that is now upon us will cost dearly
in lives and treasure, no matter how prudently we
prepare for its emergencies. In default of such pre
paration the loss will be multiplied and the struggle
prolonged.
Our men are going first to military enterprise in
Cuba, to march and fight and camp in physical con
ditions that are not natural to them, to face strange
diseases to which they are not immune. It is not a
country of roads and highways even. Pack trains
must take the place of army wagons. The sick and
wounded will have no ambulance service. The tropi
cal evaporations exhale poisons that light the fires of
fever. The wounded will be more fortunate than the
sick when their plight is considered merely from the
surgical standpoint. Field surgery is another art
compared with what it was in our Civil War. Aseptic
and antiseptic surgery have reduced the form and
variety of supplies that were then necessary in the
surgeon's equipment, and wounds and amputations
have been stripped of more than half their terrors and
of 75 per cent of their risks. But, while this is true,
the camp diseases are abhorrent as ever. The
deadly nostalgia, that homesickness which paralyzes
the sentries on the picket line of life and lets fever
pass unchallenged to slay its victim, hovers like a
vulture over the march of every army. Days of bat
tle, of storm, of forced march, and nights without rest
or shelter, are the soldier's lot. Stout hearts that beat
high in action fail under the unavoidable privation
and tension of campaign life. Their succor must
come from the knowledge that they are unforgotten
by the people at home. The timely dainty, the good
word of hope spoken in pinch and stress, the touch of
woman's hand when strength and senses fail, help at
the moment when it arms nerve and heart to turn an
attack of disease, and that which lifts the sufferer to
the safe side of its crisis â all must come from sources
auxiliary to the regular medical resources of the army.
Let us not wait, as in the Civil War, until thousands
are dead in the camps and enlistment to fill their
places slackens, because men who will go singing
into battle and die with a cheer in their throats halt
and hesitate when they are asked to face death in the
hush of the hospital, with no wild charge and music
and rattle of musketry and roar of artillery which
nerve them in action.
The many drafts necessary to fill our quotas and
keep our standard advancing in the Civrl War had
for their principal cause the certainty of disease in
camp rather than wounds and death on the field.
When war begins it is foolish to say it will be brief,
and it is wrong to omit the smallest preparation to
mitigate its sufferings and limit the mortality it will
cause. In the belief that every preparation should be
made at once, we urge public attention to this imme
diate organization of the energy and mercy and skill
and devotion of the people at home for sanitary work
in camp and hospital.
FREIGHT RATE DISCRIMINATIONS.
AMONG the bills before the Senate which
would probably have been acted on at this
session but for the distraction from routine
affairs caused by the Spanish crisis is one introduced
by Senator Cullom providing for an amendment of
the interstate commerce law so as to largely increase
the powers of the commission created by it.
The measure is of more than ordinary interest to
Californians, because the people of this State suffer
greatly from unjust discriminations made by the
railway companies, and any legislation which would
enable the Interstate Commerce Commission to
promptly right such wrongs would be of vast bene
fit to our producers, manufacturers and merchants.
The aim of the Cullom bill is to cover the defects
in the present law which have been indicated by the
courts. It gives the commission power to perform
certain acts which the courts have declared it does
not at present possess. Among other provisions the
bill requires common carriers to file schedules of
their rates with the commission, and requires a speci
fication of such carriers as are parties to any joint
tariff, and also evidence of the commission's accept
ance of the same. It confers on the commission the
right to determine and fix rates where these are un
reasonable, and also to decide in cases of dispute on
joint reductions the proportion of each road affected.
Amendments of this nature would probably cover
the injustice that our producers and manufacturers
complain of, and would enable them to obtain justice
by the sure operation of law instead of having to
seek by the uncertain way of petition to the railroad
managers. It is therefore to our interest to have the
Cullom bill or one like it enacted as speedily as pos
sible.
It must of course give way to legislation needed
to meet the controversy with Spain, but when that is
out of the way sorn/ action should be taken upon it.
If we are to have an Interstate Commerce Commis
sion it should certainly be clothed with authority
enough to enable it to be useful to the commerce of
the country.
While no great amount of blood was spilled at the
Democratic debate Monday night, the statement is
made by eye-witnesses that it was seething hot gore.
It appears that Hayes began hostilities by calling
Larry Buckley a dog. Buckley disapproved the ver
dict and manifested his displeasure by slamming
Hayes through a mirror. However, the incident may
be regarded as closed, as also the optics of the
gladiators.
The reason a Police Judge sometimes fines some
body for contempt seems to be to show dignity.
Then he remits the fine, so as to show good nature.
No lawyer could reasonably object to thus being
utilized by the bench. He may be there himself after
a while and pine for an occasional spectacular dis
play.
If the Arizona cowboys invade Cuba they might
permit the enemy to capture their horses. Shortly
after this bit of diplomacy Spanish pride would have
a fall such as would jar its spine.
Shouting "Death to the Pig Yankees!" may be in
dicative of valor and a token of chivalry, but not a
Yankee in the world will die of it.
THE SAN FKAXCISCO CALL, FIUDAY, APRIL 22, 1808.
THE SERE AND YELLOW CHIEF
CHIEF LEES never neglects an opportunity to
demonstrate his unfitness for the office he
holds, and opportunities are frequent. He
should be retired. Exhibitions of his incapacity have
become monotonous. The people want a Chief of
Police in whose executive faculty and integrity of
purpose they can have confidence. This old man has
outlived such usefulness as he may have had. The
time has come to lay him aside. The act would be
one of simple self-defense.
Whenever a crime is committed Lees forms a
theory, and with a perspicuity in which he takes
yreat pride selects a criminal upon whom the crime
must be fastened. Then all testimony is made to
adapt itself to his theory or it is thrown aside as
worthless. If the theoretical criminal cannot be con
victed, search for the real criminal is abandoned.
Perhaps few innocent men have actually suffered
through this peculiarity, but there is no doubt many
guilty ones have escaped. The subordinates of Lees
dare not oppose him. Detective Hogan tried it some
years ago. Hogan was "put on the shelf."
In every trial Chief Lees arrogates to himself the
right to take sides. Instead of regarding his duty to
be that of collecting evidence, he assumes to be
prosecutor, Judge, jury, and has lately added to his
prerogative that of being censor. Perhaps this is
but an indication of senile decay. Yet there are safe
retreats for one in his dotage, and Lees has ample
means to pay for the care he seems to need. As head
of a great Police Department he is a blustering er
ror. When one of his men is charged with derelic
tion to duty, with cowardice, with unbecoming con
duct, does Lees try to ascertain the truth? It may
be said frankly that he does not. Unless the truth is
favorable to the man he does not want it known. A
similar spirit governs his attitude toward friends who
steal. The case of Widber is enough to cite to prove
this.
Here was a public servant, elected by the people,
trusted by them, permitted to handle their money,
and by a laxness yet to be explained allowed to spend
it in riotous living, to rob the vault month after
month. Widber was caught, as must have been in
evitable. The public had every right to know each
fact. It had as much right as the Chief himself. Yet
after Widber had confessed Lees tried to shield him,
refused to tell the story Widber had told to him,
gruffly denied there was anything to tell. Perhaps
the Chief had picked out another person upon whom
he preferred the weight of condemnation might fall.
The element of gratitude may have been present. At
about the time Widber began his lavish system of
thefts he changed his bondsmen, releasing Lees, who
had qualified for the sum of $50,000. It would be
natural for a man to be thankful for this escape, but
if the man happen to be Chief of Police he should
not let his benign joy blind him to the circumstance
that stealing is forbidden by statute, and the cornered
thief is not entitled to the shield of official protection.
Lees is said to be retained as Chief so that ulti
mately he may draw a higher pension than if rele
gated to private life now. We submit that the reason
is not good. The welfare of this city is of more im
portance than the personal welfare of anybody who I
has grown grossly rich and notoriously incompetent
while in the city's service.
SUBMARINE WAR VESSELS.
IF war comes with Spain, as now seems inevitable,
it is likely the world will be given another illustra
tion of the truth of the old proverb, "History re
peats itself." As in our Civil War the appearance of
the monitor upon the scene of action effected a revo
lution in the construction of war vessels, so there may
appear in this conflict some new ship of American in
vention that will so completely offset the armor and
armament of all existing war vessels as to require a
reconstruction of every navy on the globe.
Such a vessel, if it comes, will probably be in the
nature of a submarine boat, -as it is in that direction
the ingenuity of naval constructors has been mainly
working for some years past. A host of boats of
various kinds and qualities exist to attest what may
be achieved in the construction of such ships. It has
been proved that it is feasible to build a vessel that
can be operated under water. All that remains to do
is to construct one that can remain under the sea
for a long time in rough and deep water as well as in
calm harbors, and make long voyages without the as
sistance of tenders. When such a submarine boat has
been launched and her capabilities proved in actual
battle, as were those of the Monitor in her memor
able struggle with the Merrimac, the existing fleets
of the world will be as comparatively useless as are
the old wooden men-of-war that preceded our civil
conflict.
Tests recently made of the capabilities of the Hol
land submarine boat show that the ingenuity of
American inventors has already nearly succeeded in
solving the problems of such structures. The Hol
land boat has not yet been tried in stormy, deep
water, or over a long course, but she has been re
peatedly submerged and brought back to the surface
at the will of her navigator. It is said she can carry
gasoline enough to enable her to make a voyage of
2000 miles, and enough compressed air to sustain her
crew under water for nine hours. This would be
ample for all war purposes, as no conflict would re
quire her submergence for a longer time. She has a
speed of sixteen knots on the surface and nine knots
when submerged, and, finally, she carries three tor
pedo tubes designed for as many different kinds of
missiles, and is therefore well armed for aggression
against any foe she might meet.
While this particular craft may not prove the suc
cessful submarine boat that is desired, her accom
plishments show that such a vessel may be expected
in the near future. The war, if it comes, will increase
the activity of our inventors in this direction, and it
is not improbable that a Spanish fleet may be made
the target on which some submarine ship will prove
her worth by rendering worthless all other forms of
battle-ships that now lord it over the seas.
There is nothing to alarm Americans in the rumor
that Havana may be found in ruins. They want to
find it marked by an absence of Spanish authority,
and are willing to undertake a little of the ruination
business themselves if necessary.
While the Theosophists are known to favor peace,
one of them explains that there may be necessity for
destroying a foe so that peace may be secured. There
are a great many who are not Theosophists and
yet feel exactly the same.
"Now," remarks a Spanish paper with a solemnity
little less than awful, "she (Spain) will kick her (the
United States) and use the whip!" We can only beg
of Spain not to kick hard nor to use a large, un
wieldy whip.
Some enemy of General Lee suggests that Hearst's
yellow papers boom the distinguished Southerner for

tacks against a worthy gentleman and a trood soldier.

"You know," said he, "that when the

men who refused to surrender, on any
terms, and getting together made their
way out of the United States over the
line into Mexico. They stuck together
for some time, being employed by the*
Mexican Government in taking care of
bandits, Indians, revolutionists or any
thing else that needed men who would
rather fight than eat. At first they man
aged to do fairly well, but the Indians
and bandits, finding that it was a losing
game they were playing when these
Gringos came to be their opponents, stop
ped their depredations and the orcupa

to do little else but fight, was gone. They
still hung together, getting poorer and

broke up into little squads, which again
separated into single individuals and each
man had to shift for himself.
"One of these fellows, after drifting all
over the country for several years, at last
brought up, poor, friendless and alone, in
one of the Spanish-American cities on the
Atlantic sea coast. The day after his ar

sat there looking out to sea, wondering
how he was going to make his way with

were not of his blood, habits or creed, and
to whom the very name 'America' was
only mentioned as a curse, when he saw
a ship of war entering the bay. Ho
watched her with a languid interest until
suddenly a puff of smoke issued from one
of her ports, as she answered to the sa
lute of the fort at the entrance of the
harbor, and with the sound of fife and
drum run her colors, in a little ball, to
the masthead where the ball was tripped
and the stars and stripes floated out on

WHAT WAR MEANS FOR SPAIN.
Probably few Americans are able to re
alize what a war with America will
doubtless mean to Spain. It means not
simply the loss of Cuba and perhaps
Porto Rico also. It means not alone
overwhelming naval defeat and bank
ruptcy of the national treasury. It prob
ably means the downfall of the Rank of
Spain, the one great llnancial institution
of the country, and with its fall the col
lapse of other banks and scores of cor
porationsâa general panic, stoppage of
industries, ruin for many thousands of
well-to-do citizens, and following in the
wake of all this an uprising of popular
passion and disorder, perhaps revolution
itself, and a sweeping away of the dy
nasty, as Napoleon 111 lost his throne
after Sedan.â Hartford Leader.
OBLIGED TO STAY AT HOME.
The report that Weyler is to resume
command in Cuba if war takes place is
not true. The reason it is not true is
that Cuba's principal ports will proba
bly be blockaded within forty-eight hours
after the declaration of war, and some
of them are likely to be in American
hands within forty-eight hours afterward.

With the symphony In the afternoon

It is a good tiling to have the prima

clamors for good nature and elevated

Melba was in a merry mood, full of
capers and grimaces; and for a singer
who does not make a specialty of being
called an inspired actress by coi.i h>-a<l

very fair approach to its full value. She

is a limit to the physical demonstra
tion of humor, but it never came to
question 1. st night. Not only Melba,
but all of her little compa- w seemed to
feel the fun and spring of the piece
and to work for an atmosphere and an
ensemble.
With a less singer as the Rosina
I could say that the play was the thing.
Hut for all the united effort to give a
: â rate performance, for all the de
lightful acting and inspirited singing of
Companari'a Figaro and the quite af
fable comicality of Salignac's Almavlva
(although his voice did wobble off into
keys that were never writ by mortal
hand), it was still the voice of Melba
that dominated everything and set the
jjulse of the crowd.
It was s..rne little time before the
audience and the performers oouM get
back to the opera, which, all in all, was
most successfully given. The part of
Basilio, especially in the Calumny aria,
suffered at the tremolo of Yiviani; but
Bertha was at least acceptable from
Mme. Cauteren, and Carbine played
Bartolo with excellent comic effect.
Th^ glory, to be sure, was Melba's but
t'ampanari's Figoro was an almost
perfect piece of humorous character.
Purely it was a foregone con
clusion that the play would go to
smash in the music lesson scene, where
the Interpolations come in; and it did
â with a vengeance. Rossini and his an
cient Spain were clean forgot so soon
as Melba had sung "Sevillana," which
Massenet wrote Into this scene for her.
It was at the conclusion of this that
the audience made the first big demon
stration of the night: and she sang a
songs of Tosti's, "Mattinata." with the
â¢t boudoir flavor, to her own ac
companiment on the piano and with
a hint of anything but warmth

When a few weeks ago I questioned
the spirit and policy of a symphony so
ci'-ty which excluded from its pro
grammes the work of any and all local
composers on no other ground but that
it was the work of a loc;il composer, I
hardly dared hope that a Bingle pro
test, no matter how polite and practi
cal, would have an immediate effect on
the society's programmes. But sure
enough the following week brought the
next concert's announcement of a sym
phony written in San Francisco by Mr.
Fred Zech Jr. of San Francisco; and
rday afternoon in the Tivoli the
symphony n;is played by Mr. Bcheel.
Naturally, I congratulated the society.
Bo far as the principle of the thing
goes it does not matter that thÂ» work
had been played here once before by
Mr. Bauer, nor that the composer is
one of tli" directors of the Symphony
Society; th* main idea is that a local
score was given a hearing. With this
precedent the unplayed Mozarts and
Tschaikowskys of Snn Francisco may
take heart. Even if it be considered
necessary that they should become di
rectors of the society before their mv-
Fie is played by the society's band, the
barrier to being heard is nothing like
as insurmountable ;<s it used to be.
Mr. Zech's symphony, No. 4, in C
major, entitled "California," and de
picting in its several movements "Calm
Sea at the Cliff House," "Jollities at
the California Mining Camp," "In the
Gardens of California" and "Cosmopol
itan Life in San Francisco," wjll be re
membered more as the breaker of the
society's exclusion rule than as a seri
ous contribution to symphonic litera
ture. Mr. Zech is one of the best of our
local musicians, an indomitable worker
for all that is best in the professi-n
he so honorably represents, and a cul
tured appreciator of pood music; and
now that he has heard his symphony
played a second time I will waiter that
he thinks no more of it than I do. As
Dumas said about plays, it is so easy
not to write a symphony; and as Stev
enson said about books, the amount of
manual labor attendant on writing one
demands some respect â so if those who
hold the highest form of musical com
position in jealous esteem cannot ap
plaud Mr. Zech's symphony for its in
vention and inspiration, they can at
ieast applaud the pains that went into
the making of it and the good that may
come out of the precedent created by
its performance.
The band was at its best and Mr.
School made the second part of the pro
gramme very lively by his spirited di
rection of the Saint-Saens ballet music
to "Henry VIII" and Liszt's First Rhap
sodic. The overture was the unfamiliar
and unimportant one of Marschner'a
opera, "Hans Helling," a piece that
in its opening measures strongly pre

TO EXTEND POTRERO AVENUE.
A Movement on Foot to Provide a
Suburban Driveway to Bur
lingame.
At a meeting of the Mission and Po
trero Improvement Club, over which T.
B. Slevin is chairman, the question of ex
tending Potrero avenue to Army street
and into the San Bruno road was dis
cussed. Max Popper stated that the club
should take action in the matter of hav
ing the avenue extended and the whole
roadway from Ninth street to the county
line sprinkled during the summer months.
He stated that the Supervisors appro
priate $10,000 annually for the purpose of
keeping county roads in proper condition,
and as the San Bruno road was the only
county road to be looked after a portion
of this money should be used for that
purpose. The Supervisors vi San Mateo
County appropriate $20,000 annually for
the roadway rrom its junction with San
Francisco to Burlingame, a distance of
eighteen miles. This portion of the road
Wilt be sprinkled during the summer
months, in view of this it would be no
more than right that San Francisco
should have its portion of the driveway
sprinkled.
Accepting the views of Mr. Popper on
the BUtoject, it was deemed proper to
have the subject brought before the Mis-
League of Improvement Clubs at
the next meeting.
The question 01 extending Potrero ave
nue to Army street seems to be one of
lerable trouble, as there is some
legal tangle involved which has so far
blocked tut- project. Some few years ago
a commission was appointed on the ex
tension Â«>f tliis avenue and some of the
property-owners paid their assessments.
This money is now lying in the treasury,
and the persons who paid it have re
ceived no rewards or benefits, nor can
they get their money back.
It is the intention of the league of
clubs now formed to aid those people,
and also to have the street extended.
The sewer system in this whole district
needs a thorough overhauling, and with
this object in view the club has taken
notice of the very bad condition of the
Bewers and swamps lying between the
San Bruno road. Army, Harrison and
Twenty-fifth streets. The attention of
the Board of Health will be directed to
tliis location.
The Supervisors advised the club to
have the" accepted street scheduled and
Bent in to the board before the next con
tract la let tor the street sweeping of the
city. The object of this is that the
streets in the Mission may be enumerated
in the contract.
State Senator Dwyer stated that he had
called on the managers of the San Mateo
and San Francisco Railroad with the ob
ject of getting that company, the only
one that luis the sympathy of the people
at heart, to extend its line from Guer
rero along Twenty-third street to Po
trero avenue, thus giving the people in
that section an opportunity of reaching
the park and also of petting to and from
the cemeteries in San Mateo County.

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 22, 1898.
EXCELSIOR BOOTH AT THE MASONIC FAIR.
It is expected that all Masons who have not already taken an active in
terest in the movement which is on foot to raise funds for the completion of
the Decoto Home for Widows and Orphans of the fraternity will take advantage
of the opportunity offered to become familiar with what Charles L. Patton and
the other members of the executive committee are doing.
As the festival is to be held during this week it may not be out of order to
term the same Masonic week and prepare for attendance thereat.
Judge Carroll Cook has virtually promised to become sponsor for "Excelsior
Booth," in which will be exhibited a number of very interesting American relics,
including some of Martha Washington, the mother of the man who was "first in
war, first In peace and first in the hearts of his countrymen." The ladies in at
tendance are to be dressed in appropriate costumes, and the booth, when com
pleted, will be one of the most artistic in the Pavilion. The ladies at this booth
will have charge of the sale of souvenir badges and also of theTillmajin&Bendel
gifts to the home.

In regular order and transacted the usual routine business. Reuben H. Lloyd
presented the Grand Commandery with a richly embroidered silken beauseant,
and Jacob H. Neff, the well-known mining man. gave the commandery the na^
tional colors woven in silk. Dr. R. M. Powers, deputy grand commander of Cali
fornia, made the presentation speech. He was thoroughly patriotic and prom
ised his faith in the Knights Templar should the country ever be in trouble with
a foreign power. Accepting the gifts on behalf of tho commandery, George T.
Metcalf said he was entirely in accord with the views expressed by Dr
Powers, 'xue officers elected for the ens uing year will -be installed to-day.
METER MONEY
ILLEGALLY HELD
Gas Company Admits
That It Has No Right
to Deposits.
A Victory for the People Comes
From the Suit of Henry
James.
The Corporation Plainly Shows That
It Had No Claim to the
Money.
The case of Henry James against the
San Francisco Gas and Electric Com
pany was o-n trial before Justice of the
Peace : arry yesterday, and while the
Justice reserved his decision, it resulted
in a victory for the plaintiff personally
and the public in general, in that the
company admitted that it had no right
to demand a deposit from gas-users.
In making this admission, Attorney
Rix, for the company, made the rather
startling statement that the company
never "demanded" a deposit, but that
customers usually made a voluntary
contribution in order to protect the
company from loss.
Mr. James, who was represented In
a legal way by Frank McGowan, was
placed on the stand and gave the his
tory of his dealings with the company,
beginning about five years ago, when
he ordered a meter for his house and
was compelled to make a deposit rrf 53
before his order could be filled. When
he afterward found that the demand
was illegal he determined to recover
his money, but his applications for its
return were refused, and then he
brought suit for the amount, claiming
that it was illegally held.
In the cross-examination Attorney
Rix tried to bring out the point that
the deposit was a voluntary contribu
tion to the capital of the corporation,
but only succeeded in showing the
money was given under duress. It was
also shown that Mr James was not in
debted to the company and that he had
no other animus in the matter than a
desire to be the custodian of his own
cash.
Cashier Barrett of the Gas and Elec
tric Company was placed on the stand
by the defendant and swore that the
deposits were not for meters, but were
purely voluntary contributions request
ed as a matter of business. A copy of
a letter was produced which had been
sent to Mr. James offering to refund
the $5, and it was developed that this
offer was not made until after the writ
ten demand for the money had been re
fused and suit filed. Then, as Mr. Bar
rett naively remarked, the company
thought it best to pay back the money
for the sake of peace. He said the re
lation of the $"> to the company was in
the nature of a part of the contract be
tween t.ie company and the consumer
but Justice Barry posed the cashier
when he asked what consideration was
given for the |5.
Justice Barry reserved the decision
until next Monday morning at 10
o'clock.
Embezzlement Charged.
B. O'Brien, a salesman for the Chicago
Clock Company on Market street, wa3
arrested yesterday afternoon on a charge
of felony embezzlement. He is accused
of selling thirteen pieces of dress goods
valued at $200 and appropriating the money
to his own uses and purposes. O'Brien
declares that the articles were stolen from
his wagon.

lengthy session last evening, the time bo

several new buildings which are not !â¢<â¢

A FORTUNATE INVESTMENT.
brings Happiness to a Popular
Stocktonian.
J. E. Adams of Stockton had been
turning over in his mind for quite a
time the advisability of pulling up
stakes and going to Alaska, but de
layed his departure, because he was
interested in watching the progress of
the war scare.
Along in th^ early part of March an
agent approached him with lottery)
tickets for Bale, and in a lucky moment
Adams transferred a dollar to the
agent, taking in exchange therefor !
ticket No. 24533 in the lottery of the I
Boneficencia Publica of the City of i
Mexico. March 24 that number won j
the capital prize of $00,000, and Mr. j
Adams' quarter share netted him $15,- j
000. He therefore considered that home !
investments judiciously made will reap |
a richer harvest than Klondike ven
tures, and there is also the advantage
of not having to endure untold hard
ships. I
The Benpflcencia Publica is the only !
lottery In Mexico, which is guaranteed
and protected by the Mexican National |
Government The authorities appoint:
an official, known as the intervenor, j
who supervises all drawings of the '<
company, and an officer of the Treas- j
ury Department sees to it that the
prizes are paid to the persons who
hold the winning numbers. This in
sures to the patrons of the company j
that the drawings are honestly con* I
ducted and that the Institution is thor- !
oughly reliable. It is by reason of j
these facts that the Eeneficencia Pub- !
lica is so popular on this coast and :
lhat so many of its capital prizes are j
drawn here.
Mr. Adams spnt through Wells Fargo
Express to the office of Metzger <fe
Franklin. 85 Now Montgomery street. '
Ban Francisco, and received the $15,000
without annoyance or delay.
ARRESTED AT THE PRESIDIO.
A Condensed Milk Inspector of Oak-
land Is Found in Fort Point Ex
amining the Guns.
A man giving his name as Mcfullen
and claiming to be from Oakland was ar-
I yesterday noon at the Presidio un
der rather suspicious circumstances and
locked up in the guardhouse to wait a
furthor examination, which will be held
this morning.
It was shortly before noon when one of i
I the cavalry sentinels saw the man follow I
i one of the Presidio wagons as it drove '
into Fort Point, where are the big guns. ;
; The man had on civilian's clothes. This j
excited the sentinel's suspicion, and he ,
went into the fort and found McCullen !
apparently examining the guns. He at !
i once arrested him and took him before
! the officer of the day. The man claimed
to live in Oakland on Tenth street, and
j gave the number of the house. Lieuten
| ant Nolan telephoned the police of Oak
i land and found that there was no such i
number upon Tenth street as McCullen j
I gave.
McCullen paid that he was an Inspector j
;of condensed milk, but could give no i
' reason for being in the Presidio. It is !
thought that he has not good sense, as he
talks in a rambling and disconnected sort !
jof way. It was lirst reported that a !
i Spanish spy bad been arrested. The offl- j
I cers of the Presidio laugh at the idea of j
the man being a spy. for they consider j
him no more than a demented wanderer.
However, at the examination this morn- |
I ing, the condensed milk inspector will :
! have to give some good reason as to why j
he was prowling around the guns or else
serve time in "the guardhouse.
RIO DE JANEIRO IN PORT.
The Passengers Joyful Over the News
That War Is Declared.
The Pacific Mail Steamship Company's
steamer Rio de Janeiro reached port last
evening too late for the quarantine of
ficers to board her, so she anchored oiT
Alcatraz. The fifty-four cabin and fif
teen steerage passengers were eager for
war news, and when informed that war
had been declared expressed their ap
proval with cheers.
The steamer left Honolulu on the even
ing of the Hth instant. The rumor had
been freely circulated there that the
United States had decided to annex the
islands, and one of the passengers stated
that the papers had published the report
and it was accepted as a fact by every
one.
Dislikes His Attentions.
Gertrude Amsel, a singer in the Thalia,
swore to a complaint yesterday charging
Harry R. Bohm, an attorney, with dis
turbing the peace. He was arrested and
released on bonds. Miss Amsel states
that for months Bohm has annoyed her
with his attentions and persists in escort
ing her home at nights.

During tho Session Â»nd Success
Seems Assured.
The California Conference of the Ep
worth League Convention was formally
opened lust evening at Metropolitan Tem
ple in the form of a convention chorus.
All day long the artists had been at work
decorating the interior of the hall with
the league colors, white and scarlet, and
by the time the first note issued from 250
throats in the evening the hall was
turned into perfect harmony with the
surroundings.
For the past few days the members of
the league have been arriving in this
city from all points, and it can easily be
seen that the convention will be a suc
cess from all standpoints. The stage in
the temple presented a beautiful scene. A
chorus of 200 voices was assisted by Miss
Nellie Rogers, mezzo-soprano; Richard
Moyle, barytone; Armand Solomon, solo
violinist; H. Bretherick, organist; Mrs.
Murdock, pianist. The entire matter had
been left in the hands and under the su
pervision of the concert committee and
musical directors, Messrs. Robert Hus
band, J. J. Morris and W. C. Stadtfeld.
Early in the evening the hah was filled
to the doors, as every seat had been sold
and standing room was at a premium.
From now on the exercises will be held
in the Howard-street Church until the
last day of the convention, when the clos
ing exercises will be held In Metropolitan
Temple, where the convention was
opened.
The programme which was rendered
last evening was particularly well chosen.
It was as follows:

Away" Woodward

All day yesterday decorators were at
work preparing the Howard-street Church
for the exercises which will be held dur
ing the convention. During the afternoon
the registration committees were kept
busy, as every train from all points car
ried in memiiers of the organisation. It
is expected that over 700 delegates from
outside counties in the State will be in
attendance. The courtesy of the con
vention has been extended to the Chris
tian Endeavorers, Baptist Young People's

The Death of Colonel J. D. Stubbs.
Vice-President J. C. Stubbs of thÂ«
Southern Pacific Company received word
yesterday of the death of his father,
Colonel J. D. Stubbs, in Ashland, Ohio.
Colonel Stubbs was 79 years of Rge at
the time of his death, and had been a
resident of Ashland for many years,
though he was a native of Pennsyl
vania.
He fought all through the Civil War,
being at one time attached to the staff
of General Garfleld, and later on being
promoted to the head of the quartermas
ter's department in North Carolina with
the brevet of lieutenant-colonel.
At the conclusion of the war Colonel
Stufcbs entered the insurance business,
whle he acquired a fortune and retired
to devote the remainder of his life to
study and the quiet enjoyments of his
home. He was a man of deep learning,
being not only a lawyer of considerable
erudition but a profound theologian as
well. In life he was a man of great
charity and kindness of heart, and leaves
many friends on both the Atlantic and
Pacific coasts who will mourn his death.
The funeral will take place in Ashland
to-day. The deceased leaves a widow
and five children.
THE COAL CASFS.
A Demurrer to the Complaint of A.
Saumet Was Sustained by Cir
cuit Judge Morrow. ; â¢
United States Circuit Judge Morrow
yesterday sustained the demurrer of the
defendant in the suit of A. Saumet vs.
r<.. v. t^iuinuier of me uoai JJea.iers' As
sociation. Saumet complained that Chand
ler refused to sell him a load of coal at
a price lower than that fixed by the as
sociation. Chandler demurred to the
complaint on the ground that thfc com
plaint did not state a sufficient cause of
action, and that the specific statute al
leged to have been violated had not been
properly set up.
Robert Y. Hayne appeared for Chand
ler, and A. L. Black for Saumet. The
complainant was given ten days in which
to amend the complaint.
A Good Time at Loyola Hall.
The tenth anniversary celebration of
the Leo Assembly, Y. M. C. U., took
place at Loyola Hall last night and
proved an unqualified success. The hall
was crowded with the friends and rela
tives of the young gentlemen and a thor
oughly enjoyable time was had by every
one who was present. The festivities
commenced at 9 o'clock, but it was much
later than that before the tired merry
makers broke up and left for their homes.
AY. C. Billington and J. J. Lynch acted
as a committee of arrangements, and
the way they attended to the duties of
their office caused many a complimentary
criticism to be passed.

GOVERNOR BUDD WILL LEAD THEM
GOVERNOR BUDD, commander-in-chief of the military and naval forces of the
State, had quite a conference yesterday afternoon at National Guard headquar
ters, in the California Hotel, with Major-General Dickinson, Adjutant-General
Barrett and Brigadier-General Warfield. The Governor was momentarily expecting
to receive intelligence by wire that the President had issued a call for troops. There
was a deal of conjecture among the staff officers assembled in a room adjoining the
conference as to California's quota under the call.
After the conference the Governor was asked by a Call reporter if any plans
had been adopted for calling out the National Guard. The Governor replied that he
could not definitely state what the action would be until he knew the number of troops
that the President would call for from this State. Whether volunteers would be
enrolled or the existing organizations of the National Guard called out could not
be determined until the provisions of the act of Congress were known. On this
point the Governor remarked :
"If California should be asked to send iooo infantry soldiers I should in
stantly reply that a regiment of that number, with such equipment as the troops now
possess (designating the equipment), was at the disposal of the President. Should
there be only one regiment called for, I might decide to order one company from
each of the existing regiments of the National Guard to be sworn into the service
of the United States, and thus form the regiment. This would give National Guards
men the preference, without giving special preference to any particular regimental
organization. The vacancies in the existing regiments would be slight and easily
filled, therefore the organization of the National Guard would be retained at its
present strength. I should select to command the regiment for United States service
the officer best fitted for that duty, regardless of his present rank. Company com
manders would be so selected.
READY ANSWER TO MERCY'S CALL
THE appea! for the starting of a ]
sanitary commission, Its badge

its motive love of country and of
the brave boys now on their way
to the front, has touched the
common heart There will be no lack
of volunteers. Women are eager to do |
whatever they may to show that they j
are as patriotic, as those to whom it |
may be given to carry arms. With an |
equal courage they are ready to go to j
the scene of war, to face every danger, j
They are brave and tender and true.
On many a battle-field, in countless hos

and they are ready now to answer any !
summons. The women who watched j
tearfully the soldiers of the First In- j
fantry march away, who wore the na- j
tional colors, were not there from any I
Idle impulse.
There are practical features to be j
considered. First of all is organiza- '
tlon. Nothing can be done at random,
and there is no time to lose. Until the
commission can assume shape, until it
can be shown what needs to be contrib
uted, what service is available, to |
â¢whom to offer It, there can be nothing i
accomplished beyond keeping alive the j
sympathy which has taken hold upon j
the people. This will not be difficult, '
for every rumor of an engagement or
Of the prospect of one will fan Into j

It is probable that the National
Guard of California will be called al- |
most in a body to follow the regulars to i
the peril of foreign war on a shore :
made more hostile by lurking malady, j
The guard needs much it has not. I
There is a demand for a dozen ambu- !
lances and for surgical appliances for '

will cost considerable money. The

first the commission will have to meet, i
Ways in which funds can be secured j

There must be cots and bi d Ilnfe. There
must be those who adniiiiister to the
Bick and the wounded, receive the mes
sage of the dying, with gentle hand
place water to fevered lips. But to do
this requires all the fortitude of the
poldier. all the devotion of the patriot.
Buch fortitude and such devotion are
attributes of womanhood. Naturally
the women will have a prominent part
to play In the preliminary steps and
they are waiting now for direction.
They attest their willingness unani
mously. They are eager to show how
sincerely they love the honor of the
country.
Men who cannot go In the ranks, who
have no sword to offer, may still have a
part to do. The commission will afford
them the opportunity Nobody who
deserves thf> shelter of the flag will de
cline to assist in such humble part as
may fall to him to sustain its honor.
To help by word and deed and dollar
is a privilege d<-rii<-d to none. So gen
eral has been, the indorsement of the
plan that there promises at first to be
almost an embarrassment of suggestion
of proffers; but out of the confusion of
abundance will spring a potent body to
be an instrumentality for robbing war
of a portion of its horrors, Inspired by
unselfish affection, hoping for no re

WHY THE FLAG OF THE RED CROSS WAVES
I thought of the peninsula In McClellan's campaign, of Pittsburg Land-
Ing. Cedar Mountain and the second Bull Run, Antletam and old Freder-
Jrksburg, with Its acres of snow-covered and gun-covered glace, of lta
dead and -starving wounded, frozen to the ground; of the Petersburg mine,
with Its four thousand dead and wounded, and no flag of truee â the wound
ed broiling in tlie July sun, dying and rotting where they fell. I remem
bered our prison?, crowded with starving men, whom all the powers and
pities could not reach even with a crumb of bread; I thought of the shad
ows on the hearths and hearts all over my countryâ sore, broken hearts,
ruined, desolate homes! And then the picture of the Red Cross In Europe
came to me, the memory of its glorious workâ no needless suffering, no
starving or lack of care wherever that little flag was unfurled; and I said

The fleeting centuries have proved it
even so.
THE RED CROSS.
The Humane Society Had
Its Inception in Switz
erland.
The honor of founding the Red Cross '
Society belongs to Henri Dunant, a |
Swiss gentleman, who witnessed the
horrors of the battle of Solferino In
1859, and afterward Interested a promi
nent humane society of Geneva in the j
work of ministering to wounded sol- |
diers.
Previous to this the chief efforts in j
this line were those of the Immortal ;
Florence Nightingale, In the Crimea, j
Since the labors of Dunant the Red !
Cross has extended to nearly every civ
tlized nation, embracing the best prin- j
ciples of social science as well as the !
true philosophy of mercy.
The first international conference, '
called as a result of the observations
of Dunant, convened at Geneva In 1863,
Its purpose being to induce modern na- j
tions to take measures to alleviate the i
horrors of war. Representatives of six-,
teen nations, of which this country was
not one, assembled and drafted the out- j
line of the plans.
In 1864 the council at Geneva ratified '
the treaty. This was signed by nearly
every civilized nation except the Uni- !
ted States, which was the thirty-second !
and last country to sign the convention.
This was owing to the stupidity and
inability of one man, a subordinate in
the Department of State.
The work of the Red Cross Society i
has been marvelous from the day of
its birth. The British branch rendered
great aid to the Germans and French
in the great war of IS7O. The Societe
de Seco-urs aux Blesses, which is the
French branch of the Red Cross, was
effective in its work at the same time, ',
seconded ably by the same orders from 1
Vienna and Buda Pesth. In spite of
the reverses and horrible suffering of
thla bloody war all these societies came ,
out strengthened and enco-uraged by i
the work.
The Red Cross Society of Russia ren
dered great aid in the Balkan provinces
in 1876-78, where one branch of the or- >
der alone furnished 50,000 beds to the ;
wounded. Like effective work has been i
done by the societies of Italy and Den
mark. In Turkey the same order is
in existence under the name c.-f the
Red Crescent. It has done Just as ef
fective work as the bearers of the
; cross, as all are actuated by the broad
! est spirit of humanity, and all work
under the terms of the same interna
i tional treaty.

Help? Of course I will. Who will
not? Every woman living who took
part in that first meeting called In old
Dr. Scott's church will do what she can
â if she be strong enough.
The same plan should be followed to
day. I think, that was followed thirty
five yearsmgo. Let a meeting be called
You'll see how the people will respond.
There's nothing closer to their hearts
than this. I know how it was in the

was during the Civil War. It will bÂ»>

MRS. JAMES O. CLARK.
President King's Daughters.
THE prevailing cry is
"War"; on every side
we encounter enthusi- 4
astic and loyal citizens H
eager and yearning to fol- 4
low the brave "Boys in
blue" who already are on .
their way to war and vie-
tory, and who grasp this 4
chance of showing their 4
patriotism to Uncle Sam. 4
But what of the women "]
Anxious and fond mothers
plead with their young and
excited sons to be careful, -
and as they take their last, -
maybe eternal, farewell, *
the mother gives' her boy "
her blessing and asks God "â 
to protect him as he will "
protect his country; sisters see their noble brothers depart, and with choked voices beg them be brave
and strong, and if they never return to remember that loving hearts y^n forever cherish their heroic
acts.
But all the women are not of the same temperament, nor do all of them fear the war god in
the same terrible way. Many there are among the gentler sex whose hearts throb and pulses beat
with the march of the men and whose earnest desire is to doâ to actâ to help. How can the poor
wounded soldiers help themselvesP How can they feel the want t 0 battle again, if gentle and lov
ing hands do not quiet their pains and soothe their anguishP But what a stirring on to glory if the
administrations of kind nurses count for aught.
Still, when war is in progress, where are we to go for the nurs In whom are we to depend,
except on the few brave, yet perhaps untrained women whose love of country conquers their ignorance
and leads them to the field of action P
When the call for "arms" is issued thousands of trained men are ready to answer the summons,
thoroughly equipped and prepared for duty; when the call for nurses is raised, only a limited number
of untutored but patriotic women can answer. Unfortunately, there are but few Joan of Arcs to-day
and there are still fewer qualified to fill a position like unto hers.
Why, then, not start a society for the education of the nurses under the direction of the League
of the Red Cross? Why should they not be equipped thoroughly and wellP Why should we expect
less from those who are to nurse the soldiers back to life and vigor than from those educated them
selves at West PointP
Now, then, is the time to begin. The war, precipitated as it has been, by the destruction of the
Maine, but hovering over our heads for the past three years, is inevitable. To victory we must go,
a a * but many lives of our '
noble and our brave must 4
be sacrificed, while others 4
must suffer the tortures 4
and tormentt; of wounds 4
and loss of limbs. Nurses 4
we must have, and skilled 4
ones we must insist upon, 4
so now we appeal to those 4
who will enlist under the *
direction of the League of *
the Red Cross â those who
are willing to be educated â *
in the service of alleviat-
ing the pangs of the ~]
wounded soldiers â those *
who are willing to sacrifice .

for the glory of their coun- 4
try, for the hope of the fu- 4
ture, for America forever. 4
NURSES ARE READY.
San Francisco, Cal., April 21. 1898.
Editor of The Call: We have read
your proposition about forming a San
itary Commission. Weâ all nine of usâ
are regular graduates of the Children's
Hospital. We've been specially trained,
and we hereby offer our services through
you to the commission. Each of us has
her diploma, which testifies that we're
competent to deal with the fever and
the wounds which will do more toward
killing our soldiers than Spanish bul
lets. Each of us has had years of ex
perience since we left the hospital. We
are willing and anxious to go on to
Cuba, As soon as the commission is
formed we will be ready.
NINE TRAINED NURSES,
i Graduates from the Children's Hospi-
I WOMAN'S CARE NEEDED.
More men died of blood-poteoning In
the Civil War than of gunshot wounds.
Out at the Woman's Hospital every
year we graduate fifteen nurses over
and above those we need for the hos
pital work, trained moat carefully In
antiseptic surgery. Their patriotism is
unbounded, and they, fortunately,
have something to offer their country.
Here is the opportunity for a sanitary
commission now. Of course I am in
favor of its establishment. And why
should we wait. I didn't believe that
war was coming-. It seemed impossible.
Hut now there is no longer hope for
peace, and we women must face things
as they are. A sanita.ry commission
should be formed immediately. All the
people â men and women â in San Fran
cisco who are in favor of it, and willing
to help, should issue a call for a meet
ing at which the commission will be
named. We can't act too soon. We
want to be ready the moment the first
gun Is fired.

I came to San Francisco Just after the
war was over, but the Sanitary Com

The Red Cross a Welcome
Symbol to Every
Race.
In every land that has been per
meated by civilization the red crosa or
. "If the call of the President and the law for calling into service troops for the war
shall permit I shall give the members of the National Guard the first opportunity to vol
unteer. If the Government desires, the State will equip the troops with clothing, blankets,
tents, wagons and everything else required for an active campaign. The extent of equip
ment supplied by the State will depend entirely on the desires of the General Govern
ment. The State Board of Examiners can meet at once and authorize the creation of a
deficiency for the maintenance of the National Guard. There will be no delay in provid
ing the necessary means. The Government reimburses a State for money advanced to
place troops in readiness for service. If arms of a pattern better adapted to the service
than the present rifles shall be needed, the Government may supply such arms. If the
Government wants to take the troops and equip them, well and good.
"If the National Guard of California, as a division, is called into active service I
shall," said the Governor, "as commander-in-chief, go with the troops. I understand Gen
eral Dickinson desires to go and may receive a commission from the President to com
mand volunteers. We are ready to respond with the National Guard as an organization or
to furnish the President with one, two, three, four or more regiments of volunteers. We
can furnish infantry to serve as artillery if such service is required. A more definite state
ment cannot be made now because we are not informed regarding the bill pending in
Congress, and do not know how many troops the President may call for and what limita
tions he may prescribe. General Barrett has now established his headquarters in San
Francisco. He has made all the necessary preparations for putting the troops in the field
at the shortest notice." Later in the day an informal meeting of the military authorities
was held, at which Governor Budd, Adjutant-General Barrett and General Dickinson
were present. The conference took place in the office of General Dickinson in the Mills
building. General Dickinson on his own motion ordered sentries placed on the Marion
at this port and also on the Pinta at San Diego.
the red crescent Is to-day the sign of
mercy and humanity.
Organized by the immortal Henri j
Dunant, an illustrious son of the Swiss
republic, after he had witnessed the
horrors of shot and shell at the battle
of Solferino in 1859, the work of mercy
was brought to this country by Miss
Clara Barton, who is to-day presi
dent of the American branch of the in
ternational society.
Wherever the red cross Is emblazoned
on a flag of white it is the sign of mer
cy and humanity, the badge of protec
tion and neutrality. It gives the sol
dier hope, alleviates the sufferings of
the wounded and places water to the
lips of the dying.
James G. Blame, astonished that this
nation was so late insignlng a treaty
that granted immunity to the angels
of mercy that bore the flag of human
ity, listened to the eloquence of the
illustrious Clara Barton after her re
turn from Europe, where she had seen
the glory of the red cross. Garfleld j
commended it and Arthur finally sign- j
ed the treaty that enrolled this nation i
in the lists of those who- love their fel
low men.
And wherever that fla* of snowy
white, marked with a cross of red
waves over the horrible scenes of war
It is a benison of peace, a sign of the
love of man for man, a benediction and
a promise to the wounded and dying
whatever their color, race or creed '
SOONER THE BETTER.
In my opinion the sooner a Sanitary
Commission is formed the better. I can
answer only for myself, personally, at
present, but I shall bring the matter
before the Daughters of the Revolu
tion, and I am sure their feeling in the
matter will be the same as mineâ as
all women's.
Surely every woman in San Fran
cisco will willingly help. At such a
time one can neglect every other duty,
for this call to help the soldiers, to mit
igate their suffering, is the highest, thÂ«
worthiest. MRS. A. S. HUBBARD,
Regent Daughters of the American
Revolution.
IT IS A NECESSITY.
I believe that the formation of a San
itary Commission is a necessity; and if
such a commission be formed I shall
gladly do everything in my power to
assist. ALICE M. STINCEN,
Principal Pacific Heights School.
HELP ASSURED.
I approve of the plan of San Fran
cisco's men and women forming a Sani
tary Commission, which will ameliorate
the condition of our soldiers in the ap
proaching war with Spain. If the com
mission is formed I shall help.
MRS. LOUIS SLOSS,
1500 Van Ness avenue.
SMOOTH THE SOLDIER'S
LOT.
I do approve, heartily, of a Sanitary
Commission whose duty It shall be
to smooth the soldier's hard lot. I don't
believe the war with Spain will be a
long one. I hope that it will be short
and decisive. But we needed a sani
tary commission during the Civil War
and I believe we should have one now.

COL. GREENLEAF
ENTHUSIASTIC.
The New Assistant Sur
geon-General Strongly
Favors the Move
ment.
One of the most enthusiastic friends
of The Call movement for the organiza
tion of a large Red Cross auxiliary on
this coast is Colonel Charles R. Green
leaf, just appointed assistant surgeon'
general of the United States army by
General Miles and assigned to duty as
chief surgeon of armies in the field.
In his new duties Colonel Greenleaf
will have charge of all regular military
hospital corps, as well as of all auxil
iary aid which, under the laws of Con
gress, must be regulated by the sur
geon general and his staff in order to
obtain all the advantages of the treaty
as regards neutral rights. Speaking of
The Call's enterprise and the general
purposes of the Red Cross society Col
onel Greenleaf said:
"This is a magnificent undertaking,
embracing the most humane ideas of
modern civilization. I hope you will
succeed to the fullest possible extent,
for it is hard to tell how much service
of this character will be needed. It is
safe to say that no regular provisions
for the wounded and sick will be able
to afford the relief needed. In such
emergencies the aid of those who vol
unteer under the beautiful society
which Miss Clara Barton really found
ed in this country will be most valu
able.
"It is almost impossible to estimate
the great number who are likely to be
wounded under modern warfare. New
guns are so powerful that it is the gen

eral opinion that there will be a larger
percentage of wounded than in any
previous battles of the world. If this
prophecy turns out to be weh founded
it is easy to see that there will be great
need for such work as that of the Red
Cross Society, most of the field mem
bers of which will be stationed at what
we call base hospitals rather than on
the actual Held of battle.
"Under the Geneva treaty the red
cross is the badge of neutrality, by
which I mean that all persons con
nected with the medical departments of
armies, as well as all materials used in
ministering to the sick and wounded,
are considered exempt. The diplomats
who arranged the treaty felt that it
would be wise to make the exemption
include voluntary contributions from
patriotic citizens interested in the hu
manities and authorized the Red Crosa
Society to work on the battlefield under
the general control of the hospital de
partment of the army. The movement
in this country is due to the untiring
energies of Miss Clara Barton, who in
duced Congress to adopt the plans by
law and sanction the work of the so
ciety.
"The movement is one of the most
humane possible, and it should be re
membered that all voluntary contri
butions in aid of the wounded and sick
must come through the channel thus
provided by law in order to be given
all the benefits of neutrality â in other
words, that they may reacii those for
whom intended. All these societies are
subject to the call of the medical de
partment of the army. I cannot think
of anything more patriotic and humane
for any woman stirred by such im
pulses to do than join the Red Cross
Society."
Colonel Greenleaf says that the Na
tional Guards of this State are ad
mirably organized under Surgeon-Gen
eral Hopkins of the National Guards.
The organization of hospital corps in
tho regular army was effected by
Colonel Greenleaf in 1887. He has
been professor of military hygiene at
the State University for several years
and has been in San Francisco since
1893 in charge of the military supplies
of the Pacific.
Colonel Hopkins joined the army on
the 19th of April, IS6I, and his ap
pointment to the new position came a
day after the anniversary of his thirty
seventh year in the army.NINE STRAIGHT

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 22, 1898.
CROSS WILL
NOW RETURN
To Again Appear as the
Coach on Stanford
> Gridiron.
Students Glad to Secure the
Leader Who Trained Them
Two Years Ago.
Since Leaving Here the Noted Yala
Athlete Has Married, so He Comes
Back With a Wife.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PALO ALTO, April 21.â Harry P.
Cross of Yale will again appear as
coach on the Stanford gridiron. The
announcement was made to-night by i
Manager trichard that the well-known '
center wh i coached the famous team j
at '96, which defeated the Berkeley ;
eleven by the then astounding score '
of 20 to 0, had been secured. He will j
arrive at Palo Alto about September |
15, when work on the' gridiron will be
gin.
A number of considerations influ
enced the football management in
choosing Cross. There is general sat
isfaction among the faculty and stu
dents with his work of two years ago.
His iiitluonce on the team will be good.
Besides, he is an athletic enthusiast, J
who does what he can for college ama
teur sport, with which he is still closely
identified. While in charge of the "96
team he devoted himself to developing
the line, with what result the scores
c-f the past two years will tell. His
conscientious work and the spirit which
he infused Into the players left its Im
pression on the student body, and
makes his recall generally satisfactory.
Cross entered Yale with the class of
'96. His first experience in 'varsity
football was acquired as guard in the
second eleven against such players as
Hickok and McCrea, He was soon re
moved to center and succeeded Stillman
in that position in 1895, when the Yale
'varsity eleven defeated Princeton by a
score of 20 to 10. Cross while in Yale
had the advantage of Camp's instruc
tion. He thoroughly understands Yale
methods and has been following the
game closely since graduation. Besides
having won glory as a football-player,
< Iross has a claim to athletic renown in
other branches. During the entire col
lege course he was a member of the
track team in hammer-throwing. Since
coaching the '96 team Cross has mar!
! ried. He will bring his wife to the
coast with him.
Bead in next Sunday's Call what
President Patton of Princeton Uni
versity has to say about the Pigmy
Poets and second-rate statesmen of
the present era.

PATRIOTISM ON
THE DIAMOND
The Big Attraction at
Recreation Park To-
Morrow.
Teams of the California League
Do Considerable Bracing
Up.
Trouble in the Gilt Edge Ranks Not
Yet Adjustedâ Hugheb 1 Work at
Baltimore.
The baseball game at Recreation Park
to-morrow afternoon between Oakland
and Stockton of the California League
promises to attract a great crowd, ap
pealing as it does to the patriotism of
the people at this particular time. Many
of the enlisted men of the First Infantry
and the two light batteries of the Third
Artillery, that have gone to the front, left
families behind who will find themselves
in straitened circumstances.
The league directors have voted to
donate the entire receipts to the families
of these soldiers, including the bar and
other privileges. All the employes, um
pires, Kate keepers, ticket sellers, score
card venders, etc., have volunteered their
services for the occasion, so that every
cent taken in at the gate will be de
voted to the object intended. The field
officers of the First Infantry, N. G. C,
comprising Colonel J. F. Smith, Lieuten
ant-Colonel V. D. Duboee and Major
Charles Boston, C. L. Tllden and H. T.
Sime, have agreed to act as custodians
of the fund and to see that it is properly
distributed.
The bleachers will be given over to the
school children, who will bo granted a
special rate of admission of 5 cents. The
Board of Education has granted permis
sion to the managers to distribute hand
bills among the schools and this morn
ing a small "dodger/ 1 setting forth the
objects of the game, will be laid on the
ih-sk of every pupil in the city.
Colonel Robinson has provided some
striking features that will arouse the en
thusiasm to the highest pitch. The mag
nificent band of the Third United States
Artillery, stationed at Angel Island, has
given its services, and a few minutes be
fore the game is called the band will es
cort a platoon from one of the heavy
batteries of that regiment to the big nag
pole over by tin- left licld fence. There
a field piece will be In readiness, and, as
the stars and BtrJpes are run aloft, the
artillery m--n will lire a national salute
to the colors, accompanied by patriotic
airs.
A detail from Colonel Smith's regiment
will probably assist in the ceremony,
which promises to be of thrilling interest
in these piping times of war.
The Sacramento Bee of last evening
published a statement signed by Manager
Hennessy of the Gilt Edge team, to the
effect that the differences with his men
had been adjusted and that the team
would continue intact in the Pacific
States League. Underneath this was a
statement from live of the players that

no agreement had been reached and none
would be.
In partial proof of this latter statement,
the announcement is made that Lockhead
has signed a contract with Stockton of
the California league to captain that
team and play short This plug's up about
the only weak spot in the Terror's make
up. It is reported that other members of
the Gilt Edges will jump to the rival
league before lonrj.
Manager McGlynn of the San Joses,
California League team, has secured a
brace of south paws, who, he thinks, will
paralyze opposing batters. Wheeler, his
mainstay, who belongs to the Third Ar
tillery, found it inconvenient to belong to
an out of town team just now, so Mc-
Glynn reluctantly sold him to Manager
Bunker, and signed Thiessen and Foun
tain. The former has pitched for the Cali
fornia Cyclers' Club, and both are most
effective. McGlynn has also signed a new
catcher to receive Thiessen, whose name
is Cunha. lie weighs 240 pounds, and is
said to be one of the fastest men in the
game. Ford will be Fountain's battery
mate. Williams, who played the opening
game with the Fiorists, and made a fav
orable impression, has finally signed a
contract, and will cover short fur Mc-
Glynn in the game at Stockton next Sun
day. Hall, the Bay City's big catcher,
has also been hired to play second for
the florists. The acquisitions give Mc-
Glynn a chance to play his regular out
fielders in their natural positions, and
make the team one of the strongest ever
got together in this State.
The Fresno Tigers have also been doing
some bracing, if reports are true. Mc-
Laughlin and Kelly have been released
i and Van Horn and Farren signed in their
places. But the greatest gain lies in
Hanlon and McCarthy of the San Joso
Pacific League, who are said to have
i signed Fresno contracts. Both men are
heavy stickers and good all-around play-
I ers.
Not to be outdone by the others, Man-,
ager Bunker has been gathering in some
new material. In addition to Pitcher
Wheeler who comes to him from San
Jose, he has signed another twlrler, whose
name he does not care to divulge at pres
| ent, and a short stop named J. Tren-Â»
1 berth. Pitcher Murphy and Whalen have
| been released to make room for the new
comers.
McGlynn has appointed Sykes captain
of the Florists. The elongated first base
| man is one of the best Held generals in
the State and will soon have his men
working In harmony.
A few of the Fresno people became un
duly excited in the last half of the ninth
inning last Sunday, and accused I'm
pir<3 W. F. Long of robbing the Tigers
,by calling a long drive a foul. The de
cision was Just and the managers of the
i Tigers admitted to Long that he acted
throughout with entire impartiality.
Mertea is reported to have jumped the
local team of the Pacific States League
and gone to Columbus.
Hughes, who pitched for the Gilt Edge
team last season, has signed with the
1 Baltimore Club. He was put in against
; the Senators the other day and shut them
i out with two hits. Only four of the op
l>"sing team reach! lirst during the
j game. Manager Hanlon says Hughes is
us good a man as Corbett,. and he doesn't
care if "Brother Joe" does decide to re
main in California.
"Smiler" Hopkins, the Beachcombers'
importation from the Western League, is
putting up a fast game. He is a fair bats
'â  man and a No. 1 fielder.
As a drawing card Santa Cruz leads the
teams of the Pacific States League. They
attracted the largest crowd of the season
at Pan Jose last Sunday.
Santa Cruz meets the Gilt Edges next
Sunday. This will be the first time these
two teams have faced each other.

?M> â  ' >'- v v ' ' ' â  ;,â  â¢â â¢""â¢.-. â  , ;
trouble the doctors didn't understand. He told me the story
himself. "I kept getting weaker," said he. "and fairly got so
weak my food done me no good, what little I did eat, and I
went from 135 pounds down to 98." It was the druggist who
suggested that he try Ripans Tabules, and he says that he had
not used a dozen of them before he felt much better, and after
a month he was cured sound and well, and in less th.-m a year
"weighed 150 pounds. For a long time he had a bud color, but
to-day his complexion is as good as mine-

SPANISH BONDS.
The circular of Henry Clews, the New York
banker, pays:
In the Â»-vent of Spain going to war with
this country it will certainly be impossible for
her to: raise money by the sale of her bonds,
as they have already gone down to 424. and
in the event of hostilities they will go down
to probably 25 or less. [They were 34 yester
day.-tid.] She will therefore naturally aban
don ambition to keep up her national credit,
and hence Interest on her outstanding obliga
tions will be sure to be defaulted on. This
amounts to about $100,000,000 a year, which she
will nave for wax purposes. Contributions and
forced revenue from the people will be one of
the processes resorted to to carry on the war.
Spain will he in a position similar to that of
a bankrupt railroad, which makes a bad foe
for a solvent competitor. A railroad In the
hands of a receiver pays out nothing except to
keep the maJ In repair, and can make forced
loans besides through receiver's certificates au
thorized by court, which become a first claim
against the road, to provide for pay rolls and
expenses to keep the mad In fighting condition
âostensibly to be in a safe condition 10 pre
vent a sacrifice of life. A weak railroad can
therefore cut rates so low as to Inflict serious
Injury to a strong competitor if it continues
the light long enough. While Spanish 4's at
present price (42%) yield 94 per cent interest.
I'nlted States 4 - h (at 121) yield only 2% per cent
Interest, and, notwithstanding the wide differ
ence in the market price of the two securities,
X'nited States bonds are infinitely the cheap
est and most desirable for an Investment, be
rause the principal and Interest are absolutely
secure under any circumstances, whereas, in
the evf-nt of war, Spanish bonds will certainly
be made absolutely Insecure, If not worthless.

barometric pressure and Is usually accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
. . - , .â .[â¢â ll., .-...--.â ..
r^mv YORK. April 21.â ThÂ«rÂ« has been an
Influential party In the Stock Exchange, repre
senting a large following of security holders,
which has held tenaciously to the view that
war waÂ» by some means to be averted. Even
the events of this week, up to to-day, seemed
to fall to convince this element that Spain
would retain this attitude in the face of the
demands and the show of force by the Presi
dent. The flrmnews Imparted by the refusal
of this element to sell gave rise to the opinion
in many quarters that the market had al
ready amply discounted the actual event of
war, but to-day's events apparently convinced
the conservative element that war is to be a
fact, and demonstrated that the liquidation
incident to war had by no means been completed.
Early in the day New Tork held above the
London parity, and there were occasional ral
lies, even afur the receipt of the news that
General Woodford had been given his pass
ports, but reports from the Cabinet meeting
at Washington indicating preparations for an
immediate forward movement of the armed
forces of the United States, showing that war
already practically existed, caused selling. Tne
brokers on the floor of the exchange mani
fested considerable enthusiasm and the ros
trum waa handsomely draped witn American
flags, but they continued to sell stocks. Some
very heavy blocks were thrown over during
the final hours and everything went to show
that these were In liquidation of long hold
ings, pur* and simple. Such market leaders
as Burlington, St. Paul, L. and N. and N.
Y. Central fell 3 points below last night's close.
There was no rally In the final dealings, the
market continuing active and weak and clos
ing at the lowest. During the early part of
thÂ« day selling for foreign account was large
and offerings were well absorbed. The num
ber of shares sold for this account is estimated
at 36,000. This continued selling of our se
curities by London doubtless had its influence
In the day's advance of V* In the rate for de
mand and sterling bills, joined in this foreign
polling there waa a continued stiffness in the
rates for money at foreign centers, reflected
in a further decline In British consols and
French rentes.
The day's engagement of gold for import,
nevertheless, ran up to over J1, 000,000 again.
Call loans continued to be made on the local
Stock Exchange as low as 2 per cent. For
eign demand for cotton and breadstuff* con
tinues very keen and is making exchange all
the time. This demand Is based on the ex
pectation that supplies may be cut off If war
breaks out.
The bond market showed Rome increased in
activity and losses were recorded all around
Total sales. 11.625.000.
United States new 4's registered advanced
in. while the coupons of the same Issue de
clined % in the bid price. There were pales
of the coupon at IIBV4, which Is an advance
of tfc over the last preceding sale, but the ad
vance was lost on subsequent sales.

LONDON MARKET.
NEW TORK, April H.â The Evening Post's
financial cablegram Bays: After a temporary'
rally on change In the Bank of England's
discount rate the sto^k markets here closed
dull to-day. The Spanish 4s closed at the low- !
est, 31"i. There was a further sharp break in
Argentines on the news recounted In these
dispatches yesterday. Americans were flat, but
above the New York parity. It is noticeable
that New York is no longer absorbing storks
freely. There was a sharp break In Canadian
Pacific, mainly on New York selling, but tho
stock was freely sold at Berlin. Gold is still
arriving from Germany, and it is expected that
at least Â£1,000,000 more Is to come.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, April 21.â Provisions, not grain.
led the way to-day on 'change. The excellent
cash demand for hog products and the ex
pected call to supply the army and navy In- j
fluenced speculators to load up with pork, lard ;
and short ribs. Outside buying orders were
I more numerous than at any time since 1893.
I At the end July pork showed an advance of
: 67c per barrel. * Lard and ribs gained 274@30c
I each. July pork opened 30c higher, but the ;
advance met with miscellaneous selling and
prices sharply declined. At Inside figures, how-
I ever, the urgent demand prevailed, and as ,
i offerings were made there was considerable â 
I competition for them, resulting in a "run- ;
away market" and a sharp advance In prices â 
I for all descriptions.
Shorts bougnt freely in wheat. Lard and ribs
advanced proportionately to pork, ail closin* ;
at about top prices. â .-.-';>
There was a revulsion of feeling to-day at i
the opening among wheat traders from the
extreme bearishness that prevailed in the last
hour of yesterday's session. It did not last
long after the opening and was succeeded by j
a fresh spasm of lowness. The strength at i
the start was partly the result of discovering j
i the ridiculousness of the Rothschild canard j
j that Feared thÂ« holders of long wheat the \
I previous afternoon, and that a state of war j
, virtually existed. In addition to this the Liv- j
I erpool market was again higher. The reac- !
j tion that followed the opening bulge was the re- j
newed expression of the prevailing sentiment
j among the local heavy operators that wheat ,
i Is very much too high in view of the fine pros
pect for next harvest. The market gathered
strength from the higher quotations from
Minneapolis and by 12:30 p. m. recovered the
early break. Closing cables from Liverpool j
phowed an advance of Id in spot wheat. July :
j rose to 89\4c, closing at 89c bid. May sold be- t
I tween Jl 114 and II 12. closing at the top.
Corn deceived the local talent. July opened
higher, with wheat, but was set upon by the
bears and forced off He.
Oats followed the course of. corn. July
closed %c higher than yesterday.

THE PLAN IS LEGAL.
City Attorney Dow Upholds the Pro-
posed Classification of Streets.
OAKLAND, April 21.â City Attorney
Dow presented the Street Committee of
the City Council with his official opinion
to-night regarding the proposed ordinance
classifying the various streets as main,
thoroughfares, business and residence
streets. This is in answer to objection;
raised by attorneys for contracting com
panies, the first of which Is that only m
decision of a court could tell to whir.,
class any street belongs. To this Mr.
Dow replies:
In my opinion. there is no merit In this ob
jection. The classification Is simply for the
purpose of directing the City Council In its Be;
iei-tlcn of the specifications to be made appli
cable to a iirop'.'sed Improvement, and that pur
pose accomplished, it will make no ference
whether or not. as a matter of fact, the par
ticular street In question properly belongs to
the class inuicnted. Ample authority is given
to the City Council by the general street law
to provide specifications for street work, anil
the Councils ik-tf-rmination as to â¢ he character
of specifications desirable for the proposed
work is conclusive.
The next question is in regard to the
Superintendent of Streets' authority, un-
Uer the proposed measure, to reject ma
terial. The opinion says:
Inasmuch as the general street law provides
that the work must be done to the satisfaction
of the Superintendent of Ktreets. it necessarily
follows that he may reject or condemn what
ever in hip judgment is not in accordance with
the contract and specifications, which determi
nation Is subject, of course, to review by the
City Council on appeal. I am of the opinion,
therefore, that the provision of the proposed
ordinance In this particular is entirely con
fcistent with the general law.

ARE IN CONFLICT
WITH WHITHER
Officials Not Anxious to
Be Relieved of
Wards.
The Swift Home Refused a
Permit to Keep a
Girl.
A Terse Telegram Is Received at
the District Attorney's
Office.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 21.
A strained relationship exists between
Mrs. Swift of this city and the super
intendent of the Reform School at Whit
tier. Mrs. Swift is a philanthropic lady
of means who believes that more good
can be accomplished by personally deal
ing with wayward girls than can possi
bly follow a term at "Whittier.
With this idea in view Mrs. Swift, who
is backed by the Seventh-day Adventist
Association of this city, has started a
borne at Prultvale for the reclaimation
of girls wayward, but not necessarily
criminal. There is now under detention
in this county a girl less than 15 years
of age, who is under an order of tha
court t<> be sent to Whittier. Mrs. Swift
and her associates are of the opinion that
it would be a good opportunity to put
this girl in the Fruitvale Home rather
than let her go to Whittier. For this
purpose communication was had with
the officials at Whittier and it is under-
Btood that the District Attorney's office
urs in thtj course outlined by the
Oakland philanthropists. To the sur
prise of every one, however, a short tel
egram was received by the District At
torney from Whittier, which stated:
"& nd the girl here Immediately."
Mrs. Dr. Knox, a school director and
president of the Woman's Improvement
Club, is also interested In the Swift
li'>m>\ and when the contents of the dis
patch was made known to the lady
there was much indignation expressed.
"There is something in this 1 cannot
unerstand." said Dr. Knox this afternoon.
"We are told that the school at Wnittier
is bo crowded with boys and girls that
there is really no room for any more, yet
when a legitimate effort is made to re
lleve the pressure the effort is practically
refused. It is well known that a term
at W hittier is enough to condemn the fu
ture life of any young person. In the
Institution at l'ruitvale a girl would !jÂ«! jÂ«
under good care and influence, would be
-â¢: something and certainly, if re
formation wore possible, she would be
reformed. In the case under considera
tion Mrs. S'.vift has made application to
be appointed guardian of the girl. This
action is surely evidence of good faith oti
her part, and I cannot conceive why the
management at Whittier is opposed to
such an offer."
This morning the matter of the letters
of guardianship came up before Judge
Ellsworth and the matter was explained
to him, but owing to Borne witnesses be
ing absent the case was continued for a.
day or two. The court remarked that it
was not necessary to obtain the consent
of the Whittier officials, because the girl
could be ordered released on parole by
the court which committed her.

pine Watt and C. O. G. Miller.
OAKLAND, April 21.â One of the most
elaborate weddings ever held in this city

while Miss Elizabeth Watt and H. M. A.
Miller, a sister and brother of the con

nj dressed in yellow taffeta, with white
; Pilk and white insertion. She carried
i brides' roses.
After the ceremony and congratulations

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 22, 1898.
DR. MERRITT'S
TREASURES SOLD
Society Folks Bid for
Trunks of Old
Clothes.
The Warring Nephews Given
One Oil Painting
Apiece.
Pictures That Cost Thousands Are
Sold for the Smallest
Amounts.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 21.
If Dr. Samuel Merrltt did not turn under
his JoO.CK.tO mausoleum at Mountain View
this afternoon, then there is no connec
tion between the dead and the living.
His collection of oil painting's, over which
he spent years of travel, thousands of
dollars and much anxiety, were all dis
posed of for the comparatively insignifi
cant sum of about JSOO.
Before the sale commenced, Attorney
Genrge Reed, as representative of the
doctor's nephews, James and Fred Mer
ritt, selected "one picture each for the
boys. According to the will of Dr. Mer
ritt, the nephews were cut off with one
picture apiece, which they were to select.
fears have passed by and the nephews
have shown no desire to partake of their
uncle's bounty, and a few weeks ago the
court authorised Mr. Reed to have the
pictures sold and to make a choice for
the nephews.
For Fred Merritt, Mr. Reed selected a
picture of "Music," by Vignali. an ar
tistic painting:, the coloring of which
made it one of the most prominent in the j
collection. For James Merritt a copy of !
"The Virgin Child," by Raffaelo, was I
chosen. After this little proceeding the '
sale commenced. Among the crowd were !
many old friends of the doctor, but their
3hip did not extend to the length
of a desire to increase his estate by giv
ing high prices for his pictures. Dr." Mer
ritt had no idea of art, and there is no
doubt, in many instances, he was heavily
imposed upon. There was, however, a.
strong element of vanity in his make-up,
and three framed pictures of the deceased
formed a large portion of the gallery. One
of them, in a beautiful gilt frame, sold
for $1 50: another one for $6, while M.
Jonas paid J<* for a large oil painting of
the doctor in a splendid frame.
There was only one picture in the
whole that was really valuable.
It was "Ti;.- Miser," by Paulyn. Artists
present valued it at $250, and after the
auctioneer had yelled himself hoarse it
was knocked down for $18 to some one
who evidently did not know he had a
bargain. Major Fred Whitney was pres
ent, of course. The major attends every
old-horse sule in the same spirit that
others attend a horse race. He lays out
s.p much and takes his chances on what
he gets. To-day he bought an oil paint
ing of the yacht Casco for $8 50. which
â¢ ould be duplicated in any old sit? for
$1 7".. He alsn bought a copy of "Mag
dalena," of which the original by Carlos
is in the t'fHcci gallery at Florence.
For this the major paid $15.
Harry Gordon, another society leader,
purchased No. 43 on the catalogue.
ThLs number was a trunk of wearing ap-
Djarel. The bidding started at 50 cents,
and aft<"-r feeling the weight of the trunk
v f>w times to make sure there was some
thing in it Harry bid up to $8, at which
price he secured five pairs of Dr. Mer
ritt's old pants, a coat of the fashion of
1868, three apologies for hats, a bundle
of greasy neckties, one great register,
three and a half pairs of silk bocks, a
hunting case, an old pocket book and
four crushed cigars. These trunks, of
which there were two, have not been dis
turbed for twelve years, and their con
tents were generously mildewed.
Mrs. K. Encn bought about one-third of
the pictures at very low prices. Attorney
A. A. Moore paid J7 50 for a large paint-
Ing made in 1860 of the Merritt home
stead and Lake Merritt. The picture was
drawn so that nothing else is visible
but Dr. Merritt's late house, which at
that time was the only house in what i 3
now the Lakeside District.
Administrator Reed admitted after the
sal>- that he lost a bottle of wine on the
result. })>â  wagered that the total pro
ceeds would not be over JL' 1 " 1 ". whereas
nearly three times that .sum was secured
for the pictures, which probably cost the
doctor not less than $10,00&

MAY BROWSE
ON THE BOOKS
The Public Library Gives Free
Access to Ten Thousand
Volumes.
A Remarkable Innovation Which
ShowsTliat the Public Can
Bo Trusted.
The Free Library Is about to bloom
forth with an enterprising Innovation that
is almost as startling as it will be grati
fying to the many thousands who use it.
Beginning with Sunday 10,000 volumes
will be opened to the free and wholly un
restricted access of the public. People
may roam about the shelves and look over
the books without even having to deposit
a pasteboard check, and they will be
trusted to get their books charged at the
desk if they take one away. These 10,000
volumes will include the best and most
popular works of all classes intended for
general circulation, and may be taken
from the shelves to the reading tables as
taken for home use.
This Innovation is in line with the mod
ern tendency of public libraries toward
greater freedom of public use, and is
mainly due to the enterprising ideas and
efforts of Librarian George T. Clarke.
Association libraries like the Mechanics'
and the Mercantile here have long per
mitted trpe access to shelves, but this
places the San Francisco library in the
lead in this regard among public libraries
everywhere.
S< veral interesting experiments have
preceded the move. It was only three
years ago wh^n everybody who entered
the outer door had to take a big brass
check to be surrendered at the desk be
fore a book would be given out. That
was done away with as a mark of confi
dence in popular honesty. Two and a
half years ago 50fÂ»' juvenile books were
segregated and the children were al
lowed tn make selections direct from the
shelves. In twenty-one months, with a
circulation of 118,000 juvenile, but thirty
six volumes wore lost. Then the 12.H00
volumes in the five branches were opened
to pholf acopps. and there w<*re no books
reported missing. The shelves in the
ref< rence and periodical rooms were
opened to library readers, and then as
an experiment 800 books for general cir
culation were placed in the reference
room- where they could be looked over
and none disappeared.
All these things have slowly convinced
the trustees thai the book-using public
can be trusted. Last year ."71.500 volumes
were circulated and but thirty-one were
lost from all causes. It is expected that
the innovation will vastly increase the
popularity of the library, and the use of
Its 98,000 volumes, besides increasing the
use "f the Btandafd books. On account of
the changes to be made in the library
arrangement no books will be issued to
morrow.
ALONE AND HOMELESS.
Pitiable Condition of a Boy Who Ar-
rived Here From New Mexico.
Ragged and penniless Morris Ford,
aged 14 rears, last night applied at the
City Prison for shelter. To 1 >--sk Ser
geant Brown the unfortunate boy said ,
that lie bad arrived here yesterday fore
noon from New Mexico. His object in
coming to this city was to find his Bister,
who lie thinks lives somewhere on Ellis
street.
"The last time she wrote us," he tear
fully remarked, "sh<> informed us she was
living "ii Ellla street and was happily
married. A Short time ago my parents
died and I was left witlmut any money.
I determined to make an attempt to
reach this city in the hope of finding my
Bister. My poor mother t<>ld me she was
living somewhere on Ellis stret-t. and
after her death I resolved to locate her.
Being without money and friends, I con
cluded to make a desperate effort to
reach my sister in this city. Boarding
Thi- first train that left New Mexico, I
rode a considerable distance, when the
conductor, learning that I was without
a ticket, ejected me. After waiting for
some time, I boarded another train and
met with the same experience. Several of
the passengers evidently knowing of my
sad condition, save me a small sum of
money, which enabled me to reach the
nexi station.
"After being cuffed and kicked and sub
lected t" the most inhuman treatment, I
finally managed to reach this city."
To-day the police will endeavor to find
the sister of the boy.
THE CORONA WRECK.
Investigation Begun by the Local
Inspectors of Steam Vessels.
The United States inspectors of local
and foreign steam vessels have begun an
investigation into the grounding of the
Steamship Corona which ran on a reef
in British Columbian waters on January
23 of this y> ar.
G. H. Pierce, master of the Corona,
testified that the Corona struck at 7:12
a. m. She left Seattle January 20, bound
for Alaska, and touched at Victoria and
Port Townsend. The course was steered
rounding Watson Rock at fi:43 a. m., Jan
uary 23. At 6:M v. m. she was on her
course, magnetic north 42^ west, until
7:05 a. m. men her course was north
32 west by standard compass. 1 degree
easterly variation, and at northwest by
north it had no variation.
When she struck on the reef the wit
ness ordered the engine* reversed. Then
he ordered them stopped, and the bilges

INTERNAL REVENUE DECISIONS
Regulations Affecting Distillers Who
Have Suspended Operations
After Giving Due Notice.
Internal Revenue Collector Lynch has
been notified by the Treasury Depart
ment of the following decisions:
Distillers who have discontinued ope
rations, and without bond as distillers
and without holding requisite special tax
stamps as liquor dealers have sold their
distilled spirits, should be reported for
assessment of special tax and penalty.
The fact, however, that a person has
ceased to operate his distillery does not
prevent him from giving bonds as a dis
tiller there, with notice of continued sus
pension, to secure exemption from spe
cial tax fur selling his spirits in the orig
inal stamped packages at the distillery
or at the place of storage In bond.
Under the exempting provision of sec
tion 3246. Revised Statutes, it is held that
a manufacturer may sell wine at two
places without paying special tax as a
liquor dealer, viz: The place of manufac
ture and at a general business office else
where.
Internal revenue stamps are redeema
ble when owned and presented for re
demption by persons or their legal rep
resentatives authorized to purchase and
use them for the payment of taxes.
ROBBED HIS EMPLOYERS.
Arrest of Two Men on Three Charges
of Petty Larceny.
Detectives Tom Gibson and Egan last
night arrested Charles Schunucker and
Justine Porsic and booked them on three
charges of petty larceny each. Schunucker
is a clerk in the employ of the Crown
Paper Company.
For some time past the proprietors of
the concern have missed a number of
paper bags* and, suspecting wrong, they
notified the police. An Investigation re
vealed that the imprisoned clerk would
visk the factory before the other em
ployes arrived and allow Porsic. his ac
complice, to get away with as many bags
as he could conveniently carry. The lat
ter would then visit some patron of tne
company and dispose of the bags. It is
estimated that by these means the men
managed to rob the firm of several hun
dred dollars.
CUSTOMS DECISIONS.
Bonded Machinery for Kepairs, Ex-
port Tobacco Taxes and Useful
Qualities of Sheep Dip.
Collector of Customs Jackson was noti
fied yesterday of the following decisions
of the Secretary of the Treasury:
Bonded period of six months prescribed
for machinery imported for repairs un
der section 19, act of 1897, cannot be ex
tended.
Spanish Government in Cuba has abol
ished the export duty on cigars and cig
arettes and the 50 cents per thousand
stamp tax on the same.
Sheep dip. so-called, made from cresol
or cresylic acid, dead oil of coal tar. caus
tic soda, oleate of potash and other sud
stances combined with water, is not free
of duty, beinp extensively used as a dis
infectant, deodorizer and' antiseptic, and
also as a medicinal preparation in heal
ing or curing wounds, sores, diseases of
tho human and animal body, and for
other purposts.

WAS OFFERED
PAY TO LIE
A. A. Friedlander Swore
to an Attempt at
Bribery.
He Allowed Dick Williams to Be
Convicted Without Telling
What He Knew,
The Lawyer WÂ»s Asked to Furnish
a First-Class White Perjurer
for the Chinese.
The sensation of the Dick Williams J
triai yesterday in United States District
Judge de Haven's court was the injec
tion of a new and startling witness into i
the case.
This was A. A. Friedlsuider, an attorney
well known around the Police courts. Mr.
Friedlander swore that at the time of
Williams' conviction at the first trial of
the case he, Friedlander, was in the pos
session of evidence which, had it been ]
believed by the jury, would have resulted
in Williams' acquittaJ. Yet Friedlander '
kept this knowledge to himself, and told
not a living soul until he told Williams ;
about it a few days ago.
It was to the effect that Wong Sam,
the principaJ witness for the prosecution,
bad offered him (250 if he. Friedlander,
would furnish a white witness to swear
that Williams was accepting money for j
the landing of Chinese.
Friedlanaer Bwore that some time be
tween October 30 and January 1. 1895,
Wong Sam met him in front of a cigar
store in this city and said to him, he j
being a stranger to Friedlander at the
time: "I want to get a Chinese Inspector
removed, and if you will give me a white ,
witness to swear that this Chinese In- j
spector is taking money for landing Chi
nese 1 will give you $250." Two days
later he again nut Wung Sam, and Wong
Sam told him that the name of the in- |
Bpector whom the Chinese wanted re- :
moved was Williams.
On the cross-examination Deputy Unit- |
ed States Attorney Schleainger asked the i
witness whether VVong Sam had gone to ;
him because he thought that Friedlander
was the right man for the business of '
suborning perjury, and Lawyer Collins
for the defense objected. Judge de
Haven In overruling the objection point
edly remarked that he would allow the
broadest latitude to counsel in their ef- ;
forts to get at the truth.
The witness replied to Mr. Schleslnger
that he had an intimate friend in the Cus- ;
torn-house and that Wong Sam had been ]
recommended to him because of this fact.
That friend in the customs service was
not the defendant Williams.
"How did Wong Sam know this about
you? " asked Mr. Schlesinger.
"Bccausys my friends mentioned my j
name."
"Why didn't you appear at the last
trial and tell those things?"
The witness replied that he was very |
busy at the time and that he was not
feeling well. In fact, he was confined to
his house.
"Didn't you have writing materials
there?"
"Yes."
"Why didn't you write?"
"Because I didn't think it was any of
my business."
The witness afterward admitted that it
was his duty as an attorney to expose
the plot against the liberty and the repu
tation of Williams, but he did not do so
because he didn't want to be mixed up in
the affair at all.
After the adjournment of the court Mr.
Sohlesinger said that the records show
that at the time the reported conversation
took place between Wong Sam and the
witness, Williams and Wong Sam were
the best of friends and did not have a ;
falling out until a year later.
The trial will be resumed this morning. !
VON SCHMIDT
WAS FINED
Mulcted by Judge Morrow Filty
Dollars for Contempt of
Court.
He Disobeyed an Order of Court and
Sold Some Valuable Patents to
the Bridge Company.
Colonel A. W. yon Schmidt was fined
$50 and costs yesterday by United States
Circuit Judge Morrow for contempt of
court, the fine to be paid in ten days,
with the alternative of imprisonment un
til the fine shall have been paid.
An interlocutory decree of injunction
had beeh granted prohibiting Yon Schmidt
from making, using or selling machinery
covered by certain claims of the Bowers
patent. The Bowers California Dredging
Company owned a half-interest in the
Yon Schmidt dredge, through title ob
tained in settlement with Yon Schmidt's
former partners, and Yon Schmidt ownea
the other half, subject to the Injunction.
The Bowers Company gave the San
Francisco Bridge Company a license to
use each and all of the Bowers inven
tions on the work at Mare Island, and
also, at the suggestion of the Bridge
Company, the free use of its half of tne
Yon Schmidt dredge, provided the use of
the Yon Schmidt half could be obtained.
Shortly previous to this Yon Schmidt
had been notified in writing by the
Bowers Company that it would "insist"
upon "strict obedience to the injunction,"
yet Yon Schmidt sold, and the Bridge
Company bought, the- Yon Schmidt half-
Interest. AVhen this fact became known,
he was cited to show cause why ha
shoudl not be punished for contempt of
court. This was dono in order to deter
others under injunction from following
his example.
Mr. Bowers, through his attorney, John
H. Miller, requested that only the mini
mum penalty be imposed, because he
thought Yon Schmidt had been misled
into believing that he had a right to sell.
Judge Morrow took this view of the case,
and imposed only the light penalty above
Btated. Judge Morrow further held that
even the- written permission of the parties
for whose benefit an injunction had been
obtained would not release defendant
from the obligation to observe the decrees
of the court, but that before he could sell
permission must first be obtained from
the court granting the injunction.
Bead in next Sunday's Call what
President Patton of Princeton Uni
versity has to say about this being
an age of second-rate men.
To Reclaim the Sinner.
The Roy. 1\ C. Morg,an, a minister from
Southern California, in co-operation with
Deacon Dexter of the First Congregation
al Church and Rev. W. Rader of the
Third Congregational, has devised a plan
through the enforcement of which he hopes
to convert the whole population of non
church goers south of Market street to
the true faith and a sense of their reli
gious duty.
Religious meetings for this purpose will
be held in Metropolitan Temple every
Sunday afternoon at 3 o'clock, and the
public generally is invited to attend. It
is contended that at least 50,000 willing
souls would come into the fold if the op
portunity were extended to them and
providing a su.able meeting place were
established where they could pray in com
mon and listen to the words of God by
one of his competent ministers. No par
ticular creed wil be adhered to, as the
service will be purely evangelical.

ONE OFFICER
IMPLICATED
Deputy Sheriff Casner
Had a Hand in the Oro
Grande Hold-Up.
Arrested as an Accomplice of
Jones and Bennington, the
Train Robbers.
Was a Member of the Pursuing Posse
and Constantly Discouraged
:he Man Hunters.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PAN BERNARDINO, April 21.â Late
last night the capture of the alleged
accomplice of Tolbert Jones In the Oro
Grande hold-up was accomplished by a
posse under Sheriff Holcomb. He
proved to be Clyde Bennington, and
was the person whom the authorities
suspected from the facts in their pos
session. In the first place the train
men on the freight that passed pre
vious to the overland reported they
saw two men on horseback standing
surveying the track near the place
where the hold-up subsequently oc
curred. Also an employe of John Tur
ner, a rancher residing near the scene
of the robbery, chanced to arise at day
light on April 20, and noted one man
riding on horseback down the valley,
leading another horse.
When the Sheriff and posse arrived
they went immediately to the point
where the man was seen and took up
the trail, which led to the pasture of
the wounded robber, Jones. At the
gate were the imprints of sharp pointed
shoes, where some one had dismounted
to open it. The trail was lost in the
meadow. The footprints, however,
proved an important clew, as it was
known that Bennington was kind of
dudish, and in a small town like Oro
Grande was the only person wearing
toothpicks. After a fruitless search in
the woods and hills until nightfall, the
posse rode into Oro Grande to Benning
ton's house and were told he had not
been home since 11 o'clock the nieht be
fore. The officers then made a blind as
if going back to Victor, but soon re
turned to the house. They were told
the fellow had just returned; also that
he had been informed that he was
wanted by the officers, had decided to
give himself up and was at the saloon
waiting. When arrested he was taken
to the County Jail.
Arriving here Bennington refused to
talk, and only said he had been out lo
cating a mining claim. He knew noth
ing of the rubbery. He did not deny
owning the gun found by the train, but
pleaded ignorance of how it got there.
Since arrested he has slept all the time,
showing he was worn out by the loss
of sleep.
This afternoon a Santa Fe special left
for Oro Grande with District Attorney
Daley. Deputy United States Marshal
Pourade and Special Officer King, re
turning this evening with two new
prisoners, Albert Casner and D. T. Chll
son. The former is a saloon-keeper and
Deputy Sheriff and also constable of
Oro Grande and a nephew of Smith
Haile of this city, a prominent man of
the desert region. Chilson, until recent
ly a member of the freighting firm of
Richardson & Chilson. gave out last
week he was going to Santa Ana to re
side. The feeling among the officers
has been that others besides those first
arrested were implicated. Jones, in or
dering the engineer to back the train,
said unconsciously. "We have gone past
the place." Later when shot he said,
"We were only out hunting cattle," but
the strongest proof was the action of
Casner, who was . ade one of the Sher
iffs posse. He constantly discouraged
the search, throwing cold water on the
project and declaring it all a mistake.
When the special returned with the
prisoners Bennington and Jones were
placed aboard and all taken to Los
Angeles, being Federal prisoners. Jones
is still alive, but low. His condition Is
not improved and his body is still para
lyzed.
The inquest over A. C. Gifford lasted
all day. The jury is composed of R. T.
Blow, A. T. Cassin, T. G. Cappell, Ed
Diehl, R. Milligan, John McCall, J. A.
Livingston. Coroner Keating presided
with Assistant District Attorney
Sprecher. A. C. Mott, the Wells-Fargo
messenger, who shot Oifford and Jones,
was first on the stand. He told the
story as already published.
C. F. Clark, one of the men in the
cab: Fireman Hicks, Conductor Platner
and Brakeman Thorne, all recited the
events substantially the same as pub
lished in yesterday's Call. While the
last witness was on the stand Sprecher
took Hicks and Thorne over the jail
and they looked at Bennington. The
witnesses said the man answered per
fectly as to the form of the second rob
ber. The verdict was:
We, the jury, find that Andrew Clifton
Gifford, a native of Rochester. N. V.. 45
years of age and a resident of Los An
geles, came to his death on the 20th da.y
of April. IS9R. near Oro Grande, from an
unknown cause. That not having had
an opportunity to thoroughly examine
the remains, we cannot determine wheth
er death was caused by gunshot or by ac
cident. From the evidence produced we
cannot implicate A. C. Mott, and we ex
onerate him from all hlame and commend
him for the faithful performance of his
duty. __^_____^____

WIDBER'S
SHORTAGE IS
NOW KNOWN
Indicted by the Grand Jury
for Felony Embez
zlement
Mayor Phelan, Auditor Broderick
and Judge Troutt May be Held
for a Part of the Defal
cation.
"With the exception of a few details, '
unimportant when placed in compari
son with the main fact, the story of
City Treasurer Widber's downfall has
been told.
It is an unvarnished tale of common
place thievery, unenlivened by a single
circumstance that suggests a feeling of
pity for the criminal or that would be '
considered by a.ny member of the col
ony at San Quentin to furnish a justifi
able motive for the crime. There was .
THE DOWNFALL OF AUGUSTUS C. WIDBER.
Some of the figures In yesterday's proceedings at the City Hall following the dis
covery that Treasurer Widber was short in his accounts to the extent of more than
$114,000.
nr> yielding to a momentary tempta
tion, followed by after regrets; no
great and pressing need that overcame
the dictates of conscience; no set pur
pose to betray the trust imposed in
him with intent to profit thereby. It
was simply the steady and systematic !
appropriation of other people's money :
to satisfy the intemperate needs of the j
moment while he waited for the in- j
evitable discovery, arrest and disgrace. â 
Investigations made yesterday by the
authorities lead to the conclusion that
Widber's shortage amounts to $114,
199 Â£0. Of this sum the greater part
has been abstracted from the treasury
vaults since the beginning of the pres
ent year. Every dollar of it, with the
exception of such small sums as were
necessary to keep up his reputation as
a "good fellow" among the denizens of
the tenderloin, has gone into the pock
ets of the bookmakers at the race
tracks and to a few of the select mem
bers of the horde of sharpers and
blood-suckers who use the racing game
as a means for the prosecution of their
nefarious trade.
Having fallen among thieves he fell
an easy victim.
It is more than intimated that the
sharpers who handled the money he
stole from the city's strong box traded
on the supposition that his seemingly
inexhaustible supply of ready cash was
stolen from the treasury vaults, and
that he dare not call a halt. By this
means they were enabled to compel him
to make good bâ¬-ts that were never
made and to enter into gambling ven
tures that had no existence except in
the minds of the sharpers who were
fattening at the expense of the dis
honest official.
On the other hand, Widber admits
that his peculations cover a period of
more than a year, and that some of .the
money went to cover unprofitable In
vestments in real estate and mines, and
that the balance was scattered through
Ihe tenderloin and dumped at the race
track. He has no excuse to offer and
offers none. He simply says that he
has stolen the money, and that of the
vast sum so procured he has not one
dollar left.
As he sat yesterday in the room at
police headquarters, where he has been
confined since his arrest, he appeared
to be broken in body and spirit, and
was but a semblance of his former self.
His eyes were swollen and bloodshot
from the effects of recent dissipation
and the tears shed and the sleepless
hours nassed since his arrest. His
hand trembled like that of an old man,
and he greeted all comers. s*r.'i *â "â (â¢.â¢â >*

not good to see and one that carried
with it a more vivid conviction of the
guilt of the man tba. did the words of
his confession, made. to the authorities
some hours before.
Yesterday afternon the facts of the
case, or such of them as are now
known, were presented to the Grand
Jury, and at 9 o'clock that body re
turned an indictment against Widber
charging him with felony embezzle
ment.
Kaiiy in thf> morning steps were
taken to ascertain the exact amount of
thp defaulting Treasurer's shortage. As
this could only be done by counting
the cash in the treasury vaults it was
decided to begin the count at 1 o'clock
in the afternoon. The entire office force
was called upon to assist in this stu
pendous task, which was superintended
by Mayor Ph'-lan. Auditor Broderick,
District Attorney Barnes, Chief of Po
lice Lees, Superior Judge Troutt, Cap
tain CaAlunUaa of Morse's Detective
Agency, Pity Attorney Creswell, two
representatives of the Fidelity and
Trust Surety Company and se% r eral
others. The work of the day was con
fined to the counting of the money in
the general fund. At 5 o'clock $420. 0n0
had been counted. "Work was then sus
pended until this morning:, when it will
be taken up again and continued until
all of the money has been counted.
As has been told, the greater part of
the missing funds "vere abstracted
from the vaults by Widher, who cov
ered up the fact of the abstractions by
emptying the gold from the sacks and
refilling them with silver coin. This
fact was fully shown yesterday, as was
the reliability of Deputy Treasurer de
la Montanya's estimate of the amounts
so abstracted.
The general fund as represented by
the cash in the big vault was contain
ed in eighty-four sacks, each holding
$5000 in gold. It appears that Widber
had tampered with sixteen of those
sacks, taking out the gold and replac
ing it with silver dollars. Just $250 of
silver coin was required to fill "ach
sack that had contained $5000 in gold
coin. By this substitution Widber re
aiized a net sum of $76,000 from the six
teen sacks.
Of the balance of the shortage, ac
cording to the statement as prepared
by the Deputy Treasurer, $26,377 74 was
taken from the escheat fund belonging
to estates about to revert to the State.
In a cash box was found $39 50, and on
the floor of the vault where the money
in this fund had been stored was found
$500 in gold. The shortage in this fund
therefore amounts to but $25,838 24.
The other fund selected by Widber
as a convenient means of replenishing
his private purse was the collateral in
heritance tax fund. This contained
$15,391 56. Of this amount the Treas
urer was entitled to 5 per cent for col
lecting it. If the five sacks each con
tained $250 in silver in place of the
gold coin originally in them the short
age in this fund will amount to $13,
364 56. Besides these various amounts
the books show upon investigation a
cash credit of $360 90 in Widber's favor.
This leaves a total estimated shortage
of $114,199 SO.
Auditor Broderick and Deputy Treas
urer de la Montanya, who have a more
intimate knowledge of the affairs of
the treasurer's office than any one save
Widber himself, say that they do not
anticipate that the shortage will ex
ceed this amount. In fact Widber fur
nishes corroboration of this belief by
the statement that what his deputy
says regarding the shortar - is probably
the truth. He admits that he does not
know the exact amount of his pecula
tions and declines to make any approxi
mate estimate.
As to the responsibility for the
amount of money stolen by Widber
from the city treasury, there is a wide
divergence of opinion and every pros
pect of a long legal controversy.
The legal proceedings will probauiy
be inaugurated by the Fidelity and
Trust Surety Company, which is on
Widber's bond for $100,000. It has al
ready been intimated by the represen
tatives of this company that they do
not consider themselves responsible for
any money feloniously taken from the
treasury by Widber subsequent to
March 25, 1898. On that date the money
in the vaults was counted by Mayor
Phelan, Auditor Lroderick and Judge
Troutt, the commission authorized to
perform that service for tl.i city. They
then pronounced the city's funds to be
Intact, though it is now known that
such was not the case.
At the present time there is no means
for knowing how much money Widber
has taken from the vaults since that
day.
It will be claimed by the surety com
pany that their continuance on Wid
ber's bond was dependent upon the re
ports made by this commission. The
commission having reported everything
to be correct and the surety company
depending upon the truth of* the report
and having no means of informing It
self to the contrary, it Is Contended that
the members of the commission can be
held personally responsible for the
loss incurred by reason of the laxity of
their methods in counting the cash.
On the other hand, the city and coun
ty authorities will seek to hold the
surety company for the full amount of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FEIDAY, APKIL 22, 189 S.
the $100,000 bond. For the balance of
the shortage recourse will be had to
the property now standing in Widber's
name. This property is very consider
able and will also probably furnish a
pretext for a very bitter legal contro
j versy. The surety company has al
i ready taken steps which it hopes will
result in having the property turned
over to it for the purpose of indemnify
ing itself for the amount of the bond
in case it should be compelled to make
good the full amount. The city au
thorities are also taking steps directed
to the same end.
As to the amount and value of this
property there can at present be no
definite data, and will not be until Jer
ome Deasy, who acts as Widber's
financial agent, can prepare a state
ment of assets. It is known, however,
that Widber owns a valuable ranch at
Walnut Creek, the place where he was
arrested, and another at Mountain
View. These ranches, together with
what real estate he owns in this city,
are valued at about $50,000. To this
may be added about $10,000 worth of
personal property and a mine at Grass
Valley, the value of which is variously
estimated at from $50,000 to $100,000.
Widber himself believes that the
mine could be disposed of at the last
named sum. He says that there is a
great deal of ore on the dump and that
as soon as new machinery which is now
being set up is in working order the
mine will turn out a great deal of
money.
The proceedings of the Grand Jury
that led to the indictment of Widber
were exceedingly brief when the grav
ity of the event was considered. The
examination of witnesses was begun
about 3 o'clock and was concluded
shortly after 5. The witnesses were
Deputy Treasurer de la Montanya,
Chief Lees and Mayor Phelan. The
facts of the confession made Wednes
day night by Widber in the office of i
the Chief of Police were also laid be
fore the Grand Jury. At 5:30 o'clock
an adjournment was taken until 8, at
: which time the Grand Jury went before ;
I Superior Judge Belcher and presented
an indictment charging Widber with
I felony embezzlement. The form of
charge made is as follows:
Tho said A. C. Widber on or about the I
20th day of April. A. D. 1898, at the paid
city and county of San Francisco, State |
of California, wa.s an officer of the said j
[ city and county of San FranJisco, State
of California, to-wit: The duly elected,
qualified and acting Treasurer of said
city ami county of San Francisco, State
of California, and there by virtue of his
said trust as said officer of said city and
county there came into his possession and
under his control one hundred and fifteen
thousand, one hundred and ninety-nine
and eighty-one-hundredths dollars, law
ful money of the United Slates, of the
value of $115,199 80 lawful money of the
United States, and of the moneys and
; personal property of said city and county
| of San Francisco, a public corporation,
| formed, organized anil existing under and
pursuant to the laws of the State of
California, and the said A. C. Widber,
Treasurer as aforesaid, while said money
and personal property was in his posses
sion and under his control by virtue of
his said trust as aforesaid, then and
there, to-wit, on or about the 20th day of
April, A. D. 1898, at said city and county
ol San Francisco, did willfully, unlaw
lully. feloniously and fraudulently ap
propriate the said money and personal
property to his own use, contrary to the
due and lawful execution of his said
trust.
Upon receiving the indictment Judge
Belcher made an order for a bench
warrant for the arrest of the accused,
and fixed his bail at $50,000.
The warrant was placed in the hands
of Detective Seymour, who in turn took
it to police headquarters and handed
it to Chief Lees.
Contrary to all precedent the Chief
declined to serve the warrant on Wid
ber, who was at that moment confined
in the detectives' room across the hall.
The Chief said he would make an effort
to find the Sheriff and have the war
rant served last night, but intimated
that the chances were against finding
that official.
Widber has been very tenderly treat
ed by the Chief since the former's ar
rest, and it was more than likely that
the head of the Police Department was
not at all averse to accepting an ex
cuse that would permit him to allow
the defaulting Treasurer to pass an
other night outside of a prison cell.
It was remarked around the City Hall
yesterday that had the police arrested
some one who had stolen ten dollars
instead of an official who had a, pro
priated more than $100,000 the culnrit
would have been bundled into a prison
cell at once and with scant ceremony
In the present instance Chief Lees has
gone out of the way and stretched his
authority to its fullest limit in order
to shield Widber from the ignominy
that is the legitimate fruit of discover
ed criminality.
The head of the police department
has even taken it upon himself to ad
vise those who know something of
Widber's official misconduct to say
nothing and 1- -Â»n their knowledge to
themselves. In one instance threats
were made against a witness .who had
a very intimate knowledge of the de
tails of the wide swath cut by Wid
ber in the tenderloin. The witness was
a woman and she was threatened with
all sorts of persecutions and prosecu
tions if she permitted he-self to allow
her knowledge to become puolic.
Thomas A. McGowan, the attorney,
who is credit d with havin handler!
the major portion of the money lost by
Widber at the race tracks, was sub
penaed as a witness by the Grand Jury
yesterday afternoon, but was not called
upon to testify. As soon as he was
excused from further atten lance he
went to police headquarters and asked
and obtained permission to see Widber.
What passed in the interview between
the two men is not known.
McGowan now admits having been
interested with \ .dber in matters per
taining to the race course, but declines
to state to what extent.
Widber on hi., part declines to men
tion any names and positively refuses
to disclose the identity of the man who
acted as his race track commissioner.
It is, however, a matter of very com
mon knowledge that McGowan occu
pied this enviable position, and it
is also asserted that one of two other
gentlemen well known in political and
sporting circles profited very materi
ally because of the gambling* predilec
tions of Wldbcr. It is known that since
March 25, the date of the counting of
the funds ' -- the Commission, Widber
abstracted very considerable amounts
from the treasure vaults. During the
count of the money yesterday, one of
the sacks that had been refilled with
silver was found to be filled with dol
lars of the coii -~e of 1898. It is known
that thrse coins came from the local
Mint since March 25,
In connection with the count made
on March 25 there is now recalled an In
| cident that in the light of the revela
i tions of the past few days appears to
!be particularly significant. All of the
| members of the Commission admit that
the count of tl.e city's funds was little
more than a nretense. When it was
completed Mayor Phelan asked the
Treasurer for the money on deposit
with him from the office of the License
Collector. Widber brought out a tray
| of gold in response to this inquiry, and
I the money was duly counted and the
amounted noted.
The commission then left the Treas
urer's office, but Mayor Thelan, who
had been struck with "the thought that
i the amount of the License Collector--'
deposit seemed to be unusually small,
! went to the office of that official and
I made inquiry as to the amount of
| money he had on deposit with the
i Treasurer. The amount named by thh,
; License Collector exceeded the amount
counted in the Treasurer's office by the
commission by $16,000. Believing that
he had discovered a very serious short
age the Mayor hunted up Auditor
rtroderiek and Judge Troutt and in
formed them of his suspicions. To
gether the Commissioners went again
to the Treasurer's office and told Wid
ber that the amount of money he had
on hand to the credit of the License
Collector was $lfi,ooo short of the
amount that should be accounted for.
"Did you say the License Collector?"
said Widber. "I understood you to say
the Tax Collector. I will bring you
the License Collector's money."
He accordingly brought out some !
more trays (if coin, which, upon being
counted, amounted to the sum named
by the License Collector as the correct j
amount of his deposit. All suspicions
in the minds of the commission were
lulled and the incident was forgotten
and probably would not have been
thought of again but for recent devel
opments.
The city and county authorities do
not propose to be made the victims of
any sharp practice on the part of those
who are interested in protecting them-
Belvea from the consequences of Wid
ber's criminality. As an evidence of
this City and County Attorney Cres
well last evening filed a suit against
Widber for the recovery of the money
stolen from the city. This was done for
the purpose of forestalling any contem
plated action by the Surety Company,
and also for the full protection of the
city in the effort that will be made to
recover any money not made good by
the bondsmen.
Widber has not yet selected legal
counsel to undertake his defense, if he
contemplates making any. Yesterday
he sent for Attorney Peixotto for the
purpose of asking his advice on matters
relating to his immediate detention.
Peixotto at once advised Widber not to
talk to newspaper men, but declined to
say whether or not he would defend
Widber against the charge of felony
embezzlement in the face of the fact
that the Treasurer had publicly con
fessed his guiit.
Prior to Peixotto's appearance on the
scene Widber showed an inclination to
discuss his downfall, though he was ad
verse into going into details. He said
he had begun his peculations more than
a year ago and that all the money he
had taken was abstracted from the
vaults during office hours. His plan
was to remove one sack of coin at a
time and after substituting silver for
gold return the sack to its place in the
vault.
He said that a shortage in the ac
counts in his father's estate at first in
duced him to take money from the
treasury and that calls upon his purse
caused by unprofitable real estate in
vestments and speculations in mines
had led him to continue the abstrac
tion. He finally began to bet on the
races and after that the money went
very rapidly.
It may be that one result of the
prospective trouble in collecting the
amount of Widber's bond will result in
some action being taken requiring Au
ditor Rroderick to furnish a new of
ficial bond for himself. The same surety
company that was on Widber's bond ia
on that of the Auditor, and it is not
at all likely that those who have charge
of the affairs of the city will continue
to consider such a bond adequate.

DEMENTED
THROUGH
HER LOVE
Sad Fate of an At
tractive Young
Woman.
Katie Powers Arrested
on a Charge of In
sanity.
Became Enamored of an Opium
Fiend Against the Wishes
of Her Mother.
PLACED IN A PADDED CELL
Will Be Examined by the Commis
sioners of Lunacy To-
Day.
A rather attractive young woman
named Katie Powers was arrested l"st
night and charged with being insane.
The complaining witness is her mother,
j who lives at SI!) Howard street.
According to the latter's story Katie,
who Is only IS years of age, several weeks
ago became enamored of a young man,
who she says is addicted to the use of
opium. Mrs. Powers forbade her daugh
ter to keep company with her depraved
i suitor, and threatened to invoke the pa
l rental rod if she insisted on going with
him. The girl promised to forget her
lover and told her mother that she
would never speak to him again.
A few days later it was noticed that
the girl acted strangely, and her parent,
becoming anxious about her condition,
called in the family physician. The lat
ter, after an examination, gave it as his
opinion that the unfortunate young wo
man was fast losing her mind.
Rather than have her sent to an insane
asylum the broken-hearted mother de
termined t*> take care of her in the hope
that she would regain her mental equi
l.'brium.
Several days ago the love-stricken girl
became violently insane while eating din
ner, and started to destroy the crock
ery. On being prevented she placed her
hand in the tea pot, and taking out a
handful of tea leaves proceeded to eat j
them. Subsequently she seized a broom
and after declaring that she intended to
go to the front for the United States 'n
case of war with Spain, threatened to
"shoot" her mother and sister.
Yesterday morning Mrs. Powers, real
izing that her daughter was mentally de
ranged, appeared before a Superior Judge
and swore to a complaint, charging her
with insanity. She was taken into cus
tody by a Deputy Sheriff after a short
struggle and conveyed to the Receiving
Hospital, where she was placed in a
padded cell.
Late last night she became violently in
sane and vainly endeavored to butt out
her brains against the cell door. In or
der to keep her from injuring herself It
was deemed advisable to place her in & i
Btraltjacket.
FIREMEN MAY
GO TO THE WAR
Resolution Granting Leave of
Absence Passed by the
Commissioners.
On Their Return They Will Be
Given Their Old Positions if
Not Better Ones.
The Fire Commissioners, at their meet
ing 1 yesterday afternoon, showed that they
were imbued with the prevailing war
spirit by passing the following resolu
tion:
Resolved, That leave of ahsence be granted i
to any member < this department who may
desire to offer his services to the Government
in the coming contest between our country and
Spain, and all members who avail themselves
ot the opportunity shall upon their return be
given as Rood a position, if not better, than
the one they left.
D. F. Buckley, driver of Engine S. was
fined three days' pay for carelessness In â 
driving. The resignations of Thomas I
Dolan of Engine 2 and Patrick O'Donnell
of Engine 10 were accepted. O'Donnell
was appointed at the previous meeting,
and one fire was enough for him. Phillip
Bannon was appointed hoseman of Engine
6. Dennis Toomey of Engine 6 was re
tired on a pension as he is over 60 years
of age, has bad eyesight and bad hear- I
ing, and has served over nineteen years :
in the department.
The commissioners were surprised to re- I
ceive a claim from the Olympic Salt i
Water Company for $124 for salt water I
and coal used in assisting to extinguish
the fire at the Golden Gate Villa, Ocean
Beach, last week. The claim was referred
to the Chief Engineer.
It was announced that a member of the
department could go to any tailor to have
his new regulation suit made, provided
It answered the requirements.
MISDIRECTED PATRIOTISM.
Young America, Unable to Find a
Spaniard, Attacked a Chinaman.
A burst of misdirected patriotism, dur
ing which a Chinaman was assaulted and
l.arlly beaten, landed Frank Johnson, col
ored, Malcolm Dunn and Ed Kirby, three
newsboys, behind the bars of the Cal
ifornia atreet police station lajt even

The newsboys had been crying war
extras so long that they had imbibed con
siderable war spirit and wan to 1 to do
up some foreigner. Seeing no Spaniard
handy they fell upon Moy Jui Alun. Sp^c
tstcrs in large numbers were attracted
to the scene and some of them rescued
the unlucky Mongolian and hid him in a
neighboring store. The newdiiovs called
for reinforcements and when a sufficient
number had responded to the call trie
retreat of the Chinaman was bombarded.
A squad of police under eommajii nf

FOR COAST DEFENSES.
Miles of Torpedo Cable Being Manufactured on
Rush; Orders.
The T'nited States Government Is making elaborate preparations for a com
plete system of coast defenses by means of submarine torpedoes. A rush order
has been placed with the Washhurn & Moon Manufacturing Company for miles
of a peculiar kind of cable which is used only for the conveying of insulating
wires to submarine mines or torpedoes.
Manager Frank L. Brown of the local branch, when asked about the order,
was extremely reticent,- as he said while there were no Instructions to keep
it quiet, it might not be the best policy to make sip li facts public. "I admit
that we have received a heavy order." he said, "but do not feel at liberty to
make the exact extent of it public. The order is for what we t.rm torpedo
cable, and it is exactly the same kind of cable as was attached to the mine that
blew up the Maine. We do not make the cable complete here, but simply armor
it. It consists of a rubber core containing the copper wires, and around this

the water or from possible breakage by being caught -by an anchor or grap
pling hook. The rubber core is made at Worcester and shipped hÂ»-re to be
mored. This is a much better distributing point than the East, so it is much
cheaper to finish the cable here. We d<> not know as yet wiii-iv the i

Much of it will be shipped to points along the coast. Some will bo delivered
here and the balance shipped to Gal vest on for distribution along the Gulf

A BOY'S TALE
OF A CRIME
Eddie 'Keefe Claims That
His Mother Was
Murdered.
Says His Father Cut Her
Throat During a
Quarrel.
Weighted the Eody and Threw It
From the Bay Farm Island
Bridge.
OAKLAND, April 21.â Eddie Keefe, the
son of Patrick Keefe, told a remarkable
story to-day to Detective Ferrin, an offi
cer of the Humane Society, and several
others. He says that his father is re
sponsible for the death of his mother,
and that after her death her body was
weighted with rocks and thrown into the
bay from Bay Farm Island bridge. The
mystery of Mrs. Keefe's sudden disappear
ance was told in The Call in November
last, and an attempt was made by her
husband to account for it by saying that
she had run away from home because
their married life was one continual dis
cord.
It has always been thought that the boy
Eddie, who is as smart as a whip, could
tell something that would tend to clear
up the mystery if he would, but he has,
up till to-day, been as silent as an oys
ter. This afternoon some one gave Eddy
some beer, and for the first time he be
came talkative. He admitted that he had
told his story a few days ajfo to Mrs.
Ives, the school teacher in Alameda, with
whom he had been stopping, and haÂ£ oc
casionally dropped a hint to others.
Eddie's story in brief is as follows;
"On the sth of last July my father,
mother and I went out as usual to gather
driftwood on the beach. My father and
mother quarreled at -ne time and on the
beach they had quite a tight. Finally
father tooK a knife that he always car
ried and cut my mother across the throat.
She did not live many minutes, and father
covered the body over with wood and
told me to watch it till he came back.
He was not gone long, but returned with
some sacks we had brought with us to
the beach. The body was afterward dis
posed of by being thrown from Bay Farm
Island bridge into the water, after it had
been weighted with rocks. I was fright
ened Into silence by ray father and have
not told the story till a few days ago
when he beat me severely, and I told Mrs.
Ives."
Young Keefe was supposed to be sick
when he told his story, but the doctor
who was summoned at once saw that he
was under the influence of liquor. To
night the lad was quite sober, and when
questioned on the matter by an officer he
repeated the story, mentioning the names
of some people in connection with it,
other than his father. Those who hoard
his two stories are inclined to believe
that there is something in them. This
afternoon one of the girls in Alameda
told of some incidents that seem to bear
out some portions of Eddie's story- Noth
ing has been seen or heard of Mrs. Keefe
since the morning of the Bth of July of
last year, when she left home with her
husband and Eddie to gather driftwood.
The girls were left at home because
they were going to the city later in the
day, to see the procession (the Fourth
being Sunday), but since their mother
left home they have not seen her.
It is but right to Keefe to say that he
made a very full denial of all sugges
tions of foul play last November, and
said that his wife had often spoken to
him of running away and she had car
ried ou* her threat. The Keefes came
from Australia in April of last year and
settled in alameda.

Chesla Barnam, a young- girl aged 11
years, was sent from Grass Valley by

search of her parent without being able
to find him, when at last, after despair
ing of finding him. she applied to a car
conductor, who turned her over to a
police officer. This official took her to
the Central Station on Tuesday night, and
kept her there until yesterday, when she
was turned over to the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children.
Colonel Parnell learned from the way
ward child that she had been cruelly
treated and wronged by both her father
and mother. From the little on>'s state
ment It appears that her father and moth

mother was awarded the custody of the
little girl, hut her subsequent marriage to
a miner named Browning caused her to

Press Censorship a Good Idea.
The Oliver Wendell Holmes Debating
Society held its regular meeting- in the
rooms of the California Hotel last even
ing. The subject under discussion was
"Should There Be a Censorship of the
Press?" There was one speaker on the
affirmative side as against two on the
Live, yet the solitary one managed
to get away with the odds that were
against him, as the decision was that
censorship of the press would be a very
excellent thing.
