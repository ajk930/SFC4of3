After a short halt they began the
; long climb up the steep narrow
trail which affords the only pas

which shuts the city of Santiago
from the sea. By this time the
sun was beginning to be felt
keenly by the men. Laden with

slowly toiled up the rocky path
in single file. There was not
enough air stirring to make a
leaf flutter. Along the hillsides
several halts were necessary be

supplies. The beasts were affect

ried by a detail of Rough Riders
as far as the village of Juragua,
where the men were resting. The
Tenth Cavalry had dismounted
and were climbing the mesa from
Altares. The Seventy-first New
York had just landed and were
falling in, preparatory to begin
ning the same ascent.
_ It soon became evidentthe day
would be extremely Jiot. The
land breeze died down and the
first gusts of the sea breeze
scarcely moved the leaves of a
few scattered cocoanut trees
along the line of march. The
column had not proceeded a mile
before the men began to cast off
their blankets and other articles.
The men soon began to fall out of
the ranks and drop exhausted
under the shade of the convenient
brush. The ambulance corps un
der Dr. Lamotte had its hands
full attending the numerous cases
of heat prostration.
Still no signs of the enemy. The
columns labored slowly along
over the narrow uneven paths.
Suddenly, away over the yellow
hillside, two or three miles across
the valley which parallels the
mesa, a puff of white smoke
arose, then another and still an
other in quick succession.
A short distance along the
ridge, by the time perhaps the
tenth puff was holding the at
tention of the Rough Riders, the
sharp crack of Mausers was waft
ed across the intervening space.
This was followed by an irregu
lar sputter, as Castillo's Cubans
replied. The softer, keener music
of the Krag-Jorgensens followed,
signifying that General Lawton's
advanced lines were getting in
touch of the game of battle.
While the eyes of the Rough Rid
ers wjere riveted on this engage
ment, from the right a flash came
from the chaparral thicket on
the mesa barely 200 yards ahead.
A score of Mauser bullets whis
tled over the heads of those in
the foremost rank. This unex
pected attack quickly gave the
Rough Riders an affair of their
own to attend.
"It's up to us, boys." shouted
Lieutenant Colonel Roosevelt,
who was riding near the head of
the column.
When attacked, the Rough
Riders were marching along a
trail so narrow they could ad
vance only in single file. In- this
position the fire of the enemy
was doubly dangerous.
"Deploy! Lie down!" Colonel
Wood commanded.
Troop L, which formed the ad
vance line, scattered, quickly
sending a volley in the direction
of the Spanish bullets.
The fire did not check the ene

with great bravery, emptying
their rifles as they came. The fire

WITH THE ROUGH RID
ERS, near Santiago, Friday, via
Port Antonio, Jamaica, June 25.
â The first fight of the invading
army took place here this morn
ing six miles from the coast. The
First Volunteer Cavalry, known
as Roosevelt's Rough Riders,
were ambushed by the receding
Spaniards in a narrow path,
with a barbed wire fence along
its right side. It was impossible
to see more than twenty feet
through it at any time.
The first sign of the nearness
of the enemy was the presence
of a dead Cuban lying across the
road, and beyond him a Spanish
outpost. This was reported to
Colonel Wood by scouts, and he
sent one of the company down
the trail and another through the
jungle to the left and right.
The Spaniards allowed the two
scouts who were of the first troop,
and Sergeant Hamilton Fish to
pass down the trail unmolested,
and then fired into the line of the
men as they ran forward in sin
gle file. The scouts were both
wounded. Fish was shot through
the side on a line with his heart.
He was killed instantly.
Meanwhile Captain Capron's
men lost their way and swung to
the right, firing into their own
men on that end. An order to
cease firing was given, and Lieu
tenant Colonel Roosevelt led the
troops back to the left again,
where the firing was fiercest. It
was here that Captain Capron
was shot through the side over
the heart, and died in a few hours.
He was one of the most popular
captains and one of the best offi
cers in the regiment.
The men showed most splendid
spirit and discipline, although all
the conditions were absolutely
against them. They could not
see more than twenty feet away.
The enemy was invisible. Their
Mauser rifles' smoke was indis
tinguishable, and men were fall
ing on every side of them with
no enemy to retaliate upon. It
might have tried the spirit of any
but the thoroughbred fighters
they are. It is also to be remem
bered that this was the first time
that a large percentage of the
men were under fire.
The fight lasted two hours, during
which time the ground covered was
over half a mile in width and a mile
Jn length. The Spanish fire was well
directed, and as they knew the trail
they could guess where to aim.
Edward Marshall, a Journal corre
spondent, was with Captain Capron
and was shot through the side in two
places, Stephea Crane, who, with J.2
P. Dunning of the Associated Press
and myself witnessed the ambuscade,
is looking after him. Mr. Marsha.ll is
badly hurt and may not live.
I found Fish's body lying across the
trail, and 1 identified him by his silver
watch with "H. F." and two crests
upon it; also by a bundle of letters he
carried in his breast pocket. I have
them and will forward them as direct
ed. Fish was the first soldier killed
this war in battle.
Lieutenant Colonel Roosevelt led his
men with :t rifle he picked up from
one of the wounded and charged the
iron building that the Spaniards had
fortified themselves in. It is now occu
pied by the Rough Riders.
Lieutenant Colonel Roosevelt was
nearly killed by a bullet that passed
through a tree adjacent to which he
was standing. Splinters entered Roose
velt's eyes and ears.
Major Croat y was shot through the
arm, but the wound is not serious. Cap
tain McClintock was wounled through
the leg seriourly. I found one dead man
with the name Leggett on his haver
sack and also a boy shot through the
head and a New Testament in his
pocket marked "Fielder Dawson, Ne
vada, Mo." It is- impossible to give
the names of the wounded as they were
many. Colonel Wood was at first re
port.-d killed, but he is unhurt.
William Tiffany was unable to use
his Hotchkiss pun as the packer ran
away with an, important part of them,
throwing it to the ground and breaking
it. The mioker was the only man in the
fight who did not behave with great
courage under the unusual conditions.

Spaniards is reported. It was an am

rapidity for accuracy. Most of
the bullets flew high. From re
ports it is believed the Spanish
used explosive bullets. The sound
of the bullets cutting through the
chaparral affected the nerves of
the Rough Riders, and a few men
showed signs of panic, but the
cool demeanor of Colonel Wood
and Lieutenant Colonel Roose
velt soon restored confidence and
every man settled down to work.
Troop L was re-enforced by
Troop G, but still the ei*emy
pressed forward. Colonel Wood's
men yielded their ground slowly.
Meanwhile the sound of firing
warned the other troops at the
rear that their comrades were en
gaged. A great scramble to get
to the front then began. Owing
to the roughness of the ground
it was impossible to form ranks,
and each man rushed forward as
best he could. They found Troops
L and G fighting desperately,
penned in an awkward position
with a wire trocha on one side
and a ravine on the other. The
enemy was temporarily checked,
but presently outflanked Wood's
men, who were forced to fall
back.
They retired slowly, fighting
fiercely as they went.
Private Whitney of Troop L
staggered along bleedingprofuse
lv from three wounds. Private
Islade, supported between two
slightly wounded companions,
also made his way to the rear.
He had continued to fire after he
had been struck by three bullets,
and retired only after the fourth
bullet had hit him. Others whose
names 'l could not learn gave
Dr. Lamotte and his assistants
plenty to do.
By this time all the Rough
Riders had goneinto the engage
ment, but they seemed unable to
check the enemy's determined
advance. Colonel Wood sent an
orderly to ask for re-enforce
ments. He met the Tenth Cav
alry, which dismounted hurried
ly and moved forward, as did the

been lying exhausted on the
ground, sprang to their feet,

grasped their rifles and staggered
forward to aid their comrades.
By 10 o'clock the enemy had
been checked, with the assistance
of the Tenth and Twenty-second.
The fighting on the mesa con
tinued furiously for an hour in
the burning sun. The men had
no water in their canteens and the
throats of the officers became so
parched that they could only
whisper their commands. Rifles
became almost too hot to hold.
Many men took but their can
teens to give the dearly prized
water to their wounded and ex
hausted companions. The mules
who were carrying the ammuni
tion fell exhausted and could net
rise.
Our men were surprised at the
determination and bravery of the
Spanish. They now realize that
Santiago can be taken only after
the hottest kind of fighting.
The fight near Sevilla began at
8 o'clock in the morning and last
ed four hours. The struggle was
the most desperate during the
first hour. Up to 9 o'clock the
Spaniards, who began the attack
tenaciously, held their ground.
Between 9 and 12 o'clock the bat
tle was a running one, the enemy
hastily retreating toward Sevilla,
and our troops as hastily pursu
ing.
It was rare good 'luck that
saved the Spaniards from com
plete annihilation when they en
countered the regulars and Rough
Riders in the outskirts of Sevilla
this morning. They had to face
barely 1000 Americans, but if the
fight had been delayed a few
hours, enough Americans to
crush them completely would
have arrived on the scene.
Four troops of the Tenth Cav
alry, four troops of the First Bat
tery, and eight troops of Rough
Riders had been sent in advance
of the army, and it was this de
tached force that the Spanish en
gaged. Against our iooo men
they pitted 2000. They were
strongly entrenched behind bush
es and had every advantage in
position as well as in numbers.
Despite this fact they were inglori
ously repulsed by an inferior
force long before the second de
tachment of American troops ar
rived upon the scene.
Colonel Roosevelt's men, who had
pushed their way toward Sevilla yes
terday, resumed their march soon after
sunrise this morning. They were join
ed by a detachment of Cubans under
General Castillo, who guided them
over the steep hills along the winding
paths. Constant watch was kept for
the enemy, but none seemed to be lurk
ing in the thick underbrush that lined
the narrow roadway. It began to
seem as if the enemy had retreated into
Sevilla and the men were advancing in
quick order when The crack of Mauser
rifles suddenly was heard. Bullets
whizzed over the heads of the Rouerh
Riders. The fire came from behind the

thick underbrush and the Cubans were
ordered to reply.
Colonel Wood, after ordering his men
to lie down quickly, surveyed the situ
ation. His men had been caught in an
ambush. The firing at once became
furious. From several sides the enemy's
bullets came whistling toward our men
and the engagement had hardly begun
when several Rough Riders rolled over
on the ground, dead.
The Spanish could not be definitely
located. They were well screened by
the underbrush and their positions
could be judged only from the direction
of their fire. General Castillo's men
began firing more rapidly and the
Rough Riders made ready to join in
the shooting. Provoked by their in
ability to see the enemy the men be
gan to curse.
"Don't swear!" Colonel Wood shouted.
"Shoot!"
They did. They joined the Cubans
In pouring a terrific fire into the bushes
where the Spaniards lay. It was an
even fight for the next fifteen minutes
or so. The fire of the Spanish then fell
off a bit. They seemed to be falling or
retreating. Lighter and lighter became
the fire from the underbrush, until
finally only an occasional shot whizzed
toward the Americans' position. This
evidence that the enemy was on the
run quickly inspired the American
troops. They charged forward, pres
ently gaining a position from which
they could see the Spaniards.
They renewed their fire with greater
vigor, driving the enemy foot by foot
toward Sevilla. The Spaniards resisted
the American advance with great stub
bornness, but the tide of battle had
turned against them. During the next
two hours they devoted themselves less
and less to shoe-ting and finally lied
precipitately toward Sevilla,
While the Rough Riders were giving
and taking hard knocks on the high
ground the firing became general in
the valley to the north, where General
Lawton, the Cuban skirmish line hav
ing been driven back, checked the ad
vance of a strong Spanish force, and
eventually compelled them to retreat.
General Lawton succeeded in bringing
a section of the mountain battery into
action. This kept the road clear of
Spaniards while our troops quickly
formed and moved forward. There was
heavy firing in this locality, but at
noon General Lawton seemed to have
pressed the enemy back across Jura
guasito Creek.
The Second Massachusetts took part
in this engagement, and they thus were
the first volunteers, aside from the
Rough Riders, to be under fire.
When the Mindora started with this
dispatch the battle was in full pro
gress both on the mesa and across the
valley. The Spanish everywhere were
fighting bravely and making desperate
resistance, but they were slowly yield
ing in all directions.
An attempt of the enemy to execute
a flank movement on our troops in the
mesa was checked by the Wampatuck
and New Orleans, which shelled the
chaparral just beneath the top of the
rid i?e.
It is impossible at this hour to make
any accurate estimates of me losses on.
either side. Several of the Rough
Riders reported as killed or wounded
are coming: to the rear for surgical
treatment. Their wounds are mostly
slight. The men say others are hurt
too badly to get back without stretch
ers owing to the thickness of theundef
brush, which covers a great part of the
battlefield.
Many of the dead will be undiscov
ered for days until their whereabouts
is revealed by the vultures, which al
ready hover in thousands over the field.
The Spanish loss is believed to be
heavy. It is known that it is con
siderably in excess of the American
loss.
When rolls are called to-night some
light will be thrc vn on the American
losses, but it will not be conclusive.
Many men are certain to have lost their
commands during the battle and they
may be unable to rejoin their organiza
tions before to-morrow. They will be
reported as missing in the meantime.
Many dead Spaniards lay about the
blockhouses where the enemy made its
final rally. After the structure had
been set on fire the bodies of these
soldiers were cremated and it is be
lieved hundreds died.
The heat was intense during the day
and a great many of the American
troops were prostrated. This, with the
nervous excitement attendant upon
their first battle, was a heavy strain
upon the men.
General Lawton, in obtaining a posi
tion acrofes Juraguasito Creek, is en
camped only six miles from Santiago
Cathedral and two miles from Sevllla.
To the westward General Garcia is
making splendid progress. While our
troops were engaged about Sevilla,
General Garcia attacked Hermitano,
five miles west of Socapa Castle and
only eight miles from Santiago. There
Is a small Spanish fort at Hermitano,
with some field guns, supported by a
garrison. General Garcia sent 1000 Cu
bans against this fort, the attack being
designed to prevent General Linares
from sending troops to check the ad
vance of the main army. The Cubans
attacked so- spiritedly, howevtr, t^at
they are reported to have taktn part
of the intrenchments.
The Spanish are preparing to fall
back to Calmanes, which Is inside the
regular defenses of Santiago. Cobre
was abandoned by General Linares last
night and the garrison was withdrawn
to Caimanes. During General Garcla's
attack on Hermitano the Texas and
Brooklyn shelled the Socapa and Es
trella fortifications, which replied
feebly.
When Mindora left the two battle
ships were firing at Juraguasito to pre
vent the Spanish from destroying a
railroad bridge, which they were pre
paring to do. The Cubans report that
General Linares has undermined many
of the roads and paths leading Into
Santiago and that ho will try to blow
up our artillery. The Spanish general
evidently has plenty of powder and
ammunition, for he abandoned a con
siderable quantity at Baiquiri.
Unless his progress is considerably
checked General Shafter will have San
tiago completely invested by Sunday.
He has intimated that he will smash
the city's defenses without delay and
Admiral Sampson has prepared to co
operate.
The engagement in which the Ameri
cans suffered such a severe loss was
preceded by sharp fighting on the day
before. It was apparently a part of
the Spanish tactics to make the Amer
icans believe that the enemy had en
tirely abandoned the country leading
toward Santiago. Dozens of dark col
umns of smoke rose early Thursday
morning from the hilltons lying be
tween the American camp at Altares
and the city of Santiago. From this
it was thought by many of our troops
that the Spaniards had sought safety
in-the outer defenses of the beleagured
city. It had been a night full of anx
iety for the men on the picket lines.
General Lawton late on Wednesday
afternoon had pushed the Twenty-sec
ond, Twenty-fifth and part of the Sec
ond Massachusetts Infantry to a
point three miles to the westward of
Baiquiri. This he succeeded in doing
without opposition from the Spanish.
The American picket line during the
night had been thrown to a point a mile
beyond that contemplated in General
Lawton 's instructions.
All of our men were very alert, and
every preparation to repel a night at
tack was made. It was thought likely
that the enemy would resort to the
same tactics they had adopted when
the marines from the Marblehead were
landed at the entrance to Guantanamo
Bay. In this they were mistaken, how
ever, as no attempt was made to dis
turb the American forces.
Above the apex of the hill a quarter
mile beyond our advance pickets a
tongue of flame leaped into the air just
at dawn. This was quickly followed by
another and another flash above the
adjacent hilltops until at least a dozen
fires were burning fiercely within a
radius of five miles. Columns of
smoke in other directions indi
cated that many more fires, shut
out of view by the surrounding moun
tains, had been started by the Span
iards.
As the sun rose higher it revealed a
blazing blockhouse on the nearest hill.
The flames here and at other points
worked the complete destruction of the
Spanish line of defense outside the
regular earthworks.
General Linares became convinced
during the night that the United States
force was too strong to be resisted and
had ordered all the blockhouses to be
filled with combustibles and fired when
the Spanish retreat began. The little
village of Altares on the coast four
miles west of Balquiri, which so tena
ciously held out Wednesday under the
withering fire of the American gun
boats, was evacuated by the garrison
of 300 Spanish infantry at the same
time.
These troops began to retreat toward
Santiago, being compelled to travel
through almoct impassable mountain
defiles, the entrances to which were kit
tle known by any but the Cuban scouts.
No other route for the retreat was pos
sible for the Spaniards however, and
they struggled toward the city as best
they could. It looked at one time as
if this retreat would be successful, but
it finally terminated in a severe repulse
for the Spaniaris through the \-igi lance
of General CastH'o and his Cubans.
Genera] Castillo, to guard against be
ing surprised by the enemy, had gone
forward Wednesday afternoon with a
detachment mounted Cubans. When
they arrived at a point two miles in
land from Altares General Castillo was
informed by the scouts of the retreat of
the Spanish infantry. He immediately
took steps to intercept the Spaniards
and succeeded in cutting off a part of
the Spanish column.
There was furious skirmishing when
the Spaniards found* they had been
ambushed. As soon as they had recov
ered from their surprise they returned
the Cuban fire with vigor. They were
halted at once and soon afterward
were compelled to fall back, and before
the engagement had been under way
half an hour they were completely put
to rout. They fled in such haste that
their baggage and much of their am
munition were captured by Castillo's
men and several soldiers and teamsters
were taken prisoners.
In this engagement one Cuban was
killed aA several were wounded. I
could not learn how many Spaniards
were killed. The Cubans, although in
ferior in numbers to the Spanish, pur
sued them for several miles, keeping
up a vigorous fire.
General Castillo suddenly was given
a surprise, as the enemy turned about
and renewed their fire upon his men.
In their first flight they had encoun
tered a detachment of Spanish soldiers,
and, ericouraged by this re-enforce
ment, they made another show of re
sistance.
This looked like the turning point in
the skirmish for the combined Span
ish forces opposed the Cubans with
such force that Castillo was compelled
to order his men back. The tide of bat
tle then ran in favor of the Spaniards
for a time, and the Cuban success gave
promise of turning into defeat. But
just as matters were becomine desper
ate for Castillo's men they had the
same good luck as had come to the
Spaniards a few minutes earlier. They
were joined by a detachment of Cu
bans who had heard the firing and has
tened to the scene.
With his plucky little band thus re
inforced, General Castillo quickly turn
ed against the enemy again The
fight became more vigorous than at
any time during the skirmish. The
Spaniards fought desperately to hold
the advantage they had just gained,
but the attempt was a complete fail
ure. Slowly and sullenly the enemy
was again forced to retreat, and finally
they were put to flight.
Information brought later In the day
showed the Spaniards had at least four
men killed. This fight, as observed
from the hills two miles to the rear,
was most picturesque.
Not a single blockhouse was left
standing bf the Spaniards.
It is evident from this skirmish that
General Garcia is carrying out his part
of the programme, and is pressing
closely toward Santiago from the west.
Carrying Coal to Dewey.
PHILADELPHIA. June 25.â The
British ships Glooscap, Captain
Scheyer, and East Lothian, Captain
McFarlane, sailed from this port to-day
for Manila with iiearly 6000 tons of coal
for Admiral Dewey's fleet. The two
cargoes are valued at about $17,000, but
the freight received by the two ships
will be more than double this sum. The
two captains will do all in their power
to get to Manila in the shortest possible
time.

CRUSHING
DEFEAT OF
AGRARIANS
Will Not Have Over a Hun
dred Votes in tr;e
f^eicfystag.
Kaiser William Threatens to Adopt
h Drastic Measures to Re
press Socialism.
BERLIN, June 25.â For the United
States the most interesting result of
theelections just held inGermanyis the
wholesale defeat of agrarianism. The
only single agrarian candidate elected
was returned on the first ballot on June
16, while the successful Conservatives,
National Liberals and Centrists
pledged to agrarianism only totaled
66. So including yesterday's and to
day's successes, the agrarian strength
in the new Reichstag will certainly not
exceed 100.
Emperor William was very indignant
at the early Socialist gains and ex
pressed himself strongly. He remarked:
"It is time to stop persuasion and try
more drastic measures, or these fel
lows will destroy all."
But the later returns will probably
mollify the powers that be. Neverthe
less, the Government, and particularly
the Emperor, is not disposed to offer
any compromise to socialism. TWfere is
already talk of repressive legislation,
but the officials are deaf to all sug
gestions for removing the causes of
socialism by means of social reforms.
Among the curious facts developed
by the recent election is the discovery
by a department chief of the Ministry
of the Interior that most of the sub
ordinates voted for the socialistic can
didates, the ringleader being a favor
ite copyist. Seven of these employes
were immediately discharged when
this fact became known.
The highest personages in the land
participated in the electioneering. At
Leipsic a high Government official
stood at the polls and buttonholed
voters, urging them not to support the
Socialist candidate, Herr Scmidt.
Herr August Hintze, the socialist
leader of this city, who denounced the
election latter of Count yon Posadow
ski-Wehner, the Minister of the In
terior and representative of the Chan
cellor, was arrested on election day on
the charge of slanderine: a Government
officer. Another socialist leader, who
dubbed the Count's letter as "mean."
was sentenced to a fortnight'^ impris
onment in jail.
It is whispered that Emperor William
is the real author of Count yon Posa
dowski-Wehner's manifesto.

EXPECTED TO
MEET DEATH
Young Fish Had a True
Presentiment.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 25.â Hamilton
Fish Jr. was a member of one of the
oldest and most distinguished families
in New York. Members of the family
have held high positions in the State
and nation, and they have siw^i been
prominent in the society of this city.
His grandfather, the late Hamilton
Fish, after whom he was named, was
Secretary of State in President Grant's
Cabinet and was a force in local and
national -"MtlcÃ of the time. His un
cle, Hamilton Fish, was formerly
speaker of the Assembly, a*'' 'her
uncle, Stuyvesant Fish, is president of
the Illinois Central Railroad. Nicholas
Fish, the young man's father, is a
prominent banker. He has rendered
service to his country in a different
way. He was second secretary of the
legation under Bancroft in Berlin from
1871 to 1874; first secretary from 1874
to 1877; minister to Switzerland for
four years and minister to Brussels for
four years. Young Fish was 26 years
old, 6 feet 3 inches tall, powerfully
built, an athlete every inch of him. He
rowed at No. 7 on the winning Colum
bia crew of 1895 nnfl was a clever boxer.
After leaving college he roughed it In
Utah at railroading and came back to
New York in 1896. He was tangled up
with all the night life of the city, fight
ing with coachmen and policemen and
running into extravagance which often
brought his name before the public. He
joined Roosevelt's regiment while it
was being organized and at San Anto
nio he received a sergeant's commis
sion. In this city he was a member of
the Union League Club and belonged
to the Delta Psi college fraternity.
Fish had a presentiment of his death
in battle before he left San Antonio
for the front. While chatting with a
party of friends at the San Antorjo
Club a few days before he departed he
expressed the belief that he would be
killed in his first fight.
WASHINGTON, June 25. â Major
James M. Bell of the First Regiment of
peror William are much commented
upon. The Tageblatt says:
"The address to the garrison at Pots
dam will re-echo throughout the army,
I but the general public will be sur
| prised at the tone of bitterness toward
| themselves pervading the speech. His
I complaint at being misunderstood and
j suspected is something new."
The Frankfort Zeitung is very angry
jat the Emperor's remark that "the
theater, like the schools and universi
ties, should be a weapon of the mon
arch." It says:
"The Emperor may be permitted to
be the master of theaters -enjoying
1 royal subsidies, but we protest against
i the analogy being drawn with educa
tional institutions, which we think are
| being reduced to powerless instru
j ments of one-sided political views."
The fact that Germany deems it nec
essary to keep such a large fleet at
I Manila continues to occasion surprise,
\ and the press frequently comments on
i the subject. The Deutsche Zeitung,
! referring to the renewed declaration of
the Foreign Office that the sole purpose
I of the fleet is to protect the interests
| of German residents, says:
"This contains, of course, to us, a
promise or obligations in case Spain
relinquishes her hold on the islands and
a new grouping of interests becomes
I necessary."
On the other hand, the Post of this
city, which is often inspired by the For
; eign Office, warns the "jingoes" to
"beware of alarming and threatening
1 a friendly nation needlessly."
The Tagreblatt says it finds no diffi
j culty in discovering how closely the
I fleet's movements are connected with
Germany's steps to acquire a coaling
j station in the Philippine Islands.
The German Secretary of Finance has
issued new and more stringent orders
covering the admission of American
dried fruit into German territory.
Hereafter only fruit dried until it is
hard and moistureless will be exempt
ed from examination. The local Gov
ernment of Hamburg has anpropriated
14.000 marks to maintain, a bureau of
American fruit inspection in order to
expedite the clearance of fre*=>i fruit,
which under the present system, is de
layed for several days after its ar
i rival. â¢
Cavalry, who vas wounded at San
tiago, is a veteran of the Civil War. He
enlisted as First Lieutenant of the
Eighty-sixth Ohio Infantry in June,
1862, and served until the close of the
war, coming out as a captain. He went
into the army again July 28, 1866, as
second lieutenant, and went up the
grades until he was appointed a major
of the First Cavalry, May 23, 1596.
Captain Thomas J. Knox entered
West Point from Tennessee July 1, 1867,
and entered tlie^ army as second lieu
tenant of cavalry June, 1870. He was
made a captain in 1889.
Captain Lloyd S. McCormick is also
a West Pointer. He entered the Mili
tary Academy from Ohio and was
graduated in 1876, when he was ap
pointed a second lieutenant of the
Tenth Cavalry. He was promoted to a
captain's rank three years ago.

MADRID, June 25.â The much-talked
feature of the moment, when all are
asking what will come next, is General
"vVevler's declaration in favor of. the
monarchy. This may have much to do
with the greater feeling of calm to
day. The existence of a Cabinet crisis
Is denied by Senor Sapasta with abso
lute pood faith. He .further added that
at the council to-day the prospects of
war and not conditions of peace were
discussed.
The truth is that everything depends
to-day on the result of affairs at Santi
ago. Sasrasta will nut rush a crisis, be
ing aware of the difficulties of reform
ing the Ministry and establising a
government to meet the situation. One
feature is the perfect confidence of the
puhli â¢ in Sagasta. His latest statement
is that rumors of peace negotiations
are premature.
The Premier wants peace. He feels
assured that the country both wants
and needs peace. He knows that peace
made without the consent of the coun
try would mean an immediate revolu
tion. Should the country show itself,
strongly against the Prime Minister's
:ul wishes, you may count upon
it that Senor Sagasta will wish to place
the reins of government and the terri
ble responsibility for the continuance
of the war in other hands. In the minds
of all statesmen loyal to the monarchy
and in the opinion^ of important politi
cal elements and social spheres having
influence in Spain the idea of peace
gains greater strength every day.
Independently of the fear which the
Carlists and Republicans inspii , it is
certain the (.Government will take
means for placing before the country
the problem of peace. It is recognized
that the United State? will formulate
terms of peace which will be unpopular
in this country, and that none better
are likely t" be forthcoming. Accord
ing to a politician whose opinion I have
taken from much everyday contact
with the ruling spirits of the country,
he has got rid of the
Cortes, will take m-asures for the for

B%ys the Government would proclaim
the whÂ«.-le peninsula in a state of siege,
re-enforcing garrisons in the north <>f
Spain, Valencia, Catalonia and other
Carlist and republican centers, and
would then appeal to b 'me friendly na
tion, probably France or Russia, to
make terms of peace. One difficulty
which arises In this project is the at
titude of General Weyler. whose posi
tion in Spanish politics is not well de
fined, but in whom many see a leader in
the revolution.
General Polavlejo, while at Sara
gosa, on his way to Athama. to-day
received a telegram from the head
Government, causing him to change his
route and return at once to Madrid.
This is an eloquent fact to those know-
Ing what is going on behind the scenes
in the political world. General Po
laviejo will be sure of a place if a gov
ernment is formed to support the mon
archy ami carry out peace proposals.
The Cabinet held a meeting this
morning and later the Premier. Senor
Sagasta, went to the palace. He told
the newspaper representatives that the
Cabinet meeting was to be reconvened,
but he rr-fused to furnish any further
Information on the subject. Although
it Is officially announced that the Pre

The special ailments to which the femi-

LONDON, June 26.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Sunday Times says:
Admiral Carnara's fleet will not go to
Manila, but to another port in the
Philippines, to land troops in order to
hold a strong position. The fleet will
then be ready for action, and if Ad
miral Dewey wants to flpht he will
have to lwivo Manila Bay. Admiral
Dewey will thus either leave the bay
unprotected or divide his fleet. This
move has made a pood impression here.
Interest to-day centered in the meet
ing of the Cabinet. It is believed that
the >. misters favor overtures for peace,
but disagree as to the manner in which
they should proceed and this may pro
voke a crir ; s and precipitate the end.
SPAIN SENDS OUT
A LITTLE "FEELER"
Declares That Peace Suggestions
Have Been Made by the
United States.
MADRID, June 2f>.â It is reported
here that the peace conditions suggest
ed by the United States include the
possession of Porto Rico, the independ
ence of Cuba with an American pro
tectorate, a naval station in the Phil
ippine Islands, and a coal depot in the
Canary Islands.
WASHINGTON, June 25.â The an
nouncement from Madrid that the
United States has suggested peace con
ditions with Spain was received here
with great interest for the reason that
the report was regarded as a "feeler"
set afloat with the distinct purpose of
developing the state of public feeling
in America, as well as in Europe.
There is no basis of fa,ct for the re
port, for at the State Department it
met a prompt and unqualified denial
at every point. No overtures have
come to the department from any re
sponsible diplomat as yet, looking to
the consummation of peace. Still it
is known that some of the representa
tives of the European powers here,
realizing the serious inroads that are
making upon European commerce by
the continuance of hostilities, stand
ready at any auspicious moment to
sound our Government as to what con
ditions might serve as a basis of ne
gotiations for a brief period. These
diplomats would naturally closely
watch the effect upon the people of
the United States of such a rumor as
this coming from Madrid, and if the
general sentiment seems .to incline to
the acceptance of some such conditions,
they would be quick to advise their
governments in the expectation of re
ceiving instructions to approach the
Government of the United States on
the subject.
The terms suggested in the Madrid
dispatches seem calculated to tempt
that element In the United States
which, realizing the Impotence of at
tempting to restrain altogether the
popular desirp for territorial acquisi
tion, seeks to confine it within the low
est reasonable limits. The conditions
nro such as naturally might suggest
themselves tn the Spanish element
most inclined for peace as a proper
basis for negotiation, although It can
not be expected that they would ini
tially comply with the demands of the
United States.

KEY WEST, Fla., June 25.â A two
masted vessel, the Amapala. of Tru
jillo, Honduras, was brought in here
this' morning flying the American flag
and in charge of Ensign Zeen of the
Vlcksburg. She was captured yester
day afternoon at sunset while leaving
Havana and attempting to run the
blockade. She was quickly overhauled
and the Vicksburg found over thirty
women and children and a number of
Â«i 93 on board, crew and passengers.
There was no sickness on board the
Amapala, but she is detained at quar
antine. m"Â«Â«
ihe Amapala belonged to Emanuel
Montesino Monteres or Trujillo Hon
duras. Her crew numbers eleven men
besides the captain, but almost alFon
board were refugees.
M. Base, a French citizen, who three
years ago was a leading exchantr*
broker in Havana, chartered the %e s
sel and got together over forty oeonle
eager to embrace any chance to escape
from Havana. He was in charge of
the expedition, which was made up of
all nationalities, including Spanish
trench, Venezuelans, Cubans and
Turks. They fully expected to be cap
tured, but felt that any risk was pre
ferable to starvation.
The Amapala came out of Havana
and offered no resistance. All of the
captives are confident of release
Hardly any provisions were on board
at the time of the capture, and no cargo
of contraband articles was found and
the vessel may not be held. The pas
senges report everything quiet at Ha
vana, which looks like a deserted city
since business and traffic are at a
standstill.
The banking firms of H. Upton &
Co., J. Burges & Co., Vareisco, Ruez &
Co. and N. Golats & Co. are the only
ones doing any business. All other
firms are either closing up or dragging
on, waiting for the end of the war, and
have discharged all employes.
Starvation stares the lower classes
in the face. The well to do have laid in
three months' stores. After they are
exhausted distress will be general, as
there is no further source of supply.
The stories regarding the relief
through southern ports are denied.
Nothing has gone into Havana for over
a month, and the situation, conse
quently, is very grave. Murder and rob
bery are of daily occurrence In Havana,
prompted in every case by want and
hunger.

MORRO FORT
DESERTED BY
THE ENEMY
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, June 25.âMor
ro Castle, the most formidable defense
about Santiago harbor, Is reported on
excellent authority to have been aban
doned by the Spaniards. If this be true
' it will be the simplest task for Admiral
! Sampson, with such vessels in his fleet
as he deems necessary for the work, to
enter the harbor, attack Admiral Cer
vera's fleet and assist General Shafter
in capturing or destroying the cif of
Santiago.
Admiral Sampson has been ready for
a week to smash this last remaining
fortification at the entrance to the har
bor. It was his intention to have made
I the attack last Saturday, after he had
verified the information from shore
that Lieutenant Hobson and his Mluw
heroes ot the Merrimac were no longer
coiiiiiied in the ancient and picturesque
structure. h
If cue Spaniards have deserted the
castle the American fleet wilt likely
have little shooting to do until ft gets
within range of Cervera's ships.
The officers in the American fleet
have been Intensely indignant over the
course of the Spaniards in imprisoning
Lieutenant Hobson and his men in
Morro. They suspected this was done
solely for the purpose of deterring the
Americans from assaulting the castle.
The Spaniards apparently were com
pletely unnerved by the terrible de
struction done by the dynamite guns
of t>"Â» Vesuvius about the fortifications
across the harbor from Morro, and used
Hobson and his men as a shield as long
as they could with safety to them
selves.
It â¢-â been known to Admiral Samp
son for nearly a week that the Spanish
gunners have not dared to sleep in
Morro at night. They have been aban
doning their guns at sunset, returning
to the fortification early in the morn-
ing.
Neither Admiral Sampson nÂ»r any
of his officers expected the Spaniards
to desert Morro entirely. It it has
been abandoned it looks as if the ene
my intended to mass all its guns and
men in Santiago cit"- where one last
desperate stand against American and
Cuban forces will be made.

than the press reports. During the
course of the day several other dis
patches were received, but they all left
something to be desired, for, being un
der yesterday's date, they did not re
lieve anxiety as to what happened yes
terday evening and to-day with the
two armies separated by the short
space of a mile and a half.
An explanation of this state of affairs
was found in the fact that General
Shatter failed to take with him from
Tampa the splendid field telegraph
service that had been prepared with
much care by General Greely for just
such a campaign as is now being
waged. It is probable that he has al
ready seen his error and will avail him
seif of the instruments just as soon as
they can be sent to him. There was a
general expression of grief at the loss
sustained by the soldiers in yesterday's
fight. Still, officials in high places ex
pressed themselves as thoroughly satis
fied with the result, realizing that war
Cannot be successful without sacrifice
of life.
The Impression gained from one of
General Shafter's dispatches is that he
is now about to delay his advance until
he has secured his artillery. Such a
course will be dictated by common pru
dence, for it is known that the Span
lards have fortified as far as they could
advanced positions outside of Santiago
and it would be the height of folly to
throw soldiers unsupported by artil
lery against such works.
Unfortunately there promises to be
some delay in landing all the artillery,
owing to the loss on the voyage to San
tiago of the big lighter which seems to
be necessary to transfer guns from
the ships to the landing pier. The na
val authorities have responded prompt
ly to the appeal of the War Department
and some means will be found through
the aid of the warships to accelerate
the landing of the supplies and guns
Genffral Shafter's dispatches throw
considerable new light on the general
situation of the advance forces It
makes it evident that Major General
Wheeler, commander of the cavalry di
vision, is with the advance force the
Rough Riders and the cavalry forces
which participated yesterday, being a
part of General Wheeler's command It
is felt to be characteristic of the dash
and impetuosity of Wheeler that he
should be leading the advance, and it
is taken as answering some of the com
ments made upon the age of some of
the volunteer leaders.
General Shafter's report that our
troops are now about a mile and a half
from Sevilla shows how rapidly the
American soldiers pushed forward
They have already reached Juragua
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUN DAY, JUNE 2G, 1898.
I Sevilla Is the point where the Spaniards
I claim they will make a desperate stand,
and with our forces only a mile and a
half off it Is apparent that a decisive
fight is near at hand. It is five miles
from Sevilla to Aguadores (the interior
town, not the port) and two miles fur
ther to Santiago. This shows our
troops to be about eight and a half
miles from Santiago, according to Gen
eral Shafter's report.
The Captain Wainwright referred to
in General Shafter's dispatch as being
injured belongs to the First Cavalry.
His full name is Robert F. P. Wain
wright. He was born in Pennsylvania,
and appointed to the military academy
from New York.
Secretary Alger and General Miles
look for desperate fighting very soon.
The main attention is given to hurry
ing forward re-enforcements and stores
to General Shafter.
During the day Secretary Alger and
General Miles held several conferences,
not so much to go over the struggle
of yesterday as to give every military
preparation for the great struggle yet
to come. As a result, however, re
enforcements will go forward at once,
both from Tampa and from Newport
News. An expedition of 6000 men is
expected to leave Tampa within the
next three days. It comprises the
command of Brigadier General Snyder,
the Third Division of the First Army
Corps. The stores are already going
aboard the transports and the start of
the expedition only waits the arrival
of the naval convoy. Part of the war
ships sent over with Shafter's expedi
tion have been released from Admiral
Sampson and are now on their way
back to Tampa to escort the additional
troops. Others will follow and then
another formidable marine procession
will start across the Gulf to Cuba.
Whether the battle-ship Indiana will
lead this expedition, as it did the last,
is not definitely settled. There will
be several heavy warships, however,
as well as lighter craft, to give safe
conduct to General Snyder's division.
Simultaneous with this, General
Henry's division will be moving along
the Atlantic coast and thence to San
tiago. In all the re-enforcements from
Tampa arid Newport News will be In
the neighborhood of 12,000 or 14,000 men.
Drafts on Chickamauga are likely to
follow soon, as the hurry orders re
cently given have led to the full equip
ment of several commands.
The War Department is acting on
the theory that it is not politic to take
any possible chance of a serious re
verse near Santiago. The latest in
formation reaching the authorities here
shows that the Spanish army is greater
than has been estimated thus far.
Lieutenant Joyce of the regular army
reported to General Miles to-day, giv
ing much information as to the" num
ber and location of the Spanish troops.
Before Joyce entered the United States
army he had served with General Gar
cia and had traversed a good part of
Santiago Province.
He was on the ground only for a few
weeks ago, leaving there in April and
at that time he had opportunities to get
an accurate idea of the Spanish forces
at the eastern end of the island. He
reports the number at 37,000, of which
12,000 are in Santiago, 10,000 at Holguin
and 15,000 at Manzanillo. Once concen
trated at Santiago this would make a
formidable army, but separated by for
est and mountains, the insurgents are
expected to keep the force at Holguin
and Manzanillo from getting to Santi
ago. One of the curious features of the
situation was the opening of direct
communication between the Spaniards
in Santiago and the outside world over
the French cable, through the medium
of an American military censor. This
was effected to-day by the restoration
of the circuit running from Santiago
overland to the place on the shore
within the American line â Playa del
Este â where the cable begins which
runs across to Cape Haytien. At the
junction sits the American army offi
cer who discharges the duty of censor.
So far only test messages have gone
through over this circuit, but it will
be open to ordinary business that is
able to pass successfully both American
and Spanish censorship.
The Naval Department has acquired
the fine steamship Pedro, which was
declared a prize, having been captured
by the Nashville early in the war. She
was bought subject to prize liens and
was to-day christened Hector and or
dered to be converted into a collier. The
steamer Norse Kin. . just purchased,
has been christened Rainbow and
changed into a distiller to supply the
fleet with pure water.

SAUSALJTO, June 25.â One brief
month ago this little city was deemed
an ideal pleasure resort, a cool and
delightful spot where the warm sum
mer months could be whiled away
agreeably. To-day Its natural beauty
remains, and that is its sole attraction.
For the cause the chance visitor has
only to look along Water street, the
principal thoroughfare of the town.
"Poolrooms"â that one word tells the
story. â¢
The town has been blighted by them,
its good name dragged in the mud of
turmoil, and the decent citizens of the i
community nauseated by the presence
of a gang of inciters to law breaking,
fighting and boodling. Three of the
Trustees were elected on a poolroom
platform and did their dutyâ if such a
word may be used in that connectionâ
by voting for the poolrooms. But
when it came to the proposition of per
mitting two men, Harrison and Har
vey, to monopolize the profits of the I
business to please Christopher Buck- !
ley, there arose a rebellion.
Up to that time the poolroom gamb
lers had acted decently enough, and,
so far as mere personal behavior goes,
they have since then. These men come
and go, thinking only of their gains
and losses, and they never yet have In
sulted a woman in the town, notwith
standing the paragraphs of yellow
journalism.
But the townspeople have not de
ported themselves as well as the g^m- |
biers haveâ there lies the sting. There I
have been fist fights, wars of words, |
monetary corruption, cutting of tele
graph wires, and, finally, a threatened
shooting scrape. The occasion seemed
to be made for officials and "smooth"
lawyers like Sylva, such picnic scrap
pers as Creed, such weakling Justices
as Bellrude and^cJimpton and that riff
raff of a community hanging like vul
tures around every game of chance.
These have been in their element.
Why the Trustees refused a license to
the third comers can only be con- i
jectured. A peculiar thing in this con
nection is that nearly every honest |
man will conjecture the same way. But
they did, and to their action may be
ascribed the lamentable results. When
the wires in Broyer, Glynn & Hum
phreys' rooms were cut the far-seeing
townsmen saw coming relief to the
town's plight. The officials had leaped
in one instance before they looked by j
tampering with the wires c-f the com
pany doing business under a Govern
ment charter and bonded by the Gov- I
ernment. The company removed its j
wires, and in the expressive vernacular I
of "Billy" McMillan:
"I guess the whole shooting match is
over."
To-day Sylva, Harrison, Simpton and
others were in San Francisco petition
ing Superintendent Jaynea to place
their wires back. They were told that
only when affairs *.erÂ£ amicably settled
and the scenes that have daily dis
graced not only a single city but scan
dalized a county and even brought the
good name of the State into disrepute >
were stopped would the wires be put
back. As the San Mateo contingent
seems inclined to continue the agita- ;
tion it seems as though this trio will ;
have to be settled with before any pool- ;
room can operate. To true sportsmen,
those who have at heart the sport pa
tronized by royalty itself, there re
mains the hope that the town will dis
continue its disgraceful procedure, even i
if the "smooth" lawyer, the noblest j
scrapper of them all, the Justices that !
see law as others see it, and the whole j
gambling fraternity are forced to pick
up their beds and walk.
To-day the town was quiet. The ac
tion of the Western Union Company in
removing its wires from the favored !
pool-ooms after they had been cut in |
the San Mateo trio's place of business
prevented resumption of operations and
the gamblers did not cross the bay in
numbers.

For those who are puny ; for those who lack vim and
fire ; for those who feel a sense of unfitness for big
duties, there is pity. But as well as pity there is
hope. No single case has yet been presented that
has not been helped by "Hudyan." The simple truth
is that "Hudyan" curesâ and "Hudyan" cures always.
Admitting that you have been the most stupid man
on earthâ will you ask what can be done for you?
It will cost jou nothing to find this out. Why not
do it? Do you think that 20,000 men can be got
together to tell the same lie? You know they can-
not. Yet 20,000 men say that they have been curedâ
been made manly men by "Hudyan." You may feel
that you have transgressed too much, but that is
stupid. "Hudyan" has had to help much worse cases
than yours. And it not only has helped them, but it
has CURED them all. The army of grand, vigorous
men whose blood goes pulsating to every part of
their body to-day, who were weaklings months ago,
is the evidence. Warm, burly, grand manhood is
theirs to-day. It may be yours to-morrowâ no mat-
ter whether you have abused your stomach, your
brain, your liver or any other organ of your body.
The best medical advice is yours, too, if you will ask
for it. No cent of expense. Tell your troubles and
get the help. Blood taint is prevalent. If you notice
any sign of it get the help of the physicians at the
Institute. "Thirty-day Blood Cure" drives all sus-
picion out of the body at once. Like "Hudyan" it
can be had on trial. Its name is as firmly estab-
lished in the world as that of "Hudyan." It always
cures.

Special Dtcpatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, June 25.
The Senate proceedings during the
debate on the annexation resolution
â were enlivened to-day by a most
spirited colloquy between Senators
White and Morgan. The California
Senator administered to Morgan a
scathing rebuke for his arrogance in
assuming the role of dictator and im
puting to his colleagues dishonest mo
tives in debating at length the New
lands annexation resolution. White's
excoriation of Morgan greatly pleased
Senators who have hitherto sub
mitted to his a.rr"i, r ant dictation. White
simply flayed him alive. Morgan at
temi |y once ami mad.' a hu
miliating s] of himself by sug
gesting to the California Senator that
persona] differ- jht be mure ap
propriately settled outside the Senate
chamber.
White's scathing rebuke of Morgan
was called forth by the Alabama Sena
tor's insinuation that a filibuster was
being attempt* I and because he at
tributed dishonest motives to other
Senators. White, in replying to Mor
gan's Insinuations, said:
"Mr. President: Senators upon this
floor. I presume, have a ri^ht to their
opinions. They may have regard tor
the opinion of others. When the Sena
tor from Alabama makes any charge
against other Senators Involving the
honesty of their intentions or their pur
- in so far as I am concerned and
those Â«!ih concur with me it is dis
tinctly repudiated. An accusation that
in debate such as we are conducting
there has been anything but the
highest and best motives is founded
upon a misconception of facts, but that
it may be based "ii other motives is of
but little moment to me.
"The dictator of the Senate, be he old
or young, ought to be odious and he is
not, so far as I have I n able to ob
. very lofty in regard. There are
â¢ trs here who think that this is an
important issue and who have been
debating in good faith. An assertion
that they are debating it otherwise pro
either from corruption or imbe
cility. Vr. President, let us remember
that if at half-past 4 o'clock upon the
'â f Saturday we pee lit to try
to adjourn, we may hp honest in en
deavoring to absent ourselves without
filibustering. I have sat here for hours
when there has been ir>. the Senate but
one-seventh of a quorum and I have
m-ver made the point. Yet the Senator
to charge that we are filibuster
ing when he has absolved himself and
â with that inconsistency which is his
cteristlc and attribute, he throws
upon others th^ burden that should de
pend upon himself."
Morgan â The Senator from California

toward me. T wish to say to the Sen
ator that this- is not the proper place
for personalities. Tf ho thinks he has
pot any quarrel with me there is a bet
ter place tii settle it than this. We can
it outside of this chamber.'
Whiteâ Oh, Mr. President, the Sena
tor from Alabama, with his character
istic fairness, seeks to place upon re
cord here charges against men who are
associated with him in the discharge
of public duty, and denies to them the
right to traverse his unfounded sug
gestions. He cannot influence any
thing I say by anything of that sort.
From the initiation of this debate to
this minute we have been ready to
proceed according to order and have so
proceeded. This afternoon, our last
afternoon, when the Senator from
Georgia wished to speak, notice was
given those who control this debate
that he would rather have debate post
poned. We know it has been an op
pressive day: we know we have been
honestly trying to have this matter
pressed forward, and have advanced
only such arguments as appeal to our
consciences and our judgments, and
when we are accused of filibustering I
am justified In saying it is utterly
without foundation that we are pro
crastinating. Here to-night â suppose
for pyrotechnic purpose? â to be contin
uously further advertised, we are in
formed that there is a filibuster in pro
gress. That statement is absolutely
untrue. We insist that at this time on
Snturday evening the Senate ought to
adjourn. We have already agreed to a
resolution to meet at 11 o'clock on
Monday, for which I myself voted; and
nfter having Stood here and discussed
this question, when nearly half a day
has been taken up by the friends of
annexation, it is â  certainly not
a ground for exhibiting us be
fore the country as filibusters that we
have Flmnly asked for privilege which
ought to have been granted, and which
has been denied to this hour; yet the
Senator from Alabama has sat in this
chamber many a time recently and
heretofore'seeking to advance interests

under the constitution it was their

can be heard and we will be heard, and
that no orders will be received from the

to our position.
SESSION OF THE SENATE.
Business Transacted Before Annexa
tion Talk Was Resumed.
WASHINGTON. June 25.â The Senate
met to-day at 1 o'clock, but it was not
until fifteen minutes after that a quorum
was secured and proceedings began. Se
well (R. ) of New Jersey called up and the
Senate passed the bill providing for a
military secretary to the Secretary of
War.
The conference report upon the sundry
civil appropriation bill was ca..ed up by
Allison. The Senate amendment provid
ing for a public building at Butte, Mont.,
to which the House insisted on its dis
agreement, was advocated further by
Mantle of Montana.
Pettigrew of South Dakota, speaking: to
the recession of the Senate conferees
from the Senate amendment suspending
the executive orders of February, 1897,
making forest reservations in certain
Western Stales, criticised the action of
the House for insisting upon striking out
the amendment.
Explaining the contention of thr. House.
Allison said the House eonfereees refused
itely to go into the matter of sus
â  :â : the orders, because the proper
modification of them was in the province
of the executive department.
The for< stry reservation question was
--Â,] for nearly two hours by W u
son of Washington, Carter of Montana.
Cannon of Utah. Mantle of Montana and
Allison. The first three strenuously in
sisted that the amendment of the Senate
providing for an abrogation of the order
;:ng the reservation shou d be in
sisted upon. "Wilson had assurances from
the Secretary of the Interior that the
whole question would be pron^ny and
fairly dealt with to the satisfaction of all
persons Interested. The report presented
!> Allison was finally agreeed to.
The Hawaiian annexation question was
laid before the Senate at 1:40 p. m.
Pavis. chairman of the Committee on
Foreign Relations, offered a resolution
that hereafter, until further notice, the
Senate convene at 11 a. m. It went over
on an objection.
Pavis then promptly moved that when
the Senate adjourn to-day it be until 11
a. m. Monday, and the motion was agreed
to-42 to 11.
Turley (D.) of Tennessee then resumed
his constitutional argument against the
annexation resolutions. The Bpeech was
interrupted by an extended colloquy be
tween Foraker on one side and Allen
(P.) of Nebraska. Clay (D.) of Georgia
and Caffery (D.) of Louisiana on the
other. Foraker maintained that the an
nexation of Hawaii was not necessarily
an executive function.
At the conclusion of the colloquy Pet
ti grew offered the following amendment
to the resolution:
"That the contract labor laws and laws,
civil and criminal, now In force in s;ov.
islands by which men are held for ser
vice for a definite term, except in punish
ment for crime, whereof the parly has
been duly convicted, are hereby repealed
and all existing contracts are hereby de
clared void."
Turley then resumed his iretimr-nt.
At 4 o'clock Jones of Arkansas suggested
to Pa\ls that it might be desirable to
nave a brief executive session and then
adjourn.
"I would ask the Senator from Arkan
sas." inquired Pavis. "whether or not he
would be willing now to suggest when 8
vote might l>e taken on the pending reso
lution."
"So far as T am concerned." replieri
Jones, "I am willing to agree upon some
day next term for a vote.""
"That is quite illusory and impossible of
entertainment." said Davis. "Can the
Senator not make it Thursday of next
week?"
"That is even more illusory," responded
Jones.
"Then T shall call for the regular or
der, Mr. President." said Davis.
A systematic filibustering was then in
augurated. P-'tus (D.) of Alabama
moved that th- Vnate go into executive
session. The motion was lostâ ?,i to 15.
Allen moved to adjourn. This motion
was also lostâ :r> to 10.
Allen then moved that the Senate ad
journ until 11 o'clock Monday. Morgan
made a point of order against the motion
and it was sustained.
Then for half an hour Allen, sustained
by the opponents of annexation, con
tinued to suggest the absence of a
quorum or enter motions to adjourn. The
friends of annexation stood fast and re
fased either to adjourn or to go into ex
ecutive session.
Finally the regular order was called foi
and Berry of Arkansas insisted that a
division had been called for on one of
Allen's motions.
Wilson (R.) of Washington, in demand
ing atraln the regular order, intimated
that Berry was engaged in a "game."
This aroused the Arkansas Senator, and
he replied, heatedly: "I desire to say that
I have not been engaged in filibustering
or in any game, and any statement of
that kind by the Senator from Washing
ton is entirely ungrounded and unwar
ranted."
Morgan CD.) of Alabama then took the
floor and denounced as a "miserable poli
tical trick and intrigue," to which he
would never be a party, the proceedings
which had characterized the opponents of
annexation during the previous hour. He
declared that while the army and navy of
the United States were fighting the bat
tl*s of their country Senators were sit
ting in the Capitol filibustering
against a measure that was essential to
a proper conduct of the war against
Spain. It was the evident purpose, be
said, to block the progress of the Ha
waiian resolutions by any possible means.
"It is the duty of the Senate." snld Mor
gan, "to take action upon this great and
solemn question. The American people
are in no mood to be trifled with about it.
We are representing here men who are
shedding their blood for us. and instead of
consulting our convenience and pleasure
wo should be giving them our earnest sup
port. If the members of the Senate bad

and were obliged to stand guard we would

action we are placing enormous mrdens

THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUKE 26, 1898.
DEWEY AN UNDEMONSTRATIVE MAN.
Captain Coffin Tells oi the Interesting Personality ol
the Hero ol Manila.
Â® One of the arrivals on the Peru, wh ich came into port Friday morninpr, I
Â® was Captain George W. Coffin, who has seen service in the navy and was
Â® wounded in an engagement during the Civil War. He has been" traveling
Â® through Japan with his daughter for several months, and while there met
<â¢) Admiral Dewey and dined with him at Yokohama several times. The two
(â¢: have been warm friends for many years, fid Captain Coffin speaks highly
Â® of Dewey both as a man and a soldier.
Â® "Admiral Dewey," he said, "is a quiet, undemonstrative man, with very
Â® little to say for himself or his own actions and a great deal about those of
Â® others. In fact, I believe had I seen him just after the battle Instead of just
Â® before it he would have done his best to give me the impression i.iat some
Â® body else did it all and he was just an onlooker. He could spend an evening
Â® in telling of the valorous deeds and brilliant strategy of others without once "
Â® mentioning himself or his brilliant battle which has won him universal rec
Â® ognition and electrified the world. He says little and does much. When he
Â® left me just before the battle he gave no" intimation whatever that a fight
Â® was expected, rather conveying the impression that he and his fleet were
Â® there more on garrison duty than anything else. His manners would give
"~ the idea that he just intended to lay off and on along the coast, keep a look
Â® out, and make no move without explicit instructions trom Washington. As .
Â® a man he is mild mannered, gentlemanly and obliging, with perfect self-con
d) trol and that quiet air of assurance which makes one feeel that what he
Â® says is so. It is unnecessary to tell that he is a commanderâ the world
'Â® knows that. A man who could stand calmly on the deck of his vessel with
Â® shells bursting around him and the fate of hundreds of lives depending on.
(?) his judgment without betraying the slightest emotion needs no encomiums.
Â® His acts speak stronger 'than words.
Â® "The battle at Manila has had the effect of turning whatever public
r=> sentiment was doubtful strongly on the side of the Americans. Everybody
Â® knew that America was not a fighting nation, and many were Inclined to
Â® sneer at her fighting abilities. The press dispatches were garbled and read
Â® like many that have been published in this country emanating from Ma
Â® drid. The press had very little to say editorially, but what was said was
Â® rather of a sarcastic nature. One paper, commenting on the situation, de
(?) clared that as Americans had no naval experience it would be advisable for
Â® the Government to hire a few English gunners, while others opined that if
Â® the Government knew what it was about it would not trust its vessels to its
Â® own inexperienced commanders, but borrow a few from some other nation.
Â® Dewey has changed all this. He proved j that the American commander
Â® knew his book and knew it well, while any vessel coming within range of an
Â®\ American gunner was a very poor Insurance risk. The war is creating very
(â¢) little excitement in the far East, as it is so far from the base of operations
Â® and news is vague and unreliable. The people generally, however, are Â»ean
Â® ing strongly . toward the American side of the question."
Â® Captain Coffin is of the opinion that the only thing for the Government
Â® to do with the Philippines, now that it has them, is to keep them, or
Â® some other nations will be fighting over their possession as soon as the pro
Â® visional government is withdrawn.

the Senate wo are failing of patriotic i
duty. When you return to your const! t- '
urius. to the fathers whose sons arc- now ,
in the Philippine Islands, they will know
of this trick, und they will spurn you.
"1 thank God there is an American
spirit, and in that spirit 1 rejoice. It haa
already won for us glory that will last
as long as timeâ glory that will never be
dimmed. It has shown that the United
States is willing to wage a war for hu
manity, for Christianity, for liberty. Our
soldiers are to-day righting for humanity.
Christianity and liberty, and with ouch
marked skill and intrepidity that their
conduct will ever stand as a monument
to tli. in in the eyes of the world, and al
ways will command for th^-m the ad-Â«
miration of civilized nations. That we
should, in this august body, be laying
pipes to carry into effect >a political
scheme for the advantage of some party
at the November elections is Inconceiv
able, to use no stronger term."
Then came White's reply and scathing
rebuke.
Teller, in a speech, during which he en
deavored to throw oil on the troubled
waters, maintained that the Senators
â who were opposing the. annexation of ,
Hawaii could not be accused justly of i
impeding the progress of the war, as had
been intimated by Morgan. They had a
perfect right, he thought, to a full and
free expression of their views upon this
as upon any other question before the
Senate. However, he favored early ac
ii..M on the 'resolutions.
Teller expressed the opinion that this
country would soon be face to face with
serious questions of policy, but he
thought the American people could be
trusted tÂ« rightly and righteously settle ;
any questions involving the acquisition ;
of territory. Teller asserted that if
President, he would not tolerate any ad
dress from the concert of powers. He
also paid that he would resent any in
terference by Germany in the settlement
of matters in the Philippines.
..lien replied to the remarks of Mor
gan. He said he cared nothing about be- â 
ing called a filibuster, and that he would
maintain his convictions, regardless of
the dictation of MorgÂ»n. He resented
the expression that he desired to oh- j
struct the progress of the war, and said
this was mere "political rot."
At G p. m. the Senate adjourned.

Poor Fourth.
Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
CHICAGO, June 25.â Pink Coat Is a
double Derby winner. This afternoon
at Washington Park the Leonatus colt,
trained by Pat Dunne and ridden by
Willie Martin, flashed under the wire
in the American Derby a winner at
odds of 4 to 1, with Warrenton, W. T.
Oliver's candidate, but a nose behind.
Isabey secured third money, four
lengths behind Warrenton. Mirthful,
the 6 to 5 favorite, finished fourth, with
the rest of the field strung out.

and a heavy wind was blowing up the
stretch. Thirty thousand people wit
nessed the race.

half length in front of Bannockburn,

bunched. Eva Rice, with Burns in the
saddle, shot to the front and set the
pace, passing the stand the first time.
Bannockburn and Mirthful were very
close up, while Martin, on Pink Coat,
was last by several lengths.
After six furlongs had been covered
Littlefield let down the favorite's head
and he went to the front, winning eas
ily and opening up a gap of two
lengths. Martin, in the meantime, had
joined issues with the bunch and was
overhauling the leaders one by one.
Caywood was taking matters leisurely
with Oliver's candidate. Warrenton,
while Bannockburn seemed to have
something left.
It was Mirthful all the way to the
nine-furlong pole. Pink Coat,' Warren
ton and Isabey, who had been slow to
get in motion, attending him. Martin
called on his mount three furlongs
from home, and he drew away from
the field, apparenly an easy winner.
Mirthful shut up like a clam when
pinched, but Caywood made one of his
stretch rides and it was nip and tuck
to the last sixteenth, Martin's riding
landing his horse a % winner.

GREAT TRIAL STAKES
WON BY JEAN BEREAUD
NEW YORK, June 25.â One of the
largest crowds of the season visited
Sheepshead Bay to-day. The chief event
on the card was the $20,000 Great Trial
stakes, in which the crack two-year-old,
Jean Bereaud, was to carry 12!) pounds.
He was the favorite at odds of 2 to 5,
while Glenheim was well backed at 9 to
2. and the other horses were nibbled at
by the half-holiday crowd. :
â¢At the sixteenth , post Jean Bereaud
shot out of the bunch, and in an instant
he had opened a gap of three lengths
and it was all over as far as the others
were concerned, for they could never get
anywhere near him. He won very easily,
beating Kingdon four lengths. Mr.
Phinlzy got third place.
Then came the Sheepshead Bay handi
cap, in which Ornament declined to
carry the proper weight and was
scratched. The start was made in a ter
rific rain and dust storm. The horses
ran into it as they came into the
stretch. Taral. on Semper Ego, kept his
head, stole in the rail and in an instant
had come from the far rear and was
leading the way home, eventually win
ning what looked like a hopeless race
by three lengths. Results:
First race, five furlongs, â High Lee
won, The Gardener second, Ben Jxxli third.
Time, I:O4Vi.

0 BRITISH VIEW OF BRYONISM.
AS the organ of the bimetallists of Great Britain
the London National Review has looked with
favor upon the free silver party in this country
and cherished the hope that Bryan would yet be Presi
dent and silver receive a boom. That hope has now
faded. Maurice Low, who acts as correspondent at
Washington for the Review, has no longer any faith
in the immediate future of either the silver party or
its champion. In his contribution to the June num
ber he virtually gives up the fight and predicts not
only a Republican victory this fall, but the retirement
of Bryan from the position of a Presidential candi
date.
The argument of Mr. Low is simple but effective.
"Times in the United States," he says, "are improv
ing; no one can question that assertion. Business
shows marked vigor. War, instead of causing stag
nation, is stimulating many lines of trade, and the ex
penditures of the Government are putting millions
of pounds into circulation." He then draws the con
clusion: "All these things militate against Mr.
Bryan's hopes of again receiving the nomination. Be
lieving, as I do, that the silver agitation of two years
ago was more social than economic and was the ex
pression of discontent due to depressed industrial
conditions, it follows that with these conditions re
versed the silver movement loses much of its force."
Summing up the situation the reviewer says: "Mr.
Bryan is too closely identified with silver to make it
possible for him to take up any other Issue or to sub
ordinate silver to any other cause. Provided condi
tions remain as they are, that trade continues to im
prove and America finds a ready market for her sur
plus wheat, the Democratic party two years hence
must make its campaign on something else than sil
ver, and some one else than William J. Bryan must
be its standard-bearer."
These can hardly be called the views of an impar
tial student of our politics, for the National Review
has been as partial to Mr. Bryan as could be expected
of a foreign publication having no affiliation with
American parties. They are to be considered the
opinions of a critic accepted from a study of the situa
tion, who would have preferred the situation to be
different. They show that the belief in the decline of
*Bryan and Bryanism in this country is not confined to
Republicans and gold Democrats. It is shared by
all intelligent observers of the politics of to-day and
is amply confirmed by the result of the election in
Oregon and the extreme uneasiness In the Demo
cratic ranks since that result was made known.
At present all shades of Democrats are hunting for
a new platform, or perhaps since the Congressional
elections are approaching and the party is all at sea
they are hunting for any sort of planks that are not
too waterlogged to make a raft. In their eagerness
to get hold of something to keep them from drowning
in the coming tidal wave they are reaching for every
6traw in sight. There will probably be a different
Democratic declaration of principles in every State in
the Union. In the language of Alex Stephens, every
candidate will "tote his own skillet." As for Mr.
Bryan, he will make a campaign outside the country
and "tote" nothing but a red sash and a sense of dis
appointment.
For an assurance so nearly flawless as to excite the
admiration of the observer a certain Santiago paper
certainly excels the best heretofore record3d. In a
recent issue it failed to so much as hint at war, while
by land and sea were approaching forces destined to
cause its fall. On the contrary, the merry editor
wrote of the plan for placing electric lights in the
plaza, discussed the current church fair and devoted
his space to personal gossip. He may not be a great
journalist, but he has the finest nerve in Cuba.
While the dedication of a church was in progress
in North Dakota lightning struck the building,
knocked an end out of it and killed two people. The
item was so briefly mentioned in the telegraph that
it may have been overlooked by some one who would
be glad to draw a moral from it.
Since the Standard Oil people are trying to get a
monopoly of the copper product there may be danger
that the metal in a cent will become more valuable
than the metal in a dollar, a circumstance certain to
demoralize the financial system.
Only the other day reports came that Kansas farm
ers could not find men to harvest the crops. Now
comes a report that the State is overrun with unem
ployed. There is always something to be said about
Kansas.
In only one instance has any affront been offered
the soldiers from Tennessee, and it is cheering to be
able to record that the aggreisors on this occasion
not 6oundly thumped.

and his ability as a protean politician. In 1887
he played his farewell engagement as a Dem
ocrat because the party was not in favor of putting
all taxes on land. Early in 1888 he was roasting the
{ Pope in a book published from the office of his weekly
organ, the Star. Later in 1888 he vaulted back into
the Democratic party, though it had not changed its
attitude upon the issue on which he left it, and now
he is advertised to lecture to various church so
1 cieties of tha.t communion whose head is the Pope,
whom he called "the serpent of the Vatican."
When he concluded to want to be Governor his
single tax views appeared as an impediment. Farmers
.and land-owners felt that they were paying about as
much tax now as they can stand. They felt that to
leave all personal property, money, pictures, statuary,
jewelry, manufacturing plants, steam and street rail
roads, stock of goods and every conceivable form of
property except land free of tax and put all the bur
den on land would destroy them. Aware of this, Judge
Maguire proceeded to abjure his single tax views.
Through his daily organ, the Examiner, he announced
â  that the single tax is a theory that is not yet within
' the domain of practical politics.
Yet in a recent letter, written and signed by him
and printed in the Seattle Times, he says:
The effect of so simple a change In our fiscal sys
tem as the adoption of the single tax would thus pro
duce a marvelous revolution in social and industrial
conditions, and present to mankind such an example
of universal and uninterrupted prosperity and hap
piness as would make all the nations of the world
pure democracies within a decade. â¢â¢ â¢ â¢
I trust that the State of Washington may lead
the vanguard of civilization in this great advance. I
can imagine no place in the history of civilization or
of the world that would crown a State with more
imperishable glory.
Now here we have the protean artist. A fiscal policy
that is going to find everybody fat and turn all
America, Europe, Asia and Africa into pure dem
ocracies within ten years is so much within the do
main of practical politics in the State of Washington
that Judge Maguire urges that State to "lead the van
guard" in that reform. But in California he declares
that the same reform is not within the domain of
practical politics at all. In the State of Washington
he is a single taxer. In California he is, as usual, a
candidate for an office. He is in the habit of diverting
public attention from these shifts and contortions by
yelling "railroad" at every critic of his demagogy.
A recent issue of his weekly organ, the Star, does
this for him with great noise. He and the Star pur
sue the same policy. It called the Pennsylvania
militia "rattlesnakes" and said it was no crime to kill
them in any way, by poison or burning their quar
ters while they slept, or derailing trains on which
they traveled. But when the same regiment which
the Judge's organ wanted murdered came to San
Francisco it dared not repeat in their presence what
it said when they were 3000 miles away. The editor
of the Judge's weekly organ does his mouth valiant
business to perfection, but drops the heroic to s^ave his
skin, just as the Judge drops his principles to get an
office. This editor, Barry,announced not long ago that
a certain person in this city had no rights under the
law and ought to be shot and should be shot by any
one who chose to use ammunition in that way. The
next day the man so denounced met Barry on Mont
gomery street and spat in his face three times and
then blew his nose in his face, and Judge Maguire's
editor stood and took it without resistance, and in the
next issue oi the Judge's organ praised his own "pres
ence of mind" for not resisting, because if he had he
might have been more seriously injured than merely
serving as a sort of combination spittoon and pocket
handkerchief.
The Judge and his editor are truly well paired. One
could respect them even in their errors if, having
written and printed that the Pope is "the serpent of
the Vatican" and Cardinal McCabe "a red-capped
hound," they would stand by it and take the conse
quences. Men respect those who show the courage
of their convictions, though the convictions may be
erroneous. When Maguire said that taking Spanish
prizes was piracy and his organ said the Pennsylvania
militia were rattlesnakes, if they had stood by it their
courage would have been creditable. But they don't
stand by anything. If Judge Maguire were a leader
of men instead of a demagogue he would announce
himself a single tax candidate for Governor and show
the strength of that party in this State. But the de
sire for office exceeds any devotion of principle, and
will send the single tax to the rear with the Pope as
a "serpent," the militia as "rattlesnakes" and his
editor's "outlaw" who could be shot on sight, to re
main while he gets in the middle of the street with a
brass band, so that an office that may be out seeking
the mnn will be sure and see him.
THE FORTUNES OF WOR.
WHILE the war is but two months old, it has al
ready done a good deal of that shuffling of
men for which all wars have been noted.
Citizens of all classes have been taken out of the
order they held in peace and arranged in new grada
tions. Some have risen and some have fallen, accord
ing as the chances of the new shuffle have brought it
about.
An obscure seaman, a man of few friends and no
prestige, plays the part of a stowaway on the Merri
mac and shares in the glory of Hobson and his com
rades, winning reputation, promotion and an in
crease of pay. The son of one of the oldest and
wealthiest families in New York, bearing a name il
lustrious in our history as well as foremost in social
circles, enlists as a sergeant in the Rough Riders, gets
killed in his first skirmish and receives hardly so much
as mention from the crowds that shout applause of
the stowaway.
From Cleveland comes the story that a private in an
Ohio regiment is now serving under a captain who
before the war broke out served him in the capacity
of coachman. The private was a man of wealth and
of patriotism. He enlisted among the first to fight
for the flag, but he was not fitted for command, so
he went to the ranks. The coachman was poor, but
he had not only patriotism but a military aptitude
which he had developed in the National Guard, and
he received the shoulder straps and the sword.
On May 10 in the city of St. Louis there was a
young man serving as a cigar counter salesman in a
hotel who felt and responded to the impulse of war.
On May n he was a soldier in the ranks. Two days
later he was made corporal, and five days later he re
ceived his commission as a lieutenant in the Missouri
volunteers. Within two weeks he had shown such a
capacity for military affairs that he was made bat
talion adjutant and in that position is winning praise
on all sides.
About the time the cigar counter man was arrang
ing to enlist in the ranks the son of ex-President Har
rison, the son of Vice-President Hobart and the
grandson of President Grant were exerting their in
fluence at Washington to obtain assignments to
showy positions on the staff of General Lee. They
were successful. The cigar man has been promoted

and intrusted with important dutres, while Major
Russell Harrison, Major Hobart and Lieutenant Al
gernon Sartoris at last reports were detailed by Gen
eral Lee to inspect potatoes at Tampa.
This rough shuffling of personal fortunes by the
rude hand of war has just begun. It will go on from
month to month. The cards will fall as time and
chance determine and will be dealt out in new com
binations. At present Dewey is the national hero
and three young Southerners, Bagley, Hobson and
Blue, have won the hearts of the people by their
courage and made their names familiar in men's
mouths as household words. In the course of the
conflict new heroes will come forth, and when the war
is over many an old star will have faded out of the
horizon and a new galaxy will be in the ascendant.
ODMIROL DEWEY'S STATUE.
IF the Supervisors shall finally decide to remove
the Cogswell fountain at the junction of Pine and
Market streets it is to be hoped they will not en
courage anybody to erect a statue of Admiral Dewey
in its place. To locate in such a spot the figure of the
hero of Manila would be in the nature of municipal
blasphemy. If we are to honor the old sea dog â
which seems to be highly appropriate, since he saved
us from being blown up by Spanish warships â let us
erect a monument in Golden Gate Park, where, sur
rounded by fragrant flowers, green lawns and whisr
pering trees, it may present some of the attributes of
a work of art.
Undoubtedly the time has arrived when it is proper
to dismantle the Cogswell fountain at the junction
of Market and Pine streets. That affair has long
since ceased to be even an artistic nightmare. Be
sides, in its treatment of Dr. Cogswell's donations
the municipality has disgraced itself, and it is emi
nently proper that the evidences of its ingratitude
should be obliterated as soon as possible. The Super
visors have allowed the Cogswell fountains stored at
the City Hall to fall into decay and have permitted the
one now proposed to be removed to be knocked
into pieces by small boys. If Dr. Cogswell had had
the sense to get himself elected Mayor before present
ing these fountains to the city his donations might
have fared better. Yet there is no telling what will
happen to Mayor Phelan's fountain at the junction
of Turk and Market streets when his official term ex
pires.
But to return to the assault which is about to be
made upon art. No statue of Admiral Dewey should
ever be erected in this city upon a business street. If
his admirers hereabouts desire to honor him prior to
his death they should shrink from the enterprise now
proposed as from a pestilence. At the junction of
Market and Pine streets, sunounded by drays and
boxes in transit, and subjected to the vulgar hum of
streetcar cables and jolting cobbles, the hero of Man
ila in bronze would present a sight calculated to
shock the artistic sense of a Zulu chief. No such dese
cration should be considered for a moment. If Ad
miral Dewey were ever to visit San Francisco â which
he will in the near future â the .ight of himself in such
a spot might prove more disastrous than a Spanish
shell.
We are heartily in favor of honoring the na^al won
der of the century, but let us by all means place him
in Golden Gate Park along with Garfield, Halleck,
Key, Douglas Tilden's ball-player and the others.
In that beautiful place the trees, the flowers, the
grasses, the sunshine and the birds will inspire those
who contemplate him with something of the poetic
grandeur that ought to surround the figure of so
great an American.
It givffs one a chill to think of Admiral Dewey's
statue at the intersection of Pine and Market streets,
amid the drays, the cobbles and the boxes in transit.
Dr. Cogswell's fountain ought to be removed, but for
Heaven's sake do not let us put Dewey's in his place.
Future generations will mob some of our artistic
creations anyhow, and we should aim to give posterity
as little offense as possible.
DISTRIBUTING THE BURDENS.
AT a recent banquet of brewers in Philadelphia,
where it seems the convivial company dis
cussed business as well as other things, one of
the speakers declared the best way to meet the 'war
tax on beer is for the dealers to be less prodigal in
selling by measure. He is quoted by the Philadel
phia Record as saying that a too large measure
tempted the people to indulge to excess, and that the
desirable thing,,in the interest of sobriety, was not
that people should drink more beer, but that more
people should be converted to beer drinking.
There is no froth in that argument. It is as full of
meat as a fresh egg from a Petaluma hen. It pro
poses a saving for the brewers, temperance for the
people, an extension of trade and a revenue for the
nation. There is economy, morality, prosperity and
patriotism in one sentence. He that puts too much
beer in keg or stein or glass corrupts the nation, but
he that pours out the beer in moderation is a public
benefactor.
The argument advanced at this banquet under the
inspiration of Gambrinus is of advantage to more peo
ple than brewers. There is instruction in it for
all classes of producers whose stock in trade is sub
ject to the war tax. The maker of mixed flour will
find in it an argument for putting more of the mixture
in the flour. By so doing he will give the people a
greater variety of ingredients in their food and will
encourage abstemiousness in the use of starchy ar
ticles, thus preventing many forms of disease and
promoting public health.
Tobacco men will readily see how they can check
the tendency to an excessive use of tobacco among
the people by putting more cabbage leaves in their
stock. Tea men kno,w that over indulgence in tea is
injurious to ladies, and will readily act as temperance
agents on this subject by putting more dust in their
cheap teas and more willow leaves in the better
grades. Bankers will perceive tha* high rates of inter
est paid depositors or low rates allowed to borrowers
tend to cause extravagance in the American house
hold. Being friends of morality they will gladly act
together to check that tendency by taking part of the
war tax on the banking business out of the depositors
and part of it out of the borrowers.
In short, we are about to become a nation of people
devoted to the welfare of our neighbors. The tem
perate phrase, "Not that people should drink more
beer, but that more people should drink beer," will
serve as a motto for all lines of war-taxed industry.
Morality is going to be practiced and the burden of
taxation is going to be distributed, in the names of
economy, temperance and patriotism.
One class of tax-burdened people alone cannot
share in this movement. The man who has an in
heritance tax to pay will find it hard to devise a
means for getting rid of the tax and at the same time
improvinghis neighbor's morals. To inherit a million is
going to be a purely selfish business. The best thing
expectant heirs can do is to coax their rich relatives
not to die until the war is over and the inheritance
war tax repealed.
It is time to revive a once popular statement to
the effect that the colored troops fought nobly.

About the process of being jilted
there seems to be something which
arouses all the heroism latent in a
man. No sooner does a soldier by sea
or land attain to fame than uprises
the plenteous sweetheart averrin^ that
under such and such circumstances in
the dear dead past she gave him the
mitten. Already we are made glad by
an array of women who had a chance
to be Dewey. There is a Merritt set of
these, too, of whom a roster is being
prepared, while the Hobson list is re
ceiving daily additions and ; .retching
to an imposing magnitude. It would
appear that the chief occupation of a
military or naval man when not on the
warpath is to go about by night and
by day casting his heart and fortune
at the feet of beauty. It is a circum
stance worth considering that revela
tions concerning these sentimental af
fairs come from the ladies themselves.
The heroes are apt to be busy men.
Possibly they forget about them.
There comes to me a letter from Mrs.
Mary Smith of 2029 Virginia street,
Berkeley, which I read with attention
and respect, congratulating the lady
upon having an opinion to express, as
well as the ability to express it. That
her view seems to me to be narrow and
her conclusions all wrong is a circum
stance of trifling importance. The
writing of the letter was incited by a
recent editorial in this paper tinder the
caption, "The Essence of Treason." I
remember the editorial well and agree
with it fully. It was a rebuke to Presi
dent Eliot and others who denounce the
present war as unpatriotic and un
necessary. Mrs. Smith upholds Eliot
and believes that millions of others do.
Possibly she is correct. If there are
such millions they fail grievously in
their duty, as citizens, rare little for
national honor, and see in the flag
nothing but a show of cheap bunting.
They are governed by a rule of selfish
ness, and while they descant upon the
horrors of war have not the perspicu
ity to look beyond the smoke and flame
of battle to grander achievements of
peace, impossible save when the armed
strength of civilization rises to beat
back oppression and ignorance. Mrs.
Smith draws a picture of war, a famil
iar picture, a terrible picture. Then
she peremptorily reaches the verdict
that war ought not to be â a kindly
verdict, but one sweeping justice aside
and leaving the downtrodden calling
vainly for help, placing a smirch upon
our name, and the brand of cowardice
over us all. Mrs. Smith had not
thought of these things, and I ask her
to consider them. She utterly Ignores
all the beneficent effect of war. She
says nothing of great wrongs to be
righted, of integrity to be upheld, of
assassination to be rebuked and check
ed. She seems to regard war, declared
after mature deliberation, after our
dignity as a people had been assailed,
our men murdered, as occupying the
moral plane of a fight between ruffians
In a ring. She takes no note of the
hundreds of thousands slain by Span
ish cruelty, the millions held in practi
cal serfdom. Had this nation declined
to take up the gauntlet thrown down
by Spain it would have been despised,
and the stain washed out only in a tor
rent of blood far more appalling '-in
can possibly mark the present struggle.
The war has awakened Europe to the
fact that we are here, and to be con
sidered In the affairs of the world. The
spirit of aggression ha*d been gaining
force. Had we not shown our strength
now, sooner or later it would have had
to be displayed against a mightier
power, and many nations in all likeli
hood been involved. So the present war
makes for ultimate peace. I do not be
lieve in turning the other cheek, and a
people should be as manly collectively
as individually. If Mrs. Smith's coun
sel were to prevail, a few generations
and the United States would be elim
inated from the map. the nation re
membered as one that died because not
fit to live. Such are my views as op
posed to those of Mrs. Smith. I ex
press them with the utmost venera
tion for her sex and her years. She is
a woman of three score, the mother of
half a dozen men. My hat is off to her,
and I think she Is mistaken.
On the stage Richard Mansfield is one
of the most finished of actors. Off the

overbearing, ridiculous snob. One ad

Therefore the report that Mansfield is
to leave the United States causes mixed
emotions. We will try to get along.
There are other actors who are fairly

are not ashamed to be civil.
As a rule Magee's Circular portraying

being lost, it keeps on its course, buy

is a beautiful art, worthy of all en-
couragement. The capitalist with mil
lions to spare may live in a shanty if
he choose and count over his gold, or
put it out at interest, and be called a
miser-. If a man elect to own a palace
and pay for the making of one he has
done a substantial as well as an ethical
good. If to dwell therein with comfort
he keep an array of servants, so much
the better. But he can close up the
place and go to Europe, or even die,
without taking from the city the bene
fit of his liberality. However, I am not
advocating extravagance* For the or
dinary journalist the $50,000 domicile is
good enough. But the man of many
millions could not be extravagant in
expenditure, for in expenditure lies his
opportunity to do good.
Among the things I freely confess an
inability to understand is why certain
papers that praise Roosevelt for going

doubt that they are both good citizens

there is no reason for supposing the

Far be It from me to say that Peter

fails to enlist the approval of the judg
ment. With such a sum at command
he would have whooped things up in
England until the overflow of enthusi
asm had reached and made radiant the
Continent. He would have shared at
tention with the Kaiser and the war
cloud. Yet Pete was never heard of
until he appeared here, wholly devoid
of inclination to hide his light under a
bushel. Among his modest assertions
is that he was reared to opulence by a
seal hunting papa who made his head
quarters 600 miles north of the north
pole. I do not profess to be a geograph
ical sharp, and would be glad of expert
testimony in this matter. How could
a man get north of the north pole
without being south of it? According
to my somewhat vague idea the base
of the north pole Is as northerly as
there Is hope of reaching. To climb
the pole would of course be to get be
yond this limitation, and yet there ia
no reason to believe, that the pole is so
constituted that a nimble Pete could
shin it. Assuredly the pole is not 600
miles high, even if it has proportions
such as may be measured, and if it
were of this imposing length the diffi
culty of scaling it would be almost in
surmountable. It is for these reasons
I deem Peter adrift from the mooring
of veracity and floating on a sea of
guff. The last word is not elegant, but
it seems to fit Peter's case.

UNCLE SAM'S EMPIRE.
Editor San Francisco Call: The state
ment has been made â assuming that tha
exigencies of war have extended the own
ership of the United States over the Span
ish colonial possessions now under mili
tary occupationâ that "the sun never sets
on Uncle Sam's dominions." A careful
study of this subject shows that the east
ern limit of the United States is at longi
tude Â£6 deg. 56 mm. west from Greenwich,
and that the western limit of the Philip
pine Islands is at longitude 116 deg. 40 mm.
east, approximately. The extreme of ter
ritory embraced within these limits Is
176 deg. 24 mm., or nearly sn. which i? 3
deg. 36 mm. less than a hemisphere. As
the sun's rays do not embrace mote than
a hemisphere in the tropics, it follows
that from the last glint of sunshine upon
the remotest islands of the Palawan archi

THE REAL COST OF WAS.
In the great struggle between Franc*
and Prussia the former lost as many
as 130,000 men, <-f whom some 80,000 died
of wounds received in battle, 36,000 by
sickness, accident, suicide, etc., and
20,000 in German prisons.
A French statistician estimates that
his countrymen who were wounded, but
who survived, numbered 138,000, those
injured on the march or by accident
11,421, those who recovered from Illness
328,000, making a total of 477,421 direct
sufferers. The Germans killed numbered
40,877; 17,255 died on the field, and 21,023
in the ambulance?, making 79,155 In all.
The wounded who survived numbered
18,543 men.
From first to last the German field
artillery fired 340,000 shots, and the in
fantry 20,000,000. The booty or war con

tents at Camp Merritt and the
Presidio this forenoon and march
to the docks. The troops are under or
ders to leave their several camps at 11
a. m. with one day's cooked rations.
The route of march from the camp to
the water front will be designated by
the commanding officer of each organ
ization.
To-morrow at 9 a. m., General Mac-
Arthur will report to Major General
Merritt, U. S. A., commanding the
corps, to receive final instructions pre

THE THIRD SQUADRON .
Four Ships Ready to Receive
Troopsâ Activity Aboard
the Valencia.
The Ohio, Morgan City, Indiana and
City of Para are now ready to receive
the troops, while the cargo did supplies
are being rushed into the Valencia as
quickly as two hatches can receive them.
The Oregon steamer State of California
was inspected by Major Long yesterday
and the Columbia will be looked over as
soon as she gets in from Portland. The
Government has now decided to dally no
longer with the owners and all the ves
sels required will be tak^n willy nilly as
they come into port.
The vessels over which Major Long is
keeping a watchful eye are the big col
lier Willamette, due here from the Sound
next Tuesday, the Oceanic Steamship
Company's Alameda, due here on the
29th. from Australia, the Mail Company's
Acapulco, due here from Panama on the
30th, the Rio de Janeiro, due here from
China on July E and the Marlposa, due
here from Australia on July 27.
The Willamette was fitted out to carry
a thousand gold-hunters in a very short
epace of time last season and she could
easily be made ready to carry a thousand
troops, all their equipmonts and two
thousand tons of freight Inside a week.
All the other vessels are first-class pas
eenger si earners and could be got ready
In the same time as it took to outfit the
other transports.

A BAYONET WOUND.
Private J. W. Terry of the
Twentieth Kansas Seriously
Hurt by a Comrade.
Private J. W. Terry, one of the recently
arrived recruits of the Twentieth Kansas
Regiment, was bayoneted yesterday
morning by Private Gorovens of the same
regiment and seriously wounded. The af
fair was an accident, but, all the same,
Terry now lies In the regiment hospital
with a deep wound In his left side, and the
surgeons are of the opinion that the man's
liver may have been penetrated by the
bayonet.
At the time of the accident Gorovens
was doing guard duty and Terry had been
detaile/1 to throw some wood Into camp
that was just over the guard line. He
had just completed his task and was In
the act of climbing over ffie fence when
Gorovens halted him.
For some reason, evidently because he
became alarmed and "rattled," Terry
made a break and ran. and Gorovens
wont in pursuit. In rounding a tent
Terry tripped over a rope and fell, and
Gorovens, who was almost upon him, fell
over his prostrate form, and in doing so
ran the bayonet several Inches Into
Terry's baok^ The unfortunate soldier
was taken to the regimental hospital for
treatment. No blame is attached to
Gorovens.
Terry's wound may prove fatal.
HOSPITAL, AT MANILA.
General Merritt Approves a
Plan of the Red Cross
Society.
The Red Cross Society will have a hos
pital in the Philippines. The patriotic
women who have tendered the^r gentle
care as nurses will be acknowledged by
the Government.
General Merritt crumpled the anti
nurse edict In his soldier's hand yester
day and gave his consent to the scheme
of humanity that the Red Cross Society,
has been earnestly but quietly working
ever since it has had the reckoning
power of sufficient money.
The plan of the society is, briefly, to es
tablish a hospital equal to the emergency
of the campaign at Manila; to thorough
ly equip it with all the appliances of the
humane side of modern warfare, and to
provide nurses of either sex, whose ser
vices shall be voluntary. The society
plan does not contemplate a corps of sur
geons. The medicines and the gentle care
necessary to convalesce it will supply,
but the surgeons will be detached from
the corps of the general field hospital.
This point was among the many conceded
yesterday by General Merritt.
This will be welcome news to hundreds
of patriotic women who, though deeply
disappointed at the refusal by the Gov
ernment of their services on the battle
ground, have labored untiringly for the
health and comfort of the thousands of
men in the peaceful camp.
CHRISTIAN ENDEAVORERS.
Their Good Work at Camp
Merritt Is Appreciated by
the Boys in Blue.
The First Baptist Church social Friday
evening at Camp Merritt was a very en
joyable affair, one of the features being a
touching address by Pastor Woods.
Last evening the First Methodist
Church of Oakland entertained the sol
diers, and this evening a praise service
will be held.
The entertainments this week will be
in charge of the following: Monday,
Howard Presbyterian; Tuesday, First
Presbyterian; Wednesday, Good Tern-
plars; Thursday, Westminster and First
United Presbyterian; Friday, Mrs. Hol

At the last meeting of the executive
committee of the Mothers' Christian En
deavor Club a vote of thanks was passed
to The Call for furnishing papers each
morning to the reading and writing room
at the headquarters; also to the San
Francisco News Company for periodicals.
In the past few days over 4000 comfort
bags have been distributed by Mrs. Fow
den to the soldiers, and the following let
tqr shows how these bags are appreciated'
"CAMP MERRITT, June 24. 1898
"To the Ladles of the Christian En
deavor Society: We, the members of the
Engineer Corps, thank you for the fine
comfort-bags which you so kindly sent
The soldier is an appreciative being if you
only examine him closely, and our men
will always remember your kind acts
while we were at the ferry and at camp,
and if we never have the pleasure of meet
ing you personally you may be assured
that somewhereâ and perhaps around a

TJTOOFS WILL LEAVE CAMP FOH THE SHIPS AT It O'CLOCK
Orders were Issued by Major General Otis late yesterday afternoon
for the troops comprising the third expedition to Manila to break
camp at 8 o'clock this morning, and to take up their line of march at
11 o'clock for the wharves where lie the transports on which they are
to embark for transportation to the Philippines.

of the Eighteenth and Twenty-third United States Infantry, Idaho
Battalions, Thirteenth Minnesota Regiment, Wyoming Battalion, Corps
of Engineers, the Signal Corps and batteries G and L of the Third
United States Artillery.
No line of march is designated in the circular letter, but the troops
will leave Camp Merritt at 11 o'clock and probably proceed down
Golden Gate avenue in a body to Market, and from there the different
commands will take the easiest and shortest route to their respective
transports. The troops act as independent commands in marching to
the vessels.
The Astor Light Battery and Batteries H and X, Third United
States Artillery, have not yet received their orders to break camp.
Many men call at the Endeavor head- i
quarters for medicines on hand and do- \
nations of these will be gratefully re
ceived.
The King's Daughters have contributed
$32 toward the work of the Endeavorera ;
at the camp.

the soldiers donating something toward
the work which they bo much desire to
see continued. During the past few days \
donations have been received from the !
H. H. Scott Coal Company. Mr. Callagan,
Company L. Eighteenth Regulars; Mrs.
Thomas R. Hayes and N. McKellar. Mr.
Miner will keep the Kansas tents supplied

FOURTH EXPEDITION.
Major Long Proposes to As-
semble Another Fleet in
a Very Short Time.
Now that the transports of the third
Manila expedition are ready for the re
ception of the troops Major I-iong, the
depot quartermaster, under whose super
%-ision the steamers have been put in
condition for i~-Â« long voyage, is now
making up the flotilla of the fourth ex
pedition, which will be prepared to sail
in a few days. The * aciflc Mail steam
ship Peru was secured yesterday, and the
City of Puebla, which was recently char
tered, will be in shape to receive coal
and supplies in a day or two. Several
other steamers are in sight and the pros
pects are that tue fourth squadron will be
assembled this week. The steamers
Queen, Columbia, State of California and
Oregon, all belonging to the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company, will not be Im
pressed, owing to the fact that their
deck houses make them unsafe in a ty-
poon.
Sixty men of Batteries G and L, Third
Artillery, will not be able to sail on the
third expedition for Manila, owing to a
lack of room. They will go into camp
at Camp Merritt and win be under the

sail for Manila to-morrow, will be under
command of Major Kobbe.
AMONG THE VOLUNTEERS.
Colonel Frost Receives a Visit-
or â An Array of Misfit
Blouses.
The members of the battalion of the
Sixth California, on fluty at the Fort
Point fortifications, are indebted to the
Red Cross Society for lavish supplies of
medicines and delicacies for the , sick
members of the command, and the mem
bers of the hospital corps, through the
medium of The Call, desire to express
their heartfelt thanks to the ladies for
their work. No surgeon is attached to
the battalion, and the writer of the com
munication to The Call says the. society
has done a world of good in caring for
the invalids at the camp for which the
soldiers wish to acknowledge their deep
est gratitude. The camp ot the Sixth is
situated near the old fort, but it is not
too far away for the Samaritans of the
Red Cross to minister to.
Colonel Frost, of the First South Da
kota Regiment, received a visit yester
day that was a surprise as well as a
source of much gratification to him. His
caller was Captain William Hoffman, U.
S. A., retired, who was in command ot
Colonel Frost's company in the Eleventn
Infantry years ago. Colonel Frost en
tered the regular service as a private in
IhÃl, and was commissioned sece^^ lieu
tenant in 1884. He last saw Captas^Hoflf
man when he was ordered to take his ex
amination for promotion fourteen years
ago, and his surprise and pleasure ai

meeting his old commander again may be
imagined.
Captain John B. Jeffery has arrived
from the East and assigned to duty at>
quartermaster of the First Brigade on
the staff of General M. P. Miller. Captain
Jeffery Is a veteran Journalist of Chicago,
and for twenty years had the manage
ment of the Journal of that city. He Is
registered at the Palace, but will take up
his quarters at Camp Merrltt to-day, li
w%fl through the efforts of Captain Jel
fery that Duncan B. Harrison, the actor
nmnager, secured his appointment in the
army, that gentleman being accredited to
Illinois.
The graceless members of the South Da
kota regiment have found that it is a
real pleasure to be soldiers when there
are ludles to help them out. The boys
have recently been issued a lot of gar
ments the conscienceless contractors call
uniforms. They are of every conceivable
shape and quality, and of dazzling shades
of blue.
These uniforms, according to army reg
ulations, must be numbered, which reg
ulation the contractors strictly adhere to,
but with no regard for honesty. Pants
measuring 42 inches waist will be num
bered 32 inches and No. 1 blouses will be
marked No. 4 or any other number that
comes handy. Once Issued, the quarter
master does not bother to change for a
better fit, and the boys looked like a sec
tion of the Darktown Rangers until they
hit upon a bright scheme. There is a de
tachment of ladies of the Catholic Truth
Society in camp, who originally intended
to establish a reading-room for the boys,
hut this has been turned into a free sow
ing circle by the soldiers, who by various
arts and devices have cajoled the sym
pathetic ladies into altering their clothes
into a semblance, of a fit. It is amusing
to see how cleverly the young scamps
manage to get thrir sewing off onto these
ladies, who never seem to realize that
they are being "worked" in more ways
than one. But some day, when the boys
fet to bringing in their socks to be
arned, there is going to be an insurrec
tion.
Private Sweeney of X Company, First
North Dakota, was tried yesterday before
the general court of the Fourth Brigade
on a charge of disobedience of orders.
The findings will be published to-day. The
court, of which Lieutenant Colonel Lee
Stover is president, will sit again to-day
for the trial of such prisoners as may be
brought before It.
MONTANA VOLUNTEERS.
Ready to Go to the Front and
Meet the Enemy Face
to Face.
The boys of the First Montana Regi
ment want to get to the front as speedily
as possible. Here is an expression of
opinion sriven by Montana volunteers:
Editor Call: We volunteered to fight for our
; country, to engage the enemy face to face
; and not stay on any oast to hear about others
doing the fighting. We are not afraid to face
the enemy, and as for standing hardship our
regiment can hold Its own with any other
regiment that ever came to San Francisco
\\e all quit our work at home to go
i straight to the front. We did not enlist for
j what money we could got. but to fight. If we
, had wanted money we would have staved at
home where we got from J9O to $123 a month.
Instead of enlisting for $15 a month.
We were the first rpeiment mustered Into the
T nlted States service, yet we have had no
chance to go to the front. We want to keep
up the reputation of the Montana pioneers
who fought Indians. All we ask Is a chance
to fight the Spaniards. We are also willing
to donate to the fnlted States six months nay
for the privilege of going to the front

TILDEN ENLISTED.
First Man of the United Com
mercial Travelers' Associa-
tion to Join the Army.
J. C. Tilden, a musician of the Seventh
California "Volunteers, was the first mem
ber of the United Commercial Travelers'
Association to enlist In the army for the
war. His. exam pie created surprise and
enthusiasm in th# ranks of his fellow
travelers.
The order was In session a few nights
since, when the outside guard observed
a man in the uniform of a soldier ap
proaching the door. The soldier respond
ed to the challenge by giving the proper
signal. Further along the second guard
was encountered, but he was not inclined
to accept the responsive signals. The man
in uniform, knowing the work and the
countersign, insisted on admission to the
inner council, and carried his point.
Once inside Tilden in his uniform cre
ated a sensation. The drummers in se
cret conclave wondered how a soldier got
inside. The president on the throne sus
pended proceedings, left his elevated
chair and descended to the floor to test
the right of the unexpected visitor to re
main. Tilden was up to the mark in his
recollection of grips, signs and responses.
The presiding officer, not satisfied with
the investigation by grips and signs,
made a keen personal observation and
then recognizing the face of Tilden ut
tered an exclamation not to be found in
the ritual. "Boys, it is Tilden," shouted
the president, and instantly the soldier
was the central figure of the assembly.
Tilden was congratulated by all and sev
eral promised to emulate his example. J.
C. Tilden is well known on the coast as
the representative of shoe and leather
houses. Since he joined the army other
travelers have enlisted for the war.

Hospitality Appreciated.
That the courtesies extended the Penn

Paymaster Gait of the Baltimore
Tells of the Great Battle in
Manila Bay on May 1.
The steamer Coptic, which arrived In
port Friday night, brought to this city
two men wno were in the heat of the
battle off Manila on May 1. They left
Manila with Captain Gridley and were
with him at the time of his death. One
of them Is Paymaster William W. Gait,
the other George A. White, pay clerk.
Both were attached to the Raleigh. Pay
master Gait is on a leaye of absence on
account of having poor health. Mr. White
accompanied him, his term of sea ser
vice having expired.
After the battle of Manila Captain
Gridley became seriously affected with
intestinal troubles and, much against his
will, was forced to leave the ship. Ac
companied by Paymaster Gait and Pay-
Clerk White he left the Olympia and
COMMANDS THE FOURTH BRIGADE.
COLONEL ALFRED S. FROST, First South
Dakota Volunteer Infantry.
One of the youngest y and at the same time most promising of the command-
Ing officers in the Eighth Army Corps is Colonel A. S. Frost of the First
bouth Dakota, who has just relieved General Mac Arthur of the command of
the Fourth Brigade at Camp Merritt. Colonel Frost belongs to the regular
army, with the rank of first lieutenant in the Twenty-fifth Infantry
Colonel Frost enlisted in the Eleventh Infantry in 18S1, serving as private
corporal and sergeant until August 7. ISS4. when he was appointed second
ieutenant of the Twenty-fifth Infantry. Pie was promoted to first lieutenant
in loWi.
From the time he entered the army until 1594 he was stationed on the fron
tier .md saw much hard service in the Indian campaigns. In the last
named year Colonel Frost was placed on detached service and ordered to
South Dakota as professor of military tactics at the State University and af
terward on the Governor's staff as inspector of the National Guard
When his regiment was ordered to the front on the breaking out of the
present war Colonel Frost was ordered to join it and went to Chickamauga
where the Twenty-fifth was in camp, tmj; was recalled to South Dakota to
take command of the First Regiment of Volunteers.
Colonel Frost is reputed to be one of the best drill masters and tacticians
in the army, and is the idol of the men in his command.
boarded the transport Zaflro, which car
ried them to Hongkong, where they were
to be transferred to the Coptic. On the
journey from Hongkong to Kobe Captain
Grldley became rapidly worse. Soon aft
er arriving in Kobe he died, the cause of
the death being intestinal hemorrhages.
It was expected that Gait would return
with the remains of Captain Gridley, but
he did not wait over in Yokohama. The
body of the deceased naval officer was
embalmed in Kobe and carried on the
Coptic to Yokohama. There Gait re
ceived notice that he was to take charge
of the body and the effects of the de
ceased. Later he was advised to have the
body cremated. With befitting ceremo
nies this was performed in Yokohama,
but the Coptic, leaving in advance of the
time for the ashes to be brought to this
country, aid not carry the urn contain
ing what the incinerating fires had left
of Captain Gridley's body. They will be
brought over on the Rio de Janeiro. which
is expected to arrive here on July .". The
personal effects of Captain Gridley are in
charge of Mr. Gait and they will be
forwarded to his wife at once.
In regard to the battle of Manila, Mr.
Gait had little to say. He expressed him
self in general terms about the magnitude
of the victory. "It is still a miracle to me
how it happenedâ that such a battle could
have been fought with no damages to one i
of the principal parties engaged. Of I
course. I can never hope to be in such an
engagement again. Battles of that kind
do not happen often enough for one man
to see more than a single engagement of
tnat character."
Mr. Gait was about to Impart some in
teresting remarks made by Captain Grid
ley, summing up the character of the
victory, but recalled his vows of taciturn
ity just in the nick of time, and now the
world will have to wait until Mr. Gait
writes his account of the battle to hear
of the utterances of the brave commander
of the Olympia on the most wonderful sea
victory of late years.
In speaking of the ease with which the
batteries of Cavlte were passed by the
American ships, Mr. Gait said that the
Spaniards were unprepared, though they
had a superabundance of ammunition and
splendid guns. According to the ex-pay
master of the Raleigh, the marksmanship
of the Spaniards is a fit^ubject for gross

New Signal Instruments.
The signal service of the California
street police station has been â patly im
proved by the addition of a new set of
signal instruments made at the fire alarm
repair shops from the plans of Superin
tendent Hewitt. The idea is entirely new
and novel in police signaling, and does
away with the cumbersome ta~ c for

which were run into the station in a hap

in through an underground cable to a
handsome oak sounding-board.
All downtown signal boxes may now be

THE RAG TAG BRIGADE.
"Dr-r-r-rub! dr-r-r-rub!
Dr-rub! r-rub! r-rub!"
The Rag Tags were coming out of
Folsom Street.
"Hurrah! hurrah! we sing the Jubilee!
Hurrah! hurrah! the flag that made us free!"
They were turning into Third.
"So we sang the chorus from Atlanta to ths
sea.
When we were marching throiiÃh Georgia!"
They were nearing the corner of Mar
ket.
"Hurrah! hurrah! we sing the Jubilee!"
The crowd rathering on the streets
to hear tht> parsing of a finer band, to
look on the passing of a handsomer
the passing of older pa
triots, turned to see the absurd little
procession coming up the street.
"Hurrah! hurrah! the Bag that matte us free!"
The sound of the drum was shallow â
but it is ..luays the old roll. The voice
of the fife was tinâ but it is always the
old tune. The look of the flag was
â¢orryâ but it is always the old Hag.
Men laughed kindly as the Rag Tags
passed them by. Women looked after
them and smiled and wiped their eyes.
"Hurrah! II::rr "
"Halt," said the Captain. "Look out
fer de car."
The motor hummed around the cor
ner and the Rag Tags lined against the
curb. Their Captain passed them ap
provingly in review. He was about
seven, with a small, sweet, soiled coun
tenance as cheerless and grave as a
little white owl's. His military breeks
had begun life as overalls and been
painted over by some impressionist's
brush In broad, free, devious lines of
red and white and blue. A cambric

Judging by the energy displayed by
the members of the Native Daughters'

given the Fifty-first lowa regiment on
Tuesday evening next will be one of
the grandest affairs of its kind held in
this city for some time. A tremendous

in preparation for their coming a large
number of prominent Native Sons have
been pressed into service as ushers.
Tickets were issued yesterday and be

eyes looked out from under hats and
caps of every shape and size. Their
irresponsible toes looked out of boots
and shoes of every size and shape.
Beyond these uncontrollable differ
ences, they were uniformed with care.
You could pick them apart by the col

down their little breeches. Their
knobby little legs were leggined in news

Would you like to know lmw I got It? I saved
all my car fare nickels for the last month and
always walked, walked, walked no matter how
warm It was.
And will you please tell the boys I didn't
mind it one bit: whenever I got very tired I
would think of our soldiers and all the hard
ships they have to suffer for us and for our
dear "Old Glory." and then I would not feel
tin d any more at all. I only wish it was more
money, but I think if nil the children in the
city that are well and strong would save their
car fares we could get a great, great many
nickels for the Red Cross Society. And please
don't forget to tell the soldiers that we all love
them very much, and I hope they will all come
back to their fathers and mothers, and I am
sure we'll have a glorious victory. My cousin

SALINAS, June 25.â For some months
past residents of Pine Canyon, near
King City, have been complaining that
houses were nightly entered and robbed
of sugar, fruits, etc. Of late houses
were eefe afire, and barns and put
houses burned. Suspicion pointed to a
little boy not yet 9 years old, named
Leopold Ortiz, and a full investigation
has proved him guilty.
Last week the house of Frank Hoover
was destroyed by fire after having been
robbed. Hugh Ulrey of King City
swore to a complaint against young
Ortiz and a constable started in search
of the culprit, but the little fellow had
fled. After a search of twenty-four
hours he was found hidden in some
brush. When arrested the lad, who
takes great delight in boasting of his
crimes, made a full confession of sev
eral burglaries and of having fired
Hoover's and other houses. He said
he stole a rifle from one cabin and shot
at people who passed him, doing this
in the way of practice so he could be
come an expert deer hunter.
Ortiz is bright and intelligent but
very small for his age. His father
works for one Molera on the Sur
ranch and his mother lives In Pine
.Canyon. She is paralyzed and unable
to look after him. He has been left
alone and has become a veritable young
Arab. The officers here are puzzled
over the case and hold the prisoner to
await further developments.
IN LONG'S DEFENSE.
Hugh Craig Tells of What the
Quartermaster Is Doing.
President Hugh Craig of the Chamber
of Commerce states that he and A. A.
"Watkins, president of the San Francisco
Board of Trade, have made an Investi
gation Into the charges that Major Long
of the quartermaster's department of this
city Is purposely letting contracts for the
making of soldiers' clothes to firms em
ploying Chinese. They are convinced that
"Drop de kid," said the Captain,
touched in his military pride. "You'se
hospital corpse at ease!"
The dead and wounded was rolled un
ceremoniously out of a profound, open
eyed slumber and dumped on the bak
ing curb. He rose resentfully.
"What's de matter wid you, Jakie?"
inquired the Captain.
'Xuthin'. I'm hot."
"This is ice cream to what you'll, get
in Manila," said a man in the crowd
facetiously.
The woman on the curb gave a little
start. "Wouldn't you boys like some
ice cream?" she said looking at the
Captain.
The Rag Tags came to attention like
a squad of regulars.
"Come on!" she said, c arting down
the block.
They broke ranks and followed her
with a rush. The crowd followed them
to the confectioner's door. Inside, the
Rag Tags stood in expectant joy before
the tables.
the major is acting in good faith with the
people and the department and that he is
doing much for the benefit of the city and
coast. AH of the contracts entered into
by the officer and the contractors specify
that no Chinese labor shall be employed,
and a break in this particular will result
in the cancellation of the contract. Major
Long, Mr. Craig says, has already broken
several contracts where he was satisfied
that the contractor had violated his
agreement by employing Chinese.
Mr. Craig said that the only reason why
he became identified in this discussion was
in the interests of the city, which has,
through the efforts of Major Long, dis
posed of $750,000 worth of food and other
supplies for the equipment of the soldiers.
By the end of this month about $750,000
more will be paid out here by the Govern
ment for charters and equipments for the
ships. Mr. Craig said: "I Wave seen some
correspondence from Washington compli
menting the department here for the
speed with which it equipped the soldiers
who have left this State for foreign coun
tries. The quality of the goods sold and
the time in getting the same into use was
ahead of anything in the Bast. This hag
so pleased the department officials that
they have sent two officers from the army
to this city to learn how it was done.
Theso officers are from Tampa, and their
instructions are to take a lesson
from the Department of San Fran
cisco in expedition; also to learn if
San Francisco can be depended upon for
equipping an almost unlimited number of
troops. Major Long, in answer, has tele
graphed that all the supplies necessary
can lie obtained here. This means much
to this city, and it is very bad taste to
begin killing the bird that lays the golden
egg."
Mr. Craig says that Major Long has
not the time to go hunting around to find
out if the contractors for the soldiers'
clothes are employing Chinese help, but
if he learns of such violations he will put
a stop to the work at once.
MAJOR LONG AGAIN
ON THE GRILL
LABOR COUNCIL TAKES TFB THE
UNIFORM QUESTION.
Letters Will Be Sent to Washington
Calling Official Attention to the
Facts of the Case.
Quartermaster Long, the officer who is
credited with having given soldier uni
forms to the Chinese for manufacture and
insulted white women who applied for
work, received a grilling at the Labor
Council meeting on Friday, in comparison
with which the outer atmosphere was
colder that a Klondike Christmas.
After more or less desultory conversa
tion, in the course of which the Major
was called several things which would not
look well In print, J. K. Phillips moved
that "all the correspondence and evidence
in the possession of the council, proving
Major Long to be a cowardly liar, be for
warded at once to the proper authorities
at Washington." Other members of the
council, while agreeing that this action
was good, did not consider that it thor
oughly covered the ground. Mr. McAr
thur suggested that a mass meeting be
held which would arouse such a storm of
public sentiment that Chinese labor on
army supplies would be done away with
forever, while Mr. McAullffe thought it
would be a good plan to make a canvass
of Chinatown and see how many of the
Mongolians, "who are fighting one an
other over the profits of army supplies,
| would be willing to enlist." After con
i siderable discussion, which roused the
! council to the fever pitch of enthusiasm.
Mr. Phillips' motion was adopted, and all
i the evidence against Long will at once be
put in the hands of the proper authorities.
The Joint committee from the two cen
tral bodies recommended that a picnic be
"Sit down," -he said, glowing: with
her good deed. "Sit down anywhere."
The Captain of the Rag xgs coughed
significantly. "Side Captain!"
A taller boy crowding to a place be
side the dead and wounded looked over
his shoulder Impatient of delay.
"Lieutenant!"
A very littie boy rose from a place
already gained.
The Captain seated himself with dig
nity at a table and pushed back two
chairs from beside himâ "Dis," he said,
"is de officers' mess. You'se come over
here."
The facetious man came In to see the
fun.
"When do you think your troops will
get off, Captain?"
"I dunno."
"Next transports?"
"I dunno."
"You really think you'll get there?"
"We'se '11 get dere before you'se."
The Rag Tags applauded their com
manding officer's joke like soldiers to
the service born. The facetious man
laughed good naturedly.
"Been organized long?"
"Yep."
"What do you call yourselves?"
"Rag Taps."
"Where did you get that name?"
"It wuz give to us."
"Where's your headquarters?"
"Folsom an' Alice."
"Do you have regular drill?"
"Yep."
"What time?"
"No time. We goes up to headquar

It is proposed to hold an open-air mass
meeting in the park during the after
noon instead of hiring a hall in the city,
as has formerly been the custom.
Trade matters generally were reported
as rather dull, particularly with the
printers, a great many of whom were
thrown out of work by the recent strike.
The musicians reported that a non-union
band was employed at the recent fight in
the pavilion, despite protests, and that
Messrs. Groom and Gibb. who represent

BELIEF FOR FORESTERS.
An Organization That Will Help
. Those of the Order Who Have
Gone to the Front.
At a meeting last night of the repre
sentatives of the local courts of Forest
ers of America and circles of the Com
panions of the Forest of America a com
mittee, appointed at a previous meeting,
presented a plan for the organization of
an association for the relief of Foresters
who are in the army and navy and their
dependents.
The plan which was adopted Is that the
association shall be known as the Be
lief Committee of the Foresters and Com
panions of America. The object is to give
to Foresters in the service of the United
States such practical assistance as they
may require before going to the front,
to help the dependents of such Foresters
in securing employment if in need of such
while the head of the family is at the
place of duty, and to aid those who may
be, by reason of sickness, unable to earn
a livelihood. Each court and circle will
be asked to contribute the sum of $5 as
a fund for a beginning, and every mem
ber of the order shall be eligible to mem
bership on payment of an enrollment fee
of 25 cents and the payment of 10 cents
per month during the continuance of the
war. The courts and circles that contrib
ute the sum of $5 will be entitled to send
three delegates, who shall constitute the
supervisory board.
Julius L. Wildy offered to print the cir
culars of information to be sent to each
court and circle, and these will be sent
out this weeK.
Mrs. E. W. Haughy of Inter Tsios Circle
was elected secretary, and after the ob
jects of the new organization had been
fully explained an adjournment was taken
until next Friday night in the Alcazar
building.

used nstead of a sailing vessel, so the
trouble which always folloWed in the
wake of a sohooner having to stand off
and on while the cargo was being put
aboard in lighters will be done away
with.
The Clipperton Island guano deposits
were worked originally by an American
syndicate, but when it tried to sell its
interests to an English concern the
Mexican Government laid claim to the
Island and sent out a gunboat, whose
captain hoisted the Mexican flag over
the "speck on the ocean." At the
time there were a number of men on
the island working the guano deposits
for the Oceanic Phosphate Company of
this city, and all the men save one
went to Mexico on the gunboat. The
solitary individual would not desert his
post and sooner than be carried away
he jumped overboard and swam back
to his island home. Now the Pacific
Islands Company, Limited, with Ma
condry & Co. as agents, has been
formed, and it is going to work the
rich piles of fertilizers on the island
for all they are worth.
In order to put the venture on as
economical a basis as possible the Pa
cific Islands Company sent to Hono
lulu for forty Japanese laborers. These
arrived on the steamer Peru last Fri
day and are now in quarantine on An
gel Island. No attempt will be made
to land them, but they will be trans
shipped to the steamer Alice Blanch
ard and sent direct to Clipperton.
The Alice Blanchard has been in all
kinds of business on the coast. She
has carried lumber from northern ports
and was in the passenger business be
tween here and Port Los Angeles. She
was in the Puget Sound trade and
when the Klondike rush was on last
year she carried gold hunters to the
far North. Lately her owners incor
porated under tbe name of the Alice
Blanchard Company, with H. Mohr as
president, and his j i;,t stroke of busi
ness was to charter the vessel to the
Pacific Islands Company.
The scow schooner John Nag-el ran
amuck yesterday and demolished one
side of the Harbor- Receiving- Hospi
tal. The tug Amelia was docking the
schooner at the \i ision street bulk

tug gave the schooner considerable
way and then dropped her. The cap
tain of the scow figured on his anchor
holding, but It gave way and the
schooner's bowsprit crashed through
the side of the building, completely
wrecking the sleeping-room provided
for the doctors. The bedstead was
knocked over and smashed into pieces,
while a chair was turned into kind
liner wood.

WILL FITTINGLY OBSERVE IRELAND'S CELEBRATION.
Extensive Preparations Being Made by the Promoters of the Big- Irish Fair,
Which Is to Be Held Shortly at the Pavilion.
HE Irish a- air continues to receive encouragement from its many friends
Tand well wishers, both in this country and Ireland. A large quantity of
printed matter and beautiful Irish manufactures were received yesterday at
headquarters, all these things being sent as contributions to help swell the
fund of the Celtic Union.
Manager Buckley has Just received a communication from the Interna
tional Steamship Company, setting forth that they had received a cable
from Queensnown, saying that the Irish soil and sod, carefully packed in casks,
had been shipped by steamer last Tuesday. On its arrival in Philadelphia the
Custom-house duties will be paid, and a committee appointed, consisting of Mrs.
Ellen A. Ford. of the Irish World, New York, and Mr. William Lyman, who will
see that it is placed in a special car and sent direct by the Pennsylvania Rail
way and Southern Pacific to San Francisco.
As it is expected here in about four weeks the committee on arrangements Is
to take immediate action, looking toward a proper reception of it. It was de
cided that a parade, with the different Celtic organizations and the members of
the executive committee, officials of the Irish Fair, members of the honorary Ad
visory Board In carriages, should be arranged, and that the sod should be taken
along Market street in appropriately decorated wagons to the Pavilion. It will
be stored in the annex of the Pavilion, which has been rented by the Jirish
Fair management, until the week of "he opening, when it will be placed on the to
pographical map of Ireland in the balcony with appropriate ceremonies. Instead
of having a day parade it has been suggested and will be adopted that the pa
rade be given at night, with red, white and blue and green lights burned along
the rou!i-.
OAKLANDS
DEFEATED
Sand Crabs With Luck
Beat Them.
IT TOOK TEN HARD INNINGS
STUPID WORK CHARACTERIZES
OAKLANDS' PLAY.
The Game Was Very Interesting and
Had It Not Been for Errors
and Stupidity Oakland
Would Have Won.
BY JOE CORBETT.
Yesterday's game at Recreation Park be
tween the Sand Crabs and Oaklands was,
from a spectator's standpoint, a very
good and interesting one. It took just
J ten innings of long drawn out playing to
. decide the winner, which honor fell to the
; Sand Crabs by a score of 8 to 6. They
deserve an unlimited amount of credit for
the game, uphill light they made, with
I defeat staring them in the face at al
! most every step: yet the fact that the
game was in reality won through the
stupid playing of a few of those Oak
land stars is very difficult to overlook.
Some of their mistakes, which occurred
at most critical stages of the game, were
really unpardonable, especially the very
stupid work of Mr. Sykes, who, if he had
caught either one of Arrellane's flies in
the eighth inning, would have won the
game for the Oaklands. It is very sel
dom that three different opportunities are
i offered to retire a man, yet such was the
case with.Arrellanes in the ninth inning
yesterday. He was the first man to bat
in the ninth inning, and one run was ne
cessary to tie the score. His first at
tempt to- knock the cover off Mr. Moskl
man's shoots resulted in a fly ball, which
fell to the ground untoucned, despite the
fact that Sykes stood waiting for it. He
resumed hostilities with no better luck,
another fly ball going into Sykes' terri
tory; but this time the lanky Sykes made
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 26, 1898.
not even an attempt to capture the ball, ,
wnich would have been an easy play for
him had he but tried. Donovan came all :
the way in from right field and almost
caught it, which fact had a tendency to
make the play appear much Bimpler than
it way. This was the second chance of
fered to retire this lucky fellow, but fate
decreed it otherwise, for on his next at
tempt he hit a fly square into Donovan's
s and the "dear boy" gracefully
dropped it.
Tins chap Arrellanes afterward scored '<
with two men out and his run tied the ;
Therefore, Sykes and Donovan i
had a great deal to do with the defeat '
of their team, yet they were not tne'only i
offenders. O'Neil, Moskiman and
Schmeer each had an error, and they
were errors that were of the miserable
order, coming as they did In the last in
ning. Had they been less conspicuous i
Santa Cruz never would have scored in j
that inning, and there is no telling but
that the game might have been finished
by lamplight.
The account of the last Inning, owing
to its sensational finish, will no doubt be
interesting. McGrath, the first man up,
hit an easy grounder to O'Neil, who fum
bled, and the runner was easily safe.
Burge then hit to Moskiman, who threw
beautifully to second, and Schmeer
dropped the throw, at the same time put
ting aside a chance for a double play.
Then Daubenbis hit a pop fly to Sykes
and was out. Up to this moment the side
should have been retired, but baseba'l is
a peculiar game, and evidently Moski
man was laboring under such an impres
sion, for the next ball he delivered went
clear to the grand stand, and the runners
naturally advanced. Then came that Icl
low Arrc.anes, whom Providence had
been so kind to the inning previous. He
cracks out a clean hit to right center and
one run crosses the plate. He then si irt
ed for second. O'Neil intercepted the
throw down and in his anxiety to pre
vent the man on third from scoring threw
wild to the plate, making his second er
ror of the inning. This ended the run
getting for both sides, as Oakland c.Â«uid
do nothing in its half of the tenth, so
the game was, therefore, turned over to
the Sand Crabs.
It will be readily seen that they were
unreasonably fortunate in coming out
victorious, but they should be compli
mented for their unceasing efforts, a
characteristic of the team greatly ad
mired.
A decided Improvement was noticeable
in their play, both at bat and on the i
bases, which no doubt results from daily ;
practice. Mr. Balsz, who occupied the
pitcher's box, also gave evidence of prac
tice. His tossing of the ball underhand
to first base on one occasion was much
admired by yours truly, for it demon
strates that a pitcher realizes what he Is
doing, and Mr. Baisz, on a play of this
nature, has very often given the opposite
impression. All through the game he was
very â teadjr, and after the first three in
nings pitched masterly ball.
His opponent, however, was very ec
centric, ;nid pays entirely too much at
tention to base runners. This accounts
for his wildness, no doubt, and 1 would
advise him to let a runner on second
hasp, with two men out, do as he
pleases. By this I mean, look ac him
only occasionally, as it takes but a
glance to disconcert him. The batter is
the man you want in such a case, and
give him your uninterrupted attention.
The star play of the game was made
by Mr. Devereaux. who after a hard run,
captured a fly ball with one hand, much
to the delight of those present. The
catch was remarkable when one consid
ers that Bill took his eyes off the sphere,
thinking another player was going to
take it, and on realizing his mistake,
stuck out one hand, catching the ball
about a foot and a half from the ground.
Outside of this one play the game was
devoid of brilliant plays, unless it be Mr.
Hardies unsuccessful efforts in center
field. His judgment of line hits certainly
will never bring any medals, but Lou is
a good old soul, and he made a hit, so let
us live in the expectation that he will
some day go through a. game without
serious Injury to his mental faculties. A
rapid decay is bound to set In, Lou, if
you don't display a little more energy.

Some of the large newspaper publishing houses of Ireland are arranging for
a large booth to be known as the Irish newspaper booth. They will send
special editions of their papers to be distributed and sold for the benefit of the
fund. The Freeman is taking the lead in this arrangement.
It was decided to build a round tower, as being the best Illustration of Irish
architecture, and the famous tower at Kells, on the line of the Great Northern
Railway, was chosen, as being one of the best specimens. It will be reproduced
In exact facsimile on the main floor near the band stand.
Invitations were extended to Messrs. R. P. Doolan, P. J. Healy and Joseph M.
Cummings of the Mechanics' Institute to serve on one of the entertainment com
mittees.
Captain Casey of the Knights of the Red Branch was present as a delegate
from that organization, with power to arrange for floor space, whereon they ex
pect to erect a beautiful booth which will be one of the most attractive In tho
fair. A plan and sketch for the same Is being prepared by Architect W. M.
Campbell, who has charge of the decorations and booth building of the fair.
Among those who have recently been placed on the Honorary Advisory
Board are Governor James H. Budd, Messrs. John Rooney, Frank Schill
ing. O. M. r.rennan, P. J. Cormick. Alfred Tobin, James Costello, Captain T. P.
Crowley, J. C. Gorman, J. J. Barrett, Hon. T. B. McFarland, John P. Gallagher,
J. C. Murphy and Hon. A. B. McGuire.
It was decided to hold a meeting of the Honorary Advisory Board at tha Oo
cidental Hotel this coming "Wednesday evening, and a general meeting of all
ladies interested in the Irish Fair for one week from Wednesday night.

PATRIOTISM

OF IRELAND
Shown by Celebration
in County Wexford.
SCENES ON VINEGAR HILL
NOT SINCE 1798 HAS THERE
BEEN SUCH A SIGHT.
J. J. Clancy, The Call's Special Corre
spondent, Describes the Demon
stration and Gives Other
Interesting News.
BY J. J. CLANCY.
DUBLIN, June 4.â The '98 celebration
of last Sunday In the County of Wex
ford was an affair of no ordinary mag
nitude. This was to be expected. The
insurrection of a hundred years ago
was chiefly the work of the men of
Wexford, and the principal fight of the
campaign was that at Vinegar Kill, a
moderate-sized eminence outside the
town of Ennisworthy. Vinegar Hill was
the scene of the demonstration to which
I refer, and not since 1798 has there
been seen such a sight as that of the
thousands of people who crept up its
sides on Sunday from all quarters, ac
companied by hands and banners and
headed by politicians representing all
the nationalist political parties in Ire
land. The scene has not been described
in the English press, but that fact is
nothing unusual. The idea prevails in
England that, if only an Irish national
movement is not noticed as it pro
gresses, in the English press, the move
ment will simply die and leave no re
sults behind. Experience, it is true,
does not bear out this theory, but that
fact does not matter. Events of im
portance in Ireland are nevertheless
kept from the knowledge of the Eng
lish public, with the result that that
public is greatly surprised when dis
agreeable things happen which are in
natural sequence from what has been
suppressed. 1 do not say or hint that a
fresh insurrection is to flow from the
Vinegar Hill meeting: but that demon
stration does unmistakably show that
the Wexford people are as hostile to
British rule as their forefathers were
in 1798, and that only tne opportunity
is wanting to make that fact as clear
as daylight. I may add that the chief
figure at Vinegar Hill on Sunday was
John Redmond, M. P. He not only
made the best speech of the day but he
got the be.-t receptionâ which is some
what significant, seeing lhat the Coun
ty of Wexford, as a whole, has appear
ed at least to be anti-Parnellite since
1830.
The local government bill for Ireland,
about which I have already written so
often being now virtually law, people
are beginning to turn their attention as
to the use to be made of it. Mr. Red
mond, the leader of the Independent
party, has spoken on the subject dur
ing the past few days and what he said
has attracted very general attention.
He takes the view that the measure
of reform now about to be enacted maj
or may not be made a stepping stone
to a full measure of national self-gov
ernment aecoiding to the results of the
present experiment. If the mass of the
people to whom the business of manag
ing their own local affairs is now to be
entrusted boycott the Irish minority
because of their past political record
and exclude all representatives of that
party from all the new elective bodies
the inference in England and among
the Irish minority will be that the very
same boycotting would prevail under
home rule, and the determination to re
sist home rule will be strengthened in
both quarters. If, on the other hand,
the mass of the people have the wis
dom and generosity to wipe out old
scores and let bygones be bygones, it
is only natural to suppose that the just
minority will be compelled to see that
they would be as well off under home
rule as they are now. if not better off,
and that the best thing they could do
would be to cast in their lot with their
follow countrymen for the attainment
of home rule. Holding these view? Mr.
Redmond has publicly advised the peo
ple to elect members of the minority
wherever they can to the new boards,
and his words have been widely quoted.
They have also been widely approved,
though not by the journals which rep
resent the majority of the Irish mem
bers. Of course, it remains to be seen
whether, if the policy of Mr. Redmond
be carried out, the result would be such
as he expects. On this point time must
pronounce; but at present one thing is
certain, namely, that among the mi
nority in Ireland there is a widespread
feeling that they have been deserted by
their own friends and that they would
not lose anything by "cutting the
painter" with England. It would seem
to be but the sheerest common sense on
the part of Irish Nationalists to en
courage them to continue in this frame
of mind.
The death of Mr. Gladstone has been
followed by that of two or three men
who were, curiously enough, Ion?
mixed up with him In public and priv
ate life; but of those parsonages the
only one whose demise has any partic
ular interest for Irishmen ia that of
Lord Playfair. Dr. L,yon Playfalr, to
give him the name by which he was
best known, was chairman of commit
tees of the House of Commons in one
of the stormiest periods of the Parnell
campaign. In ordinary times, perhaps,
he would have been very well suited
for such a position, for he was a man
of capacity and learning, but the times
were not ordinary. Parnell and his
lieutenants wore "on the rampage,"
and almost the last man who ought,
from the English point of view, to have
been selected to preside over the House
of Commons "In committee" was a
grave-visaged, middle aged, professor
like gentleman with spectacles, whnsr>
traditions were thosp of the peaceful
times of the past, who sought to act
only In accordance with tradition, and
who was certain to do something fool
ish In presence of a revolution. On
one occasion he at last fully justified
the anticipation of the philosophic ob
server. The House of Commons
had been kept sitting continu
ously for some twenty-four hours
by Parnell and his colleagues
During this sitting many exciting
scenes occurred, which Dr. Lyon Play
fair, who was In the chair, was utterly
unable to check. Some couple of hours
after midnight he at last retired to
rest, hoping, perhaps, but scarcely ex
pecting that the battle would be over
by the morning. It was still going
on, however, at 9 a. m., when he re
turned to his post; whereupon he took
out of his pocket a list of names of
Irish members whom he invited the
House to "suspend" for obstruction
and disorderly behavior. The mem
bers named were duly suspended and
the long Bitting thereby brought to a
close; but, unfortunately for Dr. Play
fa.tr, several of them were actually at
home or in their lodgings when they
were alleged to be obstructing. The
mistake was not very much noticed at
the time, but showing, as it did, that
the chairman had lost his head, it
eventually damaged him irretrievably.
It remains to mention, however, that
Dr. Lyon Playfair afterward became
with Gladstone a home ruler, and, un
like others who were made peers by
Mr. Gladstone, remained one even after
he had been "elevated" to the House of
Lords.
The Corporation of Dublin appointed
a deputation to attend at Mr. Glad
stone's funeral. Its action in the mat
ter has been by no means universally
approved, a majority â if not most â of
the citizens of Dublin taking the view
that nothing ought to be done
to show any disrespect to the
great Englishman's memory, but
that, on the other hand, there was
no special call on Irishmen, in view of
the tragic events of 1890, to take part
In the funeral ceremonies or in any
glorification of his career. As usual on
such occasions, the question of "prece
dence" arose â the question, namely,
whether the Lord Mayor of Dublin and
staff should or should not have prece
dence of the Lord Pr vost of Edinburgh
at Westminster. In that party this
was the subject of a fierce controversy
which was carried on for years and
reached its height on the occasion of
the marriage of the Prince of Wales
in 1863. On that occasion trie Queen ac
corded precedence to Dublin. A storm
of indignation accordingly arose in
Scotland. Soon afterward the Prince
of Wales gave precedence to Edin
burgh, whereupon the loyal Irish â for
the Dublin Corporation was not then
a national body â rose in arms in their
turn. Nothing remained to be done but
to refer the whole question to the "her
alds" of the three countries. The re
sult was rather confusing, for, while
"the Ulster King of Arms" decided in
favor of Dublin, the corresponding
Pcothch authority naturally gave his
vote to Edinburgh, ar.d, in dome ro,
was backed up by the English function
ary. The question, apparently, could
not be left in this unsatisfac
tory state, and, accordingly, the
Queen herself intervened and solemnly
referred the matter to the Privy Coun
cil, who as solemnly heard the argu
ments on both sides rravely urged and
finally decided that Dubll-. and Edin
burgh were ex equo and that they
should have precedence alternately!
And so the long war was put an end
to at last. How the point was decided
nn Saturday or whether it then arose
does not clearly appear.
All we know is that no explosion of j
temper or public calamity has super- j
vened, and we are beginning to hope j
that both "loyal" Irishmen and loyal
Scotchmen do not think so much as
they used to of absurd trifles.
For the past week we have had the j
American actress, Mrs. Brown-Potter,
playing "Charlotte Corday" here in the
Theater Royal. She has been a fair
success. Her dresses have been specially j
admired and she has explained to a
newspaper interviewer that she her
self had a good deal to do with the de
signing of them. On other points, too, i

she was pretty communicative. She
does not like "problem" plays, it ap
pears, and she thinks that the public
do not like them either, for they are a
financial failure. "The theater," she
says "is for the young first of all, and
the young have their ideals and do not
like to see them destroyed before their
eyes by Ibsen, or Pinero, or any one
else." As to Ireland and the Irish, she
is quite in love with both, and it is a
case of love at first sight. "I like your
Irish nation," she says, "the very mo
ment I place my foot on Irish sdil. I
feel that it and the people are sympa
thetic. I understand them and like
them. They are quicker than the
English audiences, but I like the Eng
lish, too.'.' I do not mean to say or
hint that Mrs. Brown-Potter Is at all
insincere; but she certainly knows
"how to get along" all the same.
BENEFITS FROM THE
BANKRUPTCY BILL
Senator Hoar Tells of Thousands of
Persons Who May Be Aided by
the Measure.
WASHINGTON, June 25.â Senator
Hoar, chairman of the Senate Commit
tee on Judiciary, who has been urging
the enactment of a bankruptcy law for
the past fifteen years, has given out a
statement apropos of the Senate's ac
ceptance of the conference report.
Among other things he says:
The present bill Is a compromise. It will un
doubtedly be found that, in getting It through,
we hr.\e boen obliged to leave in it some crudi
ties and imperfections which must be remedied
by subsequent legislation. It is quite likely
that the lees of clerks, referees and trustees
will be found to be low. One of the great ob
jections was that under the old law the estates
were eaten up by costs, and that the creditors
got little or nothing. So we have pared to the
quick in that particular. Instead of the long
list of crimes there are only two for which
a bankrupt is to be punishedâ one. that of
willfully making a falsi- answer In the bank
ruptcy proceedings, the other the embezzle
ment of the property of the estate. The terms
of discharge, too, are exceedingly liberal, and
it Is provided that Carmen and wageearners
will not be the subjects of involuntary bank
ruptcy, which extends in general to merchants,
manufacturers, hankine. printers and publish
ers, etc. There are s.une possible cases of fraud
which the law will not prevent, but the ob
jection to a stricter one was so great that It
was not thought best to risk the success of this
bill by standing out for a perfect rule to be
applied to cases which would not occur once
in n thousand times.
The bill seems to me a great deal better than
that known as the Torrey bill in two parti
culars. One Is that the settlement cannot be
delayed by appeals to the Supreme Court of
the United States except in two cases, first,
where a Federal question is involved, and. seeÂ»
ond, where a decision of the Supreme Court Is
needed for uniformity of construction through
out the country. Secondly, there is a provis
ion for a summai-y application to a court of
appeal? In an Interlocutory way to correct mis
takes as the proceedings go on, instead of wait
ing until the final determination in the court
below is arrived at and then keeping the whole
â¢â¢state tied up until after a final decision In
the higher court.
The bill will enable from 150.000 to 200.000
bankrupts to pet on their feet again. It will
enable manufacturers and merchants to get a
fair division of their debtors' property and will
prevent a great deal of fraud, embezzlement
and wasteful dealing with property.

CHARTER FOR
LOS ANGELES
An Exciting Election in
Prospect.
TWO TICKETS NOMINATED
LIVELY CAMPAIGN NOW WELL
UNDER WAY.
League for Better City Government
Determined to Control the
Â£ ormation of tlie New
Laws.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, June 25.â This city
Is now preparing for a charter election
which is exciting considerable interest
among all classes of citizens. The char
ter under which the city at present is
operating was adopted in 1888, when
Los Angeles had about 45,000 inhabi
tants. The city now has 110,000 people
and the present charter is therefore al
together out of date.
There is no division of opinion upon
the point as to the necessity of a new
city charter, but there is some division
as to who are the proper people to
formulate the new instrument and pre
sent it to the people for their approval
or rejection.
In the early part of 1897 the Chamber
of Commerce and the League for Bet
ter City Government prepared a num
ber of amendments to the present char
ter. The City Council submitted them
to the people and they were rejected.
This adverse action on the charter
amednments was due to two reasons.
In the first place the amendments in
themselves were not altogether satis
factory and in the second place they
were drawn and largely prepared by
the League for Better City Govern
ment. The ostensible aims and objects
of this organization are highly com
mendable, but the people got the im
pression that the league was controlled
by a clique made up of a selected few
who were seeking their personal ag
grandizement under the cover of the
organization. The people thereupon
trunÂ«d out and defeated the charter
amendments.
So when the agitation for a new char
ter was revived it was conceded that
the only way to secure anything of that
character was to have the labor of
drawing up the document performed by
duly elected representatives of the peo
ple and not by a few all-wise people
in star chamber.
A charter convention was called,
made up of delegates from the Demo
cratic, Republican, Populist and Silver
Republican parties, from the League
for Better City Government, the Cham
ber of Commerce, the Board of Trade,
the Merchants' and Manufacturers'
Association, the Council of Labor and
one or two other organizations. The
object of this conference was to secure
united action without regard to political
lines on a freeholder ticket.
The first few meetings of the confer
ence were attended by delegates from
all the organizations. The League for
Better City Government put forth a
desperate effort to capture the con
vention and failed.
At the meeting at which freeholders
were finally chosen the league was not
represented. Despite the fact that its
members claimed no party spirit would
move them in the matter of selecting
freeholders, they did not propose to
participate in any meeting to name the
freeholders which the league could not
et, selecting the following gentlemen
Labor; E. H. T. Hazard, Silver Republi
can; L. J. Mathews, Board of Trade; J.
B. Millard, Teachers' Association; M.
J. Newmark, Chamber of Commerce;
A. M. Stephens, Democrat; William Le
Moyne "Wills, Merchants' Association.
The following freeholders were named
at large, representative of the entire
city, but of no particular body of men:
Milton Carlson. E. E. Crandall. William
M. Garland, John F. Humphreys, H. T.
Lee, R. H. Variel.
At the last moment the League for
Better City Government placed a ticket
in the field, as follows: Fred Lalles, J.
D. Bicknell, Kaspare Cohn. Albert H.
Crutcher, J. H. Davidson, S. C. Dodge,
A. N. Feldschar, M. L. Graff, L. A.
Groff, George W. Knox, D. M. McGar
ry, Robert McOarvin. Octavius Morgan,
H. W. O'Melveny. Thomas Pascol and
Charles Vouden Kuhelen.
Four of the candidates on the cit
izens' non-partisan ticket were in
dorsed on the regular non-partisan
ticket, as follows: R. H. F. Variel, H.
T. Lee, M. J. Newmark and A. M.
Stephens.
None of the political parties have
placed a charter ticket in the field and
it is now too late for them to do so.
The contest will be narrowed down be
tween the two tickets named.
Good and representative men are on
both tickets, but nevertheless there
will be a warm contest at the polls on
election day.
The manipulators of the League for
Better City Government are deter
mined to be the dominating influence in
the formation of the new city charter
and to many people this will not be ac
ceptable.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. LOUIS, June 25.â A special to
the Post-Dispatch from Whitehall, Ill
says :
Frank Ainsworth and Bill Jackson of
Roodhouse are the men who held up the
fast express on the Chicago, Burlington
and Quincv Railroad about a mile north
of the depot here last night and killed
Engineer Fred Dempsey. A Sheriff's
posse was immediately organized and
bloodhounds belonging to P. Branzell
of this place let loose. The dogs have
trailed and captured many criminals
in this part of the country. They soon
tracked Jac) son to Roodhouse, where
he was arrested. Jackson told the
whole story ht the hold-up, and Ains
worth was aJrested a few hours later.
The train pulled out of the station
about seven minutes late, and when it
slowed up at the Chicago ard Alton
crossing it was boarded by A'nsworth
with a gun in his hand. He used the
usual tactics, crawling over the tender
and calling the engineer to throw up
his hands. Dempsey evidently did not
understand, but reversed his engine and
threw on the airbrakes. Ainsworth be
gan firing and Dempsey was shot in
the body, falling to the floor of his cab.
The fireman escaped through the front
window.
A general alarm was spread on the
train and the desperadoes fled. They
wore white masks, and as the one who
killed Dempsey left the train he fired
his gun in the air and yelled, "Come
on, Bill."
The night express is supposed to
carry a local and through safe, and the
plan evidently was to cut off the ex
press car and run ahead with it.
The Coroner's inquest was held In the
City Hall here to-day over the body of
the dead engineer. A great crowd was
in attendance and excitement ran high.
Prominent officials of the Burlington
road are in attendance upon the pro
ceedings, and no effort will be spared
by the people to bring the desperadoes
to Justice.
Close of the Directory School.
Among the most Interesting and suc
cessful commencement exercises held
within the past two weeks were thosa
arranged and rendered by the Girls' Di
rectory School on Buena Vista avenue,
under the immediate auspices of the Sis

ATTORNEY MAHONEY
FAILS TO APPEAR
LOW VACATES THE ORDER FOB
A NEW TRIAL.
He Does Not Issue a Bench Warrant
for Mahoney's Arrest but Con
tinues the Case.
Judge Low has descended from the h!gh
horse he was riding and has virtually
acknowledged that his course in the case
of attorney W. H. Mahoney, as pointed
out In The Call last Thursday, was wrong
and untenable.
Yesterday, when the case was again
called, the Judge Instructed the clerk to
the court to vacate the order granting a
new trial and ordered the defendant to
appear for sentence. The bailiff called
the names of the defendant and his at
torney, ex-Judge Ferral, in the corridor,
but each failed to show up. Policeman
"W. J. Smith, who arrested Mahoney, was
In court, and the Judge asked him what
he intended to do.
"I have nothing further to do with the
case," replied Smith. "I am not the
Judge. It is for you to do whit Is right."
The Judge adjourned court for some
minutes and went in search of Mahoney
and ex-Judge Ferral. He could find
neither, and after the business of the
court was concluded he continued Ma
honey's case till to-morrow. The Judge
did not issue a bench warrant for Ma
honey's arrest, as was the proper course,
seeing he did not consider It worth his
notire to appear in court for sentence.
Considerable curiosity is now evinced as
to what sentence the Judge will impose
upon his friend Mahoney. It is a coinci
dence that one of the jurors who convict
ed Mahoney was also arrested for ob
structing a street crossing and was con
victed and fined.FUSION LIKELY

INTO LINE.
Sppclal Dispat.h to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. June 25.â The Popu
lists have held their primaries in this
county and elected delegates to a conven
tion to meet on Tuesday. This gathering
will name delegates to the Populist
State Convention, which is to convene
in Sacramento July 12.
It has all along been supposed by the
Democrats and Silver Republicans that
the Populists of Los Angeles County
were practically a unit for fusion, l'h :
serms to have been a delusion. The per
sonnel of the delegation to the county
convention forces the conclusion that the
"middle-of-the-roaders" will control, and
if they do. the death knell of fusion m
this State will be sounded.
The influence and prestige of the Los
Angeles County delegation in the Popu
list Slate Convention,, will be consider
able, inasmuch as the delegates :\om
this county will, in all probability, carry
with them the delegations from the
Southern California counties. The Demo

the passage of a strong fusion resolu

next Tuesday.
One thing is almost certainâ the Popu
list County Convention will indorse Con
gressman C. A. Barlow, and will demand
his renomination. This the Democrats, as
yet, are not Willing to concede. They had
counted on giving the Congressional nom
ination this year to George S. Patton,
and until within the past twenty-four
hours it ha.- been understood Mr. Patton
earnestly desired the nomination. But
to-day Mr. Pattern positively declined to
permit his name to be considered in that
connection. The reason for this is obvi
ous. Mr. Patton. as a sensible man. real
izes that the Republican candidate for
Congress in this district is assured of a
victory by a majority that will run from
2000 to 4000 votes.
This leaves the Democrats with no can
didate for their nomination. At one time
Mayor 11. P. Snyder thought that he
would like to go to Congress, and he was

Populist State Committee and private
secretary to Congressman Barlow, re

some time ago that Mr. Barlow would
run for Congress again, whether he got
the Democratic nomination. or not. This
angered many Democrats and the dicta

friends of Barlow created considerable
talk.

TRIED TO SLAY
"JACK" DALTON
Indian Jim Wanted by
Alaska Officers.
THE PATHFINDER AMBUSHED
BARELY ESCAPES DEATH AT
THE REDSKINS' HANDS.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
JUNEAU, June Zv (by steamship
Rosalie to Seattle, June 25).â An at
it-miit was made four days ago a few
miles above Chilkat on the Chilkat
River, to assassinate the noted path
finder and trail cutter of Alaska,
"Jack" Dalton. He reported it here
yesterday to United States Commis
sioner Malcom and a warrant was is
sued for the arrest of Inuiu.ii Jim, a
Stick, whom Dalton accuses of the at
tempt at assassination. The charge is
assault with intent to commit murder.
To-day a deputy, marshal left for
Haines to take Indian Jim into custody.
It is not unlikely that the other Sticks
may offer a show of resistance of
Indian Jim's would-be captor, as his
murderous act is said to have had their
sympathy.
Two rilie bullets were shot at Dalton
by Indian Jim, who fired from ambush.
At the time of the shooting he was
ahead of a party of prospectors follow
ing the trail by the river. When the
first shot was tired from a clump cf
brush Dalton, although unarm*-],
beckoned to his companions to follow
him and then started for the brush. As
he neared it a second shot was tired by
the unseen foe. The bullet this time
cut through Lalton's coat on the left
side, doing no further injury than to
bore a hole through the veteran guide's
pocketbook.
Dalton's comrades, white men, were
close to him by this time with revolvers
in their hands. In a moment an Indian
whom Dalton says was Indian Jim
broke out of the clump of bushes, ritle
in hand, and ran to the denser timber
toward the hills. As a number of other
Indians were noticed among the trees
toward which he ran no effort was
made by the whites to pursue him.
As threats against Dalton previously
had been ii.ade by the Indians in the
vicinity of Chilkat he decided to appeal
to the authorities and so he started
back to tide water, taking the next boat
for Juneau.
The Indians are incensed against Dal
ton because they believe him to be in
strumental in bringing so many white
men into their territory. A committee
of Sticks recently called on the United
States Commissioner here to complain
that the presence of steamboats on
Chilkat River was driving away the
salmon and if the boats were not taken
off they said the Indians would starve
next summer. It is the opinion of many
old timers that the attack on "Jack"
Dalton is only the beginning of serious
trouble between the Stick Indians and
the white men along the Chilkat.
News comes from Skaguay that on
Thursday last a severe wind storm
wrecked between twenty and forty
boats on Lajce Bennett. No lives were
lost, but many outfits were ruined or
sunk. HAL HOFFMAN.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNJE 26, 1808.
DISCUSSED THE
WATER TANGLE
Los Angeles Council Has
Another Conference.
TWO HOURS OF FUTILE TALK
BUT THE SCHEMERS STILL HOLD
THE WINNING HAND.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. June 24.â The com
mittee of the City Council met Thurs
day to consult with the trustees of the
'â  stockholders of the City Water Com
i pany and their attorneys. The object
of the conference was to ascertain
whether or not terms could be ar
ranged for a basis upon which arbitra
tion could be obtained. Every member
of the Council who participated in the
meeting and every person representing
; the water company knew full well that
!an arrangement whereby arbitration
j could proceed was an impossibility.
I Yet the meeting was held and it con
â  tinued for two hours just the same as
iif good faith was intended by both
| parties. The meeting was an executive
i one. Everybody was excluded, even
: some members of the Council. Mayor
! Snyder was admitted and so was Presl
! dent Silver of the City Council.
After two hours, which were devoted
to talk, the meeting broke up and
nothing was accomplished. . City At
torney Dunn had a plan of arbitration
drawn up, but the water company's
representatives declined to agree to it
until time had been given for their at
torneys to examine it.
Local dailies continue to hold out to
their readers the idea that there is
every probability that the water com
pany and the city will arbitrate, and
the City Council is practicing the same
deceit. The water company's contract
with the city expires in about thirty
days and the city is no nearer the
possession of its plant than it was "the
day after the contract was made in
1868.
Seven members of the City Council
were placed in a rather embarrassing
position yesterday by a motion made by
Councilman Hutchinson that the Coun
cil proceed to name its arbitrator to
fix the price of the water company's
plant. When the Council convened the
water supply committee reported that
a conference held with the water com
pany trustees had demonstrated the
fact that the city and the company
could not agree upon either a plan of
arl.it ration or the properties to be con
sidered by the arbitrators before next
Thursday' and they therefore asked for
further time.
Councilman Hutchinson objected to
the granting of an extension of time.
He asserted that the three arbitrators
could decide upon the properties the
city required of the company and that
it was in fact their duty to select the
properties and fix their value. He,
therefore, moved that the City Council
proceed to at once name an arbitrator
for the city.
This motion created surprise, for it
was unexpected. Councilman Toll,
however, threw himself into the breach
and moved to amend the motion by
adding that Councilman Hutchinson
name the arbitrator for the city. This
responsibility Mr. Hutchinson was
loath to take. The amendment of Toll
was put to a vote and carried. The
original motion, with Toll's amend
ment, was then defeated by Hutchin
son's vote.
Hutchinson then endeavored to place
his original motion that the Council
proceed to name the city's arbitrator
at once before the Council, but Presi
dent Silver ruled it out of order. It
is now given out that, if the city does
name an arbitrator, the man will be ex-
City Engineer Fred Eaton. Mr. Hutch
inson and Mr. Orider will present the
name of Ernest Abs Hagen.

THERE ARE TWO
WAYS OF LIVINGâ
One way is for the renter, who pays out his
â ttoney, month after month, never accumulat-
ing anything; the other way is for the sensi-
ble Investor, who makes the paying out of
money serve some good end â such as securing a
home for himself and family.
All over the city are rent payersâ from gen-
.to generation they never have a horne â I
from year to year It Is the same struggle to
meet the landlords' demands. Out In the Hey-
man Tra<u there are over 100 families who, in !
a few short years, have placed themselves be- :
yond the landlord's power by taking advantage
of the Heyman plan of providing homes on
monthly payments. Streets are graded, sewers
laid. Electric oars bring you down town In 20 j
minutes Take Mission-st. cars, transfer to
Twenty-second st., to Hoffman aye. and ask
for MX. JAMES A. COTTER, resident agent,
who will show you around. JACOB HEYMAN,

THIS RIFLE
SPITS DEATH
A Lethal Machine Gun
Just Brought Out.
HOWARD CARR THE INVENTOR
SIX HUNDRED CARTRIDGES A
MINUTE CAN BE FIRED.
The Gunner Pulls the Trigger, the
Automatic Action Does the
Restâ lts Range Is Two
Miles.
A public exhibition was made yester
day for the first time of the operation
of the Carr automatic machine gun by
the inventor, Howard Carr. on the bay
shore at Shell Mound. Of all the inven
tions for the destruction of human life
this stands at the head. Imagrine a man
FIRES 600 BULLETS A MINUTE.
The Wonderful Machine Gun Invented by Howard Carr.
pitting on a saddle on one leg of a tri
pod, with his finger pressing a trigger
of a rifle that pours out a stream of
death-dealing bullets at the rate of 600
in one minute or eleven shots every sec
ond. This is what can be done with the
new gun and with an accuracy that
would make an ordinary sharpshooter
feel envious.
Howard Carr, who is an old resident
of this city, has been at work on this
new creation for some time and now he
feels that he has combined In one ma
chine a gun that will hold its own with
the best in the world. It is only a ques
tion of adjusting the strength of :he
parts to apply the action to large cali
bers.
Simplicity, rapidity and accuracy are
the principal features of the weapon,
to say nothing of its lightness, for when
fully rigged it weighs just 20V2 pounds,
or about the weight of a soldier's mus
ket, bayonet and belt full of cartridges,
etc. The principle on which it operates,
as its name "automatic" Implies, is that
it requires no effort of the marksman
to manipulate. It shoots the same am
munition as that now In use by the
United States Government, the 30-40
Krag-Jorpensen cartridge, with the
steel-jacket bullet. The magazine is
entirely detached from the gun, and
when emptied can be replace I and fir
ing resumed in ten seconds. It looks
like the drum of a banjo minus the arm.
Into this receptacle, which is made of
tin, 310 cartridges are placed, and the
weight of a filled magazine is about 25
pounds. The gun itself is an ordinary
Krag-Jorgensen barrel, automatic
breech action and pistol grip. It can be
mounted in any manner, on the side of
a patrol wagon, bicycle, tripod or on
board of a boat as may be required.
The exhibition began first with the
single shot action. The gun was set
up in the sand on the beach and trained
out on the bay for safety. Every shot
threw into the air a spray of water like
the spouting of a whale, while the guid
ing hand on the lever moved up and
down, right and left, causfhg the bul
lets to strike the water over any quarter
of the compass and from 50 to 1000
yards away. The steady spiteful bark
of the rifle was followed by a perpen
dicular spray of water out on the bay.
The single shot test for accuracy was
surprising, easily hitting any object
aimed at. It was next shown how far
the piece would carry. A slieht eleva
tion was given to the gun and the trig
ger pulled. The eye could not see where
the bullet struck, but with the aid of a
pair of field glasses a bouquet-like
spray was discerned away up the bay
in the direction of Red Rock. The bul
let must have struck nearly two miles
from the shooting point. The interval
between the report of the gun and the
striking of the bullet was very short,
but what could be expected when the
velocity of the bullet's travel is at the
rate of 2000 feet per second.
The most interesting feature of the
exhibition was the operation of the au
tomatic action. A close observer would
have noticed that the operator gave the

An Unknown Suicide.
The body of an unknown man was
found in Golden Gate Park yesterday aft
ernoon by Officer Reynolds of the park
police. The man had been dead for about
three weeks and was lying in the sand
hills some distance west of Strawberry
Hill, in a rather inaccessible pÂ»ace. which
caused Deputies Tyrell and Smith of the
Coroner's office considerable trouble to
secure the body. Near the man were
some bills torn in such a manner that it
was evident the intention had been to
make impossible the identification of the
body. When the torn bits of paper were
placed together it was found that they
had been made out for a Mrs. Rosenberg.
The man was middle-aged, heavy set and
had brown, curly hair and full beard. He
was dressed in a black diagonal suit, a
well worn pair of lace shoos, a soft, light
shirt and black derby hat. The cause of
death is unknown.
Death of Thomas F. Sinnott.
Thomas F. Sinnott, until recently
Storekeeper of Internal Revenue at An
tioch, died yesterday at his residence in
this city. He was taken with Brlght's
disease at Antioch and removed to this
city, where he could obtain medical at
tendance. The deceased was well known
in Democratic circles in Stockton and
Fresno, in which towns he resided for
several years. He leaves a widow and
children.

To-day.
When the rundown of the open meeting
I held yesterday at Union Coursing Park
1 was about half over a blanket of fog,
; which moved in from the ocean, settled
i over the southeast part of the big cours
ing field and cut off from the spectators
: a view of the finishes. But the coursing
I up to the time of semi-darkness was ex
| cellent, as the hares ran strong and car
; rled their pursuers from end to end of the
; big demesne. Manager Jerome muat have
! hit the nail on the head when he dlscov
j ered a new scheme by which the game
I can be admitted into the running sward
, without suffering from nervous excite
j ment. The little "fliers" are driven Into
boxes large enough to accommodate one
I at a time, and there they remain quietly
! housed up until liberated.
In the puppy stakes quite a few Bur
j prises were experienced before the run
i down was finished. Meta easily defeated
Minerva and Admiral Dewey sent Bull
Hill to his kennel shamed by a good beat
| ing. Liberty Bell will doubtless win the
I stake, although Jim Edmonds contends
I that he has a cinch on the long green in
I Morning Glory, but P. Cooper says that
lif Edmonds had entered Whisky' Hill he
I could not miss pocketing first priae.
In the open stake Clifton Lass was only
beaten by Magnet after a no-course.
â  Koolawn should easily defeat Magnet to
! day, but a grueling course with Gallagher
yesterday may stiffen Koolawn to such
} an extent as to obliterate her chances
lof winning. Thornhill and Mystery had
another pumping course, and the winner
! had very little to spare when the red flag
was hoisted In his favor. Rusty Gold did
not run up to form yesterday, and al
though he won easily from Bendigo he
wns thoroughly exhausted at the end of
â  a long course. Gilt Edge, to the surprise
; and evident disgust of the talent, lowered
i the colors of Lady Blanche. The betting
I was 6 to 1, with the Lady on the long end.
i Myrtle ran very well, and may be among
i the winners. Theron beat Laurelwood in
a long course. Right Bower, a shortender,
defeated Lady Campbell in a close con
test, and Glenstone romped away from
Prince of Fashion. One of the big sur
prises of the day was when Jesse Maid
defeated Chili Pepper, a 6 to 1 shot. Syl
via and Rey Alfonso had "byes," as their
respective opponents failed to appear on
time. The following is the order of the
coursing:
Puppy stakeâ Mac's Melody beat Magnecia:
Meta beat Minerva. Billy Gladstone beat One
Spot, Miss Skyrocket beat Blacklock, Admiral
Dewey beat Bull Hill. Morning Glory beat
Statesman, Beauty Spot beat Obadiah, Wait

AT INGLESIDE.
The Talent Suffer Many Sur
prises, and Shortenders Land
Heavily During the Day.
Despite the foggy and cheerless atmos
phere at Ingloside yesterday the select
crowd of bettors managed to derive a
great deal of comfort out of the numer
ous close courses between the speedy en
tries. Those who cast their shekels with
the short-enders reaped a harvest, as no
less than five scored at odds ranging
from G to 3 to 1.
In quick order the large card was run
oft, keeping those engaged In the uncer
tain game of betting busy placing their
money. The lone betting-stand that was
In full blast proved Insufficient to acom
modate the immense business it enjoyed
during the afternoon. As many were un
able to get near it. it might not be a bad
plan for the management to increase the
number.
Surprises were many, and the talent
suffered. Lass o' Gowrie sent the 2 to
1 favorite Flashlight to his kennels, and
Mohawk repeated the performance by
beating Glen Chloe at 6 to 1. The Belle
of Moscow romped away from Oleen,
Santa Clara's pride, badly upsetting the
talent.
Following is the way the dogs ran:
Sapling stakeâ Prince George beat Wolfe

NEWS OF THE MINES,
Indications That War
and Drought Are Not
Like Wine to Mining.
Uncle Sam Is Down on Sul
phur Fumes at Keswick.
Oregon and Its Gold
and Silver.
The war is having a rather quieting ef
fect on the mining Industry in general,
though no very good reasons why this
should be so are discernible. This effect
is partly real and partly apparent only.
Men and newspapers are not talking
about mines as much as they did, because
the war has an overshadowing popular
interest. Established mining operations
proceed as usual, and others planned or
begun develop steadily, but without at
tracting so much notice.
There is noticeable, however, a slight
and temporary depressing effect that is
real. It is most noticeable in the field of
investment. Men who would ordinarily
put some money in a fairly promising
mining enterprise that came along will
now often say, "Well, wait until the war
is over." Promoters often do not find it
so easy to enlist capital and lioat mining
shares among people who are not prim
arily interested in mining as a business.
There is no good reason why this should
be so. Promising opportunities are no
fewer, and practical mining conditions are
not affected by the war. It is Just the
way people are built and the way the
thing works. This effect was early noticed
to some extent in mining stock specula
tion before the stamp tax was fairly
threatened. In California the exception
ally dry year combines with this vague
war influence to say "not yet" to mining
booms. As before stated, this influence is
almost wholly exerted on new enterprises.
Mining in California, nevertheless. Is in as
healthy a condition as ever in its history.
Except where water supplies are. short,
operations are booming along as usual,
and a great number of important new de
velopments are under way. The chief
stimulating effect of the war will be felt
in copper, lead and iron production. The
present year will show a great advance
in the industry, but perhaps not, on the
whole, as great a one as would have oc
curred but for the war.
The war tax has apparently dealt an
almost fatal blow to stock board specu
lation in low-priced mining stocks and
those Interested are trying to figure out
where they are "at." The tax is 5 cents
for each transfer of a lot of stock of the
face value of $100. Comstock shares here
and the shares which provide the bulk of
the business in mining stock exchanges
in Los Angeles, Denver and elsewhere
are generally of the face value of $100 and
sell for a few cents, often less than 5
cents. If the stock is worth only 5 cents
the tax is 100 per cent for each transfer
and is, of course, prohibitive. But what
ever woes may come to the stock gam
blers the legitimate interests of the min
ing industry will not be affected.
The immense new pipe line and asphalt
refinery built in Santa Barbara County
by the Alcatraz Asphalt Company, at a
cost of $500,000, was put into operation for
the first time a few days ago. One feat
ure of the plant is a double pipe line
thirty miles long from the mines in the
Sesquoc district to the coast. The asphal
tum is transferred through this pipe line
after being- liquefied with naphtha. The
great extent of this company's operations
and the promise of a great future for the
asphalt industry in California are little
understood by the people of the State.
The company's production will now be
greatly increased. Large developments
in other asphalt fields are being planned.
The Alcatraz Company is now laying two
miles of pavement in London, has paved
miles of streets in Edinburgh and Glas
gow and has a very large market in New
York.
The great Mountain Copper Company,
which is operating on so large a scale at
its mines on Iron Mountain and its
smelters at Keswick, Shasta County, has
got Into trouble with Uncle Sam, and
Redding is worried with a fear that j
operations may be checked. The trouble J
Is all due to the sulphur fumes from the
smelters. These fumes spread over the
country and kill nearly all vegetation
for miles around. There is hardly a po
tato patch in the region affected and the j
vegetation injured is mainly the small |
pines on the mountain sides. Some time !
ago, on complaint from somewhere, a
special agent of the Government went
there and made an investigation. Since
then results have been awaited with in
terest. The result has now come in the
shape of an injunction suit brought by
the Government to restrain the com
pany from operating its smelters without
putting in condensers to take care of its
deadly sulphur fumes. The people gen
erally UP there tolerate the fumes and
the square miles of dead scrub pine very
cheerfully because of the prosperity
which attends the expenditure of so
much money and the support of so large
a population. Perhaps 50 per cent of
Redding's business depends on these cop
per operations. It is not likely that oper
ations will be checked, even if an injunc
tion were inforced. The company would
simply be at a considerable extra ex
pense to keep its sulphur to itself.
The mining situation in Oregon is de
scribed in the report of Eugene B.
Braden, in charge of the assay office at
Helena, Mont., to the Director of the
Mint, and now given out in advance. In
the course of his report Mr. Braden says:
"The value of the gold and silver pro
duced in the State of Oregon during the
calendar year 1897 was $1,354,593 43 and
$109,642 68 respectively. Corresponding
values for the year 1896 were $1,290,963 63
and $71,811 37. The increase in gold dur
ing 1897 was $63,629 75, and in silver $37,
83121, a. total of $101,460 96. The percent
ages of increase over 1596 were: Gold, 5
per cent.;- silver, 2Vi per cent; total pro
duction, 7^2 per cent.
"The mining of precious metals was
confined to two districts. These are com
prised in Northeastern Oregon and
Southwestern Oregon. Of these two dis
tricts the northeastern is the more im
portant, because of a larger output from
both quartz and placer mining. In the
southwestern almost the entire output is
from placer ground. Only recently have
efforts been put forth to develop and
work the quartz lodes.
"Prospecting is being earnestely prose
cuted in both the mining regions. In the
northeastern Dart of the State the ex
ploitation of many meritorious claims was
vigorously prosecuted last year and a
number of new properties are included in
the list of producers. It is only recently
that any attention has been given to
prospecting for quartz lodes in South
western Oregon. The output from this
source last year was very small. Con
siderable new machinery is being in
stalled and the future output from veini
must necessarly increase."

to nothing.
The Rand of Randsburg says a load of
very rich ore has been received from ihe
old Page mine at Pan.imint, which was
purchased by the sampling works to ship
to the smelter.
Since Messrs. Strauss & Shinn pur
chased the Iron Chief, the Iron Mounta'n
district ha? come into prominence, says
the San Diego Sun. These parties are
employing sixty men in three shifts in
development and construction work. The
main shaft is down 266 feet Water will
be piped twelve miles. The mill and cy
anide plant will have a capacity of sixty
torÂ« per day. It is the intention to havt*
the first clean-up about June 20.
At the Gwin mine, near Mokelunsno
Hill, the old shaft Is cleaned out to 1320
feet. So far the work in the old shaft
has been very satisfactory. The new
shaft is producing and the mill is running
regularly.
The California Exploration Comnany
has purchased the Thorpe mine near San
Andreas.
The new reduction works at Baratow
have started up and 200 tons of ore run
through the mills. It is expected that it
i will take about a week to get everything
I in proper shape, when the works will be
able to take care of all ore consigned to
them. Five cars of ore were shipped In
from Randsburg. It is believed there will
be no difficulty furnishing ore to keep

of foreign mines during May amounted to

President James \V. Collins was in the
chair. He advised Democrats to join their
district clubs regardless of all others
when the proper time came. After a
eulogy on Mayor Phelan's career since
his election to the mayoralty he was
complimented upon his determination to
succeed himself rather than stand for tha
position of chief executive of the State.
The merits of John L. Koster for the.
office of. Auditor were discussed and it was
the majority's opinion that he should re-Â«
ceive the support of the club.
L. V. Merle, who is known as the Sixth
street improvement promoter, was elected
permanent secretary.
Music and recitations were indulged In
while various kinds of refreshments were
served. Altogether much enthusiasm waa
shown.

SPEAKS OF IT
AS A MIRACLE
Mrs. Montgomery Tells
of Her Healing.
DIAGNOSES BY DOCTORS
WAS SICK UNTO DEATH AND
YET HAD FAITH.
When The Call Announced Her Sick
ness She Says Thousands Com
menced to Pray for Her
Recovery.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 25.
Mrs. , Carrie Judd Montgomery has
prepared the following statement for The
Call, setting forth the truth about her
recent miraculous healing;
As so many accounts of my recent miracu
lous healing have appeared in print I reel con
eiiain.M to present tne exact facts in the case,
\wiich can be verified, if necessary, by a num
ber of reliable witnesses. There has been con
troversy m the daily papers as to the nature
01 my disease. 1 am not sufficiently versed in
nieuicai science to know exactly what to call
the disease, but X know that 1 was sick unto
death.
1 was first taken sick November 30, 1597, with
fevere, chill and prostration, followed by great
inflammation, which lasted for weeks. A medi
cal friend called it a severe attack of la grippe,
in three weeks I was much better, but persist
ent pain and weakness in my back compelled
me to lie down much of the time. My medical
mend happened in again and said my spine
was aftected. and that the grippe had struck
to the sympathetic nerve centers. When a.
little stronger I made efforts- to walk, but with
disastrous results. The spine began to throb
and beat violently In its whole length and
then to jerk frightfully with each throb like
a pump obstructed from some cause. After
making an effort to walk the entire spine
would fairly seem to leap like galloping horses.
while in this terrible condition a lady phjr-
Pician from San Francisco (a personal friend)
caw me an.i had no human hope of my recov
ery. It was her opinion that 1 had inflamma
tion of the spinal cord. Another physician
i cm â¢ "hicago thought I had tuberculosis of
the spine. Two other physicians pronounced
my disease spinal meningitis. I took no medi
cine, but these physicians were all friends who
took an interest in my case.
My appetite and digestion were suddenly re
stored on the day when Christian Alliance
mends in Oakland were praying and fasting
for me, so that after that I could digest food
of a simple kind. Just before my healing my
brain was in a most terrible state, some of the
time so wild that 1 could not understand what
was being said to me, and again as hot as
though filled with coals of fire.
During this illness 1 had the conviction that
I should be raised up again in answer to
prayer, ana my husband had unwavering faith
that I should be well again and resume â  my
work for the Lord. A great deal of prayer
was offered In my behalf, especially by Chris
tian Alliance friends, who eet two different
days to pray for me, and also by the Salva
tion Army, who had a day of special prayer
In my behalf throughout the Pacific Coast Di
vision. Many other friends were also praying
lor me.
Undoubtedly the Christian brother, Mr. Fran- j
cis, was sent to me by the Lord, and he had I
strong faith for my recovery. I noticed a j
marked improvement the next morning after
he offered prayer for me. But while the Lord j
answered his prayer he was also answering the
earnest cries of many hundreds who were pray
ing in great faith for my recovery, both on
this coast and In the East. The Call accounts
of my dying condition stirred up even a more
fervent wave of prayer, and letters poured in
from God's children who were holding on for
me in unwavering faith. In view of all these
prayers offered by the members of the body
of Christ it seemed fitting that when the heal
ing really came God should. so order it that
I was communing alone with him In the si
lance of the nifht. and that I should hear his
mighty voice in the depths of my sou! assuring
me the work was done. This was between 2
and 4 o'clock Sunday morning, June 12. and
came to me In one- sense unexpectedly. As a
great calm swept over my tortured brain there
was the removal, as it were, : of Iron bands
from my si>ine. There was no excitement.
â¢Many times I had seemed on the verge of in
sanity. My brain became natural and cool at
once, and I have been enabled to resume my
literary labors with perfect ease.
This seems the more remarkable when I re
member that auring these past six months I
have only been able to make two efforts in this
direction, and most of the time I could not
read or. listen to reading. On the morning of
my recovery I quietly told my friend who had
the care of me that I was healed, and a little j
later I dressed alone and went into my hus- I
band's room, where we praised God together, j
and then I went downstairs and through the |
house, where I met my startled and delighted
household.
On the following Wednesday I rode six miles
to Oakland and attended the Christian Alli
ance Convention, where I stood and phvc my

WILL BE NO
MILK TRUST
Majority of Dairymen
Oppose the Plan.
OPPOSITION OF PORTUGUESE
DIRECTOR i AY SAYS FIVE
DEALERS WILL EXPERIMENT.
If Successful Others May Be Induced
to Enter the Combination
{ to Control the
Trade. .
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 25.
The efforts to form a milk trust in this
city have failed, and although five of the
most prominent dairymen have decided
to carry out the terms upon which they
Incorporated, it was acknowledged to-day
by Director Fay that the scheme as
originally planned cannot be carried out.
One of the most Important factors in
preventing the formation of a solid milk
trust was the incorporation of all the
Portuguese dairymen a few weeks ago
for a somewhat similar purpose. The
Portuguese owned over a hundred dairies
in this county, and without them in the
combine it could not be a success, because
even the trust dealers admit that the
Portuguese supply Â«. good quality of milk.
In order to bring about conditions that
would favor a trust an effort was made
some time ago to take advantage of the
high price of hay by asking the feed men
not to give any credit to milkmen who
sold below a certain price per can. This,
however, was not successful, for one of
the largest of the cut-rate dairies was
able to pay spot cash for all the feed it
required, and this broke up the attempt
to control the feed men.
"While I had no doubt that it would be
better for all concerned to have the milk
trade arranged systematically," said Di
rector Fay to-day, "it is quite impossible
to get all the dealers to agree. Five of us
are going to start the corporation, and we
shall try to prove that b"y working to
gether -and saving the covering of the
same territory by many different wagons
it is advantageous to combine. At
present many who once favored the plan
have withdrawn, and although I believe
they will eventually see that there is
protection in combination, they are p now
inclined to go along on the old line.
The combination should have been ready
to commence operations before now, but
was unable to get all the tenants in i
the property at Eleventh and Clay streets, !
where they intend to open a central dis- :
tributtng agency. For a long time it was
balked by a dealer named ualker, who
wanted $350 to move into the next store
temporarily. As the trust would not pay
this it was led into inspecting his lease,
when it was found that it contained a
clause stating that if improvements were
decided on he would have to move. Tak
ing advantage of this, he was ordered to
get out and the partial combine expects
to enter upon its experiment in a couple
of weeks.
GREAT REGARD FOR

Publish a Notice That No One Must

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 25.
Thomas Rafferty of Pleasanton is a
much advertised man, though the nature
of the publicity given him would not be
ordinarily considered agreeable.
For a long time Mr. Rafferty has given
the Pleasanton officials much trouble. He
has been arrested on many occasions for
the same old habitâ drunkenness. Jus
tice Brophy. Marshal Head and Constable
Lyster have personally made many ef
forts to reform their townsman, but with
out effect, and now they have taken a dif
ferent tack.
Last Monday Rafferty was up before
Justice Brophy on the same old charge.
Owing to some defect in the proceedings
Rafferty was discharged. But the officers
do not intend to let Mr. Rafferty fill a
drunkard's grave if they can help it.
They have taken sufficient interest in
Mr. Rafferty to issue the following warn
ing to all* saloon-keepers in Murray
Township:
"To whom It may concernâ Notice is
hereby given that every person who sells
or furnishes or causes to be sold or fur
nished to Thomas Rafferty. an habitual
or common drunkard, any intoxicating
liquor will be prosecuted under section
397 of the Penal Code.
"E. E. HEAD, Marshal.
"L. M. LYSTER,
"Constable of Murray Township.
"Pleasanton, June 20, 1898."
Should this method of proclaiming
drunkards be followed in this county the"
Oakland papers would be publishing
many such notices and they would prob
ably'have a far greater effect than "$3 or

SERGEANTS TO
BE RETAINED
Mayor Thomas Sees No
Reason for Removal.
* i
THE CHIEF IS SATISFIED
NO EXTRA PAY GOES WITH THiii
HONOR.
Not Much Needed, but Will Not Be
Dropped Unless Some Good
Reason â  Can Be
Shown.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 25.
In spite of all that is being said re
garding the dropping of two sergeants
from the police force there is no inten
tion on the part of the Board of Police
Commissioners to take any such action.
Some time before Chief Lloyd went out
of office, at his request two patrolmen,
Peterson and Green, were promoted to
be sergeants. There is no extra salary
in the office, but there is a little dignity to
it, and -the incumbent is at liberty to
wear two or three extra bands of gold
lace and a, more ornamental badge on his
cap.
The appointment of sergeants has never
been popular with the men on the force.
They regard the intermediate officers
more as spies than anything else, and
on several occasions friction has resulted.
With the system now perfect in this city
by which officers report to the central
station every hour, it is considered un
necessary to have sergeants running
around town seeing that the men are on
their beats.
Mayor Thomas said yesterday that all
the talk about removing the sergeants is
nonsense and has no foundation in fact.
â¢'I for one have no intention of advocat
ing any changes in the department," he
said. "Everything is running smoothly
and I see no reason for disturbing
things."
Chief of Police Fletcher was asked this
morning about the matter and said that
he did not favor any change at present.
"The two men, Peterson and Green, are
doing all right," said the Chief, "and al
though I do not see any particular use
for three sergeants in our force, still the
men have been appointed and unless
A DEPARTURE IN CHURCH ARCHITECTURE.
The Handsome New Home of the Unitarian Congregation of
Berkeley, Now Under Construction.
BERKELEY, June 25.â 8y the Ist of September the Unitarians of Berkeley will have a church of their own.
Their temporary, use of Stiles Hall has always been a matter of protest on the part of the orthodox ministers In
town, and more than once they were on the point of being forced to go elsewhere. That whole difficulty will be set
tled when the building now being erected at the corner of Bancroft Way and Dana street is completed.
In style the structure will be a bold departure from the conventional church architecture. The covering, both
on the roof and sides, will consist of hand split cedar shingles laid a foot to the weather, giving a silvery gray ef
fect. In the interior the walls are to be paneled to a height of ei^ht feet with wide redwood boards fastened by
wooden keys. Above this the walls will be roughly plastered and colored a deep red. The trusses of the roof will be
formed of 12x12 rough pine beams, supported by heavy ship knees, and the rafters of 6x6 rough pine, all stained a
deep brown. To add to the rustic effect the posts supporting the beams on the porch will be redwood trunks, three
feet in diameter, with the bark left op.
The building was designed by A. C. Schweingarth. In size it will be 75 feet square, with a seating capacity
of 300. It will be erected at a total cost of $5000. The building committee consists of W. B. Payson, Edmund Gray
and J. L. Bunnell. The trustees of the church are Professor "William Carey Jones, Edwin Bunnell and S. N. Wyckoff.
they do something to deserve punishment
I do not think It would be right to reduce
them. They have been put to consider
able expense in acquiring new uniforms
and badges for which they receive no
compensation, and as their salary is just
equal to that of a patrolman they should
be left undisturbed."

LIQUOR IN CAMP.
Sheriff White Says He Believes It to
Be Illegal.
OAKLAND, June 25.â Referring to the
possibility of several saloon*, springing up
around the camp to be established at
Bather, Sheriff White said io-day:
"It won't be allowed if I can prevent
It," he declared. "I was surprised and
disgusted the other day when I visited
Camp Merritt and saw enlisted men
drinking and carousing In saloons. Dur
ing the civil war I was connected with
the provost department and such a thin*
as selling liquor to an enlisted man waa
not permitted.
"In 1861 the Congress of the United
States passed a law declaring that no
liquor should be sold to enlisted men. I
believe you will find that law has never
been repealed. But whether it has 01
not, It is outrageous to permit enlisted
men to be served with liquor In saloons
at or near a camp. They are permitted
to carry sldearms, and just Imagine thÂ«
results of a squad of infantrymen with
sword-bayonets being permitted to fill
themselves with liquor in a saloon. Sup
pose they quarrel; it means a fight and
somebody wounded, and perhaps killed,
or at least permanently disabled.
"Then again new recruits who may
soon be called into active service In a.
cHmate they are not accustomed to,
should not be soaked with whisky or beei.
Men die under such conditions; die like
sheep. They are the first to fall victims
to fevers; they are unable to endure the
hardships of marching under arms, to say
nothing of enduring the shock of bai
tle.
"No, sir; we will have no more saloon*
around the new camp site if I can pre
vent it, am l I believe that I can. I shall
most certainly try to."

AN ACT OF HEROISM.
Jack Brady, a Boatman, Saves the
Life of His Friend, Jack
Richardson.
An act of heroism was performed yes
terday by Jack Brady, a boatman, which
resulted In saving his friend, Jack Rich
ardson, from a watery grave.
The two friends went out in a Whitehall
boat, and when off Selby's smelting
works the boat capsized. Brady man
aged to get on the keel of the upturned
boat and dragged Richardson beside
him. Richardson was washed off several
times, but Brady rescued him each time.
The revenue cutter Hartley went to tha
men's assistance and rescued them just
in time, at least for Richardson, as he
was thoroughly exhausted, and Brady's
strength could not have held out much
longer. Richardson was rolled on a bar
rel and other remedies taken to bring
him back to consciousness till they were
successful. He had a close shave, and
but for Brady would have been "across

Silver Queen delayed the start by un
steadiness a few scores, and to a very
uneven send off they were sent away by
Joe Selby at least two lengths ahead of
the pole, which advantage Smith made
good by early taking the pole. Reet, the
favorite, made a disastrous break in the
second quarter and was passed by every
horse in the race. Selby, after a com
manding lead through the back stretch,
was joined at the head of the stretch by
Favor and Mamie Riley when a hot fight
for the heat ensued. At the seven fur
long post Joe Selby stopped, having shot
his bolt, and a very pretty brush from
that point to the wire between Tounn
Durfee with Mamie Riley and Clark with
Favor aroused the enthusiasm of the
grand stand, Favor securing the verdict
by half a length over the daughter or
McKinney in the fast time of 2:2lV*. Rect,
the topheavy favorite, finished absolutely
last.
The 2:20 pace, also a mile dash, brought
to the wire five starters, of which four
wore the deadly hopple?. Dictatus, the
well-known son of Red WiNces, owned by
that good sportsman, F. M. Day, was
strongly fancied and made an even money
favorite, sustaining the good opinions of
his supporters by winning very handily
over Fitz Aymoa, Masten easing him on
the stretch and looking back over his
shoulder so as not to take too fast a
mark. The heat was 2:l9Vi, the last quar

6howed capacity to beat 2:20.
The fourth race brought out a grand
field of five bloodlike representatives of
the 2:13 class. Each had strong support
with Jack W an even money favorite
Mamie Griffin, a well-played second
choice, at 6 to 5, Monterey and Galette at
about fours and twos. In the auctions it
was Jack W and the field $10 "write your
own ticket." Jack W after standing
Griffin on her head at the first turn was
joined near the half by Monterey and
Galette, the pace at this point being too
hot for the favorite and Monterey went
to the front in the fast time of 1:06% the
second quarter having been trotted in
;32%â a 2:11 gait. On the homestretch
Williams had merely to steady the son
of Sidney, as it was all over but the
shouting. In a very close finish for the
place Galette outfooted Jack W, Mamie
Griffin and Thompson trailing in far in
the rear. Time 2:13>4. which shows the
Oakland track to be strictly first-class as
it was not a fast day because of the cool
atmosphere and strong wind.
Last on the programme was the ill
placed 2:40 pace, conditions of which
being the best two in three, rendered it
tiresome between heats, despite the best
efforts of the orchestra. The scoring was
prolonged to fourteen ragged come-downs,
after which they -were sent away to a fair
start for so unwieldy a field. Primrose,
which was heavily played for tiie heat
led the hoppled Mark H a merry chase
till near the half, when both left their
stride, and Nelson sent I Direct from
fourth position into the lead, opening up a
twenty-length gap around the upper turn
and kept a terrific clip to the drawgate
when he was taken back and Jogged home
an easy winner in 2:21%. Roderick, which
was a long shot in the books, outflnished
the handsome Primrose for the place
Captain Hackett, Peanuts, Alsandy and
Rex Alto were confronted -with the ban
ner.
The- second heat saw I Direct a pro
hibitive favorite, and he won hands down
in 2:18*4. Resort, which finished last in
the opening heat, paced the stretch very
fast, and, overhauling the Primrose inside
the distance flag, got the place. Lindo fell
by the wayside, finishing the wrong side
of the banner. The winner is a full
brother to the one-time phenomenon
Rokeby, 2:13^4.
In the first heat he showed perceptibly
lame, but this wore away as the race pro
gressed. He is a worthy representative
of the house of Direct and bids fair to
take a fast mark, barring accidents.

WHEAT MARKET HAS
A BEARISH TENDENCY
HEAVY SELLINGS DURING THE
PAST THREE DAYS.
A Steady Decline in Farm Products
Generally â Barley Market in
Bad Condition.
Farm products, while not materially
lower than a week ago, still show de
clining tendencies. Liverpool quotations
during the past week have daily shown
a small decline as compared with the
previous day. Paris markets became im
bued with bearish inclinations and have
shown a marked decline for the week.
The situation abroad is one where buy
ers took fright and overstocked them
selves with wheat at very high prices.
Now they are selling futures in our mar
kets to hedge first holdings. Some for
eign importers have, upon technical
grounds, refused purchases made from
Leiter, using as a basis of their refusal
that the goods were not equal to sample,
which course will probably prove of no
avail to them. The trade throughout the
world know that Leiter's wheat is the
best the market affords. The refusal to
accept is merely to avoid a loss. Ihe
failure of Leiter has put all wheat mar
kets in a state of chaos, no one knowing
what to expect next.
Another depressing factor is the good
crop prospects, which were par excel
lence until the past ten days, when much
danger was reported from the South
western States by too much moisture and
cold, unseasonable weather. Upon these
reports shorts and the Southwest bought
freely, causing an advance to 69Vic for
September wheat. Added to these bull
ish factors came reports of damage to
the French crops, which was later de
nied, effecting a general change in senti
ment.
Heavy selling by those who bought
early in the week characterized the mar
ket during the last three days of the
week. The market yielded stubbornly,
but the bears succeeded in forcing the
price to 66Vic for September and 6fi3ic for
December at the close on Saturday. Ar
mour and his following have been persis
tent sellers of the deferred futures and
buyers of cash wheat, spot being in good
demand at 8c to 10c over July, which op
tion is about 5c over September. At pres
ent'the feeling in the wheat market from
a professional standpoint is bearish.
There is a bright side to look upon that
is at this time well to consider. The trade
Is discountig a crop of "50,000.000, or
100.000,000 more than the Government re
port of June 10 estimated. There has
been considerable damage done to the
crop of winter wheat. The harvesting of
winter wheat will begin after July 4. The
continuous rains of late. If they continue,
will make harvesting late and additional
damage result. The yield per acre, it is
claimed by well-posted grain men, will
prove disappointing. The spring wheat
section is rapidly approaching a period
where conditions, if a change comes,
must be for the worse. It seems only
reasonable that prices are as low as they
really should be. Sentiment has carried
with it a period of depression which later
on may prove unwarranted. Foreigners
will waift American wheat at prices much
above those prevailing at present. June
is about over and liquidation by long
holders of July, if not entirely over, is
well nigh so. It would not be unexpect
ed to see a change for the better after
July 1. Wheat in the local market sold
at $1 22%. for December during the week.
At the decline shippers were quietly buy
ing. Should any accident happen to the
Oregon and Washington crops an ad
vance of no small proportions would oc
cur. Shorts are becoming more cautious
and playing close to shore. The bulls are
holding off, awaiting- some favorable
signs that will strengthen their position.
Barley continues steady around $1 12%
for .December. Considerable old barley Is
arriving from the north. It will take con

THE THISTLE CLUB.
Interest in the Sixteenth Annual
Gathering and Gamea Increasing.
As the time draws nearer interest In
the sixteenth annual gathering and
games of the San Francisco Scottish
Thistle Club to be held in Shell Mound
Park on July Fourth is increasing. The
arrangements for the event are of the
most elaborate description, and the pa
trons of the club may expect a rare day's
sport and amusement.
Besides the usual athletic events there
will be some n#w and novel features, one
of the most entertaining being a cake
walk between Major Waters and Milton
Johnson, champions of Oakland, and
Charles O'Brien and John Duke, cham
pions of San Francisco.
There will be dancing in the two pa
vilions all day and at night, the music
being supplied by a celebrated band.
The games will be under the supervision
of the official starter, John Donaldson,
Royal Chief Dawson and Recorder Pa
terson. Andrew Rosa, the chieftain ot
the club, has made all arrangements for
the entertainment of the guests, and they
may expect a right royal Highland wel
j come.
In the evening there will be a grand
display of fireworks, embracing a num
ber of patriotic features. Soldiers and
I sailors of the army and navy will be ad
: mitted to the grounds free of charge, and
any participating in the athletic events
will not be charged an entrance fee.
A Point for Supervisors.
The Supreme Court holds that a Super
visor cannot secure a demand from the
county for any other services than those
specified by law. This was brought out
in the mandamus proceedings of D. C.
Shepherd, a Supervisor of San Joaquin
County, who in 1595 attended the Super
visors' convention in Los Angeles. He
presented his bill for expenses and the
board passed the demand, that bods r hav
ing by resolution authorized the attend
ance at the convention. The Auditor re
fused to draw his warrant for the de
mand and his position was upheld by the
Superior Court, whose decision was af
firmed by the Supreme Court.

GRAFTERS
STILL WORK
THE PRISON
Information Is Given
From the Inside.
SEYMOUR IS INDIGNANT
THE CAPTAIN IS MAKING AN
INVESTIGATION.
If the Offenders Are Caught They
Will Be Summarily Dismissed
From the Depart
ment.
The order issued by Captain Seymour
prohibiting: scheming attorneys from
entering the City Prison is being gross
ly violated. Somebody connected with
the pYison manages to furnish the dis
reputable gang with information con
cerning the names of the unfortunate
Inmates, particularly those who have
any money booked to their credit.
As an instance a middle-aged man
named Charles Kngstrom was arrested
yesterday afternoon and charged with
disturbing the peace. Less than five
minutes after he was thrown in prison
a Police Court practitioner named
Webb visited the office of the Chief of
Police and by representing that Eng
stronijiad sent for him, procured an or
der directed to the prison keeper, al
lowing the attorney to see him. After
learning that he had $fi SO on the prison
blotter the attorney hunted up Judge
Mogan, and influenced him to issue an
order for the release of the prisoner on
his own recognizance.
How Webb managed to learn the
name of the defendant is puzzling
Captain Seymour. He is strongly in
clined to believe that somebody con
nected with the prison is guilty of fur
nishing tht^ names of the unfortunate
inmates to the unscrupulous gang.
Since the issuance of the order for
bidding the disreputable horde of hu
man vultures from visitfrig the prison
every efi'ort has been made to induce
Captain Seymour to rescind it. Know
ing the grafting -â-"Densities of the
gang Seymour stood firm and an
nounced that under no circumstances
would he permit an attorney to enter
the prison except that he was sent for
by a prospective client.
Evidently believing that some prison j
attache Mould interest himself In be- I
half of a trusted member of the gang. |
expecting to receive a portion of the i
fees collected by him, Seymour notified '
the vaj-ious officers of the city bastile j
that a violation of the order would re
sult in the offender being taken before
the Police Commissioners and sum- j
marily dismissed from the department.
Notwithstanding hi? warning it is I
strongly believed that one or more at- i
tachea of the prison manage to secretly i
give information to the gang, which I
enables its chief grafters to "work" the j
unfortunate prisoners despite the vigi- |
lance of Captain Seymour. It is known
that the latter is making a quiet in
vestigation and confidently expects to
land the offenders.
ROBBERY AT STJTRO HEIGHTS.
B. F. Thrush of Mendocino County a
Victim of ,Pea and Shell
Game Men.
B. F. Thrush and R. F. Harmon, from
Fort Brarp". Mendocino County, went to
Sutro Heights yesterday, and during their
peregrinations they pot Into what is
knowr as tho maze. Thore they wf>re ac
costed by two operators of the pea and
shell (tame, who asked them to try their
luck at RTiessinp.
They declined, and one of them remark
ed that they had not pot any money.
Thrush pulled $30 out of his pocket. Quick
as liphtninp one of the pea and shell men
snatched a $10 frold piece out of Thrush's
hand and skipped, followed by his part
ner.
Thrush was wandering around the maze
alone in search of the man who robbed
him v\ en a stranger came up to him and
threatened to arrest him for Rambling.
Thrush was glad to pet away as quickly
a? possible, but when he met Pollcem-m
Schafer later he told him of how he had
been robbed. Schafer took him to police
headquarters, where a description of the
rubber was taken.
A Probable Suicide.
The body nf a man supposed to be L. D.
Kuepter was found yesterday morning at
1 o'clock on a bench in Columbia Park on
Folsom street, between Seventh and
Eighth. A bottle which had contained
cyanide of potassium was found In the
vicinity. The corpse was taken to the
Morgue and an inquest will be held. The
deceased was a member of Vallejo Loctee
No. 70. A. O. D. "W., and resided at 5:13

and the door was slammed in his
face.
That was a hard blow to Mike
Kelly, the dandy of the turf, the
pride of the Jockeys, and a prince
among horsemen. Then, too, it was
his sister who disowned him.
Kelly told the story of his miseries
to a sympathetic barber while his head
was being swathed in cooling towels.
"I was a Rube," he said. "I came
fresh from the hay fields of Sacra
mento, and the corn tassels stamped
me as a jay. I thought I was wise,
but I am wiser now. Talk about ex
perience. I have had it. When I go
out again I will have a guardian."
M. J. Kelly is one of the best known
horsemen on the Pacific Coast. He
has a good string of horses at his
â stables In Sacramento that he is now
preparing for the circuit meets. His
fellow horsemen class him as a jolly
good fellow, and in Sacramento the
people say there is no better man
living. He came to San Fran
cisco on Thursday to get some of the
Sacramento ennui out of his system,
and as soon as he landed from the
ferry boat -he met a number of East

races during the season ami as a re-

tastes of the free lunch stews they
have so lone lived on. There were
half a dozen of them, and they wel
comed Kelly as a godsend. Kelly had
known them in a distant sort of a
way while the races were in progress.
None of them he knew well enough
to make bosom companions of, but
they seemed good fellows, and they
piloted him into a saloon. Of course,
Kelly was friendly.

sorry for them even though they did
not complain of their hard luck. It
was in the evening when we met, and
In my dazed way now I can count up
to five <lrinks all around. Then we
started to go. I can faintly remember
seeing a lot of tall buildings toppling
over as I got out on the sidewalk, and
then all was a blank.
"Hy the aid of the prison register
I found myself on Friday morning. I
will never forget the feelings I had
while I was coming to. For a while
I thought I was In the great beyond
and that I had gone wrong on the road
and landed below. 1 was lying on a
hard board, and a little yellow light
from a flickering gas jet streamed In
on me. I lay there for a while trying
to think where I was, but gave it up.
After a 'while I managed to sit up on
a rude bench and presently I began to
see the form of a man sitting near
me holding his head in his hands and
moaning:. My eyea began to get ac
customed to the light and my feet
stuck out in a bright streak from the
gas jet that came toward me. Then I
was dar.tii all the more. They were
not my shoes I had on, and for a while
I had 4Houbts about them being my
feet. I moved first one leg. then the
other, and the feet moved with them.
God! it was nwful. The shoe on the
right foot was a brogan that somo
tramp had thrown away. The sole
was gone almost through and my toes
stuck out through a great hole in the
side. It was big enough for me to
get both my feet in. The other
boot was even worse. Half the upper
was gone and a great hole in a dirty
sock 1 had on that foot showed my
bare toes. Then I stood up. It was
the first time I fully realized I -was
not dead. Then I began to experi
ment with myself to see If I was not
dreaming. I sat down, then stood up
again. Then I turned around. I wag
alive and awake, but very shaky. I
had a hat on my head. I took it off
and looked at it. It was a daisy. I
hnd never seen one like it before at
Fiich close inspection. Half the crown
of it was gone and the brim was scol
loped around the edges, and it was
dirty all over. I had never had a hat
that could be made to look like it. I
was puzzled. Then I took a lftok at
my clothes. No tramp was ever so
disreputable as I looked. A pair of
dirty patched overalls fastened about
the waist by a piece of rope and many
Sizes too large for me, and a rusty,
ragged coat that had apparently been
fished from some garbage barrel, made
up my apparel. Some frayed under
clothes and a tattered shift that did
not smell very clean were next to my
skin. Where I eot them I do not
know.
"About the time I got through with
the survey of myself the nan near
me looked up and hunched away from
mo. He was well dressed, and I did
not blame him. He eyed me with dis
gust for a while, then he sank on &
bench and rubbed his head.
" 'Where am I?" I asked.
"He looked at me a moment, then
feebly replied with a moan as he rested
his head in his hands, "in jail.'
" 'In Jail! How long have I been
here?'
"'I don't know.' he replied. 1 have
Just come to myself.'
" 'What day isthis?' I asked, hoping
to solve the mystery.
"'I don't know," be replied. 'It must
be Thursday, or Friday or Saturday.'
"I began to study out the bars of
the cell about that time, and soon
after a trusty came along and with
a rattle of keys opened the cell door .
and placed a couple of chunks of
bread on a bench near us. Then an
other trusty came along and handed
in a couple of tin cups of V tleg
coffee. The man who was with mo
in the cell gulped down the coffee, and
it sizzled as it went down. 'Drink
the coffee,' he said to me. 'It will do
you good.'
"I reached for It but my hand
trembled so I could hardly hold the
cup. I managed to get some of it
down. It made me feel better, and
then I began to wonder how I got
there. My watchâ it was a valuable
oneâ my diamond pin and diamond cuff
buttons were gone. My clothing had
been lost in the shuffle and I did not
have a cent, though I had several hun
dred dollars in my pockets when I
met those 'good fellows' soon after I
arrived with the corn tassels hanging
to me. Those 'good fellows,' I guess,
are now on the way home across the
Rockies to mamma and a square meal
with my money and my clothes and
my diamonds.
"I can't kick. I was a Rube and
an easy game. The 'knock-out' drops
they -put in the good red liquor 1 was
foolish enough to pay for did it all
They Just played me one, two, three,
and I was a sure shot. Where they
took me after they had me fixed with
dope I do not know, but they did their
work well, and they did not leave me
even a sock fit to wear.
"Soon after I got the coffee down in
the cell another trusty came along,
and with a bang opened the door of
the cell.
" 'Tumble out here, you bums,' he
yelled. My companion shuffled out
and I followed him. There were sev
eral old soaks standing alone in a
line and I was put with them Then
a sergeant came along. 'Rrnom bri
gade fall in,' he yelled as he came
toward us. Then he began to call the
roll. Two or three answered 'here' to
their names. 'M. J. Kelly,' bawled the
sergeant. I started to explain, but I
was cut short, 'Answer to your name '
the officer yelled and I feebly replied
with a 'here.' Then a trusty gave
each of us a broom and started us to
work. We worked about an hour
sweeping out the prison, then we were
turned loose.
"It was then that the real trouble

The court read a lengthy opinion over
ruling the arguments of the defendants
aB to their contention that the law was
unconstitutional, and concluded as fol
lows:
Has Congress the power to prescribe the
terms and conditions under which lubor shall
be performed In the construction of public
works of the United States, and without refer
ence to the fact whether such public works are
or are not upon land over which the national
Government exercises exclusive political juris
diction? I entertain nn doubt of the authority
of Congress in this respect. Public works are
Instrumentalities for the execution of the pow
<ts of government. In the conduction of Its
public works thf United States exercises the
power which belongs to It as a sovereign na
tion, and as a necessary Incident of Its sover
eignty has the right to legislate In reference
to all matters relating to the construction of
such works. Including the number of hours
which shall constitute a day's labor for those
employed in such work. Uws have been
passed limiting the hours for the labor of letter
carriers in any one day and for tho>=e employed
in the navy yards of the fnlted States, and for
all laborers and mechanics employed "by or on
behalf of the Government of the United States,"
and the power of Congress to pass such laws
hjis never been seriously questioned. In my
opinion Congress has the same power to pro
vide that laborers upon public works of the
United States shall not be required or per
mitted to work more than eight hours In one
day, and It may compel obedience to such a
law by providing that its violation shall con
stitute an offense against the United States
and be punished as such.
Nor Is this right of legislation In the least
impaired or affected by the fact that such
public work* may be erected upon lnnd over
which the State retains political Jurisdiction,
as the sovereignty of the State does not ex
tend to matters connected with or Incident to
the construction of public works of the United
States, and Congress. In providing as it has for
the punishment of any contractpr upon such
public works, or any officer of the United
States who should violate the provisions of the
law under consideration, was not legislating
upon a subject which in any manner trenches
commenced. I had the worst, dirti
est and slouchiest togs on that a
human being ever wore. The measli
est tramp that ever was devised would
refuse to wear such clothes. I stood
on the street dazed for a moment. I did
not know where to go. Then I finally
thought of my sister, who lives in the
Western Addition and on one of the
fashionable streets. I did not have
a cent and I had to walk.
[ pulled the hat down over my
fnce and started. I reached the house
i',nd rang the bell. My sister came to
the door.
"I was aÃhamed to look at her, and
she only got sight of the disreputable
being in tatters and dirt. I waa a
villainous looking being, and as there
were no men in the house she took
the wisest course when she saw my
rags and said: 'We have nothing for
you,' and slammed the door.
"I know the sight of a tramp at
the door scared her, and as i still
had the hat over my face she did not
have a chance to recognize me. I was
then in an awful nx. I rapped on the
door and whistled to agnin attract
attention. My sister finally opened
an upstairs window and called
to me to know what I wanted.
" 'It's me, Mike, ynur brother, hon
est it is â look at meâ and I took off the
rag of a hat BO she could see my face.
"She studied out my features after
a while, and then came down and let
me in.
"I took good care not to sit down
anywhere in the house, and as soon as
1 fould I got the tramp's riothing off
and made a bonfire of them in the
back yard. After a boiling hot bath
I borrowed one of my brother-in-law's
night shirts and then went to
bed, meanwhile telegraphing to my
wife In Sacramento to hurry
to San Francisco with a com
plete outfit of clothing for me. I re
mained in bed until she arrived."
It was early on Thursday evening
when Kelly met the racetrack friends,
but it was about 4 o'clock on Friday

been administered to him, and dressed

upon the reserved powers of the State. The
subject matter of the law Is one which con
cerns only the Government of the United States
and over which It has the right to exercise
supreme and exclusive control, notwithstanding
the fact that the State, for all purposes relat
ing to the government of the State and the ad
ministration of its laws, retains political Juris
diction over the land upon which such public
works may be erected.
This conclusion necessarily results from a
consideration of the fact that under American
constitutional law the national Government and
the States which compose It are clothed with
separate powers of sovereignty over distinct
subjects within their respective spheres of ac
tion, and which powers may therefore be exer
cised by each without coming Into conflict with
the other.

INFLUENCE

ing Corporations.
MAY FAVOR A DARK HORSE
A DESIRE TO DEFEAT BULLA
FOR SENATOR.
Southern Republicans Are Alarmed
at the Way in Which Events
Are Now Being
Shaped.
Republicans in the southern part of
the State are becoming alarmed at the
apparent attempt of the Southern Pa
cific Company and other corporation
influences to cause a split in the party
and thereby rob the South of any of
the prospective fruits of the coming
election.
As far as this part of the State Is
concerned this activity on the part of
the corporations has a significance that
is not well understood, but with the
south it is an assured fact and the
consequences are only too apparent.
Henry T. Gage has been put forward
as a candidate for the gubernatorial
nomination, and during the past week
the radius of his boom has been ex
tended until now the whole State is
being canvassed in a quiet way in his
| interests. Republicans north of the
Tehachapi line are speculating as to
whether this means that Gage is to be
the bona fide candidate of the railroad
interests for the gubernatorial nomi
nation, and on the other side of the
line the politicians are guessing
whether or not the Gage boom will rob
the south of its rightful claim to- the
I next United States Senator.
As to the latter contingency it is very
certain that the corporation influences
will spare no pains to defeat R. N.
Bulla for the Senatorship and to se
cure the election of a man from this
end of the State who will be the cham
! pion of the railroad interests in the
, halls of the national Congress. Should
I the southern delegation gu to the State
| Convention with but one declared ob-
I ject, and that the right to name the
â  man who is to be the next Senator, it
is certain that such a right would be
conceded them. If, however, the del-
egation could be wholly or partially
won over to the cause of Gage and his
candidacy the result desired by the
railroad politicians would be attained.
The north would refuse to recognize
the claims of the south to both the Sen
ator and the Governor, and the nomi
nation of the one md the election of
the other would be given to men from
this end of the State. This would, of
course, give the railroad people a
chance to put men of their own se
lection into the coveted places. This
being so, it Is not surprising that the
corporation hirelings are pushing the
Gage boom with all due diligence. At
thp instigation of Mr. Mills of the Ht
erary bureau the subsidized press of
the southern end of the State have ta
kf>n up the question and are printing
double-leaded editorials, asking why
the south should not be entitled to
both Senator and Governor. They men
tion Gage's candidacy as one of the
proposed stepping stones to southern
supremacy.
The question of whether or not the
corporations are assisting 1 the Gage
boom with any other intention than
that of defeating Bulla for United
States Senator is one that is at this mo
ment receiving the serious considera
tion of the friends of every man in this
end of the State who is a candidate for
the place at the head of the ticket.
Pome ordinarily astute politicians pro
fess to believe that the railroad com
pany has in view a northen man whom
it wishes to put forward as the Repub
lican candidate for Governor. These
same politicians say that General Chip
man is the man of the hour in the cor
poration camp. They point to the fact
that Chipman has considerable
strength In the north and very little in
the south. To correct this defect the
railroad company has put up Gage as
a candidate in the south, with the ex
pectation that he can go before the
convention with at least a portion of
the strength of the southern delega
tion. At the proper moment this
strength could be traded to Ohipman
and the desired result would be at
tained.
General Chlpman has already ac
knowledged his willingness to be se
lected as the Republican nominee for
Governor, and has thus paved the way
for what Is to follow, if. indeed, there
is anything Ui the conclusion of those
who profess to believe that Gage's can
didacy is only a clever political ruse to
throw the general off the real
trend of the railroad company's de
sires.
In connection with present guberna
torial possibilities the attitude of the
Populist party is not uninteresting.
The Cator following, which is the pro
gramme element of the parti- have se
lected T. W. H. Shanahan as their can
didate for Governor. Cator has agreed
to deliver the San Francisco delegation
and Shanahan's nomination is deemed
certain. This condition of things is dis
pleasing to that portion of the -arty
known as "middle-of-the-road Popu
lists," and they threaten to boycott
the convention. They say that the date
of the convention Is too early and that
it was so fixed In order to give the pro
grammers an opportunity to put up a
ticket that can be used for trading
purposes. They claim that Shanahan
is trying to place himself in a nosftion
where he can trade to the Democrats
his nomination for Governor for the
fusion nomination for Lieutenant Gov
ernor.
Since the publication in these col
umns of the fact that Bfagulre's friends
had proposed to George W. Monteith
that he become a candidate for the
Populist nomination for Governor with
the understanding- that in case he se
cured it he would resign his candidacy,
provided the Democrats nominated Ma
gruire. the prominent Populists in the
interior have signified their marked
disapproval of the scheme. Such men
as Taylor Rogers, Daywalt and John
son have frequently been attacked by
Maguire and his friends and they now
propose to retaliate.
Monteith makes the following state
ment in reply to the question as to his
candidacy:
I don't want to be a candidate in any
active sense and will not be. If the con
vention wants to nominate me I will
abide by its action, and If it desires me
to stick to the end I will accept its de
claration in that particular .is absolute
and final and entertain no fusion propo
sition that is not ordered by the conven
tion.
Personally I don't think there will be
any fusion. I think the Populists in
tend to go it alone, and if they do I
think they will poll more votes than the
Democrats will. There are just two
planks that ought to be included in the
State platformâ smash the Railroad Com

MARYSVILLES BIG FETE.
Nation's Anniversary to be Fittingly
Observed â C. W. Harney's
Account.
"The citizens of Marysvllle are actively
at work preparing a most novel and en
tertaining celebration for the Fourth of
July," said G. W. Harney, a well known
resident of that city yestcrdny.
"All the towns in Northern California
have been invited to join with the Marys
ville people in giving expression to their
patriotism on the great day: the South
ern Pacific Company has agreed to give
special low ratesf and extra accommoda
tions in order that all may have a cnance
to see the greatest celebration ever held
in that portion of the State.
"The celebration will be a representa
tion of the battle of Manila. This will be
given on Ellis Lake, in the northern
suburbs of Marysville. Upon an island
in the lake the forts and land batteries
of Cavite will be erected . There are now
under construction twenty battle-ships
and cruisers, ten to represent the Ameri
can navy and ten the Spanish navy. The
Spanish ships will be drawn up in front
of the forts and batteries, while the
Americans will be located in a cove in the
lake out of sight. When the signal is
given the Americans will sail out and
commence a terrific bombardment of the
Spanish fort and ships, which will result
in their utter and picturesque destruc
tion. .
The Manila fight is for evening enter
tainment. In the morning a patriotic
parade will be given, consisting of floats
representing ships in the American navy,
especially Admiral Dewey'a flagship
Olympia. One of the citizens of Marys
ville, who bears a striking resemblance
to that great naval hero, will be on the
bridge to represent him. A representa
tion of a 13-inch gun and other patriotic
floats will be shown; also a living moving
flag, made up of 100 young ladies in cos
tume. There will be other features.
A grand ball In the new Armory Hall
will wind up the festivities.
The citizens of Marysville are endeavor-
Ing to perfect an arrangement with the
Governor whereby the Northern Califor
nia military companies may be permitted
to assemble at Marysville on the Fourth
and there give their farewell ciress pa
rade before being ordered to Manila. All
the members of the general committee
having charge of the celebration, twenty
five In number, have arranged to dress
up in the costume of Uncle Sam and to
parade at the head of the procession.
The costumes will be brilliant and com
plete and will undoubtedly be considered
a unique feature.
"Another feature that is in the nature
of an advertisement of the city of Marys
ville, in that it is intended to show off the
special advantages for light and power
that Marysville now possesses will be the
erection on the principal street of an im
mense arch. This arch is to be covered
with electric lights arranged in patriotic
designs, such as the waving American
flag, the American eagle, the names of
American army and navy heroes, shields
and emblems. An immense number of
lights will be required and they will
serve to show that Marysville has made
great strides In modern light and power
engineering."

They called it by various and sundry other names. They called it snobbery, discourtesy, brutality, in
breeding and the bad manners of Captain March.
The Astor Battery landed in San Francisco to find the women of the Red Cross waiting, so to
speak, on the city's wharves, with refreshment: in their hands, garlands at their breasts, blessings on
their lips and in their souls that sweet effusive sentimental enthusiasm which makes woman what she is,
ever adorable in the right place, and more or less of a nuisance out of it.
The commanding officer of the Astor Battery, Captain Peyton C. March, refused their hospitality,
declined their garlands, ignored their enthusiasm. It is said that his manner of doing these three
things was offensive, but of that I cannot be sure, since I have heard six stories about it, and each
one of th^m differs from the other.
It was certain that he was met by the herald of the Cross, a very self-respecting. God-fear
ing, soldier-loving gentleman, who in vited him with all his men to breakfast and banquet at
the sign of the Red Cross.
"My men," said Captain March, "have had breakfast." /
It was explained to him that all soldiers coining and going to war by way of San Fran
cisco breakfasted, lunched or dined with the Red Cross whether they had breakfast
ed, lunched or dined previously or not.
"My men," said Captain March, "are regulars."
It was explained to him that regulars and volunteers yielded alike to the gentle
tyranny of the ministering angels of the army.
"I wish," said Captain March, "to get my men to camp as soon as possible."
And the herald went with drooping plumes to carry the message to the Cmss.
It was heard and scarce believed. Two fair emissaries went'overto the Astor
Battery and pleaded plaintively of the disappointment which waited a refusal.
They found the Commanding officer fl rm.
And when had the men breakfasted? At five o'clock. Poor dears! It
Was now past seven. And what had they breakfasted on? Coffee and hard
tack. La me! But that was poor fare. And when would they have their
lunch? When they got to Camp Merritt. Dear heart! But that was
long walking. And couldn't the Captain, please? And wouldn't he now?
And just an orange apiece, a rose and a cup of coffee? And here
was one of his personal friends' to ask, and here was another to
urge! And so, at last, by coaxing, pleading, teasing, nagging, su
lr.g, begging, an<l praying sore, the women of the Red Cross did
feed a trifling sandwich and a cup of coffee each to the men
of the Astor Battery who sang sweetly to them for the sup
per until they were curtly ordered to fall in by their ir
ritated Captain and marched away up Market street, leaving
their reputations behind them.
They also left twelve men as post guard of equip
ment at the depot, and the deceitful dozen feasted fa
mously behind their Captain's vanishing back and put
away hard-boiled eggs In their pockets.
"I saw them myself," said a Red Cross girl,
"when they thought we were not looking."
Chilled in the glow of kindly impulse, check
ed in an act of courtesy, disappointed in the
pleasures of hospitality, and more than all
the rest, disregarded at the very peak of
popularity, ignored at the summit of im
portance, the Red Cross women took the
Bnub to heart and grieved upon it as
"What! Not feed soldiers? Not
pin flowers to soldiers' breasts?
Not pet soldiers? Not pity sol
diers? All soldiers? Not be
cheered and honored and
praised and sung and
fie<-n?"

flannel bands and comfort baps, count money, fold garments, â write and answer letters while braves are passing, flag*

Only a few work this way for the Army.
And so they talked their sorrows over with the press and what the tongue had spared the pen destroyed. Be*
fore the Astor Battery had its tent ropes stretched over the sands of Camp Merritt, it had not a manner to its name.
It was a company of snobs, a gathering of gilded upstarts, a horde of purse-proud barbarians from the East. The
evening papers reproved them, the morning papers reviled them. And from arm to arm of the Red Cross their
name was spoken in contempt.
"Halt!" said the sentry before the Astor Camp.
He looked much like other sentries on a hot and windy day. He wore no coat, and his army shirt was
white in every fold with little drifts of sand. His face had gathered dust; his eyes winked it away; his
hair was gray with it; his hands were rough and soiled. The red artillery stripe "ran down his legs, a red
kerchief was knotted at his throat. He was of fair height, well made, well browned straight
strong, young. I would not have picked him for a doctor, a lawyer, a Prince, a priest or anything
but a soldier. â¢
The camp looked much like other camps under good military discipline. Its waste of sand was
raked up clean. No women sat at the tent flaps nor loitered on its field. N'n men crossed it ex
cept men in the uniform of the Battery. No fringe of soldiers and civilians hung to the fence.
It was possible to walk around its four sides, without being winked at, leered upon, spoken to.
or importuned for beefsteaks, cigarettes, whisky or the money to procure the same. This
was the day before the Supervisors closed the streets about Camp Merritt by way of re
trieving the error of ever having left them open.
"No admittance to camp," said the sentry.
"My card, if you please, to Captain March."
"Corporal of the guardâ two!"
"By appointment?" asked the corporal
"No."
"I shall have to ask you to wait here."
He passed over the sand to the tent before which floats the Battery's col
ors ~ a *? eld s Â°arlet with gold cannon crossed. When he plowed back, a long
man in the fatigue dress of a first lieutenant of artillery plowed after
nim. This long man gave me smileless greeting.
"I am Captain March."
He uncovered and stood holding his soft hat in his hand, a tall,
lean, dark, slim-waisted figure against the stretch of sand. His
face is lor.qr, ending in a pointed beard, delicately cut, of good
feature and somewhat somber expression. His eyes are
grave, gray, direct.
"I don't expect you to be cordial," I said, remem
bering certain press comments.
"At le ast I needn't keep you standing outside
the gates," he answered. "Won't you come
in? Will you walk over to my tent? Will
you sit down here or would you rather go
inside?"
"I will go inside, thank you. I don't
think your manners are so bad."
"Don't you?"
"You know they are consid
ered impossible."
â¢Are they?"

I DON'T believe there is going to be
the boom after the war that every
one is talking about. If the war
goes on for a long time, as I think
- it will, things will be slow readjust
â¢ ing themselves and securities will see a
gradual recovery. If the war should
â  be over in 30 to 60 days there will be a
quick recovery,.
Securities, both industrial and-\rail- c
road, will be affected pretty much c
alike. We are doing no business and
we shall be doing none till the war is "
over. The railroads are handling a*
heavy business, but it is all artificial. â¢
We are actually doing no business. â¢
Hundreds of thousands of men are idle. Â«
We are spending more than a million '
dollars a day on our army â all of it â¢
the accumulation of the past. We are Â«
piling up a debt which I believe will be i
the biggest we have ever known. 5
I. believe the country can easily take c
care of a debt of a thousand million. <â¢
But we don't want to consider that. '
We must issue bonds to take care of *
the cost of the war as the money is Â«
needed. We could pay cash for the war i
if we wanted to do 50, but it would be 5
too great a burden on the people, so it c
is wiser to issue bonds. '
I do not care to discuss the methods
of placing the bonds. The men at the 5
head of the Government have made a r
study of that matter and they know
what method would be wisest to get â¢
not only the best financial but the best;
moral result. I believe that the loan
will be popular. c
It would be well to sell the bonds at
par In small quantities to the people, Â«
To ask a premium for them and put 5
them up for the highest bidder would c
be too much like huckstering at this*
time. It is better that the bonds should
be distributed among the people, for 5
that will give all the people a greater c
interest "in the Government. It is al- "
ways well to havcthe people feel as
though they were partners in the Gov- s
ernment's business, for then they will c
watch its affairs with greater care and c
see that Its administration is better. â¢
They will be more willing to help it
along, too, if it needs their assistance
in the future. That has always been
my policy in business, and I have never
lost anything by that is, I have 1
made as much as I have lost. $
I think it would be good policy, too, j
to have the people take Government â 
securities in times of peace. England,"
you- know, has a permanent debt and it - t
might be well if the Government of the <
United States had bonds in the hands c
of the people at all times. I was very Â«
much pleased with Chamberlain's <
speech on the subject of England and j

lieve him wrong. We can't trust the
French people. A few of them, like
Lafayette, were patriots, but most of
them you have got to keep under your
eye. They are a fickle people. But the
English you know all about. They are
our natural friends and allies and we
can trust them.
If there is ever a need of it I believe
there should be an offensive and de
fensive alliance with Great Britain.
England and America together can
control the world. I tell you the money
power rules. Napoleon said, "It is the
last sovereign that wins the battle."
He knew. Here we are, a great rich
nation of 74,000,000 people. England
controls fifteen hundred millions. She
controls them through her great wealth.
A combination of the two powers would
be invincible and I believe it is coming.
I tell you the money power rules this
continent. On Wall street is the power
that controls the United States^ The
people of this country cannot do any
thing without coming to Wall street for
the capital. In the same way London
rules the empire of Great Britain. Rus
sia is rich, hut nothing like the com
bination of England and America. I

5 "T TT TE are accustomed to regard
5 \ l\ I war as the exclusive oppor

$v reputations; the struggle for

t Its parallel in the equally fierce struggle
, for wealth on the stock exchange.
\ It was Waterloo that made secure the
I fame of Wellington as a soldier. It was
> Waterloo that made secure also the
' financial dynasty of the Rothschilds.
5 Shrewd old Nathan Rothschild had
5 waited for Napoleon's downfall, firm
5 in the faith that it must sooner or later
5 come. His agents had followed the Cor
â¢ sican in his various campaigns that he
Â» might have the first news of his over
, throw, and during the days immediate
, ly preceding Waterloo he himself was
? in the British army. Indeed, he kept so
' close to the commander-in-chief that
' the "Iron Duke," not knowing him, fan
5 cied he must be either a spy or possible
' assassin, and threatened to hang him
5 if he again appeared near headquarters.

* child from his horse on the hill of
1 Hougoumont watched the struggle of
, the nations, and when at last he saw
, that the French army wwas..inn n retreat,
â¢ posted off to Brussels as fast as 'â  his
' horse could carry him, whence a
5 carriage in waiting conveyed him to;
5 Ostend. There he found a storm raging
â¢ on the channel and the sailors fearful

1 danger when he saw the glint of gold.

5 francs to be taken to the English coast.

tell you it would be invincible. And it
is coming.
I have had private advices all the
time from the other side, and the peo
ple of England are anxious for it. So
are the people of this country. The
Irish will not amount to anything when
the matter comes to be arranged.
When they have been here awhile they
are Americans and they are for the
stars and stripes. I have two or three
Irish servants at my house and they
look down on their poor relatives who
are just over from Ireland.
In case of an Anglo-American alli
ance the old rule of trade will prevail
âbuy where you can buy cheapest and
sell where you can sell dearest. It
would undoubtedly broaden trade op
portunities all over the world. But
whether it would mean free trade or not
would depend entirely on the way free
trade would affect our interests. If we
thought we would prosper more under
free trade with Great Britain, of course
we would adopt it. "But so far the
policy of protection has proved more
profitable to us. The future of this
country lies in the development of its
industrial interests ard in the educa
and public credit ceased to exist.
As stocks and bonds went down
Rothschild bought all the consols, bills
and notes he could raise the money to
pay for. Then he w ited sc -re in his
knowledge of the reaction tha* would
follow the news from Waterloo. On
the 2 M of June this news reached Lon
don. Values went up more rapidly
than they had previously gone down
and shrewd old Nathan Rothschild
counted as his some six millions more
of gold.
Of all the great fortunes of America
the one most distinctly and legitimate
ly a war fortune is that of the Dv
Fonts, who for almost a century have
controlled the manufacture of gun
powder in the United States.
In 1802 Ebenthen Treme Dv Pont, a
French refugee, established himself in
Delaware, where he commenced in a
small way the manufacture of explo
sives. The war of 1812 and the Mexi
can war did much for the industry
which his descendants carried on. In
every generation one or more members
of the family have paid for the family
riches with their lives through ex
plosions in the mills, for the Dv Ponts
must be their own chemists and super
intendents and mechanics. The price
less secrets of their craft pass from
father to son. During the civil war
their contract with the Government
involved millions of dollars, and the
present war with Spain, when me .cost
of firing a single projectile is enorm
ous, will add greatly to their wealth,
which is estimated to exceed one hun
dred millions.
The first effect of the war was to
paralyze trade of every sort, the next
was to stimulate it. The speculative
fever broke out in 1562. Men- speculated
in all the food products, in coal, iron,
dry goods and gold. Very few of these
pureiy speculative fortunes were last
in<~ however. They were made and lost
almost in a day. One of the most in
teresting phases of this war-time
speculation were the operations in gold
which were first conductel in a dirty
and dingy news stall called "Gilpin's
rooms," at the corner of William street
and Exchange Place, New York city.
In two or three months it became the
center of the gold business of the
United States. During the war, when
gold reached 255, the trade amounted to
millions a day and immense fortunes
were suddenly made, the majority of
which were as suddenly lost in March
of 1883, when gold fell seventy-four
points. Many of these deals were
tion of our people to a better state of
living than the people of other coun
tries and a greater self-respect.
England is a greater money power
than the United States, and she might
try to dominate the United States in
case of an alliance based on money,
but I think we are Yankees enough to
drive a good bargain and to take care
of our own interests.
I do not think it unwise to agitate
the question of an alliance, as some
public men have suggested. We are a
courageous people and we don't hesi
tate to speak our minds. I don't believe
much in diplomacy.
I think we ought to hold the Philip
pines and Porto Rico until Spain pays
back what we have spent on this war.
If there is any question about the de
tails of the settlement we ought to call
in the powers and let them deter
mine it.
It is possible we may want to keep
the Philippines if the war is prolonged,
as I believe it will be. If we take pos
session now and establish a government
there we may not want to relinquish
it. But I believe that if the war ends
soon we should merely hold the islands
fraudulent. Edward B. Ketchum's
operations, which were estimated to
have yielded him a profit of over one
million of dollars in less than a year's
time, were of this nature, but their
boldness compels a sort of admiration
by reason of his youth â he was only
25 years of age.
The speculation in gold culminated
in 1569 in widespread ruin. This was
on what is known as Black Friday,
when Jay Gould and Jim Fisk tried
to force it up to two hundred.
Fisk had entered into the venture
on Gould's assurance that President
Grant's brother-in-law, General Por
ter, his private secretary, and Butter
field, the Assistant Secretary of the
Treasury, were to have an interest in
the speculation. Ftsk was aware that
together they could buy all the gold in
New York city, but he feared the hun
dred million in the sub-Treasury, for he
knew an offer from the Government to
sell any part of that would mean their
ruin, as he said: "Our phantom gold
can't stand the real stuff." However,
when he was told that corruption was
to play a part in the speculation, he felt
at home and safe. They prepared for
the struggle by buying the Fifth Na
tional Bank of New York.
On the 23d of September, the day be
fore the bubble broke, Gould and Fisk
had about three hundred thousand dol
lars on deposit there, but their checks
were certified to the amount of eight
millions.
The Government meantime had been
informed of the action of the bank, and
three examiners were sent to New York
to take possession. This was on Fri
day morning; but they permitted the
bank to transact its regular business,
though no mo~e checks were certified
which were not covered by a deposit.
On Wednesday the price of gold had
been 140 H. a rise of 5 cents. This
would have - iven a profit of five mill
ions of dollars to the conspirators had
they chosen to sell, but they held and
Thursday gold reached 150. On Friday
morning it climbed to 160 â and then at
the critical moment came the news
that the Government had opened the
vaults of the sub-Treasury. Instantly
there was a panic: with hardly a rally
gold fell to 133. There was none taken
at any price. "The real stuff" crushed
the corner in a twinkling of an eye.
The report made by the committee of
investigation showed that there were
only fifteen millions of gold certificates
in New York city at the time, yet the
clearings for Thursday were three
as security for a war indemnity or sell
them to some other power. Cuba we
don't want. But when we have driven

hundred anyl twenty-five millions, and
those of Friday would have reached a
cool half billion, if they could ever
have been made.
Fortunes have been made by the
manipulation of war loans; at the be
ginning of the rebellion the national
bond issue, and the stability of the
Government, which made the bonds of
value, were both regarded with doubt.
The loan could not be negotiated
abroad owing to England's secret but
bitter hostility to the North, and to the
mistrust of the Rothschilds. The late
Jay Cooke, a Western banker, under
took the sale of these bonds; he placed
the original 5.20 loan of five hundred
and thirteen millions â as well as sub
sequent loans, which in the aggregate
amounted to over one billion of dollars.
This is said to have been one of the
most remarkable achievements in the
history of the world's finances. His
profits from the undertaking ran up
into the millions, but it was a service
of paramount importance to the United
States.
The placing of the internal revenue
tax â a war measure to increase the in
come of the Government â was not
without its opportunity for aggrandize
ment. Certain grave Senators are said
to have made comfortable fortunes by
peddling what were known as "whisky
tips." These tips â the standard p^-ice
for which seems to have been about
ten thousand dollars â were eagerly
sought by speculators who bought and
stored large quantities of whisky,
knowing it would advance in price the
moment the tax was placed upon it.
One year prior to the war cotton sold
at U% cents a pound in the markets of
the world; two years later it was sell
ing- at 24% cents, this rise, and those
which followed, forcing it up to 65
cents, and affecting the price of all dry
goods.
Having foreseen the ci edition that
war would necessarily create in the
South, A. T. Stewart, New York's great
dry goods merchant, had bought and
stored millions of yards of cotton goods
of all descriptions. In a single year
from this source he realized four mil
lion dollars.
Devlin & Co. of New York, a great
war-time firm of clothiers, profited in
a somewhat similar way. When it was
seen that war was imminent they pur
chased all the cloth they could find in
the market suitable for uniforms, and
not even waiting for the call for troops
began the manufacture of overcoats
and army clothes. They had seventy

five thousand of these packed and
ready for shipment when the Presi
dent's call for men came, and these
uniforms were worn by the first troops
that marched to the front. It was dur
ing the first year of the war that the
word "shoddy" came into use. It was
applied to the worthless garments fur
nished the Government by dishonest
contractors, but after the first year the
giving out of contracts was so well
managed that frauds of this sort be
came well nigh impossible.
It was the rise in the price of cotton
that made blockade running profitable
to English ship owners. The cargoes
were sent out to Bermuda or Nassau
and there transferred to the fast
steamers that were to make the haz
ardous run to some Confederate port.
The profits were so great that a single
successful run would more than pay
for the best steamer afloat and meet
the expenses of the voyage into the
bargain. How it flourished and what
inducements it had to flourish may be
judged from the fact that during the
war the blockading fleet took or de
stroyed more than seven hundred ves
sels engaged in the trade.
It has been said that the purchase of
arms added greatly to the private
means of certain officials. The works
at Springfield, where the army muskets
were made, were unable to meet the
sudden demand, and aeents were sent
abroad to buy rifles from various Eu
ropean po=vnÃts. The aggregate cost of
these muskets exceeded two million
dollars. They were in every way in
ferior to those made at home, and it
was asserted that they were guns
which had been condemned by the
Governments from which they were
purchased.
The moneyed return in war times is
not always in proportion to the actual
value of the service rendered, indeed,
it would seem that the man who stays
quietly at home and allows his neigh
bor to go to the front and do the fight
ing has every chance of becoming a
rich man, while the soldier can only
hope for fame â or a pension.
Perhaps there ia no better illustra
tion of this seeming unfairness than
that offered in the case of Captain
John Ericsson, who invented and built
the famous Monitor which defeated
the Merrimac in Hampton Roads and
forever stayed the rising wave of Con
federate success. He probably received
less from the tovernraent than did
many of the contractors who supplied
caps and shoes for the army.
"Oh, if you don't mind I'd rather
not."
These wars are new. Woman has not
yet found her place in them. If the
Government had not interfered she
would have gone to Manila to nurse
the wounded, to die of fever, to chafe
the man in action, to sadden the man
at ease.
Barred from the field of war she has
cluttered the field of peace. Her pres
ence in the camp has made ducks and
drakes of military discipline. Her pies
and cakes have wrought havoc with
military digestion. Her attentions have
turned the unaccustomed heads of fool
ish youth from big farms and little
towns. Her moneys have been squan
dered in dissipations.
And so sweetly, so generously, so en
tirely, so innocently has she given her
self, heart and soul, to this work of
blessed interference and so much
practical good has gone hand in hand 1
with the evil she has wrought, that
here in her own city, where the nation
has gone into camp, none has had the
heart to turn her out, to spoil her cup
of sweets with one drop of sour; few
5 have had the courage to tell her the
5 truth about herself, to say: "Go home,
( my dear, and do your good work there;
â¢send the fruits of your labors â your
> hats and hoods, your bands and bags,
5 your moneys and many other blessings
5 â to official hands for impartial distri
t bution. There is nothing that you can
, do in the field that men cannot do bet
ter. Your presence is tolerated not
5 desired in the army. You are sweet,
5 you are good, you are devoted, you are
â¢ noble, you are infinitely dear â but you
' are terribly in the way."

Graphic account of the bombardment as seen
in the city by Captain Spray, who
ran the blockade and reached the
Spanish fleet in the harbor*
By R- J- Elliott, Special War Correspondent of The Call.
SPEAKING of the scenes In the city of San Juan during the terrors of the
bombardment, Captain Spray said: "I never saw such a scared lot of
people In my life. Every one was terror stricken. They rushed from
their stores, leaving them unattended and in many instances wide open;
never stopping to close a door, much less to lock it. Women and children
in all stages of deshabille ran screaming from their houses. The streets
were crowded with panic stricken men and women, all intent upon reaching a
point of safety in the hills beyond the town. Shells shrieked over their heads
and buildings came crashing clown, while the shouts of the fleeing populace
drowned the calls for help from the wounded. Even thieves forgot to ply their
vocation and stores were as safe that day with all their valuables exposed as
they would be under lock and key and under guard. The only thought was to
escape from the range of Sampson's guns. Horses and trucks and the few
hacks and volantes of the city were pressed into service by the wealthy, who
paid any price if the drivers would only make good time. Some hackmen re
fused to let their teams at any price, choosing rather to convey their own
families to a place of safety.
"The narrow streets of San Juan were crowded as they had never been be
fore. Teamsters and a struggling, shouting mass of humanity disputed the
right of way in their mad rush for safety. Many rushed to the churches and
within a few minutes after the bombardment began every church was full to
overflowing. Men and women hustled one against the other In their eagerness
to kneel as near the altar as possible. In some churches the mass was being
offered, but the priests cut it short and advised the people that as the stately
churches might be good targets for the American gunners it might be safe to
seek less conspicuous points. A few of the more faithful remained imploring
the saints and the Virgin Mary to protect them.
"The entire populace thought that the city was being purposely bombarded.
As a matter of fact, however, it was not the intention of Sampson's gunners to
reach the town. Their rain of shell was directed against Morro and the
sand batteries beyond. There was a rough sea on and many of the guns were
fired on the up rull of the ships, giving the guns just the elevation to throw
the projections over the Morro and the batteries and into the city."
It is generally supposed that the shells from Sampson's fleet wrought sad
havoc with the sand batteries and Morro fortifications at San Juan, but Cap
tain Spray tells a different story. In all forty-one shots were fired at the
Morro stronghold, and according to Captain Spray not one did serious damage
to the fortifications. This statement is also supported by the first and second
officers of the Roath. They claim that the damage was all done at the bar
racks back of the sand batteries where several hundred Spanish soldiers were
killed and wounded and the barracks demolished and in the city proper, where
nearly every building suffered more or less. He says:
"As I had landed coal for Cervera's fleet I was regarded somewhat in the
light of a hero and was allowed to so wherever I wished. I took a trip over to
the Morro along with my first officer and others from the ship and they can
verify what I say. The Morro was scarcely injured. It was hit by but few
shells and these buried right into the rotten masonry without exploding. The
old fortifications were in such a condition that a few exploding shells would
have made sad havoc, in fact, quite demolished the Morro. The Spaniards
have, however, made active preparations fn r a second attack by protecting the
masonry bo far as possible by embankments. Over at the sand batteries more
shells struck, but only one or two exploded. They burrowed into the soft sand
and stuck there, not receiving a sufficient impact to explode them.
â¢â Just back of the sand batteries are the barracks and here the shells did
their work in good shape. Judging from the demolished condition of the build-
'THE PEOPLE FLED FROM THE HOUSES IN TERROR WHEN THEY REALIZED THOT THE SHELLS FROM THE AMERICAN VESSELS WERE FALLING INTO THE CITY."
Ings and the number of wounded every shell must have exploded the moment
it struck. In many instances the shells went through the windows and open
doors and striking on the hard earth floor exploded doing fearful damage.
Over three hundred Spanish soldiers were wounded and nearly every one of them
got their wounds at the barracks. Of all the buildings not one remained intact
after the bombardment.
'< iver in the city proper where any number of shells fell serious damage was
done. One shell alone killed four persons and wounded more or less seriously
about twenty people. It overturned a volante and broke the arm of one of the
occupant.", while the frightened horses ran up the streets knocking down scores
of people before they were stopped. This was in San Justo street, which at
the moment was crowded with people fleeing for their lives and shouting, some
from terror and others calling to friends at the windows above to join in the
rush to the hills. A shell struck a building sending down a shower of brick
and plastering, glanced and struck a store sign and fell to the street below,
where it exploded.
"' toe rhell pierced the roof of a church and passed on out of the big arched
door to the yard beyond, where it exploded, making sad havoc of the cement
wall of the church. This incident was regarded as one of the miracles of the
bombardment. The church was crowded with people at mass and had not the
Fhell been diverted in its course would have fallen in the midst of the con
gregation, or had it gone a few feet to the right or left it would have struck the
solid wall Instead of passing out at the door.
"The people of San Juan are very wroth that proper notice of the bombard
ment was not served, as such would have saved the needless slaughter of in
r.ocent women and children. When the bombardment began the entire popu
lace took to the housetops and 'balcon' to witness the sight, as they supposed
the fire was to be directed against the forts alone. Soon a shell came scream
ing over the fort high in the air and fell near the center of the city. Another
followed and in two minutes there was a panic in the city. Every one took it
for granted that the Americans intended to destroy the city whether or not they
silenced the forts. After it was all over it then dawned upon the terror
stricken people that the shewing of the town was due solely to bad marksman
ship rather than design.
"The people of San Juan are daily expecting a renewal of hostilities and
:' "I venture to predict that the successful side will be that

THE second naval war within five

inn chines which the Ingenuity of
man has invented for the pur
pose of destroying man are to be
tested in actionâ are actually beingtest
ed while these lines are in the writing.
And not the machines only, but also the
men who handle them. The Latin and
the Anglo-Saxon, so often in conflict in
the past, are meeting once more In bat
tle; and issues the most momentous
hang upon the conduct of the combat
ants. The war between the United
States and Spain is a copy on a very
reduced scale and with some Blight
modifications of a war between Eng
land and France. It is not my purpose 1
In this article to work out a detailed
comparison; I can only suggest it. The
great British superiority in battle-ships
and unarmored cruisers as against
France is faithfully reproduced in the
American navy as against Spain. The
great French advantage in armored
cruisers finds Its parallel in the Spanish
navy. Even in torpedo craft the nu
merical equality which exists between
England and France is repeated with
some correctness In the two combatant
Thus all conditions are favorable to a
trial of our race; upon the conduct of
Admiral Sampson and Commodore
Schley's officers and bluejackets de
pends not merely the honor of the Unit
ed States but the very existence of the
British empire. If the men who are
hourly expecting battle in the Carib
bean falter, if they show any want of
courage or sailorshipâ which God for
bidâthen let us be certain that an at
tack will be delivered upon England by
her enemies, who will conclude, and
not unjustly, that the military quali
ties of the Anglo-Saxon have declined
under the depressing burden of civili
zation. And as this is the greatest
problem to be settled in the war,' so we
shall hope and pray that our race may
emerge with glory from the test.
In yet another curious respect the cir
cumstances of a war between England
and Prance are represented. England,
like the United States*mans her navy
by voluntary enlistment, and has an
exceedingly small trained reserve.
France, like Spain, employs compulsory
service, and has a large reserve. But
here an element of difference comes
in, for whereas the English peace-serv
ice force far outnumbers the French,
the American â without any real re
serve â is greatly outnumbered by *ha

NAVAL PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED
IN THE PRESENT WAR.
"The Latin and the Anglo-Saxon Race, So Often in Conflict in the Past, Are Meeting Once
Mores' in Battle, and Issues the Most Momentous hang Upon the Conduct of the Combatants."
Spanish. There has been much debate
as to the use of untrained men in naval
wars. Great light on this most burning
question should be afforded by the
present struggle, for one-fourth or so of
the men who take the American fleets
to sea must be untrained.
It is not that the untrained man is
necessarily a coward â though disci
pline is a tremendous force to give
courage. But he is not enough of a
machine; he has not learned to repeat
the movements, we will say of the
breech-lever, automatically under the
stress of novel and terrible experiences.
A well-trained sun crew will hold *o-
K'-ther, as the history of our navy
shows, till the men are shot to pulp or
the ship is sunk. But where there are
only one or two trained men in the de
tachment, and these are killed early, as
they may always be, the untrained man
does not know his work and is apt to
be seized with panic. More happens in
naval battles than gets into the books.
At times we catch a dim glimpse,
through the smoke and heat of action,
of miserable fugitives hiding in the
hold, and only driven to the guns by
the flat of the officers' swords.
But it is, after all, upon the construc
tion and value of our war ma
chines that we expect most light
to be shed. Naval science has
been revolutionized since Lissa and
tl^e Civil War; and even then
tlÂ»?*"e were no purely naval actions
worth studying. In the China-Japan
war the conditions were unfavorable
for any striking deductions, as the Jap
anese against the Chinaman was much
M a man against a child in arms, rind
neither side possessed powerful modern
armored ships.
The warship of our own day, be she
battle-ship, monitor, cruiser, or torpe
do boat, is an experimental craft. She
has not had to undergo the prolonged
and severe practical tests which re
moved "freak ships" from our line-o*
battle or navy list in the old three
decker days. The . progress of naval
science during the last fifty years has
been so rapid that the experience ac
quired with one kind of ship in one war
becomes useless in the next, because
the kind of ship has changed. By "ex
perience," I should say, I mean experi
ence in regard to details of construc
tion ar.d tactics. not in regard
strategy, which are
unchanged and un
changing.
The first great
problem to be de
cided is the value
of the battle-ship
"The battle-Bhip as a leading factor in warfare is already <j>
doomed."â ADMIRAL COLOMB. â¢-
against the armored cruiser and of the
large armored against the large unar
mored ship. If put less technically, the
question is this â which is the more val
uable factor, speed, or armor combined
with heavy guns? The battle-ship is
a huge structure, thickly plated with
steel on her most vital parts, carrying
immense guns in heavily armored tur
rets, but is usually of comparatively
low speed. The armored cruiser, on the
other hand, has much less annor â both
in area covered and in thickness of
plating on that area; her heavy guns
are fewer in number and weaker in
power, though in her quick-firing ar
mament she is generally much the
same as the battle-ship. As compensa
tion for these points of weakness she
has a speed of from three to five knots
greater than the battle-ship.
The want of heavy guns in the ar
mored cruiser is not quite so serious as
it might seem. It is perfectly possible
that the battle-ship's monster pieces,
with their ponderous turrets, moved by
hydraulic or electric power, will at an
early stage in the action be disabled.
Hydraulic and electric machinery is
notoriously delicate, and is deranged
with the utmost ease. It is rare for a
battle-ship to go to target practice with
her heavy guns without some slight
hitch occurring. What it would be
when the enemy were tiring at her,
when her pipes and wires were expos
ed, not merely to the concussion and
shock of her own heavy weapons, but
also to the far more dangerous explo
sion of the enemy's projectiles inside
her hull, may be guessed. And though
every precaution which human fore
sight can suggest has been taken to
protect these pipes and wires and the
machinery they work, it is far from
certain that any armor or any protec
tion can secure them against the tre
mendous shock caused by the huge pro
jectiles of modern guns. The Spanish
51-inch breech-loader, as mounted in
several of Spain's armored cruisers,
strikes with a force sufficient to lift
the Indiana two and a half feet in the
air.
At the Yalu there were several break
downs of heavy guns in action, though
there the shooting on either side was
bad and the test was not so severe as
it might be expected to be in a battle
between three or four American battle
ships and the Spanish armored cruisers.
At the bombardment of Alexandria the
firing of the heavy English guns was
intolerably slow â due probably to the
great difficulty of working them in the
face of constant small accidents. And
quite lately, when a charge of powder
prematurely exploded in the turret of
the Russian Sissoi Veliki, it is signifi
cant that the turret was hopelessly
jammed and the turning machinery
disabled, so that half the ship's heavy
armament was put out of action.
Nor can the problem be solved by
peaceable practice from the large ship
at targets, representing torpedo boats,
towed toVard her. We might thus
learn the number of hits her gunners
would make on a boat, if they were
perfectly cool; but there would be no
allowance for the strain caused by the
knowledge of the fact that if they did
not hit the boat before she closed them,
she would send them to the bottom.
Actual war alone can determine the
precise value of the torpedo boat.
The ram has been so entirely discred
ited since the torpedo was perfected
that there is but little prospect of its
being employed. The United States,
however, has one specially" built ram,
the Katahdin, whose performances will
be watched with interest. It is not to
be expected that she will startle the
world. She is a survival of the ideas of
the Civil War, when ramming was a
recognized part of naval tactics. Now
adays a captain would not risk injuring
his ship's bows, but would use his bow
torpedo, which would do the work of
the ram most effectively. The Ameri
cans have other novel weapons â among
these the pneumatic guns, projectors
of aerial torpedoes â more may be ex
pected.
Another matter on which we badly
need information is the practicability
of maintaining a blockade with the
modern engines of naval war. To make
the test thoroughly satisfactory, there
should be torpedo boats in the block
aded port. This condition is wanting
at Havana, and therefore Admiral
Sampson's task has been, up to the time
at which I write, comparatively simple.
His officers and crews have not been
subjected to the cruel moral and phys
ical strain which the possibility of tor
pedo boat attacks imposes. Nor have
they had constantly to look out for the
soiling of a hostile squadron
inside Havana, almost equal in
force to them
selves. This was the
striking feature of
our blockades of

In the great strug
gle with Napoleon.

vessels*
they have made active preparations for it. Repairs have been made and new.
embankments thrown up and several modern guns that had but recently ar
rived are now mounted. Judging from what I saw San Juan to-day is stronger
than it was before the bombardment."
The other officers of the Roath coincide with Captain Spray's statement.
One of them said last night: "With the repairs that have been made, additional
batteries and new guns, San Juan is well fortified, but, of course, not impreg
nable. The army of 8000 men has been more than doubled, while the 3000 volun
teers are being drilled daily. One advantage in an invasion of Porto Rico ia
that the coast line is such that a United States expedition could be landed any
where along the coast, as there are plenty of good harbors. Guanica offers par
ticularly favorable advantages. It is the best harbor in Porto Rico, unguarded
and it lies west of Ponce and south of San Juan. There is an excellent carriage
road all the way from San Guanica into San Juan, and the distance being less
than 100 miles, can be made in a few days' march. While the troops are march
ing from Guanica the fleet could be reducing the forts at San Juan and San
Carlos. The carriage roads all over Porto Rico are in excellent condition and
troops can move easily, the only danger being from exposure to the sun on long
marches. There is no yellow fever in Porto Rico, but the United States troop
ers not being used to the extremely hot weather are likely to wilt under tha
boiling sun.
"In my opinion the Spanish troops in Porto Rico will be found In very dif
ferent condition from those in Cuba. There has been no war in that island and
its resources are consequently unimpaired. The troops have been paid reg-.
ularly, are well clothed, fed and perhaps better armed than in any other sec-.
t;on of the Spanish army. This is due to the fact that according to the Spanish
system of billeting its army on its dependencies the revenues of Porto Rico hava
been ample to pay the soldiers billeted upon the island, whereas in Cuba a verjn
different state of affairs has existed for the past two years. All kinds of food
supplies are abundant and anywhere on the island troops will find plenty of
water, for Porto Rico is particularly favored with a water supply. The rainy
season does not begin until August and it only lasts a few weeks. There are na
swamp lands as in Cuba. Taken altogether Porto Rico is about the most healthjr
island in all the West Indies.
"When I left San Juan there were in the harbor the gunboats Ponce de Leon.
Isabella Secunda, Comacha, Alfonso XIII, the Terror, the Manual and two
cargo boats. Of these first three were doing scouting duty off the harbor
watching for the return of the American fleet.
"I had a number of strange adventures in San Juan one night I was onL
shore with my second mate. We got over to a strange street. Some ona
shouted 'Americanos! Americanos, Infernio!' Some one had mistaken us for
Americans and had raised the cry. In less time than we take tell it we were
surrounded by a crowd of shouting peons. To this day it is a mystery to mo
where they all came from so quickly. Things were looking serious. I did not
know just what to do.
I started to explain, but the crowd would not have it so. They threatened
an attack at any moment, when I happened to look up to a 'balcon* only a few
feet above me. A number of ladies had been attracted to the window, for ia
ban Juan as in all Spanish towns, the best families occupy the second story aa
their living rooms. Among- the number I recognized a lady whom I had met at
a reception a few evenings before. I called to her and she identified me, ex
plaining to the mob who I was. She sent a peon along to guide us back to tha
ship After that I was careful about getting into the side streets by day or
r.ight unless I had some one well known in the city along.
"While in port we suffered considerably from the heat and to make it as com
fortable as possible on the ship we kept every port hole wide open, but this one
day came near being our destruction. The Roath was lying close to the Isabella
Secunda, as we had been putting coal on board of her. One afternoon a shell
on the Isabella accidentally rolled overboard, striking a plank it bounced over
and into a port hole of the Roath and down into the hold, where it exploded.
My, but how the coal flew for a few seconds. Luckily, the men had a few mlnÂ«.
utes before left work to clean up or some of them would have been injured, if
not killed. I thought that the whole deck was going up. It took the ship'a*
carpenters four days to repair the damages."
It was not until Captain Spray left San Juan that he had his most thrilling,
experience. He left the port about 10 o'clock at night and had not been at sea*,
more than three or four hours when of a sudden there came a blank shot, the
signal to "lay to."
Captain Spray obeyed at once, but within a few minutes there came an
other shot, this time a shell, another followed and each time the gunner was
getting the range closer and closer. Captain Spray and his crew thought that
their time had come. The next shell passed within two feet of the funnels'
when Captain Spray concluded to "bout ship," then the firing ceased.
A few minutes later the Amphitrite came along side and explanations fol
lowed. The Roath was in ballast and "riding high" so that her white propellers'
showed just above the water. The officer of the Amphitrite had mistaken tha^
tips of the white propellers for foam and therefore thought that the RoathÂ»
was coming toward him at full speed and not until she swung around did he.
discover the mistake. The Amphitrite officer thought that a Spanish battleshij> (
was after him sure. In the dim dawn the Roath's galley looked like a turret j
and the copper plate bearing the maker's name was mistaken for a cannon'si
mouth.
Paulina, the beautiful daughter of Governor General Maclas, according to:
Captain Spray, is the heroine of San Juan. After the bombardment the Gov
ernor General, anticipating an early resumption of hostilities, sent his family
into the interior. The mother, accompaned by five daughters, left San Juan thÂ©
day following the bombardment, but Paulina, the General's favorite daughter,
refused to go with the family. She said that she would stay by her father to
care for him in case he should be wounded.
Captain Spray said: "The action of Miss Paulina has been loudly praised
by every one in San Juan. They all regard itas a noble sacrifice on her part, as
the troubles of General Macias are telling on him. When he came to Porto Rico
a few years ago his hair was a dark brown, to-day it is snow white. Constant
fear of a revolution and now the war has told on him. The words of Paulina,
'where father dies I die,' have become a sort of watchword in San Juan."

It is not surprising to learn that cap
tains lost health and nerve, or went
crazy under such a burden. In British
maneuvers a week or ten days of block
ade under modern conditions has suf
ficed to show that the burden has
grown heavier and not lighter.
Connected with this subject is the
trial of the sea-keeping qualities of our
new ships, which this struggle will im
pose. The engines and 1 oilers of the
battle-ship or cruiser are lighter and
weaker than those of the merchant
ship, knot for knot, since weight is a
most important consideration. In time
of peace the warship rarely steams
faster than 10 or 12 knots, at which
pace her machinery may perform well
enough. But in war time she may
have to steam continuously for days at
her very utmost speed; or, if in com
pany with a fleet, she may have now
to run at top speed, now to stop, now
to go astern, when the strain becomes
tremendous, American ships are well
boilered, and should stand this kind of
work as well as any. Where they are
perhaps weak is in the number of
tricky engines and "dodges" that they
carry. Hand-worked ammunition
hoists are preferred in the British navy
for moderate sized guns,
ed with the greatest interest.
As war grows more terrible, more
devilish, it would seem that the loss of
life diminishes. Deadly as the new
weapons are, they have so great a
moral effect in the fighting man that
they prevent the close actions which,
were so bloody in the old day's. I have
in "Ironclads in Action" compared tha
loss of life and limb in six of the great
est battles, and it stands thus: Yalu
15% per cent, Lissa 4, Trafalgar about
20, the Nile 20, Camperdown 13, and the
First of June 15%. In the old battles
men were not infrequently Injured or
killed by the recoil of their own guns
This feature was faithfully reproduced
at the Yalu, where no less than ten
Japaneseâ according to Dr. Suzuki's
reportâ died from "the vibration of air
caused by the firing of their own guns."
This in the modern ship is a new and.
most potent cause of mischief. In a
British battle-ship I have seen a six
pounder gun severely injured by the
blast of a 10-inch weaponâ and had
there been men quartered at it they
would have been killed. We know that,
at the trials of the Indiana, it was re
ported that her irreat 13-inch turret
guns, if trained at their extreme angle,
would have killed all the men at the
six-inch gun, past which they fired.
We know, too, that in certain French
ships the men have to be recalled from
the lighter guns before the heavy weap
ons can be fired In certain directions.

Mr. Hooley, in this apparently vain

the greatest historical estates in Eng
land, of the Prince of Wales' former
yacht Britannia, of the Earl of Lons
dale's schooner yacht Verita, of the for
mer Travelers' Club in London, and
ex-owner of untold millions in stocks
and bonds and good, hard, glittering
gold.
Only last November Honloy volun
teered to float a loan of Â£17,000,000 for
the Spanish Government. Meanwhile
he had been engaged for some time in
floating a loan of even greater magni
tude for the Celestial empire.
People even then shook their heads
and said that he was in deep water.
The capitals of the companies floated
by him aggregate from sixty to sixty
five millions of dollars. The Bhares of
these companies, taken as a whole, had
depreciated more than 40 per cent since
their flotation. To-day the inevitable
lias happened. Mr. Hooley is a bank
rupt.
There la hardly any more sensational
chapter In financial history than Mr.
Hooley's rise from nothing into opu
lence and his decline back from opu
lence to possible nothing.
Not even Barney Barnato offers an
effective parallel. Fact must yield to
fiction in the hunt for a comparison.
Aladdin of the Eastern fairy tales is the
closest approximation to Hooley"s* his
tory.
Hooley, indeed, seemed to have pos
session of Aladdii.s famous lamp. What
he wished was instantly captured out
of chaos into reality. He not only ac
quired for himself lordly pleasure
houses in town and country but also
every pleasure house that his eye fell
upon, no matter how splendid the name
â with which it had been associated. Had
any evil genius suggested to him that
he needed a roc's egg as the capstone
and climax of his wishes that evil gen
ius would have been baffled by the in-
Btant acquisition of the biggest roc's
effg in the universe.
And to-day he is a bankrupt!
Mr. Hooley is a comparatively young
Jnan. still on the sunny side of 40. He
was born in Derbyshire some thirty
nine years ago. Since he was four
years of age he has resided in Ilking
ton.
"That is why," he explained to a re
porter, "I wish to represent it in Par
liament. I left school when I was 13
years old, and when I was at school I
had to walk eight miles a day. I be
gan life early, but I was born under a
lucky star, though I have seen as much
misery and poverty as any man liv
ing," and he closed with the altruistic
sentiment that his own aim in future
would be "to lighten poverty if I can."
Discovering poverty in China and in
Bpain. was it with this aim that he
bent his energies to abolish it? But do
not let us trifle at the expense of a
noble-hearted man, who has himself
told us that although in the abstract he
is fond of sport, the mere sight of a
broken winged bird or a maimed rabbit
briCtgs tears to his eyes and a bleeding
pali to his heart.
"mis noble altruist first became
kntfwn to his native country as a suc
cessful lace manufacturer at Nottlng
haiA But pent up Nottingham proved
too â¢g.rrow to confine his powers.
Havinf achieved a respectable com
petency *'hich he himself looked upon
with scatff respect, his next move was
naturally W Capel Court, the London
Wall street.
This was only a couple of years ago.
He now made the whole boundless con
tinent his field of operation. The first
of his schemes to startle the world was
the purchase of the Dunlop Pneumatic
Tire Company for $20,000,000.
This gigantic scheme was noated by
means of a syndicate. Having first
learned that the Dunlop Company was
billing to sell, Hooley obtained an op
tion for $10,000,000 for one week. Then
he bent all his energies to communi
cate to his friends, acquaintances and
associates the fact that the Dunlop
Company was in the market. The re
sult was that in two days Hooley was
enabled to exercise his option. He
purchased the property for the stipu
lated $10,000,000. and on the third day
unloaded it upon the said friends,
acquaintances and associates for
double the amount. The neat way in
which he netted a profit of $10,000,000
without stirring from his chair even so
far as tv put his hands in his pocket
for a single shilling might seem to in
dicate that he had made monkeys of
these more or less intimate sharers of
his ample bosom. â¢
Not a bit of it! They, too, profited
by the deal to such an extent that they
had every reason to rise up and call
him blessed.
Then came the Bovrll Company deal.
Every American housewife associates
the name of Bovril with a beef extract
that has been enormously advertised
as one of the greatest boons to suffer
ing humanity. Hooley's tender heart,
the same that bled for birds and rai>
bits, felt so deeply concerned in thÂ«
welfare of suffering humanity that he
exploited the Bovril extracts in exactly
the same way he had expected the
pneumatic tire.
And again his friends, associate's and
acquaintances, who put big profits Into
his own pocket, had reason to bless
htm for that they found their pockets
simultaneously dilated.
That much suffering was likewise
alleviated in dyspeptic stomachs
caused the good man's cup of Joy to
overflow.
Again Hooley turned his attention to
the bicycle. That most deserving ob
ject was now clamoring with a loud
voice for tubes. Cycle manufacturers
found themselves at a loss for sufficient
tubing to meet the demand. Hooley
was the man for the occasion.
"Go to Coventry," he said to his
agent, "and buy up all the tubes you
can."
Coventry, It may be said in passing,
was the great center of the tube in
dustry. Coventry nobly responded to
the agent's request as far as It could.
But Coventry unassisted was still an
inadequate center. Mr. Hooley fur
nished the requisite assistance. The
British public awoke one morning to
find itself solicited to invest three mil
lions in the Swedish Tube Company, to
be established at Coventry for the pur
pose of filling the orders secured by
Hooley's apremt. The British public re
sponded by golden promise and per
formance. The money was sub ~ribed
for ten times over. A new factory was
built, all orders were filled, Hooley
netted a round million and again his
associates we rewarded for their
prompt response, he factory still yields
a satisfactory return to all Investors.
And now it appeared that Aladdin's
lamp was of inexhaustless potentialities.
Its possessor became the man of the

hour. His name was on every one's
lips. London went wild at its mere
mention in connection with any new
financial scheme.
But Aladdin's energies were now tem
porarily diverted from -Ã¼blic to private
enterprises. The benefactor of a con
tinent made personal aggrandizement
his immediate object. He secured fa
mous yachts, like the Prince of Wales'
Britannia, ana the Earl of Lonsdale's
Verena. He invested in equally famous
race horses. He purchased magnificent
historic estates which were falling to
decay in the hands of spendthrift heirs.
In a short time he had become master
of a palace in Berkeley Square and
country seats like Risley and Pap
worth halls. He leased the big building
at the corner of Regent street and Pall
Mall, formerly the Traveler's Club, with
the intention of turning it into offices.
He became a member of numerous
yacht clubs. He associated with the
Prince of Wales and other great and
good men.
The advent of Queen Victoria's jubi
lee gave him a longed-for chance to re
turn to philanthropy.
In January, 1897, the Prince of Wales
publicly announced that the Queen
would be pleased to have her anniver
sary made an occasion for endowing
new charities and enriching those al
ready endowed. Hooley's scarred heart
leaped within his bosom at this sug
gestion. Incidentally he saw a chance
to realize his pet ambition of repre
senting his native county in Parlia
ment. But that, of course, was merely
incidentally.
He straightway notified the local au
thorities that he had set aside Â£400,000
to be invested in the hands of trustees,
who were to expend the income in bet
tering the condition of the poor, the
aged, the widowed and the orphaned
in his own corner of Derbyshire.
These figures may sound more august
when the intelligent reader is reminded
that Â£400,000 is about two millions of
dollars in American money. The yearly
income of this enormous sum would
be Â£75,000, or $355,000.
A unique system was organized for
the proper expenditure of this. income.
Every town of 10,000 inhabitants was
to receive a sum of $5000 a year, every
village of 3000 a sum of $1500. But tho
fund was not to be expended in actual
money payments to the beneficiaries.
Accounts were to be opened with the
various storekeepers, upon whom or
ders were to be given by the local com
mittees after careful consideration of
the necessities of the epplicants.
Early in February of last year Mr.
Hooley discovered that St. Paul's Ca
thedral possessed no sacramental plate
worthy of its position as the metropol
itan church of the United Kingdom.
This discovery inflicted a new wound
upon his sensitive heart. He deter
mined to supply the omission. At im
mense cost he procured and presented
to the church a magnificent service of
pure gold. A fierce wall was uttered
by outraged evangelical England.
From end to end of the country went
up a complaint against the cathedral
authorities for having been "so little
mindful of the dignity of St. Paul's"
as to accept such a gift from a man of
the class and standing of Hooley. Some
of the great London dailies, the quint
essence alike of conventional respecta
bility and of conventional humbug, went
so far as to ridicule the plate by de
scribing it as the "Hooley communion
service."
But Hooley, a consummate humbug
himself, knew how to value at its just
worth the concentrated humbug of the
great London dailies. He succeeded in
forcing upon the church authorities the
splendid gift which the snobs of the
press would fain have them reject.
For Hooley was a friend of the Prince
of Wales!
Once in the pages of a now defunct
magazine, Mr. Hooley volunteered to
reveal the secret of his success in busi
ness. All the world stood expectant
of important revelations. But when
the interview appeared it proved to be
simply a rehash of conventional hum
bug. The net meaning might be re-

solved into the Poor Richard maxim
that early to bed makes a man healthy,
wealthy and wise.
At the time the interview appeared
Mr. Hooley had undoubtedly achieved
these three requisites of conventional
comfort. Exactly how they would
square with his present predicament
must be left to the future to deter
mine.
This great man has his weaknesses.
Among this is a passion for three
penny bits with holes in them. It
would take a more subtle psychologist
than myself to explain the why and
wherefore of this superstition. The
fact remains that he has had out a
standing order to the managers of such
banks as he dealt with for all the mu
tilated three-penny pieces which hap
pen to fall in their way. Nevertheless,
he has the frugal mind which Cowper
has celebrated in the notorious case of
Mrs. Gilpin. He pays no premiums on
holes. He takes th^'m at the market
value for whole three-penny bits. Why
he should have a passir.n for such mu
tilated currency has never been re
vealed. But it has been dimly inti
mated that at one time in his career a
three-penny bit with a hole in it proved
the turning point in his fortune.
Just before the beginning or our war
with Spain Hooley had entered into
what was the most gigantic speculation
of his whole career. This was the form-
Ing of an enormous syndicate for the
purchase of Cuba. The capital of this
syndicate was to be some two hundred
millions. It is even asserted that this
sum had all been subscribed and that
the proceedings had reached the point
of negotiations with the Government
officials of Spain. They favored the
proposition, and would have carried it
through had they not feared a popular
uprising in Spain. Large sums are said
to have been spent in bribery, but with*
no substantial result.
And now Mr. Hooley has gone to Join
the great army of speculators in the
past, whose names are only useful to
point a moral ami adorn a tale. He
will be remembered with John Law and
Barney Barnato and others of that ilk
as one of the men who made an ex
traordinary though transitory impres
sion upon the British public. No one
credi.s men of this type with altruistic
yearnings, or, indeed, supposes that
they are actuated by any more ideal
motive than the very common one of
striving to do the best they can for
themselves. But it is none the less a
mistake to suggest that they are merely
parasites of society contributing noth
ing to the welfare of their race.
IN AMERlCAâ Specufator Leiter Tries to Comer the
Wheat of the Worfd.
TOSEPH LEITER is no longer
I king of wheat, and the country in
â â I general as well as those who have
II been defeated by him in his opera
tions breathe more freely. His
fall was rapid. It was but a few days
ago that his defeat was reported, and
within twenty-four hours the defeat be
came an utter rout.
And it must add poignantly to his
chagrin that Philip D. Armour, the bit
ter enemy and rival in business of
himself and his father, was the man
who stepped in, and. in apparent pity,
agreed to take 3,500,000 bushels of Lei
ter's wheat and dispose of it for the
benefit of the young man who so lately
ruled as king of the wheat pit.
Late dispatches from Chicago tell
also that Armour is willing to handle
all the wheat held by the banks. With
in the past two days fully 10.000,000
bushels of wheat have been disposed of,
and Leiter's wheat, held in store in
enormous quantities at Minneapolis
and Duluth and in transit across the
Atlantic, has changed hands. The
wheat king is dethroned.
The erstwhile king is not only desert
ed by his friends but his own father
has had a bitter quarrel with him, tell
ing him that it was his careless ways
of life and his lack of close attention to
business that brought about the giant
collapse. It needed but this in addition
to the triumph of his great enemy, Ar
mour, to fill the cup of young Leiter's
humiliation to the brim.
Leiter's easy and gay habits away
from his office have been the subject of
knowing comment among his acquaint
ances. The young man who in a piain
little office, sat at his desk in a chair
tilted forward by having its front legs
shortened, and there, while literally
sunk down to his ears with his work
before him, planned and directed
schemes of Napoleonic daring was an
other being when he left the office be
hind him. His father has long known
of this and chose to overlook it. Now
he realizes that it played an important
part in the huge collapse that has taken
The biow has had little effect on the
markets, and this is an additional hu
miliation to the young king, who
thought that when he should fall many
must fall with him. Only a few firms
here and there have suffered. The
wheat market has been but little ef-
In Liverpool there was a slight panic,
but the market soon steadied. Leiter's
loss is estimated at nearly $6,000,000,
but his si >iking has made but few rip
ples on the pond. Most of this big loss
represents profits made in the first rise
of wheat. When his troubles are set
tled it is roughly figured out that his
net losses will be between $1,000,000 and
$2,000,000. The market is firmer, and
all over the United States there is a
feeling of Joy. And young Leiter, true
to his strange character, is himself
cheerful. It is believed in Chicago that
the creditors will lose little or nothing,
as L. Z. Leiter, the young man's father,
gave his personal security in most of
the deals. It is not expected that an
actual assignment will be made.
Charges are made that owing to the
faint-heartedness of men whom he had
associated with him in his speculation
the crash came, but there is noth
ing more in this than that men would
not stand by Leiter to their own loss
after they saw that the crash was im
minent. Overbuying and overstaying
are declared to be the causes of the
downfall.
Had Joseph Leiter been content to be
a wheat speculator, and to give his at
tention to it, he would still have been
a financial king. But he spent, in the
company of women, time that ought to
have been spent in work. And, puffed
up by his phenomenal success in one
field of speculation, he entered into
wide dealings in stocks of various
of various kinds. The strain of such
varied and complex speculation was
too much for him. This fellow, the
noise of whose downfall was echoed
around the world, affecting the markets
of cities thousands of miles away,
thought that he could take up business
as a brilliant and gainful pastime.
It was scarcely more than a year ago
that Joseph Leiter, who is now only
30 years old, began his phenomenal
career. Before that, he had been deem
ed only a young man of ordinary abil
ity and qualities. He had been given
a college education. He was handsome,
of snlendid a trifle over six
feet in height and of great physical
strength. His hair was parted in the
middle. He wore the finest clothes
He loved horses, yachting and gayety
He is a gay fatalist. He believes"that
if a man is meant by providence to suc
ceed he must succeed, and if the peo
ple are meant to suffer from the high
price of bread they must suffer. Now
when disaster has overtaken him he
still keeps up a bold front, and says
that it is a mere happening that could
not be avoided, and he merely awaits
a new opportunity to test his fate with
fortune.
Shortly after leaving college he was
given $1,000,000 by his father to play
with. His father expected him to lose
it, and, indeed, he did lose most of it
But he gained knowledge. Unsuspected
he studied the details of street railroad
ing and mining. He learned the cost
of operative electricity and how to
know a salted mine from the genuine
He still laughed and danced and kept
up the gay round of pleasure, but he
also learned hard facts and human
nature. He began to win before he had
lost the full million, and after a while
had more than recouped his losses.
His facial characteristics well typify
his mixed character. His eyes can be
very gentle, but his enemies see them
burn with stern fire. His nose is long
and strong, but there is a sensuous
broadening at the lower end of the nos
trils. His lips, that at first sight seem
only made for smiling, can tighten in
firm lines.
His chin is broad and determined,
but it has an unmistakable doubling,
that comes from high living and the
indulgence of passion and appetite. In
these dual characteristics lie the secrets
of his rise and of his downfall.
Leiter's victories continued. He was
more than a Chicago wheat dealer. He
was a man who watched the crops and
the fluctuations of the market in every
part of the world, and his opponents
found that he had made heavy Euro
pean contracts, to sell, long before he
began to buy.
He is a man of curious opposites, and
who prides himrelf on attention to
small details. Visitors to his office are
compelled to take their turn, and the
other day a man who. as Leiter knew,
wanted to rent from him some property
for $10,000 a year, was compelled to wait
until a man with a basketful of rare
fish had shown his goods and made his
sale.
At another time his broker called him
up on the telephone to tell him that a
deal v.as in sight, and that it
could not wait a moment.
"It's got to wait," said Leiter coolly,
and rang off to go back to the man with
whom he had been talking. It was one
of his tenants, and the matter in ques
tion was whether or not a new sink
was needed in the house. That mo
mentous affair settled Leiter called up
PETS OF THE
SOLDIERS AND SAILORS.
OUR boys in blue are not alone in
their desire to possess regimental
pets, or, as many prefer to call
them, mascots. Boys in red or
green or any other color, all the
world over, have the same fancyâ the
Russian in Siberia, the Frenchman in
Algiers, the Englishman in India,
share this fondness for and belief in the
benign influence of dumb animals. In
the English army nearly every regi
ment has its pet, and 1 in many in
stances the practice is of such long
standing that it has received a sort of
semi-official sanction, and the animals
may be considered as carried on the
books of the regiment.
At Edinburgh Castle, in a charm
ingly picturesque corner of the old
ramparts, there Is even a graveyard
# for soldiers' pets. There, embowered
amid carefully tended shrubs and flow
ers, may be seen dozens of little tomb
stones, bearing pathetic inscriptions
such as this: "In memory of Pet, who
followed the Seventy-second Highland
ers in peace and war for ten years";
or, "In memory of Kate, the drum
mer's pet, Ninety-second Gordon High
landers."
The name of nearly every famous
Scotch regiment, from the heroes of the
"thin red line" to the recent victors at
Darghai and Atbara, are to be found
there, for the brave man has always
a tender corner in his heart for dumb
companions.
One of the oldest and best-known
of regimental pets is the goat of the
Welsh Fusileers. No transport officer
would dare to refuse ship room for this
sacred animal; no officer could lead the
regiment into action unless the goat
were also at its head. For more than
two centuries, ever since the regiment
was embodied In 1689, the goat has been
its fetish, Its symbol, or, if you liko,
its mascot. Of course it has not al
ways been the same animal â even goats
must die some dayâ but the regiment
has always replaced Its pet at once.
In the present day, the Welsh Fusi
leers are particularly fortunate because
of the interest taken by the Queen in
their pet. In 1844, when the goat of
the day passed away, her Majesty
heard of the disaster. She immediate
ly presented the regiment with two of
the finest goats from the royaj flock.
These were of the famous Persian
breed, a gift from the Shah of Persia.
Since then, whenever necessary, the
supply of goat has been renewed.
Pretty nearly every country in the
world has seen the elsh Fusileers and
their famous leader. He has even been
in America, but there the mascot theory
did not seem to work. For some rea
son, not unconnected with revolution
ary skill in marksmanship, its tradi
tional luck deserted the regiment at
Bunker's Hill. Every officer save one
his broker and arranged for the $200,000
deal.
"Now is the time to sell May wheat.
Don't breathe a word; but Joe says so."
The "Joe" referred to was Joseph
Leiter. and the speaker was Nina Far
rington, once a star of the burlesque
stage. K.he was one of Leiter's gay
friends, and he told her enough of his
plans one day last February t~, put her
in tha way of making a large sum. She
is turn wanted to tell her chorus girl
friends in Ne-.v York and so wrote to
Jeannette St. Clair, saying:
"I am having a jolly time here in
Chicago, and am better off than when
I was on the stage. Now, let me tell
you in confidence to buy May wheat.
Dc-nt till I telegraph you, and if you
follow my advice you will make enough
to buy a new spring bonnet."
A few days later she wired to Jean
nette to ca.l her up on the long-dis
tance telephone, and then told her what
"Joe" had advised. "Joe" did not ex
pect that his secret would be passed
about, but it filtered out to many, and
dealers heard of it.
As a result he lost $175,000 on that
deal alone. His friends hint that by
many similar indiscretions he lost other
great amounts.
In his year of brilliant speculation
Leiter is credited with having cleared
over $6,000,000, and now in less than two
days he has lost more than that.
That under the fever of prices that
accompanied his speculations the price
of wheat went up and the price of
bread followed, and that the poor all
over this country cursed him was noth
ing to him. He merely laughed again,
and said that he must really start on
that long yachting trip. He defied
public opinion, and said that he knew
he was acting within his rights and the
law.
was placed hors.de combat, and as Fen
imore Cooper remarks in his novel,
"Lionel Lincoln," the regiment did not
have enough men left to saddle its goat.
This reference to saddling the goat
refers to one of the many queer cus
toms associated with the animal. They
were hard drinking days; the mess
dinners of our forefathers were orgies
fitted to try the strongest head, and it
was but natural that the officers should
wish the regimental pet to share in
their hilarity. On the Ist of March of
every year, being the day of the tute
lary Welsh saint. David, a banquet of
special magnificence was given. When
the fun was at its height, the goat
splendidly caparisoned was led into the
mess, mounted by a drummer boy, and
solemnly ridden three times round the
tables, amid the cheers of the hilarious
officers. Unfortunately, when the reg
iment was at' Boston in 1775 the goat
took alarm at the uproar and prac
ticed bucking so successfully that the
unfortunate little boy riding him was
thrown violently to the floor and killed.
Another regiment which has adopted
the goat is the Ninety-fifth Derbyshire.
The corps secured its pet in the most
dramatic fashion. It was in the height
of the Indian, mutiny, and a severe fight
was going on in the streets of Kotah,
from which cfty the black rebels were
being expelled at the point of the bay
onet. During a lull in the action, one
of the soldiers observed a magnificent
ram of the famous Rajpootana fighting
breed calmly gTazing in a vacant com
peund. So the regiment carried off the
ram with them, and Derby, as he was
called, took most kindly to a soldier's
life. Every action saw him well to
the front. He marched three thousand
miles with his regiment and assisted in
nearly ever- fight of that blood-stained
campaign.
Cavalry regiments, for obvious rea
sons, naturally take to horses as their
pets. The Royal Irish Hussars for a
long time had a famous drum horse
called Black Bob, which served with

the email boa's, railings, furniture and everything else that may furnish what the sailorman In action most dreads, "splin
ter?." In the recent action at Manila some of the apprentices carried this practice to the extent of throwing overboard
their sea chests and the stools and tables used at mess. When the battle was over they had to eat their meals sitting
Turkish fashion about the rm-ssroom. About the only ornaments on a battle-ship in action are her big guns frowning
from the turrets. Aside from them, the decks are swept as clear as possible of everything else. Heavy cable chains and
sacks of cn.'il or sand are sometimes placed about some spot that is deemed in need of protection. "Splinter nets" are some
times spread also, as was done on the deck of the Olympia at Manila.

and without provisions of food and

limitless burning waste.
A high wHll. 285 by 305 feet, incloses
the prison yard. The wall has a height
of 16 feet, and it is 8 feÂ»-t thick at the
base and 5 feet thick at the top. With
in it are the main prison buildings and
the shops. The prison building is solid
ly constructed of rock laid on mortar,
and in the center of all the walls is in
serted a heavy Iron grating. A similar
grating is laid In the masonry above
and below each cell, so that upon tha
completion of the whole prison build
ing, of which only a portion has been
finished, it will have an enormous skel
eton of iron, which will serve as an ef
fectual bar to a convict's escape even
were he to dig through the massive
stone wall. Adjoining and connected
with the prison are a large, airy dining
room, a kitchen and a laundry. In spite
of the terrific heat of the climate, these
buildings are remarkable for their com
parative coolness.
Everyone who goes to see the Terri
torial penitentiary is interested in the
Gatling guns which are placed on the
guard stands arranged at Intervals
along the top of the walls. The largest
and principal gun is in charge of a
young Mexican, who boasts of his
Apache blood. He is rated as the best
marksman with a Gatling gun in the
T'nlted States. General McCook of the
United States army says that his ma
nipulation of the complicated weapon
and his accuracy of aim are simply
marvelous. The young Mexican has an
excellent field for target practice over
the Gila mud flats, just above the pris
on. A tin can six inches in diameter,
placed at a distance of 700 yards, he
will hit four times out of five with a
Gatling gun. When it is remembered
that he can fire 500 shots a minute, the

possibility of a convict's escape is too
small to calculate.
A recent test of the marksmanship of
this young Apache gunner was made.
Fr^m behind a stone wall 100 tin cans
of the Fize of common fruit cans were
thrown one at a time haphazard in the
air, just as clay pigeons are automati
cally thrown at shooting matches. The
Apache had his gun ready and had to
aim as quick as a Hash at each can at
a distance of 150 yards. He pierced 37
out of the 100 before 'they fell behind
the stone inelosure.
The average number of convicts in
the prison is 130. Seventeen of the
prisoners there are in for life. They are
murderers, railroad wreckers and
highwaymen. The comfort of a prls
oner in Yuma depends much on the
money he or his friends have. If he is
poor and has no friends of means or in
fluence, he has only the cheap but
wholesome prison fare, and must oc
cupy at night one of the stone cells
within the buildings. For a few weeks
in winter these cells are quite com
fortable, but in the summer months or
when a parching wind Is blowing off
the hot desert they are like Turkish
bath rooms.
"Try to think how you would feel
if you were night after night locked in
a close, narrow cell, with only a small
opening for fresh air and with the tem
perature ranging from 95 to 100 de
grees," said a discouraged convict from
Yuma prison, in telling of the way the
moneyless prisoners live there. "I have
known many nights in midsummer
when the temperature in the cells was
about 105 degrees, and with the natural
dampness of the cplls and not a breath
of air stirring, you can imagine what
the poor convicts suffer. The fellows
lie on their bunks, stripped naked, and
pant like lizards for enough air to
breathe. Often the temperature at
night keeps at about 95 degrees for
several weeks at a time, and near the
â 00CCC0000O0003000
the wharf, so that a stiff climb up a
rickety accommodation ladder is neces
sary before her deck can be reached.
It is only from this altitude that her
vast dimensions can. be properly ap
preciated. From below you see noth
ing but a great expanse of side, painted
a dull and uninteresting leaden color.
But once you have gained the deck you
find before you a vast expanse of pine
planking, almost unincumbered with
houses or other obstructions. There is
of course a deckhouse forward for the
crew, and the usual spacious cabin aft,
105 degree mark for a week or ten days
at a stretch.
"Think what suffering that must be
to the poor convicts who work daily in
summer in a temperature that ranges
from HO degrees to 122 degrees, fol
lowed at night by the terrific heat 1
have told you about. Everyone of the
prisoners who have to stay in the cells
at night comes out from his kennel like
sleeping place in the morning reeking
with perspiration and weak. Sleep is
only had in brief doses. The doctors
say that anyone who has any blood
taint or the least susceptibility to con
sumption soon contracts the disease
there. Deaths from consumption are
common among the moneyless prison
ers in Yuma Penitentiary. Every sum
mer there are a few convicts who man
age to commit suicide in their steam
ing, noisome colls rather than to en
dure the agony of life there. Two years
;igo a fellow who robbed the Wells-Far
go stage at (irants Pass committed sui
cide there by biting at his wrist and
tearing open the arteries with his
teeth."
But the convicts who have means
or Influential friends can have
as varied and tempting food as they
care to buy from the prison cook. Some
prisoners pay for special cuts of hams,
have fresh fish brought for them, and
even pay the cooks for occasionally
providing fowl for them at the regular
meals. Then too, for a bonus, and
with bonds that they will not escape
from the prison they may have cots
to sleep on in the yard of the peniten
tiary. For eleven months In the year
there is no rain in Yuma, and one may
sleep comfortably out under the starry
vault of heaven about 350 nights In the
year. A few prisoners sleep out of
doors all the time.
Some of the most exciting and san
guinary scents ever enacted in any
penal institution have been inside the
walla of the Yuma Prison. In one of
these efforts to gain their freedom, in
000000000000000000
but these things take up so little room
as to be hardly noticeable. From stem
to stern the ship measures 311 feet,
While her beam is 49 feet. She claims
the proud privilege of being the larg
est wooden ship in the world: and, in
deed, there are only a few iron ships
larger, chief among these being the
France, a Glasgow built vessel owned
in France, which measures nearly four
thousand tons. The Roanoke is 3589
gross tonnage, so there is not a great
deal of difference, after all.
The people of San Francisco have
seen the Roanoke before; since she was
built some six years ago she has paid
a couple of visits to this port. Also
the famous ship Phonandoah, which
recently attained distinction through
not being captured by the Spaniards.
The two vessels are almost sister ships.
They have the same breath and the
same depth, but an extra length of
some twenty feet glv<^s the Roanoke an
additional two hundred tons. They
are rigged modern fashion, as four
masted barks, and from keelson to
to truck the spars of the Roanoke
tower to a height of 175 feet. With all
s.all set she spreads 17,000 yards of can
vas, and can make, under the most
favorable conditions, with a good
brtfze on her quarter, fourteen knots
an hour. The lower yards, and there
are three of them, are huge spars nine
ty-five feet in length, so that it is e.isy
to understand the great propelling
pcwer of this mass of canvas.
A melancholy interest attaches to the
Roanoke, because she is the last of her
class. She is the largest, and one of
the finest wooden sailing ships ever
built, but no American shipbuilder is
likely to repeat the order. Even the
enterprising firm at Bath, Me., which
built and own the Shenandoah and
Roanoke, have abandoned the con
struction of wooden vessels, and aro
likely in the future to use only iron
and steel in their work. Economic
considerations have sounded the doom
of the wooden ship, and for the matter
of that the day of the sailing ships is
not for long. The tramp steamer, with
her smoothly running engines and
light coal consumption, is rapidly driv
ing her from the seas. Only a few
long voyage trades, such as the trip
from San Francisco to Europe or the
Eastern States are left for* the sailor,
and soon the Ã¼biquitous tramp
steamer will swamp these routes.
With the passing of the sailing ship
passes also the picturesque. There is
no more beautiful sight on the seas
than an American clipper ship under
full sail. There is an airy grace and
beatuy about her spars, a lightness of
movement and a perfection of propor
tion which belong to the vessels of no
other nationality. The English sailing
vessels are strong and seaworthy, but
they are too heavy in their hull and
rigging for beauty. However, all alike,
whether it be the substantial British
four-master or the light American clip
per, are doomed, and another genera
tion will see no more of these winged
messengers of the sea.

the winter of 1894 four leaders among
the rebellious convicts were shot dead
and four were maimed for life.
But the most dare-devil and boldest
contest for liberty that has probably
ever taken place within the walls of
any penal institution in this country
was that of one morning In October,
1887. The old timers of Yuma who have
lived for a generation and more on the
frontier of civilization and have been
eye witnesses of desperate conflicts and
Slaughters of human beings on the
plains and in the mountains, have not
yet ceased talking of that morning.
Thomas Gates, who died by his own
hand a few months ago, was superin
tendent of the penitentiary at the time.
As he came from his private quarters
early one morning he passed in the
rear of a brick building, where he was
set upon by four prisoners, who were
serving long sentences for stage rob
beries and murder. The attack was
made within the range of the armed
guards upon the wall. Superintendent
Gates' heroism on that eventful occa
sion, when he received wounds that left
him a physical wreck, Is a matter of
history.
At the peril of his own life he called
upon the guards to shoot, and the order
was obeyed. In ' a second more
twenty other prisoners who had waited
for the signal to make a united break
for liberty ran from their workshops
to the prison office, knocked the guards
there into insensibility, and despoiled
the place of its rifles and pistols. A
dozen more prisoners attempted to run
out of the laundry and kitchen to help
their fellow convicts, but were kept
back by the armed guards.
In a few seconds the guards upon the
beauty and speed. Those were the
good old days of ocean races from
China to New* York, when the ship that
landed the nrst cargo of tea won. not
only much honor, but a substantial
profit for her owners. Speed was every
thing then, and cargo capacity but a
subsidiary consideration. To-day we
have reversed all this, the modern
The RpanoK?, Last of the Biggest Wooden Vessels Afloat. Coming Into San F ranclsco Ba y-
walls turned their Winchesters and
Gatling guns upon the rebellious con
victs, while the dozen guards in the
prison yard and about the shops threw
themselves into the breach to ketp
other prisoners from joining in the re
bellion. An eye-witness of the affair,
who has been through two Apache and
Comanche Indian wars, says he nevvr
saw so many men instantly stand up
an I face death as did both the prison
guards and the rebellious convicts that
October morning.
Shots were exchanged at a range of
less than twenty feet between tbe
guards and the prisoners. A dozen iÂ»f
the latter who were near the gatts
darted outside the walls, and, rifles iÂ»n
hand, started for the town of YumJi.
No Gatling gun was ever worked moi c
rapidly and unerringly than that c-n
the penitentiary walls at that time, and
the Winchesters in the hands of an
other guard on the walls fired a b*>ll
every three seconds. Nine of the flefc
ing convicts dropped wounded in their
tracks. Three more threw up their
hands as a sign of surrender, and In
this fashion walked back to the prison
yard.
The attention of the guards was
turned to the mutiny In the yard, but
there the Gatling gun could not be
used, because of the angle in which.it
had to be turned. Only the Winchester
rifles could be used. For a few min
utes there was a terrific exchange of
shots, and few of them went astray
from their mark. Five prisoners and
three guards fell dead almost at one
another's feet, while three prisoners
were wounded for life. One guard was
shot four times through the body, and,
A DARING DASH FOR LIBERTY.
nevertheless, lived several years. The
injured prisoners threw up their hands
because they were out of cartridges,
and were marched to their cells.
The wooden building in front of
which the guards stood in their hand
to-hand fight is still shown in evidence
of the ferocity of the fight. There are
forty-seven bullet holes in it. Some
of them were made by lead balls after
they had passed through a man's body.
The battle was all over in five minutes.
Not a word was spoken by any of the
participants. Guard Hartlee stood like
a statue at his post, shootinsr when
ever he could get a bead on one of the
convicts. After the fight, when asked
how he felt during it, he replied:
"I started In like I had a hard day's
cargo carrier, an enormous lading in
her hull, dawdles lazily over the ocean,
and passages now are longer than they
ever were.
Considerations of economy, more than
anything else, have dictated this un
fortunate change. Wherever speed is
required there steam has stepped in and
ousted the sailer. And even where there
work to do and I wanted to get through
quickly."
The woeful experience of these rebel
lious convicts during their five min
utes' taste of liberty Is so memorable
that it has done much to discourage
plans for a similar uprising.
In the history of the prison only one
man has succeeded In crossing the
trackless deserts that environ the Ter
ritorial penitentiary at Yuma, and
reaching old Mexico. The man was a
half-breed Mexican. His grandmother
was an Apache squaw, and his Indian
blood stood him in good stead in run
ning across the desert and leaving no
track behind, while he eluded the scent
of bloodhounds and marksmanship of
the prison sharpshooters. It was In
ISS3. before the prison was so well
equipped with firearms and sharp
shooters as it is to-day. The convict
was a life prisoner, and was sent to
Yuma for highway robbery and murder
at the same time. From a confederate
he obtained a gun after getting outside
the prison, and with this he was able
to kill a rabbit and a small bird on the
first evening of his liberty. These he
ate raw and they were his sole susten
ance for about ten days. He was
tracked more than 100 miles by Yuma
Indian trailers, and they lost all trace
of him in a long, rocky canyon.
A party of mining prospectors found
the remains of a man, wearing the
shreds of a Yuma convict's garb one
day in the foothills over the bordar line
between the United States and Mexico.
The thin starved, mummified bolv ans

who had risked the horrors of thi most
savage desert in all the world in the
hope of liberty, and had suffered untold
agonies in. his vain endeavors to get to

Reformatory measures are not prac
ticed at the Yuma prison, because
nearly all the prisoners are Mexicans
and half-breeds â Mexicans and In

THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY SAVED FROM DROUGHT
THE Sacramento Vallc- has been
saved from drought.
But the work has not been eas
ily done. It has cost tens of taou
sands of dollars and called for
all the ingenuity that engineers b and
the farmers themselves wore capable of.
Six weeks ago it was feared that the
crops of 200,000 acres would prove a to
tal loss. Three weeks ago, after cer
tain irrigating work had been Btarted,
there was hope and now success is as
sured, although the work is still go
ing on.
In order to fully comprehend the dan
ger that threatened most of the big
farmers in the Sacramento Valley as a
result of our last extraordinary dry
â¢winter it must be remembered that un
der normal conditions no irrigation
whatever is needed. In fact, the gen
eral annual trouble has been too much

enormous pumping plants for the pur
pose of removing this surplus. But this
year things were reversed.

IT was the night after the Brooklyn
Handicap had been won by Orna

fellows," were gossiping in the cor
ridor of a New Turk hotel.
Running along on racing for a time
with stories of great winings and los
ings, the talk finally slipped into stories
of cards and gambling. One man was
a noted manufacturer of playing cards,
yet he had never played a game of
poker in his life. Another was a re
tired gambk-r, now a turf patron of
prominence â Lind he in all his spirting
career had never taken a drink!
There were others present, but they
do not count for this story. They were
good listeners and this is what they
heard :

mento has such a contingency arisen.
Never before in the month of April did
the settlers in the Yolo Basin see such
an expanse of dry land; never before
in the history of the State has there
been one single drop of water conveyed
to the river bottom lands iÂ»f the Sacra

yet to-day there are millions upon mil
lions of gallons being poured into the
absorbing sands from Colusa to Contra

Sacramento is thirsty' for the first time
in the memory of man.
Not until the present dry spell had
continued well into the month of April
was it that the river farmers began to
look about with apprehension. "When

"One day in Chicago I was shown a
new cheating box. It had a hidden
spring lock which would loosen the
side plate and push out two cards at
a time if necessary. I took one of
these boxes to Cincinnati and gave it
to my partner to please him. He was
in a frenzy of delight. He couldn't
sleep for thinking about the money
that crooked box could make for him.
1 wouldn't use it, and he was afraid
to be confidential with any one around

joined the half ton of similar cheating
devices which he kept locked up. I
don't think, with all his mania for such
things, that the old man ever turned a
trick with such a box. He simply did
not have the nerve. You can never tell

after his arrival mere over a year ago, took a contract
with himself to exterminate the entire canine population

This, of course, made it necessary to call a halt, and
Tip was in consequence made acquainted with the re

a most discouraging effect on him and for -weeks he wan

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 2(>, 1898.
The novelty of the situation can be
best judged when it is known that the
very means by which the present dry
and thirsty lands are watered were, in
the first instance, intended and design
ed to carry water away. The original
purpose of the great puÂ»ping plants
on Grand Island has been completely
reversed, 'and instead of pumping the
water out to drain the usually flooded
district they are pumping the water in
to moisten the land that is now parched
and hard.
At a steamboat landing known as
"Hyde" the district has a large pump
ing plant capable of discharging 50,000
gallons of water per minute through
the lino of pipe which empties into the
river at that point. Leading to this
point of discharge is a large canal
which connects with other canals and
small ditches, until 12,000 acres of Land
has been placed under this system,
which ordinarily drains the entire area.
To reverse this and turn the waters
back into the canal and its tributaries
was the problem to be solved, and the
forces of nature solved it. As the land
well, thank you, by keeping away from
the heavy losers, who were playing the
limit. There was frequent objurgation
<>f wrath from the big players, but
swearing at a. queen does not make her
do her duty to a faro fiend.
"Along came a fellow who shuffled
his chips with the abandon and ease
that marked him a professional gam
bler. He played high and lost with
magnificent precision and dispatch. At
last he raised up, yawned and put $111
on a card, saying 'That's my last bet.
I've walked fifty-three miles to-day,
fell down and hurt myself and I guess
I'll quit.' His money was lost and he
got up. But he did not leave. He saun
tered about the room and in a few min
utes the proprietor asked him to step
outside. Then a loser at the table said
to another loser, 'No wonder we don't
v. in. Did you hear what the fellow
said?'
"'Well, what of it?' said the other
loser.
" 'What of it? Why, the game is
crooked. When he said that he had
walked fifty-three miles he meant that
there were fifty-three cards in the box.
We're up against it. The boss has
taken him downstairs to settle.'
"There was a rapid chancre of deal
ers and cards, and that house was soon
in bad favor."

facturer, "that faro cards are the most

the best material, but must be printed

very carefully to prevent marking,
scratching or splitting. A card dam
aged so that it leaves a mark is a dan
gerous proposition for a bank dealer.
You have no idea of the complaints
that come to manufacturers about
cards which are susceptible of marking
or accidents which disclose their iden
tity. Not long ago a rich man came to
me and said he was losing at poker
with high-priced cards. He was a busi
ness man and played a stiff game with
other business men two or three nights
a week. He had bought the cards and
kept them locked up in his safe, but in
an outer compartment. In three months
he had lost about $11,000, and was very
tired. I looked over his cards, dealing
them out face down. I threw out card
after card which my practiced eye
showed me had been 'fixed.' Every
one was a court card.
"But how had they been marked?
That was what puzzled us both. An
investigation developed that a negro
servant had access to the safe at tim. s.
He had been bribed by two other so
called gentlemen who sat in the game
to steal the cards out at night, ami
they had adroitly fixed them. They

But one day Tip wandered into Woodward's Pavilion,
where one of our pugilistic celebrities was in training
punching the bap. He looked, he saw. he comprehended
and in a moment was a changed dog. The world was
brighter to him again.

He Jumped, he bit and he punched, and when he became
tired out laid down to rest satisfied, ana once more life

Since that time Tip has made a regular business of bag
punching. In fact he is at it every chance he can get.

MAKING A GEYSER OF THE LIQUID AIR.
BY courtesy of the Cosmopolitan Magazine The Call presents here
the onginal account of the liquefaction of air by Charles E. Trip
ler, the man whose long and patient wor* has made the seemingly
impossible possible.
To aid the reader to understand some of the experiments which
seem so marvelous even to the scientist, Mr. Tripler brought a cubic foot
of liquefied air to the photograph gallery of The Cosmopolitan, and the
Iting illustrations will be found to aid tne reader greatly in un
nding the experiments of which he speaks.
The can contained a cubic foot of liquid, which was colorless, ex
cept perhapsâ so it seemed to the imaginationâ a tinge of that blue which
one finds In the heavens on a perfectly cloudless day. A number of those
who witnessed these experiments could recall that in the standard natural
philosophies, which they nad studied as boys, the statement had been
laid down that the air which we commonly breathe is not capable of be
ing liquefied.
Yet here were eight hundred cubic feet of air compressed into a
cubic foot of liquid held in an uncovered ice cream freezer. Here was
a liquid secured by subjecting the air to thousands of pounds' pressure
but the liquid whicn had been under such dangerous pr-ssure, now rest
ed quietly at the bottom a tin can, requiring no bonds of steel to hold it
â within uounds.
Stranger still, we are presently to see this harmless-looking liquid be
come again the most powerful of agencies when reconfined in a steel cham
ber. And these seeming paradoxes were to be presently thrown into the
shade when Mr. Tripler, taking a cup made of ice, and having poured into
it this liquid with a temperature several hundred degrees below zero pro
ceeded to insert into the liquid air a steel rod which, when set fire to by
means of a common match, sizzled and burned and meltedâ yet the melt
ing of steel in an ordinary crucible is an operation requiring many hun
dred degrees of heat for its consummation.
It is said that the first ounce of liquid air cost an English laboratory
three thousand dollars for its production. While this was goin* on an
American not content with the mere fact of discovery, sought successfully
to bring the result of hxs experiments to that practical basis which would
place It within the every-day use of the scientific mercantile world. Honor
then to this American who has waved the magic wand and produced results
which open up so broad a field of possibilities. Â»uÂ«;s
IN describing his marvelous experi
ments Mr. Trlpler said:
"There is i;o such thing in na
ture's laboratory as an absolute

boiling away. You will observe that it

this I puin an ounce or so of liquid air.
At liitt it lloats, the nitrogen being a

however, they dive deeper and deeper,

finally some of them fairly reach the

been molded has been withdrawn. This
Ice cup I partially fill with a liquid now
largely oyxgen; and when I dip into it
the end of a steel wire to which a
lighted match is fastened, the hard
metal burns explosively, like a fuse,
with a brilliant effusion of sparks, so
that the chilly crystal around it glows
like a lamp.
"It remains to show the explosive
power of this mysterious liquid under
various conditions. I first take a heavy
copper tube about a foot long, sealed at
the lower end, and, having poured in a
few drops of liquid air, hammer a close
ly fitting wooden plug into the orifice.
I have scarcely time to step back be
fore the expanding vapor blows out the
plug with a loud explosion, driving it
against the ceiling with great force; in
the open air I have seen it hurled to a
height of 300 feet. The contiiwcl liquid
has behaved exactly as water would
act in a tube heated white hot.
"Here tin- action is purely mechani
cal, but, by taking advantage of the
intense chemical activity of oxygen, ex
plosions of far --reater violence may be
obt.'iined. To illustrate this, I saturate
in the azure-tinted liquid a wad of oily
cotton waste, and place it in a steel
tube of great strength, open at both
ends. When a spark is applied â which
must be done from a safe distance â
the tube is rent into fragments. If the
wad were first wet - ith turpentine the
explosive force would excec.l that of
guncotton. This compound is. well suit
ed for use in shells or torpedoes, and
might easily be made a destructive
agent of terrible efficiency in war; no
thickness of armor-plate could resist
its ruthless ener" I . Moreover, there
would be no risk in the handling, as it
is not exploded by concussion. It can
be discharged only by the contact with
a spark; the whole effect is produced
by rapidâ practically instantaneousâ
combustion."
Of liquid aid Mr. Tripler says that
the most obvious application would be
for the purposes of refrigeration. The
possibilities in medicine and surgery are
numerous. By means of this process,
air absolutely free from germs could be
furnished in any amount, and if the
stimulating effect of an excess of oxy
gen were desired it could be had with
out trouble, quite free from the impur
ities which now often make this gas
objectionable. The temperature of hos
pital wards, even in the tropics, could
readily be cooled to any degree pre
scribed by the physicians in charge,
and by keeping the air about yellow fe
ver patients down to the frost point, the
nurses would be perfectly protected
against contagion and the recovery of
the patients themselves facilitated.
Again, the cauterizing cold which liquid
air is capable of producing might be
used in cases of cancer with great ad
vantage, as compared with nitrate of
silver, since while it absolutely de
stroys the flesh to which it is applied its
action is perfectly under control and
can be stopped in an instant. This is
far from being true of lunar caustic. It
is probable, also, that hay fever, asth
ma and even consumption could be
greatly relieved without change of cli
mate by this pure, cold, germless air.
Its possible use as a high explosive
in war has already beon adverted to.
Further, military authorities are al
ready making inquiries as to its appli
cation to the cooling of guns when in
action; and there is no obvious reason
why it should not prove highly effica
cious and of great value in this way.
Still more important, however, will be
its service as a motive force on war
ships â or, indeed, on any ships. It can
be handled with perfect safety in an
ordinary engine, in the same manner
as steam, but without requiring op
pressive heat; for, as we have seen, the
ordinary heat of water is quite suffi
cient. Freed from the necessity of car
rying an immense amount of power
needed, vessels would be able to make
voyages of any length at a speed equal
ing that of the swiftest torpedo boats,
running at a rate of from 40 to 45 miles
per hour. And in submarine boats the
motor itself would supply all the air
required for breathing, abundant, cool
and pure, instead of generating over
powering heat and stifling gases, as is
the case at present.
It is also worth while considering its

THE ABUSE OF OUR SOLDIERS.
Poultney Bigelow, who recently returned from a trip devoted to studying Spain and the Spaniards,
has just completed a visit of the American camps in the Southeast. According to his idea, after comparing
what he has recently seen with the camps and captains of Europe, the brains and patriotism of our army
are crushed by politics and incompetence.
TAMPA, Fla., Saturday.â Do not
laugh, good warrior friends of
the regular army. This is not
written for you. I am address
ing only major generals of recent
creation, and amateur soldiers gen
erally, who are playing havoc with the
health and welfare of our brave army.
The state of that army at Tampa can
be compared to a set of modern electric
machinery dumped upon the beach of
an African Sultan. The machinery is
magnificent, but no one can put it to
gether. At Tampa is an army of inva
sion estimated by the tens of thou
sands. It contains individual men and
officers unequaled fn the armies of Eu
rope for physique, military training
and courage, yet these elements are
rendered impotent because the direc
tion of them is intrusted to men unfit
for command.
Suppose, now, we set to work to turn
the incompetent men out of the army.
It will make a tremendous void, but it
must be done before the army can move
successfully. We must begin at the
top. Who is In command? To-day no
one knows.
Let us determine that immediately.
Let the President name some general
as commander of the troops, and let it
be understood that henceforth he and
he alone shall be held accountable for
the conduct of the campaign. What
would we think of a ship with three or
four captains aboard? Yet our little
army has been distracted for the last
month with half a doian commanders
in chief.
There should, then, be no more back
stairs intrigue against the head of the
army. General Miles would consult
General Schofield if he saw fit, but the
papers would not henceforth be print
ing paragraphs to the effect that the
President was getting advice from
Schofield and Ignoring that of the nom
inal commander of the army.
I do not say that Miles is the best
general in the United States. If a vote
were taken among officers of the regular
service the choice might fall upon Wes
ley Merritt, whom Secretary Alger
has deported to the Philippines. But
any general at the head is better than
this present rule of chaos. Any order
is better than no order. Nothing is
worse for soldiers than to feel that they
are without a leader. Once we have a
head to the army the first thing he will
do. if he has the courage, will be to ap
point a board to inquire into the fitness
for command of the many who have
been recently pushed into high military
places by political or money influence.
This board will weed out perhaps 75
per cent of the total recently appointed,
and that will make room for good men.

brains or courage, but there are many
ways of ridding the service of those
who have neither. And this is better
done before a battle than after it.
The armies of Europe have all been
remodeled since the Franco-German
war. The most important element in
their present efficiency is that no of
ficer remains in a givt 1 grade more
than a certain number of years, and
that no promotions take place except
ing after proof of competency. Thus,
if a man has been a captain for a few
years and is not promoted when his
turn comes he is expected to resign for
unfitness.
Now, men of practical business habits
think that the best man t. command a
brigade is the officer who has proved
a good commander of a regiment. So
think all soldiers. But not so our
acephalous War Department in Wash
ington. I see men who left the army
when they were lieutenants now thrust
back again over the heads of officers
who have remained consecutively with
their regiments. I see men made briga
dier generals who on any kind of test
examination would be unfit to take
charge of a company. Can we expect
soldiers to fight with enthusiasm under
generals whom they do not respect?
The French catastrophe at Sedan was
largely due to political Jobbery in the
army. There is a little of this in the
Spanish army, but not so much as in
our own. Besides, in Spain, the soldiers
do not read the papers so freely as
with us, and are not accusto. Ed to our
ways of doing things. In any other
trade than soldiering the men would
Ftrike by reason of the incompetent
bosses placed in charge of their com
fort and safety.
And now for the staff. What Is a
staff? There appears to be a no
tion at Washington that a staff
officer is selected by the gen
eral's wife. with special refer
ence for his capacity for holding a
pnrasol or writing out a French bill of
faro. That is the notion of the staff as
it prevailed in Europe fifty years ago.
To-day we are the only nation, with the
possible exception of the Chinese, who
treat our staff positions as means of
gratifying personal and political
friends. We are preparing disaster for
ourselves.
To-day the staff should be made up of
not merely soldiers In the ordinary
sense, but soldiers who have become
specialist in certain branches of mili
tary knowledge. An army machine to
day is vastly more complicated than it
ever was before, and the mere fighting
it calls for knowledge not readily ac
quired excepting by years of prepara
tion. In the German army officers
who desire to go upon the staff are first
subject to examination for special fit
ness as ordinary soldiers. They must
be highly recommended as men fit to
lead troops in the field. Then, when
they have successfully passed these
tests, they go to a special war college,
where they take what we might call
postgraduate courses, which are in the
nature of an extension of the West
Point course.

and that they had to do the best with
out any help. Regiments pitched their
tents without any reference to their
neighbors, and in most cases the col
onels did not get any information as to
where they could draw rations, except
ing by making purchases out of their
own scant pay.
Regiments sent to Tampa have been
handled like cattle on the railways. The
officers in command have had nothing
to say regarding methods of transport
ation, and no staff officers have been
on hand to see that the railway com
panies fulfilled their contracts or treat
ed the men with half the decency ac
corded to horses and cows. In Ger
many during the two last great wars I
well recall the interminable trainloads
of soldiers moving to the front amid
every mark of good will along the line
of travel. At every station were pails
of water, If not beer, offered to the
thirsty men and horses. Sandwiches
and cigars were thrust upon them, not
here and there, but at every halting
place. The men were in the best of
spirits, for they were well cared for,
and, though the journey frequently
lasted many days, the men had chancea
to get a nap now and then on the
benches.
The First United States Infantry was
twelve days coming to Tampa from San.
Francisco. No staff officer accompanied
them, and no one knew what the con
tract was between the United States
Government and the railway which did
the transportation. They were sent at
a time when the Government was
shouting for an immediate invasion of
Cuba, and when, therefore, great speM
was desirable.
That regiment took twelve days to
come. They were handled as freight,
and not even as perishable livestock.
They were shunted for indefinite peri
ods whenever the company saw fit to
make way for more paying if not more
important traffic. No provision w.-sa
made for the men cooking their foo.l nt
regular hours, and in those twelve days
they were treated with a disregard of
comfort that would have been impossi
ble in an emigrant ship.
Nothing that George Kennan has told
me of the treatment of political exiles
in Russia exceeds in brutality the treat
ment of our American soldiers going at
the call of their country to set free :he
patriots of Cuba. This suffering wag
not made necessary by the war. Thera
was no such brutal treatment of sol
diers by Germany in her great war.
What I mention here is the result
merely of ignorance in positions where
ignorance means cruelty.
If we selected for staff officers only
army officers of good military record
we should have none too good a staff.
But to fill up these most important
posts with men who are unfit means to
furnish amateurs with a license to play
with the lives of brave soldiers. We
need staff men who can take charge of
feeding and equipping men in the field.
We need specialists in the matter of
transporting troops. We need men who
are familiar with the needs of war.
To-day our men are sweltering under
their tents, dressed in winter clothing,
while the thermometer is tropical. For
a month they have been in neeed of
suitable clothing. They ask if there is
any one who is looking out for them!

They were Alexander Williamson of Dundee, better

birth, and of no known address.
The Gaffer reclined in his bunk, reading by the light of a
Htnoky and evil-smelling lamp. He had been mate of the
J. R. MacXMll. and was now captain as well as patriarch
of the party. He possessed three booksâ the Bible. Mii
ton's "Paradise Lost," and an odd volume of "The Turk

The lamplight glinted on the rim of his spectacles and on
the silvery hairs in his beard, the slack of which hÂ» had
tucked under the edge of his blanket. His lips moved as
he read, and now and then he broke off to glance mildly
at Faed and the Snipe, who were busy beside the fire with
a greasy pack of cards, or to listen to the peevish grum
bling of Lashman inthe bunk below him.
Lashman had taken to his bed six weeks before -with
scurvy, and complained incessantly, and though they
hardly knew it, these complaints were wearing his com

"Oh. stow it, George! Damn it all. mar!â"
He checked himself sharp and short, repentant and re
buked by the silence of the others. They were good sea
man all,, and tender dealing with a sick shipmate was part
of their code.
Lashman's voice, more querelous than ever, cut Into
the silence like a knife:
"That's it. You've thought it for -weeks, and now you
say it. I've knowed it all along. I'm just an encumbrance.
and the sooner you're shut of me the better, says you. You
needn't to fret. I'll soon be out of Itâ out there alongside
of Billâ"
"Easy there, matey!" The Snipe glanced over his
Bhoulder and laid his cards face downward. "Here, let me

"It'll make me quiet, you mean. Plucky Seal you care

arranged the pillow of skins ami gunny bags.
"Let him say it. Let him say he didn't mean it, thi

Cooney flung a leg wearily over the side of his ham
mock, jerked himself, out, and shuffled across to the sick
man's berth.
"Ay coorse I didn't mane it. It just took me, ye see,

took up a r^nikln from th>- floor beside the bunk, pulled
a hot iron from the lire and stirred the frozen drink. The
invalid turned his shoulder pettishly. "I didn't mane it,"
Cooney repeated. He set down the panlkm and shuffled
â wearily back to his hammock.
The Gaffer blew a long cloud and stared at the fire;
at the smoke mounting and thr- gray ash droppingâdrop
ping: at David Faed dealing the cards and licking his
thumb between each. Long Ede shifted from one cramped
elbow to another and pushed his Bible nearer the blaze,
murmuring, "Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil
our vines."
"Full hand." the Snipe announced.
"Ay." David Faed rolled the quid in his cheek. The
cards were so thumbed and tattered that by the backs of
them each player guessed pretty shrewdly what the other
held. Yet they went on playing night after night; the
Snipe shrilly blessing or cursing his luck, the Scotsman
phlegmatic as a bolster.
"Play away, man. What ails ye?" he asked.
The Snipe had dropped both hands to his thighs and
sat ud. stiff and listening.
"Whist! Outside the door. . . ."
All listened. "I hear nothing," said David, after ten
its art, the handsomer will be its tattooing. The Austra

They trace straight parallel lines or angles upon their
arms and their few utensils. They have not reached the
conception of the polygon, curve or spiral. They are
ignorant of symmetry, alternation, and the various prin
ciples that presideoverthegroupingof ornamental designs.
So their tattooing is rude, and composed simply of a few
parallel or intersecting lines or cf dotted ones. Tha
African worshipers of fetiches, whose art Is very crude,
trace lines and angles, which they repeat in series; but
make very little use of curves.
Opposed to these are tha Polynesians, whose orr.a

They heard now Cooney slipped down from his ham
mock, stoic to the door and listened, crouching with his
ear close to the jamb. The sound resembled breathingâ or
so ne tnought for a moment. Then it seemed rather as if
some creature were softly feeling about the doorâ softly
fumbling us coating of ice and frozen snow.
Cooney listened. They all listened. Usually, as soon as
they stirred from the scorching circle of the :!re their
breath came from them in clouds. It trickled from them
now in thin wisps of vapor. They could almost hear the
soft gray ash dropping on the hearth.

pretty thick outside. If 'tis a bear, we don't want him
fooling on the roof, and I misdoubt the drift by the north
corner is pretty tall by this time. Is he there "still?"

Snipe, and listen."
"Breath, eh? Did it smell like beer?"
"I don't know. ... I didn't smell nothing, to notice.
Here, put your head down, close."
The Snipe bent his head. And at that moment the door
shook gently. All stared and saw the latch move up, up
.... and falteringly descend on the staple. They heard
the click of it.
The door was secured within by two stout bars.
Against these there had been no pressure. The men waited
a n, ence that ached - But the latch was not lifted again.
The Snipe, kneeling, looked up at Cooney. Cooney
shivered and looked at David Faed. Lone Ede with his
back to the fire, softly shook his feet free of the rugs His
eyes searched for the Gaffer's face. But the old man had
drawn back into the gloom of his bunk, and the lamplight
shone only on a gray fringe of beard. He saw Long Ede's
look^ .though, and answered it quietly as ever.
"Take a brace of guns aloft, and fetch us a look
round. Walt if there's a chance of a shot. The trap
works. I tried it this afternoon with the cuÂ«3 chisel."
Long Ede lighted his pipe, tied down thÂ« ear-pieces of
his cap. lifted a light ladder off its staples and set it
against a roof-beam; then, with the guns under his arm
quietly mounted. His head and shoulders wavered and
grew vague to sight in the smoke wreaths. "Heard any
thing mnre?" he asked. "Nothing sincr." answered the
Snipe. With his shoulder Long E<!" pushed up the trap.
They saw his head framed in a panel of moonlight with
one frosty star above it. He was wriggling through
"Pitch him up a sleeping-bag, somebody." the Gaffer or
dered, and Cooney ran with one.. "Thankee, mate!" said
Long Ede and closed the trap.
They heard his feet stealthily crunching the frozen
stuff across the roof. .He was working toward the eaves
overlapping the door. Their breath tightened. They wait
ed for the explosion of his gun. None came. The crunch-
Ing If san again: it was heard down by the very edee of
the eaves. It mounted to the blunt ridge overhead, then it
ceased.
"He will not have seen aught." David Faefl muttered.
"Listen, you. Listen by the door again." They talked
in whispers. Nothing; there was nothing to be heard
They crept back to the fire and stood there warming them
selves, keeping their eyes on the latch. It did not move
After awhile Cooney slipped off to his hammock; Faed to
his bunk, alongside Lashman's. The Gaffer hacJ picked up
his book again. The Snipe laid a couple of logs on the
blaze, and remained beside it, cowering, with his arms
stretched out as If to embrace it. His shapeless shadow
wavered up and down on the bunks behind him; and
acn.ss the fire, he still stared at the latch.
Suddenly the sick man's voice quavered out â
"It's not him they wantâ it's Bill! They're after Bill,
nut there! That was Bill trying to get in. . . Why
didn't yer open? It was Bill. I tell yrr!"
At thr- first word the Snipe had wheels right-about
fare, and stood now pointing and shaking like a man with
ague. ,
"Matey . . .for the love of God . . ."
"I won't hush. There's something wrong here to-night.
I can't sloop. It's Bill, I tell yer. See his poor hammock
up there shaking . . ."
Cooney tumbled out with an oath and a thud. "Hush
it. you white-livered swine! Hush it, or byâ" His hand
went behind him to his knife-sheath.
"Dan Cooney"â the Gaffer closed his book and leaned
outâ "go hack to your bed.''
"T won't, sir. Not unless â "
"Go back."
"Flesh and bloodâ"
"Go back!" And for the third time that night Cooney
went back.

Lone Ede crouched on the frozen ridge of the hut, with
his feet in the sleeping-bag, his knees "drawn up and the
two guns laid across them. The creature, whatever its
name, that had tried the door, was nowhere to be seen:
but he had decided to wait a few minutes on the chance of
a shot: that is. until the rold should drive him below. For
the moment the clear tingling air was doing him good. The
truth was. Long EdÂ« had begun to be afraid or himself,

he put it to himself, something inside his nead was melt

brooks, and as they fleeted he could almost smell the
brown meadow scent. "Take us the foxes, the little

was light-headed, and he knew it. He must hold out.
They were all going mad; were, in fact, three parts crazed
alreadyâ all except the Gaffer. And the Gaffer relied on
him as his right-hand man. One glimpse ur the returning
sunâ a glimpse onlyâ might save them yet.
He gazed over the frozen hills and northward across the
Icepack. A few streaks of pale violetâ the ghost of the
Auroraâ fronted the moon.â He could see for miles. Bear
or foxâ no living creature was'in sight. But who coula
tell what might be hiding behind any of a thousand hum
mocks? He listened. He heard the slow grinding of the
icepack on the beach; only that. Take us the foxes, the
little foxes. . . ."
This would never do. He must climb down and walk
briskly, or return to the hut. Maybe there was a bear,
after all. behind one of the hummocks and a shot, or the
chance of one, would scatter his head clear of these tom
fooling notions. He would have a search around.
What was that, moving ... on a hummock, not 500
yards away. He leaned forward to gaze.
Nothing now, but he had seen something 1 . He lowered
himself to the eaves by the north corner, am': from the
eaves to the drift piled there. The drift was frozen solid,
but for a treacherous crust of fresh snow. His foot
slipped upon this and he slid down of a heap.
Luckily, he had been careful to sling the gv.ns tightly
at his back. He picked himself up. and. unstrapping one,
took a step into the bright moonlight to examine the nip
ples; took two steps, and stood stock still.
There, before him on the frozen coat of snow, was a
footprint. No; two. three, fourâ many footprints; prints
of a naked human foot; right foot, left foot, both naked,
and blood in each printâ a little smear.
It had come, then. He was mad for certain. He saw
them; he put his fingers in them; touched the frozen
blood. The snow before the door was trodden thick with
thr-mâ some going, some returning.
"The latch . . . lifted . . ." Suddenly he recalled
the figure he had seen moving upon the hummock, and
with a groan he turned and gave chase. O, he was mad
for certain. He ran like a madmanâ floundering, slipping,
plunsring, in his clumsy moccasins. "Take us the foxes,
the little foxes. . . . My beloved put in his hand by the
hole in the door, and my bowels were moved for him.
... I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem ... I
charge you ... I charge . . ."
He ran thus for 300 yards, maybe, and then stopped as
suddenly as he had started.
His matesâ they must not see these footprints, or they
would go mad. too; mad as he. No, he must cover them
up. all within sight of the hut. And to-morrow he would
come alone and cover those farther afield. Slowly he re
traced his steps. The footprintsâ those which pointed
toward the hut and those which pointed away from it â
lay close together; and he knelt before each, breaking
fresh snow over the hollows and carefully hiding the
blood. And now a great happiness filled his heart, inter
rupted once or twice as he" worked by a feeling that some
one was following and watching him. Once he turned
northward and gazed, making a telescope of his hands.
He saw nothing and fell again to his long task.
Within the hut the sick man cried softly to himself.
Faed, the Snipe, and Cooney. slept uneasily, and muttered
in their dreams. The Gaffer lay awake, thinking. After
Bill. George Lashman. and after George . . . ? Who
next? And who would be the lastâ the unburied one?
The men were weakening fast; their wits and courage
coming down at the last with a rush. Faed and Long
Ede were the only two to be depended on for a day. The
Gaffer liked Long Ede. who was a. religious man. Indeed,
he had a crowing suspicion that Long Ede. In spite of
some amiable laxitips of belief, was numbered among the
elect, or mipht b<\ if interceded for. The Gaffer began to
intercede for him silently, but experience had tau^nt him
that such "wrestlings" to be effective must be noisy, and
he dropped off to sleep with a sense of failure. . . .
The Snipe stretched himself, yawned and awoke. Tt
was 7 in the morning; time to prepare a cup of tea. He
tossed an armful of Ings on the fire, and the noise awoke
the Gaffer, who at once inquired for Lone Ede. He had
not returned. "Go you up to the roof. The lad must be
frozen." The Snipe climbed the ladder, pushed open the
trap, and came back, reporting that Loner Ede was no
where to be seen. The old man slipped a jumper over his
suits of clothingâ already three deepâ reached for a gun
and moved for the door. "Take a cup of something warm
to fortify." the Snine advised. "The kettle won't be five
minutes boiling." But the Gaffer pushed up the heavy
bolts and dragged the door open.
"Lnsh me! Here, bear a hand, lads!"
T.org Ede lay prone before the threshold, his out
stretched hands almost touching it, his moccasins al
ready covered out of sight by the powdery snow which
ran and trickled incessantlyâ trickled between his long
disheveled locks and over the back of his gloves, and ran
in a thin stream past the Gaffer's feet.
They carried him in and laid him on a heap of skins by
the fire. They forced rum between his clenched teeth and
beat his hnnds and feet, and kneaded and rubbed him.
A sigh fluttered on his lips; something between a sieh
and a smile, half seen, half heard. His eyes opened, and
they saw that it was really a smile.
"Wot cheer, mate?" Tt was the Snipe who asked.
"Iâ l seen . . ." The voice broke on, but he was smil
ing still.
What had he seen? Not the sun. surely. By the Gaffer's
reckoning the sun would not be due for a week or two yet;
how many weeks he could not say precisely â and some
times he was glad enough he did not know.
They forced him to drink a couple of spoonfuls of rum
and wrapped him up warmly. Every man contributed
BOrne of his own bedding. Then the Gaffer called to
morning prayers, and the three sound men dropped on
their knees with him. Now, whether by reason of their
joy at Long Ede's recovery, or because "the old man was
in splendid voice, they felt their hearts uplifted that
morning with a cheerfulness they had not known for
months. Long Ede lay and listened dreamily while the
passion of the Gaffer's thankfulness shook the hut. His
gaze wandered over their bowed formsâ "The Gaffer
David Faed, Dan Oooney, the Snipe andâ George Lash

counting. The Gaffer watched him furtively.
Since his recovery, though his lips moved frequently,
Long Ede had scarcely uttered a. word. But toward noon
on the fourth day he said an extraordinary thing.
"There's that sleeping bag I took with me the other
night. I wonder if It's on the roof still. It will be frozen
pretty stiff by this. You might nip up and see, Snipe"â
he pausedâ "if you lind it, stow it up yonder on Bill's
hammock."
The Gaffer opened his mouth, br.t shut it again without
speaking. The Snipe weni up the ladder.
A minute passed, and then they heard a cry from the
roofâ a cry that fetched them all trembling, choking,
weeping, cheering, to the foot of the ladder:
"Boys! boys! the sun"'
Months laterâ it was June, and even George Lashman
had recovered his strength â the Snipe came running with
news of the whaling fleot. And on thÂ« beach, as they
A-atched the vessels come to anchor. Long Ede told tha
Gaffer his story. "It was a hallâ a halluâ what d'ye call
itâ l reckon. I was crazed, eh?" The Garters eyes wan
dered from a brambling hopping about the lichen-covered
boulders and away to the sea fowl wheeling above the
ships; and then came to his mind a tale he had read once
in the "Turkish Spy." "I wouldn't say just that." he an
swered, slowly. -;Any way. 1 said Long Ede. "I believe
the Lord sent a miracle to us to save us all " "I wouldn't
say just that, either." the Gaffer objected. "I doubt' it
was meant .lust for you and me, and the rest were pre
sairved, as you say. inceedentally."

BAKER'S DEATH AT BALLS BLUFF.
Colonel Baker was at the head of the California Volunteers? in this atack and the action described by one of the par
ticipants gives a very vivid idea of the stubbornness of the contest. Colonel Baker was one of the best known Cali
fornians at the time.
TO fully understand the situation
of affairs which led up to the
battle of Ball's Bluff, reference
must be made to events which
Immediately preceded that bloody
â¢ . encounter. The Confederates
were flushed with the victory gained at
Bull Run a few months previous and
the Union forces were correspondingly
depressed. The Southern forces had
made numerous significant small raids
into Maryland and West Virginia, un
til McClellan, Rosecrans and Garfield
sobered them by defeat McClellan, al
ways cautious, was at that time en
gaged in the herculean task of creating
an army out of the rabble of Bull Run
reinforced by a vast number of green
volunteers.
Knowing that unless the raids were
checked they would grow in force un
der the skilled and enterprising Con-
federate commanders, McClellan has
tened the organisation of his troops
and stationed numerically strong corps
at vulnerable points along the upper
Potomac River as a cover to Wash
ington, which was the Confederate
goal, and which could be taken if Mc-
Clellan's lines could be crushed at some
vital point. The Immediate southern
front of Washington was too quickly
strengthened with earthworks and
large bodies of troops for the probable
success of such a dash, but such a re
sult might be possible at the more vul
nerable points on the upper Potomac.
The corps of observation was a large
division which occupied the Maryland
side of the Potomac for some thirty
miles, covering one of the largest and
easiest of Washington's "back doors."
It was under the command of General
Charles P. Stone, a skillful Massachu
setts officer of the regular army, with
a brilliant Mexican war record, whose
headquarters were at Poolesville, some
few miles back from Edwards' and
Conrad's ferries, both of which he
protected by mixed infantry and artil
lery pickets. Across the Potomac,
some three miles away, lay the aristo
cratic, wealthy and, more important
still, strategically valuable town of
Leesburg, the center of a network of
roads extending west into the Shenan
doah Valley, south into the great val
ley of Virginia (meaning Richmond
and communications), and eastward to
the Potomac below Washington.
The Confederates held Leesburg with
a fairly strong force, easily reinforcea
ble from the main army of Virginia,
centering at Manassas Junction to the
south. In their hands Leesburg was a
daily and hourly center of large and
small movements and might, at a day's
notice, be the grand base for handling
an army corps to be launched at Mary
land and Pennsylvania cities and rail
roads, or Washington Itself. Therefore
it was a standing menace to McClel
lan. In McClellan's hands it meant the
clearing of all Northern Virginia of
raiding parties and forcing the enemy
back upon his main lines, but more
important yet, it would be a fatal fac
tor upon the right flank of any Confed
erate column passing northward up the
great Shenandoah "* r "llev. over into
Maryland and Pennsylvania, as Lee.
and Jackson passed later toward An
tietam and Gettysburg, and the cav
alry into the rich York Valley of Penn
sylvania more than once, capturing and
destroying troops and supplies, and
striking at Washington on one hand
and at West Virginia on the other.
Accordingly, in October, 1861, General
McCall, a veteran officer, with 30,000
men, left the outer defenses of Wash
ington on the Virginia side arid by a
rapid, well-executed movement reached
Dranesville. At once every Confederate
knew that Leesburg lying straight
westerly from Dranesvilie, was the ob
jective point. . '
General Stone was to co-operate by
a movement of his division across the
Potomac, occupy Leesburg: and ;to hold
it if possible and at least create: a di
version sufficient to make -^jjjgCaU's
movement a certain success, 1u make
this crossing of General Stone's divis
ion rapidly it was necessary to occupy
simultaneously several of the ferries
covering the space of some miles. The
usual fiat scow, propelled by 4 poles,
which constituted the regulation Vir
ginia "ferry," was, of course, wholly in
adequate for any quick crossing of
numbers. General Stone, however, had
been assured upon the point and that
the utmost needful number of * boats
would be furnished him
â R, T^ r. day b , efore the battle of Balls
Bluff General Stone came to the artil
lery picket Of the New York Battery at
Conrad's ferry, and calling me the
lieutenant in command of the eection
STAMPEDE OF MINERS OND ADVENTURERS OVER CHILCOOT POSS.
By an eye witness, W. M. BRAMhJALL
(two guns), rode slowly along the river
bank. As we progressed he told me
that in view of any crossing we might
attempt if we ever snould (so discreet
is a good commander) he would show
me minutely every feature of the land
on both the Maryland and the Virginia
Fides, the river itself and the long
islani a little down stream known as
Harrison's Island, and whicn divided
the river into two unequal parts. He
was so explicit as to how each detail
was to be carried out that it was im
pressed even on my green mind that
something was going to happen in a
short time. At a certain point he
showed me the exact place to embark
our funs and we did embark them there
on the morrow. He seemed uneasy and
though saying that all needful boats
would be on hand the event proved that
that was the precise reason for his un
easiness, for the boats never came at
all.
The general left me at our camp on
our return and ordered that all the men
be kept within camp limits, whereby I
knew something was going to happen
at once, -^nd we were not surprised
when two companies of Massachusetts
Volunteers marched to the river during
the night, nor at the lively fusillade we
heard an hour or so later after Captain
Philbrick drove the enemy's pickets in
and pushed them rapidly up to Lees
burg. There re-enforcements forced
Philbrick back slowly. He fought coolly
and resisted stubbornly to gain time,
availing himself of timber and hillocks
to make repeated stands, so that when
he was forced quite back to the river
he found enough men of the Sixteenth,
Nineteenth and Twentieth Massachu
setts, Baker's California Regiment and
Cogswell's Tammany (New York) Regi
ment to hold the position. These troops
had been steadily poured into the place
and took a scow across the other
branch of the river, landing at the foot
of the precipitous, thickly wooded bluff
called Balls Bluff.
Up this infantry scrambled, until, be
fore noon, about 1900 troops were in a
well chosen and welboceupied position,
awaiting the arrival of General Baker.
With the first of the main body of the
infantry went gallant young Lieuten
ant French of the regular artillery with
his two mountain howitzers. General
Stone crossed with one or more bri
gades at Edward's ferry, some four or
five miles further down the stream.
Soon, a strong attack was made hy
the enemy under the command of the
veteran general, "Shanks" Evans, rein
forced by troops from Leesburg. The
fighting, though in the woods, was very
hot.
During the morning an orderly reach
ed us with orders to report at once to
General Baker at the crossing place on
the Maryland side, and we were soon
there. The scene was intensely excit
irfg. The one solitary scow was mak
ing slow trips carrying loads of eager
infantry over toward Virginia and
bringing back loads of wounded and
dead soldiers.
Colonel Baker, though outwardly
calm, and giving impromptu orders
with the steady coolness of the old ?ol
dier and frontiersman, was inward
ly raging, for the fight across the river
on the bluff was growing hotter and
hotter. He saw that the wounded were
accumulating faster than reinforce
ments could replace them, that Evans
was receiving heavy reinforcements,
and that he, Baker, was on the wrong
side of the river for a commanding
general who meant to fight. Calling
the artillery officers he ordered the
guns to cross before any more infantry,
for word came that French was
wounded seriously as were most of his
men who were not killed outright, and
the two mounted howitzers had stopped
barking.
Discovering that I was ranking first
lieutenant, he gave me the charge of
embarking the artillery and went him
self over to the battle. Upon arriving
at the foot of the bluff, it was found so
steep that we dismounted the one gun
and pulled, pushed, slided and somehow
got it to the top of the bluff.
There was a lull In the volley firing,
though a steady crack of sharpshoot
ers' guns from behind trees and out of
their tops denoted that the Mississippi
riflemen who had been placed there to
pick off our officers were doing their
work. Baker, cool, collected, but with
eyes of flame, was everywhere. His
was a notable figure, tall though rather
portly, but erect and soldierly. His uni
form sat well upon his manly form and
distinguished him from the volunteer
officers, who seemed out of place in the
misfit clothes. His bright color and
beautiful white hair made him a con
spicuous mark for the Mississlppians'
fire as well as for the loving recognition
of his beloved Californians and all of
his brigade.
But his mind was calm and clear, hla
perception instantaneous and accurate
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 26, 1898.
and he divined that Evans was working
round our flanks with numbers which
now greatly exceeded ours. So Baker,
going himself and sending others,
threw out strong bodies on each flank,
when, his disposition made, he quietly
awaited what he knew was coming,
namely, a rush in front by brigades and
a steady squeeze of regiments on each
flank. As part of the disposition of his
troops, he, beckoning me to follow, ad
vanced calmly to the front in the rec
tangular clearing of a few acres which
was surrounded on all sides by large
timber, and which being the only open
ground was necessarily the principal
fighting ground.
He asked my opinion kindly, as an old
officer to a young one, whether a cer
tain position in front of the center of
our line and some yards in advance of
it, with a slight roll of the ground, sug
gesting the idea of shelter, would do.
It was all alike to me. Anything would
do for the little I knew. We were soon
in battery, and by his orderâ he
meant to force the fighting and inter
rupt that heavy reinforcement which
Evans was bringing on our flanksâ we
opened on the woods in front. In a
second, all the "bottomless pit" seem
ed to open in front and on both sides
of us, and before ten rounds were fired
the gun was silent, with all but two
of the men killed or wounded.
Baker, now bareheaded, hav
ing thrown his hat away,
sprang to the gun, call
ing for volunteers and
immediately took post
to load or ram (I for
get which), and Cogs
well, Lee and Hincks,
lieu tenant colonels
and majors â I am
pained to have for
gotten their illustrious
titles â carried ammu
nition, sponged, load
ed, rammed and fired
till, when nearly all
the ammunition was
gone, a frightful vol
ley on one flank, fol
lowed by our line
crumpling up there
under heavy charge,
across and all tangled
up with our front
lines, stopped their
firing. Baker's orders
flew fast and clear.
Colonels rushed to
their regiments, the
crushed flank was reformed ana re
enforced and presently Evans' men
went back, whirling just as ours had
done. Then the same thing occurred
on the other flank, with the same
pventful result. But Baker's men were
melting away much faster than re-en
forcements could arrive, while Evans
had all the Confederate army to draw
upon, as McCall had been recalled
without Stone having been notified.
It was a question of staying to be
killed, surrendering or cutting our way
out. A brigade was coming at us.
Baker calmly ordered the charge and
in an instant was dead before us, rid
dled with bullets.
A wild fight with bayonets, clubbed
muskets and bare hands, with the en
emy now in among us, his men, who
loved him in life, saved his dear body
in death and bore it off the field.

CARING FOR A CAMERA IN THE
KLONDIKE.
SINCE the return of hundreds of
men who took cameras with them
to Alaska last winter there has
been great lamentation at the
small number of pictures produced.
Not that the exposures were not made,
but successes were so few. One man
who recently took rolls of 300 films to a
well known photographer to develop
failed to get a single picture except on
those exposed during the fall of last
year.
"The shutter didn't work very well,"
he said, by way of explaining the bad
results.
And that has been the universal com
plaint.
But how could the shutter be expect
ed to work when it was not treated
right? Of course that was the cause of
the trouble, for most of the unruly
shutters have worked perfectly since
being brought back.
In this connection a little timely ad
vice to those contemplating taking a
camera to the Klondike next winter
will prove very valuable. An old pho
tographer who haa spent two winters
in Manitoba, where it gets as cold as
it does in Alaska, says the best thing
to do is to get a shutter without a
spiral spring. Or, better still, don't use
a shutter at all, but make all exposure.
except when there are moving objects,
with the cap.
Which advice is very pood, provid
ing it is a professional who is going
to do the work. Straight spring shut
ters are hard to handle, and to use the
cap requires great skill at judging
time. The amateur can only use the
spiral spring shutter such as is put
into most hand cameras.
In order to make this work prop
erly and accurately in very cold
weather one important bit of common
sense is necessary. And this is:
NEVER TAKE YOUR CAMERA
INTO A WARM ROOM. Leave it in
its case out in the snow if you can do
no better.
The physical conditions that indicate
this are very pimple. Suppose the cam
era is in perfect condition and has
been used satisfactorily out in a t'jm
perature of about 20 below zero. It
must follow that the spiral spring must
soon become of the same temperature,
But this does not affect it, providing no
dampness strikes it.
But suppose the cold spring be car
ried into a warm room, which is sure
to be moist. Instantly this moisture
condenses on the cold spring, the
same as the drops collect on the
outside of a pitcher of ice
water on a summer day.
Even in this there is no
harm, for it will be
found that the shut
ter, with th* con
densed moisture
still clinging
to the spiral
spring be
carried
out of
\
o
doors
H-t once
it freezes
and fails to
you have to use
a spiral spring
shutter fix up a place
where you can leave it
out of doors all winter.
Zero temperature will not
hurt it if it is kept dry.

OVER THE CHILCOOT PASS
ON A WHISTLING TROLLEY
Up-to-Date .Methods Used by the Spring Stampede of Cold-
JHunters Into the Klondike.
NEVER before in the history of
the world has so much inventive
ingenuity been devoted to the
transportation problem as has
been done In conquering the
Chilcoot Pass.
The problem that confronted the In- .
ventors is unparalleled. An icy wall
,- over a thousand feet high and thou
sands of tons of freight -waiting to be
hauled to the top. The owners of the
freight ready a.nd willing to pay almost
any price providing the freight was
moved quickly.
There was no time to figure on put
ting up an elaborate plant. Something
must be produced that could be erected
in a few weeks, with inexpensive ma
terial, and at the same time be prac
tical. There was thousands of dollars
rt to back any idea that seemed
feasible.
As usual, American inventors have
proved themselves equal to the occa
sion, for the result of a few months'
work is the creation of the most mar
velous transportation devices in exist
ence. Engineers of the Old World stand
aghast at such daring originaJity, such
bold and practical application of the
most simple principles.
And when the "roads" were in work
ing order such scenes were enacted on
the icy slopes of grim Chilcoot as were
never before witnessed in the history of
the world, and most likely never will
be again. The descriptions of the
scenes, even when from the lips of
those who were there, hardly seem real.
And yet no writer of romance ever
penned anything half so wonderful.
Mr. P. Bernhard, whose residence is
510 Fulton street, this city, is one of the
very few men who left San Francisco
this year, went over the Chilcoot Pass
as far as Lake Bennett, and came back
again. Mr. Bernhard's return was to
get medical treatment, and he made the
round trip from this city in a little over
eight weeks. He is now in good health
soon go
back to
Alaska. I
reached the bot
tom of Chilcoot
Pass early In April,"
Faid Mr. Bernhard,
when speaking of his trip,
"and was so surprised at the
many things I saw that I hard
ly knew what to do. It was right
in the height of the rush. Such
crowds of gold hunters and such
piles of freight, such apparent confu
sion, % and yet everything going on as
smooth as possible.
"There was a party of seven of us all
bound for Dawson. and not one of us
knew anything about the kind of life
we were thrown into. But it didn't
take us long to learn, because we were
willing to take advantage of other peo
ple's experience. Trolley roads, ice
stairs, slides, packers and customs offi
cers were the principal problems that
confronted us.
"We found four trolley roads over the
Chiicoot Pass and a couple of slides
for sleds. We had plenty to choose
from for the transportation of our
goods.
"The most wonderful of these roads
was the one called the 'Scales' road. It
simply carried goods from the bottom
of the pass to the top. All there was
to it was a heavy cable stretched from
the top of the pass to the bottom. On
this cable were buckets, swung onto
wheels, that were hauled to the top of
the pass by a steam engine. There
were two buckets and each could carry
about 500 pounds. They made the round
trip in about fifteen minutes and were
kept busy all cay long. There were no
supports to this cable, except at the
ends, and in one place it swung about
300 feet above the ground. This cable
road charged 5 cents a pound to take
freight from the bottom of the pass to
the top.
"The other big trolley road was
known as the Dyea and Klondike
Transportation Company and made^ a
business of carrying goods from Can
yon City to Lake Lindermann, for
which they charged 7% cents a pound.
This road was laid on poles about fifty
feet high and the boxes ran on a wire
cable in the same manner as on the
Scales road. Each box could carry 100
pounds and they had hundreds of
boxes. The goods were carried in the
boxes only as far as the summit, when
the company transferred them to pack
ers who took them to Lake Bennett.
"The other cable road was much the
same as the others, except that it ran
close to the ground and .was quite
slow. This was worked by a gasoline
engine.
"The fourth contrivance was simply
a pulley drum and gasoline engine at
the summit of the pass and enough
rope to reach the bottom. Sleds were
hitched onto this rope, which was
wound around the drum, and it pulled
to the
top. For
this service
4 cents a pound
was charged.
There were also a
number of other
schemes of a similar
character, but all working
about the same way and
charging about the same for
service. Plenty of Indians were
loafing around, anxious to carry
freight for any sum they could get.
Their business has been abso
lutely ruined, but they have only
themselves to blame for it. Those
that do get work make it a
point to carry all they can possibly
lift. I have seen some fellows going
up the trail as easily as if they were
empty handed, with six sacks of flour
on their back. Whenever a man gets
hold of some light stuff he fastens it
on some way, even if it makes a bun
dle three times his own size.
"After considering all these plans we
determined to do our own carrying.
We figured that we could save about
$75 by the operation. And we suc
ceeded in about three days and I en
joyed my part of it. First we sledded
all our goods from Dyea to Sheep
Camp. Then we took them all to the
Scales and commenced the climb. Of
course it meant several trips up and
down the pass.
"By taking our place in the line of
men climbing the pass it would take
from thirty-five to forty-five minutes
to reach the top if we didn't stop to
rest. Some men took several hours to
reach the top. They could go only a
few hundred steps, when they would
have to stop and rest. How such men
could expect to stand the hardships of
the country Is more than I can under
stand.
"After we had one load of stuff at
the top and went back for another we
had our fun. Of course, the snow
hadn't even started to melt and walk
ing down was bad. To overcome this
we simply slid down.
"The surface is too steep and slip
pery for a sled or anything hard, so I
used to take a bundle of grain sacks
and tie them together, so as to make
a soft seat. Placing these under me
I would push off from the top and slide
into space like lightning. The first
time I tried it I wished I was back as
soon as I started, but after a short dis
tance I began to feel the exhilaration
of it and it was fine. There was a
good deal of bumping, but the sacks
saved any hard shocks and I flew alongr
like lightning. I tell you it was fine.
It used to take bout six minutes to
go from top to bottom. I enjoyed
every trip I made.
"When we had all our stuff at the
top our next problem was the British
customs officers. But we had been
told what to do and really had no trou
ble and got off easy. We made out a
list of our stuff, item for item, but did
more than a
third. Taking:
this to an officer I
pointed out our pile of
goods and handed him
the list. "Without even
looking at our stuff he did a
little multiplication and said,
'Twenty dollars and 40 cents.' I
paid the money in exact change,
but before handing me a receipt he
said, 'Now $5 for sinkerage.'
"Handing over $5 I asked him what
'sinkerage' was.
" 'For this,' he answered, as hÂ»
dropped it into his own pocket. Of
course I said nothing, but took the re
ceipt, knowing that we were about $50
ahead of the Canadian treasury aB it
was. A man who was just behind me
refused to pay sinkerage and the of
ficial simply made him open his pack
age and he had to pay about $50, when
he could have gotten off with $25.
"When we reached Lake Bennett thÂ«
boat building as at its greatest How
many m n were there I cannot tell,
but the country _or over a surface of
several square miles was simply cov
ered with boats in various stages' ofj
completion. And the hammering and
the sawing. I can hear It yet. I am
sure no boom cit. ever created such a
noise. From a t* stance it was a dull*
roar and near by it was simply deaf-|
ening.
"It was while we were going down,
the slope to Lake Lindermann that'
I got hurt by a sled running into me.'
But I kept on and went as far as Lake
Bennett before I was compelled to take
to my bed. A complication of trou-i
bles then set in and I had to go back;
to Lindermann for medical treatment, j
"When I was able the doctor advised!
me to go back to San Francisco for a
slight operation. I didn't slide down,
Chilcoot this time, but I got here all
right and am all well now. You will]
see me back In Alaska soon. I wish
I was there now, for it is the liveliest'
place on earth."

dollars a ton. The voyage may occupy
anywhere between four and six months
and even with the best of luck only one
round trip can be made in a year. Con
sequently working expenses have to be
reduced in every possible way, and the
smallest possible crew, consistent with
safety, is carried. Even the Roanoke,
enormous though her size be, carries
only thirty a'l told and of these twenty
two are foremast hands. Forty years
ago a ship one-third her size would
have carried at least double the num
ber of men.
The decay of American shipping since
the year 1860, when the trade reached
its highest level, is an oft told Btory.
Every one knows how the Southern
cruisers swept the American clipper
from the face of the sea, inflicting a
blow from which the foreign-going
trade has never recovered. In 1859 67
per cent of the goods imported into this
country were carried in American ships,
in 1897 the percentage had fallen to 11.
That means that the United States was
only able to carry in her own ships
about a tenth of the goods she re
quires from abroad, the balance of the
carrying trade, with all its profits, go
ing to foreigners.
It is improbable that this state of
affairs will continue much longer.
There is every reason to hope for the
future, and I am sure that the low
water mark of the foreign shipping
trade has been reached. It is not
merely the war which killed the Ameri
can mercantile marine; it was the uni
versal substitution of iron for wood as
a shipbuilding material. Naturally the
ships needed by the world were built
in the country which could manufac
ture iron most cheaply. England hap
pened at the moment to be in the fore
front in this business, and the result
is that during the past forty years she
has built up an enormous shipbuilding
industry, turning out more vessels than
all the rest of the world combined. The
British flag is to be found on every sea;
she does most of the carrying trade of
the world, and last year her total ton
nage, steam and sail, reached an aggre
gate of 13,482,876 tons. Against this
ing. July 4, at Wells 1 Hall, 1901 Post

the United States, which is second on
the list, though a long way behind,
could only show a total of 2.326.83S tons.
And as far as the foreign-going trade
is concerned the disparity is even
greater than these figures indicate, for
at least one-half of the American ton
nage is employed on the inland lakes
and rivers. Germany comes third on
the list, with 2,029,912 tons; then Nor
way and France.
The delay in the dispatch of the mili
tary expedition to the Philippines has
given the people of San Francisco and
the Union generally a forcible object
lesson on the scarcity of American ton
nage. With the best intentions in the
world ii has taken the authorities a
month to get together vessels sufficient
for the transportation of 7000 troops.
And even though the foreign trade of
the port has been paralyzed, and every
stoamor suitable for the work Im
pressed, enough American steamers
could not be found. Steamship lines
doing an extensive trade have been re

tain their services will be forced to
charter foreign ships. The Peter Jeb
son, a Norwegian, is now on her way
to Manila under the American flag,
having been bought outright by the
navy. The Nero, formerly the British
collier Whitgift, has also been trans
ferred, the China has been taken from
the Hawaiian Hag, also the Zealandia,
and at one time it was proposed to
purchase the old Centennial from the
Danish. There are plenty of other for

glad to get hold of, but technical diffi
culties bar the way. English vessels
must be bought outright, not chartered,
because British law requires that be

must be a bona fide sale to a foreigner.
Then, to bring these ships on the
American registry, a special act of Con

as the Empress of India, cannot be ac

the British naval reserve and are sub

that they may be held in reserve as

other cases, such as the China steam

again find herself so helpless on
the seas. Economic conditions have
changed greatly since 1860 and Amer
ica is now able to produce the steel
required for shipbuilding quite as
cheaply as England. Therefore there
is no reason why she should not build
her own vessels. San Francisco has
already shown that she can turn out
warships equal to any in the world,
the Eastern shipyards are already de
veloping with vast strides and their
work is sure to- receive a great impe
tus owing to the increase in the navy
which is bound to follow on the present
war. The United States has assumed
responsibilities which it cannot ignore;
more merchant vessels will be required
to trade with our newly acquired pos
sessions, more men-of-war will be re
quired to prutect them from foreign
intrusion. And with shipyards every
where in full swing, with steel at the
lowest price, there is every hope that
the mercantile marine of the country
will soon be restored to its former con

PETS OF THE SOLDIERS
AND SAILORS.
Continued from Page Twenty.
them in India, and whose ci ding is full
of pathos. It is not the practice to
carry horses between India and Eng
land, when a regiment is ordered home
its mounts are left behind for the ben
efit of the next comers. As Black Bob
was too old for further military ser
vice he was put up at auction and sold
for a large sum. The troopers were
so full of regret at the loss of their pet
that they returned the buyer half his
purchase money, on condition that
Black Bob should be well fed and
treated for the remainder* of his life.
The horse could distinguish the trum
pets of his regiment from those of any
other corps, and when he heard the
Hussars marching past his stables on
their way to England he nearly killed
himself in his struggles to escape. He
resolutely refused to eat and drink, and
at fast he was turned loose in a field.
Easily jumping the fence Bob trotted
to the old 'amiliar parade ground,
wheeled at the saluting post, and stood
aghast to find that none of his old com
rades were there. The shock was too
much for the faithful animal; he
quietly laid himself down and died on
the ground where he had so often ex
ercised.
Probably this was the horse which
gave Kipling the idea for a couple of his
best stories. In "The Man Who Was,"
the returning officer, the victim of Rus
sian brutality, recognizes his regiment
and proves his own identity through the
picture of the drum horse. In another
story, written In lighter vein, the drum
horse, after being sentenced to death,
is resuscitated by the soldiers and cre
ates a panic by his ghostly reappear
ance.
There are innumerable instances as
dogs as regimental pets, in fact, no an
imal takes to soldiering more kindly.
When the Sixty-sixth Regiment was
fighting the rebels in India a very fine
spaniel, afterward known as Cheeky,
deserted from the mutineers and made
himself at home in the English lines.
Cheeky fought with his regiment
through the whole of the campaign.
His one idea, when in action, was to
amuse himself by chasing spent can
non balls, which he would pursue until
he had caught and stopped them. Luck
ily for him the rebels were not using
live shell.
The One Hundred and Second Regi
ment once brought a tiger home from
India as a pet. As long as the animal
was young he proved an immense suc
cess, and was on good terms with every
one. from the drummer boy to the col
onel. But when the corps was quar
tered at Dover Castle, an old lady in
the town took It into her head that the
beast might escape from his friends
and run amuck through the streets. So
she shut herself up in her house and
spent her time in writing letters of
complaint to the colonel. The nuisance
I at last became so great that the tiger
had to be presented to the Zoo, where
| he developed into a very fine beast. Ho
! was on the most intimate terms with
| a dog, who also accompanied him into
! captivity, and the pair had always the
I warmest greeting for every man in

AND HOW TO LAUNDER THEM
NEW YORK, June 25.â There are
such beautiful things for the
neck this summer that a
woman does not need to dress
well. By dressing "well" I
mean that she does not need to dress
expensively.
This is best shown by an illustration.
Last Sunday evening the writer dined
at the most elegant hotel in New York.
It is famous the world over for its palm
pardf-ns, its picture galleries and its
magnificent dining ir irimonts.
One of the most tastefully dressed
women in the room was gowned in â 
black surah, which, as you know, Js not
an expensive fabric. Tho surah dress,
complete with Its blouse waist and ruf
fled skirt, did not cost over $20, but the
dress was noticeable for its beauty.
It had a yoke of burnt orange velvet,
with jet around the yoke. The collar

was of jet. The upper part of the waist
was jetted and around the belt was
clasped a pretty jetted band. The burnt
orange velvet showed off under the elec
trlc lights with dazzling brilliancy, and
the wearer, who is quite brunette, en
: the admiration of all who saw
her.

THE FAT WOMAN AND THE THIN GIRL AND
THEIR WOES.
ssÂ« Â»Â»Â»aÂ» Â»0 Â»a 0a Â» a *
SO MANY distressful wails have
reached me from those who are
overburdened with flesh, as well
as from a few who covet nothing
in life so much as a little fat with
which to cover their unsightly bones,
that I have decided to devote my talk
this week to them.
It makes me think of the old conundrum
as to why matrimony is like a city in
a state of siege, the answer to which is
"Because those who are out of it want
to get in, and those who are in want to
get out " So it is with these girls, those
who are fat want to get thin, and those
who are thin want to get fat. Oh girls,
,Â£;irls! why is it that you are never satia
ted? l
There Is a popular belief that fat people
are always good natured, but this is not
so for an excess of adipose tissue is v.
disease as much as anything else, ana
causes irritability rather than good na
'' You may "laugh and grow fat," but af
ter you have acquired unwieldy bulk, you
will doubtless feel little to
make merry over it.
Of course heredity and predisposition
have much to do with both corpulence
and leanness, but it is a fact just the same
that flesh can be taken off and put on
at will. It is largely a matter of diet and
exercise. â  .
To those who wish to reduce their flesh
let me say, first of all, don't take any
of the anti-fat pills and medicines so
largely advertised. Abjure all drugs, pat
ented or otherwise. You can reduce your
flesh permanently only by a thorough
change of diet and life, assisted by con
tinuous exercise. It is not necessary to
starve oneself, for while we starve, we
lose albumen, which is the principal ele
ment of the blood and muscles. This
brings about impoverishment of the blood
and may impair the health to such an
extent as to endanger life.
Remember that your mortal foes are all
sugary .and starchy foods. Substitute
toast for bread, religiously avoid all fats
and fattening vegetables, such as rice, j
potatoes, turnips and beets. Eat spar
ingly of butter and the more lemonade j
you drink the better. Drink little cof
fee and no milk.
Get up early in the morning, never sleep
more than seven hours, and walk, and
exercise all that you can. Take hot baths, ;
not remaining in them long enough, how
ever for them to debilitate. Anything
that induces perspiration takes off super
fluous flesh; so does physical exertion.
There Is nothing better to reduce avoir
dupois than doing one's own housework.
After the bath take a series of gymnastio
exercises. â  ' ' â¢. â¢ "- â 
Trousseau, a celebrated French phy
sician, advised two grammes of bicarbon
ate of soda at each meal.
Now for the thin girls. - A girl should
be plump enough to be pleasing to the j
eye That Is, no angles or bones should ':
be apparent, but there should be a round

out and fit it upon the shoulders. Take
Jt off. line with silk and edge it with
passementerie. If desired the collar can
be striped with tiny bands of black vel
vet, with jet below. This can be worn
over any dress, and it can be made eas
ily for $2â perhaps less.
The latest thine out in round yokes is
made in three shades of one color. Al
mond leaf, Nile and bottle green make a
Uful round yoke. The rule for this
is to use the least amonut of the dark
est shade. For example, the ribbon
around the neck ami the bow at the
back of the neck are of almond leaf
green; thÂ»> yoke part is of Nile green
an â¢!. the tir.y bands that stripe the yoke
are of bottle green. This makes a" de
lightful nock piece, which is very easily
made by one's own hands. All of these
yokes are detachable from the dress, bo
that one yoke can be worn over a great
many plain waists. Care must be taken,
however, to have the yoke meet in the
back. This can only be done by arrang
ing it so that there is a little fullness,
or the yoke is i erpetually coming open
like a pocket-hole.
Square yokes are very English. Thpy
are made of big plaids trimmed with
bands of brocaded ribbon. In the neck is
a very large ruffle of chiffon or lace, with
a little front of the same.
It would be idle to attempt to describe
all the different kinds of fancy neckwear

legion to mention. It would seem as

starchy, fattening food, such as rice, but
ter, cereals, eggs, milk and game. Hot
chocplate and preserved figs are both
guaranteed to make a regular museum
fat lady of one if their consumption be
persisted in.
Get all the sleep you can, and before
rising take a cup of hot milk or of milk
and cocoa well sugared. Take topid baths
and exercise moderately. Tapioca, sago,
vermicelli or custard pudding, macaroni,
cheese, salad served with plenty of oil,
but no vinegar or pickles, can be indulged
in. A teaspoonful of pure olive oil taken
several times a day, and frequent rub
bings of the body with olive oil will help.
Eat frequently. The harem ladles
amuse themselves all day long eating
bonbons and dried fruits. But, above all,
there must be absolute freedom from
nerves, care and anxiety, if one wishes to
be rotund.
Now, I am going to give you all a per
fectly lovely recipe for a skin whitenei.
It is:
CUCUMBER MILK.
Oil of sweet almonds, 4 ounces;
fresh cucumber juice (boiled), 10
ounces; white castile soap, V*
ounce. Dissolve in 3 ounces of es
sence of cucumbers and 1-20 ounce
of tincture of benzoin.
Buy the ordinary cucumbers now sold
in the shops. Cut up in small . pieces,
neither peeling nor removing the seeds,
and pour on just enough water to start
them to cooking. When cooked soft and
mushy strain through a piece of muslin.
The essence you can make yourself by
taking one and one-half ounces of alcohol
and one and one-half ounces of the boiled
cucumber Juice. Add to this your castile
soap and let it stand for several hours,
until' the soap has entirely dissolved.
Then put in your cucumber juice, which
is strained and cold. Shake well, so that
all are thoroughly mixed. Then add the
oil of sweet almonds and the benzoin,
stirring for some time. Put in. a bottle
and be sure and shake well before using.
Apply it at night, letting it dry on the
skin and rinsing away in tepid^rtvater the
following morning.
The natural arsenic In the cucumber
makes this a ppiendid face bleach, and it
is perfectly harmless.

though each dress had its own peculiar
neck trimming, which is adapted in style
and color to its own mater'al.
A great deal of mull in all colors is be
ing worn for the neck. This is very tidy,
as it can be washed. An absolutely fresh
appearance is an essential for anything
that goes around the neck.
It is an undeniable fact, although no
one likes to admit it on account of its
cost, that nothing looks so well next to
the neck as white. White is a beautiful
color. A woman wearing a white dress in
a ballroom is as conspicuous as a white
mark upon a dark wall. The eye is be
wildered by the great variety of colors
and seeks rest in the spotless white.
A gentleman who is as unscrupulous in
fashion matters as was the late Ward
McAllister recently remarked- to a fash
ion writer that the woman who did not
wear white next to her neck made a
great mistake. "If she can afford it she
shourd always wear a white collar or a
white ruffle or something white to set off
her face. This gives an indescribable del
icacy and gentleness to the chin and
neck, like a flower set in white sepals."
That is all very well to sayâ namely,
that a woman must always wear white
next to her neck, but the fact remains
that white is very expensive and when it
comes to the fluffy delicate yokes of sum
mer they mount up in a way that is posi
tively startling.
The mull yokes have one delightful ad
vantage, howeverâthat they can be easi
ly done up. The solution for doing them
up, if they are white, consists of soap
bark, ammonia and hot water. The yoke?
are thrown into the solution and left to
soak over night. Next morning tfiey ire
placed in a fresh hot solution, after whfteh
they are delicately and carefully clapped
through the hands. Hot water is run
over them and all the dirt will be found
to have disappeared.
As a final touch a little bluing must
be added to the water or the mull will
have a dingy look after it is put on. If
an ecru shade is desired a little coffee can
be added to the water.
For colored mulls and other delicate
goods a different process must be fol
lowed. Soak them over night in salt and
water. In the morning wash in soap bark
and cold water, using as much force as
can be employed without destroying the
goods. ,
Taffeta, fine silks and even satin can be
freely washed in gasoline. .
Have you ever tried to launder a real
nice dress without taking it apart? sup
pose you have a last summer's challie
trimmed with silk and lace, it is soiled.
5 ,-. sajr and you want to renovate it.
Have you ever tried the simple process of
washing it In soap bark and water. Soak
it over night, as described before and fol
low the cold laundry process.
If there is a great deal of silik use clear
gasoline, but be extremely careful not to
ignite it. This must be done strictly in
the day time and care must be *aken not
to rub" the goods hard enough to cause
the slightest friction or there may be an
explosion. The writer has, however, for
several seasons washed kid gloves anad
silk waists freely in gasoline without
trouble. Place into the gasoline dry and
rub very little. The dirt disappears.
The hardest part comes in the ironing,
but to iron the dress you have only to go
to work as though you were ironing a
cambric wrapper. Iron as much as you
can or" it. carefully pressing out the ruf
iles and the lace. When you have gone
over it you will be surprised to see how
few spots remain unpressed. You can do
more than you think you can. The dress
i<? really presentable. Now use your in
genuity in getting at the out-of-the-way
places and you will be rewarded with B
very nice summer dress instead of a soiled
old "one. . .
The very nicest pink lawns and the most
delicate blue ones can be done up by soak-
Ing in salt and water over night. Let the
laundress wash them in the morning in
the first water, and hang In the shade un
til they are dry. A pink lawn can be car
ried through two summers in this way
without once losing a trace of color.
For ironing purposes deep ruffles for the
neck should be made upon little bands.
The bands are tacked in the neck of silk
waists. When the rufflfS are soiled the
bands can be ripped out and the ruffle
can be done up. This applies to all the
very fine, showy, white embroidered neck
s, which you see so plentifully in silk
Tucked yokes are very hard to iron. It
is very slow, careful work which should
be done by the hand of the mistress her
self unless she employs a professional
laundress. It is pretty work and nice
work for a woman, and she need not hesi
tate to do it. Iron the tucked yoke first
upon the wrong side. Turn it over and
lift the tucks with a knife. Damp lightly
and iron each tuck separately, then give
a final sweep of the iron. Many laun
dresses leave th^ tucks decidedly raised,
as being better than flat.
The small polishing iron is necessary in
the summer trunk. Take along a bit of
eas pip* 1 . T'se the iron on all soft goods,
even to chiffon. HELEN WARD.
Apply witch hazel to the dark circles un
der the eyes. For the wrinkles, massage
with a good cold cream, being careful to
rub across the lines. Try a lotion of equal
parts of rosewater, fresh lemon juice and
rectified spirit for the freckles. Mix them
together, next day decant the clear por
tion and strain it through muslin. Bathe
the face night and morning with the lo
tion, wiping off with a soft towel.
SUSANNA J.â Tattooing is very difficult
to remove. There is a process which Is
often successful, but it is so severe and
painful that I feel\ quite certain you
would not wish to undergo it. If the In
dia ink is merely on the surface and not
pricked into the skin you might try io
dide of potash, although I cannot promise
you that it will be efficacious.
L. H.â For the red nose try frequent ap
plications of listerine or witch hazel, and
see to it that the clothing is loose, particu
larly about the waist and neck. Also soak
the hands and feet in hot water every
night.

that I have iUMt said to Annie O about

indicates a general perturbation of the
health. It may arise from indigestion

from tight lacing. It is also caused by
nervousness and hysteria, because the

you wish. Specialists guard their se
crets as they do their lives. If this were
not so, you would not have to pay such
; an exorbitant prico for the preparation
! you mention. Here is the formula for a
1 face bleach which T think is very much
I like the prepared article you have been
using: Take a pint of distilled water,
and from this take two ounces and heat
i it to boiling. In this dissolve four grains
] of bichloride of mercury and then add
! fifteen drops of alcohol. Mix one-half
i ounce of the host quality of zinc and ten
drops of glycerine. Add to this the rest
i of the pint of water and then stir the two
' mixtures together. Bottle and always
; shake well before using. Apply with
; sniall, soil sponge, and wipe off before
j the liquid dries. As this mixture con-
I tains bichloride of mercury I do not rec
ommend it, and would myself infinitely
prefer using the cucumber milk, formula
! for which is given in the last part of my
I talk.

do not recommend hair dyes. Most of
I them are poisonous and dangerous, or
â  else color the scalp and'give the head a
most uncleanly appearance. There is a
! tonic of claret and sulphate of iron
which has a slight coloring effect. The
proportions are one gram sulphate of
iron to sixty grains genuine claret. Boil
for one minute and when cold, bottle and
cork. Wash the hair with this twice a
week, allowing It to dry on. This
strengthens and Invigorates the hair
bulbs, and thus brings back the natural
tints. I cannot understand why any one
I objects to white hair. It softens the
lines of the face, and to my mind is very
beautiful. You might try clear claret on

GOOD WORK DONE BY
THE PATRIOTIC HOME HELPERS
THE call "to arms" that has sound
ed throughout our land has sum
moned from every large city, from
every little mountain town, from
villages and farms, men eager to
fight and, If necessary, to die for
their country, and in defense of
their flag.
The saying that "men must work and
women must weep" might very fitly be
changed to "men must fight and women
must comfort." Many of the soldiers who
marched away through a roar of wild
enthusiasm have left behind them rela
tives in need of more than comfort. Some
of these, even at this early date, are in
dire distress.
Upon the Red Cross Society has fallen
the brunt of all this wretchedness. Every
day wives, mothers, sisters and sweet
hearts come to their rooms, sometimes
but seeking information as to their loved
ones, for many a man enlisted and when
the time came to say good-by could not
"screw his courage to the sticking point,"
and left without even a farewell.
Cases of families left without money for
their immediate necessities have been re
ported every day, and in every instance
individual aid has been given. The work
that has been accomplished by the Red
Cross women is almost beyond belief to
one who has not actually seen it. While
they have lent always willing ears to
the confidences- which every arriving
troop has brought, they could not help
them more than with their sympathy.
And so the necessity arose for another
band of helpers. A number of patriotic
men and women met, confronted the
problem, and the Patriotic Home Help
ers' Society is the result. The officers
elected at the first meeting are:
Hon. W. W. Morrow, president; Hon.
James D. Phelan, first vice-president;
Major W. B. Hooper, second vice-presi
dent; Mrs. William Alvord, third vice
president; Mrs. H. A. Harland, secretary;
Bank of California, treasurer.
Executive boardâ Mrs. C. Mason Kinne,
Mrs. George W. Gibbs, Mrs. Lovell White.
Mrs. Walter E. Dean, Walter E. Dean,
Mrs. William Ashburner, Mrs. Horace L.
Hill, John M. Burnett, M. H. Hecht.

Drown, T. 11. Goodman, General J. F.
Houghton and J. i>. Stetson.
Advisory boardâ Horace L. Hill, A. N.
Drown, T. H. Goodman, General J. F.
Houghton and J. B. Stetson.
Finance committeeâ Colonel Currier, T.
L. Ford, Mrs. Lovell White, Mrs. George
W. Gibbs, Mrs. Dean, Major Hooper, and
W. E. Dean.
Relief committeeâ Mrs. W. W. Young,

Ashburner, Mrs. Horace Hill, Mrs. John
Moss, Mrs. Colonel Grannis, Mrs. James
Edwards, Mrs. Center, Mrs. J. J. Scoville,
W. E. Dean and Major W. B. Hooper.
On the membership roll are already ths
names of some of the most prominent
people of San Francisco.
This society has busied itself at the
ferry in connection with the Red Cross.
Nearly every soldier, when he arrived at
the ferry Red Cross rooms, to be fed, be
fore he started on his tramp to Camp
Merritt, has been glad to get the postal
cards which the patriotic Home Helpers
provided for him, on which to send a
cheering word to the anxious ones at
home.
One night at the ferry Red Cross rooms
a young soldier whistled, "The Girl I
Left Behind Me." A youth standing near
turned to him and said, fiercely, "For
God's sake shut up. 1 didn't dream what
whistling meant."
Carried away by his enthusiasm he had
enlisted without serious thought. It was
<i typical case.
There is something inspiring in the
bravery of the departed soldiers; there is
something pitiful in the courage of the
women who have been left at home to
fight the stern battle of poverty. In al
most every case it is work and not money
that is asked, and their cheerfulness and
resignation, their willingness to do labor
of any kind tug at the heartstrings and
bring tears to the eyes. Pathos and
humor, that is not without its tinge of
sadness, rub elbows.
With the husband gone many a woman
must face the commonplace, stern ques
tions, "How can I manage to pay the
rent? How can I get the mopey to buy
three meals a day for the children?"
It is a vulgar, commonplace, every-day
trouble, and within the four walls of her
home she must think it out alone.
In speaking of her experiences Mrs.
Harland, the secretary of the society,

* There is, however, one field which the Red Cross has not en- Â®

1 occupy. When the bread-winner of a family Is taken away some one ;*T
1 else must take up the burden which he lays down. Many of the volun
1 teers expect to send back their pay, but they will have expenses they did **%
<$> not count upon. They will be in a strange country, and maybe sick,
< j > . wanting what in ordinary circumstances they would not think of. "[

paid: "It is so heart-breaking I am some
times almost afraid I cannot stand the
work. The women are all so sad over the
parting that the money part of it seems
trivial. Many of them talk so simply and
patriotically of their husbands or sons
j going, and do not seem to know how
bravely they are facing their loss ; We
want baby clothes, and wish those who
have little things that mothers need,
would send them to us. We must pro
vide for more than one or two little 'war
have little things that mothers need
to make them comfortable. Materials and
! clothing will be just as acceptable as
money. We need workers, too, to visit
and help in every way."
One woman came to Mrs. Harland ana
asked her, smiling through her tears, if
she would not help her to get work by
the day. "My husband has enlisted, and
there's nothing for me and the children.
Hut I've two strong hands and I'm willing
|to work and let him fight. You pee,
madam, if I could get work by the day I
could be with the children at night."
"But who will take care of them dur
ing the daytime?" asked Mrs. Harland,
glancing at a little girl not over 7, who
was holding the hands of two other chil
dren yet younger.
"Oh," said the woman, pointing to the
little girl, "Nellie can take care of them,
can't you, Nellie?"
"Yes, ma'am," answered the tot, "they'll
be all right ef I looks out for 'em," and
she drew herself up in a manner that
sat incongruously on her 7 years.
"Any way," the mother continued,
growing communicative under the kind
ly smile that met her, "any way, the
children are so good they won't be any
trouble. Johnnie is the best little boy
you ever saw. He says he is going to
be a policeman when he grows up."
"Don't want to be a cop," bawled
Johnnie, "I wants to be a soldier."
Upon being promised that he could
change his first love and be a soldier
when he was "growed up" his tears
ceased.
A young woman with a sweet dimpled
face," a girl who had married at 16, who
now has a boy 4 years old and another
aged six months, wants to get sewing
to do at home. As she sat with the baby
In her lap -while the small boy held tight
to baby's hand and looked up shyly from
under his yellow curls, she happily did
not realize how serious was the outlook, j
"It is such a fix to be in, with no !
money. George has been trying to get :
his money and can't. He is a musician
and played in a saloon, but the man
kept getting behind with his wages, ana j
George had no money to go to law, so
what could we do? Well, George de- !
cided to go to Manila. Pay in the army '
is sure, and we didn"t think he'd have â 
to wait two months for it. We didn't j
think it would be quite so hard, but I
can sew, and Georgie is a big boy and
takes care of the baby, don't you, Geor- I
gie? Hold up your head, and tell the ;
lady your name. He's awful bashful and i
ain't used to strangers."
Another case was that of a girl of 17.
Her husband sailed on the first expedi- J
tion. He left an order for her to draw ;
his pay, and they supposed it would be
a.i right, but there has been no provi
sion made by the Government to cash
the orders for the privates.
"It's my own fault," she said. "I kept
rowing with Tom, and he always said
ONE OF THE MOST FASHIONABLE OF THE SUMMER DESIGNS.
he wouldn't stand it, so, one day we
quarreled, and lie enlisted. We made ii
up and he was sorry. He'd rather quar
rel with me than go to war. but he's
gone now, and if he ever comes back I'll
be a better wife to him. Tom's a good
boy, and I ain't half good enough for
him."
She had been a nursemaid, ari*'l wants
a home now, where she can work. She
has used up nearly all her money, and
must give up the three rooms that have
been her home.
A German woman with eight children
needs help, too. She wants to get wash
ing or scrubbing or any work, and is
strong and neat and intelligent. "Carl
had his courage clean knocked out of
him He -â  worked at the Union Iron
pp/r s > an fl -was, always having accidents.

up to leave -me and the children. He'll
get his pay regular In the army, and
though it isn't much we are used to not
having a great deal. The children are
getting bigger, and maybe the change
will be .what Carl need."
How patient and strong and true the
women of the poor so often are, women
Â.. are ."used to not having a great

two children. The man has been out of,
work for more than a year, with the ex
ception of a few odd jobs. They had been,
very comfortable and had laid up quite a j
sum, but the money has 1 een gone for
some time now, and they know what
it is to be hungry. The woman has never
been strong, and is not able to do more
than care for their one room and the
children. The boy, a d,ear little fellow of
eight, says he can eatn enough to keep
them all. He is so confident of success,
in spite of the failure there has been in
his home, and already assumes command \
of the small sister, who runs errands for
him, so that he need not leave the house,
"for," he says, "the lady has promised me.
some work, and she might send for me
while I was out."
To these simply told tales of sorrow and
privation the Patriotic Home Helpers are
constantly listening and doing all In
thoir power to alleviate the suffering.
At the earnest solicitation of Miss May
Hooper, who has placed parlor bq. of the
Occidental Hotel at the disposal of the
society, the Associated Charitifs has
been asked to assist in the investigation
of the cases that come in. This society
has trained visitors, accustomed to the
relief work, who can render a clear, un
biased report, not allowing their sympa
thy to run away with their judgment.
The work done by the Associated Cnari
ties. howover. does not interfere with the
visiting committee of the Patriotic Home
Helpers.
Often a case will be reported so urgent
as to require immediate relief, which is
given before the case can be referred to
the Associated Charities. This assist
ance from such a well established society
will inspire confidence in those who give
as to the wise disposal of their money.
It will also protect the Patriotic Homo
Helper? from professional beggars until
their own corps of workers has been ef
ficiently organized.
The society has formed an employment
bureau, which will be one of its chief ob
jects. While most of the women must
have sucn work as can be done at home,
there are others who are anxious to find
employment that will give them a home
as well.
Already a number of enthusiastic peo
ple are hard at work setting up entertain
ments to raise funds for the society.
GIVING ONE'S WEIGHT IN GOLD.
-xi May 8, 1885, Kama Varma, the Ma
harajah, or "Great King"â the highest
title now held by any Hindoo sovereign
â of Travancore, the southwesternmost
State of India, conformed to a pecu
liar custom which is always observed
once during the reign of each of, its
monarchs â a ceremony traceable back
to the fouith Christian century. It is
called "Tv '-^arani," which signifies
"scaleweighing," and consists in the
Maharajah being seated on the scale of
an ornamental balance, with his sword
and shield, which, of course, add largely
to the weight, while in the other scale
are heaped on gold coins, each < ? which
has the name of the god inscribed upon
it.
This Maharajah himself weighed
about 9 stone, or 126 pounds, and to bal
ance him alone would therefore require
about 7170 gold coins of the value of our
English sovereigns of Â£1 each. But the
clothing and armor so add to the
weight, that the ceremony in this re
spect generally costs about Â£12,000,
and there is an additional expendture
of about Â£4000 besides on these occa
sions. "â¢ : .
It has been stated that the money Is
afterwards dispensed in charity; but It
is really * distributed to the Brahmins,
who are the highest Hindoo caste, and
regarded as a most sacred one, and the
coin is divided aâ ong them in various
proportions, according to their dignity
and 1 claims. It therefore depends upon
the character of the recipients whether
any portion of the gift ever reaches
those who most need ! it.
The Maharajah had no long time for
accumulating kingly treasury. Though
born in 1837, he had succeeded on the
j><3><S> <sÂ»> <s><s>' W<s> <3> V<3> â¦ <S> <J> <S> <$> <$> â¦
throne his brother, Vanchi Bala Rama
Varma. as lately as 1880, and he died
the same year that he bestowed this
gift of his weight in gold; the present
Maharajah succeeding him on August
19, 1885. Though his kingdom covers an
area of 6730 square miles, and has a
population numbering 2,557,736, its rev
enue does not exceed 881,000 rupees, each
formerly worth 50 cents, but, owinj to
the depreciation in the value of silver,
i\ has sunk far below the $2,502,254 at
which is was estimated a few years ago.
A former Maharajah, probably because
his reign was so lengthened, went
through the ceremony a second time,
giving away, on this latter occasion,
his weight in silver, as a thanks offer
ing.

* MORE FEVEL/mOJ^S ABOUT THE PpiY/\JE LIFE OF Â»
| TH/\G]<EpAy. Â«
g BY HIS DAUGRTER, MRS. ANNE THACKERAY RITCHIE. g
SHB third volume of Mrs. Anne
Thackeray Ritchie's "Biographical
Edition" of her father's works con
sists of the Yellowplush andJeames
de la Pluche papers and of the ex
travaganzas and comicalities of
the Michael Angelo Tltmarsh period.
The Introduction, which comprises for
ty-two pages, illustrated with drawings
never before published, adds a special in
terest to this edition.
More and more as Mrs. Ritchie's
method unfolds itself does it become evi
dent that these introductions are in fact,
if not in form, chapters of biography,
which In their entirety will constitute
an official memoir of Thackeray. Mrs.
Ritchie deserves the thanks of all Thack
eraymanlacs for having disregarded the
spirit of her father's reported request
that no such memoir should ever appear.
His reputation has not suffered, but, on
the contrary, has gained considerably by
the revelations which his daughter
makes and allows him to make in the let
ters and autobiographical notes included
in her scheme.
The introduction to "Pendennis" dealt
mainly with Thackeray's school and uni
versity days. The present introduction
takes up the thread of the narrative
from that point and shows us the future
author in his early struggles for fame
and fortune in London.
He affiliated with several young men
who afterward reached the goal of simi
lar ambitions. Alfred and Frederick Ten
nyson, Edward Fitzgerald, Charles But
ler and John and Henry Kemble were
among them.
These young Knights of the Mahogany
Tree used to meet and play and work to
gether, or sit over their brandy and wa
ter discussing men and books and morals,
speculating, joking and contradicting one
anotherâ liking fun and talk and wit and
human nature and all fanciful and noble
things.
They all went their own ways. They
heartily admired one another (and no
wonder) and they encouraged the minor
graces as well as the major virtues.
Mrs. Ritchie quotes from a letter writ
! ten by Thackeray to Edward Fitzgerald
' after the latter's departure from London
in November, 1831.
"I don't think my rooms will ever ap
pear comfortable again," says the letter.
i "Here are your things lying in the exact
! place you left them. * * * The Kem
bles have calledâ J. yesterday, Henry to
day; he is a dear fellow, and we talked
; about nothing but you and the theater.
! * * â¦ " Then, again: "John Kemble
I stayed with me till 5 o'clock, when we set
forth on a walk; we went round the Re
1 gents Park, and he had the talk to hlm-
I self. It was agreeable enough; about his
! Spanish adventures, and his friend Gen
, eral Torrijo's exploits. He has asked me
â to his house. * â¢ * Mrs. Kemble has
i returned, leaving her daughter in Paris."
This was at the time Thackeray sat
1 every day In Lawyer Taprell's office
i perched on a high stool, drawing up legal
i documents. Mr. Taprell was a special
! pleader and conveyancer, and it would
â¢ be curious to come across a legai docu
j ment in his pupil's handwriting.
Almost a year before this time Thack
eray and his family had come to the eon
i elusion that he should go to the bar. He
i himself wus anxious to begin work.
i Writing to his mother from Germany.
I January 25. IS3I, he says: "I do believe,
| mother' that it is not merely an appetite
I for novelty which prompts me, but really
a desire to enter a profession and do my
' duty in it. I am nearly 20 years oldâ at
that time my lather had been for five
years engaged on his. I am fully aware
how difficult and disagreeable my task
1 must be for the first four years, but I
have an end in view and an independence
! to gain; and if I can steadily keep this
before me I shall not. I trust, flinch from
! the pursuit of thorn." By the autumn of
; that year the young student was. estab
lished in the fomplo.
But his fancies soon strayed from law
to literature. Perhaps it was his ac
aualntance with William Maginn. the
first professional litterateur with whom
he became intimately acquainted, that
formed the turning point In his career
The earliest mention of Maginn in the
tendance, and after the initiation of two i
candidates. Dr. J. P. Lefevre. on accouivt
of business engagements preventing hlni
from attending to the duties tendered his
resignation as one of the trustees, ana
in his place G. H. Daggett was elected
J J Cullen, the secretary, was installed
as treasurer for the balance of the cur
rent term, he filling both offices.
It was decided that the members of
the Guild are to have a private picnic m
one of the groves at Haywards on the
10th of July. It is expected that there
will be about 150 persons present. At tnÂ«
meeting there was the assurance of sixty,
and it was stated that a number who
were not In attendance had signified their
intention of going on that outing.
FORESTERS OF AMERICA.
Court Golden Era celebrated Bunker
Hill day by a grand high jinks In its
hall in the Alcazar building. There was
presented a varied programme which In
cluded patriotic addresses and entertain
ing numbers. There were present Captain
Wnnkowsky of the Seventh California
Volunteers and a number of non-com
missioned officers and privates of the
same regiment who are members of the
order In the southern part of the State.
The opening address was by H. K. Asher,
G. S. W., who delivered an eloquent pa
triotic oration that voiced the sentiments
of all present, judging from the wild ana
I prolonged applause with which It was re
ceived. Then followed the programme
that had for its features: Banjo solo,
Harry Weaver; comic stories, T. F. Ed
wards; boxing exhibit, Charles Pk-kara
and Otto Jackson; "Our Order," Grand
Secretary John J. Cordy; wrestling match,
L. Manlock and Joe Meagles; mandolin,
and guitar selections, C. Belasco and F.
Bodrigue; humorist sallies, J. Laboeman;
Messrs. Goldstone and Walker, piano and
mandolin selections; vocal selections by
the Bolaway quartet; feats of juggling,
E. A. Smith; stump speech by Ed A.
Smith, and a comic story or two by L.
}luss; William Gall was "the clown or the
evening." The committee furnished cigars
and refreshments and all had a pleasant
time.
At the meeting of Court Sutro Heights
last Thursday night W. P. Burnham and
Charles Abraham were Initiated into the
mysteries of the order. After the regular
business, Sam Yehl, the accomplished or
ganist of tiu' court, entertained with se
lections on the piano and then furnlsned
entertainment with selections on the
phonograph. J. W. Richardson rendered
choice music on the mandolin, George J.
Strong and L. N. Boukofsky delighted the
court with vocal music and several other
members contributed to a pleasant even
ing's enjoyment.
COMPANIONS OF THE FOREST,
F. OF A.
Last Monday night the members of
Loyal Circle of Oakland, wishing to honor
Mrs. Flora Jacobs, who at the last held
sossion of the Grand Circle was elected
grand subchief companion, tendered her a
surprise reception in Giers HaJl. She had
been notified that as right guide she
would be expected at a stated hour to be
on hand to take her part in the initiatory
work. When she arrived she was ushered
into the ante-room, where, instead of
finding a candidate, she discovered, to her
surprise, more than a hundred Compan
ions, who greeted her with a very cordial
welcome. She was then escorted to the
main hall, where there was spread a
bountiful collation, which had been ar
ranged under the direction of the com
mittee, consisting of M. E. Harris, P.
C. C. Mrs. H. Ross, Mre. R. Cohn, H. W.
Ross, Henry Cohn and Max E. Licht.
Among those present were* Ira D. Co
burn, G. C. C; Mrs. Jacobs, the guest of
honor; Mrs. Emma Harrington, P. G. C.
C and V. G. H. B. ; Miss A. D. Bremer,
grand recording secretary: Grand Trus
tees Mrs. Kemp Van Ec and Mrs. Davis,
Grand Right Guide Miss M. Foye and a
number of members of circles on the other
and this side of the bay, prominent among
the latter being a large delegation from
Palo Alto Circle.
During the evening there was an ad
dress or welcome and congratulation to
diary which young Thackeray kept in
those days occurs under date of Wednes
day, May 2, 1832.
"Dr. Maginn called and took me to the
Standard, showing me the mysteries of
printing and writing leading articles.
With him all day till 4. Dined at the Sab
lonnlere."
Next day he dines with Dr. Maginn at
the King's Head. "A dull party of low
literary men." "Wrote yesterday to E.
F. G. with a letter as from Herrick. Might
have been made pretty, but was poor
enough. How can a ninn know his own
capabilities? Not by reading, by which I
one acquires thoughts of others and gives
one's self the credit of them. Bulwer has
a high reputation for talent, and yet I
always find myself competing with him."
Then, again, a little further on: "Ma
ginn with me all the morning, one of the
pleasantest I ever passed. Maginn read
Homer to me and he made me admire It
as I had never done before; moreover, he
made me make a vow to read some Homer
every day, which vow I don't know
whether I shall keep."
"Here is the day for which I have been
panting so long. He was now of agw,
and his own master. The first use he
made of his freedom was to throw away
his law books and set out for Paris to
study the art and literature of the gay
European capital.
In July, 1833. he writes to his mother
from Paris that he has been thinking very
seriously of turning artist. "I think I
can draw better than do anything else, and
certainly like it better than any other oc
cupation. Why shouldn't I? It requires
a three years' apprenticeship, however,
which is not agreeable, and afterward the
way Is clear and pleasant enough. An
artist in this town is by far a more dis
tinguished person than a lawyer, and a
great deal more so than a clergyman."
At first the allusions to Dr. Maginn are
full of praises of his scholarship and
kindness and clover talk. But as Thack
eray grew to know the brilliant Bohemian
better he saw and deplored the darker
shades in his character, his drunkenness,
improvidence and neglect of his own fam
ily. Years afterward he was to put all
he knew of Maginn into the Captain |
Shandon of "Pendennis."
This was the period when the reform !
j bill was being fought inch by inch.
Thackeray, like most of his friends, was a I
Liberal. When Charles Buller stood for
Parliament as a candidate for Liskeard. j
in Cornwall, Thackeray went up there to
help elect his friend, and even delivered a. !
few speeches for him.
But he was never a keen politician. Pict- '
ures and plays formed a much larger |
| share of his early interests than either !
; politics or law rases, only he sympathized |
: warmly with his friends and companions,
and never hesitated to utter his sympa
j thles.
Of mere journalism he was evidently
! getting heartily sick. Three months later, '
, being then in London, he tells his mother |
i that "this system of newspaper writing !
I spoils one for every other kind of writing. ,
1 am unwilling, now more than ever, to
write letters to my friends, and always !
find myself attempting to make a pert,
critical point at the end of a sentence."
In October he Is bark in Paris again,
and writes to his mother: "I want now to |
settle, to marry, and then to live In the
little house in Albion street, going to
church regularly, rising early and walking
in the park with Mrs. T.
"Then what Interesting letters I could I
write you about Bill's progress in cutting i
his teeth and Johnny s improvement in
spelling! As it is, I have nothing eartiny
to talk about except myselfâ and I am
tired of filling my letters with l's.
"I spend all day now at the Atelier, and
; am very well satisfied with the progress I j
make. I think that in a year, were I to
work hard, I might paint something worth
looking at. The other men at the Atelier j
are merry fellows enough, always sing- ;
j ing, smoking, fencing and painting very !
i industriously besides. Most of them have j
I skill in painting but no hand for drawing. <
I wish you could see the scene every day
in the Atelier. Yesttrday we had a break
fast for five, consisting of five sausages,
three loaves and a bottle of wine, for 15
sous. Afterward pipes succeeded, and
then songs, imitations of all the singers in
Paris."
It is well known that the Literary
Standard did not fly for very long. After
it was hauled down Thackeray returned
to Paris a,nd resumed his painting.
In 1836, at the age of 2~>. Thackeray
married. His bride was a Miss Isabella
Creagh Shawe, a young Irishwoman of
good family. He himself told Mrs. Ritchie
th" guest of the evening by M. E. Licht,
addresses by the grand officers, Mrs. il.
Worms. Miss Ahrams, Mrs. Ross and J.
J. Harrington, by the modest member
from Inter Nos Circle and Mips May Bai
ley of Bonlta Circle. There was also a vo- j
oal solo by Miss Nettie Morris. After that j
there was dancing and a short pro- j
gramme of song, music and recitation, i
The reception, a surprise to the recipient,
was a very enjoyable affair.
The officers-elect of Loyal Circle will be
publicly installed on the 11th of July, in
Gier's Hall. ',
COURT YERBA BUENA, I. O. F.
Last Tuesday night as Court Yerba
Buena No. 913 of the Independent Order
of Foresters was closing its routine busi
ness the member of the court whose duty
it Is to stand guard at the outer door an
nounced that the United States army
was coming, and in a few moments
Lieutenant Walsh of the Thirteenth Min
nesota and some thirty men of his regi
ment, all members of the order, entered
the court and were received with an en
thusiastic welcome. At the request of |
Chief Ranger Wate, Recording Secretary j
Ben I. Salomon took charge of the court,
and after delivering a few well-chosen
words of welcome to the visitors opened
an impromptu programme of entertain
ment, which Included an address by
Vice High Chief Ranger Charles S.
Peery, one of the best that he ever de
livered; recitation by Dr. J. G. Crawford,
a violin solo by Master Balart and oth
er members. The visitors and mem
bers were provided with cigars and
refreshments, which were obtained
on the "hurry-me-qulck" plan," and
by midnight the visitors and mem
bers came to the conclusion that they
had been well entertained, and that the
master of ceremonies was a great suc
cess in geting up affairs of that char
acter on very short notice. After many
of those present had personally thanked
the recording secretary for the pleasure
he had afforded them there were sung
patriotic songs, and then adjournment
followed. If the Minnesota regiment re
mains here for some time the court will
entertain the Forester members again.
Last Sunday the anniversary of the
founding of the order was observed in
this city by a service in the Central M.
E. Church, which was attended by about
two hundred and fifty of the members
of the local courts and a number of the
soldier Forsters from Camp Merritt. The
sermon delivered by Rev. Mr. Locke was
an eloquent one and it created a deep Im
pression on those who listened to It.
The Foresters formed in a body at Wash
ington Hall at 7:30 o'clock in the even
ing and marched to the church.
STATIONARY ENGINEERS.
Last Tuesday evening San Francisco
No. 1 of California, National Association
of Stationary Engineers, enjoyed an old
time smoker in its hall at 20 Eddy street
and spent a most enjoyable evening:. The
Fort Wayne Electric Corporation re
cently donated to this association a very
handsome electrical switchboard to be
used in the education of the members in
the various uses of electricity, and the
Weston Electric Manufacturing Company
added a contribution in the nature of in
struments. There were short addresses
by President Elsasser. Professor Van der
Is'aillen and others, after which the cur
rent was turned on the board and there
was presented interesting and instructive
electrical work. This was followed by
a good programme of music, song and
humor, and a collation was served. It
was midnight before the members con
cluded that ot was time to depart.
THE CHOSEN FRIENDS.
The progressive euchre party given on
the evening of the 16th inst. by Social
Council in its hall In the Red Men's
building was a very pleasant event. The
winners were Mrs. Lyons, ladies' first
prize; J. S. Karr, gentlemen's first prize.
The booby prizes went to Mrs. E. Bryant
and F. C. Arinny^ who could not have '
that he lost his heart to her mother when
he heard her sing. She had a very sweet
voice and an excellent method.
The young couple took up their abode in
the Rue St. Augustln, not far from that
little restaurant afterward made famous
in the "Ballad of Boullabaisse."
Some prescience, some dim shadow of
the awful bereavement which was to
come seems to have fallen upon him
when, in 183S, he wrote a very Deautiful
letter to his wife, from which the follow
ing passage may be quoted: "Here we
have been two years married and not a
single unhappy day. Oh, I do bless God ;
for all this happiness which he has given
me. It is so great that I almost tremble
for the future, except that I humbly hope
(for what man is certain about his own
weakness?) our love is strong enough to
withstand any pressure from without, and
as it is a gift greater than any fortune, is
likewise one superior to poverty or sick
ness, or any other worldly evil with which
Providence may visit us. Let us pray, as
I trust there is no harm, that none of
these may come upon us; as the best and
wisest Man In the world prayed that he
might not be led into temptation. â¢ â¢ â¢
I think happiness is as good as prayers,
and I feel In my heart a kind of overflow
ing thanksgiving which is quite too great
to describe in writing. This kind of hap
piness is like a fine picture; you only see
how beautiful it is. I don't know that I
shall have done much by coming away,
except being so awfully glad to come
back again.
It will be seen that this introduction is
full of biographical and autobiographical
interest, but it reveals very little that is
new about the books which it professes to
"introduce."
"I hardly know," says Mrs. Ritchie,
"nor if I knew should I care to give here
the names and the details of the events
which suggested some of the Yellowplush
papers. The history of Mr. Deuceace
was written from life during a very early
period of my father's career. Nor can
one wonder that his views were some
what grim at that particular time, and
still bore the impress of an experience
lately and very dearly bought.
"He was naturally trustful and even
enthusiastic about people who had been
kind to him, but, as it seems scarcely
necessary to say, the author of 'Vanity
Fair' had a great deal of common-sense
and a very rapid perception of facts when
they finally shaped themselves.
"As a boy he had lost money at cards to
some card sharpers who scraped acquaint
ance with him. He has told us that they
came and took lodgings opposite to his, on
purpose to get hold of him. He never
blinked at the truth nor spared himself;
but neither did he blind himself as to the
real character of the people in question
when once he had discovered them. His
villains became curious studies of human
nature. He turned them over in his mind
and he caused Deuoeace, Barry Lyndon
and Ikey Solomons Esq. to pay back some
of their ill-gotten spoils in an Involuntary
but very legitimate fashion when he put
them into print and made them the heroes
of those grim early histories."
"Major Gahagan" burst into life, boots
and all. In Colburn's New Monthly Mag
azine for IS3B. In a frontispiece to "Comic
Tales and Sketches" are to be found the
three portraits of Major Gahagan. De la
Pluche and Michael Angelo Titmarsh,
arm In arm. "They are supposed to be
marching hand in hand on the very brink
of immortality," says Mr. Titmarsh in
his introduction.
Yellowplush, that bird of rare plume,
also belongs to this same early burst of
fun and springtime. Yellowplush con
tinued his literary efforts for some years;
but as he went up in the world he became
Jeames de la Pluche Esq. The longest
lived of the three Was Michael Angelo
Titmarsh, that droll shadow, behind
which Thackeray lived to shelter himself.
In Barries life of his mother he tells us
how she wonders that ho should always
write as if he were some one not himself.
Sensitive people are glad of a disguise,
and of a familiar who will speak their
thoughts for them.

IMPROVED ORDER OF RED MEN.
Flag day was observed with appropri
ate ceremonies by the members of White
Eagle and Awashatee tribes in their hall
on the evening of the 14th inst. There
was a good attendance and almost every
member of the last named tribe was in
attendance. There was a fine programme
of talks and songs appropriate to the oc
casion, all present manifesting a high de
gree of patriotism. During the evening
Past Sachem Sellers of Awashatee Tribe,
on behalf of that tribe presented to
White Eagle Tribe a beautiful American

Tribe at Yreka and to lona Council at
the same place. There he was well re
ceived by the membership of each boGy.

From a Late Photograph.
Inside story of Cuban affairs than any
man living. He also knows the entire,
the true and the terrible story of Span
ish misrule in Cuba. In his work he will
bring out the truth and tell of things as
he saw them.
In Cuba General Lee was more than a
brave and far-seeing diplomat. He was
also the student and historian of events.
His every observation was recorded, his
every experience written down when
fresh In his mind. He took every advan
tage of his uneqiuiled opportunity to
know the truth, that he might give it to
the world In an intelligent and Interest-
Ing way. His memoranda, manuscripts
and illustrations being ready, he is able
to finish quickly and when most needed
his magnificent undertakingâ a true, com
plete and enduring story of the rise and
rescue of Cuba. The author spares noth
ing that stands in the way of truth in
giving his "inside" information, including
many important facts that have hereto
fore been withheld from the people on
account of diplomatic relations with
Spain.
General Lee's work will make a book of
about 500 pages, printed on superior pa
per, beautifully illustrated with over 100
full-page plates, from photographs, many
of them collected by the author himself,
of actual scenes in Cuba.
Whatever doubt one may have held in
regard to the exact state of affairs in
Cuba will now be set at rest, for General
Lee tells on his own honor things he ac
tually saw and knows to be true. He has
made no attempt to embellish his work
nor has he concealed a single fact that is
fit to print. He has brought out the
whole terrible story and laid it where all
may see. It is a story that will stir the
heart and convince the minds of the
world, for it gives the whole truth for the
first time.
General Lee's book is being published
by J. A. Hill & Co.. 91 Fifth avenue, New
York.
WITH NATURE AND A CAMERA.
One of the most remarkable books on
natural history ever published has just
reached this country. It is by Richard
Kearton of the British Zoological Society
and is most unique in many points.
The work is chiefly remarkable for Its
pictures. These are all photographs from
nature and the extremes to which the
writer went to secure them are almost be
yond belief.
There are nearly 500 pages in the book,
the whole making a most excellent chron
icle of eight months' life in the open air
of the British Isles. It was Professor
Hearton's intention to make exact photo
graphs of wild creatures in their native
haunts, and he succeedfd. In his work he
was assisted by his brother, Cherry Kear
ton.
To secure certain of the pictures a week
was spent in the pouring rain. Others
were only secured by ascending beetling
cliffs at the risk of life. But the result
is certainly worth all the trouble.
In the book are llashllght pictures of
birds sitting on their nests at night, in
stantaneous views of eagles feeding their
young, puffins at home, snakes coiled
reedy to spring and a hundred others
equally as interesting.
The account of the trip is graphic and
interesting and the information conveyed
is of the most reliable kind.
"With Nature and a Camera"â By Richard
programme, "started the machinery" at a
quarter past Js o'clock. There were ad
dresses by Lieutenant Grant and Lieu
tenant Falk of the Minnesota regiment,
Hon. E. E. Ewing of Ohio. John B. Whit
ney and Thomas Banks. Then followed a
programme of song, music, stories and
recitations, with the accompanying cigars,
I sodia, etc. The order was represented by
the sitting council and Peralta. Oakland,
j Alameda and Golden West councils.
i This order requires but seventy-five
more members to enable it to institute a
Grand Council in this State.
WHIST
NO RECOGNIZED WHIST AUTHOTITY-
To the Whist Editor Call: I am one of the
many beginners who attend the Friday after
noon whist classes that are so popular and
given by the ladies of the Trist Duplicate
Whist Club, and also deeply interested in your
whist articles in the Sunday Call. I would like
to ask what whist book you can recommend
for me to purchase for the purpose of study-
Ing â one that is a recognized authority on the
game. -You will confer a great favor on a
humble student by giving me the resired In
formation. Very sincerely yours. ;
AIRS. E. M. T.
My Dear Madam: 'This question Is one that
has been and will be asked a great .many times.
It seems to me that it is a great misf rtune
to whist' players in general to be compelled to
say to our little lady correspondent that there
Is no â  whist book written or printed that Is
universally - recognized -in this country as an
authority on the game. Many : individuals and
a few whist clubs accept some whist writer
or compiler of a book aÂ», their guide and au
thority, but that is as far as it goes. When
the American Whist League : was formed in
1891, Mr. Nicholas Browse Trist, the father of
American leads, made a strong effort to carry
out. this -idea but failed, â¢ and we believe the
league at that time â¢ made â¢ a serious mistake
when they neglected doing this very thing.
To-day the whist players of the country, as
well as every whist club in the land, are In a
state of chaos regarding their. whist play, this
condition of affairs being brought about by
having no recognized standard or system.
There are several hundred varieties of whist
books that can be purchased, some of which
are good, some bad. and some indifferent. If
you buy any particular one and show it to the
first "whist player" you meet nowadays, he
will tell you you should have bought the other
If the lady seeking the information had left
out the words "that is a recognized authority"
we could recommend to her several good whist
books, Â» but that "authority" clause bars us
from so doing.
It is to be hoped . that the American Whist
League will wake up from Its Rip Van Winkle
slumber some. time In the near future and have
the courage of its conviction, and say to its
whist children: "Accept this little volume- it
contains what we think is the best system of
whist play: we stamp It with our seal of ap
proval, and believe it Is the best route to take
to reach the goal." Its title page should be In
scribed
"Whist", as approved by the American Whist
League.

'> WHIST ABOVE THE CLOUDS.
Can any. one imagine such a scene as this
at a whist contest? During the intervals of
rest between the play of the ; deals to walk to
an open window and look out and down upon

hills and plains |of what , appears â¢; to be moun

COMMONSENSE IN WHIST.
This Is the title to a new whist book from
the pen of R. F. Foster, whist editor of the
New York Sun. The author says it is the first
edition of a work which la intended to be a
whist players' annualâ something on the plan,
of the books for the ben.-llt of amateur pho
tographers, giving the results of experiences
and investigations up to date. Next year the
work will be entirely rewritten and will em
body such modifications as may be suggested
by the practical experience* of those who shall
try the tactics outlined in the present work, and
will send â  to the author their criticisms on
the various elements of strategy herein touched
upon.
Mr. Foster is one of the most versatile writers
on whist in this country. He has hi 3 peculiar
ideas and opinions and gives full vent to them
In his many whist books and writings. Up to
date whist players will read this book with a
considerable amount of amusement.
One thousand copies of this look will be
printed, and they will be sold entirely by sub
scription at $1 each. Orders should be sent
direct to the publisher. R. F. Foster, 506 Han
cock street, Brooklyn, X. Y.
HAS "ECHOED" HIS MASTER'S "CALL."
It Is sad to write these lines to announce to
the whist players of California the death of
H. H. Hotaling of the San Francisco Whist
Club and recording secretary of the Facifla
Coast Whist Association. Only a few days ago
Mr. Hotaling was in perfect health. Taken
suddenly with what his physician pronounced
appendicitis, they quickly resorted to the knife.
When this course was taken the end came, aa
It usually does. In nine cases out of ten, in a
few hours.
This sudden taking off of Mr. Hotaiing toj
a great shock to his large circle of friends,
particularly to his whist associates. Mr. Hotal
ing waa a great student of the game, and had
shown in many ways that he was a whist
genius. Hl6 funeral took place from the family
residence Friday afternoon, and was largely.

THE THEATERS.
THESE are the trying midsummer
days when the average manager is
overworking his brain to select
some entertainment sufficiently at
tractive to profitably retain the at
tention of the public. He has more
than the seasonal handicap this
year of regular patrons who are at the
various resorts. The existence of war,
contrary to the rule in most countries,
peems to detract public attention from
the pleasures of the playhouse and
in addition to this unwelcome fact
there Is Just opening a political campaign,
â which, considering the patronage and
emoluments involved promises to be one
of the most important In the history of
the State. The prizes in the game are
bo great, including Governor, United
States Senator and nearly all the other
offices. State and county, that the contest
â will undoubtedly be a hot one. This
means that a majority of the voters on
both sidea of the political fence will de
vote a large part of their evening leisure
to attendance on political meetings and
"doing" general night politics in the
Interest of friends who are seeking office.
These conditions have grave signifi
cance to the box office, and the only pos
sible way of meeting them successfully
is to offer the best attractions In the
marketâ such as will command and hold
the attendance of the public. In view of
the fact that San Francisco managers do
not have to combat the evil of hot
â weather, the arch enemy which compels
the closing of theaters in the sweltering
Eastern cities, it would seem that the
pleasure-loving people of this bailiwick.
â¢who have given San Francisco the well
earned reputation of being the best show
town of its population in the United
States, might be kept well in hand to the
profit and honor of the managers. The
fact is patent that high-class \audeville
succeeds in this particular effort in San
Francisco without special regard to the
wen t her. and In New York and Chicago.

Whether this class of attrac
tions is to be further advanced in the
estimation of the public, to the detriment
of the higher divisions of the drama, re
mains to br- determined, and the prob
lem is one that is puzzling sorr.e of the
brightest men in the business. M'he man
who finds an early solution thereto will
certainly receive a rich reward. In the
meantime we will accept with more or
less gratitude what Providence in the
form of the oooking agent sends us.
The local field of entertainment during
the coming week will include a new mili
tary drama, "Fort Frayne." by the well
known author. Captain King, at the Co
lumbia. It is said to contain several thrill-
Ing situations and to be a correct repre
sentation of the life of soldiers on the
plains and in Western garrisons, with
sufficient adventures to give it zest. As
the stage mountings and costumes are to
be exact and the Frawley Company is to
have the advantage of a supervision of
the production by the author, the results
phould be more than ordinarily interest-
Ing.
The Tivoli will provide comic opera by
â the revival of the popular musical "Boc
caccio," promising a strong cast, with all
the necessary stage accessories. Follow
ing this will come "The Mikado." The
Alcazar withholds the promised war
drama for further preparation, and will
present the historical play, "Frederick
the Great," a comedy with military trim
mings. The title role will be in the hands
of Lewis Morrison. Morosco's will have
Carroll Johnson in white face as an Irish
comedian in "The Gossoon," in which part
he will doubtless do well. The Orpheum
offers several new and striking acts to its
Jong list of good things, and, finally, the
California is to reopen with" that good and
venerable friend that never dies.
â¢'Uncle Tom's Canln." The cast will be
pji unusually strong one.
The Coiumbia.
The lively calls of the bugle and the
Tattle of the war drum will be heard at
the Columbia this week In the military
.drama, "Fort Frayne," by the author of
the popular novel of that name, Captain
King. The captain has been very success
ful with his books of life on the frontiers,
and as the story in question is a very In
teresting one and the production will be
under the direction of the author, "Fort
Frayne" should prove very entertaining,
particularly in these times of war. Close
attention will be paid to the settings and
costumes, and theater-goe_rs will see a
representation of garrison life a 8 it Is and
not as it Is conceived by authors who
would not know a garrison from a stock
yard. The story is laid in Wyoming, at
an army barracks near the Platte, and
develops some sharply drawn characters,
one of which is Crow KnfTe. an Indian
who appears In the play as a Lnited
States regular. j M . , .
He is one of the few of his race whom
the Government ha* been successful in
utilizing in the regular army, and his
participation in the scene which is the
pivotal point for the culmination of the
plot, makes him nne of the important
characters in the telling of the story. It
is quite a dramatic scene, and shows the
Indian's love for the son of the man
who spared the Indian women and chil
dren against the redskins. The renegade
eolflier. Royal Farrar. Is ordered undei
arrest for insulting an officer, and when
the guard is called In to take him he at
tempts to kill his superior with a knife,
tut instead mortally wounds the Indian
â who had stepped between them to pre
vent the deed. The soldier's confinement
In the tower over the room where the
ammunition is stornrt, and his attempt to
fire the place brings about his death and
injury of others, as well aa a way to the
ultimate happiness of those concerned. It
13 said that General King has given, in
this play, a correct reproduction of real
soldiers, living a real life in a Western
army post, with its bugle calls, glimpses
of the barracks aud snow-covered parade
ground. It is sara that "Fort Frayne," |
in its atmosphere and characters, comes
nearer photographing life in an army
post than any play we have had. The
cast will be Interesting at this time, as the
production is a new one.
The cast Is an excellent one, and In
cludes almost the entire strength of the

The /\!cazar.
In order to make more perfect prepa
tion for an artistic production, the prom
ised war drama, "The Nation's Defend
ers," which was to have been presented
at the Alcazar to-morrow evening, will
be withheld and a historical pay, in four
acts.entltled "Frederick the Great," will
be put on. It Is a comedy, with some
military phases, and the incidents cover
a period of twenty years of the life of
the great Prussian King. George Foster
Platt, the author, has utilized many facts
of historical record fitted to the drama
tists' needs. The play recalls the many
talents and peculiarities of Frederick,
his honorable career as a statesman and
warrior, as well as scenes in his domestic
lif>\ showing his tribulations growing out
of his love of his former favorite. Baron
yon Trenck, for the King's sister. Prin
cess Amelia, which ends in the impris
onment of the Baron. The story also
covers the incidents leading to the war
between Prussia and Austria, and Fred
erick's efforts to compel his sister to wed
the King of Sweden, for state reasons.
During the four acts the stage will pre
sent settings of the apartments of the j
King in his winter palace, a view of the
country from the hills near Hochkirchen,
and several other historical scenes. Mr.
Morrison will assum^ the role of Freder
ick the Great, and his support will be the

in an Irish role in the comedy drama,
"The Gossoon." It is the star part of
Squire O'Connell. and gives him full scope
for his abilities. The play has not been
seen here in many years, but will be
remembered as one of the best of its
class. The situations in many cases are

The Orpheum.
This popular house has five new acts to
present this week. The three Watson

Juan de Zamara, will give their wonderful

of the kind ever presented in this city.
A particularly good turn is promised by
j Falk and Semon. the grotesque musicians,
who have many surprising and comical
ways of making music, ("'harks Wayne,
who is well known as an eccentrique
I comedian, returns with a line of comedy
which has made him more popular than :

Grar.t and Jones are a trio of genuine
colored people. They claim to have a
new line of comedy in the way of cake

the bill. Matinees every Wednesday,

a revival of "Uncle Tom's Cabin." The
cast of Harriet Beecher Stowe's idyll will

whether so many competent players have

the play.
It will include Rhys Thomas, the well

a great deal. Cords of money was made
with the show, but Addie "blew in" lots
of the profits. A few years before the old
mnn died he sent Addie to Europe to rest
up, and, as it runs, settle down. He had
$2000 as pocket money. About two weeks
after arriving on the other side he cabled
his father that he had a chance to buy a
pair of chlmpaniees, nearly six feet high
and almost human in intelligence, for
(10,000, and to cable the money. Old Adam
did bo, and after waiting for a couple of
weeks cabled Addie asking when the
monkeys would arrive. The answer came:
â¢The monkeys died the day after I paid
for them." Was it so? Well. Addie had a
good time, just the same.
DOMESTIC TROUBLES
OF MARIE BARNA.
PRETTY and talented Marie Barna
and handsome Jack Smith of
Boston are about to separate, she
to rovel In the glory of her musical
education, he to return to America
and endeavor to forget the whirlwind
through which he had passed during: tne
last few months.
Marie Barna is a well-known Oakland
girl, daughter of Judge Barnard. Last
season she scored a big hit with the Mel
ba company in the East. Subsequently
she went to Paris, where the suit for di
vorce was filed.
In the cafes, the clubs and even In thÂ«
drawing-rooms of the ultra smart set
centered in the American colony of gay
Paris the pet morsel of gossip Just now
is the estrangement of Mr. and Mrs. Jack
A. Smith. â
The pot of trouble has been steadily
boiling for nearly a year, but it was only
last week that the bubbles began to burst.
That was when Marie, or, more properly,
'Mrs. Jack A. Smith of Boston, U. S. A,,
applied through the proper tribunals of
Paris for a divorce from her husband,
Jack A. Smith, also of Boston," U. S. A.
In her bill of complaint for separate
maintenance, Mrs. Smith prays the court
to release her from the brutality of her
husband, who, she alleges, has dallied too
freely wUh the wine when it was not only
red, "but white, yellow, green and every
other old color.
In addition to this barbarity, Mrs. Smith
further alleges that her husband has been
reveling in the society of certain strange
creatures to whom she refers as grisettes.
Furthermore, she swears that Jack has
raised the Old Harry on numerous occa
sions, during which he had smashed the
furnishings of their pretty apartments at
19 Rue do la Van, and caused her untold
misery and apprehension for her own per
sonal safety.
On the other hand. Jack says but lit
tle. He will not oppose the divorce and
will even consent to his wife resuming
the name which caught his fancy when
first they met in Boston, three short years
ato.
From flower decked Oakland to thÂ«
bracing breezes of the New England
coast came Miss Marie Barnard, in 1894.
Her father, the Judge, impressed with
the mellowness of his only daughter's
voice, derided to send her to an Eastern
conservatory of music, where she would
have all the advantages of modeling her
superb power after the fashion or the
greatest American masters.
Quite naturally the place selected was
Boston, and hither came Miss Barnard,
attended by two servants. The dainty
little Californian, with her golden brown
hair and clean blue eyes, soon became a
general favorite at the conservatory. This
popularity was perhaps enhanced by the
lavish manner in which the new comet
entertained her newly formed eirl friends
in her cozy apartments in a particularly
select portion of Commonwealth avenue.
A brief six months' close attention to
the elementary studies of vocalism and
Marie was ready to take her place among
the world of songstersâ at least, that is
what she told her professor. She wanted
to go to Paris, for she was quite certain
that with a few finishing touches of the
French system she would be the heralded
star of the world. Then came dashing
Jack Smith.
Mr. John A. Smith, gentleman of leis
ure, with a decided penchant for delving
into musty old books, which occupation
contrasted strangely with his handsome
face and maniy deportment, met the win
some lass from California and imme
diately fell head over heels in love.
Two wÂ«'pk? after leaving the conserva
tory Marie Barnard became the wife of
Jack Smith. The good people of Boston
were shocked, the doting mothers threw
up their hands in dismay, while the dear
girls, in the privacy of their little tete-a
tetes, avowed that no good would come
of such a match, and all because Jack
and Marie were married exactly two
weeks from the day they first met and
loved.
In the natural order of consistent
events Jack and Marie journeyed across
the continent to make their peace with
stern old Judge Barnard.
The attendant sensation. Incident to the
arrival of Mr. and Mrs. Smith in Paris,
was another choice morsel of gossip for
the newspapers. Many friends of both of
them were quartering in the American
colony, and it was only natural that the
gossips would talk.
Then came the restless genii of adven
ture â both grew tired of the monotonous
routine of San Francisco â both wanted to
go abroadâ and after a brief interview
with Judge Barnard it was decided that
the newly wedded couple should go to
Paris, where Marie could finish her mu
sical education
Tn the French conservatory Mrs, Smith
had entered her name as Marie Barna
and as such she was known to the mu
sh al circles to which she quickly found
admittance through the wonderful qual
ity of her beautiful soprano voice.
Then came the monster jealousy.
Yes, Jack will let Marie have her di
vorce. She can take back her playthings
and she can even attain the admiration of
the whole world with her beauty and her
voice, but Jack doesn't care.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, June 25.â The regrettable loss
of American soldiers In Cuba had a senti
mentally depressing Influence at the opening of
the stock market t">-<lay. Prices continued
sluggish, but without real weakness, during the
first hnur. The question of differentials to the
Canadian Pacific was said to still block a set
tlement of the rate war, and this contributed
to the heaviness in Northern Pacific The
specialties on manipulation improved substan
tially. Various industrials. Including Spirits
and Tobacco, received effective support, thus
checking the earlier easiness In the general
railway list and ranging traders on the lcng
Bide. The grangers, however, failed to quit*
reach last nights closing. The general list
closed firm in anticipation of a successful cul
mination soon of thÂ» land and sea operations
at Santiago. The expected success of our army
of invasion, coupled with the continued ease
of monetary conditions, the growing foreign
trade balance in our favor and the expected
heavy investment demand for si-euritles owing
to the July dividend and interest payments
have rendered vigorous efforts by the bears to
create liquidation futile.
The bond market gave striking evidence of
the plethora of the money seeking Investments.
Price? of the gilt-ed^ed investments Improved
substantially and heavy purchases occurred of
the reorganization if^uep which promise a fair
return on capital Invested.
In Government bond? gains occurred of Vg In
the old 4b registered and % each In the new

ASSOCIATED BANKS' STATEMENT.
NEW YORK. June 25.â Financier says:
With a surplus reserve exceeding $62,200,000, j
and with deposits increasing three times as ]
rapidly as loans. It cannot be said that the j
New York money market is in a position to i
favor the moderate advance which was looked i
for after definite arrangements had been made !
for the new Government loan. The banks, ac
cording to their statements Saturday, gained i
$4,576,300 in cash, while their loans expanded j
only $2,262,600. The increase In deposits of j
$0,. '.71,400, in view of these two changes, is
about normal. As payments of small subscrip- ,
tions of bonds are consummated the domestic ;
exchange situation may be expected to show
material advances. Banks at Important middle
and Western centers In their correspondence
already reported that the loan subscriptions
seem to be creating a scarcity of New York
exchange, and rates are going higher In con
i sequence. The policy of the treasury in col
lecting as fast as possible remittances for cash
subscriptions Is reflected In smaller debtor bal
ances, but not the sub-treasury and the New
York clearing banks, but the amounts gath
ered Into the treasury are not yet large enough i
to offset extraordinary payments due to war |
I expenses. The result Is that the banks are >
gaining, not only from the Interior movement,
but from the treasury as well. This accounts
in a large part for the continued accumulation
of idle capital at this center. It Is not prob- t
able, however, that this will continue much :
longer.* As the date for the closing of the loan
| approaches the banks are bound to lose an ap
preciable proportion of their excess reserve, but j
indications point to a merely temporary dis
turbance of small consequence in the situation. I
: The July dividend payments, aggregating be- I
tween $80,000,000 and $100,000,000 in this city.
j doubtless have caused some of the changes for i

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, June 26.â Whoat was strengthened ;
at the ftart by the reports cf damage to crops i
with which the mail of every commission house !
was loaded. English cables came a shade bet- ;
ter and tliere were quite a number of bad |
crop advices from the other sld<?. among them
a cablegram from Broom Ball saying that the i
weather In England was unsettled, the crop
three weeks late, the urowth rank and the !
crop outlook poor. Later the market suc
cumbed to the dullness of speculative trade
and the general Impression that such a crop
as this season's can spare a lot to the bugs
and other pests it has been menaced by and >
still have enough left to make a bigger crop ;
than was ever before gathered. The early
advance was all lost and prices left off under ,
laFt night's close, July losing IVic and Sep
tember â  â â¢.
Between crop prospects incident to improved
weather depressed corn. Thore was some II- ;
quidation in July and the bulls gave no sup- ;
port to that or later deliveries. July closed ;
lower.
.^r.-ilpers sold oats on every decline In corn.
This, combined by the selling by longs, caused
prioes to sag. July closed "nc lower.
The speculative trade was still timid In pro- j
visions on at-count of the yellow fever. Prices
held firm and were a shade higher nt the close
than yesterday, except In rib:*, which are un
ctmnged. Pork advanced 6c and lard 2^(g)sc.

Fears of Fourth of July fires and the ap

by the trade why buyers continue to hold off
from buying Hay. Certainly they are doing

rivals pass out of first hands. There Is now
more of an assortment of new Hay, as will be
seen by' the quotations, and old is in meager
supply. Some grades are firm and others weak,
but there Is no decline In any description, and

THE LITTLE GIRL SPY.
MIGUEL HERNANDEZ is a Cu
ban patriot who lived not many
miles from Santiago de Cuba.
Miguel fell sick of the fever, and
Miguel's little daughter, Maria,
and Mi uel's wife had to look out for
th-ir one cow an 1 some chickens and
a garden. Miguel grew worse, and his
wife was soon compelled to pass all of
her time at hij bedside. Little Maria
played some, but worked most of the
time.
Their little home was in the moun
tain?, and no Spanish soldiers had been
there until the news came that "the
Yankees" had declared war against
Bpain. Soon after that Spanish troop
ers came over the mountains hunting
for able-v.r>.-M P d men to make into Span
ish soldiers. Brutal and rough they
were, and they struck poor Miguel, be
cause, they said, he was shamming
sickness. The captain of the troopers
saw Maria in the garden and cafled her
to him.
â¢How old are you, little girl?" he
asked.
'Twelve years old next Christmas."
"Twelve years old. Well, you will do
as a guide over the mountains. Come,
we want you."
Maria's mother cried and coaxed the
soldiers not to take her little girl away,
pleading that her help was needed.
Maria cried, too, and joined her plead
ings with her mother's, but all in vain.
She was roughly seized and ordered to
show the soldiers the way to Santiago
de Cuba, she acting as guide.
She performed her duty bo well that
the troopers slept In a Spanish fort that
night.. The next day and the next, and
for many days after, more Spanish
soldiers arrived at the fort, and Maria
learned from what they said that they
had been ?ent <>ut from Havana to
Strengthen the garrison, and that ~ big
battle was expected as soon as the
Americans should come.
Day and night the Spanish soldiers
toiled with picks and shovels and dug
deep pits In the earth, into which they
lowered explosives, which would go. off,
thf-y said, and blow into pieces any
Cubans or Yankees who might come
that way. Every road leading to San
tiago was treated this way except one;
that one the Spaniards kept open fur
their own safety.
Maria was filled with fea.\ She knew
that her fathe was a leader among
the Cubans. Suppose when he was well
that he should r. arch with an army
over these dreadful pits? Maria made
up her mind that she would watch
carefully and try to escape at the first
chan c. Hut ehe was closely watched,
the Spaniards were very sus
picious.
"The little rebel." she heard a er
geant say to a Spanish officer, "has
mischief in h< fi i-s."
The Spanish officer had her brought
before him. "Any attempt you make
ai o and carry news to the Cu
bans will raur-e you to be shot. Do
you understand!"
She did understand and trembled vio
lently; but she made no answer.
"Keep your eyes on that girl," she
heard the officer say later. "If you
suspect her shoot her at once."
Then the Spanish warships com
manded by Admiral Cervera came into
the harbor of Santiago, and there was
much joy until an American fleet ap
peared and shut p the Spanish ships
as If they were In a trap. The Spanish
soldiers were no longer allowed to go
away from tlie forts, for a battle might
take place any time and they were all
needed. The '"'ubans soon found out
this and soon signal fires appeared
every night on the hills. Spanish
spies were sent out and came back
with the news that a large force of Cu
bans were gathering; that they had
succeeded in getting guns and ammuni
tion from the Americans and that they
were only -waiting for a signal to
march against the Spanish in their
forts.
Ge.ieral Liar :â¢--. who commanded the
Spaniards, ordered that some large
cannons should be moved to some new

road 3. There were two nÂ«w batteries

and iour cannons were to be moved.
Into one of t. -c cannons little Maria
crept. She vas hardly inside of the
dark and jffocating ph c when she
was sorry, but she dared not cry out
for fear the Spaniards would carry out
their threat to shoot her if she should
try 10 escape.
After she had heard much noise she
felt the cannon move and she knew
that it was wheeling to the new bat
teries. The rough jolting over stones
hurt her terribly; the air grew more
and more stifling and Maria's throat

was parched and burning. Still she
made no noise. She knew that she had
been missed for she heard the soldiers
speak of her flight. Horsemen galloped
by and she was sure that they would
be searching for her. Her heart stood
almost still and she hardly dared to
breathe. Would they find her? Was
ever a little Cuban girl in such trouble?
How would she get out of the cannon
alive?
The courage she had surpassed her
years, but it was taxed to the utter
most. The cannon was finally drawn

to its new place. The new earthwork
was on a hill. The road it was to guard
was below. Before the soldiers ceased
work they pointed the gun downward.
From its smooth Interior the little girl
felt herself slipping, slipping. A sec
ond more and she would be in the open
air â in daylight! Another second and
the cruel rifles would be aimed at her!
But no, she fell into darkness. It was
night. From the cannon's mouth she
dropped until her progress was stopped
by high grass. What a noise she made
as she struck the ground! She must
have been heard, she thought. No,
brave little girl, your time has not come
yet. You are outside of the earth
works, unseen and free and It is night.
What will you do?
At first Maria feared to move. She
discovered that she had not been hurt.
When her eyea became used to the dim
light she saw the road below, whUe and
dusty, winding away until it was lost
to view in the deep shadows of trees
that grew near the bridge that crossed
a creek. She waited and waited. Then
she crawled on hands and knees to
ward the road. A loose stone rolled
from beneath her feet and rattled nois
ily downward. Had it been an ava
lanche the sound could not have terri
fied the poor child more. But the Span
ish sentinels did not appear to hear.
How far it was to the road! Would
she ever get there? Would she not, In

the darkness, step upon a mine and be
blown up? She did not know that the
mines would not explode without they
were set off by electricity. Her ignor
ance added that terror. She reacned
the road more dead than alive. She
crawled along, hardly moving, until
she reached the shadows of the bridge,
and she crossed the bridge as softly as
a cat steps. When she was in the for
est beyond she ran as fast as htr
strength, aided by her fear, would let
her.
She ran until she could go no farther.
She sat down, breathless, under a tree,
and the next instant two Spanish trxip
ers swept by her on horseback, so nrar
that she felt the wind caused by their
motion. They talked to each other
about her escape and were sorry that
they had not found her. They did not
dream she was so near them. When
the sounds of their horses' hoofs di -d
away Maria lost no time going on, but
only at ;i Blow walk. She knew the
road well and had no fear that aht
would lose her way. But she had miles
to travel to roach her home. The troop
ers had visited her home and had re .
ported that she was not there. So that
was the safest place for her.
"Halt:"
"I surrender," said little Maria, vith
b, sure that she would now be shot.
"Surrender!" ejaculated a familiar
voice. "It is little Maria!"
The person was her own father. He
had started out to spy upon the Span
ish works. Maria was placed on J, Â»
saddle by her father, who rode rap
idly along the mountain road. As the
horse sped through the darkness she
told her story.
"Wonderful it all is, Maria," her
father said. "I will take you at once
to the American officer."
So it was through little Maria that
the Americans and Cubans learned of
the Spanish mines and all about thejr
forts, and she had well served her
country. The American officer gave
her a little American flag to pin on her
dress and a gold piece for her courage.

THE JUNIOR HEROES.
IF Uncle Sam, resplendent in his
striped breeches and star studded
coat, should ' -. ke Old Glory on his
shoulder and whistle "Yankee Doo
dle," as he tramped up and down
across the State of California he would
soon have an army of school children,
the junior heroes and heroines, at his
heels. San Francisco alone could fur
nish 60,000. Altogether there would be
enough in the State, ready to hold up
their right hands, and promise fealty to
"Old Glory" to fill up an army corps.
That would call for a major general,
brigadier generals, colonels, lieutenant
colonels, majors, captains and so on,
including some of the "swaggerest"
drum majors who can be imagined.
Not all of the officers could be boys.
The girls would form regiments and
even brigades, perhaps. Then and
there also little girls would be proud
drummers, lifers, buglers and color ser
vants, resplendent in military finery,
glad to uphold the honor of "Old
Glory," so dear to every American
child. Already there are many small
companies of children, who daily jump
into uniforms, get guns, work over the
manual of arms, march under the star
ry flag charge the Spaniards twenty
times a day and fight such battles that
the Board of Strategy at Washington
would be puzzled to guess what the
outcome of the several engagements
might be.
Now, The Cail wants to know all
about these companies and an invita
tion is hereby extended to all children
who have organized any sort of a mil
itary body to Bend word concerning tho
same to the editor of the Boys' and
Girls' page. Send in these facts: Name
of company, date '>f organization;
whether the little soldiers are cavalry,
artillery or infantry; names of officers
and members; names of musicians and
a little story about what the company
is doing; where and when it drills, and
what the uniform Is that has been
adopted.
To show the California children what
their little compatriots in the East are
doing some pictures are taken from the
New York Mail and Express. "No
where." says the Mail and Express,
speaking of the little soldiers of New
York city, "is the juvenile war spirit
stranger than above the Harlem, in the
borough of the Bronx. The youthful
defenders in and around East 13Stb
street are pupils of School No. 62. They
are led by a veritable Joan of Arc, a
breezy whirlwind of a girl, 12 years old,
Captain Ruth Rush. Nature did great
violence to this heroine's feelings when
she made her a girl. Ruth was an au
thority on all sports before this cruel
war began. She umpired the ball games
and was the court of last resort in all
the boys' disputes. When Uncle Sam
called for defenders Ruth got a bugle,
learned all the martial calls, rallied the
unquenchable sons of liberty in the
Bronx, and they drill and inarch to her
bugle music before and after School.
Captain Ruth has her hosts under per
fect discipline.
"Her word is law. Her orders are
obeyed with military promptness and
precision, or she knows the reason why.
She tolerates no 'monkeying' in the
ranks. John Stiner, her trusted lieu
tenant, is a very warlike disciple of
Captain Ruth. Another fierce regiment
of Bronx patriots is officered by Colonel
William Loseman, Captain Charles
Stuerer, Lieutenant Richard Warkin
and Privates Francis, Ranker, Keenan,
McCormack, Johnson, Hill, Thompson,
Brennan, Turkhoff, Rugler and Wal
lack."
There are every bit as bright soldier
boys and soldier girls in California as
there are in New York or in any other
place under the sun. Send in group
photographs and tell your stories. Do
not make the stories too long, but tell
all the facts.
Let us hear from "SlÃkiyou to San
Diego and from the Sierra to the sea,"
as the political speaker likes to say.
Wherever there is company of small
boys or small girls, who have the war
spirit, on the Pacific Coast, this invita
tion is Intended to reach. It will not
be necessary to be "strong on regi
mentals" to be pictured. Patriotism is
the thing. Any group not carrying the
American flag would be considered non
patriotic; but, of course, there are none
such.
Let it not be forgotten by the chil
dren that the first volunteer regiment
to set sail for a foreign country during
the present war was the first Califor
nia Volunteers.
Wherever there is an arm;' post on
the Pacific Coast there are stout-heart
ed boys and girls, whose fathers are en
listed under the flag. We hope to hear
from them. One of the sights of the
Presidio, for some years, has been the
uniformed small boys, dressed in the
reduced uniforms of their plucky sires,
cavalrymen, artillerymen, infantry.
Mars may have been said to have at
tended their birth. They are still at
tended by their mas. They are half
soldiers already.
The volunteers have left behind them
just as good little h oes and heroines
as there are to be found In the garri
sons. What a sight would be presented
by all the boys and girls on parade on
Market street some day. That would
be worth going a thousand miles to
view. As the war progresses and patri
otic fervor continually in reases that
may be possible. Why should there not
be such a parade? In the meantime
send in the pictures am. stories and
have a parade in miniature.

him one day that if he didn't quit being

THE PINK-LIPPED SHELL
CLOSE by the Singing River, in the
fairyland under Tamalpais Moun
tain, was a wonderful Pink-Lipped
Shell, that caught the songs which
the fairies and the trees and the
flowers and the marvelous river sing.
It was taken away from its bed among
the vines and grasses one day and was
carried to the Land of the Madrigal
Birds, to teach them songs to sing to
the Fairy Queen.
But lo! Once in that beautiful place,
the shell sang no more. Neither the
Fairy Queen's gentle magic nor the soft
pleading of the Madrigal Birds could
persuade it from silence.
"Go'" said the Fairy Queen to the
Rainbow Moth, her favorite messenger,
"seek out Goldilocks and tell her to
come; for the day the Pink-Lipped
Shell sings no more, that day even the
Bridal Flower must weep and the silver
bells of the Ivory Lilies jangle out of
tune. Make known to Goldilocks that
within the shell is imprisoned a fairy,
whose heart is sad awa- from the
Singing River; for in the river is the
Spirit of her lover. Yet will not the
fairy in the Shell nor the Spirit of the
Singing River be happy truly until
they have been united and have given
the gift of the best song to others."
When Goldilocks and I went in
through the carved Ivory Gate of
Fairyland the Fairy Queen was there
in a chariot drawn by doves, and she
held the silken reins in her own hands.
Goldilocks entered the chariot and sat
beside the Queen. A flying horse waited
for me and pawed the ground, impa
tient to be off.
"We rose up in the clear air and beau
tiful Fairyland, with its sparkling
lnkes, winding rivers, shining palaces,
flowery meadows and its lovely Rain
bow Mountains was in view. Goldi
locks could not help clapping her hands
with joy at the glorious landscape. On
the wind floated the sweet smell of the
Rose Meadows; over their flooring of
snow white pebbles and silvery gravel
bubbled countless beautiful brooks,
and fountains rose and fell in calm
lakes, which perfectly mirrored the
most wonderful of all vistas.
We reached the Land of the Madri
gal Birds, but not a sound arose. The
birds sat mute now, hopeless that the
Pink-Lipped Shell would ever sing to
them more. The heads of the royal
flowers were bowed; the Silver Willows
were trembling.
"You see," said the Queen to Goldi
locks, "that this will never do. Even as
you brought into Fairyland one day the
charm of an opal ring, so now we hope
that you have some charm to wake the
Pink-Lipped Shell. Then happiness
will, be overflowing, as always before, in
Fairyland."
Which Fairy told Goldilocks what to
do? The Madrigal Birds looked up and
seemed happier that she had come. The
Silver Willows rustled their leaves so
that they sounded like sighs, but all
the flowers opened their eyes, and the
wise Fairy Queen knew that this was
a sign.
"Part not the Fink-Lipped Shell and
the Singing River." commanded Goldi
locks. "Throw the Shell into the River.
Then the Fairy in the Shell will be
free at once to walk through the gal
leries of the River King's Palace."
"But the Shell is heavy, dear Goldi
locks," said the Queen. "With all our
strength we brought it here. Know that
it is a law of Fairyland that what a
Fairy does with the consent of the
Queen, that cannot be undone by any
Fairy; no, not even with the Queen's
consent."
Dear Little Goldilocks! Always gen
tle, unselfish and loving, she was
prompt to act now. In her snowy arms
she raised the Pink-Lipped Shell, bore
it to the Queen's chariot and flew away,
and I followed on the winged horse.
Among the oziers near the river bank
she crept, holding the Shell in her
arms.
Back she started with wonder, for
the river opened, the waters parted,
and from away down below came up a
song so faint and fine and sweet that
it might have been the fruit of a
blessed dream. Then from the Shell
came the same song, the answer. No
longer dumb, the Shell sang so sweetly
that the fairies, crowding to the river
brink, stood there enraptured, a happy
gathering. An impulse seized Goldi
locks to go forward and I followed.
The waters parted at our feet, and
shining steps of purest marble, emboss
ed with gold and precious stones, glit
tered before us. We went down hand
in hand, Goldilocks still holding the
Shell, from which came a song that
gradually broadened into a glorious
song of triumph. We passed through
three galleries, the first blue, with great
diamonds in the roofâ this to signify
the marvelous sky of midnight; then
the second was brown, like the fruitful
earth, and its carved columns were en
twined with Immortal Flowers, the
breath of which it is that confers end
less youth and endless life upon the
fairies; and then the third, green, like
the beautiful green of the great sea.
Suddenly this gallery was filled with
light and music. Over our heads the
water closed and was a polished roof
of emerald. Myriads of water fairies,
their dresses made gay with kelp and
the flowers that grow secretly in depths
of the sea, came forwai-d. They paused
to repeat the song which the Shell had
sung. Then the loveliest little being
appeared, and they all bowed to him
as to a King.
Goldilocks felt the Pink-Lipned Shell
slipping from her grasp. It fell from the
gallery into a crystal stream that rolled
below. At the touch of that magic
stream the Shell opened â opened as
gently as a flower that opens to greet
the morning. From it came the Fairy
Ariel. She was fairly dazzling. Indeed,
she was the handsomest fairy in all
the world.
At her appearance there was a greit
shouting and the Spirit of the River
came forward and took her hands.
"Free! My beloved at last!" she
said.
"Forever and forever!" answered the
Spirit of the Singing River.
Then the Nautilus came to ferry us
to upper air and the waves parted for
us. By the river stood all the fairies,
and there were the Madrfeal birds, and
their song, now that they had learned
it by magic, was the sweetest of all.
One second and the lovers sank below
the wave and there they wi'" dwell in
the River Palace forever. D. H. W.
And come pretty nigh it,
These guns would be sure to dent her.
Byron McClusky, author of the fore
going, is a happy little American boy, who
finds life is sweet and good, with oneâ
alas that there should be oneâ great big
drawback.
A boy must be grown up or at least
have attained to the dignity of long pants,

This ardent little American boy lives
with his parents on Lombard street, with
in sight of the Golden Gate, and within
hearing of the booming sunset gun at the
Presidio. When war was declared Byron
immediately decided there was work for
him to do. A flag pole was erected in
the back yard, and each morning the
stars and stripes are hoisted by this patri
otic little boy. When the band at the
Presidio blares out the inspiring "Star
Spangled Banner," and the guns thunder
a good night as the sun sinks behind the
hills, little Byron salutes the flag and
hauls the colors down. Since the country
will not send the patriotic little lad to
the "front" and the sword is denied him,
Byron has adopted the next best substi
tute â the penâ and he finds comfort in
verse and childish illustration to convey
his thoughts.

CLEVELAND OR
FREE SILVER
Democratic Party Must
Choose.
EX- PRESIDENT'S AMBITION
SEEKS TO HEAD THE TICKET
TWO YEARS HENCE.
Is the Logical Candidate Should
the Bourbons Make Their
Fight Upon a New
Issue.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Rigps House,
Washington, June 25.
Ex-President Cleveland's speech at
Lawrenceville on Tuesday is generally
regarded as a bid for the Presidential
nomination in 1900. He has sounded a
bugrle call which is expected to array
the Democratic party against the pro
posed policy of "conquest and expan
sion," and undoubtedly hopes to re
unite the two Democratic factions by
making this the issue of the next cam
paign Instead of the money question.
The following interview with Repre
sentative Livingston of Georgia reflects
the general opinion here as to Cleve
land's ambition:
"If the Democratic party is going to
lay aside the issue on which we fought
at the lu^t election and look for a new
issue over the question of Hawaii and
the Philippines Grover Cleveland is
the logical leader of the party. If this
is to be our course he is the logical
candidate for 1900. He has probably
read of the Democratic caucus and is
quick to seize his opportunity. If the
Democratic party is going to continue
its fight for free silver, then it can
have nothing to do with Grover Cleve
land. If free silver is to be the issue
we cannot burden ourselves with other
issues, particularly issues on which we
are divided.
'lUit it" the party is going to turn
aside and make an issue of opposition
to Hawaii, Cleveland is the logical
leader. He stands as the supreme head
of the opposition to the acquisition of
territory. Therefore, when he saw
what was going c.-n at Washington he
came out of obscurity, and, taking the
head of the line, sounded this bugle
call:
" 'The American people are tempted
every day and every hour to abandon
their accustomed way and enter upon
a course of new and strange advantage.
Never before in our history have we
been beset with temptations so danger-
OUfl aa those which now whisper in our
ears alluring words of conquest and ex
pansion and point out to us fields bright
with the glory of war.' "
