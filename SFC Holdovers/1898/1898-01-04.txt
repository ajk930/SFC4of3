DAWSON CITY PROBABLY
SAVED FROM FAMINE BY
THE EXODUS OF MINERS
Showing How the Ice Has Formed About the Boats of the Adventurous Gold-Seekers. From a Photograph Taken for The Call by
Sam W. Wall.
The latest arrivals in this city with
news and mail direct from Skaguay
and Dawson are Harry Dobson and J.
D. Barnes, who are at the Palace
Hotel.
These rugged gentlemen â who very
easily comport with the idea of the
typical miner on his return to civili
zation on business or pleasure or a
combination of the two were inter
viewed yesterday and they gave an
interesting account of their experi
ences in quest of beauteous yellow in
the icy northland and the conditions
of life which obtain in that Mecca of
the fortune hunter.
"Dobson, he's the talker of this out
fit," remarked Mr. Barnes. "You get
him started and he'll keep it up till
you get ail you want or I stop him.
He'll do the talking for the two of us,
and if he doesn't get things straight
I'll call him down."
Mr. Dobsan at once evinced a dis
position to corroborate his partner's
announcement, and proceeded to sup
port the same with the palpable evi
dence of speech.
"We left Dawson," he said, "on the
22d of November, with dogs and sleds,
and traveled down the Yukon Riverâ
which was frozen, of course â and then
over the many lakes â also frozen sol
idlyâln that region. Our journey was,
as you may imagine, full of hardship
and danger. We were frequently
obliged to cut our path through the
ice and snow. At night one of us was
obliged to keep awake to keep the fire
going, in order to prevent our freezing
to death.
"There would have been famine at
Dawson. with awful suffering if so
many men had not got away down the
river. There will be a shortage of food '
as it fs, but with care all who are on
the Klondike now will pull through.
The pressure of mouths to Ceed has
been lessened by the exodus
"Sam Wall, The Call's correspondent
at Dawson, is occupying our cabin and
looking out for our claims. Sam is a
thoroughbred, ajid no mistake! Dur
ing the short time he has been ther< he
has made hosts of friends by his gen
ial, kindly nature and no end of ad
mirers on the score of his daring voy
age up the river. Yes; Sam's all right
â they swear by him up there.
"Mr. Wall's statements of the condi
tions existing throughout that country
are invariably fair and reasonable. In
this connection, I will say that when
he was writing his last 'story' â the one
we brought through to Seattle â there
was danger of starvation, but since
then many have left for Skaguay and
Circle City, and the danger is now
reasonably over.
Joaquin Miller left for Circle City
with the rest of the crowd as soon as
the ghost of hunger commenced to
make its gloomy threats. He started
off ;it the head of a procession consist
ing of himself, a couple of dogs and a
sled, bravely trying to keep up his part
in a whistling duet with old Boreas,
interspersed with pathetic snatches
from 'Home, Sweet Home.'
"Dawson is the most peaceful mining
ramp ever known. Only two men havo
been killed this season, and they in

hand, no one can complain of the
treatment received from the represen
tatives of law and order.
"Sickness has been unknown this
winter. In fact, we are beginning to
think of booming Dawson as a health
resort. The air is very Invigorating,
and everybody seems full of life end
animal spirits."
Asked as to the chances of new
prospectors in Alaska next spring, Mr.
Dobson replied that they were very
encouraging. He stated that all the
best claims had been taken up, but
that there was no doubt of many more
discoveries being made in the near
future.
"The country is full of gold," he de

clared, with the familiar emphasis of
his manner of man on this sort of
theme, "and the near, future will see
many millionaires as Alaska's 'natural
product.'
"There is no doubt," continued Mr.
Dobson, "that a great many men will
go to the mines who have no business
to go there, nor anywhere else outside
the confines of civilization. Some of
them are men who are physically un
able to bear the rigors of the climate,
and others are men whose moral na
ture will make it hard for them to
thrive in that climate. It's the un
healthiest place on earth for crooks.
Some way or other, they can't stand
the climate â they are of necessity short
lived in that section.
"Then, again, doubtless a great
many men will go poorly equipped
with provisions, clothing and many
other necessities, and they will surely
suffer. All that go to that country
should take in at least a year's pro
visions and a full complement of the
various articles absolutely indispens
able to a miner's life in that region.
Those who make the pilgrimage in
the future will have a very great ad
vantage in being able easily to ascer
tain Just what Is neededâ thus bene
fiting from the hard experience of the
pioneers in Alaskan mining."

Messrs. Dobson and Barnes expect
to remain in this warmer zone for the

Against Him.

Bp*cial Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
MADRID. Jan. 3.â General Weyler
has defied the Government to take pro
ceedings against him. As he is a Sena
tor, a special vote is necessary to de
prive him of immunity from prosecu
tion, and the Cabinet is embarrassed,
as the army appears to side with Wey
ler in his attacks on the subject.
General Weyler's behavior, which is
classed here as "shuffling," in apolo
gizing to the Queen Regent and hastily
explaining to the Premier. Senor Sa
gasta, that he was not responsible for
the publication of his protest, has
alienated many of his supporters
among the Carlists, who hoped to en
tangle the General in the revolutionary
meshes. They are especially disap
pointed at the fact that the Govern
ment appears to be satisfied that the
so-called "VVeyier bubble has burst, and
that the Spanish army is not gan
grened.
It is said that only three of the Span
ish Generals are in sympathy with
General Weyler. The Government will
send 5000 troops to Cuba at the end of
January and further troops up to 14,
000 will be sent to that island if neces
sary.
COUNT ESTER HAZY TO BE
TRIED BY COURT-MARTIAL
PARIS. Jan. 3. â General Saussier,
the military governor of Paris, has de
cided to try Major Count Esterhazy by
court-martial behind closed doors on
January 10.
Count Esterhazy is the French offi
cer on the retired list who. at the time
of the Dreyfus agitation, was brought
into prominence by the publication in
the Figaro of a number of letters, of
which he has admitted the authorship,
reflecting most severely upon the
French army and upon France.
It has also been alleged that Count
Esterhazy was the author of an anony
mous note which played a prominent
part in the court-martial of Alfred
Dreyfus, the former captain of French
artillery sentenced to imprisonment for
life after having been convicted of sell
ing important military plans to agents
of a foreign power.
AUTHENTIC NEWS OF THE
MARCHAND EXPEDITION.
PARIS, Jan. 3.â Authentic news of
the Marchand expedition as late as
September IS has been received. At
that date it had arrived at Rafai, in
the Tambura district, and was pro
ceeding to occupy Itumbeka, in the
Bongo district, in the territory of
Bahr-el-Ghael. This disposes of the
rumors of the massacre of the expedi
tion in that Bection last August. All
were well at the time and fortnightly
mail service was working regularly be
tween Tambura and Banghi, on the
Ãbangi River, to the west.

Li Hung Chang's Appeal to the
Justice of the Western
World Has Set States
men Thinking.
MANCHESTER, Jan. 3.â
The Manchester Guardian
to-day says: The Govern
ment has categorically stated
that Great Britain will re
fuse to recognize any special
rights granted at any Chi
nese port to any particular
power. Any port opened to
one power must be opened to
ail or open to none. If Rus
sia has been granted the
right to winter ships at Port
Arthur, Great Britain will
enforce her rights to the
same privileges and her ships
will winter there whether
China concedes or does not
concede the right.
LONDON, Jan. 4.â The Shanghai cor
respondent of the Daily Mail says:
"The Russians tricked China into con
senting to an occupation of Port Arthur
by representing that the British neet
was coming to capture tt. They also
asked the Chinese to prohibit the Eng
lish from landing. The latter refused,
but the Englishmen going ashore at
Port Arthur are shadowed by the Rus
sians."
There is considerable activity in the
defense department. Lord Wolseley,
the commander-in-chief, came unex
pectedly to London to-day from
Brighton and spent several hours at
the War Office.
HONGKONG, Jan. 3.â The British
warship Powerful has arrived here.
The Powerful is a first-class cruiser
of over 14,000 tons displacement and
25,000 indicated horse-power, with an
estimated speed of about twenty-two
knots. She carries a crew of 840 men.
ST. PETERSBURG. Jan. 3.âNo

ing a Russo-Japanese alliance as the
best means of guaranteeing the mv-
tual interests and the maintenance of

It is reported this view is favored in
Russian official circles, where it is felt
that such an alliance would contribute
to avert such complications in the far
East.

LI HUNG CHANG
AROUSES THE WORLD
IN CHINA'S BEHALF.
The Old Diplomat's Able PresentAtion of ths
Case of His Nation Gives Statesmen
Food for Thought.
NEW YORK, Jan. 3.â A Washington
special says: The strong presentation
of China's case by Li Hung Chang
through the columns of the Herald
this morning attracted wide attention
in official Washington to-day. No
phase of this great international prob
lem yet presented through the medium
of the newspapers has been read with
deeper interest or has received more
serious consideration than the appeal
of the Chinese Minister of Foreign Af
fairs to the sense of Justice of the
Western World. It has been read and
discussed by State Department offi
cials, the diplomatic corps and mem
ber of the Foreign Affairs Committee
of Congress, and I understand will be
the subject of discussion at the Cab
inet meeting to-morrow.
"That is a very good presentation
of China's case," said Secretary Sher
man to me to-night, when he had fin
ished reading the exclusive interview
with Li Hung Chang published in the
Herald this morning. "The fact that
Germany has occupied Chinese terri
tory shows again the military weak
ness of the Peking Government, a
weakness first made apparent in its
recent war with Japan. I do not think
there is any present danger of dis
memberment of China by the Euro
pean powers. While we have no im
portant official information regarding
its occupation of Kiaoehau we under
stand that all Germany proposes to do
is to establish a commercial post at
that port. She has large interests in
China and has desired a port at which
they can receive protection. The es
tablishment of a commercial post at
Kiaoehau will be advantageous to the
commerce of the United States, Just as
the possession of Hongkong by Great
Britain is beneficial to our shipping.
It opens up a new point for the recep
tion and distribution of American
goods where Americans may obtain
protection.
"We have been given to understand
by the Russian Government that the
SAM W. WALL2
stationing of ships at Port Arthur is
but temporary and is due to the fact
that they would be frozen in if they
wore to anchor in the harbor of
Vladivostok during the winter. They
will leave Port Arthur during the com
ing spring."
"Do you believe, Mr. Secretary," I
asked, "that there is danger of a gen
eral European war?"
"No; I have no idea that war will
grow out of the Chinese question at
this time. In the first place at tht
points at which Russian ships are lo
cated, Japanese are established, the
Germans have landed and the British
and French are stationed at several
hundred miles apart. As I have said
before, I do not believe there is any
present probability of the division of
China. Should such division occur,
then this government would have to
determine what steps would be neces
sary in order to adequately protect
American interests."
One of the effects of the Herald's
elaborate presentation of the Chinese
situation is the consideration which the
President is now giving to the appoint
ment of a new minister to China. It
was decided some days ago to allow the
name of Mr. Page Bryan to be laid
before the Senate for confirmation.
Since the publication in the Herald this
morning, however, the eyes of the au
thorities have been opened as to the
Importance of the Chinese mission and
the necessity for having it filled by the
ablest man that can be induced to take
it. This matter will be discussed at
the Cabinet meeting to-morrow also,
and if they decide upon a good man,
some other place than the Peking mis
sion will be provided for Mr. Bryan.
Li Hung Chang's appeal for inter
national justice meets with hearty
sympathy from most all of the public
men here. While public men gener
ally sympathize with China, and while
some Senators and Representatives go
so far as to advocate firm remonstrances
by the United States, it is not prob
able that anything will be done. I was
told at the British embassy to-day that
no official information has been re
ceived in regard to the Eastern situa
tion. The report that a British man
of-war had fired on a Russian vessel
is believed to be unfounded, but the
action of the British authorities in
urging the reinstatement of Mr. Mc-
Leavey Brown, a British citizen, who
occupied a high position in the Korean
customs service, and who was dis
miss- d in order that his place might be
taken by a Russian, is looked upon as
an indication that Great Britain will
see that her rights and the rights of
her citizens are fully respected.
GRANTED A DIVORCE
FOR DESERTION
Mrs. Susan Sewall Secures
Liberation From Her
Husband.
Dissolute Habits of Arthur Sewall's
Nephew Cause Him to Lose
His Ship and His Wife.
BOSTON, Jan. 3 âThe January ses
sion of the divorce court, Judge Blod
gett, began this morning. There were
forty-three cases on the uncontested
docket. Several divorces were granted
for desertion. Among these was that
of Mrs. Susan Sewall against E. R. Se
wall. Mr. Sewall is the nephew of Ar
thur Sewall, the famous shipbuilder of
Bath, Me., and late candidate for Vice-
President of the X'nited States.
Mrs. Sewall, whose maiden name was
Baker, was married in San Francisco
in 18S6. Sewall was a shipmaster, and
his wife accompanied him for four
years on his voyages in different parts
of the world. Mrs. Sewall testified that
her husband's habits of drinking lost
him command of his vessel in 1R92 In
that year Mrs. Sewall visited her pa
rents in Harwich in this State, and
afterward she went with her husband
to his home in Bath. They returned
to Harwich and soon after Mr. Sewall
went away professedly on business
Since that time his wife has seen him
but once, and that was at the Adams
House ;n this city in October, 1892
bhe heard of him in New Jersey and
in San Francisco, where he had asso
ciations with other women. During this
time Mrs. Sewall has lived at 21? Co

supported herself by dressmaking.
SMOKELESS POWDER TRIED
WITH SATISFACTORY RESULTS.
Contracts for a Large Supply Made With
the Duponts and the California

WASHINGTON. Jan. 3.-Smokeless
powder has been thoroughly tried in
the smaller guns with satisfactory re
sults. The new powder is a special va
riety of nitro cellulose, and it is guar
anteed not to deteriorate with age nor
to lose its efficiency through climatic
changes.
Contracts for a large supply of this
powder have been made with the Du

Special Dispatch to the Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 3.â There was a
i pleasant gathering this morning in the
office of Major Land, the purpose be
: ing to extend to the new municipal
executive the congratulations of the re
tiring members of the Board of Trus
tees, and the good wishes and assur
\ ances of those just entering upon the
â  duties involved in the legislative de
partment of Sacramento City. In the
little room of the Mayor there asscn
' bled the ingoing and outgoing Trustees,
ex-Mayor Huhhard, several city oftt
: cials, a great many candidates for office
; and the local representatives of the
; press. Trustee Bently stepped forth,
i and, addressing the Mayor, said:
On behalf of those members of the
beard who will srrve the people of Sac
ramento tor the next two years. I desire
to extend to you our assurances of con
fidence and a desire to co-operate with
you in harmony, good will and a com
plete understanding in all matters af
fecting the public good. You have no
doubt already discovered that there are
many very annoying and vexatious fea
tures connected with the high office you
have been selected to fill; you have no
doubt heard many rumors of the de
mands which will be made and the ex
pi-i tutions which art- indulged In by tin
members of the board: bm i desire to say
in my own behalfâ and 1 believe I an
voicing the sentiments of my colleagues
âthat bo far us the placing of obstacles
in your way by the preseni board is con
cerned, you will find that such rumors
are based upon a false and unjustified
basis.
We desire to enter with you upon the
duties of our respective trusts in such a
manner as will lead to â  confidence and
trust of one another and a frank and
fair exchange of opinions and beliefs
upon questions affecting the city's best
interests.
To the outgoing Mayor we have noth
ing but the kindliest of feelings; we wish
him a happy and prosperous new year.
To you wo extend the same, and on be
half of the Board of Trustees I now wel
come you to our councils as the Mayor
of Sacramento city.
Mayor Land replied briefly as fol
lows:
I thank you most heartily for your
kind words of encouragement and ex
pressions of esteem. I shall be pleased
to do all 1 can toward insuring the pleas
ant relations you have spoken of. As the
Mayor of this city 1 take office with no
strings on me. and am responsible to no
one but myself and the people who
elected me. I shall conduct the affairs
of the municipality as 1 have conducted
my own, and I assure you there will be
no man on the city's pay roll who does
not properly perform the duties assigned
him.
The old board was called to order
by President Leonard, and the bills of
the month audited. This was the last
official act of the old board, and at 12
o'clock it adjourned.
When the new board convened this
evening it organized by electing D.
McK&y president. It then appointed
a committee on resolutions, which re
ported later and conveyed expressions
complimentary in their nature to the
retiring members. The Mayor-elect
read his inaugural address, it called
attention to the crippled condition of
municipal finances and the burden im
posed by the allotment of the greater
part of all city revenues to the pay
ment of the funded debt, and said that
any method that promises relief from
the present heavy rate of taxation
should receive earnest attention. The
Mayor hoped for a decision favorable
to the city in the case of Kendall vs.
Porter, involving the liability of the
city for interest on past due bonds.
This would make the yoke of bonded
indebtedness comparatively light, while
an adverse decision would subject the
city to an additional burden of about
$183,000.
The indebtedness of the city in 1898
was shown to be $561, 252. The assets
amount to $414,167 IS, leaving a debt
balance of $147,12518. When in pay
ment of this amount the sum of $127
800, which it is estimated will be re
ceived from the remainder of the taxes
of 1897, not yet collected and appor
tioned, and from other sources, is ap
plied, the debt will be reduced to a
little over $19,000â an inconsiderable
debt for a city of Sacramento's size
and wealth.
The Mayor recommended that the
city provide a place suitable for the
keeping of public funds, and thus at
once comply with the mandate of the
law and free the treasury from politi
cal influences. There was great need,
he said, of the extension of the street
improvements and of the keeping in
condition of the streets already im
proved, but the street fund, as ivnv
apportioned, was inadequate to meet
the demands upon it. The fund
should be increased to at least 16
cents, and he was also of the belief
that there should be at least 3 cents
added to the amount now apportioned
to the sewer fund. The efficiency of
the Police Department would be
greatly promoted by the addition of
two more officers to the present force
and also by the appointment of two
competent detectives. Continuing he
said:
The prevailing tax rate has apparently
been excessive, but past administrations
in their desire to lessen it have allowed
but too little to the various special funds
compelling transfers to them when they
become low from the general fund, there
by causing a deficit at the end of the
year, as is evidenced by the- fact thnt
during the pant two months the general
fund has been exhausted. This has ne
cessitated the non-payment of salaries
during this period, and they must remain
unspttlpd until the revenues for the next
year are received. Enough ravenuÂ«
should be raised each year to liquidate
the indebtedness of the municipality for
such year and not compel the old vonr
to intrench upon the now. The fact that
the general fund for the past year is
some 114.000 to $16,000 short, and, as al
ready stated, that more money will be
needed for the street and sewer funds
may propably force the new administra
tion to increase the tax levy slightly In
this connection, however. I will say that
if the city is not visitf-d by the Supreme
Court with the misfortune of an adverse
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JAXTJATCY 4, 1898.
CROWDED BY THE CALL.
Lee McLaughlin, the Postmaster of Sanger, a lumber town about twelve miles south of Fresno, on the
Southern Pacific Railroad, was so astonished at receiving fourteen sacks of mail-matter filled with copies of the
mammoth New Era edition of The Call that, after he had distributed most of them in the boxes, he sent for
the local photographer and, inviting him inside, had a picture of himself and the mail he was trying to handle
taken. Lee McLaughlin never expects to be so terribly put about again in the exercise of his functions, and
therefore commemorated his odd plight for future generations to gaze upon.
decision in the case of Kendall vs. Porter,
before mentioned, saddling upon us the
obligation of paying interest on bonds
past due. then the prospect for an eariy
and very material reduction in our tax
rat,- Is exceedingly bright.
The usefulness of the Fire Depart
ment and its efficiency in the protec
tion "f property would be greatly en
hanced, he thought, by the addition of
a chemical engine to its equipment.
He believed the time was near when
Sacramento could afford to considi r
the question of a new City Hall in
keeping with her industrial and <"> n- ;
mercial importance. The public health
demands that the sewer system be
improved and extended. He closed
with the hope that his relations with
the Council would always be harmo

dike-bound," Watson says, "I was told
â¢i strange story. A son of Chilkoot
Jack, one of the chiefs, had been pack
ing between the coast and Dawson
during the summer and fall, during
which time he claimed tÂ«i have met an
Indian from one of the Yukon tributar
ies who had struck a peerless district.
This latter Indian said he was hunting
some distance from Dawson, when he
happened to examine the bottom of a
creek and found in it what he took to
be gold nuggets.
"Not certain of his own judgment, he
sot a few and traveled down the
stream until near Dawson he found a
white man living with a squaw. This
man pronounced the nuggets pure and
importuned the Indian to tell where
they were found, without avail. The
Indian said he returned secretly to the
creek and labored there all summer,
gathering along its bed as many nug
uÂ»-ts as he could with his limited faclli
tii-s. He erected a cabin and stored his
findings there, until he hid seven-fold
more than he could carry. He then left
in search of his friends who lived along
the o".!!-t, who were to aid him in car
rying his gold out of the mountains
"Chilkoot Jacks sun told me ibis in
confidence, and I believe he really met
some Indian who furnished the infor

anywbetff along the Yukon or tributar

Watson is organizing an expedition
in Alaska to search for this treasure.
WINNECKE'S COMET SEEN
FROM LICK OBSERVATORY.
Professor Perrine Rediscovers the Wan
derer of the Skies First Observed
by Pons in 1819.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 3.â The following
message was received to-night from
Lick Observatory:
Wlnaecke's periodic comet was re
discovered at the Lick Observatory by
C. l>. Perrine on January L 1898, at 2
hours 5 minutes 42 seconds, between
Greenwich mean time. The comet's posi
tion was right ascension 15 hours 19
minutes 2 61-100 seconds, past south
declination 3 degrees 58 minutes 34 3-10
seconds. This position Is two minutes
of time east and about nine minutes of
an arc south of its predicted place. It
is a very faint object.even with the large
telescope, and while it will in all prob
ability grow considerably brighter, yet
its position is such that it will not be
close enough to the earth to be visible in
small telescopes.
This comet was first discovered in ISl*
by Pons. but was not again seen until it
was discovered as a new comet by Win
necke, whose name it now bears. It has
been observed on several subsequent re
turns, among the. last In 1892. It will
make its closest approach to the sun on
March 20, 1898, at a distance of 52.000
miles.

PIONEER WOMAN
DIES SUDDENLY
Passing of Mrs. Rachel Miner
Kindred at Her Home Near
New Astoria.
Was a Great-Grandnieco of Daniel
Boons and Her Life Was Full
of Adventurs,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ASTORIA. Or., Jan. 3.â Mrs. Rachel
Minor Kindred, wife of B. C. Kindred,
one of the pioneer women of Oregon
and said to be the first white woman
who settled on Clatsop plains, â¢ this
county, died suddenly yesterday at
her home near New Astoria.
Mrs. Kindred was a native of Ken
tucky, and a great-grandniece of
Daaie| Hoone. Like that of her illus
trious ancestor, her life was full of
<'f courage and endurance. She
came to Oregon, with her husband, in
IM4, arriving on December 23 at Os
wego, on the Willamette River, near
the present site of Portland. During
the winter of lS4f> Mr. and Mrs. Kin
dred came to Clatsop plains, and soon
after settled upon their donation
claim, now known as New Asturia and
Kindred Park, where Mrs. Kindred
has continuously resided until her
death. She was one of the best known
and most famous women in Oregon's
early annals. She was the mother of
twelve children, all born in Oregon,
and all of whom .survive, except one,
who died from accident.
Mrs. Kindred's death was due to an
aneurism of a large artery, a disorder
from which she has suffered for three
yean past, and which her physician
warned her family at the time* of its
discovery might cause her sudden
death at any time. At the time the
summons came Mrs. Kindred was
walking alone on the county road near
her home. She was seen to fall to
the ground and assistance hastened to
her. She never recovered conscious
ness, and died a few minutes after her
removal to her home. She was in the
seventy-seventh year of her age.
The funeral services will be con
ducted by the Pioneer Society, of
which her huhband is a member, and
she will be buried on Wednesday aft
ernoon in the old Pioneer Cemetery on
Clatsop plains.

TAKES A BRIDE

They Met by Chance at the
Metropolis Only a Week
Ago.
European Trip Each Had Planned in
San Francisco Turned Into a
Bridal Tour.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 3. â Although
Alderman Ackerman of Brooklyn car
ried off the honors for the first mar
riage in Greater New York, Alderman
Thomas McGuire was boasting that he
had officiated at the most romantic
of twelve marriages performed in the
City Hall to-day.
The high contracting parties in the
romantic marriage were Crittenden
Robinson, 47 years old, and Mrs. Min
nie H. Holtau, a widow, seventeen
years younger. Both of them are from.
San Francisco. Both had arrived in
this city on their way to Europe. They
met in this city by chance last week.
Mr. Kobinson suggested to Mrs. Hol
tau that she remain here for the cele
bration of the birth of Greater New
York, as he intended to do, and she
accepted his suggestion.
Together they saw the carnival, on
Friday night from the City Hall. They
were there again the next day to see
Mayor Van Wyck inaugurated, ami
together they attended the first ses
sion of the Municipal Council. As
they were viewing the sights of the
City Hall on Saturday they saw the
marriage bureau. They drifted to it
again to-day; then decided that they
might as well take advantage of its
facilities, and Alderman MrGuire was
asked to make them one. The Euro
pean trip each planned in San Fran
cisco was thus transformed in this city
into a bridal tour.
SEEKING A FREE
RURAL POSTAL DELIVERY.
Congressman Loud Asks for His District a
Service Highly Praised by the
Department.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3.âCongress
man Loud was at the Postoffice De
partment to-day to see about the es
tablishment of free rural delivery in
his district. It will be remembered
that the annual report of First Assist-
ant Postmaster General Heath said
that of all places in the United States
for free rural delivery Santa Clara
County was ideal, and especially the
town of Campbell, in Santa Clara
County, as a distributing center.
Loud is making earnest endeavors
to secure free rural delivery for that
section. It appears, however, that the
Postoffice Committee of the House of
Representatives, of which Mr. Loud is
chairman, has decided not to- make as
large an appropriation for free deliv
ery in the various cities and towns as
was recommended by the Postofflce
Department. It is the desire of
Speaker Reed, Mr. Dingley, Mr. Loud
and other leaders of the House to be
as economical as possible in govern
ment expenditures until the Dingley
tariff revenue met the expenditures.
Fur this reason, according to Post
office otlicials, there must be a reduc
tion in the number of letter-carriers
in the large cities, such as New York,
Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago, St.
Louis and San Francisco. In New
York, for instance, there have been
six or seven deliveries of mail in the
resident districts, and it is now pro
posed to have only four deliveries a
day. This programme, if carried out,
will necessitate a reduction of letter
carriers in all the big cities of the
United States, including San Fran
cisco. It is expected that the Letter
Carriers' Association and the Postal
I"niÂ«m will make a vigorous protest
against such a reduction of the letter
carriers' force.
Mr. Loud hopes that It will not be
necessary to reduce the force of let
ter carriers at San Francisco, but at
the same time insists that the towns
that are by law entitled to free deliv
ery should be provided for. He does
not believe that the big cities should
monopolize the appropriation made by
Congress for free delivery. He will
insist that free delivery be established
in the towns of his district and will
especially urge that the town of
Campbell be made a central distrib
uting point for free delivery in Santa
Clara County.

TULARE`S DEPOT
SITE CLEARED
Everything in Readiness for the
Coming of the Valley
Road,
Heavy Traffic Assured the New Lin*
When Its Extension la
Built.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TULARE, Jan. 3.â The last house on
the depot site of the Valley road right
of way in Tulare has been removed
and everything is now in readiness for
the extension so far as Tulare is con
cerned. The right of way committee
has done successful work in clearing
away obstructions, and, while some
cash subscriptions are still outstand
ing and will be needed before rails are
laid to Tulare, these will be forthcom
ing at the proper time.
It is understood that the work of ex
tension from Visalia through Tulare to
a junction with the Hanford-Bakers
field line will be resumed at an early
date, and that trains will be running
over the new road early in the spring.
The late frosts, which have been
unusually severe, have had the effect
of keeping back the buds on the vines
and fruit trees, consequently a large
fruit yield is anticipated. Every avail
able foot of land has been or is being
put into wheat, so that with the spring
rains, which are now promising, the
yield of grain will again be very large.
The shipments of stock from Tulare in
the past two years have increased
many fold, and those of next year will
be larger than ever before in the his
tory of Tulare County. The Valley
road people are fully alive to this and
will leave no stone unturned in order
that they may get their share of the
traffic already in view.

LONDON', Ontario, Jan. 3.â Thirty
persons are known to have been killed
and many injured by the collapse of a
floor in the City Hall to-night. To
night closed the municipal campaign,
and the hall was crowded to hear the
addresses of the successful candidates.
At midnight the bodies of the follow
ing had been taken out of the wrecked
building and identified:
F. HEAMAN,
C. BECKET,
E. LUXTON,
N. CAROTHERS,
R. LEIGH,
â HARRIS,
T. W. BURKE,

JAMES McLEAN,
JOHN BARRIDGE,
OSWALD BRUCE,
B. JACQUES,
W. H. DELL,
STEPHEN WILLIAMS,
JOHN FELLOWS,
ALLEN TO WE.
The ituiains of an unidentified man
were also taken from the building.
The injured, so far as can be learned,
include the following: Dr. Wilson, the
Mayor elect, leg broken; Alderman
Carothers, slightly injured; Edward
Mopkin; â Burgess; 'William Gray, leg
broken; â Fleming, both arms broken;
W. Jones, Water Commissioner elect,
badly bruised; Joshua Darchud; John
Blanch; Alderman Xeil Cooper; â Van
V.'yck; George Wyales, city editor
News; Harry Passmore, reporter on
the Advertiser staff.
Those who were seriously injured
were taken to neighboring drug stores,
whence they were taken to the hos
pital or to their homes, after their in
juries had been attended to. The dead
were taken to the committee rooms of
Alderman Parnell, the defeated candi
date for Mayor, directly across the
street.
At the close of the polls a crowd had
gathered in the City Hall, where it
had been the custom in years past for
the successful candidates to address
the electors. The building was crowded
to the very doors, probably 2000 people
being jammed in its narrow space.
There was a lull in the proceedings
when the audience called for several
of the newly elected Aldermen at once
and there was some delay in securing
a speaker to address them. Alderman
Carothers joined the Mayor in an ef
fort to secure quiet. In response to
numerous calls, R. M. Toothe was
pushed forward to the platform on
which the speakers stood. As he
reached it there was an ominous' crack
ling and the raised platform on which
the Mayor and newly elected Alder
men were seated seemed to pitch for
ward to the floor.
There was a sagging of timbers, and
the next moment 150 people were hurled
twenty feet to the floor below. A beam
running twenty feet along the center
of the hall had given away and the
crowded mass standing above that sec
tion of the floor was thrown in a heap
to the bottom. A large safe stood in
one corner of the hall and, with a huge
steam coil, weighing half a ton, came
crashing down on the heads of the vic
tims.
Following the crash there was a wild
rush for the doors. At the south door,
where the majority of the crowd had
"ntf-red, there was a terrific panic.
Those in front were thrown down by
the on-coming rush, shrieking and
fighting for the door and safety. Only
one-half of the rear door, a space- of
probably three feet, was open and in
the mad rush no one thought to open
the door in its entirety, and 500 peo
ple struggled through the narrow
the strong bearing down the
weaker.
Alderman Neil Cooper was among
the first to be dragged out of the mass
of broken beams. He was quickly car
ried to an adjacent room and in a mo
ment half a dozen more were keeping
him company.
Several men lowered ropes and en
deavored to haul the wounded out of
the pit. From under the massed weight
of the broken beams came many cries
for help. The windows on the ground
floor were broken in and living and the
dead were tenderly passed to the wait
ing ambulance.
. An investigation of the wreck after
the catastrophe disclosed the fact that
a whole section of the floor had
dropped, the joists having been as
neatly cut off as though the work had
been done with a saw.
The building was an old one, having
been erected in the early fifties, and of
late years additional stories had been
placed on the old walls.
In the Grand Opera House, which
joins the wrecked building, the first act
of "The Girl From Paris" had been
completed when word was whispered
through the theater of the disaster. A
panic was imminent, but was averted
by the actors and ushers, and the peo
ple quietly left the building.
Many of those carried down by the
falling floor were boys 14 to 16 years
of age. Some of them managed to
squirm from under heavy beams,
where men could not move. Despite
this, however, a number of them were
killed, their lives being crushed out of
them by the beams which gradually
settled upon them, borne down by the
heavy iron safe and the steam coil
which had fallen on top of the wreck
age.
Aldermen Carothers and Taylor, al
though injured and covered with
blond, tried to secure some s<rrt of or
der find system in the rescue work,
but the excitement was so great that
they could make but little impression
on the crowd.
Although the platform on which the
speakers of the evening were stand
ins was apparently the first to give
way the Mayor-elect and many Alder
men escaped the death that overtook
so many others who followed them in
to the lower portion of the building.
An inquest has been ordered for to
morrow morning.
MINISTER RODRIGUEZ
NOT LIKELY TO RETURN.
The Meddling Central American Diplomat
May Be Declared Persona Non Grata
in This Country.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 3.â lnformation
has been received here to the effect that
Senor Jose de Rodriguez, minister of
the Greater Republic of Central Amer
ica to the I'nited States, who is now
in Nicaragua on leave of absence, is not
likely to return to this country as the
diplomatic representative of the Diet of
Central America. Senator Morgan has
indicated that he will ask the President
to declare Senor Rodriguez persona non
grata should he return to this country,
with the view of insuring his recall.
The objection to Senor Rodriguez is
based upon his alleged action in urging
the Diet not to permit Nicaragua and
Salvador to receive William L. Merry
as the diplomatic representative of the
I'nited States on the ground that he
should be accredited to the Diet. Sena
tor Morgan's objection is that Senor
Rodriguez interfered with legislation
by writing a letter to Secretary of State
Olney in which he criticized the Nica
raguan canal bill pending in the Sen
ate.
CONSOLIDATION OF
THREE REPUBLICS
Plans of Nicaragua, Salvador

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Jan. 3.
The complete consolidation of Nicar
agua, Salvador and Honduras into a
sovereign republic is progressing
steadily, according to advices received
by Senor Correa, Charge d'Affaires of
the Greater Republic of Central Amer
ica. Mr. Correa is advised that the
Diet has completed a constitution for
the Greater Republic, with full legis
lative powers. The next step will be
to convene a constitutional assembly, ;
with twenty delegates from each of
the three countries, to pass upon the
constitution. The assembly is ex- j
pected to be held during the coming
spring.
Senor Correa has advices from Nic- i
aragua as late as December 16, stat- !
ing that an amicable adjustment has
been reached between Nicaragua and \
Costa Rica over the imprisonment of
the Costa Rica Consul-General. It was
feared at one time that this arrest
would lead to war, but Senor Correa
feels sure that the incident is satisfac- ;
torily closed.
The Charge haa received no official
information on the reported uprising
In Salvador, and for this reason is in- j
clined to discredit the stories of serious
trouble.
DEATH ENDS HIS
LONG DEBAUCH
Cyrus A. Gelatte Succumbs to
Heart Failure at San
Jose.
Excessive Use of Alcoholic Stimu
lants Responsible for His
Demise.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 3.â Cyrus A. Ge
latte, who has been employed as a
bookkeeper in San Francisco, died
suddenly this morning at the resi
dence of his wife at 124 East San Sal
vador street. An autopsy and inquest
this afternoon showed that death re
sulted from heart failure, caused by
excessive use of alcoholic spirits. Ge
latte was a native of Wisconsin, and
49 years of age.
Gelatte and his wife have not lived
together for a number of years owing
to his drunkenness. Three months ago
he came to this city, got drunk and
tried to shoot his wife. He was ar
rested, but allowed to go on condition
that he would leave town. Last night
Gelatte came home again. His eyes
were black, his face skinned, and he
plainly showed the result of a de
bauch. His wife was awakened by his
heavy breathing, and she found him
in a dying condition. Physicians were
summoned, but he died before they ar
rived. At first it was thought these
wounds had caused his death.
About a week ago Gelatte was re
moved as assignee of the T. J. Gilles
pie Planing Company. His dilatory
action in accounting for property and
his transferring 60,000 feet of lumber,
valued at $1500, to the Union Lumber
Company of San Francisco were the
causes that led to his dismissal. The
creditors claimed that the lumber be
longed to the insolvent estate. Ge
latte had also failed to account for
$290 cash he had collected as assignee.
He was ordered to render an account
ing to F. B. Brown, who succeeded
him as assignee, but since then he has

SHIPS OF WAR
FOR ESQUIMALT
British Vessels Phaeton
and Sparrowhawk Ar
rive at San Diego.
The One a Torpedo- Destroyer
and the Other a Second-
Class Cruiser.
Heavy Gales Encountered Since They
Started for the Pacific Coast
Stronghold.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO, Jan. 3.â Her Britannic
Majesty's ships Phaeton and Sparrow
hawk arrived in the harbor this after
noon, en route to Esquimalt. The
Sparrowhawk, a thirty-knot torpedo
destroyer, of the same clas6 and size
as the Virago, came into the bay at
a high rate of speed and stopped with
in almost her own length. The Phae
ton, a second-class cruiser of 4300 tons
displacement, arrived two hours later.
Both vessels will remain until Thurs
day and will then proceed, via San
Francisco, to the northern stronghold
of Great Britain.
The two ships left Vigo, Spain, a
fortnight later than the Leander and
Virago left Plymouth, and have al
most caught up with them. Yet the
14,000 miles traversed was by easy
stages, the vessels casting anchor fre
quently. Severe storms were encoun
tered at several points. The first â
north of St. Vincents, Cape Verde
Islands â was very hard upon the little
Sparrowhawk. A pampero was en
countered off Montevideo, and later in
that roadstead one of the Phaeton's
boats was lost. In the straits the
yparrowhawk fared quite badly, mon
strous seas sweeping her low decks
and flooding the captain's quarters
twice. The Phaeton, of course, went
â¢through the gales and high seas with
comparatively little discomfort.
At Valparaiso a boat's crew from the
Phaeton defeated a crew from the Chil
ean cruiser Almirante Cochran. The
excitement was great, and the Chilean
hluÂ»jackets lost all their spare money.
Nothing of importance was noted by
the officers on their way up the west
coast, the weather being fair and no
war vessels spoken. The two ships left
Acapulco on Monday, December t~.
The officers of the Phaeton and Spar
row hawk were entirely ignorant of the
events that have transpired lately in
China and were eager for news. The
last paper they had seen was an En
plish daily, dated November 19. They
<lis"ussed the Eastern situation with
great animation, and evinced a lively
desire to go over to China themselves,
but their general conclusions were that
no war was in sight.
The Bp&rrowhawk is a sister ship of
the Virago, and, like her, is expected
to make history in the Pacific Ocean
should war occur. The Phaeton, also,
is a sister of the Leander, carrying
ten 6-inch rifles in her main battery.
With these vessels at Esquimalt. that
station will be more formidably
equipped than ever before. The of
ficers were asked why Great Britain
was strengthening her force in the
North Pacific, and they denied that
such was the case.
"We are simply replacing old, prac
tically obsolete vessels with others of
greater steaming radius." they said.
Thpy admitted, however, that the
torpedo destroyers were an addition to
the naval force in the Pacific, and per
haps the most destructive of any ves
sels yet sent from England.
IS ACTOR RATCLIFFE
A BRUTAL BIGAMIST?
From London Comes a Story That He Was
Married to Caroline Ravenhill
in 1883.
NEW YORK, Jan. 3.â The Sun's Lon
don cable says: The Daily Mail asserts
that E. J. Ratcliffe, the actor who was
recently sentenced in New York to six
months' imprisonment for beating his
wife, is a bigamist. The paper prints
an interview with his English wife
who is living in London. Her name
prior to her marriage was Caroline
Ravenhill. Her marriage certificate
shows that she was wedded to Ratcliffe
on August 19, 1883. After she had been
married nineteen months, during which
time a son was born, Ratcliffe treated
her with such cruelty that she was
compelled to leave him. Shortly after
Ratcliffe left for America. Mrs. Rat
cliffe has never since received direct
communication from her husband, but
received through his mother, in 1886
two photographs which had been taken
in San Francisco. Both were indorsed
with messages to her. After the receipt
of these photographs Mrs. Ratcliffe
never heard from her husband again.
Ratcliffe was seen in the Tombs early
this morning and asked if the report
that he was married in England was
true. The actor replied: "The whole
story is utterly absurd. Such a mar
riage never occurred. They must neve
gotten hold of some other case."

SUBSIDIES FOR
OCEAN LINERS
Conditions Under Which
New Zealand Obtains
Mail Service.
Insures Fortnightly Steamers
From America to the
Antipodes.
Trip From San Francisco to Auckland
to Be Made Within Nine
teen Days.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA. Jan. 3.â Particulars of
the conditions under which New Zea
land has agreed to subsidize a mail
service to Vancouver as well as that
to San Francisco have just been re
ceived here, and mark the conclusion
of negotiations which have been going
on for more than two years. Until
lately the steamers of the Canadian
line have touched at New Zealand, but
this connection was made a few
months ago in advance of the subsidy
which then had become an assured fact
through the Ministry personally as
senting to the arrangement.
The point of most interest to the gen
eral public in connection with the new
arrangement is that it assures a fort
nightly service between America and
Australasia, the steamers of the two
lines subsidized sailingalternately every
two weeks, while heretofore their sail
ing dates were often close together, the
one line making trips every four weeks
or thirteen in a year, and the others
setting out on a fixed date in each cal
endar month.
A determined effort was made on the
part of Wellington to have that city
made the port of - call . for : San Fran
cisco service in place of Auckland, as
at present, but it failed, and the Legis
lature has agreed to continue the sub
sidy to the San Francisco line for a
year from March 31. 1898. on the follow
ing somewhat modified conditions:
Second-That the basis of Payment
Z O /al\nV? nY ! yan Â£? Â° f mailÃ 'ronfxew
Zealand to San Francisco shall be at
the rate of 10 shillings 5 pence per
pound for letters. 1 shlllln per pound
for books, packets, etc.. and 8 pence per
pound for newspapers, with a guar
anteed minimum payment of Â£7500.
ThirdâThat the port of call in the
colony shall be Auckland.
Fourthâ That the time between San
Francisco and Auckland shall not ex
ceed nineteen days.
Fifthâ That no bonus shall be paid
for early arrival; a penalty at the rate
of Â£4 an hour to be enforced when late
delivery exceeds forty-eight hours.
Sixthâ at least one New Zealand
owned steamer shall be employed in
the service.
Seventh-That all payments or con
tributions from Great Britain or other
countries shall be . receivable by the
contractors. :,â -?.:':'â .;;
Eighthâ That the passage rates and
rates for freight shall be fixed and em
bodied in the contract.
The terms proposed for the extension
of the San Francisco contract are de
scribed in the advices received as not
of a very liberal character. The colony
has been paying 11 shillings per pound
for letters, the total amount being
about Â£7600 per year. It is now pro
posed to pay 10 shillings 5 pence per
pound, with a guaranteed minimum of
Â£7500. The time between San Fran
cisco and Auckland, formerly twenty
days, is now to be nineteen.
The subsidy now for the first time
granted to the Canadian service sup
plements liberal payments already
made by the three Governments of
Great Britain, Canada and ' New
South Wales. It is for weekly serv
ice between New Zealand and the
ports of Victoria and Vancouver
British Columbia, by way of Fiji and
Honolulu from December, 1897 to
March 31, 1899, upon the following
conditions:
2. Payment for mails to be 10s 5d
per pound for letters, Is for books,
packets, etc., and *5d for newspapers
with guaranteed minimum payment
of Â£7500 per annum.
3 The port of call In New Zealand
shall be Wellington.
4. The steamers are to be of not less
than 3300 gross registered tonnage
and the time between Wellington and
Vancouver not to exceed twenty-one
days.
5. No bonus to be paid for early ar
rival; a penalty of Â£4 per hour to be
enforced when late delivery exceeds
forty-eight hours.
7. Passenger accommodation to be
of the best description and suitable
for the voyage through tropical lati
tudes.
9. The contractors provide suitable
accommodations for the purpose of
sorting mails on board; first-class
accommodations to be provided for
mail agents and assistant, without
charge.
10. The rates for passengers and
cargo**Â© be mutually agreed upon and
embdcted in the contract.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Jan. 3.â The Sen
atorial contest in the Ohio Legislature
has become desperate. The combine
of ten anti-Hanna Republicans with
the Democratic members won at the
caucuses last Saturday night and
again to-day in organizing both
branches of the Legislature in the in
terest of the "combine" opposition to
the re-election of Senator Marcus A.
Hanna,
There are two more dates for tests
of strengthâ the joint Senatorial cau
cuses next Wednesday night and the
joint balloting for Senator a week
from next Wednesday, January 12.
The complications of the legislative
organization and its patronage dis
posed of, the Hanna men to-night be
gan a most desperate fight on the Sen
atorship.
The Hanna men deny that they will
form a coalition with Brice for a gold
Democrat for Senator rather than be
beaten by a free-silver Republican, or
that they will do anything else but
fight it out if it takes all winter.
While they are not able to give a list
long enough to elect, they claim that
Hanna is stronger than Boxwell and
the other regular Republican candi-
CHARLES KURTZ, Who Is Leading the Fight Against Hanna.
dates In the organization of the Legis
lature, and that the opposition has
not enough votes to elect a Senator.
The Hanna men concede that they
have lost the power of the organiza
tion of both branches, can name no
chairman, place no members in desira
ble positions on any of the committees
or dispose of any other State patron
age, but they have carried the war
into the home counties of "the bolt
ing" Republican members and expect
the necessary changes before next
Wednesday night.
The developments of last Saturday
nlght and to-day have caused the
Hanna men to admit that they were
outdone in the preliminary organiza
tion for this contest, and that they
underestimated the opposition and es
pecially the extent of it since the No
vember election. While ex-Chairman
Kurtz was thought to have been or
ganizing against Senator Hanna ever
since the Republican State conven
tion at Toledo in June, yet the par
ticipation of Governor Bushnell and
others had not been fully anticipated.
The Democratic State headquarters
have been kept in operation by John
R. McLean and others ever since the
November election, ostensibly to pre
pare for a grand free silver carnival
here on Jackson day, January 8.
Iflt; now develops that f, the Demo
cratic State ; headquarters were kept
open to get ' all the Democratic mem
bers in line for what took place to-day
and for the defeat of Hanna. A Mean
time Mr. Kurtz was marshaling every
possible ; Republican â  tin ' line ,'â  * against
Hanna and communicating with the
committee on arrangements for Jack
son day. When ; this fact was no
longer, concealed to-night by the oppo
sitiori there were many si Republicans
openly complaining against * Senator
Hanna's managers. ] Â Senator Hanna
did .Â« not ; arrive ; here until â¢ lasti Friday
evtuiiiic saitl yiaM 1a " lAra^hiTlff r f' % ''> if"*"
the holiday recess. He heard com
plaints about his own absence and
about underestimating the organiza
tion of the opposition in a very good
natured manner, and insisted that he
.would yet win out.
The superior organization of the op
position was shown in the combine
securing to-day nearly all of the
doubtful votes. The opposition has
had an army of workers here for a
week, with detachments kept close to
each one of the doubtful Republicans.
The opposition marched to the State
house in lines like troops and worked
for weeks like soldiers under orders.
They had been doing picket duty,
skirmishing and walking guard lines,
and they had their triumphal march
in the most unusual manner because
of the confidence in their organiza
tion. The wives and daughters of the
managers of the combine secured
choice seats in advance in the legis
lative halls, awaiting the arrival of the
anti-Hanna hosts, and the most elabo
rate floral designs were on hand for
the occasion.
The feeling of the Republican mem
bers who voted for their caucus nomi
nees is openly expressed against Gov
ernor Bushnell more than against
Kurtz or other Republicans who com
bined with the Democrats. The State
Journal, the Republican organ of Cen-
tral Ohio, prints a large picture of the
Governor with heavy black borders.
Some Republican clubs have canceled
their engagement of quarters here for
the inauguration exercises next Mon
day, and many protests are being re
ceived at the State house. Colonel T.
W. Moore of Marietta, another ap
pointee of Governor Bushnell, to-day
resigned as trustee of the State In
sane Asylum at Athens.
The feeling of revenge was shown
even in the routine legislative proceed
ings. Representative Bramley of
Cleveland introduced a bill to repeal
the fifty-year franchise law for street
railways, in which Senator Hanna is
largely interested. Bramley is a con
tractor who had large contracts under
the municipal administration of Mayor
McKisson, and other members from
Cleveland who are supporting Hanna
are said to have measures ready for
charges and investigations at Cleve
land that would affect Bramley.
The Legislature convened at 10
a. m. Owing to the Senator
ship being at stake there was an un
usually large attendance about the
State House very early to-day. It re
quired an hour to examine the creden
tials and to swear in the 109 members
of the House, but the thirty-six Sen
ators soon qualified.
The Democratic organization of the
Senate was made complete in a very
quiet way, while a detachment of
policemen was needed to hold back the
crowd that filled the hall of the House
and pressed about its entrance.
In the hall of the House the wildest
scenes were witnessed during the first
hour of the session. All of the 109
members were in their seats. After the
name of Boxwell had been presented as
the regular Republican candidate for
Speaker, the name of Representative
Mason (R.) was presented by Repre
sentative Jones (R.) and seconded by
two other Republicans. (The Demo
crats did not participate in the speak
ing. As the ballot proceeded there
were loud cheers as the doubtful mem
bers responded to their names, and
when the roll-call approached the close,
and Mason secured the necessary ma
jority, there was a loud demonstration
that delayed the official announcement
of the vote.
The first ballot resulted as follows:
Mason, 56; Boxwell, 53â these being
the figures claimed since Saturday
night by the combined opposition to
Senator Hanna. The combine then
completed the organization of the
House.
When the House reassembled at 4
p. m., and just previous to the read
ing of Governor Bushnell's message,
several bills and resolutions were of
fered, two of them being aimed at
Senator Hanna, and both of these
measures being introduced by Repub
licans.
Both bodies adjourned until to-mor
row.
In the Senate the combine controlled
everything on- all votes, but no test
votes were taken in the House after
the organization was completed. The
feeling that had been engendered dur
ing the preliminary .conferences was
shown in all roll calls, and it is evi
dent that Senator Burke will not be
received with much cordiality on his
side of the House if he appears in his
seat to-morrow.

CASHED THE
CLAIMS OF
TEACHERS
School Director Braly
of Los Angeles
at Fault.
Head of a Bank Guilty of
Having Violated the
Law.
Discounted Warrants Issued by
Order of the Board of
Education.
PUNISHMENT IS SEVERE.
Offender Subject to a Fine of $1000
and Disqualified From Hold
ing Office.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 3.â Another
member of the Board of Education of
the city of Los Angeles has been found
to have gone wrong. This time it is a
gentleman who has heretofore stood
with the very best in social, financial
and religious circles. And in his fall
he may carry down with him one of
the best-known financial establish
ments of the city â the Southern Cali
fornia Savings Bank, of which institu
tion he is the president.
J. H. Braly. the individual in ques
tion, was elected as a member of the
Board of Education on the strength
of being one of the simon-pure candi
dates of the League for Better City
Government. The only other nominee
of the league elected a member of the
Board of Education was Charles Cas
sat Davis. It is this league that has
been directing the prosecution against
Walter L. Webb, who was acquitted
in the Superior Court of the charges
made against him of having received
'â blood-money" from employes of the
School Department.
The offense of which Braly has been
guilty, as proved by documentary evi
dence on file among the records of the
City Auditor, is punishable by impris
onment in the State Prison for not
more than five years, or by a fine of
not more than $1000, and forever dis
qualifies him from holding any office
in the State. Incidentally he involved
the bank of which he is the president
in a transaction that may cost that
institution its right to do a savings
bank business. The officers and direc
tors of the bank are: J. H. Braly,
president: Simon Maier. Vice-preei
dent; M. D. WOblwine, cashier; A. H.
Braly, secretary; J. M. Elliott, H. Jev
ne, C. W. Gates, Frank A. Gibson,
W. C. Patterson.
On October 26, 1597, Miss M. E.
O'Brien ol San Francisco put in a
bill against the School Department for
thirty Lintel) 's maps of California,
charging $226 therefor. This was as
signed on the same date to the South
ern California Savings Bank. On No
vember 8, 1&97. this claim was ap
proved by J. H. Braly and W. F. Poor
of the Finance Committee of the
Board of Education. Warrant No. V 2
.-221 was issued in settlement of this
claim, and it was paid on December 14.
On the back of the warrant is this In
dorsement: "Received payment, So.
Calif. Say. Bank, by A." 11. Braly,
Secy." A. H. Braly is a son of the
president of the bank. The Auditors
receipt is signed in the same manner.
As a member of the City Board of
Education. J. H. Braly violated sec
tion 923 of the Political Code, which
reads as follows:
The State Treasurer and Controller, the
several county, city or town officers of
this State, their deputies and clerks, are
prohibited from purchasing or selling; or
in any manner receiving to their own use
or benefit of any person or persons what
ever, any State, county or city warrants
script, orders, demands, claims or other
evidences of indebtedness against the
State or any county or city thereof, ex
cept evidences of indebtedness issued to
or held by them for services rendered as
such officer, deputy or clerk, and evi
dences of the funded indebtedness of such
State, city, town or corporation.
Section 71 of the Penal Code pre
scribes the penalty for a violation of
the foregoing law as follows:
Every officer or person prohibited by
the laws of this State from making or be
ing interested in contracts, or from be
coming a vendor or purchaser at sales or
from purchasing script, or other evi
dences of indebtedness, who violates any
of the provisions of such laws, is punish
able by a fine of not more than one thou
sand dollars, or by imprisonment Jn the
State prison not more than five years
and is forever disqualified from holding
any office in the State.
The Southern California Savings
Bank violated subdivision 6 of section
574 of the Civil Code in purchasing the
claim of Miss O'Brien. This is as
follows:
No corporation shall purchase, hold or
convey bonds, securities or evidences of
indebtedness, public or private, except
bonds of the Vnited States, of the State
of California, and of the counties, cities
or cities and counties, or towns of
the State of California, unless such
corporation has a capital stock or re
served fund paid in of not less than
three hundred thousand dollars.
The capital stock paid in of the
Southern California Bank is $50,000, bo
that it does not come within the ex
ception which includes only corpora
tions that have " a capital stock
or reserve fund paid in of not less
than three hundred thousand dollars."

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JAISTAEY. 4, 1898.
IN' connection with the charges
made aeainHt Director Webb
of the "Hoard of Education,
which he oiaims v:ere preferred
as the result of a conspiracy to
ruin him, Mr. Webb has given to
The Call the following signed
statement regarding the trouble:
The first trouble that arose in
connection with the School Board
occurred early In the history of
the present boardâ in fact, at the
time of its organization.
In the city election of 1896, a
new party or organization, call
ing itself the League for Batter
City Government, entered the
field, and either put up a ticket
of its own, or indorsed nominees
of other parties. Chailes Cassat
Davis and J. H. Braly were the
only members of the Board of
Education elected by the League
for Better City Government,
without the assistance of any of
the other political parties. There
were five other members elected
who had been indorsed by the
league.
When the board met in for
mal session to organize for the
year lt-97. they first came to
gether as a committee of the
whole. Immediately that this
Two Men "Who Figure in the Loj Angeles School Scandal
from which he resigned in the fall of
ISS3 to engage in banking and raisin
growing at Fresno. Since then he has
been actively engaged in banking and
has been a resident of this city for six
years.
Mr. Braly, In an interview to-day,
made an attempt to explain and ex
cuse the discounting of warrants by
saying it was done as a matter of ac
commodation to the original warrant
owners and not as a matter of busi
ness. In reference to the warrant of
Miss M. E. O'Brien of San Francisco
for $225. cashed Â»y the Southern Cali
fornia Savintrs Bank, Mr. Braly said:
Mi.^s ( )'Hri^n came to the bank while
I was there with a note from Secretary
Johnson. I am not sure if it was a
BOte. She may have -come on a sugges
tion from him that we could help her
out. After some talk with her, the
matter having been referred to me by
the cashieV, I decided to take her claim.
I did this only after I had a conversa
tion with Mr. Johnson over the tele
phone. He told me everything was all
right and I knew there was money in
the fund. Then I instructed the cash
ier to cash the warrant. It was done
simply as a matter of accommodation
to the lady. She was anxious to get
away from San Francisco, and there
was not to be a meeting of the board
for at least a week to come."
Mr. Braly stated that at different
time* the bank had been induced to
cash teachers' warrants each fall.
Asked why this was done in violation
of the law, he said:
"Occasionally it happens that they
are a little short in the fund from
which the teachers are paid, and the
teachers find It necessary to sash their
warrants. Occasionally one of our cus
tomers brings in a warrant and asks
us as a special favor to him to cash
it. Thoy usually, if not always, place
the money to their own account, leav
ing it to draw on. The bank has never
cashed one of those warrants except at
the solicitation of a teacher and as a
special accommodation, and. I think,
charp-'d U-pr than any other bank
would have done. It was not done as
a matter of business at all; only to
oblige one of our customers for a short
time. I don't think it would amount,
at any time, to JSOO in one fall. The
bank had done this before I became
a member of the Board of Education.
We made it a point to do it only when
wp had to do so to save our customers.
I told them at the bank to charge the
teachers as little as possible â just
enough to pay for the trouble of col
lecting."
DENY THAT THEY
ARE PERSECUTING
DIRECTOR WEBB.
Cheney and Cline Tell of
Their Attempts to Rein
state Miss Owen.
LOP ANCHLES, Jan. 3.â W. A.
Cheney, the attorney prosecuting the
case apainst Walter L. Webb before
the Board of Education, is a member
of the League for Better City Govern
ment and is one of the gentlemen who
interceded in behalf of Mac Owen to
have her reinstated. This is Mr.
Cheney's statement of his connection
with the affair:
'â¢I was retained by a committee from
the League for Better City Govern
ment. I cannot tell you who com
posed that committee. I am not at
liberty to do so. They are the regular
executive committee. I see no reason
for stating who they are. I don't know
as it would make any difference.
These gentlemen stated they had been
instructed to secure counsel, and came
to me to see if I would act in the
matter. This was the first I had heard
of it. I had no connection with it be
fore this. It was simply a matter of
business with me."
'Are you Mr. Cline's attorney or the
attorney for any corporation with
which he is ootUMOtadT" was asked.
"I have been the attorney for a num
ber of companies for many years,
among them the Los Angeles Light
ing Company," answered Mr. Cheney.
W. B. Cline is the president and gen
eral manager of this company.
"Are you not or have you not been
the attorney for Mr. Cline person
ally?" continued the representative of
The CaH.
"That I must refuse to state. It is
not my practice to state for whom "I
am counsel."
"Did you ever, singly or In company
with any other person or persons, go
to Mr. Webb to intercede for Miss Mac
Owen, in order to have her reinstated
as a teacher?"
"I went alone to the Board of Edu
cation itself. It may have been a
board meeting or a committee meeting.
I went in reference to the matter con
cerning Miss Owen."
"Did you ever see Mr. Webb alone on
this matter?"
"I never had a conversation with
Mr. Webb in my life, certainly not on
that matter. There were several pres
ent at the meeting referred to. I can't
tell you who were present. My recol
lection is that three or four members
were present. Mr. Webb was there."
"Did Mr. WÂ»>bb take any active part
in the discussion?"
My recollection is that he did. He
stated to me that Miss Owen h&d been
marked 'poor,' wh<*reas from members
of the board I had heard that she had
been marked fair." I went there to
lind out why they were going to re
move her and to try and induce them
to dc- her justice. She is not a friend,
I should say, but an acquaintance,
and not an old one. I went to the
meeting of my own volition as soon as
I heard of the situation. I had talked
with Mr. T. E. Gibbon about it, but
dent recollect if Mr. Cline spoke of it.
I can state emphatically that I am the
regularly retained attorney for the
League for Better City Government.
I don't represent any individual nor
have I been approached to represent
uny individual or ncheme."
W. B. Cline spoke freely of his con
nection with the affair.
"I have spoken to Mr. Webb but
once in my life." began Mr. Cline.
"That was in an open meeting of
the teachers' committee of the Board
of Education, when Mr. Webb. Mr.
Conn y and Mr. B&rtlett were present.
I appeared before that committee In
company with T. E. Gibbon and Louis
F. Vetter. We inquired why Miss
Mac Owen had been dropped from the
teachers' list and were informed that
it was on teccount of the low marking
she had received. We pleaded for her
reinstatement, but received no en-
couragement. So far as the school
board matter is concerned, with the
exception nf Mr. Mclnerney, whom I
have known for several years, I don't
know a member of the Board erf Edu
cation, and I have never spoken to
them of Miss Mac Owen's dismissal.
Mr. Mclnerney was the only one to
whom I spoke. I simply said I was
sorry to hear that she was to be
dropped.
â Neither Mr. Gibbon nor Mr. Che
ney is an attorney of mine. Mr. Gib
bon is the attorney for the Los An
geles Lighting Company and Mr. Che
ney is the attorney for the Los An
geles Electric Company, with both of
which companies I am connected. I
had never spcrken to either Mr. Gibbon
or Judge Cheney prior to their em
ployment in this case In reference to
it, nor have I spoken to any one else
in that connection. I knew nothing of
the Judge's employment until I read
of it in the newspapers.
"I have absolutely nothing to do
with the prosecution of Mr. Webb."
LEAGUE FORCES
GAIN A VICTORY
OVER MR. WEBB.
Charles C. Davis Elected Pres
ident of the Board of
Education.
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 3.â ln the elec
tion of Charles Cassat Davis as presi
dent of the City Board of Education
to-night, the League for Better City
Government won a decided victory over
the Webb forces. ThiÃ means a com
plete reorganization of all the commit
tees of the board and the relegation of
Webb and his friends to virtual obscur
ity, so far as the board is concerned.
Davis is one of the two members who
were elected to the board as the nomi
nees of the league alone.
The election of a new chairman of
the board was the special purpose for
which the meeting was called. All the
members were present with the ex
ception of Mclnerney. who has been
lonk-fl upon as a Webb man. His ab
st-me was viewed as an indication that
the "iron hand" of Webb had lost its
grip upon him. There was considerable
filibustering. Immediately the meeting
was called to order the Webb faction.
peeking to gain a postponement of the
election on the ground that a full
board wan not present, hoping evident
ly that the postponement would serve
to strengthen its cause. Bartlett moved
for an adjournment of the meeting un
til next Monday night. Conrey claimed
the motion was not in order, as a chair
man must be elected on the first Mon
day in January. The point of order
was declared to be well taken, and
Conrey moved to proceed with the elec
tion.
Webb argued for postponement, on
the ground that there was not a full
board present. Davis claimed there
was no good reason why Mclnerney
could not be present and claimed his
absence ought not to defer action.
Kubach, the newly elected member,
who takes the place of Adams, was in
favor of delay until to-morrow night,
and made a motion to that effect: but
after Braly spoke and called attention
to the fact that eight out of nine was
a pretty good attendance Kubach with
drew his motion.
The motion to proceed to the election
of a chairman was then carried by a
vote of 5 to 3, the noes being Bartlett,
Poor and Webb. Conrey nominated
Davis for chairman and Bartlett per
formed the same service for Poor. Both
nominees refrained from voting and
Davis was elected chairman by the
votes of Braly, Conrey, Kubach and
Mathls.
Before the meeting adjourned Davis
and Conrey introduced resolutions
which are for the purpose of Improving
the present system of letting contracts
for school supplies, providing for a
method of checking up such supplies
and for a better method of appointing
and promoting teachers.
WILLIS CLEARED
OF THE CHARGES
Los Angeles County's Assistant
District Attorney Not a
Boodler.
Serious Allegation That He "Squared '
a Murderer's Case Falls to
the Ground.
Special DiFpatoh to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 3.â The charges
made against Assistant District At
torney Frank R. Willis have entirely
fallen to the ground. It was alleged
that Willis had dismissed a murder
prosecution against Frank Phillips and
that he had been influenced to do so
from improper motives.
The matter came up before Superior
Judge Smith in Department 1 of the
Superior Court this morning. Deputy
District Attorney McComas asked
Judge Smith for permission to make a
statement. He then announced that
Mr. Willis had had absolutely nothing
to do with the prosecution of Phillips.
Mr. McComas said that he alone had
dismissed the murder charge against
him for the reason that the evidence
was not sufficient to secure a convic
tion. He defied any one to prove that
his action was the subject of Just
criticism.
Judge Smith then exonerated Mr.
Willis of the charges made against
him. Attorney Le Compte Davis, who
defended Phillips at the time his trial
was on, announced that his client was
in the courtroom and that if Judge
Smith thought anything improper had
been done in the matter Phillips wai
willing to waive all past proceedings
and again stand for trial as the pris
oner at the bar. Judge Smith declined
to accept the proffer and dismissed the
whole proceeding.
WAREHOUSES
ARE BURNED
Fire Destroys Two Big.i
Storage Buildings at
Stockton.
At Least Ten Thousand Tons
of Wheat Consumed by
the Flames.
Firemen Handicapped by the Corru
gated Iron Roofs of the
Doomed Structures.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, Jan. 4.â At 12:10 this
morning a fire was discovered in ware
house No. 5 of the Farmers' Union and
Milling Company, and before the de
partment'could respond the flames were
beyond possible control, despite the fact
that the warehouse district has much
better protection than it had a year
ago.
Warehouses 5 and 6 were quickly on
fire, and as they, both had corrugated
iron roofs the firemen were not able
to put a drop of water on the flames
until the roofs dropped, and then the
structures were gone.
As soon as it was seen that neither
warehouse coultl be saved the atten
tion of the department was turned to
saving the warehouse of the navigation
and improvement company, which was
separated from No. 6 only by a fire
wall, and the Eureka Crown Mills
warehouse, which had only the same
protection from No. 5.
Streams were withdrawn from the
central portion of the doomed struc
tures and set at work on the ends with
some effect, and by continuous fight
ing against the iron sides and roofs of
the burning buildings which helped to
shut them off the firemen were suc
cessful.
The warehouses were well filled
with grain, for both the Union and
its clients have been among those who
were waiting for the price of wheat
to advance. The lowest estimate on
the amount of wheat destroyed is
10,000 tons, and many puj it higher.
There was besides considerable bar
ley and rye. Much of the grain was
the property of the union, but by far
the largest proportion was held on
storage by the farmers of the Valley.
The loss is placed at more than
$500,000, though the territory covered
by the fire was not large. The loss on
the warehouses will be heavy, though
both of the buildings and the grain
were insured for a reasonable large
share of their value.
The fire started in the machinery of
a grader and cleaner which was located
near the western end of No. 5, and
which was kept running night and day.
Some part of the machinery is supposed
to have caught flrp. though when first
discovered by Night "Watchman Ken
yon it was almost beyond control.
The warehouses are built partly on a
pile foundation along the bank of the
channel. While the firemen were fight
ing the flames two other alarms were
turned in from other portions of the
city, but fortunately they amounted to
nothing. The steamer Ellen, with the
barge Cricket, was lying alongside No.
6, taking on a cargo, but was towed out
of danger by rowboats.
The fire continues to burn in the
great piles of wheat, which are in
places as high as the warehouses
themselves, and they will continue to
smolder for days. There has been
some slight damage in parts of the
other two warehouses by smoke.
GEORGE D. CROSSLEYS
APPEAL IS DENIED.
United States Supreme Court Affirms the
Rulings of a Loner Federal
Tribunal.
WASHINGTON*, Jan. 3â ln the Su
preme Court of the United States to
day the appeal of- George D. Crossley
from the decision of the Circuit Court
for the Northern District of California,
denying him a writ of habeas corpus,
was dismissed. Crossley was one of
the railroad rioters in California in the
summer of 1895, and was charged with
being responsible for the death of a
railroad engineer, caused by the derail
ing of a train. In the State court he
was found guilty and sentenced. It
was soupht to bring the case into the
t'nited States courts on the ground
that the derailed train was a mail
train, but the court held that there was
no statute under which the case could
have been tried in the United States
courts, and held that the application
for habeas corpus was properly denied
by the Circuit Court.

Suffering From Rheumatism of the Heart,
Accompanied by Other Com
plications.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 3.â Secretary
of State Brown is lying at his home,
818 L street, in a very serious condi

Full Fiat After Testimony
Is Heard.
CHICAGO, Jan. 3.â P.' W. Carman
of San Francisco, who was charged
by William Binns of this city and a
number of others with obtaining
money by false pretenses, was dis
charged by Justice Man in when the
case was called for trial to-day. The
charges against Carman fell flat, and
he was not called upon to introduce
any witnesses, the Judge discharging
him after hearing the statement of
the prosecution. Carman was charged
by Binns and the others with selling
them land in California that was
worthless. After discharging the de
fendant, the Judge announced that he
would hear no more of the cases, as
in his opinion there was no cause for
action.

A LETTER TO THE CRAFT.
San Francisco Building Trades' De
fense of the Commissioner
Answered.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 3.â The Sacra
mento Council of Federated Trades
to-night sent the following reply to
the Building Trades Council of San
Francisco :
Sacramento, Cal., Jan. 3, 1597.
To Officers and Members of Building
Trades Council, San Francisco, Cal.â
Brothers: Replying to your resolutions j
published in the Examiner of the 31st |
ult., \re will not answer in kind. Deem
ing abuse and vituperation at all times
very poor argument, we adhere strictly
to facts in presenting the following re
view and comments on your resolutions:
On December 6 the Sacramento Fed-
Crated Trades Council adopted resolu
tions setting forth the evils likely to fol
low the annexation of Hawaii. "We
handled the subject solely from a labor
standpoint, and in doing so did not
directly or indirectly allude to the
Building Trades Council or Labor Com
missioner Fitzgerald. Yet your first
whereas covertly insinuates that we re
flected on your past actions and also on
Mr. Ftizgerald. In the second whereas
you claim to know "from what source
this opposition emanates," dilating upon
"sugar trust," "a partisan feeling," "the
State printing scandal" and the "last
Legislature." You charge us with ac
tion at the behest of organs of the sugar
trust. This we emphatically deny, and
challenge you to prove the charge.
Your divergence from the truth grows
apace with further aspersions on our
motives, In retrospecting the last Legis
lature you claim to see "influences which
at that timo sought to relieve the State
treasury of unnecessary and unreason
able amounts," to "recompense political
obligations and take care of certain
branches of organized labor, have now
allied themselves with the mouthpieces
of the sugar trust in condemnation of
Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald and the
Building Trades Council."
The Sacramento Federated Trades
Council denies the imputation and
reiterates the above challenge. How
ever, we plead guilty to having at that
and subsequent times exerted our efforts
toward averting distress which menaced
organized labor. We failed; privation
and want sooYi overtook many wage
workers. Now every department of the
State government is more or less crip
pled for want of printing and about 150
union printers, pressmen and bookbind
ers are. HJe. Can It be that these deplor
able facts produce exultation in your
ranks? We accord you the benefit of the
doubt, brothers, and vanish the thought
â  Knowing that ail building trade unions
of San Francisco are not affiliated with
your organization, and that outside of
the metropolis you have no representa
tion, deeming yourself worthy and cap
able of expressing views as to the best
interests of labor is an absurdity. You
charge us with corruption because we
differ with you on annexation. Better ex
tend similar accusations to the American
J-ederation of Labor, whose numerical
strength runs high into six figures and
is on record as opposed to annexation,
Xjow tell us which central labor body in
the land besides the San Francisco Build
ing Trades Council favors annexation?
,â¢ As , to your hem "untainted with po
litical influence." also let us know if La
bor Commissioner Fitzgerald and Dep
uty Jam are or have been wage-earners
or politicians.
Then follows a sweeping condemnation
of labor organizations and the charge
that we ar "tending to destroy harmony
V- rt he ranks of labor." The Sacramento
lederated Trades Council has never
questioned your sincerity or impugned
your motives. Our organization honestly
aims to elevate workingmen. and in serv
â¢ ing toward that end is aloof from at
tions c Or ruln klndred organiza
<>ZÂ» UU + relterate former actions in refer
ence to annexation and believe that "it
LSL S Â°J^ lnter s of American labor to
have this territory." We. also wage
workers, entertain different views: nev
ertheless we respect your convictions
and do not condemn your action If
the annexation question can be definitely
settled by the voice of labor we ask you
to name a committee of three from your
organization to meet a like com.Aittee
from ours, debate before an impartial
jury and abide by its decision.
The last paragiaph of your resolutions
deprecates "the slur cast upon the action
of Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald." Mr
Fitzgerald is a public servant and his
field of duty is exclusively the State of
California, where he can be kept very
busy if attentive to his duties. While in
Washington he grossly misrepresented
us by claiming that all labor in California
favored annexation. At our meeting of
December 20 we denied the allegation
laconically repudiated the Labor Com
missioner's assertion, and Sacramento
Federated Trades Council stopped right
then and there. Surely there was no slur
in. that.
And now, brothers, having disposed of
. your resolutions in fraternal and friendly
spirit, we will briefly deal with Labor
Commissioner Fitzgerald's official career,
and possibly you will realize that he is
elongating nether limbs in your organiza
tion. The Commissioner first showed his r
disregard for organized labor in the ap
pointment of Cleve Dam as deputy. We
know not when or where Mr. Dam ever
labored, but possibly you can show up
the merit of the appointee.
The Commissioner, apparently anxious
. to ameliorate the unhappy lot of doÂ«vn
trodden labor, went .to Hawaii last
spring. Coincident with his return arose
the cry of annexation. We do not cht-rge
that his trip was in the interest of mo
nopolies; we do not say that his ex
penses were defrayed by annexatlonists.-
We do say, however,, that the smooth
bait imported from Hawaii by Labor
Commissioner Fitzgerald has not decoyed
laborers into slavery in the cane fields of
liawan. * -
In the published account, which also
â¢ contains Mr. Fitzgerald's report to your
organization, he is quoted as saying, in
speaking of his trip to Washington:
"I deny that I went under any sub
terfuge. I went as your accredited repre
sentative at your solicitation, and with
"a full appreciation of the honor you did
in asking me to act for you."
If going to Washington ostensibly to
advocate an eight-hour day, to secure
granite work on the Postofnce and to
help the Lodge immigration bill, and
â  there log-rolling for annexation and ut
â  tering misstatements thereon as to the
â¢ attitude of California labor, is not a sub
terfuge, pray, what is a subterfuge? We
Infer that your instructions to Mr. Fitz
gf-rald did not embody the annexation is
sue, and the absence of this subject in
his report strengthens our belief.
It is evident to any one who reads pub
â  lished accounts of your meeting that you
flid not defray Mr. Fitzgerald's expenses
to or from â¢ Washington. It is also cvi- 1
â¢ pent that, so far as carrying out your
instructionsâ namely, for the eight-hour
day, granite work and immigrationâ the
Labor Comynis.sioner or any one else
could have done as well without crossing,
the border of this State. He simply in
trusted his instructions to Senator White
Â»Â«*d Congressman Maaruire. As the Com
missioner's official actions are public
Sropcrty we have the right to ask who
ef rayed his expenses to Washington?
We do not question your right to praise
Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald, thouprh
such course be a misfit with your past
actions. Look back to proceedings of the
United Labor Convention, in existence
early last year. You were there, and so
were we. On motion of a bright dele
gate from the Building Trades Council
that convention recorded itself unalter
ably opposed to any reduction of wages.
We have not departed from that prin
ciple, and, therefore, cannot uphold La
bor Commissioner Fitzgerald, who has
reduced the wages of his minor subordi
nates. His salary of J250 a month, and
that of Deputy Dam, $150, remained in
tact; only the poor recipients of "com
pensation" felt the cut. Look you well
into this charge. Sacramento Federated
Trades Council, cognizant of the serious
ness thereof, stands ready to substantiate
Verily, brothers, your appellation to
Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald's doings
as "true to the cause of labor" is indeed
ludicrous and your rising vote of thanks
in compensation of his "services" a roar
ing farce.

PRISON OPENS
FOR ANARCHISTS
Pope, Addis and Isaac Found
Guilty of Misusing the
Mails.
Published and Distributed "The Fire
brand/ a Paper Containing In
decent Articles.
Special Dispatah to The Call.
PORTLAND, Or., Jan. 3.â The trial
of A. J. Pope, Henry E. Addis and
Abraham Isaacs, members of an an
archist gang and proprietors and pub
lishers of a small paper called the
Firebrand, for sending illegal litera
ture through the United States mail,
resulted in their conviction in the
United States District Court to-day
before Judge Bellinger and a jury.
An issue of the Firebrand in July
last was debarred from the mails by
United States Attorney Murphy as
unmailable, and Pope, who had pre
sented it at the Postoffice for mailing,
was arrested at the time, and war
rants were issued for Addis and
Isaacs. Addis was captured in the
hop fields, and Isaacs surrendered
himself a few days later. Pope and
Addis were in the County Jail for
some time, when Addis was released
on bail, but Pope declined to give bail,
and was finally released on his own
recognizance. After the Grand Jury
found a true bill against him he was
placed in jail again.
In his opening of the case United
States Attorney Hill claimed that ar
ticles published in the Firebrand of
certain dates, upon which the indict
ments were based, were indecent, las
civious and lewd, and not fit for even
adults to read.
These papers had been procured by
Postoffice Inspector Robinson, who
had written to the publishers of the
Firebrand for them under the name of
R. A. Williams, and inclosed 50 cents
to pay a year's subscription. The
papers were sent to him through the
mails, and also a postal card, written
by Addis, stating that the back num
bers asked for had been mailed, and
informing him that by calling at the
office he could .get others.
The jury was out ten minutes.
GENTLY REARED,
BUT A THIEF
Stockton Youth Arrested for
the Theft of a Purse in
a Restaurant.
Taken Into Custody After HÂ« Had
Squandered Much of the
Stolen Coin.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, Jan. 3.â Edward Mc-
Enemy, who comes of a well-known
family of this city, and who has held
responsible positions, was arrested late
this afternoon on a charge of grand
larceny. He is accused of having stolen
a purse containing $140. When he was
arrested $100 was found in his posses
sion.
McEnerny and a companion were in
an eating house this forenoon and were
seen to leave shortly after another
guest had departed. The latter re
turned soon, saying that he had lost
his purse. A search Â«7as made, but it
could not be found. McEnerny was
suspected and shadowed. He was seen
to make a show of money and spent
coin freely with his friends over bars.
He also went around paying various
small bills. As he had not been work
ing for some time, and appeared to be
in hard circumstances, his friends were
at a loss to know where he suddenly
came into possession of so much
money. The officers who had been
watching him placed him under arrest
before he had time to "blow" any more
of the coin.
Young McEnerny is a youth of a good
business education, and until recently
held a responsible position in a real
estate office, where he was a trusted
employe. Afterward he was an at
tache of the County Recorder's office,
but of late he has been out of em
ployment. Whisky got the better of
him and has left him a wreck. This
e'venlng the young man's father was
trying to get him out of the scrape.
BISMARCK'S CONDITION
GROWS SOMEWHAT WORSE.
Unfavorable Mews From Friedrichsruhe,
Although the Recent Alarming Rumors
Are Grossly Exaggerated.
LONDON, Jan. 3.â The Berlin corre
spondent of the Daily News says there
is unfavorable news from Friedrichs
ruhe, although the recent alarming
rumors were grossly exaggerated. The
rigorous way in which the __manor
house is closed to everybody facili
tates the circulation of unfounded re-

*the opinion that Bismarck's gout is
taking Its normal course and will soon
pass over. It must not be forgotten,
however, that his medical advisers are
doing their utmost to prevent any un
favorable report from reaching Bis
marck, who tak^H a very pessimistic
view of his condition.

Confinement.
From death In a shipwreck to death
by starvation and thirst in a steam
er's cold-storage room seems a stretch
Jacobson and Harry Christiansen
nearly met their doom from both such
causes, and that within the last three
weeks.
On December 10 the schooner Vesta,
was totally wrecked near the Car
manah light, and had it not been for
the heroism of. Mate George Geae
reaux every soul on board would have
perished. He carried a line through
the boiling surf to the shore, and by
means of it the shipwrecked sailors
reached a place of safety. The wounds
and bruises of Jacobson and Christian
sen received on that occasion can still
be seen on their bodies.
After reaching Seattle some of the
men came home overland, but the sail
ors in question stowed away on the
steamer Umatilla. They got in the
cold-storage chamber on December 30,
at 8:30 a. m., were sealed up at Port
Townsend and did not get out of their
prison until January 2, at 4:15 p. m.
They were then more dead than alive
and had to be carried on deck. Their
tongues were swollen and lacerated
from licking the sweat from the mast
in order to allay their thirst, and they
were so weak from hunger that they
could not stand. Chief Steward Curtis
saw to it that they got both food and
drink, and when the Umatilla docked
yesterday morning both the men were
able to go ashore.
"All that we suffered during our
lives did not compare with what we
had to endure during the past three
weeks," said Jacobson on board the
steamer yesterday. "The Vesta was
caught in the gale that wrecked ihe
steamer Cleveland and we had a ter
rible time of it. Our sails were blown
away, one of the masts went by the
board, the cabin and forecastle were
gutted, everything movable on deck
was washed away, and finally we were
driven ashore ten miles southeast of
Carmanah light. Waves were washing
over the boat continuously, and had it
not been for Mate Genereaux, who
swam ashore through the breakers, we
would all have been drowned. As it
was, Christiansen and I have been in
the hospital at Seattle.
â¢'From where we went ashore we
walked to the lighthouse, where our
clothes were dried and food given us.
From there we went to Neah Bay in
a rowboat, and from there to Port
Townsend, where we were paid off.
Christiansen and I then went to Seat
tle, where we were sent to the hos
pital. When we were discharged we
could not get a ship and no sailor
boarding-house would take us in, so
we resolved to stow away on the Uma
tilla. We got into the forepeak and
hid among the cargo, but on the way
to Port Townsend it got so cold that
we crept into a place where we were
protected from the wind. That was
the freezing chamber, and there were
a lot of trunks and valises ia, it. We.
went to sleep and were awakened by
the crew closing up the place in which
we were hiding. The baggage was be
ing sealed up by the Custom-house of
ficers in order to save searching when
the steamer got to San Francisco. But
we did not know that fact and went to
sleep again, intending to show our
selves on deck when the Umatiila had
left Victoria and was on her way to
sea.
"You can imagine our feelings when
we tried to get out of the chamber
and could not. Then we kicked and
yelled, but no one could hear us. and
for awhile we gave up. Then we got
hungry, but the hunger was soon swal
lowed up in the raging thirst.
"Whether I was cold or warm, hun
gry or full I know not. All I can re
member is that all-consuming thirst.
A certain amount of moisture gathered
on the iron mast, and that we licked
off every time it gathered. When it
would all be licked from our feet as
high as our heads we would pile up
the baggage until we reached the roof
ing, and then we would begin at the
bottom again. Finally, when the crew
of the steamer was getting ready for
the coming docking of the ship, we
made ourselves heard and the seals
were broken. We were taken on deck
and could barely gasp 'Water!' It was
given to us, and then in a little while
we got hungry. That meat they gave
us tasted better to me than anything I
ever ate in my life. We are all right
now, but I never want to go through
an experience like that again."
The cabin-boys on board the TTma
tilla say that they heard some strange
noises in the freezing chamber, but
did not pay any attention to them,
thinking that it was the baggage
moving with the motion of the ship.
Luckily the cold air was not turned
into the chamber, or the two men
would have been frozen to death.
Custom Was Not Honored.
Contrary to custom, the Judges of the
Superior Court did not hold a meeting
and elect a presiding Judge yesterday.
It has been the custom of the Judges to
selÂ«'ct a head on the first Monday of
each year, but for some reason yesterday
the custom was not honored by the mem
bers of the bench. It is thought that a
presiding Judge will !>â¢â¢ Mlectea to-day.
Wants a Divorce.
Matilda Thurber has commenced suit

As a cause of action the plaintiff alleges

STOWED AWAY IN A FREEZER.
Andrew Jacobson and Harry Christiansen, after a narrow escape in the
wreck of the schooner Vesta, stowed away on the steamer Umatilla. They
secreted themselves in the freezing chamber and were accidentally locked
in. For over sixty hours they were without food or water.
WHERE IS THE
HARRY MORSE?
The Good Ship Now Out
Twenty-Two Days
From Seattle.
Other Vessels That Left With
Her Have Arrived, and
Sailed Again.
Nothing Has Been Seen or Heard of
Her Since She Started for San
Francisco.
There is considerable speculation
among seafaring men as to the fate of
the American ship Harry Morse. She
is now out twenty-two days from Seat
tle and vessels that left the Sound the
same time as she did have arrived, dis
charged their cargoes and are on their
way up the coast again. Among those
which have got in were the Rufus E.
Wood, Spartan and Lucille. All of
these made good average trips, yet not
one of them spoke the Morse. The
barkentine Skagit. nineteen days from
Port Ludlow, and the schooner Okano
gan, sixteen days from Port Gamble,
both got in yesterday and neither re
ported the overdue ship. Both of these,
however, are lumber laden, while the
Morse has on board a cargo of coal.
The Harry Morse left San Francisco
on May 19 last. She went to Puget
Bound, whÂ»*re she loaded for Central
America. From Central America she
went back to the Sound and loaded for
San Francisco. She carries a crew of
sixteen all told. The chances are that
none of the sailors that left here on the
Morse are now with the ship, but the
following probably would be: J. N.
Lane, captain; H. M. Speyer, chief offi
cer; Thomas McDonald, second mate;
A. Johanson, carpenter; A. N. Winter,
cook, and K. Saiga, cabin boy. Since
the Morse sailed from Seattle a num
ber of heavy gales have prevailed on
the coast. Shipping men think that the
Morse may have been caught in one of
these and being partly disabled may
have been driven out of her course.
Captain Lane is well known in San
Francisco as a thorough seaman, and
his friends are of the opinion that the
vessel will finally reach port in safety.
The schooner Falcon arrived from
Tahiti early yesterday morning with
eleven of the crew of the Norwegian
bark Gyda on board. Some time ago
the bark was caught in a storm and
had to put into the Marquesas, almost
totally dismasted. She managed to
reach Papeete under a jury rig and
there, after several attempts to repair
her had failed, the French authorities
condemned her. Mate Gabrielson and
ten of the crew shipped for San Fran
cisco on the Falcon and Captain Jonas
sen has remained behind to dispose of
the cargo of cocoa that was on the
bark when she was wrecked.
Julius Homan, steward on the Sac
ramento River steamer Pride of the
River, attempted to take his own life
early yesterday morning. He had a
quarrel with his sweetheart, Mrs.
Mamie Hunt, who lives at 306 Pine
street, and from there he went to
Chinatown, where he purchased 25
cents' worth of opium. He swallowed
the drug and soon after was found
lying on the sidewalk on Jackson
street. He was discovered by a police
officer, who took him to the Harbor Re
ceiving Hospital, where Drs. Hill and
Zabala pumped him out. Yesterday
Homan was repentant and had come to
the conclusion that no woman was
worth his life. He says that the man
who won Mrs. Hunt away from him is
welcome to her. The steward was to
have gone out on the steamer on her
usual trip to Sacramento, but missed
the vessej and will have to wait for
the next trip.

REDDING SCHOOL
WAS IN DANGER
Fire Mysteriously Gains a Start
in the Outbuild
ings.
Employes af the Lurline Baths Turn
Out and Subdue the
Flames.
The Redding School on Pine street,
near Larkin, was saved from destruc
tion by fire last Sunday afternoon in
a cuHoub manner. The rear yard of
the school, containing the outhouses
used by the pupils, abuts on Austin
street, a small alley running from
Hyde street to Larkin, between Pine
and Bush. On the opposite side of this
thoroughfare are the Lurline Baths.
Early in the afternoon the er--Moyes
of the bathing establishmei.. saw
flames arising from the outbuildings,
and sending one of their number to the
nearest engine house to call for as
sistance, prepared to make battle with
the flames.
A heavy fire hose provided for the
protection cf the big bath house was
hastily dragged to the upper portion
of the building, and from a window
that commanded a view of the out
houses was turned a powerful stream
of water on the flames that threatened
to communicate with the school build
ing. Before an engine could respond
to the call the fire was out and word
was sent to the fire house to hold the
steamer.
The origin of the fire is a mystery,
but from the fact that a two weeks'
vacation was just closing, it is thought
that it must be of incendiary char
acter. The buildings were damaged to
the extent of several hundred dollars
and will have to be replaced.
FOR MORE THAN
THREE SCORE.
Jefferson G. James and
Administrator Freese
Jointly Celebrate.
In acordance with a custom that they
have observed for many years, Jeffer
son G. James and Public Administrator
A. C. Freese jointly celebrated their
birthday anniversary, last evening, at
the home of Mr. James, 2135 Howard
street.
Alternately Captain Freese and Mr.
James have presided at this delightful
celebration, and in the course of natur
al events Mr. James was the host last
evening.
Mr. James chose to celebrate Captain
Freese's three-score years and three
and his own three-score and seven
years by giving an elaborate dinner at
his elegant Mission* home.
Twenty-four guests were seated at
a long table that was dazzllngly beau
tiful with a decoration at once novel
and original. In the center of the table
was a huge ship, five feet long, fash
ioned of American Beauty roses, and
at either end of the board were im
mense sea-shells filled with the same
glowing blossoms.
The menu was fastened with the tri
color to tiny shells and the ices were
served in molds representing a tiny
ship, from the mast of which waved
a tiny American flag.
Seated at table were: Captain and
Mrs. A. C. Freese, Mr. and Mrs. A. W.
Wilson, Mr. and Mrs. W. D. Baggett,
Consul and Mrs. Simpson. Major and
Mrs. Cluff, Mr. and Mrs. George Cam

DARING CROOKS
IN THE TANKS
Arrest of Ex-Messenger
Boys for Robbing
Stores.
They Are Taken Before the
Night Watch and
Identified.
A BraeÂ© of Burglars Also Cap
tured by the
Police.
By the arrest of Joseph Grant and
William Hayes the police are con
vinced that they have caught the
"window" burglars who have been
operating in the Western Addition and
south of Market street.
During the past several weeks nu
merous complaints have been re
ceived at police headquarters concern
ing th 6 bold operations' of the burg
lars. Their plan was to approach a
store after it had been closed and,
placing a piece of fiy-pÂ£.per on the
window, break the glass. If the occu
pants failed to hear the noise they
would insert their hands in the aper
ture and get away with anything in
sight.
It is claimed that the prisoners have
"cracked" at least a dozen places, se
curing booty valued at several hun
dred dollars.
From a description given of the
burglars the police arrested Grant and
Hayes, both of whom are ex-messen
ber boys. They have been in the
tanks for several days, pending an in
vestigation.
Last night they were "shown up" to
the watch at the Central station for
the purpose of having them identified.
Several officers claimed that they had
seen them in the Western Addition,
and suspecting that they were crooks
searched them. Failing to find any
thing of an incriminating nature on
them they were allowed to go.
After the prisoners were identified
they were returned to the City Prison
and locked up in the tanks.
Captain Bohen is convinced that
Hayes and Grant are responsible for
the numerous burglaries of stores
committed in the Western Addition
and south of Market. Several years
ago they were in the employ of the
messenger service, but were dismissed
for certain irregularities.
Grant is well known to the police.
He was arrested several month? ago
for robbing a drunken man, but es
caped conviction through the refusal
of his victim to prosecute.
E'etectives Bee and Harper last
night arrested two young men named
Frank Thompson and Fred Allen and
locked them up in the tanks. They
were found in a Montgomery-street
pawnshop trjnng to dispose of a lot of
silverware, which is supposed to have
been stolen. Both men are Avell-known
crooks. Thompson, it is believed, is
one of the burglars who have been
operating in Oakland and Alameda.
They will be held pending further
investigation.
RANCHERS NEED RAIN.
Dairying Interests Damaged by
trje Long Drought.
Superintendent J. A. Fillmore of the
Southern Pacific Company returned
yesterday from Salinas, whither he went
on business connected with the road.
Mr. Fillmore stated that the farm
ers in that section were in a state of
fearful apprehension regarding the
long-continued drought, which has .al
ready wrought great damage to dairy
men. It is declared that if there be
no rain within a very few days much
livestock must be shipped to other
parts to save it, as pasturage is de
pended upon almost wholly for the
matter of feed, and the grass is al
ready completely withered.
So far as concerns grain, Mr. Fill
more says, there is no damage to re
port thus far, and rain within the next
ten or fifteen days will make that crop
safe beyond all peradventure.
(\ Broached Cargo.
Last Friday evening H. N. Saunders,
second mate of the Acapulco, was ar
rested by Deputy United States Marshal
Gallagher for an alleged broaching of the
cargo, three bottles of wine having been,
stolen from the hold.

THE DUTIFUL SERVANT'S REWARD.
' VERY housekeeper has at times pined over
the difficulty of getting proper servants.
â * More than one mistress of a home has ap
proached her kitchen with foreboding akin to fear
lest the queen of that department either bounce her
out or, indignant at the intrusion, bounce out her
self, leaving the sink full of dishes, the floor un
swept and a batch of bread scorching in the oven.
Now Maggie Doherty was not this sort of a ser
vant. She worked on a lonely ranch in the foot
hills. No clamor for more nights off was ever
heard from Maggie. With never a plaint she boiled
the potatoes, fried the bacon, washed the clothes,
and ever}' night retired with the consciousness of
work well done. What was the result? Maggie has
just fallen heir to $27,000. We not only hasten to
congratulate her. but to call to the attention of
servant girls generally the value of attending to the
duties of their responsible positions. When has any
servant who devoted her time to making life a bur
den to the heads of the house fallen heir to $27,000?
Never. We make the reply with confidence.
A LESSON FOR WAGE EARNERS.
BY reason of the great and rapidly growing
competition in the Southern States the cot
ton manufacturers of New England have been
forced to begin the present year by a sweeping re
duction in the rate of wages paid to their opera
tives. Only the stress of dire necessity has driven
them to take this step at the opening of a year
which promises in other industries to be so pros
perous, and the event affords to wage earners an
object lesson which even the dullest cannot mis
;<<ke.
Wages have been reduced among the industrious
and trained operatives of the great mills of New-
England because of the lower wages paid in the
South. The Southern wage earner works for low
wages in the cotton mills, and the Northern wage
earner must accept wages nearly as low or the mill
in which he works will cease to be profitable. It
is the old story of the ruinous effect of cheap labor
upon all high-priced labor with which it comes into
competition.
The cotton manufacturers of New England have
many advantages over those of the South. They
have larger plants, larger working capital, more
intelligent workingmen, better transportation facil
ities, more experience in business, more settled
habits of thrift and industry and a more compre
hensive knowledge of the markets to be supplied.
The Southern manufacturers have but one advan
tage, that of cheap labor, but it has proven suffi
cient to overcome all the others. Where there is
cheap labor the mill industry is rapidly extending,
but in New England either the mills are being closed
or wages are being reduced.
From the lesson taught by this experience of a
great industry exposed to a comparatively feeble
competition of cheap labor we can readily perceive
what would have happened to all the industries of
the nation had the free traders succeeded in their
efforts to enact a genuine free trade tariff and ex
posed them to the wholesale competition of the
cheap labor of the world. The r\iln would have
been overwhelming and almost universal.
The tariff issue is supposed to be out of politics
and it is to be hoped the supposition is well
founded. Our generation has had one experience
with free trade tariff tinkers and is hardly likely to
need another. Nevertheless the value of protection
to the wage earners of the country cannot be too
often repeated.
We have competition enough In this country
without inviting that of the world at large. We can
reasonably hope to raise the standard of Southern
wages to a point of equality with that of the North
ond thus in the end restore the possibility of good
wages in the cotton industry throughout the coun
try, but we cannot expect to accomplish so much
for all the cheap labor countries of the earth. High
wages and prosperity are the children of protec
tion, and we must maintain the mother if we would
have the offspring.
The San Diego doctor who has sued for $10,000
as a fee for having soothed the last days of a dying
man will strike the general observer as placing an
immodest estimate upon the value of his com
panionship. It is sweet of course to be escorted to
the gates of death by a physician, but at the figure
quoted the citizen of ordinary means will recognize
the stern necessity of going it alone, and though
perhaps tardily, will get there just the same.
Addressing the prisoners at San Quentin Sunday
an evangelist remarked that there are many worse

PORTUGUESE IN HAWAII
""T^HF.RE is more than one complication to fol
| low annexation of Hawaii, and the less the pros
pect of success of the scheme the less the dan
ger of what may follow.
There is a large Portuguese population in the
islands. They are refused the ballot by Mr. Dole's
oligarchy, and are, like the natives, as voiceless in
the affairs of that gentleman's "republic" as if they
were subjects of the Shah. But if Hawaii become
part of the United States these tropical Portuguese
will become citizens. If this did not follow the
change of sovereignty, as was the case when Loui
siana became ours, they cannot be refused citizen
ship if they apply for it, because we have a treaty
of expatriation with Portugal which gives them that
right. When they become citizens they will control
the islands. They are all natives of the Azores
Islands and carry a dash of Moorish blood, which
gives them endurance under tropical conditions of
climate.
In their native islands the humidity so multiplies
the heat that they are done to a turn for the enjoy
ment of a drier tropical climate. They stand Hawaii
well and their young reach a healthy maturity
there, which is not the rule with Anglo-Saxons.
If the islands are annexed what are we going to
do with these people? If they vote they will con
trol the politics of Hawaii. If we refuse them the
ballot what answer can we give Portugal in view
of our treaties with her?
It is the singular fate of annexation to bristle
with costly controversies and with that form of
foreign complications against which we were
warned by Washington and Jefferson. In view of
the proposed violation of our own constitution, the
despoiled birthright of the Hawaiians, the desertion
and reversal of our national policy and the confes
sion that our professions of respect for the rights
of war are a lie, if we take Hawaii off Dole's hands
and pay its debts, it is among the felicitations of
the new year that we have the assurance of Senator
Perkins that the annexation treaty is doomed and
the joint resolution is yoked with it in certain re
pudiation and defeat.
THE CIVIL SERVICE DEBATE.
f~* IVIL service is expected to be the first sub
l jeet the House of Representatives will take up
when it assembles for business this week.
According to arrangements made before the ad
journment for the holidays full time is to be given
for an elaborate discussion of the issue in all its
phases. The debate is certain to be lively and can
not fail to be instructive as well as interesting to
the public.
The demand for a change in regulations of the
civil service is not a party measure. It does not
come from a desire on the part of victorious Re
publicans to obtain the offices Grover Cleveland
bestowed on his cuckoos and mugwumps. Men of
all parties who have had experience in the practi
cal operation of the existing system have perceived
serious evils in it that must be remedied in order
to render the service thoroughly efficient. When
the vote is taken Democrats as well as Republicans
will be found voting on the side of amendment and
reform.
For some time past the affairs of the civil service
have been under investigation. Telegraphic reports
of evidence given before the investigating commit
tee have made known the fact that heads of depart
ments are dissatisfied with many features of the
present regulations, but the full extent of the de
fects complained of have not yet been made public.
That will be done during the coming debate. Re
ports from Washington announce that the oppo
nents of the system intend to cover the whole
question and will develop and exploit some very in
teresting facts.
In his message to Congress last December the
President clearly intimated that in his judgment
some change is necessary in the regulations under
which the civil service is now administered. While
giving a general commendation to the law, he said:
"Much of course still remains to be accomplished
before the system can be made reasonably perfect
for our needs. There are places now in the clas
sified service which ought to be exempt, and others
unclassified may be properly included." This
statement is in strict accord with the opinion of
men of experience in the service, and with that of
all citizens who have given the subject an intelli
gent and serious consideration.
It is, in fact, full time for the issue to be taken up
and revised in the light of experience with the ex
isting law. It would be folly to persist in main
taining a system found to be defective in operation
simply because it was originally enacted in the
name of reform. The administration of the civil
sen-ice is one of the most important parts of gov
ernment, ?nd common business sense dictates that
it be so e'ered as to be made, in the language of
the President, "reasonably perfect for our needs."'
Physicians governed by the sacred code of their
kind which forbids them to accept a remedy alleged
to cure consumption ought at least to spare the feel
ings of the people laboring under the pleasing de
lusion that the remedy possesses merit because of
having cured them. An ex-consumptive has at least
a right to feel kindly toward the method by which
he acquired the "ex."
An Australian girl is in disfavor for having
beaten a witch to death. A suspicion arises that the
witch was not genuine, and the method of the girl
was certainly crude. When our own ancestors used
to kill witches a few generations ago they were
careful to do it after trial in which prayer was a
prominent factor and in the full consciousness that
they were serving heaven.
There is much opposition to the plan of publish
ing a list of pensioners. No stronger argument could
be made in its favor. The country honors its
worthy pensioners and gives them freely the sums
to which they are entitled. It wants a chance to
dishonor the other kind.
Mayor Van Wyck is under the impression that
he has taken charge of the affairs of New York.
Yellow journalism thinks it has done this, while the
public has an idea that Dick Croker dictates the
policy and hands out the pie. Ultimately the mat
ter may be one for arbitration.
Announcement comes from England, as if some
thing new, that titles are purchasable there. In
America this has long been understood, the only
doubt being as to whether the titles are worth the
price asked.
Another football player has died at his post of
duty, a victim to a noble ambition to control the
destiny of a pig-skin sphere stuffed with wind.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1898.
THE effort of the Mission street boodler to get
another $30,000 "advertising" contract out of
the Southern Pacific Company by threatening
to advise the newly elected Board of Freeholders
to confiscate its streetcar lines in this city is quite
certain to prove futile. In the first place, the Leg
islature has control of franchises, having passed a
general law on the subject As charters must be
consistent with general laws, no such system of
confiscation as is proposed by the boodle sheet
could go into effect, even if the Freeholders were
reckless enough to follow its advice.
At present the State statute provides a uniform
rule for selling railroad franchises. Boards of Su
pervisors and Common Councils are required to
advertise for tenders and to award to the highest
bidder. Once a franchise is sold it becomes the
absolute property of the person or corporation pur
chasing it. The legal maxim, expressio unius est
cxclusio alterius, applies to this case. Where one
thing is expressed in a statute all other things are
excluded. So the courts have held that where a law
provides one method for doing a thing all other
methods are forbidden. Thus the law of 1893 es
tablishing a rule for the sale of railroad franchises
cannot be changed by the Freeholders, nor can any
rule for confiscating the property of the present
owners of those franchises be added to it.
Possibly, as the Mission street boodler says, the
Board of Freeholders elect will decline to accept
advice from anybody except itself. Possibly the
people on Monday week did declare \n favor of re
storing the boodler to the railroad payroll, and it is
possible, though hardly probable, that the Freehold
ers may consider it their duty to aid it in getting
another $30,000 "advertising" contract out of the
Southern Pacific Company. But in any event this
boodle sheet will have to discover some other
method of making the blood come than that which
it has selected.
Doubtless the railroad monopoly can be made to
sweat, but not with threats to confiscate its street
railway property. When the franchises now owned
by the corporation expire, unless the law be
changed, they will be sold to the highest bidders
for cash. As the railroad monopoly, by virtue of
its ownership of the roadbeds and rolling stock of
the lines, is in a better position than anybody else
to bid high, it will probably get all the franchises.
The difficulty with our boodle contemporary is
that in its attempts to extort "advertising" con
tracts from the corporations it plans without refer
ence to the law. What it should do is to study up
"cinches" that will scare somebody. This talk about
confiscating street railroad property Is childish- It
does not frighten the corporations because there is
nothing in it. In our opinion the Mission street
boodler will never get on the railroad monopoly's
payroll again until it originates a charter "cinch"
which will stand the test Even if the Freeholders,
which it claims to own, were disposed to help re
establish its contractual relations with the rail
road â which is extremely improbable â they could
not do so in any such way as this.
THE DEMAND FOR OLIVES.
A GRATIFYING feature of the news of yes
terday was the report from Pomona of or
ders received there for thousands of gallons
of pickled olives for Eastern cities, to be delivered
in the next few weeks. The orders are the more
encouraging because they give reason for believing
that at last the people of the East have learned to
appreciate the California olive and that hereafter the
demand will be an increasing one.
Nq class of orchardists have had a harder fight to
make a market for their produce than those en
gaged in the cultivation of the olive. The industry
has labored under many disadvantages. The
American people as a rule are not accustomed to
the use of olives. Those who use them have known
only the European brands. The oil, moreover, has
been exposed to the ruinous competition of a hun
dred forms of adulteration. In the face of these
obstacles the California growers have fought an
uphill contest for years, and the reward which now
seems to be coming to them has been amply mer
ited in every respect.
The industry is one in which California has a
most valuable interest. It is capable of an almost
unlimited expansion. There are thousands of acres
in the State on which the olive will flourish better
than any other tree. The fruit produced here is not
inferior to that of any other country. All that has
been needed to make the industry one of the fore
most in the State has been a wide and safe market
for the produce.
If the people of the United States ever come to
use olives on a scale to their use by trie
people of Europe we will have in our own country a
market capable of sustaining an immense olive in
terest in California. It is this fact that gives im
portance to the report from Pomona that wholesale
dealers in the East who a year ago had to be coaxed
to handle California olives at all are now unsolicited
sending in orders for barrels and hogsheads of
them. The big market is apparently opening up.
The man with olive trees in bearing has bright pros
pects ahead.
While the increased demand for pickled olives is
thus gratifying, it must be borne in mind that the
highest form of the olive industry is the making of
oil. The pickled olive is comparatively raw mate
rial. The oil is the finished form of the product.
It employs the most labor, engages the most skill
and ought to yield the largest profits. It will never
do so, however, so long as cotton seed oil is per
mitted to masquerade as "pure Lucca" oil anil finds
purchasers under that name. A rigid enforcement
of the law against the petty swindles of adulterated
foods is one of the urgent requirements of Ameri
can l'/e.
If the people of England wish to pay the debts
left by the Duchess of Teck that is their affair.
They amount to a trifle of thirty thousand pounds.
But it would seem to misguided persons who take
pride in not being paupers that the royal family
would hasten to relieve the public of new burden.
A woman who has been arrested for bigamy
makes the plea that one of her trips to the altar was
made when she was in a trance. If she can make
the plea impress the court and jury nobody can ob
ject, but the minister who performed the ceremony
ought to be required to make â¢ plea of some sort.
The burning of an American fiaÂ» by a lot of
drunken employes on board the liner St. Louis has
no great significance. It merely demonstrates that
they were very drunk indeed, which, considering the
season, is not remarkable.
If Spain were to take Weyler and clap him into
jail all this talk about her displeasure at the way he
is acting would lose its fairy tale aspect.
AN IGNORANT BOODLER
REORGANIZING THE PERSONNEL OF THE NAVY.
THE Board of Naval Officers ap
pointed by the Secretary of the Na
vy to devise some plan for the reor
ganization of the personnel of the
navy has concluded its labor and sub
mitted its report. The recommendations
are. as far as they go, radical enough,
and the fact that an additional annual
expense of $600.n00 goes with the proposed
reorganization plan is likely to defeat the
entire scheme. Briefly explained, the en
gineer corps will cease to exist as a sep
arate organization, and in the course of
a few years its functions will be per
formed by line officers. This plan dis
poses of the thirty-year flght between the
line and engineer corps, r>ut leaves sev
eral other corps troubles, still unsettled.

formed by paymasters could be done as
â well by the pay clerk, under the super
vision of a line officer. The proposition
is favored by the pay clerks, who look
for warrant rank and some definite
standing? in the navy, which they are
now denied.
The paymaster occupies a stateroom on
the port side in the wardroom. His daily
routine is to look after his pay clerk and
yeoman, to make requisitions for money
and stores, and to purchase the latter

under the orders of the commanding of
ficer. In the event of an engagement at
sea the paymaster assists the surgeon.
In the case of the abandonment of ship
the paymaster's duty is to see that the
safe is saved. These duties, the line of
ficers point out, are non-military in their
nature and could be d<jne with ea.se by a
line officer, who. In the event of trouble,
could take charge of a division and be of
some service.
In the coast survey vessels there are
no paymasters, the captain acting as
such, and in the old navy It sometimes
happened that the purser died and his
duties then devolved upon the captain. A

returned East after a three years' cruise,
and after seeing his ship dismantled and
laid up in ordinary the captain pot the
usual lea ve-of -absence orders and went
to his farm. In the course of a month
he received an official intimation that the
Fourth Auditor wished to get his finan
cial accounts of the cruise. Old S. re
plied that his accounts had been dub
rendered. The entire office force hunted
pigeon holes and lockers for the missing
accounts, but without success, so an
other letter of inquiry was sent to the
crusty captain-purser. His answer was
that he had sent his accounts in a
barrel ashore with other articles ad
dressed to the Navy Department. With
this Intimation of the whereabouts of
the missing accounts another search was
made from garret to cellar in the Navy
Department building, and stowed away
with casks containing curiosities gath
ered aboard was the barrelâ an ordinary
pork barrel â duly indorsed.
When opened it was found to contain
thousands of slips of paper, receipts for
various sums of money paid officers and
crew, and for stores of all descriptions
purchased at many places during thÂ»
long cruise. Only these and nothing
more constituted the old seadogs ac
counts, and it took several months for
the office force to unravel the business
and put It into tangible form, but wKen
the work was completed It was found to
tally exactly with the sums the captain
had drawn from time to time.
It was subsequently explained that
when the captain entered upon the duties
as purser he had two barrels placed in
his cabin, one at each end of his desk.
When any one was paid he took two re
ceipts, one of which he dropped in the
barrel on the starboard side, holding his
vouchers; the other receipt went into
the port barrel, which was I.ls account
with the Navy Department. This sys
tem of accounts, while it had the merit
of simplicity, did not meet with the ap
proval of the department, and no other
officer has ever followed it. On the con
trary, during the past ten years various
mixed boards, consisting of commodores,
lieutenants, marine corps lawyers, now
and then assisted by a paymaster, have
worked indefatigrably to devise a new
system of accounts for the navy, with
startling results. Only one paymaster
has survived the ordeal, after a two
years' sojourn in a sanitarium. The
commodores are dead or retired, the lieu
tenants are also retired, and the marine
corps lawyer has resigned and is now a
private citizen. Order seems at last to
have been restored, where once all was
char>s, and nothing is now more simple
than the navy accounts, provided always
that there is a competent clerk to do the
work, and supervision or the official sig
nature matters very little.

Life, through the arc of a century
Cronies two we have faced the road.
Cheek by jowl since the first jrouag day
When the primrose path before us slowed;
Mind you the wonders the vista showi-i ?
Cloth of *old where the sunlight lay-
Mind you the cowslip balls we stowed?
Glinting guerdons of Primrose Way.
Life, you're a faithful votary.
Years and a day to keep the code;
Tours was a rare knight-errantry.

warm that a Fahrenheit thermometer
would register them near the point of
ebullition.
By ways that are dark and tricks
that are cunningly vain, the three star
advertising men from the East are al
leged to have bunkoed the unsuspect
ing advertising public In the name of
the Bulletin and "against the peace
and dignity of the laws of the State,
against criminals made and provided."
The sugar-coated pill which the fic
kle and erratic grandmamma of jour
nalism prepared for those who had
expected better treatment was most
cunningly disguised. Three gentle
men who wore immaculate white
cravats and clothes of latest pattern,
rubbed their hands adroitly, spoke in
soft tones, and assured many mer
chants that they were writing "a his
tory of the industrial affairs in San
Francisco."
"We want a few items about your
business, if you please," said they. "If
><>v (are to* give a few dollars after
you see this, it will be all right, but
the advertisement we propose to give
will cost you nothing."
They rubbed their hands again, said
a soft good-by and vanished as if
they had been mere specters. A few
minutes later, one of them usually
appeared and induced the merchant to
sign an Innocent-looking certificate as
to the moral character of the Bulletin,
also announcing their willingness to
have a few good things said in its
columns concerning their business.
The next thing the merchants knew,
after the publication of many badly
written lines, was the presentation of
a bill for services rendered at the rate
of a dollar per line.
Many such firms as the Schmidt
Label Company, Hammersmith &
Field and the Goodyear Rubber
Company protested. A meeting was
called at the rooms of the Merchants'
Association on Friday afternoon and it
was decided by a score or more of rep
resentative business men, who had pre
viously signed protests against the
sand bagging operations, that they
would fight the unjust bills to the
courts of last resort.
The fueling against the methods in
troduced by the newspaper which
boasts of its honor is so great that
those who were bunkoed by its shell
game agents have refused to pay any
attention to urgent personal notes
from Editor Crothera, who has in sev
eral instances agreed to compromise
for a small proportion of the original
ridiculous claim. It is likely that there
will be another meeting at an early
day at which some of the best busi
ness men of the city will strongly con
demn the paper and the dishonest
methods of its irresponsible and lying
agents.

I wonder what Stuart Robson would
do for a whole season without having
the part of Bertie the Lamb in "The
Henrietta" to fall back on? I wonder still
it. and frozen smiles gave place to warm
glances and glacial well-bred approval to
enthusiastic applause. And the enthusi
asm did not die out. but increased with
each succeeding picture and story, until
the last act found the audience wildly
excited and obliged to bite the lips for
fear of breaking into the familiar pa
triotic songs.
Each picture in itself was a master
piece. The tone, the atmosphere of the
period was perfectly represented. After
each curtain one recovered with a utart
and came back to the commonplaces of
this young year of '98. Dramatically the
pageant was divided into three acts. The
first represented the picturesque as well
as the stern realities of colonial days.
In act two the period of the Revolution
was graphically pictured, ending with a
picture of dazzling splendor, "The Peace
Ball."
Ace three covered the Civil War and
Drought the pageant to a closo with an
inspiring picture of woma.i la the vari
ous positions she oomn:inlÂ» in the clus-
more what "The Henrietta" would do
without Mr. Robson? Robaon and Ber
tie have become the blood and bone of
each other. They have weathered many
a wintry season. They have grown old
together.
It seemed to me, In the Baldwin
Theater last night, that Mr. Robson
had the best of it in the race of years.
He was old, palpably old; yet, with
something akin to the simulative skill
that enables a young actor to suggest
a part of years, Mr. Robson, in the
limitations of his all but three score,
suggested the callow, irresponsible
youth of Bertie. It was a common
enough phase of character-acting â only
it was the common phrase Inverted; and
to me it was quite wonderful. Of
course the part belongs to Mr. Robson
by all the ties and traditions of the
stage, and if he is spared to be a
centenarian, I am sure that he will still
stick to Bertie and still find people who
will accept him as the punctual identi
ty of the part. But apart from super
stition and sentimentality, his acting of
it is still the best of eccentric charac
terization as well as a brilliant triumph
over Time. Even if "The Henrietta"
is a play ftar alwaysâ which it is not â
there need be no immediate anxiety
about finding the successor of Stuart
Robson. Age does not tarnish the
metallic charm of his voice, nor re
stiffen the engaging angularity of his
gestures, nor sog his gently comical
spirits â he was made in a peculiar
mold, and made to last.
Mr. Knhson and Mrs. Robson were
the heart of the fun last night; the
company did not play with the fine
agreement that was so notable last
week in "The Jueklins." In fact. I
should say that most of the members
of the company find the happiest vent
for their talents in a less urban type
of comedy than 'The Henrietta" pre
tends to be. At this o'clock Bronson
Howard's masterpiece is not only old,
but old fashioned. It abounds in the
lcng-lost Soliloquy, the significant
'Aside and many nth^r parts of play
that are modernly achaic rather than
anciently classical. And when a com
pany works these tricks of yesterday
for all they wore worth in that yester
day the result is not valuable. Na
ture has not changed much since the
inception of "The Henrietta," but art I
has, considerably; and instead of giv- j
ing a contemporary flavor to- the j
stock-ticker, the telephone and the
other metropolitan touches â social and
commercial â of the play, Mr. Robeon'l
company is inclined to make them out
to- be as obvious and cut and dried as
hackneyed melodrama.
As a play of modern interest "The
Henrietta" needs gilding and over
valuing on the part of its actors. Last
night neither Miss Gertrude Perry as
Lady Trelawney. nor Miss Lida *lc-
Millen as Mrs. Vanalstyne, nor Edwin !

Ingr nineteenth eenturv. With unusual
facility and remarkab!o grace the p?.i -
Uctpants lent themselv?s to the garb and
customs of those other days. The gay
social butterfly lengthened his debonair
face and assumed tho mien with the
garb of the stern Puritan fathers. Pretty
misses looked prettier and more bewitch
ing still in the kirtle and bodice of the
farly seventeenth century, and belles and
beaux alike were dazzllngly splendid in
the rustling: brocades, the costly face, the
glittering jewels' and powdered coiffures
that made th" "peace- ball" the most
elaborate picture of all. Among the pic
tures that found more than especial favor
was the picturesque reproduction of the
Colonial Home In the picture, "Washday
in Old Plymouth." Next in favor came
the Maypole dance by a band of merry
youngsters, and then the ever-popular
courtship of Miles Standish. In this pic
ture Miss Florence Schulz made a

that fell to her part with a charming and
delightful naiv. However, although
some attendants were brave enough to ex
press a preference no one was sutiu-ientiy
bold to declare that one picture was truer
in detail and artistic conception than an
other, and every one agreed that the en
tire affair was one grand continuous suc
cess.
The entertainment, for the benefit of
the same worthy vause, will be continued

AT THE ORPHEUM.
The present week at the Orpheum bids
fair to attract larger crowds than' the
theater can accommodate." The bill is
exceptionally good, with not a single
number that can be adversely criticized.
The old favorites have been retained and
the addition of live new numbers makes
a most pleasing bill. Fred P.rown. in his
rag-time dancing, .is a marvel, and the
audidnce would have made him go on un
til he was exhausted had it had its way
The acrobatic work of the Farnum broth
ers is new and is an evidence of skill
and cleverness that has seldom been seen
in this part of the country. Probably
the smoothest piece of work, and at the
Fame time the most pleasing on this
week's hill is the "Xew Year's Dream,"
by Patrice and her . company. She is
clever and is well supported by Alf
Hampton. . â  â

CHARLEY THORPE
IN GOOD FORM
Thrice Past the Wire
Astride of Winners
at Ingleside.
Spunwell Disabled With Vic
tory Looking Within
His Grasp.
The Roman Downed Horatio a Nose.
Cash Day Was in Fine
Fettle.
The sharp riding of Charley Thorpe
and the singularly fortunate win of
the warm favorite, The Roman, were
the features of the sport at Ingleside
yesterday. Thorpe was seen in the
saddle on five occasions, and his fol
lowers cashed on Dr. Sharp, Argentina
and Cash Day. The good colt Spun
veil struck himself, breaking a small
bone in his off fore Leg while galloping
out in front, and The Roman then
downed Horatio a nose in the hardest
sort of a drive. But for this unfore
seen accident good judges think the
unfortunate youngster would have
been returned the winner beyond a
doubt.
Three of the favorites were in
musty condition, hut three other
choices landed and the talent managed
to about pull out on the day's gamb
ling. Twenty-one bookmakers cut in
and most of them were squawkingabout
the light play. There was a sort of
off-day attendance.
The session was brightened up at
the start by the win of Veloz, a 6 to 1
shot, lie was one of twelve starters
In the opening seven-furlong run and
with Stevens up won in easy fashion
from Little Singer, third choice in the
betting. Ed Purser's Draught, played
from sixes down to 5 to 2 favoritism,
ran very disappointingly, finishing
yards behind the money.
Tom Griffins crack fllly Martha II
was the next disappointing feature.
Getting away none too well she fin
ished third in the five and a half fur
long dash that followed. Dr. Sharp,
the second choice, came like a cyclone
at the end, beating out Official in the
gallop. The latter was as good as 20
to 1 in the betting. Free Lady blew up
after showing a high turn of speed to
the scratch. The winner went to the
scratch a 5 to 2 second choice.
The Roman was an odds on choice
for the mile run, with a steady play
on Spunwell at threes, whioh forced his
price down to 13 to 5. The latter colt
went out in front, turning down the
back stretch with a commanding lead.
Suddenly he stopped as if struck with
a bullet, falling back to the rear. Then
in a long, hard drive from the head of
the stretch home Conley, on The
Roman, gut his mount past the wire a
nose before Horatio, astride which
"Willie Martin rode a superb race.
The mile and a half run proved only
a gallop for Argentina, the Baldwin
mare reducing the Ingleside record for
the distance to 2:55 1 2 . She was backed
from 8 to 5 down to 4 to f., and, leading
from the start, beat Personne out seven
lengths. Charlie Reiff was a close
third.
Old Cash Day came out looking like
a two-year-old, and in the fifth event,
a six-furlong sprint, took Tom flriffin',3
Rubicon into camp. Coins to the post
a 9 to 10 choice, he headed his com
pany from the jump, and though hard
pressed at the end, downed Rubicon
less than a length in 1 : 1 H s 4 .
The sixth, an added six-furlong
affair, was captured by Fashion Plate,
a 20 to 1 shot. Kamsin ruled favorite
around post time, with equally as much
coin going into the books on Stentor
and Mamie Scott at a shade higher
price in the betting. Olawson. on
Fashion Plate, trailed Mamie Scott to
the stretch, where he assumed the
front position, and at the wire led
Kamsin out by two lengths. Stentor
came from behind, finishing a close
third.

Conclusions Again.

MACDONOUGH AUCTION.
No Foundation for the Rumor
of the Sale Being "Padded."
In a recent issue of this paper there
appeared an article touching on some
of the many thoroughbred sales of
late in which appeared the statement
"that it was gossiped about that the
Macdonough sale was a padded one."
After a thorough investigation the
writer is free to admit that he was
misinformed on the subject and cheer
fully withdraws the assertion. The
item was simply given as track gos
sip and in all due respect to the firm
of Layng & Co., whose sales the past
month or so have been such pleasant
innovations in the horse market,
it must be said that an examina
tion of their books reveals the
fact that every sale of Macdonough
stock was a bonafide one. In the past
there has been much by-bidding at
sales, but those conducted by this new
firm in the field have been noticeably
free from this practice. This idle gos
sip floating about also seems an in
justice to Mr. Macdonough, whose ex
tensive purchases of high priced
horse flesh have done so much for the
breeding industry in this State. That
turfman is not interested to the ex
tent of one dollar in any of the young
sters disposed of at his sale.

TROD ON A CARTRIDGE.
Exciting Scerjc at Market arjd
Jones Streets â A Mystery
Explained.
A resounding report, a puff of smoke
and a whistling bullet caused much
excitement and for some time con
siderable mystery on Market street
yesterday afternoon.
A horse drawing a heavily loaded
express wagon was passing the Sterl
ing Furniture Company, opposite
Jones street, when there was a report
as of a pistol shot, the horses reared
and plunged and two ladies who were
walking along the sidewalk about ten
feet apart were seen to start as
though much frightened.
Investigation showed that the horse
had stepped on a 38-caliber pistol cart
ridge, exploding it and causing the
ball to pass between the two ladies.
The ball was afterward found im
bedded in the woodwork of an adjoin
ing building. It was at first thought
that the horse had been injured from
his frightened struggles, but it was
found that he was suffering from
nothing worse than a fright.
THE SAN FKAXCISCO CALL,, TUESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1898.
ESCAPADE OF A
BRIDGE -BUILDER
L. Leadbetter of Los An
geles Found by His
Wife.
He Left With Another Woman
Over Two Weeks Ago and
Came Here.
She Had to Threaten to Have Him
Arrested for Desertion Before He
Would Agree to Go Home.
For over an hour yesterday after
noon Mrs. L. Leadbetter of Los An
geles pleaded with her husband in
Judge Joachimson's court room to re
turn home with her, if not for her sake
for the sake of their children. She was
aided in her pleadings by the judge
and Assistant Prosecuting Attorney
Drury, but he was obdurate till they
threatened to have him arrested for de
sertion. Then he consented to return
with her by last evening's train, and
they left the court room together.
Leadbetter is a prominent bridge
builder in Los Angeles and has a wife
and six children, the eldest 16 years of
age and the youngest 4 years. He and
his wife have been married seventeen
years.
Saturday, December 18, Leadbetter
left Los Angeles, telling his wife that
he was going to Arizona to look after
some financial affairs. She had no
cause to think otherwise until about a
week ago when she learned that her
husband had been seen on the train be
tween Sacramento and this city with
a woman he was passing off as his
wife.
She satisfied herself of the truth of
! the report and came on to this city,
I putting herself in communication with
the police. No trace of Leadbetter or
, the woman could be found until yes
1 terday afternoon. He called at an of
1 flee on Main street and Mrs. Leadbet
ter followed him there. She begged
him to forsake the woman he had left
â  Los Angeles with and go home with
; her, and, rather than create a scene in
; the office by refusing, he said he would
and they went away together.
When they reached Market and
Montgomery streets Leadbetter told
her that he would not go home and
walked away from her. In her des
peration she called a policeman and
, asked him to arrest her husband, as
â he had deserted her. The officer took
; him to police headquarters, accompa
â  nied by Mrs. Leadbetter. After hear
ing her story she was advised to swear
I out a warrant for his arrest on the
j charge of desertion. They went to
Judge Joachimson's court, and, as al
ready stated, he finally agreed to re
â  turn home with her.
The woman in the case was around
the City Hall apparently expecting that
Leadbetter would return to her, but
she had to go away disappointed.
JUSTIFIED IN
KILLING O'ROURKE
Thomas H. Lindsay Completely
Exonerated by Judge
Campbell.
D. W. Doyle and Louis Seaman
Warned to Keep Away From
Lindsay's Saloon.
Thomas H. Lindsay, saloon keeper,
12 Ellis street, was fully exonerated
by Judge Campbell yesterday after
noon for the killing of James M.
O'Rourke, the racetrack tout.
Several witnesses to the shooting
were called, among them William
Berry, D. M. Saylor and others, and
they all testified that Lindsay shot in
self-defense and Bhowed wonderful
forbearance before being driven to
shoot. E. C. Wolf testified to having
seen O'Rourke and his gang about
two weeks before the shooting knock
a man down with a cobblestone and
the man lay unconscious on the street
for half an hour.
Prosecuting Attorney Spinetti then
moved that the defendant be dis
charged. He said that in shooting
O'Rourke the defendant violated
neither the laws of the land nor the
law of God.
Colonel Eddy, on behalf of the de-.
fendant also asked that he be com
pletely exonerated from all blame, as
it had been clearly shown that he
acted purely in self-defense. He also
asked the Judge to censure D. W.
Doyle and Louis Seaman, who had
been hanging around the defendant's
saloon and threatening to get even
with him yet.
Doyle and Seaman were called up
and the Judge, after expressing his
opinion that the defendant had com
mitted na crime under the law of the
land or the law of God, warned them
to keep away from the defendant's
place or they would find themselves in
jail.
Turning to the defendant the Judge
said: "Mr. Lindsay, the charge
against you is dismissed, as I consider
you were perfectly justified in shoot
ing to protect your own life." There
was applause in court which was
promptly suppressed and Lindsay was
warmly congratulated by his friends.

VOLUNTEERS
LOVE AND WED
Two Young Officers of
That Body Link
Their Fates.
Maude Ballington Booth Will
Be in This City in a
Few Weeks.
A Very Large Audience at the Meeting
Last Night at Metropolitan
Temple.
The grand reunion of the officers of
the Volunteers of America had a hap
py ending last night when Miss Harris
of Stockton linked her fate with that
of Captain Thomas of San Diego. The
ceremony took place at Metropoli
tan Temple before a very large audi
ence, and it was done with all the
simplicity that characterizes every
move of the Volunteers. The ceremony
was performed by Lieutenant Stur
geon.
There was also a baby baptized by-
Lieutenant Duru-an. The child was the
three-month-old daughter of Captain
Oxley of Santa Cruz, and was given
the name of Mary Jane with which to
go through life.
Both of these ceremonies were pre
ceded by songs and speeches, and
many prayers were said that bless
ings be extended to the newly married
couple and ihe little one just received
in the fold of Christ.
Lieutenant Sturgeon spuke a few
words to the assembly, but in those
few words he said more to make the
people cheer than anything else dur
ing the evening. He first told them
that Mrs. Maude Ballington Booth
was recovering and that in a couple
of weeks she would be in this city,
where she was coming to regain her
shattered health.
Lieutenant Duncan from Australia
addressed the assembly, and during
the course of his remarks stated that
he had visited many countries, and no
matter where he went he heard peo
ple say that the great cause of crime
was ignorance. This, he claims, is er
roneous, and he declares that, from
his observation, he has seen more
crimes committed by the most edu
cated men, and the more they were
educated the more heinous the crime.
The work done at the convicts'
home, called Hope Hall, was spoken
of, and it was shown that since Mrs.
Ballington Booth started it that there
had been more rescues made through
this means than any other known to
the workers.
GETTING READY TO RUSH
Maoy Parties Will Purchase Their
Outfit and Ship prom
This City.
The correspondence has greatly In
creased at the Alaska Trade Com
mittee's bureau, and maps and
printed matter are being called
for and sent out by the hun
dreds of pounds. Yesterday showed
the heaviest demand from the East for
printed matter since the bureau
opened, and the registration was like
wise heavy. The out-of-town people
who registered were all anxious for
news of the first steamer going.
Letters have been received contain
ing lists of names up to twenty-five
from one town of people who are ready
to start and want prices of outfits here,
which they say they understand can
be purchased cheaper than in any city
on the coast.
A member of Congress from Ohio
sends for information for a party of
five, who will come this way, in all
probability, and all along the route of
the car the letters are pouring in.

ROBBED OF HIS
NEW SILK HAT
Leon Stanton After the
Scalp of Police Officer
Harrison.
He Claims the Latter Did Not
Perform His
Duty.
Formal Charges Preferred Against
the Patrolman Last
Night.
Leon Stanton, a recent arrival from
San Diego, visited the office of the
Chief of Police last night and entered
a formal complaint against Police Offi
cer Harrison of the Southern Station,
charging him with neglect of duty.
Xew Years night Stanton claims he
was walking along Market street, and
when near Powell he was attacked by
several young men. who grabbed his
silk hat. Stanton chased the man who
had taken his hat, and as he refused
to return it. he struck the man over the
head with his cane, which he broke in
three pieces.
Just then Officer Harrison appeared
on the scene, and, after learning the
nature of the trouble from Stanton,
started after the alleged thief. After
a short chase he overhauled him and
took him back to where Stanton was
standing. The latter failed to identify
him, and he was at once released. As
a large crowd had gathered, Harrison
ordered Stanton to move on.
In his sworn statement, which was
made to Captain Healy in the Chief's
office last night, Stanton declared that
after the men had stolen his hat,
they robbed him of a purse contain
ing 550. He declared that Harrison
made no effort to arrest the robber,
and that he laughed at him when he
informed him that his purse had been
stolen.
The policeman says he knew noth
ing of the theft of the money until
Stanton incorporated the alleged rob
bery in his sworn statement to Captain
Healy.
Lulu Was Wayward.
A week ago the police were asked to
assist in the search for Lulu McNamara,
a young miss of 17 years. Last Friday
she returned to her home and acknowl
edged that she had been in company
with a man during her absence. The
parents appealed to the Eureka Society
for the Protection of Children, and yes
terday on the advice of Secretary Brown
the wayward girl was sent to the Cali
fornia Girls' Training Home, there to re
main until she knows how to behave her
self.

A gentleman of New York City, who had found Ripans Tabules
an excellent thing for dyspepsia, observed after using about fifty tab-
ules that they were in his case a great kidney and bladder washer. â  â¢
About two hours after taking one," said he, " I urinate so copiously
that lat one time almost became alarmed. Once it seemed as though
something thick like mucus was passing also and a slight pain or
stoppage was noticed." On consulting a physician this man learned"
that the fact that he passed an increased amount of urine while taking
the tabules was in no way detrimental, but rather beneficial, and that
the momentary stoppage was caused by a collection of the mucus
washed out of the bladder by the unusual flow of urine, and was a dc-
wrablc thing to have brought about.

Friend: In the twilight of old ag-e. with
the sound of the muffled oar dipping in
the offing, the surviving forty-niners of
New England shout their greetings over
land and extend to you and yours a warm
and affectionate handshake. Stranded
by infirmities, or unable to be;ir the
heavy expense, the stay at homes cannot
but rejoice with ymi and offer their con
gratulations for your manly efforts to
keep green the memories of departed
days. As the lineal descendants of the
Pilgrim Fathers date their origin back
to the founders of Massachuso tts, may
the offspring of the forty-niners date his
origin back with the same rlegree of
pride to the founders of the great State
of California with all of her future grand
possibilities. Believing the present jubi
lee offers to the scattered pioneer his
last and only chance to gratify a desire
that has existed for years, it is hoped
that many will attend this reunion and

A local firm has applied to the man

for distribution among their patrons.
Other firms, who are taking an inter
est in the coming fair, are also mak
ing similar applications, and Manager
Buckley is confident that at least
300,000 tickets will be distributed in
this way, thus Insuring the expenses
of the fair.
On Monday next an excursion agent
will start through the interior of the
State to arrange for large parties
from different localities on different
days to attend the fair. Reduced
rates will be secured from the various
railroad lines and this feature prom
ises to give the Interior an opportu

been fixed at $175.
Superintendent Benjamin of the
mining department has reported that
there is but one space left on the
ground floor for the exhibits from the

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUABY 4, 1898.
RUFFIANS USE
A BLACKJACK
Daring Attempt to Rob
and Murder an
Engineer.
Charles Paulson Felled to the
Ground by Two
Footpads.
His Cry of Murder Attracted the Atten
tion of â  Policeman and the
Men Flod.
A daring attempt to rob and murder
a man was made by two footpads at
an early hour yesterday morning on
Folsom street, between First and Fre
mont, and the police are using every
effort to arrest the two men.
Charles Paulson, an engineer, living
at 422 Fremont street, was on his way
home, and when about half way around
the block on Folsom street two men
accosted him, asking him the time.
Unsuspiciously, he pulled out his watch
and wu felU-d to the ground by a
blow on the head by a "blackjack."
He was for a moment stunned, and
when he regained his senses one of the
men was K"'n>? through hia pockets.
He yelled "murder" as loud as he
could, and was silenced with another
blow on the head.
Policeman Eastman fortunately heard
his cry and ran in that direction. The
two footpads, hearing Eastman's foot
steps coming in their direction, with a
parting kick, ran off and disappeared.
A young man hapened to be coming in
the direction in which they were run
ning, and as they paused under he
street lamo he \\aÂ« able to get a E J d
iook at them. He gave a description
of the men to Eastman, which may
lead to their captors.
Paulson refused to go to the Receiving
Hospital for treatment, and Eastman
took him home, where a physician was
summoned to attend to the wounds in
his skull. Eastman returned to the
scene of the attempted robbery and
found the "blackjack," which is now in
the possession of the police.
Paulson, In speaking of the affair
yesterday, said he thought surely that
if it had not been for the appearance of
the officer on the scene he would have
boen very severely injured if not mur
dered. He heard one of the footpads
say to the other, "If he attempts to
yell out again crack his skull."
Detectives Kyan and ODea were de
tailed on the case yesterday, and It is
expected that they will have the two
men in the City Prison very soon. The
two detectives have been very lucky
recently in runlng to earth footpads
who have been making a practice of
knocking down and robbing Inoffensive
citizens in the district south of Market
street.
PEOPLE CANNOT APPEAL.

immoral purposes, in violation of the
Supervisors' ordinance. Judge Camp
bell, who dismised the case, did so on
the ground that the law was uncon
stitutional.
To establish the legal status of the
ordinance, the case was appealed by
the prosecution, but Judge Cook, be-,
fore whom the appeal came, refused
to consider it. The people have no
right to an appeal, he says, for even if
he found the ordinance valid the pris
oner, once discharged, could not be re
arrested. He refused to establish any
such precedent as an appeal by the
people, and dismissed the appeal. He
says if the people want the ordinance
tested it must be presented to the
court in the proper form.

submitting a review of the Coal trade of San
Francisco and of the State for the year now

had the benefit of reasonably cheap fuel, and
it is satisfactory to note that trade require
ments have been fully maintained and com
pare favorably with thosi of past years, as
evidenced by the shipments of iv>al received
from the various sources of supply, British Co
lumbia contributing 418,600 tons and the coast
mines, exclusive of Mount Piablo. Pittsburgh
Colorado. 568.900 tons, against 437.100 tons
and 447,200 tons respectively last year; Great
Britain 141.60" tons. Australia 234.400 tons,
against 148,900 and 241.500 tons respectively last
year, which, together with the receipts of

THE LUMBER TRADE.
Pacific Coast Wood and Iron says of Lum
ber: "There has been a stiffening of prices
both in Pueet Sound Lumber and Redwood.
On the sound logs have advanced and vessels
are so scarce that unless a change comes there
will be a scarcity of Lumber in the market.
December 23 the Puget Sound Lumber ad
vanced $1. making merchantable rough com
mons .':.'.. lath $2 10, pickets $3 10. On the 24th
the Humboldt manufacturers raised $1 on
merchantable ami ?2 on "clear. MenJocino
County has as yet failed to agree upon any
price and may not. The orders that come in
are small and at present demands are light.
The demand for shingles during the past
month was light, but they are held firm at
$1 27VÂ±."
ADVANCE IN WINDOW GLASS.
A NVw York trade Journal says: "The
American Window Glass Company of Pitts
burg, Pa., which controls the output of the
window pins? plants of the country, will issue
a price list January 1 which will advance
prices in proportion to the Increase in wages
.-> workers. This means an
â  i" per cent over the prices
existing boforu the lockout began."
SHIPMENTS OF COTTON TO THE ORIENT.
The following local news comes from the
ntlle and Financial Times of New York:
"The exportation of raw Cotton from the
Southern States to Japan by way of Pacific
Coast pens is practically double what it wae
last season. According tn the figures of the
Southern Pacific there are at present in San
Francisco 15.000 bales of Cotton awaiting ship
ment to Japan."
EXPLANATION.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top fig
ures at station indicate maximum temperature
for the days; those underneath It, if any, the
amount of rainfall, of melted snow in inches
and hundredths during the past twelve hours.
Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
â¢ir pressure; isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The wind "high" means high
baromptic pressure and is usually accompanied
with fair weather; "low" refers to low pres
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure Is hich in the interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain is probable:
but when the "low" is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is im
probable. With a "high" in the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
in summer and colder weather in winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW TORK. Jan. 3.â The money market
failad to Â«how an easier tone to-day acd Jan
uary's boom In the price of stocks which somt
people had expected to begin failed tv arrive
on this, the first business day of the new year.
On the contrary, there was quite a flurry in
the money market before the day passed, and
the calling of loans precipitated something
very like a squeeze. The rate for call money
ran vii to C per cent and loans were placed
at that amount, though offerings were made
later at 2V& per cent. There was no actual
loan reported during the day, however. It is
difficult to say, however, how far lower rates
at the close may have been manipulative. Cer
tainly the stock market all day did not show
evidences- of a plentitude of funds available
for speculation. The exchange market hard
ened, the actual rate for exchanre rising to
$4 S4Vi. This was said to be due to an invest
ment demand based on a presumption of easier
rates tor money here in the near future, and
looking to the lending of money abroad.
A perceptible casing of money in London and
Berlin did not serve to interfere with this de
mand. The disbursement of January interest
by the Government and the further sums paid
out for the redemption of Pacific bonds were
expected to afTord relief to the money market
and to offset the payment of Â»8,5oo.0oÂ«'. which
is to be made on Wednesday by the Union Pa
cific syndicate to the Government, being the
final payment. Whatever additional sums were
released to the money market to-day, the large
operations pending seem to have made neces
sary the shitting of loans which resulted in
the afternoon stiffening of rates. Of the ordi
nary dlfebursements for dividends and interest,
it was not expected that a Urge proportion
would become immediately available tor the
money market. As bearing on the future of
the money market, it is important to bear in
mind that the Government has now on deposit
in New York banks upward of J38.000.000. It
is said by sub-treasury officials that the Gov
ernment is not likely to take up these de
posits for a reasonable time to come. But on
the other hand, it lies within the option of the
banks to surrender the deposits by taking up
the bonds which they have placed with the
Government as security.
Such a surrender of these deposits would
naturally tend to sustain the rates for money
in the market. The situation in the money
market kept the tone of stocks heavy and re
stricted the trading within narrow limits. The
heaviness was added to by the pessimistic
utterance by the president of the St. Paul as
to the unprofitable nature of competitive busi
ness at prevailing rates.
Foreign markets failed to reflect any appre
hension of the situation in the Far East.
Declines were general and reached a point
in other cases.
The bond market was dull, but prices held
firm. Total sales. $1.7*0.000. United States old
4s registered V, higher bid. and do coupon H
higher ex-dividend.

LONDON MARKETS.
NEW YORK. Jan 3â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram: Business in the
stock markets here has not yet been fully re
sumed, but the tone was distinctly cheerful
to-day, politics having no effect for the mo
ment. A feature was the sharp fall in gold
to 77s lid, due to the ripe in German exchange,
dividends and the prospects of a release of
Government dividends on Wedensday. Amer
icans opened firm, with other markets, but
gave way later and closed rather dull on real
izations.
The Standard's cable from its New York cor
respondent stating that the New York Times
was about to publish an article showing the
disastrous efforts of rate cutting partly pre
judiced the market. The undertone, however,
was good and hopeful and a rise is confidently
looked for.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Jan. B.â Wheat started easier and
at lower prices. May at 92c. which showed %c
decline since Friday. Liverpool showed Vjd
decline to begin with, and Northwest receipts
1 <ll<l not by any mean* suggest an immediate
| falling oft in volume. These were the features
in the early news which apparently created a
I desire to sell at the start and also extin
guished for the time being any inclination to'
j buy. In the first thirty minutes' trading May
declined to 91Vsc. Trading at the best was
rather slow. Chicago receipts were liberal.
About the only distinctly bullish item in the
day's statistical news was the clearances from
Atlantic ports, their amount being equal in
Wheat and Flour to 861,000 bushels. The an
nouncement of these figures injected a little
firmness Into the dropping out market, and
May, which In the meantime had dropped to
91c, reaching that figure about 12 o'clock, re
covered slowly to 91% c. It declined again to
91<Â»c, but in the last few minutes' trading re
acted again to 91VÂ»@91Sc. where it closed.
Corn was heavy at the start and became
still weaker an the session progressed, closing
practically at bottom prices, with a loss of He
I Oats were weak all day. May closing K@'*c
: lower.
Provisions were active, strong and higher
! The market closed strong. May Fork was 10c

DRIED FRUITS. RAISINS. NUTS. ETC.
The market Is qutet at the revised pricef.
New York mall advices report: â¢â California
Prunes are firmer, '< and' in some quarters a
bullish feeling is noted. Stocks are said to
be well cleaned up on the spot, and supplies
in the hands of jobbers and retail distributers
are believed to be small, consequently some
holders look for a large movement early in the
spring, with higher prices. The export de
mand for California Prunes, particularly from
Northern Europe, is reported to continue, ship
ments to the other side having been, it is
said, unusually large this year on account of
the scarcity and high cost of the French
Fruit. - Apricots are In demand for export, and
although the home trade Is moderate the feel-
Ing Is. . firm, good stock being reported rather
scarce. Peaches are scarce, but apart from
the occasional export . orders there seems to
be little doing." , r

SNOW FOR
CONTROLLER
A New Element Enters |
Into Alameda's
Fight.
The Man Most Interested Does
Not Appreciate the
Honor.
If the County Cannot Agree on a
Governor There May Be a
Compromise.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Jan. 3.
While Alameda County is witness
ing a struggle between two men for
the Republican nomination of Gov
ernor, emissaries from other camps are
working in the fold for the purpose of
making it impossible for this county
to get the coveted nomination.
During the past few days many
rumors have been circulated re
garding the proposition of taking up
another man for some other office on
the State ticket and thus minimising
the ultimate chance of success for
Â» â â :â  Ex-Mayor Davis or Dr. Pardee.
The latest plan, which has been
quietly introduced into the fight, is to
. take up City Auditor R. W. Snow for
the nomination for State Controller,
and thus reward Alameda County.
Mr. Snow was asked to-day how far
his personal knowledge of the new deal
went He replied: "Several months
ago the proposition was broached, but
1 took little stork in it. Recently, how
ever, considerable has been Bald about
the matter, and 1 have been spoken
to by a great many people. Person
ally I should feel inclined to throw
cold water on the scheme. Undoubt
edly this county deserves a big re
ward from the Republicans of the
State this year for her loyal work in
1896. The only reward compatible
with the occasion would be by giving
us the privilege of naming the head
of the ticket. At the present time the
two men who are striving for the hon
or show no signs of giving way to
each other, and it looks as though the
>st would go on till the primaries.
â¢â¢1 am more Interested in municipal
than in State government, although I
â¢will admit I have a few ideas regard
ing State administration that I would
like to Bee go into effect. I have no
â¢ al ambition at present outside of
this city, and I hope such a climax
will not be reached as to make it nee
r this county to accept any
than that of Governor/
Now that the holidays are over, pol
ns are at work. During the past
.two months there has been a good
deal of secretive work done, hut now
they are struggling in the open and
there will be no cessation till next No
â¢ vember.
In the Democratic camp, as usual,
there is schism, and already there are
.'.Lane and Magtiire camps in different
.parts of the county. The Populists do
seem to know just where they are,
'. dot having yet fully recovered from
â¢ the fatal fusion of the last general
':. campaign.
ANYTHING TO
OBTAIN FOOD
Svard Was Not a Burglar, but
â a Starving Man Out.
of Work.
Smashed a Residence Door So as to
Insure Having a Meal
in Jail.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
.:" 908 Broadway, Jan. 3.
Alexander Svard, a strong-looking
â¢ fellow of 30 years of age, destroyed the
.; glass panel in the front door of a Madi
son-street lence this morning be
â¢â¢ cause he was hungry.
â  Svard called at the residence of
: George R. Lukens and asked for relief.
A servant told him to go away, and
as soon as she shut the door he picked
. up a rock and hurled it through the
glass. Mr. Lukens and several,neigh
â¢ bors quickly arrested Svard, and al
though he showed no effort to resist
they bound him with balerope to await
. the police, and on the arrival of the
patrol-wagon Lukens explained that
they had captured a burglar.
. At the City Prison Svard robbed the
. incident of all sensation with his plain
i* story:
.â¢ â¢ "I have been in the r-ity several
â¢ weeks," he said, "and I have been un
; able to get anything to do. Last night
I thought the matter over and deter
mined to do something to get in jail
if I could not beg enough to appease
â¢: my â¢' hunger. I had been to sev
; eral places asking for breakfast,
when I made up my mind that if my
â¢! next request were not granted I would
' -do something desperate. When they
.refused me food at the Lukens house
I saw a rock and threw it through the
'Window. I am not going to beg for
.-. mercy from anybody. If you know how
â¢ It feels to be hungry and willing to
work and not able to get a breakfast
on a cold morning you can just im
.. agin'e how I felt. That is all there is
to it."
Svard will probably be charged with
malicious mischief, as it would be ab
surd' to talk of burglary under the
. circumstances.
EMERYVILLE HOTEL BURNED.
'.OAKLAND, Jan. 3.âThe Bruns
I Hotel, at the entrance of the race track
.-. ut Emeryville, was totally destroyed by
=flre at 2:30 o'clock this morning. Forty
-.lodgers escaped with little but. their
night clothes. The loss will exceed
" $2000. Help was asked for of the local
â fire department, and Chemical No. 2
â¢ and Engine No. 5 were sent to the
.: scene. A hard fight was made to con
Â°, fine the fire to the one building, which
proved successful, although for a time
It was doubtful if Burns & Water
house's stables could be saved. The
fire is supposed to have been of an
lnceridiary origin.
BOTH PARTIES SATISFIED.
OAKLAND, Jan. 3.â Judge Hall dis
missed all of the cases now pending
against William S. Watson to-day.
This was done on the films of a stipu
lHtinn whereby Mrs. Watson accepts
$2f> per month as alimony, instead of
$35, as was ordered by the court. On
this .showing the order was changed to
conform with the stipulation. This set
tles all of this family's difficulties,
which has been in court so long.
REMEDY FOR
MARE ISLAND
Secretary Roosevelt Is in
Favor of a New
Plan.
Result of the Inquiry Into the
Alleged Existing
Scandals.
Attorney Dnvis Discovers That thÂ«
Fault Is in the
System.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 3.
Attorney W. R. Davis, who appeared
for the veterans at the Mare Island
navy yard investigation, discovered, on
behalf of the veterans, a very faulty
principle that exists in the administra
tion of navy yards all over the coun
try.
He communicated his discovery,
, brought out by the details of the inves
tigation, to Secretary Roosevelt, and
[ to-day received a reply from that offi
! cial stating that the remedy offered
; was feasible and practicable. In his
letter Mr. Roosevelt says, "I am very
much interested in your letter. I have
been aware of the very difficulty which
you point out, and I am inclined to
think you have suggested the only
practicable way out of it."
During the investigation regarding
the partiality shown against veterans
at the yard, it was learned that the
naval officers in charge of the different
departments are not responsible for the
discrimination and abuse directed
toward veterans. These naval officers
are all from Annapolis, are said to be
gentlemen and thoroughly qualified for
their position. Owing to the many dut
ies they have to perform they cannot
give time to the details of their de
partment, and the actual work is under
the care of a foreman who is not
known to the Navy Department except
on paper. These foremen pass their
examinations at any of the proper
places In the country and are experts,
but they get their appointments at the
navy yard solely through influence and
correspondence, and when they go to
work they have a following that ex
perts to get work under them.
This system prevails to such an ex
tent that the officer in charge does not
know the record of the men who are
under him, and when an order comes
from Washington to discharge a cer
tain percentage of the working force,
these foremen recommend who shall be
let out.
There is said to be no remedy for
this except the appointment, by the
Secretary of the Navy, of a sub-officer,
who shall be of some standing and
come from the service in the navy, and
whose duty it shall be to fill in the gap
between the foremen and the officer in
charge of the department so that he
could impartially recommend who
should be dismissed and who retained.
This is the plan that has been sub
mitted to the Secretary of the Navy
and which Mr. Roosevelt says is the only
practicable solution of the difficulty yet
offered.
FOOTPADS WERE
MERELY JOKERS
Explanation of the Recent
Thrilling "Hold-Up" at
Berkeley.
How Two Youths Held Up Robert
Agee at the Point of a
Finger.
BERKELEY, Jan. 3.â The recent
mysterious "hold-up" of Robert Agee
on University avenue, which Marshal
Lloyd and his deputies have been
busily working to solve for two weeks
past, turns out to have been a practi
cal joke perpetrated upon young Ageo
by two Berkeley youths. Carlyle Coey
and William Lynch were identified this
morning as the "footpads,," but not
until after they had been arrested by
Marshal Lloyd and taken before the
District Attorney and vigorously ques
tioned were the details of the hoax
elicited.
Young. Agee, it seems, had boasted to
his companions that he would resist
bravely should a footpad attack him.
An hour later Coey and Lynch ac
costed him on a dark corner, pointed
their fingers at him and told him to
throw up his hands. Agee submitted,
and his captors relieved him of a poc
ket-knife. As soon as he was allowed
to go he gave the alarm at Berkeley
station, where he reported that two
footpads had leveled revolvers at him
and relieved him of $3 50 in monoy.
Subsequently Coey and Lynch
showed the victim of the hold-up the
knife they had taken from him, and
thus he first learned the identity of the
men who had robbed him. As the
joke was "on" him, however, Agee kept
quiet.
The two practical Jokers were al
lowed to go this morning, but there
is an old charge against Coey of resist
ing an officer, which toe District At
torney claims he will press unless Coey
goes to work within a week.
AFFIDAVITS ADMITTED.
OAKLAND, Jan. 3.â The order of
submission in the case of Given
against Morris was set aside to-day by
Judge UK'len, and several affidavits
introduced to prove thut Mr. Palman
teer had secured the signature of Mrs.
Given by misrepresentation. The suit
was originally begun on a complaint
to quiet title. In the answer the ex
istence of a note signed by husband
and wife was set up. which was a Hen
on the property. In the amended com
plaint this was admitted, but it was
alleged that the husband signed both
names, hence it was invalid, and it
was asked that her name be stricken
off. The defense now has a week in
which to answer these affidavits.
TO HAVE A GUARDIAN.
OAKLAND, Jan. 3.â Manuel Enos,
an aged man who owns about forty
acres in the heart of San Lear.dro. wai
examined before Judge Ellsworth to
day as to his competency. His oldest
son wanted his father declared in
competent, but Antonio did not like
the idea, although he admitted that
his father was feeble-minded. The old
gentleman has divided his property
between the boys, and the court asked
them to agree upon an outsider to
serve as euardian, which will be done.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TL'ESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1898.
IN COURT
AT LAST
Assessment of the Sev
enth-Street Local
Tracks.
Question of Twenty Years'
Standing to Be De
cided.
The Value of the Advice or Mr. More
house to Be Put to a
Test.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 3.
The Southern Pacific Railroad Com
pany will have to answer the suit of
the city to collect city taxes for the
fiscal year 1895-96 on the Seventh
street local system, the side tracks at
West Oakland and the long wharf.
The legal point involved in the asseas
| ment of the property as put forth
by the railroad company is: That the
property having been assessed as a
portion of the main line by the State
Board of Equalization it is not possi
ble to make the company pay a double
assessment. The company conse
quently declines to pay and instead of
selling the property for delinquent
taxes a civil suit was instituted to
have the powers of the State Board of
Equalization, County and City As
sessors passed upon in the court.
County Assessor H. P. Dalton
attempted to get the matter judicially
determined, but his actions were
nullified by the Board of Supervisors,
who, acting on the advice of State
Equalizer Morehouse, struck the
County Assessor's assessment from
the rolls.
City Assessor Snow kept the prop
erty upon the city rolls, and the Coun
cil, sitting as a Board of Equaliza
tion, sustained his judgment, and the
City Attorney was instructed to bring
suit to collect. The railroad company
filed a demurrer and asked permission
to strike out certain portions of the
complaint, but to-day Judge Ellsworth
overruled the demurrer and denied the
motion. The case will be set for trial
and a question which has been fought
in this city for twenty years will
thereby be determined.
SUSPICIONS OF
INCENDIARISM
A Peculiar Fire Breaks ' Out in
the Very Center of
Berkeley.
The Origin of the Blaze Traced to a
Pile of Kerosene-Soaked
Pmckjng.
BERKELEY. Jan. ?,.â A fire of very
suspicious origin did damage to the ex
tent of about $1000 this evening in the
building occupied by Greenhood's
candy store and George Schmidts real
estate office, on the northeast corner
of Center street and Stanford Way.
The building was owned by Mrs. Cath
erine M. Schmidt, and was fully in
sured.
The fire broke out shortly after 6
o'clock, and by the efficient work of
the local fire department, which has
been recently reorganized with James
Kenny as chief, the blaze was prevent
ed from spreading to the adjoining
buildings. A large part of the loss was
caused by water, which damaged
Greenhood's stock and fixtures.
The fire originated in a small closet
where the Berkeley Gazette Company
had stored its files. Marshal Lloyd
found in the closet a large quantity of
excelsior packing soaked with coal oil,
and also a half-emptied kerosene can.
No clew to the identity of the person
who placed them there could be found,
but the marshal and his deputies are
busy investigating suspicious circum
stances surrounding the origin of the
blaze.
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS.
Various Items of Public Interest
Gathered prom the Day's
Proceedings.
OAKLAND, Jan. 3.â The Board of
Supervisors this morning exercised
considerable discretionary power to
deny a liquor license even upon a valid
application in regular form, and re
fused to grant O. O. Fox of Elmhurst
a license. A large number of citizens
protested against the issuance of any
more licenses in their town, on the
ground that they had all that were
necessary already located.
The board was asked to care for Miss
Elizabeth Quinn, aged 60 years, whose
mother wandered away from home last
winter and died from a night's ex
posure. Miss Quinn is losing her
mind and is unable to care for herself
any longer. The hospital committee
will see that she is placed in the
Home for the Feeble-minded.
An ordinance revoking the appoint
ment of township health officers was
read and referred to the Judtciary
committee. In their places the District
Attorney said a county health officer
could be appointed at a salary not to
exceed $600 a year, but as no one
thought it necessary^ no action was
taken. x
T. M. Crawford and Charles Guard
were elected clerks in the County Re
corder's office to compare the mort
gage records and bring them up to
date for the use of the Assessor, at a
salary of JIOO a month each. It is
calculated that it will require two
months' labor to do the work.
BOYS' BRIGADE RALLY.
Listen to a Mao Who Helped to
Form the Very first
Compaoy.
OAKLAND. Jan. 3.â The board of
officers of the Second California Regi
ment United Boys' Brigade met this
afternoon at the residence of Lieuten
ant J. Hanley, Alameda, for an infor
mal discussion of the brigade work.
Douglas Hay, M. D., of San Fran
cisco, a man who has been closely con
nected with Professor Henry Drum
mond in England, came before the offi
cers and gave them the benefit of his
lonK exnerience in brigade work in
, England and Scotland. He declared
that the reason of the failure of the i
brigade on this coast was due to a lack
â >f spiritual work. "Too much military
1 and guns have been a main factor in ;
\ the abatement of church help," said
' Mr. Hay. Continuing he said: "I was
witli Major Smith and Professor Henry '
Drummond when the first company
j was organized in Great Britain. We
; commenced with a handful of boys and
i now the brigade numbers 763 compa
i nies, 2676 officers and 32,862 boys.
"Besides this we have a large num-
I ber in Australia and Canada, to 'say
i nothing of those in this country."
i Much enthusiasm was manifested and
j it was decided to hold a rousing meet
! ing in the neajr future, at which all
: pastors and official church men would
be urjjred to be present. The pfficers
; turned out in gnod style. Those pres- i
ent were: Lieutenant Colonel William â¢
M. de Wolf. Captain H. F. Hobson, Dr.
D. Hay, Captain L. N. Cobbledick, Cap
tain E. J. Walker, Lieutenants J. Han

OFF TO WASHINGTON.
OAKLAND. Jan. 3.â Senator George
C. Perkins will leave to-morrow even-
Ing for Washington, arriving there on
Sunday. On Monday, tnr> 10th, the jy.l
ciary committee will meet and, he says,
recommend the confirmation of Judgo
McKenna. It will be reported to the
Senate on Tuesday, and he believes
passed without trouble.
"Over 11,000 bills have been intro
duced this session," said ho this even
ing, "and several of the appropriation
bills, passed upon by the committee,
are now ready for the Senate. The
nomination of McKenna will he the
first important thing to come up, I
believe, on the opening of Congress.
It will be confirmed, and then comes
the Hawaiian treaty, which, they have
assured us, will be brought up soon
after the middle of the month."
MUST BE MODIFIED.
OAKLAND, Jan. 3.â The Republican
Anti-Civil- Service League has been
sending out letters to Congressmen
and is in receipt of several replies.
Among them is the following from
Hon. S. G. Hilborn:
The prospect of a modification of the
civil service rules and a relaxation of
their severity is most encouraging. The
greatest blow that civil service ever re
ceived was the sweeping rules of Presi
dent Cleveland. President McKinley
would have been .iustiiiÂ«M in setting it
asJde. and the country would have sus
tained him in doing so. Unless the Presi
dent modifies his last order the House
will pass a bill repealing all laws on the
subject of civil service. At any rate, it
seems so to me from the expressions I
hear.
LEAVES THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE.
OAKLAND, Jan. 3.â Deputy Sheriff
Will R White, the third son of Sheriff
C. B. White, has resigned his position
and formed n partnership with F. J.
Brearty. H>- recently passed the exam
ination successfully and was admitted
to practice law before the courts of this
State. The revocation of his appoint
ment as Deputy Sheriff was filed this
morning by the young man himself.
His position will not be filled.
â¢ ANNEXATION TEST SUIT.
OAKLAND, Jan. 3.â The trial of the
of Thomas Cuff against the Â«'ity
of Oakland has been set for February
11, by consent of both parties. This is
the .suit to u-st the legality of the re
tent annexation. The stipulation of
facts filed with the answer makes the
taking of any great amount of testi
mony unnecessary-
SIDEWALK OBSTRUCTION.
ALAMEDA, Jan. 3.â The sidewalk
abstraction ordinance will go into ef
fect in this city to-morrow. It pro
hibits absolutely any grocer or fruit
dealcr from exhibiting any fruit or
vtuf-tables in receptacles of any kind
on the sidewalk in front of their places
of business. The ordinance is severely
condemned by nearly all the dealers
affected. Some have their places of
business arranged with open or re-
I fronts in which they can make
suitable displays, but most of them
IK not so fortunate, and therefore
consider it a sreat hardship that such
an ordinance should be passed and en
forced.
THE DEATH ROLL.
ALAMEDA, Jan. 3.â Mrs. S. Paul
sen, mother-in-law of G." E. Clark of
2305 Clinton avenue, died to-day at the
age of 87 years. Death resulted from
ailments incidental to extreme old
age.
Mrs. Beeching. mother of Robert
Beeching, the attorney, died suddenly
this evening at the residence of her
son on Santa Clara avenue. She was
a widow and her husband was a pio
neer and at one time a prominent man
in this State. He held the position of
Prison Commissioner and other re
sponsible posts.
LET HIM GO.
ALAMEDA, Jan. 3.â This was the
day set for the sentence of Albert
Hlckox, alias Sutton. who was ar
rested for stealing bread from Ludwig
VWarnke's grocery some time nero. Jus
tice Morris read the young man (who
is of respectable parentage) a lecture
upon his offense, and then, out of
consideration for his previous good
character, suspended sentence.
WORK OF THE POLICE.
ALAMEDA, Jan. 3.â The police made
forty-four orrests during the month of
Decombtr. of which t iÂ«li' were for va
grant y. five for malicious mischief,
four for truancy and four for drunken
ness. Fifteen violators of municipal
ordinances were also arrested. Lodg
ings were furnished to eighteen per
sons and BM*M to sixty.
DAIRY REPORT.
ALAMEDA, Jan. 3.â The regular
monthly dairy report was tiled by the
Health Officer to-day. It shows a
favorable condition of dairies and a
high percentage of cream and butter
fats, in HIM BUM very high. All the
dairies but eight have complied with
the tuberculin ordinance.
- NOTES.
A. Johnson of 1908 Broadway was
bitten by a vicious dog this morning.
The animal was killed by the Pound
officers.
The semi-annual election of officers
of the Alameda Boating Club will be

at Stiles Hall next Saturday afternoon,
in aid of the hundred or more poor
children who are cared for by the so
< iety. The cantata will be rendered
principally by little children of Berke
ley, and a number of the most promi
nent ladies of the college town will
be the patronesses of the concert.
HOFFMAN'S
CHOST STALKS
Police and Coroner Lock
Horns Over Dow's
Death.
Significant Assertion Made by
Deceased to the Dalzell
Woman,
Dr. Gallagher Says Either Wound
Would Have Caused Uncon
sciousness â Time Fixed.
The police assert that John H. Dow,
proprietor of the shooting gallery at
816 Kearny street, committed suicide;
the Coroner and hie deputies, after a
thorough autopsy performed on the re
mains, swear by the Dog star that it
would have been an utter impossibil
ity for the man to have shot himself
even a second time after he received
the first wound. The antagonism be
tween the two theories is so similar
that the ghost of the Hoffman case
would surprise nobody by rising up
and extending its hands in welcome to
the disturbing elements.
Several important things have tran
spired since the murder or suicide that
lend interest to both theories. The
police are more confident than ever
that they are on the right track â ao
very much so, in fact, that one of the
most important witnesses, the Dalzell
woman, has been discharged from cus
tody as the result of her statements.
Witnesses have come to the fore and
definitely decided one thing at least,
and that is that the time of the shoot-
Ing was about 1:30 a. m., Saturday.
To take the police end first, Detec
tlce Crockett reported to Captain Bo
hen late last evening that he was con
vinced the case is one of suicide. The
Dalzell woman was brought forward to
make a statement, the result of which
was that she was discharged from cus
tody.
In the first place she asserted that
the dead man had been in the habit
of carrying the weapon with which
the deed was done around in his pock
ets for several months. The police re
gard this as very important, inas
much as it would tend to show that
the man who carried the revolver
would be likely to be the one that
used it.
"Last Friday," she said, "I took a
notion that I would like to celebrate
the New Year, and asked for a day
off. Dow told me to go ahead and cele
brate, but he wanted none of it in his
and said that he did not know if he
would ever celebrate anything again."
That ended the matter so far as the
Captain was concerned, and the
woman was honorably discharged
from custody, leaving the police in a
cheerful mood. But not so the Coro
ner branch of the local detective ser
vice. When it comes to them there is
a distinct hitch. They bank much on
the fact that Crockett discovered a
hitherto unknown door leading from
the back of the gallery into the yard
in the rear, and also on the result of
the autopsy to uphold their theory of
murder.
Dr. Gallagher performed the autopsy
on Dow's remains yesterday after
noon. He found three bullet w*ounds
in the right side of the head. One
was in the right temple and the other
two immediately behind and just
above the region of the right ear.
They all made separate perforations,
and all passed half way through
the brain. All the wounds showed
powder stains, and all were seared and
burnt.
"Any of them would have produced
death," asserted Dr. Gallagher, "'but
perhaps not instantly. One thing is
certain â any one of the wounds would
have produced instant unconscious
ness, and no man could have phot
himself the second time after receiving
the first. The man must have been
shot late Friday evening or early Sat
urday morning, as decomposition had
set in."
Three witnesses have now come for
ward and fixed the time of the shoot
ing definitely as about 1:30 a, m. Sat
urday. They are Fred Levers, pro
prietor of the saloon at 813 Kearny
street; W. P. Griffin, the barkeeper,
and Dick Seymour, a constant hanger
on at the saloon. Levers came over
to the Morgue last night and informed
Deputy Coroner O'Brien that he had
heard the shots at that hour and the
others had also. O'Brien went
over and interviewed the barkeeper,
who agreed with Levers. Seymour ran
across the way to the International
Holet to see if the shooting occurred
there. All describe the shots as hav
ing a much longer interval between
the first one and the last two than be
tween the last two.
J. W. Johnson, proprietor of the
shooting gallery, explodes the state
ments of Messrs. Childers and Little
by the statement that the door of the
Dow shooting gallery was closed and
Ho light within at 8:30 p. m. Saturday.
He went there with his wife to pay a
visit and discovered that fact. JoKn
son inclines to the murder theory, as
he says Dow was cheerful and told
him only last Wednesday that he in
tended to place a knife rack in the
gallery. He also says that the dead
man wore a gold ring now missing.
Coroner Hawkins impaneled a jury
yesterday to hold an inquest, the date
not yet being set, composed of the fol
lowing:
George Hinkel, 538 Market street; B.
Anthes, 528 Market; J. Lehman. 526
Market; O. Feudner. 416 Market;
James Goddard, 410 Market; C. Mont
gomery, 400. Market: F. Hammer. 212
Market; J. Stroufe, 208 Market; J. R.
Barricklo, 138 Market.
Considerable attention has been di
rected to an anonymous letter re
ceived by the Coroner yesterday. It
was evidently mispelled and otherwise
made crude in appearance for a pur
pose. It reads as follows:
Coroner. Confidential, if you are smart
you can find a klew. a short, stout man,
red hnlr. with very sha<ly reputation
an-i chum of the black-haired girl, was

City Council Requests Repre

Last Offer.
District Liquor License Ordinance
Passed to Print-Walker's
Bill Paid.
OAKLAND, Jan. 3.â The City Coun
cil took another bout at the park prop
osition to-night, but is no nearer a so
lution of this question than before it
met. An ordinance providing for the
selection of the Adams Point tract as
a park site was referred to the ordi
nance and Judiciary committee.
Councilman H. D. Rowe introduced a
resolution, which was adopted under
suspension of the rules, providing that
the representatives of the Adams estate
be requested to submit a written state
ment of the price per acre on their
lands, allowing the council to select the
portion it wanted bordering on Lake
Merritt, not less than twenty-five acres
to be taken; also that E. A. Bruguiere
be requested to do likewise on plot 25 of
the Sather tract, not less than 110 acres
to be taken.
Councilman Cuvellier first intro
duced his resolution as published in
The Call, which provided for the ap
pointment of a Park Commission of
eleven (one by each of the Council
men), whose duty it would be to select
and recommend to the Council a suit
able park site, for which the council
should call a bond election. He ex
plained his proposition after it had
been read and stated that his purpose
was to take it out of the hands of men
whom a certain morning newspaper
had attempted to intimidate by say
ing, "If you dare to favor the Sather
estate tract we will roast you, and your
political life will be ruined."
He further stated that Mr. Adams
had said he owned the Council. He
said Mr. Adams was present, as was
the person that had told him of Mr.
Adams' words. He wanted both sworn
and let them tell their stories under
oath. President Pringle said that such
procedure was out of order and he
would overrule the request. An appeal
from the chair resulted in it not being
sustained, and Mr. Adams was sworn.
He denied that he ever said anything
friat could in any way be construed to
mean that he thought he owned the
Council. He was then asked if he had
ever said he had one paper in his
pocket and the other in his hand. He
said "No."
Leroy G. Harvey was then sworn,
and testified that in July last he
talked with Mr. Adams, soliciting his
backing for the Sather estate tract.
"He expressed surprise," said Mr.
Harvey, 'that I had secured an op
tion on the tract. He then wanted to
know what influence I had with the
newspapers. I replied that I had none.
He said that he held the Tribune in
his pocket and the Enquirer in his
hand and owned the Council. There
was no one present at the time."
Mr. Adamsâ Did you know that
there was some one present in the
room all of the time, and that I would
not talk with you without some one
present?
Mr. Harvey â No, sir.
Councilman Brosnahan's ordinance,
providing for the districting of the
city into five districts, with graded
liquor license, was passed to print,
with the understanding that it was
for the enlightenment of the public
and did not bind the members to vote
i for it on final passage.
DISCORD IN THE POLICE DE
PARTMENT.
OAKLAND, Jan. 3.â Chief Lloyd cre
ated a sensation in the police station
to-night. He told Jailer Swain, who
has been on prison duty for twelve
years, that he would have to take a
street beat after to-nip:ht.
The Chief then turned on Captain
Fletcher and accused him of not show
ing due respect to his superior. Lloyd
said the captain did not salute him,
and Fletcher denied it, and said the
Chief never returned it. The trouble
is the result of the ill-feeling between
the great majority of Republicans on
the police force who do not care to
bend the knee to a rabid Populist who
has never lost an opportunity to air
his ideas.

HAMMOND
AND BANTEL
IN A FIGHT
Exciting Scenes in the
Board of Educa
tion Rooms.
Damages Amounted to a
Torn Cravat and Of
fended Dignity.
Other Directors Interfered and
Stopped Any Further
Hostilities.
BARRINGTON RE-ELECTED.
The Expected Upset Did. Not Occur.
Committees That Will Act
This Year.
An exchange of uncomplimentary
remarks between School Directors
Bantel and Hammond, previous to the
meeting of the Board of Education last
evening 1 , led to a personal encounter
that was as exciting as it was short.
Bantel has been accused by his con
freres on the board of not being willing
to assist his brother directors when
they wanted trifling favors for friends,
and this has led to some little un
pleasantness.
Hammond recently asked for the ap
pointment of a friend as a share of his
patronage in the department, and it is
said that Bantel opposed the appoint
ment. Hammond evidently believed
that such was the case, for when the
two met in the board rooms last even
ing he accused Bantel of being an ob
structionist. The latter made a hot re
ply and the fun began.
Hammond reached for his opponent
and succeeded in getting a hold on his
cravat. Writhing to escape from the
powerful grasp of his adversary, Ban
tel turned his back to Hammond, and
the latter promptly planted a resound
ing kick on the seat of Bantel's nether
garment.
The scrimmage might have gone to
still further heights had not other di
rectors interfered and stopped the pro
ceedings. They admonished the com
batants that such scenes would bring
odium on the board and succeeded in
calming the turbulent spirits.
As both directors attended a banquet
given during the evening by President
Barrington, it seemed as if the un
pleasantness had been smoothed over.
The meeting was called for the pur
pose of electing a president for the en
suing year and also for the purpose of
arranging the committees that will
serve for the same period.
Director Waller nominated Director
Barrington to succeed himself as presi
dent of the board, speaking of his past
services in a eulogistic manner. Direc
tor Head nominated Director Derham.
Director Barrington received ten votes,
Director Derham one, and Director
Carew one.
President Barrington read an address
in which he reviewed the work of the
past year, touching particularly on the
overcrowded condition of certain
schools on account of the inadequate
appropriation. The condition of cer
tain- school houses was also severely
commented on, the state of affairs be
ing attributed to lack of funds. Presi
dent Barrington spoke feelingly of the
uniform courtesy and efficiency of the
office force of the board, commenting
on the fact that complaints of incivil
ity and discourtesy had been unknown
during the year.
Director Waller stated the position of
vice-president was necessary in the
department, and moved that the posi
tion be created and Director Carew
elected to the place. Director Ham
mond nominated Director Head, who
rose to a point of order, to the effect
that as there was no provision in the
rules for a vice-president such action
could not be taken until the rules had
been amended. On the president de
claring the point of order well taken
Director Waller gave notice that at the
next meeting he would propose an
amendment to the rules to cover the
matter. The following committees were
then appointed and unanimously rati
fied.
Financeâ Gallagher. Waller, Burns
Elementaryâ Waller, Ragan, Burns, Ca
rc-w and Druckfr.
Suppliesâ Bantel, Gallagher and Ham
mond.
â  Evening Schoolsâ Ragan, Gallagher,
aller and Derham.
Printingâ Drucker and Ham
mond.
Building and Groundsâ Burns, Drucker
and Carew.
Health and Hygieneâ Derham, Waller
and Burns.
Secondary Eflucationâ Ragan, Waller.
Burns, Hammond and Armer.
Janitorsâ Gallagher. Waller and Burns
Judiciaryâ Hammond, Head and Armer
Qualificationsâ Armer, Hammond and
Bantel.
Rul<sâ Drucker, Armer and Burns
Salariesâ Waller. Ragan and Bantel
Visiting-Head. Gallagher and Derham
The anticipated turning down of Di
rector Bantel failed to materialize, the
most important change being the trad-
Ing of the chairmanships of the finance
and elementary committees between
Directors Waller and Gallagher.
After the session the board ad
journed to President Barrington's home
in a body and ate and drank his
health.
MINISTERS' MEETINGS.
Everythiog Was Quiet at the Re
ligious Gatherings After
the holidays.
Perhaps the most interesting session
of the ministers' meetings yesterday
was that of the Congregationalists.
Rev. Dr. McLean read a most interest-
Ing paper entitled "Sixteen days in a
pew after thirty-six years in a pulpit."
The reading was very interesting, be
ing a review of his experiences while
visiting the various churches in the
East. -â¢â¢
Dr. Pond was presented with JIOOO
by H. G. Noyes to be devoted to the
Chinese mission.
There was an election of officers at
the Presbyterian ministers' meeting,
those elected being as follows: Presi
dent. Duncan Monro; vice-president,
H. Bouvier; secretary and treasurer,
James Woodward; executive commit
tee, S. S. Palmer, chairman, E. G.
Mathena and E. E. Clark. It was also
"quiz" day, and among the quizzes
were "To what extent should minis
ters use their pulpits on the Sabbath
day for the discussion of civic mat
ters, and what are the benefits to be
grained for the kingdom of Christ?"
The second question was "How can
we best extend the work of the Pres
byterian Church within our midst?"
Both of these questions were discussed
at some length by the clergy present.
Revs. Farrand, Carson and Ed Jenks
were appointed a committee to further
evangelistic work in this city.
At the Baptists' meeting, Rev. Rob
ert TVhittaker, of the State Baptist
Mission, spoke on "The Brethren of
Our Lord or the Children of Mary."
There were reports also from the dif
ferent churches.
The ministers of the Christian
churches decided at their meeting that
all the pastors of the Christian
churches around the bay shall meet
once a month to confer on matters of
common and mutual interest. Steps
were taken for concerted missionary
work in this city.
Revs. Berry, Gardner and Ford were
placed in charge of the Morgan Tem
perance Saloon to help Mr. Morgan.
Th* j saloon is at 7, r >3 Markot street, and
will he run on a broader scale.
The ministers r,f the German
churches had an election of officers,
tho?e elected being: President. Rev.
F. Bomn; vice-president, H. Cordes;
secretary. W. C. Schmutzler; treasurer,
H. L. Dietz.
BY THE STRYCHNINE ROUTE
Peculiar Message Left by F- Nest
of Los Gatos, Who Corrjmitted
Suicide,
Fred F. Nest, a ranch hand from
Los Gatos, took his departure from the
world yesterday at the Baldwin House,
16 Ellis street, by the strychnine route.
He had lodged at the place since De
cember 22.
Shortly after 8 a. m. K. McKenzie,
the cjerk of the house, heard moans
issuing from Xest's room. He opened
the door and walked in, with a query
as to the cause of the trouble. Nest
confessed that he had taken poison.
He died soon afterward.
By the man's side was a small bottle,
labeled "strychnine." and clutched
tightly in his left hand was the follow
ing peculiar note, written in pencil:
"You can get a description of me in
yesterday's Examiner by Shirley Dare.
This is more than I can bear."
On the reverse side of the paper was
written:
"I ask forgiveness of all to whom I
have wronged."
This latter sentence concluded:
"Signed. F. Nest." Nest seemed to be
of a jovial disposition, and no reason
is known why he should have com
mitted the deed.
The article to which he referred was
entitled, "How to Have a Complexion
if You Would Be Beautiful," and the
Coroner is mystified as to why the sui
cide should have referred to it. There
is a belief that he committed the act
while temporarily insane. The body
was removed to the Morgue.
UNDERTAKERS
PERPLEXED
The Closing of the City Ceme
tery Affects a Close Con
tract.
The Chinese and the Indigent Dead
Are Left Without a Fixed Place
in Which to Real.
The ordinance passed by the Super
visors some months ago, closing the
City Cemetery against further inter
ments on and after the Ist of January,
3 898, has left out in the cold those un
dertakers who have had a monopoly
of the Chinese burials, as also the
Western Addition Funeral Directors,
who have the contract with the city
for the interment of the indigent dead.
In the former case the Chinese are
sorely perplexed in their situation.
They have no cemetery of their own,
and none of the others owning burial
grounds are willing to admit the Mon
golian corpse into their reservations.
The awkwardness of this position
dawned on the Mongolian mind yes
terday for the first time since the or
der went into effect, and to overcome
the situation Attorney Charles Nagle
made his appearance at the office of
the clerk of the Supervisors in the aft
ernoon and tried to impress on Mr.
Russell the fact that it was the duty
of the Board to provide a cemetery for
the interment of the Chinese since the
city had violated its implied contract
with his clients. Mr. Russell soon set
his mind at ease by reading the per
mission under which the Chinese, as
all others, were granted the privilege
of using the city's land for a burying
place.
As the situation now stands the Chi
nese must find a cemetery where they
can deposit their dead previous to
their removal to the Land of the Ris
ing Sun.
The case of the Western Addition
Funeral Directors, who have the con
tract with the city for the burying of
the indigent dead, is in a much worse
position, as the funeral firm has a con
tract which will not expire until next
July. At the time the contract was
let undertakers had the privilege of in
terring the indigent dead in the City
Cemetery without any expense other
than that of paying a man for opening
and closing the graves. As a conse
quence the undertakers bid against
each other until the price was re
duced to $4 for each body turned over
to the contractor from the city's pub
lic institutions.
Now that the City Cemetery is de
clared closed the firm having the con
tract finds itself in a financial dilem
ma. The sum of $4 will not go far in
covering the expense of burying a man
when the price of a grave has to be
provided, and yet there is no help for
the undertakers who put their bids in
so low as to freeze all others out.
The contractors are bound by a bond
of $6000, with Dr. Henry Gibbons Jr
and Dr. E. E. Hill, both of whom have
justified in the amount named.
It was stated that it was the inten
tion of this undertaking firm to pur
chase a tract of land in San Mateo and
set up a cemetery of its own in which
the Chinese and the indigent dead may
be buried.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL,, TUESDAY, JAXTJARY 4, 1898.
POLICE PUT
ON PENSIONS
The Reason Given Is
Old Age and Physi
cal Disability.
Three Sergeants and Four
Patrolmen in Re
tirement
Much Specula* >n in tha Department
as to Who Will Be Promoted
From the Hanks.
As predicted in The Call a few days
ago the Police Pension Commissioners,
at their quarterly meeting yesterday,
retired three sergeants and four patrol
men owing to physical disability or ad
vanced age.
The sergeants were Cornelius Martin,
Michael Fitzgerald and A. J. Houghtal
ing, and the patrolmen Michael A. Lof
tus, Michael Murphy, George A. Ander
son and Thomas McNulty.
Sergeant Martin was born in 1827,
and joined the force August 1, 1865. He
has been for a number of years hack
inspector, and made a host of friends.
Sergeant Fitzgerald was born in 1837,
and joined the force April 1, 1868. He
has been recently stationed on the
water front. Sergeant Houghtaling
was born in 1831 and joined the force
July 19, 1870. He has been for a num
ber of years in charge of the warrant
department and was, perhaps, one of
the best known and best liked men in
the department. The records of the
four policemen are: Loftusâ born 1836.
joined the force May 1, 1870. Murphy
born 1833, joined the force August 30,
1870. Andersonâ born 1836, joined the
force November 30, 1877. McNulty â
born 1842, joined the force May 22, 1878.
Anderson has been incapacitated from
duty for some years, and McNulty,
through a blow on the head some time
ago which affected his brain, has been
almost blind.
The retirements take place imme
diately. Previous to the passing of an
act at the last Legislature the Police
Commissioners had first of all, as was
done in the case of Captains Stone,
Short, Douglass and oth^r officers, to
request them to send in their resigna
tions because they could not be put
on the pension list until they had
ceased from active duty. By the recent
act the Pension Commissioners have
the power to make the retirements, to
take effect at once.
There is considerable speculation in
the department as to who will be
selected to flu the vacancies for ser
geants. It is conceded that Owen Gor
man, who has been for some years As
sistant Hack Inspector, will succeed
Sergeant Martin, but as to the other
two a number of names are mentioned,
any one of whom through merit is
justly entitled to the position.
It is expected that the vacancies
Will be filled at the meeting of the Po
lice Commissioners Wednesday night,
and that the vacancy in the detective
department caused by the promotion
of Captain Bohen last April will also
be filled.
Corporal Ayers. who has been doing
station duty at California street, was
notified last night to take Sergeant
Houghtaling's place as warrant offi
cer, and he will in all probability get
his promotion as sergeant Wednesday
night. He is an able and courteous
officer and richly deserves to be pro
moted.
TWO PETERS
MAY ENGAGE
Big Heavy-Weights Are Ar
ranging for a Champion
ship Contest.
Jackson Will Leave To-Day for His
Training Stationâ Maher's
Condition.
Peter Jackson will be the next heavy
weight who will meet Peter Maher, the
Irish champion, in the ring.
In a quiet way correspondence has
been carried on between the managers
of the champion colored heavy weight
of England and the Australias and the
Irish champion, and articles have been
signed by Jackson for a twenty round
contest and forwarded to Maher for his
The contest will be held in this city
if a permit can be had, but in case
"the powers that be" should refuse
permission for a bout of this kind the
event will be pulled off at New Or
leans. Jackson is now satisfied that
Maher means business, and feeling
that he needs several weeks of careful
training to condition himself properly
for a contest of this nature, he will to
day leave for Joe Dieve's training
quarters on the San Leandro road, at
which place he will remain until
called upon to give an account of him
self.
Tom Sharkey has an idea that a bird
in the hand is worth two in the bush
and will now remain in Vallejo until
the National Club can assure him a
promise that his prospective match
with Jeffries some time in the iatter
part of this month can be pulled off
with the sanction of the authorities.
Billy Delaney. who is looking out for
Jeffries' interests, is perfectly satisfied
to wait a few weeks, as he has every
reason to believe that the Health and
Police committees of the Board of Su
pervisors will grant the National Club
permission to hold the contest In this
city. There are thousands of people
here who are anxious to see a bout
between Jeffries and Sharkey, and they
would welcome the news of a permit
being granted to the National Club.
Billy Elmer has departed on the
State of California for Portland, where
he is booked to fight Dick Case on Jan
uary 17 before the Olympic Club of
Portland. The boxers will meet in a
fifteen round contest for the light
weight championship of the Northwest.
Elmer says that he is very sanguine of
winning.
Socialists In the Western Addition.
A series of meetings to be held by
the Socialist Labor Party will be
opened to-night in Franklin Hall, Fill
more street, between Sutter and Bush.
The meetings will be conducted for the
propagation of the principles of Social
ism, and the opening address will he
made by M. W. Wilkens, who, since his
arrival in this city, has taken a front
rank among the advocates of Social
ism. - ; â

DURRANT'S '
LAST HOPE
GLIMMERING
His Attorneys Fail to
Appear Before the
Court.
They Make an Appeal
to Governor Budd's
Clemency.
He Is Asked to Reprieve Dur
rant as a Witness in the
Libel Suit.
TESTING THE DEATH-TRAP
Experiments of the Executioner in a
Neighboring Cell Unnerve the
Condemned Man.
Nothing is more certain than the ex
ecution of Durrant Friday, unless
Governor Budd grants a reprieve.
Such is the consensus of opinion
among lawyers; such is the belief of
the Durrants themselves.
The threatened sensational coup of
the defense yesterday failed to put in
an appearance. Nor did Durrant's at
torneys fulfill the expectation that
they would apply to Judge de Haven
of the United States District Court
for a writ of habeas corpus.
Before the prospect of a reprimand
from the court they gracefully and
quietly withdrew. As this is the first
occasion on which they have recoiled
from their well advertised plan of
procedure it was regarded as proof
that they had exhausted their skein of
technical threads, likewise the pa
tience of the bench.
The attorneys consulted in the fore
noon; they consulted again in the
afternoon. Mr. Boardman was absent
from these meetings and was reported
to have left the city Saturday. No
one knew where he had gone. Some
one skilled in telepathy finally
communed with him on his way to
Washington, whither it was affirmed
he had hurried to ask the Federal
Court for a writ of habeas corpus. It
transpired late in the night that he
was still in the city and had no imme
diate intention of leaving it.
The fruition of the last ditch con
ferences, in which Mr. Boardman did
not participate, came toward the close
of the afternoon, when the other at
torneys representing Durrant and a
bewildering museum of legal quib
blings discovered the whereabouts of
Governor Budd, who is confined with
rheumatism at the home of his niece,
1010 Post street. With the Governor
was lodged the pleader of Durrant's
last hope, and, by the way, it proved
a revelation c-f ingenuity and persist
ence on the part of his counsel.
The substance <#f the petition was
that the Governor should reprieve
the condemned man, so that he might
be enabled 10 appear as a witness on
behelf of his mother in the $50,090
libel suit pending against Juror
Smyth. It was contended that his
testimony was not only essential but
vital to the cause of the plaintiff in
the libel action, and therefore the
Governor should stay the execution
until the civil suit could be disposed
of. The Governor agreed to read care
fully the documents in the case, but
beyond that assurance vouchsafed no
intimation of clemency.
Here the question as to whether
Durrant will hang according to law
next Friday or secure a further exten
sion of life rests. In the horizon of
the courts and the possibilities of le
gal procedure he has no hope.
It Is pretty well understood that
the securing of a writ of error from
the Federal Supreme Court would not
necessarily procure a stay of execu
tion. This device has been tried un
successfully in other Instances. The
court, while it would not issue the
supersedeas, could not set a day for
NEW TO-DAY.

hearing that would fall within the
brief period Durrant has to live under
the sentence. That it is the purpose
of Durrant's attorneys eventually to
go before the Supreme Court on a writ
of error seems obvious. Mr. Deuprey
did not say so much yesterday, but
he and his confreres have precedent
for such action. ;ind it may be in
ferred from what hp mysteriously
threatens that it is the intention to
continue Durrant's defense after he
has paid the penalty of his crimes.
While Mr. Deuprey endeavored to im
part the impression that his client
would be rescued from the jrallows at
the eleventh hour, he was at a loss to
suggest any legal process by which
such intervention could be accom
plished. His unvarying response to
every leading question as to how and
when the all-important steps were to
he taken was: "I can't say just yet.
I iind that every time we tell what we
are going to do we find ourselves
balked. I can't say; we are still in con
sultation and have not decided on our
course."
This was prior to the assault on the
Governor.whose whereabouts was then
unknown.
The determination that no autopsy
should be permitted provoked consider
able cojnment of a nature scarcely
necessary to quote, and will prove a
disappointment to the scientists inter
ested in medical jurisprudence.
The decision of Warden Hale that
Mis. Durrant should not be allowed to
witness the execution of her son was
received more favorably. She will be
granted a last interview with him be
fore he is led to the death chamber.
Unless this parting scene unnerves him
Durrant will occupy his last moments
on earth with an address to the wit
nesses of his expiation.
According to the preparation hp has
made, he will reaffirm his innocence to
the last and pray to God that the mur
derer of Blanche Lament and Minnie
Williams may be discovered. He Is los
ing the stoic composure which marked
his demeanor throughout, though he
struggles to maintain it.
Durrant's father will attend the exe
cution. He is greatly exercised lest the
camera preserve the closing scenes of
the execution, and he declares that he
will smash every one he can find in the
execution chamber. It Is thought that
professional photographers will be ex
cluded.
HE COUNTS THE HOURS.
Durrant Is Unnerved by the
Creaking of .the Death
Trap.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, Jan. 3.â
Durrant is beginning to show signs of
THE EASTERN AGENT A HARD BIRD.
"The Eastern agent is a hard bird to catch. He claims that the
stock he carries consists of samples, and under the decision of the
courts no license can be imposed. Once in a great while I catch one
of them napping, and then the most I can do is to impose a merchan
dise license tax en him. * â¢ I am heartily in accord with any move
ment on the part of the merchants of San Francisco to compel the East
ern agents to pay a fair and equitable license, and if the merchants
want to test the law I am willing to make an arrest for that purpose."â
License Collector Bonnet, in an int erview.
nervousness as the hour of execution
approaches. To-day the condemned
man had little taste for reading. He
paced the narrow confines of the death
chamber almost from the moment he
rose from his cot early in the morning
until late at night. His appetite has
left him, and the food carried him by
his guards is taken away almost un
touched. Several times he took up his
Bible, but he put it away after list
lessly turning over its leaves for a
few minutes.
Durrant had reason to be nervous.
In the room, next to where he lay,
waiting to be led up the fatal thirteen
steps to the death trap, the gallows
on which he will die was being tested.
The sound of the trap as it fell could
be heard in the death chamber, and the
doomed man realized that all was be
ing put in readiness to carry out the
order of the court. Durrant nodded
to his guards when he heard the sound
and told them he was ready for the
ordeal. He then counted up the hours
he had remaining to live and said with
a smile, "In ninety-two hours I will
have solved the great problem."
Soon after the Captain of the Yard,
Edgar, viÃited the condemned mur
derer and chatted with him for about
an hour. Durrant talked of the days
of his childhood, and told a few remi
niscences of the happy times he had
spent in Toronto, where he was born.
For some time after the captain's visit
he was more cheerful, but toward
night, he again became restless, and
frequently held his hands over his ears
as if to shut out the sounds made by
the executioner in testing the fatal
trap.
Cell No. 23, which Durrant occupied
when he was numbered among the
convicted men in murderers' row, is as
the doomed man left it when he was
taken up along the stairway to the
death chaimber. Not a paper has been
touched, and only the books the mur
derer asked to have with him until the
final hour were removed. The prison
officials said they left it that way for
Durrant's reception should he be
brought back to it as the result of
another stay of execution. A special
lock was put on the cell door, and
the warden holds the only key which
will give access to the thick walled
stone cell.
CREMATION REFUSED.
Arrangements Being Made for
the Burial of Durrant's Body.
A report was current to the effect
that arrangements had been made with
the authorities of the Odd Fellows'
cemetery to have the body of Theodore
Durrant interred there. In speaking of
the matter one of the officials said:
"There have been no arrangements
made to have the body of the now
famous criminal of the belfry interred
in this cemetery, nor do the family own
a plat here. But the fact of the matter
is this: Durrant's father did desire to
have the body cremated at our crema
tory, but remembering the notoriety
gained by interring the body of Golden
son here, I thought it best to consult
with our chief officers, and I found my
self under the unpleasant difficulty of
informing the elder Durrant that we
could make no such disposal of his
son's remains should the full decree of
the courts be carried out."
It was later learned that the firm of
Porter & White has a contract for the
disposal of the remains of him who has
been termed "the criminal of the cen
tury." In speaking of the matter, an
official said: "I am not at liberty to state
what arrangements, If any. are being
made for the disposal of the body of
Durrant; but this much I know: When
the date for the execution was form
erly set we had a contract to bury the
body in the family plat; in some ceme
tery, but what cemetery I do not know;
but I think you will be safe in saying
that it is Cypress Lawn Cemetery.
"So far as I know, the remains will
not be cremated, but will be buried. I
know that an attempt was made to
make arrangements to have the re
mains cremated at one of the local
crematories, but 1 am under the im
pression that the authorities of the
cemetery positively refused to make
any such agreement."

THE SAN FKAXCISCO CALI,, TUESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1898.
EASTERN
AGENTS ARE
FAVORED
They Pay No Taxes,
No Store Rent and
No City License.
Privileged to Sell Goods in
Competition With Our
Wholesale Merchants.
i
License Collector Bonnet Stands
Ready to Proceed in Law
Against Delinquents.
A FAIR DEAL DESIRED.
Resident Traders Owning Large Stocks
of Merchandise Entitled to Some
Consideration.
Wholesale merchants of San Fran
cisco who carry large stocks of mer
chandise, pay taxes on real estate and
personal property, give employment
to many permanent residents and also
pay a license for the privilege of
transacting business in this city have
a just grievance against many agents
of Eastern manufacturing firms. San
Francisco is to-day overstocked with
Eastern curbstone brokers â men whose
offices are in their hats. They contri
bute nothing to speak of to the sup
port of the municipal government. A
few of the most prominent pay the
small license of the manufacturer's
agent, but most of them manage to
escape all contribution to the revenues
of the city.
When commercial travelers repre
senting the leading mercantile houses
of San Francisco visit Victoria, Port
land, Seattle or other coast cities they
do so under instruction from the home
concerns to respect the license ordi
nance of the cities which they visit
and not evade payment for the privil
ege of selling goods in these places.
This custom should be observed in San
Francisco by the agents representing
manufacturing firms of Chicago,
Cleveland, Pittsburg, Boston, New
York and other cities of the East.
Speaking on this subject yesterday
Grove P. Ayres of the house of Hol
brook, Merrill & Stetson remarked:
"It is a common occurrence to find
that agents representing houses in the
East from which we purchase large
quantities of merchandise every year
are selling goods in this marker. These
agents simply come here and establish
an agency, or put up temporarily at
some hotel. They pay no rent worth
mentioning; they pay no taxes and do
not carry stocks of goods. They go
from house to house in trade and from
town to town and solicit. The custom
is not confined to the hardware busi
ness, but extends to dealings in boots
and shoes, dry goods, liquors, provis
ions, produce and other lines. When
there is ample production or overpro
duction in the East and large quanti
ties of goods of a certain line are on
hand San Francisco is used as a
dumping ground. The goods are sent
here and sold at a discount, which
brings the figure down to the actual
cost of production."
These transactions of everyday oc
currence have not escaped the observa
tion of A. A. Watkins of W. W.
Montague & Co., F. W. Van Sicklen
of Dodge, Sweeney & Co., A. C. Rulof
son of Baker & Hamilton and the
representatives of many other leading
wholesale houses of the city.
The method of solicitation is carried
to such an extent that the agent will
get retailers to the number of seven
or eight to join in ordering a carload
of goods, so that the lowest figure of
transportation can be obtained. Even
eggs by the carload are brought to the
city consigned to draymen, who de
liver the packages as marked to the
several retail merchants joining in the
enterprise.
It is acknowledged that competition
is the life of trade, but our wholesale
merchants, who are here established,
and who are taxed to pay for police
and fire protection, for schools and
municipal conveniences, should be pro
tected against unjust competition. The
fact was brought out incidentally at
a session of the State Board of Equal
ization in Sacramento that one large
Eastern corporation did a business in
San Francisco amounting to $1,000,000
a year, and that the only tax paid
was a municipal license. Every day
cash returns of sales were made to
the home office, hence there wan no
moqey in bank or in possession of the
agent of the corporation here to be as
sessed.
The volume of business daily trans
acted in San Francisco by manufac
turers' agents is immense. There is
no way to approximate it in dollars,
but the fact is obvious to all who come
in competition with the agency sys
tem that the curbstone brokers are
not compelled to bear the burdens of
taxation which the law imposes on
resident merchants who carry large
stocks of merchandise and conduct
business according to legitimate forms
of commerce.
Primarily the manufacturer's agent
was stationed in San Francisco to be
near the wholesaler, and to bring the
merchant into closer relation over the
wire with the manufactory. It was
the idea that the agent should herald
the superior worth of his own wares,
but that the trade should *>c supplied
through the resident wholesaler As
competition grew sharper the agent
ran down to Los Angeles and up to
Victoria, soliciting direct orders at
these places and at intermediate
points. This direct business becoming
profitable the idea of extending opera
tions to retailers residing in San Fran
cisco was grasped. Having no stock
of goods to be assessed, no store rent
to pay and getting goods in carload
lots for distribution to various retail
Its all in the finish!!

ers he was in a position to get a large
trade. Remonstrance was made by
resident wholesalers to the Eastern
manufacturers, but the latter replied:
"If you cannot sell our goods, we must
get some one else to sell them."
It is the sentiment of the mercantile
community that the Assessor and Li
cense Tax Collector should find some
way within the law to make these de
linquent brokers contribute something
to the support of the city government.
The Call will ascertain and publish
the names of these brokers and agents
who are daily soliciting and receiv
ing orders and at the same time re
sorting to tricks and devices to escape
the Assessor and Tax Collector.
License Collector Bonnet does not
hesitate to say that the merchants of
this city have been long suffering from
the present unjust and unequal li
cense tax laws.
"It is a shame." said he yesterday,
"that our merchants should be compelled
to pay license for conducting their bus
inesses in addition to paying for store
rent and for hire, and then allow East
ern agents who have their offices in
their hats, or in a small office at the
most, underselling and undermining
them. There seems to be no protec
tion, under the existing laws, for the
local merchants. The Eastern drum
mers come here, sell their goods and
skip off without contributing a cent of
revenue to the city."
"Is there no law to compel drum
mers from other States to pay a license
tax before doing business?" was asked.
"If there is I am not aware of it,"
replied Collector Bonnet. "I have care
fully studied the matter since I as
sumed the office of license collector,"
he added, "and in addition I hay.c had
the advice of City and County Att-. - r
ney Creswell. He is also of the opin
ion that there is no way of reaching
these Eastern drummers and agents
Under the decision of the UnltJMWstates
Supreme Court in the case of Rob
bins vs. the Selby Taxing District. It
was there held that the imposition of a
license tax on drummers from sister
States soliciting the sale of goods by
sample was unconstitutional. The
court held that when the goods came
into the State they could then be taxed
the same as other property. Who, then,
pays the tax? The local merchant and
buyer, not the Eastern agent or drum-
mer.
"The Eastern arent is a hard bird to
catch," added the License Collector.
"The agent claims that the stock he
] carries consists of samples, and under
the decision I quoted no license tax
. caji be imposed. Once in a great while
i I catch one of them napping, however.
and then the most I can do Is to im
pose a merchandise license tax on
them. As an instance of how the law
works. I will cite the case of a firm in
the Phelan building that represents an
Eastern hat manufacturing concern.
The firm carries quite an extensive line
of 'samples,' and I learned that when
one of its customers ran short of a
particular style of hat and wanted to
lmmeditely replenish his stock, he
bought the 'samples.' I immediately
compelled the firm to pay a mer
chandise license. Such cases as these
are rare, for the Eastern agent or
drummer is generally too cautious to
get caught selling any of the 'samples.'
I cite this case just to show how the
law is evaded."
"Some years ago," resumed Bonnet,
"the merchants of California were In
strumental in having a law passed by
the State of Nevada, ' imposing a
license tax on drummers from sister
States. The law was tested with the
result that the Supreme Court of Ne
vada decided that while a license tax
might be imposed on local drummers,
it was unconstitutional under the
United States Supreme Court decision
so far as the commercial travelers
from other States were concerned.
"The interstate commerce law seems
t" stand in the way of the needed
legislation." resumed Collector Bon
net. "When I took charge of the office
I went after the railroad ticket agents
to compel them to pay a merchandise
license in proportion to the business
they transacted. I found that I could
collect a license for tickets sold for
points within the State, but could not
collect- on tickets sold for points out
side of California, as that would be in
violation of the interstate commerce
act. That is but another instance of
the inequality and unfairness of the
law."
"Do the large Eastern firms carry
ing heavy stocks pay their licenses?"
was asked.
"They do not," replied Bonnet. "The
majority of them only pay when com
pelled to do so. There is Studenaker
Bros., manufacturing company, a
branch of a Chicago firm, with large
offices and salesrooms at the south
west corner of Market and Tenth
streets. This company, although con
ducting an extensive business, has not
paid any license tax for five or six
years. In looking over the books of
the License Office recently I discov
ered that the firm had until aereral
years ago paid a merchandise ttoease
tax of $41 a quarter. I found that the
firm was delinquent over $800 and
I made a demand for the back license
tax. A few hours later I received a

they had been regularly paid. I tele
phoned back that if that was the case
I wanted to see the last receipt. Then
en me the answer that the receipt could
not be found. I knew that there was
no receipt in existence, for the books

agent answered that the non-payment
of the license tax had been an over
sight and that the larger portion of
the delinquent tax was barred by the
statute of limitations. He was willing
to pay a merchandise tax of $195 for
the last two years, however, that be
ing the amount he figured due on the
sales for that period. Accompanying
the letter were sworn statements
showing that there had been a great
falling off in the business of the firm
from the time when $41 a quarter' was
paid as a merchandise license tax.
Acting under the advice of City and
County Attorney Creswell I accepted
the amount tendered, reserving, how
ever, the right to sue for the balance
due the city. To say that I was sur
prised when a large firm like Stude
baker Bros, would plead the statute
of limitations is putting it mild
"From the cases cited," concluded
Bonnet, "you can readily see the dif
ficulty experienced in collecting any
thing from Eastern firms, agents or
drummers. There is an ordinance pro
viding for the collection of licenses
from drummers, hut in the face of the
higher court decisions I am advised
that it is unconstitutional. I am heart
ily in accord with any movement on
the part of the merchants to compel
the Eastern^ agents and drummers to
pay a fair and equitable license, and if
the merchants want to test the law I
am willing to make an arrest for that
purpose."
