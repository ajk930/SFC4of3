A CHILD'S DEATH LEADS
TO A FATHER'S ARREST
The Supposed Berkeley Suicide
Believed to Have Been
Murdered.
Doctors Say That Miss
Brandes Did Not
Die From Stran
gulation.
As a sequel to the autopsy upon the body
of 16-year-old Lillian Brandes her father,
William Alfred Brandes, is confined in the
Alameda County Jail pending the verdict of
the Coroner's jury. Miss Brandes was
found dead on Saturday morning in Berke
ley, and to all appearances she died by her
own hand. The autopsy did not bear this
out. It was found that death resulted from
blows on the head. Mrs. Brandes, step
mother of the girl, admitted to Deputy
Sheriff Al White that she struck the child
with a stick last Wednesday night. At the
instance of the District Attorney the father
mas locked up without being formally
charged. The stepmother is is under police
surveillance.
William Aifred Brandes of Berkeley
is a prisoner in the Alameda County
Jail and his wife is under police sur
veillance. The man is held pending the
verdict of the Coroner's jury impaneled
to determine the cause of death of Lil
lian Brandes, only daughter of the pris
oner suffering detention. His frail slip
of a girl was found dead in her room
Saturday morning. Her father said she
â was hanging to the bedpostâ suspended
by a common apron of soft material.
It was at first given out by the au
thorities as a simple case of suicide. The
girl was of morbid temperament, and,
according to neighbors' stories, had
lived unhappily with her stepmother.
The body was removed to the Berkeley
Morgue, and a superficial examination
showed the authorities that murder
most foul had been committed. The
body was marked from ankles. to head
â with bruises. An investigation was in
stituted at once, which finally resulted
In the arrest of the girl's father.
The autopsy disclosed the fact that
death had not resulted from strangula
tion, but from blows administered upon
the head of the young girl. The theory
of the six medical men who performed
the autopsy was that the child was
beaten over the head last Wednesday
night, when neighbors heard a quarrel
between the girl and her stepmother.
Bhe was not able to attend school the
r.ext day, nor was she seen about after
v, ard. The beating confined her to her
bed.
The doctors hold that the wnunds on
the neck are superficial, and that death
did not result from strangulation. The
apron, of soft material, would not have
left the marks on the girl's neck. These
show plainly the imprint of a stout
rope. Whether this was applied before
or after death could not be determined.
As the result of the autopsy pointed
to the father and stepmother of the
dead girl it was determined to place the
former under arrest at once to prevent
flight.
The police are not too sure that the
girl was ever suspended to the bedpost.
The only information given out regard
ing this comes from the father. He
affirms that when he entered the girl's I
room, after being summoned by his !
wife, he found his daughter hanging to
the bedpost. He cut her down, placed
her on the bed and hurried away to
summon the doctor. It is claimed the
material o-f the apron would not have
held the body without breaking, and in
any event it would not have left the
girl's neck in the condition in which it
was found.
When the officers approached
Brandes 1 house there were evidences
of a possible attempt at flight. A
horse and buggy stood before the door
when the officers entered, but it had
gone when they came out again.
Mr. Brandes apparently expected a
visit from the police, as he showed no
token of surprise when Deputy Sheriff
Al White, accompanied by Marshal
Lloyd of Berkeley, appeared. The offi
cers went to- the house soon after 6
o'clock and found Brandes standing
just outside the front door. He knew
Mr. White personally and invited him
Into the house. They entered the par
lor of the cottage, and there was a
painful pause for a moment, when Mr.
White said: "Brandes, I come to place
you under arrest."
Brandes looked at him and said:
-Oh!"
"He then said: "I must see my wife,
and made a move as though to leave
the room. Mr. White stopped him, say
ing he would have her called. Before
Mrs. Brandes entered the room the
Sheriff and his prisoner went to the
kitchen by another passageway. The
wife then went back and sat down
while her husband wrote a telegram.
The Import of the Sheriff's visit grad
ually broke upon Mrs. Brandes, and she
became hysterical. The husband called
her "sweetheart" and other endearing
names and tried to calm her. Her eyes
.and his were tearless.
Brandes sat at the kitchen table and
wrote with a steady hand. He stopped
' in the m: Idle of his telegram and asked
what the bail would be.
To this Mr. White gave an evasive
answer.
Later on he asked: "Have you a war
tint?"
"You know as well as I do that I
>}n't need one," was the rejoinder.
Before the prisoner was taken from
the bouse he had a short interview with
his wife in the presence of Deputy Slier
The San Francisco Call
iff Al White. In this interview Mrs.
Brandes admitted to Mr. White that
she struck the child during their alter
cation last Wednesday evening:.
The wife prayed aloud for strength to
withstand the ordeal through which
she was to pass. Her grief did not ap
pear genuine, owing to the melodra
matic manner in which she gave voice
to it.
The rooms bear mute testimony to ,
her ability as a housewife. The walls i
are covered with her handiwork and j
with trophies of the field. There are
rifles and knives, police clubs, hand
cuffs and other articles. Out of keeping I
with the alleged brutality shown the j
children of the household is a framed j
certificate showing that Brandes is a
member in good standing of the So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to j
Children.
The parting: between husband and
wife was a simple one, and Brandes was
at jpnce taken on board a Telegraph
avenue car. He smoked a cigar and
talked incessantly of the enemies who j
were plotting his ruin. He told of his
daughter being simple-minded, and also
said his wife was at times the same.
As the car passed under an electric I
street light he said It was always j
necessary to watch his daughter at the
full moon. He mistook the electric light
for the moon, and noting his mistake
relapsed into silence for a time. He
asked for whisky, but was not given
any. He was placed on the "small
book" at the jail. He will not be j
charged until the verdict of the Coro- j
ner's jury is submitted.
Brandes is a man of imperious man- j
ner. When he called his wife he al- j
ways fallowed her name immediately j
with a sharp, hissing whistle, such as
boys are wont to make through their |
teeth. This was shown toward his lit- |
tie son also, and gives the key to his j
domineering character. He is a thick- j
set, dark-complexioned man, with a j
sharp-pointed black mustache. He is !
38 years of age, an American by birth,
hut with a trace of some foreign lan
guage in his speech.
An important witness in the case has
disappeared. This Is a nan who wa?
used by Brandes as an assistant. He \
occupied a room in the basement ad- j
joining that of the murdered girl. On
the morning of the tragedy he left the
house about 8 o'clock and left town at

once. He has not been seen since. It
is thought he has full knowledge of the
dreadful crime and will prove a strong
witness for the prosecution if he can
be found.
The reticence of the deputy coroner
and of Dr. F. G. Whltworth, the at
tending physician, concerning the con
dition and appearance of the unfortu
nate girl's body, as reported in yester
day's Call, is now fully explained. The
deputy coroner, satisfied that no mere
explanation of voluntary suicide could
fully account for all the circumstances
of the case, ordered a thorough exami
nation of the remains to be made and
conferred at once with Chief Coroner
Baldwin. The latter called for a pre
liminary inquest on Saturday night, at
which District Attorney Charles F.
Snook was present.
Dr. Whltworth found the body in a
frightful condition. Black bruises, some
of them several inches square, marred
the skin. Back of the two shoulders
evidences pointed to blows of terrible
severity. Severe gashes appeared on
each cheek. The neck was completely
ringed with contusions, as If from a
rope drawn tightly around it, ihe red
marks appearing regularly in streaks.
An autopsy was ordered immediately
by the District Attorney. Evidence of
foul play pointed mutely from the
bruises and gashes, which it was clear
could neither have been self-inflicted
nor the result of mere hanging. Two
Sheriffs-d eputies had been detailed
meanwhile to guard the house, and
their vigilance remained unabated un
til late in the afternoon.
The autopsy, conducted by Dr. H.
Buteau of Oakland, was witnessed by
live local physicians, Drs. Eastman,
Shannon, Renell, Hoagland and Whit
worth. It consumed roughly about
three hours â from 3 o'clock till 6. At
the conclusion Dr. Buteau made the
following statement in his report to the
District Attorney:
"I have found the head very much
battered, with external markings on
the skin, indicating most brutal treat
ment. All evidences of hang-ing or
death by strangulation were only
superficial, being made probably aft
er death had really occurred. The
whole skull cap was badly bruised,
the injuries on the hÂ«ad being suffi
cient to have brought about death.
They were most likely caused by some
hard object.
"The marks around the neck were
certainly not made by the apron
which was left hanging to the bed
post. The material of the latter was
quite soft, and had it caused strangu
lation, would have left a different
mark than the one which I found
encircling the neck. The marks could

LONDON, Nov. 20.â Sir George
Smythe Baden-Powell, the eminent po
litical economist, and author on Colo
nial affairs, who has represented the
Kirkdale division of Liverpool in Par
liament in the Conservative interest
since 1885, died to-day in his fifty-first
year.
The late Sir George Baden-Powell,
who was born at Oxford on December
24, 1847, was a son of the well-known
Rev. Baden-Powell, professor of geom
etry in the University of Oxford whose
magnum opus was written to demon
strate that science and revelation are
in harmony rather than antagonistic.
Sir George's mother was a dauffhter of
the distinguished British Admiral
Smythe. He was prepared for Oxford
at Marlborough and graduated from
the university with honors in 1878, win
ning the chancellorship prize for Eng
lish essay. In the interlude between
leaving Marlborough and taking up his
university studies, he traveled in In
dia and Australia and visited the prin
cipal European cities, as well as the
Cape.
The first year of his university ca
reer saw published his "New Homes
for the Old Country." This important
book" was pronounced by the .London
Times a "'standard work," the London
Athenaeum declaring it to be "an en
cyclopedia of Australian knowledge."
This volume was followed by two on
political economy â "Protection and Bad
Times" and "State Aid and Interfer-
ence."
In 1880 he went to the "West Indies to
investigate the effect of the sugar
bounty system on West Indian sugar
planting and two years later Mr. Glad
stone appointed him a special commis
sioner to report upon the administra
tion, revenue and expeditures of Great
J-.-1 .in's felonies in thr "West liidiej*.
His report, contained in five blue books,
was regarded as a complete summary
of West Indian affairs.
In 1885 he went to South Africa and
joined Sir Charles Warren In j-.,/:hua
naland, assisting him in diplomatic ne
gotiations with the native chiefs. At
this time he made a tour of investiga
tion of Bechuanaland, Zululand and
other countries in that part of Africa.
In the winter of 1886-87 he was in
Canada and the United States draw
ing up details in the fishery dispute, of
which Mr. Chamberlain was subse
quently commissioned to negotiate a
final arrangement
In the autumn of 1887 the British
Government sent him to Malta as the
colleague of Sir George Bower, who ar
ranged details of the new Malta consti
tution. It was at this time he received
the honor of knighthood. In 1891 he
was appointed joint commissioner on
the condition of seal life in Bering Sea.
He was most industrious and a pro
lific writer, a keen sportsman and so
cially a great favorite in the House of
Commons.
Evacuation of Cuba.
HAVANA, Nov. 20.â Captain General
Blanco received from Paris to-day a cable
authorizing him to draw on Paris for
$2 000,000 in gold, to be applied in the pay
ment of the Spanish troops in Cuba. This
amount is in addition to the proceeds of
the draft for Â£425.000 by the Madrid Gov
ernment on London, which was sold here
last week. The Spanish authorities are
making strenuous efforts to complete the
evacuation by the end of the. year.

PARIS, Nov. 20.â The Govern
ment, according to the Temps,
has ordered a modification of
the prison treatment of former
Captain Dreyfus. Dreyfus is to
be allowed to promenade and ex
ercise six hours a day over an
area of eight acres.
PARIS, Nov. 20. â Unfortunate Drey- I
fus seems to be nearing the end of his I
period of probation. It now appears j
fairly certain that he will be brought
back to France within a very short
time. Already the severity of the
regime which he has been subjected
to is relaxed. In case he does return
here in all probability he will be con
fined in a civil conciergerie prison and
not in the military one of Cheriche j
Midi. This is really because after his I
degradation Dreyfus comes under the j
jurisdiction of the civil authorities. Alll
the same there are many who declare
this measure is being taken to insure
his safety.
A subject that is much discussed to
day is Count Esterhazy's memoirs. So
far nobody attaches much importance
to them. As a matter of fact the only
point brought out at present is Ester
hazy's amazing lack of conscience. He
claims he was the instrument of the
general staff. If this statement is true
it only shows what questionable tools
were necessary to prove Dreyfus
guilty.
These memoirs are written In a style
that we have become only too familiar
with during the polemic over the Drey
fus affair as conducted in some of the
gutter papers here, and leave a very
saddening impression.
The Liberti says that, after having
extracted money from the credulity of
the general staff, Esterhazy is trying
to exploit the credulity of the public.

TERRE HAUTE, Ind.. Nov. 20.â Morton
Hudson of this city has just arrived from
Mexico, where he has been in prison for
over six months. Last February Hudson
and a friend named Powell went on a
prospecting tour near Toluca. Mexico.
They were returning from the town of
"Veregueria. where they had been to pur
chase supplies for their camp, when they
were set upon by Mexican highwaymen.
One of the Mexicans clapped a pistol to
Powell's head, but the American graspe.i
his assailant and the two fell from their
horses. The second Mexican, who was
armed with a sword, was in the act of
plunging it into Powell's back, when Hud
son brought him to the ground with a well
directed shot.
The first Mexican was rapidly overpow
ering Powell, when the latter called for
helâ¢ Hudson went to his assistance,
when the highwayman aimed his pistol
at the advancing man. Hudson was too
quick, however, and shot the man through
his breast. , ,
The two Americans then concealed
themselves in the mountains until they
finally decided to surrender to the Mexi
can authorities. Hudson was thrown into
jail at Tenancingo. but finally got a let

authorities in Washington caused his trial

Special Dispatch to The Call.
MADRID, Nov. 20.â 1n politi
cal circles it is asserted that an
agreement has been reached be
tween the Peace Commissioners
in Paris. The Government, it is
officially announced, intends to
notify the Cuban bondholders
that Spain will not pay the Cu
ban debt, which will not be men
tioned in the peace treaty. The
Government considers itself com
pletely freed from these entan
glements, which fall upon the
nation exercising sovereignty and
collecting taxes in Cuba,
PARIS, Nov. 20.â The Spanish Peace
Commissioners have been notified that
the United States Commissioners will
be ready to treat with them in Joint
session to-morrow afternoon. Unless
the Spaniards have an adequate reason
for further delay the two commissions
will join in the most important meet
ing thus far held.
The American Commissioners, in a
written communication, will declare
that the third article of the protocol
regarding the Philippines is capable of
only one fair construction; that no rea
son is needed to elucidate its terms, and
that the United States cannot admit any
c-ther power to argue with her purely
as a lexologist. They will maintain
that the two commissions are charged
to determine whether Spain or the
United States shall in the future own
the Philippines. This will be accom
panied by the clear declaration that the
, United States will possess the Philip
pines.
Following this declaration the Amer
ican Commissioners will lay before the
Spanish two alternatives:
Firstâ To accept a sum of money
from the United States and to cede and
evacuate the Philippines.
Secondâ To lose the Philippines to the
United States by conquest, with the
possibilities of other territorial losses
to indemnify the United States for the
added expense of conquest.
This communication may not be for
mally designated as an ultimatum, but
it will lack naught of the conclusive
ness indicated by that word. This will
be so plain that the Spanish Commis
sioners will scarcely haggle for money
on the first alternative, nor cherish any
doubt of American action under the
second should the first be declined.
None here except the American Com
missioners know how much will be
tendered Spain as the cheapest and
most humane way of settling the diffi
culty. She is exceedingly anxious to
escape the Philippine debt, and possibly
the sum to be offered may be deter
mined by an analysis of that debt,
which consists of $40,000,000 in bonds, on
which she realized $36,000,000. Of the
latter amount she is believed to have
expended some $10,000,000 or $11,000,000
in fighting the United States and a part
in attempting to quell the Philippine in
surgents. A reasonable guess at the
sum for tender would be $20,000,000, al
though it may fall below that.
The Cuban question may come up
again to-morrow. The American Com
mission had thought the discussion on
that point finished, but the Spanish
Commissioners are reported to have
declared last week that the mortgages
imposed by Spain on the Cuban, as well
as on the Philippine revenues, must not
be impaired or questioned. This would
compel the American Commissioners
soonâ and probably to-morrowâ to de
mand whether Spain means to repudi
ate the plain compact of the protocol to
relinquish sovereignty over and title to
Cuba.
Three weeks ago the Spanish Com
missioners accepted the Cuban article
in the protocol without conditions, save
its embodiment in the treaty should
depend on only an agreement here on
all the articles of the protocol. Re
cently, however, Spain's representatives
have said that the Cuban matter had
only been temporarily passed and was
still in abeyance.
BUT WILL SPAIN DARE
TO REJECT THE OFER?
LONDON, Nov. 21.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Daily Mail says: "It
is asserted that the Government would
reject an ofter of $40,000,000 for the
Philippines as ridiculous."
The Madrid correspondent of the
Standard says: "Spain will decline in
demnity for the Philippines if the sum
offered appears inadequate in the eyes
of the nation."
The Daily Chronicle, In an editorial
on the Spanish-American situation this
morning, after expressing "some ap
prehension that we may have been mis
taken with regard to the Anglo-Ameri
can entente," points to tha "establish
ment of a medieval navigation law in
Porto Rico," and aska: "Is a still
graver disappointment coming in the
closing of the doors to our commerce
in the Philippines?"

CONGRESS SPRINGS, Nov. 20.â A
church service has done more for the
Stanford squad in dispelling the gloom
and restoring happiness of spirit than all
the exhortations of the coaches, who now
number fourâ Harrelson, Downing, Clem
ens and Coach-in-chief Cross. The team
went to church at Saratoga this morning
and returned a much gayer body of men.
Though the sudden Improvement in the.
spirits of the men is associated in point of
time with the church-going, the team to a
man asserts that one is not the conse
quence of the other. The difference in
their feelings is ascribed to the beneficial
effects of two days in the mountains. The
men with the malaria are beginning to
feel themselves again and the men with
the bruises and sprains are now in such
condition that they can don jacket and
moleskin and play.
There is certainly a marked improve
ment in the condition of the players now
gathered in their mountain retreat. Bur
meister. whose ankle and knee were giv
ing him considerable trouble, will recover
the full use of his kicking leg and will
undoubtedly appear in the game Thanks
giving day it no further accidents return
him to the repair shelf. James and all
.â â¢iit'rs of the first eleven are In pretty fair
physical condition at present and will un
doubtedly be strong by Thursday unless
they meet other mishaps. The second
eleven men are in good form and are
ready with the assistance of the graduate
players to make things warm for the var
sity.
No practice game was had to-day, the
men simply lining up in s.neir civilian
suits and going through the signals of the
new plays. Murphy donned a .suit, bow
ever, and practiced punting. He is back
to his old form in this particular, kick
ing fifty yards at every try. He now
weighs 148 pounds, is in splendid condi
tion and is playing the best of ball at
Congress Springs.
Freeman's dislocated shoulder may not
prevent him playing in the game on
Thursday. His toss would 1"* considered
the most serious that could befall the line
at the present time. His playing was of
such superior quality to that of any other
man trying for the position that his ab
sence will leave a great weakness in the
center. A harness has been made for him
and he will go into battle with this leath- 1
crn protection.
In the morning the team and the
coaches attended the service at Rev. Mr.
Cross' church at Saratoga. The sermon i
was localized to suit the occasion and was
listened to with much attention by the '
corps of rcd-sweatered atnietes who
crowded the benches.
Coach Cross looked a bit more cheerful ,
to-day. He said:
"I feel a bit more satisfied than I have j
been for some days. The men are recov- !
ering from their injuries and physical in
disposition, and I think the next two days |
will bring the team out of the rut. There i
Is still a great lack of team work, due I
to misfortunes rather than failure. I j
shall keep the team at hard work to-mor
row and Tuesday, practice morning and
afternoon."
BERKELEY IS CONFIDENT.
But Cochran Says the Tussle Will Be i
a Hard One.
BERKELEY, Nov. 20.â Berkeley has
shown enthusiasm before, but never in
its history has it reached such a pitch as
now animates the adherents of the blue
and gold. The last week at the State Unl- j
versity has been one series of rallies,
speeches and yells. Old graduates, who
followed the pigskin in years g-one by
have sauntered back to the campus to
urge the team on to its work, and to help
chare in the tremendous outburst of col- |
lege spirit. A feeling of confidence haÂ«
settled on the wear, j,- of the blue and i
gold which neither tei%K>rary mishaps to
layers, nor the restraining influence 1
of the coach can shake in the least degree. I
Cochran, however, does not think the
outlook so promising. In an interview to
day he said:
"It eeems to me that the college is alto
gether too confident over this matter, and
fails to see that the game will be one of j
The hardest it has ever played. Stanford
Is likely to improve at least a hundred per
cent before Thanksgiving, and unless the
men here improve accordingly there is not j
so much hope for us. Nothing but the |
most faithful, conscientious work on the j
part of the team will give us any chance j
before the cardinal."
Whor. asked about the condition of the j
men and the work they were doing, Coch
ran said:
"The men at present seem to be in ex- !
cellent .condition. With the exception of I
Hopper, whose playing is now out of the I
question, all the players are quite ready I
for tho ilnal struggle. As to the work of j
the team, I feel quite satisfied with it. j
You cannot instill the genuine football
spirit into a college in one short year, and
Berkeli y has still much to learn. I be
lieve now that she '.as started in the
â¢ripht direction, and a few years may
bring pood results. As for It raining on
Thanksgiving, such an event would prove j
of advantage to Stanford, as her players I
â are. pn the average, four pounds heavier
:t.'.Ann ours. It would be a mere question of
â¢â â¢â  weight, and Stanford is ahead of us in
'.iliat.- I think that rain would materially
.Walter* the .prospects for either side. Of
/course.- I feel that the intense interest
"which seems to have boon worked up in
the college has had a telling- effect upon i

most probably done after death had '

the tragedy. On the contrary all signs
pointed to an uncommon degree of in
telligence. To her school friends, who
were few, and to the neighbors' chil

to no special mental unsoundness.
But the state of the "skull cap," or
the upper hemisphere of the skull, ex

: were perfectly sound, in strong contrast
! to the place where blows had fallen.
A consultation of the docto-rs present
reached the conclusion that Lilliar
lirandes met her fate at the hands oÂ£
i some person, who had killed her by in
; ilicting two mortal blows upon the
head. ,
Attention being directed to the neck
! the idea of suicide by hanging was
speedily dispelled. Dr. Buteau found
the injuries here were all skin deep.
2w signs were present beneath Lhe
skin's surface to show that anything
had clutched the neck severely enough
to point to strangulation. The marks
were entirely superficial. Dr. Buteau
was of the opinion that the neck nad
been hastily squeezed by some tight
rope the pressure remaining on but a
short time. The physicians to
gether agreed that the soft apron,
which it was stated the father had cut
in taking the body down from the bed
could not account for the condi
tion in which the neck was found.
( Â»n hearing the result of the autopsy
the District Attorney held a short con
ference with Sheriff White, as a result
Of which it was decided to place
Brandes under arrest.
"J fun innocent of the charge made
against me of murdering my little girl,"
said Brandea after his arrest. "These
charges have been trumped up against
me by my enemies in order to ruin
my business. They have had me ar
rested before, but have never been
able to injure me, as their charges -were
always groundless. This time they
saw their opportunity and by making
this terrible charge against me expect
to break down my business. No one
will want to hire me as a watchman
n<>\v, as pebple will always point at me
and say, 'He was arrested and charged
with murdering his child.' This will
be sufficient to break up my business.
â¢1 came home on Saturday morning
and went upstairs to bed. In a few
minutes my wife called me and I
dressed hurriedly and went downstairs.
I found my daughte- hanging to the
bedpost, being suspended with an
apron. She was still warm a hen I cut
her down and laid her on the bed. I
did not wait a moment, but hurried
away for a doctor. When he came she
Was beyond aid.
"The child was simple-minded and
we were always in fear she would kill
herself. We found a knife secreted in
her bed to-night. At certain times she
was vfoient and difficult to manage. She
would steal knives, razors, money or
anything we had about the house.
"She had trouble with her stepmother
last Wednesday. I had $15 in the
house with which to pay a bill. We
missed it and accused her of taking
it. Hhe finally dug $14 out of the earth
in the back yard, where she had con
cealed it. We insisted on her giving
back the remaining dollar and she fin
ally did so. On Wednesday evening she
quarreled with her stepmother and
struck her with a stick. Mrs. Brandes
grabbed the stick from her and struck
her with it. In the scuffle that followed
the girl fell down the stairs. If there
are any bruises on her head that must
have been the time she received them.
1 I had determined to send her away
to a girl's school and she was to leave
on Saturday. She may have brooded
over this and determined to end her
life. She was always hard to manage
when the moon was full, it seeminy to
affect her very much. I blame the
Richards family, colored people, who
live next door to me, for this trouble.
They and some political enemies of
mine are responsible for this charge
against me.
"My wife is subject to fits and con
vulsions and I am afraid this will kill
her. She may take her own jile. I have
had more than my share of trouble, but
this is the most cruel of all. As God is
my Judge I did nut kill my little girl.
I v/ould give my right arm to have her
with me now."
Brandes' reputation In Berkeley,
where he acts as patrolman and night
watchman, is said to be of the very
worst kind. It was rumored, soon after
his arrival there from Sausalito, that
he had been driven away from the lat
ter place by enraged citizens, who re
garded his presence as a general nui
sance in the community. It is affirmed
he soon began to work a policy of
blackmail upon the residents of the
university town. As self-appointed pa
trolman and night watchman he levied
sums of $1 and $2 upon each house in
the neighborhood for the ostensible
purpose of protecting them from thieves
and burglars. He would represent the
condition of the town to be thoroughly
unsafe and extort monthly pay for ser
vices accordingly. Most of the resi
dents with whom his occupation
brought him in contact regarded him
as a nuisance, and paid the toll he ex
acted more for the sake of being rid
of him than anything else.
His plan of operation was an ill-con
cealed scheme of double dealing. With
in the district of his patrol are several
club houses, used by university stu
dents. To the residents generally he
has been known to represent that they
would be subject to indiscretions on the
part of the clubhouse members, in fre
quent disturbances of the peace, and on
the ground of preventing" these he has
levied his toll. From the clubhouse
members themselves he has exacted
money for the express purpose of
quietly Ignoring all that they might do.
This system of blackmail he has lately
found it difficult to carry out. â "
More than once has he tried to secure
an appointment under , the Sheriff as â  a
deputy constable. At one time he was
successful. But the enjoyment of his
official position was only shortlived.
The next day public indignation forced
the Sheriff to cancel the appointment,
and since then |he has received no offi
cial recognition from either county or
town authorities. : About seven months
ago he was arrested for , stealing lum-
ber from a neighbor's yard. ,
Among his immediate neighbors he is
said to be both feared and despised.
The treatment shown toward his two
children is notorious in the community.
Aside from the instances brought 1 to
light, in connection with . Saturday
morning's tragedy, he is said always to
have treated both boy and girl with
brutal severity, and to have made.their
lives miserable with harsh blows and
curse/* . j. â¢
CORBETT NEVER
IN BETTER FORM
This the Declaration
of His Trainer.
WILL WEIGH 182 POUNDS
SHARKEY TO BE SIX POUNDS
LIGHTER.
Indications Are That There Will Be
No Interference With the Mill
by the Police or
Others.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Nov. 20.â That the 20
round bout getween James J. Corbett j
and Thomas Sharkey will be brought i
to a decision before the Lenox Club j
next Tuesday night without police or
other interference is now almost a cer- |
tainty. With the big contest only for- j
ty-eight hours hence, everything seems j
to be running smoothly, for, as yet, not j
one word of protest, lay or clerical, has I
been uttered in reference to the meet- 1
ing of the pugilists within the limts j
of the city. The legal authorities seem
to be prefectly satisfied that every de
tail of the Horton law governing pugil
istic exhibitions in this state will be
lived up to by the jvxlnclples.
Corbett is the favorite in the betting
at 100 to 80, and the general Impression
is that the rules governing the bout,
which call for a clean break, favor him.
The sailor pugilist is strong on In-fight
ing, but has yet to show any degree of
cleverness at long range work, while
the very opposite can be said of Cor
bett.
Another thing which good judges re
fer to is Sharkey's lack of control over
his temper when receiving punishment.
During his long weeks of hard train
ing under the supervision of Tom
O'Rourke, the sailor has learned to
govern his temper in this respect, and
great things are expected of him by his
friends and 1 ackers. No man could
have trained more carefully than Shar
key has, and the same can be said of
Corbett, to whom victory means much.
Charley White, who has charge of
the ex-champion's training, is more
than satisfied with Corbett's work and
present condition. He says his man
was never in better condition than
now, and, barring accident, will cer
tainly win.
Corbett, White says, will enter the
ring welghin- about 182 pounds.
O'Rourke said to-night Sharkey's
weight would be 176 pounds. Reports
from both sides to-night were to the
effect that each man Ss in the best con
dction physically and equally confident
of winding.

unusually heavy, amounting to nearly
$30,000. The purse of $20,000, it ia an

STERNBERG'S
REPORT ON THE
MEDICAL WORK
Sickness Due to Camp
Conditions.
SURGEONS ALSO LIMITED
MANY CONTRACT DOCTORS EM
PLOYED DURING THE WAB.
Want of Sufficient Body of Trained
Hospital Corps Men Was Also
Keenly Felt in the Cuban
Campaign.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 20.â Surgeon-
General George M. Sternberg haa made
his report to the Secretary of War. It
relates mainly to the work of the mcdi-
I cal corps during the war. The follow
ing are the more important features
of the report:
The number of medical officers, 192, al
lowed by law to the army In inadequate in
time of peace. The insufficiency in time
of war was met by the assignment of over
650 contract surgeons. Tne very small
proportion of medical officers having ex
perience of a military character impaired
ihe efficiency of the department ut the
outset, but many of the staff surgeons
from civil life showed great aptitude for j
the service and speedily became of value
as administrative sanitary officers.
No provision was made for hospital
corps men for the volunteer troops except
that which empowered the Secretary of
War to enlist as many privates of the hos
1 piuil corps as the service may require.
! The number of men enlisted and trans
ferred during the war was approximately
i 1-000.
The want of a sufficient body Of trained
I hospital corps men necessitated the detail
of enlisted men from the regiments for
hospital duty in several of the camps and
the employment of trained nurses at the j
general hospitals. Over 1700 female nurses j
1 nave been employed, at first at the gener- |
al hospitals and later at the field division
hospitals when it became evident that the
j field service purposes for which the latter
I had been organized would have to give
place to the imperative need of caring for
the many sick men coming from the regi
mental camps.
Immediately upon the declaration of
war, April 21*. steps were taken to obtain
medical supplies for the new volunteer
army. The manufacture was expedited
with the utmost dispatch. On May 3, fore
seeing that it would be impossible to have
ready for the issue to the volunteer regt
mentf. as soon as they were mustered in
the necessary articles of field equipment,
I telegraphed the Governors of the several
Stittos for authority to use the medical
i equipment of the National Guard in the
I service of the State until our army mcdi-
I cal supplies were ready for issue. Most of
tin- Governors who had field equipment
responded promptly and satisfactorily, but
unfortunately many of the State medical
departments had no such equipment.
Meanwhile the officers in charge of the
medical supply depots were directed to
make arrangements no that supplies could
be immediately obtained for 100,000 men
for six months.
Whenever the notice was received from
the adjutant general's office that com
mands were to oe moved or camps formed
I endeavored to anticipate the wants of
the troops by telegraphing to the officer
in charge of the nearest supply depot to
forward supplies for the stated number
of men.
In my opinion the reduction of the age
limit from 21 to 18 years and the haste
with which the volunteer regiments were
organized and mustered into the service
were responsible for much of the sickness
which was reported in the early days of
the camp life. All military experience
shows that young men upnder 21 yean
break down rapidly under the strain of
war service, and every regiment had
many of these youths in its ranks. Medi
cal examiners were appointed to testify
to the physical conditions of each man
before acceptance, but, notwithstanding
this, so many men were afterward found
on the sick lists of the camps unfit for
service from causes existing prior to en
listment that special arrangements had
to be made for their discharge.
Soon after the newly raised levies were
aggregated In large camps sickness
began to increase progressively from
causes that were so general in their op
eratfon that scarcely a regiment escaped
from their harmful influence. These
causes may largely be referred to ignor
ance on the part of officers of the princi
ples of camp sanitation and their duties
and responsibilities as regards to the wel
fare of the enlisted men in their com
mands.
The sites of certain of the camps have
been Instanced in the newspapers as the
cause of the sickness which was developed
in them; but a review of the whole situ
ation shows that it was not the site, but
the manner of its occupation which must
be held responsible for the manner and
spread of disease among the troops.
On April 25. IS9B. foreseeing the likelihood
of unsanitary conditions in the camps, I
issued circular No. 1 impressing upon
medical officers their responsibility in
sanitary matters and the necessity for a
strict sanitary policy, particularly in the
case of the sick and in the preservation
of the camp area from contamination.
But the necessity of the military popula- |
tion on the area of these contracted
camps prevented the possibility of good
sanitary- conditions. Camps of this char
acter rriay be occupied for a week or two
at a time without serious results, as in
the case of National Guardsmen out for !
ten days' practice during the summer, but
their continued occupation will inevitably :
result in the breaking down of the com
mand by diarrhoea, dysentery and
tynhoid fever.
Practically nothing was done to make
the men comfortable or remedy the sani
tary conditions until these were brought !
to the attention of the Secretary of War
by inspectors sent out from the War De- i
partment. Then the camps held for so j
long were abandoned, but not before the
manifestations of typhoid infection were '
rife in them. New sites were carefully
selected, regimental camps were expand
ed company tentage increased and board
flooring provided. Then for the first time
the troops went Into camps suitable for
continued occupation.
One prominent cause of the increase of
sickness In the early camps has been com
mented upon by only a few of our mcd- '
ical officers. These cite the prevalence of
drunkenress and of disease due to the
facilities and temptations afforded by
the proximity of cities to the larger
camps. They hold that if the systems of
the men had not been weakened by dissi
pation they would not have succumbed so
readily to the other influences which af
fected' them.
It was typhoid fever which broke down
tbÂ« strength of the commands generally, !
the outbreak becoming distinctly manifest
in July. Sporadic cases appeared in most !
of the regiments in May and June, these '
cases having been brought, in many in-
Stances, from the State companies. In
fact, some regiments, as the Fifteenth
Minnesota, suffered more from this dis
ease- at their State rendezvous than any of i
the regiments at the large Federal camps. !
It appears from a general review of the
sanitary reports already filed that the i
prevalence of the disease was proportion
ed to the unsanitary camp conditions
which T have referred to. The probabil
ity of its communication- to soldiers In
camps through the agency of flies was
pointed out as a reason for Insisting on a
sanitary policy of the strictest character.
It in well known to the medical profession
that this fever is propagated by a con
taminated water supply, and it is now
recognized that the great prevalence of
this disease in an aggravated form in the
camps of the civil war was due to the use
of surface and shallow well waters infect
ed by typhoid excreta. To prevent the
transmission by. the water supply I rec
ommended the tse of boiled and filtered
water when a pure spring supply could
not be obtained and to enable an effi
cient fllteration of suspected waters to
be made, field filters of approved con- I
struction were issued on my recommenda
tion by the quartermaster's department.
CARE OF THE SICK AND WOUNDED.
The seriously sick were to be treated In
their division field hospitals unless their
transfer to the general hospital was ad
visable under the care of the most experi
enced < physicians and i able surgeons on
duty with each division. Medical officers
left on duty with their, regiments were to
exercise . sanitary supervision over/ the
well men and to determine whether a sol
dier reporting himself sick should be- sent
to the hospital or remain as a trivial
case under treatment in quarters. The
consolidation of the medical force by di
visions, implying,' as it did, the breaking
up of the regimental hospitals, met with
a strong opposition from regimental med
ical officers, particularly from those who
were not detailed for special service at
the division hospitals.
THE FIFTH x ARM V CORPS.
Long before this corps embarked for
Cuba Its field hospitals were in condition
'for efficient service. Subsequent events
have rendered valueless these'prepara
tions of the medical department. When
the command embarKed on the transport
vessels the baggage wagons and mules
were left behind. The ambulance trains
of all the divisions with a .arge part of
! the outfit of each of the hospitals were
â  also left behind.. Three ambulance wagons
were taken apart, and stored on one of
the vessels. These did excellent service
at San Juan and El Caney. Ten of the
ambulances of tne ihird or reserve divi
sion hospital were subsequently .shipped
to Cuba, where they urived July 2 and
were of value in moving ..he sick and
wounded to the hospital at Siboney and to
the hospital ships and transports. Of the
property and supplies carried to Cuba, a
portion was not available for service at
the time it was neededâ to wit, on July
1, 2 and 3, when the wounded from El
Caney and San Juan were coming from
the front for care and treatment. This
was because,- in general, no opportunity
was afforded to land the medical prop
erty. Earnest efforts were made by med
ical officers to have supplies at the front
with the troons. During and after the
battles at El Caney and San Juan there
was an insufficiency of tents, cots, bed
ding and medicines, due to the causes
stated, but all the hospitals were well
equipped for surgical work. _
After the capitulation of Santiago the
troops at the front broke down rapidly
under the fatigues they had undergone
and the malarial influences to which they
were exposed; but by this time an ample
supply of tents, furniture, bedding, cloth
ing and medical stores had reached Sibo
nev, totgether with a corps of trained
nurses and a force of surgeons, who were
sent to duty at the yellow fever hospitals,
being immune to the disease. Meanwhile,
to relieve the pressure in the field hospi
tals, such convalescents and sick as could
bear the journey were sent to the I nited
States on transport vessels. This was an
emergency measure to redeye the hospi
j tals at Siboney and permit of he transfer
to them of the men who were sick in regi
mental camps. The transfer of troops
from Santiago to Montauk Point was also
an emergency measure and the great re
sponsibility of excluding ye llow Â£S v " /Â£_
fiction from every transport rested on the
medical officers who had charge of the
embarkation. Had they failed in this duty
the effect would have been disastrous dur
ing the voyage to the men on shipboard
and the risk of importing the disease into
this country would have been K^eatly In
creased It Is needless to refer at this
time to the complaints of starvation which
appeared almost da ly In the^newspapers
during the occupation of Camp IKâ¢. â 
for it is now generally understood that
! the weakness, prostration anemia and
emaciation of so many of the troops were
the results of malarial, typhoid and > el
low fever from which the army suffered
as a consequence of its exposure to the
climatic Influences and to infections of
Santiago and its neighborhood pending
and subsequent to the surrender of the
city. '^-/
TROOPS IN THE HOME CAMPS.
The method of hospital organization in
these camps was practically the same,
and there was much similarity in the con
ditions affecting them and corresponding
ly in their history. Regiments reported
but in few Instances with the material and
supplies for their medical care; but they
brought sick men with them and these re
quired immediate care. Provision had to
be made for division hospitals in view of
future field service and for regimental
hospitals In view of the immediate neces
sity. Chief surgeons, officers and divisions
began the organization and equipment of
their field division hospitals and ambu
lance companies, but they were met at the
outset by the apparent impossibility of se
curing men for service as cooks, nurses,
litter bearers, ambulance drivers, team
sters, etc. As a result the hospitals were
kept in campaigning conditions; that is,
the tents were neither framed nor floored
until the increased prevalence of typhoid
fever attracted attention to their crowded i
condition, when the object of their exist
ence became suddenly changed from a
school for field service to a. hospital for
the treatment of a local outbreak of dis
ease. Special diet kitchens, under the
management of capable individuals, were
opened at most of the hospitals. Money
for this purpose was sent to them by me
from funds contributed and placed at my
disposal. Money was also sent directly by
individuals and representatives of aid so
cieties, and the Red Cross committees
supplied quantities of Ice and milk, chick
ens, eggs, lemons, etc., pajamas, night
shirts and other articles of hospital cloth
ing were provided by the Red Cross and
other aid societies. Subsequently the or
der placing the commutation of the sick
soldier's rations at 60 cents rendered these
hospitals independent of outside assist- '
ance. About July 20 the troops for the I
invasion of Porto Rico embarked and
sailed. The field hospital accommodation
with this expeditionary force was ample
and the supplies abundant.
TROOPS ON THE PACIFIC COAST.
The precautions taken to secure a good
sanitary condition on the vessels prior to
embarkation and the sanitary supervi
sion exercised over the men during their
long voyage must be credited to the ex
cellent condition of the troops at Manila.
The want of hospital corps men was the
main cause of the failure of chief sur
geons to establish their division hospitals
promptly Instead of organization for field
service, ' their time being occupied and their
energies spent in endeavoring to procure
the necessry men by enlistment or trans

GENERAL HOSPITALS.
Up to September 20 eleven general hos
pitals were established and fully manned
and equipped. These had a capacity of
nearly 7000 beds. At the same time cer
tain post hospitals having good accommo
dations were used for the treatment of
army cases generally, without alteration,
: of their official status as post hospital?.
My report presents tabulations compiled
from monthly reports of sick and wound
ed received from May to September, in
clusive and representing a strength* pres
sent of 167,168 men. These give full partic
ulars. There were 1715 deaths, of which
number 640 were occasioned by typhoid
fever 97 by malarial fevers and 393 by
diarrhoea and dysentery. The death rates
for May and June, .46 and .70, were not
in excess of those of the army in time or
peace. In July the rate became some
what higher than that, of most well-cared
for cities. 2.15 per month, or the equiva
lent of an annual rate of 25.80 per thou
sand living. In August it became exces
sive 4.08, equal to an annual rate or 4*.9Â«
per thousand. In September the influence
of measures taken in July and August. to
improve the health of the army becomes
manifest in the falling of the death rate
to 2.45, or the equivalent of an annual rate
of 29.40. The same progression to an,
acme in August, with a sudden fall in
September, in various ratios are given
under the specific titles, typhoid fever,
malarial fever and diarrhoea and kindred
diseases.- This is exceedingly gratifying
and must be credited, as stated, to the
sanitary measures adopted, for our expe
rience In the vivil war demonstrates that
in the absence of these measures the high
ratio of August would have been contin
ued for many months to come. From ta
bles of absolute numbers and of ratios by
which the incidents of sickness and rnor*
tallty of the regular troops and volunteer
troops may be contrasted, it will be seen
that the exposures of the regular troops
in the Santiago campaign gave them from
June to September a higher death rate
than the volunteers and that the rate of
the latter for August, the month of max
imum mortality, was 3.62, as compared
with 5 S3 among the regular troops.
VOLUNTEER RELIEF WORK.
Mv guiding principle throughout tho
war has been that relief, wnen needed,
should be promptly accepted without ref
erence to the source from which it came.
The relief afforded by the National Red
Cross at Siboney was promptly accepted
by the surgeons on the spot, but it is evi
dent that it was entirely inadequate to meet
the emergency. This association has had
full authority to send agents and sup
plies of various kinds in a most liberal
manner for the use of our veld hospitals.
Other organizations which have rendered
very valuable service are the National
Relief Commission, having its headquar
ters in Philadelphia, and the Massachu
setts Volunteer Aid Association, with
headquarters in Boston. Both of these
organizations fitted out hospital ships,
which were placed at my service for
transportation of our sick from Porto
Rico, and I take pleasure in tetifying to
the valuable services rendered by the
yacht May of the National Relief Com
mission and the hospital ship Bay State
of the Massachusetts Volunteer Aid As
sociation.
THE MEDICAL CORPS.
Before concluding my report of the op
erations of the Medical Department dur
ing our short and glorious war with
Spain, I feel it my duty to call special at
tention to the efficient services rendered
by the medical officers of the army in the
various responsible positions which the
exigencies of the service have made it
necessary for them to fill.

Strange Chapters in the iptMell
History of tlie Ruinefl
Institutions.
W. H. EasH Held. lie Bankers lii Boiastic Flat
tery â William Jeiinp's Sycopliancy
Meant a Living.
The letters of Dr William Jenningson
form one of ihe darkest chapters in
the history of the Pacific Ban.: and the
People's Home Savings Bank. Jen
son was the paid spy, sneak and
phant of R. H. McDonald Jr. F>>r
jears the young banker had this man
Lphorlcally on all fours, to kick
when he pleased, to abuse when the
inclination came to him and to use for
any contemptible purpose that Dick
found necessary to the success of his
plots and plans. Jenningson was
â d and despised by the other con
spirators who had surrounded the Mc-
Donalds. He was ready to resort to
any meanness and was barred from
any of the secret conferences when
ever the other schemers could do so.
During the existence of the banks he
;ed all over this State, pretending
ik into the affairs of the disas
trous schemes in which the young Mc-
Donalds had been made the victims.
Jenningson went to San Diego to
stick his official nose with more than
official arrogance into the accounts of
Cable Railroad and the
Bank, two concerns which
: he McDonalds a great deal of
y. Jennin~<=on's own written ree
f these visits would be interest
nly to those that are amused or
â¢'d at an exhibition of nanseat
attery. They form no legitimate
or material element in the history of
rents that ruined the Pacific
Bank and dragged down the People's
... Jennin- a did nothing to as
sist the McDonalds and very much to
injure them in his officious misconduct
of the affairs intrusted to him. He was
ally a parasite and attached
himself to the McDonalds in order that
lie might earn an easy living. He went
to Riverside and wrote Dick McDon
ald reams of nonsense telling what he
intended to do in reference to the af
fairs f<n..i desperate condition of the
Riverside Banking Company.
The only material outcome of his
visit to Riverside was to throw Miss E.
< . Dyer, the cashier, into hysterics
whenever his gaunt form darkened the
threshold of her bank. Whenever
Jenningson felt that he had not yet
tided to a depth of sycophancy
great enough to retain the favor of his
â r he sank to a lower depth. This
always had the desired effect and
brought Jenningson his expected re
ward.
DR. W. JENNINGSON'S PROFITLESS
JOURNEY TO LONDON.
He was sent on to London to secure
loans and wrote copiously to his master
scriptlon >>f his introduction to
swell clubs, of his invitation to swell
dinners and his association with the
financial aristocracy of thÂ« great capi
tal, but he said not a word of results
accomplished. Then he went to Liv
erpool and finally returned to New
York to come under the scrutinizing
distrust of Dr. it. H. McDonald.
For many months in the latter part
of 1892. Dr. Jenningson remained in
Xew York, a hated interloper in the
camp of the conspirators. He very
frankly wrote in one of his letters that
everybody hated him and he was glad
of it. He said they looked upon him as
the spy of Dick McDonald and he was
proud of It. He knew that as stool
pigeon and sneak he had gone to New
York t. spy upon the other conspira
tors, and he very frankly admitted that
he was in love with the task. It made
no difference to him what others
thought of him, he said; he intended to
keep his promise to Dick, no matter
how far he was misunderstood.
After residing In New York for some
time Jenningson returned to this city,
and then was detailed to pry into other
affairs in which Dick McDonald was
interested. The young banker sent his
factotum to Amador County to look
into another disastrous Investment
there. Then he came back / tcf annoy
the corspirato .-; in the Californlan Il
lustrated Magazine, the San Francisco
Printing Company and the Panorama
Company. AH the while Jenningson was
inflating his master with adulation.
This clown performance kept up month
after month. When Jenningson had
nothing else to write, and he was in
duty bound to write to Dick every day,
Sundays and holidays included, he
roasted everybody that enjoyed the
confidence of the McDonalds. On one
day it would be Sherman upon whose
devoted head Jenningson would pour
hip abuse.
Then it would be Dyer or Johns or
any other of a dozen men Interested in
the banks.
THE WILD PERAMBULATIONS OF A
PARASITE.
While in Riverside, in the early part
of 1893, Jenningson referred casually,
in one of his letters, to a visit of Col
lis P. Huntington and William H. Mills.
Jenningson saw in this visit a promise
that Huntington intended to buy the
Riverside motor road. A few days
later Jqnningnon was off to Sacramento,
supposedly to take part in the scheme
to divide Fresno County and create
Madera County. The McDonalds had
placed a formidable lobby at the Capi
tol to secure this division, and Jenning
son went there as usual to sâ on the
agents of his employer. He did this
with his customary Bervllity. In March,
1893, he was down at the John Brown
i colony and wrote Dick that he would
i do his best to Btop the plundering that
, was unquestionably going on at the
colony.
Occasionally he would stab Sherman
' again and caution Dick to beware of
' the J..OS Angeles Bchemer. One of his
i letters, written in I^os Angeles on
March "1. 1893. is characteristic. Hede
clares he has discovered a great com
bination on the part of Sherman and
Johns to rob the bai.k. "I have been
working to got the inside of what I
think is a combination," he wrc-te. "It
has been hard work, but believe I am
more than a match for them all. Dorns
will be speaking in my favor; well, pre
tend to take it a'l in. Also Sherman,
who will do the same thing, I think;
well, also take that in. It is a very
brilliant crowd and they believe I am
on to them â so I am. It is the best
course for the present to- pretend to be
lieve all they say. The trees, olives,
cost Joh^s $400 and no more. Pay
nothing of that nature till I arrive. The
$2500 you may have to put up to hold
motor interest. That is all right, but
send around to Housrhtc.-n's office and
pay only when you have to do so, when
you have to protect your interests. Give
nothing away to Sherman, for he will
likely inform a certain party, of whom
I have something to say when I
you. Be friendly with Dyer; it Js good
policy. Make something of him should
he arrive before I do; also good policy.
But give up nothing without the coin."
Once in a very great while Jenning-
Bon would write a letter of material in
terest.
JENNINGSON PROBES INTO THE AF
FAIRS OF THE JOHN BROWN COLONY.
In May, IS!*3, a month and a half be
fore the bank collapsed, Jenningson
was at the John Brown colony to re
port the condition of affairs there. He
declared that A. F. Johns was not act
ing fairly with the McDonalds, and
that young Johns had threatened to
come to San Francisco and punch the
head off Dick. The elder Johns, so Jen
ningson declared, was attempting to
divert from the Pacific Bank a very
great deal of valuable property.
This information was not new, and
as Jenningson did not possess a speak
ing acquaintance with the English
language the story may be better told
in the letters of one of the other con
spirators. When Dick McDonald had
no very pressing need of the services
of Dr. Jenningson, the spy was sent to
look after the personal affairs of Dick's
associates. Jenningson understood his
duty thorou~hly and slandered most
shamefully every one that Dick did not
like. It would be idle to reproduce this
slander, as it has no possible bearing
on the great events that culminated in
the ruin of the Pacific Bank. Jenning
son succeeded in keeping his hold upon
Dick McDonald long after both banks
failed. He was ready to do anything
hi? master dictated, and when Dick,
finding himself thrown out of the Pa- I
rifle Bank, landed in the People's
I'-ik, he discovered that Dr. William
Jenningson was still on his back. The
part that this man played in the secret
history of the two institutions forms a
disagreeable chapter but an essential
one to illustrate the character of the
men that R. K. McDonald and his two
sons drew around them.
EASTLAND WAS THE CRAFTY CLOWN
OF THE CONSPIRACY.
W. H. Eastland was the clown of the
conspiracy that destroyed the Pacific
Bank. He was as base as Dr. W. Jen
ningeon in his sycophancy, but far
more ridiculous in displaying it. His
flattery almost passes belief. He vied
with Jenningson in disgusting adula
tion and surpassed him in craft. While
Jenningson sought simply a livelihood
In exchange for his servility Eastland
schemed to win a fortune from the Mc-
Donalds. He was the president of a
boerus corporation known as the Alaska
Coal Company. In all their history the
McDonalds never entered into a more
dishonest transaction than that which
this Alaska Coal Company represented.
The mines of the company were sup
posed to be located at Coal Bay, Cooks
Inlet. The stock of the company was
floated in enormous quantities with an
alluring rate of interest, and was guar
anteed by the Pacific Bank through
the stupidity of Frank McDonald.
As a matter of fact the Alaska Coal
Company had a reality only on paper.
The corporation did not own a coai
mine or anything like one. It waa a
fraud in every aspect, and Eastland,
who thoroughly understood the fact,'
was willing to do anything for the
money of the McDonalds. He entered
the service of Dick McDonald as an
abject syco-hant read" and eager to
do anything his master commanded.
No task was too base for him to re
fuse, and while he wormed his way
into the confidence of Dick he foisted
his utterly worthless stock on the Pa
cific Bank. It was not until November,
1892, that Eastland left the control of
the Alaska Joal Company to his
brother, and devoted his own enprgies
exclusively to the personal service of
Dick McDonald.
EASTLAND CREATED HIMSELF A LIEU
TENANT GENERAL AND BEGINS
THE WAR.
In this service Eastland went to New
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 21, 1898.
OR. W. JENNINGSON, THE SPY OF THE MCDONALDS.
During the later days of the Pacific Bank it was the policy of the McDonalds to
employ men to spy upon eac.i other. The young bankers under no circum
stances would trust even their own confidential agents. Among the spies
employed by the bankers none wils more serviceable or more despicable or
more ready to perform any service commanded of him than Dr. William
Jenningson. .
York to act as Dick's spy, and in a very
large measure to supersede Dr. Jen
ningson in that capacity. It was East
land's privilege to call Dick McDonald
every name that the tongue of flattery
could command. In the words of the
cunning sycophant Dick was the great
Napoleon of the American financial
world. He was the man chosen by
birth, education and ability to govern
the great affairs of finance in this coun
try. He was everything that was in
spiring and magnificent In the rising
generation. There was no praise too
extravagant for Eastland to ignore.
When Eastland went to New York the
situation of the Pacific Bank was ex
tremely desperate. Dick had been in
frantic seach for money for months.
and h^ could obtain absolutely no as
sistance from New York. Agent after
agent had been sent on but without re
sult, and finally Eastland was scurried
across the continent to take charge of
the situation.
He describes his arrival in New
York as the coming of a general to
command and organize the routed and
defeated forces of his superior. He
wrote Dick that he had arrived on the
field and had organized the army of
workers for immediate action. He pro
ceeded at once to adjust the situation,
to assign each worker an allotted and
congenial task, and to direct himself
the energies of each. Day after day he
wrote Dick pages of bombastic non
sense. Now he would sign himself W.
H. Eastland, commanding, and again
he was in the field a lieutenant gener
al, eager to solve the position of the en
emy, and all the while he wrote to
Dick telling him that the strong arm
of the young Napoleon of finance was
holding him up and urging him on to
victory. Occasionally he would inform
this young Napoleon that he had sold
another block of the stock of the
Alaska Coal Company, which the Pa
cific Bank promised to guarantee.
EASTLAND'S FLATTERY WAS TRANS
FORMED INTO GOLD.
Once in a while Dick would become
nervous and restless, and would de
mand of Eastland that he reduce his
enormous overdraft upon the books of
the Pacific Bank. But Eastland was
wily; he wanted to increase, not de
crease, his overdraft, and his flattery
won him his wish. After Eastland had
been in New York for a little while he
was In full collusion with Sherman,
Dyer, Johns and the other conspir
tors. He would intersperse his flattery
of Dick and his praise of himself with
absurd encomiums upon his confeder
ates. He maintained this ridiculous
but crafty position for many months.
In the latter part of November 1892,
when the situation of Dick McDonald
In this city was becoming daily more
desperate, Eastland assured his master
that already he could hear the shouts
of victory and see the heralds of a
splendid triumph. He was lying bom
bastically.
Dick's forces in New York, he de
clared, understood the wisdom of eter
nal vigilance, and were giving blow
for blow in the battle for financial ex
istence. This military absurdity is
one of the few amusing side lights in
the tragedy that ended in ruin. When
Eastland had nothin% elee to write and
his military vocabulary had exhausted
itself, he told Dick that he would read
and re-read the Young Napoleon's ef
fusions to gain new strength and new
fortitude for another conflict. These
letters were usually followed by an
other demand for money.
A SCHEME TO ROB THE PEOPLE'S BANK
OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND
DOLLARS.
Occasionally Eastland would inter
rupt his flow of flattery to tell himself
how able and honest he was. Under
standing thoroughly the appalling dis
honesty of the McDonalds and their
confederates, Eastland in one of his
letters suggested a scheme by which
the People's Home Savings Bank could
be robbed further to the extent of $200,
000 to save the Pacific Bank from the
crushing burden of O. T. Dyer and his
Riverside Institution. Eastland wrote
| his letter on December 19. 1892. The
i epistle, in part, is as follows:
"The matter is in reference to a set
tlement of O. T. Dyer and his banking
institution. The matter as submitted
to me is this: Dyer is to give mort
; gages upon real estate that will be
| accepted by the People's Home Savings
i Bank, upon which they will advance to
I the Pacific Bank $200,000. This amount
is to go to the credit of Dyer's bank in
part payment of its indebtedness to the
Pacific Bank, and Dyer and his bank
are to turn over to the Pacific Bank
such other solvent and acceptable se
curities in an amount sufficient to se
cure and protect and satisfy the Paci
fic Bank's management in the remain
ing indebtedness of the Riverside
Banking Company and O. T. Dyer, col
lectively and individually. Of course, in
all these matters I submit to your
splendid financial abilities and your
high conception of commercial transac
tions."
This scheme was one of many dis
cussed by the conspirators to reb the
People's Bank. Eastland, as already
indicated, was used by Dick McDonald
for any purpose. Shortly after the
election of President Cleveland in No
vember, 1892, Dick McDonald commis
sioned Eastland to wait on the Presi
dent of the United States and invite
him to a banquet in San Francisco.
Eastland accepted the commission in
all seriousness. In accepting it he
wrote: "I have talked with your good
father, and I can see now that you will
be one of the great young financiers of
the times." A few days later Eastland
informed Dick that he had sold 2000
shares of the Alaska Coal Company,
which the "great young financier" in
dorsed and guaranteed.
THE CRAFTY FLATTERER FORGOT HIM
SELF AND TOLD THE TRUTH.
Eastland occasionally seemed to for
get himself and tell the truth. In one
letter he candidly informed Dick that
Eastern capitalists and financiers did
not want Western securities for pur
poses of speculation. These men were
very well informed on the character of
the McDonald stocks and bonds, and
certainly did not want them for pur
poses of investment. In 1893 speculators
were very wary and had been during
all the months that the wreckers of the
McDonald banks had been in New
York. Eastland, therefore, was one of
the very few men who told Dick Mc-
Donald the truth, and yet almost within
a week after he told the deluded banker
that, he had a scheme by which one
syndicate would buy all the Pacific
Bank securities for one million dollars.
The syndicate, as a matter of course,
was a myth. About two months before
the Pacific Bank failed Eastland gave
R. H. McDonald Jr. an intimation of
the manipulation of A. F. Johns and
Thomas Fitch Jr. in reference to the
John Brown colony. Eastland was not
In a position to be well informed, and
even the information he did give was
unheeded. During his stay In New
York Eastland attended to many of the
private affairs of R. H. McDonald Jr.,
giving particular attention to the di
vorced wife and child of the young
banker. McDonald had tried many
ways to secure possession of this child,
but failed, and Eastland played upon
this fact to prolong his useless stay in
New York. As a whole Eastland cut
no more serious figure in the affairs of
the bank than to secure from it a for
tune for the Alaska Coal Company and
his own personal maintenance and
recreation in the Eastern States. He
was purely and simply a parasite, who
received thousands of dollars of the
funds of the Pacific Bank in exchange
for his crafty and disgusting flattery
to R. H. McDonald Jr.
The Call will exploit to-morrow
morning another of the great dishonest
transactions in which . some of the
manipulators of the Pacific Bank in
volved themselves to gain the money
in the treasury of the institution. In
this recital the alleged bribery and cor-,
ruption of public officials and the dis
honesty of the attorneys will form a
very considerable part. The Call will
show that some of the -great conspira
tors of the bank assumed to possess the
ability to bribe even the courts of this
State and to protect themselves from
the consequences of their . nefarious
acj*6n.

THE BULLET
HAS BEEN
LOCATED
Durie Heithier's Re
covery Is Assured.
SHE CONTINUES TO IMPROVE
DEADLY MISSILE WILL NOT BE
REMOVED JUST YET.
Unless an Unexpected Relapse Oc
curs the Would-Be Suicide Will
Go Home in Four
Weeks.
Durle Heithier will undoubtedly recover
from the self-inflicted bullet wound which
sent her to the hospital and exposed the
; perfidy of George A. Alexander, her brutal
i betrayer. Dr. Weil of the Receiving Hos
j pital, who is attending the wounded girl,
' has every hope for her speedy convales
! ence.
Yesterday Dr. Weil succeeded in loeat
i ing the bullet. It is Imaged in the back,
I just below the scapula on the left side.
j The ball is not very deep in the tissues, as
i it can be easily folt. The doctor says there
; U no necessity for removing the bullet for
j some time, as it is not causing any in
! fiammation. In a week or two, when Durie
i has regained strength an incision will be
j made and the bullet removed. Unless the
' girl has a severe and unexpected relapse
she will undoubtedly be able to go home
in three or four weeks. She has a consld
i erable amount of reserve strength and has
( ontinued to improve since being re
! moved to the German Hospital. She still
! euffers considerably, but the pains from
i her wound are Intermittent and less se-
I vere than they were a day or two ago.
She is becoming very peevish and irri
table, which the doctors consider a favor
j able symptom. She ha 3 become very
; domineering and orders her faithful moth
er about as though she was a paid nurse.
Lsut the gentle, loving heart of the mother
does not revolt at this. She knows her
child is getting well, and she is happy
once more. Duries every wish is grati
fied, no matter how childish or'unreason
able.
â¢The mother will need financial assist
ance before Durie is strong enough to be
taken home. The expenses at the hospital
are very heavy for the limited means of
the poor woman who nearly lost her first
born, and she has no reserve resources to
draw upon.
THE SALE OF ORMONDE
YEARLINGS TO-NIGHT
ARISTOCRATIC FILLIES THAT
SHOULD BRING LONG PRICES.
Party of Horsemen Visit the Spreck

Opinion â To-Day 's
Entries.
The Killip & Co. sale of the aristocrat
ically bred Ormonde fillies, which takes
place at their salesyard. Market street
and Van Ness avenue, to-night, is attract
ing widespread attention among horse
men, both here and in the East. The five
young misses by this world-famous horse
are pronounced flawless by experts, and
their looks certainly bear out this asser
tion. The star of the sale, it is said, will
be Orthia, a slashing chestnut filly by
Ormonde from the Wlldldle mare, Muta.
She shows class all over, and the fortu
nate possessor of her will probably have
to. bid well up in the thousands. Gold
Lnee, Rose of Ormnnde, Oremus and
Oriva are not lacking in appearance, and
will undoubtedly bring large prices. The
sale will commence promptly at 7 o'clock.
A party of horsemen, chaperoned by
Harry Lowden, among which were Enoch
Wishard and Galen Brown, visited the
Spreckels stock farm at Napa yesterday.
Mrs. Wlshard, an enthusiastic admirer
of the thoroughbred, accompanied her
husband. Mr. Wishard, who is consider
ed one of the keenest horsemen in the
business, carefully inspected the stallions,
broodmares, yearlings and weanlings and
was much impressed with the workings of
this ideal breeding establishment. After
carefully looking over the yearlings short

Larceny in the Prison.
Thomas Jordan, a colored peddler, was
in the "drunk" cell at the City Prison
yesterday morning when John Terrell be
came one of his companions. Terrell was
arrested on Sixth street and was so fight
ing drunk that he had to be clubbed Into
submission by the arresting officer. About
11 o'clock Terrell complained that a ring
had been stolen from nls finger and sus
picion pointed to Jordan. He was taken
out of the cell and searched and the rinsr
was found in his pocket. He was booked
on the charge of grand larceny.

RULES TO BE OBSERVED
TRAINED GRADUATES ESPECI
ALLY DESIRED.
Change of Front of the War De
partment in Regard to
the of the
Sick.
A circular which has just been issued
from the surgeon general's office of the
War Department at Washington is im
portant, inasmuch as it shows the Inten
tion of the department to place the fe
male nurses in the employ of the Govern
ment on a proper footing, and provides
for the application and appointment of
volunteer nurses. In this connection Anita
Newcomb McGee, acting assistant sur
geon, I*. S. A., has issued a communica
tion stating that applications from "grad
uate trained nurses willing- to leave the
former limits of the United States" are
especially desired. A number have been
sent to Honolulu, and others may be or
dered to Manila whenever the surgeon in
command there finds their services to be
needed. Applicants will also be consid
ered who uo not wish to go across the
water.
The circular which Is so different in tone
from the breezy refusal Of the services
of the Red Cross nurses at the beginning
of the war is:
War Department, Surgeon General's Ofiice,
WASHINGTON, Nov. 4, 1888.
As it Is desirable that the employment of
femule nurses with the army should be placed
on an exact and uniform basis, the following
instructions are published tor the guidance oi
medical oiticers:
When the services of female trained nurses
are required at a hospital, application should
be maue to this office. They will be supplied
by transfer or from the list of eligible appli
cants. Authority to make contracts, hereto
fore given in certain emergency cases, is here
by revoked, and it is not desired that the
services of volunteer nurses be accepted.
Officers having more nurses than are needed
will annul contracts ot unsatisfactory ones
only, and report to this office without delay the
number of desirable nurses available for trans
fer.
Every change in the status of female nurses,
such aa arrival, departure, discharge or death,
should be reported by information slip on the
day of its occurrence.
GEORGE M. STER.NBEKG,
SurgeÂ«n General, United States Army.
Another circular deals with ihe infor- |
mation fur female contract nurses in the j
United States army. The contract which |
is made by -the surgeon general with a
female nurse for army service is for an j
unlimited period, and she receives $30 v
month salary. While nursing at the ho^- j
pital she receives also her lodging, board j
and laundry of uniforms. .No unilorm |
has yet been prescribed. The surgeon j
general may, at the request of a hospital |
surgeon, appoint a chief nurse, who shall j
supervise the other nurses, but is not to j
undertake nursing herself. A nui>. is
subject to military discipline, and when
traveling under orders will be furnished
with transportation. In case of sickness
contracted in the line of duty a nurse is
entitled to medical attendance at the I
nearest army hospital. Should she prefer j
to return home the surgeon may grant a I
sick leave, with pay for thirty days.
Nurses who go to Porto Rico or Cuba are
expected to remain at leaat six months, if
their services are satisfactory. The con
tract of a nurse may be annulled at any
time by the surgeon general.
In making application a nurse Is fur- I
nished with a blank on which she is to
answer several questions in relation to |
her qualifications, health, experience and i
whether graduated or not. With this she j
must forward the Indorsement of the lady [
who is (or was when she graduated) the
superintendent of her training school. All
applications should be made directly to
the office of the surgeon general. Wash- I

SCANDAL BEING PROBED.
Police Will Lay the Becker-Creegan
Case Before the Grand Jury.
The promised scandal involving the jury
which disagreed in the second trial of the
Becker-Creegan forgery case is gradually
developing. Detective Pinkerton and Chief
Lees are devoting all their skill to un
raveling the mystery which surrounds the
actions of certain jurors. These officers
will not tell who they suspect of embrac
ery; they simply say they are investigating
and at the proper time the result of their
work will be laid before the Grand Jury.
Mr. Pinkerton is positive he can produce
sufficient evidence to warrant the Grand
Jury in making a searching investigation.
He does not intend to move, however, un
til he has accumulated Indubitable proof
that a sinister influence was brought to
bear to secure a disagreement of the jury.
The Becker-Creegan case will be called
again this morning in Judge Wallaces
court. This will be the third trial of the
defendants, who are accused of uttering a
forged draft for $22,000 on the Nevada
Bank. Attorneys Dunne and McPike, it
is understood, intend to demand that the
case be transferred to some other court
than Judge Wallace's. They will present
affidavits to substantiate their contention
that a fair trial cannot be secured before
a judge who has twice heard the testi
mony. This move is thought by the prose
cution to be an attempt to obtain a delay
and will be strenuously opposed by the
District Attorney.
AT THE PABK AND CLIFF.
Cailly Weather Drove the Crowds
Home at an Early Hour.
Anticipating a pleasant day thousands
of people left their homes yesterday and
gathered at the Park and Cliff. From
noon until 3 o'clock crowds poured into
the big pleasure ground and listened to
the music and enjoyed the flowers, while
others turned their way toward the ocean.
At the later hour, however, it turned sud
denly cold, so cold, in fact, that there was
no enjoyment in the open air, and the
people hastened home. No accidents oc
curred during the day.
The usual big crowd spent the day at
the Chutes. .The "three missing links,"
Sally, Joe and Congo, were patronized by
large numbers, but the many other attrac
tions were not neglected.
The aquatic sports at Sutro's Baths
were witnessed by hundreds of enthusi
asts, who found unlimited enjoyment in
the athletic contests in the big and little
tanks. Following are the results:

UTAH SENDS
A POLYGAMIST
TO CONGRESS
Brigham H. Roberts
May Be Unseated.
OPENLY DEFIES THE LAW
SAID TO MAINTAIN THREE
HOUSEHOLDS.
Has Served a Term in the Peniten
tiary Because of His Violation
of the Federal
Statutes. i
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALT LAKE, Nov. 20.â Brigham
H. Roberts, the Mormon Con
gressman-elect in Utah, will have
i to tight for his seat in the House of
] Representatives. When Congress as
sembles in December and contested
j election cases are given consideration
it is likely that his will be among the
first to come up. Roberts is fanatical
1 in his belief in the Mormon faith, and
I it is charged by his political opponents
â¢ that he has been living in polygamy in
! open defiance of the Federal statutes
since Utah became a State. The de
feated candidate for Congress in his
I district will rely on this fact In his ef
; fort to gain the seat won by Roberts
j in the election, and he claims to have
; an abundance of evidence to back up
! his claim.
Should the contest be brought, as now
! seems certain, it is probable that when
', Congress assembles an inquiry into the
i domestic life of Roberts will be insti
; tuted. This move is quite likely to
! have the support of the Republican
majority, which will in uns u^se
be simply upholding the Federal con
stitution. It will establish the prece
dent once and for all that a polygamist
shall not hold a place in the councils
| of the nation.
That Brigham H. Roberts is an active
polygamist is beyond the shadow of a.
j doubt. He was charged with it by the
Salt Lake Tribune during the late cam
paign and he never denied it, merely
saying his family relations were not
[an issue. Roberts was a polygamist
! long before the passage of the mani
! lesto by the Aiormon church and the
subsequent admission of Utah to state
j hood. That children have been born to
I his polygamous wives tince Utah was
' admitted to statehood is well known in
I that State. .No attempt was made by
! any of the leading Democrats to dis
prove it.
Roberts has three wives. He lives at
Centeivule, a short distance north of
Salt Lake. Two of his wives live in
that village, the other in Salt Lake. He
'is a fanatical Jiormon. Two years agtr
| he ran for Congress against tne wishes
j and without the consent of the Mormon
I leaders, by whom he was disciplined.
He fought the church, but finally suc
i cumbed to its demands. He was for a
short time engaged on the Sail Lake
Herald, and it was in. that office that
he was first arrested for polygamy. He
gave bonds and lied to Kurope. Three
years later he returned and was sen
tenced to a term in the penitentiary,
which he served. It was after this that
he married a third wife, by whom he
has no children.
Leading Democrats in Utah now ad
mit they made a mistake in nominating
Roberts and some have grave doubts
as to his being seated.
California delegates to Congress are
a unit in the expression of their inten
tion to assist in enforcing the Federal
statute relating to polygamy. Though
the representatives from this State
were guarded in their utterances as to
the particular case in question they
were of the belief that one who prac
ticed polygamy in defiance of the laws
of the nation should not have a seat
in its councils. Judge James G. Ma
guire said in an Interview yesterday:
"I certainly am in favor of uphold
ing the provision of the Federal statute
directed against polygamy. Where lh>
law of the country is violated there is
but one course for a national lawmaker
to pursue. As to the case of Mr. Rob
erts, I am not sufficiently informed to
express an opinion, and do not care to
state whether I shall make a personal
Inquiry into his domestic relations."
ROBERTS MAY~BE UNSEATED.
NEW YORK, Nov. 20.â The Herald
will say to-morrow: Although no no
tice of contest has yet been filed mem
bers-elect of the next House of Rep
resentatives are already discussing
whether Brigham H. Roberts, just
elected from Utah, shall be permitted
to retain his seat. During the cam
paign it was charged that he had
three wives and had practiced polyg
amy since Utah was admitted to the
Union, although the Territory was cre
ated a State on the express pledge that
polygamy should be prohibited. The
only ground for the contest is on the
question of polygamy. Aside from that
Mr. Roberts' claim to the seat seems to
rest on solid ground.
In order to ascertain the views of
members of the House, who will have
to vote on the question, the Herald
instructed its correspondents in many
States to interview members-elect o-n
this subject. Strong views against
polygamy were expressed by many of
the members, and some of them openly
declared that they would vote to un
seat the Representative from Utah.
That there are two sides to the ques
tion is shown by the fact that some of
the members defend Mr. Roberts' right
to be seated, while leading members of
.each party decline to give any opinion
Vvithout more thoroughly investigating
the case. _______________
AGE LIMIT INCBEASED.

recommandation of Captain Dickens. Sec
retary Long has increased the age re
quirement in the case of apprentices ad
mitted to the naval service from 14 to 15

OUR COMMERCIAL STANDING.
AT present there are no indications that the im
provement in trade due to the result of the
fall elections is on the wane. On the con
trary, as far as can be judged by the country's bank
clearings, it is increasing. These clearings last week
were 3;. 2 per cent larger than those of the cor
responding week last year, and the only important
city to show a decrease was Buffalo. The increase in
business in New York was 50.6 per cert, in Boston
_>47 per cent, in Chicago 8.9 per cent, in St. Louis
.-co. per cent, in Pittsburg 26 per cent, in Omaha 30
per cent, in Kansas City 29.6 per cent, in Denver 514
per cent, and so on. all over the country. The re
turns show that all sections of the nation are leading
1897 in the volume of business. The failures for the
week were 233, against 267 during the same week last
year. . ...
At the same time there is no boom in anything.
The staples remain quiet as a rule, and there is no
particular disposition to speculate. There have been
heavy sales of bonded wool for re-export to England,
which is a good sign, as it may indicate the turning of
the tide in the wool industry. Cotton is doing rather
better, in sympathy with an improving tone in the
goods market. The exports of breadstuffs from the
Atlantic coast are large, owing to a constant foreign
demand. The call for iron seems to be growing,
though some Eastern mills report a shortage in
orders. The leading groceries are showing more
strength, and several have advanced slightly. The
distribution of merchandise shows little chancre, but
collections are reported better on back business.
Wall street was quieter last week, and there was
none of the excitement that characterized the pre
ceding week. But it was noticed that any concessions
in price immediately brought out large buying or
ders, showing a strong undercurrent to the market.
Early in the week the New York money market
hardened somewhat, but this was only momentary, as
it was soon discovered that any pronounced strin
gency would result in a free influx of gold, not only
from the interior of the country, but from Europe.
In this latter connection the enormous imports of
gold from foreign countries are particularly interest
ing. The October statement of the Treasury Bureau
of Statistics, just issued, shows that the imports in
1898 are the largest in the history of the country,
while the exports are the smallest for many years.
The imports of gold during the first ten months of
the year were $143,658,000, which is more than 50
per cent larger than in any previous year. The ex
ports were only $14,061,000, which leaves an excess
o* imports of $129,506,000, which is enormous. It is
only two or three years back when the situation in
regard to the gold movement was just the other way.
The total money in circulation November I was
$1,866,575,000, against $1,706,733,000 on the cor
responding date in 1897. The increase in circulation
during the last two years foots up $356,850.000.
In California the week shows some changes, among
which the breaking up of the long dry speH by Sat
urday's rain is the most prominent. The protracted
drought was causing some alarm, especially as the
scientists were freely predicting another dry season.
The State needs two or three inches of rain to put
it into good spirits, and if we get it the change from
npathy to activity will be marked. Already the live
stock market was beginning to harden under the
growing shortage in feed, and higher prices for beef,
veal, mutton and pork were reported. The rainfall
was not sufficient, up to Saturday, to affect the dif
ferent markets one way or the other, the average be
ing about .25 of an inch for the northern half of the
State and practically nil for the southern half. Still,
it was an opening wedge, and as such had its effect.
The local staples were rather steadier as a rule last
week. While there was nothing doing in wool, the
feeling was better, owing to the improvement al
ready noted in the East. The grain markets were un
settled, with a fair demand for most descriptions.
The tendency in dairy products was upward. Hides
were quiet and easy. Fruits, fresh and dried, were

A FOOLISH POLICY.
|~> E CAUSE the country is now prosperous, the
D treasury of the nation overflowing, gold com
ing into the channels of trade from Europe in
a steady stream, and our finances in good condition,
some Republican newspapers have declared that no
change in our currency is needed, and that the com
ing Congress should make no attempt at currency
reform in any direction whatever.
To this policy of leaving the currency alone its
advocates give the name of "a wise conservatism."
It is. however, no wiser than that of the Arkansas
settler who would not repair the roof of his shanty
when the rain was falling because he did not like to
get wet, nor when the sun was shining because then
the roof did not leak and repairs were unnecessary.
That our currency system is ill devised and inade
quate to the stress of bad times is beyond dispute,
and the only question is whether we shall reform it
while times are good and the reform can be made
without injury to any interest, or whether we shall
wait until another financial storm comes and then un
dertake the work in the midst of popular panic and
industrial disturbance.
At the present outlook all the conditions of the
time promise to be most favorable to a thorough re
j vision of the currency by the Congress which has just
I been elected. When it meets all the branches of the
j Government will be under Republican control, and
'it will be possible to enact a reform bill without re
sorting to any compromises with fiat money or free
silver factions for the purpose of assuring its passage.
If the opportunity is permitted to pass unused there
is danger that one so favorable may not return again
for many years.
One of the arguments of the opponents of reform
is that the money question has been settled by the
elections and is no longer an issue. This is a curious
illustration of how easy it is to arrive at erroneous
conclusions by misconstruing phrases. The currency
question was settled by the elections so far as the peo
ple are concerned because by their votes they elected
a Republican Congress to solve it. If, however, Con
gress refuses to do anything about it, the question
will remain open at the next election.
As a matter of fact the issue was never more vital
than at present. It was more potent than any other
slnp!e factor in determining the votes at the rece/it
election of the great mass of independent voters
throughout the Union. Large numbers of conserva
tive Democrats cast their ballots for Republican can
didates for the sole purpose of assuring a wise solu
tion of the currency problems, and if the Republicans
should now fail to accomplish anything in that direc
tion the party would forfeit the surport of many of
these conservative allies in 1900.
That the settlement of the issue will require no lit
tle political sagacity and courage goes without say
ing, but nothing will be gained by shirking its diffi
culties. We have just had a disastrous experience of
the results of shirking the silver issue. There should
be no further temporizing with political opportunists
and monetary 'cranks. The corning '.Congress is
pledged to currency reform, and it will be false to its
duty if it fails to fulfill the pledge.
CONSULAR SERVICE.
SO much adverse criticism has been pronounced
upon our consular service and the work of the
â men engaged in it. that when some good report
i- given of the results accomplished it is only fair at
tention should be directed to it. Such reports are by
no means uncommon in Europe, though they are rare
here. In fact, the merits of our consular system seem
to be better known abroad than at home.
A recent issue of the London Mail contained a re
view of the work achieved by our Consuls, and the
writer found the results attained to be so important
that he pronounces our Consuls to be "ambassadors
of commerce," or "commercial travelers for American
producers." Many instances are cited of what has
been done to advance the trade of our merchants in
European countries and to make a market for the
products of our farms as well as of our factories.
In fact, the traders of Europe have discovered that
the average American Consul is one of the most effi
cient workers to be found in the markets of the
world. They have felt the effects of his competition
and they know his value. He has been instrumental
in teaching the American producer how to find a way
irto the markets where Europe expected to be with
out a rival, and by his vigor and enterprise has man
aged to overcome the advantage which European
Consuls have over him by reason of their longer ser
vice and more elaborate training for consular duties.
Our system of choosing Consuls and making such
appointments subject to politics has many defects, but
it has also one advantage over the life service system.
The newly appointed Consul is on his best behavior
and puts forth his best energies. Like a new broom,
he sweeps clean. Permanency of tenure does not in
crease the activities of an official, and while the Euro
pean Consul, assured of his position virtually for life,
takes things easy, the American new comer knows he
must make a record in four years, and he works like
a beaver.
COMMERCIAL EXPANSION.
JINGO imperialists are much given to the asser
tion that the Philippines must be annexed in
order to provide for the expansion of our I
commerce. They would have the people believe that j
we can extend our trade only by force of arms, and \
that we must undertake the government of the mon
grel savages of the Philippines as a means of ob
taining among them a market for our products.
These assertions have a good deal of effect, upon a
considerable number of people, because commercial
expansion has become one of the great aspirations of
the nation. It is not an aspiration founded upon
sentiment merely, but an outcome of our industrial
development. Under the protective system we have
built up industries that produce far more than we
consume, and consequently it has become necessary
to find foreign markets for their products.
Under such circumstances whatever tends to ex
pand our commerce is attractive to the great mass of
the people. The annexationists understand the fact
very well, and are, therefore, eager to present their
scheme to the public under the guise of a policy of
commercial expansion. They ignore or evade all the
difficulties in which the nation woul^ be involved by
assuming responsibilities in the Orient, and devote
themselves to a clamorous iteration that the annexa
tion of the Philippines is a necessary preliminary to
Jhe upbuilding of our trade with Asia and the islands
of the Pacific.
The falseness of the claim is known to all who hava
any knowledge of the conditions under which trade
develops. The expansion of our commerce with
foreign countries has been going forward by leaps
and bounds for years past. Without burdening our
selves with colonial governments and foreign posses
sions we have increased our exports until they now
exceed those of any other nation. With the con
tinuance of peace and prosperity the increase will go
on with steady progression, while the annexation
policy, by involving us in complications that might
THE SAIST FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 21, 1898.
lead to war, would tend to check the increase rather
than to augment it.
The only safe way to provide for commercial ex
pansion is to continue to stand aloof from the wars
of the world so that our labor will not have to bear
the burdens that are imposed upon the workingmen
of Europe, and to provide by proper legislation for
the upbuilding of an American merchant marine
which will enable our sailors to carry the products
of our peaceful industry to all markets on equal terms
with any competitors.
We need an American merchant marine much
more than we need the Philippine Islands. Give to
our merchants a suitable means of carrying abroad the
products of our industries and we will have in the
Orient, as well as in all other parts of the world, a
trade which no people burdened with the expense of
huge armies and the maintenance of costly colonies
can take away from us.
STATE TREASURER GREEN in his report
to the Governor directs public attention once
more to the evil effects of the crude system we
now employ in handling the money collected by taxa
tion. As Mr. Green puts it: "California is still follow
ing the method of collecting money semi-annually from
the people and storing it up as old junk, when the
object and only object of money is circulation. We
also pay large sums of money for the transportation
of money to and from the treasury, which is a most
useless proceeding."
From the summary of the report which was given
! to the public in The Call yesterday it appears that
when the Treasurer entered upon the office last April,
1 just before a taxpaying time, there was in the
i vault of the treasury more than $2,967,000, and after
j the June settlements the sum stored in the vault ex
j ceeded $4,000,000.
It is no slight drawback to industry and trade to
! have so large a sum of money withdrawn from circu
j lation and locked up in idleness, but the loss of the use
I of the money is not the whole evil of the system. The
transportation of the money back and forth costs a
j great deal more to the taxpayers. Mr. Green says:
"I have no means of determining even approximately
the cost of transportation of money, but $15,000 per
month is a conservative estimate."
The report recommends a plan for remedying these
evils by the adoption of a system somewhat similar to
that employed in several of the Eastern States. In
the main it consists in the establishment of State
and county depositories, and lending the revenues
to banks upon the security of approved bonds of the
nation or State or of some county or municipality
within the State.
The subject is not a new_ one. The evils of the
present system have long been known, and remedies
have been suggested time and again. It is none the
less advisable to give the issue a reconsideration.
The plan proposed by the Treasurer may not be
feasible under existing conditions, or may not be ac
ceptable to the Legislature. It will serve a good pur
pose, however, even if it does no more than to revive
interest in the question and lead to some earnest effort
to provide a better system. It is certainly a folly for
an enlightened commonwealth to go on withdrawing
millions of money from the channels of trade and
storing it up like old junk.
SIR JOHN LUBBOCK is reported to have de
voted a considerable portion of a recent ad
dress at the opening of a public library in
; England to a consideration of the economic value of
libraries. He argued that those who object to the
maintenance of libraries on account of the expense
make a mistake even from their own point of view,
since by diminishing the tendency to crime, which is
always costly to a community, a well regulated public
library saves the taxpayers much more than it costs.
In a summary of the address that comes to us the
speaker is quoted as having said: "Ignorance costs
more than education. Victor Hugo well said that he
j who opened a school closed a prison. The same
1 might be said of a public library, which was the school
jof the grown-up. Statistics showed how much crime
and pauperism had diminished in late years. In Lon-
I don they had happily been able to close several
j prisons. Our paupers were still, of course, too
' numerous, but they were less than half the number
they had been in proportion to the population. In
! fact, our schools and libraries had been an investment,
! not an expense. Only a fraction of the crime of the
country arose from irresistible temptation or deliber
i ate wickedness; the great sources were drink and ig
! norance. Drink, again, was often due to dullness
i and the craving for excitement, which might to a
I great extent be gratified by the proper use of books."
The validity of the argument is not to be ques-
I tioned, and the application is as pertinent to California
I as to Great Britain. We maintain an elaborate system
â  of public education by which the youth of the State is
â  taught to read, but we have as yet made no adequate
provision for supplying the graduates of our schools
with books which will help them to continue their
education after they leave school. To a large extent
this is due to the sparsely settled condition of the
State. It is impossible to maintain public libraries
i in communities where the population is scant, and yet
j among such populations there may be many persons
; well fitted to make the highest and best use of such
libraries.
These considerations lead to the proposed estab
lishment of the traveling library system for the pur
pose of rendering the books in the State Library
available for use by the people generally. The sub
i ject is one which should be dealt with by the Legis
| lature at its coming session, and all who understand
the value of libraries to a people should unite to as
â  sure favorable action upon it.
California cannot afford to lag behind the most
progressive States of the Union in this matter, and
with her superb collection of books in the State
Library there is no reason why she should. The
traveling system will entail no additional expense
upon the State and but little upon the communities
that get the benefit of it. Moreover, it must be re
membered, as Sir John Lubbock says, public libraries
save more money than they cost.

tense,; and it is not easy tc see how the fee could

SCHEMES TO
DIVERT GOLD
TO SEATTLE
Strange Plays Against
San Francisco.
CONGRESSMEN UP IN ARMS
DISCRIMINATING EXCHANGE IN
CHICAGO.
Remarkable Energy of the Govern
ment Assayer at Seattle
in Drumming Up
Business.
The California delegation to Congress
has sharpened its claws for a vigorous
bout with the Treasury Department at
Washington regarding a striking and
hitherto unnoticed discrimination against
San Francisco and in favor of Seattle and
Chicago in the matter of the receipt and
disposition of gold bullion produced on
the Pacific Coast, and especially in
Alaska.
One subject of protest Is that since the
establishment of the United States assay
office at Seattle recently gold bullion de
posited with Uncle Sam there has been
paid for by check on the sub-Treasury
at Chicago Instead of San Francisco.
When a man deposits gold bullion at the
San Francisco Mint he receives a check
on the sub-Treasury here.
The difference is that of the regular
banking exchange between the Pacific
Coast and Chicago. Thus, when gold is
deposited in the assay office at Seattle
the Treasury Department practically re
ceives the deposit at Chicago and so Seat
tle is given this advantage over San Fran
cisco. The price of exchange is small, but
the price of exchange regulates the flow of
gold the world over. Between the Pacific
Coast and Chicago exchange costs 15 cents
per JloO. As the Seattle office has re
ceived between $0,000,000 and $8,000,000 this
year its total advantage over San Fran
cisco amounts to several thousand dollars
âa big figure in banking operations.
It further transpires that the enterpris
ing F. A. Wing, who is the assayer in
charge of the Seattle Assay Office, has
been laying himself out to boom the busi
ness of his office and of Seattle by missing
no chances to divert his way and away
from San Francisco all the bullion de
posits possible.
He has over his own signature adver
tised the claim that the Government pays
more for gold bullion at Seattle than at
San Francisco, and has actively solicited
miners to deposit their gold with him
rather than at the San Francisco Mint.
A few days ago, under date of November
2, he answered a letter of inquiry written
by a well-known mining man of this
State, and the main part of this remark
able letter from a Government official is
as follows:
I take great pleasure in informing you that
the charges are as follows: The first charge
Is one eighth of one per cent on the gross value
of the gold and sliver. The second charge Is
four cents per ounce on the weight after melt.
The third charge is Jl for each deposit, or in
cases where the deposit Is over ltr.'O ounces
the charge Is one-tenth of one per cent per
ounce, which makes a small Increase. The
fourth charge is 2 cents an ounce on one
eleventh of the standard weight of the gold,
which is a very small charge. The first and
second charges are the only ones of importance.
All deposits are paid by checks on
the sub-treasury at Chicago. The
advantage of depositing with this
office over the Mint at San Francisco
would be that you can secure East
ern exchange; and our second charge
of four cents an ounce after melt is
two cents less than San Francisco. I
would be very pleased to handle any
gold that you might sea fit to send
me, and am in position to give you
prompt and satisfactory returns.
Trusting to hear from you In the near fu
ture, I am, respectfully yours.
F. A. WING, Assayer in Charge.
This precious letter from a Treasury
Department official suflkiently indicates
the way the Seattle Assay Office is being I
run in open and aggressive competition
with San Francisco by means of news
paper interviews and private communi
cations. "Wing makes that Eastern ex
change stick out as an inducement and
then declares that he will charge his cus- I
tomers 2 cents less an ounce than will I
Superintendent Leach of the San Fran
cisco Mint. According to this, gold is
worth more in the Seattle Government I
market than in San Francisco.
It is possible that Mr. Wing is merely
ignorant. The Government charges at
Seattle are precisely the same as at San
Francisco, but they appear to be ex
pressed differently at an assay office and
at a mint. The one-eighth of 1 per cent
charged at Seattle amounts to exactly 2
cents per ounce, and 4 cents is added to it.
At the mints one charge of 6 cents is
made, and the other trifling charges for
alloy and for deposit are exactly the
same as at Seattle. If the facilities of the
Seattle office allow as perfect assaj s as
at the San Francisco Mint, the depositor
should receive the same amount to a
penny.
Mr. Wing probably tripped on the 4 and
6 cents and may know better when he
learns more. At both the San Francisco
Mint and the Seattle Assay Office the
charges on 1000 ounces of Klondike gold
at $16 an ouce would, according to regu
lations, be $62 56.
There is thus a discrimination against
San Francisco by the Treasury Depart
ment both through its hustling agent and
through the banking advantage allowed.
The gold deposited at the Seattle office Is
shipped to Philadelphia for minting.
When the bill for the establishment of
the Seattle office was passed at the last
session of Congress the argument for it
was that it would help the poor miner.
It is a great convenience to the Alaska
miner who returns to the Sound, but he
does not get the benefit of that "Eastern
exchange." California Congressmen are
unable to see why Seattle should have
this advantage over San Francisco to
draw gold to it.
Senator Perkins, who Is out of town lor
a few days, has said that he will protest
at Washington, and Congressman Hilborn
has declared himself likewise. The only
member of the delegation In the city yes
terday was Congressman Maguire, who
has also looked into the matter quietly.
â¢'lt is an injustice," he declared. "I
shall talk with Senator Perkins when he
returns. It is a discrimination which the
Government should not allow."
When it was suggested that the Treas
ury Department appeared to have created
a "line of least resistance" for the trans
continental flow of gold, he said: "It
has done more than that. It has connived
at a scheme to divert gold to Seattle and
Chicago for the benefit of special inter
ests. And it is not a valid argument to
say that the gold is needed East. The
Government should not do a banking
business in competition with bankers. Let
the bankers ship the gold if it is wanted
East. The natural course of the buHion
is to San Francisco."

twelve 3-inch and twelve 1.8-inch guns In
addition to which formidable armament
she has five torpedo tubes, one of the-se
being above water and the others sub
merged.
The Shikishima, Japanese battle-ship,
was to be launched November 1 from the
Thames Iron Works, and would be the
heaviest ship ever launched, as the hull
and launching cradle weigh 8200 tons. The
ship is 438 feet long over all. 400 feet on
the water line. 75 feet 6 inches breadth
and 27 feet 3 inches mean draugnt. on
which she displaces 14.550 tons, making
the Shikishima practically as large as
the largest British battle-shir. The water
line belt, extending all around the ship,
is 8 feet 2 inches wide and ranges in
thickness from 9 inches to 4 inches. Above
this belt the gun protective armor is b
inches thick and the barbettes and bulk
heads 14 and 12 inches respectively. All
the armor is Harveyized steel, giving a
protection equal to iron of not less than
double the thickness of the armor car
ried. The armament embraces four 12
inch of 40 caliber, fourteen 6-inch quick
firers of 40 caliber, twenty 12-poun.lers,
eight 3-pounders and four 2^-pounders.
She has also five 18-Inch torpedo tubes,
four of which are belo,w water.
Steam trials are more severe and ex
acting in the Russian navy than in any
other, and a continuous run of eight
hours under full power is double that of
the test required in the American, Brit
ish French, German, Italian and Japa
nese navies. During the past two years
England has exacted three additional
trials under various conditions ranging
from thirty to eight hours duration,
and now the French are to follow this ex
ample in the engines of the battle-ship
Jena The first trial at full speed under
forced draught for four hours must de
velop 15,500 horsepower collectively for
the three engines, at which the coal con
sumption must not exceed 2.07 pounds
per horsepower per hour, the second
trial of twenty-four hours under normal
9500 horsepower and a coal consumption
of 1.65 pounds. The third trial of six
hours stipulates 12,500 horsepower with
natural draught and 1.65 pounds of coal,
with all the fires going, and the fourth
test is of six hours' duration under one
half power and requires 5000 horsepower.
Penalties are prescribed for the failure
in getting up to the required horsepower,
and for excess in coal consumption, but
there are no premiums for obtaining the
horsepower with less fuel than the con
tractors have guaranteed, and the test
is altogether very severe on the builders
of the machinery.

Private George Krause Seeks Death In !
Preference to Punishment for Unau- j

PRIVATE GEORGE KRAUSE, Company X, Eighth California Regiment, i
now lies on a small cot In the surgical ward In the Division Field Hos- I
pital at the Presidio with a superficial bullet wound In his left side, i
Krause is suffering little or no pain, and as his wound Is not at all dan- I
gerous, he will recover to do duty again, and incidentally he will be called i
on to appear before a court-martial to answer the charge of absence with- i
out leave. (
Krause came down to the city for a short visit on Thursday. He claims I
that he came without a pass because he was not feeling well, and wanted to I
get out of the work of drilling. After spending the day here he began to
realize 1 there was a warm time in store for him when he returned to Beni
cia, where his company is stationed. This fact began to prey upon hls^mind, i
and the more he thought of it the more afraid he was to go back. Krause
wandered about the streets Friday night and on Saturday he rented a room I
on Sutter street, near Grant avenue. He had no money with him, so yester- i
day morning when he awoke he decided that life was not worth the living. ,
Acting on this supposition Krause loaded his revolver with some bullets
that he had. Fortunately the bullets were of a very small caliber, or else
the result of his wound might have been death. He fired twice at himself.
One ball penetrated his left side, making a slight wound; the other merely
scratched the skin. His landlady was attracted by the noise of the report
and went to his room, where she found Krause lying on the bed. The am
bulance was summoned and the soldier was taken to the Receiving Hospi
tal, where his wound was dressed, and later he was removed to the hos- i
pital at the Presidio.
Krause said he had tried to kill himself because he had troubles. He
admitted that he was afraid to return to Benlcia, but declared that, after I
all, he was glad he was still alive. The soldier is from Colusa, where he
was a clerk in a hardware store. He was formerly a miner. Krause Is said i
to be a bit queer, and was despondent over not being able to go to Manila.
He is subject to crying spells. He is 32 years of age and - strong, husky

SUSPECTED
MURDERERS
IN THE TANKS
Three jHighbinders
Under Arrest.
DECLARE THEIR INNOCENCE
SEQUEL TO THE TRAGEDY IN A
CHINESE THEATER.
Accused of Giving Up Information
Their Alleged Victim Is Put
Out of the
Way.
Locked up in the tanks of the City |
Prison are three highbinders, whom the po- i
lice strongly suspect of being implicated !
in the murder of the unfortunate China
man who was killed while witnessing the
performance at the Chinese Theater on \
Jackson street a few days ago. Detec- j
tives Gibson and "Wren, who arrested !
them, are convinced that they are re
sponsible for the tragic death of their
countryman. They will be held pending
further investigation.
Since the commission of the crime the
detectives have learned that the victim's
life was sought simply because he had j
been suspected of giving information to
the Immigration Bureau about the Chi
nese women who were imported to per
form at the Omaha Exposition and were
smuggled into this city unknown to Gov
ernment officers, whose duty was to pre
vent them from landing. The victim of j
the assassin's bullets, it is claimed, on
learning that the women had hoodwinked
the authorities, repaired to the Immigra
tion Bureau and informed the officer in
charge of the landing of the moon-eyed
damsels.
In some way the owners of the women ,
learned of the action of their fellow coun
tryman and they set a price on his head. !
After the women had been arrested the j
slaveowners resolved to get the inform- j
er's head or die in the attempt.
Through the efforts of a spy who was in
their employ they learned that he was to >
visit the theater on Jackson street on the i
night of the murder, and they resolved i
to take his life. It is known that three â¢
Chinese were delegated to perform the jo
â¦ o air
Whether or not the police will be able ;
to prove that the men who are in custody
had a hand In the murder remains to .be
seen. Both Gibson and "Wren, however,
are convinced that their prisoners are re
sponsible for the tragic ending of the un- ;
fortunate Chinaman. It Is probable that
the prisoners will be charged with the
murder to-day. __

"STUFFED" UNASSIGNED LIST
TEACHERS DREW SALARY WITH
OUT EARNING IT.
Grand Jury Threatens to Lock Up the
Books of the Department Unless
Its Experts Are Left
in Peace.
Scandals are developing in the Board of
Education almost too fast for the Grand
Jury to keep track of them. Turn which
way they may, the investigators are con
fronted with Borne fresh evidence of
wrongdoing on the part of the board that
increases the total of its misdoings. Each
day that the investigation proceeds, not
one, but many, new forms of villainy
are discovered, and the end is not in sight.
For many months it has been openly
asserted that not even the teachers have
escaped, and that the "business men" of
the board had carried their crooked work
into that branch of the department. The
alleged sale of positions was given con
siderable ventilation during the Kilpat
rick-Stanton expose several months ago,
but the board succeeded in beading off a
complete inquiry into the charges at that
time; it is not going to be as successful
now, however.
Then there is the old, old charge of fa
voritism, which is to be gone into thor
oughly, and in this connection will come
an Inquiry into the reasons that brought
the board to maintain such an enormous
unassigned and substitute list. At the
present time there are something like
thirty unassigned and twenty substitute
teachers in the department, but notwith
standing this fact, more appointments are
steadily being made.
The unassigned list of teachers Is com
posed of two classes, the largest number
being teachers who are no longer compe
tent to till positions, but are allowed to
draw their regular pay, ranging from $50
to $79 for teachers and more for principals
and vice-principals. The second class is
composed of a few pets of the board who
are desirous of drawing pay without the
necessity of earning it, so they are with
drawn irom their classes and become a
burden on the city while other teacners
do their work. â¢
In this second division may be rated
Miss O'Brien, sister-in-law of Director
Ragan. Some months ago Miss O'Brien,
then Â» teacher in the night school, was
relieved and placed on the substitute list
at her own request. Since then she has
done no work whatever, but has reerularly
drawn $50 a moHth salary. Miss Smith is
another teacher who wanted to take a
rest, and so had herself appointed to the
unassigned list.
The subsitute teachers are paid J4O a
month, work or no work, and are sup
posed to hold themselves in readiness to
take a regular teacher's place at a mo
ment's notice. It is the rule that the un
assigned list shall be exhausted before the
substitutes are called upon, but it is daily
violated on the plea that some of the un
assigned teachers are superannuated.
Whether that excuse is given for not in
terrupting the permanent picnic of Miss
O'Brien, .Miss Smith and others is not
It is openly asserted, though, that fifty
teachers are thus drawing salary from the
city, although tnere is no necessity for
maintaining a reserve list of more than
fifteen. Unassigned and subsitutes are re
quired under the rules, to report at the
office of th.j secretary for assignment
every morning at S o'clock, but it is said
the favorites observe this rule by tele
phoning to the office and leaving the r ad
dresses so they can be found should an
emergency arise whereby their presence
is required. . Â
Thf-se are some of the features of the
appointment of teachers that will receive
due consideration at the hands of the
It may be stated here that the experts
employed by the Grand Jury are having
anything but an easy time of it in tneir
search for truth. Last Friday Mr. Kil
patrick was obliged to calT upon Graham,
the Building and Grounds Committees
bookkeeper, for a stub book to enable him
to trace certain bills. Graham gave up
the book reluctantly, although he had no
further use for It, and Kilpatrick took it
to the secretary 1 " office. Later in the day,
while Kilpatrick was temporarily absent
from the room, Graham took the book and
carried it back to the storeroom. Kilpat
rick reported the occurrence to b. i_.
Irving, foreman of the Grand Jury, and
that official immediately sent word out to
thÂ« Board of Education tnat . the ol ? x r pe^
was to have every book and paper he
needed placed at his free disposal, and if
any further attempt was made to olock
his work all the books would be removed
to the Grand Jury room and locked . up un
til the investigation was concluded.
THE SPORTS WAITING.
They Will Not Bet on the Lavlgne-
Tracy Fight for Several Days.
So far there has been little betting on
the Lavigne-Tracey tight, which takes
place on the 25th of this month. The
sports are waiting to learn the result of
the Corbett-Sharkey nght before they put
up any money on the local battle. From
present indications it is almost certain
that the betting will be nearly all at even
money, as the talent says it is a very
even match. Lavigne is credited with be
ine a very stiff puncher and also a glutton
for punishment, while on the other hand
Tracey is known to be a great general In
the ring, and never lets an opportunity to
administer a blow pass.
In the six years that Tracey has been
in the American ring this will be only thÂ«
second occasion that he will meet his
opponent at even weights. The only time
before this fight that he weighed the
same as his adversary was the time ha
fought Walcott In Chicago, and at that
fight he was credited by the papers with

By Â«Joe Corbett.
After, ten long drawn out Innings the j
game yesterday afternoon between the j
Band Crabs and Athletics at Recreation J
Park was called a draw, the score stand-
Ing 6 to 6.
A great crowd turned out to see the
performance, and like Saturday were
given a treat not soon to be forgotten.
Not since the league began have pa
trons .received more than their moneys
â¢worth, as was the case yesterday. Indeed
I do not remember an instance in which
bo much satisfaction was expressed on
all sides over the manner in which the <
contest terminated. There were of course 'â¢
many occasions where a kick or criti- '
cism would not be out of place, yet it
â would hardly be the proper caper to make
one at this time.
The game started off like a positive vie- \
tory for the Athletics. In the first two i
innings they scored two runs, and in the ;
third, through the generous assistance of :
Btreib and Hurge. who made each a mis- ;
erable muff, and a double by Meeney, fol- i
lowed with a single by First Baseman t
Johnson they scored three more runs and ]
cinched the game as everybody thought. '
The Sand Crabs, however, were not to i
be denied. They kept plugging away, and :
finally in the fourth inning they did man
age to break the ice by sending two runs \
across the plate. "Youngee" Johnson, late '
of the Rochester Club, was directly re- :
sponsible for these counts. His wildness
â was marked from the very beginning, and ;
in the fourth inning the d,amage he did hl3- ;
team's chances was appalling. .â¢ . . â¢
The inning began and ended as follows:
Arrellanes and Burge singled. On a balk
they ; advanced a peg nearer home, and
then Johnson gave a most miserable, ex- j
hibition by permitting the next three men '
to take first base on balls and thereby
forcing in Arrellanes and Burge. He re
tired at the end of the inning and Fitz-
Patrick took his place. Fitz<-was not as
wild as Johnson, but fared badly, for in
the sixth, with two men out the Athletics
bunched their hits and scored three runs.
An error and a hit batsman, however, were
sandwiched in between his rally. In the
seventh both sides scored, yet the run of
the Sand Crabs was questionable from a
spectator's standpoint, but not from
mine. It happened in this manner: Burge
was on third base. Donlin. the batter, hit
to Fitzpatrick and was thrown out at
first. Burge undismayed made a dash for
the plate, and was called safe. Hisses and
groans accompanied Umpire McDonald's !
decision, r although it was perfectly j
right, despite its closeness. Jvohman did !
not touch Burge. He hit the ground close
to him; of that I feel positive. This ended
the run getting, and at the expiration of
the tenth, owing to darkness, McDonald
called the game. McCarthy lost a run for
his side for mixing in a play ; when he
should have been in the coacher's box
McDonald's ruling on this occasion was
also correct. The ore follows: 1

Stockton Takes the Final Game From
Oakland.
STOCKTON, Oil.. Nov. 20.â Stockton
won the final game to-day from Oakland
by a score of 7 to 1. most of the runs be
inp made on four bad errors in throwing,
made by Sullivan, the visiting catcher.
A disagreeable feature of the game was
the "kicking" of Lange, which drove more
than one spectator away from the grand
stand. The score was:

TROUBLE IS
BREWING AT
LAKE ATLIN
Confusion Over Many
of the Claims.
JUMPERS WILL BE ACTIVE
MEN WHO LOSE RICH DIGGINGS
EXPECTED TO SHOW FIGHT.
*
Miss Dolly Bennett, the Mayor of the
New Mining Metropolis, Grows
Bich Through Her Win
ning Ways.
BY HAL HOFFMAN.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
JUNEAU, Alaska, Nov. 11.â H. D.
Lund, just out from Lake Atlin, de
scribes the situation in a way that in
dicates that things will be badly mixed
up in the new diggings next spring. It
will take a firm and level-headed gold
commissioner and a vigilant police
force to prevent bloodshed. That there
is going to be trouble over the claims
there is no doubt. Mr. Lund is origin
ally from the north of England. He
came from New York to Lake Linder
man as agent for the Peterboro Canoe
Company and learned of the Atlin dis
covery in time to get in there and lo
cate No. 3. below Discovery, on Pine
Creek, which is considered one of the
best claims on the creek. He is also
interested in No. 4 below. Mr. Lund
said:
"When the first rush was on every
body thought the ground was in Brit
ish Northwest Territory, and located
250-foot claims. The British Columbia
Gold Commissioner came along and the
claims had to be reduced to 100 feet.
This let the gate open for jumping, and
In many instances not only the 150 feet
but the 100 feet, to which the original
locator is entitled, for the law does not
I take that away from htm, though he
! may have staked too much, were
1 jumped and restaked. Some of the
original locations were recorded and
some were not, and it is the same way
! with the relocations. After staking
quite a number of men left for the
; coast to get ready for returning in the
! spring and others stampeded to other
j creeks and made locations there. Very
few of these did the amount of work
j before or after the closed season neces
: sary to hold the claims, and a number
' of claims otherwise legally located have
I been Jumped on this point of law. Now
I when these original locators return
' next spring and find their ground
claimed and staked by other men there
lis going to be trouble. I shall not be j
| surprised to hear of a few sudden j
i deaths.
â¢The gravel is going to be easy to
> work. There is plenty of water, and
i the country is the most favorable for
I prospecting that 1 ever saw Under
â  brush is almost unknown. The timber
is open and the ground is hard and
i dry The firewood is so hard and dry
that it burns with a bluish flame that
makes a great heat. Some of this wood
i is so hard that it will turn the edge of
an ax, and seems petrified. You can
cross the country from creek to creek ,
anywhere.
"There were reports of a new strike
up in the neighborhood of Five Lakes
i before I came out. I did not stop to
i investigate, and don't think much of
! the report. Five L -kes are up beyond
Surprise Lake, and some good pros
â â  pects I know have been found in that
| section. Yes, I heard something about
i a smoking mountain up there, but I
i never saw it. The formation is pc
: culiar in there. The gravel seems to
be foreign to the surrounding country.
I For instance, the bottom of Wright
| Creek is a slate standing on end, and
i the depressions in it make a natural
- ! sluice box and ripples. It is in these
| crevices in the bed of the creek that the
j gold is found. Wright is one of the
j best creeks. A great many men got
| left who might have had good claims
: there because they took no stock in the
creek at first, and the fellows who
staked regardless got good ground.
"There will be two towns in there,
Atlin City, on the shore of the lake.
i and Discovery City, near Discovery
claim on Pine Creek, but I think Dis
covery City will be the leading place,
! It is eight miles up the creek, but is
I centrally located with reference to all
I the other creeks on which claims have
been staked. The British Columbia
Government holds the town sites and
leases the ground. For instance, five
! miles along the lake and five miles In
i land from Atlin City is reserved by
! the Government. After a suitable time,
! usually in three or four years, the lots
j are sold to the highest bidder, the im
provements a man has made on his lot
being counted in his favor in his bid.
Lots thus usually go to those who have
occupied and improved them."
Mr. Lund made a neat clean-up out
of the general stampede to Atlin dur
ing the last week in August and in Sep
tember as a ferryman. He had a ca
noe, one of a very few boats on the
lake, and carried people across Atlin
| for aa high as $20 a head, five to the
j load. More boats and competition came
I along in time, and when the fare got
down to $2 50 for the eigh* miles diag
onally across the lake from the portage
to Atlin City he quit.
A man known as Colonel L. W. Smith,
from some place in California, has
made a road across the two-mile por
tage from Taku Arm to Lake Atlin,
I the Taku Arm end of which is pro
! tected by ground located as a placer
claim. He has had a park train In
operation since early In the rush, and
| Is credited with having made a barrel
of money at 5 cents a pound. A wagon
train will be put on next summer, and
j as doubtless the same experience will
' occur ap between Dyea and Rkaguay,
' there will be a whole fleet of steam,
i sail and row boat ferries on the lake.
! Skaguay parties have interested them
selves in buying or building a light
draught boat of sufficient power to take
her up the Atlintoo River from Taku
Arm to the lake. Lumber has been or
dered at Jimeau and Skaguay for the
erection of hotels, saloons and other
buildings at the new diggings. It will
Ibe sledded in over the snow. Observa
tion shows that extensive preparations
! are being made for business at Atlin.
The Mayor of Atlin City is a woman.
i One of the most successful plungers in
mining property at the new diggings is
a well known and very attractive
young woman, who has left more than
a few smitten hearts in her wake dur
ing a several years' residence in Ju
neau. There are no rounders in Alaska
who haven't heard of her.
She is a Miss Dolly Bennett, neat,
trim, thoroughly up to date, and the
last girl even the most experienced
Market-street masher would pick out
for an adventuress. Miss Bennett was
by common consent endowed with the
title of "Mayor of Atlin City." She is
credited, among other accomplishments
of the season at Atlin, with having
[made an impression on a Government
official connected with the office where
claims are recorded, and throug-h her
natural diplomacy to have succeeded
in acquiring in " various ways good
claims on the best creeks. She is now
said to be one of the richest claim
holders in the Atlin country. Miss Ben
nett has come out of the diggings to
mingle with the gay world on the coast
for the winter, and is now at Skag
town. This winsome creature was
never a sunburst nor a grand piano
with the loud treadle on. but rather as
soft-toned and sympathetic as a melo
deon in the dusk of a summer eve.
MIX, THE LUCKY MINER,
WELL KNOWN IN SHASTA
REDDING, Nov. 20.â 1n announcing
the rich gold strike at Porcupine,
thirty-five miles up the Chilkat trail
the Juneau correspondent of The Call
mentioned P. W. Mix and Ed Finley as
the discoverers of the new district and
recited the fact that Mix was formerly
a resident of Shasta, in this county,
where he supposed that his wife and
parents still resided. The news in The
Call created a great deal of interest in
this county.
It has been ascertained that S. W.
Mix lived at Shasta in former years,
though none of his relatives are rest
dents of Shasta County now. Mix is
about 30 years old. a son of J. D. Mix,
District Attorney of this county from
1860 to ISC2. His mother is a resident
of Walla Walla. The lady Is a heavy
stockholder in the famous Washington
mine at French Gulch, and was the
guest in this city of Judge Bush and
family a couple of years ago.
An uncle of the Alaskan miner used
to. do business in the old town of
Shasta, under the firm name of Pierce,
Church & Co., and a brother, (Jus Mix,
also lived in Shasta at that time. Old
residents say the Mix family was
highly reputable.
OPERATION OF THE
NEW BANKRUPTCY LAW
All Classes Ready to Benefit by the
Change, but Many Courts Are Not
Prepared to Pas Upon It.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 20.â The forth- 1
coming report of the Attorney General
embraces a review of the operation of
the national backruptcy law of July 1,
1898, which has been prepared by E. C. j
Brandenberg, In charge of bankruptcy ;
matters In the Department of Justice, j
Mr. Brandenburg, who is preparing a |
book on bankruptcy, briefly reviews sim- !
ilar past legislation and details the op
eration of the feature of the law permit- '
ting persons to become voluntary bank
rupts which took effect August 1, 189 S. j
From this report it appears that the ap
plicanta for relief have been found in I
every walk of life, Irrespective of class
or locality and phowa that the large
class of men who have been unfortunate
in their business enterprises have availed
themselves of the relief offered. Not
withstanding the law has been in force
over three months, the courts In eight
districts declined to proceed with the ref
erence and adjudication of the petitions
for/the reason that the Supreme Court
has not promulgated the rules, forms and
orders required by the act. In all other
cases the courts have proceeded and ud-
Judlcated Petitioners bankrupt or have re- |
ferred the canes to the referees for u<- :
tion. Since the law took effect 1700 peti- |
tlons of involuntary bankruptcy have
been filed. Singularly, the districts of!
Delaware, Eastern Pennsylvania, South
ern Georgia, Nevada, New Mexico, West
ern Virginia and Wyoming show that no
persons therein have applied to be ad
judged bankrupt.
The following shows the number of
cases filed in each State:
Alabama, 181; Arizona, 1: Arkansas, 23;
California, 86; Colorado, 28; Connecticut,
S; Delaware, none; District of Columbia,
1; Florida. 2S; Georgia, northern district,

As the involuntary features of the law
which permits creditors to have their
debts adjudicated as a bankrupt did not i
take effect until November 1. 1898, it has I
been impossible to obtain any data with
reference to the operation of this provi- j
sion.
INDIANS WILLING TO
LEASE THEIR LANDS
Ask for Permission to Give a Syndi
cate Control of Mineral Prop
erty in Utah.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 20.â The long agi
tated question of Gilsonite land leases in
Utah has been revived by a delegation of
four Uintah Indians, who, with an in- i
terpreter, have arrived here, mainly to ;
obtain the approval of a valuable lease.
The lease is for several thousand acres of ;
the best mineral land iq the reservation,
and the prospective lessee is the Raven
Mining Company, mad* up, It is said,
largely of Chicago capital. President
Potwii) of the Chicago "Varnish Company,
and Charles Fister of the Fister & "\ ogel !
Leather Company of Milwaukee are stat
ed to be among the prime movers of the
company.
The delegation had a hearing before
Commissioner of Indlnn Affairs Jones, at !
which Mr. Potwin also was present. The
delegation stated that the tribe was anx
totu to lease its mineral lands and to
have the revenue therefrom accrue to it.
Respecting the proposition that it accept
allotments on the agricultural portions
and leave all the rest open to sale at $1 2o
an acre, the reds pointed out that only
the most valuable portion would then be
bought, taking away the revenue-produc
ing tracts and leaving the otherwise use
less portions.
They were informeu by Commissioner
Jones that he favored the leasing of their
lands to any responsible parties for the .
Indians' own benefit. While he would j
like to see them accept allotments on \
their agricultural lands, they should at
the same time have satisfactory royalties
from the mineral lands. The delegation j
will call on President McKinley and Sec
retary Bliss, who will give them a hear- ;
ing on their proposition.
SAVES A FRIEND'S LIFE,
THEN LOSES HIS OWN
Surveyor John Mclntyre Browned in
Old River, Near
Bethany.
BETHANY, Nov. 20.â John Mclntyre,
employed by the Old River Land and Re
clamation Company at C.rton Court as a
surveyor, was drowned last night. He was
a native of Scotland, about 40 years of
age.
While returning home last night at
about 10 O'clock with a pnrty of friends,
and on coming to the Old River, which
they had to cross, one of the party fell
into the river. Mclntyre plunged in after
him and brought him ashore. Half an
hour late, when crossing the river again
two miles further down, Mclntyre fell
overboard. A companion immediately
plunged in after him, but Mclntyre never
came to the surface. Jt is very probable
that he beciinv chilled or was taken witn
cramps after having rescued his compan
ion, and, becoming unable to balance the
little boat or to swim to shore after hav
ing fallen in. he sank immediately. Mc
lntyre was for a long time a resident ot
Stockton. The body has not yet been re
covered.

Four Attempts at Self-Destruction, Due to Melancholia,
Within the Past Month.
Miss Dur/'e Heithier, an 18-year-old
schoolgirl, shot herself i\the left breast
on November 16, and is still hovering
between life and death. The desertion
of her betrayer, George Alexander, im
pelled her to seek her life.
WITHIN a month four women, the oldest barely 30 years old and the youngest a mere schoolgirl in her teens, have at
tempted self-destruction. Two of them succeeded, while the others are still in a precarious condition with death and life
fighting for supremacy. Morbidness was the impelling cause in each instance, and the record is considered to speak any
thing but favorably for the mental condition of the young women of to-day. It is thought some method should be devised at
once to overcome this increasing tendency to mental depression, and the beginning ought to be made at home. By some it is
considered possible that the much vaunted freedom of the American girl has much to do with bringing about this melancholia,
and that more restriction and more careful training is necessary. Indiscriminate reading, excessive study, and above all unrestricted
freedom of movements, it is contended, are calculated to develop an abnormal mental condition in the young which mothers would
do well to correct.

Arthur Brown Dies From a Fractured Skull Received
hu a Blow From a Club.
ARTHUR F BROWN died last evening at his home, 2514 McAllister street,
from a blow on the head which he received Saturday night at the hands
of an unknown man. The weapon used was a club and Brown said be
fore he died that he had been hit while on Fourth street, but further than
this he did not explain. . "
The deceased was employed as a shipping clerk for the Albion Lumber
Company, and Saturday night, when he left his work, he received his week's
salary amounting to about $15. Sunday morning he returned home shortly be
fore 2 o'clock and told his wife, who met him at the door, that he had
been struck with a club somewhere on Fourth street. Mrs. Brown bathed
and dressed a wound on the left Hide of the head, and then the husband
went to bed. He groaned as if in great pain for some time and about 5
o'clock lost consciousness.
Dr. F. C. Muller was called in a couple of hours later and found that the
skull had been fractured and from the appearance of the wound he judged
that it had been made with a club or sandbag. Brown died at 7 o'clock without
regaining consciousness.
When Brown returned to his home yesterday morning he was accompanied
by a man name] Louis Webber. Instead of opening the door with a key he
rang the bell, which was answered by his wife. Webber stood at the foot of
the steps leading to the door, and as soon as he saw that the bell haQ been
answered he left without saying anything.
All the money Brown had was tS2O. He fumbled in his pockets and gave
two dollars to his wife, remarking to her that he should have more money than
that. A dollar and twenty rents was found in his pockets after he <\\p<\.
As he had been paid that evening it is possible that he was robbed, but his
friends are inclined to think that he spent the money before he was struck.
Mrs. Brown says that her husband was perfectly sober, though he seemed
dazed from the wound.
Brown was a native of California and was thirty-nine years of age. Be
sides the widow he leaves four childrenâ two dovb and two girls. An aunt
of Mrs. Brown's, Mrs. E. Stratton, and her daughter, Mrs. Herbert Osborn,
whose husband was killed in the explosion at Pinole, have been living at
Brown's home.
Late last night the police arrested Webber, May Bennett and Albert BierÂ«
wirth, keeper of a lodging house at 821 Howard street. They are all held pend
ing a charge. The story they tell is this: Webber, Brown and the woman
were in a room together making a good deal of noise and Bierwlrth ordered
them out. They started to go when Brown called Bierwlrth a vile name. Bler
wirth went to his own room and came back with a policeman's club, with
which he beat Brown over the head until he was nearly insensible. Tben
Webfcer took him home.

Ing contest for turkeys, both open to all,
only one shot apiece allowed in the shoot
and only scores of 25 and 24 counting. A
large number participated in both events
and the cracking of the rifles meant death
to many a gobbler.

were deserted, although the day was an
ideal one for shooting. The San Francisco

THANKSGIVING SERVICE.
Junior Order of American Mechanics
Addressed by Rev. John
Downie.
The annual Thanksgiving: services of the
Junior Order of American Mechanics was
held last night in the First Baptist
Church. Rev. John Downie delivered the
sermon. The main body of the church
was filled with representatives of the or
der from the following councils: Abraham
Lincoln, TT. S. Grant, Starr King. Qar
fleld and Alexander Hamilton. The Mar- |
tha Washington and California councils of ;
the Daughters of Liberty also united with
the Junior Order of American Mechanics
In participating in the services, and many !
representatives from these two councils !
were present. _
Prior to the sermon John W. Rogers of
U. S. Grant Council, in the absence of S. ;
Joseph Tyson, delivered a brief ad- I
dress upon the "origin and pur- ,
poses of the order. His remarks were
forcible and to the point. He declared
that the Junior Order of American Mo- ,
ohanics is to-day one of the noblest and
grandest in this country, standing for the
best interests of America, the truest
principles of citizenship and the integrlty
of our National Government.
Rev. Mr. Downie chose as his text the
thirty-fourth verse of the fourteenth.
chapter of Proverbsâ "Righteousness ex
alteth a nation; but sin is a reproach to
any people."
Beginning with the reign of Solomon,
â whom he characterized as the greatest
ruler of the world, the speaker Illustrat
ed how the supremest monarchs of the
earth had flourished lor a while in tem
poral greatness, but how finally all of the
ungodly had come to shame and ruin.
Along these lines he cited, the dangers
that menaced this Government and how
they were to be met and overcome by the
noble and good men of this country. The
preacher then said that it was such or
ders as the. Junior American Mechanics
that would be the salvation of the coun
try. The principles of the order and the
laws that govern the order were, he said,
the principles and laws that God meant
man to live for and adopt. This order has
done much for the good of the country,
it will do much in the future and its
growth will lÂ»e substantial and sure, for
it rests on a foundation of virtue, liberty
and patriotism that cannot be over
thrown.

A young lady in New York City relates the curious case of het'sfster
who suffered from a sort of nervous dyspepsia â was what the doc-
tor called it. She was despondent low-spirited, inclined to imagine all
sorts of things. One thing especially seemed to be in her mind ; that
was the idea that abscesses were forming in different parts of her body.
The sister who tells the story had found Ripans Tabules a specific for
headache, and generally had a supply on hand. One day, more in
joke than in earnest, she said to the afflicted one : Try these
they'll cure you." Well, she did try them, and strangely enough the
: Tabules did cure her. The despondency left her. This was nearly
a year ago. She took less than a dollar's worth in aIL and has oat

ALL ILLOGICAL
MAN WANTED
FOR MAYOR
Oakland Is Now Busy
With City Politics.
LEGACY OF LAST FREAK
TIME FOR REPUBLICANS TO RE
GAIN CONTROL.
Not Likely to Be Any Demand for a
Repetition of the Work of the
Committee of Twenty-
One, g
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Nov. 20.
Oakland is now casting about for an il
logical candidate for Mayorâ illogical be
cause that is the usual method observed
lathis place. It is âjnerally conceded Lhat
Mayor Thomas will not seek a second
term. There have been worse Mayors
than Mr. Thomas, but he has expressed no
desire to succeed himself. There are many
names already submitted to people
âthat is to say, they are "mentioned"â
presumably by some interest that would
have an ax to grind in the event of their
favorite's election.
Very few of the people of this city know
why certain men in the past twenty years
have been named. It is perhaps as well
they should not be enlightened, and the
remark is equally true and pertinent of
City Councils. Surprise is expressed when
the nominations are made that the choice
should have failen where It did, but there
being no alternative but few questions
were asked. Sometimes the ra'lroad, but
more often the water companies, worked
the whole scheme, and only in one in
stance in Oakland's history was the pro
gramme beaten. This was six years ago
when Dr. Pardee and the Non-Partisans
carried everything before them. One
tÂ«rm of this was sufficient for Oakland,
and the "regulars" resumed control,
though in a new form.
Everybody admits that the logical can- |
didate is Auditor Snowâ every man who
uthfully and intelligently served as
a public olrkial for ten years is a "logi
c;u" candidate for promotion except to i
those who are opposed to third and sue
ccssive terms, nut Mr. Snow was the
logical candidate two, tour and six years ,
ago, but was not taken up, and now he
is not any more logical than then. Two
Mr. Snow might have i.ad the
nomination had he expressed a desire lor
it but he declined it. The place may be ;
ottered him this time, but should he again I
decline the "logic" of his candidacy may
be considered at an end. There are men
â¢"mentioned" for the office who seem to
take a biennnlal pleasure in being put up
to be knocked down. They will be
knocked down as usual this year, and I
am inclined to think the next Mayor of
Oakland is not yet mentioned.
The next municipal government will de- i
pend on the methods to be adopted in
calling the Republican convention more
than on the Individuals who may be nom
inated it having become customary for |
Influence rather than personal worth to
prevail with the voters. Two years ago
something entirely new in nolitics was :
bed. A "committee of twenty-one
came into existence, claiming power from ,
the Republican City Central Committee
to name the delegates to a convention.
Just what this committee might have ac
complished had it oeen able to control
the convention cannot he prophesied, I v:
all Oakland knows the History ol the
city government given to it two years ago
by the ambitious committtee of twenty
oiie. The secrets brought to light by "the
Grand Jury of three hundred days, the
water rate scandals, the tinkering with
the tax levy and a host of other things of
recent date", represent the legacy to Oak
land of the committee's convention, and j
one such experience is enough for any i
community. No one uoubts now the part !
the water' companies took in naming the j
last city government, and there is no rea- ;
sun t'i'sunpose that they, with their in-;
creased friendliness, are any less anxious :
for cinch water rates than they were two
years ago.
At this time especially It would seem
to be the duty of the Republican party
to assert Itself in municipal politics. Per
sonal aggrandizement and a desire to be
a boss never tends toward good govern
ment either for a city or a nation. Oak- j
land has shown a strong desire to return
to straight party lines. It has just ex
pressed its confidence in the party, and
from a purely local point of view it would
appear to be good policy to do everything
possible to take advantage of the oppor
tunity now offering to Increase and unify
the party. Although severe disappoint- i
ment followed the failure of Oakland to
name the Governor, it soon disappeared, I
and at last night's ratification meeting ,
Dr. Pardee was one of the most jubilant
of those who were proud to be present.
The statement of Major McLaughlin that ;
T)r Pardee is the natural candidate of the
party at the next State convention should
not he forgotten by the Republicans. The
party in Oakland has wU.an the past two
weeks demonstrated Us loyalty to the
State and county tickets, and It is the
duty of the leaders to see that the city
elects a government that will materially
aid party progress during the next two
years.
Oakland is not alone in doing things that
are freakish. She has a rival in San Lean
dro This little town has recently proved
h.-r public spirit by subscribing liberally
to establish a large cannery, and is now
striving to bring a fruit-drying establish
ment into its midst. Yet the pretty place
across the bridge has not yet passed the
Ftage of lighting the town with oil lamps,
while many of her citizens revel in the
luxury of gas.
On this side of the bay very little sur- |
prise was expressed when it became I
known that old Horace W. Carpentier had i
bourne an ally of Dr. McDonald in the j
scheme to fleece the depositors of the Peo
ple'a Homf> and Pncific banks. Carpen- ]
tic-r's history la well known to the older
generation, although the younger element
s.-me-times wonders at the bitter feeling
that has been handed down in regard to
Carp^ntier and his associates. As a mat
ter of fact, one of the chief reasons why
bonds were not favored for the purchase
of Adams Point by the city a month ago
â w;is the antipathy still felt toward any
thing: that .has any connection with the
frauds of Carpentier and his associates
forty years ago. STUART W. BOOTH.
DRANK FOUR OUNCES
OF WHISKY AND DIED
FATAL THIBST OF A FOTJR
YEAB-OLD CHILD.
John Vierra Jr. of Pleasanton Found
a Jug in Which Death
Lurked.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 20.
Whisky caused the deatn of the four
year-old son of John Vierra at Pleas
anton this afternoon. The child had been
playing; in the bedroom shortly before 3
o'clock, and there found a jug of the
liquor, from which it is supposed he
drank about four ounces.
The mother, sitting in another room,
heard the child fall quite heavily, and
surprised that no outcry followed hur
â¢ ; to see what the little one was doing.
She found her baby lying on the floor un
conscious.
By his side stood the whisky jug, from
which about four ounces had been drunk.
Dr Hlrschiser was immediately sum
moned, but could do nothinsr for the child.
The little one remained unconsoious until
death came, about an hour after the fatal
doee had been quaffed. t

Manuel Davie the Lat
est Victim.
SHOT TWICE BY A FRIEND
REFUSED TO GIVE THE GUN
WIELDER MONEY.
Indulgence in Too Much Liquor Re
suite in a Brutal Attempt tc
Murder â Horatio Paul
in Prison.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 20.
Manuel Davie was taken to the
Receiving Hospital to-night with a
bullet wound In his chest and an
! other In the left shoulder. His assailant.
: Horatio Paul, Is in the City Prison,
' charged with assault to murder. The
shooting occurred at tue corner of First
i avenue and Maple street, where both re
side.
Their stories as to the cause and time
;of the shooting vary greatly. According
to the injured man the affair occurred be
; tween 1 and 2 o'clock this afternoon. Da
' vie is a gardener and has of late worked
- at the Catholic Deaf and Dumb Asylum
at Fortieth street and Telegraph avenue.
' He is a Chilean, aged 33 years, and re
' sides in a cabin in the rear of Paul's
! premises. The story he tells is plausible
; and Is partially corroborated by Romeo
Figarara, who has a room at Paul's
house.
"I was out in the yard at about 1:30
; o'clock this afternoon when Paul, who
was drunk, asked me for a quarter. I
told him no, I had given him $1 last night
and he spent it for liquor, and he had
enough. 'I will fix you, then, you black
i ,> he said, and he went into his
i kitchen. When he came out again he
shot me twice and I fell. Paul then went
back into the house and I crawled into
mv cabin. Twice before Paul had threat
ened to shoot me while he was drunk.
When Figarara called on Davie about 7
o'clock to-night he found that nis in
: juries were serious and notified Officer
Keefe Davie and his assailant were
1 placed in the patrol wagon together.
' While the former lay groaning his as
sailant claimed that he (Davie) had
broken through his kitchen door some
time between 1 and 4 o'clock this morn-
I ing- that he had told him to go away, and
Davie refusing he shot him.
â¢â¢You know that is not true, replied
the injured man. "It was this afternoon
a^iu"arara "states that he heard the shots
fired at about 5 o'clock this afternoon:
that he rushed out and prevented Paul
from firing a third shot. It is supposed
that all three were very much the worse
' for liquor, and after the shooting Figa
rara returned to his room immediately.
At the City Prison Paul became very
< talkative. lie is past 66 years of age and
seemed to be in the best of spirits and
: flirty joked about the affair at the outset.
This fellow rents from me and pays $1 50
per month for the cabin said Paul.
: â¢'Early this morning he broke in my kitch
en door and came in. I told him to get
' out and when he refused obstinately I
shot him twice. I have always treated
Davie better than I would my own broth
er When he was out of work I fed him.
I admit I got a dollar from him last night
but that was part of his rent due me. I
am a member of the California Pioneer
Society in San Francisco and I don know
whether they will repudiate me for get
ting this trouble. However, I will de
mand a jury trial and my attorneys are
Â°2SS Paused that he had visited
Davie in his cabin between 4 and oclock
this afternoon. "But," said he, Davie
i didn't recognize me. He knew he was
i shot, but said nothing about it. and I went
. The police are inclined to place more
! credence in Davids story, for Paul appears
too ready with answers to questions that
I are leading. _ , _, __
! At the Receiving Hospital Dr. J. M. Kane
. attended Davie's Injuries. Neither of the
: bullets could be found to-night. One took
i effect almost in the center of the breast
> and is believed to have ranged downward
'â  between the fifth and sixth ribs and lodg
; ed in the lower part of the lobe of the
< right lung. The other bullet took effect
i high up in the left shoulder, ranging to
1 ward the neck. At a late hour Davie was
; resting easy.
Funds for a New Church.
OAKLAND, Nov. 20.â An interesting
demonstration will be Riven to-morrow
night in the new hall just completed on
the ruins of the Sacred Ht art Church,
and the funds thus raised will go toward
building a new church edifice.
UNITARIANS DEDICATE A NEW CHURCH.
BERKELEY, Nov. 20.â The new Unitarian Church, on the corner of Ban
croft way and >Â£>ana street was formally dedicated this afternoon. The
occasion brought over to the university town a large number of people
from the cities around the bay.
The new edifice, of unique design and artistic finish, was crowded to
overflowing long before the hour arrived for the service to begin/ In an
eloquent and impressive manner the Rev. Horatio D. Stebblns, D.D., of
San Francisco, pronounced the words which consecrated the building to the
service of God and humanity.
In appearance the unique structure presents a radical departure from
the conventional methods of church architecture. At no point is it higher
than thirty feet from the ground, being unusually broad in proportion to
the height. The outside is covered entirely with white cedar shingles and
set irregularly. A large circular window pierces the front, facing on Dana
street, the light coming principally from four windows of plain Gothic
type facing Bancroft way.
The interior is finished very artistically, the general effect being some
what dark and somber. Redwood boards fastened together with keys and
stained with burnt sienna line the auditorium to a height of eight feet.
Above that, including the celling, the whole is tinted with dark red. Over
head the beams are left rough and stained with a very dark green. Sup
porting the beams at their base are ship knees, also left rough and fitted
with keys. The main auditorium has a seating capacity of about 300; the
Sunday-school room adjoining 170.
The building has been several months in the course of construction,
owing to the difficulty of obtaining requisite materials. Its total cost is
about $5000, which the Berkeley congregation, with some assistance from the
East, has striven hard to cover.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 21, 1898.
JOHN REDDY
TIE SMG
Some Other Ma.n Shot
Officer Keyes.
A MYSTERIOUS ASSAILANT
THE PRISONER'S STORY AS PUB
LISHED WAS TRUE.
iÂ£e Was at the Haywards Hotel at
the Time the Midnight
Duel Was Taking
Place.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 20.
The man who shot Charles Keyes, the
Alameda policeman, in this city shortly
after midnight yesterday, near Jefferson
Park, Is unknown and still at liberty.
The local police department, Detective
Denny Holland and Sheriff-elect Oscar
Rogers, also Marshal of the Encinal City,
are in absolute darkness as to the Iden
tity of the would-be murderer of Keyes.
That John P. Reddy, who was arrested
in San Jose yesterday and brought here,
is not the man was proved to-day beyond
a doubt.
According to the statement of Detective
Holland, made to-night. Reddy has es
tablished one of the clearest alibis that a
prisoner and suspect has ever been fortu
nate enough to make out.
"This man, John P. Reddy, is not the
man who shot Officer Keyes," said De
tective Holland. "Of that we are certain
beyond the slightest doubt. We regarded
Reddy's story as very plausible last night,
but to-day every doubt was removed, for
Marshal Rogers and myself took the pris
oner over the ground from here to Hay
wards, and we know that from there ha
boarded the train for San Jose yesterday
morning. In fact the conductor recog
nized Reddy when we came up with him
as having been a passenger on his morn
ing trip to the Garden City.
"We learned at San Leandro that Red
dy had been seen at Charles Peterson's
sporting house and saloon in that place
last Friday night at about 9:15 o'ciock.
Mr. Peterson immediately recognized
Reddy as a man who had several drinks
at his bar during t-e course of a half
hour last night. We next went to Hay
wards. There Reddy pointed out the
Haywards restaurant and hotel, where he
claims he had supper and a bed Friday
night. Reddy remained outside with
Rogers while I went into the place and
inquired. One of the proprietors, Manuel
Cardoza, positively identified Reddy as a
guest at his house Friday night. He said
Reddy arrived there about lv:30, asked for
supper and the cook prepared him a meal.
Later he was given a bed, and when Car
doza locked up for the night at about
11:30 Reddy was in bed and asked for a
drink of water. In the morning the pris
oner had breakfast, went to the train and
rode to San Jose.
"I had my misgivings last night about
Reddy being the right man but his alibi
is so "clear and not a link in the chain of
his Ftory is missing, so there is no doubt
about Reddy's innocence on this charge
at least. I have no longer any doubt that
Officer Keyes arrested the wrong man
early Saturday morning. But who can
this man be? Surely no innocent man
would resist arrest to the extent of tak
ing life find it is evident that the man
intended murder. I believe that the un
known assailant must be one of the most
desperate criminals that has struck this
part of the country."
Officer Keyes rested easy all day, and
hopes of hi's recovery are brighter to
night; but he is still too weak to make
any statement, and It will be several days
before he will be able to give any clear
account of the almost fatal duel. Reddy
will probably be taken to the Alameda
City Prison to-morrow to answer the
charge of criminal assault upon the young
Shattuck girl.
Officer Keys is reported to have struck
his prisoner" on the head with his hand
cuffs but Reddy's scalp shows no marks.
Of late numerous burglaries have been
committed, and on tho night Keyes was
shot two burglaries were reported. It is
now supposed that the man Keys arrested
was none else than a burglar.

ONCE WEDDED TO AN ACTRESS.
Oakland's Exposition Manager, by Another
Name, Made History in Other Days.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 20.
Charles D. Gray, general manager of the California State Exposition of
Home Products, now being held in this city, has been the hero of at least
one romance. When the news traveled East that he was manager of the
local exposition It revived mauy memories among those who had known him
before.
One of his former acquaintances discovered that Charles D. Gray was
none other than the well-known theatrical man, Charles P. de Garmo.
In the New York Standard appears the following romance with Charles
P. de Garmo Gray as the chief actor.
To read of the statuesque Alma Stuart Stanley's recent comic opera triumphs In
London you would think her some new stage divinity who had suddenly burst Into
blossom. But if you are an "old-timer" and beginning to get a little shiny on the top
of the head you will recall her readily enough as a brief but dazzling sensation In
this town nearly fifteen years ago. The peerless Alma is no bud, but tolerably lull
When the English melodrama. "Youth," was first produced here and Alma strode
upon the stage In the Jaunty white flannels of a rakish young London swell, there was
a buzz of admiration that had swelled Into a chorus of adulation before the week was
over A more perfect goddess of a woman was never created than this elastic, buoy
ant six-footer of an English girl, aglow wifh health and vitality. She was Juno.

In magnetism and dramatic talent. But for six months at least the photographers

the present holder of the photographic champion belt, were ever depicted in such an
amazing variety of artistic poses
Suddenly this stalwart, superb specimen of womankind, actuated by one of the
Inexplicable caprices of her sex, married a little sawed-off chap named Charles P. de
Garmo, who had won something of a reputation as a "hustler" while acting as a pro
irrarnmer for Haverly's minstrels. Nothing could be more grotesque than the physical
contrast afforded by this strangely assorted couple, and after her marriage the Alma
S*uart Stanley craze subsided as quickly as It began. The couple drifted out to Cali
fornia and led a checkered career which culminated with the bursting up of a farce
comedy with the insane title of "Palntin' 'Er Red." De Garmo hustled to no avail,
even This inVnirVd I device of arrest for daubing the Lotta fountain with bright-hued
vermilion failing to catch the attention of indifferent Pan Francisco.
Separation and divorce followed hetween "the long and short of It." as the couple
were professional^ known. The peerless Alma drifted hack to London, where she
formed more aristocratic connections, and after many vicissitudes haa loomed Into
commandlne prominence. The little hurtler. who has changed his name to Colonel
Charles de Garmo Gray, 1p managing an exposition to be given this month in Oak

company for promoting expositions and fairs has organized successful affairs

to a wealthy San Francisco girl was stopped on the verge of the altar a few
weeks ago.

MME. MONTAGUE LEAVES.
The Oakland Seeress Denies That She
Has Revived Divorce Proceed
ings Against Her Husband.
OAKLAND, Nov. 20.â The friends of I
Mme. Florence Montague, the well-known i
lecturess of the Oakland Psychical So
ciety, assembled in force at the Oakland
mole yesterday to bid the lady godspeed.
Mate. Montague, whose health has been
broken down by the strain of a prolonged
course of psychometrical work, goes on a
long holiday to the East. Her many fol
lowers in Oakland and San Francisco re
gret the separation, but they admit that
it is inevitable. Madame's destination, in
the first place, Is Montreal, Canada, where
her husband. Mr. Yates, has secured an
Important position in connection with a
trans-Atlantic steamship company.
Just before her departure yesterday, Mme.
Montague explained that she was greatly
distressed at a report stating that she had
renewed divorce proceedings against her
husband. As a matter of fact the suit,
which was commenced three years ago, '
has long since been dropped, and the re- !
port doubtless had its origin through the i
completion of certain necessary legal
formalities in connection with the case.
Mme. Montague and her husband are on :
the most friendly terms, and out a year
ago, prior to his departure for Canada,
he spent several weeks at his wife's resi- :
dence on Broadway, Oakland.
"I wish it distinctly stated," said Mme.
Montague, "that 1 have no intention uf
obtaining a divorce from mv husband.
The past has long since been forgotten,
and I regret that it has been revived. The
relations between my husband and my
self are of the most amicable character."

MISS OLNEY'S LIFE
MOT YET CLOSED
RECOVERS FROM EFFECTS OF
MORPHINE.
The Young Lady Says She Was Pos
sessed of an Idea That She Had
Be r ter Die.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 20.
Miss Grace Olney, the young lady who
attempted to commit suicide at midnight
at the Weber House, was treated very he
roically at the Receiving Hospital, and
with such success that she was able to be
taken away by her friends this after
noon.
The unhappy girl Is 23 years of age and
lived with her relatives at Fruitvale. She
had been despondent for a few days, but
no one suspected that she was subject
to suicidal ideas. She is very well con
nected and is a relative of Attorney
AVf-lls Whitmore, who called at the hos
pital to-day and, with her mother, took
ncr home.
When Miss Olney recovered conscious
ness she said she was simply tired of life
and desired to die. She stated positively
that there was no romance behind her
desire to leave the world, and that the
letter she left behind her contained the
whole truth. In the note Miss Olney
stated that the future had no bright hopes
for her and she had nothing to live for.
CHEERFUL IN DEFEAT.
Stoddard Finds Fun in Reckoning
His Expenses.
ALAMEDA, Nov. 20.â T. C. Stoddard,
late Democratic candidate for County
Clerk, is cheerful even in defeat. He has
prepared his statement of expenditures in
compliance with the purity of elections
law. A vein of humor runs through the
document that gives evidence that Mr.
Stoddard looks on -the cheerful side of
life. He Is more than cheerful over the
fact that he expended a fraction over $400
running for an office he failed to reach,
and finds a bit of fun in nearly every item
of his account.
He had the experience of most candi
dates and had business dealings with the
politicians' bogie man, whom he refers to
as L. E. G. Puller. The nature of the item
is set forth as "leg"; the service perform
ed, â¢'elongation." and the purpose of the
expenditure, "saved his life." Puller got
$2 *0 out of the deal.
M. F. Tarpey of the Lnion Campaign
Committee was paid $125, and W. J. Bur
wen of the Independent Republicans $35.
Mr. Stoddard avers these amounts were
donations, but under the head of "service
performed" he has written, "Don't know.
From various stable keepers he hired
rigs. These were for transporting him
during his campaigning through the coun
ty. Specifying by whom the service was
performed Mr. Stoddard gives credit to
"a horse." The street car companies re
ceived some of the defeated candidate's
good money, but "R. R. employes and
electricity" are put down as those who
performed the service.
M. R. Skelly and M. E. O'Neal wero evi
dently engaged posting Mr. Stoddard's
placards. He states that the men, two
hammers and a paper of tacks performed
the service, and that its purpose was "any
old thine."
BAKES IS INDIGNA2.T.
Does Not Like Curtin's Insinuations
About Jury-Bribing*
OAKLAND, Nov. 20.â Attorney George
W. Baker is considerably aroused at the
insinuations made by Detective Curtin
that money might be used by Mrs. Wil
liams or Miss Loose to influence jurors
in the Nevills case.
"The suggestion that our side of the
case has a cent to give jurors or any
body else is positively ridiculous," said
Attorney Baker to-night. "All the money is
on the other side. My clients are two poor
women, typewriters, without a dollar.
They have no money to pay attorneys or
anybody else, and it is folly to even
hint that they would attempt to bribe a
jury. I think the insinuation has been
m;Â»dp as a counter irritant. On the side
of NovUls there is all the money desired,
nml he has made his boast that he will
win this case if it costs him $100,000. I do
not believe any of the attorneys he has
employed would connive for a moment at
any attempt to bribe a juror, but there
ar<Â» persons who allege that they are con
nected with the case in Captain Nevllls*
behalf whom I would not doubt are ca
pable of anything.
"I do not know a single juror in the
case, and the mere fact that one of them
met an old friend in the courtroom le, I
understand, the basis of the theory that
money is being used to influence jurors in
tho interests oi my clients, who are ab
solutely without funds. I do not think any
intelligent person will doubt for a mo
ment where any money might come from
that would be used to bribe the jury.
That is all I have to say."
INCENDIARY AT WORK.
Torch Applied to a Vacant Dwelling
House.
ALAMEDA, Nov. 20.â An incendiary has
been at work in West Alameda aud the
residents of that section are much alarm
ed. Several attempts have been made to
drstroy property there, but, fortunately,
the work has been crude and the fires
have been extinguished without calling
out the Fire Department. At an early
hour this morning, however, the fiend suc
ceeded In starting a blaze in a vacant
dwelling on Tnylor avenue, near McPher
son street, and the building was damaged
to the extent of $1000 before the flames
were* extinguished.
The dwelling was two stories, divided
Into four flats. It had not been occupied
for three months.
Investigation shows that this morning's
attempt was the second made to destroy
the 'building. In fact, people residing In
the adjoining houses have moved away,
giving as a reason that they had a pre
| monition that the building would be
I burned.
The property is owned by Mrs. Johanna
Kower of 2204 San Antonio avenue. It is
I fully insured. Mrs. Kower is at a loss to
| account for the fire. Chief Kraut h of the
Fire Department will make a thorough in
vestigation of the case.

MEIN MAY BE THE MINERS' NEW PRESIDENT
A Workhorse, but
He Will Be in
the Running.
Mining Association Will
Convene in Native Sons'
Hall To-Day.
FOR a week the miners have aban
doned hammer and drill to the drift
and the stope and have come to the
city to meet In annual convention and
discuss ways and means for the enhance
ment of the mining interests in California.
And, incidentally, they have gathered to
do a good bit of politics, for the fight over
the president's chair of the California
Miners' Association is a hot one. and the
aspirants to the vacancy that will be cre
ated by the voluntary retirement of Jacob
Neff are alreailv lining up their forces.
T'pon the matter of selecting a presi
dent the association is already divided
into three factionsâ the adherents of Ju
lian Sonntag, the supporters of A. C.
Ralston and a considerable number who
are urging the election of Captain
Thomas Mem of Alameda. So fax Sonn
tag and Ralston are the only candidates
who have appeared actively in the fight,
but the announcement was made yester
day that the 143 votes of the Nevada
County delegation were pledged solidly
to Mem. and if this proves true the cap
tain may be induced to withdraw his in
tention not to enter the lists. As Nevada
County is conceded to have the power to
either elect or defeat, the result of the
election is thus far possible of only a
dubious forecast.
As between Ralston and Sonntag the
wise ones are giving the best end of the
fight to the latter. Ralston for a time fig
ured as having the solid support of the
Alameda delegation, but the fact became
known that he was attempting to carry
with his own the Interests of E. H. Ben
jamin, who is out for the secretaryship,
and a number of his supporters have gone
over to the Mem and Sonntag lists on that
account. For some reason that cannot be
ascertained there is a general antipathy
to Benjamin among the members of the
association and Ralston's strength has
been greatly weakened by his effort to
carry him through.
This year's session bids fair to be the
warmest the association has seen since it
came into existence. Nearly every big
mine in the State is represented by either
one of its owners or its superintendent,
and they have come down to not only talk
but to work for a number of meas
ures of vital interest to the mining indus
try that have been hanging fire for sev
eral yt-ars.
The mineral lands bill, now before Con
gress, which embodies the old fight of the
miners against the railroad, is to be dis
cussed at length with a view to effecting
some immediate legislation and the asso
ciation is as equally in earnest In its in
tention to prevail upon Congress to create
In the President's Cabinet a department of
mines and mining. Debris dam matters
are also to receive due attention and it is
resolved to have something more than
fine speeches result from the year's ses
sion.
The delegations began to gather yester

John Downey, a Horse Trainer, Becomes
Suddenly Insane and Resents Being
Locked Up in a Room.
JOHN DOWNEY, a horse trainer
at the race track, became sud
denly insane yesterday morning,
and is now strapped down in a pad
ded cell at the Receiving Hospital.
Downey lives with, his wife at 982
Howard street. Their rooms are on
the first floor, facing the street. On
Friday night he came home and as
tonished his wife by throwing his
empty purse on the table and telling
her that he had been drugged and
robbed at the race track. After a
while he became rational and admit
ted that he had been backing the
wrong horÃes. Saturday night he
seemed all right, except feeling bad
about backing the wrong horse.

cut a considerable figure In the politics of
the session.
The actual business of the convention
will not begin until to-morrow. To-day
it will be called to order at 10 o'clock at
N. S. G. W. Hall, and the time will be
wholly given up to organization. There
are numerous proxies to be considered,
and the work or the committee on creden
tials will be by no means a small task.
There are two or three voluminous re
ports to be and disposed of, and all
of this matteV is to be cleared away be
fore new matters are even thought of.
It is expected that the election will oc
cur on Tuesday afternoon. The selection
of Mr. Neff's successor is paramount to
all other propositions. Never before has
the association taken so lively an Inter
est in its own politics. The president's
chair has been considered Mr. Neff's so
long as he has cared to sit in it, and to
morrow when the nominations are made
it will be tendered him again. He has al
ready declared, however, that under no
consideration will he accept the proffered
honor, and for the vacancy that he cre
ates there is to be the liveliest sort of
fight. Sonntag is confident; bo is Ralston.
Mem has declined to run, but there are
many who think that as a dark horse he
is the possessor of many fine running
points, and he is looked to furnish a sur
prise and possibly a defeat to both of the
working candidates.
breakfast and while they were pre- ~
paring to gro to church. Downey- be- *
gran to talk and act In such an ex- *
traordlnary manner that his wife Â£
got scared, and, locking the door on %
him, she went in search of a police- v
man. After she left Downey, find-
ing the door locked, dived through *
the window, carrying the sash with Â£
him. He alighted on his hands and Â£
knees, and escaped with a few slight Â£
cuts on his hands and scalp from the y
broken glass.
His peculiar exit Into the street, >
hatless and coatless, attracted a Â£
crowd, and as he ran along Howard Â£
street toward Second he was pur-
sued by about 200 people. His wife
was among those who observed him, *â 
and she ran to meet him. As soon %
as phe took hold of him he became Â£
quiet, and when Policeman Royston *
appeared he went peaceably with him J
to the patrol box and watted until thÂ«
patrol wagon arrived. His wife ac
companied him in the wagon to the
Receiving Hospital. After she left
he became so violent that he had to
be strapped down on his cot.
Downey's hallucination is that his
enemies have been coming from
Hades and giving him wrong tips on
the races, making him lose his
money.

gation that the latter officer has recently
conducted at Fort Baker. The report
went to Major General Merriam yester
day from the office of Adjutant General
Babcock. General Merriam has not yet
himself formally read the document, but
he is acquainted with its contents. No
official action one way or the other has
been taken In regard to this report. When
seen yesterday concerning the report
General Merriam discussed it and its con
tents freely with the representative of
The Call, and made some very pertinent
remarks concerning it. He said:
"I have the report on my desk, but I
have not yet read it, although I know
what is in it. You can say that it con
tains nothing sensational and that there
will be no court-martial. As commander
of this department I am responsible for
Its conduct and discipline, and when as
an officer I think that there has been a
breach of either my punishment will be
swift and without mercy.
"Prior to this investigation a report was
made by a board of officers on the camp
at Fort Baker. It was found to be a
model camp, the sanitary arrangements
excellent and the discipline firm. This
argues in favor of the officers there. I
know that some of the enlisted men are
in the habit of going to the newspapers
and giving tales of woe, but these same
men, when put on the stand and
asked to tell the truth, make
very different statements. The re
ports published in The Call have
been the facts as given b,v the enlisted
men, but these same men have toM very
different accounts under oath, and there
is no evidence to support the charges that
they have given to the newspapers.
"As an old soldier, one who has given
his life to the military profession, I claim
to know what I am talkng about. These
same men who are kicking have never
known the same comforts that they have
in the army. It is because they are be
ing cared for and disciplined as they
should be that they kick. It is contemp
tible for them to go behind their officers
backs and thus seek to attack them.
Much of the trouble that has been pub
lished in the papers regarding the treat
ment of the volunteer troops is the result
of the officers not knowing how to take ]
care of their men. Soldiers in the regular |
army under the strictest discipline do not
grumble because they have the principles
of the soldier ground into them, but the
volunteers have raised howls under iden
tically the same treatment.
"Regarding the reports that Lieutenant
Huie is short in his accounts at Fort
Baker as canteen officer, I desire to say
that such is not the case. His accounts
are correct and perfectly satisfactory to
the department and here the matter ends.
The public will be disappointed if it ex
pects any sensational developments or a
court martial. I shall do what my judg
ment dictates to me is the right thing to
be done, but there 18 nothing in the report
to warrant the punishment of the officers
a "Take for Instance, the grum/ling that
was done when the army was first en
camped here because the men sometimes
did not have supplies. It was because
their officers did not know how to make
out the requisitions for them. The regu
lar army officers here many and many a
night remained up to teach and show
them how to do so. The Government you
know requires that every button shall be
accounted for. and that in the proper way
and with the proper requisitions and
vouchers; and for a quartermaster to
have sent these supplies out without a
proper requisition would have been for
him to Jeopardize his pay for all time to
come. I cite this to show that there are
many things in the army of which the
civilian knows nothing. To be a soldier re
quires a special education. Men give
their lives to it. and when they die much
is left unlearned. You cannot bo a sol
dier in the fullest sense in three
months. . Â
"In the army and under the established
laws and regulations made for its gov
ernment an officer knows how to proceed
in all matters, and what the public may
think of him has not a feather's weight
of influence; and I, as the commander of
this department, know how to act prop
erly in this matter, and I intend to do so
without fear or favor."

ROTHSCHILDS
BUY MARIPOSA
MINERAL LANDS
Biggest Mining Deal
of Past Decade.
A MILLION IS THE FIGURE
44,000 ACRES OF MINERAL
LANDS TRANSFERRED.
A Deal That Will Mean the Deliver
ance of a County From Cor
porate Greed and In
fluence.
"With the coming of the miners yester
day came news of what is said to be the
biggest deal in mining properties con
summated in California in the last de
cade. By it the Rothschilds may become
the largest owners of mining property in
the State and the State become richer by
upward of a million dollars paid by the
agents of the London capitalists for
complete title to the 44,000 and odd acres
of mineral lands that comprise the old
ilariposa grant.
The agents and experts of the Roths
childs have been for the past year pros
pecting the mother lode from French
Camp to Fresno County, and have paid
particular attention to the Mariposa sec
tion, with the result that about ten
njonths ago they secured an option upon
one-sixth of the big grant, and since that
time have been negotiating with the
Mackay* and Hobart agents for the bal
,ance of the property. A bond has been
issued during the past week, and it Is
expected that work on a large scale will
be soon begun on the many valuable
rn'ning claims that the sale covers.
if the Rothschilds finally decide to
abide by their bond and pay the pur
chase price it will mean the deliverance
of Mariposa County. Ever since history
began in California the Mariposa grant
has been a millstone round the neck of
that section's prosperity. Taking up, as
it does, the larger part of the county, it
was for years non-productive in taxes for
the reason that no improvements of value
were ever erected upon it. Later, when Its
value as a mineral proposition was dis
covered and the large interests that have
Just released it to the London bankers
took hold of it and developed twenty or
more of its prospects, it was found an im
possibility for the citizens of the county
to elect an Assessor that would fix a val
uation on the improvements in any wise
commensurate with their cost. This state
of affairs continued for years. Road work
was stopped for want of funds, and the
county was at a standstill until the voters
rose in their wrath and put in an official
of their own choosing.
The new official worked like a charm.
Assessments were proportionate to
values, and in anticipation of the harvest
men were put to building roads and
mending fences. A new era dawned, and
it continued until it came time for the
groperty-owners to appear before the
oard of Supervisors, sitting as a Board
of Equalizers, and make representations
that their assessments were exorbitant
and prohibitive.
For the same reasons that had actuated
former Assessors, the Supervisors
thought so too, and despite costly mills
and valuable machinery they scaled the
taxes back to the good old figures and
the county went back into its trance.
Enough is known of the plans of the
Rothschilds to warrant the hope that the
new era has actually dawned. Electric
power plants are talked of, and mining
operations on a generous and business
like basis, and the good news of the past ,
fortnight has set the picks ringing and |
pumps working on old shafts all over the
county. .
The Mariposa grant is as rich in his
torical incident as in good red nuggets.
Its original owner was Don Juan Alvara
do who received it as a grant of pasture
land from Manuel Micheltorena, last of
the Mexican Governors. Alvarado "went
broke" before bis cows came home, and
he turned the property over to General
Fremont for a consideration of $3000. The
United States allowed Fremont to so
change the lines of the original grant
that instead of lying on the fertile plains
of the San Joaquin it was broken to pieces
over the points of the high Sierras, and
under the resurvey the Government con
firmed his title.
It took Fremont something like a year
and a hundred men armed with shotguns
to drive the miners from the property,
who had discovered rich diggings there
and reared themselves homes, when he
had succeeded in this he found himself
penniless and with a thousand or so bitter
enemies as assets, and his creditors took
the property.
They made better time down the finan
cial toboggan than Fremont, and the
grant finally passed into the hands of the I
Floods, Mackays and Hobarts, who hung ;
It as a heavy decoration around the neck
of Meriposa County, and Just now the
good people of that section are doing
everything but holding torchlight proces
sions at being finally rid of it, all sava its
history.
"THE AMERICAN ABSALOM."
Dr. Locke Warns the Young Men of
George Alexander's Stripe.
Dr. Charles Edward Locke delivered a
sermon last evening at Central Methodist
Episcopal Church on "The American Ab
salom, or The Fast Young Man and "What
Becomes of Him." based on the life trag
edy of Durie Heithter. The text was II
Samuel x\iil:22. "Is the Young Man Ab
salom safe?" Dr. Locke said in part:
"The young man of to-day Is the product
of ages of developing manliness and ought
to be a masterful giant. There are 7,000,0)0
young men in the United States, and they
are the custodians of the destiny of the
church, the home and the republic.
"I desire to address you concerning the
fast young man and what becomes cif
him. Absalom, King David's handsome
and talented son is a true representation
of the modern young man who rebels
against restraints, who is Irritated by law,
â who doubts and despises religion, and who
believes In nothing and nobody except Ab
salom. Loose habits and evil associates
are mistaken for Independence and influ
ence and the fast young man's progress
In wickedness is alarmingly rapid.
"It is fashionable to be fast. Many sa
tanic sycophants thrive on the extrava
gance and Indulgences of the fast young
man. Crime is licensed; there are open
doors for wrong-doing everywhere, and
the nervous, energetic, enfrenzied, flat
tered young man. deceived into the notion
that he can always hold the mastery over
his tastes and appetites, rushes forward,
applauded and feted by those who are to
gain by his speedy downfall.
"By licensed crime and unenforced laws
the nation is in a conspiracy against the
young men. The pagan juggernaut has
been put aside by an enlightened heathen-
Ism to be adopted by our boasted modern
civilization. In the cruel and diabolical
Invention of the drinking saloon with its
Infernal accessories. I know that the
rum traffic could not exist without the
young men for victims.
"If we would save our American Absa
lom we must legislate in his defense, and
paralyze the strong arms that are now
lifted for his destruction. The Inculcation
of lofty principles and the development
of true character are a young man's best
defense. Let young Absalom be saved
before he revolts; wild oats are not a nec
essity. Remember that the bird -with a
broken pinion never soars as high again."
