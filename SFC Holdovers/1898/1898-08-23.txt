MINGLING OF DELEGATES AT THE GOLDEN EAGLE HOTEL.
VOTERS CONTROL,
SAYS GAGE.
The Bosses for Once Will Not
Be Able to interfere With
the People's Wishes.
From the character of the men
who have gathered here in Sac
ra m ento as
delegates to
this conven
tion it is ap
parent that it
will be the
people and not
the bosses
who will be in
control when
o r ganization
is effected.
The voters
of the State,
through their representatives,
will see to it that their wishes
are carried out in the matter of
the selection of candidates for
the various offices on the State
ticket. This is as it should be,
and it is a condition that must
be gratifying to every one who
has the future welfare of the
State at heart.
It is my belief that this is one
of the years when the people of
the country will control the poli
tics of the country. This is
shown by the war just brought
to such a glorious conclusion. It
was the people's war and as such
its results symbolizes the suc
cess of the people in the cam
paign that is now about to be
gin. HENRY T. GAGE.
Charles Bassett of San Francisco, who
is one of the lieutenants of the leading
aspirant for the gubernatorial nomina
tion, was guarded in giving estimates of
Mr. Gage's strength on the first ballot,
but remarked tliat all doubt as to the
nomination of Mr. Gage had vanished.
Said he: "The people are managing this
convention and their will is to be regis
tered In the choice of a nominee for Gov
ernor. The people are coming to. Mr.
Gage of their own accord. There la no
SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY, AUGUST 23, 1898.
sign of a programme this year. It is a
Republican year by common decree of the
masses, and there is no mistaking the
fact that the voters are expressing a de
sire for the nomination of Mr. Gage. He
asks no one to support him. but all who
come to see him have an opportunity to
Judge for themselves as to his fitness for
the office. Practically the entire vote
south of Tehachapi will go to him on the
first ballot. He will get considerable sup
port from San Francisco. The Assembly
district delegations from the metropolis
are what may be termed unknown quan
tities, but the delegations are free from
boss control and will exercise the right to
vote for the candidate of their choice.
No, I cannot give you an estimate of Mr.
Gage's strength on the first ballot, but I
can give you an expression of my judg
ment that he will be the Republican
nominee for Governor."
The claret punch, concocted according to
the prescription of Dr. Pardee, refreshed
and inspired the Alameda delegation.
Bright and early the airy rooms of Ala
meda's favorite son were thrown open to
the thirsty of all counties.
The doctor, affable, genial and serene,
greeted all who were guided to his apart
ments. The suite is so arranged that pri
vate consultation roomsâ one to the right
and one to the leftâ may be entered from
the claret punch apartment. In one pri
vate room sat the smoothest worker that
ever graced a Republican convention. The
expressions "smooth as velvet," and
"smooth as salad oil." carry hut a faint
itiea of the smoothness of Guy C. Earl,
Ex-State Senator and confidential mana
ger of Dr. Pardce's contest for the guber
natorial nomination. Mr. Karl is smooth
at dawn, smooth at twilight and smooth
through- all the intervening hours. If by
a chance he ever makes a break, he can
recover, andâ as one of his admirers ex
pressed itâ "get next to himself" with
more grace and alacrity than is within
the power of any other man in the solid
county of Alameda. To his smoothness
Mr. Karl adds other qualities. He is self
contained, intellectual and progressive.
He appreciates the value of system in
politics, and obviously the systematic plan
of reaching out through an independent
executive committee to bring every dele
gate to Dr. Pardee's rooms is effective in
bringing the merits of the candidate to the
attention of the convention.
Another able and efficient worker in the
Alameda delegation is H. E. Wright, who
rendered such valuable service in the
Legislature toward securing the increased
annual allowance for the support of the
State University. What Mr. Wright may
lack in smoothness he makes good in abil
ity and sincerity. Dr. Pardee has many
other able lieutenants, and not least
among them are H. T. Dalton and Frank
C. Jordan.
The Alameda people are talkative, but
when they are pressed to name delega
tions other than the solid one of Alameda
that can be reckoned as supporters of Dr.
Pardee's aspiration to lead the party to
victory, they look wlSe and say nothing-
fYEb OPEN FOR
INCOMINQ DELEGATE ;
At Pardee headquarters It is said: ""We
are satisfied with the contest. Dr. Pardee
is receiving- assurance of sympathy and
support from all parts of the State. The
people are taking a deep interest in his
candidacy and expressing the hope that
a clean man, free from corporate influ
ences, and with a record requiring no ex
planation, will be the choice of the con
vention."
The strength developed by L. H. Brown,
Secretary of State, in his contest for the
nomination for Governor is a surprise to
several of the candidates. Early this
morning the guessers placed Brown third
or fourth from the top notch on the first
ballot. But new calculations are made to
night that he will secure next to the high
est vote on the first show-down. No one
doubts that Gage will lead on the first
ballot and many are confident that the
Los Angeles champion will get the nomi
nation before many ballots have been tak
en. Yet Brown's strength is regarded as
a perplexing problem and may produce
unexpected complications.
The claim of L. H. Brown that he will
have voting representation in thirty-three
counties of the State does not alarm the
supporters of Gage and Pardee, but it
keeps them guessing, where the votes will
go when the Secretary of State finds that
he cannot get the number required to
nominate him. Sonoma County delegates
talk of casting the full block of twenty
one votes for Brown. Butte, Tehama,
Sacramento, Sisklyou, Lassen, Modoc and
Shasta will contribute to the Brown vote.
Pardee's men and Gage's men are treat
ing Brown with the utmost consideration.
It is significant that a large number of
delegates from the abode of the Los An
geles politician paid respects to Mr.
Brown at the Capitol Hotel to-night. The
Pardee followers are equally concerned
about Brown's health and comfort.
Attorney General Fitzgerald is not
without supporters. Charles Post is
keeping a close watch of the situation
here. Martin Kelly is accredited with
having rallied fifteen votes in San Fran
cisco to the Fitzgerald standard. When
Martin Kelly arrived here Monday even
ing he was welcomed cordially by Judge
Post. The meeting at the train was ten
der but Impressive.
General John H. Dickinson is in the
field. He regards the condition of politi
cal affairs, so far as they apply to the
contest for Governor, a 8 badly mixed.
He has promises of support from other
than Marin and Contra Costa counties,
but has not yet determined whether the
reserves should be ordered to the front.
Thomas Flint Jr. of San Benlto says
very little beyond giving utterance to the
statement that he Is satisfied. He does not
give an estimate of his strength on the
first ballot. In fact, all the aspirants, ex
cepting Mr. Gage, are inclined to with
hold estimates of their strength. It is a
pure thing that there will be auite a scat
tering of the votes on the first ballot.
County favorites will get compliments.
W. S. Barnes, N. P. Chipman, Joseph C.
Campbell, E. C. Voorheis. George A.
Knight, L. R. Ellert and others may be
recognized in this fashion.
In the fine demonstration made by Oak
land youngsters to-night to boom Pardee
stock! the leaders called for "Three
cheers for R. N. Bulla of Los Angeies, the
next United States Senator from Califor
nia."
BROWN HOPES
TO BE FIRST.
Has No Fear if the Fight Is to
Be Free, and Will Support
the Ticket Anyhow.
I am making this fight inde
pendent of any combination or il
legitimate in
fluence. I am
free from be
i n g handi
capped by
boss influence.
I want the
nomination to
be direct from
the people,
because I
want to be
sure of elec
tion in No-
vember next.
One thing I am satisfied of,
and that is, if the fight is free
for all I will win the nomina
tion.
Thirty counties favor my can
didacy. Of this number I either
have the full delegation of each
or a majority of those who com
pose them. With all due respect
to other candidates, I consider
the fight for the nomination to
be between Dr. Pardee, Mr.
Gage and myself.
My record is an open book and
my strength with the people as
a vote-getter has been proven in
the past. San Francisco gave
me the highest vote ever given
a candidate on a State ticket
when I was before the people for
the office of -Secretary of State.
In my opinion the question is one
of availability, and the conven
tion will weigh and carefully
consider those in the field. I
don't pretend to say that I am
the only candidate who will win,
but I hope to be.
I am a Republican first, and
always have the wishes of the
party at heart more than my
own success. Whoever is se
lected it will be my duty to help
to elect him, and I shall strive
hard to do so. L. H. BROWN.

CALL, HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 22.â Out of the maze of as
pirants who are seeking honor from the
Republican convention, two men have ap
peared to-day with far more prominence
than the others, and with almost the cer
tainty of success' In their grasp. Unless
some new and very unexpected political
conditions arise, Henry T. Gage of Los
Angeles will receive the nomination for
Governor, and Jacob Neff of Placer will
be given the honor of second place on the
Republican State ticket.
The plan to force Gage out of the fight
by restricting the gubernatorial selection
to one of the northern or central coun
ties will not, it is believed, succeed.
While the scheme compels the man from
Los Angeles to show a strength equal to
the combined forces of his rivals, his fol
lowers are convinced that he will be able
to meet the issue. The greatest enthu
siasm has been displayed to-day in his
camp, and while victory has not yet been
won. nor conceded, the others in the race
are anything but confident.
The choice for second place is to Jacob
Neff of Placer. This selection has met
with instant and general satisfaction, as
Mr. Neff enjoys the distinction of being
one of the most popular and prominent
men in the State. It is considered that
the use of his name and influence would
give great strength to the Republican
ticket.
If Gage wins the honor that seems to
be now in his hands, the convention will
choose the nominee for second place from
one of the northern or central counties.
This is admitted to be a political neces
sity, and to the convention at large Neff
has appeared to be probably the best man
for the race.
It is the purpose also of the conven
tion to honor Neff still further. He has
been selected by the leaders as the per
manent chairman of the convention at its
opening to-morrow afternoon. Xeff is
known to be an excellent presiding offi
cer, and possesses the confidence of all
candidates and all districts in the conven
tion. As a permanent presiding officer
Neff would not as a matter of course be
barred from accepting the honor of a
nomination on the ticket.
One of the most important reasons why
Neff is to be signally honored is that he

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Aug. 22. â Doubtless there are
hotter places Than Sacramento.
To impress such a belief upon any
of the perspiring delegates here would
be lan] - Nobody seems to mind
beat much. Every brow is wet
with honest sweat, but politics is being
done just the same. No candidate is
38 that he is resting.
N rooter thinks he can yet afford to
stop shooting.
\\ b ge delegation marched
- with banners and whooping a
â¢Par'tee delegation lined up and
whooped as loudly.
But while the rivalry is keen It is
all good-natured. There is no hurling
of epithets, and if anybody entertains
the opinion that anybody else is a liar
he refrains from saying so. This reti
cence overlooks a precedent estab
lished by the unhappy Democracy last
week.
The interior of the pavilion remains
about as it was for the fi.rst conven
tion. A few decorations have been add
ed and the pictures of party leaders
have been replaced by a different set
of leaders. That of Washington re
mains, because both parties think well
of his memory.
The conduct of the second conven
tion, however, will V 3V 3 on a different
scale. There is more enthusiasm, and
it does not depend for its sustenance
on a forlorn hope or the scheme of get
ting a rival delegation ousted. There
is to be vocal as well as instrumental
music. The determination has been un
officially reached that when G hand
plays "The Star-spangled Banner"
some attention shall be paid the
fact. It is also planned to project into
the procedlnga and platform enough
patriotism to demonstrate that there
is some purpose in life beyond scram
bling for office.
Despite the fart that adherents of
the various candidates express confi
dence, the dispassionate observer has
no difficulty in realizing the inevitable
disappointment which must come to
one side or the other, and the possi
bility that none of the lightning rods
now prominently in view may draw.
Xo matter how lofty the declaration
that the choice of a convention will
be, also the choice of the defeated
minority, there is a savor *f bitterness
in defeat, and sometimes this advance
fervor of partisan loyalty oozes.
It has been noted with regret that
the railroad "push," as an indication
that the railroad is no longer in poli
tics, is on hand. Perhaps these gentle
men came for the purpose of guarding
against the chance that some of the
understrappers already here might
make a mistake, and, impelled by force
of habit, stray into forbidden fields.
Their purpose may be high and holy,
but a contrary opinion exists. It exists
to such an extent that the candidate
with the corporation behind him will
think a freight train has struck him
by the time the convention has com
pleted its operation of dancing on his
political corpse.
JACOB H. NEFF, the Placer Warhorse, Who Is Announced
for Lieutenant Governor.
By Henry James.
There are symptoms that the present
is not a railroad year.
Impressions one receives by floating
among the delegates vary somewhat
according to the part of the State the
delegates happen to represent, but
that there is a general spirit of buoy
ancy is apparent. That there should
be confidence is not strange, for the
fame of last week's convention, with
its bickerings, its personalities and its
absurdities would of itself infuse cour
age into the opposition, while the Re
pubi leans are here fc-r the purpose of
nominating a ticket and not to in
dorse a ticket nominated for them by
a party with which they have made a
pretense of fusing.
Among the many courtesies received
at the hands of Sacramentans was the
tender to newspaper men of tickets
good for a hack ride. This was done
in delicate appreciation of the fact that
newspaper men are often in a hurry
and do not always have small money
or the time to write a check. The re
porters made no extraordinary draft
upon this hospitality, only using the
tickets in case of emergency. The
managing editor of the Examiner was
different. He sent a demand for ten
tickets, which were given. Then he
took a long ride detained the hark for
half an hour and at last refused to give
the driver more than one of the ten
tickets. As a result the driver com
plained to the entertainment commit
tee, and the Lawrence shortage was
made good. But the committee failed
to manifest any ,sign of pleasure.
While the gathering is peaceful it
does not lack the military element.
General Dickinson is here. He wears
no clanking sword, nor has he brought
armed cohorts with him to be used in
amusing the strikers. He is handi
capped by the absence of strikers.
Somebody might create a Dickinson
boom by starting a strike and giving
the warrior a chance to organize him
self. Doubtless when he stepped from
the cars and looked about him his
mind carried him back to other days.
Once more he was in command, again
there was the tramp of soldiers as he
led them to victory or death or a place
where the foe couldn't get at them.
All this is ancient history now, yet
it would be a pity to- have it over
shadowed by more recen'. history.
There is a manifest tendency to talk
about achievements in foreign lands
and to forget Dickinson's achievement
right on the spot. Yet nothing done in
Cuba was equal to it. No hero in front
of Santiago ever wrested from fate
glory of the Dickinson brand. It is
unique. He came to drive the strikers,
and when he found that they were not
in humor to be driven, retreated with
a fearless dash. That was bravery.
Any other commander would have been
afraid of being guyed to death. He did
not stop to parley, but accepted the
judgment of the foe. Now he comes to
the scene of his triumphs, clad in the
j habiliments of civil life. He is sus-
I pected of being in search of a boom,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 23, 1898.
but has discovered no trace of any.
Such is the modesty of the true sol
dier.
Had he but come full panoplied for
war the booms and the boomlets now in
sight would have fled before him as
swiftly as the strikers did, anyhow.
Even now he might do something by
inviting the populace to the depot and
recalling to them the details of his vic
tory.
"Here," he could say, "is where I
tripped on my glittering blade. Here
is the place I stood when I told the
mob to disperse. Over yonder the place
I occupied after the strikers had told
me to disperse."
It would be entertaining and possibly
effective.
This is considerable space to devote
to a man not in the contest, but those
who are in it are at least casually
mentioned elsewhere.
It is a pleasure to note that the Ex
aminer proposes to print a report of
the convention. It was so occupied
during the Democratic shindy in be
stowing the blight of its favor that it
forgot to tell what happened. With
customary modesty it has caused to be
distributed numerous posters setting
forth its determination to lead a better
life and this time give the news. It
announces that General Barnes heads
its list of special commissioners. The
gentleman is a lawyer, a soldier who
has won renown in many a banquet
hall, and the greatness of whose fame
will not rest upon his incursions into
the fieid of journalism. Still, the se
curing of the gentleman shows that the
desire to retrieve the past is now whol
ly theoretical.
Another special commissioner, all this
on the authority of the poster, is de
tailed to watch the push and his friend,
"Collis."
Possibly both will bear watching, but
Collis is not here.
Another will "do up the feminine side
of the meeting." The threat is vague.
Why should there be a wish to do up
the feminine side? The effort to do
up the other side is in full blast, yet
the ladies might be spared.
The Examiner does up everything In
sight, but to boast about it is bad taste.
An explanation is promised. T. T. Wil
liams will "try and describe how things
are done." This is taken to mean that
he will "try to describe." There are
several others on the ground devoted
somewhat to the profession of writing
who will essay similarly so far as the
convention is concerned, but who never
thought to thrill the world by blazon
ing the fact in advance. If Mr. Wil
liams will go so far as to tell how some
thingsâ for instance, the Southern Pa
cificâare done, he will allay a curios
ity. He might portray the method by
which Coffey was done, and be certain
of exciting interest.
As to details of the Republican gath
ering, however, people will naturally
look to The Call as they had to for
Democratic particulars last week. It
appears to persons not overly critical
that the Examiner is making a vulgar
display. It seems incapable of making
any other kind. Since it has taken upon
itseif the management of the conven
tion the delegates may as well go home,
leaving their proxies to the special
commissioners.
At this writing there is the noise of
music and shouting in the street.
Either a delegation has arrived or little
Andy is here to guide affairs of the
party. He was a safe guide last week.
Every time his counsels were ignored
there was a mistake avoided. The way
to use him is to find what he thinks and
then think the contrary. By the way,
Andy did not get a place on the poster.
Probably there was no type in the shop
large enough, but even without him it
proclaims a veritable mass of genius,
justly proud of itself, shedding a be
nign intelligence and not carrag who
knows It.
To one who viewed the preliminaries
to the other convention the contrast
now Is striking. There was a quiet, al
most apathetic. The streets were not
thronged by animated crowds. To-night
all is bustle. Delegates walk and talk
excitedly. They buttonhole, argue, pre
dict. Messengers hurry hither and
thither. Headauarters of the various
candidates art. invaded by eager parti
sans. Before there were no headquart
ers, because the only nomination of im
portance had been made in advance.
Probably by to-morrow night some of
the aspirants will begin to question thi
wisdom of the longer paying rent for
their ambitions.
IN THE PAVILION.
Republicans Will Once More Attest
Their Loyalty to the Flag.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 22.â With a fitting back
ground of flags and the national colors
harmoniously blended, Agricultural Pa
vilion to-morrow will be the scene of a
brilliant and magnilicent spectacle.
As befitting the opening of a patriotic
body such as the Republican Convention
will be, the national anthem and other pa
triotic airs will be sung by a double quar
tet, composed of Miss lrma Fitch, Miss
Ella Howe. Mrs. R. H. Hawley, Mrs.
Frances Moeller, Jerome C. Carre ill. R. T.
Conn. \V. E. Lovdall and H. A. Crocker,
The delegates, numbering nearly a thou
sand, and the vast audience which will
grace the opening with its presence, will
show their patriotic fervor by singing the
familiar melodies that have been heard
so often during the past few months.
Every delegate will carry a small Ameri
can flag and, as the grand anthem is sung,
all will rise to their feet, waving their
flag as they help swell the sound. The
large band engaged for the occasion will
also join in the chorus and the sound that
flows out of the immense pavilion will be
an attestation that those inside are im
bued with a love of flag and country.
"America" will be sung first by the
double quartet and will be followed by the
"Star Spangled Banner." At the con
clusion of the latter air the convention
will begin the work of nominating a ticket
which it hopes will bring victory in No
vember.
Judging by the number of candidates
:il ready in the field the sessions will be
exciting and interesting. The nomination
speeches promise to surpass anything of
their kind, and the voting will surely be
close. The initial session will begin to
morrow at 2 o'clock and will continue
daily until the business of the great gath
ering is finished.
Levinsky for Chairman.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 22.â The San Joaquin dele
gates mot in caucus to-night and elected
C. M. Keniston chairman and Irving
Martin secretary. The delegation pledged
Itself to support Arthur L. Lrevinsky for
permanent chairman. Levinsky said that
he was in the fight to stay, and that he
would not withdraw unless it developed
that in party interests it would be ad
visable for him to sacrifice his ambition
to secure better results for th<> ticket
to be nominated. "I am in this light for
chairman," said he, "and I hope to. be
the choice of the convention. Should it
be, however, that for the sake of the
ticket I should withdraw, 1 will willingly
do so. I believe that I have an equal
chance with Jacob Neff. who is also men
tioned as an aspirant for the offioe."
Frank H. Short is not in the fight, as is
evidenced by the following telegram
received from him to-day:
"I am not a candidate for chairman;
have not intimated to any one I was.
FRANK H. SHORT."
Levinsky believes that with Short out of
the race he stands a fair chano- of be

NO S. P. MEN
TOLERATED
Railroad Plans to Cap
ture Two Supreme
Justices.
But Republican Leaders Have
Put Down Their Feet on
the Scheme,
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Aug. 22.â Aside from the contest
for the gubernatorial nomination there
are none that present so many complica
tions as that for Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court. The conditions that will
surround the selection of the two men
who will be chosen as candidates by the
convention for this position are so many
and varied that in the opinion of many
prominent Republicans the circumstances
of the contest for the coveted places will
have a material bearing on the success or
defeat of the party at the coming elec
tion. Since the delegates to the conven
tion have begun to arrive In Sacramento
It has become apparent even to novices
at the political game that the political bu
reau of the Southern Pacific Company Is
interesting Itself in the work of the con
vention and particularly in that part of
it that concerns the selection of the two
candidates for positions on the Supreme
bench. Some of the clerks and confiden
tial secretaries of the big men in the yel
low building in San Francisco arrived here
last evening, and since then have been
busily engaged in issuing orders to such
railroad henchmen as are members of the
various county delegations.
It became apparent to-day that these
orders related to the two places on the
ticket left vacant for the names of the
convention's candidates for Associate Jus
tice of the Supreme Court. It has also
been made known that the railroad wishes
to secure one of the places for T. B.
McFarland, one of the retiring Justices
and a candidate for renomlnation by this
convention. The railroad secretaries and
confidential men have not yet made clear
their preference â or rather that of their
superiors â as to which of the remaining'
candidates for judicial honors shall be
selected for the other place on the ticket.
This will no doubt come to light in due
time and will have Us effect on the
chances of all the contestants.
The attempt of the railroad company
to influence the acts of the convention
in a mater so important as this is being
condemned by tho men who ure looked
upon as the leaders of the party, as well
as by individual delegates from all parts
of the State. If this expression of opin
ion is to be taken as any indication of the
manner in which the names of the rail
road candidates are received when they
are presented to the convention the re
sult will not remain long in doubt. The
utterances of Major McLaughlin, chair
man of the State Central Committee, and
others, regarding the attitude that will
be assumed by the party toward any at
tempt that may be made by the corpora
tions to influence the campaign contrary
to the wishes of the people at large, and
particularly the voters of the party, have
been accepted by Republicans in all parta
of the State as a declaration of principles
to which every member Is bound. It is
believed that at least nine-tentha of the
delegates to the convention have come
here with a firm determination to turn
down any railroad candidates whose
names may be presented to the conven
tion. It is needless to say, therefore,
that the barefaced attempts of the rail
road company to influence the selection

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MK.N'TO, Aug 22.â Henry T. Gage will be
forced. If he wins the coveted first prize
of the Republican Convention, to display
a strength superior to the combined force
of nearly all the aspirants for gubernato
rial honors. The situation received to
day a most unexpected development, al
though nothing has occurred to indicate
that Gage will be unable to meet and
overcome the conditions. The other can
didates have agreed to pool their forces
for the time against Gage, and by a clev
er political trick force him out of the
race. If the plan should succeed the way
would be open for a scramble at least by
aspirants whose claims seem now to be
hopelessly overshadowed by those of
Gage. The plan of action which has sup
plied the politicians with gossip and has
placed the supporters of Gage on their
mettle was formed to-day in the camps
of Pardee and Brown. The scheme natur
ally received the indorsement of Fitzger
ald, Dickinson and all the dark horsea
that have a lingering hope of victory in
the battle.
The formulators of the plot propose to
force the convention to a test vote on the
question of geographical claims In the
gubernatorial tight. If the opponents of
Gage can win from the convention a de
cision that the nominee for Governor
must be chosen from one of the northern
or central counties. Gage of necessity will
be thrown out of the race. With this ob
ject in view the rivals for first honors
have agreed to unite, and, if possible,
of candidates for the two positions of As
sociate Justice of the Supreme Court are
not well received.
Even aside from the attitude of the cor
porations the contest for these two places
will be a spirited one and on point of
immediate interest may surpass the figh-t
that is to be made for the place at the
head of the ticket. So far as known there
are no less than fifteen candidates in the
field for the nomination. They are T. B.
McFarland and W. C. Van Fleet the In
cumbents. W- N. Clark and Waldo M.
York of Los Angeles. E. S. Torrence of
San Diego. J. R. Webb of Fresno B. T.
Williams of Ventura George B Cole of
San Bernardino. F. M. Angellottt of Marln,
Edward Sweeney of Shasta. Stanley A.
Smith of Sierra. A. J. Buckles of Solano
John C. Gray of Butte. J. E. Ellison of
Tehama and R. C. Rust of Amador.
A majority of these men are not con
sidered as prominent candidates. Of the
others it appears from present Indications
that the race is between Judge W . C.
Van Fleet and Judge B. T. Williams.
Both are well and favorably known
throughout the State. Judge Williams
chances are considered particularly good,
for the reason that it is generally con
ceded that the southern portion of the
State should have a representative on the
Supreme Court bench. His friends de
clare that he will have the support of a
majority of the southern delegation.

The scheme has been variously discussed
to-day and has constitut'il one "f the
most Important preliminary events of the
convention. Involved in the affair is a'.f-o
the purpose of having the conventi'
ommend that the I'nited States Benator
be chosen from some one of the Southern
counties. In this way it is hoped to di
vide even the followers of Gage himself,
although the prospect of doing this Is
conceded to be extremely small. If the
plan Is carried out as it has been outlined
and formed the first great test vote of
the convention will he made before the
gubernatorial contest has apparently been
made. All of the opponents of Gage real
ize that their chance of victory is not en
couraging as long as the man from Txis
Angeles holds the tremendous advantage
he now enjoys. With him out of the way,
the others would have a better fighting
chance.
Pardee and Brown held a conference on
the matter this morning and agreed In a
general way to the terms of their attack
upon the common foe. There was sor e
discussion also looking to the withdrawal
of either Brown or Pardee in favor of the
other in the event that either saw his
prospect of success lost. No understand
ing could be reached on this point, as
neither Brown nor Pardee cares to plaro
himself at present in the light of fearing
defeat. On the question of uniting against
the Southern aspirant, there was very lit
tle argument. The other candidates were
sounded, and found to bo really favorable
to the plot that may give GagV consider
able annoyance, as it has already occa
sioned his friends not a little uneasiness.

JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS
MAI BE MADE FIRST
Candidates Apprehensive of a McFarland
and Van Fleet Slate, Which
Must Be Broken.
CAU HEADQUARTERS. SACRAMENTO. Aug. 22- -In many counties
of the Stat, in fact, nearly all. excepting San Francisco. If Angeles
and Alaim-da-the contest for the Supreme Court is held to be paramount
to the strife for Governor. The delegates .supporting Buckles. Ellison.
ney, Smith and Angellottl are extremely anxious that the order of
ness In the convention shall provide that the Judicial nominations be
disposed of before the contest for Governor is brought on. An important
. caucus or conference was held thin evening â¢ with a ylPwo, ( accomplish
ing; this purpose. Tho friends of Judge Williams who hall from Ven
tura and Santa Barbara, did not join the conference, because they
â¢ red their support of the plan might imperil the chances of their can
didates success, but the delegates who did join in the movement assert
thai Banta Barbara and Ventura are In sympatny with them.
The judicial candidates are apprehensive that a slate has been made
with the names of McFarland and Van Fleet written thereon, and to
break this slate they are willing to join with the Pardee delegates in
tire organization of the convention. The only way they can see to smash
tho slate is to put the judicial nominations first. It Is believed that the
Southern Pacific Company would be d. lighted if McFarland should be
.nominated. The corporation has already made itself felt here, and it is
Ifnown that work is being done elsewhere to smooth the way for Mc-
Parland's retention on the bench.
Judge Van Fleet is not classed with McFarland as the railroad's can
didate, but nevertheless the advocates of independent methods in the
making of judicial nominations contend that the Supreme Court nomina
tions should be disposed of and settled in every respect before the bal
loting for Governor begins. The friends of Sweeney. Buckles, Ellison,
.Smith and Angellotti could put a stop to trading In some degree if they
could direct the organization of the convention. They also claim that
they could defeat a wholesale combine to elect two Judges and a
Governor, whose names are on the same slate. In the balloting for Jus
tic s. the friends of Pardee, Brown and Gage would be compelled to show
th-eir hands, and for their own good they would show clean hands fn the
judicial contest.
! promise should be made. The offer was
cie, lined because the delegates represent-
I ing the Good Government League do not
: want any half way measure. They have
' decided 'to overthrow bossism in Santa

isfied until that has been accomplished.

To the delegates Republican
State Convention:
Gentlemen â We appeal to you
on behalf of the Republicans of
Santa Clara County for simple
justice. The plain fact is that the
primaries recently held in Santa
Clara County were a disgraceful
farce in which frauds were perpe
trated and violence used to sup
press the voice of Republicanism.
Affidavits of the best citizens
of our county are in the hands of
the representatives of the Repub
lican Good Government League
of Santa Clara County to prove
the disgraceful methods adopted
by |the representatives of the Rea
or "gang" ticket at that election
to overcome the Republican
Good Government League.
These affidavits show by legal
evidence what is already common
fame and notoriety throughout
California, to wit: That the
Republican machinery in Santa
Clara County is in the hands of a
gang of professional politicians,
who are neither Republicans nor
Democrats, but who politically
are Bedouins of the desert, who
boast that they do not care
whether a man is a Democrat,
Republican or Populist so long
as he is one of their crowd, and
who, like the pirates of the high
seas, are ready to fly any flag for
the sake of plunder.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 28, 1898.
Some of the More Prominent Delegates Who Arrived Early.
PROBABLY GAGE
ONE BALLOT.
CALL HEADQUARTERS,
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 23,
I:3O a. m.â The indications
at this hour point to the
nomination of Henry T.
Gage on the first ballot.
The Pardee men concede
that Gage has made impor
tant acquisitions to his
strength in San Francisco.
Lieutenants of Brown and
Pardee held a conference
an hour ago on theselection
of a chairman, but did not
reach an agreement. Par
dee followers are discour
aged. They expected sup
port from San Francisco,
which did not develop.
This is not a squabble among
politicians, but an earnest effort
on behalf of the best element of
Santa Clara County, the tax
payers and business men to over
throw a system of political free
booting A\Jiich has worked a
deeper and*more lasting damage
to an otherwise magnificent
county than can be here detailed.
The contesting delegates are
not office-seekers. They want
no political favors nor places, but
they are- gravely in earnest for
fair dealing and honest county
government. Their effort in that
behalf in the recent primaries has
been defeated, not by the voice or
action of a superior number of
Republican voters, but by a
shameless resort to fraud and in
timidation made possible by hav
ing the machinery and the offi
cers of election under their sole
control.
They placed their candidates
for delegates as sole officers of
the election. They excluded
every other person from the
room where the officers of the
election and the ballot boxes
were situated. They committed
actual frauds and actually stuffed
ballot boxes, as was (failed by
the affidavits of some of the best
citizens of the county. Shall
delegates basing their rights to
seats of such a shameless primary
be allowed a place in this con
vention? Will you put the seal
of your approval on such meth
ods and uphold the boss system
in Santa Clara County? We ask
you not to seat these delegates,
but that you seat the delegates
named by the Republican Good
Government League, which ac
tually represents the majority of
Republicans in Santa Clara
County, but which by foul meth
ods was made to appear to repre
sent a minority. We ask this in
the name of simple justice and in
the interest of true Republican
ism, which is everywhere synony
mous with fair play and good
government.

Contesting Delegation.
SAMUEL TOMPKINS,

Rea is making a desperate fight, and is
willing to trade any place on the ticket
to secure the nomination for Secretary
of State for Paul P. Austin and have his
delegation seated. He went to the Fres
no delegates and told them he would
bnck tip Kirk for Superintendent of Pub
lic Instruction if they stood by him in the
convention. He next told the friends of
Black, who is looking for the same nom
ination that he was Interested in their
fight, and that he expected In return to
receive their help in the fight against the
Good Government League. He met with
poor success, however, for it soon be
came known that he was attempting to
play a double game, and that he has Pro
fessor c. w. childs up hi< sleeve for the
place. Among the Rea delegates is a
son of Chllds, and when he learned of
the deal he commenced kicking in the
traces and Rea desisted. If hi' had not
done so Childs would have started a row
in the delegation that would have result

"MENTIONED FOR THE EOARD OF
EQUALIZATION.
Republicans Confident That the Honest
Supervisor Can Easily Beat
His Opponent.
CATX HEAPQT T ARTERS. BACRA
MENTO, Aug. 22.â There if talk tn-r.ight
that honest John Lackmann. who made
such a clean record for integrity and
ability in the Board of Supervisors of
San Francisco, may be nominated in the
First District for the State Board of
Equalization. The Democrats have put
forward John P. Dunn, whom they re
gard (is a strong man, but the Republi
cans belieye that Lackmann can defeat
him. The City and County of San
Francisco alone comprises the First Dis
trict.
A very pretty contest is in progress in
the Second Equalization District between
L. C. Morehouse at Oakland, the incum
bent; Alex grown of Milton, Calaveras
County, and James H. Stow of Contra
Costa. Henry P. Dalton of Oakland is
also said to be a candidate, but he Is not
active in promoting- his candidacy. Brown
claims that a majority of the counties in
the northern part of the district are
pledged to his support. He has a large
number of friends who are hero actively
working in his behalf. These friends
say that a portion of the Alumeda dele
gation will support Brown as against
Morehouse. At present Stow's strength
is an unknown quantity, a fact that
leads to the belief that Brown will prove
to be the successful candidate. James
Stanley of Alameda has been added to
the list of aspirants.
George H. Arnold is desirous of secur
ing a renomlnation for the place on the
Board of Equalisation from the Fourth
District, but his railroad affiliations have
created a strong feeling against him. His
opponent for the nomination is Frank
Mattison of Santa Cruz. Mattison is a
popular member of the Native Sons and
has a strong following In the district. His
friends claim that his nomination by the
convention Is all but assured.
Jtorosco's Safe to Be Moved.
A force of men will be put to work this
morning moving the big nine-ton safe
from Mr. Morosco'a office on the first floor
of the theater building: to the second floor
to make room for improvements. The
safe is an unusually heavy one to be
moved, and It will be necessary to . ut

CAMPAIGN LIKELY
Congressional Elections
to the Front.
BOTH PARTIES ARE LINING UP
ISSUES TO BE PRESENTED TO
THE POEPLE.
With the Democrats Financial Man
agement of the War Over
shadows Silver and
Tariff Questions.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Aug. 22.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: Now that hostilities with
Spain have ended, interest in approach
ing Congressional elections will in
crease. Roth parties are later than
usual in lining up on the issues of the
campaign and indications point to a
short and sharp campaign in most dis
tricts of the country. Issues growing
out of the war will figure largely in
the campaign and the silver and tariff
questions will be thrown more or less
into the background, though the Dem
ocrats would build one of their princi
pal issues â that of the financial man
agement of the war â on their ideas of
free silver and greenbacks, as brought
out in the Chicago platform and in de
bates on the war revenue bill in Con
gress. They will criticize the Repub
licans for the bond issue and for the
war revenue laws, which they claim
weighs more heavily on the poor than
on the rich.
At the Republican Congressional
headquarters the indications at pres
ent are that there will be little discus
sion of the silver question unless the
Democrats force it to the front. Few
demands are being received for finan
cial or tariff literature, most of them
being for documents relating to "the
war and to Hawaii. The Republicans
are managing the literary part of their
campaign with considerable shrewd
ness, and most of the literature that
they are sending out to attack the
Democrats is made up of quotations
from Democratic speakers in Congress.
The issue of territorial expansion will
not figure as prominently in the cam
paign as might be expected, for two
reasons. First of these is that the Re
publican administration has not yet
clearly denned its policy any further
than as to the retention of Porto Rico,
and has not therefore given the Dem
ocrats an opportunity to take issue
with them. The second reason is that,
while the Republicans are tending to
ward expansion and the retention of all
territory taken from Spain, the Demo
crats hesitate to take an opposite
course. Another issue on which the
candidate will pursue his own course
will be the practical management of
the war.
SHOT WHILE PREACHING.
Dastardly Attempt on the Life of a
Georgia Missionary.
NEW YORK, Aug. 22.â The American
Missionary Association has received dis
patches stating that Rev. J. B. Fletcher,
a Congregational minister, and one of its
missionaries, has been shot while attempt
ing to organize a Congregational church
at Smiley, Ga., which is about twenty
miles from his home at Hagan, Ga. He
went to Smiley as the result of corre
spondence concerning the organizing of
the church, which he had been carrying
on for several months. While in the pul-
Sit he was shot through the window, his
r,dy being riddled with 117 buckshot. His
condition is serious, but it is expected he
will recover. The would-be assassins are
said to be colored officials of a Methodist
church.

SHARON COLLISION VICTIMS.
SHARON. Mass.. Aug. 22â In the ex
citement and confusion attending the
clearing- away of the wreckage caused by
last night's collision on the New York,
New Haven and Hartford Railroad, it
was reported that seven persons were kill
ed, four of them being mentioned as un
known. To-day it was learned definitely
that the total number killed was four, as
follows:
Franklin M. Waters of Somerville, book
keeper, Boston, aged about 25.
Mrs. Mary Fltzpatrick of Boston, wid
ow, aged 70.
Mrs. C. H. Frye, wife of C. H. Frye
of Revere.
Mrs. C. H. Bristol of Winthrop.
The number of injured is still unde
termined, owing- to the fact that many
who were hurt were able to go to their
homes for treatment, while others who
received medical treatment near the
wreckage were only slightly Injured. It
is thought that not more than twelve or
fifteen can bo included among those seri
ously Injured.
SENATOR BERT WANTS
A SEAT IN CONGRESS
Has Entered the Lists in Opposition to
Loud and Wolf in the Fifth
District.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRAMENTO. Aug. 22.â State Senator Eu
gene F. Bert has entered the lists in the Fifth Congressional District in
opposition to E. F. Loud and E. I. Wolf. Bert came up from San Francisco
on to-night's train In response to a request by his friends, and at once pro
ceeded to "mix It" with the others.
For n. starter Bert first paid his respects to the various gubernatorial
candidates, after which he rounded up his supporters in the San Francisc-o
delegation, dispatching trusted/ lieutenants to the San Mateo and Santa
Clara delegations to sound them as to his candidacy.
"Yes, I am a candidate for Congress in the Fifth District." said Bert
In the parlor corridor of the Golden Eagle, "and my friends tell me that
I have a good fighting chance. With two candidates opposed to me I, too,
believe I can come close to landing the nomination. I have not been able
yet to make a personal canvass of the San Francisco delegation, but I
have some good friends among them who will do what thej- can for me.
This is the way I look at the matter. I may as well be a defeated can
didate for Congress as to be re-elected to the State Senate. I have had all
of that I care for, and If I am not selected for the Congressional nomina
tion I have my law practice to fall back upon. But I think I can win this
affair. My friends tell me I can and lam going to make the best fight
for it that lies in my power."
SOUTHERN
MEN ARRIVE
Gage Boomers Gome in
Numbers, Solid for
the Los A Lge an.
Show Their Good Feeling To
ward the Rival of Their
Candidate.
CALL, HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 22.â The first demonstration
of the day occurred shortly before noon
when the train from the south drew into
the depot bearing eighty-five delegates
from Los Angeles. They were accompa
nied by nearly as many more politicians
who ay not delegate's, but quite as en
thusiastic Gage bowmen as the regular
representatives of the south. The coach
es, in which the Los Angelanos traveled,
bore Gage banners on their sides, while
the delegation brought a handsome silk
banner, which was borne In triumph to
Mr. Gage's headquarters.
Defiant of the withering rays of the
sun pouring down upon them the Los An
geles eighty-live, each one badged with a
glaring yellow satin ribbon announcing
their choice for Governor, formed In col
umns of twos and marched up Second
street to X, thence to the Golden Eagle.
No band nor drum corps preceded them,
but the delegates kept time to their own
incessant shout of "Gage, Gage, H. T.
Gage," stopping at Intervals of half a
block to wheel into line and startle the
inoffensive natives with ear-splitting
cheers for the southern candidate.
Arrived at the Golden Eagle, the dele
gation marched to the headquarters of
j Mr. Gage and broke up a conference be
l tween that gentleman and several north
j crn politicians. After each had shaken
hands with the candidate the crowd start
ed down stairs to "Whoop er up" for
their man.
Right here occurred a pretty little inci
dent that contrasted strongly with the
sullenness that marked every faction in
last week's gathering. It proved that,
however spirited the rivalry among can
didates and delegations may be, they are
all Republicans, and as soon as nomina
tions are made all strife will end and
every man will turn to and work honestly
and devotedly for the successful ones.
The Los Angeles people as they started
through the corridor passed Dr. Pardee's
! headquarters and quickly lining up before
I the open door gave three cheers for Ala
' meda's son. as sincere and hearty as those
they had given but a few moments before
for' Gage. Dr. Pardee was Immensely
gratified at this compliment and express 1
his pleasure in a few happy words. Then
the Los Angelenos went down stairs to
begin their part in the button-holing, ca
joling, handshaking and jostling.
The Los Angeles delegation caucused
this afternoon and decided unanimously
to remain loyal to Gage until he is either
nominated or defeated. The contest for
the Sixth Congressional District nomina
tion was also taken up, that county hav
ing two candidates in R. J. Waters and
Frank T. Davis. A vote was taken re
sulting in favor of Waters by forty-five
to forty and he was declared the unani
mous choice of the delegation. San Luis
Obispo, however, has its own candidate.
Judge Gregg, an attorney of that town,
having come to the front with the nine
votes of his delegation. As Waters will
have seven of the nine votes from Ven
tura it looks as though Gregg's candidacy
would get no farther than the CJoTden
Eagle.
The orange-ribboned men frnm the
south were out to-night to show their
good will to all tho gubernatorial can
didates and to emphasize their loyalty
to Gage. Headed by a brass band they
formed in front of the Golden Eagle at 8
o'clock and marched down X street to
Fourth, thence back to The Call head
quarters. Here the column halted, and
after a selection by th<-- band cheers were
given for The Call. Band and delegates
then entered tho Golden Eagle and pro
ceeded to Dr. Pardee's headquarters, and
a serenade was tendered Alameda's can
didate.
Somebody called for three cheers for the
doctor, and they were given with a will.
Dr. Pardfe thanked the Los Angeles peo
ple for their friendly manifestation, es
tablishing at once the most cordial rela
tions by his good natured remarks. Three
more cheers for Pardee. followed by thr^e
times three for their own man, and the
delegation, aenmpanied by Gage, went
across to the Capital Hotel to pay their
reS p e pts to Lou H. P.rown. That gentle
man was at dinner, so after pome music;
and a round of cheers the crowd went
back to tb<> Golden Eagle and serenaded
Thomas Flint Jr.
Gage called for cheers for his rival, and
after they bad been given the two can
didates stood arm in nrm while the band
played another selection. After more
cheers nil around the Lop Angeles men
disbanded their little procession and re
newed their labors in behalf of their can
didate.
JAPANESE SHIP CANAL,.
A scheme for the construction of a

plation by the Japanese Government. The
lake will' supply 4fi per cent of the dis
tance to be converted, and it is estimated
that It will require from ten to fifteen
years to complete the work, at an annual

PATRIOTISM AND WAR WHOOPS
ALAMEDA'S
DELEGATES
Left Oakland Full of
Enthusiasm for Their
Candidate.
Hilborn Congratulates Metcalf
on His Nomination for
Congress,
CALL HEADQUARTERS, OAKLAND,
Aug. 22.â 1t -would be a hard matter to
dig up enough county officials to trans
act any Important business before the
Republican State Convention has made
its choice for Governor. The doors of the
various offices are open, and there is in
most of the departments a minor repre
sentative, but political Alameda bounty
either packed its grip for Sacramento
la.Â«t night or has gone up this evening.
The purpose of this wholesale pxodus
to the capital is best told in a little sto
ry with which Clarence Crowell. the new
county committreman from the Fifth
Ward, entertained a Republican gather-
Ing last Friday night.
"Some time ago," said Crowell, "Mor
timer Smith, one of our members, had
a case in the Police Court. His client
had stolen a loaf of bread, and when
the Prosecuting Attorney had presented
the case tht-re was absolutely no feasible
defense to put forward. Realizing his
hopelessness. Smith said to his client,
'You must be crazy. When you go on
the stand you must assume a far awaj
look, roll your eyes around, :tn<l t" cv
cry question reply, 'Spoons, spoons
spoons,' each time a little louder and
raoro distinct.
"The prisoner took the stand, assumei
a far away expression with his eyes tha
seemed to center somewhere near Griz
zly Peak, and every time he was aknl :
question he replied in a vacant manner
'Spoons, spoons, spoons.' The fellow took
his part so well that after a few min
utes' cross-examination the Prosecuting
Attorney suggested to the court that i
was ver\- evident th>- prisoner was not
wholly responsible. The court met with
no better success in drawing intelligent
answers from the prisoner, and finally
dismissed the charge.
"As the prisoner was passing out of the
Police Court floor, Mortimer Smith over
took him, and suggested that it would
no doubt be a very pleasant task for hi*
client to pay him the fee he bad agreed
upon. The client assumed a look that
indicated his mind whs somewhere away .
oft" in the Sierras, and said very clearly,
'Spoons, spoons, spoons.' and no other an
swer could Mr. Smith get from him.
"Now. w<_- want to be like that dis
missed prisoner. No matter what any
one says to us or what we are asked at
Sacramento, we want to say and know
but one word. That word Is 'Pardee,
Pardee, Pardee.' "
This is th* 1 spirit that animates several
hundred Alameda Republicans who are
now around the Capitol. They know
nothing, and want nothing, hut Pardee.
<>n their hats and the lapels of their
coats they tarry that one word. This
afternoon "a lartce contingent of the Pon
dinki-s left this city all wearing broad
brimmed gray felt hats in imitation of
the doctor's, and also a broad golden
badge on which is printed in large let
ters "Pardee." The enthusiasm of some
.? â¢ tOuCiAN ~ HOLDS- : â  UP*""ThÂ£;
HAYs>eÂ£o DELEGATES
of the delegation is such that one of them
said jocularly this afternoon that it need
not surprise anybody if a few of the dele
gates should end their days bereft of all
power of speech but that represented by
the word "Pardee."
"Old Pard" Bassett has been injected
into this campaign against his will and
his dignity, in a morning paper yester
day a cartoon represented "Old Pard"
Bassett doing politics for the railroad at
the Palace Hotel. When Bassett saw It
the wire cage at San Quentin could not
have contained him.
"Every intelligent person should know,"
said 'Old Pard.' "that the Bassett who
waa doing railroad politics at the Palace
Hotel is Charley Bassett, ex-Harbor Com
missioner. When I ran the opposition
ferry to the Southern Pacific, Charley
Bassett was the one who fought us hard
est and tried to prevent us from getting
a depot in San Francisco. Then some
fool newspaper makes a picture of him
and labels him 'Old Pard.' This makes
me sick."
And Old Pard walked off, saying how
much easier It would have been for him
to beat Victor Aletcalf in this Congres
sional district than for Aubrey Jones to
perform the task.
Aubrey Jones, who will try to get a
complimentary vote in the Third Con
gressional District, is very anxious to
have it known that he is not a machine
politician. "I am not a politician in the
common acceptation of the term," said he
this afternoon. "I could not be a politi
cian if I would, and I would not if I
could. I am In the Congressional contest
in the Third District as the humble ren
rwÂ«ntative of the people's rights. We,
as a nation, are now confronted by that
condition which Abraham Lincoln * or( '~
â¢kruw and warned the people against. It
is the great common people against cor
porate monopoly. This Is the light, ana
1 am on the side of the people."
This is the third statement given to the
press by Mr. Jones since August 15.
i Congressman Hilborn. sent the following
message to Mr. Metcalf to-day:
"Victor H. Metcalf Esq., Oakland:
Permit me to congratulate you upon your
nomination as a member of Congress for
the Third District of California, "iou may
be assured of my loyal support. Â
SAMUEL G. HILBORN.
Mr. Metcalf at once acknowledged the
courteous favor and assured Mr. Hiloorn
of his appreciation of the kindly senti
ment and good will. This correspondence
forever sots at rest any talk of Mr. Hil
born making nn independent campaign.
The Young Men's Republican Leaeue or
Alameda County held a special meeting
at noon to-day and the following sixty
members w< re elected to go to Sacra
mento as the representatives of the
league to the State convention:

CATOR RENOUNCES.
The Bitter Pill of Fusion Will Force
Him Out of His Party.
Thomas V. ("ator, the leader of the
Mlddle-of-the-Road Populists, will vote
with the Republicans in the gubernatorial
campaign. This will be done to avenge
what ho terms "the attempt to sell out
the People's party." That is, If the courts
decide that the'Shanahan ticket is not
entitled to a place on the official ballot,
and in that event the rest of the Mlddle
of-the-Road contingent will follow Cator's
example.
Mr. Cator, before he became a Populist,
was a Republican. Since the Republican
politicians began to gather in the city,
Mr. Cator has boon very much in evi
dence and has been a frequent visitor to
Republican headquarters at tho Palace.
â  He confided to Intimates that his party
hud small hope of being recognized, and
in that event his vote and support would
go to the Republican candidate.
Mr. Cator said yesterday that ponding
the settlement of the issue by the courts
!he did not care to s;iy authoritatively
what course the Middlo-of-the-Ronders
would pursue. "Rut," said he significant
ly. "most of us are possessed of average
: Intelligence and should this attempt to
s nut bfÂ» succ s<ful we will know how
to got even. I know what I shall do,
and a good many others know what they
will do."
OUT OF THE RING.
C. S. Laumeister and T. J. Parsons
Have a Mix Up.
There was a row on 'Change yesterday
which ended in a momentary pugilistic
exhibition. C. S. Laumeister and T. J.
Parsons, both millers by profession, were
discussing some point of common interest
In the Produce Exchange, and they dis
covered that an agreement of minds could
not be reached. One told the other that
th</r>- was not always a strict adherence
to the ways of truth in what he said. The
did not deliberate long, but let his
list fly out. and then there was a mix
up. Friends separated the belligerents
and harmony was restored.

EX-SENATOR MAHER.
Announces Himself as a Candidate for
Congress From the Fourth District
Against Julius Kahn.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRAMENTO, Aug. 22.â Ex-State Senator T. C. Maher of San Francisco ar
rived on the last train to-night, and announced himself as a candidate for the Congressional nomination in the
Fourth District.
Maher, who is well known throughout the State, is at present employed as a deputy in the County Clerk's
office in San Francisco. He is of the opinion that he will be able to hold enough votes to defeat Julius Kahn,
who is also seeking the same political position. It is now considered certain that H. G. W. Dinkelspiel, who has
been mentioned in connection with the Congressional nomination, will not have his name presented before the
convention. Unless there is a change in the programme the Fourth Congressional Convention will adjourn after
organizing to meet in San Francisco to make the nomination.
WORKS FOR
HIS PARTY
Timothy Guy Phelps, an
Old-Time Republi
can Warhorse.
Now in Sacramento on Duty
Ready to Aid His
Friends,
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 22.â Near the elevator
landing on the main floor of Golden
Eagle Hotel to-day stood Timothy Guy
Phelps, who attended a Republican State
convention as far In the past as 1856, when
John C. Fremont was the Idol of tho
party and the candidate against James
Buchanan for the Presidency of the
United States.
Mr. Phelps studied the animated throng
of delegates with a curious Interest that
one could observe in the strongly marked
character lines of his face. No doubt he
reflected that a generation of leading
men had entered public life and passed
away sineÂ© he began to concern ..imself
In the political affairs of California. He
mused, no doubt, that some of the young
men, proclaimed by the badges to be
candidates for Governor, were unborn
when his voice was first raised In the Re
publican councils of California. The old
timers knew Mr. Fhelps by name, but
the youngsters' knowledge of the man did
not go beyond what they had read of his
public career. , , '
In ISo7 he served in the Legislature as
Assemblyman from San Francisco. He
served in the Senate In ISSB-59-bO-61. He
was a Representative in Congress from
California from 1861 to 1563. In 18&Â» he was
appointed Collector of the Port of San
Francisco. Now he Is a Regent of the
University of California and a delegate to
this convention from the county of San
Mateo. Thirty-nine years ago, in 1859, he
attended a State convention In Sacra
mento. In that year 150 delegates as
sembled at the First Congregational
Church in this city. He was then a can
didate for the gubernatorial nomination,
but withdrew in favor of Leland Stanford.
In company with E. D. Baker D R. Ash
lev, Samuel Bell and F. M. Pix ley.
In 1860 T. G. Phelps was a vice-chair
man of the Republican Convention which
met in San Francisco in January 20 of
that year to select delegates to the his
toric "convention at Chicago which nom
inated Abraham Lincoln for President.
Subsequently, while serving in ( ongress,
he met Mr. Lincoln on many occasions,
and enjoyed the confidence and high re
gard of the great President.
At the State Republican Convention held
in this city June IS, 1Â«61, when 250 dele
gates assembled, Mr. Phelps was again a
candidate for Governor wtth Stanford as
his chief opponent. The nominating bal
lot was 197 for Stanford, and 104 for
Phelps. â,
At the Union District Congressional
Convention held at San Jose June 10, 1867,
Mr Phelps was nominated for Congress.
At the Republican State Convention held
in this city June 10. 1575, Mr. Phelps was
nominated for Governor without opposi
tion but was defeated at the election the
following September by William Irwin,
the Democratic nominee.
â¢In 1579 Mr. Phelps was nominated for
Railroad Commissioner. In IRRB he served
on the committee on platform and reso
lutions of the convention which sent dele
gates to the national convention. Tho
same year he was nominated for Congress
in the Fifth District and only lacked a
few votes of winning. His opponent,
Thomas Jefferson Clunie, won by a major
ity of less than fifty.
Mr Phelps gained grand distinction for
his loyal and unyielding support of the
Union cause in the Legislature of IS6I.
He was the author and able advocate of
the famous Union resolutions. He served
with -credit as Collector of the Port of San
Francisco. In the Board of Regents he is
rated an a man of superior ability.
ANTI - CIVIL SERVICE.
The League Sends an Address to the

The following circular has been sent to
the Republican State Convention:
The Republican Antl-Civll Bervice League of

READY FOR
THE FRAY
The Local Force Leave
for the Scene of
Battle.
Men With Political Hopes and
Men With the Joy of
Fighting Within Them.
At least a ton of political hopes and as
pirations embarked on the two afternoon
trains for Sacramento yesterday. The
members of the local delegation shook
the dust of this city from their heels
amid whisperings full of Import and silent
schemes that were lodged deep in the
minds of the wise ones.
Jesse Marks, in beautiful raiment, did
enough canvassing on the boat to elect
an entire ticket. Dan Cole, with his chin
whiskers and his medieval smile, looked
on as a spectator from afar. Ed Wolf
and Julius Kuhn, with Congressional bees
in their bonnets, wasted not a minute
but plied the political hand from the
ferries u> the landing on the other side.
With them was Henry George Wash
ington Dlnkelsplel, another aspirant for
soTonlc honors. Harry N. Gray and Pat
Lannon, who is looking out for County
Clerk Curry at all times; and Sam Short
ridge, with his silk tile and Senatorial de
mentia, exercised the glad hand with
wonderful effect. Frank Grimes, Barney
Tracey and George Walker, a trio that
cast resplendent rays over the entire bay,
forgot the Maine for the moment and did
politics and were happy.
The country delegations left the city in
the morning, shoutinr ior at least a quar
tet of gubernatorial candidates, with the
name of Gage ringing out above the rest.
Everybody was crying for somebody or
other and wanting to know why there
was not unanimity. Candidates were
scheduled from the State .Printer up to
the Governor; slates were formed that
will be broken and reset a dozen times
before the wise men reach the Capitol,
and the struggle of the next few days
was fought out and tabulated in the ar
chives. The name of George Knight was
heard frequently; then Brown, then Es
tee, and linally r*ardee, was Placed in the
chair that commands a view from Del
Norte to San Diego.
The local contingent prepared for three
things particularly: The heat, both of
convention ana weather; a hard battle
and an unquenchable thirst, the latter be
ing given opportunity- to develop by the
warm arguments In which all indulged.
The parting words of Jesse Marks sum
up the situation: "Thank God, we are
well fortlflfd in spirit and inclination, and
it will pro hard if success does not meet
our combined efforts for everybody and
everything,"

Organize for the Campaign.
The Republicans of the West End of the
Thirty-seventh District, at a meeting held
last evening in Kirchner's Hall, organized
for the campaign and appointed the fol

constitute the executive committee are
Thomas G. Eggert, Louis Glass. W infield
Scott, J. G. Steele. M. N. Dodge, Walter
Douglas and Max Knaur. The total
membership recorded at the meeting Is
eighty-five. It is proposed by the direc

immediately after the State Republican
Convention" at Sacramento, and present a
number of able speakers to address the
members on the course to be pursued dur-j

Women of the Press.
The August social meeting of the Pa
cific Coast Women's Press Association
was held in Shasta Hall. Native Sons
building, yesterday afternoon. A large
audience was present, and the pro
gramme, under the direction of Mrs. Sara
E. Reamer, was greatly enjoyed.
Informal talks were given by several
members concerning different foreign
countries whicn they have visited, and
these talks were interestingly illustrated
by the exhibition of collections of cu
rios anu photographs.
Mrs P L. Dickinson, ex-presldent of
the association, told of Japan, where
she resided for some little time.
Mrs Maria Freeman Gray spoke of the
Hawaiian Islands; Mrs. S. E. Reamer of
China, and Mrs. E. M. North of Norway.
A charmingly rendered recitation by
Miss Augusta Frederlchs of Alameda,
and an original poem, "Life Is Too Short

Alameda City's Inde

to Dr. Pardee.

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 22.â The concessions made
by Dr. Pardee to some of the Alameda
County delegates are becoming fully ap
parent. The claim set up by the doctor's
supporters that he had captured the so
called independent delegates from Ala
meda City is only true in part. Those
nine delegates are here and they will vote
for Pardee on the first ballot and as much
longer as they think he is in the running,
but they are not pledged to him by any
means, nor do they want the impression
to go abroad that they are. They are in
dependent in every sense of the word â
such Is their open declaration â and the
only flght they have on hand is that for
the welfare of their city and county.
It is a source of no inconsiderable an
noyance to the out and out Pardee shout
ers that the nine Alamedans have so far
refused to decorate themselves with the
Pardee badges, wearing instead a broad
white satin ribbon bearing in scarlet let

claim for the doctor, all of which is
marked by the watchful friends of the

This is the way one of the Encinal City
delegates put ft this afternoon: "We
put our own money into the primaries
and won out without any aid from Dr.
Pardee or his assistants. Naturally, we
are for an Alameda man, and we will sup
port Pardee just as long as we think he is
In it; not as long as he thinks so. There
are no strings to us and we are at liberty
to vote for whom we please and when
ever we choose. Our first interest is for
Alameda City and then for our county.
We will caucus some time before the
convention assembles, and will probably
decide tuen whom we will support for the
subordinate places on the ticket. So far
we have given that matter no considera
tion, and we are not letting anybody else
do our thinking for us.
"If, at any time, we reach the conclu
sion that Pardee has no chance of win
ning out, we do not propose to gain any
body's ill-will by holding out for him to
the last." _____________

James G. Maguire will leave this city
for Los Angeles Thursday night in order
to be present at the Silver Republican
convention which opens in that city on
Saturday. Muguire hopes to annex this

patch on the already much-sewed suit.
The convention in Los Angeles will not

an hour or so. civerj man carried a small
American flag, and, escorted by a band,
marched from the train to the Golden
Eagle, illuminating X street on the way
with Roman candles.
Wheeling into Seventh street, the Ala
medans halted under Pardee's window
and cut loose a varied assortment of yells
and songs calculated to express their
fealty to the Doctor.
Pardee appeared at the window and, in
response to calls for a speech, said that
mere was only one speech to make on
such an occasion, and that was to "come
upstairs." The invitation was accepted
with a rush, and almost instantly the cor
ridors of the hotel were filled with strug
gling, shouting, perspiring Alamedans.
After paying their respects to their own
man, the Alameuans emulated the exam
ple set by the Los Angeles men earlier in
the evening, and set off on a tour of the
various headquarters.
Dr. Pardee led the way. first to Thomas
Flint's rooms, that gentleman being
greeted with cheers and music. Thence
the crowd surged to where Gage has head
quarters, and Dr. Pardee called for three
cheers for the southern leader.
Royally the-- were given, but the Ala
medans immediately copnered the display
of good feeling by adding three more
cheers for Bulla. well knowing that any
demonstration on behalf of that gentle
man was an Indirect slap at Gh.K*. for. of
COtUjSe, the indorsement of Bulla for Sen
ator would put Gage out of trfe guberna
torial fight. It whs not much, but it left
a nasty impression with the southern
men. and certainly it was not in keeping
with the sincerely cordial expressions of
the Los AngÂ»lenos for Pardee.
The Alamedans next moved over +o the
Capitol Hotel with thetr band and paid,
their respects to L. H. Brown and Attor
ney General Fitzgerald, both of whom
have their headnuarters in that hotel.
Neither of those gentlemen was in his
headquarters, and the Alamedans brought
the parade to a dose.
THE MAYOR WEAKENS.
Signs the Street-Paving Contract
With a Doubtful Proviso.
Mayor Phelan states that he will sign
the contract recently awarded by the
Board of Supervisors to the City Street
Improvement Company for repaying and
repairing bltuminized streets. He ha's ar
ranged, however, that the list of streets
and crossings to be repaved shall be ma
terially altered and that unnecessary
work shall not be done, but other streets
substituted undor the contract. Some
days ago The Call pointed out the fact
that many of the streets mentioned in me
proposals for bias did not need repaying.
The "Mayor thereupon made an investiga
tion and found the facts to be as stated.
When the Super%'isors met to rush
through the contract he Interposed objec
tions, claiming uiat some of the work pro
posed was unnecessary- The board, nÂ»w
ever, did not see fit to advertise for new
bids on revised specifications, and the
Mayor then decided to ask the contractor
as to what would be done about paving
such streets as might be substituted for
those mentioned in the specifications as
needing repaying. "The contractor told
me," said Mayor Phelan to a Call report
er, "that any substitution of streets or
crossings that might be suggested by the
Superintendent of Streets, or the commit
tee on streets, would ue satisfactory to
the paving company, i hereupon I decid
ed to let the contract go through by sign
ing the papers."
The question as to whether the con
tractor could be held under his bond to
submit to any alterations in the contract
Is one which may have to be settled at a
later date.

dom from railroad domination is known
from one end of the State to the other
and will be used by the convention to in
dicate its own position.
While Neff and Gage have naturally
-engaged the attention of most of the
delegates to-day, they are not the only
candidates who are forcing themselves
in advance of their rivals. There is
hardly a county delegation in, the State
that has not a candidate to present or
some concession to demand. Trades of
all sorts and of varying importance have
been made to-day.and as a result some
of the candidates have made combina
tions that will probably mean victory.
Among those who have forged far
enough ahead to look like winners is
Thomas J. Kirk of Fresno, who is seek
ing the nomina..on for State Superintend
ent of Public Instruction. His delegation
is making a strong canvass, and seems
to be well in the lead toward victory.
Another of the aggressive candidates who
is credited with having very much the
best of the situation is George \V. Root,
who seeks the nomination for Clerk of the
Supreme Court. Root has many powerful
friends behind him and will probably win
the day.

Their Friend.
Express Deep Regard for Admiral Miller, Who

Consideration.
BY HORACE WRIGHT.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, Aug. 16.â Hawaii sends
her first greeting to her fellow citizens
across the seas. Happily It is one of
peace and tranquillity, for no unpleas
ant episode arose to disturb the solem
nities attending the marriage of this
emerald gem of the Pacific to the giant
republic of the western hemisphere.
There were tears shed and there were
such wrenches of the heart as come to
all once or twice in a lifetime to re
mind us that we are but transients,
born of sorrow and nourished in diffi
culties, and that politics and patriotism
often temporarily sever the links of
friendship to knit the heart chords
more closely together in the future.
The native Hawaiians, with but very
few exceptions outside of the large
â¢number of Government employes, ab
sented themselves from the actual cere
mony of the transfer of the sovereignty
of the Hawaiian Islands to the United
States, but in the evening they flocked
by the thousands â men, women and
children â to the former palace and its
beautiful grounds to delight in the
peace-making illuminations and pyro
technics. Their woe and grief had, on
the surface, passed away as April
showers over a spring picnic. They are
still sore at heart, however, for they
do not nor will they for some time, un
derstand or appreciate the cau?e of or
the necessity for the change of i!ag.
They accept the conditions with per
plexity.
"Here is," say they, "the same Gov
ernment and the same men who rule
i's; the same name, 'the republlr of
Hawaii,' but another flag, and that is
the only change we see. The American
ships and sailors are the same as ever,
and the American soldiers going to
fight the Spaniards don't fight us. but
become as good friends as all of the
good "hades' (foreigners). Why theu
take our flag away and say you have
taken our land when we see no
change?"
They are beginning to understand,
however, even in the few short days
that have passed since the destruction
of their nationality, that America
wishes to be their true friend and not
their cruel taskmaster, and that sbe,
more like a mother than a father (for
the maternal instinct is stronger in this i
lanr* where descent was traced through ,
the mother), opens her arms to welcome '
them as her children and to give tnem
: rights and privileges they have never j
yet thoroughly enjoyed. Let It ever be i
â  remembered, when their hesitancy "to
come into the fold" is considered, that j
it was the same "missionary" element
that procured annexation as taught
them their alphabet, clad their golden
bronze and sinewy limbs with unac
customed and inconvenient garb, de
' spoiled them of their Innocence, their
true life and spirits and tabooed all
their wholesome and interesting games,
sports and pastimes. No child ever felt
pleased with his first day and night "at
â¢ his first school away from home inilu
enÂ« fs. Our Hawaiians are experiencing
the same sensations, and kindly Time,
;*s with the school boy, will lead tc
closer friendship and esteem.
No man has ever wrought so much,
and so quietly and beneath the stream,
to bring about a frankly cordial feel
}ng of friendship between the Hawai
. ians and the Americans as Rear Ad

MILITARY ROADS IN CUBA.
General Roy Stone, formerly the road
fxpert of the Agricultural Department.
.' arid now on tho staff of Major General
â¢Miles, has undertaken to solve the
problem of road building in Cuba In a
â¢ niarfual Issued for the use of the Fed
â¢ â¢eral troops operating on the island.
. Except In the immediate vicinity of a
. few of the larger cities, and for about
forty miles eastward and westward
from Havana, there are no roads in
Cuba which could be used by a military
.'. force in the transportation of troops,
supplies and artillery.
General Stone's manual gives In
structions for the construction of prac
ticable and solid roadways, the founda
tion being fagots or fascines of guava
â¢ -bushes, which grow in luxuriant profu
sion. throughout the island. Roads built
on this plan, It is affirmed, axe better
their birth land and its flag. To him, ,
personally, they claim, is due the busi- i
nesslike simplicity of the function and j
the marks of kindly respect shown to j
their Irrevocably lost flag and inde
pendence. The admiral in all his trans- I
actions with them, in all his conver- |
sations and advice, has made them feel ;
that he is their friend. You can guide
a Hawaiian by friendship, where other
wise he would sulk in his tent and be
come a nuisance, hiding his intelligence
in assumed cross stupidity.
It is too soon to assert at present
the course the Hawaiians will pursue
before the Congressional Commission,
although it is almost safe to predict â ,
that they will, if not spontaneously,
then only rather reluctantly, recognize J
the fact that they are American citi
zens, and that as are their dispositions |
so will privileges be conferred upon !
them. So far, the very large number I
of Hawaiian employes in all branches j
of the Government have almost unan- j
imously taken the oath of allegiance to :
the United States. A few, a very few, |
momentarily hesitated.
It should be understood that in all
official, including judicial, proceedings <
peculiar though it strikes us all. and |
more especially the natives, we are
still the "Republic of Hawaii" (and ex
pect to be such until January, 1900),
and there has been no change in the |
officials, their duties or their titles, ex
cept that the Minister of Foreign Af
fairs is shorn of his diplomatic funo- ;
tions and will have more time to attend
to his duties as Minister of Education,
a position which he fills with credit to j
himself and the cause of education.
It must be admitted that there is
hard work to be done to bring the Ha
waiians into line for their own benefit,
for not only does there linger in the j
minds of many, especially among the '
elders, the impression that the flag has i
only been raised until the war with j
Spain is over, and that then It will !
again be replaced with the Hawaiian, i
as in the days c/f Admiral Thomas in
1843 and President Cleveland in 1893,
and that the Democrats may undo
what the Republicans have done, but
also that many of their anti-annexa- i
tion leaders are Instructing them that
the greater opposition they make to the
involuntary alliance on their part the
greater consideration will be shown to
them. A thorough investigation, how- i
ever, leads me to think that the vast
majority of them will accept the situa- j
tion In the firm hope that Admiral Mil
ler will, as a semi-divine tutelary,
lead them into the pleasant paths and ,
ways of peace.
It is difficult to correctly ascertain i
the intentions of the Portuguese, for
the information obtained Is directly
contradictory- It may be predicted j
that they will patiently await the ver
dict of the Congressional commission. \
for there are but comparatively few
naturalized Hawaiians citizens, al- |
though a large number of "special :
rights citizens" (men who assisted in |
the revolutions of 1893-95), whose posi
tion in the political modus vivendl has
to be determined. It is possible that a
large number will leave the country if |
the new conditions do not prove satis
factory, but on this subject they are |
reticent.
Now that Hawaii Is actually a por- i
tion of American territory and her \
citizens are co-citizens with yours, it !
will be only kind to remember that
Hawaliana are not uncivilized, unclad, ,
illiterate pagans, and that they have
no connecting link with the African j
negro. On the contrary, in many
things, nay most, that are presumed !
to be the exclusive property of western
civilisation, they are head and should
era above many more pretentious
places, and as regards the 'Three R's' â 
the percentage of literates over illiter
ates is greater than In any country in
the world, the United States herself not j
excepted. If you desire also to enjoy ,

than the ordinary corduroy road, the !
bundles of bushes parking together as j
solidly as a compressed bale of hay or
cotton. The fascines are laid length
wise, one bundle overlapping the other !
like shingles, and all are bound to
gether and covered with a thin layer of j
earth. The construction of roadways i
on this plan will probably be one of the !
first undertakings of Shatter's corps of I
engineers, since without such efficient i
aids in campaigning the movement of
heav- siege guns would be practically
impossible in the vicinity of Santiago â

HIS BUSINESS INSTINCT.
One of the brightest traveling salesmen
in modern commerce was thinking se
riously of going to the war.
"You see." he was saying to the old
military man whose stories of adventure
and achievements had kindled his ambi
tion. "I have had experience in every
branch of trade that amounts to very
muih except fighting.
"I have sold nails, barbed wire, cigars
dry goods, paper, paints, oils and a num
ber of things. Now, it strikes me that I'd
like to handle load for the Government
awhile."
"You would have to undergo a good
many hardships," remarked his friend.
"J don't '-are. I am not marriedâno
body but myself to think about, and I'd
like to see if I can't do something. But
I'm willing to take my chances at getting
a monument some day, with the rest of
them."
"Of course, you would want to go as an
officer," remarked the old military man.
"I'd like to. But If I found It couldn't
be arranged I wouldn't stay away for that
reason."
"Young man. I like your spirit. Any
thing I can do fnr you I will gladly under
take. I'll sec if It can be arranged for
you to have a commission."
The salesman looked startled.
'No." he exclaimed. "Don't do that.
Of course, I don't like to seem mercenary,
but I don't want to do anything on that
basis. I have tried it over and over, but
I never got any satisfaction out of work-
Ing on commission. Give me a salary
every time."â Detroit Free Press.
HYPNOTIZED BY THE "WASH."
The British steamer Howick Hall, on
arrival at Colombo from home, says the
IJombay Advocate of India, had to re
port the loss of her third officer on the
way out under rather unusual circum
stances. The officer. Francis Barnes, held
the same office on a sailing ship before he
ioined the Howick Hall recently. Tnls
was his first voyage on a steamer; and he
was frequently seen looking over the
stern rail, and a few days before making
Colombo, when the sea was very rough.
he was seen by another officer peering

over the stern. Later on he was missing.
The vessel was turned round at once and
boats were launched, but, though much
time was spent in looking for him, no
trace could be found. He must have been
hypnotized by the "wash" of the screw.
ASTOR BATTERY ARRIVES
AND WADES ASHORE
Hardships Confronting the Blue-
Blooded Fighters From New

BY SOL N. SHERIDAN.
CAMP DEWEY, HEADQUARTERS
FIRST CALIFORNIA REGIMENT,
BEFORE MANILA, July 27.â The As
tor Battery was landed in the rain to
day, and is a fine looking body of men
despite the bad impression it created
in San Francisco. The men came
ashore In cascoes from the Newport
and stripped and waded into the surf
to bring their goods ashore just the
same as though the blue blood of Man
hattan was stranger to their veins. The
rain falls here as in Biblical times, and
the waters of Manila Bay take as many
liberties with fine-blooded bodies as
with the most common clay. I fancy
John Jacob Astor would have held up
his hands in horror and a chill would
have run all along the avenue and out
Riverside drive if the swells could have
seen their pets of clubdom pattering
about in their bare legs while the surf
sported with them and a tropical show
er drenched them â and yet that is pre
cisely what we, who were so fortunate,
being upon the ground first, to be better
clad, were witnesses to, and that is
what war on the Island of Luzon will
mean to these men who have crossed
a continent and an ocean to fight â and
to many men as brave who have not
come so far. It will mean much tire
some marching over muddy roads,
much sleeping in damp clothing, much
suffering from hunger and fev^r, many
graves, perhaps, in miasmatic swamps
haunted by the small green lizards,
whose cry, "Guckoo! guckoo!" makes
night more a solitude here than any
where else on earth.
All this will come later, when we
have the natives to deal with â to hunt
down in the tropic. Jungles as we once
hunted the Indian of the plains. Just
now the boys are all eagerness to get
into Manila and settle the case of
Spain. The one prayer Is that General
Merritt and the admiral will move â and
move quickly.

INDIAN SCHOLARS.
Hoopa Reservation Children for the
Government School at Phoenix.
A party of young Indian pupils arrived
in the city yesterday morning on the
steamer Orizabo and are at the Russ
House. They are in charge of Emma H.
Denton. matron of the school on the
Hoopa reservation in Humboldt County,
where they have received instructions for
some time past, and this morning she will
turn them over to Superintendent Mc-
Cowan. who will take tnem to the Phoe
nix Government Industrial School, where
they will receive the finishing touches
to their education. The Indians are nam
ed Ida Buker Linda Griggs, Carrie Rob
erts, Emmie Peterson. I>uela Merrill. Jo
seph Donohue. Jerry Horn and Frank Rob
ert. They range in age from 14 to 18 years.
"Few people," said Superintendent Mc-
Cnwan, "have any idea of the magnitude
of the Phoenix school. We have over
thirty buildings of various sizes for the
accommodation of our scholars, a staff
of thirty white people who are teachers
in the literary and industrial arts and at
the present time we have over 700 Indians
on our rolls who are uniformed in cadet
grey. Ne*t to the institution at Carlisle,
Pennsylvania, it is the largest Indian
school in the United States. I have been
engaged in gathering the more advanced
pupils on the different reservations and
will take the nine from Hoopa away with
me Tuesday morning. They will have a
five-year term.
There are thirty-three tribes represented
among the pupils. We have formed a
military company of sixty members to
whom the Territory has loaned guns, and
they are a well drilled body of men. We
have also a football team composed of
fine specimens of the Apache, Papago
and Pima tribes. Their captain and lead
er Is Cyrus Sun, j> full-blooded Marico
pian and a sprinter of no mean ability. I
propose bringing the team to this coast in
November for a series of games, and I am
quite certain that the proposition will be
carried out."

GAVE HIM MORPHINE.
Clever Trick of a Woman to Obtain
the Deadly Drug.
T^enora T^ewis, a middle aged woman.
was arrested Sunday morning and
charged with vagrancy. While confined
in the City Prison yesterday she feigned
illness and was removed to the Receiving
Hospital. A short time after she sum
moned a young man named McCann, who
was passing the rough ward, and asked
him to take a sealed note toCarroll's drug
store at Market and Stockton streets.
McCann delivered the note and was given
a suspicious looking package to be hand
ed to the I^ewis woman. Suspecting that
it contained poison MeCann, on reaching
the hospital, told Dr. Maher of his sus
picions. The latter opened the package
and found that it contained 00 grains of
morphine.
Dr. Weil, the police surgeon, was in
censed when he learned of the trick, and
at once communicated the facts to the
police, To-da^'. It is said, a warrant will
be sworn out for the arrest of the drug
gist charging him with selling morphine
without a doctor's prescription.
The doctors at the hospital are con
vinced that the woman sent for the drug
intending to commit suicide.
Boy Burglars Caught.
James Johnson, aged 9 years, and
Charles Meyers, aged 13. were lodged at
the City Prison after midrilght, charged
with burglary. They were caught coming
out of ~>Z~> Folsom street, and had in their
possession a pistol and an accordion,
about B week ago the same boys stole
from the same house a gold watch and
chain and $50 in money.
Shoplifters in Court.
Tillie Feis> and Ella Shearer, the two
girls arrested in the Emporium Saturday
for shoplifting, appeared before Judge
Slogan yesterday. They were represented
by counsel and pleaded not guilty. At
their request the cases were continued till
Friday. The Shearer girl is still in prison,
being' unable to procure $200 bond.
THE GLORIOUS PATHS OF PEACE.
After a hundred days of war the United
: States will enter on the paths of peace
better prepfircd than ever to make them
glorious. These paths are broader and
I more inviting than any nation ever had
laid out by a beneficent Providence, and
if rightly followed they will lead to many
a glorious victory that will be no less
renowned than those just won In war. â

SPAIN ANNOUNCES
HER COMMISSIONS
Gets Within the Ten Day
Limit.
CAMBON NOTIFIES M'KINLEY
LIST DIFFERS FROM THOSE
PREVIOUSLY GIVEN.
Appointment of Montero for Cuba
Indicates a Purpose to Go Into
the Island's Future
Government.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 22.â The State
Department to-day received a call from
M. Thiebaut, Secretary of the French
embassy and in charge during the ab
sence of Embassador Cambon, who bore
a notification from the Spanish Govern-
ment of the military commissioners for
Cuba and Porto Rico. Under the peace
protocol each Government was to name
its military commissioners within ten
days, their meeting to begin within
thirty days. The ten days were up to
day and accordingly Spain gave the
official notice of the appointments.
They are as follows:
For Cuba â Major General Gonzales
Parrado, Rear Admiral Pastor y Lan
dero. Marquis Montero.
For Porto Rico â Major General Or
tega y Diaz, Commodore of First
Rank Vallarino y Carriseo, Judge
Advocate Sanchez del Aguila y Leon.
The foregoing official list differs from
some of the lists given in previous dis
patches, which have included Admiral
Montijo, General Blanco General Ma
ciafe and several other prominent Span
ish officers.
Considerable significance attaches to
the naming of Marquis Montero on the
Cuban commission as it Indicates a
purpose on the part of Spain to go Into
the future Government of Cuba, He is
the only commissioner, Spanish or
American, taken from civil life. He is
Secretary of the Treasury of the Cuban
autonomist cabinet and all his interests
are connected with the government of
Cuba rather than with the military
question of the Spanish evacuation of
Cuba. He is named, it is believed, in
order to carry out Spain's desire to
have an understanding as to the future
government of the islands being inti
mately familiar with the questions of
the civil administration of Cuba. As
secretary of the Cuban treasury he Is
also familiar with questions affecting
the Cuban debt.
A SUPERB ARMY.
It is natural that the veteran of the
Civil War, being human, should be crit
ical respecting armies of which he is
not a part. Yet as he salutes the new
volunteers on their way to the tropics
he invariably concedes their physical
superiority over the soldiers of the six
ties. This superiority is an obtrusive
fact to all who remember the events
of that other war. The average age is
lower and the stature, weight, strength,
and agility higher. Under Lincoln's
first call some attmept was made to
impose conditions of enlistment, but it
amounted to little more than the tem
porary rejection of persons who lacked
inches in height. Later, even this lack
was not a bar to enlistment. Yet the
men of the Civil War were not weak
lings, North or South, but displayed
prodigies of endurance and valor that
surprised mankind. .
The physical excellence of the new
army is a revelation and a rebuke to
those doleful persons who have de
plored the imaginary deterioration of
the American. The examinations con
ducted by army surgeons are severe
enough â nearly as exacting as in the
case of persons who apply for enlist
ment in the regular armyâ and the ap
plicants have shown an unexpectedly
high percentage of young men with
physical qualities above what is re
garded as the average.
The superb physical appearance of
the new troops Is significant. An army
of nearly 300,000 young athletes sug
gests a people as far advanced in bodily
vigor over those of a -eneration ago as
this army is over that of the sixties.
Habits of personal hygiene that were
then exceptional are now general. The
prominence of athletics in college life
is merely a reflection of the widespread
interest in health-giving exercises and
sports. The necessity of a sound body
to a tolerable existence is universally
recognized, and the popularity of i
wheeling, golf, tennis, boating and
other outdoor amusements is a result
of an intellgent study of hygiene. Be
fore the advent of croquet some thirty j
years ago life was carried on indoors I
as far as possible. â Washington Post.
JULES VERNE OUTDONE.
Simon Lake, the inventor of the sub
marine boat Argonaut, built by the Co
lumbia Iron "Works and Dry Dock Com
pany. Raltimore, has been talking inter
estingly of his 200-mile trip under and on
the surface of the Chesapeake Bay in hia
wonderful little craft. He says:
"During the trip we made various ex
periments to demonstrate the practica
bility of our system of submarine naviga
tion. The whole trip was made with our
own power. The Argonaut was handled
very easily either under the surface or
when running on the bottom, and we
proved that the boat was perfectly sea
worthy. On hard bottom, where the wa
ter was comparatively clear, the door
was opened and it was a beautiful sight.
We picked up a few oysters as we were
traveling along. We discovered that we
could see farther under the surface at
night with our electric lights than in the
daytime. The greatest distance seen in
the bay was about twenty feet. We hope
to get into the ocean next week, where
we will get clear waters, and see much
farther. Our divers were sent out from
the boat and demonstrated the entire
practicability of our system."
Mr. Lake expresses confidence In being
able to destroy mines laid to protect any
harbor in the world.â The Seaboard.
LORD BYRON'S MOTHER.
John Murray's new edition of Byron's
works contains several letters of Inter
est. In a letter written by John Byron,
the poet's father, to his sister, from the
Continent, whither he had fled from his
creditors, he thus refers to his wife:
"With regard to Mrs. Byron, I am glad
she writes to you. She is very amiable
at a distance; but I defy yc-u and all
the apostles to live with her two
months, for, if anybody could live with
her, it was me. Mais jeu de mains, jeu
de vilains. For my son, I am happy to
hear he is well; but for his walking, 'tis
impossible, as he is clubfooted."
Byron himself found It no less diffi
cult to get along with her. He writes
as follows to his half-sister Augusta in
1804: "I seize this interval of my aim
able mother's absence this afternoon
again to inform you, or rather to de
sire to be informed by you, of what is
going on. For my own part, I can send
nothing to amuse you, excepting a rep
etition of my complaints against my
tormentor, whose diabolical disposition
(pardon me for staining my paper with
so harsh a word\) seems to increase ;
with age and to acquire new force with
time.
"The more I see of her the more my
dislike augments; nor can I so entirely
conquer the appearance of it as to pre
vent her from perceiving my opinion;
this, so far from calming the gale,
blows it into a hurricane, which threat
ens to destroy everything, till, ex
hausted by its own violence, it is lulled
into a sullen torpor, which, after a
short period, is again roused into fresh
and revived frenzy, to me the most ter
rible and to every other spectator as
tonishing.
"She then declares that she plainly
sees that I hate her, that I am leagued
with her bitter enemies, viz., yourself.
Lord C(arlisle) and Mr. H(anson), and,
as I never dissemble or contradict her,
we are all honored with a multiplicity
of epithets, too numerous, and some of
them too gross, to be repeated. In
this society, and in this amusing and
Instructive manner, have I dragged out
a weary fortnight, and I am con
demned to pass another or three weeks
as happily as the former."
WOMEN AS PHYSICIANS.
It is over half a century ago that Eliza
beth Blackwell applied to the faculty of
the Geneva Medical College in Western
New Tork for admittance to the ranks
of students. She took the five years*
course, graduated with distinction and
was the pioneer of the nineteenth cen
tury in the profession, so far as women
are concerned. Other women who fol
lowed in her footsteps had a hard time,
for the next twelve applications to va
rious medical colleges were refused by
the cold-hearted faculties. Some refused
without qualifications and others stated
in no unguarded terms why they con
sidered women unfitted for the medical
profession.
On faculty stated that it refused women
admission to its medical school because
women by nature were assigned to a de
pendent position; because men had a pe.
culiar and exclusive right to the art of
healing, and because the study of medi
cine was demoralizing or "defeminlzing."
Nowadays women have proved that they
are not content with a dependent posi
tion. It would be Interesting to discover
by what right men hold the exclusive
right to practice medicine, for ancient
history tells of many women who were
doctors.
The Athenians tried to put to death
Agnodice, who practiced medicine. In
Rome there were recognized women phy
sicians and the names of some of them
have been preserved to us through 'n
scrlptions. There were Flavia and Mi
nucia and Sententia, who were well
known. From the time of the ancient
Greeks up to the middle of the eighteenth
century, when Anna Mazzolini qualified
and became professor of anatomy at Bo
logna, women have been numbered among
the medical practitioners.
In regard to the "defeminlzing" influ
ence of the study of medicine, that ob
jection haa been raised in turn against
every art and profession women have
taken up. At one time art was consid
ered quite beyond the pale and yet now
none of us would be willing to give up
the works of sculpture and painting
which have been bestowed upon the world
by women of talent. The second wo
man to study medicine was Elizabeth
Garrett, who started the move in Eng
land. In 1860 she began to study and
met many obstacles, the least of which
was her exclusion from some of the
classes so that she was obliged to have
the necessary course of lectures delivered
to her privately. But she triumphed in
the end.
PUBLICATION DURING RIOTING.
When the riots broke out in Milan re
ctntly the compositors of the Corriere
della Sera were unable to reach the
office, and in order to fill up the editor
was obliged to use a long article in type
entttled "The Reform of Architecture."
It cut a strange figure beside the graphic
accounts of the disturbances then going
on. Stranger still than the publication
of the article was the action of a well
known Milanese artist, who went to the
office next day. while the crack of the
soldiers' rifles could still be heard in the
neighborhood, to discuss the ideas on
architecture expressed in the article and
to ask permission to write a reply. The
difficulties of publication increased by de
grees. The supply of paper began to run
out, gas was lacking for the engine which
drives the printing machines, and the
workmen who remained in the printing
room received notice from the rioters to
cease work out of sympathy with the
men employed by the Secolo and Italia
del Popolo, which had been suppressed by
the authorities. However, the Corriere
della Sera overcame all these difficulties,
thanks to the loyalty of its workmen.
PICZETT'S MEN AND THE G. A. R.
At a meeting of Pickett Camp of Con
federate Veterans recently it was unani
mously decided to accept the invitation of
the Grand Army organizations of Phila
delphia to be their guests during their re
union, August 8 to 14, inclusive. The in
vitation was considered in executive ses
sion, and the generous hospitality of the
Grand Army veterans received warm
praise from many members. The mem
bers, including the survivors of Piekett's
division, are asked to become the guests
of the organizations for six days, the
cost of their transportation even being
paid by their hosts. About 100 Confeder
ates, members of Pickett Camp and sur
vivors ef Pickett's division will attend
the reunion. The reunion, or encampment,
as such gatherings are called in the
North, will be held in the celebrated
Washington Park, on the Delaware River,
eight miles from Philadelphia. It is need
less to say the ex-Confederates anticipate
having a time such as they never enjoyed
before. â Richmond Dispatch.
HELD UP IN ALASKA.
"Twelve capable and experienced offi
cers of the United States army," says
the Boston Transcript, "are In the wil
derness of Alaska on a Government
surveying detail, hoping that the pow
ers in Washington will allow them to
shift their details and join the army of
Invasion of Cuba. Some of them have
had as many as twenty years of active
and honorable service, and all of them
are filled with an ambition to earn
glory and laurels in mortal combat
with the Spanish oppressors of the
Pearl of the Antilles. Their formal ap
plications to Major General Merriam,
formerly commanding the Department
of the Columbia, who- succeeded Gen
eral Shatter in command of the Depart
ment of California, for relief from
Alaska detail were recently sent to him.
All save two of the twelve officers were
'turned down," as they will probably
express it when they learn, as they will
in the course of ten days or two weeks,
that the War Department has decided
it to be impracticable to abandon the
Alaska surveying expeditions."
WATER EFFECTS ON THE TEEI'H.
The question is to what extent the al
kaline earth salts in drinking water af
fect the decay (caries) of teeth has of late
been studied in several quarters. Statis
tics have been collected by Rese in sev
eral localilties in Bavaria and by Foer
berg in Sweden. These nave revealed
the interesting fact that the extent of de
caying teeth T)ears a definite t elation to
the hardness of the water, in other words,
to the quantity of calcium and magne
sium salts In the earth through which the
water passes. The harder the water the
better the teeth; the smaller the quantity
of these salts, the greater the decay of
the teeth.
BACHELORS' BASKETS.
Everybody has heard more or less about
baby baskets, and most women at one
time or another have dressed and fitted
out one of those dainty affairs with all
the little toilet articles, pockets and so
on that go with them, but a new basket
has appeared in a haberdasher's window.
The novelty is the bachelor's basket. It
is the same basket in shape and size,
about two feet long by one loot wide, and
a little deeper than the cuffs. It has. how
ever, a cover of the same wicker material
to keep out the dust. This basket is to
be had without any ..nine, an^ may be
fitted with sachet pads o*l the bottom,
sides and inside of cover, plain or shirred,
in the fancy delicate huea most admired
by the prospective owners. These pads
are to be filled with sacnet powder or his
favorite perfume ana tied in place by
ribbons finished with love knots. A large
and handsome sash bow of the same tint
adorns the top of the oo\er. and smaller
bows of narrow ribbon finish the corners.
The basket is intended to keep the collars,
cuffs and fluffy ties in shape without
mussing uiem. and is a great improve
ment on the collar and cuff bo::es and tie
holders.
BITTER ATTACK ON
SECRETARY ALGER
Newspaper Prefers Se
rious Charges.
ALLEGED PLOT AGAINST MILES
TELEGBAMS SAID TO HAVE
BEEN SUPPRESSED.
One Message Was From McKinley
and Directed the General to
Take Command at
Santiago.
Special Dispatch to The Gall.
PHILADELPHIA. Aug. 22.â A sensa
tion was caused here this morning by
the publication in the Times of a bitter
attack on Secretary Alger, who is ac
cused by the Times of having, with
other War Department officials, stolen
I and suppressed a telegram sent by
President McKinley to General Miles.
This telegram is alleged to have di
rected General Miles to take command
i of the army at Santiago, relieving Gen
! eral Shafter. It is charged that the
conspirators substituted a telegram to
General Shafter informing him that
j General Miles would not take com
i mand. Further, the Times prints tele
: grams alleged to have been suppressed
by the War Department. The tele
grams contained orders from General
Miles to field officers, and are declared
to have never reached their destination.
NEW YORK, Aug. 22.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: The
grave charge printed this morning in
Philadelphia that there had been sup
pression of an order intended by the
President to be sent to General Miles
Is much deprecated here. It is believed,
moreover, that when General Miles re
turns and becomes cognizant that fric
tion is thus bitterly alleged as existing
between him and General Shafter and
the Secretary of War he will deny that
such friction existed. The Secretary of
War holds in high esteem the conduct
of General Miles in Santiago and his
campaign in Porto Rico. Speaking to
me about the matter, Secretary Alger
said:
"I hardly care to reply to the charge
that there was any suppression of any
: orders. It is absurd, brutal and beyond
i belief. There could have been no fric
j tion between General Miles and Gen
. eral Shafter, for In looking over the list
of names of men available for the com
mand of the Fifth Army Corps General
: Miles was called into the conference,
' and said he thought General Shafter
was the strongest man. It was largely
upon this opinion of his that General
Shafter was chosen. It is very unfor
! tunate on all sides that there should
I be such agitations involving good feel
ing between friends, especially when
! they are absolutely groundless."
OLD AND NEW FURNITURE.
Eat-ly In the second decade of the
! century the fashionable cabinetmaker
! of thai day made for a New Yorker
i exiled to Philadelphia a quantity of
I mahogany furniture. The bill for that
furniture has recently come into the
hands of a cabinet maker of to-i'.ay, one
I that loves his trade and its traditions
â  and that makes faithful reproductions
â  of the very articles named in the bill
of more than eighty years ago. The
old bill and the present cabinetmaker's
scale of prices afford an opportunity
for interesting comparison, and the
comparison shows that prices in that
period of nearly a century ago have
; undergone no very marked, change. The
j chairs made by the cabirtetmakers of
eighty odd years ago alt something
more than $21 each now IJetch $25 each,
and the change in the prices of other
articles is less rather than greater.
Meanwhile the cost of the raw ma
terial has somewhat increased. Tools
are perhaps better than they were in
i those early days, and the wages of the
I Journeymen are somewhat better now
j than then. Profits, or at least so much
of profits as is represented by interest
on capital invested, have decreased.
Meanwhile the demand for cabinet
made furniture has by no means in
creased in proportion to the increase
of population, for by far the larger part
of the furniture now made is turned
out by the wholesale from factories
equipped with labor-saving mechinery
unknown in the early part of the cen
tury. It is owing to the fact that most
of the demand of to-day is supplied
from this source that the price of cab
inet made furniture of the best quality
has not doubled and trebled in the last
eighty years. The cabinetmaker of to
day is, indeed, in a better situation
than the old-fashioned shoemaker and

CELEBRATION AT WINDSOR.
The first English settlement in Con
necticut was commemorated at Wind
sor, Wednesday. June 29, by "unveil
ing" a memorial stone on the spot
where a part of the Plymduth colony
first landed in that State. The stone,
a great boulder, is placed on "the isl
and," beside the highway, opposite
the spot where the iirst house wai
built. It bears this inscription:
"This rock marks the first English
settlement in Connecticut by members
from the Plymouth colony, 1633. Dedi
cated by the Abigail Wolcott Ellsworth
Chapter of the D. A. R., June, 1898."
This named chapter of the Daughters
of the American Revolution carried on
the exercises of the occasion, which in
cluded a meeting in the Windsor Town
Hall, whereat Mrs. Sara T. Kinney.
State Regent, gave an account of the
organization, and showed that it is an
active factor in the hospital service of
the present war, as well as working for
the preservation of ancient landmarks.
To Deacon Jabez Hayden was given
honor for his assistance in this latter
line, and an honorary daughtership
was suggested for him. A paper by
Jabez Haskell Hayden about the pio
neer days was read by Miss Lulu Al
bee. After these ceremonies came the
"unveiling," for the stone was covered
by an American and an English flag,
which were removed by Mrs. Kinney,
after which the Rev. F. W. Harriman
made an oration, in which he urged
upon the Daughters of the American
Revolution the erection of a suitable
monument to the settlers who came
from Dorchester.
He said it must bear the names of
Roger Ludlow and John Mason, of
Thomas Wareham and Ephriam Hew
it. He enlarged the scheme to include
names of men who fought for inde
pendence or in the civil war, and even
"any son of Windsor who may give
his life in the present struggle for the
liberty of Cuba." But perhaps these
generations had better be severally
than jointly memorialized by monu
ments, and Mr. Harrlman's concluding
idea was that the great comprehensive
memorial should be a public library.
ALMOST SPANISH NAVAL YARN
Perhaps the most humorous story in
connection with the Ist of June. Lord
Howe's victory, is the amazing fable or
the Vengeur, which is due to the patriotic
imagination, unrestrained by any regard
for prosaic accuracy, of Barrere. Bar
rere reported to the convention that the
Vengeur went down with all her colors
flvlng. scorning to surrender, "Viv* ia
Republique. and a universal volley from
the upper deck being the last sound she
made " "Glorieuse affaire dv \ engeur
became for the French a national myth.
It has inspired innumerable French
songs. A wooden model of the Vengeur
was solemnly consecrated and placed i:i
the Pantheon. Carlyle embodied the
story in his "French Revolution." Lo!
he wrote "all flags , streamers, jacks,
every rag of tricolor that will yet run on
rope flies rustling aloft. The whole crew
crowds to the upper deck, and with uni
versal soul-maddening yell shouts Vive
la Republique.' Finking, sinking."
Carlyle later on discovered how wild a
flight of fiction the whole story was.
Barrere was a liar of Titanic scale; but
the Vengeur myth. Carlyle declared,
must be pronounced "Barrere's master
piece- the largest, most inspiring piece of
blague manufactured for some centuries
by any man or nation." At the time the
Vengeur went down the battle had ceased
for some hours; her captain was peace
fully getting his lunch in one of the
cabins of the Culloden. and some 400 of
her crew had been rescued, much to their
own satisfaction, by the boats of the
various British ships!â Cornhill Maga
zine.
JUDGE OBLIGES A CRIMINAL.
Obviously the thing when one is sen
tenced to twelve months' imprisonment
is not to lose one's presence of mind.
If you do it may cost you a month and
five days' extra incarcerationâ a seri
ous matter when time is jail. A pris
oner represented this to Judge Murray
at the sessions the other day. He was
sentenced to twelve months' imprison
ment, and he appears to have a^cepie-I
the result like a philosopher, his only
comment being to ask the Judge to
make it one month more. His Honor
was staggered by the request, but was
quickly enlightened. It seems that in
any sentence over twelve months a
prisoner is entitled to a remission of
two months and five days for cool
conduct, but with sentences of twelve
months and under there is no rrbate.
It is the principle, I suppose, of taking
a large quantity at a time. His Honor
at once saw the reasonableness of thÂ»
request and gave the extra month a3
desired.â Sydney Herald.

NOT A RAILROAD AFFAIR.
THERE has been frequent declaration lately that
the railroad is not in politics. Whether this was
made with the expectation that any one would
believe it or as a grim corporation joke is not clear.
It is certain, however, that there are many represen
tatives of the railroad at Sacramento now, having
gone up from this city. Their presence at the capital
can hardly be regarded as a coincidence, ami their cir
culation among the delegates is believed to have some
other purpose than mere sociability. As a matter of
fact the railroad is doing politics.
The present is not a railroad year, and the interfer
ence of that concern in Republican affairs will not be
tolerated. The company would be wise to recall its
clerks and handy men. They may be needed at home.
They are neither needed nor wanted a* Sacramento,
and any work they undertake there will be promptly
exposed. If any candidate is being pushed forward
by the railroad the truth will be published and result
in the undoing of that candidate. To expose such a
deal, no matter whom it may involve, this paper re
gards as a duty to the public and to the party. The
ticket must not be loaded down with the creatures of
the corporation. Let the railroad get out of politics
or experience the discomfort of being kicked out,
carrying with it the men who do its bidding.
MR. J. AUBREY JONES.
WHEN it was announced that the fused fac
tions of the Third Congressional District had
nominated as their candidate for Congress Mr.
J. Aubrey Jones a little murmur of surprise ran
around the community. Some asked, "Who is Mr.
Jones?" and others asked, "What does the J stand
for?"
The^e questionings will not go long unanswered.
All prospects point to the conclusion that before the
campaign gets really red hot the fused candidate of
the Third District will be one of the best-known men
in the commonwealth. He promises to furnish the
humor of the contest. It will soon be a common say
ing that Mr. J. Aubrey Jones is the most conspicuous
bird in the woodpecker campaign, and to any one in
quiring what the J stands for the answer will be
prompt. "The jay is standing for Congress."
To the gayety of the season Mr. Jones, enraptured
by what he has been pleased to call "honors spon
taneously extended." has already contributed much.
In his letter of thanks for the nomination it requires
the fullest exuberance of his vocabulary to describe
his position as it appears to himself. "I am," he says,
"the candidate of the People's party, the Democratic
party and the Silver Republican party." In another
place he says, "I am the honored nominee of all the
people in the Third District who are opposed to Han
naism." Finally he sums up, "I am a two-times nomi
nee."
To be so many kinds of a nominee all at one fell
swoop would be bewildering to some men, but it has
not been so to Mr. J. Aubrey Jones. "I would not."
he says, "vaingloriously ascribe my preferment to any
merit of my own. It is only because of the principles
which I have earnestly espoused and which I shall
advocate honestly and fearlessly." The clear distinc
tion thus made by Mr. Jones between his merits and
his zealous advocacy of certain principles shows that
even in hi* rapture lie retains an analytical mind and
does not "chortle in his joy."
It appears, moreover, that in addition to the delight
of being a two-times nominee Mr. J. Aubrey Jones
has a further cause for excitement in the comparative
novelty of his situation and the freshness of his new
relations. He says it was because of these principles,
which he so markedly distinguishes from his merits,
that he left the party of Hannaism in 1806. He has
therefore been wooing his new bride only two years,
and. having won her fused favors in so short a time,
it is certain he has some reason to plume himself and
show up as the gayest jay that ever stood for Con
gress in a woodpecker campaign.
Altogether Mr. T. Aubrey Jones promises to be de
lightful, and. if he speaks as richly as he writes, the
campaign in the Third District is going to be a merry
one. We can wish the humor-loving people of that
district no better fun than that the fused factions will
keep their two-time nominee and fresh recruit con
tinually on the boards in a two-time role as writer
and orator.
Three hours was as long as the man who agreed
to be buried for six days could stand the solitude of
the tomb. He was brought out alive, a circumstance
probably viewed by himself as fortunate, but the
anxiety to rescue him was unaccountable. The world
was already well stocked with unburied freaks.
From the attitude of the Manila insurgents it is
not believed that the presence of a few more troops
would be looked upon by Mcrritt with disfavor.
The railroad is authority for the statement that it is
not in. politics, but the authority is not regarded as
first class
THE CHOICE OF CANDIDATES.
THE canvassing of a day and a night and the dis
cussion among delegates have somewhat cleared
the situation at Sacramento.
There is a great spirit of tolerance abroad, but it
iÂ« not a spirit blind to the practical situation. It is
| felt by the wisest party men that the Republican
i party must this year more than ever appeal to the
} people by an exposition of, its enduring principles.
Judge Maguire has attempted to put his campaign
,' upon issues of passing expediency, upon temporary
j foundations. Clothed with isms and ologies and
onomies thicker than the cotton scale on a neglected
orange tree, he has picked out the funding bill as the
.' issue of his campaign. He shies from every public
policy he has heretofore advocated, dodges all his ex-
I pressions upon other subjects and harks back to the
! funding bill. Now, it happens that the bill as passed
! had the approbation of Senator Morgan and Senator
! White, who regard it as a final legislative conclusion
j of the whole matter, leaving nothing further to be
| done but for the Government to go ahead and collect
I the whole debt upon terms entirely favorable to the
j United States. Morgan's statement while here takes
i that issue out of the domain of practical politics.
| Judge Maguire will be driven upon broader ground,
I and the Republican party must meet him there with a
; man who cannot be accused of having bolted its con
ventions, opposed its candidates or derided its pur
' poses. He must stand justified by his record as a
party man and by his talents as a public leader. In
this view of the work required of a candidate, the ac
cessions made by Mr. Gage during the day and night
were formidable. They are not programmers, but
independent men controlled only by their convictions
of party policy. They say that their candidate can go
before the people and reason of political righteous
ness, and that such reasoning is required this year.
There was observed a growing antagonism to sur
rendering to the "claims" of a single county. The
whole party has claims that must be, considered. No
county has a right to claim that the party mast again
try the experiment of running a bolter for Governor.
It has tried that three times and failed.
The delegates look at the defeat of fusion in Ore
gon and reflect that it was accomplished by putting
forward seasoned and well experienced party men.
who had no treacheries to explain and who were able
to expound party principles as against the harlequin- j
ades of the fusionists. As an advocate before the j
people of those principles Mr. Gage is looked to with ;
confidence in his magnetism and ability.
As a rule the competitors who fight also for the !
prize fight fair and avoid detraction of his merits and j
his strength, with a view to leaving no wounds to I
heal and no wrongs to redress when the convention
has spoken.
The party does not propose to get into power by
saying one thing and then doing another. Those
tactics will be left to Maguire. who seeks success on
the funding bill issue, which Senator Morgan says is
dead, to use his power if elected to confiscate the land
of private owners and injure the State by his stock of I
iridescent, twilight and aurora borealis theories.
It is felt that Mr. Gapre. as an expounder of princi
ples, will convince the people that the party nay will be
nay and its yea be yea. Again, every one i* impressed
by the fact that no bosses are in his camp. If they have
strength he does not seek it. He makes no treaties
and his pledges arc as public a? his candidacy.
A PLONK FOR THE PLATFORM.
WHEN the committee on platform at Sacra
mento sets about drawing up a declaration of
principles for the Republicans of California in
the coining campaign it is well assured they will not
neglect to pay a fitting tribute to the brave men of
the army and the navy who have in the war with
Spain so gloriously upheld the victorious traditions
of our flag and country. The committee, however,
should not stop with words of praise and commenda
tion. For the men of the navy at least there is needed
something more. They have a claim upon the Gov
ernment for justice, and the Republican party should
give a pledge that the claim shall be fully and prompt
ly accorded.
For a long time there has been a demand that pro
vision be made in our naval regulations for the ad
vancement and promotion of enlisted seamen in pro
portion to their merits. The navy personnel bill in
troduced into Congress at the last session but not
acted upon was devised to that end. The demand is
well founded. To open an avenue for merit in the
navy would be simply to extend to that service the
principle which now pervades every other department
of American life. It would be but the righting of an
injustice which has been already too long tolerated.
There was a time in the army, as in the navy now,
when enlisted men had no chance of promotion to
the rank of commissioned officers. A change was
made there and the results were immediately bene
ficial. A better class of young men enlisted in the
ranks and the spirit of the army improved. It cannot
be doubted that equally good results would follow
from a similar change in the navy. It is well known
that under the present conditions ambitious young
seamen in America turn aside in time of peace from
the naval service. They are unwilling to devote
themselves to a career in which no means are pro
vided by which merit may rise from the lowest to the
highest round of the ladder.
It is to the navy we mainly owe our swift and splen
did triumph over Spain. For that triumph great
honors are due to the commissioned officers of every
grade from lieutenant to admiral, but all the credit of
the victories should not be given to them. Much is
due to the enlisted men. Without hope of personal
fame or promotion they performed their difficult
and dangerous duties as heroically as the command
ing officers themselves. When volunteers were called
for to follow Hobson in the daring deed of blocking
Santiago harbor every enlisted man in the fleet came
forward. Such men deserve more than empty praise
and rewards in the form of bounties or increased
pay.
The Democratic party in its platform has ignored
these men. but the Republicans must not do so. The
seamen of our navy should be given a chance of pro
motion equal to that given to the soldiers of the army.
Wherever a patriot fights for America on land or sea,
he should have before him under the starry, flag an.
open avenue leading to the highest, honors of a grate
ful country-
When James G. Blame was giyen a commission
there was some objection on the ground that in all
his positions in civil life he had been a failure. It
seems that the objections might reasonably have been
based on the circumstance that he is not a gentle
man. He was involved in a disgraceful row here,
another in Honolulu, and altogether seems to be
doing all he can to bring odium on an honored name.
Many of the delegates at Sacramento might as well
prepare to exchange their gay badges for the somber
badge of mourning. However, all of them expect
the other fellow to do the mourning.
It would seem that the decent people of San Fran
cisco ought to have greater influence than the deni
zens of Berry street
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 23, 1898.
WHAT IS EXPECTED OF THE CON
VENTION.
WHILE the usual scenes of animation and dis
cussion which are inseparable from a popular
convention may be expected in and around
the Republican convention at Sacramento, the peo
ple, looking upon it as an expression of their aspira
tions, expect that such expression will be character
ized by dignity, patriotism and a sense of responsi
bility.
While it is necessary that a convention make per
sonal preferences between candidates, yet such prefer
ence, if wisely guided and well intended, is in the
public interest, to secure a proper trusteeship of the
public welfare when the party candidate has been
chosen as the public officer.
The conventions that have already been held have
I presented the sorry spectacle of bitter personal de
i traction and strife. Every speech made in the Demo
; cratic convention was for the purpose of putting up
ior pulling down some personality. Not a word was
uttered upon a great public issue nor in exposition
| of a great political principle.
It is expected to be different in the Republican con-
I vention. The people look for something that thrills.
! with the aroused patriotism of the time and for an
; exposition of great principles that will attract the
; indifferent to study and adopt them. A contest be
j tween candidates may have its selfish features, and
I these become revolting unless behind and above them
may be seen devotion to those concerns of the people
: which, in a republic, must be promoted by parties
> and organizations.
Let the members of the convention think soundly
1 and well of the farmers who in this hard year look
sadly upon their cropless fields and fruitless trees and
[ vines. Let them think of the manufacturing plants
i where silent wheels wait to cheer labor with their
J song, and remember that as far as the convention
I promises to defeat the wild schemes against the land
; owner, the employer of -labor and labor itself, its ac
tion will find favor.
California suffers this year, industrially, from phy-
I sical causes that are beyond human control. The
Republican convention should see to it that further
l misfortune does not come from the causes' that are
i within human' control.
The State had years of abundant yield, the fields
i bore great crops, the orchards blushed and the vyie
' yards purpled, but from 1893 until 1897, notwithstand
ing the abundance of natural bounties, business enter
prise languished for want of profit and labor went
hungry for lack of wages. The dearth and distress
of those years was due to human causes, to have been
averted by human means.
The Republican party had been expelled from
power, and the men who now seek to again defeat it
were in the saddle. They were herdsmen of the lean
1 kine that ate the fat ones, and they garnered the
shriveled ears which consumed those that were filled.
They come again under a motley banner, with
bands playing, and their captains and shouters invite
the people to erase the rainbow and promise a pot of
gold where it touches the earth.
The Republican convention should come seriously
counseling that man cannot clothe himself with the
morning and the evening mists, nor fill his belly with
shooting stars, nor lift himself over mountains with
his own hands. It must come with genuine en
couragement to labor, to capital, to enterprise and to
manly character, with a hard hoof riding down the
wrong and helping the right with a glad hand.
By promising the possible, appealing to reason,
avoiding prejudice and doing justice in a judicial
temper it will lend the people who want to follow in
the ways of pleasantness and the paths of peace.
THE question of territorial expansion, or, what
is coming to be known throughout the country
as "imperialism," is likely in the near future to
divide the principal political parties. A number of
State platforms have been constructed in the Eastern
States since Dewey captured the Philippinesand Miles
and Shafter invaded Porto Rico and Cuba, and in
most cases the question has been straddled or dodged.
One of the latest is a platform issued by the Repub
licans of Indiana, in which the subject is coolly
avoided.
These Republicans approve the annexation of Ha
waii, but that is as far as they go. Whether the
Hoosier State wants Cuba or Porto Rico annexed or
favors the acquisition of the Philippines is a deep
and impenetrable mystery.
However, on all sides there is a strong demand for
"coaling stations." Even the Indiana Republican
Convention â the pink of conservatism â favors the
establishment of these stations "wherever necessary,"
thus squinting at imperialism in its mildest and most
innocuous form. So long as care is taken to refrain
from saying where these coaling stations are to be
located, or how they are to be acquired, the cautious
platform-makers of both parties will manage to keep
out of the hole of territorial expansion. It is quite
creditable to them that so far they have discussed
"coaling stations" without committing themselves to
a policy of annexing the hordes of the Orient or the
mongrels of the West Indies.
The difficulty is bound to come, however, when
Congress meets. Then the politicians will be forced
to take sides one way or the other. For a long time
both parties have been declaring for the enactment
and enforcement of laws restricting and preventing
the immigration of undesirable foreigners. This was
done for the benefit of free American labor, which, it
has been proved, cannot compete with the cheap labor
of Asia. For the purpose of maintaining this posi
tion the politicians of both parties have repeatedly
charged that the Asiatics live on rice and rats and
work for a few cents a day, and every effort has been
made upon this proof to secure the votes of American
laboring men.
How the politicians are now going to take the posi
tion that it will be wise to annex eight or ten millions
of these degraded Asiatics and at the same^time main
tain a reputation for consistency it is difficult to fore
see. In many States where there is a large labor vote
this position will have to be assumed rather diplo
matically. The United Spates has already annexed
some forty or fifty thousand Chinese and Japanese in
Hawaii with the approval of both political parties. To
explain why the competition of these people should
be feared while under foreign. rule and why it becomes
innocuous under American rule will be calculated to
tax the ingenuity of even such diplomats as make
Democratic and Republican platforms.
Evidently the Eastern politicians realize that a diffi
cult task confronts them. They are approaching it
with great caution â the Democrats with a view to
withholding as much Republican thunder as possible
and the Republicans with a long eye to the future.
An instance of the dangers which beset all parties is
found in the case of Texas. The Democrats of that
State have declared flatly in favor of "territorial ex
pansion" with all its consequences. But then there is
no labor vote in Texas and annexation is traditional
with its people.
Pretty soon the Southern Pacific will be counting
San Jose among its assets.
KNOTTY PROBLEMS.
PRESENT ASPECT OF NATIONAL AND STATE POLITICS.
The Democratic State Platform Condemned.
To the EJitor of The Callâ Sir: In the interval between the Demo
cratic and Republican conventions and from the standpoint of Jeffersonian
Democracy I desire to present my views upon some aspects of national and
State politics. In previous communications, which naturally lead up to
what I am now about to say, you have permitted me to express my ideas
upon the adoption of a British policy of imperial conquest and the perma
nent retention of colonies with inferior populations which cannot be con
verted into American States. I have denounced that poHcy as, first, un
constitutional; second, suicidal; third, treacherous to our own people and
to the world at large. The entire history of the country, including all the
debates that have occurred in Congress or in constitutional conventions,
the speeches and the papers of our great statesmen and diplomatists, the
treatises of law writers and the decisions and opinions of our learned judges
and tribunals, have been and are accessible to the imperialists, who would
sell their country for a mess of pottage, but they have not even attempted
the semblance of a connected argument in favor of their scheme of vir
tual absorption by Great Britain and their demonstration has consisted
wholly of noise and froth.
The doctrine of the Declaration of Independence, as The Call has incis
ively pointed out, is that minorities, even single individuals, have unassail
able rights, and among them, I suppose, would be included the right of
living under their constitutional government as it was established and
guaranteed. Still, it is an indisputable fact that a whole nation cannot be
indicted and punished for treason and if the people of the United States were
bent upon sweeping aside their constitutional system and upon identifying
their government and themselves with the imperial policy of Great Britain
and upon substantially abandoning the plan of self-government projected
by the fathers and recklessly entering upon the destructive career of the
republic of Rome there would be nothing left for those who believe in the
United States as it has heretofore existed but protest, submission and re
liance upon the Divine extrication of good from evil.
But there is no evidence that I can discern of genuine public opinion in
our country in favor of imperialism, although there are many attempts to
create artificial pressure in that direction by perfunctory resolutions and by
violent assumptions of authority. The President of our local Chamber of
Commerce has supplied conspicuous examples of this tendency. He is evi
dently thoroughly imbued with the British policy and has taken the State
and the nation under his wing. In the name of the Chamber of Commerce,
but, I will venture to claim, without the actual consideration and assent
of a corporal's guard of that large, intelligent and patriotic body, a pream
ble and resolution were nominally adopted which, if they could be carried
into effect, would unquestionably revolutionize our government. The other
day, when the national conference on the foreign policy of the United
States was about to meet at Saratoga, the same gentleman, in his official
capacity, forwarded a telegram which insisted that we should perma
nently hold the Philippines, and borrowed a phrase from hysterical jour
nalism, meaning that our flag should be nailed to the ancient tree of des
potism instead of fluttering in the soft breezes of liberty. The flag still
waves, however, in its original beauty and the convention, uninfluenced by
any appeal not originating in Americanism, adopted a declaration from
which no patriotic citizen of any party ought to dissent and the most sig
nificant pan -raph in which is In these words:
"As soon as the islands under our present protection can be trusted to
govern themselves they should be allowed to do so, the United States re
taining under its authority only necessary naval stations."
Upon the issue of imperialism I have no fear of the ultimate result, and
especially because of the admirable poise and firmness of President McKin
ley's administration, which rests upon the rock of popular sovereignty and
clearly discriminates between the smoke of bonfires, the blare of
trumpets and the clamor of speculation and the calm light that rises from
the hearts and the minds of patriotic and unpurchasable citizens, to whom
their country is a sentiment as well as a fact.
The condition of State politics, so far as developed by the State con
ventions which have been held, is disheartening in the extreme, and
clinches the proposition I have heretofore ventured to suggest that issues
are confused, principles abandoned, and the bone of contention bared to
the mere aspiration for office. Even the party lash, or the more plausi
ble argument in favor of discipline, cannot hold Democrats, constitution
ally trained, to doctrines which repudiate Democracy. It might as well be
expected that a Catholic would subscribe to the' creed of the atheist, or a
Methodist to the tenets of Unitarianlsm. In the name of Jefferson â
clarum et venerabile nomen â the Democratic State Convention has explicit
ly denied the fundamental principles of his philosophy and conduct. It
has done more than this, for it has deliberately rejected even the de
mocracy of Clay, of Webster, of Lincoln, of Grant, of Harrison and of Mc-
Kinley. Long since many of its leaders had repudiated Cleveland, who, in
the opinion of millions, is to-day the foremost Democrat in the United
States. In a short phrase, it has now swung further away from the es
sential elements of democracy than any convention of a re
cognized party ever held during our national existence. The
settlement of the controversy between the contending factions
from San Francisco was the fitting prelude to a socialistic declaration.
There can be no doubt that the municipal politics have been corrupt and
that primaries have been a farce. Why? Simply because the very men
who inveigh against bosses and their methods have themselves desired to
be bosses and have had no better remedy to propose than to violate the
fundamentals of Americanism and to extirpate these evils by honest des
potism. This is the remedy of the new charter. This is the remedy of
the Democratic State Convention, against which such pure and stanch
Democrats as W. W. Foote vainly protested. If Mr. Phelan and the en
tire association of Native Sons, if the Junior Pioneers, If
the members of the Young Men's Institute and of the Young
Men's Christian Association, would act together, without distinction
of party or religion, and inaugurate the Grand Political Army of the Re
public, with regular military discipline, and with a simple pledge to attend
to political duties and to vote at primaries and elections, such a movement
might sweep the country like wildfire, and. within its proper limits, and
in compliance with American institutions, do the work that in other ways
has been done by the Salvation Army and by the Grand Army of the Re
public.
Such an organization would be a natural product of the war and would
prove irresistible throughout the State and the nation, and might result
in the exaction of pledges to the rigid performance of political duties as
conditions of membership and in the substance of obligations in all so
cieties, municipal. State and national, in which American patriotism can
find appropriate expression. But to attempt to cure bossism by a legal
ized boss or to do the work of primaries through a State Central Commit
tee is to apply remedies which are worse than the disease, and which are
of the essence of that imperialism toward which some Americans are drift
ing.
Tho Democratic platform, in its paramount features, is less democratic
than any Whig or Republican platform I have ever read. By its very terms
the Populists swallow the Democrats whole, exactly as Great Britain would
swallow the United States if we adopted an inperlalistic policy. Now
Populists, most of them, are conscientious and intelligent citizens. That
1b not disputed. But they are not only not Democrats, but the class of
our citizens farthest removed from Democracy. The essense of Jeffer
sonian Democracy is individualism and the reductions of the functions of
government to the minimum. The essence of Socialism, variously formu
lated, is the paternal care for the Individual by government. Populism is
Socialism, modified not in its ends, but in its temporary pretensions and
practically applied. Consequently Democracy and Populism are the politi
cal antitheses of each other. And yet they have come together in an em
brace which is virtually an incorporate union.
The Democratic platform reaffirms the national platform of 1896, and
specifically re-enacts the heresy of free silver at 16 to 1; in other words, the
substitution of depreciated and cheap money for the hard currency of the
constitution, as Interpreted by Jefferson and by Jeffersonian Democrats.
But. waiving the argument on the issue itself, the sound money Democrats
of 1896 rejected Mr. Bryan and his platform on the ground that neither was
Democratic. In a State canvass in 1898, the Democratic State Conven
tion goes out of its way to refuse the support and the votes of this large
body of citizens, with Mr. Cleveland at their head, and harmonizes with
the Populists in a manifesto of undying antagonism.
This same platform seeks to revive the controversy with the Southern
Pacific Company, which Senator : Morgan of Alabama has declared to be
closed, and to perpetuate the battles of the past, which, necessary though
they may have been, have retarded the advancement .of the State by a
quarter of a century. And this occurs at a period when the issue is only
a war cry, and when all patriotic citizens and organizations within the
State should unite in a supreme effort to obliterate ancient discords ' and
asperities, and take advantage of the magnificent opportunities that peace
will furnish under existing conditions, for the development of our. Industries
and for the increase of population of the best and most self-sustaining
classes.
This same platform, on an assumption which is likely to prove true,
advocates the Government ownership of railroads, a proposition incorpor
ated into the platform of the Populists and there extended to all public
utilities. This proposition was carefully excluded in all former struggles
with Mr. Huntington and his associates, or it would have alienated men
who took leading parts in advocating what they conceived to be the in
terests of the State and the nation in their relations to railroads. .
This same platform declares for the election of United States Senators
by popular vote. It may well be that thousands of Republicans believe
in this radical change. But it is certain that the bulk of what may be
termed constitutional Democrats, including- the Sound Money Democrats of
1896, are firm in the conviction that the balance of our system requires
that Federal Senators should represent the States as political entities, and
that to obliterate the distinction between them and Representatives from
Congressional districts would be the opening phase of a political revolution
as disastrous as imperialism itself.
I would be glad and I believe It would be a political service to analyze
this extraordinary platform, which is launched in the name of Jeffersonian
Democracy, more closely, but I fear I have already outrun my space, and.
therefore, reserve any further comments for a future occasion. I cannot
anticipate what the Republican platform may be. but it will surely ap
proach closer to the Democratic standard than the braided platforms of
the Populists and Democrats. PUBLICOLA.

THE BRIDGE OF MUSKETS.
The roar of battle was at its height.
When the general's orderly spurred In
sight, .
His right arm shattered, his brave lips
white.
"Forward, Stannard's brigade!" he
cried,
"Join Sherman's left at the riverside!"
We sprang like wolves out of covert then,
A thousand desperate fighting men,
Held in leash since the break of day-
Woe to the obstacle in the way!
"March! Double-quick, boys!" Stannard
cried.
So we thundered down to the riversida.
There sat Sherman, as grave and dark
As a bronze general in a park!
Behind him rank on rank of blue,
Waiting to see what he would do.
The rebels had stripped the bridge of
planks.
And the swollen river had drown'd its
banks,
That day's victory or loss
Hung on getting his troops across.
One maneuverâ but one, he knewâ
Could save defeat for the boys in blue,
Yet here was a barrier worse to pass
Than granite ramparts and gates of
brass.
The general's face his anguish showed,
As we fell in line by the muddy road,
The engineers on the river's brink
Stood talkingâ they had no time to think.
What was done must be done at once;
Hurry a genius and he's a dunce!
Suddenly, out of the smoke somewhere.
Shoeless and hatless, with flying hair,
A boy came running. "Please, sir," ha
cried,
"I'll get your men to the other side!'
Sherman looked down on the little chap
As a dog might look at a mouse, mishap?
Then, with a quiet smile, he said,
"Well, young wizard, just go ahead!"
The boy looked round with a blush of
pride.
"Lend me your muskets, men!" he cried.
"And you shall cross on a bridge ot
steel."
"Ha!" said Sherman, from head to heel
Scanning the lad with his piercing eyes;
"Brains aren't indexed by nge or size.
Here's a strategist, it appears.
Bigger than all my engineers."
Sharply the general's order rang;
Quick to the stringers the workmen
sprang.
Muskets gathered by stacks, by tons.
Mighty heaps of the shining guns.
Spiked with bayonets, side by side.
Driven deep in the stringers, wide;
Interwoven by muzzle, stock,
Till an iron network as firm as rock
Took the place of the missing planks;
This was the way that the eager ranks
Laid their guns, at the boy's command.
Till the river's rushing width was
spanned.
Then, as over the bridge we filed.
Batteries clanking and horses wild.
What cheers went up for the barefoot
child! .
Sherman, baring. his honored head.
Stopped where the hero stood; and said,
"Master workman, you've struck, to-day,
A better blow than my poor,swor<l may!',';

â¢'. In spite of the rain Honolulu wore its
"..best; which is not stunning by a mile
and a half, and covered it up with
..funereal umbrellas, which gave the
â¢".platform the appearance of a mush
:room crop. So far as I could see under
the umbrejlas and from my seat at the
* : extreme end of the platform, there was
.'. not â¢ one Hawaiian among the women
...seated on the stand, and only those
â¢men _ whose official duties required them
â to hefhere. In the grounds were num
â  bers, of the common people â the sort
1 which would flock to executions, if such
â¢ entertainment were made public, and
.: take. their lunches and their babies
with them. They wept through that
part of the ceremony which affected
them most â the gentle Hawaiian tears
which run so freely, so silently, so
frankly when their hearts are moved.
The crowd stretched away under the
shade of palm and bread fruit tree to
where the high wrought-iron gates di
vided It from the other crowd without.
Women mounted on the benches pro
vided for the transports' feast; men
climbed to the dizzy stands photo
graphers had erected on the grounds.
The deep balconies of the Executive
building were packed from the railings
to the walls. From the giddy height of
the Judicial building's tower men and
women both looked down upon the
scene. All white Honolulu came to see
the raising of the American above the
Hawaiian Hag. All Hawaii wept in its
mournful homes or went to lie weep
ing on the graves of its dead while its
national colors were lowered to the
ground.
The troops from the Philadelphia
blocked the drive before the stand â a
solid square of white duck uniforms
set sharply against the green. The
Hawaiian Band was placed to the left of
the platform â not all the Hawaiian
Band â for eighteen of its members re
fused to play Hawaii Ponoi to the pass
ing of their Flag. The rest remained
to pay it this last tribute of their love.
And one knows not which toj>lty and
to honor more.
The simplicity of the ceremony was
admirable. The whining protest of the
Annexation Club had no more influ
ence with Admiral Miller than the idle
wir;<ls that blow. God love him for a
true and tactful gentleman. I would
he might have even cut the prayer
with which the simple ceremony opened
and the ex-Ministerial speech with
which It closed. Neither was impres
sive, although I doubt not both were
sincere.
The official party walked in the or
der of its separate ranks and stood ex
tremely stiff. I understand, upon the or
der of its p. ing. It is idled about that
a Consul General resigned from the
friendship of the United States Minis
ter because a Militia Colonel was given
; precedence in the march. The exact
: order of this I don't personally remem-
I ber, beyond the fact that Minster Se
wall and President Dole w lk^d to
gether and Admiral Miller with his
staff. It was raining briskly as they
' moved uncovered to the stand and
courtesy demanded that umbrellas
should be closed. The Reverend G. L.
; Pearson of the Methodist Church
I prayed this prayer, with pious face up
j lifted to the dripping skies:
O Lord, our Heavenly Father, the high
and mighty ruler of the universe, who
â  hast made of one blood all nations to
dwell upon all the face of the earth, and

most earnestly pray thee to remember
her native sons and daughters. Be thou
their friend and savior, and by thy prov
idential care may all things wiirk to
gether for good to them. May all the
j people appreciate the greatness of their
1 inheritance this day received, and may all

peace he conserved and intensified by

publics redound to thy honor In the well

0 Lord, remember our bolov.Hi Presl

peace that shall secure justice to an op

O thou eternal God. come thou and

may thy will be done on earth as It is
heaven through Jesus Christ our Sav

Then the United States Minister
Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordi
nary, his Excellency, Harold M Sewall
spoke to Pr^sid^nt Dole:
Mr. President: I present you a certi
fied copy of a Joint^ resolution of the (â¢
f-'i'-*' 1 :>? f ' l-nlted States, approved l.v
the President on July 7. 1&& enUtled
"Joint resolution to provide for annexine
tho Hawaiian Islands to the UniteS
States." This lolnt resoluUon accepte
ratines and confirms on tho nart of thA
United States the cession formally con
sented to and approved by the republic of
Hawaii.
And President Dole replied:
Mr. Minister: A treaty of nolltlni
union having lieon made, and the cession
formally consented to by the- republic of
Hawaii having been accepted by thp
T'nlted States of America. I now in to
Interest of the Hawaiian body politic and
with full confidence in the honor, justice
and friendship of the Amorlrun peonle
yield up to you as tho representative of"
the Government of tho T'nlted States the
sovereignty and public property of the
Hawaiian Islands.
And the United State* Minister spoke
again:
Mr. President: In the name of the
United States I accept the transfer of the
sovereignty and property of the Hawaiian
Government. The admiral commanding
the United States naval forces in these
waters will proceed to perform the duty
entrusted to him.
Admiral Miller responded with a sim
ple, wordless gesture full of dignity,
and, one would say, "-ompassion.
It was the moment for which every
one waited. A shiver ran over the
crowd, standing now upon the platform
âa voiceless murmur passed beneath
the trees. Thousands of eyes were lift
ed to where Hawaii's colors flung chelr
last tnessage to the breeze. The rain

From the quivering throats of the di

drooped, slipped along the rope. A soft
wind stirred the languid folds, lifted

sounds taps over the grave of Hawaii's
flag.
The Stars and Stripes mounted to thp
bugle call â to the cheers of the crowd,
to the sudden gay sunlight, to a brisk
and stirring breeze, to the triumphant
music- of "The Star-Spangled Banner"
by the Philadelphia band. The starry
splendor spread wide against the sky.
The guns boomed out the salute â the
same salute for quick and dead.
America's dominion was declared over
the Hawaiian Isles.
There was something lacking from
the cheering. s<?mething wanting from
the joy. Perhaps before the soul's eyes
of those who have worked so long and
earnestly to this end the ghost of Ha
waii nel walked that instant over
America's new possessions.
NOT YET DEAD.
The Committee of the Primaries Still
in the Field.
The Harncyltes are not talking much of
late, but there is a lot of thinking going
on among the defeated faction. The Mc-
Nab-Alford committee is taking the flat
tering unction unto itself in the belief
that the nrimary committee will confess
lts<lf destroyed and withdraw from the
local fight. To this the Harneyites say
nothing, but smile, and behind that mani
festation of contempt is an indication
that the local Democracy will be cleaved
in twain. Major Harney will not commit
himself in one way or the other. He says
that nothing has yet been determined as
to the future actions of the party which
he claims is the only bona fide repre
sentative oÂ». the true Democracy in this
city.

HAWAII'S FLAG
LOWERED-OLD
GLORY HOISTED
Impressive Scene Marking the
Transfer of Sovereign
Rights.
The Island National Guard Takes the Oath of
Allegiance to the Government of the
United States.
HONOLULU, Aug. 12.â Precisely at
eight minutes to 12 o'clock to-day the
Hawaiian flag descended from the flag
staffs on all the Government buildings
and exactly at five minutes to the same
hour the stars and stripes floated on
the tropical breeze from every official
flagstaff.
The ceremony was a most impressive
one. To hear the strains of "Hawaii
Ponoi" for the last time as a national
emblem, to hear the bugle blow taps
as the Hawaiian ensign sank from its
position, and to notice the emotion of
many who had been born under it and
had lived their lives under it, was sol
emn. But then came the bright call
for raising Old Glory, and the strains
of the "Star-Spangled Banner" broke
forth as that banner was unfurled to
the breeze. Then the cheers broke
forth, and eyes that had been dim for
a few moments became bright and
lightened up when the stars and stripes
blew out.
The ceremonies began with the de
parture of the First Regiment of the
j National Guard of Hawaii from the
drill shed at ten minutes to 11 this
morning. The parade was headed by
j a detachment of twenty-six police, un
j der command of Captain Kanae and
I Lieutenant Warren. Then came the Ha
waiian band and the drum corps.
It was Just 11:15 when the troops
â  reached the main gates of the Execu
tive building. Several hundred of the
Citizens' Guard preceded them up the
j main avenue and took a station on the
I left of the stand. The police deployed
lon either side of the avenue. The Ha
! waiian band took up a position on the
j right of the platform and the Phila
j delphia band on the left. The first
! battalion of the Hawaiian regiment oc
j cupled the immediate left of the stand
! and the second battalion was on the
| right. The naval forces were stretched
across the avenue in double files, the
marines being in front.
On the right of the main steps were
the halyards from which the big Ha
waiian flag floated in the breeze. The
detail in charge of these halyards and
the hauling down of the Hawaiian flag
were Corporal H. F. Kilbey and Pri
vates O. Wlnkler and A. Spillner of
| Company E. The detail of men in
charge of the raising of the American
' flag was in command of J. Ward,
j cockswain of the admiral's barge.
The flag itself was in charge of G. H.
Platt, gunner's mate of the Philadel
phia, and R. Winters, boatswain's mate
of the Mohican. These are the men
who actually raised the stars and
stripes over Hawaii.
President Dole and his Cabinet came
from the Executive building to the
platform. The Justices of the Supreme
Court followed, and then Admiral J. N.
Miller and United States Minister Har
old M. Sewall came down the steps, fol
lowed by captains C. H. Wadleigh of
the Philadelphia and S. M. Book of the
Mohican and their staff officers, and
Colonel Barber of the First New York
regiment.
The ceremonies were opened with
prayer by the Rev. G. L. Pearson, pas
tor of the First Methodist Church of
this city. United States Minister Se
wall then arose, and addressed Presi
dent Dole, notifying him of the passage
by Congress of the annexation resolu
tion. President Dole answered, sur
rendering the sovereignty and public
property of the Hawaiian Islands.
The Hawaiian band played "Hawaii
i Ponoi," the national anthem. Colonel
Fisher gave the order to the National
| Guard battery, stationed on the Execu
; tive grounds, in command of Lieuten
ant Ludwig, to fire the national salute
j of twenty-one guns, wnich was also
\ repeated by the guns of the Philadel
phia. As the echo of the last gun rever
' berated in the hills a bugle sounded
i and the national ensign of Hawaii
: oame slowly down until it reached the
ground, never to go up again.
There was a short pause, then the
i admiral nodded slightly to Lieutenant
Winterhalter. who gave the order.
"Colors! Roll Off." The flagship band
struck up the well-known strains of the
"Star-spangled Banner." and as the
stars and stripes slowly ascended there
was breathless suspense. But as it
! reached the top cheers broke forth from
the crowds below, and salutes of
twenty-one guns were again fired by
j the Hawaiian battery and the Philadel
phia.
A few minutes after the hoisting of
the official flag others were raised from
the two side towers and from the mili
tary headquarters. Minister Sewall
then read the following proclamation:
To the Government and People of the
Hawaiian Islands:
By the terms of the joint resolution by
whicb the cession of the Hawaiian Isl
ands and their dependencies to the United
States of America is concluded, it is pro
vided that until Congress shall provide
for the governme:.t of Hawaii, "all the
civil, judicial and military powers exer
cised by the officers of the existing gov
ernment" are to be vested in such person
or persons, and to bp exercised in such
manner as the President of the United
States shall direct. In the exercise of the
power thus conferred upon him by the
joint resolution, the President hereby di
rects that the civil, judicial and military
powers in question shall be exercised by
the officers of the republic of Hawaii, as
it existed just prior to the transfer of
sovereignty, subject to his power to re
move such officers and to fill vacancies.
All such officers will be required at once
to take an oath of allegiance to the
United States, and all the military forces
will be required to take a similar oath,
and all bonded officers will be required to
renew their bonds to the Government of
the United States.
The powers of the Minister of Foreign
Affairs will, upon the transfer of the
sovereignty and proprty of Hawaii to the
United States necessarily cease, so far as
they relate to the conduct of diplomatic
intercourse between Hawaii and foreign
powers.
The municipal legislation of Hawaii, ex
cept such as was enacted for the fulfill
ment of the treaties between that country
and foreign nations, and except such as
is Inconsistent with the joint resolution
or contrary to the constitution of the
United States, or to any existing treaty
of the United States, is to remain in
force till the Congress of the United
States shall otherwise determine. The
existing customs relations of Hawaii with
the United States and with other coun
tries are to remain unchanged till Con
gross shall have extended the customs
laws and regulations of the United States
to the islands.
Under these various provisions the gov
ernment of the islands will proceed with
out interruptions.
HAROLD M. SEWALL.
I Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Pleni
potentiary of the United States of
America.
Honolulu. H. L, Aug. 12. IS9B.
Following the reading of the procla
! mation Minister Sewall made the fol
lowing address:
Fellow Countrymen: I congratulate you
I on the consummation this day records â
i a consummation, not a change â the in
evitable consummation of the national pol
icies and the natural relations between
the two countries now formally and in
dissolubly united.
Inevitable as has been this union, we
may rejoice that It will take its place in
I history with the awakening of the Ameri
i can people to a sense of their responsi-
I iitlity among nations, in that splendid pro
cession of events begun at Manila, and
which has now embraced these islands in
its broad sweep.
You are no strangers to your country-
I men across the sea, bound to them as you
are by the achievements of their sons and
brothers here, and by all the activities
I that make up a country's life. You are
no strangers, certainly not in the mo
mentous present. For as it comes to
every nation in the dread ordeal of war
i to test the loyalty of all its sons and
the devotion of all its friends,
so they have tested you, tried you
and found you true â when you refused
to listen to the suggestions of the selfish
and the timid, and at your peril offered
up all that these islands had to offer, as
a sacrifice on the altar of devotion to a
country you had not yet the right to call
your own.
And your countrymen can never forget
that this loyalty and devotion and the
opening of hearts and homes to our sol
dier boys that followed this was not the
I loyalty, the devotion and the hospitality of
j Americans, though this were sweet in
deed, but of men who sought to be Ameri
cans and had been denied, of men who
| founded a state for the purpose of admis
sion to the American Union and had been
denied, of men who presented this strange
spectacle to the world that they stood
ready, as you gentlemen about me to-day,
to give up office and power and personal
emoluments and glory, for the simple dig
nity of American citizenship. Even as
you have given up a flag you love and
surrendered the sovereignty of these
beautiful islands, that Hawaii may take
her place, however humble that place may
be, In the protecting circle of sovereign
American States.
- This is the consummation you witness
to-day, which you and your children's
children have a right t<> celebrate, and let
there be no mistake as to its meaning.
I It means the triumph of no party or fac
tion among you, the opportunity for no
personal glorification or personal resent
â  ment, the confirmation in power of no ;ui
' thority over you that shall not commend
I itself to the sense of fairness and of jus-
I tice of the representatives of the Ameri-
I can people, but rather the burial of pant
i prejudices, the obliteration of narrow di
1 visions and the ultimate political advance
ment of the humblest citizen over whom
this flag shall float.
But It is not for you to rest content in
the enjoyment of free institutions. It is
for you to help maintain them, to main
tain them In the spirit they will be ex
tended to you. In the spirit you have
sought them, in the spirit of fraterni'y
and equality, in the spirit of the constitu
tion itself, now the supreme law of your
land, to establish justice, to insure your
tranquillity, to provide for the common
defense, to promote your welfare, and to
secure the blessings of liberty to your
selves and your posterity.
This is the work before you, my coun
trymen, and I bid you advance to it.
Hand In hand may you go, you of the
home' race with those whose fathers" land
this was, and whose generous virtues
have won for them the regard of all man
kind. Hand in hand may you go with
them as they carry with them their un
faltering love of country into the broad
plane of American citizenship.
Advance to the uplifting and upbuilding
of this land to prove it worthy to share
the destiny of the great republic. .
Empire may wait indeed, but no hand
save His who holds in the hollow of his
hand the fate of nations, can stay that
destiny.
God bless you. my countrymen.
God bless the United States of America.
At the conclusion of the ceremonies
the National Guard was marched to the
parade grounds, where Minister Cooper
administered the oath of allegiance to
Colonel Fisher. The colonel then ad
ministered it to his officers and Jie <ap
tai's to the men. The regiment then
escorted the naval battalion to their
boats and returned to the drill shed.to
sipn the rolls.
Never in the history of the -islands,
not even in the palmy days of the. mon
archy, has there been such a crush at
the executive building as was witnessed
at the reception and ball !ast night,
Riven in honor of the flag raising.
Estates in Probate.

estate of Maria T. Divine was filed yester-
day. The estate consists of real estate

Special Correspondenc* of The Call.
BY PRIVATE FRED A. HEALY.
CAMP DEWET, July 26.â The Peking
it, scheduled to start on her homeward
trip to-morrow, and consequently
every man in camp who has a moment
to himself is busied in compiling close
ly written and much-soiled manuscript
which will serve to cheer and comfort
the folks at home.
There may be lots to say which will
interest and amuse friends and rela
tives, but the monotony here has be
come so deadly that little or nothing
occurs that would hold public attention
lor a second's time. Everything is so
constant and recurs with such regu
larity that it is hard to imagine it could
po;-*sibly interest any one. Rain con
tinues day and night with such per-
Bistfnce that a clear sky would be to
the American army before Manila as
great a marvel as was the moon to the
crusaiere before Ascalon. We go to
bed in wet clothes, we get up and dress
in the morning in clothes still damp.
They become still more damp as we
stand in line for roll-call. Drill makes
them wringing wet, in which condition
they continue until we retire to the ele
gant privacy of our shelter tents.
In regard to these same tents I must
say they are indeed a great conveni
ence and comfort to troops in the field.
They are light to pack and as a rule
they are dry and serviceable. The only
fault the troops lind with them is that
they are too small. If they were about
eighteen inches longer and had an ad-
Oitional width of say two teet they
would be minutely more comfortable
and just as easy to carry.
Yesterday the sergeant major took a
boat and some men to row it (lor be It
known the volunteer non. cum., be he
corporal or sergeant, never under any
circumstances does anything in the
way of manual labor, in which respect
he differs from his regular brother, who
not only tells the men what to do but
shows them how to do it. Possibly most
el our --"ii. comb, have an excellent
reason for not following this example
in the second particular) and started
off to Cavite to call for the mail which
arrived by the Newport. With com
mendable and characteristic judgment
he brought over the papers and left the
letters behind. He is not popular in
camp to-day.
The crackling rifle flre which goes on
almost continually in the trenches and
sounds for all the world like a huge
brush fire, has had the effect of work
ing the boys Into a perfect fever of im
patience to take a hand. To-day a re
port has obtained circulation to the ef
fect that General Merritt will await the
arrival of the fourth expedition before
commencing active o-perations. The
corresponding depression among the
rank and tile is great indeed. The news
of the terrible slaughter which was
measured out to our gallant namesake,
the First Regulars, before the defenses
of Santiago has been received here, but
the effect is hardly what would have
been anticipated. There was both
much sorrow and admiration among
the boys, and the desire for vengeance
was so strong when the story was first
told that I don't believe there was a
man in the whole regiment who would
not have been willing to attempt the
storming of Manila with a single
platoon. However, if the mills of God
grind slowly they likewise grind surely,
and I suppose our chance will come
sooner or later. When it does come I
am sure the whole regiment will say,
"Let us do as did our boys on the other
side of the world, and, whatever the
end. we will have done well."
This is an exceedingly peculiar war in
Borne respects. Here we are within easy
range of the Spanish cannon. The
situation of our camp is easy to de
termine, notwithstanding the trees
which surround it, and still it is not
shelled. Why this is thus I am unable
PRESIDENT DOLE TRANSFERRING HIS fJUThjORITY OVER HAWAII TO MINISTER
SEWALL, THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNITED STATES.

to say. Common report has it that
Dewey has forbidden the Spanish to
commence any such action under pen
alty of suffering a bombardment them
selves. If this is so it is the first time
1 ever knew of one commander telling
another to be good or be spanked.
Another thing which excites consid
erable comment is the method employed
to gather wood for cooking purposes.
There are plenty of deserted houses
hereabouts and miles on miles of dry
fences which would be excellent for
kindling purposes. Yet we are not al
lowed to touch them for fear we may
displease a few cut-throat natives who
would sack the whole country if they
had half a chance. The consequence is
that the boys often go hungry to bed
while tons upon tons of provisions are
lying around just waiting for a chance
to jump into the kettles.
The whole proposition seems to be
that we must carry on a war, but un
der no circumstances must we offend
any one.
These natives here are not the people
we were led to imagine they were.
They are a small, undersized, treach
erous and penurious people, given over
to dirt and ugliness. They profess the
greatest friendship for Americans,
whom they look upon as a peculiar sort
of manna which has been blown upon
their shores from across the ocean; and
the soldiers are to them beings the rob
bing of whom is to the islander an al
most religious obligation. It is hardly
necessary to say they never allow the
obligation to go unfulfilled.
The boys have learned to hate them
with almost the fervor of their hatred
of the Spanish and if the day comes, as
it probably will, when we have to teach
them a lesson it will be one they will
never forget.
Sergeant Dan Nicolls. who fell down
the hatch of the Peking and seriously
injured his spine, died last night in the
hospital at Cavite. He was a graduate
of St. Mary's College in San Francisco.
He was well liked, not only by the men
of H Company, of which he was a mem
ber, but by the whole regiment in which
he was a universal favorite. His
death, the first and only one which has
thus far occurred in the regiment, is to
be attributed directly to the criminal
negligence of the people on the Peking
and should be thoroughly investigated
when the news reaches home. It is
merely the natural outcome of the in
difference and negligence with which
the troops were treated while under the
tender care of Uncle Collis and his ad
viser and abettor, the saturnine
Schwerin.
The boat is waitinp for the mail so
for the present au revoir to the mothers
of San Francisco from their sons at the
front. __^______^_

HEARTY GREETING TO
MERRITT AND GREENE
AT CAVITE ARSENAL
Gun Crew of the pighting Olympia the First to
Cheer t^e New Governor of the
Philippines.
BY SOL N. SHERIDAN.
PAVITE ARSENAL, July 17.â The
second expedition has come into port.
It straggled in after somewhat dis
quieting fashion and greatly to the re
gret of every man in camp the Monte
rey did not show her grim front along
with the rest. The air here is full of
the most disquieting rumors about the
coming of a Spanish fleet by way of
Suez to relieve Manila, and even the
naval men, heroes though they are,
would feel much more comfortable if
the great guns of the formidable moni
tor were In position to be trained upon
the batteries of the Junetta. The Mon
terey was left at^Honolulu to be towed
across to Guam by the Brutus, we are
told, and she is expected here not later
than Juiy 2Sâ but Manila may have fal
len by that time if the opanish fleet
does not get here in the meantime, and
anyway the Monterey in tow of the
Brutus' will bo something like the blind
leading the half blind. The monitor is
the faster craft of the two, as witness
the fact that she was first into Honolu
lu harbor. She will be doubly welcome
for the delay when she does come, and
once in the harbor Spain may send her
whole remaining "fleet to the Philippines
if it suits her purpose to lose the .ships
she has. I do not suppose, if Schley
and Sampson have done what was ex
pected of them, there are many left by
this time.
The fleet came straggling in, as I
have said, the China arriving first. She
dropped her anchor over against Sang
ley Point at a little before sunset last
night, and there was much speculation
concerning the fate of the balance of
the ships until it became known that
the second expedition had come as a
kind of go as you please affair, the
China reaching port first because of
superior speed. This morning the Zea
landia. Colon and Senator, escorted by
the Boston, which met them at Cape
Angana. came in and then it was the
delay to the Monterey cast gloom over
the camp.
The boys on board the ships were in
good health for the most part, although
there had been four deaths on the fleet
en route. Lieutenant Lazelle of the
Eighteenth Infantry died July 12 from
measles, two days after leaving Hono
lulu. He had be-en ill all the way out
and when he contracted measles did not
have sufficient strength to rally. The
body was embalmed and buried this
afternoon at San Roque â the first
American soldier to rest in the soil of
Luzon. He had been on board the
Colon.
Wilcox Wise, member of the band of
the Nebraska volunteers, died on the
China July 5. Private Elmer B. Mat
tox of the Eighteenth died on the Colon
July 9, and there was another death,
that of a private, G. L. Geddis of Com
pany C, Nebraska, on the Senator. All
these were buried at sea.
But if the fleet did not include the
Monterey, there was on board the China
what, to the soldier boys, was infinitely
better than a score of monitors. There
was a mail from home! Every boy in
camp had a letter from some one who
loved him, and it is pleasant, 8000 miles
from home, to feel you are not forgot
ten. There was something, also, not
quite so dear perhaps as a letter from
home, something putting the lads in
touch with the world they had left be
hind them. Here The Call scored. If
you had known how the First Califor
nia and the Second Oregon would have
rushed for these papers, how they
would almost have mobbed me in good
natured scramble for the news as I
made my way with an orderly through
the men's quarters, how the officers
themselves would have reached out
eagerly for news, you would have sent
me ten times as many papers as you
did for distribution. The Call was the
first San Francisco newspaper in camp.
The Call reaches one-tnird of the way
around the world to score against its
rivals.
The China brought down, besides the
mail, a postmaster and two clerks, who
will follow the army. You know all
that, naturally, better than we do.
What you do not and cannot know is
the great boon this will confer upon the
boys who are fighting for their coun
try so far from home.
There has been more heavy firing
from out Manila way this morning, as
there is every Sunday, but I do not
think it portends anything further than
you have already learned from my
cables. At all events. I will go to the
front to-morrow and see whether Malate
has fallen into insurgent hands. I have
a. notion, by the way, that we will all
go to the front before many days.
When we do the doom of Spain will be
written.
The disembarkation of the troops will
be commenced to-morrow. Where they
will be quartered is as yet an open
question, but most of them will prob
ably go into the quarters lately vacated
by the Spanish prisoners, and the bal
ance in the town of Cavite. General
Anderson, who yesterday made a per
sonal reconnoissance of Malibon, has not
yet given orders for the placing of the
soldiers, but will do so the first thing
to-morrow morning.
The officers who came on the China
complain most bitterly of the treatment
received at the hands of the Pacific
Mail officialsâ and as for the noldiers
brought through the tropics like Chi
nese coolies in the hold of the big
steamer, their curses are loud and
deep. Lieutenant Schwerin wanted to
collect $3 50 a day for table board, to
begin with, although he abated the
price to $1 50 upon being pressed. Then
the Ice machine broke down, and so of
ficers and men drank warm water for
most of the voyageâ and complained
so much of the excessive rate for
board General Greene was compelled to
call a board of inquiry at last to in
vestigate the matter. The board de
cided in favor of the $1 50 rate, not
wishing to hold the ship's officers re
sponsible for Lieutenant Schwerin's
sins. Nevertheless the officers refused,
four days out of Manila, to pay the
charge, tendering $1 Instead â and have
not paid it yet.
The men on the Senator suffered
great hardships, having lived c.i grain
for ten days before reaching port.
The expedition stopped at Wake Isl
and, a deserted rock in the Pacific,
where General Green went ashore and
raised the American flag. Then the
ships dropped down to Gaum, but not
finding tho expected escort there from
Dewey's fleet, came on without enter
ing the harbor.
MERRITT'S ARRIVAL
WAS UNEXPECTED
MANILA, P. 1., July 26.â Major Gen-
eral Wesley Merritt, the first Military
Governor of the Philippines under the
American administration, arrived here
yesterday on board the transport New
port, and at once assumed command of
the forces under Brigadier Generals
Anderson and Greene. His arrival was
so quiet and unostentatious that but
for the salute from the flagship
Olympia in his honor, after he had paid
his first official visit to Rear Admiral
Dewey, it might have escaped notice of
many of his subordinates.
From the fleet in Manila harbor, off
Cavite, the smoke of the Newport was
seen hours before she passed Corregi
dor Island, and all sorts of conjectures
were made as to her identity. At 11
o'clock a. m. she steamed into the har
bor, and was met by the Concord,
which was dispatched to interview the
stranger. A few minutes later she
came within signaling distance, when it
was discovered who and what she was.
Immediately preparations were made
to give her and her distinguished pas
senger a fitting reception by the fleet,
and as she slowly passed the Olympia
the latter's crew roared out three hear
ty cheers for the Governor, which were
returned with a will by the troops on
board the Newport, and echoed by the
crew of the Charleston, alongside of
which vessel she anchored at noon.
Major-General Merritt immediately
visited the flagship, where he remained
for over an hour, discussing the situa
tion with Rear-Admiral Dewey. As he
returned to the Newport in the Ad
miral's barge, his authority was offi
cially recognized by the firing of a sa
lute of thirteen guns from the flagship,
and almost before the echo of the last
gun had died away every man in the
American forces knew the man for
whom they had been waiting had ar
rived.
Owing to the rain, which poured in
cessantly'all afternoon, no attempt was
made to'land the troops from the New
port; but this will undoubtedly be done
as soon as the weather clears suffi
ciently to admit of transferring the
men to their new quarters ashore.
Except for .a few cases of sickness,
none of which were serious, the troops
on board the Newport arrived in splen
did condition, their trip across the Pa
cific having been an ideal one, so far as
the weather conditions are concerned.
The condition of the troops already
encamped at Paranaje, a few miles
south of Manila, is anything but an en
viable one. For the past three days it
has rained torrents, almost incessantly,
and the men have been compelled to
erect bamboo platforms beneath their
shelter tents. In order to avoid sleeping
upon the wet ground. Even this pre
caution, however, does not ensure them
against the moisture of the atmos
phere, which dampens everything under
cover almost as effectually as the rain
does in the open. As the natural se
quence of this state of affairs, the sick
lists of the various regiments are grad
ually increasing every day; and unless
the weather abates, or the troops are
returned to the barracks at Cavite, the
medical corps will assuredly have its
hands full in the near future.
Outside of the few acres of untilled
land upon which the camp is situated
the country between Paranaje and M.i
nila is in such a water-logged state
that it will be utterly impossible to
move troops over it in the direction of
the beseiged city for a week or more,
even though the rain ceases, the roads
being literal seas of mud, between
paddy fields entirely under water. So
far, the artillery has not made an ef
fort to move to the front, owing to the
lack of means of transportation. The
only horses, outside of Manila, are a
few undersized ponies, scarcely larger
than Shetlands, which, however, are
only used for light traffic, either under
saddle or In ligrht two-wheeled vehi
cles, called caramettas. All draft
work is done by buffalo, which are none
too plentiful just now. It has been
suggested that the roads to Manila be
corduroyed with bamboo, but this
would entail an enormous amount )f
labor and material.
Meanwhile the bare-footed natives
plod to and from the trenches between
the camp and the enemy, and continue
their farcical warfare, day after day,
with undampened ardor, and an evi
dent desire to let the Spaniards know
that they, at least, are at war with
Spain. Except for the occasional ex
changes of compliments between the
Spanish and insurgent forces in the
trenches, it would be difficult to believe
that a state of war existed here, for
the American soldiers stroll within
range of the Spanish riflemen almost
every day, and only one, a Coloradan,
who was accidentally shot in the leg
by a spent bullet, has. so far, received
a scratch. So far as the forts are con
cerned the gunboats Concord, McCul
loch and Callao steam within range
every day upon various missions, yet
not a single shot has been fired in their
direction.
The American outposts, on the con
trary, seldom miss an opportunity for
a shot at the Spaniards whenever they
are within range.
VICTORY FOR THE RED
CROSS AT CAVITE
Causes tho Release of Four Spanish
Doctors Because of Their
Profession.
BY SOL N. SHERIDAN.
CAMP DEWEY, HEADQUARTERS
SECOND BRIGADE. AMERICAN EX
PEDITIONARY FORCES. BEFORE
MANILA. July 29.â The Red Cross has
scored its first victory in the war in
the East. When the Charleston took
the island of Guam the health officer
of the port of San Luis d'Apra was
taken away to Cavite as one of the
Spanish Government officials. The doc
tor did not, at that time, claim the
protection of the Red Cross. The doc
tor is a well-read man, but it is doubt
ful whether, as was the case with the
Tagallo surgeons, who all put on the
emblem of Geneva, with certain bar
baric modifications so soon as they saw
the American surgeons so tricked out,
he had ever given the Geneva conven-
tion one moment's consideration. Span
iards may be learned, some of them.
They are almost never merciful.
The doctor from Guam, when he
reached Cavite, did claim the privilege
of his profession and, after three more
Spanish doctors were taken, it was
granted him and he was released yes
terday and sent into Manila.
The doctors who returned were Jose
Romera Aguilar from Guam, Antonio
Harricado, Antonio Rocha and Cypri
ano de Porte.
The Governor of Guam has not been
returned to Manila and will not be. He
has forfeited his life to the law of Spain
because he gave up his post without
firing a shot, and as he long ago, by
his cruelty as Governor of Cavite, gave
mortal offense to the Tagallos, he does
not feel exactly safe even in the middle
of an army of Yankees. His heart's
desire, he says, is to go to the United
States and transform himself into a
good American.
To go back to the doctor. I am re
minded that Dr. Farrell "of ours" be
came the most popular man in camp
at once upon the arrival of the New
port with General Merritt on board.
Dr. Farrell was a popular officer before
that, of course, and will continue popu
lar. His sudden excess of popularity
was due to a matter entirely apart from
regimental duty; was due, in fact, to
the thoughtfulness of his friends of the
Cosmos Club, who sent him the files
of all the illustrated papers, together
with a complete file of The Call from
May 27 to June 29. You cannot, getting
your papers every day, even faintly
picture to yourself the eagerness with
which every man in camp crowded to
the doctor's tent, awaiting his chance
at the papers and they were the more
eager because my file of papers was
looted by some thief in the Colorado
regiment, who, having the fear of
neither man nor the devil before his
eyes, left me but about six of the whole
bundle to go to a hungry regiment. As
to the Oregon lads, they got no papers
at all, being in Cavite and not on the
field.
Dr. Daywalt of San Francisco is
here with the Astor Battery and the
Third Artillery. Let not San Francisco
suppose, however, that the doctor is
with the Astors from choice., though he
speaks highly of them. A good soldier
goes where he is sent 'and Dr. Daywalt
is a good soldier.
The health of the boys in the field
continues good and the sick in the
brigade hospital at Cavite are all im
proving. Young Perkins, who seemed
to be dying with pneumonia a week
ago, has so far recovered that he is
anxious to be about and will be in a
day or two should he meet with no set
back.
CENTRAL PACIFIC
MAKE A PROPOSITION
NEW YORK, Aug. 22.â A special to the
Sun from Washington, says: The Central
Pacific Railway Company is preparing to
submit to the commission consisting of
Attorney General Griggs and Secretaries
Gage and Bliss, a proposition for the re- j
funding of the Government debt in ac- I
cordance with the terms of the provision
in the general deficiency bill authorizing
the commsslon to act. The law and fis
cal officers of the company are now at j
work on the proposition and as soon as
it is complete it will be submitted to the
Attorney General and his colleagues. In
view of Attorney General Griggs' state
ment that he was at work on the com
plaint to be -filed by the Government for
the foreclosure of its mortgage and that
as soon as it was finished he would begin
proceedings, it will be Interesting to note
which gets its work in first, the railroad
company or the Government.
Garcia's Resignation Accepted.
NEW YORK. Aug. 22.â A cablegram to
the Sun from Havana says: Calixto Gar
cia, the insurgent leader, who had trouble
with General Shafter at Santiago and ten
dered his resignation, has tendered his
resignation for the second time and It has
been accepted. General Luque was pre
paring to attack Glbara when tne news of
peace arrived.
Boiler Explosion at Carson.
CARSON, Nev., Aug. 22.â The bursting
of a boiler in the engine room of the
American Steam Laundry caused the
plant to be destroyed this afternoon, to
gether with the residence of H. H. Mil
lard, the proprietor. Damage $5000; no
insurance.
Some Glory for Aguinaldo.
LONDON, Aug. 22.â The Hongkong ccr
respondent of the Dally Mail says: Gen
eral Merritt and Aguinaldo agreed Lhat
the latter shall govern outside of Manila
for the present.
The Enormous Gold Product of 1898.
This will be the greatest gold year in his
tory. From South Africa, the Klondike and
Australia the precious metal Is being shipped
in large quantities. It is believed that this
year's output will be nearly double that of any
previous twelve months. The sales of Hostet
ter's Stomach Bitters are also increasing very
fast, and this year that famous retried* will
cure more people of dyspepsia, indigestion,
constipation, nervousness and weakness than
ever before.

â¢ .'' Special Correspondence of The Call.
BY HORACE WRIGHT.
HONOLULU, Aug. 16. â Attorney
General Smith has tendered his resig
nation, but leaves himself entirely in
the hands of President McKlnley, not
â being desirous of embarrassing the ad
ministration. The name of Hon. Paul
â¢ Neumann is commonly mentioned as a
possible successor, as is also that of
Â«x- Minister F. M. Hatch, but this is
...done explicitly without their consent or
. authority. It is generally hoped, how
ever, that a local man will be selected
.' should Mr. W. O. Smith's resignation
be accepted.
Now politicians will talk and they
are freely talking about this resigna
tion, which they claim will be supple
: mented by a letter to President McKin
ley requesting him to decline to accept
it. They further state that the real
motive for Mr. Smith's action is that
. he has hitherto consulted and consorted
too much with the leaders of the Amer
ican Union party, whose almost openly
avowed object is the political downfall
of the Dole element in favor of those
who favor Harold M. Sewall for Gov
ernor and more progressive American
ism than is to be found under the wing
of the -family compact." Mr. Smith, it
Is understood, has generally consulted
â¢ the leaders of the American Union par
ty in regard to the filling of appoint
ments, but now that Mr. Pole is the
chief executive, and the appointment
of subordinates, it is assumed, is to be
.left by President McKinley to the heads
. of departments of the old republic of
Hawaii, with the approval of the ex
ecutive, it is felt that he no longer is
kingpin of the Cabinet and that he
will be reluctantly compelled to submit
to. the iniluence of those who prefer to
play the game â â ' harmony and recon
ciliation in preference to the familiar
slogan, "To the victors belong the
spoils. 11
. One of the most important subordi
nate posts in the Government is that
of the Registrar of Public Accounts. He
may be practically called the Cashier
of the Treasury Department. This po
sition has been ably filled under the
r>'iiublie by Captain William George
.Ashley, a Santa Clara County Califor
nian, and one who has endeared him
â¢ â  self to ail our visiting boys in blue,
white and brown by the excellent
.manner in which he hafl discharged the
..duties of chairman of our commissariat
committee. It is understood that at the
request of the Minister of Finance he
â  will retire from this position to accept a
very responsible one in the bank of
F.ish.'P & *'â '.. in fact, to act as the per
sonal representative of Hon. Samuel M.
,r. in order that the Mln
sumably Ministers retain
titles, as during the era of thePro
nal Government and prior to the
lishment of the republic) may de
vote the whole of his time to the
..finances of the Government.
â¢As perhaps indicating the desire of
the administration to prove its sincere
â¢ desire for friendship with the Hawaii
aHS, the position has been offered to
: . George W. Smithies, a part Hawaiian,
â  who held that office under Mr. Damon,
as well as other Important Government
positions during the monarchy, but
'who resigned to accept a more perma
nent position with Hon. John Ena. It
has been officially intimated that
whenever practicable subordinate po
sitions will be, for the time being,
placed at the refusal of part Ha- ;
waiians in preference to all others, but
it is learned this morning that Mr.
Smithies will probably decline the offer, j
on the grounds of the old adage, "Fear |
the Greeks who bring offerings." There
have been so many examples of bad
faith in the past in placing men in po
â¢ sitions for political motives and then,
removing them to make way for others
that Government billets are not so
much sought by the intelligent and act
ive Hass as they formerly were.
. An unpleasant incident occurred yes
terday. A number of Hawailans had
' been engaged by the Board of Public
"Works to assist in arranging for the
camp for the New Yorkers. On their
. arrival at the park to-day they came
to the conclusion that as they were
\vorking for the United States and not
'â  for or temporary Government they
â¢might to be paid $2 a day, as white
â¢ 'men. They disclaimed any political
1 feeling in the matter; it was simply a
.""question of American citizenship and
â  the exercise of their newly obtained
â¢ rights. The affair ended by the strikers
â¢ being dismissed in favor of others will
ing to work at the usual rate of $1 a
day.
â¢ : 'ihe Chinese consular agents cele
brated their Emperor's birthday on
Saturday last with an official reception
at which were present the Hawaiian

COOK CAN'T SPOIL.
Grape-Nuts Need No Cooking and the
I. Flavor Is Assured.
People want food that has a palata-
ble, toothsome taste, and one that will
: recall a pfeasant taste whenever the
name is mentioned. That feature is
a strong one in Grape-Nuts, the new
breakfast food, made by Postum Com-
pany, Battle Creek, Mich.
No cooking is required, hence the
taste is not dependent upon the cook,
but is just what the makers intended
It to be.
It is often served cold and dry with
a bit of rich cream in part of the sau-
cer.
If one wants a hot dish, a little hot
milk can be poured over some Grape-
Nuts and there you are, a most fetch-
Ing dish, furnishing the high nutritive
ya!ue of grape-sugar.
Grape-Nuts sold by grocers, (
ary and Envoy Extraordinary of the
United States to Hawaii and now Presi
dent McKinley's representative. The
child was named Arthur in honor of his
grandfather. Rev. Frank Thompson,
chaplain of the United States steam
ship Mohican, was the officiating
clergyman and Rear Admiral Miller,
U. S. N., and Miss N'ewlands were the
child's sponsors. The band of the
United States steamship Philadelphia
was in attendance.
The news that Hawaii may have a
battalion of United States Volunteers
is received with great interest here, but
it is much to be doubted whether the
battalion can be recruited. AYe have in
our "regulars" but twenty-eight men in
one company and thirty-two in another,
and it is very improbable that many
of the National Guard of Hawaii will
enlist for service. It will take a long
time for native Hawaiians to enroll al
though they would make good soldiers
and their company of the National
Guard of Hawaii is the victorious com
pany at the target. As a naval reserve
there would be a greater temptation,
for the natives make splendid sailors
and are almost intelligent amphibia,
GARRISON SOLDIERS
REACH HONOLULU
Schooner Charles Nelson Arrives at
the Islands Witli New Yorkers
Aboard.
BY HORACE WRIGHT.
HONOLULU, Aug. 16.â The steam
schooner Charles Nelson, with our gar
rison troops on board, arrived yester
day afternoon, shortly before sunset,
with all well on board. She was wel
comed opposite Waikikl by the steam
ship Eleu, bearing for the first time on
her voyage nf greeting the stars and
stripes, by the Attorney General, Col
onel Fisher, N. G. H., Chairman George
W. Smith and other members of the
citizens' welcome committee. Cheers
were interchanged lustily and the Nel
son docked at the Oceanic Steamship
Company's wharf. When Colonel Bar
ber went on board he was most vocifer
ously welcomed. The boys were bom
barded with fruit and proved their
adeptness as sports. They were imme
diately granted shore leave. This after
noon they marched out to their tem
porary camping ground on twelve
acres of land belonging to W. G. Irwin,
adjacent to Kapiolani Park, and the
race track, which will be used for mil
itary exercises.
One of the crew, Charles Hill, ship's
carpenter, was drowned in endeavor
ing to save the life of Private Harry
Bullock of Company C, who became
mentally deranged and jumped over
board. Bullock was saved and is now
awaiting investigation as to his mental
condition.
The Nelson returns to San Francisco
on the ISth.
Consul General Haywood reports that
he has on hand 21,000 tons of coal, 7000
navy and 14.000 army.
As Items of passing interest, it may
be stated that the citizens' committee
has so far expended &S.OOO in entertain
ing the boys in blue, and not one cent
Of that amount has been spent for beer
or liquor. Up to date the Officers' Club
of the National Guards have consumed
1800 g-allons of beer alone in entertain
ing their guests. Their wine and li
quor bill Is proportionately large. We
have money enough and to spare for
the 30.000 more men we hope to see pass
through.
JOHN R. M'LEAN MAY
RENOUNCE DEMOCRACY
Rumor That the Cincinnati Editor Is
to Succeed Secretary of War
Alger.
DAYTON, Ohio. Aug. 22.â A special
from the Cincinnati Times-Star was re
produced in the papers here to-night that
John K. McLean would not be^epre
sented by Chairman Dan McConvlllo,
Lewis O. Bernard, or any other of his
f'irmiT lieutenants, who are at this con
vention and the reason for him not tak
ing part was said to be due to the report
that John R. McLean is to succeed Gen
eral R. A. Alger as Secretary of War In
McKlnley'a Cabinet. This caused nvre
stir amonpr the delegates than anything
that has bÂ«'<;n sprung for years at Ohio
conventions.
It was conceded if McLean should be
come- McKinley's Secretary of War. and
Incinnati Enquirer an administration
paper, that it would cause a political rev
olution as McLean and his paper have
been the- most potent factors In this
State, as wll as in Kentucky, Indiana
and other Btates for free silver.
While Borne delegates are busy denounc
ing it as an ante convention sensation
and ridiculously absurd, it ie certainly
commanding more attention than other
matters which are not disputed.

ADMIRAL SCHLEY
OH till SICK LIST
Nerves Relax After the
Terrible Strain.
HIS CONDITION NOT ALARMING
NEEDS ABSOLUTE QUIET FOR A
FEW DAYS.
Now at the Home of His Daughter in
Bridgeport , Conn., and Will
Soon Be Restored to His
Normal Condition.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. 22.â A Bridgeport,
Conn., special to the Herald says:
Admiral Winfield Schley is slightly ill
at the home of his daughter, Mrs. R. S.
Wortley of Westport. He arrived
Saturday evening and soon after re
tiring complained of illness, and Dr. J.
G. Gregory of Norwalk was called.
Dr. Gregory said to-day: "After a
few* days absolute quiet Admiral Schley
will be out again. For seven weeks he
was floating on his steel-clad vessel in
an atmosphere the temperature of
which, he says, ranged from 100 to 105
degrees, without such food as men re
quire in hot weather, with the awful
strain of watching and waiting for tne
Spanish squadron to come out of the
harbor of Santiago. This was followed
by the excitement of the action of July
3 and of the reception of the squadron
in New York. Now the excitement has
passed and his nerves are relaxed. The
reaction after that experience has had
the effect of completely unnerving him
for a few days, but at the end of that
time he will return to his normal con
dition unless something unforeseen oc
curs."
PRESIDENT TO TAKE A
MUCH-NEEDED VACATION
After Filling and Instructing the
Peace Commission He Will Pay
a Visit to Ohio.
NEW YORK, Aug. 22.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
sends the following: Instructions to
the military commissioners to arrange
for the evacuation of Cuba and Porto
Rico and to the peace commissioners
for the settlement of the Philippine
question are now engrossing the atten
tion of the I'resident. I understand
that it is his intention to announce the
names of the peace commissioners and
formulate Instructions to the several
bodies before the end of the present
week. Important matters coincident to
the cessation of hostilities are also to
be disposed of this week in order that
the President may leave Washington
for a few weeks of much-needed rest.
His purpose now is to leave Washing
ton some time next week and review
the troops at Montauk Point. From
there he will go to Cincinnati, where
he will attend the Grand Army review
on September 5. Further than this he
has not yet made his plans, but when
he leaves Washington next week he
will probably not return for several
weeks.
The Cabinet meetings to-morrow and
on Friday will be of unusual import
ance, as it is expected that instructions
to the several commissions â which
means the shaping of the administra
tion's policy toward the Philippines as
well as Cuba and Porto Rico â will be
finally disposed of. I find there is still
a difference of opinion in the Cabinet
as to just h'>w far the United States
should go in its control of the Philip
pines.
The majority of the Cabinet and the
President, I have reason to believe,
are in favor of giving the peace com
missioners such Instructions as will se
cure the permanent cession of Luzon.
The minority will be satisfied with
Manila and Manila Bay. Secretary
Day, who will be a leading commis
sioner, belongs to the minority on this
question. Senator Davis, the other
member of the commission, definitely
settled upon, will, on the other hand,
favor all the Luzon islands if not the
entire Philippines.
The views of individual commission
ers, however, will not be of particular
importance, ir view of the fact that
the minimum limits nf our demands
will be fixed in the instructions to the
commissioners as a body, and it is to
be presumed they will carry them out
regardless of their Individual views.
There is still considerable uncertainty
as to the three commissioners yet to
be selected, but I was told to-night by
a Cabinet officer that former Secretary
Tracy and Justice White of the United
States Supreme Court would in -all
probability be Included in the list when
officially announced.

OREGON MAY BE SENT
TO THE PHILIPPINES
Will First Go to a Drydock and Then
Return to Duty on the Pacific
Station.
NEW YORK. Auk. 22.â -v Washington
special to the Perald says: it is the gen
eral opinion at the Navy Department that
the Oregon will be the first battleship to
be sent into drydock No. 3 at Brooklyn
when it is ready. The preference given
the Oregon has its meaning. It ie said the
battleship is to return to duty on the Pa
cific station as soon as she has been
docked and cleaned. She needs little or
no repairs. It is possible the Oregon may
be sent to the Philippines, although noth
ing definite has been determined by the
Navy Department.

SACRAMENTO, Aug. 22.â Thomas
Bissett, a printer in the employ of the
Sunday News, fired two shots at his
wife to-night at their residence, 816 L
street. One of the bullets passed
through her ear and scalp, inflicting a
painful but not dangerous wound. Mrs.
Bissett was removed to the Receiving
Hospital in the police ambulance, and
after having her wounds dressed was
able to leave for home. Her husband
made no attempt to resist arrest and
Is now occupying a cell in the City
Prison.
The shooting was the outcome of a
jealous quarrel, according to the wife's
statement. She claims that her hus
band is of a jealous disposition and ob
jected to her receiving her friend, Her
man Mealand, at the house. The latter
was seated in the front room with her
to-night, eating peanuts, when she
heard her husband at the front door.
Well knowing his disposition and re
membering his threats, she cautioned
young Mealand, and the latter made
his escape while her husband was en
tering the house by the side door.
Finding that Mealand had escaped,
her husband wreaked his vengeance by
shooting her. The first shot, she said,
stunned her and she fell to the floor.
While lying outstretched he deliberate
ly fired again, but missed her. She
feigned death and he moved away.
Seeing he had gone she rushed into the
street and was cared for by the neigh
bors until the arrival of the police am
bulance.
Captain W. 'Ash sent the woman to
the hospital and then entered the house
and placed the husband under arrest.
He admitted having done the shooting.
Bissett charges his wife with having
wrongful relations with Mealand, who
is the younger son of a well-known
physican of this city. He said he was
aware of their Intimacy and had
warned them both. On his return home
to-night from work he found the door
locked, and knowing Mealand was
present intended killing both. He has
no regret for his action.
Bissett is spoken of very highly by
his employer, Emmett Phillips, who
says he is a hard-working and Indus
trious man. Mrs. Bissett intends suing
for a divorce. They have been married
five years and have a child four years
old.
EXCITING RACE FOR LIFE.
Experience of the Crew on a Burning
Tug.
CHICAGO, Aug. 22.â With a fire un
der the deck. Captain Crawford ran his
tug, the Ira O. Smith, five miles under
a full head of steam toward the mouth
of the river. It was a race of steam
against fire, and steam won. For a time
the seven men on board were in danger
of being burned to death or drowned. As
it was, five of them were severely scorch
ed and burned.
While the tug was a mile off Lincoln
Park a fierce blaze was discovered in the
hold of the little craft that threatened
to destroy her. Battling with the flames,
holding the steam at the highest pres
sure and sounding signals of distress on
the whistle, the crew worked with fever
ish energy, while Captain Crawford,
keeping the tug at highest speed, made
the run to the river.
Thousands of pleasure seekers on Lake
Shore drive, at the edge of the lake,
watched the excitinr race against death.
Captain Crawford ordered the engines
turned pn to the full capacity and every
available man was sent to the pumps
to assist in fighting the blaze. Every
man stuck to his post, and when the
river was reached the flames were un
der control. In the river the blaze again
broke out. but was soon extinguished
by the fire boat Yosemite. The flre
started in a pile of kindling and waste
stored near the boiler.

HOW CALIFORNIA'S
PINE FORESTS ARE
BEING DEVASTATED
The Lumber Industry Carried Or>
Vigorously by F|uge Cor
porations.
In F'fty Years the Forests of Ttys State Will Have
Disappeared â Bush pres Wreak
Destruction.
"It will take from forty to fifty years
to use up the forests of California; that
is, if the production of lumber contin
ues at tho present rate. And the de
mand is likely to increase rather than
to decrease."
Mr. Van Arsdale is a timber king of
the biggest kind, so he did not make
this startling assertion without consid
ering the import of his words. We were
sitting on the veranda of a little cot
tage right in the heart of the pine
woods. All around were the giant firs,
so soon to be converted into prosaic
boards and boxes, while above us, in
sublime majesty, towered the magnifi
cent white-capped Shasta, ite scarred
volcanic sides flecked only here and
there by a patch of lingering snow. For
it has been a terribly hot and dry sum
mer and within the memory of -man
Mount Shasta has never appeared so
bare.
It Is hot, even though the fragrant
pines cast a grateful shadow around us,
and dusty, because the jtlttle clearing in
the woods is the scene of almost super
human activity and bustle. During the
present season a whole township has
sprung up in this secluded spot. Saw
mill? of the most modern pattern have
be*n erected, whole streets of small cot
taces cover the ground, a large club
room and bunk house have been put
up; all the appurtenances, in short, of a
big and permanent logging camp have
been created. The McCloud River
L nber Company is not handling this
enterprise timidly. It is out to get lum
ber and every appliance which capital
and skill can provide has been pressed
into service, in order to get the lumber
as cheaply and rapidly as possible.
What goes on here is going on at doz
ens of other mills throughout the btate.
wherever shrewd business men, pos
sessed of both brains and money, are
engaged in the timber trade; so that
one has no difficulty in accepting Mr
Van Arsdale's assertion as to the brief
life left our forests.
There is a puffing and snorting, a
creaking and groaning of wheels, and
from out the bush In front of 'is a huge
traction engine emerges. It drags be
hind itâ apparently without effortâ a
large wagon piled high with logs of
timber. As it passes along its great
wheels grind the friable soil into impal
pable powder, and vast clouds of chok
ing dust pollute the mountain air. All
through the woods you will come across
these uncouth monsters, noisily pur
suing their avocation. They never
grow tired, no task is too great for
their strength, no load too heavy for
them to haul; their mechanical activity
has signed the death knell of our giant
pines.
A little artificial lake, its surface cov
ered with floating logs, marks the end
of the traction engine's work. The buzz
caw takes up the contract, and day and
night, without cessation, its ripping,
whirring sound hums through the
woods. Properly speaking, there is
neither night nor day at these mills;
the electric light has changed all that.
It is Just one period of continuous work,
logs coming in at one end of the mill
and boards going out at the other,
throughout the whole twenty-four
hours.
The rapidity with which a huge log,
measuring perhaps eight feet in diam
eter, can be converted into boards is
something marvelous. The log is no
sooner hauled out of the water than
it is jerked on a traveling bench and
rushed against the revolving saw.
Slice after slice falls off and Is car
ried away on a traveler to be further
subdivided, and in a minute or two the
log, once part of a magnificent tree,
1b only a stack of boards on a railroad
car, awaiting transportation to San
Francisco, or it may be, to the other
side of the Pacific. There are sugar
pines now standing In the McCloud
forests which, within thirty days, must
be on their way to Australia in the
form of boards. There are contracts
which must be kept, and ships which
must sail at the appointed date, so
that, in less than three months, our
forest giants will be incorporated Into
some Sydney dwelling house.
Everybody who appreciates the skill
and energy with which the lumber
business is being handled will under
stand how rapidly our forests, once
the pride of the State, are disappear
ing. And the worst of it is, we are
taking no steps to check the waste, no
measures to reforest the denuded por
tion of our domain. Capitalists buy
the land and strip it of Its timber
without any consideration for the
wants of posterity. We cannot blame
them, for the law, as it stands, gives
them their privilege. It is the duty
of the State to take measures to check
this waste, and to preserve for all time
a crop which, if properly husbanded,
would be of Inexhaustible value to the
country.
The pity of it is that it is now too
late to replace many of our finest trees.
Mr. Van Arsdale declares positively
that there will be no second growth
of sugar pine. "The conditions under
which the sugar pine grew," he says,
"have passed forever. The climate
has changed or something has hap
pened, but whatever the cause, the su
gar pine does not come up again. There
Is a piece of land at Truckee which, to
my certain knowledge, was cleared of
sngar pine thirty-five years ago, and
the trees which have come up are mis
erable little things, not more than six
Inches in diameter, and utterly value
less."
Another proof of this is the fact that
no young sugar pines are to be seen
in our forests. The trees which are
now being cut down are mostly from
two to three hundred years old, and
average from four to five feet in diam
eter. Many trees still standing, how
ever, are much older and larger. Eight
feet Is not an uncommon diameter,
while twelve has been seen, though but
rarely. These magnificent trees must
be at least five hundred years old, and
yet, for the sake of a little commercial
profit, we destroy In a few hours na
ture's handiwork of an age. Tree fell-
Ing is no longer the labor it used to
be. Two men with a saw cut rapidly
through, the soft wood, and the tree
falls in a few minutes. No matter
how large the wood giant there is no
need to prepare a bed for it. The pine
is sufficiently elastic to stand the shock.
With redwood it is different, and un
less great care is taken the tree will
break in pieces when it strikes the
ground.
There Is an enormous quantity of
I waste about the operation. Only tho
lower portion of the trunk, below the
branches, is of any value; the rest is
left to dry on the ground, ready to
serve as fuel for the next forest fire
that starts. The trunk, according to
its length, is sawn into three or four
logs of from eighteen to twenty feet
In length. Then the steam engine
comes into play and go where you will
in these woods you cannot get far away
from machinery. -A large donkey en
gine, or, as they call it up here, a
bull donkey, is within reach, perhaps
one or two thousand feet away, and a
long wire cable hauls the log over all
obstacles to the roadway. Here it is
placed on the chutes, a kind of raised
wooden slide, down which the traction
engine drags it to the mill.
The yellow pine, next in importance
to the sugar pine, has not the same
antiquity. It is a very slow grower and
is supposed to attain an age of 250
years. There is always, it should be
observed, a good deal of doubt about
the real age of a tree, because experts
differ. Some assert that you can tell
the age by counting the rings, or dif
ferent layers of wood In the trunk, each
of which is presumed to represent a.
year's growth. It is easy to do this
after the tree Is cut down, but while
it is still standing the age is only a
matter of guess. Other experts deny
the value of the ring test altogether
and advocate some other method, the
working of which is quite incompre
hensible to the outsider.
Evidently the era of yellow pine in
this State has not yet passed. The tree
comes up readily enough and if the
young plantations were properly looked
after a permanent supply of this tim
ber could be secured. The same with
the fir and spruce and cedar trees.
Oaks, which nobody wants very much
and least of all the big lumberman,
will come up anywhere. It is a singu
lar fact that if you clear a piece of
land on which only pine has been grow
ing the chances are that oaks will
spring up. I have seen a similar thing
happen in the Pacific islands, where,
when you strip the bush of Its natural
foliage, breadfruit trees are certain to
appear. Where do these growths come
from? Scientists are at a loss for an
answer. Probably the germs have lain
dormant in the ground for centuries,
waiting for a chance to make their
vitality known.
The operations of the Scott & Van
Arsdale corporations, which Is only one
of the big milling concerns which form
the lumber combine about which so
much has been heard lately, are sim
ply enormous. The head of the whole
concern is -the firm of Scott & Van Ars
dale, which has its office in the Crocker
building. It owns body and soul (I
quote from the firm's own business
card) the following corporations: The
Siskiyou Lumber and Mercantile Com
pany of Slsson. the Scott & Van Arns
dale Lumber Company of Fifth and
Brannan streets, San Francisco; the
Scott & Van Arsdale Box Factory of
Upton, the Folsom Box Factory of Fol
som. As if these were not enough en
terprises to handle, the firm is agent
for the McCloud River Railroad Com
pany, the McCloud River Lumber Com
pany and the A. Weed Lumber Com
pany. It is a tremendous aggregation
of lumber interests, but the work
mainly centers on the McCloud prop
erty, reached by the company's private
railway. This line in itself is a splen
did piece of engineering work. It
starts from Upton, right under Mount
Shasta, and winding round the foothills
at the base of the giant crag switches
itself up and down the steep hillsides,
going now forward and now backward,
until the comparatively level country
of the logging camp is reached, a dis
tance of eighteen miles. Every day
sees a long line of laden ears leave the
place for San Francisco; every day
hundreds of noble trees are felled In the
forest.
The company owns or controls some
300,000 acres of the finest timber land
in the State, and, with the exception
of a few months in winter, the work will
g-o on continuously year in and year
out, until the whole land within a ra
dius of ten miles has been stripped.
A number of smaller mills in the neigh
borhood hang like parasites on the
flanks of the great corporation. All
their lumber comes to McCloud. where
It is handled by the company, dried and
shipped to this city. Altogether the
average dally production of lumber by
the company and its tributaries is from
250,000 to 300,000 feet. Besides this an
enormous quantity of firewood is split
for the use of the Southern Pacific
Railway Company. The work forms an
entirely separate branch of the trade,
for it is mainly carried out under con
tract by foreignersâ Portuguese or Ital
ians.
The box factory at Upton is another
enormous consumer of lumber. With
the aid of modern machinery it turns
out some twelve thousand boxes a day
and uses up about 15,000,000 feet of lum
ber yearly. This box industry is a fac
tor in the timber question which we
cannot afford to overlook. Many peo
ple are under the impression that the
demand for lumber Is likely to decrease
rather than Increase in the future.
They argue that In many ways iron
and steel is taking the place of wood.
We use steel frames for our great
buildings, our ships are all of the same
material, in nearly every Industry the
cheapened production of iron has led
to its substitution for wood. It is only
the fruit grower who is yearly making
heavier and heavier demands upon our
forests.
One industry invariably reacts upon
another. If the orchards of the State
had not prospered so marvelously many
of our finest forest trees might still b"*
standing. A yearly supply of about
eighty million boxes is demanded by
the fruit trade, and from Upton box<'3
go to all parts of the coast, even so tax
south as Mexico. No material has yet
been discovered which will serv? as a
subbtltute for wood in the packing of
fruit, and until something is found thi-
drain upon our forests is certain to
continue.
Then there is the export trade. Large
quantities of our best wood, especialh
sugar pine, yellow pine and redwood,
are shipped to Australia, there to be'
used for building and decorative pur
poses. Australia has little soft wood
of her own, therefore the demand is
likely to Increase. The Australian ex
port trade in fruit and butter is a Jaige
and growing one and all the wood
needed for boxing these goods must if
necessity come from this country.
Honolulu, Samoa and the other Pacific
islands are also large customers. Mtxi
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 23, 1898.
c Â« and Central America require boards
and boxes. There is nothing to check the
drain upon our forests, unless the .Stat*;
Btei-S in and insists that the business
<;f lumber getting shall be conducted in
n 'ai'onal way, with due regard for the
requirements of the future.
A well-known authority has estimat
ed that, when California was conquered
by the United States, some 50,000
square miles, or about one-third of the
total area of the State, were covered
by forests. To-day we have only some
15,000.000 acres of first-class forest land
left. The redwoods of the coast ranges,
which cover but a limited area of some
1,400,000 acres, are fast disappearing;
at least 20 per cent of them has already
been cut and the quantity which re
mains will not last for more than thirty
or forty years. Further inland we find
the coniferous belt, the great pine for
ests of the Sierra Nevada. Around
Shasta, where the McCloud lumber
mills are, this forest can be studied
to the greatest advantage, for there the
trees grow to the largest size and are,
withal, easily accessible to the tourist.
Botanists, always fond of nice classifi
cations, divide this great forest into
three belts, according to altitude. On
the lowest belt, where the foothills are,
we find oaks and the Pinus sabrina,
reaching up to an altitude of 2000, feet.
Betwen this height and 4000 feet comes
the middle forest, where the noble
sugar pine makes its appearance, ac
companied by black p:ne, cedar, red
and yellow fir. But it is between 4000
and 9000 fet that the conifers reach
their highest luxuriance. Here the yel
low and sugar pine, the giant firs and
spruces, grow to their greatest perfec
tion, and it is here that the destructive
lumber industry is most profitably car
ried on.
It is easy to write about the evil, but
it will be more to the point to suggest
a remedy. This is not difficult, and
any forester of average intelligence
could tell you exactly what to do. It
has been done in so many other parts of
the world, in India, in Australia, in
France and Germany and Russia.
Wherever there are forests the nation
which has any regard for posterity
takes means for their preservation.
In this country much of the work un
doubtedly comes within the scope of
the Federal Government. Uncle Sam
sells the timber lands and makes his
profit thereon, so that he should un
doubtedly maintain an efficient forestry
commission to attend to the reforest
ing of the lands. We ought, In short,
to look upon our timber as a crop, just
as we regard wheat or corn. Up to the
2000 feet level the land '<* more valuable
for farms and orchards than for tim
ber growing. But above this level we
should have great timber ranches, pro
ducing annually a crop which would
never fail. Every acre of land in the
State might thus'be profitably utilized.
Where fruit would not grow timber
would furnish an even richer product.
There is another and even more im
portant side to the problem which must
not be overlooked. The very perma
nence of our climate, the very exist
ence of our vineyards and orchards, our
gardens and farms, depends upon the
preservation of our forests. Already, |
it is said, the climate of California is ]
changing. It is becoming markedly |
hotter and drier. The present season,
exceptional as it may be, seems to lend
weight to the assumption. If every
year were like the present one, Cali
fornia would be doomed as an agricul
tural State. Yf-t. by stripping the for
ests from our hills, we are doing our
best to turn the land into an arid des
ert. Every one knows the effect of
trees upon the rainfall. The high
spreading branches of our pines arrest !
the passing clouds and precipitate
moisture upon the land. Then, It must
be remembered, the Sacramento and ;
most of our principal rivers are fed by I
the melting snow of the mountains, j
During the winter the snowfall lodges
under the pines, and when spring ar
rives it is gradually and gently melted,
insuring an even flow of water
throughout the summer. Remove the
sheltering tree branches, and with the
first heat of summer the snow will melt j
In a body, tearing Its way down the
hillsides to the flooded streams below.
There will be a big rush of water for
a few days, and then a drought. Also
the bare ground, without tree roots to
hold It together, will wash away read
ily, rivulets once limpid will be filled
with silt, much water will be lost by
percolation through the loosened soil
and the residents in the valley will find j
that the streams, which once never j
failed, are diminishing in volume year
by year.
These things are matters of every
day knowledge, yet nothing is at- j
tempted to avert the calamity. Even j
if the Federal Government does not do
its duty toward the forests it has sold,
there is much that the State, by the
establishment of an efficient Forestry
Commission, might accomplish. When
the Federal Government sells a sec
tion of land, the purchaser has the
right. If he chooses, to denude it of
every stick of timber. The State has j
no Jurisdiction, but it could easily take
measures to insure the replanting of
the land thus stripped. Nurseries for
young forest trees should be estab
lished, and the seedlings distributed
wherever needed. There Is plenty of
land available for the purpose, as the
State owns the sixteenth and thirty
second sections of each township, the
section being 640 acres.
Careful experiments should be made
to ascertain the best kinds of trees for
planting. As I have already pointed
out. It Is hardly likely that we will be
able to replace our destroyed sugar
pine forests, but we might do much
with various foreign kinds of trees. The
English oak is said to grow more rapid
ly here than the native variety, besides
producing more valuable lumber. The
eucalyptus, we know, is a very rapid
grower, and the timber from some of
the finer varieties, such as Ironbark
and blue gum, has achieved a world
wide celebrity. To-day the streets of
London are being paved with ironbark
blocks, a material having all the ad
vantages of a wooden pavement, com
bined with the endurance of granite.
The streets of Sydney and MUbourne.
entirely paved with this material, stand
forth as an example which the world Is
rapidly learning to Imitate. There is
also the Jarrah wood of Western Aus
tralia, absolutely teredo proof and un
equaled for piles and railway ties.
Enormous quantities of this wood are
sent yearly to India, as it is the only
timber for railway purposes which will
resist the ravages of the white ant. The
black walnut, the European sycamore,
the box elder, the cork oak and various
varieties of ash. might also be included
in the list of trees desirable for plant-
ing.
Side by side with this movement for
reproduction, the State might also do
much to check the damage to existing
forests caused by fire. There is, I be
lieve, a law in existence which makes
it a penal offense to start a forest fire.
But the law is a dead letter, because
there is no properly organized forest
patrol. The lumber getters would be
only too glad to assist the State in this
work, for they live in daily dread of a
huge brush fire, which may sweep the
whole of their property away. The
large lumber corporations, such ac the
McCloud River Company, maintain a
private patrol of their own. and as soon
aÂ« a fire is discovered a well organized
force is called out to check its spread
by backfiring. But this is not suffi
cient. The corporations, naturally
enough, only look after the land which
they actually own. The remainder of
the vacant timber lands of the State is
at the mercy of any careless camper
who may choose to leave his embers
alight. The prosecution of a few of
these offenders would do much to check
the ravages of bush fires, and it only
needs a little attention on the part of
the State Legislature to bring about
the desired result.

Commission.

Admiral Details Incidents of the Big
Naval Battle â The President
Listens With Deep
Interest.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 22.â Admiral
Sampson called on President McKinley
to-day and spent thirty-five minutes
with him in discussion of the Cuban
Commission's plans and other matters.
He reached here on the train from New
York at 3:38 o'clock this afternoon and
drove immediately to the Navy Depart
ment. There he spent some minutes
exchanging courtesies with the naval
officials, when Acting Secretary of the
Navy Allen drove with him to the
White House, the two joining the Pres
ident at a quarter past 4.
The President shook the admiral's
hand very cordially and inquired about
his experience In commanding the fleet
in the Cuban waters. Admiral Samp
son referred briefly to a number of
the important Incidents in the war.
The details of the great battle of July
3 were gone over quite thoroughly. The
President at the outset took occasion
to express his thanks to the admiral
for the success of the battle and
showed deep interest in the story of
the engagement as told by him. The
talk also bore on the reasons for not
entering the harbor at Santiago and
the placing of the mines and torpedoes
In Cuban ports.
The plans of the commission to ar
range for the evacuation of Cuba were
talked over and the' President was
asked as to whether formal instructions
would be given the commission. The
President told the admiral that written
Instructions would be given the com
mission in a few days. The talk along
this line was of a general nature and
laid down no strict line of policy.
During the call Secretary Alger came
over from the War Department to con
sult the President regarding the dispo
sition of troops, and finding Admiral
Sampson there greeted him and joined
In the discussion. Both Rear Admirals
Sampson and Schley had been invited
here by the President to confer on the
plans of the commission, but Admiral
Schley did not arrive until this after
noon. Admiral Sampson looked some
what fatigued. He did not wear his
uniform, being attired In an ordinary
sack suit of light mixed cloth.
After leaving the President he
stopped Just long enough to gratify
several autograph enthusiasts and then
drove off to his hotel, where Acting
Secretary Allen left him. The latter
announced positively that the admiral
would retain his command on the
North Atlantic squadron while one of
the Cuban Commissioners. No time
has been fixed for the commission's de
departure. Pending the receipt of the
President's written instructions, Ad
miral Sampson will go to his home in
New Jersey to spend a few days.
PREPARATIONS FOR WAR

Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1898. by James Gor
don Bennett.
CADIZ, Aug. â Construction of
railroads from Torregorda and San.
Fernando to the arsenal has been de
cided upon. The Rumancia is taking
on board heavy artilleryâ four big guns
and several smaller ones. The Vitorla
is also taking on board more guns. The
ironclad Alfonso XIII has again been
put through a farce of trials, but is
hardly able to keep at sea. One of her
twelve centimeter guns burst, but no
one was killed. Admiral Camara's
squadron is going to Ferrol to clean up
and save the Carlos .V. whose ma
chinery is disabled. It is reported that
an English company is willing to take
over a plant to the Ferrol arsenal and
construct battle-ships there. .
ITALIAN FACTIONS IN
SANGUINARY CONFLICT
Rocks, Clubs, Chains and Axes Used
in a Desperate Affray at
Mill Valley.
SAN RAFAEL, Aug. 22.â One of the
bloodiest brawls that ever disgraced a
community occurred in Mill Valley last
evening between rival members of two
Italian Becret societies. Rocks, clubs,
heavy chains and axes were the weapons
used and the fray was so fierce that the
ground near the scene was dyed crimson
with the gore of the contestants. Carlos
Luraghi and his wife Rose, together with
Carlos and Antone Gurattl. two brothers
in-law, formed one faction. The three
male members are said to belong to the
Mafla, Their opponents were Augustus,
Carlos and John Fararri, who have the
reputation of belonging to another Italian
secret society.
The feud is of long standing, and when
the men met near the depot in Mill Valley
last evening a quarrel began. Luraghi
took offense at a remark and struck John
Fararri over the head with a loaded cane,
splitting his scalp and knocking him
down. Carlos Guratti followed up the on
slaught "by wielding a heavy log chain,
and was met by a fusillade of cobbles and
blows from clubs in the hands of the
Fararri brothers.
The melee became general and the fac
tions fell upon each other and fought like
wild beasts. Luraghi was felled to his
knees by a blow from a club, when his
wife uttered a scream of rage and rush
ing up with an ax inflicted a doep cut
on Augustus Fararri's skull. The blow
was glancing, otherwise it might have
proved fatal. At this Juncture a num
ber of officers arrived and placed the prin
cipals under arrest, thus ending hostili
ties for the time. All the contestants were
covered with blood.
To-day the principals were brought to
San Rafael and arraigned before Judge
Rodden on various charges of assault and
disturbing the peace. They were convict
ed and fined in sums ranging from $5 to
$20. All departed homeward vowing ven
geance, on one another at the ilrst op
portunity.
NEVADA TROOPS IN REVOLT.
Protest Against Doing- Garrison Duty
in Arizona.
CARSON. Nov., Aug. 22.â War is brew
ing at Camp Clark. There Is dissatisfac
tion among the .soldiers arising out of the
fact that a telegram sent from Carson by
Senator V\ iliiam M. St;-wart to Secretary
Alger asking the retention of the Nevada
battalion and that they be not mustered
out or" service brought back the reply that
the request would be granted and that
the soldiers would be sent to do "irrison
duty in Arizona.- This raised the trouble,
and a few who declared they had enlisted
to fight, not to become human watch
dogs, circulated a petition this afternoon
to be sent to the Secretary of War pray
ing that they be mustered out if they
could not be sent to Manila or Honolulu.
Nearly every man from two companies
signed the petition, but the officers got
wind of the scheme, and, demanding pos
session of the document, destroyed it
and reprimanded the participants for
meddling with affairs that did not concern
them. They were threatened with con
finement in the guard house if such a
thing was attempted again. This put the
battalion in a high rage and they shower
ed condemnation upon their officers'
heads. It is difficult to predict what the
result will be.

â The .throe soldiers that escaped from Ai
catraz have been heard from in an indi
rect manner. Sweeny, whose love for a â 
JSFoxth Beach girl, pot him three years on
the. island for desertion, has paid his lady I
â¢love- a visit, but to the army officers she .
professes the greatest ignorance as to his
whereabouts. The boat In which the men
ma.de their escape has been picked up on
the/ beach at Goat Island. There- was
ablaut a pint of blood in the bottom of
her; and the sides were smeared with I
blood. This bears out the statement of j
the sentry, who says he hit one of the es
capes and heard him groaning in the bot
tom of the boat. The supposition is tnat
: th" â  runaway soldiers landed at North
â Beach and then cut the boat adrift. Had i
they landed on Goat Island, there would I
have been no means of escape, as none of â 
the boats used at the stations on the isl
and are missing.
'. It appears that there was to have been
ft general Jail-break on the island last
w,eek.- Seventeen prisoners were all ready
.to; juke "French leave," but the disabling
of'the gasoline launch threw ail the plans .
out of sear. Sweeny and his companions
were afraid to. wait until another oppor
tunity arose and determined to trust
.'themselves to the small boat. Extra
.guards now patrol Aleatraz night and day
and it will be a clever prisoner who es
capes for some time to come.

'. There is a lively little rate war on be

â¢rate by steamer used to be 50 cents to
Alviso and 75 cents to San Jose, but it ;
Is-p-afe to say that those figures will be i
cut- one-half before the week is out. Be- 'â¢
;fc>ro.the Klondike boom struck San Fran- :
â  Cisco, the stern wheel steamer Alviso had '
the trade all to herself. She was taken i
off-, however, and fixed up for the Yu- :
kon trade. When the bottom fell out ! :
'.of .the boom the Alviso was put back on : (
â¢"her old run. The reasons that kept the .
â¢Alviso in San Francisco Bay also pre- \ \
"vented the river steamers Alice Rix and \

-of th^ Rix has been changed to San j I
â Jose.- amj; ihat of -the Grady to' J. M. s ,

BIGGY SHORN
OF AUTHORITY
Election Board Appoints
His New Men.
HE CANNOT DISCHARGE THEM
WILL THEY BE EMPLOYED TO
PURGE THE ROLL?
The Registrar Reserves the Right to
Employ the Appointees as
He May Sea
Tit.
The fight between Registrar Biggy and
the Board of Election Commissioners
took on a very breezy aspect yesterday.
The Commissioners held a protracted ses
sion, lasting until nearly 1 o'clock, with
a recess until 3 for recuperative pur
poses, with Biggy still "given preference
over all other business." The afternoon
not proving long enough to end the mat
ter, the Commissioners decided to carry
over the proceedings until to-day, taking
Mr. Biggy up at 1U:3O a. m.
j. he attack was led by City and County
Attorney Creswell, ably seconded by Au
ditor Broderick. Mayor Phelan and Tax
Collector Block stood behind Biggy, some
times rendering assistance, while Sur
veyor Tilton took the position of "an at
tentive listener," not mixing in the wordy
war, but ultimately casting a vote to
distribute Biggy's office patronage among
the members of the board, which Biggy
did not want done. The Commissioners,
in fact, decided that it was wise to ap
point fifteen new clerks for Biggy, each
to receive ?11'5 a month, and to grant the
Registrar the undeslred privilege of dis
charging fifteen of his own men who were
familiar with the duties of the registra
tion. The formal vote to compel Biggy
to cut off these fifteen official heads was
not passed before adjournment for the
afternoon, out of courtesy to Mr. Block,
who was absent at this session, but un
mistakable notice was given Biggy that
it would be done to-day. No claim was
made by Creswell or Broderick that the
fifteen experienced men were to be dis
charged "for cause," the statement being
simply vouchsafed that the board wanted
part of the patronage of the Registrar's
office, and would take it under the law.
Apparently it made no difference to the
majority of the board that the fifteen
new men whom the board chose to ap
point were totally ignoraast of the data
connected with the present registration.
They Were to take hold under a
Registrar who had no power to discharge
them for crooked or inefficient work, and
to do the purging of the registration lists.
Biggy's "kick " that he objected to "run
ning" an office over whose employes he
had ne control was received with a quiet
smile.
Attorney Creswell stated that he
j thought it would be well for the board
' to divide up the patronage Â«o that each
j member w r ould have three men to name
for positions in Biggy's office. He in
formed the board that if any one of the
five did not care to name three appoint
ees he would be glad to till that mem
ber's share of the quota.
One point which the antagonists of
i Biggy made against him was that he
i had failed to secure the return of the
i two registers from the fourteenth pre
i clnct of the Thirty-sixth District, and the
sixth precinct of the Forty-third Dis
trict. Inspectors James H. Riley and P.
Garrissere were said to be the delin
quents.
During- the noon recess the two missing
| precinct books were turned in and that
i incident was closed.
At 3 o'clock the board reassembled, and,,
i being now of one mind, as long as pat
i ronage was to be distributed every mem
! ber had his list of three men ready to fill
i the proposed vacancies In Biggy's office.
I The names were read in turn by each
i Commissioner, while a large crowd of in
| terested applicants stood at the railing
! eagerly watching to see what was done.
I Attorney Creswell named Martin T.
j Cleary, Parker W. Jones, Charles M.
Hackmeier. Surveyor Tilton wanted Wil
liam W. Bausman, Joseph Windrow and
John McCarthy appointed. Tax Collector
Block presented the names of Charles C.
Purdy, John D. O'Hern and L. H. Hos
minsky. Auditor Broderick chnse John
' Bore, John Donahue and Thomas R.
; Hart. The Mayor said he would have
i three men also. The board then voted that
a list of three men as named by each
Commissioner be considered appointed
and that the new men should draw sal
ary from the following day.
The board then adjourned until fhis
morning in order to give the members,
as Sir. Creswell expressed it. time to con
sider anything else In connection with
the Registrar's office that needed atten
tion.
Later Mr. Biggy was interviewed. He
said that the resolution of the Commis
sioners did not specify that the new fif
teen were to be put to work purging the
registration lists. In fact, the board
could not say what specific duties these
men should have. It remained for him
after all to send men out to purge the
register. He further stated that he had
(onsulted an attorney and was waiting
for his advice before making any definite
mnvp.
There Is naturally considerable anxiety
among the employes of the Registrar to
learn who the unfortunate fifteen will be
in rase Biggy is obliged to discharge that
number. ______________
MAIL GONE ASTRAY.
Change of Orders for the Arizona
Makes Trouble in the Postoffice.
The orders which changed the destina
tion of the transport Arizona from Ma
nila to Honolulu at the last moment will
cause a great deal of trouble in the Post
office Department.
The Arizona had on board 35.000 letters
and three tons of papers for soldiers now
in the Philippine Islands. These will, of
course", be taken to Honolulu, and it is
probable they Will stay then? until the
next steamer bound for Hongkong picks
them up. A number of the soldiers aboard
the Arizona were recruits for regiments
now stationed in the Philippines, and all
their mall will naturally bo addressed to
Manila in care of the regiments which
they expected to join. An effort will bo
made to get regimental lists for use in the
poÃtofQce and sort all mail thoroughly,
but even if these can be procured it will
be a slow and tedious process, and the
chances are that many a soldier boy in
Honolulu will be anxiously looking for his
sweetheart's letter which is patiently
awaiting his arrival at Manila.
WANTS ITS TURNTABLE.
Geary-Street Company Objects to
Tearing Up Its Property.
The Geary-street, Park and Ocean Rail
road Company has determined to fight a
resolution passed by the Board of Super
visors on the 15th inst.. declaring the
turntable at Geary and Market streets a
nuisance and directing its removal. Yes

prohibit the carrying out of the resolu
tion. The petitioner alleges that In case
it was forced to remove the turntable It
would be irreparably damaged.

FROWN IS
FRIENDS AGAIN
Will Give San Francisco
Another Chance.
EXTENDS THE OLIVE BRANCH
HENRY MILLER TO HEAL THE
PAINFUL BREACH.
To Bask Again in the. Little Napo
leon's Smile, and Big Attrac
tions Will Follow in Rapid
Succession.
Charlie Frohman wants to be friends
again. He wants to come once more and
play in our yardâ otherwise San Francisco
theatersâ and looks for a game of forgive
and forget all round.
Some little time ago the Napoleon of
managers got "mad." He shook his fist,
snapped his well manicured thumb nail
against the edge of his pearly teeth,
spluttered, rushed, into print and in every
way gave the Far West to understand
that he was "mad forever."
Time, however, has brought counsel to
this most astute of managers, and if ever
a man was sorry for deeds done Froh
man Is that man. With a courage
worthy a great theatrical deal, he ac
knowledges his fault, not in so many
words, but in actions that go a great deal
farther, and extends the olive branch In
the person of Henry Miller, who opened
at the Baldwin Theater last evening.
Miller, metaphorically speaking, is Froh
man's apology- He is the first on the list
of the Frohman attractions that will be
offered to the local playgoers. He has
paved the manager's way along the West
ern circuit which he played on his way
out here, covering himself with glory;
both as an artist and as a peace commis
sioner. â¢ - -
Mr. Miller doesn't believe half the hard
things it has been., said that Frehman
said about Ban v , Francisco.. The. actor,
however,' admits that perhaps the mana
ger may have said he would send no more
attractions to the coast, but In .thinking
the matter over reason came to the res
cue of hasty, ill-advised decisions, and
that by offering the best he now has
atonement complete Is made. â¢
"Mr Frohman has decided to send all
of his best attractions out here," said
Mr. Miller, "and all the great New York
successes will be seen in San .Francisco
with the original New York cast. Mr.
Frohman is more than anxious for San
Francisco's approval and on my arrival
here this morning I received a -telegram
from him In which he advised me to send
him immediate notice of my reception
here."
Mr. Frohman, in his desire to please
all sorts and conditions of playgoers, has
sent a popular star with a varied reper
toire that will appeal to the tastes of all
lovers of the drama. "Heartsease". Is for
the especial delectation of the romantic,
"A Marriage of Convenience" for the ad
mirers of airy persiflage and telling wit,
and "The Master" for the lovers of the
strong, the sterling and the true.
Gillette, Maud Adams and John Drew
are a few of the big attractions that are
to follow In rapid succession, and if
Frohman keeps his word the coming
theatrical season Is likely to prove a love
feast all round. â : â â¢ â¢â - .-- â  :.- ..-:â :â . ."-. :

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Aug. 22.â stock market re- i
fumed its familiar character of the greater j
part of last week to-day, with the exception
that the early strength of stocks was not fully
recovered at any time subsequently. In fact,
the closing was rather easy In tone, prices be- j
Ing sustained with apparent difficulty at a
point decidedly below the best but somewhat i
above the lowest. In the grangers the opening :
prices were the best at a level of about 1 to 1%
above the buoyant top prices of Friday after- â 
noon. This level was helped by the marking
up of Americans in London before the open- I
Ing here on cabled orders from New York. It
was the evident purpose to make the opening
high for liquidation of profits. The commis
sion houses were known to have a large volume
of orders to buy. and In many cases there was
no price restriction on these, the order being
to buy at the market. The realizing sales in i
the first hour were very heavy, and in spite of
large outside demand prices of the grangers
melted away before the pront-taking saies. Be- ;
fore St. Paul had entirely lost its advance
there was a letting up of the pressure to sell j
and prices turned upward again. The tone of
the group was somewhat heavy for the rest of j
the day, though St. Paul rallied above 113 be- i
fore the close. The Pacifies also showed evi
dence of profit-taking, but the Northern Pa- j
cifies rallied on the showing of an increase of j
earnings, second week in August, of $16,544. !
There was heavy buying of Atchison preferred
during the day, and Louisville and Nashville
advanced over a .point near the close on re- !
ports of a project for a steamship line to Ha- i
vana. There were numerous extraordinary
price movements in special stocks, Minnesota j
Iron covering a range of 11 points and Illinois â 
Steel about 5 points in efforts to/adjust pro
portion of valuation on the consolidation. In
ternational paper stock was u{T"ll points anil
Consolidated Gas had a break of about 10 '
points. Cotton oil advanced 4% and the pre- !
ferred 5%. The railroad list generally held very ,
firm in spite of the unsettling influences of ;
weak specialties and profit-taking In the
grangers, many stocks showing gains ranging
up to a point or over. The bond market was
active to-day and showed higher prices, the
Atchison issues being conspicuous. ~ Total sale*,

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Aug. 22â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
market here opened unchanged after Saturday's
holiday, the feature being a resumption of the
boom in Americans initiated by New York. The
support of Americans here is still small and
mainly professional, but the Continent buyers
and Berlin continue to support Northern la
cine common. It is generally urged that the
boom in Americans is being started at the
wrnng moment; that is to say, the public is
apathetic and away on summer holidays, and
that on their return they will find prices too
high for them. The reverse, however, is quite
as likely, as the English public Invariably
join in a speculation at the last moment and
when prices are top-heavy. After a temporary
relapse prices for Americans closed booming
In the street, St. Paul leading. The other mar
kets were featureless. Debeers mines were
flat.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
; CHICAGO. Aug. 22.â The Liverpool market
was 14d lower before the opening here than
; it closed last week. That added to the bpar
ishness previously prevailing, ami when Just
before the session opened it became known
that the day's receipts at Minneapolis and Du
luth were 939 cars, compared with 315 the cor
1 responding day of last year, the desire to sell
I wheat at the start received a fresh stimulus.
: It was under such circumstances that Septem- |
ber wheat opened with â  sellers at from 62 7 I
j down to 62% c, compared with 63% cat the close j
i Saturday. At the decline there was not a short j
1 In the trade but bad a good profit, and it
was a most natural proceeding for a large num
! ber of them to at once take action to secure
i it. From that source came buying enough to
I cause a recovery In September to 63% c about
: half an hour from the start. The price of Sep
i tember kept on the rise during the forenoon
\ until it struck 634 c for an instant. December
kept following September at from l%c to l%c
discount. As soon as the most urgent shorts had
1 covered and withdrawn, however, the market I
\ again got dull and weak. Atlantic port clear- j
i ances of â  wheat and flour since Saturday were \
1 smaller than the recent average. The total
was 600,000 bushels. September closed %@4c
1 lower and December lost %c.
Brilliant weather, large receipts and free
i sales of cash by the country, demoralized corn.
I Nearly every one In the pit had large quanti
: ties for sale, and as a result of the extensive I
: offerings the trade was thrown into a general ;
I confusion. September declined %c.
! Oats were firm considering the weakness in j
the other grains. There was a good commis- !
sion trade with the demand generally exceeding
the offerings. The close was 'unchanged from j
yesterday. Provisions were comparatively firm 1
: early, but finally : yielded with grain. There j
was quite a pressure on lard and ribs through 1
prominent commission houses. Pork left off un- j
changed, lard 10c lower and ribs down 10c.

NEW YORK, Aug. 22.â The Journal of Com
merce says: The season In California for or
anges has continued much longer this season
than usual. Fifteen carloads were sold last
I week, and It is predicted that there will be

I that In any event there will be receipts as
latP as October. Up to last accounts 14,650

from 14,000 to 17,000 carloads, or from 5,000,000
to 5,500,000 boxes, which would be about the
same as the last record year of Florida, when
oranges from that State were In the "-'l. As
to Florida oranges a crop of about 300.000 boxes

NAVAL NOMENCLATURE.
An expert has called attention to the
popular mistakes in naval nomenclature.
As our navy is now the object of world
wide admiration and the subject of dis
cussion in all manner of company, it is
well to be set right on certain technical
terms descriptive of its militant opera
tions.
When we speak of a fleet the experts
understand us to mean a company of
twelve or more battle-ships. A mosquito
fleet is composed of twelve or more
small boats. A squadron is composed of
less than twelve battle-ships, and is often
part of a fleet, such as the van, center or
rear squadron. A flotilla is composed of
twelve or more men-of-war, some of
which may be battle-ships.
According to these definitions the Unit
ed States have no fleet; neither has
Spain. Admiral Dewey commands a
squadron. The ships destroyed and cap
tured from Montejo in Manila Bay com
posed a squadron. Admiral Sampson
commands a flotilla. Admiral Cervera
commanded and Admiral Camara com
mands a squadron.
Not until we expend a great deal more
money for battle-ships than is now being
put into that character of craft can we
properly claim to have a fleet under the
most formidable concentration we could
make of our navy. In a few years, how
ever, we will have enough battle-ships of
the first class to compose a fleet.â St.
Louis Republic.

WATER WAR
BREAKS OUT
Health Board and the
Council Are Moving.
NEW RATES NOT IN USE
PATRONAGE TAKEN FROM THE
FORMER FAVORITE.
Padlocks Placed on Hydrants So That
the Fluid Cannot Be Used
}. Unless It Is Paid

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
: 908 Broadway, Aug. 22.
."'. The permanent war between the two
.water companies, which has twice
lifeen relieved by a truce, is now as bitter
as ever, .and it is predicted that before
.long. the rate cutting which was indulged
: in prior to March of this year will again
â .be resorted to.
A year ago it was freely stated that the
present Board of Health was appointed
â¢'â¢ largely in the Interests of the new or
Oakland Water Company. There was
much to justify this statement and Mayor
Thomas' name was very freely used in
this connection. It was also evident that
a. majority of the City Council favored the
: Oakland Water Company as against the
Contra Costa Water Company. All pub
â¢.lic patronage that could be diverted from
the Contra Costa Company was taken
â  'from It, and whenever the pressure or
' quality of the new company's water was
â  not always up to the mark there was al
ways some one on the floor of the Council
to apologize for it.
.' The Board of Health after examining
"the supplies of the Contra Costa ' 'ompany
promulgated a very rabid document which
wa-s circulated by thousands and for
which the city government did nut pay.
Now without any apparent reason all
this has changed. A few weeks ago the
City Council by a majority vote seemed
pleased when the opportunity presented
itself to take the patronage of ;he City
Hall away from the Dlng9C Company and
f;iv,- it back to the old company. A little
ater it transpired that some members of
â¢the B;<ur.l of Health were privately ex
amining some of the sources of supply of
the new company, and some disparaging
remarks concerning it appeared in print.
Still later it has been noticed that around
the hydrants iron bands are being placed
secured by padlocks, and the only reason
for this can be to prevent one company
which is paid for street sprinkling or for
water for fire purposes, from stealing the
water of its rival and to prevent any
â other mistake that the drivers of sprink
ling wagons might make.
Tne.se incidents plainly show that what
ever truce may have existed is apparently
at an end, and now that bitterness is
again in evidence there may be some reve
lations. The grand jury that tried to dis
r several months ago why Major
'. Vf oodward and others were so unequivo
cally in favor of high-water rates did not
â i.nM anything of value, it being aciinow- I
. lt-dged that all those Involved in fixing â 
water rates were not anxious to tell on
each other. Now that the situation has
suddenly become so strained, any sensa
tion is likely to result.
The new water schedule which those
who favored it said was the result of
â¢years of study has proved that its alleged
author* were a long way off in their cal
culations. The water companies have dis
covered that ft was not necessary to en
totw it in July 1. and they are quite
â  satisfied with the revenue obtained under
the old rate. This is a situation which
:1. who published four
columns of defense of the ordinance, could
explain.

THE STREITBERGER
WILL CONTEST IS ON
TWO SETS OF EXECUTORS, BUT
IDENTICAL HEIRS.
Citation Issued for the Production of
a Will Which One Side Alleges
Has Been Destroyed.
OAKLAND, Aug. 22.â At the instance of
W. H. Knight, special administrator of :
the. estate of Christopher Streitberger,
Judge Ellsworth this afternoon issued a
Citation ordering D. Bruns and Thomas F.
Graber to show cause why they should
not produce the will alleged to have been
made by Btreitberger in April, 1894.
Streitberger left a $200,000 estate and ;
made two win*â one dated April 3, 1R94, i
with John fVhneider and George Metzger
named as executors; the other, dated Ap
ril 13, ISSS, in which Bruns and Graber are
executors. The last will was field for pro
bate and Messrs. Schneider and Metzger
filed a contest, alleging the '94 will to be
the last legally and charging that the '98 j
will was made under duress, fraud and un
due influence. The heirs in either will arc j
identically the same.
T)i- matter came up in Judge Ells
worth's court to-day, when attorneys ;
Colvin and Graber moved to strike out the
contest. Thin was dÂ«-nied and they then
fllea a general denial in which it is i
averred th;it the will of '94 was torn up ;
and destroyed by testator four months
prior to his death
:.. . Father McEvoy's Will.
. OAKLAND. Aug. 22.â The will of the
late Father McEvoy leaves all the prop
. erty of the decedent to Archbishop Rior
dan as an individual and not as a corpo
ration. No provision is made for relatives
of :the deceased, as they are all com- j
paratiyely wealthy. The priest acquired I
much property in his lifetime, but it was j
..all. turned over to the church, and he had
hot- much estate at the time of death.
Diphtheria at Golden Gate.

She Deceived the Court.
OAKLAND, Aug. XLâ Judge Ellsworth
refused to grant the application of the
attorneys in the estate of Elijah Price
for J2OO counsel fees this morning. His j
Honor scored the widow, Mrs. Louisa
Price, declaring that she had imposed
upon her counsel and deceived the court,
and that she should pay her own counsel
fees.

FIRST FIANCEE OF THE SEASON.
Miss Grace Gorrill, Whose Engagement to Oscar Gow
ing Has Just Been Announced.
OAKLAND, Aug. 22.â Miss Grace Hathcrly Gorrill. one of the best
known young ladles in Oakland's exclusive set. has announced her engage
ment to Oscar Gowing, a young business man of San Francisco. Miss
Gorrill was a graduate of the Oakland High School in the class of June,
18 r <7 and is one of the youngest fiancees announced for many years. She
has' been more than ordinarily popular and has frequently led the cotillon
in the Saturday Night Club. Mrs- Gorrill has always been one of the most
active patronesses of the younger folks' dancing clubs, and Miss Grace has
always been prominent in promoting the success of these social organiza
tions! The Aegis of the class of ''.'T in its jokes states that Miss GorriU's
chief characteristic was b:ishfulness. and that her chief attainment in the
Oakland High School was studying under Professor Mead of the chem
istry department: while her aim in life was to be a member of the 400.
Few of the graduates have made a larger circle of friends. Oscar Gowing
is a graduate of the Boston School of Technology.
CRIME AND
NATIONALITY
Exact Parallel for the
Killing of Hollenbeck.
QUONG IS TO STAND TRIAL
SIX COMPANIES WILL TBY TO
SAVE HIS NECK.
Twenty-Five Years Ago in a Similar
Case the Slayer Was Not Held
to Answer for the
Deed.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Aug. 22.
Quong Mow, who shot and killed Na
than Hollenbeck a few nights ago while
the latter was stealing: from his corn
patch, will be examined on a charge of
murder. A complaint was sworn to this
morning by Frank Rivest, the father-in
law of the murdered man. Rivest, who
was with Hollenbeck at the time of the
murder, was helu in jail two days wait
ing to be charged with burglary by the
Chinaman, but Quong Mow did not swear
to a warrant.
The rase will be bitterly fought, and al
ready Mow has been assured of the â¢up
port of the Six Companies in his defense
and will V>e represented by their counsel,
Attorney Riordan.
The rase will furnish an interesting ex
ample of the trend of justice in Alameda
County, as between white people and
Chinamen. Twenty-five years ago in the
; same neighborhood where Hollenbeck
â  was murdered a Portuguese rancher
named Henry Cordez, who is now a pros-
I perous man in the southern part of the
; State, was annoyed by Chinese robbing
his gardens at Te.mes-cal. One night he
detected a thief in his potato patch and
with a double-barreled gun shot in the
direction of the thief. He did not hear a
sound and concluded that he had done no |
more harm than frighten the marauder
; away. ,Next morning he found a dead
! Chinaman in his garden. "Cordez went to
Captain Tarbet of the Police Department,
j gave himself up and was told to go away
and he would be sent for if wanted. The
1 Coroner's jury attached no blame to Cor
j dez and nothing more was done in the
! case.
The incidents are precisely similar to
| the tragedy of last Friday night, with the
| Chinaman the aggressor instead of the
victim. _________^____
BAPTISTS IN DEBATE.
Oakland Will Continue to Be Visited ;
by the Union.
OAKLAND, Aug. 22.â The Baptist Mln- I
isters' Union of San Francisco and Oak
i land met this morning in this city and
| Oakland came very near being tabooed by '
this body for the future. The question j
of changing the place of meeting to San
Francisco all the time instead of alter
nating with this city was subjected to con
i siderable discussion. But it was finally |
decided to continue the present arrange
ment. Among those who were present
were Revs. E. C. Woods, D.D., George
Gibson and C. H. Hobart.
The paper of the day was read by Rev.
W C. Jenkins on "Church Repudiation
ists." Mr. Jenkins said that there were
several causes for the neglect of the
churches. He mentioned abnormal
churchism, the idea taught by some that
church membership insures salvation; ab
normal ideas of holiness, some people
thinking that the church Is corrupt; ab-
I normal evangelists, who were defined as
evangelists who made small account of
the church but gladly counted converts;
abnormal substitutes for the church, such
as the Salvation Army and the Christian
Alliance; abnormal theology which was
defined as the idea that the church is
universal, and that the local church is
of small account. The paper brought on
a lively discussion, most of those present
agreeing with Its author.

FOOTBALL MEN IN GLEE.
The University of California Will
Have Yale's Center This Year.
PERKELEY, Aug. 22â Thpre is rejoic
ing In the ranks of Berkeley's football
men to-day. Rumors have been current
on the campus that H. 1,. Cadwalader, a
leading athlete from New Haven, is
about to enter the University of Califor
nia. Should the rumor prove true the
â¢varsity men may hope to remedy one of
the weakest points in last year's team.
Carlwalader is the crack center from
Yale. His coming means that Berkeley
will have one of the star Eastern players
with which to face Stanford next
Thanksgiving day. With a thoroughly
good center and the ends of last year the
University of California should have a
better line this season than ever before.
Captain Percy Hall will meet all the foot
ball men to-morrow afternoon at 3:45
o'clock. The whole situation will be dis
cussed at that time.

LEES MAY STOP
THE PUGILISTS
Boxing Clubs That Do
Not Pay a License.
"PUGS" TOYING WITH DEATH
RINGS THAT ARE NOT PADDED
CONSIDERED DANGEROUS.
The National Club Will Give a Good
Entertainment To-Morrow
Night at Woodward's
Pavilion.
The National Athletic Club, Professor
Groom manager, will give an entertain
ment to-morrow evening in Woodward's
Pavilion, and the card, considering the
prices of admission, is truly good. Mul
ler of the Manhattan Club always puts
up a good argument, and Dudley Evans,
who will be his opponent, is said to be
quite clever, having had instructions
from Jack Dempsey, the once great mid
dle-weight champion of the world. Those
who have seen Evans box say that he is
quick and clever, and that he will hay*
all the best of Muller for three or four
rounds. According to the articles of
agreement the referee must give a de
cision at each event. The preliminaries
are also good, all things considered. The
bill of tistic fare presented is worth
much more money to a lover of fistic
sports than the sum asked by the club
for admission.
Chief of Police Lees may have to an
swer for the death of some "would-be"
pugilist some line morning.
The several mushroom clubs that are
now scattered all over the city in the
interest of political tistic sport will cer
tainly be the means of killing, and for all
time, the game of fisticuffs.
The so-called amateur athletic clubs
are in no sense of the word amateur,
but are the contrary; they are simon
pure professional, as they charge an ad
mission fee and also pay pugilists for
whatever damage they may Inflict upon
one another during a scrap.
The better athletic clubs that do not
profess to be anything other than pro
fessional are charged a license fee of $100
before they can think of giving an enter
tainment. Why should not professional
' amateur clubs be made to pay a like sum?
! In fact, they should be taxed $200, as they
encourage a lot of loafers who cannot
tight and will not work by giving them a
1 few dollars to scrap a few rounds for tne
j editlcation of the so-called members of
i the club. ,
The "amateur" trains for a six-round
' scrap according to the amount of monoy j
'he receives for training expenses, and j
! unless the "pug" is a good sixth-rater his
j training expenses are invariably nothing.
The result of this "amateur" scrapping
! will sooner or later end in the death of
lan untrained and unconditioned boxer,
I and then who will be held accountableâ
1 the club or the police authorities who al-
I lowed the "fatty degenerated" pug to en
! ter into a contest?
Then again, the amateur clubs do not
; pad their ring floors properly and many of
! them do not pad them at all. It is a well
: known fact that deaths in the prize ring
have resulted from fractures of the skull
Inflicted by severe contact with a hard
floor but in this city little or no attention
Is paid to the -adding of the rinjrs by the
police officers who are detailed to see
that everything Is carried out properly
Tt must be said, however, to the credit
of the National and Olympic clubs that
i their rings or ring floors are always prop-
Irv Prided and that the men who are
engaged to box must be physically sound
before they are allowed to put on a
| KI As e the Amateur Athletic Union of
i America has ordained that there are no
I longer any amateur boxers it is but Just
that the small-fry clubs be made to pay

PREDICTS A WAR
AMONG THE DOCTORS
ATTORNEY CHAPMAN'S IDEA OF
DR. SHARP'S TRIAL.
The Doctor's Bail Is Fixed at Eight
Thousand Dollars â Inquest Held
on the Victim.
OAKLAND, Auk- 22.â Dr. Calvin J.
Sharp was in the Police Court to-day on
the charge of manslaughter sworn to by
' Mrs. M. Madsen. Sharp Is accused of
i malpractice while treating Mrs. Tena Nel
son, the daughter of Mrs. Madsen.
Attorney M. C. Chapman, who will do
fend Sharp, made a motion to have the
prisoner admitted to ball, and Judge Allen
fixed the bond at $20,000. Attorney Chap
i man said that It might as well be $60,000,
and gave the information that Judge
Greene in a similar case had fixed the
bail at $SOOO, and finally asked that It be
j made $2500. TT â
"It will develop, your Honor, said Mr.
I Chapman, "that this is a fight between
the different schools of medicine and that
! It is a case of dog eat Jog."
After some argument Judge Allen re
! duced the bail to $Â«000, and set the case
for examination on August 26.
An inquest was held this evening on
the death of Mrs. Tena Nelson. A num
ber of witnesses testified as to the dead
woman's complaints about sickness for
! several days previous to her demise. Of
; these the principal one was Mrs. Ellen
King whose testimony, was that Mrs.
Nelson had stated that her husband had
! urged her to have an operation per
formed which she dreaded. Mrs Nioma
Clark testified that Dr. Sharp had stated
! when he learned of Mrs. Nelson's â¢ re-
I moval that she should not have been re
i mover before four or five days.
The husband also testified as to the
j circumstances surrounding his wife a
sickness, but from him no new facts were
ad Dr JC Susan J. Fenton and Dr. S. H. Bu
teau" testified as to an autopsy, and the
first named testified evidences of mal
â  practice were found. Dr. Buteau testi
: fled there was no evidence showing that
an instrument had been used.
The Coroner's jury returned a verdict
that death was caused by septic perito
i nltls but whether the death was due to a
criminal operation or otherwise the jury
i wus unable to sny.
BORAX WORKS CLOSED.
The Big White Factory Suspends
Operations and Discharges All
Hands.
ALAMEDA, Aug. 22.â After running al
most without cessation for twenty-one
years, the Pacific Coast Borax Works of
Alameda have closed down and between
fifty and sixty men have been thrown out
of employment. Only a dozen men are re
tained some to continue the manufacture
of bo'raclc acid, and the remainder to
clean-up the large plant which will soon
be a thing of the past.
The bulk of the employes were dis
charged a week ago Saturday night. Th.-y
had no warning and don't know for what
: reason the works are closed down and
i can only conjecture that the cause is the
j establishment of a new and larger plant
[in New York City. It was also stated that
'â  as soon as it was in running order the
: works here would furnish employment to
no more men.
The works refined as much as three car
loads of crude borax per day.
Missing Man Found.
ALAMEDA, Aug. 22.-Last Thursday it
was reported to the police of this city and
Oakland that John Richarson, an old
man, residing with his son at 2154 Ala
meda avenue, was missing. Yesterday
he was found by the police In a saloon
on High street. It is thought hia mind Is
affected and he did not seem to realize
that he was lost.
CLAWSON AND
HIS CONTRACT
The Rider Wants to
Work for Whitney.
HOPES TO GET GOOD MOUNTS
GOSSIP OF THE FUTURITY, TO BE
RUN TO-DAY.
Australians Do Not Believe in Rac
ing Two- Year-Olds Much â Sad
Fate of Banquet, Once a.
Champion.
Dick Clawson of Woodland. Cal., now
famous aa a clever rider of race horses,
Is trying his utmost to yet his contract
with Atkln & Lottrldge set aside so that
he can ride next season for W. C. Whit
ney. He declares the firm that made a
â¢ contract with him for three years have
' violated their agreement, and he will at
i once appeal to have the contract annulled
:by the Jockey Club. Atkin & Lottridge
: sublet Clawson's services to Sam C. Hil
i dreth last spring. No wonder Clawson
wants to ride the WhJtney-Paget horses,
for in the stable is Jean Beraud. Plaudit,
Martha and many other good ones and it
i is the intention of Mr. Whitney to add
I the best racers next season that money
i can purchase.
The race for the Futurity to-day bids
! fair to be the most open In the history of
I this richest of all two-year-old stake
events. Tod Sloan and Willie Martin, the
best horse-pilots in America, will steer
the Fleischmann pair. Sir Hubert and Dr.
Elchberg, and Maher. Clawson, R. Wil
liams, Simms and all the other stars of
the pigskin firmament will "have a leg
i up." ft is expected that Autumn will be
heavily backed and his chances are fan
cied bebt by most persons, but with such
clever artists as Sloan and W. Martin
in the saddle it is hard to see just how
the Fleischmann pair is to be downed, for
i with jockeys that outclass the lot It cer
j tainly looks as if half the battle is won,
iat the least. Last year the race was won
by L'Alouette, a very ordinary filly by
Klnglike, the mighty Hambury not being
eligible to start. This season the best
two-year-old yet uncovered, Jean Beraud.
iis not eligible. However, the field that
j will line up to-day will far outshine in
racing ability the one that faced the bar
rier in ISI>7. It is doubtful if the race will
ever be <rorth the sum to the fortunate
owner that it was in IS9O, when Potomac
captured the plum for Mr. Belmont, and
Masher, his stable companion, was sec
ond. The winnings of the pair in the
stake that year went over $73,000. There
! is no stake run for in the world worth
that amount to-day. The nearest ap
proach to it is the Jockey Club stakes.
: worth Â£10.000. and run in England. The
Melbourne cup used to have Â£5000 added
and went close to the $60,000 mark a couple
of times, but the Futrity, for richness,
overshadows any stake race in the world â
at least, it will average up better than
any other.
In Australia the jockey clubs are cut
ting off a number of the two-year-old
stakes, and set forth the claim that two
year-old racing is injurious rather than
beneficial. They will give no race for two
yrar-olds to amount to anything. Cer
tainly it appears that there is a much
larger proportion of sprinters nowadays
than "stayers," and It can be laid at the
door of excessive two-year-old racing and
the wolflshness of many turfmen to "get
their money out" quickly, even if as
three-year-olds their horses "haven't a
leg to stand upon." In California we
have youngsters racing in the latter part
of January, when a majority are not over
twenty-two months old, and it is a fact
that cannot be controverted that few of
these "early birds" ever catch any worms
worth having when they are three years
old or upward. The unbeaten race horses.
Eclipse and American Eclipse, were not
trained until they were five years of age.
while Glencoe. Emillus and Priam were al
so examples of what can be accomplished
with a horse that is allowed to "get Its
growth" before being raced.
The once-great Banquet, who won over
$ino,OOo for M. F. Dwyer in stakes and
fiursos, and perhaps three times that sum
n bets is having an inglorious and very
sad wind-up of his earthly career. He is
pulling a hansom cab in London and is
often cursed and probably beaten by his
present owner, William Bruggs, for whom
the poor old hero sometimes does not go
fast enough. This is Bruggs' comment on
the horse:
"Oh. yes; I bought him at a hoss sale
In Crariborne street. He was one of a
lot of wornout thoroughbreds that came
down from some stables in the North.
Yes, his name's Banquet, all right, though
how you come to know It puzzles me.
They do say he was once a crack racer
In America." Pity he doesn't show it now.
Get up there, you brute. Can't get a
decent gallop onto 'im. I'll have to get
rid of the beast somehow."
It seems that M. F. Dwyer lost the ex
champlon racer In a selling race at the
Newmarket July meeting three years ago.
Mr Archer securing him. He began to
get the slows and they tried to make a
jumper of himâ and they tried to make a
stand it Then came racing at little coun
try fairs and finally his sale to Bruggs,
who probably has as much sentiment In
his composition as a professional heads
man. And America has had few better
racers than this same Banquet.

Christian Association of the University of
California will give a reception to the men
You know that our minister used to be a practicing
physician. He was a graduate of the College of Physi-
cians and Surgeons, New York, and he says of Ripans
Tabules that the formula has long been in favor with
medical men, but the method of preparation in the pres-
ent form is modern and a very great convenience. He
lately spoke of them to me in these very words : " I
always keep a vial of the Tabules upon my dressing-
table and use them with confidence whenever occasion
arises. For a disturbed condition of the digestive or-
gans I know of nothing so good, and for an â  all round *
family remedy I do not believe there is anything better

DROWNED IN ' THE BAY.
Henry Woolenschleger. a Boy, Falls
Through a Hole in the Floor of
a Slaughter-House. ..
Two boys about eight years of- age, Hen
ry Woolenschleger, i 573 Fifth avenue
south, and Peter Page, Ruilroarl and
Fifth avenues, were â¢ playing at McDer
mott's sraughter-house Sunday afternoon
about, two o'clock, when Woolensbhleger
fell through a hole in the floor into the
bay and was drowned.
â â â¢â¢â The â boy Page got so frightened. that he
ran away without raising an. alarm and
it was not till â  6 -o'clock at night that he
mustered up courage to tell his parents of
the fate of hi? companion.
Lieutenant Anderson was notified and
the bay in the neighborhood of the
slaughter-house was dragged Sunday night
and yesterday for the body, but without
success. . . '
The Women's Club.
The California Club, the newest and
largest of San Francisco's women's asso
ciations, has secured rooms in the Young
Men's Christian Association building and
will hold its meetings there after the
first of September. The rooms are to
be open to the members and their friends
at all times, and as they are to be fitted
up and managed in the most approved
club-room style, will doubtless prove a
greatly appreciated convenience to those
ladies who are fortunate enough to pos
sess the right of visiting thPtn. Luxuri
ous furnishings, writing desks and sta
tionery, newspapers and magazines, and
available cups of tea. will make the club
home an ideal spot In which to rest
when fatigued by shopping trips.
The work outlined by the club is ex
tensive but under the able leadership
of Mrs. I.ovell White, the president, and
the other earnest and enthusiastic ladies
who have taken charge of the different
departments. It is expected the Califor
nia will soon rival the famous Woman's
Club of Chicago, after which It is mod
eled.
Sues for Big Damages.
Margaret Kprripan. as administratrix of
the estate of Patrick Kerrigan, has sued
the Market Street Railway Company for
damages in the sum of $25,000. Patrick
Kerrigan, who was employed by the de
fendant corporation, was killed on May 3
i of the present year, while unloadinjc rails
from a flat car. It is alleged by the plain
tiff that the cars were defective and that
the deceased came to his death through
the negligence of the railway company.

THE SEVENTH CALIFORNIA TO

The Problem to Let the Expedition

Be Solved.
The next transport to sail from San \

probably sail on Thursday, and the troops

the Twenty-third infantry, about 325
Oregon recruits, booked for Manila, and

further instructions, the Scandia. of
course, i;; subject to the same order.
When th*-se two transports will reach
Manila is therefore problematical. It is
.intimated that the change of destination
was due to a fear that the dispatching of
them direct to Manila at this timo would
In- a violation of the peace protocol unner
which the armistice has been declared.
In all probability the. authorities at
Washington are endeavoring to solve the
problem In .some satisfactory way so that
the troops and supplies on the two trans
i irta can be forwarded to General Mer
ritt at an early day in accordance with
the original intention. In the event that
this cannot be done it Is very Likely that
the Scandia will leave her Philippine
troops a 1 Honolulu and proceed with her
supplies, including provisions, hospital
stores and 1,000,000 rounds of ammunition.
to Moniia. where she is to be used as a
hospital ship under the Red Cross fine.
She may also fill out her freight cargo by 1
taking a portion of the Arizona's freight.
The forwarding to Honolulu of all the
remaining expeditionary forces will begin
at the end of this week and proceed as
rapidly as transportation can be furnish
ed, this being in accordance with Instruc
tions received from Washington by Gen
eral Merriam as published In Sunday
morning's Call. ThÂ« City of Sydney and
the Australia, the former having a ca
pacity of 775 men and the latter 596, will
be ready to sail on Saturday and will
carry the Seventh California Regiment.
The"<Mty of Peking, which arrived at this
fi..rt yesterday from Manila, will fol- ;

ports are expected back soon from the
Philippines, and it Is safe- to say that
unless contrary orders <i>me from Wash
ington ;ill the expeditionary forces now
hero will be landed at Honolulu within
thirty .lays. Four months' supplies for
these troops are to lie sent to Honolulu.
If the orders for the transfer are fully
carried out. and no more troops are for
the present to be sent t'i Manila. th*re
will soon I>*-â I >*-â  rampc] at Honolulu nearly

a pleasant outing if nothing else.
PREPARED TO MOVE.
The Eighth Regiment Soon Ex
pects Orders to Go to
Honolulu
CAMP BARRETT, Bather Tract. AiifÂ». !
22.â The Eighth Regiment is now slated
for Honolulu, if the intimations heard
In and about Camp Barrett go for any- .
thing.
mcl Iler.fihaw is reported to have .
received definite orders, although he is '
as yet loath to make public their im
port or significance. Rumor, however.
has it that the colonel baa been ordered
to hold hip men in readiness for a move
pome dr.y this week. Ho lias also receiv
.ed orders to make requisition for four
months' supplies.
That therf* Is something more than ru
mor in it Is also evidenced by n state- \
m<"Tt reported to have been made by
Colonel Henshaw to Private James Hill
of Company G, whose- father died at l,os
Anpel^s a few days since. The young;
soldier asked Imploringly for a fur
lough of two or three days in order that
ho might attend his father's funeral. The
colonel, In refusing this privilege, said ;
that he could not do SO, because he> did
not expect that the rr-Kim<--nt would be
stationed at Camp Barrett but a few |
days longer.
It will be two months to-morrow since
thr- Eighth located in its present quar
ters, and within that period several re
ports of probable moves have kept up
the enthusiasm of the soldiers; but with
returning peace these prospects i.-windlfd
to forgotten dreiims. and at present there
Is a ferMng of considerable unrest in
camp.
LIQUORS IN THE ARMY.
The Methodist Ministers of San
Francisco Denounce the
"Canteen" System.
At the regular weekly meeting of the
Methodist Ministers yesterday morning,
the following was unanimously adopted:
Whereas, the so-called canteen system which
now prevails in the army subjects our soldier
boys to the temptations of the saloons, and has
been the means of leading multitudes of young
men Into the drink habit, and
Whereas. Many young mpn have been de
tailed to render service as bartenders, who have
conscientious scruples asrainst handling Intox
icants, and in consequence of refusal to serve
in the capacity of bartenders have been sent
to the guardhouse, and
Whereas, The use of beers and wines in the
army posts and soldiers' homes has led to In
creased Incorrigribllltv and drunkenness among
. the soldiers, and
Wherens. We rÂ»Kard the traffic in strong;
; drink as an unmitigated evil In this nation,
and prolific of inebriety. insanity and criminal
ity, a menace to our homes and youth: be It,
therefore.
Resolved, That we, the members of the Meth
odist preachers' meetlnp of San Francisco, do
hereby respectfully request the President of
â¢ the United States as commandrr-In-chlef of the
army and navy to use the authority vested In
him by the constitution and do all In his power
to suppress the sale of beer and wines and al
coholic beverages in the "canteens" of the
army, whether in the field, in the army posts
âr In the soldiers' home.
Captain Stants Has Resigned.
â  C. B. Staats. captain of Company B.
First New York Volunteers, has resigned
his commission. As snon as peace was
declared he wired President IfcfClnley,
requesting permission to leave the serv
ice. Yesterday he received word from
Washington that his request had been
â¢ granted. Immediately upon receipt of
the Information lieutenant Colonel Stac
pole. In command of the remaining forces
of the First New Yorks, granted Captain
Staats an indefinite leave of absence. He
will return to Albany on Wednesday. In
all probability W. B. Mansen. first lieu
tenant of Company B, will succeed Staats
to the captaincy. Mr. Staats is the larpest
wholesale coal dealer In Albany. His busi
ness Interests demand his Immediate re
turn to the capital city of the Empire
State. Had the war continued he would
have been forced to remain In the serv
ice. notwithstanding 1 the urgent necessity
of his returning? home. A brother of Mr.
Staats holds a commission as 'second
lieutenant, in the volunteer service..

DRAMA, OPERA
AND COMEDY
â¢â¢Heartsease" Scores a
Pronounced Hit.
THE NEW BALDWIN IS A GEM
MORRISON PLAYS SHYLOCK
VERY SUCCESSFULLY.
"La Gioconda" Presented at the
Tivoli â The Columbia, Morosco's
and the Orpneum Have
Excellent Bills.
A charming play, a beautifully remod
eled theater and an old-time first night
house resplendent In rich costumes and
Jewels, formed a combination that made
the reopening of the Baldwin Theater last
evening a distinct society and dramatic
ev< .:t. It was not the usual first night
house, with its cool, critical receptive
mood, but one that accepted the produc
tion with enthusiastic warmth and In
sisted on recalls too numerous to men
tion.
"Heartsease." as presented by Henry
Miller and the Frohman Company, scored
a genuine hit before the action was half
completed. It Is one of those quiet,
smooth-running romantic dram.-.s with
Quantum sufP.'Mt of pathos and comedy
which requires an excellent company to
properly display its charms. Its cordial
reception shows that this was done to the
entire satisfaction of the critical audience
which witnessed Its introduction here.
Aside from its polished dialogue it is a
series of bright and pretty moving scenes
which make the story tell itself.
Mr. Miller is always pleasing in the part
of a lover, and as Eric Temple, the vic
tim of dire circumstances in love as well
as career, he presents a character in
which there Is little to criticize. It is
subdued yet virile and his deep and well
modulated voice adds greatly to the at
traction of the part.
He has surrounded himself with a.n ex
cellent, well-balanced company, among
which Augustus Cook, as Lord Neville,
the crabbed old father of the sweetheart
in the case; C. L. Allen, as Peter Pad
bury, the parvenu seeking social recog
nition; Charles B. Welles, the clumsy
Irish lover; George Heath, as the un
scrupulous Major Twunbly. were study
perfect In their various parts. The same
can be said of Mabel Bert, as Lady Ke
vi..e, and Ellen Mortimer, as Alice Tem
ple, the loving and sympathetic sister of
the lovelorn composer.
Margaret Dale, in the character of the
unhappy ladylove of Temple, displayed
exceptional abilities and quickly won her
way to favor. The other parts were well
played.
"Hcnrtsease" gops for this w^ek only,
and will doubtless have a very successful
run.
The remodeled and refitted theater was
a pleasing surprise to the large audience.
It Is decorated in white, pale blue and
gold, which lights up splendidly and
shows off the fine costumes of the ladies
admirably. The stage has lioon rebuilt
and lowered, the orchestra Is below the
level of the parquet, at.d the electric
lighting and the carpets are new. In short
the Baldwin has not only been made up
to date In every particular, but Is a
beauty that needs to be seen to be appre
ciated.
The management is to be congratu
lated upon the auspicious reopening of
their popular play house and for their
genuine enterprise. They are up to date
also.
The Cqlumbin.
"On Probation." a merry little comedy,
containing most of the pood things that
comedy writers have made use of for
years, was the offering: at the Columbia
last evening.
Thf play Is from the pen of Jessep and
Mathews, and tells with a dash and a
vim Â«.f the snares to which the suscepti
ble male heart, backed by the possession
of a large and ready purs*-. Is exposed
It also brings to a satisfactory conclu
sion the argument that, in spite of th
elasticity of the same male heart, it ma>
beat for on*' and one alone.
The authors of "On Probation" hay
not sought for new nor devious paths t
maintain the thread of their story. Wha
was good enough for a generation of pla
writers was good enough for*thom. Time
honored situations culled from many ant
various sources have been skillfull
dashed together, and the result Is a llgh
and airy ensemble that makes an evenln
pars quickly and merrily.
The little comedy Is cast to the ful
strength of thf Frawley Company. Theo
dore Roberts easily ranks first as the su>
ceptible SilÃbe. with Miss Kara Kenwy
a close second as the intriguing Lad
Frank Brooke. The moment John Burk
steps upon the stage it is evident that h
is a fire-eater of some sort, from a coun
try to which he does honor.
Fnnchon Campbell was a dainty Mar
Marlowe, and Ned Bell made the most o
Sir Maurice. Alfred Hlckman as a Ru.s
slan Prince. Miss Adora Andrews as th
fetching wife of Pedro. Eleanor Carey a
Mrs. Harmony and Edward Con way a
the Ã¼blquitouÃ waiter, added to the gen
â¦ral cxc ellence of the cast. "On Proba
tion" runs for the week and deserves bet
ter houses than the one which witnessed
the premiere last evening.
Thf> i lvo i.
The fourth week of grand opera at the
Tivoli opened with Ponchlelli's master
piece, "La Gloconda," last night before a
large and intelligent audience. Miss Car
rie Roma, in the title role, showed asraln
this season what she had proved last year,
a line musical voice, of which she pos
sesses a marvelous control, and good eno
tional acting. Miss Mary Llnck, as the
blind mother, sang and acted her part to
perfection, although her figure would be
more adapted for a queen than a beggar.
â â¢ contralto is very sweet 'and capable
rreat power. Mr. de Vrtea has shown
? more how masterfully he handles the
ian villnln. His mimicry and voice are
always fascinating. Miss Crox, as Laura,
sang" well, but looked hideous in her
mask, which should be black instead of a
flesh tint. Mr. Thomas, as Enzo, was well
in voice and sang the duet in the second
act beautifully. His pianissimo In the
barcarolle was very much appreciated by
the audience. The cast this week is a
double one. alternating the principals, a
fact which involved a great amount of
work and expense to the management.
Director Mlrshfeld, who carries on his
work without assistants, deserves a grea*.
deal of credit for the perfection to which
he carried out lar-t night's performance,
in the short time of aix days, and he must
have felt { roud when the audience In
sisted on four curtain calls after the
grand finale of the third act.
The chorus sang very well, considering
the short time the members had to study
tffis opera, and Mr. Perron, who took the
part of Zuane, promises a bright future.
Bignor Wanrell. as Badoero, has a very
pleasing basso, and his acting was surely
good enough to help the audience over the
bridge of his singing In Italian.
"La Gloconda" will be played every
night and Saturday matineo this week,
except Sunday, when, by special request,
there will be one more night of Gounod's
"Faust."
The Alcazar.
"For twenty yean it has been the
height of my ambition to personate the
Jew Shylock as I believe it should be pre
sented, and your hearty appreciation of
the greatest effort of my life, as you have
expressed it here to-night, is the richest
reward that I could expect or desire."
These were the words of Lewis Morrison
last evening at the Alcazar when on re
peated calls he appeared before the cur
tain at the conclusion of the third act in
"The Merchant of Venice." His portrayal
of the difficult part was highly succesÃ
ful and greatly appreciated by a large
audience, all curious to see how he would
handle the role in which he appeared for
the first time.
lorrlson's conception of the character
he Venetian Jew differs widely from
t of famous artists who have por
ed the part, but the difference only
le his acting the more entertaining,

Portia. Twenty people appear in the cast
and they are all capable. The stage set
ting was excellent. This Is the last week
of Mr. Morrison and Miss Roberts in this
city for this season.
The Orpneum.
Mmp. Marie Tavary Is the feature of
this week's bill at the Orpheum. Last
evening she received an ovation. Her
first number was an operatic selection
rendered with expression and sweetness.
It was her encores, however, that sealed
her success. Her rendition of the "Aye
Maria," set to Mascagni's famous Inter
mezzo, brought out the full quality of her
\'oiee, which Is wonderfully fresh, all
things considered. By request she sang
Tom Moore's immortal lyric. "The Last
Rose of Summer." In response to a second
encore, and many old theater-goers
present compared her effort favorably
with Paul's famous rendition. Mius Lil
lian Burkhart, supported by Carl Wilbur
and William Brewer, appeared In a
charming curtain-raiser, "The Salt Cel
lar." The piece was played with unusual
intelligence and finish. Charles Case and
the American Biograph are the other new
attractions. The Hegelmanns continue
their great aerial act.
ivior'osco's.
"The, Ordeal of Two Sisters." a sensa
tional melodrama by Dr. T. Callahan and
Louis A. Imhaus. received its Initial pro
duction at Morosco's last night and made
a decided hit. It leads off in the firrt act
with the financial ruin and murder of Mr.
Cavendish and the troubles of his daugh
ters, Belle and Annie. Lorena Attwood,
as Belie, carries the heavy parts of the
leading lady easily and grace-fully and
Landers Stevens' work as the villain, is
clean cut. The fifth act terminates with
a t(Mifin< nt-house fire which Is a scenic
woiidor even for Morcsco's. While the six
nets abound with startling incidents the
play is rather long and a little judicious
clipping will improve It considerably.
Chutes TheKer.
At the Chutes, notwithstanding the fog,
the Free Theater was crowded last even
ing and the performance went with a
snap and vim most refreshing. Busch,
the "Golden Vampire." was new, and suc
ceeded in tying himself into seemingly in
extricable knots, while Garden and Hunt,
a new musical team, played popular
melodies on a variety of instruments.
Arturo S.nlvinl has a well-cultivated and
sweet tenor voice and his operatic selec
tions and ballads were cordially greeted.
Edwin R. Lang, the poetical tramp, was
even funnier than last week and Bel! and
Dal ton. fifrman comedians, and El Nino
Eddy, hounding wire performers, had new
nets. There were many novelties In the
moving pictures and < annon and the Zoo
received their usual amount of attention.
Oiympia.
Kelly and Violet, a pair of descriptive
singers, with new Songs, are one of the
new features at the Olympia Music Hali.
The Royal Tokio Acrobats have a new
aci lor this the last week of t..elr en
gagement. Maude Rockwell, soprfw), the
Royce Sisters and others contribute to an
attractive bill.
FELL FROM A CULVERT.
Private Garner, Battery E,
Third Artillery, Is Proba
bly Fataly Irjured.
Private William T. Garner of Battery
E, Third Artillery, was found yesterday
morning lying at the bottom of the brick
culvert near Fort Point In an unconscious
condition. lie was taken to the post hos
pital, whore Surgeon Moseley dressed two
gaping scalp wounds. Garner has con
cussion of the brain, and there Is little
chance of his recovery. He has not yet
regained consciousness. He had been
down town on a pass, and had been drink
ing. The supposition is that he fell over
the brick wall above the culvert while
walking along the edge of the roadway,
striking his head on a pile of rocks.

MRS. BOTKIN
TALKS ABOUT
J. P. DUNNING
Says He Was Her Friend, but
Fears That She Has Some
"Malignant Enemy,"
Repudiates Examiner Interviews and Talks
of "That Awful, Fiendish Double Mur
der" â Arrests Expected.
STOCKTON, Aug. 22. â Mrs. W. A.
Botkin, whose name is closely con
nected with the Dunning murder mys
tery, is at the Windsor Hotel, un
der the protection of her husband and
a nurse. Mrs. Botkin is deeply dis
tressed over the tragedy, and agitated
almost beyond self-control by the pub
lication of a dispatch that she is to
be arrested on a warrant from Dover,
charging her with murder. Her husband
defends her most loyally, and emphati
cally asserts that he is satisfied of her
innocence of the crime and that she has
not been guilty of any wrong doing.
Mrs. Botkin came here several days
ago and has been changing her abiding
place from day to day to avoid being
interviewed. To-night, however, she
consented to give a statement to The
Call. She said:
"I have been so grossly and malicious
ly misrepresented by the Examiner that
I have repeatedly declined to say any
thing about my relations with Mr. Dun
ning or about the horrible, cruel murder
of his wife and sister-in-law. While I
did grant an interview to a lady reporter
of the Examiner I never uttered the
words credited to me in many sentences.
"In addition to that, the statement that,
on my arrival here, my husband and I
had a stormy interview, during which I
pleaded with him to save me, is an ab
solute falsehood. I haVe not committed
any crime, and there was no occasion for
me to implore any one to shield me from
punishment. Another statement pub
lished by the Examiner which is false is
that Mr. Dunning sent or gave me his
wife's letters to read. I never saw a let
ter written by Mrs. Dunning. I nevÂ«r
saw. her In my life. I was not her en
emy. I woultl not have married Dun
ning had he been free to wed.
"When he was in Salt Lake Mr. Dun
ning sent me one anonymous letter which
had been received by hie wife, in which it
was Bald he was devoting all his time to
a woman at 9-T Geary street. Mrs. Dun
ning sent the letter to her husband and
he sent it to me with an inscription, 'You
Â deadly enemy.' That Is the only
letter other than his own writing that I
ever received from Mr. Dunning. It is
true that I corresponded with Mr. Dun
ning after he left San Francisco, and it is
also true that we were true, trusted and
tried friends, but nothing more. I do not
know who wrote the anonymous letters to
Mr. Punning and I have no suspicion as
to who the author was. I do know, how
evi r. that I have a malignant and vindic
tive enemy, but whom 1 cannot say, and
this person has brought my name Into
this horrible tragedy to injure me.
â¢'The horror of that awful, fiendisa.
double murder is still upon me, and to
think I am accused of itâ when God in
heaven knows 1 urn Innocent. Mr. Dun
ning idolized his wife and darling little
girl and his despair was most pitiable
when they left him and went East. He

often said, 'It would be far better for
them if I were dead.'
"He carried a life insurance of $12,500
and often went without food to meet the
premiums so his family would be pro
vided for after his death.
"When he realized that his defalcation
would be discovered he wrote to his wife
telling her of his rash acts and then
threatened to commit suicide. I expected
every day he would kill Himself. When
his shame became known to his family
and friends he drank to drown his sorrow.
It was at this time that Mrs. Corbaley be
friended him both iinaneially and with en
| couraging, hopeful words.
"Neither my husband nor myself ever
sought a divorce or thought of gc-tiing
one. We have been married over twenty
six years, during which time he has al
ways provided for me. I have a son
25 years of age. who is as deajr-to me as
any boy Is to his mother. That my hus
band and myself have agreed to live apart
because of diverse temperaments and
tastes is our own affair. We have always
been on the best of terms though separat
ed, and he frequently visited me at my
apartment.- in the city and I came hero
at least onoe every two months to enjoy
the society of my boy and his father.
My husband sent me remittances twice
a month. A divorce was never mentioned
but once, and that was about a year and
a half ago. Mrs. Seeley came to me and
said my husband was preparing to secure
a divorce that he might marry Mrs. Ar
bogast. I immediately came to Stockton
and asked Mr. Botkin if there was any
truth in the story and informed him that
I would never allow him to divorce me
after I had given him my youth and
reared his son to manhood. My husband
declared he had no intention of suing for
a divorce and marrying again.
"Regarding the statements of Mrs.
Moore, the landlady at 927 Geary street,
I can only say that she is insane. Her
son, who died some time ago, was also
crazy. He was so violent during one of
my husband's visits that he advised me
to leave the house. Mrs. Corbaley I did
not know. Mme. Thompson visited my
rooms several times and played cards
with Mr. Dunning, my son and myself.
We never indulged in liquor to excess. All
the time Mr. Dunning roomed in the same
house with me. my son was there. My
son was out of employment and occupied
my apartments.
"I have lived in San Francisco nearly
| all the time for the past two years. I
i like a lively life and am fond of excite
j ment. I left San Francisco a couple of
i weeks ago and went to my sister's home
in Healdsburg. When Mrs. Dunnings
death was announced and my name was
i associated with that of her husband I de
cided to rejoin my husband. I came here
and will remain here.
"If I am to be arrested the officers will
have no difficulty in linding me. I ad
mit frankly that I have a number of Mr.
Dunning's letters to me, and 1 assure you
they will not be destroyed. If the prosper
authorities want them they can have
them. It is impossible for me to believe
that Mr. Dunning has charged me with
the atrocious, diabolical crime of send
i ing poisoned caTidy to his wife. I am cer
tain he does not even suspect that I am
so wanton. I am prepared at any mo
ment to tell the whole story of my life,
because there Is nothing I need to con
ceal. The publication of every act of
my life would not bring a blush to my
brow or cause my husband, son or sis
ter to feel the slightest sense of shame.
"Mr. Dunning's story of our lirst meet
ing and subsequent acquaintanceship,
which was telegraphed from Dover, is
true in every particular.
"When the Examiner reporter inter
viewed me last week my husband was
present, and I asked him to state to the
reporter the reasons for our living apart.
He did so, but his words wÂ»re never print
ed. I have been a dutiful wife and
mother, notwithstanding the domestic
differences between myself and husband.
In previous interviews I did not mention
the name of Mrs. Arbogast. and I only re
ferred to Mrs. Corbaley as a very dear
friend of the Dunnings. I accused no ono
of murdering those two unfortunate, un
suspecting women. To even breathe a
Bucpicion gainst any one Is too deadly
an accusation; too monstrous to utter.
All I ask is fair treatment, with no misrep
resentation, no misinterpretations of my
wnrds. Suppose you reverse the circum
stances. Presume for a moment that I
had been poisoned in the same manner as
Mrs. Dunningâ would It be reasonable to
accuse her of the terrible crime?"
Mr. Botkin added a supplemental state
ment to that of his wife, saying:
"I know my wife is innocent of any
crime or any wrong doing. She is in
capable of committing the atrocious mur
der of two Innocent women, neither of
whom she knew. I ha\ r e endeavored to
prevent my wife being interviewed, and
It was only on the assurance of receiving
fair, unprejudiced treatment that I con
sented to-night."
Mrs. Botkin is about 45 years old, with
black hair, short and quite stout. She
talked very rapidly and nervously while
giving her statement for publication. She
rooked to and fro in her chair and fanned
herself Incessantly. She spoke without
hesitation or restraint and appeared anx
ious to give every minute detail which
would in any manner serve to extricate
her from the unenviable position In which
she is now placed. Her references to
Dunning were all in the kindliest tones,
and she seemed to sincerely sympathize
with him in his great distress ar'd sorrow.
Neither Chief of Police 1. D. Gall nor
Sheriff Tom Cunningham have received
any request to detain Mrs. Botkin. She
will not be able to leave the city unob
served, however.

DUNNING OPENS UP.
He Aids the Eastern Authorities to
Trace the Murderer.
DOVER. Del., Aug. 22.â The very latest
developments of the Dover poisoning- case
practically remove the venue from this
locality. By an early train this morning
Attorney General White, his deputy. Peter
Cooper Jr., and State Detectives McVey
and Witzil, arrived here from Wilmington
and before long the town was agog with
the news that John P. Dunning was in
close conference with them at the Capitol
House. Dunnlng's uncle, who has been
here since Saturday, It is said, endeavor
ing to get him to say something definite
about his escapades In San Francisco,
and J. Deane. Dunning's brother-in-law,
expressed great indignation at various ac
counts in the newspapers regarding the
affair, but everybody had to admit that
until Dunning chooses to clear himself he
w:js laying himself open to serious impu
tations.
Dunning, when he came away and walk
; ed across the green to the office of his
friend. Mr. Smithers, a lawyer, said that
â he had been advised to say absolutely
! nothing of what had taken place, but ac
i knowledged that he had given the Attor
| ney General a full account of his doings
: in San Francisco, and that he had done
i all he could to assist in the capture of the
! person who sent the poisoned chocolates
to Mrs. Dunning.
Attorney General White himself would
I say nothing, but Mr. Cooper said It had
â  been definitely decided not to hold a post
| mortem examination of the bodies of
I Mrs. Deane and Mrs. Dunning, as it was
not thought necessary.
The two detectives were equally un
communicative, but McVey carried away
with him from the Pennington house a
I square parcel, wrapped in newspapers,
j which looked suspiciously like the box
containing the poisoned candles, and Dep
uty Cooper had a roll of telegrams, be
lieved to be connected with the case,
which would go to snow that the author
ities In Wilmington had not been idle in
the matter. The State officials return-
THE SA^ FRAKCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 23, 1898.
Ed to Wilmington at 4 o'clock, and John
P. Dunning left for ..ew York later.
Further unraveling of the case will thus
apparently have to come from San Fran
cisco, where it seems pretty evident will
be found the person who sent the pois
oned candy.
In the Wilmington afternoon paper a
telegram from San Francisco states that
Mrs. Forcade and her daughter. Dollie,
who are indirectly charged by Mrs. Bot
kln with having sent anonymous letters
to Mrs. Dunning, stoutly deny having had
any hand in the matter whatever. As
he was ge-tting on the train Mr. Dun
ning was shown the dispatch, but he said
he knew nothing about such a person in
this regard.
ARRESTS EXPECTED.
Local Developments Tend to Impli-
cate at Least Two Women.
There is a strong probability that ar
rests will speedily be made of two
women suspected of complicity In the
poisoning of Mrs. John P. Dunning and
Mrs. Joshua R. Deane in Dover, Del.
The police authorities there are out
spoken as to their belief that the
poisoned candy came from San Fran
cisco. In support of their accusation
against certain women, growing out of
late information gained frum Dunning,
the Dover authorities yesterday sent
telegrams to Chief of Police Lees "in
this city, asking him to take imme
diate steps to secure the arrest of the
suspects. The Chief declined to state
what he was doing, but allowed the in
ference that he was proceeding with all
possible dispatch to compass the cap
ture of the persons wanted.
The fact that Mrs. W. A. Botkin and
Mrs. Seeley have figured so conspicu
ously in the affairs of Mr. Dunning has
led to many surmises as to the cause
of their violent quarrel last year, after
months of cordial intercourse. Mrs. fo.
M. Moore, whose statements concern
ing this quarrel, published in The
Call yesterday, attracted much atten
tion, declares that after the quarrel
Mrs. Botkin expressed to her the most
bitter feeling of hostility toward Mrs.
Seeley. Whether the quarrel was crver
Dunning or originated from some other
cause Mrs. Moore was unable to ascer
tain from either of the principals.
The point is becoming well estab
lished that Dunning paid very little at
tention to any women in San Fran
cisco, except Mrs. Botkin and Mrs.
Seeley. No motive for jealousy of Mrs.
Dunning on the part of any other
woman can be found.
The following dispatch received from
Dover last night is significant of com
ing developments:
DOVER Del., Aug. 22.â The similarity be
tween the handwriting of Mrs. Botkin and
that of the note found in the box of poisoned
candy ha* been the occasion of much comment
here. Dunning has several letters written by
Mrs. Ilotkin to him. and these have been the
subject of close scrutiny. There have, as a
result, been numerous consultations to-day be
tween Dunning, ex-Congressman Pennington
and the police, and several telegrams have been
dispatched to police authorities in the State of
California urging that arrests be made pend
ing the receipt of requisition papers from the
Governor of Delaware. The identity of the
persons sought to be arrested is not openly
announced, but the truth Is scarcely concealed.
Attorney General White said that he was satis
fied that the persons who sÂ«>nt the box of candy

MRS. QUACKENBUSH
HAS A STRONG C/(SE
MANY WITNESSES SUPPORT HER
ALLEGATIONS.
Seeks to Set Aside Deeds to Valuable
Property â Nancy Abbott's Suit
Against Thomas M. Quack
enbush Recalled.
The fight for the fortune of the dead
I capitalist, Thomas M. Quackenbush, was
opened before Judge Seawell yesterday
! morning. Carlotta Quackenhush, who
| claims to be the widow of the deceased,
seeks to set aside deeds to $370,000 worth
of real estate, which the wealthy . car
penter executed in favor of his daughter,
Esther E. Swortfiguer. The present ac
tion recalls the suit brought by Mrs.
Nancy A. Abbott, who endeavored to have
the courts establish her alleged marriage
|to Quackenbush. The suit was a bitter
I one, but Mrs. Abbott was defeated. In
order to prevent a satisfaction of Judg
ment, in event one was found against
him in favor of Mrs. Abbott, Quacken
bush deeded his property to his daughter,
â¢ and, when he died in March of last year,
a will was found in which the entire es
| tate was bequeathed to the daughter, who
! held the deeds.
Mrs. Quackenbush alleges that she mar
ried the deceased- capitalist in December,
1566, and lived with him until 1879, when
they separated. During their married life
Quackenbush accumulated his entire for-
I tune, she alleges, and in conserjue:iee. she
Is entitled to one-half of it. She Is repre
sented by Denson, Oatman & Denson;
and W. W. Foote is caring for the In
terests of Mrs. Swortfiguer. : -
Many witnesses were called during the
day's proceedings, among them Thomas
Haskins. Charles Daley, C. J. Rlley. E.
Frank. John Peck. Philip Werner, Mrs.
Alice Sellick and Mrs. Annie Baungard.
All â  testified that they had- known Mrs.
j Quackenbush when she was living with
i the deceased and all were of the opinion
that she was his wife. â¢â  Mrs. Quacken
bush appears to have a strong case, and
it will certainly take a mass of evidence,
coupled with many surprises, to break
down the showing made yesterday.

THAT GARBAGE CREMATORY.
I Suit to Close It Up Filed by the
People.
Through a suit filed yesterday by The
; People of the State of California, upon
the complaint of Guiseppe Figoni, a seav
; enger by occupation, the Sanitary Reduc
! tlon AVorks of San Francisco may be de-
I prived of its present right to cremate
! garbage, refuse and a large portion of the
I Examiner's circulation. The plaintiff al
leges that F. E. Sharon, who later merged
hiK Interests in the defendant corporation,
, was illegally awarded the contract to
j cremate the city's refuse by reason that
Ihe was not the highest bidder for the
| franchise. It is also claimed that the de
' fendant has violated the ordinance
through which it was created and con
trary to a certain action providing that
| but 20 cents a load, such load not exceed
! ing a cubic yard, should be changed for
cremation, the defendant has charged and
collected from all persons delivering
garbage for reduction from 25 to 30 cents
! a cubic yard. In consequence the plain
! tiff asks" that the defendant be adjudged
Ito usurp and unlawfully exercise the
rights granted by the ordinance and that
j the company be enjoined from further ex
! ercislng such rights, and that the fran
chise given it be declared void and for
feited. Attorney General Fitzgerald, Gar
i ret McEnerney and Page, McOutchen and
K<i!s appear as attorneys for the plain
i tiff.
THE WEALTHY VAGRANT.
Peter Cunningham Sentenced to Six
Months in the County Jail.
Peter Cunningham, the wealthy old
miser who was convicted by Judge Con
lan Saturday on the charge of va
grancy, appeared for sentence yesterday
morning. The Judge, after severely com
menting upon the old man's habits of
gathering meat and bread from swill bar
rels, sentenced him to six months in the
County Jail. The sentence is the limit.
Cunningham had been standing during
the Judge's remarks, and when he heard
the sentence he dropped into a chair as
if he had been struck by lightning. His
attorney gave notice of appeal, and the
Judge took the matter of bonds under
advisemenr.
Died at His Work.
David Attwater, who for the past forty
flve years has been employed as engineer
at the National Flour Mills, Battery and
Pacific streets, died suddenly yesterday
morning, of heart disease. The mills shut
down Saturday night for a few days in
order that the machinery might be over
hauled, and Attwater climbed to the top
of the boiler to open the manhole. He
â was found shortly afterward lying dead
on the floor. He was 60 years of age and
lived with his family In Aiamcda.
DEATH AT
BADEN BY
MALPRACTICE
Freida Maier Victim
of Dora Fuhrig.
TRAGEDY IN A HUMBLE HOME
ARREST OF WOMAN CHARGED
WITH THE CRIME,
Evidence Before a Coroner's Jury
That the Dead Woman Admitted
Having Visited the
Physician.
Mrs. Dora Fuhrlg wa? arrested at her
home, IM6 Howard street, last night by
Detective Cody, acting under instruction
of Captain Bowen, and locked In the City
Prison, charged with murder. Her arroat
and the charge against her were the out
come of a performance of a criminal ope
ration U"on Mrs. Freida Maier, wife of
William Maier of Baden.
Mrs. Maier, a German by birth, and 2S
years old, died on Sunday afternoon last,
at her home in Baden. On August 13 she
made, a statement to her husband and to
Mr. Jepson, the husband of the nurse who
attended her In the fatal illness. The
statement recites that on the 19th day of
July of the present year an operation was
performed on her, in which instruments
were used, by Mrs. Dora Fuhrig of 1846
Howard street, San Francisco.
Justice of the Peace E. E. Cunningham,
acting Coroner at Baden, heard evidence
yesterday afternoon and submitted the
case to the following-named Jurors: Her
man Karbe. H. I. Vandenbos, W. S. Tay
lor, J. L. Wood, Richard Harder, I. Eiker
en Kotter, J. Jorgensen, who found a ver
dict reciting that Mrs. Maier came to her
death from blood poisoning, caused by a
criminal operation performed uy Mrs.
Dora Fuhrig on or about the 19th day of
July last.
Mrs. Bessie Jepson. a practical mid
wife, resident of Baden, told the Coro
ner's fury that she was called to attend
Mrs. Maier on August 13, and when she
had discovered the real cause of illness
informed her patient that she would do
nothing for her until she had told all the
facts relative to her Illness. It was this
positive stand taken by Mrs. Jepson that
brought out the ante-mortem statement.
Mrs. Jepson then called Dr. Thresher
of San Francisco, who upon examination
corroborated the midwife's opinion as to
the cause of Mrs. Maier's illness. Dr.
Thresher and Mrs. Jepson attended the
woman until her death, doing all possi
ble to save her. Dr. Mish of this city
assisted Dr. Thresher in a post mortem
examination, and both gave evidence be
fore the jury.
William Maier and his wife Freida and
their infant son of 2 years came to Ba
den from Eureka, Humboldt County,
early in July, and remained in San Fran
cisco until two weeks ago, when Mr.
Maier found work at the Western Meal
Company's establishment. Mr. Maier
says that he had not the slightest Idea of
his wife's intention when she consulted
"Dr." Fuhrig. but was deceived by her
statement that her illness was only ordi-
nary.
Mrs. Maier was a handsome woman,
light of complexion and happy of tem
perament, and one who would not be ex
pected to risk her life in such a manner.
Dora Fuhrig refused to make a detailed
'.tatement, but she admitted to Detec
â¢lvc Cody that Mrs. Maier had visited
her on two occasions. She denied
using an instrument in her treatment of
her patient.
Not Dishonest, but Hungry.
Several days ago August Wardiken of
551Â»4 Postoffice alley obtained half a ham,
a roll of butter and some sausage from
Schnatzler & Fox's grocery store on a
forged order, for which he was arrested.
Officer McMurry of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children investi
gated the case and found that the family
was almost starving, and three little chil
dren, thÂ« eldest of which had been sick.
were In a pitiful condition for the want of
food. The man and his wife are hard
working people. She told her story to a
priest, who gave her $3. which she at once
offered to the grocers in payment for the
food her husband had obtained dishonest
ly, but they refused to be lenient with the
offender. The Associated Charities has
taken up the case and an effort will be
made to have it dismissed.
Waller Did Not Prosecute.
The charge of assault preferred by
School Director Waller against E. C. Kll
patrlek, ex-principal of the Evening
Business School, was dismissed by Judge
Mi 'Kan yesterday. Waller failed to ap
pear in court to prosecute the case.
Robbed an Office.
Dr. G. 13. Williamson of the Board of
Health swore to a complaint In Judge
Mogan's court yesterday for the arrest of
T. E. Strong on a charge of petty larceny.
Dr. Williamson alleges that Strong on
Sunday stole from his office in the Flood
building surgical instruments of the value
of $30.
Warning to Fish-Dealers.
Two Chinese were each lined $20 by

A SCENE IN AN IRISH HOME.
NOTED MEN
ARRIVE ON
THE BELGIC
Chaplain Frazier of the
Olympia on Board.
IS HERE ON A FURLOUGH
U. S. MINISTER DENBY HOME
FROM THE ORIENT.
Has Represented America in China
for Thirteen Years â Editor
Schweitzer Bound tor
liisbon.
The Occidental and Oriental Steamship
Company's Belgic from Hongkong via Yo
kohama and Honolulu reached* port last
evening, and after landing the steerage
passengers at the quarantine station suc
ceeded in docking at the Pacific Mail
wharf. Owing to darkness and the tide
it took nearly an hour to make a land
ing.
The vessel had a large passenger list
which included a number of prominent
people. Chaplain J. B. Frazier of the
flagship Olympia was one of the passen
gers. He was detached from duty on
July 18, and since that time has been in
Yokohama. After spending a few days
in the city visiting a younger brother who
enlisted in the Tennessee regiment he will
go to his home in Knoxvilie to spend a
two months' furlough with his parents.
"If the war is really over," said the
chaplain, "1 shall remain till the last of
October, but in case hostilities, are re
newed I will return to my post. The
health of the men in the fleet has been
exceptionally good and almost borders on
the miraculous, as was our victory with
out loss of life or injury to the crews.
There have been but two deaths in the
entire fleet. One of these was a Japan
ese sailor, who contracted fever, and the
other was Bugler McSweeney of the
Brooklyn, who died from drinking impure
water while off the whip.
"The fact that no one on the ships was
killed in the bombardment of Manila was
a cause for great rejoicing. While there
was no fear that the batteries on shore
could stand before our guns, still a num
ber of the commanders were fearful Â»est
there might be some fatalities. The only
relic I have saved from the battle is a
Spanish sword, which I picked up in Ma
nila, and this, of course, I prize very
highly. The stories in regard to my hav
ing been nearly shot were greatly exag
gerated. During the battle I was assist
ing the doctor in the ward room, and at
one time when I had my head out of a
port hole a six-pound shell came a trifle
too close for comfort, but then a miss is
as good as a mile.
Charles Denby, who has been I nlted
States Minister to China for the last thir
teen years, arrived on the Belgic and is
now at the Palace. President Clevland
appointed him to the exalted position dur
ing his first administration, on the 29th
of May, ISRS. and he has held office unin
terruptedly since then. He will be suc
ceeded by H. E. Conger of lowa, who was
Minister to Brazil under President Har-
Mr. Denby is a man of commanding
presence and looked the picture of health
after his long sea voyage. "Do not ask
me " he said, "to say anything about the
Philippines. I must positively remain
mute about the question. I am glad that
we have annexed Hawaii. I am on my
way to Washington to make my final re
port to the. Government, and it would not
be proper for me to express any opinion
about its course in that regard. I was in
your fair city in 1894 for just two days,
having been granted an indefinite leave
of absence. But war having broken out
between China and Japan, I was hurried
ly called to Washington for the purpose
of ratifying a treaty between the latter
Government and China. After four weeks
I returned to China and inaugurated pro
ceedings of peace for that country. As
to affairs in the Orient I have nothing to
say for the reason that a Government
officer must, of necessity, be silent on
questions of state, and 1 am subject to
the orders of this nation until I am re
leased from the obligation by the proper
authorities, whtch will be when I rÂ«ieh
Washington. I intend after that to re
turn to my home in Evansville, Tnd., and
lead a quiet existence, free from the tram
mels of public life. We reached Hono
lulu after the raising of the flag over the
islands, hut during my short stay there
I had a very pleasant interview with Mr.
Sewall."
Among the passengers was George
Schweitzer, the owner of the Frankfurter
Zeitung and Acteonaer, papers published
in Berlin. Mr. Schweitzer has been mak
ing a tour of the world and is now on his
way to IJsbon to attend the International
Congress, which convenes there in Sep
tember. During his visit to the United
States some time ago he collected notes
for a book, "Auf Urlaub In America,"
which will appear soon.
Captain Kinder reports an uneventful
voyage, with fair weather all the way
over. The run was made from Hongkong
in twenty-seven days, eighteen hours and
seventeen minutes. The troopship Charles
Nelson reached Honolulu on Sunday, Au
gust 14. but the Lackme had not arrived
when the Belgic left, though she was
expected on the following dayâ August 17.
The Belgic brought over 609 steerage pas
sengers.

REMINDERS OE
OLD IRELAND
AT THE FAIR
Treading the Soil of
the Emerald Isle,
VERY ATTRACTIVE FEATURE
FISHING IN THE LAKES OF
KILLARNEY.
A Visit to Blarney Castle and Tara
Hall â Dewey Cup to Be Voted
to the Most Popoular
Young Lady.
The attractions at thf> Irish Fair are. to
use a stereotyped expression, "too numer
ous to mention." To thoroughly appreci
ate the extent and variety of the enter
tainment afforded at the Mechanics' Pa
vilion, hours and hours must be spent
there. In addition to the numerous
booths and displays illustrative of scenes,
Incidents, customs and industries of the
Emerald Isle, many of the prominent
merchants and manufacturers of San
Francisco have made some very attrac
tive trade exhibits, which In themselves
form quite an industrial exposition.
There is no end of amusement at the
fair. The beautiful lakes of Killarney
are faithfully reproduced, and every one
catching a fish, sufficiently magnetized
to cling to the hook, is rewarded with a
prize. In a small theater performances
are given every twenty minutes, and this
evening an art collection containing quite
a number of famous pictures will be on
exhibition, under the supervision of Mrs.
Ann McClo.sky.
The map of Ireland, correctly laid out in
counties, and constructed of soil brought
from the' "dear old country" especially
for this purpose, affords an opportunity
to every Irishman to visit his native land
in a few minutes and at small expense.
This map is proving a very popular fea
ture, not only to Irishmen, but to every
one else visiting the fair. Another tender
reminder of the old country is a faithful
fac-simile of Blarney Castle. Tara Hall,
correctly reproduced, is also a grand at
traction.
America booth, a beautiful pavilion in
the center of the great hall, is handsome
ly decorated and electrically illuminated
in red, white and blue, the effect being
most brilliant. At the souvenir spoon
booth, presided over by Mrs. Laidlaw, a
vote is being taken to'declde who is the â â 
most popular young la<ly. everybody buy- j
ing a spoon is entitled to a vote. Of
course, the shamrock spoon is the favo
Ite. The winner will be presented wit
the Dewey Cup. an artistic piece of silvi

ship that rescued the Irish exiles fro
Western Australia in IS7C. In the sam
booth there is a fac-simile of the heart o
Brian Boru, reproduced from the origina
in the Dublin Museum by C.
Baron, a well-known Irish art's
Here are displayed three eel
brated pictures in silk, arrange
by Miss L. Gavin of this city. They ar
entitled "Erin-go-bragh," "United Ire
land" and "Sailor's Farewell." There
also in this booth a copy in silk of the
flag of the Sixty-ninth New York, known
as the Irish regiment, together with pic
tures of the Irish generals, Jackson, Sul
livan, Barry. Fitzgerald and Montgomery;
a sword that was captured at the battle
of Ridgway, in Canada, by Major Canty;
two pikes used in the war of '9K; a pic
ture of Blarney Castle painted by Volney,
and a celebrated painting by Terence Be -
lew McManus, who died in San Fran
Cisco.
To many people one of the most int<>r
esting things to be seen at the fair 1
a silk mill weaving various artistic de
signs. This evening there will be pre
sented a scene in an Irish house, the fur
niture being loaned by C. P. Wilcomb
curator of the Golden Gate Park museum
The Japanese booth attracts a great dea
of attention. Then there are the refresh
ment stands, the music, the variou
games and amusements of all kinds
which, taken with the other features
make up an evening of the most pleasin
variety.
The attendance is large and every on
seems to enjoy the fair, which evident]
Is bound to prove a success in every wa>
Special days are arranged for, on whic 1
occasions the Immense hall is sure to be
crowded to its utmost capacity. Excur
sion trains from the interior towns will
bring to the city many thousands of vis
itors, who will be rewarded with a day of
rare enjoyment.
