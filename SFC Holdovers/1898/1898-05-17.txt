MERRITT
IN OPEN
REBELLION
Declines to Go to the Phil
ippines With the Force
Proposed.
He Declares More Trained Regu
lars Are Required to Capture
and Hold the Islands.
NEW YORK, May 16.â Major-
General Wesley Merritt, who has
been selected by the Government
to command the expedition about
to be sent to the Philippines with
the purpose of completing the work
begun by Rear-Admiral Dewey,
and to administer the affairs of the
islands as Governor-General, has
refused point blank to go with the
troops which have been selected
for the task of driving the Span
iards out of the archipelago, and
who are expected to maintain order
afterward.
It is therefore a question whether
the W r ar Department will alter its
plans or not. Should the present
arrangement of sending 15,000
men, only 1000 of whom are regu
lars, be adhered to, I am in a posi
tion to state that General Merritt
will not be their commander. Hv
has given the matter serious stuJy
since the official announcement
was 'made that he had been chosen
for duty in the Far East, and what
may be considered his ultimatum
will be presented to Secretary
Alger by Colonel Robert F,
Hughes, Inspector - General on
General Merritt's staff, who left
this city on the midnight train for
Washington.
It has been an open secret on
Governors Island for days that
General Merritt does not relish the
job of taking the Philippines. He
was supposed to be desirous of
commanding the army of invasion
in Cuba, or even one that may be
sent to Porto Rico. His rank, his
experience and his knowledge of
tactics were such that military
men said at the beginning of the
war that he would naturally re-
ceive the most important command
in the field. Other considerations,
' however, have prevented the
naming of General Merritt for the
command of the troops massed at
Tampa or about to be mobilized at
Chickamauga. Gerieral Merritt
remained in charge of the Depart
ment of the East, while Generals
Wade, Shafter and Book were
sent to the front, and in the De
partment of the East General Mer
ritt is likely to remain for some
time to come unless the policy that
has been pursued at Washington
since the opening of hostilities is
changed.
General Merritt, at his head
quarters on Governors Island, was
seen to-day and asked when he
expected to start for Manila. He
replied: "It is not settled yet
whether lam to go. I have asked
the department to furnish a suffi
cient force of trained and disci
plined troops. 1 would not care to
go with a force of 15,000 men,
only 1000 of whom are regulars
and the others volunteers from
the militia of the Northwest. Gen
eral Otis may be willing to go Â«vith
less force, but 1 am not. The
command they propose to give me
is not adequate to my rank. It is
all very well for them to say that
additional troops will be sent later
if they are needed, but the history
of all such expeditions is that after
you get away these promises are
not kept. The only way is to fur
The San Francisco Call
nis troops that are needed at the
start, and from what I can learn
of the situation in the Philippines
we should have at least 5000
trained men, as there may be no
time to discipline and train recruits
after we get there. 1 shall remain
right here until I learn just what
the department is willing to do.
My successor here has not been
appointed, and 1 do not propose he
shall be until this matter is set
tled."
DICKINSON NOT
TO_BE HONORED.
WASHINGTON, May 16.â The briga
diership is still an interesting topic of
discussion here, and hundreds of tele
grams are pouring In daily. If any Cali
fornian is appointed to command a bri
gade it will be Colonel H. G. Otis of Los
Angeles. This is well understood in the
California delegation to-night. General
Dickinson has now been endorsed by
the Democrats and Populists, Maguire,
De Vries, Barlow and Castle. Perkins,
Barham and I^oud have called on the
President to present numerous peti
tions in Dlcki. son's favor, although
Senator Perkins is on record as having
endorsed Colonel Otis. So is White.
The President sent for General Gra
ham of the regular army to-day, ques-
tioned him about General Dickinson's
fitness to command a brigade, and in
quired especially about his military
conduct during the Debs strikes and
riots. General Graham was stationed
at the Presidio at that time, and knnw
! ing this the Prt'Pid^nt availed himself
I of General Graham's presence in Wash-
I ington to ascertain whether there was
I any truth in the reports derogatory to
General Dlcki:. son's conduct at that
time. General Graham's reply, if pub
lished, would not be relished by Mr.
Dickinson. It is even gossiped among

CHASE OF SPAIN'S
VESSELS IN THE
CARIBBEAN SEA
NEW YORK, May 16.â The
Herald's Washington correspond
ent telegraphs: Spain's fleet in
the Caribbean Sea is to be met by
a squadron consisting of the armor
clads of the United Slates in the
North Atlantic waters. This
seems to be the intention to-night
iof the Naval War Board, and
preparations are being made to
effect a junction of Rear Admiral
! Sampson's fleet and the flying
| squadron, under command of Com
i modore Schley, with all possible
dispatch.
If necessary Commodore Schley,
according to one official with whom
I 1 talked to-day, will join Rear
; Admiral Sampson on the south
; coast of Cuba, in order that the
I southwestern section of the Amer
! ican blockading squadron may be
protected and to place the Ameri
j can force in a strategic position to
i attack the Spanish fleet at what
1 ever point it may appear. It is
at the quartermaster-general's office
that the City of Peking with over 1000
men aboard will leave San Francisco
on Thursday for the Philippines. Brig
adier-General Otis is expected to go
with the first detachment of troops for
the Philippines to be followed later by
General Merritt. who is to be the com
mander-in-chief of the expedition and
the Military Governor of the islands.
General Miles has recommended to the
President that V additional brigadiers
will also be sent, but their names have
not been announced.
CRUISERS NEEDED
FURTHER SOUTH.
WASHINGTON, May 16.â Senator
Gray arid other influential men have
! made strong protests against the
â  cruiser Columbia and other fine war-
I ships being: kept on the New England
'â¢ coast, when the enemy's ships are in
' southern waters. Senator Gray had
; business with the President to-day and
called his attention to the matter.
"It is stated that these ships are kept
on the New England coast to allay ap
prehension," said Senator Gray. "Well,
that is all foolishness. Here those ships
are kept on this coast when there is
not a particle of danger, while the
not necessary, nor would it be
good policy, to attach the monitors
to the combined fleet, and the
probabilities are that these vessels
will be stationed in front of Ha
vana or at Southern ports for their
protection in case the Spanish
squadron should attempt to bom
bard any coast city.
With such a squadron as the
officials contemplate forming the
enemy's fleet, if met in battle,
will, it is confidently believed, be
totally crushed.
Rear Adnvral Sampson will have
under his command, it is expected,
the battle-ships lowa, Indiana and
Massachusetts, the second-class
battle-ship Texas and the armored
cruisers Brooklyn and New York.
Handicapped as Rear Admiral
Sampson now is by monitors, his
speed is not more than eight or
nine knots. For the reason that
the fleet's speed is the speed of
the slowest vessels the Terror and
Amphitrite are being towed, be
Spanish squadron is not far from
southern waters. 1 do not believe
anybody has any idea that the Spanish
fleet would attempt to sail 3000 or 4000
miles from its present position to at
tack New England, and be without a
base of supplies when it got there.
While our ships remain on the New
England coast, the southern coast,
much nearer to the Spaniards, is un
protected. So is the coast of the mid
dle Atlantic States. Our ships should
be with one or the other squadrons."
It is said that several other New
England Senators take the same ground
as Senator Gray.
sides endeavoring to hasten their
voyage by proceeding under their
own steam.
With no monitors on his fleet
Rear Admiral Sampson will be able
to steam at a rate of twelve knots
an hour and keep his squadron well
together, and under forced draught
may be able to reach fifteen knots.
The New York and Brooklyn, with
the auxiliary steamers and torpedo
boats which will be attached to
his force, will be able to speed at
such a rate as to be able to over
haul the Spanish armored cruisers
and hold them engaged until the
Texas, followed by heavier ships
of the line, come to their support.
If the Spanish fleet is coaling, as
is believed, then the operations of
the board can be completed without
undue haste, and the combined
armor-clad squadron can be sta
tioned at a strategic position to be
selected, from which it will strike
in any direction that the enemy
may make his appearance.
WHERE WILL
CERVERA BE
OVERTAKEN?
Elusive Game of the Span
ish Fleet Puzzling the
War Board.
Blanco Needs Ammunition and the
Enemy's Ships May Be Encoun
tered Trying to Run the
Blockade.
Call Office, Biggs House,
Washington, May 16.
While a hundred minor details in
the campaign against Spain occupy
the time of army and navy officials
one question continues to overshadow
all others. Where will Sampson find
the Spanish fleet, assuming that the
Spanish admiral does not avoid an
encounter by running away? Opin
ion is crystallizing that the greatest
naval battle of the war will be fought
in the neighborhood of Havana, and
in support of this theory a number
of considerations are advanced.
Chief among these is the entirely re
liable information received by the
Navy Department several days ago
that the Spanish ministry promised
Blanco, at the time the blockade of
Havana was proclaimed, that a fleet
would be sent to raise it and to rl
lieve the beleaguered* city.
While a dozen conflicting reports
have since been current regarding the
movements of the Spanish vessels,
the Navy Department now realizes
that they were dispatched to Cuban
waters at the time the promise was
cabled to Blanco, and it is also ap
parent that the Governor General of
Cuba confidently looks forward to
their arrival. Press advices from
Havana received to-day emphasize
this expectation, saying that the
stock of shot and shell for coast de
fense has been greatly depleted in
the effort to prevent the landing of
parties from the American ships and
in replying to the bombardment by
the United States warships of the
shore batteries. Admiral Cervera is
said to have a large supply of am
munition for these batteries.
Three important announcements
were made to-day under circumstances
which introduce an element of sus
picion in each case. Admiral Samp
son's destination was officially given
as Cienfuegos, the Spanish fleet was
said to have left Willemstad, Cura
coa, for Western Cuba, and the ap
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
pearance of a second Spanish squad
ron off Martinique was announced.
Whether Sampson has actually
cabled the department that he is
steaming for Cienfuegos, or whether
the report originates with Secretary
Long and his aids, it is suspected
that the strategy board has taken a
leaf out of Spain's book, and here
after may be expected to publish mis
leading statements regarding the
whereabouts of American vessels. It
seems hardly reasonable to suppose
that the Secretary of the Navy in one
breath would declare that no more
information -would be given out re-
garding the movements of the Amer
ican fleets, and in the next would
proceed to locate Sampson's destina
tion for the benefit of the Spanish
admiral.
While it is quite possible that the
Spanish fleet has left Willerastad, it
is more than likely that it is still in
the immediate vicinity of Curacoa.
The Navy Department has reliable
advices, received through commercial
resources, to the effect that the Span
ish fleet has met several colliers near
Willemstad and has filled the bunk
ers of every ship, after having taken
in port all the coal the strict observ
ance of neutrality would permit the
harbor authorities to supply.
In this connection Secretary Day
had a long conference to-day with
Mr. DeWeckherlin, the Netherlands
Minister, in the course of which the
latter gave the most satisfactory as
surances that at no time would the
Spanish vessels be permitted to ob
tain contraband of war at Dutch
ports in the West Indies or else
where.
The report that a second Spanish
fleet has been sighted off Martinique
is set down at the Havy Department
as a canard. Its evident purpose is
to distract attention from the squad
ron in the Caribbean Sea and to
cause the Itfavy Department to divide
its forces in order to meet two fleets
instead of one. If this is the real
purpose the device has already failed.
Another grave problem confront
ing the administration is the starting
of the expedition to the Philippines.
The departure of the first vessel has
been postponed from day to day, and
although it is now officially given out
that the City of Peking and the City
of Sydney will start from San Fran
cisco on Thursday with about 3000
men, it would not be surprising
should there be further delay. The
War Department is solely responsible
for this procrastination, which has
demonstrated graphically how poorly
prepared this Government has been
to cope with even a fourth-class Eu
ropean power. It is hoped b"y army
and navy officials to have the Aus
tralia and Centennial follow soon af
terward, the latter vessel to sail di
rect from Seattle.
It is estimated that 5200 men can
be conveyed to Manila on these four
transports. Orders have been sent to
Mare Island to hurry the Philadel
phia, but it is not believed that she
will be ready in time to act as con
voy for any of the troop ships. She
will, however, be sent to join Dewey's
squadron as soon as she is put in
commission. The Philadelphia will
be commanded by Captain Frederick
Rodgers.
The Philadelphia Press, owned and
edited by Charles Emory Smith, the
new Postmaster General, prints the
following inspired editorial on the
subject of holding the Philippine
Islands, and it is regarded as sig
nificant, coming as it does from a
member of the Cabinet:
â¢'The United States will keep the
islands until it sees something bet
ter to do with them. This is the
national policy on which President
McKinley is acting, and it is the only
one on which either he or the nation
can act. As an act of war our fleet
has captured the harbor of Knnila,
and in a few weeks more our troops
will have completed the occupation
of Manila and the conquest of the
islands. The national duty is clear
as to these points. General Merritt
is as competent to act as military
governor of Manila as any one of
the scores of English generals put in
like position. An American force is
just as competent as an English force
of the same size to occupy and pacify
the islands and their nine million in
habitants. Be American! Have con
fidence in Americans! The Philip2
PROTEST AGAINST
DEWEY'S CONQUEST
LONDON, May 17.â A dispatch to the Boily Telegraph from St.
Petersburg says:
Japan intends to protest vigorously against America seizing the
Philippines. She has already sought the assistance of Russia, and
conferences are occurring between Count Muravieff, the Russian For
eign Minister, and the Japanese Embassador, Baron Hayashi Tada
sou. It is believed that France and Germany will support Japan.
pines cannot go back to Spain. Per
ish the man who would dare suggest
that these islands should be given
back to the corrupt and cruel tyran
ny from which Dewey's guns freed
them."
There is much dissatisfaction ex
pressed with the work of the Naval
War Board. It is considered prob
able that some radical change may
ue made in the personnel and meth
ods of the board within a short time.
Naval officers say that mistakes have
been made, and that apparently noth
ing is accomplished by the navy in
Cuban waters. Meanwhile the army
is waiting for the navy and is idle
also. The campaign for the freedom
of Cuba is at a standstill. If the
report is true that three more Span
ish warships are in the West Indies,
it is only another of the many recent
proofs of the superior strategical
ability of the Spaniards.
From, the beginning Spain has
kept this country in the dark as to
her moves, and appeared suddenly in
unexpected places to the overthrow
of the plans on this side. The Unit
ed States, on the other hand, has not
been able to keep secret any of its
oampaign, good or bad. Captain
Crowninshield, chief of the Bureau
of Navigation, is a member of the
Naval Board. He is physically unfit
for the performance of this important
duty, and it is suggested that if his
place were filled by Admiral Walker
there would be a marked improve
ment in its work, for he is a practical
commander, a sea ciog.
The opening of the blockade at
Havana to certain vessels is a rather
curious proceeding that may lead to
a very considerable widening of the
blockade itself, so that in the end
neutral vessels not loaded with con
traband or supplies the carrying of
which into Havana would interfere
with the naval and military opera
tions, may be allowed to enter. The
statement that the Navy Department
still hopes to make an exchange of
prisoners at an early day shows that
the mission of the Uncas yesterday
was by no means a complete failure,
as has been stated.
Intimations have been received
here that Captain General Blanco at
Havana is very short or ammunition,
in which cass the powerful batteries
at the entrance of Havana harbor, of
course, would be deprived of a large
part of their defensive strength.
This state of affairs may lead to some
desperate attempts at blockade run
ning on the part of the Spaniards,
in the hopes of getting more am
munition into Havana. It is be
lieved that the supplies so frequently
referred to as being on the Spanish
flying squadron were of this charac
ter, rather than food supplies, which
makes it all the more important that
Sampson and Schley should succeed
in keeping Admiral Cervera from
reaching Havana from Cienfuegos. or
any port in Cuba connected with Ha-
vana by rail. Commodore ScbJey
probably is well down on the Florida
coast now and should be able to
guard the Florida straits by to-mor
row or next day. His appearance on
that side of Cuba would enable Samp
son to bring his ironclads with per
fect safety into Cienfuegos on the
south side, and with this disposition
of our naval force and the free use
of a considerable number of our
scouting vessels, it is hard to see
how the Spanish fleet can escape from
the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean.
The Navy Department is getting
a better and better quality of armor
as the contracts expire. A thirteen
inch plate tested at Indian Head
Saturday with a ten-inch gun showed
itself to be equal to or superior to
any piece of armor tnat has ever
been made, for. with the highest
velocity, at 1945 feet per second, the
shot penetrated only twelve inches,
without cracking the plate, the very
last piece to be delivered under the
existing contract and which is in
tended for the Kentucky.
The important development of the
day at the War Department was the
definite selection of the corps com
manders. The announcement, how
ever, does not contain any surprises.
Though Major General Wesley Mer
ritt is accredited to the Department
of the Pacific, such designation is
made formally, and it is known that
he will go to the Philippines in com
mand of the army there and will be
accompanied by Major General Otis.
The designation of General Fitzhugh
Lee as commander of the Seventh
Corps, with headquarters at Tampa,
would seem to indicate that he is to
accompany the army of invasion to
Cuba.

TACOMA, May 16.â Hongkong ad
vices per steamer Tacoma state that
famine is spreading in Southern China,
including Hainan Island and parts of
Tonkin and Anam, it being due to short
crops last year and the great rise in the
price of breadstuffs throughout the
Orient.
Inland from Canton families are sell
ing their daughters for bread, all their
other means being exhausted. Chinese
speculators are taking advantage of
their sorry plight by charging enor
mous prices for rice. Hundreds of
cases of actual starvation have oc
curred.
The reports received at Canton from
all parts of the famine district are
equally bad. Grain is' very high priced,
and the Government can afford little
relief until another crop is harvested.
In some districts all seed grain has
been devoured.
Another sharp tight has taken place
between the Japanese troops and For
mosan rebels near Kosan. About
twenty Japanese were killed, including
a paymaster and a quartermaster. Sev
eral scores of the insurgents were slain.
Some of the rebels have obtained rifles
and are becoming expert marksmen.
They are trying to arouse the entire is
land against tlie Japanese rule, and in
so doing are committing many barba
rities. After capturing one small vil
lage recently they beheaded fifteen per
sons whom tl"~ suspected of sympa
thizing with Japan.
Many Japanese soldiers in Formosa
are dying of malaria. Malarial disor
ders are most prevalent in the end of
Formosa which is nearest to the Phil
ippine group. There, according to of
ficial reports, 22 per cent of the Japan
ese troops and civil officers are sick
with malaria. In the central part of
the island the sick list numbers 21 per
cent, and in the northern part 12 per
cent. Navigators say the Philippines
are not so swampy as Formosa, which
fact lessens the sickness in the former
islands.
PHILIPPINE LEADERS
WANT SPAIN'S GOLD.
Legal Contest for a Share of the
Sum Paid by Madrid to Chief
Aguinaldo.
TACOMA, May 16.â Emilio Aguinaldo
and other leaders of the late Philippine
rebellion have fallen out over a division
of the $800,000 which Spain was to pay
as the price of ending the rebellion.
Last December the Spanish Govern
ment sent $400,000 to Hongkong to be di
vided among the leaders of the insurg
ents, and promised $400,000 more for
distribution among the participants in
the rebellion still remaining on the Is
lands.
Among Aguinaldo's associates was
Atachio, who as Minister of the In
terior was one of Aguinaldo's council
of seven, which constituted the Phil-
ippine insurgent Government. Atachio
claims that despite his frequent re
quests for a division of the $400,000
which Aguinaldo received he has been
unable to secure any share of it. Four
weeks ago he brought suit in the Brit
ish court at Hongkong and obtained a
temporary injunction preventing Agui
naldo. together with the Hongkong-
Shanghai Bank Corporation and the
Chartered Bank of India. Australia
and China, from ' parting with the
money. Atachio exhibited letters and
telegrams in support of his claim,
showing that Spain negotiated for sev
eral months before she was able to buy
off the insurgent leaders. After Aguin
aldo and thirty-five others had reached
Hongkong Atachio remained In Man
ila at the risk of his life to surrender
the arms and property of the insurg
ents to General Rivera.
The second payment of $400,000 for
the benefit of the privates in the in
surgent army was never made as
promised, which explains why the in
surgents so quickly renewed their re
bellion against Spanish rule.

WHAT THE
WAR WILL
NOW COST
Allison DeclaresThatNearly
Four Hundred Millions
Are Needed.
Features of the War Revenue
Measure Are Primarily Dis
cussed Before the Senate.
Call Office' Riggs House,
Washington, May 16.
In the Senate to-day Allison of lowa
called up the uar "revenue bill and
made a statement of its features.
Allen said that as the bill came from
the House of Representatives it was an
internal revenue measure, and as re
ported to the Senate it was still an in
ternal revenue measure.' Compara
tively, said he, there are no provisions
in it for increase of customs duties. He
said that the Finance Committee had
carefully examined all of the schedules
i of the House bill and had been led to
! believe that schedules A (stamp taxes)
j and B (proprietary articles) were too
! general in their scope. Consequently
they had been amended. On the beer
and tobacco taxes on schedules A and
B and on the tonnage tax matter, the
committee was substantially a unit.
Allison said further that in the com
i mittee there was no difference of opin
i ion as to the necessity of the bill. It
was purely a war revenue measure.
With a view to ascertaining how much
money would be required to run the
war during the next fiscal year, al
though he expressed the hope that it
would last only a few weeks or months
at most, Allison said that the com
mittee, had obtained the best possible
estimates from the Secretary of War
and the Secretary of the Navy. Secre
tary Alger estimated that his depart
ment would need $i:> 0,925,527. To this
sum must be added at least $15,000,000
to pay expenses authorized by Congress
after the estimate was made.
The estimate of the Secretary of the
Navy of the expenses of his department
for the same period was $75,556,250, but
in addition to this sum the amount
carried by the naval appropriation bill
must be considered as a part of the ex
penses of the navy. In addition to the
$50,000,000 already appropriated as a
war fund, which Allison announced
parenthetically had been practically
expended, the forthcoming general de- j
ficiency bill would carry a deficiency
appropriation for the current year of
about $35,000,000, and there is a naval
deficiency of about $22,275,000.
The Senate Finance Committee
therefore figured that it would require
a total of at least $379,192,000 to pay the
expenses of the war from the present
time until the 1 1st of July, 1899, not tak
ing into account any emergency ex
penses that might arise at any mo
ment-
Allison then carefully analyzed the
ordinary receipts and expenditures of
the Government. In the course of this
statement he expressed the opinion
that the estimate of the Secretary of
the Treasury that the present tariff
bill would this year raise $200,000,000
was too high. In present circum
stances and conditions he doubted
whether the bill would produce more
than $180,000,000. The important question
FOR BATTLESHIPS
AND MONITORS.
Plans of the New Vessels to Be Con
structed Considered by the
Naval Board.
NEW YORK, May 16.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: The Naval
Board of Construction was in session
to-day discussing plans for battle- 1
ships and monitors whose construction
is authorized by recent naval appro
priation bills. A circular giving the
general requirements of battle-ships is
practically ready and does not differ
from the outline recently published.
In accordance with the direction of the
board, plans for monitors are being
prepared under the direction of Chief
Naval Constructor Hichborn. On ac
count of the small appropriation made
by Congress for each of these ves
selsâsl,2so,oooâ it has been determined
to limit their size to 2500 tons displace
ment and to supply each ship with
only one turret, to be piaced in the
forward part of the vessel. It has not
yet been definitely decided whether to
equip them with two 12-inch or two 10
inch breech-loading rifles.
The superstructure of the vessels
will be constructed so as to reach from
the turret nearly to the stern of the
ship, and rapid-fire guns will be placed
on this to be directed against any tor
pedo-boats that may attempt to attack
the ships. The turret will be so ar
ranged that the guns can be trained
over an arc of at least 300 degrees, so
that they can be fired in almost any
direction except dead astern.
These vessels will not be as efficient
as double-turreted monitors, but they
will be very effective harbor-defense
ships, and the department proposes to
make them as good as possible with
the money given by Congress. They
will probably require two years to
build.

CAPTURED SPY
CONFESSES GUILT
NEW YORK, May 16.â A Niagara Falls special to the Herald
Bays: Late yesterday afternoon soldiers on guard at Fort Niagara saw
a dark-complexioned man roaming about the gTounds inside the high
stone wall. He visited the blockhouses and the old barracks ajid hung
about the old magazine buildings. He was finally placed under arrest
and locked in the guardhouse. Then he apparently came to the con
clusion that he would gain his liberty by confessing the truth.
Calling a guard, he made the statement that he had visited the fort
for the express purpose of blowing up the magazine, but found the
situation there different from what he had expected. He had lingered
about until nightfall in the hope that he might succeed under cover of
darkness. He would not tell under whose direction he was operating,
simply making the general statement that it was in the interest of the
Spanish.
he said, was how much money should
be provided by taxation and how much
by loan. In committee he had been
willing to increase the revenue feature
so as to insure $125,000,000. On this point
the Committee had been divided, some
members desiring to raise as much as
or more than $150,000,000, and he
thought that the bill would produce
this amount irrespective o-f the Demo
cratic amendments. Indeed, he thought
that the bill as agreed to by all the
members would produce even to ex
ceed $150,000,000, while he thought the
House bill would not produce to exceed
$105,000,000. ,
Taking up the amendments inserted
without the co-operation of the Re
publican members of the Finance Com
mittee, and known as the Democratic
amendments, Allison expressed the
opinion that in addition to the green
back and seigniorage provisions these
would yield $75,000,000 in the aggregate,
in addition to the estimate of $150,000,
000 already given. His estimate' in
cluded from five to six million dollars
on transportation companies, $750,000
on telegraph companies, twov>r three
million dollars on insurance companies
and $15,000,000 on banks.
Allison criticized with considerable
severity the provision for taxing cor
porations, saying that it would be es
pecially severe upon stockholders in
small corporations and that it was also
liable to cause double taxation. In con
clusion Allison said it was one duty of
the Senate to authorize the Secretary of
the Treasury to borrow from time to
time $300,000,000 or so much thereof as
might be needed for war purposes ex
clusively, and to issue 3 per cent bonds
therefor. It was also the purpose to
authorize the Secretary of the Treas
ury to issue certificates on the in
debtedness for $100,000,000 to meet any
deficit in the running expenses of the
Government.
White of California said he wanted to
call the Senate's attention to the fact
that the propriety of placing an equita
ble tax upon the oil refining interests,
the sugar trust and other great mo
nopolies would be forced upon the Sen
ate. The idea was to place some of the
burdens of the present war upon those
who were able to bear them, as well as
upon those who use a little tobacco or
take an occasional glass of beer.
Gorman of Maryland inquired if the
bill as reported to the Senate did not
levy a tax of one-fourth of one per
cent upon the very interests White re
ferred to just the same as upon smaller
corporations.
White admitted that it did, but
thought the Senate ought to have full
justice and equity in view.
Allison said that the bill would be
laid aside for the day, Jones of Arkan
sas having the floor with the under
standing that it was to be the un
finished business and would be called
up each day immediately after the
morning business.
The Senate then, at 2:40 p. m., went
into executive session, and at 3:05 p. m
adjourned.

by a pin ornamented with the national
colors. In the muzzle of each gun was
a white snowball and on every left
breast a red peony. The ladies of ten
churches furnished a generous lunch
eon for the volunteers, neatly tied up
in paper boxes and piled on four im
mense trucks at the union depot. Here

PEKING,. May 16.â The visit of
Prince Henry of Prussia yesterday to
the Emperor of China was a great
event in the history of Peking. The
Prince and his suite went to the sum

and Baron yon Heyking, the German
Minister here, then visited the Em
press dowager, who asked them innu
merable questions. They afterward
visited the Emperor, who received
Prince Henry and his whole suite in the
grand audience hall. The Emperor was
nervous and his hand was trembling as
he shook hands with the Prince, who
offered him a present of some magnifi
cent porcelain.
After a short exchange of compli
ments the Emperor walked to the en
trance hall, where the marines were
drawn up. The rattling drums caused
the Emperor a momentary start. The
Prince then left the Emperor and with
his suite embarked on board electric
steam launches on the lake and visited
the different points of interest.
Later the Prince returned to the au
dlenoe hall, where the Emperor re
turned his visit, bringing with him
most beautiful and valuable presents

ST. THOMAS D. W. L, May 16.â The
United States auxiliary cruiser Yale
appeared in the offing at 5 o'clock this
afternoon and an officer came ashore
â¢with dispatches. He said the Yale had
been cruising off San Juan. The cruis
ers are expected to make daily calls at
this port.
Rear-Admiral Sampson's fleet is off
the north ocast of Hayti awaiting re
inforcements. The Harvard, at Mar
tinique, is keeping a sharp lookout for
Spanish vessels. There are numerous
incendiary fires in Porto Rico.
The Yale, which has been taking on
coal here, stopped suddenly on receiv
ing orders and left hurriedly at 11
o'clock. The cruiser was headed to
the west when she passed out of sight.
ST. PIERRE, Martinique, May 16.â
No Spanish warships were sighted at
this place to-day. The Spanish tor
pedo-boat destroyer Terror is still un
dergoing repairs at Fort de France.
The hospital ship Alicante, which is
also at this port, is being painted
white.
One signal was flashed last night
and another protest was entered by
the American Consul. It is reported
that there is a Spanish warship off the
eastern coast of this island.
The French man-of-war Amiral Re
gault de Genouilly arrived here to-day.
She was slightly damaged in the bom
bardment of Porto Rico. The rumors
of war which reach here have produced
great excitement among the natives.
CADIZ, May 16.â The dock yard au
thorities here have announced that a
reserve fleet, which would consist of
the Pelayo, Carlos V, Alfonso XIII and
the newly equipped cruisers Rapldo and
l'atria, together with the torpedo-boat
destroyers Audaz and Proserpina, will
be ready for sea in the middle of the
present week. There has been consid
erable difficulty in the matter of ob
taining skilled engineers, the Spanish
engineers being unable to obtain the
proper speed out of the torpedo catch-
The Gialda will probably accompany
the fleet as a dispatch boat. It is popu
larly surmised that the fleet goes to the
Philippines, but everything depends
upon what may happen in Havana.
Were the first Spanish fleet to make
a good position and should any mis
fortunes occur to the United States
warships, the men-of-war now in Cadiz
would be directed westward and not
eastward. The Pelayo will be the flag
ship and several armed transports will
accompany the fleet.
GIBRALTAR, May 16.â No Spanish
war vessels have been reported passing
the straits so far this morning. Only
torpedo-boats are stationed at Alge

Ir.fanta Maria Teresa had taken on
about SCO tons of coal and a great

Her arrival was unexpected. A boat

Fpanish cruisers Cardinal CJsneros,
Princess de Asturia and Catalina are
not 3 T et ready for sea and therefore
cannot have arrived at Martinique.
WASHINGTON.. May 10. âIt is said
et the Navy Department that Admiral
Sampson reported to the Navy De
partment to-day by cable from Cape
Haytien. It is understood tiÂ»it the ad
miral by reason of information re
ceived by him changed his plans of
tions. and instead of going to
Key West has directed his vessels to
wark r->nfuegos, where he is expected
to arrive within?: the next day or two.
WASHINGTON, May 16.â Tho Navy
Department takes with great allowance
the report that the Spanish strategists
have succeeded in sending a second
Squadron under Admiral Villamil to the
West Indies and that it is off Mar
tinique. Even if the alleged informa
tion did not bear the suspicious ear
mark of a Madrid date, the Department
would not be surprised to hear that
Admiral Villamil. as well as Admiral
Cervera, was with the Spanish force in
the Caribbean Sea.
The fact that the report came from
Madrid satisfies the officials here that
this is another Spanish ruse to center
our attention on Martinique, while
their ships have pass.-d westward. The
report has it that Admiral Villamil has
with him the cruisers Cisneros, Cata
luna and Princesaa de Asturias. It Is
known, however, that Villamil is not
the admiral of these ships and that at
least one of them, the Cisneros, is on
the other side of the water. It is add
ed that Admiral Villamil is a subordi
nate to Admiral Cervera, whose partic
ular duties are to command the torpedo
destroyers attached to the first Span
ish squadron. He occupies the same
attitude that Commodore Watson does
to Admiral Sampson.
The fact that the alleged report of the
Eecond squadron passed a Madrid cen-
Bor indicates the desire of the Spanish
authorities to spread abroad this mis
leading information. Its purpose, It
Is belioved. is to induce Admiral Samp
eon to remain with his fleet at or near
Martinique, in quest of the shadowy
Second squadron, so as to tako him
â¢-way *rom his pursuit of Admiral Cer
! vera and the actual Spanish game al
ready in sight.
PORT AU PRINCE, Hayti, May 16.â
The United States torpedo boat Porter
returned to Cape Haytien this morning,
having left Rear Admiral Sampson's
fleet in the offing. Lieutenant Bennett
conferred with the United States Con
sul at Cape Haytien and filed dis
patches from the rear admiral. The
rendezvous of '.he fleet is north of Cape
Havtien.
The Porter left here at 10 o'clock to
rejoin the fleet. While going to Cape
Haytien yesterday the Porter scraped
a reef, but sustained no damage.
The destination of the fleet is uncer-

tain. The storeship Supply was ex
pected to warn the Minneapolis at Cape
Haytien, and her departure from there
is said to be due to a mistake which
will probably be rectified by the Por
ter's return.
The cruiser Minneapolis is likely to
be intercepted with new orders.
CHICAGO, May 16.â A special from
Washington says: It is believed to be
the plan of Admiral Cervera to Keep
out of the way of the battle-ships and
turn his attention to the cruisers and
gunboats. This he can perhaps do by
reason of his superior speed. Coast
cities may be attacked in pursuance of
this plan.
A special to the Journal from Wash
ington says: A big surprise awaits the
Spanish admiral if he sails for Mar
tinique. There he is apt to find a new
squadron, composed of the Oregon, the
Marietta, the Buffalo (the Nictheroy),
the Montgomery, the Yale and the St.
Louis. The latter have been sent by
Admiral Sampson to effect a junction
with Captain Clark and to remain near
Martinique. Under orders the Oregon
has been making rapid time since she
left Bahia,
A special to the Journal from Wash
ington says: Havana is short of pow
der and shot.- It is to supply Blanco
with ammunition for his big guns that
the Cape Verde fleet has been ordered
to take all risks to reach Cuba,
Blanco, it is asserted, wired to Mad
rid that he had not enough ammunition
for the guns of his harbor fortifications
to last two days and that if it had to
be divided with the forts protecting
Havana on the land side his powder
and shot supply would not last twenty
four hours.

SAN DIEGO. May 16.â The little gun- j
boat Alert came up to-day from the
south. Her sails were all set as she
plowed up along the coast, and the
brisk west wind and her steam sent her .
along at a good speed. The people on |
Coronado Beach were somewhat
alarmed, as no notice of the Alert's
arrival had been given, and it was '
thought that perhaps the long-looked- j
for Spanish privateer had appeared.
The Alert left San Francisco on Janu
! a'ry 11 to survey the proposed harbor
! of San Juan del Sur, the terminus of
i the Nicaragua canal. She is now on
! her way back to Mare Island, and her
officers and men earnestly hope to be
called into active war service.
The first news of Dewey's victory and
succeeding events was learned by Cap
tain Leutze and his men upon arrival
here. Newspapers were simply de
voured by the dozen. The tars sent up
; lusty cheers over the glorious victory in
j the Philippines.
"We had a little hint of fun our
| selves," said Captain Leutze, '"but
' nothing approaching the dignity of a
I fight. After doing considerable work,
Ensign Standley and myself went on
horseback to Rivas, in the interior of
Nicaragua, to report to Admiral
I Walker. On our return the insurrection
j was on, and the insurgents ran across
j us and took charge of us until they had
I completed the capture of San Juan.
| Then they released us. I permitted a
i number of refugees to go aboard the
Alert, and this led to an attack upon us
by the insurgents. They fired 3 and 4
pounders at us, but it did no damage â
J merely caused us to laugh. We could
! easily have silenced them, but did not
: propose to fire. I placed Lieutenant
i Field and a body of men at the Ameri
| can consulate and kept the Alert in
position to protect them, but there was
no occasion to shoot. That same day
| the Government forces drove the mi
i surgents out.
"We took on board the Nicaraguan
j peace commission and sailed for Punta
I Arenas, there taking on the Costa
Rican commission. On board the Alert,
at sea on April 26, the \treaty of peace
between these countries was signed.
After landing the commissions we
sailed for San Francisco, stopping at
Corinto and Acapulco for coal. We
were charged exorbitantly at both
places on account of the war."
Captain Leutze was formerly with
Dewey on the Juniata. and is a great
i admirer of the Little Giant of the
| Philippines. The Alert will take on
coal to-morrow and sail at once for
Mare Island.
Authorizes Aid for Cubans.
WASHINGTON, May 10.â In the
House to-day Marsh of Illinois pre
sented the conference report upon the
bill authorizing the army officers to
furnish food to the Cuban people and
arms and equipments to Cubans to in
crease their fighting effectiveness
against Spain during the present war.
The report was adopted without objec
tion.
SPANISH SOLDIERS SEEK
THEIR OWN DEFEAT.
KINGSTON. Jamaica, May 16.â The French cruiser Fulton, with
thirty-eight French refugees from Havana on board, was released from
quarantine to-day. She left Havana' on the evening of May g. The
city's food supplies were then calculated to last three months, but this
was a high estimate. The price of food was as follows:
Flour, 30 cents a pound; eggs, io cents each; beef, 50 cents a pound.
There was great misery among the lower classes.
Volunteers are said to be pacific. Many Cubans have joined in order
to preserve their families and be allowed to use firearms for personal
defense in case of riot. Many Spanish soldiers are sick in hospitals and
the troops are disheartened, dreading cooping up in Havana during the
coming fever season. All openly express a wish that American victories
will cause Spain to abandon Cuba and allow them to return home. A
new police force edict has been issued in town, creating volunteer police
force in every division. Only Spaniards are allowed to join;' ostensibly
this is for the preservation of public order, but in reality it is to create
organized espionage.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
KEY WEST, Fla., May 16.â The Uncas,
after leaving here at 1 o'clock on Sun
day morning, headed for Havana and
spoke the Mayflower, which was act
ing as flagship of the blockading fleet.
Lieutenant Brainard, U. S. N., special
agent of the United States Govern
ment, boarded her and handed sealed
orders to the captain, who thereupon in
structed the Uncas to hoist a white
flag and proceed into Havana harbor.
The Uncas then steamed toward Ha
vana and within signaling distance of
Morro Castle she signaled, asking for
an anchorage. The castle signaled
back that its commander was waiting
for instructions, and that the Uncas
must certainly not anchor.
After an interval, a launch with the
harbor authorities on board put out
from the Bhore and took on board
Lieutenant Brainard and Mr. Knight,
the correspondent of the London
Times, who had been chosen to nego-
tiate the exchange of prisoners. As
the launch was returning to the shore
she was met by Captain-General
Blanco's launch, coming out with the
captain-general's aide d>* camp and Mr.
Gullon, the British Consul-General.
The boats drew together and a con
ference was held. Lieutenant Brain
ard and Mr. Knight were assured that
Charles Thrall and Hayden Jones were
absolutely safe and were being treated
with every consideration. It was added
that Captain-General Blanco was will
ing to release them the moment the
United States authorities sent him two
Spanish prisoners in exchange. Mr.
Knight was told he could not land at
Havana from an American boat, In
spite of the flag of truce, and it was
explained to him that if he desired to
reach Havana he must go there on a
ship belonging to some neutral power.
The Uncas then returned to Key
West and delivered the information to
the department. It is understood that
two of the Spanish captives now in
Fort McPherson, Atlanta, will be
promptly sent down and the exchange
of prisoners will be consummated with
out further trouble.
War Expenses of the Navy.
WASHINGTON, May 16.â The Secre
tary of the Navy sent to the House to

of $33,000,000 in round numbers to cover
the war expenditures of the navy for
the first six months of the next fiscal
year. This is supplemental to the es
timates heretofore received and is ex
pected to cover one-half of all the ex
penditures the war will impose on the

It Necessary to Declare
Neutrality.
Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, May 10.â The steamship
R!o Janeiro arrived from San Fran
cisco on the 7th, bringing news of war
between the United States and Spain.
Captain Nichols was seen on board the
Bennington shortly after he had read
his dispatches and also after he had
had an interview with Minister Sewall
and Consul General Haywood. He said:
"I have received no orders respecting
the immediate movement of my vessel.
If I am to leave here the department
has not apprised me of the fact. My
dispatches by the Rio relate merely to
what is going on on the other side."
Asked what he would do in case this
Government proclaimed its neutrality,
the captain stated that that was a mat
ter of which he could not possibly speak
at this time. He said in effect, If
not plainly, that his movements in such
a contingency would depend largely up
on the wishes of this Government.
At the United States Consulate and
Legation everything pertaining to the
war or the probable developments in
this quarter is kept profoundly secret.
It is reported from the Bennington
that the work of cleaning, begun last
Saturday, has been finished, and the
vessel will at once be cleared for war.
She will be* painted the lead gray color
she must wear in action for Uncle Sam.
Reports have been flying thick and
fast since Saturday night as to what
the Hawaiian Government will do with
the occupation bill now in its hands,
and what proceeding will be taken with
respect to the war. It is almost certain
that the bill will not be put before the
Legislature for the present, not before
Thursday, at any rate. It is equally
certain that this Government will not
declare its neutrality as between the
United States and Spain.
There is being quietly organized here
a company of 100 men for service with
troops of the United States in case an
assignment to active duty can be se
cured. It is said that reliable men of
means are behind the movement, and
thai all the preliminary arrangements
have been made. A reply to the offer
made to the Secretary of War is ex
pected on the 17th inst.
The Hawaiian Government will not
proclaim neutrality. This stand is
taken on account of the existing rela- i
tions between the United States and
Hawaii. The executive considers that a
proclamation of neutrality would be a
breach of good faith.
The Government made known its
position yesterday at a secret session of
the Senate. It is understood that the
Senators favored the stand taken by
President Dole.
It was extensively reported in the
business community on the "th that
Spain, through agents here, was buying
all the coal to be had in these islands.
The consul for Spain denied the story
and said that there was not a word of
truth in it.
That a coal famine Is imminent there
can hardly be any doubt. Last week
stocks were lower than in many j
months, scarcely 8000 tons being on '
hand and only one house has any coal
for sale, and will only consent to sell
in quantities to satisfy immediate de
mands.
United States Consul General Hay
wood has been watching the situation :
keenly, and has strongly fortified
America's position. He has 3600 tons â 
of coal on hand at the present time
with two cargoes afloat, bound for this
port. In less than a monta the United
States will have 7400 tons of coal at this
port, a very respectable amount.
There was a move on foot here the '
other day to place a number of Ameri
can barks now plying between San
Francisco and this port under the Ha
waiian flag in order to save insurance.
Among the vessels which were to j
change flags were the S. N. Castle and
the S. C. Allen. The scheme did not
carry for the reason that the local un
derwriters stepped in with the an
nouncement that they will demand war
rates on Hawaiian bottoms. The in
surance men claim that Spanish cruis
ers will not spare Hawaiian vessels on
account of the strong American feel
ing prevailing here.

WAR SPIRIT
OF THE DONS

But There Is a Prospect
of the Cabinet Crisis
Being Prolonged.
Owing to the Turmoil in Spain the
King's Birthday Celebrations
Are Abandoned.
MADRID, May 16.â Senor Moret. the
Minister for the Colonies, to-day con
firmed the statement that any changes
made in the composition of the Cabinet
would be wholly in the direction of a
more active war policy. He said: "Re
cent events have greatly increased the
war spirit of the nation. The great
est reliance Is placed upon Admiral
Cervera's squadron and upon the skill
of the Spanish admiral. Cervera is not
hampered by instructions and the de
tails of his plans are not even kno.wn
to the Ministers."
Captain-General Blanco, in a dis- I
patch from Havana, officially reiterates
the Spanish version of the so-called !
fight between the Spanish gunboats ]
Conde de Venadito and Nueva Espana i
and the vessels of the American j
blockading fleet. He chums that the â¢
two gunboats engaged five American j
ships and forced the latter to retreat,
adding: "I obtained the results de- I
sired, namely, to attract as many of the I
enemy's ships as possible. Yesterday
morning there were only three hei'e and
now there are eleven."
Senor Sagasta this afternoon visited
the palace and formally handed to the
Queen Regent the resignations of the
ministry.
The Queen Regent then charged Se
nor Sagasta to form a new Cabinet.
The Premier will confer with the
Presidents of the Chambers and with

Senor Sagasta believes the new minis
try will be formed by Wednesday
next.
Orders have been issued by Senor Sa
gasta countermanding the reception,
which was to have been held to-mor
row upon the occasion of the King's
birthday, and he has instructed the.
captains general in all districts not to
hold their usual receptions.
On receiving the announcement that
the Cabinet had resigned both houses
adjourned.
Marquis Vega d'Armijo, President of
the Chamber, has advised Senor Sa
gasta to end the crisis as quickly as
possible. Senor Monterio Rios, Presi
dent of the Senate, has offered his sup
port, but does not desire to enter the
new Cabinet.
Senor Gamazou, who is ill, also de
clines to enter the Cabinet, but he
promises to support any ministry or
ganized by Senor Sagasta.
The general impression is that the
Cabinet crisis will be protracted. Se
nor Romero y Robledo thinks that
Marshal Martinez Campos ought to be
the chief of the new ministry.
Admiral Camara, the commander of
the Spanish reserve squadron at Cadiz,
has been recalled here to confer with I
the Ministers respecting his intended
operations.
The newspapers express fear that a
secret Anglo-American alliance already
exists.
PROTESTS AGAINST
AMERICAN FEELING
The Journal dcs Debats Claims That
France Is Not Unfriendly to
This Country.
PARIS, May 16.â The Journal dcs De-j
bats in the course of a long article to
day, reflects the anxiety experienced in
Government circles here respecting the
feeling aroused in America on account
of France's open sympathy with Spain.
It says: "'The whole affair is a mis
understanding. French opinion at the
outset of the war certainly regarded j
the United States as in the wrong and
some of the papers expressed this opin
ion in an aggressive tone. The Ameri
cans, however, should not have taken
the matter tragically, for, of all for
eigners, our natural sympathies are for'
the United States and our Government I
throughout has acted most correctly."
After charging Great Britain with be- j
ing at the bottom of the mischief and I
declaring that it is America's own busi- i
ness if she decides to interfere in dis- '
tant affairs, the article concludes:
"What concerns us is that America
should not, in taking up the great role
of international domain, start with pre- ,
conceived ideas against us and de- ,
nounce the good understanding with
France which has been so useful in the
past and which is still more desirable !
in the future. The French nation was
never really hostile to the Americans, '
whn will realize this when the present
friction has had time to disappear."

W. H. Grant, Grand Chancellor
Knights of Pythias.
The occasion for this outburst of en
thusiasm was the arrival of delegates
to the Grand Lodges of Knights of
Pythias and Rathbone Sisters, which
will convene in this city to-morrow
morning, marking the first event of the
week set aside for the annual rose car-
nival celebration, the predecessors of

Its floral wealth famous over half the
world.
A delegation from the reception com
mittee met the Donahue train and, pre
ceded by Park's band, marched with
the arriving delegates to general head
quarters, where the visitors were as
signed to rooms.
The uniformed band from Camp Hah
man, where the uniformed rank is en
camped in a city of tents, met the
Southern Pacific train as it drew in,
and, escorted by the entire advance
guard of the uniformed division, the
delega-tion from the southern part of
the State was taken to headquarters
and assigned accommodations.
Park's band then gave an open air
concert from the portico of the Court
house for the entertainment of the
* throngÃ that lined the sidewalks, and
the Pythian band escorted the dele
gates to Fraternity Hall, where a short
opening session of the Grand Lodge
was called to order.
Grand Chancellor Grant called meet-
Ing to order. The grand lodge degree

The proceedings to-morrow will con
sist principally of lodge work, but en
tertainments of a private nature will
take place in several parts of the city,
and in the evening the great reception
to delegates and carnival visitors will
be held in the Atheneum, the largest
auditorium in the city.
On Wednesday there will be the big

THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 17, 1898.
RAIN BENEFITS
GROWING BEETS
One Good Effect of the
Recent General
Downpour.
Chinos Sugar Factory Will
Pay Out Much Coin to
Farmers.
Fruit-Growersin Southern California
Have Profited by the
Showers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
POMONA, May 16.â A broad smile
adores the countenances of the people
of Chino and Pomona valleys. The
heavy rain yesterday has done incal
culable good to all sugar-beet fields
and has been a blessing to fruit-grow
ers. Tc-night another rain is ap
proaching. There will be at least 4000
acres of sugar beets ready for the
Chino Sugar Factory by August,
whereas it was feared a month ago
there would not be enough beets to run
the factory. Hundreds of sugar-beet
growers who have been discouraged at
growing beets this year are now as
sured of a goc-d crop and large profit.
Orange and lemon groves are so well
watered by the rain that no irrigation
will be necessary for another month.
STOCKTON, May- 16.â Special tele
phone reports from points in San Joa
quin, Merced and Stanislaus counties
indicate that while the rain of Satur
day night and Sunday was of benefit
to winter-sown and late summer fal
low grain, and to vegetables and fruit,
especially grapes, considerable hay was
down, and a good deal that had
been cut was badly damaged. In some
few places the rain will have the effect
of filling out the wheat which is alive,
while in other places wheat is too far
gone to be benefited. Taken altogeth
er, however, the rain has been of more
benefit than the damage amounts to.
The biggest crap of oranges ever raised
in Oakdale will be plucked this season,
while at Clements the prune crop will
be immense. The rain has had the ef
fect of cleansing the fruit trees of bugs
and spiders. The average rainfall was
over an inch.
LODI, May 16.â Over an inch of rain
has fallen here since Saturday. The
rain will be worth thousands of dollars
to the raisers of grain, sugar beets,
watermelons .and grapes, but hay-pro
ducers will suffer a slight loss. The
rainfall is particularly opportune for
grain-growers, as it will help the grain
to ripen and fill out. Indications point
to a further rainfall to-night.
SAN JOSE. May 16.â Rain began
falling again this morning at 4 o'clock.
The total for the storm since it began
Saturday afternoon was .43 of an inch
at noon to-day.
MARYSVILLE. May IG.-The rainfall
for the storm which began Saturday
afternoon is 0.75 of an Inch; 0.70 of which
fell on Saturday night. Growing grain
and fruit will be benefited. Prospects in
Yuba and Sutter are now good for a fair
hay crop. Rainfall In the foothills, with
a snow storm farther up, insures to the
miners of Yuba County a plentiful sup
ply of water.
REDDING. May 16.â The rain of the
past few days has been of incalculable
benefit to the upper portion of the Sca
ramento Valley, and especially the moun
tain valleys of Northern California.
There is some damage reported. Dry feed
is injured, but as a whole grain and feed
have been benefited.
SAN DIEGO. May 16.-Rain began fall
ing again to-night and there is every in
dication of an ail night storm.
WESTERN STATES FEAR
AN INDIAN UPRISING
Military Preparations to Guard
Against Outbreaks of Reserva
tion Redskins.
DENVER, May 16.â From the tenor
of communications received by Colonel
Sumner during the past few days it ap
pears that the Indians in the depart
ments of the Colorado and the Missouri
which are under his command are dis
playing an unusual restlessness, which
bodes no good for the settlers in the
vicinity of the various reservations.
The danger of an outbreak in Arizona
has become so imminent that Colonel
Sumner has ordered two troops of cav
alry from Fort Huachuea to the Mexi
can boundary line, with orders to move
along that line from Nogales, Ariz., to
the Gulf of California, observing a
strict patrol of the entire border. An
other troop has been ordered from Fort
Grant to Fort...Huachuca to garrison
the latter fort while the troops are in
the field and to be prepared to assist
these troops in case of trouble. One
troop of the Eighth Cavalry recently
was ordered from Fort Meade, S. D.,
to Fort Washakie, Wyo., and there is
a possibility that this force will be side
tracked and sent to Fort Niobrara,
Neb., instead.
Colonel Sumner to-day received a pe
tition for troops for a larÂ»r<Â» number of
settlers in the portion of Nebraika ad
joining the Sioux reservation, who bfe
lieve the Sioux are planning a whole
sale massacre of whites.
DEMAND BETTER WAGES.
Two Thousand Wood Workers Go Out
on Strike.
OSHKOSH. Wls., May 16.â About 2000
members of the "Woodworkers' Union to
day refused to work. Several large sash.
door and blind factories are involved and
their operations will be greatly hampered.
Each striker will receive $3 a week from
the National Union and they claim they will
stay out all summer, if necessary
Thomas I. Kldd. secretary of the Na
tional Machine Woodworkers' Union, and
the State Board of Arbitration are here
trying to arrange a compromise. The
strikers demand an increase of 25 per cent
with a minimum wage of $1 25, weekly
pay days, abolition of female labor and
recognition of the union.
Succumbs to Paralysis.
SALINAS, May 16.â 0n January 19 last,
when the thermometer registered 21 de
grees above zero, Louis de Lean, an old
Frenchman living four miles from San
Ardo, started for home in an intoxicated
condition. Nothing was heard of him for
two days, when he was found under a
trestle in the waters of Poncho Rico
Creek, paralyzed and with his back and
sides frozen. He was taken to the French
Hospital in San Francisco, where he re
mained until May 2. On his return he
went to the County Hospital. Yesterday
while he was out walking a second at
tack of paralysis came on, which killed
him. He was about 64 years old and an
old resident here.
Must Hold Another Election.
SALINAS, May 16.â The contest by U.
E. Dunlap to have Charles Harte, elected
Trustee of Pacific Grove by a majority of
1, declared not entitled to the Beat was
decided this morning by Judge Dorn of
the Superior Court against both candi
dates, and a new election was ordered.
The contest was on the ground of numer
ous double marks on ballots, which, if re
jected, would elect Dunlap. The court
rejected some and allowed others, mak
ing a tie vote on the final count. The con
test was very interesting, as the persons
concerned are brothers-in-law.
WATER FIGHT
AROUSES IRE
City Attorney Dunn of
Los Angeles Resents
Insinuations.
Declares Ho Has Done His
Duty in Dealing With
the Monopoly.
Lively Scene In the City Council
Over a Special Committee's
Report.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, May 16.â City Attor
ney William E. Dunn took occasion to
day at a meeting of the City Council
to resent what he termed charges, in
sinuations and innuendos cast upon
him and his official conduct by the
special Council committee on mountain
water supply. Several weeks ago this
committee made a report to the Coun
cil, in which it took occasion to criti
cize the City Attorney and the City
Engineer for failure to obey the in
structions of the Council, charging both
with neglect of duty. City Attorney
Dunn said he had never at any time
failed to do all that was asked of him
by the Committee on Mountain Water
Supply.
Councilman Grider of the committee
in question proceeded forthwith to deny
that the committee in its report had
any desire to cast reflections on Mr.
Dunn. He rather hinted that the City
Engineer was the official the commit
tee thought had been derelict. But
City Engineed Dockweller was not
present.
Councilman Hutchinson said the re
port of the committee was written by
himself and any city official it fitted
could wear it, if he saw fit.
As a matter of fact the report did
pass severe strictures on the City At
torney and the City Engineer for fail
ure to obey the direct instructions of
the Council. The friends of Council
man Grider was chagrined because he
did not defend the report made by the
Mountain Water Committee, in so far
as it rapped officials who had certainly
failed to obey the orders of the Coun
cil.
During his time on the floor of the
Council Mr. Dunn said the City Water
Company was ready to pay its city
taxes, amounting to 511,800, provided
the city would not add the usual pen
alty, which in this case would amount
to $800, for delinquency. The water
company has always. been prepared to
pay city taxes on all of its property
save the franchise. The Assessor first
put a valuation of $600,000 upon it. The
Council reduced that figure to $150,000.
This the company thought too high and
it proceeded to test the matter in court.
The case is now pending. In the mean
time the water company offered to pay
$10,000 city taxes, holding out the tax
on the franchise. The City Tax Cot
lector refused to accept part payment
and the Council approved his act. Tha
company now comes forward and
agrees to pay fall taxes and leave the
franchise matter to be decided by the
courts later. The Council will proba
bly accept the $11,800 and cut off the
$800 penalty. ___________
TERRITORIAL CAPITOL
BUILDING FOR ARIZONA.
Proceeds of a Bond Sale to Be De-
voted to the Erection of
the Structure.
PHOENIX, Ariz., May 16.â The sale of
$100,000 In Territorial bonds, the proceed!
of which are to be devoted to erecting
a Territorial capitol building, was made
to-day to Charles R. Mayer, cashier of
the First National Bank of Columbus.
Ohio, for par and 2H P er cent commission.
It is understood the funds will be availa
ble immediately. The commission hav
ing the building in charge will make pub
lication during the next sixty days for
competitive plans and speculations, the
design being left largely to the taste or
the architect. The ultimate cost of the
building will be about $300,000. It is pro
posed to use Arizona materials in its con
struction, including specimens of agatvzed
wood from Chalcedony Park.
BUSSIA BUYING GOLD.
Secured All of the Yellow Metal Re-
cently From the Cape.
LONDON, May 16.â The St. James Ga
zette in its financial article this after
noon says: Russia to-day is said to have
completed the purchase of the whole of
the recent arrivals of gold from the Cape.
Such a transaction is exceptional, as a
considerable time has elapsed since Rus
sia entered the English market. With a
new buyer in addition to the United
States gold Bhould shortly be higher.
Russia paid 77s 9^3, but if the United
States' demands had not temporarily
ceased it is questionable if the price
would not have been above 77s lOd. It
is thought Russia will buy frequently
hereafter. If so, it will be another in
dication of the political wind.
REUNION OF VETERANS.
Heroes of the Late War Will Camp
at Los Gatos.
SAN JOSE, May 16.â The Central Cali
fornia Veterans' Reunion Association has
completed arrangements for a two weeks'
encampment at Los Gatos, commencing
on June 27 and continuing until July 11.
The association includes the G. A. R. and
its auxiliary societies of Santa Clara,
San Mateo, San Benito, Monterey and
Santa Cruz counties, which represent
several thousand members.
Over 1000 veterans are expected to be
present. The tents will be pitched in
Bunker Hill Park, and the people of Los
Gatos will leave nothing undone to add
to the pleasure of the old soldiers and
their families.
Mrs.' Castro's Will Contested.
SALINAS, May 16.â The contest of the i
will of Mrs. Sacramento Castro, the old- i
est Monterey County native daughter,
who died three weeks ago, was begun in
the Superior Court this afternoon. At the I
time' of her death she was thought to be |
a pauper, but It has since be^n discovered ;
that she owned 160 acres of land near
Gonzales and other property valued at
17000. There are four heirs-at-law, each
of whom claims the entire estate.
Convention of Supervisors.
NAPA. May 18.â The first delegation of
visiting Supervisors to the annual con
vention of county Supervisors, which will
convene in this city to-morrow, arrived
on the evening train. They were escorted
to Odd Fellows' Hall, where a general re
ception was held. Refreshments were
served and addresses of welcome made.
Supervisors from all parts of the State
are expected to attend the convention.
Gives Advice to Students.
SANTA ROSA, May 16.â T0-night Rev.
C. R. Lamar delivered the address before
the Ulatus Society of the Pacific Metho
dist College. The discourse teemed with
food advice, punctuated by clever anec
otes. He urged the students to take a
hopeful view of themselves, and declared
the greatest barrier to success in life
was a pessimistic spirit
FIRST VETO OF
THE EXECUTIVE
Received by the House
and the President Is
Sustained.
Passage of the Resolution Ap
pointing Four Managers of
Soldiers' Home.
In Opposing Colonel Bonsall of Los
Angeles Loud Makes an Attack
on Senator Perkins.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House.
Washington, May 16.
The House to-day received its first
veto from President McKinley, and
voted unanimously to sustain the ex
ecutive. The veto was of a bill con
ferring upon the Court of Claims juris
diction in a private claims case of long
standing. The day was given to con
sideration of billfc under suspension of
the rules, the measures of chief im
portance being one ratifying an agree
ment for the allotment and opening to
settlement of the Comanche, Kiowa and
Apache lands in Oklahoma, and to ea
tablish an assay office at Seattle, Wash.
Under a suspension of the rules Hull of
lowa called up the Senate bill author
izing the President to appoint an assist
ant adjutant-general with the rank of
colonel and another with the rank of
major.
A joint resolution appointing William
J. Sewall of- New Jersey. Marttn T. Mc-
Mahon of New York, John T. Mitchell of
Wisconsin and William H. Bonsall of
California members of the board of man
agers of the National Home for Disabled
Volunteer Soldiers was called up.
Pending the disposal of the measure
Lacey of lowa raised the question of
eligibility of Senators Sewell and Mitchell,
as being contrary to the Federal consti
tution.
Loud of California attacked the action
of the Committee on Military Affairs in
not permitting him a fair opportunity to
be heard upon the selection of the Cali
fornia member of the board. He declared
that Major Bonsall was unknown to the
volunteer soldiers, and at length charged
the naming of Major Bonsall to have oeen
done at the dictation of a Senator from
California (Perkins) "to pay a political
debt," and he (Loud) regretted th<j -de
bauching of the soldiers' home to pay
political obligations."
Replying to these charges, Hull of
lowa, chairman of the committee, denied
them in toto and asserted that the com
mittee had simply followed the rule and
named two Democrats and two Re
publicans. As to Major Bonsall. he had
been urged by a Renublican Senator and
two representatives from California and
by the California Republican State Cen
tral Committee, a "recommendation,
Hull declared, "quite as much entitled to
consideration as that of the gentleman
from California who has Just addressed
the House."
The resolution was passed, 126 to 56.
The Speaker then. laid before the House
a message from the President vetoing a
bill conferring upon the Court of Claims
jurisdiction to re-try the case of the rep
resentatives of Isaac P. Tice against thÂ«
United States, brought in 1873 to recovei
$25,000. the alleged value or certain meters
to measure the quality and strength of
distilled spirits.
Interest attached to the message chiefly
by reason of Its being the first veto mes
sage ever sent by President McKinley to
the House.
The ayes and noes were takefl upon the
passage of the hill over the veto, and the
President was sustained without a dis
senting vote. 183 members voting.
The Senate bill to establish an assay
office at Seattle, Wash., was called up.
C. W. Stone said the purpose of the bill
was to afford a convenient office for the
Klondike gold producers, who will mine
this year, it was estimated, from $12,000,
000 to $20,000,000 of the metal. The bill
carries an appropriation of $20,000 for ex
penses of the office.
Lewis and Jones of Washington spoke
for the hill. Cannon of Illinois opposed
it. insisting that a Government assay
office at Seattle was unnecessary. Can
non, speaking against the establishment
of any more assay offices, declared that
the motive in urging an office at Seattle
was prompted by a desire of the Alaskan
transportation companies, which prac
tically controlled the Klondike output, to
put down gold at Seattle at Philadelphia
mint prices.
"Is It not better for the Government,"
asked Bland, "to establish assay offi
ces and secure gold in that way than to
sell bonds for it?"
"Oh," cried back Cannon, with a wave
of his hand, "the gentleman would throw
the patient into fits. Bonds have no
more to do with this question than the
gentleman has to do with heaven or
sound sense."
The bill was then passed. The House
adjourned at 4:50 p. m.
Death at Santa Cruz.
SANTA CRUZ. May 16.â Zacharlah Shaw
Devoe, a capitalist and prominent citizen,
died to-day, aged 76 years. He was a
native of New York and has resided In
Santa Cruz twenty-one years.
The Death Rate.
While It Is quite true that the proportion of
deaths from malaria as an immediate cause is
proportionately small as cited in annual mortu
ary statistics, yet physicians are thoroughly
convinced that it r -sea maladies of a. fatal
character, and begets dangerous nervous pros
tration. This malady Is eradicated and pre
vented by Hostetter's Stomach Bitters, which
alsoS:ures biliousness, constipation, rheumatism
and dyspepsia.

All Bets Declared Off Because the
Irish Lad Was Six Pounds
Over Weight.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
NEW YORK, May 16.â Dave Sullivan,
the little Irish pugilist, met Sammy
Kelly of this city to-night at the Len
nox Athletic Club, and after fighting
twenty rounds was declared winner by
Referee Jimmy Dime of Amsterdam,
2n t . T. The boys were ma,tched some
time ago to fight at 118 pounds, but to
night Sullivan was six pounds over
â weight and had to pay a forfeit of
$250.
Sullivan was the favorite in the bet- j
ting at 100 to 90, but owing to the dif- !
ference In the weights of the contest- j
ante, the announcement was made that j
all bets were off before the boys began â 
to fight.
It was a pretty contest all through
and if it had not been for Kelly's tactics |
In the latter part of the bout, when he j
frequently grabbed Sullivan's arm, the |
referee's decision might have been a I
draw.
Neither contestant was floored dur- I
Ing the twenty rounds. Kelly drew first !
blood in the twelfth round, when he
landed a hard left on SuiHvan's nose, j
Kelly was the aggressor up to the
eighteenth round, but in the closing j
rounds Sullivan led the fighting. Both
men were repeatedly cautioned during j
the contest for striking low and in i
clinches.

"SWIFTWATER BILL"
NOT YET A CORPSE.
With a Denial of the Report of His
Death Comes News of a River
Disaster.
SEATTLE, May IG.-J. G. Wilson i
reached here to-day from the Klondike '
country, having left there on April 17. He !
came from Skaguay to Victoria on the !
steamer Amur. ',
Wilson says the Jast boat that went I
down Thirty-Mile River was wrecked j
and all the passengers lost. The names
of the passengers were unknown, and the I
only thing that had been discovered that j
may lead to the Identity of the missing '
was a chest of carpenters' tools. In the i
ihe-.st were found a novelty woodworker, j
a black vest, a key-winding Waltharn
watch and a key rr.ade out of a German
coin. The chest was marked "Biack Dla
: C."
Wilson says that the report that "Swift
water I;:;:" Gates was drowned was not
true, a.Â« he talked to him three days after j
the report of the alleged drowning was
brought down to Dyea. "Swiftwater Bill"
then had two women in his party, and
they were near the police station at the I
Coot "f I.ak.- Tatfish. Wilson is unaoie j
to say how the report of the drowning of I
Gates originated, as he was the last man j
to see hiiii. and the entire party "was then i
all right and had not experienced any
dangers.

DATES FIXED FOR THE

Changes Mnci ;i the Premium List
and the J iiion Admission
y educed.
BACRAMEX May 16.â The State
Board of Agii< .â¢â  met to-day to con
sider reports of otnmittees. The report
of the premium list .â¢ommlttee was the
most important, inasmuch as it contained
a revision of the entire premium list for
1898. making such changes ,-ls wore deemed
advisable. The principal change Is to have
expert single judges In all classes where
practical. Ihe secretary is directed to
correspond with several exports for the
various classes of livestock.
The dates of the fair were fixed from
September 5 to 17, inclusive. The admis
sion fee at the pavilion was reduced to
25 cents. This change was made at the
earnest solicitation of exhibitors and
considering the condition of the times!
the board deemed it prudent to make it'
The admission to the park will be 60
cents, as heretofore.
MUD LARKS IN
THEIR ELEMENT
Caspar Downed Rey del
Tierra and Bernadillo
Galloping.
Sport McAllister at Odds of 13
to 1 Beat Some Fast
Ones.
Also Ran Was Heavily Played and
Won Easilyâ Rapido Annexed a.
Purse Without Effort.
Muddy going has been responsible for
many a "cherry ripe" one that was put
over'the plate at lone odds, but although
the track at Oakland yesterday was in a
very juicy condition, the heavily played
horses in the betting more than held their j
own. Sport McAllister, at odds of 15 to
1 was the only rank outsider to get home
In front, and he was but lightly supported.
Two favorites and three well played sec
ond choices in' the betting splashed In
first in the other events.
The attendance was large, many specu
lators on the wrong side of the fence
a^ain donning the harness in an effort
to even matters up before the meeting
draws ie a close.
There appeared to be big doings about
Stemor in the opening six furlong sprint,
and he was srnt to the post a mild 3 to
1 favorite. McDonald, who had tho
mount came on from fourth position in
the stretch, and at the wire won cleverly
from Adam Andrew, a 10 to 1 shot, backed
down to 5 at post time. Zaraida an
other outsider, with Thorpe up, finished
in the show.
The four and a half furlong scramble
for 2-year-olds, developed a good thing
In Nolan & Tholl's colt Also Ran. The
youngster was played down from 5 to 2
to S to 5. and always in front, led Lnler
past the wire galloping. MoNichols on
the 7 to 5 favorite got badly mixed up
soon after the start and was never prom
im-nt.
With Candelaria scratched from the
mile selling run, it proved an excellent
betting proposition. Thorpe's mount.
Navy Blue, had first call in the betting,
but was outfooted from the start. Rapido,
the second choice, played from 3 to 2 to
even, overtook Senator Morrill in the run
home and won with pounds to spare. The
Senator downed the favorite eight lengths
for the place. !
The talent fell heavily over the result
of the six furlong sprint, fourth on the 1
card. San Mateo was an overwhelming
choice, but developed a streak of yello^r j
when he could not shake oft his company, j
and was unplaced at the end. Sport Mc-
Allister, with Rufus Narvaez in the sad
dle, took first position in the stretch,
hading Peixotto out by a length. Tiny |
P, a 30 to 1 shot, nosed Colonel Dan out
for the show.
Dan Honig's Caspar made a runaway
race of the mile and a sixteenth selling
run, winning eased to a gallop. Ber
nardillo. the favorite, was beaten a nose
for the place by Rev del Tierra. The win
ner was as good as 3 to 1 in the bet-
The concluding seven furlong, decided
under selling conditions, went to the 9 to
10 favorite, Zamar. which led from start
to finish. In a drive Dolore took the place
from the poorly ridden Polish.
TRACK MOTES.
The well known penciler, Billy Beverly, de
parts for Chicago to-day. He breaks about
even on the winter's booking.
Maxey Blumenthal thought Caspar was
"moral" and held Honlg's horse out In his
book. He beat the race out of. $1600.
George Bayless, the well known trainer, who
died suddenly in Oakland on Sunday, first
came to this roast with the great horse, True
Blue. The deceased horseman was one of the
most rapable trainers in this country, h,ut
continued ill health had kept him in the back
ground lor the past two or three years.
Early next week Trainer Billy Short will
leave for Denver with the crack sprinters, Ru
bicon, RoiUiwanncr, R. Q. Ban. Kaiser Lud
vrlg, Midas and a couple of others. The big
meeting which commences in that city on
June 2 will attract a large number of. horse
men from this part of the country-

DOGS ON SHOW
FOR CHARITY
Noble Canines to Bring
Relief to Sick
Children.
The San Francisco Kennel
Club's Bench Show Opens
To- Morrow.
A Long List of Entriesâ Many Fancy
Animals Will Be
There.
To-morrow will ser the opening of
the San Francisco Dog Show, and it
behooves owners of dogs entered for
competition therein to roll up their
sleeves to-night, and by dint of elbow
grease and soap impart to the coats of
their canine friends that glossy finish
which attracts admiration outside the
magic ring and wins the ribbons and
medals inside it.
This Is the canine event of the year
on the coast, and will also be one of the
most important society events. The
fact that the proceeds will be devoted
to charity will draw crowds who would
otherwise never visit a bench show,
and the Four Hundred will turn out en
map.se. To judge by the number of en
tries made by the feminine leaders of
local society, the rage for doggy pets
must be strong in those circles.
The kennels of the Marquis of Lans
downe will be represented by one of the
finest specimens of Irish terrier ever
seen here, namely, Rodger, the property
of Miss Nellie Bingham.
Judging will commence promptly at 2
p. m., and any dog absent from his
stall when called will lose all right of
competition. Owners can take their
pets home after 10 p. m. by depositing
$5 as guarantee for their reappearance,
but the practice is to be deprecated,
as the animals will receive due care
and attention from the nightwatchman
employed by the San Francisco Kennel
Club.
Famous among the recent arrivals
are some Cocker spaniels from the
Swiss Mountain Kennels, Germantown,
Pa. Among- them is included the world
renowed "Banner Trilby," who has won
many prizes in Eastern exhibitions;
among them being the first prize in
the show at Washington, D. C, in 1897,
and at Grand Rapids in IS9B.
Superintendent Oldham says that the
best time to see thÂ» show is at the !
opening, because every owner will have i
his dog well groomed and well fed for j
his initiatory appearance. With the |
people In general the appearance of a
dog goes far, and an animal well taken
care of is apt to gain public favor over
his superior who has been neglected.
A big feature of the show will be a
grand parade of dogs who have won
prizes every day. The big fellows, St.
Bernards, mastiffs, Great Danes and
Russian hounds will be among the first
to be judged, and therefore will be in
that parade every day.
The sporting dogs, "the fighters," are
largely represented among the entries
and the lovers of the "pugnacious pup"
will find much to admire.

ELECTRIC LIGHT
JOB "WORKED"
Supervisors Accept the
Bid of the Big
Company.
Rivers Earns the Gratitude o'
the Monopoly for His
Work.
The NÂ»me of Balboa Boulevard
Changed 10 Commemorate the
Hero of Manila.
The Supervisors consummated the elec
tric light job yesterday by passing to
print an order awarding the San Fran
cisco Gas and Electric Company the con
tract for lighting public buildings for the
ensuing two years at 10 cents per 1000 watts
for buildings in the downtown district and
15 cents for the northern and O'Farrell
street police stations.
Supervisor Rivers had charge of the job.
and so stealthily and craftily did he per
form his work that nobody suspected the
finish was so near at hand until the mat
ter came up for action yesterday.
Six weeks ago The Call drew the atten
tion of the public to the gigantic robbery
that was about to be perpetrated, and
about the same time a rival electric light
company undertook to break in upon the
monopoly by guaranteeing to save the
city $40,000 a year if it were granted equal
facilities with its rival in the way of ex
tending its service to the outside districts.
The contract would expire on May 1,
and The Call repeatedly warned the Su
pervisors that if they intended to be hon
est with the taxpayers they would have
to act promptly in advertising for bids, in
order that the new company might pre
pare to enter upon its obligations in case
it waa awarded the contract. Attention
was also called to the proposal under
which the last contract was let. by the
terms of which competition was effect
ually choked off, and the Supervisors
were cautioned against repeating the
error.
The Supervisor from the Twelfth final
ly determined to bring the job to a close,
and soon after 9 o'clock last Friday morn
ing, before anybody who might interfere
reached the hall, Rivers and the other
members of the Street Lights Committee
met and opened the lone bid of the San
Francisco Gas and Electric Company, the
only concern that could bid under the
terms of the proposal, and quickly voted
to recommend its acceptance. The bids
for gas lighting were also opened and the
contract divided between the Pacific Gas
Improvement Company and the San Fran
cisco Gas and Electric Company, both
bidding the same, $1 50 per thousand feet.
Both recommendations were adopted
yesterday. and so the electric light steal
is perpetrated for two years more. But
the agitation brought about some good,
for the company reduced its rate from
11 to 10 cents, which is not bad consider
ing that it supplies private consumers for
5Vs cents. Perhaps it intends to set its
meters still faster and make up the dif
ference in that way. If it does it is not
likely to meet with any opposition from
Rivers and the other members of the ma
jority.
The Supervisors also passed the reso
lution changing the name of Balboa
boulevard to Dewey boulevard despite the
strong opposition of Clinton, who upon
final passage changed his vote from no
to aye, and gave notice of a motion to
reconsider next week.
The contract for printing the delinquent
tax list was laid ovrr for a week. The
Journal of Commerce, the lowest bidder,
had withdrawn its bid of 21 cents a name,
and the Supervisors regarded the bid of
the Report. 40 cents a name, as exorbi
tant. However. the majority voted
against advertising for new bids, al
though the Mayor showed there was am
ple time to do so, and next week the con
tract will undoubtedly be awarded.
The matter of the lease of the Sailors'
Home property was taken up again, and
JLackmanns motion renewing the lease to
the Ladies' Seaman's Friend Society pre
vailed.
The board adopted a resolution agree
ing to save the State from any costs that
may arise from the suit to be brought
against the Fidelity and Trust Company
of Maryland, to recover $100,000, the
amount of ex-Treasurer "Widber's bond
guaranteed by that company.
Expert Newman, of the Finance Com
mittee, was Instructed to examine the
records of the criminal departments of the
Superior Court for the purpose of aseer- |
taining the amounts still due witnesses
and jurors who have served since the
passage of the "fee bill."
Bills were received for the burial of In
digent dead as follows: Pacific Under
taking Company. $16 each; Joseph Hogan
& Co., $8 25; J. S. Godeau, $8 99; Edward
Kelly, $8 05; McAvoy & Co., $9 55.

HAS BLUNDERED
John Kelly, Alias Tyrell,
Allowed to Make His
Escape.
Walked Out of Judge Joachim
sen's Court About Ten
Days Ago.
The Police Are Now Scovxrino thÂ«
C ty to Find Him, but With
Sm.-tll Hope of Success.
Through somebody's blunder John
Kelly, alias Tyrell, a young "tough" 20
years of age, is enjoying his liberty
instead of being in the City Prison to
answer to several charges of battery
and robbery against him.
Kelly and Thomas Stanton were ar
rested 6n the night of April 29 by Po
liceman E. J. Thomson and C. T. Mer
chant; Kelly on two char.tr s of bat
tery, and Stanton on a charge of bat
tery and one of disturbing the peace.
The following day they were each
booked on a charge o* assault to com
mit robbery. The complaining witness
was John B. Rifi'o, a scavenger, and
he alleged that the defendants assault
ed him on his way home at Twenty
sixth street and Pan Jose avenue, and
after knocking him down and beating
him they attempted to rob him. He
yelled for help and they ran away.
A few days later a charge of petty
larceny was booked against Kelly, the
complaining witness being Antone
Bank. On that day the battery and
assault to rob cases were continued
till May 10 in Judge Joaehimsen's court.
The petty larceny cape against Kelly
came up for hf-arir.e in th a same court
on Saturday, May 7. and after listen
ing to the evidence the Judge dismissed
the case.
When the battery and assault to rob
cases were called on May 10 Kc.iy could
not be found. He should have been
in the prison, but he was not there.
Consternation prevailed arr.one: the at
taches of the court and the prison of
ficials. There was a hurried investi
gation, and then it dawned upon their
minds that when the case of petty
larceny was dismissed nsrainst Kelly he
was permitted to walk out of court.
Chief Lees was notified and since
then detectives and policemen in plain
clothes have been hunting for Kelly,
but he has not yet been found.
The cases were again called in court
yesterday morning, but ns Raffo, the
complaining witness, failed to appear
a continuance was given till the after
noon. He did not show ur> then, and
a continuance was granted till Wed
nesday, when it is hoped that Kelly
will be recaptured and Raffo will have
got over his disgust at Kelly being al
lowed to escape.
THE BUSH-STREET BOULEVARD.
A Meeting of Property-Owners to Ba
Held on Thursday Evening.
The property-owners on the line of Bush
street over which it was proposed to have
a boulevard are determined to fight the
issue to the last. As a precaution against
any snap judgment that may come from
the Supervisors on the 26th inst, at which
time the question will come up for final
consideration before that august body,
the property-owners are determined to
have their protest in in time. With this
view a meeting v. ill be held at the Went
worth Hotel, 617 Bush street, next Thurs
day evening, at which all of the owners
of property on the line of Bush street
opposed to the boulevard scheme will bo
present. In addition to the persons imme
diately interested, the Richmond District
Improvement Club, of which President C.
Hubhs is the chairman, will be present to
co-operate with the others in having the
street cut through the Laurel Hill Ceme
tery, tapping the Western Valley beyond
the" cemeteries.
The contention advanced by the Bush
street property-owners is to the e.ffect
that the street is not adapted for a boule
vard and that it is a scheme on the part
of the Sutter-str>>et Railroad Company to
have this done so as to prevent any other
proposed street railroad company from
obtaining a franchise over that thorough
fare.
Bush street in its present condition Is
not a business street, nor is it considered
to be fit for a boulevard above all otheo
things. It has no outlet which would
justify its being turned into a "mock
boulevard." In its present condition it i 3
nothing more nor less than a cul-de-sac,
and as such it will remain until an open
ing is had at its western terminus.
Held for Grand Larcsny.
J. B. Johnson, from Arizona, who was
accused of robbing Georgpe Russell, an
old rancher, of $GOO and thon takinp him
to Eureka and dumping him there, wag
yesterday held to answer before the Su
perior Court by Judge Joachimsen His
bonds were fixed at $2000.

A YELLOW HOLD-UP.
A PICTURE published in the Examiner of
yesterday afforded the thoughtful a brief
season of delight. It represented the cap
â¢tain of an English vessel as having climbed
Srno the rigging, from which point of vantage
lie was actively displaying the Union Jack, the em
blem, doubtless owing to the gentleman's agitation,
being upside down. As the ship was provided with
jnasts and halyards there should have been some ex
planation of the extraordinary method adopted by the
captain. As a rule the British captain does not shin
fcloft, and he certainly would not do so for the pur
pose of accomplishing that which could better have
been done in a manner wholly sane and having the
sustaining approval indicated by numerous prece- !
'dents. But no wonder the captain was scared. He !
had been approached by a Journal-Examiner dispatch
boat, and, as the yellow tail of that combination states,
expected to be held up. Such thought on, his part was
perfectly natural, founded upon a just estimate, and
does credit to the intelligence of the captain. How
ever, no man with so keen an insight into depravity
â¢would have been guilty of not knowing how to use
the Union Jack. The suspicion that the Examiner
correspondent has been lying again projects itself into
(amd saddens the mind.
THE HALL OF JUSTICE.
OWNERS of property in the portion of the city
where a hole has been dug in the ground for
the ostensible purpose of building a new Hall
f)f Justice, are reported to be preparing to make an
*>ther effort to hasten the completion of the building.
In the past they have appealed to the contractors, the
SU"chitect and the Supervisors in vain. This time they
Jurn their thoughts to the prospect of a new Grand
Jury, and when that body has been organized will
jendeavor to get it to redress the wrong that has been
Jdone them by the long delay in constructing the
jfedifice.
According to reports a count made of the persons
4fet work on the structure last week showed that there
(were employed one bricklayer, two ironworkers and
& boy. With such a force the progress made is, of
*ourse, so slight that the work is hardly more than
JU pretense. In fact it is not a decent pretense, for it
l^does not promise anything, and it would seem that
ifhe object of those in authority is not so much to
jfclelude the people into the belief that work is being
idone as to show them by this mockery how little
they care what the public thinks, or what the property
Owners say.
The manner in which the construction of the build-
Ing has been delayed, in spite of repeated protests,
ifcvould be a farce if it were not a scandal. Again and
fegain a time has been fixed when the building should
ike completed, and again and again the Supervisors
Slave extended the time. The hall should have been
{â¢finished and in thb hands of the city for occupation
frears ago. There has never been any cause for delay
Â»n account of a lack of money, of workmen, or of
(jtnaterial. All these have been at the disposal of the
in abundant quantities. The delay and
i*the dawdling have been as wanton as they have been
jthameful and wasteful. The whole affair has been an
,;offense to every citizen who has any regard for either
!|he honor or the interests of the municipality.
It is hardly worth while to go over again the old
[task of getting the subject investigated by the Super
visors. It is not worth while to ask any more prom
ises from the contractors or the architect. The prop
erty owners of the vicinity are right. The next appeal
must be to a Grand Jury. There must be fraud in
$uch an outrageous delay as this. It surpasses credul
ity to accept the glib statement that in this day and
generation a building of that size and character hon
estly requires as long a time to construct as was con
turned by the Pharaohs in building the Pyramids.
It appears that the Spanish had thoughtfully put
(double crews aboard their ships at Manila in order to
Jiave sailors ready to take charge of Dewey's ships
as soon as the white flag had been run up. The
Spanish were, in fact, prepared for any emergency ex
cept the one they ran across.
There will be general approval of the determina
tion of the authorities at Washington to let Sampson
Â£nd Schley use their own judgment. Each is sup
posed to have a good quality of this and the guns to
back it.
The suggestion is offered to Spain for what it is
that Weyler be garroted as a traitor to his
country.
It is not often that great fleets put in weeks playing
C game of "hide and go seek."
OUR EXPANDING POWER.
ONE of the most notable effects produced by
the war upon the American people has been
the expansion of the popular ideal regarding
the destiny of the nation. Prior to the outbreak of
hostilities the average American was content with the
isolation .of this country from the affairs of all parts
of the world outside the two American continents
and their adjacent islands. To-day we have broader
ideas. Even the most conservative papers treat
Dewey's victory at Manila as the first step in a new
career that is destined to make the United States a
world power of prime magnitude and far-reaching
influence.
The Philadelphia Inquirer, in an elaborate edi
torial nearly two columns in length and double lead
ed to give it emphasis in every word, announces itself
strongly in favor of the expanded ideal. It says:
"Come! we have progressed, and progress has
brought its invincible changes â changes that can no
more be turned back than the swift current of Niagara,
to use an old but most forcible simile, can be dammed
in its irresistible progress to the lake. We still stand
by the Monroe Doctrine so far as foreign invasion of
the two American continents is concerned, but we
have arrived at a time when that doctrine must be
broadened. There is no longer a reason why our in
fluence should not be exerted all around the world."
The impulse given to the new conception of our
national destiny by the war is increased by commer
cial considerations. The coincidence of events has
brought about this war and the victory in the Orient
just at a time when our merchants and manufacturers
have been disturbed lest the threatened partition of
China by the European powers should deprive us of
our rightful share of that vast market for our manu
factured goods. Commerce is even more expansive
than war itself, and the needs of trade not less potent
ly than the pride of victory incline us to extend our
influence and power to every part of the globe where
there is likely to be any considerable market for the
products of our soil and the articles made by the
skill of our workingmen.
We are of necessity forced to look for trade ex
pansion in China. That populous empire is a near
neighbor of California. From San Francisco to
Hongkong there is a free, broad pathway across the
ocean, by which we can gain cheap access to that
vast field which is now the most promising in the
world for commerce. We cannot permit our present
and future interests there to be sacrificed to Euro
pean greed. In spite of ourselves we are forced to
take part in the responsibilities of the larger destinies
of the world. We do not seek for conquest. We have
no desire to assume the government of the mongrel
races of the Philippines. Nevertheless we cannot any
longer restrict our energies to the American hemis
phere. We will emerge from this war a world power
with a world commerce whether we wish it or not.
THE PROPOSED STATE FUSION.
THE Populists are feeling their oats. They have
many of the county officers all over the State.
In Alameda they have the best offices â Sheriff,
Treasurer and Assessor. Elsewhere they did quite
well in the election of 1894, and find themselves now
in a position to raise funds by assessment of their
office-holders. This levy was ordered at the last
meeting of their State committee, which took up the
subject of fusion with the Democrats and silver Re
publicans on the State, county and Congressional
tickets. This question brought on a struggle and
convulsion that lasted from 8 p. m. Tuesday to 2:30
a. m. Wednesday, with the result that it was agreed to
fuse provided the Fresno example were followed and
the other two parties to this political polygamy
adopted the particular expression of Populism known
as the Oregon platform.
The committee declared that this is a good year to
tone up on principles, and that any union or amalga
mation of the forces of reform must be upon the
Populist platform.
Quoting exact language, the committee say that the
Populist party "demand of such other political forces
desiring unity of action that said parties by their
proper conventions first agree and adopt an identical
or common platform of principles which all candi
dates desiring the support of any of said parties must
accept, and that adoption of such common platform
must precede any and all nominations."
The committee then ordered a referendum to all
Populist county conventions upon this question:
"Shall there be a union of the People's party of
California in 1898 with any other party or parties for
the nomination of a joint ticket, provided that such
parties shall first agree to the following platform of
principles?"
The platform follows, and is made up of all the
Populist ideas, fiat money and scoop-shovel distribu
tion of the same direct to the people by the Federal
Government being the most prominent.
It remains to be seen whether the Democratic party
of California will surrender its individuality and be
content to trot along under the Populist wagon. The
silver Republicans are the political mules of the State,
with some pride of ancestry but no hope of posterity,
and may be glad to eat thistles, even, in the Populist
corral.
Theamusing part of the situation is thatif the Demo
cracy chase office through such fusion it surrenders
its identity, and though it pray toward Jefferson and
Jackson, it will be in the fix of the Christians whose
conversion to Mahomet had been perfected, by the
Abrahamic rite and all, who were caught counting
their beads again. Their Mahometan brethren
laughed at them, for they had been sealed to the
Prophet and were wasting their prayers.
No matter what the result may be one must respect
the Populists. They have seen and smelled the car
rion-like scandals in a Democratic Board of Super
visors and Board of Education in this city. They
have seen the new ferry clock trying to get one hand
behind its back by force of example set by the Har
bor Commission. They Have seen the exposure of
the jute-bag manipulation by the Prison Directors.
They have seen the rainbow of Democratic promise,
and where it touched the earth they have found cor
ruption so vile that the buzzards fly from it to the
garbage dumps to get a breath of fresh air, and they
don't propose to keep such company unless it is put
under bonds of some kind, and from their stand
point what better promise of reform can this particu
lar "reform force" make than by swallowing the Pop
ulist platform?
While there has been surprise at the apparent lack
of haste in getting men started for Manila it must be
remembered that the army on this coast is bound
and swathed in red tape. When an officer cannot fur
nish a shirt to a recruit without first asking Wash
ington speed is difficult.

Loti was not consulted before Dewey broke loose has

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 17, 1898.
SALARIES OF SCHOOL TEACHERS.
IN a communication to The Call Joseph O'Connor,
who represented the School Department upon the
Board of Freeholders which framed the proposed
charter, declares that the limit placed upon the
amount which may be expended under that instru
ment for teachers' salaries works ij} only one direc
tion. That is to say, he holds that the charter-makers
fixed a minimum for a maximum amount for school
salaries. According to his notion the salary fund may
exceed $28 per pupil but shall not be less than that
amount.
If it were the intention of the Freeholders to fix a
minimum, they have adopted a very strange method
of expressing themselves. Subdivision 9 of Sec. I,
Chapter 3, Article 7 of the proposed charter gives the
Board of Education power "to provide for the prompt
payment, on not later than the fifth day of every
month, of all salaries due and allowed officers, teach
ers and other employes of the School Department.
For this purpose the Auditor shall annually segre
gate so much of the Common School Fund as shall
not exceed twenty-eight dollars for each pupil in
average daily attendance in the Public Schools of the
City and County during the preceding fiscal year.
The amount so segregated shall not be applied to
the payment of any demand against such Common
School Fund during any fiscal year other than for
salaries, until all salaries for that fiscal year have been
fully paid and provided for. The Board shall ascertain
and transmit to the Auditor on or before the first Mon
day in April of each year an estimate of the amount
required for such segregation within such limit of
twenty-eight dollars."
ft is true, as Mr. O'Connor says, that this para
graph does not declare in terms against the expendi
ture of more than $28 per pupil for salaries, but it
establishes a salary fund and so provides the only
money which may be expended for that purpose. If
the Freeholders intended to fix the minimum amount
which may be disbursed by the Board of Education
for salaries they have made a blunder. Mr. O'Connor
ought to be familiar with the legal rule of construc
tion, "expressio unius, exclusis alterius" â the state
ment of one thing is the exclusion of another. Apply
this rule to the paragraph quoted. Therein the Free
holders have established a salary fund. Can it be
possible that they intended to grant the Board of
Education power to establish another? If they did
so intend why did they not say so? Is it not plain
that taxes for school purposes are fixed at Â§32 50 per
pupil, of which $28 per pupil and no more shall be
expended for salaries?
On their face the figures of Expert Williams are
correct. The average daily attendance of pupils has
not varied for three years. In 1895 it was 33,019, in
1896 33.508 and in 1897 33.531. At $32 50 per pupil
the latter figures would give the School Department
an appropriation of $1,089,757. The appropriation for
1897-98 was $r, 200,000. There is here plainly a reduc
tion of $110,243. The amount which may be expended
in salaries under the charter at $28 per pupil at the
same average attendance will be $938,868. The
amount expended last year was $1,112,320. The re
duction in teachers' salaries is therefore $173,452. If
our construction of the salary limit is correct there
is no escape from these figures.
A BOOM FOR SHIPBUILDERS.
THE war thus far has been not only a glory for
American arms, but an advertisement of the
highest value and widest fame for American
shipbuilders. The fact that Dewey's fleet passed
through a long battle against both ships and forts
without suffering serious damage is an unmistakable
proof of the excellence with which the ships and their
engines were constructed. Foreign nations that may
hereafter desire more warships than they can build at
their own yards will naturally be inclined lo have
them constructed at the yards and by the builders
whose work was shown at Manila to be of such sub
stantial and battle-proof character.
In addition to the increased orders for ships of war
there will be also a large increase in orders for mer
chant vessels. The American Economist estimates
that the purchase by the Government of vessels for
war purposes equals in the aggregate a transfe- of
100,000 tons of carrying capacity from private hands
to the nation. This in itself makes a large gap in the
merchant marine of the country, and the gap of course
must be speedily filled to meet the commercial de
mand.
Commenting upon the work required to fill the
gap the Economist says: For the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1897, the total iron and steel steam tonnage
built on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts amounted to
21,586. It would therefore require nearly five years
of construction at the same rate to make good the
withdrawals of ships for Government uses.
This estimate, it will be seen, is based on the con
struction of shipping on the Atlantic and the Gulf
coasts only. It does not include Pacific coast work.
It is therefore clear that the estimate of five years as
the time required to fill the gap made in our merchant
marine by the Government purchases is erroneous.
With the increase of orders for new ships the capaci
ties and capabilities of our shipping yards will in
crease, and it will go hard indeed with us if our Cali
fornia shipbuilders do not perform a large part of the
work required.
In addition to the construction of warships and the
vessels needed to supply the present demand in the
mercantile marine there is likely to be a further im
petus given to American shipbuilding by the adoption
of laws which will give the industry a degree of pro
tection equal to that given to others. The Republican
party Is pledged to that policy, and the enactment of
such legislation may be looked for as one of the not-
able accomplishments of this administration. Taken
altogether, therefore, the outlook for our shipbuilders
is better than it has been for years, and, as San Fran
cisco has large capital and thousands of men engaged
In the industry, we may expect to receive no incon
siderable local benefits from the work that seems so
certain to come.
The Spanish Governor of the Philippines is said to
have been given authority to inaugurate such reforms
as may seem to him to be necessary. It is believed,
however, that the Governor is seriously handicapped
by the presence of a determined gentleman named
Dewey, who has a plan of reform already outlined.
The women who have taken hold of Red Cross
work in this city are simply wonders. They do not
know what it is to weary in well doing. If they want
anything they ask for it, and as yet they have met
nobody who manifests the least inclination to refuse.
The fact that war is costing a million dollars a day
ought to be an argument in favor of pushing it to an
end. It is generally admitted now that the Spanish
are beyond moral suasion.
It is pleasing to read that preparations for the re
lief of Dewey are "being rushed with great haste."
No ordinary observer would have suspected it

HOLDING OF THE PHILIPPINES.
If, therefore, we are going Into the col-
on'zing business we must make up our
minds to groan under the burdens of
crushing taxation, for a great standing
army and a great fleet are necessary to
the very life of the country if we are to
change "off to that policy.â Richmond (Va.)
Times.
When all of the conditions which make
for anarchy In these Islands are under
stood; when the press and public come to
see the enormous price we should have
to pay for a great military, civil and na
val establishment to govern the inhabit
ants without suffrage of any kind, it is to
be hoped that public opinion will harden
against the hazardous experiment of har
monizing with American democracy a
colonial system of the inevitable Astatic
type. â Buffalo Commercial.
There appear but two courses which we
can consistently pursue. One Is to return
the islands to Spain after the war has
been concluded, and the other is to give
the people there who have been in revolt
against Spanish tyranny an opportunity
to set up a stable independent govern
ment. The war we are engaged in Is for
humanity's sake, not conquest.âPhila
delphia Public Ledger.
The United States must take her place
as one of the active dominating forces
among the powers of the earth. Send an
army of 30,000 men, white or black, or
both, to the Philippines. Rebuild the Ca
vite fort. Fortify the harbor so that we
can hold it against all comers. Appoint
a military Governor, or a civil one, if you
will, until we have enough Americans
there to vote and carry on our own form
of government. Some of the other powera
may hem and haw a little at first, but
they will get used to it before we get
through.â Kansas City World.
It may be, as we said yesterday, that
we shall have to hold the islands per
manently. But the necessity should be
clear. It looks now as though they would
be either English or American. In the
meantime we shall have t" govern them
as best we can.â lndianapolis News.
That we shall be a factor henceforth is
recognized by the thoughtful English and
European journals, and this recognition
calls for a display of diplomatic force in
Washington. We are not ambitious to
dominate the world by might, but we do
believe that our peaceful trade relations
should not be ignored, and the possession
of the Philippines will give us a position
such as we have never occupied. There
is no hurry. When peace comes we shall
take up the peaceful topics of commerce,
and diplomacy will then De relied upon.â
Philadelphia Inquirer.
It looks very much as though this coun
try would have to retain possession of
these islands, and provide a stable gov
ernment there. The consequences of war
have placed these islands In our hands,
and no matter hojw undesirable or trou
blesome they may be, we must make the
best of them. We have not gone into this
policy with the spirit of imperialism. Im
perialism seems to be forced upon us.â
Utica (N. V.) Observer.
It Is hardly too much to say that the
national policy ha 3 witnessed a radical
change Blnce the Cuban war began.
Foreign ports will be acquired in the
eastern and western worlds; a navy suf
ficient to command the respect and in
spire the fear of the greatest European
power will be created and maintained.
We are not at all likely to enter upon a
policy of territorial acquisition, but
rather of "commercial expansion. We
want American Influence to be felt In
every port and every capital. We want
the United States to be in fact the great
est nation on earth.â Fresno Republican.
To the United States, In a commercial
sense, tlie benefits that will accrue from
acquisition of the Philippines can hardly
be overestimated. The cities of the Pa
cific Coast would be first to feel the bene
fit, and In virtue of relative contiguity
should secure a very great proportion of
the traffic that will grow up between the
islands and their protector, the Govern
ment of the United States.â Seattle Dally
Times.
It Is conceded by the European powers
that the United States has the right, if
she chooses to exercise it, to retain pos
session of the Philippine Islands. The
only advantage possession would give us
would be a base of supplies in the far
Pacific In case of another war; but out
lying possessions of that character are
usually very expensive In times of peace
and may become a source of weakness
rather than of strength In time of war.â

There will soon be a radical change in
this situation. The United States will be
in a position to challenge Europe for com
mercial supremacy in countries on the
other side of the Pacific. The American

get it."â Greater Los Angeles.

There is a possibility that the United

who urge that we should annex them per

Our country should come out of this
fight without the suspicion even of being
a land grabber. We can afford to give

dizement that we seek and light for, but
humane and civilized government and

The argument f that the United States
would add to their puissance among the
powers by the annexation of Hawaii has
not been strengthened by Commodore
Dewey's victory and the practical pos
session of the Philippines. The fact is
that the nation without islands is getting
the better of the nation that possesses
them. Spain's islands furnish points or
attack for her enemies. By putting our
selves in the position which Spain now
occupies by seizing and holding her >vest

THE REICHSTAG ELECTIONS.
The German Government has at last
made the official announcement of the
date of the general elections. It is fixed
for June 16. The delay in setting the day
is said to be owing to the hope that the
Conservative factions mlgnt agree upon
some formidable course against the grow
ing power of the Socialists. However, no
tangible union has been possible between
those who oppose the Socialist party, as
their Interests lie in such opposed quart
ers. The present Reichstag, which was
elected June 15, 1893, goes out of office
June 15, IS9S, hence the Government
placed the day of the new elections as
distant as possible. A majority vote <Â»
required to elect a member *.o the Reich
stag, and as in many constituencies there
are three or four candidates in the field,
it is quite likely that not more than 2uo
out of the 397 Deputies will at once have
seats. The seats where no majorities
have been obtained will be contested a
fortnight later in the Stichwahlen. As
has been said before, the Socialists ex
pect to increase their number of seats
from 48 to 70. But the Agrarian Reac
tionary Association is spending a great
deal of money and has placed candidates
in 250 constituencies. If the Conservative
landowners can elect only 100 of these
they will be able on certain questions .to
manipulate a majority against the yon
Hohenlohe Government, which will force
the Chancellor to retire \inless tho Em
peror comes to his rescue with the im
perial prerogative.
BOATS OF HIGH SPEED.
The Russian Government has ordered
of a British firm two 3S-knot torpedo
boats on the model of the Turbinia, and
propelled with turbine motors working: on
four shafts, each of which carries three
propellers. This is eight knots faster than
the fastest torpedo-boat destroyers in the
British navy. Just how much courage is
required on the part of the naval archi
tect who signs his name to a contract for
a 38-knot boatâ thirty-eight knots is forty
four miles an hour â is evident from a
comparison of figures. The 300-ton "de
stroyers" require 6000 horse-power to drive
them at thirty knots an hour. At these
high speeds the resistance of the water
increases as something more than the
cube of the speed. The cube of thirty
eight is more than double the cube of
thirty, and hence the 6000 horse-power of
a 300-ton destroyer would have to be
raised to over 12,000 to enable her to catch
one of the new torpedo-boats. But 12,000
horse-power reciprocating engines of the
common type, with the necessary boiler
and coal, would sink a 300-ton torpedo
boat, supposing they could Da Btowed
away in her hold. Evidently, then, a
sped of thirty-eight knots involves a radi
i-al change in the accepted methods of
propulsion. â Scientific American.
SOME CUBAN PILOTS.
Here are some facts about the Cuban
pilots who are engaged upon the vessels
of the American blockading squadron in
Cuban waters:
Captain Charles Silva, one of the Cuban
pilots of the New York, has had a decid
edly interesting career. For twelve years
he has been a pilot in Cuban and Florida
waters. He is a Cuban sympathizer of
the most pronounced type, and holds a
commission as captain in the insurgent
army. For many months he was em
ployed as pilot of filibustering expedi
tions and proved quite successful. He
piloted the Dauntless, Three Friends.
Bermuda, Larada and other famous fili
busters. He made twenty-seven trips
to the island in that way, and was chased
by United States revenue cutters nearly
every time. Three times he was captured
and triedâtwice at Jacksonville and once
in Key West. He was acquitted, a fact
he relates with a knowing wink. Early
this year he went to Cuba and joined
the insurgent army, with the rank of
captain, spending two months and fifteen
clays in the service. As a pilot for fili
busters he made $155 per month, but
now he gives his service to the Govern
ment for a mere pittance. When pros
pect of war breaking out became assured
the Cuban Junta a: New York sent for
him, and he entered their employ. He
was taken down to Washington and
offered to Secretary Long as an experi
enced pilot. The secretary had Silva'3
record carefully investigated, and becom
ing satisfied of his usefulness, gave him
letters to Admiral Sampson. He was at
once taken aboard and has served faith
fully In the blockade work. Juan Santos,
the other Cuban pilot aboard the New
York, is a great friend of Silva. The two
served together quite frequently on fili
bustering expeditions.
THE ASTUTE WHiSTLER.
While Whistler was at West Point,
there was, in addition to the regular cadet
mess, a private mess for twelve, of whom
Whistler was one, at the house of an
army officer's widow. One day the cadets
conceived the idea of having a little sport
at the landlady's expense. The first cadet
who came to the table said, as he sat
down. "Good morning. Mrs. . There
is a cat on the roof of your house." The
second cadet repeated the remark, except
that he varied "it by saying. "There are
two cats on the roof of your house.
Each cadet added a cat, until, when
Whistler, who was the last to arrive, sat
down, he said gravely and with much
concern, "Good morning Mrs. -" .
There are twelve cats on tne roof of your
house." During the next meal Whistler
found under his napkin a billet notifying
him that his presence at the mess was no
longer desired. Being, however, averse
to returning to the general mess. Whist
ler hit upon a plan to regain the widow's
good will. After dinner he planted him
self in front of a portrait of her late
lamented, which hung in the parlor, and
appeared lost in admiration of it. When
he heard the widow entering he began
descanting, as if to himself, yet loud
enough for hÂ«-r to hear, upon the virtues
of the deceased, winding up with this
exclamation; "To think that West Point
should have produced stich a man, and
that we have his portrait here to remind
us of what we ourselves may attain to'"
This touched the widow so deeply that
Whistler was re-established in her good
graces â and the mess. â Chap Book.

A MATTER OF CHOICEâ L. M. J..
City. This correspondent asks: "Has an
alien, who is not a citizen of the Unlteu
States, the right to claim his son, born
in the United States and who is of age,
as a foreign subject?" The answer to
that question is that after the age of
majority has been attained by a boy, and
21 is the age of majority in the United
States, the father loses parental control
over his son. In the case cited the boy
is a native of the United States and a
citizen thereof by virtue of his nativity,
but on attaining his majority he could
elect whether he would be a citizen of tho
United States or a citizcr of the country
to which the father owes allegiance.
After the boy had attained his majority
the father could not claim him as a cit
izen of a foreign country, as the choice
of citizenship is purely a personal priv
ilege.

parts or degrees. In the others the
freezing point is zero, but the boiling
point is SO degrees and 100 degrees re
spectively. It is easy to reduce from
one of these scales to another, thus:
What is the centigrade reading for 77 de
grees Fahrenheit" The numbers in the
Fahrenheit scale are all too great by 32.
because 32 degrees and not 0 degree
stands for the freezing point; subtract
this 32 from 77 and there is 4n. Hence the
required number of centigrade degrees
must bear the same ratio to the 100 from
freezing to boiling in that scale that the
45 bear to the ISS degrees between the
same limits in Fahrenheit. Similar pro
cess as to the Reaumur scale.

SCIENTISTS BARRED OUT.
Apropos of the recent meeting in Wash
ington of the National Academy of Sci
ences, Dr. Marcus Benjamin says in the
Scientific American: "That such eminent
scientists as David A. Wells and Edward
Atkinson among economists, David Starr
Jordan and Henry F. Osborn among nat
uralists. Daniel G. Brlnton and Franz
Boas among ethnologists and William
Harkness and James E. Keeler among as

emy is a most unfortunate fact."

General Merriam Ready to Announce the
Disposition of the Assembling
Troops.
The Charleston Preparing to Sail To-night- Generous
Gift Made to the Volunteers by H. F.
Fortman.
Important orders relating to the I
detail of troops for the Manila ex- ]
pedition have been prepared by
Major-General Merriam, but he has
decided that they ought not to be
ruade public before General Otis,
U. S. A., is seen and consulted. When
the two leaders confer and exchange
views some changes may be suggest- i
cd. It is believed that the Four
teenth United States Infantry, four I
troops of the Fourth United States
Cavalry and. two regiments of Cali
fornia Volunteer Infantry will be i
embraced in the troops of the First
.^vision of the Manila Army Corps.
Several batteries of the Third United
States Artillery may go with the
first column for the Philippines.
General Merriam expected to meet
General Otis last night, but the lat- j
ter had not arrived ac a late hour.
General H. C. Merriam, comtnanding
the departments of California and the
Columbia, arrived from Vancouver Bar
racks yesterday morning. He was ac
::nied by First Lieutenant John B.
Bennett, Seventh United States Infan
try, aid and engineer officer. The arrival
of the commanding general is timely, as'
it was very clear to the common ci
vilian mind that the presence of some
one in unquestioned authority was
needed in San Francisco. It is non
sense to say that everything has been
going along with the precision of clock
work. In the best regulated military
machine there is bound to be a slip
now and then, but there have been a
good many slips since the troops were
ordered to this station. It is common
talk among army officers that Major-
General Miles or Secretary Alger, in
preparing for the Manila expedition
simply instructed an officer at this sta
tion to engage transportation for Ma
nila. It was not explained whether
the transportation was designed for use
nt Manila or to carry troops and sup
plies thither. There was no limit to
the volume or no designation of the
kind of transportation required. Under
the order the officer might have en
gaged transportation for one hundred
: â â¢ twenty thousand.
Word comes from the East that the
< rovenunent is buying mules in Balti
more for the Department of California.
The mules can be bought here for about
the cost of shipping them across the
continent.
Great delight is expressed in naval
and military circles over the news from
â Washington that President McKinley
has abolished the Board of Strategy
and relieved Schiey and Sampson from
irritating and confusing instructions.
Now if the right kind of a soldier could
be placed at the head of the army the
work of organizing and equipping the
troops would go forward with military
precision. A vast number of people
fancy that either Alger or Miles should
be abolished and quite a good many
entertain the opinion that the country
could spare both for a prolonged vaca
tion or until the termination <>f hostili
ties. The war may not develop a
Grant, a Sherman or Sheridan in the
first campaign, but the right man will
no doubt come forward at the proper
time.
The troops encamped at the Presidio
v.-ili read the following announcement
â¢with satisfaction:
San Francisco, May 16, 1898.
Lieutenant J. E. Nolan,
Fourth United States Cavalry,
Post Commissary Officer, Presi
dio â Dear Sir: Believing that
canned salmon would prove a
welcome addition to the army
rations, we take the liberty of
sending you 4800 cans of King
salmon, which you will please
distribute among the troops at
your post.
Messrs. Gray Bros, of this
city have kindly agreed for the
transportation of the goods to
your commissary store. Yours
truly,
Alaska Packers' Association,
HENEY F. FORTMANN.
President.
Mr. Fortmann's patriotic generosity
â will surely be appreciated by. all the
regular and volunteer soldiers on the
Presidio reservation. The prodigality
of the offering insures a supply for
every enlisted man and .commissioned
officer of the entire command. In this
banquet of salmon the three arms of
the service â artillery, infantry and cav
alryâare the welcome guests of Henry
Fortmann, whose example should
speak to other leading- citizens of San
Francisco.
The hope is expressed that some
steps will be taken by the people of
San Francisco to give the Colorado,
Minnesota, Nebraska, Kansas, Utah,
Wyoming and Dakota troops a good,
hot, substantial meal on their arrival
In this town after a fatiguing journey
by rail across the mountains and des
ert. The officers of the army who
ought to be advised as to the number
of men coming and the time of their
errival had not up to last night been
bo advised. It is probable that the
regiments on leaving their respective
points of rendezvous inform the author
ities in Washington of their departure,
but there does not seem to be sufficient
intelligence or system in Washing-ton
to Impart such information to the mili
tary authorities here. The troops
would be properly cared for on their
arrival in San Francisco If Governor
Budd, Mayor Phelan or the Red Cross
Society were informed concerning the
movement of trains carrying the regi
ments.
So far as The Call can now judge
from conflicting reports the Wyoming
battalion of infantry, consisting of
eleven officers and 326 enlisted men,
will arrive here late to-night or early
to-morrow morning. Two companies of
the Fourteenth United States Infantry
Should arrive here from Portland early
Thursday morning. Two battalions of
the Second Regiment of Oregon volun
teer Infantry left Portland last evening
fend will get here Wednesday morning..
It is said that the Nebraska troops will
arrive here next Friday.
Yesterday Major McCarthy, brigade
surgeon of volunteers, detailed Dr.
Rethers of the First 'and Dr. Robley of
the Seventh California for duty at the
brigade hospital. lieutenant-Colonel
Duboce of the First California yester
day made application to have the
troops paid before their departure for
Manila, There is a good chance of suc
cess in the enterprise.
Adjutant-General A. W. Barrett of
California yesterday received a mes
sage from "General H. C. Merriam of
the Department of California and the
Columbia requesting that 554 new uni
forms, the property of the State, be
turned over to the heavy artillery <->f
California Volunteers and made a
charge against United States. Upon
the receipt of the message General
Barrett proceeded to comply with the
request, and the uniforms will be
turned over to the heavy artillery to
day.
Lieutenant Sydney A. Cloman, I . P.
A. chief commissary of the expedition
to the Philippine Islands, has already
commenced making preparations for
the laying in of stores for feeding the
troops to Manila, and says that so far
as his department is concerned there
will be no delay in sailing, as every
precaution will be taken to have the
supplies ready in time.
CAMP ROUTINE
AFTER THE RAIN
A Battalion of Wyoming
Volunteers May Ar
rive To-Night.
When reveille sounded in the camp at
i the Presidio yesterday there was every
prospect of the soldiers having to endure
another day of rain, but the wind spransr
!up from the "West and scattered the
I clouds that threatened a continuation of
the night's downpour. By night that
portion of the cavalry parade ground
i where are pitched the tents was in a fair
jly good condition. The camps were given
a thorough system of drainage by the
means of ditches dug along the company
i streets, so that the only water to be seen
! was in the large ponds along the north
ern edge of the camp by tne side of the
bay.
T"he signal corps held Its first drill yes
terday. Colonel Miles, division signal
officer, Is very anxious to organize the
corps and recruit it up to forty men, tak
ing an equal amount of men. from the
First and Seventh Regiments.
Lieutenant John M. Neall of the Fourth
United States Cavalry has been notified
by Major Field that a battalion of Wy
oming volunteers left Cneyenne Sunday
for San Francisco. The battalion should
arrive here to-day. He was also further
notified late in the afternoon that the
First Regiment of Nebraska volunteers
left Lincoln at 4 o'clock yesterday after
noon. The regiment â will arrive here
Friday. Lieutenant Neall has as yet re
ceived no instructions as to where the
men are to camp, but in all probability
they will be located upon the slope south
of the cavalry parade grounds.
Major McCarthy has been notified by
Major Field, U. S. A., of his official ap
pointment as brigade surgeon.
The representatives of the Red Cross
Society made a donation to the First
Regiment yesterday of forty packages of
standard novels.
The band of the Seventh Regiment was
examined yesterday and sworn in. The
surgeons of the First, Seventh and Sixth
Regiments were busy yesterday examin
ing the muster rolls for the purpose of a
final certification as to the physical con
dition of the men before forwarding the
rolls to Major Field.
Lieutenant Cloman. U. S. A., has re
ceived Instructions from the War De
partment at Washington to see that the
troops going to Manila are supplied with
fresh meat. Lieutenant Cloman will carry
along with the troops many heads of
noat. Lieutenant Cloman will carry
with the troops many heads of
steers and sheep, as well as fowls.
General Merriam, accompanied by Ma
jor White, made an informal visit to camp
about 2:30 o'clock yesterday afternoon
just to take a look at things and see how
affairs were running. If the general had
any information as to when the first
troops will leave for Manila he kept it
secreted up his sleeve. He would commit
himself by no statements whatsoever,
although he looked exceedingly wise.
hen ho reached the camp â¢ and
as soon tas the fact that he
was on the grounds was generally
known Colonels Smith and Johnson called
to informally pay their respects. General
Merriam and Colonel Smith Went over to
the camp of the Fourteenth Infantry,
where they were received most cordially
by. Major Robe. The officers witnessed
the battalion drill of the Fourteenth,
which was then in progress.
General Merriam expressed himself as
much pleased with the camp and the way
that it was being conducted. He and Ma
jor White made an extensive and thor
ough examination of the Presidio grounds
with the view of finding suitable locations
for the troops that are yet to arrive. The
officers of the troops now encamped at
the Presidio will call upon the general to
day for the purpose of paying their for
mal respects.
Private Sanfred Sanderson of Company
C of the Fourteenth Infantry, who was
arrested for. discharging his gun in camp
last week, was tried yesterday and sen
tenced to fifteen days' hard work and to
lose one month's pay.
Rev. Alfred L. Brewer, an old friend of
Major Robe, called upon that officer yes
terday to renew the friendship of their
youth, which was begun forty years ago
They were seated In front of the major's
tent talking over old times when a lady,
accompanied by a volunteer corporal and
a young lady, came up and asked Rev.
Mr. Brewer if he would go with them to
the Presidio chapel and baptize the young
soldier. This the clergyman gladly con
sented to do, and the beautifully "sacred
ceremony was performed with only Major
Robe, the mother and the young lady as
witnesses.
Lieutenant Hunt, the recruiting officer
of the Fourteenth Infantry, is getting in
new men for his command every day
While the men are not enlisting as rap
idly as had been expected or desired, yet
the lieutenant is in hopes of securing
enough recruits to fill up the two skele
ton companies and make the two new j
companies that it is the Intention of the
Government to add to the Fourteenth.
The two companies of the Fourteenth
that have been ordered here from Alaska
will probably reach San Francisco and
go into camp here about the last of this
Major McCarthy was In the city yes
terday In consultation with the chief med
ical officers' department, and he made ar
rangement for three months' supplies of
medicine. Acting under orders from
Major White, > Major McCarthy-, yesterday
Issued an order to the regimental sur
geons instructing them to send their chief
hospital steward to Fort Mason every

aration and uses of papers Jn the United
States - army medical department â¢ service.
Health Officer: A. P. O'Brien of San

tation, and as an additional surgeon was j
allowed the regiment, he decided to en- j
list and link his fortunes with the Man
i|a expedition. His office will be tempo- j
rarily lllled during his absence.
It was expected that the two other bat
tallons of the First Regiment of Oregon :
Volunteers will arrive here this week.
Colonel Yoran said yesterday that he
thought that Colonel Summers had
left Portland last night, and in that
case the battalions should arrive in San
Francisco to-morrow or Thursday.
Corporal Nicholson of Company B has
been presented with a very handsome
gold medal by his former employers, New
man & L,evinson.
The life insurance men have been in
festing the camp like the busy bee around
the bung hole of a molasses barrel. They
are exceedingly energetic in their efforts
to insure every man in the camp in the
only reliable company doing business on
earth. They are cutting corners apainst
each other, and saying any but nice things
of each other when thf.ir backs are
turned. Yesterday a certain well-known
insurance man spoke disparagingly of a
rival company, and when the representa
tive of the rival company heard of it he
sought out the first insurance man, and
Hashing a check of a very large denomi
nation in his face made him retract, his
statements. Colonel Smith found it neces
sary to have the camp cleared of the in
surance men.
SATURDAY IS
NOW THE DAY
Another Week Added to
the Sailing Date of
the Transports.
Saturday is now considered the earliest
date upon which the first of the troop
ships for the Philippines can sail. The
Peking- will be ready before that time,
but the troops will not, so despite the or
ders from Washington to embark yester
day the troops will still linger at the
camp on the Presidio grounds.
Progress on the Australia is more rapid
than upon the Peking, but the Peking
will be the first to leave, for she will take
supplies as well as troops. The owners
of the Conemaugh and the Ohio have
become tired of waiting for the Govern
ment to decide whether or not it would
charter their ships, and so they have sent
them up to the sound to be fitted out for
the Klondike trade this summer. The City
ot Sydney is also undergoing repairs, and
she will have to take on a full supply of
coal after she is in shape for transport
service. The Senator and the St. Paul,
both new steamers, built at the Union
Iron Works, ;tre being talked of by the
Government. but nothing definite has" been
done. In the meantime the Senator is
being loaded for her first trip on the
north coast route. Ear-h of these vessels
can easily carry at least six. hundred
men.
It is expected the Charleston will
get away some time today. She has been
waiting for stores, but just what stores
she is waiting fur that cannot be pur
chased here is not known by those who
will tell, but it is surmised that perhaps
some of Dewey's instruments, or some of
the compasses of the fleet have been in
jured by the concussion of the guns dur
ing the great fight at Manila, and new
ones must come from the Naval Obser
vatory at Washington.
Lieutenant Commander Thomas S.
Phelps, who has been on duty at the
naval rendezvous in this city, has been
ordered to duty with the Asiatic squad
ron. He will sail on the Peking, and it ia
understood he yrill be assigned to the Ral
eigh as executive officer.
The old sloop-of-war Mohican, after
having her guns stripped from her, has
suddenly given evidences of a capability
to fight. She has been painted the war
color, and as there was no need for
painting her unless there be service ahead
for her, It is believed that she, too, will
be given some work, probably in the sup
ply or patrol service.
By the middle of this month the Far
ragut will be ready to launch, and as she
will slide from the ways practically fin
ished it will not be long before she will
be put on active service. The Wisconsin
will have to wait for armor plate, and
when she will be ready is an unsolved
problem. The Fearless, now the Iroquois,
the Vigilant and the Active will be ready
to receive their guns by the end of this
week, but it is not at all certain that they
will get them by that time. The deck
house of the Vigilant has been lowered a
little and the boilers of the Active have
been braced in one or two spots where
bracing was needed, but the Fearless was
left untouched. The character of the guns
which will be mounted on the tugs is not
yet known except to this extent â they will
not be modern guns. It is probable that
their armaments will consist of whatever
can be picked up and made to answer for
service.
THE MANILA
EXPEDITION
Extra Rush on the Work
of Getting Ships Ready
to Carry Troops.
The steamers Australia, City of Sydney
and City of Peking, recently chartered
by the War Department, are being rap-
Idly fitted to carry troops to the Philip
pine Islands. Captain Oscar F. Long,
chief quartermaster of the Department
of California, is supervising the work of
preparation, and with the valuable as
sistance he is receiving from the owners
of the vessels expects to have them ready
for the long voyage by next Saturday
morning.
As aJmost the entire interior of the
three vessels will have to be remodeled,
the undertaking is of greater magnitude
than was at first anticipated; besides, the
great distance to be sailed and the large
number of troops to be carried by each
steamer will necessitate the furnishing of
increased ventilation and building of ex
tra galleys. The work, however, is being
hurried as fast as possible. Gangs of
ship-carpenters and other mechanics are
Ihnployed night and day without cessa
tion to complete the vessels for the trip.
The 'making of mattresses and other
bedding for the equipment of the vessels
is also going ahead, and there is no doubt
of Captain Long having everything in
readiness for the sailing of the steamers
some time next Saturday.
The City of Peking when completed will
accommodate at least 1350 men. The num
ber to be carried by the Australia and
City of Sydney haÂ« not yet been esti
mated. If the chartered vessels were
required to carry only the usual number
of passengers they would have been pre
pared to start at a day's notice, or at
least as soon as the necessary amount of
coal could be taken on. The delay is
caused altogether because of the great
number of changes being made to carry
a larger number of passengers than was
anticipated when the vessels were built.
The great distance to be traversedâ about
6500 milesâ is perhaps the longest voyage
ordered for United States troops; there
fore special precaution is being taken to
see that the men do not suffer for want
of proper ventilation. Everything is
being arranged to make the trip of twen
ty-five days with as little inconvenience
to the troops as possible.
A FITTING
TESTIMONIAL
Presentation to Three Vol
unteers From Wells,
Fargo & Co.
The employes of Wells, Fargo & Co.
yesterday paid a munificent tribute to
three of their fellows â Captain E. C. Sut
liffe, R. S. Mudge and F. F. Silcoxâ who
have enlisted in the army.
â  The three young men had been request
ed to pay a visit to ; the office and . say.
good -by ; to their old friends. When they
arrived they found all the employes as
sembled in the hallway, on the â ; second
floor, which was suitably decorated in
red, white and blue. As the three soldiers
approached the company drew up * to
gether in the form of a horseshoe; while
the familiar , strains of "America" , from
400 throats made . walls â  and rafters ring.
r Aaron Stein, assistant to < the president
of the company ,; then made a stirring pa
triotic speech, .at the â¢ close of : which be
presented Captain Sutliffe with a hand
some gold-mounted sword, bearing the
inscription: "Presented to Captain E. C.
Sutliffe, Company G, First California In
fantry, United States Volunteers, by his
friends in the employ of Wells, Fargo &
Co. San Francisco, California, May 16,
18P8." Captain Sutliffe attempted a short
reply, but his words were almost drowned
in the chorus of ringing cheers; in fact, ''
cheers were the chief part of the cere- i
mony.
Presentations of camp kits to the other
two volunteers were then made, after
v.-hich Mr. Stein gave a few words of ad
vice, concluding as follows:
May God blesÂ« you and throw hfa almighty
shield of protection about you in every dire
extremity. Confiding serenely in the right
eousness of your cause, attested by the high
est authorities of this and other lands, never
forget or neglect to invoke his aid and ac
knowledge his blessing, whether in camp err
on the perilous fleid of battle, and wherever
you are led may the flag of. -our country, up
borne by you,
"In triumph still wave
O"er the land of the free and the home of the
brave!"
At the close of the ceremonies all filed
up for a parting hand-shake. Captain
SutÃffe has been in the employ of the
company for about twelve years, and
Messrs. Mudge and Silcox about five
years. All the employes were granted a
half-holiday in honor of the occasion.
STREETCAR MEN
ARE ORGANIZING
Conductors and Gripmen
Forming a Volunteer
Company.
The streetcar employes of the city are
organizing a company of volunteers,
which they hope to make the best com
pany on the coast. There are a number
of conductors and gripmen in the city
who have seen service in the regular
army, and the aim is to have as many of
these enlist as will and to fill the rolls
of the company from other streetcar
men, choosing them for their physical
qualifications.
The Sutter and California street car
systems have agreed to allow their men
to go on leave of absence,' promising them
their places again on return from the
\v;ir. The Market-street system will
probably do the same, as the matter was
laid before Mr. Yining, and he said he
would take it under consideration and
give his decision in a couple of days.
General W. H. L. Barnes is sponsor for
the company, and is receiving enlistments
at his office, 50-53 Crocker building. Thirty
men have already signed the roll, sig
nifying their intention to enlist, and it
is expected that the company will have
its full quota within a few days. Any
stretcar conductor or grlpman who de
sires to join the company sTiould send his
application in as early as possible.

AN INSTANTANEOUS SUCCESS.
O'Brien's Great Consolidation Sale
Captures the Town.
To say that J. J. O'Brien & Co.'s
gigantic consolidation sale has taken the
town by storm gives but a faint idea of
the tremendous outpouring of buyers that
yesterday packed their mammoth estab
lishment at the junction of Market, Jones
and McAllister streets in response to the
announcement that their L"Â» Angeles
store had been closed and the stock
shipped here for clearance regardless of
sacrifice, and the goods are truly being
sacrificed, as the magnitude of the stock
taken in conjunction with the enormous
regular stock of their San Francisco
store creates an overplusage* of spring
and summer goods that compels the firm
to utterly disregard values in their ef
forts to force out the goods berore the
buying season is past.
Space does not permit enumeration of
the thousand and one bargains that are
offered, but they Include everything new
and fashionable in dress goods, silks,
laces, ribbons, gloves, waists, jack
ets, capes, suits, dress skirts, hosiery,
corsets, underwear, men's furnishings
curtains, linens, wash fabrics, domestics
housefurnishings and the numberless'
other articles that constitute a first-class
dry goods stock, and the thousands of
eager buyers that yesterday crowded
every aisle proved how thoroughly the
ladies of San Francisco appreciate the
rare money-saving opportunity afforded
them. j>>-
W. F. HUMPHREY GOES OUT.
His Resignation Accepted by the
Coast Athletic Association.
William F. Humphrey, who for some
time has been a member of the Board of
Registration and Board of Governors of
the Pacific Coast Amateur Athletic Asso
ciation, has tendered his resignation to
that body, owing to a pressure of other
matters which demand his entire time.
Mr. Humphrey first tendered his resig
nation about a year ago, but on request
of the national association withheld it un
til matters of importance connected with
the association on this coast could be sat
isfactorily settled. This work is now
practically finished, and he again ten
dered his resignation. Yesterday a let
ter of acceptance was received from the
coast association, but the national body
has not yet been heard from. If the
resignation is accepted it is probable that
John Eliot, of the Olympic Club, will be
Mr. Humphrey's successor.
Illegal Fishing.
The deputies of the Fish Commission
who are running the new launch Quinnat
are making a good showing for their time.
Last week Deputy John Davis reported
that the crew caught Carl Russo and Joe
Scarfield catching small bass in San
Pablo Bay. They were taken to San Ra
fael, where they pleaded guilty and were
fined $20 each by Justice of the Peace
Wilcox. Another run was made near
Ellis Landing and a lot of nets and an
chors were confiscated. On Saturday the
crew caught ten Chinese and captured
two fishing Junks in San Pablo Bay. The
Mongolians were catching the small fish
prohibited by law.
The Rose Carnival this year at Santa
Risa. May 20, will surpass anything which

Excused.
Charles Neall and Charles Armstrong
May Now Accuse the Pastor
of Evil. S
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 16.
The board of examination convened at
the Thirty-fourth street M. E. Church to
night to hear the charges against George
Neall and Charles Armstrong, and con
tinued in session until midnight. Only
three of twenty witnesses were exam
ined, but their testimony was such that
the lady stenographer had to be excused
and a gentleman substituted.
The chief witness was Mrs. Hattie
Long. The charges were riled by a friend
of hers, who tired of the scandal that
threatens to dismember the church. The
charge made specifically is that "on the
statements of their own making before
their pastor and wife, George Neall and
Charles Armstrong are guilty of making
proposals to one Hattie .Long, whicli re
flected upon her character," Every one
was excluded from the meeting except the
defendant, his attorney, and the scribe.
The witnesses were placed In the Sunday
school room and called as wanted.
Rev. A. T. Needham of the Eighth ave
nue M. E. church presided. The board
was to have consisted of seven menibers
of sister churches, but Mr. Willis of
Golden Gate and Mr. Pratt of the First
church of this city did not put in an ap
pearance. H. D. Talcott of the Ches
ter street church represented the defend
ants, and Mr. Needham the church.
The first witness was Rev. K. Francis
Brown, pastor of the church. Mrs. Long
was then examined as to the time and
events connected with the alleged in
sult. Mr. Neall followed and was on the
rack for a long time. His own admis
sion of the charge at a preliminary hear
ing is being made the most of by his
prosecutors. The affair has been a pub
lic scandal for a year and compromises
have bten made and broken numerous
times in order to keep the affair quiet.
The pastor is blamed by some and threats
are made against him by those under
charges. Charles Armstrong said to
night:
"Brown had better let this drop. I know
he had trouble in Winnemucca, New, and
I have been to Cloverdale and saw the
woman in the case. She will come here
if necessary."
Mr. Brown was told this, but refused to
do more than say: "That is all right."
The hearing will be continued and a
thorough investigation held. On the con
viction or acquittal of the defendants
will hang the fate of the church, for the
pastor's friends declare it an attempt to
run Mr. Brown out.
METZ ENDS HIS LIFE.
Drank Carbolic Acid in the Ross
House.
OAKLAND, May 16.â John Metz, who
was In Gates' tamale parlor with Grace
Galindo the night Eslabe killed Gates,
swallowed the contents of a bottle of car
bolic acid to-night in the Ross House.
Grace grabbed at him, but too late to
keep him from accomplishing the deed.
He then struck her with the bottle and
ran downstairs Into the street. The
woman followed and notified a police of
ficer of the affair. When found Metz
had reached the corner of Ninth and
Jefferson streets, where he dropped uead.
The Coroner was notified and the remains
taken to the Morgue.
ANOTHER ROAD
CUTS RATES
Northern Pacific Throws Down
the Gauntlet to the Ca
nadian Line.
The Great Northern of Oregon
Is Also in the
Field.
The Northern Pacific has thrown down
the gauntlet to the Canadian Pacific, and
there is every reason to believe that an
other lively passenger rate war is in
prospect. The Northern has cut the
transcontinental rates to New York to
$47 first class and $36 second class. To
Chicago the rate is now $43 50 and $32 50
for first and second class respectively,
and to St. Paul $32 and $21. The rates were
put in effect yesterday, by order of the
general passenger office, located in St.
Paul, Minn., and corresponding reduc
tions were made to other terminal points
on their line.
The Northern Pacific officials say that
this is the beginning of the end, and
they are now in the field to get some of
the business which has been absorbed
by and diverted to the Canadian Pacific
for some time past. They say that the
latter company, not satisfied with the
differentials of $7 50 and $o allowed it by
the Transcontinental Association in Cali
fornia alone, also applied similar differ
entials to business In Oregon and Wash
ington, although the association had re
fused to grant the concession previously.
When the Northern cut rates to equalize
these differentials the Canadian Pacific
then made a cut of 33 and 50 per cent, and
as a consequence they got all the busi
ness. It is possible that the differentials
will be abolished altogether, and if this
is done a merry rate war will undoubt
edly be the result.
Affairs were quite lively in the office of
the new bidders for patronage, and they
report a large sale at the reduced rates.
The Canadian officials are in no sense
disturbed at the course taken by their
rivals, for they say that their rates have
not been met by the other company. They
had not noticed any change in their busi
ness, and were under the impression that
the Northern would have- to make further
reductions to take trade away from
them.
The Great Northen of Oregon has also
decided to enter the field, and will re
sume the sale of orders on North Pacific
coast terminals to Eastern points at the
reduced rates in effect from these points.
It is not known whether the other Ameri
can roads will meet the reductions of the
northern roads, and no announcement
has as yet been made of such a course
on their part.
The Bailroad Again Sued.
Emma Wahlgren commenced suit yes
terday against the Market Street Railway
Company to recover $10,000 damages for
injuries received on March 22 last while
attempting to get out of the way of a car

trying to avoid the car, which was pass

fell, breaking her arm.

CONTROL YOUR FANCY.
Sometimes Imagination Runs Away With
Sober, felow-Footed Judgment.
Do not imagine, whatever may be
your station in life, that jollity is be
neath your dignity. The greatest and
best of men have had a large capacity
for fun.
Do not imagine that there is any per
son so lowly as to be beyond the obliga
tions of courtesy. Washington lifted
his hat to a negro, and said he would
not be outdone in politeness by a slave.
Do not imagine that patriotism is a
virtue reserved for war times. Pro
found peace gives a real patriot plenty
of opportunities to show his devotion.
Do not imagine that every man you
meet is as interested in the "cuteness"
of your baby boy as you are. MakÂ»
your nursery reminiscences short.
Do not imagine that a storekeeper
who recommends certain goods to you
when you want something else is a dis
interested philanthropist, seeking only
your happiness. He is thinking of his
own pocket.
Do not imagine that when you de
mand Duffy's Pure Malt Whiskey you
ought to spend a minute listening to
reasons why you should buy somebody
else's whiskey, much cheaper and said
to be just as good. The cheapness is a
delusion and the "just as good" is a
thread-bare lie. Do not be humbugged.
Kick, and kick hard. Sometimes it
seems that the only way to get justice
is by vigorous kicking.

OUR FRUIT IN ENGLAND.
The extreme scarcity of fruit In London,
says the Grocers' Gazette, coupled with the
moderate supplies of the tinned varieties,
combine to force up the prices for the lat
ter descriptions. All descriptions of Califor
nia fruits are firm, and for standard apricots
an advance of from 7%d to 9d per dozen on
last week's prices Is now being paid. The
demand for salmon from first hands Is not
brisk, but the consumption Is good, and prices
are very steady. It Is believed by many, that
the Spanish-American war will; â¢â  by causing
advanced prices for fresh meat, corn and
other food stuffs, be the means of Improving
the market for salmon. Much, however, de
pends on the duration of hostilities.
EXPLANATION.
The arrow files with the wind. The top fig
ures at station Indicate minimum temperature
for the days: those underneath it. If any, the ;
amount of rainfall or of melted snow in inches i
and hundredths during the last twelve hours. ;
Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal :
air pressure; isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high"" means high
barometric pressure and Is usually accompanied
by lair weather; "low" refers to low pres
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure is high in the interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north !
and south along the coast, rain Is probable;
but when the "low" is Inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is Im
probable. With a "high" in the vicinity of \
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
in summer and colder weather in winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

EASTERN * MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. May 16.â The stock market was
rather dull to-day and the tone was heavy
throughout. Prices never got f;r away from
the opening quotations except in a few cases.
The opening was made in sympathy with Lon
don, where the heaviness in all departments
continues on account of the uneasiness occa
sioned by Colonial Secretary Chamberlain*
pessimistic view of international politics.
Americans were no worse sufferers In the Lon
don market than other securities. Their pre
vailing high price make them an inviting field
for liquidation. An additional Incentive for
London's selling of these securities is the re
lieved tension of London's unfavorable ex
change situation and the pressure upon it for
gold. There was a fair outside demand for
btocks In the first hour, which absorbed very
well the offerings for London account and
worked some recovery from the low point. The
demand \va.Â« soon satisfied, however, and prices
drifted for the remainder of the day not far
from the low level. Net losses of numerous
leading stocks are a point or over. Sugar was
strong after an opening decline and easily led
the list In point of activity. It was at one
time two points over Saturday's clone. There
were one or two other specialties, notably
Western Union, Rubber preferred and Ten
nessee Coal and Iron, which were firm. Rock
Island was well hpld; at one time reacted' above
Saturday's close. Gelling on a parity with
Burlington. But these were exceptions to the
genfraT tone and their strength exerted little
sympahetic Influence. It was evident that
the speculative activity Is waiting on the
developments of the naval strategy In the
Caribbean Sea. There was prevalent a some
what less sanguine expectation of a speedy
termination of the war, based on some disap
pointment over the results of the bombardment
at San Juan. The evasiveness of the Spanish
fleet was also taken as Indicating a possibility
of extended maneuvering without material re
sults. The reported failure of efforts to effect
a junction with the Insurgents and to deliver
supplies of arms and ammunition to them was
Interpreted as demonstrating that any decisive
success In Cuba must wait on the campaign of
the United States troops.
Sterling exchange rates advanced full % of
a cent to-day, but that market was reported
dull. The money market continued easy and
accommodations on commercial paper were
liberal.
Bonds were very dull and prices were gen
erally lower in sympathy with stocks. Total
pales, $1,275,000.
There was a decline of \i In the United States
registered 4s of 1907. Bonds were otherwise
unchanged.
The total sales of stocks to-day were 836,600
shares, Including: 15.765 Atchlson preferred,

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKETS.
CHICAGO, May 16.â decided strength In
the Liverpool cables was the chief cause for
the bull sentiment in wheat to-day. Liverpool
quoted . July wheat fully 3c per bushel higher
than It closed Saturday. European political
news was looked on as quite important, for
It seemed to point to growing differences be
tween England and France . over the African
complications. Domestic receipts were very
heavy, and under ordinary circumstances would
have caused the traders to be shy of buying.
Having nothing but the memory of recent
losses In their minds, they covered freely
every time the buying became at all strong.
The domestic visible decreased only 634,000
bushels last week, whereas the decrease last
year-was 2. 12".. 000 bushels. The weather east
of the Rockies was about perfect for c wheat
growing and the California drought was
broken by a twenty-four hour's rain. Con
tinental cables were in the main easier. ' How
ever, I the market here got â  strong support and
was kept on the Jump for the most part, so
that the traders had no ' opportunity to look
at the ordinary news items, . more especially
those of a statistical character. May opened
at $1 40, against Saturday's close of $1 44%, and
was carried up with July and closed at $160
! bid, " 614 c net gain. July - opened at $1 06 â â¢ to
*1 07H. flanaily touched $1 09. eased off to
$1 07% I and sold up to $1 09% : and reacted to
$1 09% lild at the close, a net gain of 4%c.
September, which closed Saturday at ; 89%e.
opened at 90'gCOHc, sold down to 89% c, then
up to 92c, reacted to 91% cat the close, a net >
gain of 2Mic. . .
Corn . was . very , strong and active- to-day
with outsider* in the market in force. The
weather was a factor. Liverpool waa %(&^4d
higher. July closed with a net gain of %c.
Oats were neglected, but opened â¢ firm in
sympathy with the general strength In the
other speculative markets. 'July closed %c
higher. â¢ i â  -â â â â â¢â¢ ; _
Provisions - made .a . sensational advance,
nearly all of which was retained. Shipments ;
of -lard and : meats - were enormous. Increased j
outside .] trade i was -a . factor. Government ; or- I
ders for the army cut some figure. There has !
been very, large buying :of both ribs and lard 1
through commission. houses for packers. ' July
pork closed with a gain of 70c over Saturday;
lard 35c higher, and ribs 40c higher. â

HAY AND FEEDSTUFFS.
Those who had expected that Hay would bÂ«
weak on account of the rain were mistaken,
for reports showed considerable damage to the
Hay already cut. especially to Alfalfa in the
Sacramento River district, and to Wheat Hay
down around Mavfleld Again, large areas in
the Northern Sacramento Valley, which were
to have been cut for Hay are now to be cut
for Wheat. To offset this, however, the crop
still uncut has been largely benefited.
The general tone of the market was strong

He Tells a Beautiful Story
About Supplying Corn
at Cost.
The Betnvolent Financier Regrets
His Inability to Enlighten
she Commission.
The Southern Pacific sage and diplomat,
C. P. Huntington, passed yesterday morn-
Ing in United States Commissioner Hea
cock's court answering questions relating
to the operating expenditures of his road
In 1594. Among other things he was re
quested to explain certain entries made in
the report regarding the deficiencies in
the different branches.
The indomitable witness appeared before
the Railroad Commissioners in the after
. noon, and, cool and collected as ever, en
' tertained his interrogators by telling
them everything that they didn't want to
know. â â¢-:â "- â 
As on previous occasions, the attorneys
i for the State and the commissioners gave
a wide berth to anything that would tend
to draw from the witness anything per
taining to the thousands of dollars that
have been paid to a certain San Fran
cisco i newspaper as hush money. This
particular item of contingent expense
does not seem to possess any attractions
for the legal gentlemen who are probing
for facts.
The value of the railroad property was
the principal thing that the Commission
ers aimed to draw from the witness, but |
the secret still remains locked up in the i
vault of his mental depository, and the
indications up to date are that it will
stay there.
"The road cost the stock and bonds and I
floating Indebtedness," . said Hunting
ton. "I believe we shall sometime get a !
fair interest on what it cost."
Taking this answer as a basis of cal- ;
culation, the Commissioners concluded not
to attempt to figure out the cost of the
property.
When asked how much the Central Pa
cific could be constructed for at this time |
Mr. Huntington said no one could tell un
less he were a prophet or the son of a ;
prophet. He had known rails to go ;
up in a month from $45 to $80. j
"Timber: doesn't vary much, ' said j
he. "Metal, however, in its crude \
state is very much lower than It ;
was: but when the crude metal goes into |
manufactured shape, it goes up: for In
stance, If made into watch springs It
might be worth $100 a pound."
In the same manner he answered ques
tions relating to the disposal of bonds, >
the land grants and donations and the |
division of profits among the Big Four. ,
The lands had been given condi- j
tionally upon the building of the road, wid j
Mr. Huntington insisted that anybody do- ,
ing as much as he had. done in construct
ing railroads should be. rewarded.
Then Mr. Huntington took up the sub
ject of passes. .. -;â¢ -â¢ j
"I have given away a .great many |
passes," he said, "and I would like i
to give away a great many more. ,
It would make me very uncom
fortable to sit in my office: and hear the
hard luck: stories. I gave a pass to a |
woman to-day, and wrote 'chanty on It.
She cried and said she could not use it
with that word on it."
He was in favor of giving a pass â  to
every competent man who worked for the
State for as low a salary as $3000, so that
he could travel over the State, even if ]
he (Huntington) had to pay a little more i
for his own fare. His charity passes were :
numerous, yet outside of official passes .
he thought not one man In a thousand
secured free transportation. There arc
not so many free passes Issued as a year ;
SCO Â«â "-''-:â -'â *- â  -..'-
Mr. Hinton remarked that it was the
intention of the commission to treat both .
sides fairly. , , , .â I
"The commission has a political end, i
observed Mr. Huntington. "I believe _t ]
was intended for a political machine. If ;
there was not a political object in this i
matter there never would have been a i
Railroad Commission." ' â  - .--'
He was "called down" for this expres- I
sion of opinion, but he kept right on, and
told how he had intended to transport
corn from Nebraska and sell it in Cali- j
fornia at actual cost. He recounted the j
good things accomplished by the rail- 1
road, whose rates were the lowest in the j
world. "The only stock subscribed in
San Francisco for the Central Pacific," j
Bald Mr. Huntington, "was ten shares by I
'a German shoemaker and ten shares by
a Spanish-Mexican woman."
While discussing Stanford, in response
to answers. Mr. Huntington praised him
for his truthfulness, but criticised him for
his business methods. "Stanford, it is
true, had $1,500,000 as a starter, but he got
it from his brother," said he. ,
"Didn't Stanford testify to the truth
when he stated that they (the Big Four)
drew out $13,000,000 apiece?" asked- Com
missioner Hinton. .
"The stock was sold and we got divi- :
dends." was Huntington's reply. "Stan
ford didn't steal any moneyâ what he got
he got honestly." . :
"I didn't mean to say that he did, an
swered Mr. Hinton.
"You might make something of thisâ
not money, butâ" X:".
Huntington was about to finish, but was
called to order by Hinton, who wanted !
him to understand that he. the commis- i
sioner, was not on trial. .
"These matters are revamped, andâ"
Â» . "Nothing of the kindâ nothing is being
revamped," retorted Hinton, with consid- j
erable emphasis. - â  ;
After some further discussion :it was
concluded to excuse Mr. Huntington un
til further notice, although ; the mag
nate is very anxious to sever his ' dipio
lomatic relations with ..the .California
Railroad Commission. - **~ v
CHASED WITH A HATCHET.
A Hotel-Keeper Swears Out a War
rant for Miss J. Kean's Arrest.
Jesus Borboa, proprietor of the Spanish-
American Hotel, 459 Geary strr-et, swore
to a complaint in Judge Low's court yes
terday for the arrest .of Miss J. Kean on
a charge of asault with a deadly weapon.
Borboa, with the aid of an interpreter,
stated that Miss Kean had fallen In ar
rears for the rout of her room, and as he.
found that she had heen surreptitiously
removing part of her furniture he told
her to leave, and put a padlock on her
door. On Sunday afternoon Miss Kean
went to the rear of the hotel, and, pro
curing a hatchet, smashed the kitchen
door in pieces, and when Borboa Inter
fered she chased him and attempted to
'e:rike him with the hatchet. He managed
to make his escape.

PRICE . MADE LIEUTENANT.
The Well-Known Sergeant Appointed
Successor to the Late William
Burke.
The Police Commissioners last night
promoted Sergeant William Price to the
position of lieutenant, to fill the vacancy
caused by the death of Lieutenant Burke.
For a number of years Price and Burke
worked together and made a brilliant
I record. Price was afterward placed in
charge of the Chinatown squad, ana on
account of his strong opposition to high
binders the dubbed him the "White
Devil."
The new lieutenant has been connected
with the department for a cumber of,
years and is held in Tiigh regard by the
Police Commissioners. He has been as
signed to duty at the Seventeenth-street
station, to alternate with Captain Glllen.
Policeman Murphy, who got drunk sev
eral nights ago and abused Sergeant
Brophy. was let off with a fine of $20.
The charge of unofflcerlike conduct pre
ferred aprainst Polic<Â«man Heinz by Joseph
Riley was dismissed.

WILL BE SENT EAST.
Bemenyi's Remains Will Be Em
balm^d and Shipped to
New York.
Edouard Remenyi had many friends In
life, and since death closed the eyes of the
great violinist he has not been forgotten.
His body has been taken charge of by
Coionel Kowarsky, who had it removed
to the undertaking parlors of Porter &
White, with orders to have it embalmed
and prepared for shipment to the East.
All day yesterday Colonel Kowalsky
was besieged with offers of assistance
by many who had known and respected
the deceased during life. First among
these were the representatives of the Or
pheum company, who agreed to pay all
the expenses of having the body em
balmed and shipped East. Many of his
fellow musicians also came and requested
that they be given the privilege of hold
ing a service over the body before it Is
sent away for interment. It is probable
that a joint service of the musicians and
Austrian societies will be held.
Rcmenvi's widow lives in New York,
and is at present ill with heart disease.
The news was broken to her gradually.
First a telegram was sent stating that
he was seriously ill: then one that there
was no hope, and finally the news of his
death. The family has already been
communicated with regarding the dis
posal of the body, but no definite instruc
tions have as yet been received.
It is stated by some that the great mu
sician leaves his family in somewhat
straitened circumstances, and in view of
thi* fact a benefit entertainment is al
ready boing talked of. If this proves to
be the case the plans will take some tan
gible form before the end of the week.
YACHTSMEN WILL
BURY THE HATCHET
The San Francisco Club Agrees
to Re-enter the Asso
ciation.
A Change in By-Laws the Feature
of Business at a General
Meeting-
A general meeting of the members of
the San Francisco Yacht dub was held
last night at the Merchants' Exchange.
There were present Commodore Dr. T.
L. Hill, Vice-Commodore George T. S.
White, Treasurer R. B. Hogue, Finan
cial Secretary W. G. Morrow, Measurer
J. M. Punnett and several members of
the club. The new by-laws prepared
by the committee for the revision of
by-laws, consisting of G. T. S. White,
R. B. Hogue and W. G. Morrow, were
read over by Treasurer R. B. Hogue
and discussed. The principal differences
between the old by-laws and the new
are found in the rules regulating the
nomination and election of officers and
upon these sections there was much
discussion. The by-laws were accepted
with some amendments, which are to
be incorporated by the revision com
mittee.
A communication was read from Dr.
C. L. Tisdale, president of the Pacific
Interclub Yacht Association, express
ing a hope that delegates from the San
Francisco Yacht Club would be sent to
the next meeting of the association.
After considerable discussion and a
strong protest from one or two mem
bers against re-entering the association
until an acknowledgment be received
from its officials that an injustice was
done two years ago to the San Francis
co Yacht Club, it was decided to re
enter the association.
Next Saturday evening there will be
a hop at the new home of the San
Francisco Yacht Club, for which invi
tations may be obtained by members
on application to the secretary. Visitors
may take the 7:25 ferryboat from the
city and tt launch will leave the club
house 'rt'harf about 11 o'clock to take
them back.
PACIFIC COAST COMMERCE.
The Matter of Its Protection Has
Been Considered at Washington.
Several weeks ago the Chamber of Com
merce sent to the Pacific Coast Represen
tatives at Washington copies of a resolu
tion asking for better protection for
commerce on the Pacific Coast from the
depredations of Spanish privateers that
it was feared might prey upon the ves
sels of the Pacific Ocean. The matter
was taken up by the parties addressed,
and yesterday the chamber received the
following copy of a letter sent by Secre
tary Long of the Navy Department to
Senator Perkins and Congressman Hil
born:
I have the honor to acknowledge the re
â  f your letter of the f>th met., in
closing a copy of resolutions adopted by the
Chamber of Commerce of San Francisco rela
tive to the protection of the commerce of the
Pacific.
In reply I have to inform you that the mat
ter has recently heen referred to the Naval
War Board, which reports that the command
ant in chief of the Pacific station has been
instructed in regard to the general subject of
the Pacific Coast defense. Very respectfully,
JOHN D. LONG.

The Emeric Will Contest.
Judge Belcher yesterday set aside an
order made by him on Saturday granting
letters of administration to Cornelia Myr
tle Barbier on the estate of the late Mrs.
Eugenic Emeric. Harry Emeric, husband
of the decedent, filed a contest to the
probatinp of the will on Friday, and Pub
lic Administrator Freese, with the con
sent of the contestant, filed a petition for
letters of special administration during
the pendency of the contest. Judge
Belcher, without consulting the record,
granted Cornelia Myrtle Barbier special
letters. When his mistake was called to
his attention yesterday he rectified it by
setting aside the original order. The
matter will now come up for hearing
next Friday before Judge Troutt.

THE SAN FRAKCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 17, 1898.

CHASSEZ TO
THE FRONT
Society Girls Want
the Beaux to Go
to War.
Would Form a Swell and
Altogether Select
Company.
List of Names and Proper
Qualifications Ready for
Approval.
THE VALETS WILL, FOLLOW
New York Sots the Fashion and
San Frenciseo Will Do
Likewise.
San Franciscoâ that Is, social San Fran
cisco, which always follows where New
York leadsâ is for the first time derelict,
and the neglect is so apparent, the fault
so monstrous that the feminine portion of
local society is dissolved in tears.
New York has sent its company of
swells to the front. Its womankind
cheered them and waved them adieu, and
each bud and belle tucked her tricolored
cockade under the protecting stem of a
brass button that was born to embellish
the fatigue jacket of a brave private.
The local bud. or belle, or fashionable
matron, wears her red, white and blue,
but the button comes not, alas! from the
beaus. And so there ara tears and sighs
and waitings, and San Francisco society
lives in an atmosphere of thwarted hopes
and general discontent.
If our elegant men are not alive to this
damaging social breach our girls are.
Though crushed and unhappy, such is
their patriotism that they have taken it
upon themselves to personally see to the
mustering of a company. They have with
unusual perspicacity recognized the im
portance of each gentleman being accom
nanied by his valet, and have interviewed
th? valets They claim glorious results.
lh Thls dea of sending a fashionable , com
pany to the front, though born sudden >
of a. spirit of imitation, has been carefully
considered. Each and every -man selected
is the equal in ease and dexterity to any
lieutenant that gracedthe _ Arm> Â»nd ,Na .>
Cotillion. Many of them have ii ce 2 llt can
remarkable success, and not one but can
"chassez" down the line nimbly and with
Pl Wha"t S thev may lack in military train
in? fheirballroom talents will make , more
than ample compensation for. Military
authorities have been known o d * cla â¢
the ability to "two-step" equal if not
superior to the "hay foot, straw foot."
ThusÂ£ reason the tender, clinging buds
who live for their country, brass-button
hat Pins and the latest New York styles.
?n the r enthusiasm they have even gone
so far as to jot down the following names
To be submitted to the proper authorities.
Kd Sheldon. Walter Martin Peter Mar
tin. Andrew Martin. Robert Eyre.Latham
McMullin. Harry Holbrook, Harry Dib
blee James Phelan, George iMewhall,
Hugh Tevis. Harry Tevis, Clement Tobin.
Dick Tobin, Edward Dononoe and John
Eacl? and every man was selected only
after mature consideration and with a
regard for some special qualifications to
fit him for the front.
Ed Sheldon is especially fitted to lead,
and though he is loath to exercise the pre
rogative, he is recognized by all as Green
way's only successful rival. The three
Martin boys excel in the art supreme of
"chassezing," which the girls imagine will
come in usefully in skirmishes. But only
two of the Martin boys can fill the ranks
of the select company. Walter Martin
had to go to New York to be usher at the
Mackay-Duer wedding.
Robert Eyre, Latham McMullin, Harry
Holbrook and Harry Dibblee are all
graceful and dashing and brave, and
while the buds fear Phelan may not be
able to leave the city alone to the tender
mercies of the citizens, they more than
declare in favor of George Newhall, solid
and true, esthetic and brave.
Hugh Tevis and Dr. Harry Tevis repre
sent the very flower of southern chivalry,
and all are confident that the Tobin boy 3
could immediately put. alone and unaided,
a whole regiment of Spaniards to flight.
Edward Donohoe and John T. Doyle are
just as popular, and the girls are deter
mined they should go.
Of course, these names form but a bril
liant nucleus round which others of equal
magnitude are to be gathered.
With the delicious frankness for which
California girls are noted belles and buds
openly admit that they are selfish. "We
have studied the matter carefully," they
declare. "The war will be over before
winter sets in. We have learned to do
without the men during the summer
months, and all bur boys can be back in
time for the first cotillion."
JEFFRIES WILL
FIGHT RUHLIN
The Los Angeles Heavy-Weight
Is to Take a Vacation in
the South.
Charley McKeevar, the Clever Wel
ter-Weight, Has Arrived From
New York.
Charley McKeever, the clever Eastern
'â  welterweight pugilist, is in this city. He
I arrived from New York on Sunday, and
is expecting to be matched against any
one of the 140-pound pugilists who are
seeking favorable consideration from the
local athletic clubs. The National Club
managers are of the opinion that Mc-
Keever- and Daly would make a good
drawing card, and with that object fn
view they have communicated with Daly's
manager, Sam Fitzpatrick. According to
Eastern reports Daly is growing rapidly
in weight, and his manager is of the opin
ion that in this balmy climate he could
not possibly meet Lavigne at the figures
"the Kid" would assuredly demand if a
match, to take place on this coast, is
contemplated. McKeerer says the New
York clubs cannot "pull off" any good
flstic contests for several weeks, and that
O'Rourke informed him that owing to
certain political maneuvers first-class
matches will not be tolerated in New York
for some time.
Jack Daly has proven in his recent en
gagements with Lavigne that he is a
first-class welter, and doubtless a contest
between him and McKeever would prove
quite interesting.
The Alpine Athletic Club will give its
first athletic entertainment at 23 Golden
Gate, avenue on Thursday evening. The
principal event on the card is an eight
round cpntest between Jlmmie Lawler of
the Excelsior Club and Sam Maxwell of
the Alpine Club. If Maxwell can fight
at the present time as well as he has
fought in the past, Lawler will have a
busy time dodging sledgehammerpunches.
The San Francisco Athletic Club will
entertain its members on Wednesday
evening at the clubrooms, 431 Sixth street.
A first-class athletic bill of fare will be
presented. Some old scores will be wiped
out on this occasion.
Jim Jeffries has finished his contract
with a Mission street theater, and ex
pects to depart from Oakland to-morrow
for his home in Los Angeles. He says
that he has had a surfeit of fighting, and
will take a well-earned rest before he
talks pugilism again. "But you can say
this much for me," remarked the big
heavyweight, "if Ruhlin is successful in
bis fight with McCoy, he can have an
other chance with me to settle that little
"draw" affair. My hands are now in a
wretched condition, but I guess they will
be all right in a month or so. Ruhlin is
the man I will be after next."
FUNERAL OF THE
GALLANT ENSIGN.
The United States and North Caro
lina Pay Tribute to Slain
Worth Bagley.
RALEIGH, May 16.â The United
States and North Carolina to-day paid
noble tribute to the memory of the
gallant ensign, Worth Bagley, the
first officer killed in the war with
Spain. Nothing: to approach to-day's
funeral pageant was ever seen here.
The body arrived late last night and
was met by an escort of volunteers
and taken to the house of Ensign Bag
ley's widowed mother, where a detail
of troops kept constant guard. The
love of all classes of people for the
dead officer was shown in the stream
of callers and wealth of floral tributes.
The latter came from near and far,
and it was significant that most of
them were red, white and blue. On
the casket were the dead officer's
chapeau and sword. ,
The body remained at the house until
2:30 o'clock this afternoon, when it was
taken to the Capitol and placed in the
rotunda. The rotunda was draped in
the national and State colors.
A steady stream of people flowed by
for two hours. The face was not ex
posed. It was reported that it was dis
figured by the explosion of the shell,
but this was inaccurate. The face wore
a smile. The casket was removed from
the rotunda at 5 o'clock and placed in
front of the statue of Washington,
where the exercises were held in the
presence of the family and the city
clergy and 10,000 people, including all
United States, State and city offi
cials, military veterans, cadets and
school children. Colonel Thomas S.
Kennon was master of ceremonies.
Fifteen thousand people saw the pro
cession. All business was suspended
during the exercises*
The ceremonies at the grave were
brief, consisting of the committal to
the grave, prayer and benediction, and
a hymn, "The Seaman's Prayer."
As the procession moved eleven guns
were fired by a battery and eleven were
fired at the grave, and then two regi
ments fired three volleys. The body
was buried quite near the grave of En
sign Bagley's grandfather, Governor
Worth.
The ceremonies were marked by deep
public feeling, and the military por
tion of them was that proper at the
burial of a brigadier-general.
FIVE MISSIONARIES
SLAIN BY NATIVES.
Dr. and Mrs. McGrew Not Among
the Killed at Sierra Leone.
WASHINGTON. May 16.â Secretary Day
has telegraphed Embassador Hay at Lon
don to procure all information he can in I
regard to the alleged massacre of Ameri- j
can commissaries and the destruction of |
mission property at Sierra Leone, on the j
west coast of Africa, and to make special
efforts to ascertain whether Mr. and Mrs.
McGrew were among the number killed.
On the 9tn inst. Embassador Hay sent
a cable message to the Secretary of State j
saying that he had received the following ;
message from ths London i'oreign Office. I
being an extract from a telegram of the
Governor of Sierra Leone, Sir F. Carden,
to Mr. Chamberlain:
Regret to inform you that thÂ« following
American missionaries were killed by insur
gent bands at Rotifunk: Mr. and Mrs. Cain,
Misses Archer. Hatfield and Plebenck. Miss
Ward, as well as the following named mis
sionaries, are here, quite safe: Mr. and Mrs.
Buntner and Mr. and Mrs. Mtnshall from
Shelgeh. and Miss Mullen from Hlinialigri.
This message makes no reference to Dr.
and Mrs. McGrew, and their friends in
this country are becoming apprehensive
as' to their possible fate. Secretary Day
Instructed Embassador Hay to make
further inquiry about them. Embassador j
Hay replied on the 13th inst. that Mr. and i
Mrs. McGrew were stationer! at Robetta j
and were safe. On the following day the j
Secretary of State cabled the American
Embassador at London that they were
stationed at Talma at last accounts.
All of these missionaries were Ameri
cans, who were sent to Sierra Leone by
the United Brethren of Christ Mission of
Dayton, Ohio.
ELECTION FRAUDS AT
STANFORD UNIVERSITY.
Faculty Committee Finds Evidence of
Much Illegal Voting.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY", May 16.â
Since the appointment by Dr. Jordan of
the faculty committee to investigate the
charge of fraudulent and illegal voting in
the last student body election, the college
has been on the gui vive. The probable
findings of the committee and the accu
mulating evidence of unfair play have
been the main topics of conversation since
the- big mass-meeting of Friday last. To
day the investigatorsâ Professors Bran
ner, Elliott, Greer, Durand and Whittierâ
made their report and the suspense was
ended.
After three days of careful inquiry the
committee became convinced that a re
election for all contested offices was neces
sary. Developments since the scrutiny
began show that the names of forty-six
students who cast no ballots were marked
in the register as voted. But two voted
who were not scratched from the polling
list. In the ballot-box were found 918
votes, while the catalogue of students
showed C'o2 who had deposited tickets.
All told, there were about sixty votes in
the box that did not belong there.
Who the guilty or criminally careless
persons are will probably never be known,
for the system, being a loose one, there
are always many opportunities for dis
honesty from the time the voting begins
until the ballots are counted.
HALSTEAD A PRISONER
' BUT NOT TORTURED.
Case of the New York Herald Cor-
respondent Investigated by
England.
WASHINGTON, May 16.â The British
Embassy was requested recently to se
cure information concerning the Porto
Rican correspondent of the New York
Herald named Halstead, a British sub
ject, who was said to be undergoing
torture at San Juan. On inquiry of
the London Foreign Office the Embassy
is informed that Halstead was con
victed of making photographs of the
Porto Rican fortifications and was sen
tenced to .nine years' imprisonment.
The reports of torture are denied.

put up ' soon had its quota of patients,
and the second one became a necessity.
The two trained ; nurses who a week | ago
volunteered . their services and who were
placed in charge of the first tent soon had
all they could attend to, and should more
patients be given to the care â¢of the so
ciety more nurses will have to be placed
in the service of mercy. There will
be no lack of good nurses to choose from
for the positions. The books of the society
have the names of about fifty competent
men who are willing to give their services
to their country in; the hospital service,
and it is not unlikely that several of them
will be called to take charge of the hew
tent before many hours. :
The soldiers are grateful for the Inter
est the members of the society are taking
in them, and the Red Cross is cheered by
the men every time a detachment of
them - passes' anywhere near - whero the
flag of the organization flies over Its hos
pital tents.- The men of the batteries
quartered In the Fontana warehouse sent
the following letter of appreciation to the
society yesterday:
To the Red Cross Society: The men of Bat

of our beloved America by swearing to pro

your tokens of love will enable us to bear more
cheerfully the hardships that fall to a soldier" â¢

Many letters have been received at the
headquarters of the Red Cross Society
from the relatives and friends of the
men of the companies who came ,to the
Presidio camp from the , interior * towns
and cities asking that a eating hand ;be
extended; to the individual person named.
The requests met with a willing response,
but in every . case it was found those
inquired for were :â  being Â« well taken care
of and in no immediate need.
The call made on Saturday for *500 ab
dominal bandages. to be turned in to the
society's rooms on Tuesday night is
meeting with, a ready response. Early
yesterday morning, many ladies were at
the Red Cross rooms asking for more
detail, as to how they were to be made,
and by noon scores of sewing machines
were humming â at their work turning
them out. Before the day closed the
Fruit and Flower Mission brought in 750
of .them. The bandages are wide woolen
ones, to be worn about the waists of the
soldiers as a precaution against cholera.
The warerooms of the society at 16
Post â¢ street, â¢ where donations of . needed
supplies are being received, is now one
of the busiest places. In the city. - There
has been : a ready response to the ; call f or v
hospital supplies 7 and delicacies, and al
ready several large wagon loads have
been received and thankfully acknowl
edged. Among several of the donations
of stimulants- have been demijohns : ; of
port wines. The medical officer who will
nave charge of the sanitary regulations
of â¢ the - Manila â¢ expedition has tabooed
port wines. , He says such liquors will be
injurious . in '. the climate of -â¢ the â â . equator,
and he suggests that brandies, whiskies
and sherries be given Instead. .â 'â â _â <â .
Friedlander, Gottlob & Co. have prom
ised to give a monster benefit at one -of
their theaters L this week for i the : benefit
of the Red Cross fund, and the managers
of the Alcazar have also promised to turn
over their theater and their company of
players to assist the soldiers. An enter
tainment will also be given by the Pacific
Coast Woman's Press Association at
Native Sons' Hall .on Thursday evening
next. Miss Jessie â  Ackerman will give

RED CROSS WORKERS,
OAKLAND, May 18.â The members of
the Red Cross Society In this city have
spent a busy day preparing for the early
departure of the boys in blue for Manila.
Early in the day the ladies' finance com
mittee met and were gratified with num
erous donations of cash. Nearly 100 la
dies were busily engaged in the First Con
gregational and First Presbyterian
churches, making the abdominal band
ages, called for by the surgeon in charge.
Nearly a dozen bolts of gray flannel have
been contributed for this work. Over 600
of the belts were completed to-night, but
flannel and workers are wanted for ten
times as many for. Tuesday and Wednes
day.
Mrs. Abbott visited Mrs. Harrington to
day in San Francisco regarding the work
to be done, and both societies will work in
harmony. The proposition of a State
league was discussed at length. The
ladies .feel the need of one channel
through which to reach the army officials,
and as the local auxiliaries increase this
need becomes more prominent. Steps
may be taken to-morrow for this work
and a headquarters established where all
can Join their forces.
STOCKTON DONATIONS.
Mrs. Georgie C. Ryan, grand secretary
of the Native Daughters of the Golden
West, received a letter yesterday from
Joaquin Parlor No. 3 of Stockton, in
which appears the following:
"At our meeting last night, after the
election of delegates to the Grand Parlor,
we held an after-meeting in the banquet
hall, which for the occasion was decorat
ed In the true spirit of patriotism. Our
parlor has aided in the movement in be
half of the noble defenders of our coun
try's honor, and takes the lead in Stock
ton by donating $50 to the Red Cross fund,
and it has appointed a committee to se
cure funds for the society from other or
ganizations and from individuals. Our
parlor will later add to our contribution."
BRITISH SEAMEN
STONED BY SPANIARDS.
Postmen of the Channel Squadron
Set Upon by Mobs at
Villagarcia.
LONDON, May 17.â A dispatch to the
Standard from Corunna says: The
presence of the British Channel squad
ron at Villagarcia is likely to lead to
some unpleasantness. The idea of an
Anglo-American alliance has so in
flamed the Spaniards that the postmen
from the fleet, when on shore to collect
letters, have been hooted and stoned.
Threats have been made to stop the
supply of provisions to the fleet. The
British Consul protested to the Alcalde,
who explained that the popular resent
ment was due to a belief in the exis
tence of an alliance and to the further
impression that the fleet took wheat
that properly belonged to the poor.

WASHINGTON, May 16.â The Senate

Arrival of the Doric With Many
Passengers and a Large Sum
In Treasure.
Quite a fleet of deep-water - ships ar
rived yesterday, and kept the Custom
house officials and quarantine officers
busy during the afternoon. The steamer
Doric came in a day ahead of time from
Hongkong via Yokohama and Honolulu.
Since the opening of the war with J Spain
very little coin has been shipped from the
Orient in American vessels, ; and in con
sequence the Doric brought in an accu
mulation of ; $1,600,000 :in treasure. --â  She
â¢also - brought seventy-eight cabin and
twenty-eight European steerage passen
gers and 255 . Chinese for : this port. It
took quite a long time to transfer the
Mongolians to the quarantine station,
and in consequence it was late in the
afternoon before the steamer was docked.

CROWNED SHOOTING KING.
J, D, HEISE, Who Carried Off the Honors.
AMIDST the cheers of his fellow members and the congratulatory
shouts of hundreds of friends J. D. Heise was crowned Shooting King
of the San Francisco Schuetzen Verein for 198 yesterday in Shell
Mound Park.
The shot that knocked the perforated remains of the wooden eagle to the
ground and gained him the laurel wreath, a gold medal, 575 in cash and
numerous other honors came late in the day, after the different parts of the
noble bird had been shot away by the experts.
Seventy members of the well-known organization drew lots at 11 o'clock
for first fire at the inanimate target suspended high In the air 6ome 100
yards away, and in rapid succession they fired until nothing remained but
the heart of the eagle. This was protected by a steel plate, and when re
moved that portion of the bird was perforated in turn. On the third round
John Utschig gained first prize by clipping its crown. D. B. Faktor took
second prize in that round by hitting the apple. The scepter went to R.
Stettlin, giving nim third prize: the neck to George H. Seyden. the right
wing to A. Junfbluth. the left wing to J. D. Heise, right leg to L. Bendel,
left leg to John Gefken and the tail to Albert Meyer.
King Heise was the lucky marksman to lower the bird, and escorted by
the Second Artillery Band and his comrades he marched into the dance-hall,
where a wreath of laurels was suspended about his form. He modestly
replied to the honors received, and to celebrate his victory invited every
one to drink his health in nut-brown ale.
Besides winning the prizes already mentioned, the shooting king Is
allowed $100 by the vorein, to be devoted to a banquet in his honor. This
will be held shortly, when further fame' will be showered upon him.
The second day of the shooting festival drew a larger gathering than
the day previous. The inclement weather on Sunday kept the crowd that
attended in the dance-hall, while the members occupied the shooting
stand, keeping up a merry din throughout the afternoon.
Bowling, dancing and other past'mes were entered into by the non
combatants, and an enjoyable time was had.
The many prizes, amounting to nearly $500, offered for bowling and
marksmanship, will be distributed on Thursday evening In California Hall,
when a ball will be given.
Lieutenant Huber of the First California Volunteers and a member of
the society was present yesterday and was allowed the privilege of com
peting. The verein at its last meeting passed resolutions to the effect that
all members enlisting in defense of the country would be exempt from
dues and fines during such enlistment.
The success of the two days' festival was due to the following com
mittees:

"NEVER HEARD
SUCH PLAYING"
San Francisco Approves
of Boston's KLneisel
Quartet
The Four Artists Capture a
Large and Critical Audi
enca.
Attractive Bills at the Various Thea
ters Afford a Choice of Amuse
ment.
The first concert given by the Knei
sel Quartet of Boston confirms all that
was claimed for these artists. Such
close attention and such enthusiasm as
the audience showed last night at
Sherman, Clay & Co.'s hall are rare at
chamber concerts. But the Kneisels
had not finished the allegro of Haydn's
quartet in D majc-r before their listen
ers understood why Georg Henschel
in recommending them, wrote: "The
good California public have never
heard quartet playing like theirs."
The audience was willing to admit that
it had never heard quartet playing at
all, in the light of this revelation of it.
These two violins, the viola and the
cello that interpreted Haydn, Bee
thoven and Dvorak last night have
known one another and worked to
gether for eleven years. If all musical
friendships were as happy, the works
of great composers would be better
known and more fully appreciated.
Until you have heard the Knelsel Quar
tet's sympathetic translation of
Dvorak's beautiful quartet in F major
it must remain only a partially com
prehended foreign tongue to you.
These musicians played the Haydn
minuet for all the merriment that's in
it, and the Beethoven adagio in G
major with a regard for phrasing, a
sureness of conception and a delicacy
of sentiment that provoked the heart
iest applause. But every movement of
the Dvorak quartet was a musical pic
ture. The end of the allegro was like
a melodied scroll, so perfect was the
phrasing. The solo for the cello and
that gay, tripping dance the violin
plays were exquisitely given. Schroe
der was once first celloist in the Leip
sic Gewandhaus, and Kneisel's bow
sang the solo in'the Lento as a marvel
ously trained human voice might have
done had it an impossible compass and
an intensely emotional nature behind
it. And meanwhile the rest of the in
struments are accompanying the solo
ist, as Henschel himself might, if he
could play the violin, viola and cello
all at the same time and with the same
degree of excellence he has attained
on the piano.
But it isn't individual effect that at
tracts you in this quartet. It's the
perfection of unanimity, the playing of
four instruments as though but one
mind inspired eight hands. It's the
artistic appreciation all have o-f the
composer's work, it's the thoroughness
which neglects not a single note or
phrase, and which vivifies the com
poser's idea, till it is musically re
created by the power of sympathy and
art.
Wednesday's programme includes
Borodine's quartet in D major, Schu
bert's "Death and the Maiden" and
Sshuman's quartet in A major.
The Baldwin.
Yesterday began the last week of Pilar-
I Morin at the Baldwin. The beautiful,
! talented Frenchwoman appeared in "A
J Dresden Shepherdess," an example of
! ethereal pantomimic comedy, and closed
her programme with "In Old Japan," that
dumb tragedy which is so much more ef
fective than many of the double-lunged,
double-tongued tales of woe that have
j held the stage.
It is interesting to see Mile. Pllar-Morin
; first as " Pierrott, an unreal, fairyllke,
i mute bad boy, who becomes piteously
I human at the last; and then to watch the
! same Pilar-Morin as Adzume, who is
doomed to die in the Empress' pla-ce, and
| who is saved at the last moment by the
| quaint Japanese Queen, who even before
the Christian era recognized the obliga
tion of her royalty and came back to die
like the queer little, brave little kimono
dnd heroine she was.
The company is an excellent one. every
member of it being an artist, small or
great. The costuming is beautiful and ap
propriate, and Aime Lachaume's music is
I the poetic pantomime made melodiously
audible.
On Tuesday, May 24, Ysaye. Gerardy
and Lachaume open at the Baldwin. The
sale of seats begins Thursday, May 19, at
9 o'clock.
The Orpheum.
As usual, the Orpheum was crowded
last evening. The high class of vaudeville
presented by the management at all times
has made the house popular with all
classes of people, and In consequence,
rain or shine, a "good house" will always
be found there.
The programme was an exceptionally
THE SAtf PfcANCISCO CALIi, TUESDAY, MAY 17, 1898.
good one, and many of the Items were
encored again and again. The place of
Remenyi. who died suddenly last Sunday,
was taken by Pietro Marino, and the
young California artist di<3 exceeding^
well, his playing of Weinlawski s Polo
naise in D major was a tr ?. at 'Âw ^n Â® i\!?
rendition of "St. Patrick's Day 1 brought
down the house. . .
The visions of art were very good, and.
In fact, so was every item presented, me
Orpheum will surely satisfy the crowds
that will attend this week.
The Columbia.
Robert Mantell in "The Face in the
Moonlight" drew a large audience to the
Columbia last night. All present enjoyed
the play thoroughly, and Mr. Mantell and
Miss Roselle Knott were called before
the curtain on several occasions as a
mark of the audience's appreciation.
The scene in the waiting-room of the
Dlltgence gave room for a very clever
piece of acting: on the part of Miss Knott
and Miss Russell, and was warmly ap
plauded. "The Face In the Moonlight is
sure to crowd the Columbia throughout
the -week. ___
The Grand Opera House.
Fun and pathos nicely blended were
the features at the Grand Opera House
last night when Dan Sully's comedy,
"The Corner Grocery," was produced to
a fair-sized audience. The mischievous
pranks of Jamesey, the bad boy, par
ticularly in the first act. kept the au
dience in roars of laughter. Maud Edna.
Hall distinguished herself as the boy and
in the last act earned well-deserved ap
plause for her songs. Frank Llndon as
Daddy Nolan and Fred J. Butler as Law
yer Rapp did excellent work, each part
being admirably portrayed. The scene at
the close of the second act, when Daddy
imagines that his son Tom is a thief, was
strikingly effective. William R. I>ailey.
who he? been specially engaged for this
week, made a hit as Henry Budweiser,
the German grocer. Julia Blanc as Mrs.
Nolan and Queen Pursell as Jennie Burke
wore as usual well suited in their parts
and Mortimer Snow made as much as
possible out of the part of Tnm Nolan.
The specialties of Master Jack Robertson
and Little Alma Wuthrich ewer ap
plauded.
The Tivoli.
The Iroquols Club attended the Tivoli
in a body last evening to see "Ship
Ahoy." Their enthusiasm was great at
the climax of the first act when John J.
Raffael, assisted by the leading members
of the company, sang the national airs.
He was obliged to sing the "btar
Spangled Banner" time and time again
and "Dixie" also called for cheers from
the audience. " , Â
During the third act Miss Helen Mer
rill, attired as Columbia, sang a song
specially composed for her, entitled ' free
dom Forever," and only after she had
repeated the verses twice was she able
to give place to the others.
This is the second week of the opera,
but the catchy music and the patriotic
songs promise to draw equally well this
week as last. Stevens. I-eary and Fred
[ Kavanaugh kept the audience continually
in laughter, and Edna Hall was best ap
preciated in her duet with the comedian.
Helen Merrill and Carrie Roma did well,
while Bronson. Raffael and Royce were
up to their usual standard.
At the Alcazar.
"Young Mrs. Winthrop" "caught on" at
the Alcazar last night as few pieces have
"caught on." The company fitted the
characters as neatly as a kid glove. Gert
rude Foster sustained the reputation
which she had already made and played
the role of the wronged and jealous wife
with a naturalness and a lack of affecta
tion that drew tears from the eyes of even
the most hardened thoater-goer.
Miss Jessie Shirley divided the honors
with hef in as neat a bit of acting as has
ever been seen on the stage of this cozy
place of amusement. All the old favorites
were at their best, and "Young Mrs. Wln
throp" is destined to have a most suc
cessful run.
At the California.
In the dramatized version of Oulda'a
"Moths" last night Miss Gillette made an
acceptable Vere. She looked the part, too,
for she was not a bit fascinating:, and In
this respect she was well matched in her
lover, the Ralph de Correze, whose brev
ity of stature was equaled only by the
length of his protestations of undying
loye. The lines wore well read and the
roles were consistently performed. The
star of the play was Miss Dunars. the
typical American girl, as seen through
the eyes of Ouida. She was a strong and
a pleasant foil to the grief-laden and too
patient Vere. Miss Dunar* was well sup
ported by Mr. Charters, the Duke of Mull.
The Lady Dolly Vanderdecken of MiS3
McAllister was an artistic piece of work.
Miss Beckwith is pretty, and the audl
enee took it as a matter of course that
Prince Zouroff should have fallen in love
with her in preference to his own wife.
Mr. Duffleld as Lord Jura had the advan
tage of a role that appealed to the sym
pathy of his audience. Whatever of
beauty was lacking In the actor was more
than made up for by earnest work.
At the Chutes.
At the Chutes Theater the new vaude
ville bill was greeted with favor, and Oro.
Bell and Oro in "Fun in a Chinese Laun
dry" made an especial hit. The moving
pictures, showing the burial of the Maine
sailors at Havana, and the lowa in ac
tion, are very effective and the new "Vis
lons of Art" are pretty. The Zoo is being
constantly enlarged and a group of sea
lions is the latest addition. Matinees
are given every day.

DEATH OF POLICE JUDGE CAMPBELL.
THE El
CAME VERT
SUDDENLY
Stricken by Apoplexy
While Attending
a Meeting.
.
Died Within Ten Minutes
of the Time He Was
Taken 111.
Was an Unique Figure in the
Public Life of San Fran
Â« cisco.
UNLUCKY IS NUMBER 13.
â 
Tragic Circumstances Surrounding
the Last Moments of the
Magistrate.
Police Judg-e James A. Campbell died
suddenly shortly after 8 o'clock last
evening: from a stroke of apoplexy that
prostrated him while he was attending
a meeting of the Society of Old Friends
at 110 Ellis street.
His death was wholly unexpected, as
he was in the best of health and spirits
up to within ten minutes of the moment
when he breathed his last. He had been
engaged during the day in the trial of
an important criminal case and had
dropped in to attend the meeting of.
the society, of which he was a member,
prior to joining his nephew at the the
ater. The attack of the disease was as
sudden as it was unexpected, and al
though medical aid was at hand noth
ing could be done to avert the fatal
termination of the malady. ,
By the death of Judge Campbell the
city loses a citizen who occupied a
unique place in public life. It is said,
perhaps truly, thathecould boast of hav
ing more personal friends than any other
man in the State. His popularity wiUi
the masses was nothing short of mar
velous, a fact that was repeatedly
demonstrated by his success at the
polls in the face of the most deter
mined opposition from those sources
that are supposed to be the power in
political aiTairs. He was possessed of
a rare judgment of human nature, par
ticularly that of people in the lower
walks of life, and he brought this gift
to his aid in his administration of his
duties as a Police Court Judge. His
clear insight into the hearts and
thoug-hts of others and his fine sense of
justice made him beloved even by
those who Celt the weight of his judi
cial arm.
The circumstances of his death were
strange, almost tragic. A joint meet
ing of the board of directors and the
picnic committee of the Society of Old
Friends was called to meet at the Sau
salito House. 110 Ellis street, last even
ing, and Judge Campbell, as president
of the society, attended the meeting.
When he arrived ut the house shortly
after 8 o'clock there were a number of
the members of the committee
not present and those who had
arrived were playing a game
of cards while awaiting their arrival.
J. E. Slinkey. the proprietor of the
place in which the meeting was held,
and also the secretary of the society of
Old Friends, was playing in the game,
and when the Judge came he asked him
to take his place. Judge Campbell sat
down to the game, and when he picked
up his cards asked how many points he
had to go. One of the players told him
that he needed thirteen. The Judge, in
his jolly way, remarked: "Thirteen?
Well, that is an unlucky number."
The game went on and Judge Camp
bell was the first to play out his hand.
He rose from the table and complained
of pains in his left shoulder, arm and
hand, and left the room. One of the
party followed him into the hallway,
and finding that the Judge was ill
called Dr. V. Condory, who felt his
pulse and found that the heart action
was very weak, and as the Judge

Our little boy was only three months old
when he was taken with Eczema that broke
out in the most horrible state. His face wu
full of scabs, and some parts of the flesh were
raw. We used CunctraA Soap, and one
box of the Ccticura (ointment), and in one

POLICE JUDGE JAMES A. CAMPBELL.
seemed to be growing worse rapidly,
had him tuken to a private room. The
Judge seemed to realize that he was in
a serious condition, for while he was
being put to bed he said to the crowd
of alarmed friends who surrounded
him: "I believe I am going to die."
Medicine was sent for and while
awaiting its arrival the sick man was
rubbed by the men in the room in or
der to keep up the circulation. Drs.
Noble and Wflcox were called in, but
in spite of their efforts the Judge died
at 8:40 o'clock, ten minutes after he
first complained of being ill.
The doctors in attendance agreed
that the cause of death was apoplexy.
They will -robably sign a death cer
tificate which will be countersigned by
the Coroner, so an inquest will not be
held. Deputy Coroner J. G. Tyrcll was
notified of the death, and took posses
sion of the effects of the deceased, but
instead of taking the body to tire
Morgue allowed the friends to have it
taken to Porter & White's undertaking
parlors.
Archie Campbell, the nephew of the
Judp-e, was at the Alcazar Theater,
where the Judg-p was to meet him af
ter he had finished with the Old
Friends' meeting. He was notified of
his uncle's death, and arrived on the
WHERE THE JUDGE BECAME ILL,
Cross Marks Where the Judge Sat for His Last Game of Cards,
Bcene after the Judge had passed
away. The shock of hearing the unex
pected news completely unnerved him,
and when he reached the room in which
the body lay he was quite over
come, and seemed dazed and hardly
able to comprehend what had hap
pened.
The meeting which ended bo disas
trously was called to make arrange
ments for the annual picnic of the So
ciety of Old Friends which was to
commemorate the thirty-fourth anni
versary of the founding of the organi
zation. The rucnic was to have been
held at "Wild Wood Glen, Sausalito, on
Decoration day May 30. Judge Camp
bell was one of the prime movers in the
affair, and while no official action was
taken by the committee there was some
talk last evening of postponing the
celebration.
Among those who were present in the
room when the Judge was taken ill and
who stayed with him till his death
were: Ed Head, Captain J. W. Howeli,
M. D. Garrett, James O'Conner, F. W.
Croudace, J. lv. Slinkey, B. B. Roberts,
Reel B. Terry, F. W. Read, D. Chris
topher and Dr. Knowlton.
The Judge was engaged all yesterday
afternoon in trying the case of assault
to murder against the Chinaman, Lee
Poy, and seemed in the best of health
up to the time the attack came on him
last evening. No one ever heard him
complain of any weakness of the heart
or that he was ever taken with a stroke
of apoplexy so his sudden death was
quite unexpected by all who knew him.
He was but 48 years old, strong and
robust and thought nothing of long
rides on his wheel, of which he was
very fond.
Judge Campbell was born In Penn
sylvania in 1850. His father was a
school teacher in various parts of the j
country for many years axid finally
drifted to Oregon, where the Judge j
completed his education. He studied !
Jaw with an eminent lawyer there j
and was admitted to the bar and prac
ticed his profession in Astoria for a
number of years. He came to San 1
Francisco about nine years ago and !
practiced law, principally in the police [
courts, until his election to the office j
of Judge. He was a prominent member
of the Masonic order, the Odd Fellows j
and the Society of Old Friends. In his !
position as Police Judge he saw a great j
deal of the shady side of life, and in
his studies of the inhabitants of the
city saw that the Salvation Army was

doing good work among them. He
became an honorary member of the
organization and lent them considera
ble support. One trait of the Judge's
character, which but few knew, was
his kindness to his father and mother.
The father died recently, but his
mother is still living in Oregon. The
first thing he did when he drew his
salary warrant each month was to
send his parents a liberal sized check
to aid in their support.
In 1891 the dead jurist was appointed
Justice of thp Peace to fill the vacancy
caused by the death of Justice Wolf.
He served for about a year, and was
afterward elected Police Judge. Alto
gether he has served three terms as
Police Magistrate, and was seriously
thinking of seeking the nomination for
District Attorney at the next election.
The announcement that Judge Camp
bell had died suddenly cast a gloom
about the City Hall, where he had a
number of friends. Judge Joachimsen
was considerably gTieved when he
heard of his associate's death, and
spoke feelingly of his sudden demise.
Judge Campbell leaves a widow and
a 17-year-old daughter, who live in
Berkeley.
Arrangements for the funeral have
not been made as yet, but it is prob-
able that some of the numerous organ
izations of which the Judge was a
member will have charge of the inter
ment. The Society of Old Friends will
attend the services in a body.
BUNKER HILL ASSOCIATION
Will Celebrate the One Hundred and
Twenty-third Anniversary of
the Battle of Los Oatos.
The joint committee of arrangements
of the Bunker Hill Association and the
Native Sons of Vermont met last night
at the Occidental to perfect plans for the
celebration of Bunker Hill day, June 17,
in a manner surpassing all previous ef
forts in that regard. Great enthusiasm
was manifested and the various sub-com
mittees reported progress. This year will
be the 123 d anniversary of the battle, and
it is proposed to hold the celebration at
Los Gatos at a newly decorated park
called "Bunker Hill Park." It promises
to be an elaborate affair, for the citizens
of Los Gatos, headed by the Board of
Trade, will combine with the two asso
ciations here in making it a grand
success.
A patriotic communication was re
ceived from the Society of California
Pioneers, in which it was stated that they
would certainly co-operate in fittingly
observing the day.
A communication was also received
from Superintendent of Schools Webster
that he would have flags dlsplaved from
all school buildings on Bunker Hill day
and that he would convey to the Board
of Education the invitation to participate
in the exercises.
Invitations were extended to the offi
cers and members of tne Academy of
Sciences, Mayor Phelan. Board of Super
visors and various other officials to at
tend.

A jury was impaneled in Judge Bor

Weathers, who shot and killed Nathan
Phillips, a bartender, in the Empire
Theater early on the morning of January
27 last. Weathers claimed that he had
been robbed, and, drawing a revolver
threatened to shoot unless his money
was returned to him. In a row that fol
lowed he fired several shots, and one of
the bullets struck Phillips, killing him

FUSION NOW
HANGING IN
THE BALANCE
Three Silver Parties
Endeavoring to Join
Forces.
Democratic, Silver Re
publican and People's
Parties Confer.
Owing to the Selection of a
Date No Agreement Could
Be Reached.
LEFT TO THE DEMOCRATS.
That Party Will Have to Decide the
Issue and in the Near Fu
ture.
Whether or not the Democratic, Peo
ple's party and Silver Republicans will
fuse, will combine their forces in the
cause of silver in an endeavor to walk
over the Republican party next elec
tion, now rests with the first named or
ganization. A meeting of sub-commit
tees of the State Central Committees
of the three parties was held in the
maple room of the Palace Hotel yester
day afternoon for the purpose of con
summating a fusion if possible, but as
the People's party committee men came
with their hands practically tied the
meeting was forced to adjourn, the fate
of the fusion idea still hanging in the
balance.
The stumbling block in the road of
the fusion committee was the fact that
the executive committee of the State
Central Committee of the People's
party met in this city on May 4 last
and decided upon a day and place for
the holding of its convention and the
sub-committee was not gifted with the
power to change that committee's de
cision. This condition existing in or
der to reap the advantages and benefits
of fusion the two other parties must
almost necessarily hold their conven
tions in the same place and on the same
date. Although the place decided upon
by the People's party for its conven
tion, Sacramento, is not objected to by
the other parties the committee repre
senting the Democratic party did not
favor the idea of as early a date as
that decided upon by the People's party
committee, July 12, and in various ways
it manifested its displeasure. In the
minds of the Democrats it would be
wise to select a later date and on this
point fusion hangs. An effort will be
made to influence the People's party
State Central Committee to change the
selected date. If this is accomplished
the difference of opinion at present ex
isting will be adjusted and the three
parties will doubtless be brought to
gether. The Silver Republican wing is
willing to be governed by the decision
of the two oth^r parties and this makes
the road to fusion an easy one. If the
People's party cannot or will not
change the date set for its convention
then the Democrats may bow to its will
and go into convention on the same
date and in the capital city.
That the parties are willing and
anxious to fuse is manifest in the fol
lowing resolution passed at the meet
ing yesterday, and if the one obstruc
tion regarding the date can be satis
factorily removed from their pathway
the three parties will doubtless sit down
to build up a ticket together:
It is the unanimous sense of this
conference that it is desirable that !
there should be a union of the Demo
cratic, People's and Silver Republi
can party in the coming campaign ;
upon a reasonable and equable basis,
with reference to platform and State, I
Congressional, Legislative and local !
tickets; that this union is hereby
recommended; that the plan and de
tails of the union be left to the fur
ther conferences and agreements of
the representatives of the several
parties; that it is further recom
mended that the conventions of the
several parties be held at the same
time and place; that this conference
be adjourned subject to the call of
the chair in order that the further
opinion pf the different authortative
bodies of the several parties may be
obtained by the representative sub
committees.
As soon as the fusion of the party Is
consummated, then the labor of divid
ing the loaves and fishes must be taken
up. Doubtless the Democratic wing,
owing to its strength, will demand a
much larger space on the ticket than
it will be willing to allot to the other
parties, and here again may be a hitch.
Many meetings of the sub-committees
will be held, however, prior to conven
tion time and an understanding
reached that will admit of smooth
sailing when a ticket comes to be
builded.
If fusion comes to pass then a plat
form must be drawn up, and by a de
cision of the executive committee of
the State central committee of the !
People's party it will be almost identi- j
cal, if not precisely the same, as that |
adopted by the reform forces of Ore- j
gon. It is as follows:
United In a common cause for the sacred

ment by the whole people, In fact as well as
In name, restoring and maintaining equality
under the government of all classes, we, the
People"s, Democratic and Silver Republican

the following declaration of principles and to !
the carrying out of which we solemnly pledge i
each and every candidate upon our united '
ticket.
We demand the free and unrestricted coin

to the national banks, ns presented by the bill
drawn by the Republican Secretary of the
Treasury and Indorsed by President McKlnley: !
and we especially denounce the avowed at
tempt by said bill to fasten the country Irre
vocably and forever to the single gold standard.
We demand a national money, safe and

without the Intervention of banks of issue, to
be a full legal tender for all debts, public and
private; also, a Just, equitable and efficient
means of distribution direct to the people
through the lawful disbursements of the gov

We demand that the volume of circulating
medium be speedily increased to an amount
sufficient to meet the demands of the business
and population of this country, and to restore
the Just level of prices of labor and produc
tion.
We favor uueh legislation as will prevent f->r

We demand that postal savings banks be es

We demand the election of United States

We demand the Initiative and referendum

THE DEMOCRATS.
Bosses Rainey and Phelan Both
to Ba Ignored.
The good Democrats of Sisklyou and
San Diego and of all intermediate
points in the interior of the State are ;
to take a hand in the affairs of the i
local Democracy. Such, in effect, is
the decision of the subcommittee of the
Democratic State Central Committee
which has for three days past been j
struggling with the problem of how to j
harmonize the local Democracy.
The committee met again yesterday |
afternoon at the California Hotel and i
agreed upon a report that is to be for- j
muiated when the State Central Com
mittee meets on May 28. Each mem
ber of the committee was sworn to se
crecy as to the nature of this report,
and Chairman Alford, who Is still a
novice at the political game, was ap
pointed grand chief suppressor of facts.
The proceedings of an executive ses
sion are still held to be sacred in the
coyote district from which Alford hails,
so he denied himself the pleasure of
discussing the acts of the committee of
which he is an honored member. Other
members were not so particular.
The committee finally decided yester
day that it would not recognize the
claims of either the Rainey or Phelan
factions of the local Democracy. It also
agreed upon the appointment of a re
organization committee to be, com
posed of not more than fifty and not
less than twenty-five members of the
local Democracy, to be selected from
the city at large, this committee to be
Intrusted with the task of selecting a
new general committee which is to be
the recognized representative body of
the Democratic party of San Francisco.
Up to this point the deliberations of
the committee were as harmonious as
could be expected, but when it came
to the naming of the reorganization
committee the fun began. The Phelan
reformers, represented by Gavin Mc-
Nab, displayed an inclination to take
everything in sight. As a result the
other side indulged in some loud talk,
biting personalities and dire threats,
and for a time it looked as though the
police would have to be called in to
suppress the riot.
It being manifestly Impossible to ar
rive at any agreement as to the per
sonnel of the reorganization commit
tee the fighters finally decided to de
fer Its appointment until the meeting
to be held on March 28. It is not at
all certain that the reorganization com
mittee will be named at that time, for
there seems to be no prospect of har
monizing the different factions repre
sented in the subcommittee. Even
should a majority agree upon a course
of action the whole matter will still be
In the air. It rests with the State Cen
tral Committee to ratify or reject the
action of the subcommittee, and it goes
without saying that the men who hayÂ«
control of the State body will finally
decide the opposing claims of the Phe
lan and Rainey factions.
Should the faction which is deposed
refuse to accept the decision of the
State Central Committee the effect will
=tt ill be the same. Th* delegates of the
rebels will not rpceive recognition on
the floor of the State convention, their
fate being Identical with that of the
Buckley delegates at the 1896 conven-
The following resolution was adopted:
It Is mnvefl that It be the sense of this
committee that there should he a union of
the Democratic. Peoples Party and Silver Re
publican Party. If the same can be accom
plished on a fair and equitable basis. In the
romin* campaign. It Is the further se.nse of
this committee that the convention should not
be held as early ns the !2th day of July.
Chairman Alford will leave for his
home in Tulare to-day, taking with him
the secrets of the committee over which
he has presided during .the past three
days. _____________
TROLLEYS ON SIXTH STBEET.
Merchants' Association Asks for Bet
ter Service South ol Market.
The Merchants' Association has sent a
letter to General Manager Vlning of the
Market street railway system advising
the operation of an electric car line the
length of Sixth street and transferring to
some of the main lines running to Gold
en Gate Park and the ferries. The letter
states that the association has started
the work of repaying Sixth street and
now has the signatures of most of the
property owners for the improvement
from Market to Mission and expects to
have all the property owners along the
thoroughfare to the foot of the street be
fore long. The suggestion Is made that
now is the time to change the old one
horse car line into an electric car system.
If this is done it will save repaying out
side of the rails twice.
In a letter from Vining to the associa
tion, sent some time ago, the writer stated
that If desirable connections could be
made north of Market street, the com
pany would be willing to make the change.
The association suggests a route along
Sixth and Taylor streets to Post, trans
ferring to all of the lines east and west.
If the suggestion made, says the letter,
does not meet with the approval of the
company, another route could be taken
along Sixth street to Brannan, then down
to Fifth and back to Market, which would
give improved service on Fifth and Sixth
streets.
The Ponies Please.
There is no decrease in the popularity
of Norris' pony and dog show that is now
appearing in Central Park. The tent was
crowded last night with grown people
and children, and the former seemed to
derive as much enjoyment out of the
wonderful antics of the nearly human
animals. There will be regular afternoon
and evening performances throughout the
week.
