WASHINGTON, July 10. â Shortly after midnight the War Department gave out the
following dispatch from General Shafter:
"PLAY A DEL ESTE. July 10. â Adjutant General, Washington: Headquarters Fifth
Corps, July 10. â Enemy opened fire a few minutes past 4 with light guns, which were soon
silenced by ours. Very little musketry firing, and the enemey kept entirely in the entrench
ments. Three men slightly wounded. Will have considerable forces to-morrow â enough to
completely blockade the roads. General Garcia reports that enemy evacuated little town
called Descanios, about three miles from Santiago and near the bay. SHAFTER."
WASHINGTON, July 10.â
The bombardment of Santiago
has begun.
That was the verbal informa
tion obtained this evening shortly
before 9 o'clock at the War De
partment
Almost immediately three bul
letins were posted, the most im
portant of which was from Gen- !
eral Shafter. This announced
that General Toral, who succeed
ed Linares when the latter was
wounded, had declined to sur
render and that the bombard
ment of the town would be be
gun by the army and navy about
4 o'clock this afternoon.
The fact that the bombard
ment was scheduled by Shafter
to begin so late in the day created
some comment, but no explana
tion of it was offered. In answer
to questions bearing upon that
movement General Corbin said:
"I have not the slightest infor
mation as to the reasons General
Shafter had for beginning the
bombardment at the hour he
names, but it was probably be
cause he was ready just at that
time. You can speculate about
that as well as I can."
Information received by the
War Department during the few
days of the truce indicates that he
has materially strengthened his
position. During the past week
he has received reinforcements
of both artillery and infantry.
Randolph's battery of twenty
four guns which left Key West
last Tuesday at midnight is now
in operation before Santiago and,
as one of the War Department
officials expressed it, "When
these long Toms of Randolph be
gin to talk, something will hap
pen in Santiago."
General Shafter has nearly fifty
siege guns and a large number of
REALIZING HOPELESSNESS,
SPAIN MUST SEEK PEACE.
MADRID, July 10. Information received from the most reliable sources is to the effect that the darkest
pessimism pervades Madrid officialdom. The hopelessness of the war is finally recognized, and the peace idea now
seems to predominate in the Cabinet and negotiations are considered urgent. The Cabinet is likely to cohere un
til peace is secured.
It is now recognized that Santiago de Cuba is completely beleagured and cannot hold out owing to the lack
of provision- and munitions of war. It is considered certain that the Americans will blockade Cuban and Porto
Rican ports, rutting off their supplies, while the authorities are convinced that an American fleet is coming to the
peninsula. There is no confidence felt that the powers will intervene even if defenseless seaports are bombarded,
and, therefore, what measures of defense are possible are being made.
PARIS, July io. â The Madrid correspondent of the Tempes says: The end is impatiently awaited, even the
Government no longer attempting to disguise its conviction that after the fall of Santiago the time will have come
for thinking about overtures of peace, especially as all the European chancellories advise this course.
The San Francisco Call
6-inch mortars, besides light ar
tillery, at his disposition. These
guns, taken in connection with
the wreck that can be done by the
fleet, will, it is believed, carry ter
ror and destruction to Santiago.
Anxiety has been expressed by
the War Department officials as
to whether General Shafter had a
i sufficient force to prevent the
evacuation of Santiago by the
enemy. This anxiety was allayed
about half-past 12 to-night by the
receipt of a dispatch from Gen
eral Shafter, which contained
confirmation, too, of the earlier
reports of the beginning of the
bombardment.
The belief is held by the best
informed officers that General To
ral, the Spanish commander, will
j surrender when he finds it will be
! impossible for him to evacuate
1 the city. Upon what grounds
I this belief is based could not be
ascertained, but that information
I to that effect is in the hands of
I the war officials there is no doubt.
General Shafter's dispatch to
night shows that he is engaged
now in strengthening his posi
tion and to-morrow will follow up
his operations with a final assault
! upon the city.
TORAL MUST SOON
SURRENDER SANTIAGO

GENERAL SHAFTER'S HEAD
QUARTERS before Santiago, July 9 (by
the Call-Herald dispatch boat Golden
Rod to Port Antonio, Jamaica, July
10). â Before this dispatch reaches you
the bombardment of Santiago will have
begun. Negotiations for the peaceful
surrender of the beleaguered city are at
an end, and Admiral Sampson and Gen
eral Shafter have perfected their plans
for the city's destruction.
General Toral, realizing his desperate
position, has been sparring to obtain
from General Shafter the best possible
terms, but all his proposals have been
rejected. General Shafter has delivered
his ultimatum, demanding the uncon

dltional surrender of the city. General
Toral has declined to capitulate on
these terms.
General Shafter this morning re
ceived a letter from General Toral pro
posing to evacuate the city under con
ditions which would irsure the free
dom of the Spanish forces. In this let
ter General Toral attempted to conceal
his realization of his hopeless position.
With boastful assurance he called Gen
eral Shafter's attention to the fact that
he had received a large number of re
inforcements, and declared that his en
tire garrison was strongly intrenched
in a commanding position. He also as
serted that he had plenty of ammuni
tion and expressed the firm conviction
that the Americans could not take the
city by assault without sustaining an
enormous loss of life.
General Toral proposed that the
Spanish army should evacuate Santi
ago and the province of Santiago de
Cuba unmolested, taking all of their
cannon, arms, ammunition and
standards, together with their sick and
wounded. "I shall never surrender the
city except on these terms," the Span
ish general declared.
General Shafter, after receiving this
letter, was helped into a carriage and
was driven to the front. After con
sulting with General Wheeler the
American commander sent a reply to
General Toral. in which he refused to
entertain the Spaniard's proposition.
The bombardment, as planned, was
to begin from the fleet off Aguadores,
covering the advance of the infantry
upon that fortification, the infantry to
be further under the cover of sixteen
3.2-lnch guns toward the left of the
line on the ridge of El Pozo. The Rough
Riders are in the center of the line
with their dynamite gun, the infantry
taking little part in the general attack,
except on the left. Eight mortars also
are advantageously placed in the cen
ter. The siege guns are on the heights
of San Juan. On the extreme left is
General Kent's brigade, with batteries

BIG GUNS PLACED
DURING THE TRUCE
Copyrighted, 1808, by the Associated Press.
BEFORE SANTIAGO, Saturday, July
9 (per Associated Press dispatch boat
Wanda, via Port Antonio, Jamaica,
July 10).â Everything is now ready for
the commencement of hostilities in case
the Spanish generals do not surrender.
PORT MAHON, FSLAND OF MINORCA, AS SEEN FROM THE ENTRANCE,
It Is One of t\)Z F' nest Harbors in the Mediterranean, and Y\qs Been Occupied by the Spanish
Since 1802. It Is Probable Trjat Port Mahon Will Be One of t^e Objective Points of Con)
roodore Watsoo's Squadron.
The dynamite gun, which has been in
position for several days, is now in
better working order than at the* time
of the lattle of San Juan, and it is pre
dicted that its charges, consisting of
twenty pounds of guncotton and gela
tine, will work havoc in the Spanish
trenches when it opens fire.
Twelve mortars in one battery are
mounted and ready to do effective work
in shelling the city.
Three batteries of artillery are now
posted on El Paso ridge, 2400 yards
from the town, and the Capron and
Grimes batteries are 1500 yards to the
north of the road in the rear of Gen
eral Lawton's division. In firing, the
field guns will be compelled to shell
the town over the heads of our men,
but the artillery officers say it can be
done safely and without injury to our
soldiers. The dynamite gun has been
so placed that it will be able to enfilade
the Spanish lines. On the other hand,
during the truce, which so far as re
gards the continuing of preparations
for defense or attack has been no truce
whatever, the Spaniards have not' been
idle. They have been mounting guns,
and some of these are of much heavier
caliber than any the American army
can bring into play.
When hostilities reopen by the bom
bardment great things are expected
from the navy. Admiral Sampson is
quoted throughout the army as saying
that he will drop one shell into the city
every five minutes, and if that is not
sufficient to do the work he will drop
one in the city every two minutes. The
fire, in addition to what the land forces
will turn in, it is thought, will be suffi
cient to reduce the Spaniards to a point
where they will surrender.
Sixteen Spanish prisoners, who were
wounded, were turned over to the
Spaniards yesterday afternoon. Dr.
George Goodfellow and Captain Dryer
escorted the ambulances and the corre
spondent of the Associated Press ac
companied them. The Spaniards dis
played great gratitude for the kind
ness, and there was considerable fra
ternizing, in which the Spanish officers'
desire for peace stood out like a head
light in a fog. There is no dought that
the subordinate Spanish officers are
anxious to surrender, but they practi
cally said that upon General Toral's
decision this would rest. They ad
mitted that they were short of pro
visions, but all appeared to be deter
mined and resolute and willing to die,
If need be, in the defense of the city.

BY CAPTIVE
SPANIARDS
Vivid Narratives of tr;e
Destruction of Cervera's
Squadror).
Special dispatch to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted. 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett.
NEW YORK, July 10.â Admiral Cer
vera, with fifty-four of the officers of
his destroyed squadron and 638 other
prisoners taken from his ships oft! San
tiago, reached Portsmouth, N. H., to
day on the auxiliary cruiser St. Louis.
On the voyage north all the captives
but one were given parole and were
treated more as guests than as prison
ers. When the cruiser dropped anchor
in the outer bay of Portsmouth The
Call-Herald correspondent obtained an
Interview with Admiral Cervera, who
threw a great deal of light on matters
that preceded his attempted escape
from Santiago harbor. He received
three orders from the Minister of Ma
rine to leave, he said, and finally a
fourth came directing him to go out
and fight the American fleet, no matter
what the consequences. His plan was
to attack the Brooklyn first, break
through the American lines, run to
Havana and seek refuge in the harbor
there. He knew that the order meant
suicide, he said, but he obeyed It.
He said that if the Americans attack
Havana they will meet with terrible re
sistance and loss of ships and men.
Santiago will fall, he says, unless Li
nares is reinforced. The correspondent
also obtained remarkably interesting
interviews with other officers of the
Spanish fleet, descriptions of the parts
played by every American ship on that
day of glorious victory, a splendid tale
of sea fighting told by the chaplain of
the Texas and altogether a most com
plete and vivid narrative of the de
struction of Cervera's squadron.
PATHETIC STORY OF A
SPANISH NAVAL OFFICER
PORTSMOUTH, N. H., July 10.â This
Is a plain tale of the Spanish disaster as
rendered by Captain Maocrohon, second
captain of the Maria Teresa. His chief,
It will be remembered, was desperately
wounded during the fight.
"I love my country," said the Span
iard simply, "and my heart bleeds for
her now. Our fleet, my country's pride,
has been destroyed. I fear there will
be an uprising at home when its de
struction is made known.
"Our plan for escape was well ar
ranged, but better formulated than ex
ecuted. We had arranged to force our
way out on Saturday night, and the
Maria Teresa was to have led. But,
contrary to our expectations, the
searchlights of your ships did not illu
mine the channel that night, as had
been usual, and without that light we
were unable to discern the wreck of the
Merrimac, so we could not go out. You
know how we came out next morning â
Sunday that was.
"Crowds were expected to come down
to the wharf to see us off, but the
American troops were pushing the city
too hard in front, and there were none
to see us. Our orders were to steam at
full speed to westward after clearing
the harbor and concentrate our attack
on the Brooklyn, paying no attention
to any of the other ships unless they
forced us to attack them. So in the
morning they signaled to us from the
battery that only the Texas and Brook
lyn were to the westward, and we got
under way, the Maria Teresa, be
ing the flagship, taking the lead. We
opened fire on the Brooklyn and the
Texas answered it, but her shot fell
short; otherwise she would have struck
us, for it was a straight-line shot. The
Brooklyn and lowa then fired, but nei
ther shot hit. Again the Brooklyn and
Texas fired. The Brooklyn's shell went
into the admiral's cabin and, explod
ing, set fire to the after part of the
ship. A shell from the Texas pierced
our side armor and exploded in the en
gine room, bursting the main steam
pipes. We signaled to the engineer to
start the pumps, but got no reply, and
then found that all below in that part
of the ship had been killed.
"At th -t time it was like hell on our
bridge. Shells were bursting all around
us and the ship's hull was being riddled
below. The captain turned to me and
said:
" 'Sir, do you think it best to continue
this hopeless fight, or for the sake of
humanity and to save life should we

not beach the ship? Many of our guns
are dismounted and our engines are
crippled. 1
" 'Sir,' I replied, 'We are unable to
fight longer. Let us beach the shii. '
"Then, as I said that, a shell struck
our captain. His last words were to
haul down the colors. The American
fire was so fierce and their shells were
bursting around us so fast and making
so much smoke that the Americans
could not see that our flag was down
and continued firing. I sent below for
a blanket, and as soon as that was run
up the firing ceased.
"Meanwhile the Vizcaya had run be
tween us and the Texas and was then
engaging three shipsâ the Brooklyn,
Oregon and Texas. She made a des
perate but hopeless fight. Now that we
have learned that we lost between 800
and 1000 men and the Americans lost
only one man it amazes us. It is in
credible. "We cannot comprehend It.
It does not seem possible. And yet we
must believe it. Have we not seen with
our own eyes the utter wrecks of our
ships and how yours were not hurt â
even the smallest injury that we could
see?"
"If you had managed to escape where
would you have gone? To Cienfuegos?"
"By no means," the officer replied.

"our intention was to run to Havana,
raise the blockade there and enter the
harbor."
"What will be the result of the bat
tle?" the Spanish commander was
asked.
"Ah, I do not know," was the mourn
ful reply.
"1 hear now that the Americans In
tend sending their fleet to my country.
That is my anxiety. My poor Spain
will be helpless against your attack. I
have seen what your ships can do, and
know our exposed cities will be de

Crank reply. "It will be an awful fight

fall of a great family â "great shall be
the fall thereof.' And I am afraid that
is bow it will be with Spain. Oh, God,
open the eyes of my countrymen at
home that they may understand why
we were defeated here."
I found this to be the general opin
ion among all the captured officers.
They were all free to admit that the
Amt-rican navy man behind his gun ia
the must wonderful man they had ever
dreamed of. The officers expressed
wide-eyed astonishment when told that
it is the custom in the American navy
to exercise crews at battery practice
with full-service charges at frequent
ami regular Intervals.
"But that must cost you tremendous
mom-y." exclaimed one, an officer of
tht? Colon.
Yea," said his companion of the
Vizcaya, "but see the result."
"Do you think Santiago can hold out
much longer 1 ?" the Becond captain of
tin* .Maria Teresa was asked.
"No." he replied; "they are very short
of provisions there. Rice is the chief
article of diet, little else in the way of
t 1 being left. Beef is very scarce
and very poor."
The officer was curious to know as
to whether the Americans had suffered
much loss when their land forces made
an attack on Santiago. He was told
the number reported lost and seemed
surprised that it was no greater.
"Why, we lost that many ourselves,"
he said, "and yet our men were fight
ing behind entrenchments and your
nun were attacking us."
"Was there any council of war called
before it was determined to attempt to
force a passage out?"
"No, not a council â was an in
formal conference. All agreed that the
attempt was well nigh hopeless, and
all of us were convinced that we would
get just what we got."
All of the Spanish officers seemed
deeply distressed over the disaster
which has befallen Spain. They were
no less astonished at their treatment as
prisoners.
"The Spanish prepp," said one, who
begged me not to quote his name, "'is
alone to blame for the awful way in
which we and the country at large
have :eived. We were led to

THE CRISTOBAL COLON'S
FUTILE RACE FOR LIFE
PORTSMOUTH. X. H., Juiv 10.â The
of the ('ristobal Colon's futile at
tempt to escape, her final destruction
and the rescue of her crew is as inter
esting as any bit of history of Spanish
disaster and American victory. The
Colon was the newest of the Spanish
armored cruisers and was reputed to
be the fastest and the best. I have rea
son to believe that Captain Maren, her
commander, was the ablest one in the
entire fleet. That, at any rate, was his
reputation. Being on a dispatch-boat
I was unable to follow the fortunes of
the Colon as she made her grand effort
to escape from the encircling foes. Her
officers told me about it whin I met
them the following morning as prison
ers of war on board the United States
steamship Resolute, formerly the York
town of the Old Dominion line. Captain
James G. Eaton, commanding. By his
courtesy I was allowed to interview the
officers of the stricken Colon. A few of
them could speak English, and their
first query was as to the safety of Cer
vera. I told them their admiral was
safe and unharmed, and there was
much gesticulation and words I could
not understand, and then a shout of
"Viva Cervera."
I had been identified as the corre
spondent of the New York Herald and
San Francisco Call. Each one of the
officers instantly recognized the names
of the papers, and, crowding around
me, begged that I should cable the
names of the survivors of the ship.
After painfully inscribing all the names
I found there was none missing from
the roster, and further inquiry showed
that the Colon had lost only one
man killed and sixteen wounded. The
wounded were under the care of Sur
geon McGlll of the Resolute. The only
officer of the Colon who had been
wounded was the paymaster, whose
face had been torn by the concussion of
a 13-inch shell fired by the Oregon.
Many of the crew succumbed after be
:â¢ X taken on board the Resolute. Dr.
ptcGlll found that a number of them
h^ their lower limbs much inflamed,
ana as a result of careful examination
and close questioning he discovered
that the inflammation was due to bites
of insects and subsequent poisons from
the scratching of dirty nails, they ap
parently having known nothing more
cleansing than the filthy water of San
tiago Hay.
To lead up to the more recent and
greatest disaster, I asked the assem
blage of officers grouped around me
what they thought of the Manila fight.
Apparently th^y did not understand,
and it was with difficulty I managed
to explain that their fleet had been de
stroyed in the Philippines. Polite in
credulity was my reward. An Illus
trated paper showing the destruction
of Montejo's ships by Admiral Dewey's
fleet was on a nearby table. I pre
sented that as a document in evidence.
Tre officers instantly crowded abou: it,
and excited comments told of their
absorbed interest in the pictured story
of Spanish disaster in the far East.
They told me that was the first ihÂ«y
had heard of the affair, and their man
ner left no doubt.

came within range and began hurling
her 13-inch shells at their ship did they

pierced the quarter, and its explosion
ijetwoeen decks had convert?d three
cabins into one. The vessel was on fire
art. Another shell, a 12 or L3-tucta
missile, had struck the vessel near the
stern and had plowed half way to the
bow before exploding. The vessel's
three consorts were destroyed and the
Oregon was gaining on the fugitives
every minute, while the Brooklyn and
Texas were closing in. There was
nothing left but surrender, and turning
her bow to shore the vessel hauled
down her colors.

DESTRUCTION OF THE
FUROR AND PLUTON
PORTSMOUTH, N. H., July 10.-
The experience of the torpedo boat de
stroyers Furor and Pluton is soon told.
j Their commanders, Captains Diego
| Carlier y Vellaquires of the Furor, and
; Pedro Barqual y Perez Do Bargoes of
the Pluton, were both rescued. Each of
1 the boats was manned by a crew of
seventy- two men. Twenty-one were
: saved from the Pluton and seventeen
; from the Furor. The boats cleared San
; tiago harbor in the wake of the cruis
. ers and were soon in the maelstrom of
! shells thrown by the rapid fire batteries
!of the American fleet. One big shell
(Captain Vellaquires says it was a 12
or 13 inch projectile) struck his vessel
amidships, cutting it almost in twain.
j ihe sagging ends dipped under and the
crew endeavored' to save themselves
from drowning by swimming ashore
The Pluton, cut to pieces by the shell
lire, was run ashore.
When asked why the boats had not
made an attack on the blockading fleet
the captain said they were convinced
that such an attack would have re
sulted in disaster to themselves, owing
to Admiral Sampson's system of block
ade and the alertness of the ships under
his command.
During the trip of the St. Louis up
the coast the captain of the Pluton told
Captain Handle of the St. Louis that
he had chased him on the night of May
16 and had come very near sinking him.
Captain Randle recalled the circum
stance, and remembered having seen
a dark object hovering in the wake of
his vessel on the night mentioned The
Pluton's commander said that he had
used every exertion to get within range
of the St. Louis, but that vessel's speed
was too great for him.
HAD SAVED HIS HONOR
BUT LOST HIS SHIP
PORTSMOUTH. N. H., July 10.-
Captain Eulate of the Vizcaya, wound-
I ed and depressed in spirit, said he had
(saved his honor, although he had lost
his ship. That was the wording of a dis
patch which he had sent his wife after
the destruction of the Vizcaya.
"When you think of the odds I en
i countered, you will see that I could do
no more than I did." Captain Eulate
said. "I had only one ship against four.
My enemies were the Brooklyn, Oregon
I and the Texas, and I think the lowa
, was the other. All four punished us
; severely, but it was the Texas that
gave us our coup de grace â a shell fired
from that vessel entering our port bow
and exploding one of the forward mag
azines. My men stood by their guns
j and fought like true Spaniards.
As the Spaniards lost all their ships
and half their number in killed and
wounded and had inflicted no damage
in return, there was none to gainsay
Captain Eulate's claim that his men
had fought like Spaniards.
"But naval conflicts now are not de
termined by courage," sighed the
mournful captain. "Victory is to the
finer machine, and the American ma
chines were better than ours. The
Vizcaya? Ah! she was a fine ship.
And now, what a wreck! Poor Spain!"
Captain Eulate commanded the Viz
caya during that vessel's visit to New
j York harbor a short time after the
Maine disaster. Before that he had
| come into notoriety as the officer who
had ordered the execution of the Com
petitor prisoners.
PLUCKY EFFORTS OF
THE LITTLE ERICSSON
PORTSMOUTH. N. H., July 10.â Out
of many "scraps of deeds and deeds of
daring" of that never to be forgotton
day of Santiago, the adventures and
exploits of the little torpedo boat Erics
son should be brought to light. Lieu
tenant Usher, big, blonde and dashing,
is an officer who would have made a
record like that of Cushing in this Avar
had he been given an opportunity. The
Ericsson was off Siboney when the
Spaniards made their desperate sortie,
and the torpedo boat went racing down
the coast line steering straight for the
thick of battle. The big battleship In
diana, eastward of the blockading
squadron, was heading straight for ihe
entrance of Santiago harbor in order
to block the return of the flying fugi
tives.
Through the smoke of her great bow
puns the Ericsson darted, lunging into
the swirling cloud of smoke that en
shrouded the fleet. But on the star
board bow a huge hull loomed through
a mist of bursting shells, and through
the whirling white a glimpse was had
of the flag of Spain, almost riddled but
still flying.
Over went the helm of the torpedo
boat and around swung the torpedo
tubes. The long-looked-for opportunity
to sink a ship of the enemy at last was
at hand. Nearer and nearer the great
hull loomed through the smoke. At last
the mark was fair, but the next mo
ment she had hauled down her colors.
And so it was. Cut to pieces by shells
and her decks on fire the Vizcaya had
struck her flag. Blindly groping she
found a ledge on which to rest her keel,
and the Ericsson, intent on destruction
a moment before, came near to rescue.
Many of the Vizcaya's men were then
in the water. The flagship signaled to
the Ericsson to drop back and pick them
up. Swimmers were helped on board,
and then Captain Evans of the lowa
signaled the Ericsson to range near the
Vizcaya and rescue the survivors of the
now fiercely burning wreck.
In prompt obedience the Ericsson ran
as close to the burning hulk as the heat
would permit, and a horrible sight was
there. On the port beam, off which the
Ericsson lay, frightful wounds had
been torn In the vessel's side, and
through the gaping orifices the crew on
the Ericsson could see the men of the
Vizcaya's fireroom force being broiled
by the fierce flames of the shell-pro
tected apartment. I have since been
told that they had been battened down
and had no means of egress.
But that was not all the horror.
Swinging from the boat falls were
dozens of men who apparently could
not swim and who had been driven to
those scorching threads of life by the
fierce heat of the burning ship. The
Ericsson could approach no nearer for
fear of being dashed to pieces against
the wreck. Her men shouted to the
wretched victims to jump, but they
would not or could not be made to
understand that efforts would be made
to save them, and not until a number
.of the Ericsson's men had made lines
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JULY 11, 1898.
HURRYING
WATSON'S
SQUADRON
Its Appearance Expected
to Cause Spain to Sooq
Sue for Peace.
NEW YORK, July 10.â The 'Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald tel
egraphs: Confident of the early fall
of Santiago, the Navy Department is
making arrangements which it is ex
pected will result in advancing the date
of the Eastern squadron's departure to
Spain. Instead of proceeding to Mole
St. Nicholas, the rendezvous originally
selected, the colliers, which will be con
voyed by the auxiliary cruiser Yankee,
will sail eastward from Hampton
Roads and join the squadron at a fixed
point. As the Herald stated this morn
ing, the colliers will sail next Thurs
day. The Massachusetts and Oregon,
the battleships attached to the eastern
squadron, will remain at Santiago un
til that city has been captured, when
they will fill their magazines with 400
tons of ammunition and start for Spain
with the cruiser Newark, which is the
flagship, and the auxiliary cruisers
Dixie and Yosemite.
It is not expected by the War Board
that Admiral Camara will seek out the
American ships. His policy will prob
ably be to fight under the protection of
the Spanish shore batteries, leaving the
Canary- Islands to defend themselves as
best they can.
As the tusk of Commodore Watson
has been simplified by the return of
Admiral Camara to Spain, it is ex
pected that he will take possession of
one of the Canary Islands, where he
will station his colliers and operate
from it as a base. Such station will,
of course, necessitate the destruction
of the Spanish force in the Canary
Islands, after which the American fleet
will seek Admiral Camara and destroy
the vessels under his command.
The effect of the appearance of the
fleet in Spanish waters will naturally
interrupt commerce between Spain and
other European powers, and the ad
ministration believes that it will re
sult in the bringing of such pressure
to bear on the Madrid Government that
it will be compelled to sue for peace.
For this reason no preparations are
fast around their bodies and flung
themselves into the sea did the Span
iards seem to understand. One by one
they dropped off, and some were haul
ed on board the rescuing craft, but the
majority were drowned.
The engines of the Vizcaya had not
been stopped, and for hours after she
had struck were faithfully throbbing
at their useless task. Her guns, too,
had been left loaded, and one by one
these boomed a requiem over the dying
ship.
In all the Ericsson picked up nearly
100 survivors, among them the Viz
caya's commander, Captain Eulate. All
of the survivors were barefooted and
st untially clad, and this added to the
terror of this ghastly tragedy. The
steel decks of the torpedo boats were
uncomfortably hot and the barefooted
Spaniards were compelled to execute
a continual dance on the heated plates
to prevent the soles of their feet from
blistering. Many of them were frightful
ly wounded, and here the grim serious
ness of war comes in again. The padre
of the Vizcaya was asked by Lieuten
ant Usher to lend a hand in helping
the wounded, but he was unconcerned
as to their sufferings, and turning a
deaf ear he sat himself on a chest.
That chest happened to be needed for
a woundod man who was writhing on
the heated deck, but the padre refused
to surrender it. Usher motioned to his
muscular young executive. Ensign
Edie, and the padre vacated the chest
immediately and with some loss of dig
nity.
OQUENDO OFFICER
TELLS OF THE BATTLE
PORTSMOUTH, N. H., July 10.â The
captain of Almirante Oquondo suicided
by shuoting himself in the head when
he saw that his vessel was defeated.
One of his staff officers gave this ver
sion of the battle as seen from the
Oquendo:
"As we stood out of the harbor we
were engaged by two ships â the Oregon
and the Texas. I think they were. We
had seen the Texas fire on our forts,
and we knew what she could do with
her guns. Her shooting was always
magnificent and very rapid, so we fired
more at her than we did at the Oregon,
hoping to disable her."
The officer was told that the Oregon
far outclassed the Texas as a fighting
machine, and he seemed surprised to
hear it. "We had always thought," he
said, "that the Texas and the lowa
were the best two ships in the Ameri
can navy. We knew, of course, that the
Brooklyn was very fast; that is why
we planned to concentrate an attack
on her, hoping that if we crippled her
we would be able to run away from the
others."
COMMANDER M'CALLA
WAS EAGER TO FIGHT
PORTSMOUTH, N. H., July 10.â
Guantanamo, the newly conquered har
bor, lying thirty-nine miles to the east
ward of Santiago, received the start
ling news that Cervera was trying to
force his way out at 3 o'clock in the
afternoon. The bay was well populated
with ships, its sheltered waters afford
ing 1 a welcome haven for the weary
keels so long in ceaseless motion with
the bulky swells which forever roll off
Santiago's battered entrance. Among
the vessels that had sought its quiet
for various purposes of repair, for fuel
and for rest were the battle-ship Mas
sachusetts, the cruiser Newark (flag
ship of Commodore Watson), the conÂ»
verted gunboats Suwanee and Hornet
and the torpedo-boats Dupont, Porter
and Foote. In addition there were the
regular guardships of the port, the
cruiser Marblohead and her little con
sort, the gunboat Annapolis, the hospi
tal ship Solace, repair ship Vulcan, two
prizes and about a dozen colliers and
transports.

FEAR THE ARRIVAL
OF WATSON'S SHIPS
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted. IS9B, by James Gor

CADIZ, July lO^The Government
has wired orders to display the utmost
activity, fearing the arrival of the
, American squadron at ait early date.
I Guns and howitzers of 24 and 30 centi
meters have been placed on Punta Car-
I nero. Heavy artillery and a garrison
. have gone to Paloma Rocks, between
Carnero and Algeciras. Senor Oschando
has stated that neither Carnero nor
Ceuta are singly able to dominate the
entrance to the straits, their guns
not being heavy enough, but if well for
tified would prove a formidable bar
i rier to pass.
A special train of twenty-six cars
I has arrived at Algeciras with forty
1 eight quick-firing guns and ammuni
tion stores. Another train of the same
[ sort is coming to-night. The guns are
' being distributed in the neighborhood.
PORT SAID, July 10.â Excepting the
Pelayo and San Augustin, the whole
Spanish fleet has put to sea. Including
the canal pilotage and towage, the
amount paid to the Suez Canal Com
pany by the Spaniards now amounts to
Â£28,160 sterling. The Pelayo and San
Augustin are remaining here to trans
fer coal in the harbor. The Carlos V's
chief engineer died in the canal this
morning, and was buried here this af
ternoon.
GIBRALTAR, July 10.â Lloyd's
agent here has been officially instruct
ed to carefully watch for the passage
of Camara's fleet. Six thousand Span
iards, resident at Algiers, declare they
will resent the presence of Americans
at Ceuta. The authorities fear a water
famine. The stream at Camina is
drying up, and supplies are insuffi
cient for daily requirements.
no press matter was to be delivered or
received at the Guantanamo cable hut,
nor any commercial or personal mes
sages be sent or received, when Colo
nel Allen of the Signal Service came
dashing out of the tent where is lo
cated the wire connecting with Sibo
ney. The colonel wanted a boat, and
wanted it quickly. I offered him the
use of mine and we set off heading for
the Marblehead.
"What's the matter," I inquired.
Allen sent an anxious glance seaward
and urged the boatman to make haste.
"Might as well tell me," I Insisted.
"Your chief has barred me from giving
away any news."
"Cervera and his fleet have escaped,"
Allen said, as he sprang for the sea
ladder of the Marblehead.
Allen disappeared in Commodore Mc-
Calla's cabin, and a moment later I
caught a glimpse of that officer as he
rushed for the bridge. I did not hear
the orders given, but as I jumped into
my boat, accompanied by Colonel Allen,
I heard the click of the steam capstan
and saw a signal go fluttering to the
masthead. At the same instant the im
patient crack of a six-pounder demand
ed attention to the signal. Five minutes
later the Marblehead was going full
tilt for the fleet, which was then rid
dled and awash, but which, so far as
Commodore McCalla knew, was intact
and at sea. Had it been and had the
Marblehead encountered it, I have not
the slightest doubt but that the intrepid
cruiser would have fought them all and
kept up the fight so long as anything
above her water line was left."
FALL OF SANTIAGO
MAY END THE WAR
Peace Spirit Grows in Spain, Though
a Rabid Element Insists on
Further Fighting.
LONDON, July 10.â A special dispatch
from Madrid says: The fall of Santiago
will convince the most sanguine of the
hopelessness of the struggle, and will give
the Government the desired opportunity
at least to suggest an armistice for the de
cision of terms. Circumstantial state
ments are already in circulation to the
effect that the war is virtually ended
and that the Government has actually
opened peace negotiations, but they can
not be verilltd.
A detailed account has been published
of Spain's naval losses â twenty-one war
ship? and twenty-one merchantmen, as
against practically no losses on the Amer
ican side. This tends to convince the
most rabid war advocate, and, as for a
long time past, the whole commercial ana
Industrial interests of Spain are bringing
strong influence to bear in favor of peace.
Every day that passes without disturo
ance strengthens the peace party. It is
believed, however, that there is a strong
undercurrent in favor of continuing the
war, and the attitude of the Carlists and
Republicans causes anxiety.
A mysterious, black-edged, unsigned
manifesto appeared in the leading squares
of Madrid to-day (Sunday) bearing the
municipal stamp and) headed "Gloria Vic
tus," with an angel supporting a dead,
naked soldier. The manifesto contains an
eloquent appeal from Spanish mothers,
calling for the regeneration of the coun
try on the basis of the army, and cry
ing "Down with bribed politicians ann
bought jress." Four million copies of
this manifesto have been distributed
through Spain, and it is attracting con
siderable attention.
The whole of Admiral Camara's squad
ron, with the exception of the Pelayo and
the San Augustin. which are waiting at
Port Said for a transfer of coal, is now
en route for Spain.
Camara's Officers Deeply Affected.
MESSINA, Sicily, July 10.â Last night
the officers of the torpedo boat destroyers
which accompanied Admiral Camara to
Port Said, arrived here on the return
trip. They were greatly affected on learn
ing of the destruction of Admiral Cer
vera's fleet, declaring themselves ready
to make every sacrifice and determined to
fight to the last.
Considered Cuba's Defenses.
MADRID. July 10.â The Cabinet council
to-day, the Ministers declare, did not

trary war was the principal object of the
Government's deliberations. The council
was occupied with a dispatch from Gov
ernor General Blanco detailing his means

CERVERA AND HIS
MEN ARRIVE ON
THE ST. LOUIS
Spanish Prisoners to Be Detained
at the Portsmouth Naval
Reservation,
The Broken-Hearted Old Admiral Will Be Per
mitted to Stop at a Hotel at
Newcastle.
PORTSMOUTH, N. H., July 10.â
auxiliary cruiser St. Louis with 746
Spanish prisoners, including 54 officers,
arrived in Portsmouth harbor at 8:30
o'clock this morning, and a few mm-
utes later dropped anchor just above
Fishing Island The big liner left
Guantanaâ¢ at , âÂ£* Tuesday aÂ£ _
ternoon July 5, and did not make a
stop until she dropped anchor in Ports-
mouth harbor. Including the prisoners
there were 1036 people on board the
boat, and out of this number there
were 91 sick and wounded Spaniards
under the care of surgeons.
Admiral Cervera is confined to his
cabin, having been quite ill for the past
three days althh he was able to be
dressed this morning. Captain Eulate,
who was the commander of the Viz-
caya, and is among the prisoners, is
also quite ill, having been wounded in
the head during the battle off Santi-
ago.
At 9:15 this morning the tug A. W.
Chesterton went alongside the St.
Louis with Health Officer F. S. Towle,
who went on board. He made a thor
ough examination of the vessel, visited
all of the sick, and found that most of
the sickness was due to wounds re
ceived during the battle, or to expo
sure. He says there is no evidence of
yellow fever or other contagious dis
eases, and the people in the vicinity of
where the prisoners are to be confined
need feel no alarm about pestilence
breaking out.
All of the Spanish commisioned of
ficers have been on parole and had the
freedom of the shi > with one exception,
and he was the Governor of Santiago
de Cuba, who was trying to escape
from the city on Admiral Cervera's
flagship, when she was destroyed on
that memorable morning of July 4. He
refused to sign the parole papers, and
consequently was confined in one of the
cabins under guard. The remainder of
the prisoners were confined between
decks and closely guarded. A detach
ment of twenty-eight marines from the
United States steamer Brooklyn, under
Lieutenant Bordan, and twenty-one
marines from the United States steam
er Marhlehead were put aboard the St.
Louis when she left Ouantanamo for
the north, to guard the prisoners, but
they had little or no trouble with the
men.
The prisoners, as well as the Spanish
officers, are dressed in" clothes of every
description, as most of them had come
aboard with very little clothing, and
what they are wearing was given them
by the officers and men from the Amer
ican fleet.
Admiral Cervera remained In his
cabin during the trip. Health Officer
Towle visited him and was warmly
greeted. He shook hands with the
health officer, and in good English said
he was situated very pleasantly on the
boat, and had received nothing but the
kindest and most considerate treat
ment from both officers and men ever
since he had been taken prisoner. He
had not been feeling well for the past
three or four days, but expected to be
all right in a short time. He presents
TORAL'S OFFER
OF SURRENDER IS
AT ONCE REFUSED
Copyrighted. W3B. by the Associated Presa.
ON BOARD THE ASSOCIATED
PRESS BOAT WANDA, OFF JURA
GUA, July 9, via Port Antonio and
Kingston, Jamaica, July 10.â The sur
render of Santiago was formally of
fered by the Spanish commander, Gen
eral Toral to-day, but the conditions
attached caused a prompt refusal of
the offer ljy General Shafter. The ne
gotiations, however, resulted in the ex
tension of the armistice until noon
Sunday, and while flags of truce still
float over the opposing armies.
General Toral's proposal contem
plated the immediate surrender of the
city, but he insisted that his army be
permitted to march away under arms
and with flying colors, and declared
that he would fight to the last ditch
unless the conditions were accepted.
General Shafter replied that nothing
but unconditional surrender would be
considered by him, but he consented to
cable the Spanish offer to Washington,
in the meantime extending the armis
tice.
It was shortly before noon to-day
when a little group of Spanish officers
under a flag of truce came out from
under the yellow wall of the besieged
city and slowly made its way toward
the American line. A detail was sent
to meet them and they were escorted to
comfortable quarters, while the letter
from General Toral was carried to
General Shafter's tent, two miles from
the front. The letter was couched in
the icily courteous terms characteristic
of such communications, and was as
brief as possible. It bore the signature
of General Toral, who commands at
Santiago since General Linares was
wounded, and stated that he was pre
pared to surrender the city provided
his army would be permitted to capit
ulate "with honor." This, he explained,
meant that the Spanish should be un
molested and go in any direction they
wished with arms and flying their col
ors. The letter concluded with the bold
statement that surrender under any
other terms was an impossibility and
would not be considered.
General Shatter immediately cabled
the facts to Washington, and sent to
General Toral a refusal of his proposal,
but added that he would communicate
with his Government and would ex
tend the informal armistice until Sun
day noon.
It is deemed probable that the truce
may extend even beyond the time des
ignated, as the offer of General Toral
to surrender on any terms is regarded
as an indication that the Spanish com
mander has dealded upon surrender
upon the best terms obtainable.

landed with a gig loaded with mail
from the fleet, and it was sent in bags
to the postoffice. Ensign Palmer came
ashore with important official dis
patches for Washington, and left at
2:25 this afternoon with a large grip,
which he would allow no one to han
dle.
Admiral Carpenter has effected the
arrangements to land the prisoners at
their quarters on Seavey's Island to
morrow afternoon, and at 2 o'clock the
tug Piscataqua will take three barges
loaded with prisoners to the island.
On the way up from Santiago a num
ber of the Spanish seamen said that
they had had enough of fighting, at
least with the Yankees.
It is said that Admiral Sampson's re
port to the Navy Department of the de
struction of Cervera's fleet is about
12,000 words. Ensign Palmer carried
the document, which was in book form.
It is understood that Admiral Cer
vera has accepted an invitation to stay
at a hotel at Newcastle, about four
miles from the navy yard.
Admiral Cervera came on deck late
this afternoon and consented to talk
with representatives of the press, who
went out to the St. Louis on a tug.
"You ask me," he said, "how I like
America and I answer that I have al
ways liked and, I may say, loved your
people, but this war has been a duty
with me and the men under me. I
knew the American fleet clearly out
classed us, but it was a question of
fighting either inside or outside the
I harbor. I have many friends in Amer
ica and have only the kindliest feelings
I for them, but every man has a duty to
to his country, and all Span
iards tried to perform that duty. There
has been much feeling in Spain, and I
want all Spain to know the truth, that
every ship of my squadron fought until
the last, and when we could do no more
we surrendered. I have much interest
to know the exact situation in Lpain.
"Captain Goodrich has treated us all
as well as any one could possibly be
treated. My officers have occupied
quarters in the saloon and we cannot
complain."
A telegram was taken out to Admiral
Cervera at 10:30 to-night. Nothing is
known as to the sender or the purport
of the dispatch.
of the American troops is excellent, but
the water supply is poor, and a number
of cases of malarial fever have devel
oped. No deaths have resulted, how
ever, and in nearly all instances the
fever has been broken by a liberal use
of quinine. The hardships of the cam
paign and the fears of possible attacks
of fever have rid the army in the field
and on the coast of non-combatants,
with the exception of a few newspaper
correspondents who have been on th-;
ground since the American warships
appeared off Santiago, and who con
stitute the force able to report the
progress of the war with the assistance
of the dispatch boat service. The sec
ond fleet of transport arrived off
Juragua this morning bearing 2500
troops, including a large detachment of
artillery. If the peace negotiations fail
the heavy guns will be a most valuable
addition to the artillery now in the
field, and it is expected that they will
be rushed forward to the front. The
new troops will be landed to-morrow
and pushed forward as rapidly as pos

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTSMOUTH. N. H., July 10.â I
heard on board the St. Louis the story
of the sinking of the Merrimac first
told from the Spanish side. The Mer
rimac's presence had not been discov
ered until she was well in the channel.
Then the machine guns on the shore
batteries were turned upon her, but
with what effect the Spaniards did not
accurately ascertain. Mines were laid
in two strings across the harbor's en
trance, and one mine from each string
was exploded. About the same time
two torpedoes were fired at the dark
hull occupying the entrance, which, so
far as the defenders knew, was the ad
vance guard of the fleet endeavoring to
force a passage into the harbor. One
.orpedo was sent from the Reina Mer
.edes, and the other from the torpedo
ooat destroyer Pluton, but neither took
effect. Then the Merrimac immolated
herself on her own torpedoes, and Hob
son and his band flung themselves on a
little raft and managed to struggle
clear of the whislpools which were all
around the sinking wreck. The raft
was capsized and the oars and row
locks lost. The flood tide swept it into
Santiago Bay, and a boat from the
Maria Teresa picked it up. Cervera
himself was in the boat and told how
his men had sighted the incoming craft
and how he had wanted the honor of
personally capturing the brave men
who had risked their lives in an effort
to block his ships in the harbor.
Hobson and his party were taken on
board the Relna Mercedes and treated
well. The second officer of the vessel
gave Hobson his stateroom and fitted
him with dry clothing from his own
wardrobe. That officer was killed the
next day by a shell fired from the
American fleet.
General Linares, as soon as he heard
of the capture, demanded the surrender
of the prisoners to his custody. Cer
j vera hesitated, but was forced to com
: ply. Hobson wrote a letter of protest
i to Cervera, which led to an interview
: between himself and the valiant old
I admiral. Cervera explained that It was
i his wish to keep Hobson as his own
; prisoner, but he was obliged to sur-
I render him. Hobson thanked Cervera
| for many kindnesses shown him and
I was then led as a hostage to Linares.
It may be remembered that the Her

Jamaica, July 10.â Since the first day
of July the appearance of the hills
about Santiago has been so altered that
a native would not recognize them.
When I first climbed them there was
nothing in the high waving grass but
dead Spaniards and panting American
soldiers lyin"- on their backs, too hot
and tired to pursue the enemy further.
Now this side of the hills is a succes
sion of bomb-proof rifle pits, trenches
and redoubts, that look like the open
ings of many mines. They threaten
every foot of ground between us and
Santiago, and no army could live un
der the American fire three hours.
Nineteen Spanish soldiers ran into
our lines this morning and surrendered
They say that if their comrades were
once certain of being safe in our lines
they would desert in companies. Dur
ing the last three months their pay
consisted of three packages of cigar

SHIP TO THE SHORE
Tbe Admiral and \r\\s Son Surrendered to the
Little Gloucester After hjaving Gained
the Beach.
PORTSMOUTH, N. H., July 10.â Assisted by his son. Admiral Cer
vera swam ashore from his burning flagship, the Maria Teresa, and
was picked up by the United States torpedo boat Gloucester, Lieuten
ant Commander Richard Wainwrlght. Cervera and his son had on no
garments but their underclothes when taken on board the Gloucester.
The officers of the vessel fitted them out with wearing npparel. They
were then transferred to the battleship lowa, where they were re
ceived with all the consideration due to the gallant and vanquished
foe.
On the deck of the lowa Cervera met Eulate, commander of the
Viseaya. The meeting was an affecting one. Eulate, with much emo
tion, told his chief how Captain Evans had refused to take his sword,
paying that he had surrendered his ship to four vessels, not to the
lowa alone, and that therefore he would not receive the sword. Eu
late was much affected by the magnanimity of Evans and told Cervera
that It v. as the proudest moment of his life when the gallant American
commander allowed him to retain his treasured blade.
The Vizcaya survivors and wounded were helped on board the
lowa. Many of the men were fearfully mangled. Surgeon Rand Cran
dall of the lowa took charge of the maimed, dressed their wounds and
did all That was possible to alleviate the pain.
Admiral Cervera was greatly touched by the humanity and zeal
displayed by the young medical officer, and as a token of his apprecia
tion gave Dr. Crandall his autograph, saying simply that he had no
other souvenir to offer, he, too, having lost "all but honor."
The wounded who died after being taken on board were buried at
sea from the lowa, and with the honors of war. They were wrapped
In the flag for which they had fought so well, and by order of Cap
tain Evans three volleys were fired as the bodies went over the side.
GRAVE CHARGE
BY A PASTOR

Accused.
DEMAND FOR AN INQUIRY
DR. MCLAREN'S PLAIN TALK TO
HIS CONGREGATION.
Declares That the Reports of Im
morality in the High School
Must Be Investi
gated.
Epec'.al Dispatch to The Call.
PAX JOSE, July 10.â Rev. Dr. Mc-
Laren of the Second Presbyterian
Church, before a large congregation
this morning, took up the subject of
the recent difficulty in the liigh
school, and made plain charges of im
morality against the faculty of the
school in general. When he finished
the congregation applauded, a thing
npver. before known in his church. His
sermon was freely discussed about the
streets to-day. It probably will lead to
an investigation of the BchooL His
text was from Mark 8:SC: "What shall
it profit a man if he shall gain the
whole world and lose his own soul.
Said he:
Relief from a threatening condition in
this State can come only from a. quickened
conscience, a higher standard of citizen
ihip and freedom from corrupt politics.
Lest they should lie dormant in San Jose
any longer Let us speak out. loud and
fearlessly. Already the spell seems to be â ,
br< aklng. The mass meeting on Thurs- j
day night two weeks ago was one of
the most hopefully prophetic things that
has ever occurred in this city. The sus
! plclon that there was corruption and
I wrong in our school system brought to
! gether spontaneously a great and deter
mined crowd of our noblest and best citi- {
zÂ»ns and they will not rest or keep quiet !
until the whole matter has been made ,
right.
There are a number of excellent teach- j
erÂ« In our high school, but the only one
who has attained a reputation throughout
the State is Professor Smith. The su
preme success of a teacher lies not only
In his scholarship but in his personality.
Arnold of Rugby and Johns Hopkins'
Horace Mann attained their high posi
tions because of their power to awaken
pure thoughts and noble aspirations in
the minds of their pupils. Professor
Smith has manifested this power in a !
large degree, and many parents have sent
their children to our high school so that
they might be under his Influence. And
vet Professor Smith is discharged and
all the rest of the faculty is retained.
Now here we approach a most delicate
Bubject and one on which the conscience
of the people of San Jose is becoming
fearfully awake. It is useless to deny the
fact that there arc lnlluences associated
i with the high school that are not devel- I
I oping pure thoughts and conversation
; among the pupils. It is common fame all
over the city that in the high school there
are suggestions of evil that are fatal to
purity Of heart.
If there was a suspicion that certain
parties were conspiring to poison the res
ervoirs of the water supply of our city
there would be a tumult of excitement
and armed citizens would be on guard
and no one would drink the water while
the least suspicion as to Its character
remained.
Poison for the body is not as deadly a
thing as poison for the heart and soul and
I am sure that I speak the overwhelming
sentiment of our city when I demand that
the high school shall not be opened until
it has been thoroughly purified from
everything which the most searching in
vestigation shall reveal to be dangerous
to the hearts of our children.
What shall it profit to us if we have the

Professor Leigh R. Smith Elected
Principal of the High
School.
SAX JOSE, July 10.â Professor Leigh
R. Smith has been elected principal of the
Santa Clara High School. This is a slap
in the face to the Koa gang, and shows
that San Jose's largest suburb has thrown

POPULISTS AT SACRAMENTO.
The Battle Royal Begins To-Day.
Shanahan Out for the Nomination.
SACRAMENTO. July lv.â There is little
to indicate to-night that on Tuesday
morning the Populists will meet in what
promises to be the warmest State con
vention in the party's history.
The bay counties have contributed a
fair proportion of their delegates and
party leaders, while from the north a
number of third party statesmen, headed
by Code Commissioner T. W. 11. Bhana
han, have descended upon the Capitol
City, but the southern contingent, the
shouters for Magulre and fusion, are
holding off and will not get in until to
morrow.
The lobby of the Golden Eagle is de
serted, not a politician of any brand or
description is to be seen in or around the
Western, but at the State House the tall
sycamore of Shasta is holding forth to a
select group including It. H. Webster,
himself, toying with a buzzing guberna
torial bee. George W. Montelth, Carlton
Johnson and a fÂ«-w others. The talk to
night among the few who are here, is
"no fusion."
Shanuhan will not admit, nor will he
deny that he is a candidate, but his
friends are not so shy. Tint.' boldly de
clare that he is in the fight to stay and
with him it is no compromise.
There Is every indication that there will
be a hard ana stubborn fight when the
convention meets to-morrow in thu as
sembly chamber at the State CapitOl. The
result will entirely depend on the propo
sition of fusion with the Democrats.
Those who are in favor of fusion will pre
sent the name of Congressman James O.
Magul^-e for Governor, and tho.se opposeu
to it will place in nomination the "Tall
Sycamore of Shasta"â Shanahan. The
fusion contingent believes that Mnguire
has the Inside track in the Democratic
race, and that it would be advisable to
nominate him.
While Mayor Phelan Is taking a vaca
tion at Lake Tahoe, his friends are not
resting. They are working every wire
possible to secure for him the Democratic
nomination and are not overlooking the
Populist convention. In the absence of
t!ic Southern delegates, with the excep
tion of less than half a dozen from Fres
no, Maguire's friends are not on exhibi
tion and there Is no proselyting going on
in his behalf. To-morrow, however, will
bring large contingents from every sec
tion and the picket firing of to-night will
develop Into a battle royal.
So far there is little talk of candidates,
the main interest centering on the at
tempt of the Maguires to capture the con
vention.

SAX JOSE, July 10.â The Turners

SPLENDID WORK OF
BATTLESHIP OREGON
PORTSMOUTH, N. H.. July 10.â No complete account of the ex
act manner in which the ships of Cervera's fleet met disaster Is yet
possible, so inextricably intermingled are the many incidents of that
thrilling day, and not until all the official reports are in and data com
pared will it be possible to know even approximately what damage
individual American ships inflicted. After clearing the harbor at the
entrance each of the Spanish ships groped blindly to its destiny, each
having Its own adventures and each meeting and wrestling with its
fate.
There were no fleet signalsâ no signals of any sort. In fact, except
the warning numeral "200," which said, "Enemy coming out." There
was no "Remember the Maine" nor anything else of the sort. The foe
was sighted coming out of Santiago and the American ships went for
him the moment he was descried, the lowa, Oregon, Texas and Brook
lyn. The Indiana, far to the eastward and now of little speed, did all
that was possible for her to do, steaming toward the enemy as fast as
her slow speed would allow, opening with her powerful forward battery
Of two 13-inch and two 8-inch rifles as soon as she was in range,
and then taking a position at the entrance of Santiago harbor to cut
off the retreat of Cervera in case he atempted to run back to port. The
battle-ships lowa and Texas did splendid work.
These vessels had reputations to maintain, and they did it, but the
superb Oregon outdid herself. Great things were expected of that un
matched marvel of Pacific Coast shipbuilders. Until this encounter off
Santiago no one ever dreamed that the heavily armored coast defense
battle-ship could outstrip the fast armored cruiser credited with a
speed of twenty-one knots an hour. But that is what the Oregon did.
The lowa, a sea-going battleship and the newest of her type under the
American flag, boasts something in the way of speed as well as in
battery power, but the Oregon in har dash for the enemy went by the
lowa as though she were at anchor, and yet the lowa was steaming at
a rate of speed that washed the cellulose from two shell holes in her
starboard bow.
NUEVITAS NEXT
TO BE INVESTED
i Some Rich Prizes May Be Found
Among Vessels in Santiago
Harbor.

dun Hennett.
GENERAL SHAFTER'S HEAD
QUARTERS BEFORE SANTIAGO,
July 9 (by the Call-Herald dispatch
boat Golden Rod to Port Antonio,
Jamaica, July 10.)â As soon as the
Americans have taken .Santiago, I am
told by a prominent Cuban officer, It is
tUe intention to invest Nuevitas, the
1 principal port of the province of Porto
Principe.
The move Is regarded as being highly
important, inasmuch as the Spaniards,
after Nuevitas has been taken from
i them, will have been shorn of authority
in all parts of Cuba east of the province
of Matanzas.
Nuevitas is a small place, easy of
capture, and offers fewer obstacles
than does Santiago. Cuban leaders as-
I sert that with this port in our po.sses
! Pion Spanish power will be broken
i throughout central and eastern Cuba.
Positive statements are now made
that General Pando abandoned his at
tempt to get into Santiago with his
i troops, and that he halted his men at
! a point twenty miles from Santiago.
' Pando was unwilling to try to force his
way through the mountals largely be
cause of the fact that even if he had
succeeded in getting into Santiago he
! could do nothing but share with Gen
; eral Linares the responsibility for the
' fall of the city.
When Admiral Sampson s fleet
i steams into Santiago harbor the Amer-
I leans will find several good prizes
1 among the vessels now lying in the
, inner harbor. Lieutenant "Joe" Wheel
â â  er and Lieutenant Steele of General
i Wheeler's staff yesterday climbed the
high hills and from a position within
the Cuban lines obtained an excellent
; view of the inner harbor. They saw
I a beautiful white steeamship moving
i rapidly about, apparently under full
steam. They also saw a black ship re
i sembling an ocean liner, in addition to
several small schooners. Wheeler and
Steele noticed a peculiar low vessel,
which is thought to be a torpedo boat,
I with several smaller craft huddled
j about.
From a French refugee I learn that
i the Spaniards have begun looting the
i city. He said that Spanish officers had
! permitted soldiers to break into the
1 houses vacated by the refugees on pre
tense of searching for food, hut in
I reality to smaph everything not of use
to them and to take whatever of value
! was found.
THIRTY THOUSAND MEN
TO INVADE PORTO RICO
Army in Charge of General Wade
Will Embark in About Ten
Days.
NEW YORK. July 10.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Although it
Is confidently exported by officials of the
Administration that there will now be no
delay in the surrender of the city of San
tiago, it probably will be at least ten days
before the Porto Rico army will hav"ebeeu
embarked. The ships at Santiago will be
I pufiicient to convey the detachment from
! that place to Porto Rico, but as yet the
I Government has had poor success Inchar
' terlng or buying vessels on the Atlantic
Coast. If, however, it Is found impossible
' to obtain vessels from the various steam
ship companies on the Atlantic Coast it
is the plan of the Government to use Koine.
df the naval vessels for the purpose of
taking the army from the I'nlted States.
It is now understood that Major CJen
â  era] Wade will be sent in command of the
. Porto Rican army. General Miles will, as
planned, be the commander. I was told
to-day by an officer hlgrh In authority th;it
General Miles' army would havo about
thirty thousand men.

HOWELL PREPARING TO
BOMBARD HAVANA
Said to Have Notified Blanco to Haul
Down His Flag Within Four
Days.
NEW YORK, July 10.â A Journal
Washington special says: The report
that Commodore Howell has notified
Blanco that If within four days he does
not haul down the Spanish flag and
prepare to evacuate Havana, the
harbor defenses will be bombarded,
was neither affirmed nor denied at the
Navy Department to-night. It may be
assumed, however, that Commodore
Howell delivered that or a similar mes
sage to Blanco.
Commodore Howell has In his block

jury to them, presenting as they do
only curved surfaces slightly above the
water line.
If Santiago is disposed of within the
next forty-eight hours Sampson could
send a large part of his fleet as a rein

fectively.
ATTEMPT TO WRECK
AND ROB A TAIN
LOS ANGELES, July 10.â An at
tempt was made this morning to wreck
the train from San Diego to this city
on the Santa Fe line, near Enclnitas.
The Los Angeles Times' flyer, which
carries the paper to San Diego, encoun
tered an obstruction, built of ties,
across the track. The flyer was on a
steep up-grade, and was able to stop in
time to escape striking the obstruction.
The northbound train was due at the
place a few minutes later, and would
have been on the down-grade, and a
serious accident could not have been
prevented. It is supposed that ama
teurs made an attempt to wreck and
rob the train.

CONDITION OF BUSINESS.
I~^HE semi-annual trade reports just made up
show results rather above even the sanguine ex
pectations of those optimistic operators who last
winter predicted a phenomenal spring trade. If any
thing is calculated to depress a country's trade it is a
foreign war, and yet, in spite of the war, business
during the past six months has been better on the
whole than ever before. The failures, as before re
marked, have shown a marked decrease, and the
bank clearings have uniformly exhibited a pro
nounced gain over the same period in 1897. We be
gin the second half of the year with a war tax which
will largely increase the revenue without seriously
inconveniencing any line of trade. For the first week
of the new half year the bank clearings of the country
show a gain of 14.8 per cent as comparedr with the
same week last year, and from present indications the j
usual midsummer lull will be shorter and less pro- j
nounced than usual owing to the continuous demand j
for goods all over the country. Signs are also mul
tiplying that the fall trade, which will soon open, will
not fall behind the remarkable movement of last 'â¢
spring.
A survey of the general field of business reveals no
features out of the ordinary. It is seldom that pro
nounced features are visible in midsummer, when the
business men of the country, from the New York
financier down to the commonplace tradesman, are
taking their annual respite. Speculative operations
in the different stock and product exchanges are
being materially diminished by the new stamp tax,
which acts as a severe check upon all exchange of
shares not strictly legitimate. Brokers are careful
about their transactions, when each one requires a '
stamp, and wash sales have, therefore, gone out of
fashion all over the country. This in itself is not at
all a bad thing. The great staples show normal ac- j
tivity for the season on the whole, and there are in- |
dications of increasing animation in the iron trade, j
which has been active all the year. Pigiron is in es- j
pecially improved demand, and agricultural imple- i
ments are bring called for in the West and North- ]
west as fast as the factories can turn them out. Evi
dently the farmers are doing a land office business this
year. These two sections also continue to lead the
rest of the country in distributive trade, though the
East and South both report a better movement in
this line. Wool rules quiet, though a better inquiry
has developed during the past ten days, because the
Western holders ask prices which the Eastern manu
facturers cannot afford to pay. The cotton crop is
looking better and the South is rapidly increasing its
manufacture, while the Northern mills are more ac
tively employed than usual at this time of the year.
As for our cereal exports, they are far ahead of the
normal and could not well be better. The business
failures last week, however, exhibited an increase
over the corresponding week in 1897.
Locally there is little new. Like the greater part of
the country, California is vegetating through the
summer. Harvesting is in full blast, and the farmer
is getting good returns for almost everything he
raises. Nothing has declined in value during the past
week, and the general tendency in all products is
toward still better prices. All products are just about
short enough to create fine quotations without pinch
ing the State. There is no over-production in any
thing this year, nor is there a famine in any article
of produce. The light production of 1898 will result
in at least another good year in 1899, and we will
probably go into the twentieth century with flying
colors, because everything we raise this year will
doubtless be all cleaned up when the 1899 crops come
in, and they will thus find a clear field. So the great
dry year of 1898 is quite likely to prove a blessing
after all. At any rate, the agricultural depression
which prevailed from 1893 to 1896, both years in
clusive, has passed out of sight, and the farmer is
doing first-rate once more. The merchant comes in
for his share of this prosperity as a natural conse
quence, so everything is cheerful again.
Germany seems to thinki that this country is under
great obligations to her. It must be admitted that
Germany has contributed to this country many good
citizens, but this was not because she wanted ' to.
It was because she couldn't help it. Instead of howl
ing about the obligations of friendship we owe Ger
many the beery editors over there ought to make
out a list of them.

WILL OURNATIONAL POLICY CHANGE ?
PUBLIC opinion in this country is directed, in
a marked manner, to events that will follow the
close of our war with Spain.
At present the only easy place in the outcome seems
to be Porto Rico, where there was little discontent
with Spanish rule and where the people seem to pre
fer some government to none, and have not given
their interests and aspirations into the keeping of any
grandiloquent "general" or word-mongering Junta.
Being inclined to look with favor upon government,
they also seem discriminating enough to prefer the
best they can get, which is a distinct advance upon
the practice of their congeners in some other parts of
Latin America. Turning away from Porto Rico we
confront difficulties which promise to transcend any
that arise from the Spanish situation direct.
The future of Cuba and the Philippines presents
the problem toward which American thought is run
ning. It is not probable that we are to witness a sud
den change in policy that will so acutely wrench our
institutions as to mar them like the work of a con
vulsion. The assumption of distant jurisdiction, and
the appearance of a nation as a power in all zones,
is not usually. a sudden matter, not in the air yester
day, but to-day accomplished. Even when such policy
conforms to the genius and meets the necessities of
a country, it does not fall from the skies like the
meteors of November, but begins in a cloud less than
a man's hand. England acquired the greatest of her
external possessions, India, slowly and by indirection.
It was a far cry from the first factory of the East
India Company, on a fever smitten coast, to Plassy
and the final ruin of the Mogul Empire. English
men first appeared in the Hindostan peninsula as
traders, and commerce went before conquest. The
method of English administration in India was of
slow growth. Its germs were in the experiences of
the East India Company, and its expansion and ap
plication have been wrought out by some of the best
intellects in Great Britain.
As American ambition toward an imperial colonial
policy has first to settle with Spain, and then with
various and very incipient Caesars, in Cuba and the
Philippines, there is likely to be ample time for the
sober second thought of our people to weigh and
measure an acute departure in the second century of
our existence from the pledges and policies of the
first.
There is in process of manufacture a public senti
ment against giving up any territory which we take
by conquest, and to propose it may soon come to be
denounced as unpatriotic. In order to ease the situ
ation and purge it of that element, let it be understood
that if it be good policy to wage the war to a close
for the purpose that was declared at Its opening,
when the President said to the world, "This is not a
war of conquest," it will be quite as patriotic to ab
stain from imperialism as to enter upon it.
It is a mistake to suppose that patriotism is pos
sible" in war only. It is more necessary in peace than
in war. It is needed to keep virgin the national
honor and preserve it unstained by bad faith and
hypocrisy.
The patriotism of war will fill the ranks, fight the
battles and cherish the weak and wounded, preserving
the memory of the fallen in unfailing honor. The
patriotism of peace will settle the results of the war
and determine the further duty of the republic;
whether it be to remain the master of the world by
striking in far lands and seas for rights of man, and
giving all nations notice that those baptized into lib
erty by the chrism of American blood must hence
forth be respected, for we will smite off the hand
that touches tSem; or whether it be to stay in the
arena of contention by taking Spanish government
and self-government both from the people we have
rescued, to hold them, not as fellow citizens, but as
subordinate colonists, the decision will not be sud
den, but the distant hour of judgment will find us
with judgment matured.
THE POPULIST CONVENTION.
STATE politics, which have long been simmer
ing, will begin to bubble and boil over in sight
of the people at Sacramento to-morrow. The
Populist convention, which is to assemble in that
city, will take the lid off the pot, as it were, and give
the general public an opportunity to see what t in
gredients of fusion and confusion have been thrown
into the mixture, and which is going to dominate the
whole when the boiling is done and the scum has
been skimmed off.
It is already evident that the stalwart Populists are
not going to be permitted to manage their household
in their own way. They will have advisers, coaxers,
interferers, kickers and bulldozers around them from
start to finish. It will be, in fact, a Populist conven
tion in name only. There will be at the gathering
representatives of all the factions in the Democratic
camp, all sorts of silverites and Bryanites, and of
every other sort of discontented clique or gang of
office-seekers in the State, and their part in the pro
ceedings will be hardly less important than that of
the Populists themselves.
It is recorded in the Book of Samuel that when
David established his camp at the cave of Adullam
"every one that was in distress and every one that was
in debt and every one that was discontented gath
ered themselves unto him." It is this kind of a crowd
that is going to assemble to hamper and perplex the
earnest Populists at Sacramento. The Adullamites
with their political distresses, debts and discontents,
will block the highways and make the middle-of-the
road reformers take to the woods with silver Repub
licans and out-of-office Democrats if they can. It is
going to be a struggle between the sincere men of
principle and the hungry men of greed, and the con
test will be worth the close and careful study of all
citizens.
If the honest and earnest Populists had a fair field
it is probable they would overcome their opponents
and save their party from being subordinated to the
Bryanite factions that are seeking to make use of it.
It is certain, however, that they are not to have fair
play. The so-called silver Republicans and several
varieties of Democrats have already stolen a march
upon them, and when the convention assembles
there will be found among the delegates themselves
a considerable number who are far more devoted to
Bryanism or to Maguireism than to Populism.
Thus, with swarming wire-pullers on the outside
and traitors in the convention itself, the true Popu
lists will have need of all their strength and all their
sagacity to save their principles from being trampled
under foot and their party from destruction. It is that
fact which gives more than ordinary interest to the
convention. The existence of Populism in California
is at stake on the issue. It is to be a battle for life.
The party was sorely shattered by the fusion of 1896,
and if it surrenders once more it will as an organiza
tion disappear from our politics forever.
It might be welLto stop guessing at the existence of
ill will between Sampson and Schley, at least until
there had been some remote indication of this feel
ing.
The outcry against Camp Mcrritt is getting a little

THE SAN FIiANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JULY 11, 1898.
A MONUMENT TO JOBBERY.
TO-DAY the ferry depot is to be given over to
the public. The great building, impressive to
the eye, but from ground to tower-tip a sham,
is almost out of the hands of the jobbers. It is a
monument to the work of these jobbers. Over the
main entrance to the city has been reared a deception
in stone, a pretense in wood, the mutilated sugges
tion of that which the architect planned and for
which the people pay.
The shameful story has been told again and again,
and while the truth has caused indignation, it has
not brought any one to the felon's dock, herein fall
ing short of the purpose of its telling. The men who
had charge of the erection of the building have
seemed to try to devise methods by which to squander
the funds provided and cheat the community which
had trusted them. The sum of $600^000 had been
voted for the structure. After all the contracts had
been let there remained of this at least $35,000, ample
margin, it would appear, for all emergency.
Straightway began a series of changes. Cheaper
stone was used than the contract called for, pine was
substituted for oak, terra cotta tiling was abolished,
wooden shutters took the place of steel, plumbing
specifications were ignored, common brick worth
$14 laid in the wall supplanted that for which the con
tractor would have had to pay $125. Numerous par
titions were eliminated. The list is too long to set
forth in detail. Enough to say the changes, all bad,
extended to every department of the work, that con
tractors were permitted to do as they pleased, and
actually received extra pay for changes for which they
could have afforded to pay the State a handsome
bonus. The details may all be found in the files of
this paper, and in the records of the Grand Jury.
It might have been supposed that allowing con
tractors to use cheap material where good material
fiad been called for in the specifications, by the terms
of which they were legally and morally bound, would
have resulted in a saving to the State. Quite the
contrary. With all the shoddy substitution the money
has been used to the last cent, and it was found ne
cessary to actually leave one story unfinished for
lack of cash. Who got this money? Why was it ex
pended? .By what right did Colnon and Swain waste
State funds? Why should they escape punishment?
These are some of the questions naturally arising as
the gigantic swindle they engineered to a botched
completion is turned over to the use of a common
wealth which has been betrayed by its paid servants.
Californians are liberal. They take pride in an,y
material improvement. It is not their way to enjoy
being the victims of a confidence game. They agreed
to pay for a first-class depot, and expected to get it.
They did their share; they paid. They did not get
the depot. In its place they receive an inferior build
ing, walled, plastered, honeycombed and topped with
glaring fraud.
OUR UNTHANKED SEAMEN.
ACTING in accordance with a precedent hon
orable in itself and illustrious by its record
in our history, the / United States Senate
shortly after the noble feat of Hobson and his brave
crew of the Merrimac, adopted a resolution con
ferring upon them the thanks of the nation. The
resolution, following the form usual in such acts of
recognition to our heroes in war, purported to be
the thanks of Congress, and therefore required adop
tion by the House of Representatives. It is a matter
of amazement and indignation that the House ad
journed without acting upon the resolution, leaving
the valor of the heroic deed unrecognized and the
heroes unthanked.
The story comes from Washington that when an
attempt was made to have the Senate resolution re
ported to the House for action it was defeated, largely
through the influence of Dalzell of Pennsylvania, who
went about and warned the members that if the reso
lution were passed it would confer upon the seven
seamen who shared Hobson's heroic deed the privi
lege of the floor of the House for life. On that ar
gument the resolution was set aside. A majority of
the House concluded that it would be better to leave
the brave men without recognition than to give them
such thanks as, in accordance with precedent, would
entitle the seamen to enter the august chamber where
Congressmen hold their deliberations.
It is difficult to believe that a motive so slight as
the one given could have moved any considerable
number of intelligent American Representatives to
refuse to Hobson and his companions a recognition
which by long usage has become an established for,m
of rewarding patriotic services in this country. There
is nothing in the person of a brave seaman such as
those who sunk the Merrimac under Spanish forts
that would contaminate the average Congressman,
nothing that would pollute a hall habitually used by
such men as those who have refused the recognition.
Moreover, the seven men will be most of their lives
at sea. They are not to be hanging around the Cap
itol. It is doubtful if any of them would ever make
the use of the "privilege of the floor" more than
once and then only to enjoy the honor conferred on
him by the country which he loves and in whose
cause he had distinguished himself in a host of brave
men.
The whole thing seems to have been another illus
tration of that extraordinary social influence exerted
in Washington against every attempt at the advance
ment or promotion of seamen in the navy. It is a
strange fact that an enlisted man or a young appren
tice seaman has a better chance for preferment and
honor in the aristocratic navy of monarchical Eng
land than in our own. The whole of our system of
officering the navy seems in need of reconstruction
from top to bottom, and the accomplishment of that
reform at this time would be a good way of giving
thanks to Hobson and his men without in any way
exposing Congressmen to the danger of having to
admit a seaman to the floor of the House.
General Miles seems inclined to think that all the
land fighting thus far has been done by the regular
army. Friends of the dead volunteers, of course,
make a merely civilian estimate, but they are not
ready to accept this view.
Belief is expressed in some quarters that the Span
ish will not get back any of their islands) and that
they will be required to pay indemnity besides. But
what with? They couldn't so much as find an
indorser for their note.
One writer remarks that Spain and the United
States are separated by an unfathomable gap. He
might have called attention to the danger that Spain
may fall into the gap.
Â«
A Spaniard at Salinas, maddened by the news of
the defeat at Santiago, ran amuck, and had to be
violently restrained. He deserves a place in the
Madrid Ministry.
Cubans, it is said, must prove their fitness before
they will be permitted to govern themselves. Strictly
adhered to, this will defer their independence about
ioo years.
There is no doubt that the Spanish admiral who still
has a ship will use every effort to be a Camara ob
, scurer than Watson will permit him to be.

RICH QUARTZ
BROUGHT FROM
A GOLDEN ISLE
The Prospectors Prefer It to the
Diggings in the Neighbor
hood of Dawson.
"The Island of Gold" has been discov
ered and the bonanza which H. Talbot
Watson and his confreres came all the
way from England to pre-empt has been
taken by other parties. From all accounts,
however, the new El Dorado is anything
but a second Klondike, Yesterday the
schooner Altair arrived from Karluk and
in her hold there are sixteen sacks of ore
which are said to be fair samples of the
ledge locnted for Messrs. Hotaling, Gor
den and Garratt. Dan Dougherty, an old
miner who came down from Karluk
with the gold hunters, does not think very
much of the find, however, and says there
are lots of better locations on "The Island
of Gold."
A couple of years ago L. Gilbert was
mate of tho American ship St. Nicholas
and went with his vessel to the canneries
on Kodiak Island, "The Island of Gold."
While out hunting he ran across some
quartz ledges and secured a number of
samples. These specimens he brought
back to San Francisco with him and gave
them to Mr. Garratt, who had them as
sayed. The assay showed that the stuff
was worth from $2.'0 to $500 a ton.
In the meantime Gilbert had become ac
quainted with the captain and told that
gentleman all about his discovery and
pricked off its exact location on the chart.
With a few of the specimens Moore went
to England and there interested H. Talbot
Watson and others. When Watson and
his experts reached San Francisco they
handed over $10,000 to Moore, with which
he purchased and outfitted the schooner
Free Trade. The story of that vessel and
her visit to Kodiak Island, where Watson
and his party were put ashore, has al
ready been told.
Before the Free Trade got away from
here, however, Moore and Gilbert,
the latter of whom was going as
first mate on the Free Trade,
had a falling out and Gilbert left
the vessel. He at once interested A. P.
Hotaling and Messrs. Gordon and Garratt,
with the result that the schooner Altair
was fittpd out in a hurry and sent post
haste after the Free Trade. Both vessels
met in Uyak Bay. It was there that
trouble broke out on the Free Trade, and

O The following

o boom and thunder
of the glorious
Â° Fourth. It is told
o IT WAS THE
o END
Â° OF THE END.
O Oby Cora Tinnle,
0000000000 the vivacious sou
brette of the Frawley company, and as
she furnishes the element of the ludicrous
in the narrative, there is a stamp of ver
acity attached to it. Miss Tlnnie, with a
few friends, was at the Chutes on the
night of the Fourth. Ardent patriotism
and a youthful passion for fireworks
were two of the chief reasons for her
presence there. A thick and penetrating
fog could not chill the desire to see the
pyrotechnic display, and despite the con
stant solicitations of her friends to
leave the place she remained until the
last piece had been firedâ and even
longer. The grounds were being cleared
by the outpouring of humanity, but Miss
Tinnle would not budge, for she spied a
spark on one of the large figures and she
waited for it to ignite. Around her gath
ered the rf-st of the party and they also
waited. There they stood in the refrig
erated fog, expectant and watchful. The
spark glowed, but it would not communi
cate to the rest of the skeleton. Remarks
were passed by Miss Tinnie indicative of
impatience, and some of the bystanders
overheard them. One, a habitual at
tendant of pyrotechnic performances,
broke out in a laugh of derision. Miss
Tinnie looked annoyed, but before she had
time to remonstrate the scoffer jumped
over the railing separating the crowd
from the consumed figures, and with a
pull at the one Miss Tinnle was so pa
tiently watching brought it to the ground
in a thousand pieces. It had been set-off
an hour before. The spark Miss Tinnle
saw was the end of the end.

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
The Spitfire, British torpedo-boat de
stroyer, collided last month with a coal
hulk, disabling the boat's steering gear
and doing some damage to her hull plat
ing.
Russia Intends to hereafter maintain a
naval force of some importance in Chi
nese waters, and two cruisers are to be
permanently stationed at Vladivostock
and Port Arthur.
The battle-ship Illustrious passed
through her commission trial at sea June
22, making 15.9 knots with 10,016 horse
power under natural draught. The ship
was down to a draught of 27 feet 6 inches
forward and 28 feet 6 inches aft, displac
ing about 15,200 tons, or 300 tons over her
normal displacement.
A coffer-dam one and a half miles in
length is being built in the mud to keep
out the water of the Hamoaze from the
site of the new docks in the course of
construction at Keyham, England. The
first section was put down and closed in
less than six months, and one and a half
Moore would have got the worst of it had
not Gilbert gone to his assistance.
This part of tho story is denied by Cap
tain Gilbert and Mate Hanson of the Al
tair. One thing is certain, however. The
Free Trade sailed away and the Altair re
mained behind to allow Gilbert to relocate
his gold mines. An old miner called "Jim
my" helped the skipper in his search, and
the sixteen sacks of ore in the hold of the
Altair are the result of his labors. "Jim
my" was sent North by Mr. Hotaling.
While in Uyak Bay Mate Holmes near
ly lost the number of his mess. He went
out hunting and ran across a big bear.
He wounded the animal and it showed
fight. It played hide and seek around a
big boulder wl the mate for nearly half
an hour, until, just as Holmes was ready
to drop from exhaustion, he got a chance
and put a bullet into bruin in a vital part
and the battle was over. Mate Holmes
brought the skin down with him and is
very proud of his trophy.
Dan Dougherty, who came down from
"The Island of Gold" on the Altair, has
been away from civilization for ten years.
Onco every six months he has been in the
habit of going to Karluk for letters and
supplies, and he would not now be in San
Francisco were it not for the fact that he
requires machinery to work his mine. His
place is forty miles from Karluk, and he
says it is quite enough of a Klondike for
him. He brought down with him three
packages on which he declined to place
any value. They must be worth consider
able, however, judging by the self-satis
fied smile that sprea^. over his face when
the valley of the Yukon was mentioned.
â  Gold-bearing quartz can be found crop
ping out all over the island," said he yes
terday, "but the question is, will it pay to
work? These Altair people have simply
located a ledge, the same as dozens of
other people have done, but it remains to
be seen what their specimens will say.
I'm perfectly satisfied with my location,
and I'm going back there as soon as I
transact some business here."
Soon after the anchor was dropped the
crew of the Altair went ashore. One
sailor was left aboard, but he was so
helplessly drunk that neither kicks ncr
cuffs would wake him. The only thing on
watch was a little black pup, and it
barked at every passing vessel until it gut
tired and went to sleep beside the drunk
en sailor.
million cubic feet of timber was used in
its construction.
The Queen's yacht, Victoria and Albert,
had a narrow escape from destruction by
fire June 18. The fire started in a char
coal burner in the forecastle and the
flames shot up to a great height. The
crew, however, promptly responded to
the alarm and only slight damage was
clone to the venerable wooden hull.
The strike of the coal miners in South
Wales has been the means of putting off
the British naval maneuvers. It is not
for the want of coal in the dockyards, fop
there is a more than usual heavy stock
on hand, and it was broadly intimated in
Parliament to the First Lord of the Ad
miralty that his course was prompted by
a desire to take sides with the mine
owners against the strikers.
The Atlas and Cyclops Works at Shef
field have made great improvements in
their armor-making plants. The latter
has two hyrdaulic presses of 4000 and
10,000 tons capacity, and armor over six
inches in thickness is not rolled but is
placed under the hydraulic press. The
Atlas Works has two overhead travel
ing cranes of 100 and 150 tons capacity
and a hydraulic press of 6000 tons.

with small tubes are washed with weaker
solutions, after which the tubes are filled
with fresh water. Next a smoky fire is
built in the furnaces with coal tar, tho
smoke from which forms a coating on the
tubes. A quantity of quicklime Is then
placed in the boiler, the casing closed and
kept airtight, and finally the outside is
painted with red lead or coal tar.
Triple screws and water tubes are being
introduced in several of the ships build
ing for the German navy. Two battle
ships to replace the Friederlch der Grosse
and Preussen will have triple screws, and
one first-class cruiser of 6300 tons and
four second-class cruisers of only 5650
tons, named Freya, Hertha, Victoria
Luise and Vioreta will be similarly fitted.
Three types of water-tube boilersâ the
Niclausse, Belleville and Durrâ are being
experimented with, and one-third of the
steam generating power in the new ships
is supplied by either of these boilers and
two-thirds is still retained by the ordi
nary box boilers. In the navy of Holland
the practice is to use equal parts of each
type, while in the British and French
navies the water-tube boilers are sup
planting the Scotch boilers entirely.
Lord Brassey professes surprise at the
apparent soperiority of recent ships built
at Elswick for foreign governments as
compared with ships of the same class
and displacement in the British navy.
The Japanese cruiser Tagasako of 4300
tons is compared with the Astrea class
of British cruisers of 4360 tons, and the
comparison is in favor of the Japanese.
The latter mounts two 8-inch quick-firers,
ten 4.7-inch, eight 12-pounders and six
lVfe-pounders, carries SOO tons of coal and
has a speed of 24 knots. The Astrea has
a battery of two 6-inch quick-firers, eight
4.7-inch, eight 6-pounders and one 3
pounder, carries only 400 tons of coal and
her maximum speed is only 19.5 knots.
The apparent vast superiority of the for
eign ships is probably not quite so great
actually, and it is possible that the Brit
ish ship carries a greater quantity of am
munition. The disparity, however, is un
doubtedly considerably in favor of the
Elswick-built ship, and the solution lies
probably in the fact that the designer in
the Armstrong yard is not hampered by
the interference which exists in all
navies, and prevents the director from
properly exericising his functions of
naval construction in the British navy.

IT was a very quiet Sunday at the
headquarters of Major General Otis,
who up to a late hour last night
was expecting dispatches from
Washington in regard to the Hono
lulu annexation programme, and the
sailing of the troop transports now
ready for their departure for Manila,
but no telegrams came. The situation
therefore is unchanged from what is
was on Saturday, and General Otis is
yet uncertain as to the date of his sail
ing, but he will in all probability get
away some day this week.
Admiral Miller has received no fur

and is in condition to start for Hono

A CHANGE OF PLANS.
Four Hundred Soldiers Were
to Have Gone to Honolulu
on the Alameda.
The only busy spot on the water front
yesterday was Pacific street wharf. |
Down at Folsom street there was a little j
Bport early in the morning owing to the
departure of the steamer Columbia for
Oregon, but at Pacific street the rush was '
kept up all day. It was originally intend
ed to send 4i'O troops to Honolulu on the
steamer Alameda, but last Saturday night !
the order was countermanded, and, of |
course, that left a lot of space on the j
mail steamer. Accordingly, notices were
Bent out to shippers, and all of yesterday
the freight kept rushing down to the |
wharf. Had the soldiers been scheduled
to go away on the Alameda next WVJnta- i
day the chances are that the Bennington
wuuld have sailed to-day. Under easy
Eir-am she would have reached Honolulu
in about the same time, as the mail
â¢ r and then everything would have
been ready for the raiding of Old Glory
over the islands. As things look now it
would seem as though the ceremony will
wait until the transports Peru and Pueblo
get there.
The Bennington lay at anchor all day j
with steam up, and is ready to start at ai
moment's notice. No one stems to know,
however, in which direction she will go.!
The general Impression on board is that
Bl c will go north on a cruise, while some |
crew are hoping against hope that
she will be sÂ«Â»nt to Manila.
The work of loading the City of Pueblo j
and Peru was kept up all day while the '
alterations to the ship Taeoma will begin
to-day. The latter will carry 250 horses !
on her main and 'tween decks. The third j
deck and lower hold will be used for
-â  and supplies. From here the Ta
eoma will go to Honolulu and there the j
cattle will \>p unloaded and given a few !
days' rest. They will then be put aboard ;

died away rapidly, however, as Rosette
was seen to draw level with her fawn

across the field.
Flying Buck turned her toward the

dotfs crossed and recrossed, being hidden
at times from the spectators in clouds of

THE EIGHTH CALIFORNIA.
Adjutant General Corbin Has
Been Informed That the
Regiment Is Ready
for Assignment.
CAMP BARRETT, Fruitville, July 10.-
Colonel Henshaw received all of the mus- |
ter rolls of his command to-day and wired j
Adjutant General Corbin that he was
ready to be assigned. No ordei had
reached him late to-night designating the
department to which he should report, but
it is expected early Monday morning. An
inspection of arms was held this morn
ing, at which time it was learned that a
greater portion of the men would have to
have new rifles. The ones now in use are
serviceable Tor drill and ta.rget practice,
but a large portion of them have the rifle
worn, the sights injured and the chambers
sprung, which will necessitate their going
into the Government works for repair. A
requisition will be made for enough good !
guns from Benicia to replace these.
Adjutant General Barrett and Colonel
Burgin of Governor Budd's staff, visited
camp to-day in civilian garb.
The officers showed them around and
listened to their expressions of approval i
of the camp. Lieutenant Adel was Intro- j
duced by General Barrett as the "father
of Company M." He said Governor Budd i
was particularly well pleased with Lieu- j
tenant Ariel's work in raising a company
in a night to replace the Woodland com
pany. Lieutenant Add, formerly quar
termaster for the Fifth Regiment, N. G. |
C, on Colonel Fairbanks staff, was to- j
day detailed as regimental commissary,
and Viu issue rations to-morrow morning
for five days, which means over 2900
meals. The* lieutenant regrets very much !
that he cannot remain with his command
to drill the raw recruits. Lieutenant E. S.
Heller, Quartermaster of the regiment,
has also been detailed ordnance officer,
and will see that the necessary arms are i
secured. Sergeant Marders of Company
D, Private Abbott of Company G and Pri
vate Kennedy of Company C have been
detailed for service in the commissary de
partment, and to-morrow will be located
in the tent to be erected next to head
quarters.
Lieutenant Colonel Carrington, in com
mand of the camp to-day, issued or- |
ders permitting non-commissioned officers
to form squads and take them to church .
down town. During the afternoon ser
vices were held on the ground by Rev. E.
T. Butler of the First ChriÃtlan church,
Oakland. A great deal of enthusiasm was
aroufeed by an address by a major of tho
Montana regiment now at Camp Mc-rritt.
Colonel Carrington stated that the line
would be drawn closer upon visitors to
morrow, as they are seriously interfering
with the soldiers' duties. To-day every
one who had friends in the camp was ad
mitted.
Private J. J. Eck^rs of Colupr died at
the County Infirmary this forenoon of i

SURPRISES AT INGLESIDE.
Malmo Downed by Eclipse and
Leonora Defeats Hadiwist.
Shortenders' Killings.
Coursing, like marriage, is "mighty un
unsartln." This was proven yesterday at
Ingleside before one of the largest crowds
that has attended the park this season.
When such star performbers as Mialmo
and Hadiwist are shut out by less speedy
dogs the talent Is given food for re
flection. The latter class of bettors, after
having things practically their own way
during the morning's running, were dealt
some severe setbacks as the afternoon
wore on. Shortenders struck a streak of
luck and nearly a half dozen times cashed
their tickets at odds ranging from 5 to
2V4 to 1. and their jubilant shouts could
be heard every time their choices landed.
The first surprise the talent received
occurred in the first round. Hobson went
out and defeated the sure winner High
Born Lady, and their purses were sadly
depleted. .They, however, recuperated on
the courses that followed until near the
close of the stake, when fortune smiled
the other way.
Lass o' Gowrie defeated Old Glory in
one of the prettiest and grittiest courses
of the day. Old Glory led up to the turn
and then let drive for tho hare. He
missed it, and the impetus was so great
that he fell. He grittily followed In the
wake of the chase, but the Lass had
scored enough points to win at odds of
3 to 1.
Eclipse was in splendid form and de
feated Statesman, Fairview, the Belle of
Moscow and' the mighty Mialmo, winner
of the Merced stake. Odds of 3 to 1 were
offered against him in the latter course
and his victory proved a sensation.
Clifton Lass, however, defeated him in
the final. Eclipse was made a favorite at
odds of 4 to 1. and his defeat brought
more happiness to the shortenders.
Leonora In the all-aged stake proved the
surprise. She downed Hadiwist. Lass o'
Gowrie and ran a bye with Myrtle for the
final. On their meeting the latter dog
only won out by a narrow margin. ,-.

member of the National Guard and had
passed the examination to enter the vol
unteer service when taken sick, but was
never mustered in. His two sisters and
brother were at his bedside when death
relieved his suffering. His remains were
embalmed and will be forwarded to Max
well, where they will be buried to-mor
row. He was 25 years and 11 months of
age and a native of this State.
Daisy Warner, a 15-year-old girl, who
ran away from her homo in East
Oakland, where she was placed by
the Beulah Home, was seen in camp this
afternoon and pointed out to Captain
Carson of the Police Department. When
she went into the city she was taken into
custody and held, and will be given to the
Beulah Home people to-morrow. She
claims to be working in a family at Four

Only one patient was in the hospital tent
to-day. The boys are having considerable

THE ENDEAVORERS.
Good Work Done and Excel
lent Results Obtained by
Them.
The work of the Endeavorers has been
growing so much within the past few
weeks at Camp Merritt that It has been
found necessary to double the force of
workers.
The medical department received a lib
eral supply of several kinds of medicine
; from J. R. Gates & Co. on Saturday last
and is supplying scores of sick soldiers with
' the needful remedies. By request flowers
I are being sent in from the country to
i many of the Endeavorers, who in turn
i bring them out to the camp each morn
ing, and they are then taken by the mem-
I bers of the hospital department to the
; hospitals; the reading and writing tents
I are also supplied.
Milk is left at the headquarters each
day and is distributed among the sick.
j Soups are made daily and delicacies of
many kinds are sent in. Mrs. C. S. Wright,
as chairman of the Mothers' Christian
Endeavorer Clubs, and Miss M. L. Berry
j have superintended their work.
Mrs. Emily Fuwden, with her efficient
corps of workers, is in charge of the sev
eral tents at the camp. Each tent is sup
plied with stationery, reading matter, etc.,
and has in attendance during the day
young ladies of the Endeavor Society, who
'make themselves useful in sewing for the
liu\s, supplying stamps, etc. In the even
ing men look out for the tents, re
maining until 10 p. m.
Mrs. W. O. Discho is chairman of the
i committee having in charge the giving of
socials each evening at the Christian En
deavor headquarters. These socials have
done an Incalculable good in limiting the
baleful influence of the saloons which sur
ruund the camp.
L/ast Friday the Hamilton Square Bap
tist Church gave a concert, which was
followed by refreshments and a short
praise service. On Saturday evening the
Plymouth Congregational Church had
charge. Last evening a praise service was
held, and this evening the Grace M. E.

AMERICA'S FUTURE.
A Caustic Lecture by Bey. J.
Hemphill.
Rev. J. Hemphlll of the Calvary Pres
byterian Church spoke last night on the
future of America at the* close of the
present war. He said: "America is God"Â»
chosen land just as Palestine was. Our
broad country stretching from ocean to
ocean is the grandest in the world and
offers every opportunity for development.
Plenty and peace will reign and our fu
ture is full of the brightest prospects.
"The statement that this country con
tains as many Catholics as Protestants
is a colossal falsehood. Out of the 02,000,.
000 people of the last census B7,000,0(h) arc
Christians in sympathy and sentiment.
Out of that number 49,000,000 are Protest
ant in sympathy and sentiment. Roman
catholics will never dominate this coun
try, though politically they are dominat
ing' it now. Instead of a ratio of seven
Protestant ofttceholders to one Catholic
in this city, there are seventy Catholics
to one Protestant. Spain was and is v
Catholic country. The American idea is
so antagonistic to the Roman idea that
the latter can never conquor."
The harbor of Rio Janeiro has fifty
miles of anchorage, and is the finest in
the world.

to the Endeavorers all they receive to be
! distributed. Testaments are in great de
mand, and it is the endeavor of the com
i fort bag committee to have each bag con
| tain either a. prayer book or a Testament.
â  More Testaments are needed, as the sup

Special mention should be made of the
i fact that the soldiers stationed at the
i Fontana warehouse have been given
I many pleasant evenings by the Franklin
i street Presbyterian Church.
Many Endeavor Societies have been
i formed all over the camp by Robert Cle

I committee of Golden Gate Union.
Rev. Mr. Wood has given his whole time
â¢ to Endeavor work at the camp for the
[ past several weeks and is deserving of the
highest praise for the splendid service he
has rendered.
Free Spanish lessons are given dally at
i the camp, full particulars concerning
: which can be obtained at the Endeavor
headquarters.

WATSONVILLE. Cal., July 10.â letter j
from Camp Barrett from one of the mem- '
bers of Company D, Eighth Regiment,
California Volunteers, appeared In the
Watsonville Register this morning, of j
which the following is an extract:
"Middleton acts the man. Do not be
lieve any rumors you may hear about our [
boys falling out of the company. We have
enlisted for the war. We wanted E. A. i
Middleton for second lieutenant, and after
our arrival some of the boys decided to
drop out if he was not appointed. When
Middleton was informed of this he
thanked us for our interest in him, but
would not hear of any such action. He
said it was not right and urged us to
stand by the company whether he re
ceived a commission or not. Acting upon
his advice we had a talk with Captain
Elliott on the morning before we were
mustered in and agreed to stand by him
in peace or war. As our second lieutenant
has not yet been appointed, we still hope !
that Middleton will get the place. He ;
is all right, and thero is nothing small
about him. He has done everything he !
could for our comfort, and the boys ap
preciate his efforts."
Mr. Middleton recruited a body of fifty- j
three men and turned them over to Cap- i
tain Elliott of the above mentioned com- i
pany. This community is considerably i
wrought up over the announcement that
Mr. Middleton will not receive a commis- '
sion. When the announcement of the offl- )
cers appointed to command the Eighth I
Regiment was made last week, the posi- '
tion of second lieutenant of Company D i
was left vacant, and it was hoped here \
that this position was being reserved for \
Mr. Middleton, but S. M. English was ap- j
pointed to the place, as published in to- i
day's Call.

RIFLEMEN TO
SHOOT HARD
Polishing- Up for the
Coming 1 Bund.
CANNOT BEGIN TOO SOON
GOOD SCORES TO START WITH AT
SHELL MOUND.
Dr. Rodgers. Schuster, Pape and
Others Forge Ahead With Rifle
and Pistol â Others
Will Follow,
The decision of the National Schuetzen-
Bund to hold its next festival in this city
was the principal topic of conversation at
the Shell Mound rifle range yesterday.
This event is of no small importance, not
only to the riflemen of the West, but to
the public in general. The most active
members of the Bund are among the
wealthiest men of the United States and
wherever they go they spend money very
freely. More than that the Bund offers
prizes, cash and merchandise, that amount
to thousands of dollars. This shooting
event take:; place every three years and
riflemen from all over the United States
and Hurope are sure to attend. From all
accounts there are between 2,000 and 3.000
now at the festival that is tahlng place,
and closes to-day, at the big Glendale
range on Long Island, N. Y. As has been
announced, there are several of Califor
nia's best shots at this event, and it was
through their efforts that the Bund de
cided to come to this city in 190 L
The range across the bay was well filled â 
yesterday, for all that this is the time of I
the year that most people go out of town j
for their summer vacations. Several good j
scores were made. Dr. L. O. Rodgers was
one o{ those who had cause to rejoice. In
the 20-shot class contest of the Germania
Schuetzen Club he made 451 points, one
point less than the record of the club. Dr.
Kodgers is also a member of the Colum
bia Pistol and Rifle Club, and on the 50
yard pistol range he made 43, Columbia !
target count, whichis the best he has '
done in a class contest.
Another whose success was worth spe- I
cial notice was F. P. Schuster. In the |
Norddeutcher bullseye contest he stood i
high with 638 points, machine measure- '
ment, and won first money. This shot also \
! won for him a prize of no small value. It |
! was a beautiful rocking chair presented :
by John Thode and F. Hagemann Jr. An
other of the same club who was proud of I
what he had done was Gus Schulz. lie

Captain 1... Siebe for the best three bulls i

\ A. H. Pape of the San Francisco Schuet- i
' zen Verein carried off the Champion !

I cession.
Some of the most prominent riflemen
were absent. D. W, McLaughlin, F. O. !
Young, A. Stettin and D. Heise are now \

this State in the competitions with the j
crack shots from all over the world. An- j

ville, California, last Saturday evening.
The occasion was the annual meeting of
I the board of directors of the Home and
the members of the Veterans' Home As
sociation. Among the distinguished vis
itors present was Colonel William C.
Smith of the First Tennessee Volunteers,
wao went there as the guest of Mr. and
Mrs. Charles H. Blinn. The news of the
! arrival of the gallant soldier from Ten
nessee, who had served with so much re
nown In the onfederate army, soon
â  reached the Union veterans. To give
; all a chance to greet him it was decided
I to hold a meeting at Social Hall in tho
1 evening, "\.hen Colonel Smith was lntro
j duced as a soldier who once wore the
I gray and was now wearing the blue, 500
i veterans of the Union cause arose before
I the words of introduction had been ut-
I tered to the finish, and gave the soldier
1 from Tennessee a mighty shout of wel
'â . come. The demonstration of greeting was
j renewed and prolonged. It was some min
utes before the veteran of the South
could rally to respond in words to the
magnificent ovation. He addressed the
men before him as "Comrades," and
finally sought permission to call them
"Boys." Then he related some incidents
of the Richmond campaign and soon
gained the earnest attention of his audi
ence. In the course of his speech, in
i which he dr;elt upon the blessings of a
j reunited country, he stepped to the flag,
- and, taking the staff in his hand, walked
across the stage. The incident caused a
tempest of cheers and shouts of approval.
j The simple and soldierly style of Colonel
! Smith's address won the hearts of all the
1 veterans. The reception was continued
i until a late hour. Nellie Holbrook Blinn
I delighted the audience with appropriate
recitations. Mrs. Dr. Keables, wife of the
i medical director, accompanied by Mrs. C.

AMERICA'S GREAT MISSION.
Rev. O. C. Miller Joins in the Presi
dent's Proclamation for
Prayer.
Rev. O. C. Miller of the Church of the
Holy Spirit occupied the pulpit at the
Simpson Memorial Church on Hayes and
Buchanan streets last night. Taking his
text from St. John, viii:32, he read the
President's proclamation requesting: the
nation's prayers on the Sabbath following
its publication. The language In this
proclamation he compared with words
which were expressed by Abraham Lin
coln at the time when the nation was en
gaged in the Civil War, now happily
ended for all time.
The present war he believed to be in
keeping with the divine command of God,
who Bald: "Let my people be free that
taey may worship me." The war in which
the nation is now engaged is a battle for
truth against errorâ light against dark
ness and superstition. Jesus said, "That
we shall know the truth." The echo of
Sampson's and Shafter's guns is the
voice of God heard proclaiming these
words against a nation that gave Dirth to
the inquisition, one of the most cruel and
tyrannical institutions ever planted on the
earth by man; a nation that hates the
truth and will fight to keep it out of its
dominion. But the will of God is stronger
than that of any nation, and now the
truth will be known in Spain through the
irstrumpntality of the liberty-loving peo
plo of the United States, as made mani
fest in the words of God.
"This is the second time that Spain un
dertook to crush truth. The first was
when that nation sent its ships to Eng
land to crush out light and truth in the
reign of Queen Elizabeth; and what was
the consequence? The entire fleet was

Tennessee Regiment Drill.
Much Interest is being taken by the
working committees in connection with
the Tennessee Regiment drill to be given
at Mechanics' Pavilion next Thursday
evening. A large committee representing
all parts of the city has been appointed
on sale of tickets, and the regiment will
be sure of a splendid ovation.
destroyed on the shores of England just
as it has been by Sampson on the shores
of Cuba and on the shores of Manila by
the brave Dewey; and the arms of Spain
will got the final blow at the hands of
Shafter, the hero, in the course of a few
days.
Mysterious is the way of the Lord
Over 300 years ago a small band of Hu
guenots, driven out of their own country
because they believed in the truth, set
tled in Florida. Their presence there was
communicated to the court of Spain and
an army of soldiers was sent across the
ocean which butchered this innocent band
of brave men and women. Now, how
ever, the Lord in his wisdom has seen tit
to make the same locality the scene of
planting the truth of the gospel on the
shores of Florida. So it is that God has
selected this nation to be the instrument
of spreading the truth throughout the
world, against the nation that originated
the inquisition.
America has a great duty thrust upon
it in this war; it is to spread light, liberty
and truth to the far east, and, in fact, to
the entire world. The days of darkness,
ignorance and superstition will in a short
time disappear, and in their stead liberty
and freedom will shine on all of God's
creatures.

by Soldiers at Sutro's Baths.
A larger crowd than the average visited
the Park, Cliff House and Chutes yester
day. Sutro's Baths were also well patron

they were not disappointed. Boys in blue
by the score entered in the various con

excitement. The various contests resulted

One Expedition Sailed From Charles

Will Go To-Day.
CHARLESTON, S. C, July 10.â The
steamship Rita, captured recently off
Cuba by the Yale and purchased yester
day by the United States Government for
. 5125,000, sailed for Santiago this afternoon
with 650 men of the Si^th Illinois Regi
ment r.nd their baggage. One battalion
of the regiment sailed with the expedition
under General Garretson on the Colum
bia. It was found that the Rita could
not carry the remaining SCO men, so com
panies D and M were left here. This
divides the regiment badly.
The embarkation at 0:30 o'clock was an
inspiring sight. The men of the Six
teenth Pennsylvania and Second and
Third Wisconsin regiments were drawn
up on neighboring pier beads, their regi
mental bands playing patriotic airs which
were responded to tiy the band of the
Illinois regiment on the steamer. It had
been raining hard all day, but just aa
the Rita drew out Into the stream tx
perfect rainbow appeared spanning tho
entrance to the harbor like a triumphal
nrch, under which the ship was sailing.
The watching soldiers caught the signifi
cance of the Incident and a cheer swept
along the water front that could bÂ«
heard all over the city.
The Grand Duchess is expected off tho
bar to-night to take a third expedition
to Santiago to-morrow.

WASHINGTON, July 10.â This has been I
a day of thanksgiving and prayer In the i
nation's capital. The president's recent i
proclamation resulted in a concert of pa- i
triotic utterances from many pulpits.
Prayers were offered for an early con
summation of peace. In nearly every
church where the proclamation had sug
gested the topic of the sermon, special j
music and patriotic prayers were ren
dered, many of the services closing wltn
the hymn "America."
President McKinley as usual, attended
the morning services 1 t the Metropolitan |
M. E. Church. II- went alone and was
deeply impressed by the discourse de
livered by the pastor, the Rev. Frank

long before th*Â» services began. Scores of
persons remained standing throughout
and many more went away unable to
gain admission.
Dr. Bristol's sermon hold tho attention '
of his auditors throughout. At times his i
hearers were so thoroughly aroused by i
his patriotic utterances thnt ripples of
spontaneous applause swept over the con
gregation.

ATHLETICS
VICTORIOUS
They Defeat the Fresnos
Handily.
A GREAT TRIPLE PLAY |
THE BIG CROWD CHEERED AND
HOOTED.
The Game Contained More Real Sen
sational Plays Than All the
Others Combined â Reilly's
Great Home Run.
BY JOE CORBETT.
A handsome crowd of 3000 people turned j
out to witness the game between the Ath- i
l'tlcs and Fresnos yesterday afternoon |
at Recreation Park, and were given a
treat long to be remembered. Never tn
the brief history of this park were so
many brilliant and phenomenal plays ex- J
ecuted, and never did a crowd make
manifest Its appreciation of noble efforts
in a more convincing manner. Time and j
again they were brought to their feet to
cheer and applaud the individual work of
some player, until vocal chords finally re
belled and plays that In an ordinary
game would have caused pandemonium
were allowed to pass almost unnoticed.
Truly it was a beautiful sight.
Of course, there were plays having a
strong resemblance to the color of those
Fresno uniforms, but what did It matter
so long as every player fought hard and
earnestly.
Then again, if a player made an error
in one Inning, in the next he would com
pel that crowd which had previously
hooted to stand up and howl themselves
Into a state of ecstacy over some one
handed stop or other unusual play he
would make.
So it was all through the game. One
, j handed stops, running catches, a triple
i play, singles, two-baggers, home runs,
, all in such rapid succession that it was
simply Impossible to keep track of them.
To add to the glory of the occasion, for
I it was glorious from the start, were the
repeated cries of "Kill the umpire:" "Oh,
: but you're rotten:" Then from some j
j other unexpected quarter would come the j
! remark "You are full of incandescent j
lights and cheesecloth"' Then a more in
telligent character seated in the vicinity
lof the bar would shout, "Mr. Umpire,
â¢ | that decision at third base was the;
! rankest piece of daylight embezzlement!"
Now when such criticisms creep Into a
j game, the people are Interested, and are I
I enjoying themselves. So it was yesterday.
i They took exception to every decision
that presented itself, Bhowed their dis- t
pleasure by uttering some uncomplimeii
tary remark, and then, right on top of (
this, would jump up and fairly shake the
stands, In showing their appreciation of
some clever play. What more could be i
desired? The people enjoyed every mo
ment devoted to the game; the players in
return put forth their best efforts, and j
| simply covered themselves with glory.
The' plays that were particularly Btart-
I ling and conspicuous were the triple play, i
I made by Johnson, assisted by Reilly and '
ii J yne; the home run made by Reilly. who
put the ball over the right Held fence on
a line; that one-handed stop and double
. play made by Stultz; the great running i
catch of a pop fly and throw to second i
[ retiring the runner at that base, made by j
; Mangerlna; and the splendid running
â  catch of a long fly made by Ford There
were, as I said before, other clever plays,
but as the ones mentioned were responsi
ble for all the noise. I will leave the oth- i
ers for future discussion.
The game was won by the Athletics
i through opportune hitting and superb
i fielding. Fitzpatrick, who did the twirl-
Ing, was pounded unmercifully by the
Fresnos, yet the base hit column does not
prove It. Line hit after line hit did those
boys make, and as often were they
knocked down. They were certainly un
fortunate, but good hitting must ev< r
puccumb to such phenomenal fielding as
that accomplished by their opponents.
To give an illustration of how strongly
| the fates were against them, look into the j
play that follows:
In the fifth inning, with men on first ;
rind second basts and no one out, Earley
| hit a ball like a shot in the direction of
, third base. All hands started round, but i
Johnson leaped in the air, caught the ball,
tossed it to Reilly, who in turn threw it
I to flrst, completing the best triple play
seen at Recreation I 'ark.
On a number of other occasions terrific
hits were either captured or knocked J
down when they meant runs, so Fitz- i
Patrick should thank his fielders for win- \
ning yesterday's game.
Thomas, on the other hand, while not
as steady as he might have been, was hit j
j opportunely, and nearly every mistake j
i made by his support and himself proved |
' fatal. He pitched good ball considering
that he participated in Saturday's con- j
test. The Fresnos did not display the
form of Saturday and should continue
practicing. They should also secure an
| other good pitcher.

GREAT BALL AT STOCKTON.
Home Team and Friscos Tie
in the Fourteenth Inning.
STOCKTON. July 10.â A remarkable
game of baseball waa played here to-day
between the Stockton and San Francisco
rlubs. It was a hard and game struggle
up to the twelfth inning, at the end of
which not a man on either side had
reached the home plate. In the thir
teenth the ice was broken and each team
scored twice. There was great excite
ment in this inning, particularly when the
ront-st was declared a draw. This was the
last game of the season here. The fol
io whig summary shows the close work:

"SANDCRABS" WORSTED.
San Jose Very Handily . De-
feats Santa Cruz.
SAN JOSE, July 10.-Santa Cruz, rein
forced by a throng of Surf City adherents,
to-day invaded the domain of Manager
Weston and narrowly escaped being shut
out. San Jose was also out in force, the
attendance being the largest of the sea
son. The game itself was as pretty a con
test as one could wish to see, beautiful
plays predominating throughout. San
Jose started the ball rolling in fifth, when
on two doubles and two singles three men
scored. In the eighth another was
added on singles by Hanlon and Eagan
aided by some scientific Juggling on the
part of Santa Cruz. The Sand Crabs did
not tally until two men were out in the
ninth, when an error allowed them to put
two men across the rubber, lberg and
Balsz were opposing twlrlers and each
pitched a masterly game. Fitzgerald's
iirst base work was the (inest ever seen
on the local grounds, nothing being too
hard or difficult for him. The score was:

but against the stonewall front of the Gilt

NOT LOOKING
FOR MARTYRS
No Republican Wish for
Dr. Pardee's Sacrifice.
DESERTERS NOT IN FAVOR
HAS THE MOUNTAIN OR HAS
MOHAMMED MOVEDP
Historical Facts of the Past Four
Years Lead to Some Very Re
markable Conclusions in
Alameda County.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
â¢ â â  Broadway, July 10.
The Republicans of Alameda County are
not Looking for a martyr to represent
them in the State convention. They do
not consider it neeosaary for a man to
sacrifice his reputation in order to obtain
an honor from the party. They fully be
lieve that if Alameda desires to place a ;
man in nomination for any oflice in the j
gift of the people there are plenty whose j
Integrity, honor and Republicanism can- j
not bo questioned. Of the 16.000 Republi
cans in this county there are probably 100
âall of them office seekersâ believe I
that their party is in such a dire condi- ,
tion that it is necessary to put forward '
as an independent candidate for Governor -
a man who during the past five years has
never lost an opportunity to decry Repub
licanism and to express his pride and i
thank God that he has shaken off its I
Bhackels. This hungry little band of men
are trying to persuade the remaining
15,900 that it will be an act of supreme
condescension on the part of a man who
lamented only three years ago that he
had ever been seduced by the Republican
party to accept the highest honor in the J
party.
Alameda County does not share these j
opinions, and no amount of cheap notor- '
lety attained through a personal organ
can create in the party in this county >
such a stultified opinion ol itself.
Dr. Pardee; a non-Republican, is being '
boomed in this county by his little band ,
for the Republican nomination for Gov
ernor. It la necessary to recall this tact
becaut judging from the press of the .
State, little Is known of this unique farce i
outside of Alameda 'ounty. Dr. Pardee j
is a good fellow socially and a gentleman. |
Politically he is a "good thing"â and any- j
thing but a Republican. This is the alpha j
and omega of the doctor with the party
at lar{ One would judge from his ut- j
terances in his organ that he is a great
pow< r and if such a delusion gives any
satisfaction they are welcome to it, but;
it bas not deceived the party. To have
political ambition with not enough of
Intellect to carry it beyond the ridiculous
stage is a mis:"orvune, but there is no
reason why any such misfortune should
be inflictfd on an eatire party. If Ala.- i
meda County wants anything from the'
State convention it has intellect enough
to know that It must put before the Re- I
publicans of the State a strong party ;
man. not a political contortl I No i
amount of ilstry can olind the eyes i
of the party of this tact, nor is It blind- I
ing them.
Had any one made any ference to j
Dr. Pardee's private life he would have,
been guilty of a gross unerentlemanly act, j
for no citizen has any rij<ht whatever to |
deal with a public man other than as con
cerns hi* public acts". Dr. Pardee, how
ever, has transgressed this rule, for dur
ing th< past week he l:as charged false
hood and Insanity and vlndlcuvenesa to :
some one who published me of the doc
tor's own uncontradic'ted speeches. No
one knows ttei than Dr. Pardee that
his public uturances when seeking per- <
sviai glory three and five years ago, wehe ,
all directed to traducing the Republican
party.
"I ai proud to say I was one of those
who bolted the iblican convention of
four years ago," said Dr. Pardee.
"I regret to say that two years later I
was seduced Into voting the Republican
ticket," said Dr. Pardee.
"The Republican . irty is owned by cor
porations." said Dr. Pard
"Dire calamities will result if the Re
publican party su< ceeds." said Dr. Par- â 
dee. And up till this hour neither orally
or through hii organ, has he given I
the slightest Intimation that he has
been Lgain "seduced" by this contempti- :
ble, degrading, corporation-owned Repub- i
lican party. â 
If Dr. Pardee's recent utterances be
true, he is in the peculiar condition of a
man. half of him going one way and half
going the other. Four years ago he was
loud In his declarations that he was not
a Republican and a strong- anti-railroad
man. For the purpose of argument, wo
will admit that the doctor then told the
truth. It will also be admitted, for the
same purpose, that he then told the truth
when he said that the Republican party
represented the railr< and "everything
that is Indecent and corrupt." If at the
present time, although he has nor jo stat
ed, he be a Republican, he has constituted
himself the leader of everything that a
few short years ago â when he wanted
somethingâ he was denouncing. Conse
quently, he is now as much a Belf-con
fessed railroad man as a publican. It
Is true he has not said he is a Republican,
but tnybody but lunatics would naturally
presume that he wished to create such an
impression by leeking a Republican nom
ination. No doubt this kind of logic will

b? In due time condemned in Dr. Pardee's
organ as false and the ravings of a luna
tic, but the argument, it must be remem
bered, is that of Dr. Pardee.
Or, If this conclusion be not true, that
Dr. Pardee has gone to the railroad com
pany, the reductio ad absurdum of the sit
uation naturally follows, that tho moun
tain has come to Mohammed. It would
be very interesting to be able to adduce
proof that the corporations, especially the
railroad company, with all the brains
that it employs and the immense possibil
ities It possesses for promulgating politi
cal corruption, had 'come over to Dr. Par
dee's way of thinking. Should the pre
vious conclusion be denied, no other sug
gestion is left, except one, and that is.
that Dr. Pardee considers himself intel
lectually the superior of Abraham Lin
coln and presumes that he can fool all the
people all the time.
If Alameda County has any claim on
the Republican party of this State at
this time â and it undoubtedly has â it is
due to the heroic party work carried out
during the McKinley campaign. If the
reward for such work be narrowed down
to individuals, it naturally follows that
sr.ch rewards are Jthe rights of those who
took a leading part in that campaign.
Memories have been racked, newspaper
files have been searched, but so far no
one has been able to discover that Mr.
McKinley is indebted even in a small de
gree .or in any other degree to the inde
pendent Dr. Pardee. If he made a speech
during that campaign, if he contributed
in any oral, literary or financial way to
the great Republican success of '%, it Is
time his little band heralded such infor
mation to a waiting county.
If the doctor were even a private sup-
Eorter of the great McKinley, let the
eavens tell it, for the earth cannot.
Another of the evidences of puerility In
Dr. Pardee's Independent campaign is his
repeated assertion, through his organ,
that about four men, including Steve T. j
Gage, and Charles Mautelan, are about all j
who are opposed to Dr. Pardee. Appar- j
ently the doctor has not heard of John E. j
Fa mum, who was the choice of the party !
of this county to preside over its last
county convention; of W. V. Witcher,
ex-president of the Merchants' Exchange;
of George W. Arper, president of the
same body; of H. A. Powell, whom Dr.
Pardee selected as one ot the leading
counsel in the water front cases; of John
A. Britton; of Fred E. Whitney, a leading
Republican of the Second Ward; of W. R.
Davis, in whom Dr. Pardee, at the time
he was not a Republican, placed so much
confidence that he entrusted him with the
management of the water front cases; of
\V. W. Knickerbocker, member of the Re
publican State committee; of ex-Judge
Charlos N. Fox, of L. G. Burpee. George
F. Neece, John Yule and the rest of the
leading Republicans of this county.
There have been so many able political
managers evolved in Alameda County
during the past twenty years whose man
ner of manipulating politics has been so
well exploited that it is at this time im
possible to throw dust in the eyes of the
veriest tyro In the county. Misrepresen
tation has little effect where the truth 1*
known. Evasion of facts by substituting
personality and weak attempts to be
funny no longm inspire respect. Sell
adulation at so much per pace carries
no weight, but somehow or other thess
facts, which are apparent to a schoolboy,
:â â¢ m to be entirely beyond the ken of the
astute political managers of Dr. Pardee.
Since Dr. Pardee is so pronouncedly in
dependent in politics and anything, if he
t>e believed, but Republican, it be
comes of Interest to inquire into the mo
tives of those who are so earnestly sup
porting him. It is true that many of
them are earnest members of so-called
"Pardee" Republican clubsâ the latesi
brand of personal politics in this county.
On this showing they might be excused,
but they have caused it to be understood
that ihey intend to go before a Repub
lican convention and seek nominations.
Jt is known that the ties which bind th:Â»
little band to Dr. Pardee are of a very
material nature. Assistance, protection
and influence in various forms all cut a
iigure, and not so very long ago it wa*
only by a very strong effort that there
was not a schism in their ranks. How
soon another such danger may threaten
the little band is not known, but there are
already evidences that fealty to each
other is an unknown quantity,
and indeed lt could hardly be
Otherwise where pure selfiishness is
the controlling virtue. Facts are
not wanting to prove what will be the
results of such disloyal work. Just
through the agency of such work four
years ago this county so strongly R*v
publican, was delivered largely into the
hands of Independence and Populism. If
Dr. Pardee's methods of doing politic*
prevail, the same calamity will follow this
year. All California has laughed at thÂ«>
fact that although Alameda is the ban
ner Republican county, half our county
officers, and that the most important,
are not Uiled by Republicans. In tiio
Oakland city government three and flvs
years ago the same condition prevailed,
and was due entirely and unreservedly to
the mad, personal ambitions of Dr. Par
dee, who now is being blindly led to be
lieve that California will honor him as
its foremost Republican.
Bui why refer to Dr. Pardee In con
nection with the Republican party Out
side that party volumes might be writ
ten of his doings, but among Republi
cans he has no place. And of his great
"anti-railroad" record what remains?
Let West Oakland answer. Thediscontinu
ance of free trains, great depreciation of
property values, according to Assessor
Dalton's figures last week, and the mem
ory of much public money used for legal
B< rvices, and â also according to Mr. Dai
tonâthe permanent loss of tho water
front.

FLORAL DEVICES REPRESENT
ING INCIDENTS IN HIS LIFE.
Rev. James S. McDonald, Who Mar
ried Him Thirty Years Ago,
Preached His Funeral Ser
mon Yesterday.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
SOS Broadway. July 10.
The funeral of the late Senator Eli S. I
Denlson took place this afternoon from \
tho Unitarian Church. There was a I
wealth of lloral tributes and a large at
tendance of the friends of the deceased.
Rev. James S. McDonald, assistant pastor '
of the First Presbyterian Church, who |
officiated at the wedding of Mr. and Mrs. j
j Denison just thirty years ago,, preached !
i the sermon to-day at the request of the
' bereaved widow.
The floral tributes were numerous and <
! magnificent, the largest being a car In
' blue and white flowers, presented by his
â  former employes. There were also large
, pieces from Oakland Parlor No. 50, N. S.
G. \Y., the Athenian Club, the Elks and
; the Republican Alliance. The casket was
a superb affair and was borne by six col
ored men, life-long friends of the de
. ceased. They were Messrs. R. Leonard,
; T. W. Logan, J. B. Wilson, H. Homager,
J. Blackstone and C. J. Bernett The
pall-bearers were Messrs. Cap taint- K- MÂ«

' Laura Denison and Miss Olive Denison,
'. the two daughters of the deceased; J. Lt.
Denison and Harry Denison, two sons.
The Bervlcea were of the most simple
! nature. There was no music, and after
i a short prayer Rev. McDonald read the
â  last chapter of Revelations and referred
; to the wedding thirty years ago and the
< domestic happiness >f tin deceased. In
: referring to his business career the speak
er said:
â¢'Thirty years ago I formed my ac
quaintance with tho departed. He was
; engaged in a unique business â one that
none of us know a thin? about Hundreds
of young men who have grown to man
hood, and may now be in this house, re
'â  ceived their first start in life from him,
thus helping them to a career of useful
ness. His public life was one of honor
. able influence, and he left many friends,
as your presence here to-day testifies."
Interment was private and took place
ai Mountain View Cemetery in the family
plot.
'CORPORAL LEW"
IS LAID TO REST
FUNERAL OF L. R. TOWNSEND,
THE VETERAN GUARDSMAN.
The Seventh Volunteer Regiment of
San Diego Escorts the Body
to the Cemetery-
The lost bugle call, heralding Louis R.
Tow; send to the tomb, waa sounded yes
terday afternoon at the armory of the
Seventh Regiment, N. G. C, at Pace and
Gough streets.
Robed in the uniform of his country,
with tho American flag draped as a pall
over and concealing the black casket be
nealh, the body of the old Guardsman
was given the last rites of the soldier
and the last marks of respect and vener
ation by his surviving comrades and by
the members of the Seventh Regiment of
to-dayâ soldiers of the younger genera
tion who have succeeded the old guard.
The funeral obsequies were held at 2
o'clock by Rev. .Edgar Lyon of St.
Stephen's Church, in conformity with the
rites of the Episcopal faith. Hundreds of
sorrowing friends surrounded the bier of j
the old soldier, offering up a prayer or j
placing a floral tribute upon his coffin !
in expression of their sorrow. Judge
Hebbard pronounced the eulogy and re
viewed the life of tlif: corporal, outlining
the noble and exemplary career of tho
decedent, both as a soldier and as a
man. He spoke and applauded the ex
pressed wish thiit Corporal Townsend
had mad- when hostilities broke out with
Spain, "that he would liko to go to Ma
nila with the rest of the boys." and re
gretted that his advanced years prevent
ed him from fulfilling this wish. As tho
keenest zest in life of late years had j
been afforded by his association with
and in the company of the members of
the Seventh Regiment he longed to go
and share their fortunes and their tri
umphs and trials with them.
Immediately after the funeral ceremony,
the body was conveyed to the Odd Pel-
Lows' Cemetery, being escorted by the
Seventh Volunteer Regiment from San j
Diego. The funeral dirge was rendered i
by the musicians of the snmo regiment.
who led the funeral procession from tho
armory to the cemetery. Among the
pallbearers selected from the old Guard
were tho following: General Hews ton.
General J. Howell, Edward If. Prentice,
H. A. Plate, ex-captain of the Old Guard,
J. L. Basket!, J. G. Steele, General Wal
ter Turnbull and Colonel S. J. Taylor.
At the cemetery, preparatory to the
cremation a volley was ilred over the
body by the firing company of the Sun
. Volunteer Regiment. Many beau
tiful floral tributes, from mpmbers of th*
Old Guard ami from the remaining mem
bers of the Seventh Kegiment now in the
city, were placed beside the bier in thÂ«
crematorium just before the body was
lowered to the receptacle below.
Corporal Townsend was 07 years of age
and had been a prominent figure in mili
tary circles for nearly half a century.
For forty-four years he had served in
the National Guard of California, fln t
joining the organization as a member of
the City Guard on May 5, lK r Â»4. On April
18, ICT2, he was appointed and reluctantly
accepted the rank of corporal, as be pre
ferred to be among the boys of the rank
and flic. Later In 1^77 he was promoted
to thf position of second lieutenant of
Company B of the same regiment, lie

DIED AT HIS
POST OF DUTY
Captain "Happy Jack"
Hansen Drowned.
THE DINGY WAS CAPSIZED
HE AND THE MATE WERE RUN
NING A LINE ASH
Robert Frolec Nearly Killed by Two
Footpads Who Attacked Him
at North Beach Last
Night.
The schooner Reliance came Into port
yesterday with her flag at half mast.
Captain Hansen was drowned at Nei>
Haven, and Mate Johnson brought the
vessel to San Francisco. On July 5 the
captain found it necessary to run another
line to the shore, bo he and the mate got
into the dingy and proceeded to do the
job. Quite a sea was running and the
boat was capsized and the two men were
thrown into the water. By great good
luck they both reached the overturned
dingy, but Hansen was in an exhausted
condition. His companion did everything
possible to help him, but he finally slip
ped under and went down. Johnson held
onto the boat for over an hour before
assistance came to him, and when put
aboard the Reliance he was more dead
than alive.
Captain Hansen was known In every
lumber port on the coast as "Happy
Jack." He was always In a good humor
and wa3 a great favorite with all who
came in contact with him. His death
was a great blow to his crew, and they
were a sorrowtui lot of men who brought
the Reliance into port yesterday.
The police are looking for two men who
half killed Robert Frolec at Isorth Beach
last Saturday night. About 11:30 p. m.,
while on his way to his home at 634
Chestnut street, Frolec was accosted ai
the corner ot Bay street and Montgomery
avenue by two men. He attempted to
get away from them, when the shorter
of the two struck him on the right leg
with a club, breaking the limb, while the
other hit him on the nose, knocking him
down. There was then a disturbance in
the next block and the men ran away.
From 11:30 p. m. until 1 a. m. Frolec
lay on tho sidewalk groaning and calling
feebly for help. Finally Officer R. Kerri
son heard him, and sending for the am
bulance had the unfortunate fellow re
moved to the Harbor Receiving Hospital.
Yesterday Officer Kerrison brought In a
couple of suspects. Froles said neither of
them was his assailant.
Three sugar boats that made unusually
long pasages from Hawaii got in Satur
day afternoon, and yesterday. Captain
Calhoun* of the bark Ceylon, was very
much pleased when he learned that he
fa 1 beaten the schooner Spokane into
port. The latter Is a very smart ves
si-1, and when the schooner and bark met
on the way here Captain Jamieson sig
naled as his vessel forged ahead: "I'll
1" at you eight days into San Francisco."
Both vessels were over thirty days get
ting here, but the Ceylon was first.
Baffling winds off the coast caused all
tho trouble.
Tho bark Himalaya was spoken last
Thursday ten miles northwest of Point
Reyes by the steamer Crescent City, and
yet she cnly reached port yesterday, after
a run of thirtj-four days from Hono
lulu.
Another party of goM hunters arrived
from Philadelphia on the schooner
'Thomas F. Bayard HBterdayj On July
7 she was spoken by the steamer George
Loomis off Point Sur, and had a hard
time of it making that short distance into
port in two days and a half. The Bayard
made only one stop on the way out
and that was at Valparaiso, Her passen
gers and crew are going to push forward
as rapidly p.s possible to the gold fields.
MEN OF THE HOUR.
Lecture by Rev. J. A. B. Wilson Be
fore the Young Men's Chris
tian Association.
Rev. John A. B. "Wilson delivered a loc-
ture on the "Young Man for the Hour"
yesterday afternoon during the patriotic
services held at the Young Men's Chris
tian Association bulidinK- He said: "The
man for the hour is the man who is ready
I for it when the hour strikes. The men
; who live twenty-live years before their
! time are rare men. but the opportunity
brings out the men of the hour. The eiv
i ilization of the world has been held back
I for years by a nation which has lived in a
I Ptate of savagery under the pretence and
! forms of civilization. The hour is now
upon us to stop the inhuman outrages
that this country has forced upon its sub
; Jeets. The islands of the Pacific and the
Atlantic which have felt the tyranny of
this country should see the light of an
| ennobling liberty and receive the bles3
i ings of our civilization.
"There are men coming to the front in
this light und they are the men of the
j hour. Dewey is one of tho Christian he
roea who has shown to the world a pa
! triotism and a God-fearing spirit Which
!is responsible for his heroism. }?ut the
I young man of the hour is Hobson, who
I has come from the South to show us that
we now are in unison, and that we will
cast abroad the civilizing instruments of
the Anglo-Saxons. Hobson is the type of
that hero who is from the Sunday schnol
â  and is ever taught by the lessons of the
' L J .ib!e."
, HALLAHAN AND DELAHANDY.
! The Former Accuses the I/atter of
Biting: His Thumb to the Bone.
OAKLAND, July 10.â George Hallahan,
the caterer, applied at the Receiving Hos
pital last evening: and had a thumb
dressed which was lacerated to the bone.
He accuses. P. J. Delehandy of causing
the injury, and alleges that Delehandy
bit him.
'ill'- trouble happened in Fennessoy's
liquor store on Broadway and Twelfth
street. : Hallahan has â¢ been feeding the
officers of the Eighth Rfgiment until last
week, and was talking to Fennessey's
clerk, P. Hanrahan, about the camp, and
told him he stood on good terms with the
men and would try to get the liquor
trade for the store. Hallahan alleges
that at this point Delehandy called him
a liar and Baid he wouid never, do any
such thir.fr. At this Hallahan jumped
onto Delahandy to compel him to retract
his statement. In the fracas that fol
lowed Hallahan's thumb . was. nearly
chewed off.

PRAYED FOR NATIONAL VICTORY,
Thanksgiving Services in Answer to the. Presi
dent's Proclamation.
WITH the nation"s thanks let there be mingled the nation's prayers
that our gallant sons may be shielded from harm alike on the battle
fields and in the clash of fleets, and be spared the scourge of suffer
ing and disease while, they are striving to uphold their country's
honor."
ing and disease while they are striving to uphold their country's honor."
This clause of the President's proclamation, beseeching the prayers of
the American people for the American soidiers who have crowned them
selves with glory and victory at Manila and Santiago, wag ' Uppermost in the
thoughts of the people of this city yesterjay aa they assembled in their
several houses of worship to honor tho God who has guided their sons on to
victory. Sectarianism was cast aside by all and the only thought seemed
to be of the boys in blue and their welfare. Protestants and Catholics alike
either openly or secretly offered up their prayer of thanksgiving for tho
battles won, praying fervently that their sons will ever be thus crowned
until God and man shall have willed that the cruel carnage of warfare shall
cease.
In many of the churches, especially the Epicopnlian, the proclamation
was openly rend from thr pulpit and the prayers of thanksgiving openly ex
pressed. In others, however, where this formality was not observed, the
prayers were individual but no less fervent.
To some who knelt In supplication there was a feeling of patriotism in
stilled by no other motive than the glory of the nation, being devoid of per
sonal anxiety for loved ones; to others, however, the prayer was prompted
by a reality that even as the supplication was made some loving son, father
or husband was laying down his life that the principles of union and liberty
might live among the unhappy and persecuted people for whom the nation
is lighting.
In other churches, particularly St. Luke's and the Simpson Memorial
Methodist Episcopal, the prayer of thanksgiving was coupled with a general
service arranged in answer to the proclamation. Patriotic songs were sung
and addresses based upon the probable outcome of the war and various
other topics of the same nature delivered. Eulogies on the loyalty and per
sistent bravery of the American soldiers was also pronounced and special
tribute paid to the commanders in the recent battles at Manilaand Santiago
who have won a prominent and well-merited place in the history of the
nation and the warfare of modern times. In nearly all the Protestant
churches the thanksgiving service was concluded with the singing of "The
Star-spangled Banner."
REORGANIZING
THE MILITIA
Lines on Which It Will
Be Effected.
GENERAL DICKINSON'S WORK
LOCATION OF COMPANIES IN
THE BRIGADE LIMITS.
Companies to Be Recruited to the
Minimum of Fiftyâ What Is
Going On in the Naval
Militia.
The first step toward the reorganiza
tion of the National Guard of California
has been taken. Major General Dickin
son left on last Saturday afternoon for
the lower part of the State, where he will
fof what can be done toward re-establish
ing the First Brigade, which embraces in
HAVE GOLD BUT WEARY OF KLONDIKE.
Its territorial limits the counties of Los
Angeles, Monterey, Orange, Riverside,
Ban Diego. San Bernardino, Santa Bar
bara, S;m Luis Obispo, San Benito and
Ventura. In the limits of this brigade ter
ritory there were before the draft on the
National Guard for volunteers, the Signal
Corps locate.! at Los Angeles, Troop C at
Salinas, Troop D at Los Angeles, and "the
following companies of the Seventh In
fantry: A at Los Angeles, B San Diego.
C Los Angeles, D Pomona, E Santa
Paula, P Los Angeles, G Redlands, H
Ventura. I Pasadena. X San Bernardino,
L Santa Ana and M Riverside. It is pro
posed to replace the twelve company
regiment by a ten company one, each com
pany tr> be recruited to only the minimum,
namely fifty. It will be the duty of the
major general to look into the matter of
location and ascertain where the reduced
regiment can be located to the ben possi
ble advantage. It is thought, however,
that there will not be any change of the
locations as mentioned and that probably
there will be but one company instead of
three at Lob Angeles; yet there may be
some changes, as Santa Barbara County,
San Luis Dbtspo and Sen Benito claim
that under the old location the distribu
tion of the force left them without any
representation, while Los Angeles County
had five companies of infantry. Troop D.
and the Signal Corps. The troop at Los
Angeles ana at Salinas which did not vol
unteer, because not called for, and the
Signal Corps, will remain undisturbed, but
thr; difficulty will be the apportionment of
the ten companies so as not to create any
feeling of jealousy.
As soon as the major general shall have
completed his tour of investigation he
will report to Governor Budd. the eom
mander-in-chief. and Adjutant General
Barrett, who with hlmsolf make up the
board. On his return from the south,
where he will also obtain data as to the
navnl militia station at San Diego, with
a view to reorganizing that branch of the
guard, he will look over the territorial
limits of the Third Brigade.
The promotion of Lieutenant Colonel
J. F. Burgin of the Governor's staff to
the postion of inspector of rifle practice,
with the rank of colonel, vice Park Hen
phaw, commlssined colonel of the
Eighth California Volunteers, has been
followed by the appointment of Edward
Beck as aid-de-camp to tin the vacancy
created by the promotion of Kurgin.
Louis H. Tumor, who was in command
of the Naval Militia of this State, has at
last obtained his rank. First he was a
seaman Â«>f Company D of the Naval Bat
talion, which succeeded the Naval Ro- '
serve, then he became lieutenant of thf> I
Fame company and subsequently became |
lieutenant commander <>f the Naval Bat
talion, and after the last-held session of
the Legislature the organization became '
known as the Naval Militia and he was
commissioned captain thereof. When the
call for naval volunteers to man the
scouting tugs was made he was accepted
and given the rank of acting lieutenant, 1
hut last week he was placed in com- i
mand of one of the tugs and was com
missioned as lieutenant, po that now is
his title in the navy. The others form the
militia who have been commissioned and
are now on duty are W. E. Gunn, lieu

Spain Is Unchristian.
The Rev. S. S. Cryor, pastor of West
minster Presbyterian Church found his
text last night in Revelations s:oâ "Weep
not, behold the lion of the tribe of Judah
has prevailed; open the boolt and loose
the seals thereon."
"This is the sealed book of human his
tory In the hands of Jesus Christ," said
the speaker. "Christ is the center of all
history, divides all history. Thus we find
the periods Before Christ and After
Christ in use throughout the world to aid
in sharply marking timo. Christ holds all
history in his hands. He governs and
rules all nations of earth and unfolds the
history of the world as he breaks t*ie
scaled bock.
"Any nation that does not recognize the
principles which he has taught must pass
away. 'A nation and kingdom that will
not serve the Lord must perish. Little
by little. Turkey went into decline and is
slowly but surely dying.
"Spain is another noted example. For
centuries she ' has . violated the principles
of Christianity by her cruelty and oppres
sion and is to-oay reaping the fruits of it.

"Christ is the ruling factor in human
character. All Christfansare meSed
by his standard. Modern history whether
of 'nations or individuals, recognizes this
fact: The scepter of Christ governs all
true character."

THE SAIV FKAKCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JTT^Y 11, 1898.
HERE WITH
BAGS OF GOLD
Klondikers Arriveon the
Hattie I. Phillips.
THEY ESCAPED STARVATION
ATTEMPT OF CAPITALISTS TO
CORNER PROVISIONS.
Hard Times in Dawson Next Winter
Predicted on Account of a
Scarcity of the Food
Supply.
The passengers of the Hattle I. Phillips
arrived from St. Michael early yesterday
morning and gave glowing accounts of
the gold yielding country.
The star attractions in and around the
hotel corridors yesterday were without
doubt the twenty Klondikers who arrived
on the Hattie I. Phillips, which left St.
Michael on June 2. Parents, wives and
sweethearts whose loved ones had gone
to the frozen north were early callers on
the miners anxious to gain information as
to their relatives. The passengers were
very reticent about their own financial
success, and most of them gave the Klon
dike a black eye.
The largest sum brought down by any
individual was $30,000 and the small
est (1000. The general average Is
about JiiOOO apiece. Nearly all admitted
that they were compelled to leave
the country on account of ill-health, ana
W. F. Pinkham, a mining engineer of
Boston, who was sent up to the Klondike
district on behalf of an Eastern syndi
cate is confined to his room at a local
hotel from a frost bitten foot contracted
on his way from Dawson to St. Michael.
The miners speak very bitterly of the
way a few capitalists in Dawson attempt
ed to corner the provision market and
charge exorbitant prices for flour, beans,
etc. but their scheme failed, us miners
with more provisions than they needed
sold their superfluous stock to old resi
dents at cost, and the speculators in pro
visions instead of selling flour at $75,
which was the market price early last
winter, preferred holding their stock, hop
ing to get as much as $175 for a sack of
flour, but they were dismally disappoint
ed, and would be glad to sell the same
flour now for $h a sack.
F. E. Hallor, who left Dawson City on
I May 26, stated: "I left Seattle last Au
gust, and on arriving at Skaguay immedi
ately started over the trail to Dawson,
; arriving there on October 19. I staked a
number of claims which I would con
servatively value at $lf>.(K>o. November
was the coldest month there last winter,
the thermometer at one time registering
as lev as !'â¢*> below. Tnere was an unus
ually heavy fall of snow last winter,
which made it good sleighing at all times.
People were arriving and leaving every
day, and 1 have no doubt that unless n
large number of people had become dis
satisfied and left a large number of resi
dents would have met death by starva
tion, but, fortunately, over 700 people loft
Dawson during the winter, disgusted and
i discouraged at their chances of making
a fortune. I would recommend no one tÂ»
go there who Is not In perfect health,
as the life is very severe and no one
can stand hard work up there more than
two years. I have not decided whether
I shall return there or not.
E. 11. Durbin and a party of friends
â  were caught in an Ice jam In a small operi
boat twenty-five miles below Circle City
while on their way from Dawson to St.
Michael. Mr. Durbin returns to San
Francisco the owner of two claims which
have not yet been woYkcd. He states
i that there is plenty of work in Dawson
City and that he was steadily employed
there at a salary of $1 50 an hour.
Joseph Bird said: "I was up there In
Dawson a little over a year. Consider a
mnn stands just as good a chance to make
money there now as he did a year or
eighteen months ago. But it is an awfully
hard life and a man receives hard knocks
from the moment he leaves until ho re
turns."
J. D. Thomas formally in business at
Mount Vernon. has returned to San Fran
cisco after just a year"s absence. He left
a friend of his in charge of four claims
that he staked up In-Dawson. When he
left Dawson there were over eighty sick
men in the hospital. Most of them strong
men, who had been completely broken
down by exposure to the elements and
hardships they had undergone. "There
are dozens of mert up in Dawson," he said,
"who left good positions in the East to
try their luck; they have been unsuccess
ful in the Klondike and would be glad to
earn just enough money to return home.
Alex Macdonald is at present the Czar of
the Klondike. He went to Dawson two
years ago a poor man, but he is now the
richest man in the district; everything he
touches turns into gold."
J. T. Watson, a former resident of Port
land. Oregon, where his family at present
reside, returns after a three years' stay
in Alaska. "I think a young man," he
â aid, "who is in perfect health and will
take provisions with him for two or three
years is bound to make a success of it.
The trouble is a man at Dawson without
money is very badly off. There is no cred
it system up there at all; everything Is
cash. I believe if a San Francisco banker
was to go to Dawson he could not get
credit any more than anybody else. If
you have no money or provisions and can
not get work you are liable to starve up
there. I am afraid that there will be very
hard times in Dawson this winter.
H. H. Danah stated: "I left Dawson
June 2 and do not know when I shall re
turn. It is a ease of luck staking claims.
You cannot really estimate what your
claim will bring you until it is fully work
ed. No miners will bring down their gold
dust, but will deposit with some company
up north and receive a bill of exchange.
The price paid for gold dust at the time
I left was $15 an ounce.

BREEDERS' MEETING
GOES ON THIS WEEK
COMBINATION OF RUNNING AND
TROTTING WOULD DRAW.
A Good Card Offered To-Day and
Prospects of Great Racing.
Sonic Interesting Track
Notes.
It is much to be regretted that the out
look for harness races in California seems
so unfavorable this season.
Horsemen certainly are not appreciative
of the efforts of the Pacific Coast Breed
ers' Association to give high class meet
ings, and the public somehow cannot or
will not see the quality of the sport as
they view harness racing and compare It
with that which the runners afford.
If the horses which trot the grand cir
cuit could be attracted here, the people
would soon be led into a supporting
mood.
Were it possible to give combination
meetings, there is every indication that
I such an enterprise would Vie highly proflt
1 able, but where is the track in this neigh-
I borhood which the association could se
cure for that purpose. Neither of the two
I Jockey dubs, it may be taken for granted,
wouid be likely to grant the use of their
I property for such a purpose.
The attendance lately at Oakland has
; picked up, and a variation in the pro
: gramme by substituting some races at a
' mile and a half or two miles would at
tract the public.
The management was at first somewhat
of a drawback, but punctuality now rulea
; where forgetfulness of the clock was In
i vogue, and far better starts are secured
I with the limiting of scoring of 110 yards,
| aided by the barrier.
A few horsemen who have watched
i Zambro, 2:11, race and work are enthusi
j astlc enough to predict for him a record
| of 2:07 or 2:08, if nothing prevents him'
from trotting out the season, and his
owner lets him have the advantage of a
first-class track. He is grandly bred on
the dam's side, she by Almont
lightning, dam by Kentucky Clay, next
dam by Edwin Forrestâ all splendid
crosses. No wonder he is dead game ana
a natural trotter.
Little Thorn worked a quarter Friday
morning in 31 secondsâ a 2:04 clip.
Dick Abies, who used to be with Tom
Keating and started with "Knapsack"
McCarthy in the swipe capacity, is look
ing to get a string together to take East.
He is a good relnsman, for all good care
takers develop Into first-class drivers.
Dave McClary was swiping' Guinnette
three years ago, but has since then
brought to the wire the first two-minute
horse. Abies worked the big chestnut
pacer, Bernard, 2:17, a mile In 2:12 last
week, last quarter in 31 seconds. He has
only been in training three weeks, ana
looks to be good in his class.
Dexter I'rince seems to be having a
good season, as about everything out by
him has taken a lower record. If Mojave
would go one steady mile at his clip
it would be very near 2:12. and Aster can
shade 2:10 when he is right at himself.
What with Dexter Prince, McKinney and
Directum at hand breeders have oppor
tunities to breed some money winners.
Where is the horse to beat Rect. horse
men are. asking at the track. When they
step away from him at the half mile pole
they will just about go there in 1:05.
Ethel Downs ( and Mamie Griffin would
make a fairly good pole team. The mares
resemble one another quite a little.
Aster, 2:12-2. shares the trotting record
of the Oakland track now with Ethci
Downs. Singularly enough he was thu
contending horse when she trotted her
great heat here. He is a perfect gaitod
trottor with stride enough to warrant ex
treme speed expectations if he would stop
"lugging."
Inferno, 2:15, by Diablo, stopped a work
out at Plf-asanton in 2:13^.
If Resort could step a mile where he
can rate away a quarter for a sprint he
would be a seven day wonder. His vic
tory on Saturday puts Donathan In thÂ«
lead among his fellow reinsmen and train
ers.
The meeting will continue at least for
another week with every probability of
Its going the full twenty-four days as
originally contemplated. The entries for
to-riay promise pome great racing, es
pecially in the 2:13 trot.

NEED OF A CABLE
TO THE ISLANDS
Congressmen Urge the Providing of
Quick Communication With
Hawaii.
NEW YORK, July 10.â The Washington
correspondent of the Herald sends the
following: At the next session of Con
gress one of the first matters that de
mand attention will be the consideration
of the proposed submarine cable from
the United States to Hawaii. Several bills
to charter cable companies are now pend
ing before the Foreign Relations Committee
of the Senate and the Interstate and For
eign Commerce Committee of the House,
and efforts will be made to get one
through at the earliest moment.
These bills propose to give subsi
dies in one form or another, generally by
the Government guaranteeing the com
pany a certain amount each year for the
transmission of messages.
Senator Davis, chairman of the Foreign
Relations Committee, said to mo to-night:
"The question of cable communication
with Hawaii is one which must be taken
up at once. I suppose the best way to
procure the construction of a cable would
be by granting a charter to a private cot
poration rather than by having the Gov
ernment construct It as :i Government
line. The provision in one of the bills
before our committee that the Govern
ment should pay a certain guarantee was
favorably considered by the members of
the Foreign Relations Committee."
Senator Cullom of Illinois, who Is a
member of the same committee, and who
is chairman of the Commission of Fivw
appointed to recommend legislation re
garding the Hawaiian Islands, s;iid :
"The present situation has shown the
imperative necessity of a cable to Hawaii
which would eventually reach to the
Philippines, Japan and all the Orient.
Just how it is to be built is a matter
for Congress to determine. My recollec
tion is that the bill which our "committee
considered favorably proposed to have
the Government pay a certain amount an
nually for a fixed number of years, af
ter which the line was to revert to the
Government and become Government
property."

POPULISTS
ARE SPOILING
FOR A FIGHT
Delegates Hurry to Sacramento
Bristling With Individual
Ideas for Capturing the
State Convention.
There is a red cloud in the Populistic
sky, and it will produce a thunderstorm
when the convention meets in Sacra
mento to-day. The old contention of
fusion vs. middle-of-the-road is raging
as it raged two years ago this month
In St. Louis, and it will rage all the
more bitterly now because the old
wound has been reopened and the
vitriol of defeat and ingratitude has
been poured into the old sores.
The middle-of-the-road men earn'
within their ranks several who voted
for fusion in the national convention,
but who have been taught the bitter les
son of Democratic treachery and they
are angry and resentful. Their oppo
nents â chiefly disgruntled Democrats
masquerading as Populists â are blood
thirsty. With Maguire and Buckley,
they say that they control the Populist
party of this State, and that they pro
pose to retain their power, no matter
what the rank and file may think or
say.
The San Francisco delegates left yes
terday afternoon and they went in two
trains, one at 4 and the other at 6
o'clock. While waiting at the ferry the
factions did not display any of that
brotherly love which is so great a fad
with the People's party man. On the
other hand, they glowered and sniffed
at one another and gave the classy eya
and the marble heart to the opposi
tion. Some of them significantly
Whistled "There'll Come a Time Some
Day" when you won't be making hay,
or words to that effect, the aforesaid
hay representing the emoluments of
office.
Thomas V. Cator and Carleton John
son, two of the brightest and most en
ergetic workers in the party, were in
the throng, but they did not say much.
They had succeeded in taking a fall
out of the Buckley-Maguire combine
and they were sawing the wood of dis
cretion. Cator has a powerful follow
ing of friends who appreciate his abil
ity and his efforts in the cause.
T. W. H. Siianahan, the tall syca
more of Shasta, Assembly Dryden from
Ban Diego and Keegan of Santa Rosa
were the most conspicuous of the
group. Dryden is a great speaker, and
his record of twenty-two hours on the
Bilver question has never been equaled.
Keegan is not long-winded, but when
he gets warmed up and opens his
mouth there are thunderbolts in the
Bky.
They talked about the weather and
THE AKTt- RAZOR FAftTV WHO itAVE TODAY FOR SACRAfifNTO Â» â¢ â¢ â¢
everything but politics. Cator's talks
were of a confident'^l nature and not
to be heard by th^.jasser by or the
stander by, but his work is always ef
fective, for he has earned the reputa
tion of being a winner.
The gossip on the way Is that the
Buckley- Maguire-Gallagher combine
will force the fight for Maguire accord
ing to the old time bulldozing methods
of the ward primaries in which Buck
ley is the acknowledged master, and
that the convention will be bulldozed
into adopting gag law rules to be en
forced against the opposition and to
be tacitly suspended whenever a Buck
ley lamb desires to bleat. If there is
anything that a Populist hates and
despises more than anything else la the
world It is the tactics of the ward boss
in politics, but there is no escape with
out a fight, for, as a Buckley lamb at
the ferry expressed it, "The middle-of
the-roads are up against it."
The fight against the Thugs, how
ever, is being well organized, and when
the curtain rises on the convention
there will be several dramatic situa
tions not at all to the liking of the
Democratic clique, the members of
which have cast themselves for star
parts in the play.
The Blue and the
Gray.
The Rev. C. E. Locke at the Central
Methodist Church lectured last night on
the happy combination of thÂ»- blue and
the gray In the present struggle against
Spain.
"There is but one color now," said tho
preacher, "and this Is the blue of the
United States, blended with the red
white and blue in Old Glory. No North'
no South, no East, no West, but one
united people, ready and willing to fight
and die for one countryâ their own coun
try, one of the greatest and grandest on
earth.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. MONDAY, JULY 11, 1898.
REUNITED
BY THE WAR
TWO soldiers, one from Tennessee, one from lowa, clasped hands,
and said no word. Into the eyes of each there came tears. There
was much to say, but they were silent for a time, for there are
moments when heart communes with heart. These men were
brothers. They had supposed each that the other was dead. At
last they had met. The Fortune of War, touched by kindly caprice, had
thrown them together.
Tears ago in Burlington, lowa, there was a happy family, by name
Rohledar. Five boys and two girls had come to the household, and
there was prosperity and happiness. Between two of the boys there was
an affection peculiarly strong. As lads they were inseparable. But
reverses came, poverty invaded the home, death laid its hand on the
head of the house, and the boys were sent into the world to provide for
themselves. The two, Julius and Charles drifted apart. One started
for the West, the other sought the East. To neither was the strug
gle of life easy. Faithfully they strove, and yet the willing efforts
were not crowned with success. Then they lost trace of each other,
and not hearing, concluded that nothing but death could have come to
divide them. Each believed the other had been called away.
There was heard the summons to war and the brothers answered.
Charles came down from the mountains of Tennessee to enlist, and
joined the First of that State. Julius was mustered in at Creston,
lowa, and Joined the Fifty-first. Neither knew where his regiment was
going. They had visions of Cuba, but both regiments were ordered to
this city on the way to the Philippines. They have been here for
weeks, receiving their equipment, becoming perfected in the manual of
arms, being made into soldiers.
The long drill was over. Just as the sun was setting, and the hills
of the Presidio were glowing to his farewell touch, the various regi
ments started to march back to camp. The Fifty-first lowa had halt
ed for a space. As its ranks stood motionless, the First Tennessee
swept by, and the guns of the lowans came to a "present." The men
viewed their passing comrades at arms with passive interest. They
were tired with the burden of the day. Yet they looked on, perhaps to
compare the military bearing of the Southerners with their own.
From a man in Company B of the Fifty-first came a sharp cry,
"Julius!" No discipline could have kept It back. A look from a Ten
nesseean, who could not pause, and there was an answering cry,
"Charles!" Across the lapse of years brother had remembered brother!
and as their eyes met there was in each the light of the old affection!
That was all. Tennessee kept on. As the sunset gun boomed, there
was the order, "Forward, march," and lowa followed. But the soldiers
nearby, although they could not talk then, knew that into the wind
swept drill ground had come a color of romance. In the quick ex
change of glances, the involuntary cry and the response, they knew
there was a story.
When ranks were broken the men sought each other. "When they
met they clasped hands, two sun- burned toil-hardened hands. Thus
clasped in fervent pressure they gazed at each other. They saw the
changes time had wrought. Boys they had parted, soldiers they met,
but they were brothers still. What they said when first emotions had
permitted them to have voice, how they rehearsed the days of youth,
how they wondered that at last they had been united, all this concerns
them, and not the outsider, even though sympathy had been touched,
and the beauty of the incident appealed to human instinct. For blood
is thicker than water, and these are of one blood.
But doubtless under the tents of Camp Merritt there is more Joy
than before the meeting, and with new zest, two gallant soldiers will go
forth to battle.
HIS BLOW MAY
PROVE FATAL
Grace Rodgers Dying
From a Beating .
RESULT OF A QUARREL
CHARLES SCOTT, HER ASSAIL
ANT, UNDER ARREST.
Her Left Side Is Paralyzed and She
Is Unable to Speak â the
Name of the Accused
Han.
Grace Rodgers, a prepossessing young
woman, who Is said to be well connected,
1b dying from the effects of a blow which
she received on the evening of July 4 at
the hands of Charles Scott, who is said
to be her lover.
The pair, so it is claimed, had a trivial
dispute in front of an O'Farrell-street
resort, which culminated in Scott strik
ing hfs helpless victim a terrific blow in
the neck. The unfortunate woman stag
gered as If badly hurt," and finally fell
unconscious to the sidewalk. Scott, evi
dently realizing that she was seriously
injured, took to his heels and disap
peared.
Several' bystanders, on learning where
the woman lived, took her to her room.
The landlady at once summoned a doctor,
who discovered that her left side wat,
paralyzed, presumably from the effects
of the blow. She was unable to speak,
and It was with difficulty that she man
aged to write the name of her brutal
assailant on a strip of paper. Yesterday
her condition became worse, and hei
friends decided to notify the police.
Several officers were immediately de
tailed to find Scott, but it was not until
last night that he was caught. He was
located by Special Officer Huey Smith in
a saloon on O'Farrell street, and sent to
the California-street station, where his
name was registered on the detinue book.
Scott, it is understood, positively denies
that he struck the Rodgefs woman. He
claims that she fell down, her head strik
ing against the pavement, causing paraly
sis of the side.
Notwithstanding his protestation of in
nocence the police say they have several
witnesses who saw Scott strike the un
fortunate victim.
Last night it was reported to the police
that the woman was in a serious condi
tion and likely to die.
Scott will be held pending the result
of her injuries.
Christian Commission Meeting.
The Christian Qommission will hold a
mass meeting to-night at the association
building. Mason and Ellis street, at which
time brief reports of their work will be
presented by Mrs. C. S. Wright, presi
dent of the Mothers' Club, and the Chris
tian Commission work in general. There
will be special music by the Columbian
Orchestra, Knickerbocker Quartet and
addresses by Rev. Dr. Dillo and others.
The public is Invited.
DRIVEN MAD
BY CRUELTY
Pitiable Condition of
Mary Vanier.
BECAME A RAVING MANIAC
THREATENED BY HER HUSBAND
SHE LOSES HER MIND.
Kind Neighbors Interfereâ She and
Her Two Small Children Taken
in Charge by the
Police.
Mary Vanlcr, an attractive middle-aged
woman, is locked up in a padded cell In
the Receiving Hospital, a hopeless
maniac. Yesterday it was found neces
sary to place her in a straitjacket, as the
hospital attendants feared that she
would injure herself.
Some time ago the unfortunate
woman's husband was arrested for
cruelty to his five-year-old girl, and on
conviction was sent to the Branch County
Jail for six months. He was discharged
on July B and at once proceeded to get
drunk. Returning to his former home he
attempted to enter, but was denied ad
mittance by his wife. With an oath he
picked up an ax which he found in the
rear yard and started to chop down the
door. Becoming alarmed for her safety
Mrs. Vanier hid in a closet, hoping to
elude her angry husband. After gaining
an entrance Vanier searched the house,
but failed to find his wife. Evldentv de
termined to locate her, Vanier at once
went to a house on Octavia street where
his eldest daughter is employed as a
nursegirl. He appealed to her to find her
mother, as he wanted to see her on im
portant business, as he expressed it. Re
alizing that he was under the influence of
liquor, the girl refused to have anything
to do with him and had him ejected from
the houÃe.
Last Saturday night the sergeant at the
North End Station was Informed by a cit
izen that he feared something had hap
pened to Mrs. Vanier. as she had not been
seen for several days. The unfortunate
woman lived in a humble cottage on
Broadway, near Van Ness avenue, and
the neighbors, not seeing her, induced one
of their number to notify the police, as
they feared that she had met with foul
Play.
Several police officers were immediately
dispatched to the scene, and after con
siderable trouble they managed to force
an entrance to the house.
Kneeling on the bare floor, with her two
children locked in her embrace, and be
seeching the Almighty to save her from
the wrath of her husband, was Mrs. Van
ier, a raving maniac. She paid no atten
tion to the officers as they entered, but
continued her supplication, apparently
oblivious of their presence.
Touched by the fervor of her religious
invocation, the officers at first hesitated
to arrest her, but realizing that she might
Injure herself or her children they de
cicied to take her into custody. The un
fortunate woman offered no objection
when one of tnem placed his hand on her
arm and informed her that she was under
arrest. She was at once taken to the in
sane ward of the Receiving Hospital and
placed in a padded cell. A short time af- j
terward she became violently insane, and |
It was found necessary to strap her down.
Yesterday afternoon Officer McMurray
of the Society for the Prevention of Cru
elty to Children took charge of two of her I
offspring and booked them for some public
institution. They are Leland, aged 5
years, and CoIHb, aged 3 years. The po
lice claim that Vanier's threatening atti
tuda drove his wlfa insana- |
SNOW FALL
TOO LIGHT
The Northern California
Mines Shut Down.
ONLY A TWENTY DAYS' RUN
BIG NUGGETS BUT A SCARCITY
OF 'W-.TER.
Shortest Season in the History of
the State â Famous Old Mines
Are Being Beopened and
Developed.
For the first time in the history of
placer mining in the State the miners of
the northern counties have been com
pelled by the lack of water to close down
at this early date and await the time to
begin operations next spring. Several
well-known mining men have arrived in
San Francisco to dispose of their gold,
among the first being F. M. Spencer and
Daniel Doherty of Gibsonville and J. J.
Coughlin of Donnerville. They bring very
unsatisfactory reports of the results of
this season's work, but state that it is
not the fault of the mines.
"We struck a bad year," said Mr. Spen
cer, yesterday, "and it was all due to the
remarkable light snowfall. In the aver
age season we pet fifteen feet of snow in
Plumas and Sierra counties, but this year
there was only a fall of three feet. As a
consequence, we had hardly got our mines
in good working order before we had to
close down for lack of water. Usually we
have from eighty to ninety days to wash
gravel, but this year we could only ope
rate twenty days. There are six well
known hydraulic mines in our section,
that yield as handsome, coarse gold as
can be found anywhere. The dust I have
just sold to the smelting works would
have made as fine a display in the matter
of size of nuggets as the average of any
lot that has come from the famous Klon
dyke. The large nuggets ran from one
dollar to sixty and seventy dollars a
piece. We got our share of them while
the water lasted, and hope to have an
extra long run next year. On account of
the usual heavy snowfall the mines can't
be reached from the outside before June
1, and those who want to spend the win
ter in the outer world must leave by De
cember 1, unless they can travel on snow
shoes.
"In our section, the output for the sea
son has been only about one-quarter of
the average yield. The mining regions
farther to the south, where they have
ditches from fifty to seventy mile* long
and facilities for preventing the water
from going to waste, will fare better than
we have and ought to be able to make
a good run.
"Capital is beginning to recognize the
value of the mines in Sierra and Placer
counties, as shown by the fact that the
famous Thistle mine, about two miles
from Gibsonville, is being worked by a
Scotch syndicate which is developing a
great gravel deposit and now has a shaft
down 500 feet working in good ground.
The Gold Bluff mine which was once a
great producer, but was abandoned by
reason of bad management, has been bond
ed by two New York capitalists, who are
pumping out the old shaft and will sink
on the same ledge in the hope of strik
ing another lead. They are almost cer
tain to win. At the Mountain quartz
mine, which has been idle for some time,
Eastern capitalists will begin with a
large force and operate a 40-stamp mill.
The Pilot Peak gravel mine starts up
with a good shift. It has been bonded by
Plumas Turner, the well-known mining
man; and at the Allegheny and Forest
City mines preparations are being made
for extensive operations."
"There is a large field in our section
that has never been prospected," said Mr.
Coughlin, "and I intend to start on a
long prospecting trip shortly. Capital
ists that are overlooking that region are
making a mistake, for money is all that |
is needed to develop some fine mines."
SPORT IN SHELL AND
SKIFF AT EL CAMPO
THE SPECIAL MATCH RACE ENDS
IN A WALKOVER.
Pape Wins the Senior Outrigged
Skiff Event From Four Com
petitors in Very Good
Time.
The skiff and shell races postponed from
June 26th on account of the rough water
took place yesterday at El Campoâ that
Is, some of, them did. But the most inter
esting event, that in which the public at
tention was centered, the special match
race between A. \V. Pape, of the Dolphins,
and William McCausland of the Ariels,
resulted in a walk-over, much to the dis
appointment of a large number of specta
tors. The day was brilliant and, though
a moderate breeze was blowing, it did
not seriously incommode the scullers.
The Pape-McCausland race was set
down for 1 o'clock, and a few minutes af
ter that hour Pape was ready at the start
ing-line, but McCausland, though he had
come over by the 10:30 boat, was not ready
to row and was disappointed in getting
sculls belonging to Patch, who wanted
them himself in the Senior outrigged skiff
race, and did not feel disposed to lend
them for an earlier event. No suitable
pair being obtainable, McCausland desir
ed the Regatta Committee to postpone the
match till after the Senior skiff race, but
Pape. who wished to pull in that event,
was not ready to consent to this. So the
Regatta Committee determined to adhere
to the schedule, and Pape was sent over
the course, making the very good time of
13 minutes and 8 seconds.
The Senior shell race, for which H.
Witkopf of the Ariels and J. W. Lynn
of the Stockton Athletic Club were en
tered, resulted in another disappointment,
the Stockton man not being on the spot.
So Wlttkoff rowed over the course by
himself: time, 14 minutes and 50 seconds, j

The third event produced the first race
of the day. Victor Caglieri of the Dol
phins was the only one of the three com
petitors in the first heat of the Junior
outrigged skiffs on June 26 who kept his
boat from swamping and went over the
course. In the second heat C. Ochs of the
Pioneers and William Howe of the Ariels
took first and second plaoe. In the final
heat, rowed yesterday, C. Ochs had the
outside station. Caglieri the middle and
Howe the inside. Up to the stake-boat
Ochs was in the lead, followed by Cag
lieri and Howe. After rounding the stake
boat the same order was kept, and Ochs
came home an easy winner. Time. 13
minutes 31 seconds. Caglieri's time was
13 minutes and 52 seconds. Howe did not
finish.
For tue fourth and last event, the Sen
ior outrigged skiff race, five competitors
presented themselves: A. W. Pape and
W. O. Patch of the Dolphins. F. Avers
and Chester Ayers of the Alamerlas and
H. Wittkopf of the Ariels. Pape had the
inside station, Wittkopf the next. Patch
the center, F. Ayers the next and C.
Avers the outside.
Pape went off at a very quick stroke
and took the lead, followed by F. Ayers.
After the turn Pape was still in the lead,
followed by the Ayers brothers. Pape
won as he liked by six lengths, followed
hv F. Ayers, C. Ayers, W. O. Patch and
H A Wittkopf in the order named.
Pape's time was 13 minutes 1 second; F.
Ayers', 13 minutes 18 seconds; C. Ayers',
13minutes and 26 seconds: W. O. Patch's,
13 minutes and 38 seconds: H. A. Witt
kopf's, 13 minutes and 50 seconds. The
course was one and a half miles, with a
turn: a moderate breeze and fairly
smooth water.
The bar<re races will take place at El
Campo on Sunday, July 24, and should
produce some good sport.

ChargÂ«d With Burglary.
William Baker, a saddler, and a friend
got into a state of intoxication early yes
terday morning and made their way into
the kitchen of 26 Chesley street, occupied
by John Censlus. He was awakened by
the noise and notified Policeman Murphy.
When Murphy reached the house the two
intruders were asleep on the floor, and
when he roused them up Baker's friend
escaped. Baker was in a fighting humor
and had to be clubbed into submission
After two scalp wounds had been stitched
and dressed at the Receiving Hospital he
was taken to the City Prison, where a
charge of burglary was booked against
him.
