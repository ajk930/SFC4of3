PARIS, Oct. 2. â There was a decided
ly ugly spirit abroad here to-day. Re- <
visionists and anti-revisionists seemed
to be spoiling for a fight- Captain i
Dreyfus, whether guilty or Innocent, I
has certainly caused a veritable cyclone
of passion to be let loose.
Paris has been in turmoil all day. ;
Crowds, scuffles, uproar and arrests j
form the programme of the last twelve
hours. At this moment a mounted Re
publican guard is patrolling certain
parts of the city, and all of the police
force is on the alert. About a score of
persons are said to have been seriously j
wounded in various free fights that
have broken the monotony of the Pa
risian Sunday.
In one quarter alcme over forty ar
rests have been made. Of these thir
teen have been kept and the others lib
erated! Among the latter is M. Francis
de Pressense, one of the first authorities
on foreign politics in France and the
leader writer of the Temps. "With him
were arrested M. Ernest Vaughan, di
rector of the Aurore, and M. Morhardt,
another of the Temps editorial staff. 1
All three were to have addressed a j
meeting In favor of revision in the
Dreyfus case. This manifestation was
announced to be held in the Salle Wag
ram.
When M. de Pressense and his col
leagues arrived at the meeting place
they found it shut up and surrounded
by a strong cordon of police busily en
gaged in keeping back a crowd various
ly estimated as numbering from twelve
to twenty, thousand persons. .â
In spite of the protests of M. de Pres
sense's party, who had paid the rent of
the hall, the police refused admittance
to any one. Arguments and expostula
tions were both unavailing, as the Brig- .
adier of Police remained inexorable.
The crowd, however, had grown im
patient or bolder, for it finally broke
through the ring of police. From crush- j
ing to giving blows was but a step, and
many took it.
Cries of "Vive la LJberte" and "Vive
]a Revision," were met by counter yells |
of "Vive l'Armee" and "A bas les
Trait:
At once the fight became general. The
police made a charge and drove the
crowd back to the Place dcs Ternes.
Another immense body of people was
there already crying "Vive Zola" and
"Vive la Revision."
Thus reinforced the human torrent
surged back up the Avenue Wagram.
Another charge of the police repulsed it
In disorder. Blows were freely ex
changed. Blood flowed In abundance
from noses and cracked crowns. Fu
â¢ rious epithets were hurled about, and '
In the middle of the riot the three or- j
ganizers of the meeting were arrested. ;
All over the city entirely irre- i
sponsible and totally impartial groups
of individuals are marching about. j
When one band meets another there is j
a conflict of cries, "Vive la Revision" i
warring with 'Vive l'Armee." Then I
sticks fly about wildly, and the least
offensive-looking person handy has a
bad time for a few minutes. Anti-Sem
itism naturally made itself noisily evi
dent; in fact, there are few things or
institutions that have not been howled
down or lauded with frenzy to-day.
The editorial rooms of Libre Parole,
M. Drumont's paper; the Intransig-eant,
M. Rochefort'a organ, and same other
Journals are being guarded by strong

NO ORDER WAS GIVEN BY
SHAFTER TO FALL BACK
General Wheeler Makes a Statement
About the Charge Up San
Juan Kidge.
NEW YORK, Oct. 2.â The Washinp-ton
correspondent of the Herald fnyp: I asked
General Wheeler to-night If the state
ment was true, as reported to have been
made by a captain of the Rough Riders
in St. Louis, that he had ordered the
charge up San Juan ifill in face of an
order from General Shatter to fall back.
In reply General Wheeler wrote this
Btatern- ni . "There was co order given by
General Shafter to fall back from San
Juan Ridge. The first order to me vu t<>
move forward Kent's division and the
cavalr . which I obeyed. The or
der probably referred to was one given
by Colonel McClefnand of General dhaf
ter's staff before the movement upon tan
Juan Ridge took place. This order gave
Borne discretion regarding this movement,
but did not say anything about falling
back. I read ....is order in General Sum
nere presence and then carried it to Gen
eral Kent."

To which Admiral Dewey lately dispatched the captured gunboats, Calloa and Leyte, manned by Americans, for the purpose
of asserting his authority, and protecting the inhabitants from the insurgents. Iloilo is situated on the
southeast side of Paney Island, on a long, narrow strait, which separates it from Guimaras Island. It is the
second city in size in the Philippines, having between 35,000 and 40,000 people, and exports large quantities

MAD DEED OF A
PITTSBURG GIRL
Kills Her Mother While
Sleeping.
MORTALLY WOUNDS HERSELF
TIRED OF LIFE AND WANTED TO
DIE.
But Did Not Wish the Mother to Live
and Fret Over Her Fate, So She
Concluded to Kill
Her.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PITTSBURG, Oct. 2.â Bertha Beil
stein killed her mother to-day and later
put four bullets into her own body,
from the effects of which she cannot
recover.
The only explanation the girl has
given for her terrible deed was in these
words: "I was tired of life; it held no
pleasure for me. I wanted to die and
did not want my mother to live and fret
over my death. For that reason I killed
her."
The crime, which was committed
some time in the early morning, was
was not discovered until late in the
day, when a son of the murdered
woman came to the house and found
the mother's body in her room cold in
death. The bed was covered with blood
and there was every indication that
death had ensued some hours before.
In an adjoining room was found the
body of the murderess, lying in a pool
of blood, and In her right hand was
clutched a revolver.
Mrs. Beilstein had been shot three
times. One shot had entered at the right
side of the nose, taken a downward
course through the neck and had cut
the seventh cervicle vertebrae. Another
shot had entered the right breast and
the third had passed through the right
groin.
A bullet had torn Its way through the
young woman's riprht temple and had
passed out at the top of the head.
From both the entrance and exit of the
wound the brains were oozing. Another
bullet had entered her left breast near
the heart and she had shot herself twice
in the stomach. Her death is a ques
tion of only a short time.
During a period of consciousness she

told of the murder. She said she went
into the room with the revolver in her
hand. She had decided to kill herself,
and knowing what the shock to her
mother would be concluded that death
to her would be preferable to sufferings
on earth. Her mother, she said, was
sleeping when she went into the room.
She placed the revolver ciose to her
breast and fired. On the report of the
pistol her mother sat up in bed and
said to her:
"Birdie, what are you doing?"
The answer was another shot, which,
she says, was fired at her mother's
face. This was evidently the shot
which entered Mrs. Beilstein's brain
and resulted in her instant death, one
more wound was inflicted afterward.
Frederick Beilstein, the father, was
one of the best-known residents of Al
legheny. He died suddenly in December
last. Since then Birdie, who was twenty
years of age, has been depressed, and
it is believed she was temporarily in
j sane. ,

Cruiser Raleigh Goes to Northwest

Natives.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MANILA, Oct. 2.â The National As
sembly at Malolos, at a recent sitting,
voted Aguinaldo a civil list of $75,000,
but Aguinaldo declined to receive any
thing until the army should have been
paid. An attempt was made by Pa
lerno, the Speaker of the Ho-use, to
have inserted a clause granting him an
allowance because of his office but the
! proposal was rejected. The Assembly
is now engaged in discussing the con
stitution.
The Spanish community is telegraph
ing to Madrid in an endeavor to secure
the enforcement of the release of pris
oners. Personal investigations made in
the provinces emphasize the determina
tion of the insurgents to obtain a spe
cific guarantee of favorable terms be
fore releasing the prisoners now in their
hands, and it is certain that they will
never cheaply relinquish their dearly
bought conquests.
Everywhere is seen evidences of ap
palling struggles. Popular opinion fa
vors autonomy, which it is generally
expected will be established. The peo
ple rather distrust the Americans, who,
beginning to realize this fact, sent the
cruiser Raleigh to the northwestern
ports for the purpose of showing the
American flag and making friends with
the natives. The cruiser's officers en
deavored to arrange an interchange of
hospitalities, but the natives at first
were unwilling to visit the ship unless
hostages were landed. However, friend
ly feeling was established and the na
tives were agreeably surprised at the
American attitude.
A sanitary board, with an American
at Its head, has been established here.
A corps of physicians are superintend
ing sanitary work in all the districts of
the city and vicinity.
AGUINALDO MAY BE
DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH
NEW YORK, Oct. 2.â A special cable |
to the World from Marseilles says that j
General Merritt, who arrived there to
day on his way to Paris, referring to
Aguinaldo, said: "He may be difficult
to deal with unless his advisers use
their influence discreetly."
"Does Admiral Dewey share your
views of Aguinaldo?"
"I cannot speak for Admiral Dewey.
I express my own opinions only,
though I have no reason to suppose
that the admiral would disapprove of
what I have said."
"Do you consider the insurgents fit
for self-erovernment?"
"I doubt it under the present condi
tions. Permanent forces in the Philip
pines must be relied upon to support a
stable government.^'
NINETY-FOUR INSURGENTS

says that the Tagels have landed in the
Antiga province and have been com
pletely defeated by the Spanish column
after a sharp fight in which ninety
four of the insurgents were killed.
GREAT EXPECTATIONS
OF THE MADRID PRESS
Affect to Believe the United States
Will Make All Sorts of
Concessions.
MADRID, Oct. 2.â The conciliatory and
cordial spirit shown by the delegates to
the Paris conference has produced a fa
vorable impression. The newspapers af
fect to believe that the United States, be
sides respecting Spain in the Philippines,
will also allow Spain to have a share in
the settlement of the new regime in Cuba,
Inspired articles assert that Spain will
undertake to carry out the promised
guarantee of the Cuban debts only until
Cuba herself is able to pay the interest
and sinking fund.
A dispatch to the Imparclal from Paris
declares that both the Spanish and
American commissions have been in
structed to act ad referendum.

â  Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON. Oct. 2.â A terrific whirl
wind moving in the form of a funnel
shaped cloud swept a path from sixty
to one hundred feet wide just north of
the city at noon to-day. It was a small
and decidedly lively chunk of the genu
ine Kansas cyclone, and its movements
were in every particular like the terrors
of the Mississippi Valley. It was ac- i
companied by peals of thunder and fol
lowed by a heavy rain. The swiftly re
volving wind tore along in a north and
easterly direction, sweeping houses,
barns, outbuildings, fences and even
animals from its path. Strange to re
late, so far as known, not one human
being was injured.
The cyclone came from the northwest
and traveled southeast until just north
and east of the city, when it took a
more southerly course. It advanced at
a deliberate speed estimated by wit
nesses to not be over six or seven miles
an hour. It seemed to bound from the
earth and then, returning, snatch up
whatever it chanced to alight upon and
tear it to pieces.
The men at Henry Armbrust's winery
who happened to be in the vineyard
saw the funnel-shaped cloud approach
ing and heard the roaring sound accom
panying it long before it reached their
place. It swooped down into a field,
tore up clods, turf and sticks, bounded
over the rural cemetery without touch
ing it and descended on the winery
buildings. The roof of the packing
house, a large sheetiron area weighing
many tons, was lifted as a piece of pa
per >i?id torn and twisted. A Â»traw stack
protected by a shed was lifted, covering
and all, and scattered like dust. A
coop containing a lot of chickens was
carried bodily away and neither the
fowls nor the cage have been found.
A horse standing in the corral was
lifted from the ground and thrown over
the fence, landing against a shed which
had escaped destruction.
After these antics the cyclone seemed
to split in twain. One part passed
south of Armbrust's place, and the
other further to the east. The latter
seemed to be as furious as the original
zephyr. It struck the corner of the
Armbrust dwelling, carried away the
porch and tore out the corner of the
building. The two sections of the whirl
wind then slowly converged, combining
again at the Gambetta place.
Here the damage was great. The
house was literally torn to kindling
wood. No two boards were left nailed
together. The outbuildings were left
untouched.
At the Young place, a mile south of
Gambetta's a patch 100 feet in width
was mowed through the peach orchard.
The trees were torn up by the roo-ts and
twisted to pieces in the air. A section
of the fence was taken out and depos
ited in a large oak tree, a half-mile
away. The wind jumped from the
Young place, a distance of nearly a
mile. It again struck in a field and
passed on into the open country, nar
rowly missing Collegeville.
At Simon Moore's, immediately north
of here, shingles were ripped from the
barn roof and crates and boxes were
scattered all over an adjoining vine
yard.
At Philip Broschi's a new 22-foot
wlr'imill was ruined, and buildings
damaged. Loss, $400.
At Adams' dairy a barn was demol
ished and trees uprooted.
The tornado passed through Fair
Oaks, an eastern addition, where roofs
and windows suffered greatly.
Succumbs to Chloroform.
CHINO, Oct. 2.â Elmer Hewlett, an en
gineer on' the Chino road, died this after
noon from the effects of chloroform
which had been given him preparatory to
performing an operation on his foot. It
is thought the chloroform affected his
heart and caused his death as he was
in an apparently healthy condition before
it was administered, with the exception
of an ulcerated toe, which threatened
blood poisoning.

HEAVY LOSS OF LIFE FEARED
COUNTRY SUBMERGED AROUND
SAVANNAH.
It Is Probable That Many Persona
Perished in Small Islands
Adjacent to the Main
and.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAVANNAH, Ga., Oct. 2.â For four
teen hours, from 3 o'clock this morning
until 6 o'clock to-night, Savannah has
been in the grasp of a West Indian tor
nado. During that time the wind blew
steadily from fifty to seventy miles an
hour. While the city escaped with
comparatively little damage the loss
of property among the sea islands of
the Georgia and South Carolina coast
is believed to be very heavy.
Only one fatality has so far been re
ported â the drowning of a negro while
attempting to reach the land from . a
small island near Thunderbolt â but
heavy loss of life is feared on the South
Carolina sea islands, where such fear
ful loss of life occurred during the great
tidal storm of 1893. Tne conditions now
are similar to those during that storm.
Owing to the submerged country and
the isolated location of the islands no
news can be had from them until the
water subsides.
For miles north of Savannah the en
tire country is submerged. At noon the
water was eight feet above the high
est tide. Driven on shore by the north
east storm, it filled up on the islands,
swept over banks and dams, carrying
away the remnant of the rice crop that
was left by the August storm and had
not been gathered, and will destroy
crops.
The loss to rice growers alone will be
from $50,000 to $75,000. The rice crops
along the Savannah River, valued at
$100,000, were lost in this storm.
The damage to shipping is consider
able. The schooner Governor Ames,
which was on her way to sea with a
cargo of 1,500,000 feet of lumber, went
adrift in the harbor, but was secured
safely. The wharves at the quarantine
station at the entrance to the river har
bor were partially carried away. â¢
Four vessels which were at anchor at
the station were torn from their moor
ings and driven into the marshes.
Three of these were the British
schooner Syanara, bound for St. John,
N. B. ; the American schooner MillevillÂ«^
for Milleville, N. J.; the Fanny L.
Child, for Boston, all lumber laden, and
the Italian bark Franklin. How badly
these vessels are damaged is unknown.
No news has been received from
Tybee since early in the morning and
nothing is known of the damage there.
In some suburbs of Savannah all the
boat houses on the banks and hundreds
of small boats were carried away.
The extent to which the railways
suffered is not fully known. The naval
stores and cotton and lumber yards of
the Plant system are submerged and
the tracks of the Central Railroad of
Georgia and the Georgia and Alabama
Railroad around the city are covered..
The north bound express on the F. C.
and P. R. R-, due here from Florida at
noon, has not yet arrived. Telegraph
wires are down and the condition of the
railroad tracks is unknown. The tele
phone, police, light and fire alarm wires
are down and the city is in darkness.
On Hutchinson's Island, opposite Sa
vannah and separating the city from
the South Carolina shore, there were
many negro families rescued by boats
from the revenue steamers Tybee and
Boutwell. One man with a child in his â 
arms, started to cross the dam with the
water up to his body. His wife, with
another child, stood in the window of
their house, the floor of which was al
ready flooded by the rising water, and
watched her husband feel his way, step
by step along the top of the treacher
ous dam, one false step from which,
or a caving bank, would throw him into
a swiftly moving current. Finally he
was sighted from across the river on
the city side. A boat was put in and
after a half hour's effort the man .was
rescued.
Upward of a hundred people were
brought from the island to the ctiy
in boats. To-night the wind has sub
sided but the water, which receded
with the ebb of the tide during the aft
ernoon, has again risen.
Considerable anxiety is felt for ship
ping at sea. The steamer Nacoochee,
for New York, and the steamer D. H.
Miller, for Baltimore, went to sea Sat
urday night. The City of Macon was
due this morning from New York, but
has not yet arrived, and the City of Au
gusta sailed from New York on Friday
and was due here to-night.
Until telegraphic communication is
restored or news is received from the
country between Savannah and Jack
sonville over which the heaviest part of
the storm passed, the full extent of the
damage cannot be told. ' - ,m]â  .-
CHARLESTON S. C, Oct. Much
alarm was occasioned here to-day by
the hoisting of cyclone flags by the
weather bureau. It was feared at one
time that much damage would be done,
but such was not the case. During the
day the wind reached a velocity of six
ty-two 1 miles and over. Streets in the
city were submerged. All the ships in
the harbor sought safe anchorage. It
is feared that much damage" to rice has
been done. No casualties have been 're
ported here.

PRUSSIAN MINISTER'S
BLOODTHIRSTY ORDER j
Police Must Use the Edge Instead of \
the Flat of Their Swords to
Disperse Rioters.
BERLIN, Oct. 3.â The Vorwaerts pub
lishes an order issued by the Prussian
Minister to the Governor of Eurfurt,
complaining- of the leniency shown by the
police in the recent election disturbances,
and enjoining the police in future to act
resolutely, using the edges and not the
flat of their swords if rioters refuse to
disperse. This order is believed to be
directed against the socialists and is likely
to cause a sensation.

Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
RICE LAKE, Wis., Oct. 2.â ln the
burned district officers of the different
! towns have had crews of men burying
| and burning the dead animals to-day.
In the territory between this city and
Barron and Cumberland, in every in
stance where homes were destroyed,
nothing was sa\ d people barely es
caping with their lives. Many people
saved themselves by taking refuge in
their wells.
A meeting was, held at the opera
house to-night #nd committees were
appointed to raise funds and disburse
them. Those that have not shelter
will be brought to this city.
Adjutant General Bordman and For
est Warden Wyman, the Governor's
representatives, who were here to-day,
say the desolation is fully as bad as re
ported. As far as known only three
deaths have been reported, but many
have received severe injuries.
CUMBERLAND, Wis.. Oct. News
of another death from forest fires
comes from the town of Clinton, in this
county, to-night. A boy was found
dead on the bank of the Yellow River
with his feet in the water. His feet
were badly burned, and the appearance
indicated that he had sought the river
for safety.
The State relief party has listed sev
enty- three destitute families in Turtle
Lake, forty-two in Cumberland, forty
In Stamford and Rice Lake, thirty in
Clinton and Barron and nineteen fam
ilies in Cumberland, all of which need
immediate assistance. Supplies will be
forwarded immediately to these points.
The danger is now mostly past,
though it is unsafe to travel through
some of the fire districts in the vicinity
of Cumbreland.
The property loss in this county will
aggregate $400,000 besides the farm
buildings and crops. A large amount
of stock has been burned and much
hardwood lumber destroyed. A crew
of men were enp^ed to-day burning
the. debris of animals in the district
south of here.
DENVER, Oct. 2.â Snow and rain
have checker! the progress of the for
est fires on the main range In Colorado,
and it is now thought that further de
struction of timber is prevented. At
least all danger to the threatened
towns is over. The temperature here
has fallen perceptibly and dispatches
from the mountain towns indicate a
similar fortunate change. At -resent
nothing like a correct estimate of the
damage done can be given and it will
be days before an accurate . statement
of the losses by the fires that have been
raging for a week or more can be made.
A special to the News from Colorado
Springs pays that great clouds of smoke
have hung over the mountains south of
Pikes Peake and fierce flames have
been seen to shoot up frequently. It is
reported that Immense forest fires are
raging on the range, and that they are
gradually working their way to Crip
ple Creek. It is believed that the hent
from these fires caused the high winds
here during yesterday's fire, which
formed such a strong opposing force
against the efforts of those who were
fighting the flames.
COLORED MINERS
DRIVEN FROM TOWN

of a Mob of Masked
Men.
CINCINNATI. Oct. 2.â The Commercial-
Tribune's special from Washington. Ind.,
says: Thi.- city is in a great state of ex
citement to-night. A hundred and fifty
coal miners from Pana, 111., came here
this afternoon and met at the fair
grounds with the Home Union miners and
organized. At 10 o'clock to-nipht they got
together and, masked, visited all the
shucks whore the colored coal miners
lived. About fifty of the n<'Kroes were
corralled and at the points of pistols were
driven out of town. One negro refused to
go and the- miners fired on him. He has
not been found and may have been killed.
The police could do nothing. One brave
?>oliceman, Anderson Cannon, went up to
he whole mob and demanded nf them to
disperse. They answered by leveling their
pistols at him.
The masked miners took the town.
Chief of Police Call turned in the fire
alarm and called out the citizens to as
sist in keeping the peace. Several are
deputized and If another outbreak occurs
much bloodshed Is liable to result. At
this hour the street! are crowded with
people. The masked men have hidden
themselves, possibly to make an attack
on other negro shacks. There are pos
sibly fifty negroes who declare that they
will die before they leave town.

VERY INTERESTING DETAILS
VALOB OF A FIRING LINE OF

Conspicuous Gallantry of a Number

Good Work.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 2.â The report of
Major General F. V. Greene, who cora-
i manded the Second Brigade, Second Dl
j vision of the Eighth Array Corps, at
Manila, at the time of the battle there
on the 13th of August last, has been
j made public. General Greene was then â 
I brigadier general. His brigade con
â¢ slsted of the First Colorado, First Ne
! braska and Tenth Pennsylvania and
I the First and Second Battalions of the
S Eighteenth Infantry, Batteries A and
j B of the Utah Artillery, a detachment
jof Company A, Engineer Battalion,
I First California, First and Third Bat
| taiions, Third Artillery, and Company |
A, Engineer Battalion. .1
General Greene describes in detail the |
part performed by his command in the ,
battles about Manila. He expresses ap- \
preciation of the services rendered by !
Captain T. D. Mott, aide de camp to the \
i major general commanding, and to the !
I members of his own staff â Captain W. j
| G. Bates, assistant adjutant general; j
Lieutenant Schuyler Schiefttin, aide de
camp; Captain W. A. Harper, assistant
quartermaster, and Major F. S. Bourns, i
surgeon United States Volunteers (the
latter on special duty not medical) â all ;
of whom were with him on August 13.
They all carried orders under fire, for- j
tunately without any casualties.
The report of Major General MacAr- j
thur, who commanded the First Bri- j
gcide, Second Division, Eighth Army
Corps, on the day of the battle of Ma
nila, mention of which was made in
yesterday's dispatches, gives some very j
Interesting details of the tight of the i
13th of August. Following are some
of the extracts:
Several hours before the operations of
! the day were intended to commence there j
was considerable desultory firing from the j
Spanish line, both of cannon and small
arms, provoked no doubt by Filipino sol- |
diers, who insisted upon maintaining a
general fusillade along their lilies, with !
which the American line connected just I
east of the Passla road. The lire was not J
returned by our troops, and when the for
mation of the day was commenced things ,
at the front were comparatively quiet.
By 6 o'clock the position was occupied,
about 1*:35 the naval attack commenced,
and some twenty minutes thereafter the
| gun of Battery U, Utah Artillery, opened '
! on blockhouse 14. the guns of the Astor j
I Battery having engageu an opposing bat
tery Borne miuutes after the opening of
the naval attack. There was no reply
from the blockhouse or contiguous lines,
! either by guns or small arms. The op
position to the Astor flre, aoweyer, was
1 quite energetic, but after a spirited con
i test the opposition, consisting probably
1 of two pieces, was silenced.
This content was the only notable lea
i ture of the lirst stage of the action and
! was especially creditable to the organiza-
I tion engaged. The poaition selected by
â  Lieutenant March after careful recon
| noissance was perhaps the. only one pos
! sible In the vicinity, and It was occupied
with great skill and held with commenda
; ble firmness with the battery, having three
mi D wounded, one of whom has since j
died. Tha Utah gun on the road fired four- 1
' teen shots at blockhouse 14 with good ef- j
. feet, as was subsequently ascertained
i upon inspection of the works.
Lieutenant Grow and detachment de
! serve great credit for the commendable
manner in which the piece was served
and pulled through the mud without the
assistance of horses. Some time about 11
o'clock concentrated Infantry lire was j
heard in front of the Second Brigade, and |
not long thereafter an exultant shout in- j
diratcd substantial success for our arms
on the left. It was therefore assumed
that the enemy had been so shaken as to
make the advance practicable without a
j serious disadvantage to our troops. At
1 about 11:30 o'clock a United Stages flag â 
was placed upon blockhouse 14, thus con
cluding the second stage of the action
without opposition and wiTiioUt loss.
The general advance was soon resumed, |
the Thirteenth Minnesota leading, with j
Company X a> advance guard; hen the i
i Astor Battery, the battalion of the Twen
i ty-third Infantry, the battalion of the
Fourteenth infantry and the North l)a
', kola Regiment following in the order
named. At a point ju^t south of Slng
along a blockhouse was found burning,
â¢ causing a continuous explosion of small
arms ammunition, which, together wltti a.
scattered flre from the enemy, retarded
: the advance for a time. All difficulties j
were soon overcome, however, including
the passage of the Astor Battery, by the
; determined efforts of Lieutenant Mart h
; and his men, assisted by the infantry of
; the Minnesota Regiment, over the gun
: emplacement which obstructed the road.
In the village of Sinpalong the advance
fell under a looso fire, tlie Intensity of
' which increased as the forward niove
> merit was pressed, and very soon the com
mand was committed to a fierce combat.
This strong opposition arose at block
house 20 of the Spanish defenses, a de
; taehed work with emplacements for six
â  guns, which fortunately were not filled on
the 13th inst., but the work was occupied
: by a detachment of infantryâ probably a
strong rear guard. The advance party,
consisting of men of the Minnesota Reg
iment, reinforced by volunteers from the
Astor Battery, led by Lieutenant March
I and Captain Sawtelle of the brigade staff
ins an individual volunteer, reached a
; point within lens than eighty yards of the
blockhouse, but was obliged to retire to
; the intersection road In the village, at
which point a hasty work was improvised
and occupied by a firing line of about j
\ fifteen men. Aside from conspicuous In- i
dividual actions in the first rush, the well I
; regulated conduct of this firing line was
â  the marked feature of the contest, and |
i it is proposed, if possible, to ascertain the
names of the men engaged, with a view
to recommending them for special dis
tinction.
At about 1:30 p. m. all the firing- had
! ceased and two scouting parties volun
j tarlly led by Captain Sawtelle and Lleu
â  tenant March soon thereafter reported
i the retreat of the adversary. The city
i was entered without further incident
, through the Paoeo district. The contact
was made about 12 o'clock and the con
i test continued with great ferocity until
| 1:35 â that is to say, about an hour and a
j half. The loss in the combat was three
! officers wounded, four enlisted men killed
and thirty-three wounded.
General Mac Arthur takes occasion to
I commend In strong terms the g-allantry
! of Colonels Ovenshine and Reeve, Cap
! tains Sawtelle, Bjofnstadt and Seebach, I
and of Lieutenants March, Kernan and
Whitworth.
Good Work of Forest Rangers.
BALLARD, Oct. 2.â The recent rain
han put the fire fiends out of a job and
the Government patrol will have a respite
for a few weeks. The Government ap
pointed forest rangers in the Zaca Lake
reserve just in the nick of time, the finest
timber belt In this reserve having been
saved from destruction after a hard fight
lart week. The Call correspondent here
brought news of the fire and sent r force
of men, who arrived in time to extinguish
the conflagration.
Captain Relieved of His Command.
LEXINGTON, Kw, Oct. 2.â Captain J.
F. Williams of Company I, Eighth Massa
chusetts, was placed under arrest and
confined to his quarters to-day for neg
lecting to inspect thÂ« guard while he wai

rily relieved of his command. The matter
may come before a court-martial.
PREPARING TO
OCCUPY HAVANA
Reasons for Expediting
Matters.
SPANIARDS MUST EVACUATE
HUNGRY CUBANS HAVE GROWN
DESPERATE.
American Forces and Warships Sug
gested as the Best Diplomats
Against Spanish Pro
crastination,
Special cable to The Call and the Xew York
Herald. Copyrighted, Ib9B, by James Gor
don Bennett.
HAVANA, Cuba, Oct. 2.â Though it is
a hazardous venture to make predic
tions in the face of Spanish procrasti
nation, it may be predicted that the
American flag will be flying over Morro
and Cabanas within three weeka. There
are several reasons why the Commis
sioners wish to see the occupation begin
as soon as possible.
Firstâ They believe the presence of
American forces and warships the best
kind of diplomacy to hasten negotia
tions with the Spanish Commission.
Second â The presence of our men
would tend to- crowd the Spaniards out.
Thirdâ lmmediate action would facili
tate the distribution of relief supplies
and prevent n^'-avation attending the
evacuation by armed and hungry Cu
bans who cannot be freed from camp
life until Spanish soldiers disappear or
there are sufficient Americans present
to control them and guarantee Cuban
safety.
Fourth â It would enable reconcentra
dos strong enough to work, but axe now
prevented from doing so, to find self
sustaining employment, while making
possible the distribution of proper food
among those still dying in large num
bers, deaths being fewer than in Gen
eral Weyler's time simply because there
are fewer teft to die.
Fifthâ While all is quiet and abso
lute security reigns, General JBlanco's
withdrawal introduces a factor of un
certainty. While he remains Ameri
cans are safe, for he has the power and
will make them so. While his successor
is unknown, both power and will to
preserve order are unknown quantities.
The plan is, on the arrival of the first
American troops here to take posses
sion of both Murro and Cabanas simul
taneously and hoist the American flag
over both. This is advised as making a
display of American sovereignty and
also gaining possession of the harbor
entrance, thus obviating any possible
submarine treachery against American
warships. As soon as possible there
after the Americans are to take con
trol of the Custom-house and collect
revenues, preserving Spanish rates till
sufficient warning of change has been
given to importers and merchants.
Then gradually American control is to
be extended until it includes the whole
municipal and provincial administra
tion.
The American Commission held a ses
sion late yesterday afternoon to con
sider the Spanish reply on evacuation
and a request for a jo-lnt session to
morrow, which wtte received earlier in
the day. The Spanish reply does not
insist on the original dates proposed â
to begin the evacuation on November 1
and end it on April 1.
The Commission also discussed the
report of Captains Page and Brooks, in
which thÂ«y make the following recom
mendations:
Firstâ Revocation of arbitrary laws of
reconcentratlon which were still extant
wherever we went and are probably exist
ing: elsewhere in the islands.
Second â Immediate evacuation by the
Spanish troops of the district of Keme
dlos, in the province of Santa Clara and
the removal of Spanish rule therefrom.
This district includes the important
municipalities of Calbarien, Remedlos,
Vueltas, Camajuani and Yagujay,
which represent the most important
sugar and tobacco centers and are con
nected with the town of Placetas by
standard and narrow-gauge railroads.
The main port of this district is the
flourishing town of Caibarien. Such
evacuation could be speedily accom
plished by the removal by rail of the
Spanish trorrps to other points west.
They are. Indeed, very few troops in
this district, but the Spanish forces are
being centered in Placetas.
American acceptance of the joint ses
sion proposal to be sent to-morrow will
probably be accompanied by an answer
to the evacuation document and a re
quest for the removal of reconcentrados
under regulations in accord with the
officers' recommendations. The last twn,
however, may perhaps await the joint
session.
SECOND ARMY CORPS
TO BE SENT TO CUBA
About to Be Shipped From Camp
Meade to Anninston Prepara
tory to the Trip.
CAMP MEADE, Mlddletown, Pa., Oct.
2. â The Second Army Corps will be ship

preparatory to being sent to Cuba. The
movement from here will begin In about
two weeks, and will be completed with
the least possible delay. The first divi

Towns Literally Wiped Off the. Map
and Utter Desolation Where
All Should Be Smiling
Plenty.
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett.
HAVANA, Oct. 2.â Captain Brooks,
commission disburser, and Captain
Page of General Butler's staff, two of
the most energetic officers attached to
the commission, returned last evening
from a trip through the center of the
I island, particularly in the northern sec
tion of Santa Clara province. They
started from here early Monday morn
; ing and covered nearly one thousand
| miles by rail and upward of fifty on
! horseback. The arduous trip was un
; dertaken on Captain Page's suggestion,
! with General Butler's indorsement,
with the object of inspecting possible
| camp sites, discovering the real condi
1 tions of the country and getting unoffi
cially In touch with the insurgent lead
ers shut off from all news except such
| as is distorted before it reaches them.
Reporting to the commission this
j morning- the two officers strongly rec
i ommended immediate measures of re
! lief for Cuban soldiers by opening ports
j and abolishing Spanish barriers against
i food maintained, notwithstanding the
j supposed peace. They also urge immedi
! ate Spanish evacuation of sufficient
'â  areas to permit surviving reconcentra
dos to work, they being at present pre
j vented by irksome Spanish restrictions.
They found conditions of extreme
: want in most of the Cuban camps. Con
| ditions were worse in Santa Clara,
where the death rate is still 400 a
month, mainly from starvation, having
j fallen from the rate of 1000 a
month chiefly through the diminution
of human material to provide victims.
!Of 400 families in Santa Clara city
taken from their own farms under Gen
' eral Weyler's order, 300 have absolutely
vanished under the reconcentrado sys
tem.
The officers say it is Impossible to
describe the destitution and its accom
paniments. They found towns liter
! ally wiped off the map, once prosperous
estates heavily overgrown, roads re
â¢ duced to goat tracks, bridges destroyed,
1 wires tangled with tropical s^rub, and
I death, destruction and ruin everywhere.
; the natural riches of the country only
! emphasizing utter desolation where all

SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Oct. 2.âSur

1 diers are sent on board the vessel for

j that when the Obdam left Porto Rico
many on board were sick, yet the first

WHITE EARTH INDIANS
ARE CAUSING ANXIETY
Conflicting Beports From the Minne-
sota Reservation Received at
Washington.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 2.â The Interior
Department authorities fear the situa
tion in the White Earth Indian Reserva
tion in Minnesota may be serious, not
withstanding official reports to them
state that no trouble is apprehended.
They base this on press dispatches, for
Acting Secertary of the Interior Ryan
has received a dispatch from Indian Agent
Sutherland, in charge of the Indians
there, announcing that everything is quiet
and that there is no apprehension of
trouble, either on Bear Island or Leech
Lake. A dispatch of similar tenor has
also been sent by Indian Inspector Tin
ker, located at that point, and the of
ficial report to the War Department from
the commander of that department of the
army also expresses the opinion that no
danger Is to be apprehended. The Gov
ernment will watch matters closely to
prevent trouble.
NARROW ESCAPE FROM
DEATH IN FLAMES
Ex-Sheriff Parker and Family of Mo
doc County Almost Cremated in
Their Home.
AT/TTTRAS, Oct. 2.â The beautiful dwell
ing of ex-Sheriff C. B. Parker was de
stroyed by fire at an early hour this
morning:. The family barely escaped In
their night clothes. The fire started from
a defective flue in the upper story.
Mr. Parker and his wife awoke at about
2 o'clock to find their home in flames. Mr.
Parker picked up his wife and seven-day
old baby, together win the bedding, and
removed them to a place of safety. Then
he returned to arouse the other occupants
and rescue two small boys. Upon enter-
Ing the upper story he was confronted by
a solid sheet of flames and with difficulty
succeeded in reaching and removing the
boys.
The only articles saved were blankets
find wrapping these around his family
Mr. Parker drove to town, a distance of

INCREASED TUXES
II SANTA CLARIS
New Rate the Highest in
Years.
GANG RULE IS EXPENSIVE
PEOPLE BEGIN TO REALIZE THE
TACT.
Supervisor Rea Said to Be Colonizing
Laborers at the County's Ex
pense to Insure His
Re-election.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 2.â The county tax
riae fixed by the Board f Supervisors
last week is the highest in six years,
if not the highest ever levied, in Santa
Clara County. The levy this year is
$1 40 per $100 valuation on property
ortside incorporated towns and cities
and $1 10 in municipalities. This is an
increase of 2 cents over the outside rate
and 7 cents over the inside rate of last
y xr, when the levies were $1 03 inside
and SI 'Â»'> outside. A comparison of the
assessed valuation and State levies
makes the increase larger than it looks
or. its face.
In 189' the assessed valuation of prop
erty in Santa Clara County was $49,
418,945, whiie this year the valuation has
been raised to $G0,004,b05. The State
rate last year was 51 cents, which, de
ducted from the $1 38 county rate,
leaves 87 cents with which to conduct
county affairs. That sum raised about
$431,000. This year the State tax is 2.2
cents lower than last year, or 48.S
cents, and the valuation nearly $1,000,
000 higher. On an assessed valuation
of $50,054,885 the 91.2 cents of levy left
for county affairs will this year raise
$456,000, or" a little over $25,000 more
than last year. As each cent additional
on the levy raises $5000, this shows that
the present increase in county taxes
over last year is virtually 5 cents.
This is not at all pleasing or en
couraging to tax payers, and as they
note the steady increase in the rate of
taxation they wonder where the "gang"
of tax-eaters will stop.
The following table showing the tax
rates and assessed valuation for the
past six years is interesting, as it
shows a steady increase during that
time:

The valuation and rate In 1895 were
higher than that set for this year, but
at that time the State rate was 68.5
c its, leaving but 76.5 cents levy for
county expenses, and this amount
raised about $420,000.
The people of Santa Clara County are
beginning to realize that they pay too
heavily for their county government.
T* c Board of Supervisors, which acts
under "Boss" Rea's orders, is responsi
ble for the continual increase in taxes
without a corresponding material bene
fit. Santa Clara County has the best
roads in the State, but they cost more
than they should and the Supervisors
do a good deal of unnecessary road
work about election time to further
their chances at the polls. Just at pres
ent a good example of this can be seen
in the First Supervisorial District,
where Supervisor George E. Rea, a
brother of the "boss," is a candidate for
re-election. It is said laborers are be
ing colonized in the district to insure
his election and that they are being
given unnecessary employment on the
roads.

TORPEDO-BOAT DAVIS
READY FOR HER TRIAL
Portland (Or.) Builders Satisfied That
She Will More Than Meet
Requirements.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 2.â E. Wolffe of the
firm of Wolffe & Zwicker of Portland, Or.,
has notified the Navy Department that it
is ready to submit to official spoed trials
the torpedo boat Davis, built by that firm,
and has requested the department to fix
a time and place for the trial. As no
naval vessel has yet been tried on the
North Pacific Coast, it will be necessary
for the department to lay out a trial
course, probably in Puget Sound.
The builders of the Davis have been
making some private trials with the lit
tle boat, which is required to make a
speed of 22% knots, and having run up the
revolutions of her screw to 400. while only
370 are required, they feel satisfied that
she will more than meet the requirements.
Mr. "Wolffe was at the Navy Depart
ment to-day when the bias were opened
for four new monitors, and seems to be
satisfied with the opening. Although he
was not successful himself, yet he is glad
that ono of them will be built on the Pa
cific Coast.
Mr. Wolffe, in speaking of the torpedo
boat Davis, mentioned that he did not
desire that it be taken away from the Co
lumbia River for a trial course, and
thinks it will be run Inside of ten days, as
it will take taat time before the depart
ment can send the necessary official. The
linn is now constructing trie torpedo boat
Fox. which is expected to be completed
in three weeks, and also the torpedo de
destroyer UoldÃborough, which will not be
ready till January.

ing the decision of the Paris Council.
He said:
"There are not enough soldiers now to
garrison all the posts. There is need of
100,000 soldiers for that purpose. I do
not know what the intention of the War
Department is. It may be that the sol
diers are being held in the event of
trouble occurring in the Philippines,
Cuba or Porto Rico. Everything is in
abeyance now. I have no different
knowledge of what the War Depart
ment intends, but it is certainly safe
to hold a large number of soldiers in
readiness."
Concerning the controversy between
General Miles and the War Department
he said:
"I have no statement whatever to
make. I have nothing whatever to com
plain about. I did my duty as I
thought best, and tried to do it faith
fully for the best interests of all. It
will be time enough to make statements
when my superiors complain and call
me to account. There is no use stirring
up matters/"

FULLER ESTABLISHES
THREE WORLD'S RECORDS
SAN JOSE, Oct. 2.â George Fuller of the
Olympic Club Wheelmen of San Francisco
established new one-third, one-half and
two-thirds mile records at the Garden
City Wheelmen's track to-day. He start
ed for the quarter mile and five mile rec
ords, but failed. Fuller was paced by
tandem teams from the Bay City Wheel
men, the Reliance Club of Oakland and
the Garden City Wheelmen. Each record
was a distinct trial, with flying start.
The one-third mile was made in :35 4-5,
beating the record formerly held by Stan
ley Hewitt of :Sl 2-5. He made me half
mile in :53 4-5, lowering F. G. Peck's rec
ord of :57. A record of 1:12 1-5 was es
tablished for the two-thirds mile. Fuller
rode the quarter mile in :25 1-5 and tne
five miles in 10:33 4-5.
The Garden City Wheelmen intended to
hold a race matinee this morning, but
rain and threatening 1 weather kept the
crowd away and the races were aban
doned. A one mile handicap was run,
"which resulted as follows: E. McNlss

SITUATION IN
CHINA GROWING
MORE SERIOUS
Feeling of Anxiety
Exists.
DOUBT AS TO THE EMPEROR
BELIEF AT WASHINGTON THAT
HE IS DEAD.
Instructions Sent to Secretary Long
to Dispatch the Cruiser
Baltimore to
Tientsin.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 2.â A brief dis
patch was received to-day at the State
Department from Minister Conger at
Peking concerning the situation there.
He says nothing concerning the re
ported death of the Emperor, but states
that a feeling of anxiety exists, add
ing that de does not consider the situa
tion especially critical at present. The
State Department officials do not dis
credit the report of the Emperor's
death, and some do not hesitate to ex
press their acceptaice of the report of
his assassination. The Chinese Min
ister, however, discredits the entire re
port of a tragedy.
"I do not believe that the Emperor
has been assassinate^ " he said to an
Associated Press reporter to-night. "I
have no confirmation of the report."
"Do you believe the Emperor to be
dead?" he was asked.
"I hope he is not," was the reply.
"Yet Ido not know. Sick men some
times die and the Emperor may be
dead. Men die natural deaths in China
as elsewhere."
He then repeated the assurance that
he had received no information what
ever and said he would hope for re
assuring news until he was personally
advised of the condition of affairs."
BALTIMORE ORDERED
TO A CHINESE PORT
NEW YORK, Oct. 2.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Instruc
tions have been sent bjr Secretary Long
to Rear Admiral Dewey directing him
to send the protected cruiser Baltimore
at once to Tientsin, China.
This action shows conclusively the
concern felt by the administration at
the existing conditions of affairs in the
Celestial empire. It would seem to in
dicate that more sensational informa
tion had been received from Minister
Conger than the authorities made pub
lic.
It was assured, however, that advices
from the Minister at Peking simply show
the turbulent condition of affairs exist
ing throughout the empire. In the dis
patch made public by the State Depart
ment yesterday the Minister announced
that riots had occurred at paints not
then known. In view of the prospect
of trouble in Peking in consequence of
the probable death of the Emperor and
the efforts which will probably be made
by his adherents to seek revenge or at
least assured safety for themselves the
authorities deemed it wise to place a
ship as near the capital as possible,
where members of the American Lega
tions and Consulates near the capital
may find refuge in case of need.
After a consultation with the Presi
dent Secretary Long directed Captain
A. S. Crowninshield. Chief of the Bu
reau of Navigation, to prepare instruc
tions to the rear admiral to send the
Baltimore to Tientsin without delay.
These orders were signed and sent yes
terday afternoon and it is believed that
the ship is now on her way to her des
tination.
It is also evident from the instruc
tions directing the Baltimore to proceed
to Tientsin that the administration is
either more relieved concerning the in
ternational situation In the Philippines
or that the danger to Americans and
American Interests in China is greater
than in the islands held by Rear Admi
ral Dewey 's force. So far as Germany
is concerned, the authorities are satis
fied that her attitude is now as correct
as they can desire. The Baltimore can,
therefore, be spared from Manila, espe
cially as the need for the presence of
an American ship at Tientsin is
greater.
DENBY BELIEVES THE
EMPEROR IS ALIVE
NEW YORK, Oct. 2.â A "Washington
special to the Herald says: Charles
Denby, former Minister to China, is op
timistic in his views on the Celestial
empire. He does not fear a revolution
there; he does not believe the Emperor
is dead and he is confident there will be
no partition of the empire.
"The instant the Emperor Is dead,"
said Mr. Denby, "the fact will be cabled
to the State Department, which has not
yet been so advised. I remember the
Emperor was more than friendly. He
was devoted to the Empress Dowager
and he gave her recently the credit of
new officers created and announced."
If there were in other respects differ
ent shades of policy represented by the
Empress Dowager and Emperor, Mr.
Denby said, both represented the idea
of material progress.
"There are now," said Mr. Denby,
"eight hundred miles of railway build
ing out of Peking, and the building of
other lines will rapidly follow all Amer
ican enterprises. But this does not
mean the foreshadowing of a partition
ing of the Empire. As I have stated
before, there will be no partition of
China There will be privileges and
ports acquired by nations and strips of
territory here and there, but nothing
more. Our commercial exchanges with
China have doubled within a short time
and will continue to increase."
YOUNG LI'S CHIEF
ADVISOR HONORED
LONDON, Oct. 2.â According to a dis
patch to the Times from Shanghai,
Chuahi-Ta-Pou has been appointed
President of the Court of Censors and a
member of the Grand Council. He is
Young Li's chief supporter and was re
cently dismissed from office by the Em
peror. The projected Imperial review
of the forces at Tien Tsin has been
abandoned.

LONDON, Oct. 3.â The Standard says

Japan in the execution of necessary

DAUDET AT HOME.
Everybody has heard or read of the
famous nos^ltabla house and big garden
of Champrosay, almost a park, on the
edge of the forest of Senart, within
view of the long, white road of Corbell.
No one but is familiar now with the little
study, and the cane-bottomed chair before
the small writing table, with the piano,
Mme. Daudet's work table, with all the
details of a laborious and agreeable soli
tude-a-deux. Happy artist! His bright,
expansive nature bade him shun the em
bittering and morose single solitude. He
lived, talked, gesticulated, In flying
phrase his works, with even his faithful
audience, his counsel, chorus and critic in
one beloved being. Here he worked as
siduously, when he was not running riot
among the forest aisles or wandering
along the Seine before rheumatism held
him captive; and when the light went,
there were the tranquil evenings with his
wife in cheerful lamplight, while she
darned little Leon's socks, and he invent
ed talks for the child upon his knees. And
their baby abed, the needle, like the pen,
was forsaken, and the two charmed them
selves with duets on the piano till mla
night. But for pain there would have
been no cloud upon his life, as far as Its
private setting and accomplishment went.
For, like Stevenson, he was ever surpris
ingly susceptible to every form of en
chantment. â 
He drank avidly at every source of joy.
Wagner "hypnotizes" him; the violin sur
prises him into delirium. He can forget
himself for a whole day talking of Mozart
or paddling along a silent stream; an un
expected luncheon in a village inn. where
I he finds a wheezy old spinet, sends him
into an afternoon paradise. He seems
never to have sulked, except perhaps,
against the institute. Then, unfortunate
ly instead of laughing, as he has laughed
at Provence, Instead of giving us another
irresistible galejado, he took what he
called "ces chinoiseries" too seriously and
too ill-humoredly, and produced one of
his weakest books. "L'lmmortel. It is
I a book he ought never to have written,
for it touches his own reputation far
more heavily than the institute. It is
singular that a writer with such an ex
quisite sense of the ludicrous as Daunet
failed to see the absurdity of his attack
upon a composite body lUe that of the
live academies, which he apostrophizes as
a single criminal.â Fortnightly Review.
DAYLIGHT SWIM.
A young woman wearing a mask and
attired in a bathing suit caused a sensa
tion in the Lake Shore drive yesterday
alt. rnuon by plunging into the lake at the
foot of Bellevue place.
A breeze blow from the lake, ana the
water was comfortably warm. About 4
o'clock, when a hundred urchins were
paddling along the beach and taKing a
dip at the south end of the Lincoin Park
seawall, a closed private carriage stopped
at Bellevue place. A footman in livery
jumped to the door and opened it.
A young woman in a blue bathing suit
stepped out and ran gracefully across the
grass plat. As she went she adjusted a
mask to a handsome, smiling face with
her sunbrowned arms. At the end of the
seawall the unknown bather stepped nim
bly in the water. In a moment she was
well out in the lake swimming with a
strong, steady stroke toward the crib off
Walton place.
The seawell was edged with a crowd oi
curious spectators. When 200 yards from
shore she turned and swam on her back.
Her eyes wore toward the residences
along the drive. Suddenly, as though she
saw a looked-for face she raised her arm
and coquettishiy waved her hand.
No one on the seawall saw the carriage
slip away, but as the woman neared the
crib the amazed spectators saw the vehi
cle drive up ready to receive her at the
foot of Walton place. The crib toward
which the woman swam is a low one, ex
tending northward about E0 feet. It is
nearly a half mile from the south end of
the seawall to the crib, but when the fair
swimmer reached it she swung herself
on it with as much ease as an athlete.
On reaching the shore the young woman
was met by Policeman Charles Conlan,
beside* her servants. After a brief polite
parley with the officer she stepped into
her carriage and was soon out of sight
"You Bee, it was like this," said the
smiling policeman, "the girl's fellow lives
over here on the drive somewhere. She
takes hia rlnre on a wager of a diamond
ring to swim across to the crib in broad
daylight. She is all pluck and she does
it sticking him for a diamond ring. See?
T threatened to arrest nor. but when I
i learned about the joke I had to let a girl
with that kind of grit go."â Chicago Rec
ord.
CYCLISTS' PHRASES.
The practice of cycling is packing many
new pnrasea into this portmanteau lan
guage of ours. A man who boasts is now
paid to -ride with a very high gear.
One who is unduly haughty has sand In
his bearings." But the newest is the de
scription of a slow and dull person as a
"regulator"â after an imaginary class of
cycle so called as being so slow that all
other machines "go by it." And it is
not polite for one cyclis*. to call another
a liar If hÂ»> calls him a cyclometer the
same end is more elegantly achieved.â

exercise, but since I've been shut up in this shop I began
to have terrible bilious headaches. I still did enjoy an
occasional bout at boxing, but after a few lively rounds a
tendency to get as sick as can be seemed to take posses-

the next day I would have a cracking good headache, My

THE BUSINESS OUTLOOK-
WHILE the volume of trade in San Francisco
thus far this year, as represented by the local
bank clearings, is some $60,000,000 greater
than during the corresponding period in 1597, there
.was a falling off in September of a little over $5,000,
000. The clearings for September were $69,872,835,
against $74,980,180 in September, 1897, while for the
first nine months of the year they were $591,240,413,
against $530,052,414 during the corresponding period
last year. These bank clearings are accepted as the
most reliable indication of the state of business,
hence we must regard 1898 as being much better
from a commercial point of view than 1897. Of
course, there has been a lull of late, owing to the
diminished farm production consequent upon the dry
season, but there are now indications that this same
dry season was a real blessing in disguise, and that
it will result in even greater prosperity in 1899 than
we have enjoyed in 1898.
In the first place, it is a well-known agricultural
fact that dry years are great fertilizers of the soil.
Aside from the much-needed rest given to the soil,
droughts always bring to the surface fertilizing ele
ments which reinvigorate the earth. These are the
two reasons why dry seasons are usually followed
by bountiful harvests. A third benefit, and one of
great importance, is that dry seasons result in the
exhaustion of supplies, and thereby clean up the dif
ferent markets of accumulated stocks, and leave
them bare for the next harvest. This is now clearly
shown in the case of hay, grain, wine and fruit.
While hay will probably not bring as high prices next
year as it has done this, still supplies will be so short
next summer that the fanners will almost without
doubt receive profitable returns for the crop of 1899.
The same result will also doubtless be seen in the
minor cereals. Wheat, being a universal product,
will not be as much affected as the more local cereals.
As for fruits, unless all present signs fail, there will
be no dried nor canned fruit left in the California
market by the time the next crop comes in, and
when there is no carry-over stock for the harvest
to contend with high prices are quite apt to rule.
This condition is already manifesting itself in the
wine trade, as it will with the other products later
on. The crop of grapes is short all over the State,
and the vintage will be correspondingly diminished,
while the wine trade is gratified by a marked in
crease in consumption which has already caused an
advance of 5 cents per gallon in the price of wine,
and which promises to clean up the present stock
of wine before another large crop can be placed upon
the market. From this the winemakers infer that
prices will go still higher. Certainly, a good and
growing demand for grapes is observable all over
the State, and prices are very firm and somewhat
better than they were expected to be a month ago.
Raisins are to be included in this gratifying exhibit,
for they have been very active at good prices thus
far this season, and there are no present indications
of any setback in either the demand or the prices.
Short hop crops in different parts of the world have
given this product more tone, and quotations have
recently advanced and are firm at the improvement
In short, with the exception of wool, which is ex
cessively dull, no matter where we look we find
the prospects for California products exceptionally
bright. If they are realized business ought to be
excellent next yeai. This is generally understood in
trade and financial circles, and a feeling of confidence
is observable in consequence. It would not be at
all turprising if we found ourselves rejoicing, in 1899,
that the dry season of 1898 had given us such lively
and profitable markets.
The situation in the East shows no marked change.
The bank clearings of the country made a slight gain
last week, and the failures for the week were 195
against 194 for the same week last year. The month
of September averaged up very well, with a record
of the smallest number of failures for any month
since 1802, except August of this year. The changes
in prices are all for the better, except in cotton, which
fell to the lowest point since 1848, a period of fifty
years. This 9taple has been dropping for some little
time. The recent reduction in woolen goods has
caused an increased demand in this line. Iron and
Â«Uad continue as active as ever, and business in
boots and shoes is reported better. Money contin

considerable alarm over the political situation in

GfIGE IN SflN FRANCISCO.
rROM the degree of earnestness displayed by
the vast audience which assembled at the Pa
vilion on Saturday evening to welcome the
Republican candidates ior Governor and Lieutenant
Governor the brightest auguries may be drawn of
the outlook for the party of sound money, prosperity
and conservative government.
It was made apparent by a thousand evidences
that the intelligence of the city has been awakened
to a realization of the menace which Maguire's can
didacy carries against property, industry and thrift,
and that the people recognize in Mr. Gage the cham
pion not only of Republicanism but of Americanism
in its fullest sense.
It 19 now clear that in nominating Maguire Democ
racy committed its usual blunder. Since his record
of vagaries and follies has been exposed, and his
scheme of taxation that would rob the farmer of
his fields and the miner of his claim has been made
known, the sense of justice and the intelligence of
the people have revolted against him.
The expectations of his friends that he would carry
San Francisco by an overwhelming majority are
rapidly fading. Indeed from the impression made
upon our citizens by Mr. Gage and from the warmth
of the cheers that accompanied his speech and ap
proved his words at the close, it appears he is as
popular here as at his home in Los Angeles; and
that the single-taxer will not carry out of this city
on election day any majority to offset the vote of the
interior counties.
A notable feature of Mr. Gage's speech was the
tone of courtesy that pervaded every portion of it.
His defense of the Republican convention from the
slanders of the fusionists was manly, and his refer
ences to old line Democrats, the stalwart Populists
and the Silver-Republicans were of a nature that
proved a true liberality toward those who differ from
him in politics. The same fine trait was revealed in
the kindly manner with which he received an in
terruption from a Maguireite in the audience, while
his ready wit enabled him to turn the interruption to
his own advantage.
The speeches of every speaker of the evening, from
the short and spirited addresses of Jacob Neff and Ir
ving M. Scott to the elaborate arguments of Mr.
Gage and Senator Perkins, were fair in terms and
forcible in meaning. They set forth the high im
portance of the issues, both State and national, which
are at stake in the canvass, and revealed plainly the
nature of the contest that has been forced upon the
business interests of the people by Maguireism and
Bryanism.
These issues are not to be mistaken, nor can the
fact be ignored that their nature is such that they
concern the welfare of individuals as well as of the
community as a whole. This being so, Senator Per
kins was fully justified in saying:
"There never was a better time for straying Re
publicans to come back into the familiar fold; there
never was a better time for Populists to concede that
the great principles of Republicanism are framed for
the nation's best interests; and there never was a
better time for Democrats to purify their own party
by abandoning it until it has settled back to some
honest principles that do not threaten the integrity
and very existence of our nation."
INSANITY'S RIGHT TO SLAY.
THE plea of insanity has been worked until such
merit as it may have possessed has gone from
it. Now it is used not to shield the lunatic,
but to give the evil-minded and the pervert a right
to kill. A man may plan a murder never so cun
ningly, carry out every detail, and intelligently en
deavor to escape, and all he has to do if caught is
to demonstrate that at some time either himself or
a great uncle or the second cousin of his grandmother
had been known as eccentric. This washes him of
all blood-guiltiness, makes a mock of justice and
places a premium on assassination. It is foolish and
wrong.
Humanity revolts against the thought of putting
a crazy man out of the way by the methods applic
able to the sane. There is no real difficulty in dis
tinguishing between the mentally sound and morally
responsible, and the maniac who is not conscious of
the mischief his unchecked passion may work. The
difficulties are artificial, erected by experts, the effect
of them to defeat the purpose of the law. When
a man has sense enough to think out a murder
he should be held accountable for his deed no mat
ter whether or not there was proof that at times he
had been addicted to oddities. Probably in ninety
nine cases out of a hundred the plea of insanity is a
palpable and shameless fraud, worse because at the
same time it is a plea of guilty and a defiance to
society to do anything about it.
The instance afforded by Cheeseman over in Oak
land is a sample. He committed one unprovoked
murder and attempted to commit two. That he de
serves hanging there can be no question. Yet he
gets sent to an asylum there to stay until pronounced
cured, then to be tried. All of which means simply
that Cheeseman is to escape the penalty for his deed,
By the time he shall be "cured" the witnesses will
be scattered, interest in the matter dead, and Cheese
man will go free to kill whoever else may annoy him.
With the valuable precedent of having been in an
asylum he will be able to walk up and down the
earth seeking whom he may devour.
MORE LESSONS IN FORESTRY.
THE forest fires that are now sweeping over wide
areas of Colorado and Wisconsin are furnish
ing the American people with additional dread
object lessons on the subject of forest preservation.
From instruction on this matter it seems there is to
be no escape. If we do not learn and profit by what
is taught by science and the experience of Europe,
then we must learn from fire and our own calamities.
The annual losses to the United States by fires in
forest lands amount in the aggregate to many mil
lions. We could afford to expend vast sums for
policing and preservation of our woodlands and still
derive large profits from what such guardianship
would save to us. That truth is impressed upon the
public mind year after year with each returning sum
mer, and yet as soon as winter comes and the Legis
latures meet, the lessons are forgotten, and the legis
lation necessary to prevent similar disasters in the
coming year are left unenacted.
California has fortunately been spared this year
such destructive fires as those which are now raging
in our sister States, and yet our own have been so
widely disastrous that the total loss is almost incalcul
able. Surely an intelligent people having a keen ap
preciation of the comparative values of the natural
resources of their country will not sit idly by and
permit the richest of them to be wasted and destroyed
by fires without making some effort to save it. Yet
if any effort at forest preservation is to be made, the
time has come for making it. The people should
see to it that legislators to be elected this fall shall
provide some form of protection for our woods at
their coming session.

tinction of being; known as a -boss.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, OCTOBER 3, 1898.
JUDGE MAGUIRE continues the repetition of
his speech in which he arrays the masses
against the classes. He does not specify the
classes further than that they are the owners of
property, while the masses want to be, and he pro
poses to meet that want by taking from those who
have and dividing with those who have not. It is the
old cry of the French communist, "Property is rob
bery."
The Judge complains that people accumulate prop
erty in this country; but such accumulation was the
purpose for which the republic was founded. Popu
lation flows to the country where the laws give the
best and most equal protection to the rights of person
and property.
An analysis of the population of California \*Â£
show a greater percentage of men who own property
now, but had none when they began life here, than
in any other Western State. Our immigrant popu
lation has fared better and gained property faster
than almost anywhere else in the Union. German,
Irish, Scotch, English, Portuguese and Italian im
migrants in California have in the last thirty years
become property-holders, and are here probably the
most comfortably placed members of their respective
races. The American-born who have come to us
from the Eastern and older States have, as a rule,
prospered and gained property. If this be an evil,
Maguire's policy will correct it If it be wrong for
men to work and save and own their homes, and get
on in the world, and have something to leave to their
families, it can be stopped by removing legal protec
tion to the rights of property.
Judge Maguire regards the ownership of land as an
outrage upon society, a special privilege that must
be abolished. The land-owners are one of the
"classes" against which he has been infuriating
the "masses" for many years. In his speech in favor
of confiscating land to the Delaware Legislature,
made in March, 1897, he said: "It may be said that
the present owners purchased their lands upon the
faith of existing laws maintained by the people, and
that they were even encouraged to invest in lands by
the manifest policy of the laws thus made and main
tained by the people." Here is his own admission that
the laws which protect the right of property in land
have led to the ownership of such property. Men
have toiled and earned and invested their earnings in
land as one of the forms of property that is sanc
tioned by law. Proceeding in the same speech, Ma
guire said that land-owners claim that "having thus
purchased under sanction of the public law, it would
be a hardship to them and a wrong to them to change
the law so as to destroy their investments." But he
declared that while it will be "a hardship, it will not
be unjust to any."
That is the view taken of punishment of a man for
crime. It is a hardship to hang a man, but it is not
unjust, since he deserved hanging. The land-owner,
in Maguire's view, is a guilty man, whose punishment
by taking away his land is a hardship to him, but is
not unjust
But if it be wrong to own one kind of property,
and Maguire's election lead to its destruction and the
spoliation of its owners, in spite of the hardship to
them, how long will it be before another Maguire
arises who will say that ownership of personal prop
erty is also an outrage upon society? The argument
against personal property is just as good as against
real property.
The French communist was at least logical when
he declared that "all property is robbery," and Ma
guire is not logical when he declares that only landed
property is robbery.
The issue is before the people of California. If
they feel that the interests of the State can stand the
confiscation of land, the total destruction of land
ownership, and the hardship which Maguire admits
will follow to the present owners, they can forward
this policy by electing him Governor. But if they do
this they must prepare to welcome the successor, who
will surely follow him, seeking office by teaching that
personal property is robbery of the people, and must
therefore be justly taken from those who own it, not
withstanding it may be a hardship to them.
ZOLfl IN A BOD WAY.
' ZZJ XPERTS having pronounced Zola a degener
ate, other experts were kind enough to investi-
* â * gate, and pronounce the other set mistaken.
Nevertheless Zola has no particular reason for grati
tude to them. Magnan says of him:
"It i 9 true that Zola has orbicular contraction, car
diac spasms, thoracic cramps, false angina pectoris,
sensory hyperaesthesia, obsessions and impulsive
ideas; his emotivity is defective, and certain of his
ideas are morbid; but all this is not sufficient to affect
in any appreciable manner his intellectual processes.
His strong and harmonious constitution gives him
immunity; his intellect is not contaminated."
This, of coarse, is comforting to Zola and his
friends. Upon reading the symptoms an impulsive
observer might have been led to conclude some
thing serious the matter. The real truth seems to
be that an expert in any line likes to air his views,
and will do so regardless that to common sense the
views are generally ridiculous.
Zola has doubtless made mistakes, but if he is in a
state of degeneracy or near it, the other citizens of
France would do well to study his constitutional
defects and copy them. If France had more citizens
such as Zola she would not now present the pitiful
spectacle of a mock republic in which official con
science is dead, justice stifled by crime and the peo
ple trembling at the approach of a crisis which Js
to determine whether they are greater than the mili
tary despotism which is the backbone of a Govern
ment supposed to be not an oligarchy nor a king
dom, but the abode of free men.
(I TRAINED MONKEY IN DIPLOMACY.
T~\ GUINALDO, so far as known, is a unique
j\ character. In the wilds of Timbuctoo there
* * may be chiefs of about his intellectual caliber,
or the Simian chattering in the umbrageous depths
of the jungle may think in the same terms as Aguin
aldo. Indeed, the chap suggests nothing else so
strongly as a monkey. It is easy to Imagine him
clad in a red suit passing a tin cup to the strains of
a perambulating organ.
Nobody at this stage of proceedings questions the
wisdom of the President of the United States. He
has proved himself a statesman. But for this fact
there would be wonder that he permits this freak
to remain a factor in the Philippine question. The
natural impulse would be to send out a corporal's
guard to catch him and tether him to a tent pole
where he could devote himself to the chase of the
elusive flea and the nibbling of cocoanuts.
The "Revolutionary President" is a nuisance and
an impertinence. He is no more fit to be at the
head of even a partly civilized people than a pig to
lead the gentian. Prancing about in a swallow-tail
coat, decorating himself with gauds bestowed by
himself in token oÂ£ esteem, he would be a laughable
figure save that the future of the Philippines is a
problem, and that most every side of it presents a
serious aspect.
MASSES AND CLASSES.
HOW WE TOOK KHARTOUM.
We went swinging through the desert, marching straight to right a wrong,
For the British vengeance tarries, but the British arm Is long;
And the Soudanese beside us, with our darkies from the Nile,
Marched behind their British sergeants, grinning sidelong, gleesome smile;
For they knew we sought the Dervish and they heard the muttered doom
Of the Khalifa's black emblem, where It floated, o'er Khartoum.
Scottish pipe and English band,
Mule and camel pack,
Marching through a fiery land.
On the Moslem track;
Marching through the desert sand
With our Union Jack,
England's honor in each hand.
Soldiers white and black!
We went swinging through the desert, such a troop was never seen.
All avengers of the hero who drew tears from England's Queen,
Men of Warwickshire and Lincoln, with the Irish Fusileers,
And the Camerons' gay tartan flicking British Grenadiers;
Old Northumberland and Lancashire, a-swearing in their zeal.
Lancers gleaming on their chargers, with their thews of British steel.
Tramping through the burning haze
Far as eye could scan.
With our Maxims all ablaze,
Eager, to a man!
Holding, with a comrade's gaze,
Egypt and Soudan;
Thus we faced the Dervish way*
Down by Omdurman. I
God! But were they men or devils? Fiercer swordsmen never dre>Â»,
As they swooped, a white-robed legion, shouting Allah! where they flew;
Countless banners waved above them, shining brass and copper drum
Set the white man's heart a-beating with a new and savage thrum,
When those cursing, fiery demons met us in the serried shoek â
Met and fell, still shouting Allah! with black eyes that seemed to mock.
- Falling, with a murder thought.
In each cunning brain;
Shamming death, until we brought
Succor to their pain;
Then the dying arose and wrought
Devil's deeds again.
So! Our British vengeance Bought
Victims 'mid the slain.
Satan's hordes were loose upon us; but God's angels hovered round.
Faith and Love's white pinions quivered when our Lancers took the ground,
Charging through the Dervish squadrons, hurling death, one man to four!
Then, with thinner ranks, and serried, facing round to charge once more;
Gathering our fallen heroes, hewed and hacked, from out. the fray.
With God's glory on their foreheadsâ calm as on their drilling day.
Through our pulses pride and shamo
Coursed like wine of war;
Black and white lips spoke the name
Of our great Sirdar,
Swore the Moslem rage to fame,
Moslem force to bar â
Swore to quench the Crescent flame
In our Northern Star!
"With set teeth we fought and slaughtered. Dervishes like snowfiakes fell
While our black recruitsâ God bless themâ rushed the foe with savage yell.
They were bent upon their vengeance â we were dreaming on our own
On the death for which no courage, no devotion could atone.
But we slew a dastard' Moslem for each hair of Gordon's head-
Slew a Moslem for each tear-drop by our sovereign lady shed!
Tramping, on the Moslem track,
To the Moslem doom.
Crashing, in our wild attack,
On to dark Khartoum.
Till we knelt, men white and black.
In the sunset gloom,
Where our lady's Union Jack
Waves o'er Gordon's tomb!

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
There are five hundred clerks employed
under the accountant general of the Brit
ish navy.
Russia is building two docks at Llbau,
the new naval station on the Baltic, and
the reconstruction of the dock at Port
Arthur will also shortly be commenced.
Two mishaps took place on the British
cruiser Blake, attached to the channel
squadron. When leaving Milfordhaven
an auxiliary steam pipe bursted, delaying
the ship's depar.ure twenty-four hours.
During time evolutions she smashed her
stream anchor, weighing over five tons,
and which showed no weakness until it
gave way.
The two armored cruisers to be built
by contract at Barow-in-Furness and at
Glasgow will be 12,000 tons, 440 feet In
length, 68 feet beam, 26 feet 5 Inches mean
draught and to have a speed of 21 knots.
They have been named Euryalus and Ba
chante, the latest corvettes bearing these
names having been struck off the active
list.
A submarine boat, designed byM- Lau
beuf. Is being built at Cherbourg for the
French navy. She is cigar-shaped, about
100 feet long and 10 feet diameter, displac
ing 106 tons. 7Tie motive power Is partly
steam and electricity, the latter, of
course, being used when under water,
with which a speed of eight knots for
three hours Is anticipated, and five knots
for a longer period. The boat will be
sunk and raised by hydraulic power and
Its estimatel cost Is $159,900.
A good story Is told of lieutenant A. of
the British navy, which condensed from
the N. C. Daily News, runs as
follows: "Years ago when the said lieu
tenant was a middy his ship was sta
tioned at Vancouver, and A. being seized
with a sudden illness, was invalided just
before his ship sailed. The only other
officer left at the port was the chief car
penter, also invalided. The young middy
had studied the Queen's regulations and
the time for his examination having come
around, he applied to the senior officerâ
the chief carpenterâ to be examined for
lieutenant, and he was accommodated,
passing with flying colors. A. at once
became the senior officer and his first
act of authority was to order himself to
England with dispatches, an order which
he obeyed with all haste possible, appre
hending his ship might return at ony mo
ment. In due time he arrived at Ports
mouth and found he would have to wait
eight hours for a train to London, so he
again perused the regulations bearing on
his case and found that a bearer of dis
patches should take every available
means to expedite their arrival at head
quarters. He therefor* ordered a speclai
train to London and presented himself
before the First Lord. An explanation
was requested and frankly given and he
escaped without even a reprimand, as he
had complied to the letter with the
Queen's regulations. The most amusing
part of the Incident was that the dis
patches ho delivered contained nothing
but a narrative of his own illness and a
glowing account of the manner in which
he had passed his examinationâ the lat
ter account being written by himself."
It Is curious how naval experts differ.
In the United States a practice ship is
being built for the use of the Naval
Academy. This vessel is to be entirely
dependent upon sails for its locomotion
and the cadets will be thoroughly drilled
in making, reefing and furling sai.s aa
well as all other work belonging to the
passed age and usefulness of sailing
craft. The Aregntine Republic has Just
had an auxiliary steam training vessel
built in Scotland for the use of its cadets
and apprentices. In France the Minister
of Marine has come to the conclusion
that as sails are obsolete In modern war
ships it is a waste of time for cadets to
learn what is of no apparent usefulness
and it has been decided to send cadets on
board of the latest modern steamers to
familiarize themselves with the kind of
vessels in which future battles will be
fought. The French scheme of educa
tion has the advantage of bringing the
cadet at once In touch with officers and
crew and to learn all about the routine,
discipline and evolutions without the
waste of preliminaries, for much as it
grieves the old salts, sails are of the past
on ships of war, and seamanship as It
was taught in the old days is of little or
no use on a modern battleship with mili
tary masts only and with no canvas
whatever. Whatever sail practice is re
quired can be had In the boats with which
the ships are well supplied.

Off Pigeon Point.
The Pacific Mail Company's City of Pe
king will not get away for the Orient be
fore to-morrow and possfbly Wednesday.
The follower of the piston Is broken, and
a new one has to be made and fitted by
the Union Iron Works before the steamer
can sail. She Is now anchored off the
Mall dock, and nearly all the passengers
will remain by her until the repaira are
completed.
The Cty of Peking arrived here from
Manila on August 22, and the work of
transforming her from a transport into a
passenger steamer again was at once be
gun. She was thoroughly overhauled
from stem to stern and her machinery
. was placed in first class order. The fol
.â¢ lower of the piston was found defective,
bo a new one was put In. It worked all
' right while the engines were being turned
over at the dock, and no indications of a
. breakdown were notceable when the ves
sel got under way. lien the .'jf eking vvt^s
straightened out for the Golden Gate and
the engines were opened up there was a
' c L asl n and steam was in a moment shut
j c anchor was dropped off Sausallto
and when the extent of the damage was
learned the vessel was towed back to an
anchorage in Msslod Bay.
It was a beautiful day on the front yes
terday and thousands of people thronged
the wharves. The- big steamer was the
. center ol attraction, and the wharves at
the southern end of the town had crowds
"= n ui m all day long. Whitehall and
sailing boats crowded around the Peking
â  Â«t U^Â£fV le afterno Â°n and occasonally a
steam launch and a tug would put In an
APPearance. faking th! scene somewhw
â¢with .i. ,< ,i dcpÂ£ i rlure of the same vessel
with the California troops for Manila last
â¢ The people at Honolulu will be treated
to a great scare over the non-arrival of
the mail boat. She will be at least four
days late at that point, and they will have
. begun to think that she had again broken
down at sea and was making port under
â  Bail. â¢
The taking of mail steamers for trans
ports has played havoc with the port
. Every vessel that leaves here has every
pound of freight aboard she can carry
and hundreds of tons are left behind on
â¢the wharves. The Peking has an enor
' rr.ous load, and the Alameda for Sydney
N. 8. W.. via Honolulu, Apia and "Auck
. land has been compelled Â£0 refuse more
â¢ cargo. Not an ounce is being taken to
Honolulu, but that has not helped matters
much, as there is almost enough freight
on hand to fill another vessel.
The German mail steamer Prinz Hen-
Hen was caught in a typhoon, as were
other vessels In Asiatic waters last
month. Among her passengers was Gov
ernor General Augustin of the Philippines
and his wife. During the storm Mrs. Au
gustin was thrown out of her berth and
â¢ was seriously bruised and had her arm
broken It was also learned on the Gaelic
that the Prinz Henrich had her ventila
tors carried away and a;< number of
etancheons broken. The typhoons this
year seem to have more disasters to their
credit than ever before.
The Pacific Mail Company's steamer
. San Bias arrived from Panama and way
, ports yesterday. She left Mazatlan on
September 26 and made a good run up the
coast. â¢ ,
The steamer Coos Bay got In from
southern ports yesterday. Captain Hall
reports that at 6:30 a. m. he sighted: the
steamer Whitesboro about two miles east
of Santa Cruz with 175 feet of a lumber
raft in tow. The wind was southeast, and
the Whitesboro was holding the raft^jff
the beach.' Old sliig? captains think that
in a day or so the Whitesboro will come
into port with the remains of the raft
that caused the Progreso so much trouble
in tow.
Captain Hall of the Coos Bay further i
reports that from Santa Cruz to within
three miles of Pigeon Point he passed ;
numerous stray piles. At 10:1:5 a. m. yes- j
erday he sighted part of a log raft three
miles west northwest of Pigeon Point. It |
was 400 feet long and was breaking up
gradually. This is probably the portion of
the raft which broke away from the Pro
greso off Coos Bay.
The lfghthouse engineer has issued the :
following notice to mariners : "The. sub- j
marine mines at the entrance to the har- '
bor of San Diego, Cal., and the buoys ;
marking the open channel to the south- !
ward of Ballast Point have been taken up
and the channel is now clear. Vessels '
can pass in or out at all times, day or i
night. _________^__
THE TRANSPORTS EXPECTED.
The Senator. Indiana, Ohio and New
port Should Arrive This Week.
The transport Senator should arrive I
here to-day from Honolulu, where she 1
stopped for repairs and to have her boil- :
ers cleaned. She has been expected for j
several days and it is therefore thought
that the re-pairs must have taken longer |
than was at first anticipated. It was re
puted that no great damage was done
the Senator by the typhoon that she ex
perienced beyond the carrying away of
her forward railing.
The Indiana. Ohio and Newport are |
also expected here this week. Th^se four J
erf the only transports that are any
where near due. and they are about in |
shape to make a return trip without any
delay. The Senator can be ready in
three days after she arrives to sail, and
It is therefore possible that some of the
troops may get away this week, although
it Is more probable that the Senator vill
be held until the Indiana and thp rest are
ready, in which case none of the troops
will be gotten away before pome time
next week. These four transports will
carry certainly three regiments. No one
knows in just what order the troops will
be dispatched. This matter will In all
probability be turnod over to General
Miller by General Merriam, or at least
the recommendations of the former will
be accepted by the latter. At present
General Miller has not given the matter
any consideration.
Major John Carr, First Washington,
has been relieved from duty with the bat
talion with which he has been serving
and ordered to report to his regimental
commander for duty.
Private Harry Scott. Company X,
Fifty-first lowa Regiment, died at the
division hospital yesterday of meningitis.
A HOME FOR BOYS.
The Eureka Society Establishes a
Branch to Its Charitable Work.
The directors of the Eureka Society
for the Protection of Children has estab- 1
lished another home for young boys, to
be known as the Eureka Boys' Home.
Quarters have been obtained at 3262 Twen
ty-fifth street. It will be presided over
by Mrs. H. E. Reed as matron. The di
rectorate has been organized as follows:
President, Mrs. John Pettee; vice presi- j
dent and manager, Mrs. B. C. Brower; j
treasurer, Mrs. M. Hainque; directors â
Miss May B. Wilkins. Mrs. T. R. Hamil- j
ton and Miss Aggie Ahem. E. L. Wad- i
ham will act as secretary. The home was I
created for the purpose of providing tem
porary shelter for boys up to 14 years
of age; also as a permanent home for a
limited number of lads, who will be
taught Borne of the useful trades and
given the rudiments of an education.
When necessary girls will be taken In
until they can be better provided for.

SOLDIERS IN DOUBT.
General Merriam Will Decide the
Fate of ths Seventh Regiment
This Week.
The situation in the Seventh Regiment
remains unchanged. Colonel Berry was
busy all day Saturday indorsing the ap
plications of the men for discharge, and
he stated that he hoped to get them all
In to General Miller yesterday. From tha
division commander they will be sent up
to General Merriam. and nothing definite
will be done until he has Tormally acted
in the matter. In the meantime, as pre
dicted in The Call, no one seems to think
that the regiment will go to Manila, but
rather that when General Meriam finds
what a very large percentage of the men
desire to leave the service he will recom
mend that the regiment be mustered out.
It is certain that whatever he may recom
mend in the matter will be done by the
War Department.
The Botkin Extradition Case.
Chief Lees will present the revised pa
pers for the extradition of Mrs. Cordelia
Botkin to Governor Budd at noon to-day
if the Governor should reach the city this
morning. It Is not positively certain
whether he will be in the city to-day.

THE .SAN FRANCISCO CALL., MONDAY, OCTOBER 3, 1898.
SACRED FEAST OF THE ROSARY.
Impressive Ceremony Observed at St. Dominie's
Churchâ Pilgrimage in Honor of the Virgin.
WITH a gigantic burst of harmony
from the great organ, blended
with a glorious volume of vocal
and instrumental music, the annual
Feast of the Rosary was solemnly usher
ed in yesterday morning at St. Dominic's
Church.
As the celebrant of the mass with his
assistants issued from the sacristy to
the sanctuary, robed in the garments of
the altar and bearing the sacred vessels
aloft, they were met with a burst of
sound that- filled the air and strove for
another existence in the echo whfch im
mediately followed. This was the first
actual test of the great instrument, and
it proved a success.
The principal ceremony had a dual pur
pose. It commemorated not only the
Feast of the Rosary in honor of the Vir
gin, but also dedicated the great instru
ment in the loft above to the service and
the glory of God.
The festivities in honor of the feast con
sisted in the celebration of solemn high
mass and a procession or pilgramage
around the entire block immediately af
ter. During the progress of rna?s, in
addition to the organ accompaniment,
the Tivoli Orchestra was heard In beauti
ful harmony with the great organ.
The mass was celebrated by the priests
of the Dominican community. All
through its progress the Archbishop oc
cupied an improvised throne, specially
erected for the occasion in the sanctuary

Upon the Plan of the

BpÂ«clal Dispatch to The Call.
VALLEJO, Oct. 2.â Mare Island can
be said to resemble a hive of industry,
there being nearly 1800 men on the
rolls. There Is some question as to
the work keeping up, however, as two
of the ships now at yard (the Adams
and Yorktown) will be placed in com
mission during October.
The plans and specifications for the
new officers' quarters are about com
pleted, though no positive word con
cerning the work has been received
from Chief of the Bureau of Yards and
Docks. The repairs to the shops and
store houses damaged by the earth
quake are approaching completion and
unless there are orders to have some
of the new .buildings erected by the
navy yard force there is danger of a
lay-off in the yards and docks depart
ment before the end of the year. *
The Hartford is ready to come out of
the duck, her rudder having been put
in during the past week. Her sea valves
have been placed and she will be taken
out whenever the dock Is required for
another vessel. The work of covering
her boilers with non-conducting mater
ials was finished to-day and one of
them has been secured In place. The
others will be secured next week and
the boiler-makers will then put up the
uptake and smokestack. When this is
done the construction department can
go ahead with its work which has been
awaiting the installation of this por
tion of the motive power.
The Adams will go Into commission
next week, as soon aB the crew of the
Mohican finishes the work of stripping
that vessel and is ready to be trans
ferred. The Adams is ready for a
cruise now, with the exception of her
modern battery, which has not arrived
from the East. Her gun deck is a
model of convenience and comfort.
The Alert is being stripped, to the
immediately to the left of the high altar.
The assistants to the Archbishop were
also chosen from the Dominican clergy.
They occupied seats of honor on both
sides of the throne.
The panegyric on the life and work of
the Virgin was pronounced by Father
Newell O. P. In it he paid the highest
tribute to the mother of the Redeemer
and traced the origin of the Feast of the
Rosary back to the tenth century and to
the time when it was first called Into
existence by a Dominican priest.
At the conclusion of the mass the Arch
bishop invoked a blessing upon the con
gregation, which ceremony terminated
the religious services in the church
I ' r Th > ce r altars, particularly that erected to
the Virgin, situated to the left of the
main altar, was beautifully decorated.
Myriads of flickering candles formed a
mass of reflected light and color in the
background of the pure wftlte marble be
hind. Exotic growths and the rarest of
flowers were artistically arranged on the
steps and the available space directly in
front of the side altars. Intertwined be
tween the candles and the golden can
delabra were long and delicate streamers
of smilax. The Archbishop's throne was
beautifully decorated with white and pink
satin, the draping of the canopy above
consisting entirely of the latter material.
The procession or pilgrimage of the dif
ferent associate societies of the church
extended around the entire block bounded
by Steiner, Pine, Pierce and Bush streets.
Bhell, preparatory to rebuilding upon
the same lines as the Ranger. These
vessels will be very useful for cruising
purposes in Asiatic waters, as they
will make good time with very little
coal consumption.
The Yorktown is well along and will
be ready to go Into commission toward
the end of this month.
The Albatross has been painted
white. Her masts, spars and smoke
stack are receiving a coat of the regu
lation stÂ»aw color. There is consider
able work yet to be done before the
Albatross assumes her ante-bellum
beauty. The Navy Department will
pay all the costs of putting her Into
first-class condition.
MARK STROUSE HONORED
IN DEATH BY MASONS
IMPRESSIVE SERVICES HELD
IN THE TEMPLE.
Eloquent Rabbi Jacob Voorsanger
Pays Tribute to the Worth, of
the Late Merchant.
Sorrowing relatives and friends paid
their last marks of respect to the late
Mark Strouse at Masonic Temple yester
day. The impressive burial service of the
order was conducted by C. P. Kispert,
senior warden, in the absence of P. J.
Ashford, master of South San Francisco
Lodge, of which decedent was a member.
He was assisted by H. F. Rahlmann, jun
ior warden.
The temple was thronged with men and
women who knew the dead man in his
Hfe time. Evidences of their remem
brance were seen in the mass of flowers,
those outward manifestations of sorrow
and of sympathy. Rabbi Jacob Voor
sanger, of Temple Emanu-El, paid a trib
ute to the worth of Mr. Strouse, both to
those who were of his flesh and blood and
also to those who met him in public life.
For decedent there were words of praise
of his true life and good deeds, and for
those he left behind words of sympathy
and hope. . â , _
The music under the direction of Or
ganist S. D. Mayer and the Masonic quar
tet was in keeping with the solemnity
of the occasion.
The pallbearers were chosen from
among the societies with which in his life
time Mr. Strouse was Identified, the. Ma
sons, Foresters and Veteran Firemen.
Interment took place at Odd Fellows'
Cemetery in the family vault.

Elanned for a relief from business carea,
ut the spirit of action took possession
of him when the metropolis was reached
and a great deal of interesting business
was transacted.
San Francisco is no longer the tabooed
city, as the attractions Sir. Friedlander
has secured will attest. First of all, the
foremost company in America will be seen
again over the Baldwin footlights. Au
gustin Daly's complete company, with
Ada Rehan at the head, will visit this
city some time in May for a four weeks'
engagement, during which the latest New
York successes will be presented.
As was published in The Call, Charles
Frohman, the mighty, had repented his
rash criticisms on the theatrical possibili
ties of San Francisco from the financial
standpoint, and now, to show his com
plete recantation, he will send out his
ver,y best companies in their original
strength. Belasco's new play, an adapta
tion from the French, "Zaza." now a
reigning success in Paris, will be pro
duced in this city. Mrs. Leslie Carter will
head the company.
"Why Smith Left Home," one of the
latest comedies of the season, will be pro
duced by George Broadhurst's company at
the Columbia.
Sol Smith Russell, In new plays, will
come to the Baldwin for a season of seven
weeks.
The Empire Theater company Intact
will give "Secret Service" at the Baldwin.
One of the biggest attractions booked is
the "Sign of the Cross." produced in Lon
don by \Vilson Barrett.
Mr. Friedlander announces three musi
cal cards during the season. Terese Ca
rene, the great pianist; Godfrey's Royal
English band, and Sousa with his band.
Opera has not been neglected. The In
ternational Grand Opera Company, now
being formed in New York, will visit this
city for a long engagement. Clementine
de Vere will be at the head of the organ
ization. The tenor. Salve Panbranchi,
will come directly from Italy. Mme. Kro
hold Koert will be the soprano, Signor
Vlrgilie Bellatti of the San Carlo Opera
House of Lisbon will be the barytone and
Signor Dado, originally with the Maple
son opero company, basso; R. Sapie, a
prominent musician, will be the musical
director. The chorus and orchestra win
be exceptionally large.
Verein Eintracht Picnic.
The second picnic and moonlight festi
val of the season of the Verein Eintracht
was held yesterday. While the weather
kept some away there were still enough
for a good time. The wheel of fortune at
tracted not a few, who were well pleased
with their prizes. Dancing, however,
was the main feature. The chill of the
evening was not felt because Captain L.
Siebe had inclosed the sides of the pa
vilion. The affair was under the direc
tion of the following committee of ar
rangements: President A. Becker, Vice
President Charles Rehn, Otto Thile. Otto
Lemeke, F. Hoffinghoff.
Suicide While Demented.
John Burke, a piano polisher, employed
at 850 Harrison street, was found dead at
8 o'clock Saturday morning' in the office
of the establishment with the pas turned
on. Burke had been on a spree, and was
demented when he committed the act.
He was a native of Ireland. 53 years old,
and has a married daughter in this city.

BRACES BODY AND BRAIN.
What Mariani Wine Does to Soothe,
Strengthen and Sustain the
System.
Vln Mariani (Marianl Wine) is
recommended as a tonic by the med-
ical profession all over the world. It
has received written recommendations
from more than 8000 American physi-
cians. |
Mariani Wine soothes, strengthens
and sustains the system and braces
body and brain. It gives strength:
therefore may it be described as the
conqueror of disease and the promoter,
of health and longevity.
Mariani Wine is specially indicated
for malaria, fever and ague and all
miasmatic fevers. It promptly dispels
chills, abates malarial fever, and elves
a sense of buoyancy and vigor.
Mariani Wine is furthermore of es-
pecial value in cases of Neuralgia, Ner-
vous Debility, Muscular Relaxation.
Mental and Physical Depression and
Exhaustion, 0.-erwork \or Overstrain.
Insomnia, Headache, Nervous Dyspep-
sia, Loss of Appetite, Emaciation and
Consumption. It builds up the vital
forces and is a powerful rejuvenator. It
gives strength to the nervous system,
firmness and elasticity to the muscles,
and richness to the blood. It benefits
all.
Mariani Wine is palatable and suited
to the most delicate stomachs. In the
cases of pale, puny, sickly children it
is invariably used with great benefit.
For overworked men and delicate
women Mariani Wine works wonders.
Marani Wine is sold by all Druggists.
Try it and you will find that It will well
sustain its reputation. One word of â¢
caution, howeverâ let no representation
or explanation induce you to accept a
substitute. "Just as good" usually
leads to disappointment.
To every one writing to Mariani &
Co., 52 West Fifteenth street. New
York City, will be sent, free, if this
paper is mentioned, an interesting lit-
tle book containing portraits and auto-
graphs of Emperors, Empress, Princes,
Cardinals, Archbishops and other dis-
tinguished personages, endorsing Via
Mariani. ___^____^__

WANDERINGS OF
A MOTHERLESS
BABY GIRL
Her Parent Died on a
River Steamer.
NO ONE WANTED THE TOT
TAKEN TO KOTZEBUE ON THE
BARK HAYDEN BROWN.
Meanwhile Her Father Had Given Up
Gold Hunting and Was Search
ing All Over the Country
for His Child.
Captain George A. Hatfleld of the de
funct Alaska-Juneau Transportation
Company is back from St. Michael. He
went up there early in the spring to look
after the company's interests, but with
the loss of the river steamer James Eva
the troubles of the concern began and the
gallant old shipmaster was in hot water
from morning to night He finally got
everything straightened out and returned
to San Francisco last Saturday. The Brit
ish ship Lancing, of which he was for
merly master and part owner, 1? now on
her way here in command of his son-in
law and the chances are that he will re
sume command of her when she arrives.
"St. Michael is a very healthy place."
said the captain yesterday. "Over 2000
people will winter there and nearly three
times that number lived there for a time
during the rush and yet there are only
three graves in the burial ground. In one
of them the mate of the river steamer 11.
A Burr was buried. He committed sui
cide by shooting himself through the
head. In another we placed the remains
of a gold hunter who was returning from
Dawson to San Francisco in search of
health, and in the other one we placed
the remains of a wife and mother.
"As near as I could get at them, the
facts cf the woman's death and the wan
derings of her year-old child are about as
follows: C. E. Sohultze went to the
Klondike to make his fortune. His wife
accompanied him. A year ago she gave
birth to a little girl, but never fully re
covered. "When the river opened last
June Schultze determined to send his wife
to San Francisco in the hopes that the
change would do her good. She started
for St. Michael on the river steamer
Hamilton, but that vesel broke her back
on a sandbar and all the pasengers had
to be transferred to the P. B. Weare.
This aggravated Mrs. Schultze's illness
and on July 4 last she died.
"When the news of her death reached
the miners on the steamer they at once
raised a purse for the child and the ex
penses of the funeral. The body was
brought to St. Michael and buried. Then
the question of what to do with the child
arose. The women at St. Michael were
nearly all bound for the gold fields and
no one wanted to have anything to do
with the little one.
"About this time the bark Hayden
Brown arrived in port and as the mate
â was accompanied by his wife, the case
was laid before that lady. She took a
great fancy to the little one and at once
agreed to adopt it. Accordingly, when
the Hayden Brown sailed for Kotzebue
Sound the little girl went along as the
adopted daughter of the first mate.
"In the meantime the news of the death
of Mrs. Schultze had reached Dawson
and the husband came down the river
post haste to claim hia child. On his ar
rival he found her gone and also found
that United States Commissioner Shep
hard ,had entered into an agreement with
the mate and his wife by which in the
event of the child being claimed they
were to get $15 a month for the time they
took care of it. The husband was mad
clean through and told Commissioner
Shephard what he thought of him in very
forcible language. He vowed vengeance
and swore to have justice If it .was to be
found in the courts of the land. He
pointed out that there were plenty of
funds available to provide for the child
while he was being communicated with
and that it was a high-handed proceeding
to give his child away to the first person
who wanted it.
"â Well, the end of the matter was that
the commissioner paid the man's fare to
Dawson and he left intending to settle up
his business and go out over the" Chilcoot
Pass and await the arrival of the Hayden
Brown at Seattle.
"A couple of days after Schultze left St.
Michael the Hayden Brown returned to
port. The little giri was hale and hearty
and everybody was glad to see her. The
condensed milk gave out on the passage
up and at Kotzebue an Indian woman had
to be pressed into service as a foster
mother. The Indian woman took quite a
fancy to the child and tried to steal it.
She was gone nearly an hour before her
flight was discovered and then everybody
on the ship started out to look for her.
She was finally run to earth at an Indian
village ten miles away and the child was
brought back in triumph. The commis
sioner decided to leave the child with the
mate of the Hayden Brown, but both he
and his wife agreed to give the little one
up as soon as it was claimed.
"There are over 10,000 tons of provisions
stored at St. Michael, so there will be
no starvation there this winter. If the
gold hunters on Kotzebue Sound are not
successful I expect a great many of them
will cross over to St. Michael and come
down in the spring. As soon as the river
opens next year all the goods stored on
the island will be rushed up to Dawson.
There are two large hotels at St. Mi
chael and they did a land office business
during the rush. As for me, I have had
all the Klondike I want."
NATIONAL GUARD
OF CALIFORNIA
REHABILITATION OF THE FIRST
AND FIFTH REGIMENTS.
Surgeon General Hopkins Has Re
signed and Is Succeeded by Col
onel Gallwey â New Hope
iw Naval Militia,
The outlook at this time for the reor
ganization of the First and the Fifth
Regiments of Infantry of the National
Guard is much brighter than it has been
at any time since the war with Spain.
Adjutant General Barrett, who. to-mor
row, will leave in company with Colonel
Burgin, inspector of rifle practice j for
"Washington, D. C, to present tho war
claim of the State of California to the
"War Department, has left the matter of
reorganization to Major General Dickin- '
son and Brigadier General Warfleld. !
Major Jansen, brigade inspector of the
Second Brigade, has been instructed to
hasten the presentation of the petitions
from those who wish to Join the regi
ments named. He will suggest that as
some of the companies have already
handed in their petitions such be
mustered in at once without waiting until
all the petitions are in. following the >
plan that was adopted in mustering !
the volunteers during the early part of j
the war. This, it Is expected, will arouse ;
the enthusiasm among those who want
to become National Guardsmen, brit who
of late have been somewhat apathetic.
"Let the young men who want to join see
that we mean business," said the major,
"and, my word for It, they will come in
with a rush." â 
The men who present themselves will
be subjected to an examination, physically, |
almost as strict as was adopted in the
mustering of the volunteers, as it is the
purpose of having as good a class of men,
physically, as can be secured.
Company L of the First has already
handed in its petition. Companies C and
G and and X, all located in the Ellis
street armory, will be ready to turn In
theirs during the next ten days. Com
pany B has also presented its list, while
Companies H, A and I are almost ready
to make a showing. Companies E and M
have been rather slow and it Is stated
that if, in the language of the day, they
' â â â â â â -â â¢--â â â â â .
do not "get a move on," others -who are
; willing to Join will be given an oppor
tunity to do so and the two companies
will be left out in the cold. Company 1>
announced that its petition will be in dur
ing the early part of the coming week.
Company F of the Fifth has handed in
Its list of petitioners and it is expected
that in a few days all the other com
panies of the regiment wil have their pa
pers ready to present. _ ,
Colonel Cluff, adjutant on the staff of
tho division commander, has gone l
on a thirty days' leave of absence, and in
his absence. Major Schmitt of the same
staff is attending to the duties of that
office.
The division commander has ordered a
new set of records for his office. One rec
ord will contain the names ef all the
commissioned officers, with a succinct
history of each. In another there will be
a complete roster of every non-commis
sioned officer and enlisted man in the
with such official data as will give
at a glance the standing of each man,
aud a third will contain all monthly,
quarterly and semi-annual reports and
the inspection reports. An effort will be |
made to have all company, regimental
and brigade books to correspond with the
records at division headquarters, so in
future there will not be any confusion In
making up reports.
SurÂ»eon W. E. Hopkins, surgeon gen
eral on the staff of the commander In
chief tendered his resignation to enable
him to go on a two or three years tour
of the world. It was accepted, and Dr.
John Gallwey, surgeon on the division
ttafT has been promoted by appointment
to fill the vacancy. As yet no one has
been appointed to the vacancy caused by
the promotion of Colonel Gallwey. Colonel j
Hopkins was appointed May 2T>. His pre- i
vlous service was in the United States i
Medical Corps from 1882 until 1890, when he J
resigned. Colonel Gallwey was appointed
on the division staff July *i, 189*3. His
service in the National Guard previous to
that was as major and surgeon of the
Fir*t Infantry from l.Â« 91 to l^C.
Private C. P. Seymour has been ap
pointed corporal of the signal corps of the |
Second Brfrade, and W. H. Scott has ;
been appointed lance corporal of the same
corps.
Philip C. Knapp. one of the five who en- |
listed from the signal corps of the Second
Brigade Into the Volunteer Signal Corps
that went to Manila, has beÂ«n promoted
to sergeant of the first class. Sergeant i
Knapp Is an active, conscientious soldier. :
and withal a perfect gentleman. The pro
motion was a dewrvod one.
Now that all the officers of the Naval
Militia have returned to their several
posts of duty a renewed spirit In the !
ranks has been noticed during the past
week. There has b^en a larger attend
ance at ihr- drill* and there is a desire to
l.lace thÂ«> organization in the front again.
' The suptrestlon that bus been made ;
that the Naval Militia should be taken
from the States and placed under the ,
care of the Navy Department as a naval ,
reserve or auxiliary navy hns been the
talk of officers and men during 'he past j
few days, and it meets with their full j
approbation. Should this come to pass ;
the men would be assigned to modern |
men-of-war and In a short time they
wouM become up to date In the art of na- i
val warfare, and would be In a condition !
to be assigned to duty at a moment's no- j
tlce in case of need.

Sausalito on the beginning of the flood
tide and set sail for the upper bay: Vice
Commodore G. T. S. "White's sloop Will o'
the "Wisp, Commodore T. I* Hill's ."loop
Cygnus, A. Sutherland's sloop Catherine, ;
J. R. Savory's sloop Juanlta, and L. Q. I
Haven's sloop Sappho. The wind was j
light, but at various times between 10 and
11 the yachts dropped anchor ofT the
larger island of the Marin group. Visits
were paid to the flagship and then the
crews of all the yachts went on board the
sloop Sappho, where a good time was en-
Joyed until after 1 on Sunday morning.
Somewhere between 3 and 4 in the
morning the wind, which had been from
the north on Saturday night, chopped
round to the southwest, and soon the
yachts were roiling and tossing In a
heavy sea. Commodore Hill got up sail,
intending to seek a calmer anchorage, but
after nearly losing his yawl and getting |
himself and his crew drenched In the
pouring rain he abandoned the attempt.
The Sappho left her first anchorage and
dropped her hook again at a considerable
distance from the shore. _
After a few hours, however, the sky j
cleared and the yachtsmen Trent ashore
to prepare for the clambake. Clams,
green corn and sweet potatoes were sat
isfactorily cooked in an improvised oven, .
and all set to with good appetites. Later
the crew of the Corinthian yacht Cupid
joined their brethren of the San Fran
cisco Yacht Club. I
After the feast an early Etart was made
for home, and Sausallto was reached ,
about 4 in the afternoon.
The Corinthians started from Tiburon
Cove on Saturday evening and anchored
in Paradise Cove. A big camp fire was .
built and hot chowder prepared. Oscar ,
Franks Frank Thompson and others en- ,
tertained the party by their singing and ;
the Nouman brothers by their guitar
playing round the camp fire until an
early hour on Sunday morning. About
noon the yachts got under way and
cruised up in the direction of McXear's.
A good breeze brought the boats home in
good time. The cruise was very success
ful and well attended, the following
yachts accompanying Commodore Carl j
Westerfeld's flag ship Aeolus: ex-Com
modore J. W. Pew's sloop Truant, ex-
Commodore "Joe" Tracy's sloop Secret,
Secretary E. B. Lathrop's Pride, ex-
Commodore A. J. Young's sloop Clara,
ex-Commodore George Billings Nixie,
Frank Bartletfs sloop Queen. P. W.
Hurndall's â  sloop Merope, Breitzmann
Brothers' sloop Cupid, the yawls Spray, j
Nereid and Arcturus, ami the sloops |
Edna, Em! lie, Fred*. Lapwing, Wave,
Rover. Amigo, Mlgnon. Thetis, Lmma
and Ceres. The new boat just built by
Frank Stone of Tiburon for : Hobron of
Honolulu was also out.
Only one mishap attended- the cruise. :
The yawl Arcturus collided with the
sloop Truant, the yawl's Jigger boom was
broken, but no serious injury was done.
The closing days of the various yacht
clubs occur during the present month,
but up to date the yachtsmen show no
â¢signs of lack of enthusiasm. Indeed, the
San Franclscos follow their commodore ;
better than they did earlier in the season.
The San Francisco* are about to lose
one enthusiastic member and good
yachtsman. A. D. Naylor of the sloop
Twilight is about to leave for the Port
land branch of Balfour. Guthrie & Co. As
he is one of the delegates to the Inter-
Club Association, the San Franciscos will
have to appoint a new delegate to take
his place. â  '
OUT FOR THE STUFF.
Canadian Authorities Practice Gross
Extortion on the Miners in
in the North.
J. D. Glbbs of this city has Just re
turned from an extended tour through
Alaska and the Klondike territory. While
there he located several claims In the
Atlin Lake mining district, and says that
the recent discoveries in that portion of
the gold-bearing region have caused a
ftneral stampede of miners from the
>y<-a-Skaguay district.
Mr. Gibbs says the Canadian authori
ties are the wr*r?t proposition on earth
for gross, high-handed robbery. The min
ers are handicapped at every turn unless
they hand out exorbitant side fees to the j
officials. At bo rapid a pace has this sort i
of thing been carried on, he says, that
there will be a clash between the authori
ties and the miners this winter unless
methods are rectified. The arrival of a
commissioner, who has been sent by the
Government to ptralghten matters out,
may have the desired effect.
"i met men who possessed all the bold,
fearless qualities of the typical miner,
before they stepped on Canadian soil,"
said the Klondlker, "but now they walk
around wearing a pinched, wan expres
sion, which comes from a constant fear
that at any hour their titles to their
claims may be taken frOm them on some
legal technicality, or for some slight
transgression they may find their prop
erty confiscated."

ENGLISH DOG
FOR FREEDOM
STILL UNBEATEN
Rosette Unable to Do
the Needed Trick.
WINS IN STRAIGHT HEATS
UNION PARK CROWDED WITH
SPECTATORS.
Mac's Melody Captures the Produce
Stake at Ingleside â Exciting
Courses Witnessed by
Thousands.
For Freedom, the speedy importation of
J. H. Rosslter, proved himself still pos
sessed of speed and endurance yesterday
by handily defeating Curtis & Son's black
and white bitch Rosette in two straight
heats. The race attracted nearly five
thousand spectators to Union Park, three
fourths of whom bet on the result of the
match race or picked winners and losers
in the large number of courses run till
dark.
The day was an ideal one for the sport.
Not only was there a briskness in the
atmosphere, but the ground, packed by
the overnight rain and dried by the warm
sunshine, made splendid footing for the
dogs. Not a fluke race was recorded during
the running of the large card, the dogs
winning on their merits alone. Long
courses, grilling courses and twisting
courses were witnessed by the large
crowd and enthusiasm reigned.
As Rosette and For Fredom were led
to their slips for their initial race, their
lithe and muscular bodies, glossy from
the care of their trainers, the crowd
surged to the fence and cheered the dumb
but intelligent animals. Both were In
the finest condition and fit to make a
great race. The dogs were slipped to a
good hare. For Freedom's tremendous
bound gave him a lead in the first twenty
yards and when he reached the prey he
was fully four lengths ahead of his rival.
The English dog cleverly held his
ground until the hare swerved toward i
Rosette, when he shot in front of her and !
nipped the point from Rosette, finishing
the course in his usual brilliant style.
The betting was 5 to 2, with For Freedom
the favorite.
The second race was a repetition of the
first try with the exception that Rosette
improved in her running. For Freedom
led to the prey and gained many points
before Rosette took advantage of a |
wrench and grabbed the little "Jack." i
Judge Bull thought -it was over and |
signaled his red handkerchief, giving For I
Freedom for victory. The crowd was then !
surprised to Bee the hare making for the !
escapes with the "rivals again in hot pur
suit. For Freedom was not to be denied
this time, for he crunched the hare in his
powerful Jaws.
In the opening stake the "short enders" '
had things their war. the following "long '
shots" raising the flag: Montanu, beat '
Highland Ball at 5 to 2. Sandow beat
Eclipse at 6 to 1. Counterfeit beat Santa :
Alicia at 3 to 1, Breach of Promise beat !
Left Bower at 5 to 3 and Wayfarer beat i
Jennie Wilson at 5 to 4.
The course between Eclipse and Sandow
was a startling one. The hare proved an
ideal dodger and led the dogs around the â 
field and the judge's horse for nearly j
three minutes. The score must have been |
a heavy one, judging by the number of :
turns made. Sandow did most of the
work and won the flag, gratifying the
"shortenders" and disappointing the
"talent."
Van Cloie ran well during the day. Her
long course with Moonlight was a featnrt,
but hurt her chances In the next round.
The course between Wayfarer and Jen
nie Wilson was the prettiest of the day. i
In the long race across the field neither j
showed any advantage until close to the ;
hare, when Wayfarer Jumped in the lead ,
and had things his own way.
Van Napp and Glen Rosa had a gruel- ;
Ing course after a dodging hare. Van
Napp showed the best quality at the
start but Glen Rosa's staying powers
gained her the flag.
Van dole was unfortunate In getting
away from her trainer previous to her
course with Hercules, and to save her i
from fagging. Mr. Rossiter ordered his j
trainer to leave For Freedom loose. Al
though this was after his match race the
Nonpareil went out and gained the kill.
In the puppy stake Candelarla beat \
Motto at 5 to 3 and Magneto beat Gold i
Hill at the same odds.
p A McComb and Curtis & Son divided
the' puppy and all-aged stake between
them with Royal Flush and Flush, Mc-
Kinley and Cavalier.

MAC'S MELODY WINS
THE PRODUCE STAKE
Several Thousand Spectators Wit
nessed Her Victory at Ingleside
Yesterday.
The great Produce stake given by the
Ingleside Coursing Club was won yester
day in the presence of several thousand
people by Mac's Melody, owned by Bar- j
tele Bros. She gave a great performance ,
and in every course defeated her company
in handy fashion. She bested Victor King
in the finals with a number of points to
spare, and in her race with Statesman
she showed both more foot and cleverness
than the son of Skyrocket. Retina, the
g-ood thing that has been watched by the
early birds at the park in her "work
outs," was defeated by St. Gertrude in
her second course yesterday, but she is
a very promising bitch and will no doubt
be soon a good breadwinner.
There were four stakes decided at tne
park yesterday, and throughout the day
the grand stand and betting ring were
crowded to inconvenience by lovers of the
sport, who were willing to back their con
victions by hard cash. The Produce Con
solation stake went to Liberty . Nell, and (
richly he deserved it, as his trainer sent >
him into the field in first class condition j
to make the race for his life, and as it j
happened in the finals condition .old and
Liberty Bell defeated Flying Faster after
the latter dog did all the scoring in the
early part of the course.
Hadlwist's owner can place another
pair of brackets around hfs dog's name,
as he captured the open stake, defeating
that good little bitch Patria. after she ;
had done another terrible hard day s |
work. Hadlwist should certainly have
won on form, as he Is old and wise, and
never runs wild, but yet the betting public j
decided otherwise, and in the finals Patria ]
after her hard work was selected favorite.
Hadiwist led up and did nearly all the
scoring, much to the delight of the short- ;
enders, who were enabled to cash again
on the old dog at the nice odds of 2 to 1. â¢
The open consolation stake went to
Meroury, as Seminole was withdrawn by
his owner on account of his being not lit
to run the finals, but old Dakota made
it quite .interesting for a time and was
only shut out by Mercury in the third
Among the short-enders that won were
Liberty Bell at 2 to 1, Victor at 3 to 1 and :
Thad Stevens. Bit of Fashion, Hying
Faster and Victor, all at a few shades
over even money. A peculiar Incident of ,
the day was that in the first twenty-four j
courses twenty-one of the hounds run- j
ning on the white flag won in succession. ,
The results were as follows:

A NEW PACIFIC LINE.
Meaning of the Present Visit of Dr.
Wiegand, Manager of the North
German Lloyd.
Dr. Wie grand, general manager of the
North German Lloyd, is now. in this city,
en route to Japan, where he will iook Into
the Oriental connections of the North
German Lloyd Steamship Company. Dr.
Wiegantl is acqompanied by his secretary,
Z. Grave, and dustave A. Schwab of the
firm of Oelrionri <& Co., American agents
for the North German Lloyd.
The trip is full of significance. Dr. Wle
gand did not remain any length of time
in New York, but came to this city at
once. He will be here some days, devot
ing most of his time to the examination
of existing- conditions In regard to steam
ship traffic. It is rumored -that the North
German Lloyd ...tends to establish an
other line from San Francisco to Japan,
and that this is the object of the visit of
the manager. At any rate Dr. Wiegand
will make a complete investigation while
in this city and in Japan. The possibility
of a line from Victoria to Japan is more
remote than from this city to the Orient.
In Japan and China the North German
Lloyd has vast business interests. In
September of 1899 a fortnightly i.ne will
be put on from uremen to Japan and
China, instead of the monthly line which
is operating at present. It is known that
the big Bremen Company has been con
templating the establishment of a line
across the Pacific, and this is no doubt
the reason for the manager's present
trip.
HAS GONE TO WASHINGTON.
General Barrett Will Settle Califor*
nia's Claim for Military
Expenses.
Adjutant General Barrett, accompanied
by Colonel Burgin of the Governor's staff,
left last night for Washington, where the
general goes to make a settlement with
the Government for all expenses occurred
in the mustering of the National Guard
into the volunteer service. The State
of California has a claim against the
Government for about $130,000. of this
amount $67,000 is for supplies furnished
the Government by the quartermaster's
and ordnance departments, the remainder
is expense incident to the mustering in of
the State troops, of which the item of
transportation is exceedingly large. Gen
eral Barrett expects to be gone about a
month.

LEARNS SOME
NEW TRICKS
Politics Without Any
Precedent.
THE PURISTS MAKE HISTORY
-INDEPENDENT REPUBLICANS"
ARE A PUZZLE.
Frank Jordan Very Carefully Con
tributed a Chapter to the
Novelty of the Interesting
Situation.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 2.
As usual, there is a tendency to turn the
fall campaign in this county into onÂ© of
personality rather than party. Individ
uals and not party principles are coming
to the front rapidly, and the ballot which
the voter will have to study will contain
more names than were ever presented to
the electorate on this side of the bay.
There have already been nine conventions
held, each of which has put up a whole
ticket or a part of a ticket. These ninÂ«
aggregations are the Non-Fusion Popu
lists, Independent Republicans, Socialist
Labor party. Republicans, Prohibitionists.
Fusion Populists. Democrats and Silver
Republicans. In addition to these are nu
merous independent candidates, and be
tween them all it is a Chinese puzzle to
distinguish a party demarkatton.
There is one issue between the city and
the county; one between one branch of
the old American Protective Association
and another branch; an Issue between
friends of Hilborn and Metcalf; an issue
between slaters and non-slaters; issue be
tween the young men and the veteran ele
ments; an issue betwen stalwarts and re
:' rmers and purists; an issue between
successful candidates and soreheads; and
all of these apply with equal force to each
. : the multitude of parties, and conse
quently the total number of such "issues"
to be decided at the election is more than
legion. This is why the people are look-
Ing in vain for the old party lines. *
Many innovations in the methods of
calling and conducting a political conven
â  ere learned Friday uight. It was a
ac VoUairea.il exhibition â everything
Â»m down, but little was built. The
â¢ andro convention was blasted from
the platform, in the platform and on the
The Independents even went far
they tore v> pieces the primaries at
which the San Leandro delegates were
elected. Everything wus wrong, wicked,
ipt and deserving of contempt; but
everything tha L the Independents did or
mid was absolutely right, clean, incor
ruptible and deserving of public confi
dence. It was a revelation to the lobby
to see those well known "Republican" re
formers, Johnny Teague, Walter Burwell,
who was a vice president cf the Maguire
demonstration two weeks ago; Hugh S.
Aldrich John McLeod, who was beaten
in the Democratic convent Ton for Sheriff
a week since; R. H. Larsen, C. A. Sco
viile and others, busy on the floor of the
convention purifying the Republican
party. In his opening speech V. S. North
ey declared In enormous tones that it was
to be a Btrictly Republican convention,
und no one nominated or even connected
with the San Leandro convention was to
rece iv e a particle of support from the au
gust body in Germania Hall. Somehow
or other ' the convention went to pieces
immediately after this great speech, for a
Democrat was nominated for County-
Clerk a Populist was placed in nomina
tor Sheriff, a Populist for Assessor,
a ProhiMtionist for Tax Collector, a Pro
hibitionist for District Attorney, a Popu
r Public Administrator and one or
two Republicans for other offices, while
Democrats or Populists were Indorsed for
Supervisors and the Legislature.
Another entirely new feature in politics
wa.- the method of taking the vote that
was adopted. The chairman declared
here were no proxies, yet out of the
legates called about lX) attended
and in the vote for Coroner there were 260
ts cast. There were but two dele
present from Alameda, yet the En
cinal City voted "twenty-five solid" every
time a ballot was taken. There was not
a single delegate from Washington Town-
D one occasion somebody voted
titeen solid" for somebody, and it
went, as did many other remarkable fea
tures <,f the ri-markahle gathering.
Just why the convention should have
declared itself an independent Republican
convention is not yet clf-ar, for many of
the delegates and candidates had already
knocked at the doors of more or less of
the eifrht previous onventlons, and being
pointed in every lr.siunoe, had de-
I to organize a convention to which
they could open the door for themselves.
Of course there were many good, consci
entious Republicans in the convention,
men who undoubtedly believed that there
Is a demand for a reform in the party
ranks. To a certain extent such a belii-f
Is true, but it can be truthfully said with
out possible ff-ar of contradiction that no
such methods as were adopted to call
and carry on the convention at Germania
Hall will ever appeal to the intelligence
or confidence of the mass of the voters.
Whoever drew up the Independent plat
form was a genius. The kaleidoscopic I
platform Is a truthful reflection of the
convention. Its first paragraph reaffirms \
the principles of the Republican party. !
The purity of elections is extolled. Mr. j
â  ting was condemned â the Southern ;
Pacific likewise. Religious interference in j
politics was scored and the American
Bailor and poldler were justly lauded.
President McKinley's "sagacity, wisdom
and statesmanship" were kindly reviewed ;
and of course the body "insisted" that |
our flag shall wave forever in any place i
where it has once been planted.
Some objection has been raised to the !
"planting" of the (lag, this term gener
ally being considered as meaning the put
ting away of S"n> thing where it exer
cises no more influence on the world ,
above, and surely the convention did not j
mean that. Republicans refer to the I
raising of the flag.
Funny is no word to use In connection
with the following paragraph, reviewed
in the light of the personnel of the con
vention:
"We stand for the honor, integrity and
perpetuity of the Republican party in this
county, and shall oppose to the uttermost
any attempt of corrupt wire-pullers, po
litical bosses and corporations to control
Its primaries or conventions."
This is a beautiful sentiment, but think
of the Maguire vice presidents, the late
rabid Populists, one of whomâ a Mr.
Thompsonâ was nominated for a con
stable somewhere, and others of the
"purists" who were present aa delegates.
Then came a section referring to 'equal
rights to all," etc.. "a government of, by,
and for," etc., and while a debate on this
resolution was in progress the chairman
applied gag law to a Second W ard dele
gate who was so incensed that he picked
up His hat and bolted the whole works.
And while President McKinley's "states
manship" was endorsed civil service was
most generously condemn*, l.
There Is no doubt whatever that the
local Republican party is beset with dan
gers. Blind indeed is the man who can
not see that much dissatisfaction followed
the San Leandro convention, and that un- j
less this dissatisfaction be healed before
November 8, there will be some sore dis
appointments. The same is true of the
so-called fusion ticket. Members of all
three parties that helped to frame that
ticket are dissatisfied and are preparing
to battle against opposing factions at the
polls. There never has been a time when
a stable, independent movement in which
the public could be induced to place con
fidence, faced such an opportunity to be
successful, but it has now passed.
There axÂ« enough dissatisfied voters to
turn the tide of any ticket or candidate
that has been nominated, and It should
be the duty of the Republican party to
make such a campaign aÂ« will unite these
forces. It is not to be done under the
leadership of a handful of sorehead candi
dates who know no principle other than
i self. It Is not to be done by such a gatn
! ering as was witnessed at Germanla Hall
last Friday ni^ht. It can only be ac
complished under the guidance of strong,
able party men above suspicion and who
have the confidence of the public. There
! are scores of such men in this county.
! At a general election they are always in
evidence, but with that remarkable diffi
dence, the exhibition of which has so hurt
the Republican party they prefer to keep
their hands off matters purely local. If
this element of the party declines to takt>
a hand in this campaign and to work
durinpr the coming five weeks as they
worked prior to the election of McKmley,
then Alameda County may as well com
mence at once packing up the State ban
ner ready to go to some other county.
Frank Jordan ought to win. That is to
say. if diplomacy and all-round grit is
of any value in a Republican campaign.
For about half an hour on Friday night
I the most conspicuous figure at Germanla
Hail was County Clerk Jordan. Now. if
Frank knows anythingâ and he knows a
great dealâ he was well aware that his
friends among the hundred delegates that
attended that convention were not partic
ularly numerous. This, however, did not
i deter Jordan from taking advantage of a
recess to treat his political enemies.
' "Hello, Ward, old boy/ said Frank, ad
dressing the chairman, "take a cigar.
"Hello, old boy," "Hello , old boy âa
dozen times was uttered by Frank, and a
minute later the flower and elite of the
convention were smoking Frank Jordan s
Havanas, while Frank was laughing, nod
ding, shaking hands and being most royal
ly entertained in the house of his enemies.
The result of the ballot on County Clerk
failed to show that Frank had a single
' friend in the house, but I would scorn to
think that all those jolly good fellows,
from Chairman down to the rear
of the hall, will fall to remember the
â  genial and aggressive Frank, and espe
cially his cigars, when they stand with
1 their God and a ballot in the secrecy of
the voting, booths in November.

Berkeley Provides the Flags for the
New Ferry-Boat Named After
the College Town.
BERKELEY, Oct. 2.â The university
town has not been slow to appreciate the
action of the Southern Pacific Company
jin calling Its new ferry steamer the
Berkeley.
When it was generally known that the
finest boat ever built to ply between San
, Francisco and Oakland was to be named
after this city, its residents, responding
to the call of President J. W. Richards of
the Board of Trustees, decided to return
I the compliment In the most appropriate
; way possible. This they have done in
i the purchase of a set of three flags which
' will be presented to the Southern Pacific
Company to be used on the steamer. The
flags are made of the very best material
purchased with funds collected by public
subscription. Subscriptions were limlt
1 ed $1 each and the collectors met with a
i liberal response on all sides.
The railway company has notified the
Board of Trustees that the new boat will
be launched at the Union Iron Works in
San Francisco on the 18th of this month.
The City Fathers have been invited to at
tend in a body, and there, on behalf of
Berkeley's residents, they will make a I
formal "presentation of the colors for the i
ferry steamer.

MINES' PITCHING
COST ATHLETICS
A GOOD GAME
He Was All Out of
Condition.
RELIEVED BY FITZPATRICK
TWELVE BUNS . -ADE FROM HOI
IN THE THIRD.
The San Jose Aggregation Claims
a Victory by an Easy Score
of Seventeen to
Eight.
By Joe Corbett.
The once famous Athletics met with a
terrible beating at the hands of the San
Joses yesterday afternoon at Recreation
Park, the score registering at the expira
tion of the game 17 to 8 In the latter club's
favor.
The heavy rain of the previous evening
in no way affected the play, but the
pitching of Mr. Hines did affect the
chances of the Athletics, for never since
the consolidation did a pitcher receive
such a drubbing.
Twelve runs were made off him in the
third inning, and after this slaughter he
was prevailed upon to retire m favor of
Fitzpatrick, who did very well, consider
ing the odds against him. Mr. Hines was
easily responsible for the Athletics' de- j
feat, as he was batted all over the park.
Yet, Mr. Hines, in hte first place, should |
never have attempted to pitch. He was
out of condition, and no man can do him- j
self Justice without practice.
It was really a pity to see the way his
feeble attempt at twirling without suf- ;
ficient practice terminated, and it should ]
be a lesson to him in the future. No I
twirler should attempt to fill his position
without first conditioning himself.
The game was a very ragged exhibition
and was won by the San Joses through
their ability to bat Mr. Hines' shoots all j
over the lot.
After they scored their twelve runs in i
the third inning everybody gave the game ;
up as was natural, and despite the noble
efforts of the Athletics toward the latter
part of the contest the lead was too
much to overcome. In fact, the result of
the game was never in doubt.
The score follows:

The Watsonville Game.
WATSONVILLE, Oct. 2.â To-day In the
presence of 2000 peopie, many of whom
were from Santa Cruz and Salinas, the
Watsonville "Babies" defeated the Santa
Cruz Beachcombers by a score of 5 to 2.
Chief Borchers and Dewey Donlln did
the troubling twirling for the respective
nines. Donlln pitched the game of his
life. He struck out fifteen Santa Cruzans.
They made three measley hits off him,
and he walked four to first. Borchers
struck out three, had nine hits off him
and walked four. Both nines made two
runs in the first inning. Wataonville
made one in the sixth and two in the
eighth, and had half an inning to spare.
The work of both nines was almost per
fect, praticularly the battery work of
Donlln and Hartman.
It was the prettiest game ever played
here, and was entirely free from wrang
ling. Josh Rilev played right field for
Watsonville. Charley Sweeney umpired
and he gave entire satisfaction to both
nines. Watsonville is wild to-night over
her victory.

TREACHEROUS
ACTS OF THE
SPANIARDS
Private Apitz Gives
Some Incidents.
RED CROSS FIRED UPON
LIEUTENANT OBD SHOT BY A
DON HE WAS AIDING.
Sharpshooters Picked Off Men Who
Were Helping the Wounded
and Then Attacked the
Hospital.
Private W. F. Ajrttz of Company C,
Sixth United States Infantry' Is here on
a furlough while recovering from a wound
received at the battle of San Juan Hill,
and recounts some astounding tales of the
murderous treachery of the Sapniards.
Mr. Apttz was shot in the hand while tak
ing a wounded man from the field after
the battle, and says that the Spaniards
had no hesitancy about firing on the Red
Cross, and even attacked the hospital.
"The most wanton incident which came
to my notice," said Apitz, "was the mur
der of First Lieutenant Ord of my com
pany. The lieutenant stooped over a
wounded Spaniard to sec if he could be of
any assistance to him, and finding his
lips parched offered his canteen. The
Spaniard pulled a revolver and shot Lieu
tenant Ord in the forehead. He stag
gered back a few steps and fell deÂ«ad. The
affair v.-as seen by a private from the
Sixteenth Regulars, and without a mo
ment's hesitation he placed his gun at the
murderous Spaniard's head and avenged
the lieutenant. Mr. Ord was a fine gen- i
tleman and officer, and the men under ]
him admired him greatly. He formerly j
lived in California, i understand, and has
a younger brother attending school in this
city now.
"The death of Lieutenant Ord is only
one incident of the many. The Spaniards
would fire on the Red Cross, but knowing
that it was sacred to the boys in bHie ]
had their firing line covered with the ;
lied Cross flags. The night after the bat- i
tie at San Juan when we went out to
bring in the dead and wounded the Span- !
iards had sharphooters stationed in trees ;
.and these were constantly trying to pick j
us off. though they know the nature of I
our mission. A number of the boys were |
shot in this manner and when it became I
too monotonous a guard was sent out and
f the sharpshooters received
their reward.
"Late that same night an attack was i
made upon the hospital. Not an open at- I
tack, but the Spaniards wouM creep up j
OÂ£ close as they could without too muen â 
danger to their precious selves and pick j
men as they lay in their ;
beds and shoot down the doctors and the i
men who were nursing them. A i-egf
meni of colored cavalry was sent out t<wj
protect the- hospital, finally, and easilyn
put the skulking Spaniards to rout.
"The American soldier has considerable ,
contempt for the Spaniard on account of
his lack of bravery. The only real stand
re our army was that wh<*n :
the Rough Riders attacked the Spanish '
. and then the number of Spaniards
was so much greater than our forces and j
their position so much better that they i
deserve no credit for braver:.-. In every
engagement or skirmish which our regl- j
ment participated in the Spaniards would I
make a running fight. They would re- |
treat from one block house' to another
and never Btood their ground, so we came
to look upon them as arrant cowards.
"The Cubans are thought as little of '
by Uncle Sam's boys as the Spaniards.
About all they did was to eat our food !
and we hnd to be on the lookout contin- i
ually to see that they did not steal our !
rations.
"In marked contrast toaour treatment
by the Spaniards was their treatment
by us. I was brought home on the hos
pital ship Olivette and a number
of wounded Spaniards from the Maria
Theresa were tak--n aboard her.Â» They
seemed in constant fear that they were
going to be killed. When offered food
they at first refused 'A. but when finally
persuaded to partake of it were surprised
to find that it was not poisoned. One of
thr-m who spoke a little English expressed
to me his surprise at the excellent treat
ment we gayÂ» our prisoners."

Son Organize in His Behalf.
As an evidence of the popularity of one
of California's Native Sons, a club was
organized on Saturday evening last in the
Thirtieth Assembly District under the
title of the Henry S. Martin Republican
Club of the Thirtieth District. A large
and enthusiastic audience was present to
listen to orations from local political
speakers, as well as songs, recitations
and funny stories. A roll was opened and
about eighty signatures were attached.
J. Smith was elected president and
Frank Miller, vice president; P. Sweeney.
secretary, and T. Morgan, sergeant at
arms. Following is the executive com
mittee: R. H. Heffernan, E. Finn, Wil
liam Linehan, J. J. Kelly and J. Green
wood.
The club unanimously indorsed for
Sheriff Henry S. Martin; for Congress for
the Fourth District, Julius Kahn, and for
Assemblyman from the Thirtieth District
I*. A Devoto. After three rousing cheers
for the Republican ticket the club ad
journed to the call of the chairman.

United States Should Shelter Them.
Dr. E. A. "Wood of the First Baptist
Church, on Kddy street, preached last
evening on the Philippine Islands. He
3id not advocate that the United States
should permanently retain the Spanish
possessions, but contended that they
should be released to some other power
than Spain. He paid:
"I compare the position of -.ie United
Statos at the present time to that of the
neighbor who has interfered in behalf of
a boy who has been continually beaten by
an unmerciful parent. The neighbor
whips the parent, and in order to pre
serve th fi boy's hide from future torture
he has taken possession of the lad. We
have the Spanish possessions and there
is but one course remaining, either to
adopt them or to turn them over under
proper protection. By all mean? do not
give them 1 ack to Spain; she has kept
them in dismal ignorance by her religious
tyrany far long enough."

was one of the twelve brave spirits of the

time had repelled every Invasion of their
territory that the whites had attempted.

DALTON WILL NAVE
AN OPPONENT
JOHN HACKETT WTLL RUN FOB
ASSESSOR AGAINST HIM.
Democrats Heading Off the Recent
Action of the Silver Repub
licans.
OAKLAND, Oct. 2.â After a long: confer
ence of the dissatisfied elements of the
various parties that vainly endeavored to
fuse on a county ticket, it was decided
to-r.ight that the Democrats should put
a candidate in the field to run against
Henry Dalton, the Republican nominee
for Assessor. Captain John Hackett is
the man who has been chosen and he has
signified his willingness to accept.
Some weeks ago, it is said, Robert M.
Fitzgerald requested Captain Hackett to
accept the nomination at the hands of the
fusion county convention, but the captain
demurred at that time; later the privi
lege, of naming the Assessor on the fusion
ticket was conceded to the Sliver Repub
licans by the Democratic committee in
a <-onfercnce of which Mr. Fitzgerald was
chairman. To the surprise of everybody,
the Silver Republicans did not name a
member of their party, but indorsed the
Republican nominee, who is a pronounced
sound money man. This caused dissatis
faction on the floor of the Democratic
convention, which has steadily increased.
It was stated to-night that Mr. Daiton
; ha.l not signified his intention of indors
ing the platform or of accepting the nom
ination of the fusionlPts and so Democrats
decided to have a candidate of their own.
"It Is true that I have agreed to run
for Assessor," said Captain Hackett to
night, "and I believe the Democrats are
quite able to take care of their own poli
tics, and need not go to the Silver Repub
licans for a candidate. I was asked some
weeks ago to make the race but declined
at that time as 1 wanted to feel sure that
my party did actually want me and waa
sincere In making the offer. They have
no other candidate and I have consented
to enter the arena with Mr. Dalton.
It is also reported that the Independent
Republicans have visited John L. Davle
and asked him to reconsider his declina
tion of their indorsement. Owing to the
pressure brought to bear it Is said that
the matter will be held Jn abeyance until
I next Saturday.
Socialist Meeting 1 .
William Edlin, a student at .the Stan

OUR TRADE
RELATIONS
WITH CHINA
Rev. G. W. Chalfant
Explains.
CAPABLE OF VAST EXPANSION
ALBEADY SECOND ONLY TO THAT
OF GREAT BRITAIN.
Much Greater Even Now Than Most
Americans Realize â Probable
Cause of the Emperor's
Death.
"Americans do not begin to realize the
extent of their present trade relations
with Northern China and the posibilities
for its future growth," said Dr. G. "W.
Chalfant last evening. Dr. Chalfant and
his wife have just returned from an ex
tended tour of the Orient, whither they
went to visit their two sons, who are
laboring in the missionary field there. Dr.
Chalfant Is a leading Presbyterian divine
of Pittsburgh and will resume his Journey
home to-morow.
"I penetrated the interior of China much
further than the average European trav
eler does," he continued, "and I was sur
prised at the immense quantites of Amer
ican goods that were steadily being car
ried far inland on the backs of donkeys.
Cotton goods and oil are the staple com
modities, though there is a large and con
stantly increasing demand for American
wire nails, which the natives find are
much superior to the English make.
"China must expand or her inevitable
fate will be disruption. In either event
the United States is certain to profit im
mensely if nroper steps are taken to fos
ter trade relations. Russian aggression
in the north and German grf-ed ior terri
torial expansion further south is being
bitterly opposed by England, in which
she has the support of Japan and the
United States. This is true, for our Min
ister at Peking toki me personally that
he was in full sympathy with England's
position.
'You will see that if the report of the
Emperor's death proves true, the Ameri
can fleet at Manila, or a large portion of
it, will be dispatched to Hongkong in
short order. Dewoy's victory has made a
wonderful impression among the Chinese
and instead of regarding the American
navy lightly, as they formerly did, they
now regard it with the greatest respect.
"It is my belief that China will expand;
even the Dowager Emprc-ss is shrewd
enough to see that the only way to pre
vent the partitioning of the empire
among the European nations is to take
down the barriers that have walled it in
from the markets of the world in the
past.
"The Emperor is â or was â exceedingly
progressive. His servants were continu
ally ransacking the stores of Peking for
English literature, which he delighted to
pour over, and he had even undertaken
to ride a bicycle while I was in Peking.
Moreover, he was preparing to take a
railway Journey some distance away, a
special train of three cars being in course
of construction for him. As no sovereign
has left the walled city for centuries it
is easily to be seen what a stir this has
created.
"If his Majesty be really dead. I think it
will be shown that he committed official
suicide, which is the proper course to pur
sue in China when any high official finds
he has lost the confidence of his people.
It was due primarily, I believe, to his
decree abolishing the essay as the test
for scholarships and the substitution of a
treatise on chemistry. From time im
memorial it has been the custom for ap
plicants for scholarship to prepare an es
say, taking extracts from the Chinese
classics, not one of which Is less than
3000 years old. These extracts were strung
together from memory, and on their a<v
ceptance depends the granting of scholar
ships. These scholarships entitle the
holder to assume office and, in fact, raises
him to highest rank. No wonder, then,
that the Emperor's decree doing away
with the essay and substituting a treatise
on chemistry caused trouble. Nobody in
China knows anything about chemistry;
and to fulfill the requirements of the de
cree necessitates first the mastery (if Eng
lish and then a course in chemistry.
"Even though the Emperor be dead it
will not stop the advance of China, and
the United States will profit immeasur
ably, particularly the Pacific Coast, for
with your cheap water transportation you
ought to build up great cotton factories,
nail works and other industries to meet
the demand in China."
Dr. Chalfnnt delivered an address at the
Howard Presbyterian Church yesterday
morning on China, its resources and its
political future. In the evening he ac
cepted an invitation from Dr. H<'mphill
to occupy the pulpit of Calvary Church
His subject was "The Providential Gov
ernment of the World by Jesus Christ "
FRIEXDS OF THE FOREST.
On the evening of the 24th ult. Mlzpah
Lodge gave a party in its hall at Six
teenth and Valencia streets which was in
the nature of an "at home." It was a
pleasant affair.
Last Monday night Washington Hall
was very tastefully and artistically dec
orated with imitation icicles and winter
flowers to carry out the idea of a winter
evening in a cold climate, and all because
Lincoln Lodge had announced a "snow
party." The hall was crowded and the
majority of the lady members were at
tired in pure white. The commissioners
on entertainment. Miss Hoffman, Mrs.
Hicks, Mrs. Blackall, the Misses Sharp,
Mrs. Trenele and Mrs. Waldo, presented
an enjoyable programme that included
recitations by Miss McDermott, Mr.
Brackett, Pearl Tucker, Maud Adams;
declamations by D. C. Hanlon, violin solo
by Mr. Wagner, and a fancy dance by
Annie Berg. Then followed dancing anil
the serving of icecream, and >here was
mirth and good feeling until the musi
cians played "Home. Sweet Home."
On Tuesday night last Pioneer Lodge
gave an "at home" in Washington Hall
nnd deceived a large number of its
friends, including a great many sol
diers. There was a good programme of
dances, and as a diversion Miss Winnie
favored with a recitation. The pleasant
social did not break up until It was time
to catch the last car.
The supreme officers paid an official
visit to Richmond Lodge last Wednesday
night, and they were cordially welcomed.
The- members, after the transaction of
business, entertained the visitors with
a select programme of vocal and instru
mental numbers.
THE DRUIDS.
During the past week Hesperian Grove
conferred the third degree on three can
didates; Aurora Grove conferred the same
degree on a candidate and received three
propositions; Frederich Selg Grove ajso
conferred the tnlrd degree and received
three propositions; Merced Grove received
three propositions at its last held meet-
Ing.
The lecture on a trip in 1555 from San
Francisco to the Dalles, delivered last
wec-k before Hesperian Grove by E. Ma
ginnls, P. N. G. A., was a very Interest
ing one and was listened to with marked
attention by the many Druids present.
He was one of the party named by the
Government to select a route to Oregon
from California. He gave a vivid descrip
tion of the country %s it then was, and
told some blood-curdling stories of en
counters with the Indians.
The grand officers paid a visit to L.lv
ermore Grove last Friday at tne request
of that grove for the purpose of confer
ring the third degree. There were pres
ent a number of the Druids from Pleas
anton Grove. After the work there was
an enjoynble banquet.

nia Volunteers, who was killed at the
battle before Manila, was a member of

CHAPLAIN T.K.
FREEMAN TAKES
HIS OWN LIFE
Suicided in Japanese
Waters.
WAS DESPONDENT AND ILL
HIS WIFE WAS TOO LATE TO
MEET HIM.
The Chaplain of the Baltimore,
Broken Down in Health, Jumps
Overboard From the
Zealandia.
The latent advices from Japan bring
the story of the sad ending of Thaddeus
Freeman, the chaplain of the Baltimore,
â who committed suicide in the harbor of
Nagasaki.
Just before the war broke out Freeman
was a chaplain at the Mare Island Navy
yard. He enlisted in the service without
a thought of the horrors of war, but was
assigned to active duty on the Baltimore.
Boon after the memorable engagement of
Manila Hay Freeman's health began to
fail and he grew steadily worse. About
a month ago he was condemned and was
taken on board the Zealandia to be sent
home.
The trip of the Zea.landia was a stormy
one. In her course to Yokohama she met
with heavy typhoons that damaged her
so severely that it was necessary to put
In at Nagasaki for repairs.
Freeman, though he seemed to recover
his physical health somewhat, gave way
to a profound mental depression in Nagr
asaKi. He was suffering from nervous
prostration and at times was in a most
serious condition. One morning the
passengers on the Zealandia were arous
ed by the cry of "Man overboard," and
before assistance could be brought to the
drowning man he had sank from sight.
ThÂ»> crÂ«\v say that Freeman deliberately j
cast himself overboard and that it was
not accidental drowning, as was first re
ported.
When the reports of the chaplain's ill
health first reached this country his wife
left her home in the East to meet her
husband at Yokohama. She arrive, i
there just in time to hear of his demise,
but the news she received was that he |
had met death by accidental drowning. |
She was heart broken and desolate and j
was about to set out for Nagasaki at
once when word from the Government of
fldala reached her there. She was in
formed that the body nad been found and
that it would be sent to this country at
once. Mrs. Freeman was advised by
friends to return to America lmmedi
ately, which she did, and the fact of
suicide was kept from her. Mrs.
Freeman arrived in this city on the
Gaelic last Friday and left at once for
her home in the East.
Thaddeus S. K. Freeman received his
commission as chaplain in the navy on
June 4, 1837. and was assigned to duty on
the Baltimore. October 16 of the same
year. His remains will be brought ovor
on the next steamer. He was a young
man and his wife is barely 20.
WILL PRESERVE
NEW PAVEMENTS
HOUSEMEN ADVOCATING THE
USE OF A NEW SHOE.
It Is Practically Noiseless and Does
Not Tear Sun-Softened Bitumen
as Do the Common Ones.
Now that the City Fathers nave taken
active steps toward improving: the streets
of San Francisco by replacing the un- i
Bilghtly and noisy cobbles with bitumen, j
veterinary surgeons, and horsemen in
general, are advocating the use of a new
rubber and steel horse shoe, which is cal
culated not only to preserve the pave
ments, but to rlo away with noise and
concussion and to expand the hoof, there
by adding to the years of an animal s
usefulness.
In action the rubber strikes the pave
ment first and the weight of the animal
then compresses the rubber until the i
Bteel rests securely on the ground. The
fact of the rubber being the first to come
in contact with the pavement stops all ,
noise make no indentation in the bitu- ;
men and assists the horse In many ways.
It prevents slipping and the expanding
nature of the pad adds to the lightness of
a "n a New York and Chicago such shoes
have been generally adopted, and horse- ;
men of this city, wishing to be abreast of |
the times have determined .to assist in ;
the preservation of the new pavements
and shoe their horses with this end in
view.
IS THE WOBLD BETTER P
Rev. Locke Says Men Are Not as Bad
as They Were Formerly.
Rev. Dr. Locke, in the first of a series
of lectures commenced last night at the
Central Methodist Church on Mission
street is satisfied from a comparison
made 'of the evils of to-day and those of
our forefathers that man is hetter now
tl-an he was 100 years ago. There is less
open profanity now than there was In the
earlier days. In years gone by com
manders of the army publicly swore at
their men; Judges swore in court at cv -
tirtts- lawyers in court when arguing their
cases Now this is no longer tolerated,
diftnitv and decorum prevail instead. Jt
Is only the low and vulgar who ue pro- |
fane language in public. In some of the
Eastern States they have a law to punuh
profaners at the lord's name. It is Â«co
bad said he. that such a law does not
exist in San Francisco.
In this day there is no such thing In
this country as dueling, not so in days
cone by when the leading men of the
country sought this means of upholding
their honor. But we still have pugilists.
a more reprehensible and degrading in
novation, for the code of honor. We have
abolished the Louisiana lottery and i
turned our faces against gambling. This |
vice is now followed in a kindergarten
sort of way In the dark corners in the
rear of whisky shops. We havo abolished
polygamy, and it is to be hoped that every
building erected in Salt Lake City and
elsewhere dedicated to that debasing
practice shall be pulled down; that no
more remembrance of its existence shall
bo permitted to stand within the
United States: And last but not
least we have abolished slavery and
turned the dark man out of bondage.
FATE OF SUPERIOR JUDGES.
Premonitions of a Fight in the Non-
Partisan Convention.
There may be a hot time in the Non-
Partisan convention to-night when the
report of the committee on indorsement
of Superior Judges is presented. In this
municipal campaign the Non-Partisans
declare that loyalty to the new charter is
the first consideration, yet the committee
appointed to consider judicial nomina
tions has decided to give Henry N. Cle
ment, a nominee for Superior Judgre on
the Republican ticket, the "cold, distant
overlook" and to approve the nomina
tions of Judges Wallace, Seawell, Trout
and Borden.
Frank Sullivan, Mayor Phelan and the
other Democratic managers who are
seeking to run the Non-Partisan move
ment as a fusion sideshow may have
hard work to maintain a slate on which
the names of H. N. Clement Is not writ
ten. Mr. Clement has been giving his
time for years to charter making and is
the author of several subdivisions of the
pending charter relating to public utili
ties ana municipal reforms. He stands at
the head and front of new charter build
ers. It Is reported that two of the Judges
ON MARSH AND UPLAND.
Gunmen Open the Season V/l/ith a Bom
bardment of Both Quail and Ducks.
ON boih upland and marsh there has
been a continual abandonment dur
ing the past two days, denoting
that the shooting season has been
ushered in under auspicious condi
tions. The quail and the ducks have been
plentiful or scarce, according to the local
ities over which the city sportsmen have
shot.
Up Point Reyes way royal sport has
been enjoyed with the quail by some of
the best known of the shotgun brigade.
Samuel F. Hughes was about high grun,
having thirty-eight birds to his credit.
Bward Rodolph killed twenty-eight;
Frank Maskey. thirty-two; Charles
Precht. twenty-one; Frederick E. Peter
ron eighteen; Mr. Ryan, thirteen; Peter

lard while Frank Vernon and Thomas
Irving bagged eighty-one quail between
them Mr. Vernon's second day's sport
was spoiled in a measure as he shot his
dog in the eye. Inflicting a slight wound
that caused his retirement from the field.
Mr Hughes shot over his favorite Kng
llsh setters Silverplate and Doctor Dow

usually large bag of between sixty and
seventy, was accompanied by his Eng

dorsement opposed the adoption of the
charter. The story goes that the Repub
licans on the indorsement committee
made a great kick over the turning down
of Mr Clement and resolved to reopen
the contest on the floor of the convention
The Democratic bosses. Sullivan and
Phelan. may find to-night that the Re
publican Non-Partisans have determined
to make a stand on what they believe to
be principles of right and justice.

FUN FOR DOG AND AUDIENCE.
Despite Manager Morrisey's unquenchable faith in perpetual good luck,
things got started off wrong last night, and for fifteen minutes the genial
manager, a squad of specials and a half hundred perspiring waiters were
kept hustling to quiet the merriment that resulted from two good turns
not on the bills.
The gallery gods started the lirst racket. Somewhere down In the four
bit seats they discovered an over-afffotionato pwaln w"h b's nrm iÂ»Â«gimÂ«^
once or twice round the waist of the girl he had bought tickets for. The
gallery couldn't stand for It, and with that quiet insistence looked for
from upstairs, they demanded that 'de guy be thrown out." He was.
The dog that plays football with vie iwo x .^,,.Â» ..^o â U âÂ« _>i..
sey's feelings.
The beast had it in for the leading clown for some reason, and when the
kick-off was called he made a forty-yard punt into the audience. The audi
ence returned, but the dog caught the big sphere on the tip of his nose and
sent it back for a ten-yard gain, and from then on the play was hot be
tween the audience, the dog and a squad of specials captained by Morrisey.
Morrisey got the ban finally, but lost It on an off side play, and a clean
punt placed it in the gallery. The gallery worked along on a half dozen
clever masse plays and finally returned it to the stage, where Towser
missed another punt, and the ball was taken on a down by the elder Paoli.
Morrisey posted a ten-dollar fine against the dog and the show was re
sumed.
THE SAIST FRANCISCO CALL, MOSTPAY, OCTOBER 3, 1898.
lish setter, Whip: Mr. Rodolph had Dick
R and Mr. Precht, hie pointer, Dick.
The weather on Saturday was ideal for
the men who went far afield, resembling
a day in May rather than the first of
October. Birds were plentiful, being
chiefly old ones that acted nicely. They
flushed that, like old birds, they would not
after that, like old birds, they would not
lay. The heavy rain of Saturday sent
the quail to the hill tops, where they were
found in bunches. The old brigade from
this city was reinforced by some twenty
new men who had never shot over this
district heretofore. Frank Maekey was
so pleased with the prospects of addi
tional sport that he determined to stay
over until Wednesday.
The members of the Country Club were
delighted with the sport afforded by their
preserves in Marin County. Those who
were out were Robert Oxnard. J. M. Kll
gariff, J. Leroy Nickel, Henry Oxnard,
W. S. Kittle. W. S. Davis. Dr. H. B. de
Marvllle. J. K. Orr and Dr. F. W. Vow
inckle. A bag is limited to twenty-five
birds for a day's shoot, which limit was
reached by nearly every one present.
The quail shooters, who sought sport
nearer the city did not fare so well.
About the most successful was a party of
Berkeleyans who shot near Mill Valley.
The party was composed of Billy Ede,
THE BURGLARS
ARE BREAKING
THE RECORDS
Rob One Building Six
Times Safely!
POLICE DONT BOTHER THEM
COMPLAINTS PBOVE TO BE OF
NO AVAIL.
Victims of the House-Breakers Must
Look to Private Detectives for
Protection of Their
â¢Property.
The enterprising frugal burglar Is still
< "burgling" on his Joyous and successful
| way in the same old fruitful preserves ai:
I the northwest corner of Geary and Jones
streets.
A few days ago the attention of the
public was called to the fact that within
! thirty days these flats had been robbed
I five times; that on one occasion a wagon
| load of personal property had been re
! moved during a bright night, and the
| guardian of the peace never knew that
i the earnest thief was attending to busl
: ness. He was, and that is more than can
! be said of the gentleman of helmet and
i club.
While these housebreakers were de
spoiling the defenseless taxpayer practi
cally within the shadow of the dome of
the City Hall the autocratic gentlemen
i who order events in the Police Depart
ment had been twice notified of the monot
onous raids that were going on and wore
told how the criminals could be easily
taken. In the office of the Chief of Police,
after emphatic protest had been made,
promises were given that the matter
would be attended to at once. Iso atten
tion was given by headquarters to tnese
promises, and the result was that while
the police were dodging their duty the
thieves had every possible accommoda
tionâ freedom from police interference,
and a good field upon which to work.
The strange part of the proposition is
that from the first the excuse of the no
lice detectives for not capturing the regu
lar housebreaker was that they were too
busy and after another big rnld had been
piled upon the record tha detective who
came around to take a look at things and
see where the space was that had been
formerly occupied by valuable property
the plea was still that they were "too
The occupants of this particular row of
flats have decided that it is useless to en
deavor to interest the police in their trou
bles and they are considering a proposi
tion to employ a private detective from
one of the responsible agencies to not
only protect their property but bring the
criminals to justice. This idea was the
result of another descent of the thieves,
in which they cleaned out all the larders
that had been filled for Sunday consump
tion. This raid was made Saturday night
and in view of the fact that it is the sixth
visitation within five weeks the house
holders in that building are afraid to
leave their premises lest those same "im

Durbow, Stewart Rawlins, Edward Rob
inson and C. Turney, and the combined
bag was forty birds. _
Another party of threeâ H. Kohler. F.
Noltemeler and A. Little woodâ covered
considerable country near Fairfax with
but little to show for their outing.
E. Tichnor and William Hale traversed
the country above Millwood without see
ing a bird,
E. S. Michelssen, C. M. Wallam and
Mr. Graham explored the country near
Sausallto. The birds lay so close the
dogs could not find them owing to de
fective scent. A number of birds were
seen on the military reservation, but the
guards were alert and would permit no
shooting.
The men who sought ducks had much
the same experience as the quail shooters.
Some of the best-known grounds proved
a blank. This was true of Mt. Eden.
Ralph Brown, S. McFarland, Alexander
Robinson and L. Schnell found but few
birds. George Carlson bagged eight at
Alviso, while Alexander Pape bagged
twenty near Alvarado. Frank Melster
secured twenty-four rail at the same
place.
The universal complaint was that the
birds were exceedingly wild and flew high
above the range of the guns. Tomales
Bay is reported full of ducks which will
come south with the first big storm.
Those that are going south are heading
for the fresh water ot Los Banns.
Herman Oelrichs was the most success
ful of the men on the Suisun marshes
He bagged thirty-two! W. J. Street secur

about the average bag of the day. Many
men remained over until to-day to avail
themselves of the morning flight of the
birds.
mune" burglars remove the entire house
hold furniture while they are absent.
This Is only one instance of the many
that are reported at headquarters, and
that is the last heard of the matter.
To the tax payer who is being despoiled
by the active thief and can get no protec
tion the fact that Chief Lees' thief takers
who are "too busy" to catch programme
burglars, can be readily found holding
down the fronts of cigar stores in the
"Tenderloin," is no particular satisfac
tion.
"If I were rich and could afford to lose
these things," paid one of the weary vic
tims, "or if my name was connected with
the management of nn influential corpor
ation, my property would have been re
covered promptly and the thieves sent to
punishment. As it is. I am an ordinary
citizen living in the heart of the city and
I can't get any kind of protection. Since
C aptain Lees went to the head of the de
partment this kind of lawlessness seems
to have greatly increased. They were not
robbing prominent places five times a
month in the center of the town when
Chief Crowley was in charge. Somehow
it does no good to file complaints in these
days."
FOB GAGE AND NEFF.
Army and Nevy Men Will Vote
Solid for the Republican Can
didates.
A meeting of the executive committee
of the Army and Navy Republican
League was held Saturday. It was at
tended by Commander-in-Chlef Seaman
of Sacramento, H. C. Talcot, E. R. Mer
riam, M. D. Hyde. H. T. Smith, E. I.
Herrick, T. C. Mastellar and a large num
ber of other prominent army and navy
men. Commander-ln-Chief Seaman ad
dressed the assemblage and took occa
sion to remark upon the marked enthu
siasm which pervades the State in favor
of the Republican candidates. Between
80 anu 90 per cent of the old veterans will
cast their votes for Gage and NefT. New
camps have ben established at Oakland,
Santa Rosa and Sonora and applications
for the creating of many more are on the
tapis.
Other organizations have been collect
ing money for campaign expenses, repre
senting that such proceeds were to assist
the Army and Navy League, and a cir
cular was issued by the committee ask
ing that no donations be made except to
the regular officers of the league.
Two Immense mass meetings have been
arranged by the officers, one to be held
in San Francisco, October 28, at which
General Barnes, Judge Carpenter, Judge
Fitzgerald and Senator Ford have been
invited to speak, and the other will oc
cur at Oakland November 3. Com
mander-ln-Chief Seaman will preside at
each.
ANOTHER FIGHT
IS PROMISED
MAXWELL AND YOUNG PLUTO
MAY MIX THINGS.
Excelsior and Western Athletic Clubs
Both Bidding for the Go, and
Good Sport Is Probable.
Lovers of flstlcs are to have another op
portunity to lay their good money for or
against Sammy Maxwell If Gus Herget,
Maxwell's manager, accepts either of i.ie
propositions that are now offering. Since
Maxwell's clever defeat of Jimmy Lawlor
he has been a good deal In the sport'ng
i-ye, and his manager and admirers have
been casting about for a suitable contest.
Young Pluto, the Australian feather
weight who has recently returned from a
gold hunting expedition In the Klondike,
has been picked as the most likely man
for an even money go, and the prelim
inary arrangements with him are practi
cally completed. All that remains is. the
acceptance of one of the two offers that
have been made by the Excelsior and
Western Ahtletlc clubs. Both organiza
tions have signified their desire to pull
off the fight, out as yet have stated no
definite terms. It Is expected that In a
day or so this will have been done, as
both clubs are in dally communication
with Herget and Maxwell's backers.
Young Pluto Is pretty well known In
San Francisco sporting circles as a clever
man. He has in the past fought six draws
with young Griffo, the last one being a
75-round go, that was "called" on account
of daybreak or some other sufficient rea
son. He further established his reputa
tion by doing an eleven-round draw
with Jack McGowan, the feather
weight champion of the Antipodes,
shortly before he went to the Klon
dike on a hunt for quick money. A defi
nite announcement is looked for during
the present week.
The famous old JESSE MOORE WHISKY Is
recommended by physicians for family and
medicinal use because It is pure.
Serenaded The Call.
One of the attractive features of the
grand political demonstration on Saturday
in honor of Candidates Gage and Neff was
the effective appearance of the Union
League band and drum corps. Arrayed in
striking uniforms they marched up Mar
ket street, the corps pausing to cheer
while the band serenaded The Call, and
with fiimbeaus ablaze escorted the great
Republican nominees to Woodward's ra
vllfon. There both band and drill corps
were enthusiastically received, every one
commenting on their efficiency and sol
dierly bearing.

COMPLICATIONS IN THE CASE
THEY ARE SAID TO BE VERY
OLD OFFENDERS.
Their Attorney Is Positive They Are
What They Claim to Be and
That he Can Prove Their
Innocence.
If J. M. Nead and his wife succeed in
proving to Police Judge Low that they
are what they profess to beâ workers in
the Christian fieldâ and not social para
sites of the lowest type, as charged by
the Police Department, they will have
been the victims of the strangest case of
mistaken identity that has been un
earthed in criminal records here for many
years. .
But It Is going to be no easy matter for
them to prove their innocence, despite
many circumstances that point In their
favor. .
The story of Mrs. Nead's arrest and
conviction on a charge of vagrancy, and
her husband's arrest on a similar charge
when he appeared in court to aid his
wife, was told in yesterday s Call. A
more serious charge against the woman
was dismissed and sentence on the vag
rancy allegation was P ost P on A ed ** *?
request of the Prosecuting Attorney of
the court until to-day. ._
After their release from custody Mr.
and Mrs Nead engaged the services of
Attorney Frank V. Bell to extricate them
ffSelVpredlcainent and yesterday
the lawyer was confident he would ha\e
no trouble whatever in securing the tri
umphant acquittal of his clients.
Mead and his wife could not be found
at their appartments, 120 Turk street,
yesterday but Mr. Bell had no hesitancy
Ir i declaring that the couple were the vie-
Urns of a Itupid blunder, or â¢ worse on
the part of Policeman Joy. and that he
would endeavor to have the whole case
reopened this morning, when he would

when she left her residence about 9
o'clock to go to a neighboring drug store
for some medicine to alleviate a head
ache from which she was suffering. As
she was returning home and almost in

really no part in it, so much attention
was attracted by the circumstances to the
Character of their place that they deemed
it advisable to leave the city and take
up the r residence in Covington, a village
on the Nebraska bank of the Missouri
Rivpr directly opposite Sioux City.
They continued even then to interest
themselves in Sioux City affairs, and were
more than once suspected of acting as a

case did not exist against him to warrant
his extradition from another State. He
was very careful about venturing within
the jurisdiction of the lowa authorities
and finally disappeared altogether. Until
the news reached here of the couple s ar
rest in San Francisco nothing had been
heard of them for months.
To the Sioux City police both husband
and wife are known as the most trouble

lived here. They were not without abil
ity in their line, however, and exerted a
powerful influence with the criminal and
semi-criminal population, were always
able to employ the best of legal talent
when in trouble, possessed considerable
political influence and were never with
out friends to help them in time of diffi
culty or danger. i
