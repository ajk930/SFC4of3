Aug. 10. â There was a two hours' flgbt
before daybreak yesterday. Eight hun
dred Spaniards attempted to retake the
lighthouse, which was guarded by forty
of our Bailors, commanded by Lieuten
ant Atwater, Assistant Engineer Jen
kins, Ensign Bronson and Gunner
Campbell.
The Spaniards were driven back by
shells from the Amphltrite, Cincinnati
and i^eyden. Refugees report that 100
Spaniards were killed.
William H. Boardman of the Amphl-
Jrite, of Lawrence, Mass., a second
class man in the Naval Academy, was
seric-usly w: undecj. He was in thÂ«
lighthouse.
The Spanish advance began from Rio
Grande, whither the Spanish had re
treated after the first landing of troops
at Cape San Juan last week. They
marched through Luquillo and pulled
down the American flag at Fajardo and
replaced the Spanish flag.
Terrified refugees warned the light
house force that the Spanish werÂ£ com
ing. Sixty women and children were
inÂ°an outbuilding of the lighthouse
during the fight.
The Spaniards opened with a machine
gun at a distance of 300 yards. The
Leyden, Ensign Crosiey commanding,
rushed to within 100 yards of shore
and poured one-pounders into the Span
iards. Captain Bare. ay of the Amphi
trite used six-pounders and the Cin
cinnati five-Inch guns. The ships land
ed 250 men during the fight and rein
forced the lighthouse. A machine *un.
rifles and ammunition were left by the
retreating Spaniards.
Ensign Crosley took the refugees off
at daybreak, and has gone to Ponce.
Our flag is still on the lighthouse, but
the force has been withdrawn.
The Amphitrite's guns cover the
lighthouse, ready to annihilate it if our
flag is hauled down. It is one of the
most important lights on the island.

ger to Merriam.
LARGE FORCE FOR POLICING

UNCERTAIN QUANTITY.
Possibly News of a Decisive Engage
ment Will Be Received From
General Merritt Be
fore Long.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. 10.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: It is
considered that no less than 20,000 men
will be needed to prmerly garrison the
Philippine Islands and I am informed
the orders from Secretary Alger to
General Merriam to hurry additional
troops to Manila look rather to com
pleting the expedition as an adequate
military force than to any new move
ment.
There was no surprise expressed that
advices did not come from General
Merritt to-dpv, as the cable station is
1100 miles frum his base of operations
and he would not consider it practica
ble to send dispatch boats so frequent
ly. It was recognized that the recent
engagement was but an incident to
Genera! Merritt's extended investment
of the ctly. It is by no means certain
though there i. some talk to the effect
that iieneral Merritt has been instruct
ed not to take the city. I am informed
that even had Admiral Dewey taken
the city he would have been unable to
properly police it with its disorderly
population of 300,000 inhabitants. To
do this the presonre of an army would
be needed and it is felt tiie next news*
from General Merritt may give an ac
count oÂ£ a decisive engagement.
There is another theory here, how
ever, hs to why the order went from
Secretary Alger hurrying forward
troopsâ namely, that the element of
Aguinaldo and the insurgents was as
yet an uncertain one, and the presence
of more troops In case of the occupa
tion of Manila or otherwise would be
most timely.
PRAISE FOR AMERICANS
BY THE LONDON PRESS
LONDON. Aug. 10.â The afternoon
newspapers comment unon the battle
of Malate as a repetition of a now fa
miliar story. They say the "Spaniards
were bra^e and incompetent, firing
wildly and attacking too late; the
Americans v c c brave, cool and skill
ful, notwithstanding that their opera
tions were conducted in the midst of a
tropical monsoon."
The papers also refer to the "omin
ous neutrality of the Filipinos" as be
ing evidence of trouble in store for the
Americans.

CAMP DEWET. Aug. 3 (via Hong
kong, Aug. 9).â The attempts to secure
the surrender of Manila without fur
ther bloodshed by the intervention of
the church has failed. Since General
Merritt's arrival the chaplains, the
Paulist Fathers, Dougherty and Mc-
Kinnon. have been trying to secure an
entrance to the city through the me
dium of the Belgian Consul to see the
Archbishop, whose influence is para
mount in Manila. Several engagements
made by the Consul to carry the party
across the bay in a launch were not
kept. Finally the Consul intimated
that he would meet the fathers on the
Malate lines, showing the Belgian flag,
to indicate where to cross. The priests
kept the appointment, going to the
front under a heavy fire, but no flag
was shown. This closed the incident.
Manila is now left to its fate.
ALL TROOPS NOW HERE
WILL GO TO MANILA
WASHINGTON, Aug. 10.â General
Merritts force in the Philippine? is to
be increased by the 7000 troops iiow at
San Francisco, which will be sent as
soon as transports can be obtained.
Secretary' Alger said to-day that 2000
troops would sail at once. The depart
ment has not sufficient transports at
hand to convey the remaining 5000 at
present, but the Secretary says that
with those already arrived and on the
sea, together with the 2000 which are
to leave San Francisco at once. Gen
eral Merritt will have a force of 18.000
and there; will be no hurry for the em
barkation of the remaining troops. The
department has had an offer of two
ships to transport the troops, but con
sidered the price asked excessive, and
it is probable the return of the trans
ports that first went to Manila will be
awaited.
The Secretary to-day cabled General
Merritt asking him when it was ex
pected the transports would return to
San Francisco. If they are likely to
reach that point within three weeks,
their return will be awaited, as it will
take at least that length of time to Ret
new transports in readiness to carry
troops.

DELAWARR TO
BE PROSECUTED
Accused of Suborning
Perjury.
EARL MAY DE COMMITTED
WILL BE CITED FOB, CON
TEMPT OF COURT.
Confronted by the Telegram in Which
He Urged Promoter Hooley
to Falsify His Evi
dence.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Aug. 10.â On the resumption
to-day of the examination into the affairs
of Ernest Hooley, the bankrupt company
promoter, the register announced that Mr.
Hooley was ill and that his examination
must be adjourned. It was decided, how
ever, to allow those who have been charg
ed with receiving bribes to make sworn
statements.
Mr. Duguld, formerly financial editor of
the Pall Mall Gazette explained that tie
Â£3000 which Hooley paid him was a com
pensation, explaining that Mr. Hooley ap
pointed him city editor of a newspaper,
but was unable to fulfill his contract. Mr.
Hooley, upon another occasion, offered the
witness $5000 in shares of a hydraulic com
pany, which he refused to accept.
Earl Delawarr was next sworn. He
admitted having received Â£8000 through
Mr. Broadley, Hooley's agent, after the
flotation of the Dunlop company, but the
witness said he had never received any
thing to transmit to the Earl of Albe
marle, nor had he x-eceived Â£2000 for in
troducing Hooley to Lord Greville.
A -able dispatch was read from Lord
Norbury denying that he had received
Â£1000 to join the Singer board.
Mr. Praed, the manager of Lloyd's
Bank, said the statements of Mr. Hooley
in regard to the bank were absolutely
false and he produced documents empow
ering the bank to sell or otherwise dis
pose of the securities it held against Mr.
Hooley's overdrafts. Continuing, the wit
ness said Mr. Hooley once said to him:
"You know, Praed, I have lied to every
body in nearly every case, but I have al
ways told you the truth."
The examination was adjourned until
Friday next.
In the Queen's Bench division of the
High Court of Justice to-day Justice
Wright granted counsel for the official
receiver of the Hooley estate permission
to service notice upon Earl Delawarr and
Messrs, Broadtrick, Bradshaw and Ruek
er that on Friday next a motion will be
made to commit them for eonteSipt of
court in attempting to induce Mr. Hooley
to falsify his evidence. In support of the
application counsel presented the telegram
from Earl Delawarr to Mr. Hooley. men
tioned at Mr. Hooley's last examination,
which was as follows:
"Please make it clear that I did not
have Â£50,000 for Dtuflop, nor kept any
thing duo Albemarle. Also that no con
ditions were made in regard to the pay
n.. it for joining the board and also that
I did not Introduce you to Lord Greville."
The telegram concludes with asking Mr.
Hooley to say he had not had any com
munication with Earl Delawarr since
his llr=t examination.

WATER FIGHT IS
IN THE COURTS
Three Injunction Suits
at Los Angeles.
ALL TO BE TRIED TOGETHER
BY AGREEMENT OF OPPOSING
COUNSEL.
Two of the Actions Brought by the
Company, the Other by the
City â Opening of Argu
ments.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 10.â Threa in
junction suits, one brought by the Los
Angeles City Water Company against
the city and two by the city against the
water company, were begun in the Su
perior Court here this morning. Judgo
Osten of San Bernardino County is on
the bench.
Attorney Chapman in opening the
case for the water company explained
that it had been decided to try the
three cases at once. The court belne
agreeable, he said, that the arguments
of the two sides would alternate, and
that counsel had agreed not to hold
themselves bound, but after the formal
arguments closed to add what in their
judgment seemed to have been not suf
ficiently covered.
Chapman then took up the history of
the case briefly. The city, he expia ned,
laid no claim to the machinery of iho
works except the Bellevue uvoniie
pipes.
Attorney Scott, for the city, inter
rupted. He wanted it understood clear
ly that although the city did not claim
the pipes in Los Feliz marsh land, the
water was maintained to belong to the
municipal corporation.
Regarding the contention of the city
that the rights of the water company
in the matter were merely the rights
of a tenant, Mr. Chapman said: "It
rs the most remarkable case of land
lord and tenant that any man ever
heard of. It is a case where the tenant
has all the rights and title in the case
and the landlord has none at all. Yet
the city makes no secret that it In
tends to take the Crystal Springs prop
erty, but not all of it. Its repre
sentatives have looked it over and de
cided what they could not get along
without. We are entitled to the land.
No matter where the water goes or
comes from, they have no right to the
pipes. We claim that they are not
entitled to a receiver, and I can cite de
cisions to show it."
Here Mr. Chapman read extracts
from a number of Supreme Court
opinions and continued: "On a few
points we all agree. W,e agree that the
contract of 1868 was made, and that the
only difficulty is in its interpretation.
By that contract they claim the right
to enter into possession of our prop
erty July, 1898. When that contract
was made the city had an old wooden
water-wheel and some wooden pipes.
What has become of that ancient struc
ture I do not know. By the theory that
nothing is lost I presume its atoms are
still with us. Since then there have
been more than 320 miles of pipe line
put in. The City Water Company has
since purchased the water rights of the
Citizens' Water Company. The city can
have no landlord's rights in this
â¢matter.
"Regarding the anxiety of the city
about accumulating water rates, I
would ask what better security could
the city have than a debt to the com
pany of $1,000,000?"

WASHINGTON, Aug. 10.â The Presi
dent has determined to recommend to
Congress that Acting Rear Admiral
Sampson be advanced eight numbers
and Commodore Schley six numbers.
This will result in making each a rear
admiral, but with Co-mmodore Schley
Kinking Immediately below Admiral
Sampson. Captain Clark of the Oregon
will be recommended for an advance
of six numbers in the captain's grade,
and Lieutenant Commander Wain
wright will go up eight numbers. Other
promotions throughout the fleet will be
NEW YORK, Aug. 10.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent says: Of
all the promotions made to-day none
has caused more comment than those
of Commodores Sampson and Schley,
especially the promotion of the former
over the latter. The friends of Com
modore Schley are rather inclined to
be indignant, but the administration
sees no ground for complaint on the
part of the second in command in the
battle with Cervera's fleet.
Secretary Long, who told me about
the promotions to-night, said the Presi
dent had taken action in all of the
cases as it seemed to him to be just
and proper. He called attention to the
fact that Rear Admiral Sampson was
commander in chief of the squadron
which defeated Admiral Cervera's com
mand, and therefore was entitled to the
promotion he has received.
The reasons assigned by the Presi
dent for the promotion of Rear Admiral
Sampson cannot be positively stated,
but it is known that Commodore Schlev
has been promoted for conspicuous
conduct in battle, while it is said Samp
son will receive his promotion for meri
torious services.
It is rather expected by the authori
ties that the decision to promote Samp
son over Schley, as has been done, will
cause a renewal of the controversy
which started immediately after the
battle of July 3. Friends of Schley
premise to make a bitter fight when the
nominations go before the Senate. They
have no protest to make against Ad
miral Sampson's promotion, but cannot
understand why he should have jumped
over the head of Schley, who took a
much more conspicuous part in the bat
tle.

Great Britain Made to Play a Very

Important Diplomatic
Matter.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Aug. 11.â The Peking cor
respondent of the Times says: The
Tsung Li Yamen (Chinese Foreign Of
fice) has given formal assent to all the
conditions imposed by the Russian
Charge d'Affaires, M. Pavloff, regard
ing the contract for the Niu Chwans:
Railway extension loan. .
These conditions are in direct conflict
with the terms of the signed contract
and are designed to block the comple
tion of the final contract.
The objectionable clauses In favor of
Russia are removed.
M. Pavloff's conditions as to the Niu
Chwang Railway are that the lines
should not be mortgaged as security,^
and that no foreign control or interfer
ence should be permitted, even in case
of default. So far as the Peking-Han
kow contract is concerned a separate
agreement appoints as arbitrator in
any disputed question the Minister of
that country having the largest finan
cial interest. This gives the Russian
Minister absolute power.
The Times, commenting on the dis
patch of its Peking correspondent, says:
M. Pavloff has knocked the bottom
out of the British concessions. The
news makes short work of all Mr. Bat
four's demonstration on the subject of
the "open door."
FEAR A FAILURE.
Oriental Steamship Company Will
Probably Collapse.
TACOMA, Aug. 10.â Advices received
from Japan to-day say the J.apan Herald
states that shareholders of the Oriental
Steamship Company, which had intended
running steamers to San Francisco next
year, have refused to pay the fourth call
on their shares, fearing evidently that
the company is foredoomed to failure, be
cause the foreign services of the Nippon
Yusen Kaisha nave proved a source of
loss. The Herald says further that some
shareholders are urging dissolution of the
company.

SHANGHAI RIOTS
END IN CARNAGE
Deadly Fire of French
Marines.
MANY NINGPOS SHOT DOWN
LEADER OF THE MOB FATALLY
BAYONETED.
Awed by the Result of the Conflict,
the Coolies Finally Disperse
and Seek to Compro
mise.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Wash., Aug. 10.â Japanese
papers received, to-day contain full ac
counts of the Shanghai riots of July
17 to 19, which were participated in by
several thousand members of the
Ningpo guild, the strongest native or
ganization in Shanghai. The wrath of
the rioting coolies was aimed at the
French colony, the natives claiming the
right to assemble on and use a large
compound within the limits of the
French concession. Resident French
men denied this right, though the
Ningpo men claimed that after a cen
tury of occupation the whole compound
was theirs absolutely.
On July 15 a circular was issued call
ing upon all Nlngpo men to quit the
service of foreigners. Over ten thous
and responded, carpenters, coolies and
deckhands reiusing duty throughout
Shanghai by hundreds. Two days later
the Ningpoese threatened to set fire to
the French concession. That night the
rioters, screeching and howling, raided
the police station at Namtao, pulling
down part of its wails. By this time
eighty marines from the French cruis
er Eclaireur and fifty from the French
! steamer Oceanien had been landed to
i assist the police. The rioters quickly
j became more boisterous, throwing
! stones and clubs, until after due warn
ings the sailors were ordered to fire
upon the mob.
Five Chinese were killed and several
wo-unded. Subsequently the mob was
again fired into by both marines and
police. Native accounts say over twenty
were killed. The French know of thir
teen killed and say others died after
being carried away by Chinese friends.
Between forty and fifty more were
wounded, twenty-nine sufferers from
gunshot wounds being taken to the
i Shantung Hospital. One of the mobs
j leaders was stabbed in the eye with
| a bayonet and died next day. A native
! merchant died from a terrible wound
i in his throat, having been shot while
; looking on from his veranda. This and
i other circumstances indicate that the
French fired in every direction.
In explanation of the harsh measures
taken against the natives the Secretary
of the French municipality says: "It
has been proved that nearly all the
victims were rioters, armed with bam
boos, boathooks and stones. The pro
portion of innocent victims was very
small, due to the extreme moderation
shown by the sailors and police."
Nearly 500 men were on duty during
the riot, including 280 marines and sail
ors from the cruiser Eclaireur and
steamers Marco Polo- and Oceanien,
fifty policemen, 120 volunteers and sev
eral dozen civilians.
Next day machine guns were mount
ed in the police station yard, and am
munition distributed to the marines
and police. This summary action, to
gether with the killing of their com
rades, created consternation among the
Chinese, with the result that large
numbers of striking coolies soon re
sumed work. Others remained obsti
nate, but no further rioting is ex
pected.
Following the riots prominent mem
bers of the Nlngpo guild held a consul
tation with American Consul General
Goodnow, telling him they would also
consult the French, Russian and Ger
man Consul Generals. They sought
Goodnow's aid in making peace with
the French, pointing out that the con
tinuance of strained relations between
the Chinese and French meant inconve
nience and loss to all foreign mer
chants.
It is expected at Shanghai that the
Consuls General named will act to
gether in the premises, especially as
native trade with foreign houses has
already been reduced to a minimum.
The Ningpo men refuse to abandon
their claim to the disputed compound,
claiming that it was acknowledged in
the proclamation Issued by the French
Consul General twenty-four years ago.
REV. JONES FILLS
A RENO PULPIT
Recently Divorced by an
Alameda Court.
LOCATED THROUGH THE CALL
Special Dispatch to The Call.
RENO, Nev., Aug. 10.â It transpires
that the Rev. Frederick V. Jones, who
was granted a divorce in Alameda
County, as stated in last Sunday's
Call, is the Rev. Frederick Vernon
Jones who has lived and filled the pul-
pit of the Congregational Church of
this city since last April and continues
to do so. And this despite the fact that
he claimed to be engaged in business at
Haywards and to have quit the min
istry.
The ffect^that he ia or has been mar
ried and that the person referred to in
The Call is the same as the one occupy
ing the pulpit here will be very inter
esting: news to many of the people of
this city.
The Rev. Mr. Jones came here last
April and since then" has become one
of the well-known people of the city.
He has met with fair success as pastor
of one of the largest churches here,
has made himself rather a favorite in
a social way and enjoys the privilege
of calling upon the best people of the
city, regardless of whether or not they
belong to his church. While he has
not stated that he was an unmarried
man the fact of his having been mar
ried and divorced â in short, that he is
the same man referred to in last Sun
day's Call has not been dreamed of
here until The Call correspondent, at
tracted by the similarity in names, etc.,
investigated the matter and found it to
be so.
What action his congregation will
take In the matter will probably be de
termined shortly after the members
learn the facts in the case.

BRAVE ACTS IN BATTLE
INSTANCES CITED IN AN OF
FICIAL REPORT.
How the Crew on Schley's Flagship
Behaved During the Fight With
the Spanish Fleet Under
Cervera.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 10.â The fol
lowing report has been made public by
the Navy Department:
FLAGSHIP, North Atlantic Station,
July 16, United States Flagship Brooklyn,
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, July 6.â Sir: I
have the honor to submit the following
report of the part taken by the marine
guard of this veswel on the 3d instant in
the action which resulted in the destruc
tion of the Spanish squadron:
At the moment the alarm was given
that the enemy's ships were coming out
of the harbor, the guard was at quar
ters, ready for inspection. It was imme
diately dismissed and the men sent to
their stations for battle. The men were
full of enthusiasm, but there was no ex
citement or disorder and apparently no
concern for personal safety.
The battery was handled with admira
ble coolness and deliberation. Greater
care could not be taken in setting sights
and aiming if the men had been at tar
get practice and each striving to make
a record score.
Considering the fact that the enemy
was within effective range during the
greater part of the action, the fire of
the secondary battery must have been
most destructive to his men and material
and contributed its full share to bring
ing the battle to an end so speedily and
with so little loss to ourselves. It is
reported that the Spanish officers have
stated that so deadly was the effect of
our secondary battery fire that it was im
possible to keep their men at the guns.
Where all did their duty manfully, it
is a difficult matter to select individual:',
for special mention. There are some,
however, who deserve to be brought to
your notice by name for conduct that
displayed in a conspicuous manner cour
age, intelligence and devotion to duty
during the action.
A cartridge during the action was
jammed in tne bore of the six-pounder,
and in the effort to withdraw it the case
became detached frorr me projectile,
leaving the latter fast in the bore and
Impossible to extricate from the rear.
Corporal Robert Guy of the port gun
asked and received permission to attempt
to drive the shell out by means of a ram
mer. To do this it was necessary to go
out on the gun, and the undertaking was
full of difficulty and danger, the latter
due in a great measure to the blast of the
turret guns firing overhead. The gun
was hot and it was necessary to cling to
the Jacob ladder with one hand while en
deavoring with the other to manipulate
the long rammer. After a brave effort he
was forced to give up and was ordered in.
Quarter Gunner \V. H. Smith then was
sent by the executive officer and promptly
placed himself in the dangerous position
outside the gun port, where he worked
and failed, as the corporal had done.
Neither had been able to get the rammer
into the bore, and there seemed nothing
left to do but dismount the gun. At this
Juncture Private MacNeal, one" of the
crew, volunteered to go out and make a
final effort.
The gun was so important, the star
board battery being engaged, that as a
forlorn nope he was permitted to make
the attempt. He pushed out boldly and
set to work. The guns of the forward
turret were firing, the blast nearly
knocking him overboard, and the enemy's
shots were coming with frequency into
his immediate neighborhood. It was at
this time tha,t Chief Yeoman Ellis was
killed on the other side of the deck.
MacNeal never paused in his work. The
rammer was finally placed in the bore
and the shell ejected. The gun was im
meuiately put in action, and MacNeal re
sumed his duties as coolly as if what he
had done were a matter of every day
routine.
The battle orderlies well merit a place
among those whose conduct is worthy of
special mention. They were on the move
continuously, bearing battle orders to all
parts of the ship, and in no instance did
they fail In the prompt and intelligent
performance of their responsible duty.
The signal men occupied very exposed
positions during the action and rendered
excellent service. Signal halyards and
numbers, battle flags and speed cones
were riddled by small projectiles and
fragments of bursting shell, casualties
that show in what a zone of danger the
signal men performed their duties. Sig
nalmen Coombs and Mclntyre and Battle
Orderlies Rail and Davis were so near
Yeoman Ellis when he was killed that
they were bespattered with blood.
The. following are the names of the bat
tle orderlies:
To the flag officerâ Privates Rail and
Davis.
To the commanding officerâ Privates
Kelly, Smith and San Jule.
To the executive officerâ Privates Bren
nen Q. "Wlsmer and O'Donnell.
The flag orderly. Private Richmond, and
commanding officer's orderly, Private
Woodhull, were on deck and rendered
good service.
The following are the names of the sig-
nal men:
Forwardâ Privates Coombs and Mcln
tyre.
Aftâ Privates Shaw and Allearne.
The music boys. Drummer Weisenberg
and Fifer Stewart, were stationed on the
main and the gun decks respectively, to
sound trumpet calls and behaved man
fully.
None showed more unflinching courage
than the men in the military tops, who
stood by their guns delivering their fire
with unerring precision, undismayed by
the projectiles flying about them and
striking in their immediate vicinity.
Private Stockbridge, the only man on
the sick list, climbed into the main-top at
the signal for battle, where he remained
to the end of the action, doing good work
at his gun.
The non-commissioned officers â First
Sergeant Manning, Sergeants Bristow,
MontaJr, Ingalls and McDevett, Corporals
Dittmeier, Doyle and Grayâ showed ex
cellent soldierly qualities in the manage
ment of the men and battery.
First Sergeant Manning rendered valua
ble aid In supervising the widely separ
ated detachments of the guard.
I cannot speak too highly of the con
duct and bearing of Lieutenant Borden.
His courage and excellent services proved
him a valuable officer.
There were no casualties of a serious
nature. Two men were Plightly Injured,
one Private Flinn. in the back by a splin
ter; the other, Private Barfleld, In the
leg, cause unknown. In neither case was
It necessary for the men to leave their
station.
It is a matter of the greatest pride to
the guard, officers ajul men alike, to be
able to claim a sharo in the splendid
work done by the Brooklyn on the 3d in-
stant.
A report nearly identical with this has
been made to the commanding officer.
"Very respectfully,
PAUL ST. C. MURPHY,
Captain. United States Marine Corps.
Commanding guard.
To the colonel commandant, headquar
ters United States Marine Corps, Wash

SPRINGFIELD, Mo., Aug. 10.âBald
win's Theater was crowded when the
Democratic Convention was called to
order at noon. Congressman Richard
P. Bland, introduced as temporary
chairman, was received with great ap
plause. In the course of his addrees
he declared his belief that eventually
Cuba and Porto Rico would come into
our country, but he desired no declara
tion on that question until these terri
tories were prepared to come in of their
own free will and accord and under
Democratic principles.
The first ballot resulted in the nomi
nation of Judge William C. Marshall
for Supreme Judge for the long term
and Judge Leroy B. Valliant for the
short term of the same office. The con
vention then adjourned until to-mor
row.
Late to-night the committee on reso
lutions agreed on a platform which in
dorses the Chicago platform; opposes
.acquisition of the Philippines or other
I territory in the Eastern hemisphere;
approves the construction of the Nica
raguan canal, which should be con
trolled by the United States; declares
that our navy should be kept equal to
j any emergency, and demands that
j Porto Rico and all Spanish territory in
the West Indies, except Cuba, shall be
i taken and held by the United States,
i Cuba to be allowed to establish its own
government and to be annexed only at
the desire of the people of the island.

AN ENOCH ARDEN
OF THE KLONDIKE
Romantic Tale of Sum
Dum Bay.
WILLIAM GEYES' LOST LOVE
RETURNS RICH TO FIND HIS
WIFE FAITHLESS.
Carries With Him a Sack of Gold,
but Finds Another Man in
Possession of His
Cabin.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
JI'XEAU, Alaska, Aug. I.â Woman's
â¢weakness and the Klondike have turned
out another Enoch Arden in Alaska. The
| coast of Sum Dura Bay, fifty miles south
| of Juneau, where thr boats are drawn
up on the beach, and where, too, lay an
chors with flukes "rusty red." and where
i children play as in the sand where Annie
j and Enoch and Philip played at man and
; wife, is the scene of this infelicity. Sum
i Dum 'has two mills grinding tjold out of
i ore day and night. They are at the Sum
Dum Chief and the Bald Eagle mines.
Two years ago Williams Geyes built and
furnished a cottage, settled his young
wife within, and set out for the Yukon
Basin to find a quicker fortune than he
rouid make as foreman in a mine's tun
nel. William promised to return in v
year. A year passed, and then six months
as with Enoch's wife, before the waiting
bride in the cottage gave up looking hope
fully for William down the Dattt that led
from the house to the sea. Then, heeding
the importunities of a stalwart boss of a
pit gang she. being in need of the nimble
sixpence, took him into her home as a
solitary boarder. Thus eventually Wil
liam's castle became one of "dissolving
sand."
William returned from the Alaskan
wilds last week, filled with fond antici
pations of a cozy home, a waiting wife
who would cling to his shoulders on the
threshold and pull him down to ki^s her
upturned face. He had a buckskin pack
bulging with gold and heavy with the
fortune he had made, for he had been
In with the early rush and located on a
pup hanging to the main valley of El
Dorado. He did not stop at the inn
near the beach, nor make inquiries about
the Annie ho had left two years before,
but walked straight up the road which
skirts the mountain toward the cottage.
It was evening and a light shone in the
window. There was no protecting shadow
of a yew tree and no secret peeping
through the window for him. He walked
boldly up to the door and knocked, and
Btepped in.
This Philip Ray and his Annie were
happily at supper. She was bending: over
him. pouring out his tea. Though this
Philip Ray was far from being stirred
by the loyal, fatherly sentiments of Ten
nyson's noble Philip, his devotion being
of the grosser sort, not solemnized either
by the church or the law, it needed no
second glance from Geyes to under
stand the light In his wife's eyes as
she quickly turned from the table to the
door.
Where he lodged that night Is not
known in Sum Dum. It was probably out
under the favoring cedars in his blank
ets, with a heavy heart and abject lone
liness and his bag of gold that he had
won for her as bedfellows. He certainly
did not stop In the cottage, but Philip
did.
Next morning when the Sealion. the
small steamer for Juneau, was sighted,
Geyes and his wife were seen walking
down the road to the beach together.
They stood aside from the crowd as the
boat came in. He was overheard to say
to her:
"You have made your choice; now
stay with it. I hope you will do as well
as I."
Carrying his load of gold and the heav
ier burden of a faithless wife, he went
aboard. She walked slowly back up the
road, twice turning her head. When s. it
reached the bridge she faced about, stood
with hand shading her eyes, gazing at the
receding steamer for a time, then she
whirled about with a swish of her skirts
and walked without hesitation bark to
the home her husband built and left to
shelter another.
Geyes is now in Juneau. Since things
have turned out so he hardly knows
what to do with his money, some $10,000.
HAL HOFFMAN.
CUP DEFENDER TO BE
BUILT BY AMERICANS
Three Young Yachtsmen Will Form
a Syndicate for the Purpose
in Case of a Match.
NEW YORK, Aug. 10.â It is reported
at Newport, R. 1., that Herman B.
Duryea, Harry P. Whitney and Edwin
D. Morgan, as a Byndirate. are to build
a cup defender if the America cupmatch
is made, though they are thoroughly
non-committal in regard to the matter.
Captain "Nat" Herreshoff was there to
see them last evening, when he and
Mr. Duryea had a long conference.
Mr. Duryea seems to be the head of
this syndicate, if, indeed, it is a fact.
He is one of the most capable American
yachtsmen and has sailed European
as well as American waters.
TOOK A SHOT AT A DOCTOR.
Mrs. W. H. Pool of Santa Rosa
Makes a Sensation.
SANTA ROSA, Aug. 10.â The office of
Dr. S. M. Rohr, a prominent physician
of this city, was to-day invaded by Mrs.
W. H. Pool, wife of ex-Deputy County
Recorder Pool, who, after chatting quiet
ly a few moments, suddenly drew a re
volver from the folds of her gown and
fired point blank at the doctor, but miss
ed him. As the doctor's office Is situated
in a prominent part of the city considera
ble excitement resulted for a short time.
The announcement appearing in this
morning's Press-Democrat that the doc
tor was to be married to-night was at
first supposed to have had something to
do with the affair, but subsequent inves
tigation shows that the lady had been
in a highly nervous condition for sev
eral days, and that the affair was sim
ply a result of a severe mental strain.
No arrests have been made.
FIRE AT SUSANVILLE.
Masonic Temple Destroyed by the
Falling of a Chandelier.
SUSANVILLE, Aug. 10.â About 9:45 last
evening a chandelier in the banquet room
of Masonic Temple, sustaining five oil
lamps, fell, scattering the oil over the

ties for extinguishing the fire, but all that
could be done under the circumstances
was done, and resulted in the conilning
of thf: fire within the wails of the Ma
sonic Temnle. The walls of the burned
building stand Intact. The insurance on
the structure is $16,000 and loss about the
same. The mail matter in the Postofflce
was saved. Charles Hampton had his
right arm broken- above the wrist, both
bones being fractured, while lighting the
fire.

Ten of the twelve boats reached that
port in safety, accompanied by the tug
Resolute and the steam schooner South
Portland. The Western Star lies on a
reef near the mainland, opposite Ka
diak Island. The Pilgrim is in False
Pass, where she will be repaired.
Immediately upon the arrival of the
ten steamers they were put on the
beach for a thorough overhauling.
After their long ocean voyage they ar
rived in a much better condition than
could be hoped for in view of the re
peated disasters reported concerning
them.
The trouble on the steamer Progreso
still continues at St. Michael, accord
ing to the report brought down by the
Conemaugh. Captain Gilboy had suc
ceeded in getting some of the passeng
ers ashore, only to have them sent back
by the military authorities. But few
of the passengers had sufficient money
to pay their passage up the river. The
steamer will likely soon return to Seat
tle.
The steamers Laurada and Brixham
were still unloading. The latter is said
to be short of food. The Seattle No. 1
had departed up the river July 27, with
a big load. The Merwin had also gone
up the Yukon. No steamer had arrived
from Dawson for several days. Captain
Riekmers of the Conemaugh states that
the Leelanaw sailed about July 26 for
San Francisco. About the same time
the Noyo left for Seattle. The tug
Resolute, South Portland and Grace
Dollar were all ready and expected to
leave August 1. The latter steamer had
returned from a successful trip to
Kotzebue Sound and has considerable
mail on board. Captain Edgett of New
York, who went in command o/ the
Grace Dollar, Is not expected to survive
the trip, as soon after leaving Puget
Sound he was stricken down with
Bright's disease. Captain Aray. the
pilot, is In command of the steamer.

No Texas Fever in Tulare County.
HANFORD. Aug. 10.â Reports of Texas

ESTATE LEFT BY
PRINCE BISMARCK
Consists Principally of
Land.
VALUE HAS BEEN OVERRATED
probably less than twenty
million marks.
Statement That the Ex-Chancellor
Was Buried at Friedrichsruhe
. . to Spite the Kaiser Is
False.
Special cable to The Call and the New York
H^raM. Copyrighted. 18SS. by James Gor
don Bennett.
HAMBURG, Aug. 10.â Bismarck is re
ported to have left Â£2,000,000, part of
which is depostted In the Bank of Eng-
I land. As a matter of fact Bismarck
was about the last man in the world to
place money in foreign keeping, and
this statement I am able to vouch for
from personal knowledge. That the
Bank of England has a single shilling
of his money in its vaults is pure inven
tion; also the value of Bismarck's prop-
J erty is ridiculously overrated. It will
! be found to represent considerably less
I than 20,000,000 marks, consisting prin
cipally of landed estates which bring
very small return on the capital value
at which they are estimated. For one
in his position Bismarck died a poor
man.
With regard to the statement that
the family insisted upon burying Bis
| marck at Friedrichsruhe in order to
; spite the Emperor, there is not a word
of truth in it. The facts in a nutshell
are these: Whereas, the Gladstone
family disregarded the wishes of the
Grand Old Man, who desired to be bur
ied at Hawarden, Prince Herbert held
those of his father as sacred, insisting
on carrying out his wish, which was
that he be buried at Friedrichsruhe on
a hill opposite the Schloss.
A surreptitious attempt was made
last Monday night to photograph Bis
marck on his deathbed by two photog
raphers with the connivance of a for
ester in the employ of the Bismarck
family, but the plates have since been
seized and confiscated.
ADMIRAL KIRKLAND
PASSE* A GOOD DAY
Physicians Agree That His Condition
Is Improved and His Chances
for Recovery Excellent.
VALL.EJO, Aug. 10.â Admiral Kirkland
is reported to-night as having passed a
very good day, no symptoms of fever or
oth^r complications setting in. He is at
tended by a trained nurse, who was sum
moned from San Francisco by Dr. Taylor
yesterday, and Dr. J. R. Waggener, sur
geon of "the yard, is in constant attend
ance. The greatest trouble the patient
has experienced to-day was from the ef
fect of the ether administered to him
when the operation was performed yes
terday. He was inclined to be weak this
morning, but rallied at noon, and is re
ported'as resting easy at this hourâ 7
o"clock. The physicians agree that the
admiral's condition is improved, and the
chances of recovery are excellent unless
peritonitis sets in. Every precaution will
be taken to prevent this.

Emma : Carrie, I thfnk Elsie mates such a mistake to be taking
tonics all the time. My experience is that a tonic is
only good after I have had a regular house cleaning,
and after that I don't seem to need any tonic. It is
remarkable how well Ripans Tabules suit my case. I
don't take one once & week, but whenever I do they
do the business.
Carrie : The tabules contain nux, and that is a tonic.
Emma : 1 don't care what they contain, they are just wonderful.

INDIANAPOLIS WHEEL RACES
ANNUAL GATHERING OF THE
LEAGUE.
One of the Features of the^ Day's
Events a Bace Between a Tan
dem, Three Triplets and'
Three Quads.
Special Dispatch to The CaJl.
. INDIANAPOLIS, Aug. 10.â The attend
ance at the '98 L. A. W. meet is not large,
but those here are enjoying themselves.
Up to 6 o'clock this evening 2612 league
"men had registered at headquarters.
* To-night a minstrel show was given at
English's Opera-house for the wheelmen
and their ladies, and an all-night smoker,
with vaudeville programme, is on at the
park. The Pioneers' banquet occurred at
the Grand Hotel to-night.
Broken records, two in number, and
surprises in every contest marked the
races of the first day of the. national
meet. The circuit men held their own,
but met defeat in the championship con
test at the hands of a man who has con
tinually been among the "also rans" on
the circuit, and who had piled up only
eight points in a season's work in the
championship.
Owen Kimble ("Old Kaintuck") proved
the two-mile champion of America, and
his win of the great contest was of the
cleanest order, and Just beyond the slight
est shade of a doubt.
The two-mile championship and half
mile championship for amateurs both
went to George H. Collett of New Haven,
â¢ who proved the apdoubted king in the
amateur class. Kracmcr of Newark and
Hausman, the tandem mate of Collett, and
Joe Rodgers, the Philadelphlan, carried
aw.ty the honors, no Western amateur
being able apparently to hold his own
against them.
But the contest In the two-mile na
tional championship and the world's re
cord were overshadowed in interest by
the multiple handicap, in which a tan
dem team, thrt^ triplet teams and three
quad teams competed. Becker, Mortons,
Martin and Nat Butler, the scratch team,
won. They started up to the front in
the long line, which formed early in the
contest, and the Johnson record-holding
â¢triplet team, record 1:41, gave it a good
race. The finish was hair-raising, but
not close, the interest and the excitement
occurring as the teams shifted around for
position while going at world-record gait.
The Johnson, Monroe and Fernwalt triple
team gained second and the Major Taylor
triplet team gained third. The timeâ
3:25 3-sâ broke the record of 3:52 and extra
prize money was awarded to the win
ning team.
Another record for the track was nar
rowly missed in the morning, when Major
.Taylor made a wonderful ride to victory
in the mile handicap, in 2:0)1-5, the mark
of Sims being missed by but one-fifth of '
.a second.

which says that at a recent meeting of

mediately take action and that orders
â¢were issued for the Carlists to assemble.
â¢ It is further saJd to be reported that
Don Carlos personally enters Spain on
Monday or Tuesday next, and that in the
meanwhile 180,000 rifles and quantities of

It seems the excitable old individual,
â¢ Conlon, who had a young man arrested
1 in Sausalito last Monday for stealing $I^o

Evidently Marcus Da-ly remembers well
the result of the duels between Miss
Woodford and Freeland, The Bard and
Troubadour and Domino and Henry of
j Navarre, for ho recently said to the rep
resentatlve of the New fork Tribune,
! after the owners of Ornament had tried
!to drive him into matching Hamburg
' against the four-year-old crack:
"I do not believe in matches, although 1
< : did race Tammany against Lamplighter.
1 believe in racing for the prizes offered
by the clubs and abiding by the results
of the contests. However. I will not
stand in the way of anything that will
JUncrease the public interest in racing. I
jjleave my horseu to my trainer's judg
ment, and never interfere with his man
agement."
Tommy Burns, king of the lightweights
around Chicago since Clawson left, will
ride for Mr. Belmont in the Futurity, and
may be employed by the jockey club's
president the balance of this season and
all of next.
There is talk of the formation of a
horsemen's protective association at Chi
cago â in fact, a petition is In circulation
among the owners. This petition declares
that men have charge of racing affairs
there not interested in a single race horse
and merely owning the tracks. They also
declare that these men are degrading the
sport of kings. The racing men also de
sire a voice in the selection of starters
and assistant starters, judges and
stewards. It is to be hoped the as
sociation in course of formation around
the Windy City will accomplish more
than the one organized here last winter.
Willie Martin, by many pood Judges
pronounced the best horse pilot in this or
any other country, but not as jealous of
his reputation for always trying to win
as a Fnrdham or an Isaac Murphy, signed
a contract the other day in Saratoga to
ride for the Messrs. Fleischmann during
the season of 1W)&, according to the Cin
cinnati Enquirer. It is this firm that only
last week released Tod Sloan. Martin will
receive a salary of not less than $15,000
per annum. Tod got $17,500. it is alleged.
That Martin should ever leave Pat Dunne
will amaze those who know the clever
pigskin knight well, for only last winter
he declared he would remain with Durfne
as long as the latter wanted him.

DEWEY MOVED BY THE
THANKS OF CONGRESS
Expresses His (Jratitude to Living
ston of Georgia, Who Intro
duced the Resolutions.
ATLANTA, Ga., Aug. 10.âCongress
man Livingston of Georgia has re
ceived this letter from Admiral Dewey:
FLAGSHIP OLYMPIA, Off Cavite,
Philippine Islands, Juno 17.â My Dear Sir:
I have just learned from the last papers
that I am indebted to you for the Intro
duction in \he House of Representatives
of the resolutions extending to me the
thanks of Congress for the naval en
gagement of Manila Bay May 1.
I need hardly tell you that I am most
sincerely grateful to you as the author
of that resolutionâ bringing, as it does
the highest honor that can come to an
American naval officer in his professional
careerâ but it is also a great pleasure to
acknowledge my debt of gratitude and to
t..ank you in unstinted measure for the
part you took in obtaining for me that
greatest distinction.
It is a source of additional pleasure to
me, a Vermonter, that the braver of the
resolution was not a man from the North.
but one from the far South. This is one
of the good signs of the times. In the
hour of danger there is no South, no
North, but one united country. May we
never hear of sectionalism again. There
are no lines drawn in the navy. I need
not say it may interest you to know that
my flag lieutenant. Lieutenant Brumby,
is a Georgian by birth and appointment.
Again thanking- you most cordially, I
remain very gratefully and sincerely,
GEORGE DEWEY.
To the Hon. L. F, Livingston, House
of Representatives.

THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, AUGUST 11, 1898.
FOOTPAD METHODS
WIN THE DAY FOR
"JIM" REA'S GANG
Santa Clara County Primaries
Only a Farce With the
"Boss" as Manager.
Election Judges Detected Shamefully Stuffing
Ballot Boxes While Police Drive
Honest Men Away.
SAN JOSE, Aug. 10.â It Is almost cer
tain that "Jim" Rea and the boodle
gang carried the primaries to-day. The
election was one of the liveliest in the
history of the city. The Rea gang
turned out in force and defeated the
Good Government Club people and the
Independent Republicans.
Never before was such dirty politics
de-no in the Garden City. As predicted
in The Call a few days ago ballot box
stuffing, illegal voting and wholesale
voting of Democrats were the means
employed by "Boss" Rea and the Mac
kenzies to carry the (lay. Election of
ficers had been coached in crooked
methods and when the polls opened this
morning they were skilled in their
sleight-of-hand work. Evidences of
ballot box stuffing and all kinds of
fraud are plentiful in four wards of the
city and adjoining suburbs.
In these precincts the Rea gangsters
worked like Trojans and with the de
termination to capture the delegations
by any means. Aiding them were gang
office-holders and their deputies, and
back of these forces was the riff-raff of
the Democratic party. The police force,
under the direction of Chief Kidward,
worked openly at the polls, as did the
Fire Department, and this in the face
of the fact that the city charter dis
tinctly says: _.
"No member of the Police or Fire
Department shall interfere with poli
tics on an election day, or at any other
time, other than to cast his vote."
Teachers in the city schools also
rustled up votes for the gang.
It is to the riff-raff of the Democracy
that "Boss" Rea owes his success, for
over one-third of the votes cast were
from this class.
The Rea forces were out in such num
bers that they had things their own
way, and they jostled and sneered at
the better citizens as they stepped up
to vote. Crooked work was done aIJ
. ivi-r the city, but it was more particu
larly noticeable in the Third Ward.
Here there were complaints of fraud
being practiced by election officers all
day, and several times the ballot-box
stutters were caught in the act 'and
openly accused. They took particular
pains to harass the Good Government ]
Club people, and their watchers were j
shoved away from the polls.
The officers in charge of the election
booth located at Holilster Stables on
First street, near San Carlos, were:
Judge, William Dreischmeyer; inspec
tor, George A. Clark. Hore the trouble
began before 7 o'clock, when Charles J.
Cornell, proprietor of a notion store
and one of the most prominent busi
ness men of the city, detected Dreisch
meyer substituting another ballot for
one he inte-nded to cast. He ncruprrt
the election official of the act and fle- .
manded his ballot. Dreipehmeyer re- j
fused to give it up and voted the ballot j
ie had substituted for Cornell's. After ;
some words, during which Dreinrh
meyer called Cornell a liar, the latter
eft. Cornell went before a notary and j
Tiade the following affidavit:
I, Charles J. Cornell, a resident
and voter of the Third Ward of
the city of San Jose, do, under
oath, solemnly swear, that at the
Republican primary held at the
polling place in the Hollister
stable, in said city of San
Jose, Third Ward, the ticket
which I presented for voting
was deliberately withheld and
another attempted to be sub
stituted. On my demand to see
the ticket about to be deposited
the judge refused to show it to
me and put it in his pocket, de
claring that my ticket had been
deposited. And I was thereby
disfranchised in this election.
CHARLES J. CORNELL.
Subscribed and sworn to by
Charles J. Cornell before me,
this 10th day of August, A. D.
1898. WESLEY PIEPER,
Notary Public in and for the
County of Santa Clara. State
of California-
Similar charges were made all day.
L. D. Webster caught Dreischmeyer at
the same trick. He snatched the bal
lot out of Dreischmeyer's hand and
found that Dreischmeyer had substi
tuted a gang ticket for the one he
wanted to vote. M. D. Phelps is also
positive that his ballot was changed.
In the Third Ward were 48) votes
cast, of which number the Good Gov
ernment Club received 136. Thar3 arc
six precincts in the ward, and accord
ing to accurate tally 50 votes were cast
for the Good Government ticket in tha
Fifteenth Precinct. There 1b every rea
son to believe that this ratio should
hold good for the other five precincts,
which would mean a vote of 300 in the
ward for good government. Instead it
was only 136. This can be accounted
for only by the stuffing of the ballot
box and the sleight-of-hand work of
Dreischmeyer.
In the Second Ward there wan an
equally bad state of affairs. There
George W. Lee and F. C. Jacobs, both
named for delegates to the County Con
vention, were judge and inspocr.or re
spectively. A pasteboard bandbox was
used for a ballot-box, and despite the
protest of citizens they refused to use
the regular ballot-box. They stated
that such were their instructions from
thf> Republican County Cantral Com
â¢mittee.
.Mitchell Phillips and Harry Edward;?,
prominent business men of the city,
were on watch in the interest of the
Good Government Club. Rea's election
officers ordered everybody out of the
booth, including a Deputy Sheriff. Phil
lips and others objected to this on their
right as American citizens. Rea was at
once communicated with, and he order
ed Chief of Police Kidward to take his
force and clear out the intruders, as
with Phillips and Edwards present the
chance to discern crookedness was too
great. The patrol wagon responded
with six officers, and Phillips, Edwards
and the Deputy Sheriff were summar
ily ejected.
By this time quite a crowd had col
lected and Phillips and Edwards were
roundly applauded for the manly stand
they had taken. After this the gang
had things all its own way, but the
members of the Good Government Club
kept vigilant watch at the polls all day.
The gang ran things with the same
high hand in the First and Fourth
Wards. Here the percentage of Demo
crats voting was larger and ballot box
stuffing was not necessary.
In the suburbs about the city and in
I Santa Clara . the same gang methods
were employed. An attempt was made
to stuff the ballot box in the University
Precinct, but this was thwarted and the
Good Government Club carried the day.
S. B. "Ben-ill, judge in that precinct, is
accused of the act. When he appeared
on the scene this morning with the bal
lot box he refused to let any one look
in it. This was insisted on by people
present and a scuffle ensued for pus
session of the box. Terriil finally ob
tained the box and ran home. He re
turned in about fifteen minutes. He
made threats of using a revolver If
interfered with, but finally consented to
have the box examined. It was found
to be empty. There are grave suspi
cions, however, that the box was stuffed
when first presented.
These are but examples of the meth
ods employed by the gang, and it Is safe
to presume the same work was at
tempted by Rea men all over the
county.
The methods adopted by Boss Rea
will act as a boomerang. The citizens
of the county who are opposed to the
tactics of Buckley, from whom Ri:a
has evidently taken lessons, intend
carrying the fight to the end. Some of
the most prominent people in the city
say to-night that they would rather see
the Republican ticket deefated than to
win with Rea and his boodle gang in
control of affairs.
That the crooked work of the elec
tion officers will be investigated is cer
tain. The Grand Jury will be asked to
look into the methods of some of the
election officers, and it Is not improb
able that many of the gangsters who
acted in such a high-handed way to
day will be called upon to explain their
conduct. *
"Boss" Rea is happy to-night. He
says he has been vindicated and that
he is now content. The vindication
may afford him some slight comfort at
present, but it will cost him consider
able uneasiness before the matter is
settled.
The Good Government League will
continue its battle against boss rule
and "Jim" Rea.
"The members of the league," said
one of the offiecrs to-night, "realize
that intimidation, hundreds of Demo
cratic votes and the grossest frauds of
every kind tell the story of the farci
cal .Republican primary held here to
day. The frauds were not confined to
the city. They are to be found all over
the county. In Evergreen Precinct, for
example, where the highest Republi
can vote ever cast does not exceed
eighty-five, 121 vo;es were polled to
day. Old-time 'gang' Democrats who
never voted the Republican tickt.-t
voted in the primaries 10-day by the
hundred, and, we think, by the thou
sand. Ballots were changed by the
election officers, not only in San Jose,
but in Borne places in the country, bo
fore they were put into the ballot box.
The boxes were kept out of sight of the
public most of the time, The election
officers refused in many cases to ad
minister the oath to gang' voters
when challenged, while to the Good
Government League voters who were
challenged they administered, not the
oath prescribed by the State Central
Committee, but a test of their own,
fearfuly and wonderfully made.
"But all these irregularities will be
duly aired in the contests which we
propose making in the county, Congres
sional and State conventions. We rro
pose fighting the Kea gang to a finish.
We are not beaten. The fight has just
begun."
Another member of the Good Gov
ernment League said:
"The farcical Republican primary
held to-day has aroused intense bit
terness among the solid citizens and
taxpayers of the Republican League,
who were made aware of the gang's in
iquities only by being confronted m a
practical exemplification of primary
politics. The gang appointed all the
election officers, any represen
tation at the polling precincts to the
opposition. In many cases the judgt-s
and inspectors were candidates them
selves and absolutely refused permis
sion to inspect the count or remain in j
sight of the ballotbox. very evidence I
of predetermined fraud was visible in i
the flimsy character of the receptael-s
for ballots, consisting of paper band '
boxes and shirt and sock boxes, and ar- i
rangements made for receiving and d.-
popiting the votes. So glaring were the j
frauds that the whole community feels
outraged and insulted, and the open i
condemnation of Rea's methods is not
at all promising for his nominees.
"The Good Government League pro
poses to contest the county and carry
the fight to the State and CongreH
sional conventions, assiduously, deter
minedly and systematically. No quar
ter will be given and there will be no
compromise with the rogues. The fight
is on principle and for blood. The re
election of Rea's brother with such op
position Is considered hopeless by his
most sanguine adherents, and while
they feel jubilant at carrying a pri
mary by stuffing the boxes, voting
Democrats and using every fraudulent
means to accomplish their ends, they
yet feel that only the outposts have
been won and that the battle royal Is
yet to come at Sacramento and in the
Congressional and county conventions."
"We are in the fight to stay until the
end," said another member of the Good
Government League, "and 'Boss' Rea
and his minions will understand It be
fore the campaign is over.
"The Republican voters left in dis
gust. More than one-half the votes cast
at the polls were cast by Democrats.
Many of them openly confessed this
fact. The Good Government League
does not look upon this farce as a de
feat. It will supply conclusive evidence
to prove to the members of the Repub
lican State Central Committee the ille
gality of the election."
Rea, when seen at midnight, said that
he waH satisfied that "his friends"
would represent Santa Clara County at
the State convention and that his same
good friends would be in the majority
tn the county convention next Satur
day. The Good Government League,
while not admitting defeat, as several
of the outlying towns are still to be
heard from, declares that while Rea
may be on the top of the ladder at
present the ladder will" be pulled from
under him on election day.

Troops Are to Be Forwarded as Fast
as Steamers Can Be Secured
for Their Transporta
tion.
Recent events in the Philippines have
caused the War Department to order the
remaining expeditionary forces in San
Francisco to be forwarded as fast as
transports can be secured to carry them
to Manila. This order was received at
military headquarters yesterday morning
in response to a telegram of inquiry sent
by Major General Merriam, asking for in
structions in regard to these troops.
The Arizona will be ready to receive
troops on Monday morning next, at which
time the soldiers assigned to that vessel
will embark. The steamer will prob
ably sail on the following day, Briga
dier General King, with one battalion
of the Twenty-third regiments, and re
cruits for other regiments will sail on
the Arizona.
The Scandia, with the Seventh Califor
nia and a detachment of recruits, will
sail about the end of next week.
It is expected that the Australia and
Sydney will reach this city from Manila
about the loth. They will be immediately
fitted out for a return trip to the Philip
pines with troops, and will Be followed by
the City of Peking, which is due here
about the 24th. These vessels will prob
ably carry the Fifty-first lowa, the Twen-
tieth Kansas and the First Tennessee.
There are now about 9300 expeditionary
troops in San Francisco. The Arizona and
Scandia. will take away 3300, leaving 6000
to be forwarded. This includes the Eighth
California, which was turned over to Ma
jor General Otis, and made part of the
expeditionary forces. The First Washing
ton has r.nt beon attached to the Eighth
Army Corps, and will therefore not go
in Manila, unless later orders are issued
i assigning- it to duty in the Philippines.
General Merrlam will probably not go to
Honolulu until after all of these troops
are on the way to Manila. Brigadier Gen
eral King held a long conference with him
yesterday in regard to the sailing of the
Arizona next week and the other trans
j ports that are to immediately follow.

CAMP BARRETT, Sather Tract, Aug.
10.â The greatest excitement witnessed at
Camp Barrett since its establishment pre
vailed this afternoon,- when it was an
nounced that Lieutenant Colonel Carring.
ton and Major \\ nitton had received word
from General Barrett at San Francisco to
the effect that in all probability ttie
Eighth Regiment will be on its way to
Manila in a very short time. Similar
hopeful news had been received by Cap
tain Barnes from his father, General
Barnes. The information from GenerUl
Barrett was to the effect that orders will
be isstied in a few days.
The news spread like wildfire through
the camp, and soldiers were seen running
frum tent to tent to hear a verification,
which was readily obtained. The men are
now as confident of being given an oppor
tunity to show their prowess at Manila
aa they are that they have been pegging
away at every-day drills for the past
month. Nothing else is discussed, and
every one is eagerly awaiting definite or
ders from headquarters. That these will
arrive 1n a day or two Is confidently be
lieved by all. from Lieutenant Colonel
Carrington down.
The Eighth was never designated as
consigned to either Cuba or the Philip
pines, but as It is a twelve company regi
ment It Is milto likely that it would be
given preference to some of the eight
cotnpany regiments now mobilized at San
Francisco.
CALLED TO WASHINGTON.
T. R. Turner to Confer With

T. R. Turner, inventor and patentee of
the Turner patent bunk, has been called
to Washington, D. C, by the quartermas

Company for the past twenty-four years.
All his spare time for twenty months -vaa
taken up in perfecting his bunk, and
he says that many a night he never had
a wink of sleep by thinking over altera
tions in his working model. The first
vessel fitted with the new bunks was the
steamer Queen, and since then a dozen
other vessels have been fitted with them,
and 10,500 placed in the transports that
have Bailed for Manila.

Mariposa.
The second detachment of the First New

Captain Pickarcl. and forty-four men
from Company D, under Second Lieuten

THE RAILROAD COMMISSIONERS
AND THE INJUNCTION.
The Robinson Case and Some Indian
Claims Considered at the Bi-
Monthly Session.
The eternal Robinson case was up again
for consideration by the Railroad Com
mission yesterday afternoon, and after a
two hours' discussion was left In exactly
the same state in which it was before the
meeting. The Commissioners started out
to arrive at some conclusion as to their
future actions in regard to the Robinson
matter. Since Judge Bahrs issued an in- j
junction restraining the Railroad Com- |
mission from further action in the prose- j
cution of the case nothing has been done I
by the Commissioners. The discussion
yesterday was to settle whether the Com
missioners should ignore Judge Bahrs'
restraining injunction or appeal from it
to the Supreme Court.
A great portion of the time was con
sumed by the announcement of George
W. Monteith that he would not in the
future associate himself with Attorney
General Fitzgerald in tue prosecution of
the suit. He had written a letter to
Fitzgerald in which he states in pretty
strong language that he will withdraw
from the case of Robinson versus the
Southern Pacific Company if Fitzgerald
determines to remain in it. The reasons
for his intention to sever himself from
further co-operation with his former as
sociate, Monteith asserts to be their in
ability to work together effectively and a
lack of understanding as to the proper
division of duties. Nothing was decided
by the commission, and the Robinson
matter has gone over for another two
weeka.
The commission received a short time
ago two letters addressed to the Gover
ernor in which the writers, Indians of
Butte County, complain that the railroad
company refuses them the privilege of
riding on the platforms of cars. They
claim that this right belongs to them, be
ing reserved by the Government for the
Indians at the time of the granting of
the charters to the railroad companies.
The Railroad "Commission informed Wil
liam F. Herrin of the Indians' claim and
the infraction of their rights, and re
ceived in reply an answer from the chief
counsel of the Southern Pacific which de
nies that any such reservation was ever
made or that such privileges exist. The
Railroad Commission dismissed the mat
ter on account of lack of jurisdiction.
THE BLOW THAT
JARRED KILPATRICK
SCHOOL DIRECTOR WALLER AND
THE EX-PRINCIPAL MEET.
They Exchange Compliments and
Kilpatrick Is Arrested on a
Charge of Assault.
Samuel M. Waller, School Director, and
E. C. Kilpatrick, ex-principal of the Bus
iness Evening School, met in the corri
dor of the City Hall, opposite the offices
of the Board of Education, yesterday af
ternoon, and an hour or two later Kil
patrick was arrested on a warrant from
Judge Mogan's court, charging him with
assault upon Waller. He was released on
his own recognizance by the Judge.
"Waller's version of the affair is that
Kilpatrick came up to him and held out
his hand, remarking, "Well, have you
forgiven me for the letter I wrote?" re
ferring to a letter Kilpatrick had written
to School Director Burns, making certain
charges against School Directors. Wal
ler said he did not want to speak to
him, and Kilpatrick turned away, after
telling Waller that he could go to a
warmer climate than California.
"What's that you say?" said Waller.and
going up to Kilpatrick struck him on the
shoulder. Kilpatrick made a motion for
his hip pocket, and Waller ran into the
Board of Education office.
Kilpatrick says that he and Waller ex
changed a few words ami he went toward
his friend A. W. Atherton, who was
with him. Waller came at him shouting
"What's that you say?" and struck him a
blow un the shoulder that jarred him so
that his hat fell off. AH the motion he
made as Waller rushed for the Board of
Education office was to stoop and pick
up his hat. He did not have a revolver
in hi? pocket, and had his overcoat over
his arm. He was very much surprised
when arrested aa Waller was the ag
gressor, and thinks it is a scheme to be
smirch him. as his suit against the
Board of Education comes up to-day.
A. W. Atherton, who was the only wit
ness to the affair, corroborates what Kil
patrick says, and thinks Kilpatrick's ar
rest an outrage.

Candidates for the Senatorial Appointment
Are Bidding for Popular

â¢ .The principal topic under discussion in
â¢ ...olfti.al circles during the past two days
.has been the expres I pinion on the
! Republican gubernatorial situation by the
â editors in newspapers in all
.pa : i-t- nted in The
â¢ '.('ail Tuesday morning. It Is generally
â¢<Â»onc! â¢ these opinions, c imlng

â¢and only trustworthy foundation upon

â  -'jiopiination for Governor.

s as well as to their po-
Hti< a . rs and "t 1 ers who are
taking an active Interest in the
â work of shaping events for the
â .copllng campaign. This was particularly
.title o-f the showing made by Henry T.
GsLge, the gubernatorial candidate from
.to Angeles. Contrary to the assertions
''(â¢: "tKe Gage boomers, the result shows
r !thftt the Los Angeles lawyer has no sup
. ..-"porters .outside of a portion of the Sixth
.\'and-.Seventh Congressional districts, a por
â  ytJoH of the State that gave McKlnley a
.- majority of only about 1000 over Bryan.
.<-,. "Knowledge of this fact has given Gages
candidacy a decided setback, as the Re-
V-puJJlicati managers appreciate the fact that

; : . : TJie -list of replies made to The Call's
â¢\ queries' also indicates that the Pardee
â  'boom has not penetrated far beyond the
â  Limits -of Alameda Countyâ a circum-
E-tar.ce that is not particularly surprising
.-â¢to' those who have watched the political
â¢ , tactics employed in the fostering of his
. gubernatorial boomlet. W. R. Davis has
'â¢; -.a' larger following than Pardee, and he
â ' share's- with Brown, Flint, Knight, Ellert
â  â  -airti â¢..Von the popularity of Republican
voters, in the northern and central por
â¢ Uons :of the State. Many prominent Re
:. publicans believe that some man not yet
"â¢..named- will be brought forward at the
â¢ proper moment and secure the nomina
tion.' .
'â '. I.V SI Grant of San Diego is in the city,
. Ipokinc after the interests of his 5ena
....1,, : boom. He has little to say for
publication regarding Gage's candidacy,
"but* has no hesitancy in stating that the
â¢â¢ souih cannot reasonably expect to be
'â â¢given both the Governor and the Senator
â¢â¢ in same year. As he and his many
friends believe that a southern man
â â¢should" be selected to succeed Senator
WY-h'ite the inference is plain. In this con
â â¢"-'ion it may be interesting to note the
. presence in the city of Sidney Perkins,
â¢private secretary to United States Sena
'. t.br ' Manna. He declares that the object
â¢-of- his' presence here is a desire to gain
â  a knowledge of the general political sit
â¢.ua.tlo.ii in the Pacific Coast States. While
'â¢this/may be true, those who profess to
he acquainted with the facts say that the
â¢â  primary object of his visit is to promote
:tlie. candidacy of U. S. Grant for the Sen
" :a-torial appointment. Some months ago
'/â lt was stated on what appeared to be
â¢â¢â¢excellent authority that the question of
': ing Grant's candidacy formed the
â '= principal topic of conversation at a din
". neT'. given by his mother to Senator
â¢ Hanha. Senator Elkins, Speaker Reed
and a number of other gentlemen who
" Were personal friends of President Grant
during -his lifetime and who have for
â¢xhany years occupied high places in the
â¢â .affair* of the Government. It is said j
â  that 3lrs. Grant expressed to these gen
. 'ti'ern'e!i "her earnest desire that the name I
'of. Grant should not be permitted to cease j
â â¢ %o -be associated with the conduct of
â¢V-publk;' affairs, and that it was her wish
â¢ "that 'â¢ one of her sons should become a
: â¢.â¢l-iii'ieU -States Senator. The expression
. of sa -laudable a desire met with the ap
â '-.ptpK-tii Of all present, and they agreed to
â  '-all- -within their power to assist U. S.

NEW REPUBLICAN
CLUB ORGANIZED
The Potrero Dewey Club
Formed With Nearly Two
Hundred Members.
The first branch of the Dewey Republi
can Central Club was organized Tuesday
night at 1442 Kentucky street, Potrero,
under the name of Dewey Republican
Club No. 1, with the following named of-
President, George W. Harlow; vice pres
ident. J. H. Price; secretary, R. J. Welch;
rvr. H. H. Olich, sergeant at arms,
! C. Rasmussen; executive committee, Geo.
W. Httrlow. R. Rasmussen, H. Holman, J.
H. Price, R. J. Welch.
One hundred and thirty-five Republi
cans signed the roll as members, and somÂ»j
fifty more who are employed at night
work and could not be present sent in
their names, expressing their desire to
become members.
President Harlow in a short address as
sured the members that the purpose of
the organization was to work in harmony
with the Republican party of the State
and city. The club will hold regru!ar
weekly meetings on Tuesday nights at the
place of org-anlzatlun.
VOTERo MUoI" REGISTER.
The lack of interest which has been
shown by voters in registration for the
forthcoming election is causing the party
leaders much uneasiness.
Major Frank McLaughlin, chairman of
the Republican State Central Committee,
and William H. Alford, chairman of the
Democratic State Central Committee,
held a conference yesterday to devise
some method of bringing out the voters.
The registration up to the present time
has fallen far short of what It should
have been. As no one can vote until he
has complied with this requirement it
means a small poll on election day.
The outcome of the discussion yester
day was the determination that each
party should send wagons about the
streets bearing huge signs requesting
their followers to attend to their regis
tration. The office for that purpose at
the City Hall has closed, but precinct
registration is now in progress. This will
continue until Saturday night, after
wnlch time no additional opportunity will
be afforded. It it has not been done
then the delinquent's vote will be lost.

M'NAB TURNED
DOWN BY BARRY
Contest in the Selection
of Delegates.
WHISPERING BOSS ROUTED
PHELAN'S HENCHMEN ASSIST
AT THE OBSEQUIES.
Francis J. Heney Declares the Elec
tion to Be Illegal and Will
Appeal to the State
Committee.
"Whispering" Gavin McNab's little
slate was smashed to smithereens last
night at the meeting" of the Committee
of One Hundred, which was selected some
time ago by the Gould-Alvord-McNab
combination to manage the affairs of the
local .Democracy.
The committee met for the purpose of
completing the list of delegates who are
to go to the State Convention. "Whisper
ing" Gavin had, as he thought, put up a
nice smooth scheme which would go
through, and only men who are favorable
to his nomination for Congress from the
Fourth District were on the slate. But
he failed to figure on James H. Barry and
his friends, and before the meeting ad
journed the latter demonstrated their
strength and frustrated the designs of the
"Whispering Boss."
Seventy-two members of the committee
were present at the meeting last evening.
Of these forty were controlled by McNab.
As sixty votes were necessary to elect
delegates under the provisions of the con
stitution of the committee, the balance
; of power rested with the friends and sup
i porters of Barry, who is out tooth and
j nail against McNab for the Congressional
nomination. Incidentally, it is worth
mentioning- here that "Whispering" Gavin
had a foreknowledge of defeat. Yester
day he made a proposition, through John
H. Twigg, to Barry that he (McNab;
would quit if Barry would. Barry would
not listen to the proposition, and Gavin
was informed that the fiery editor of the
Star would remain in the fight until he
met a worse fate than Cervera's.
Another development which brings de
spair to the heart of the aspiring boss is
that Mayor Phelan is a Barry man and
will support him through thick and thin
for the Congressional nomination.
McNab's strength heretofore in the com
mittee was partly due to the fact that all
the applicants for political jobs who are
on the committee believed that Phelan
was with him. Charles W. Fay, who
is supposed to be the Mayor's mega
phone, has trained with McNab, and the
hungry ones took this as an indication
that Phelan and the Whispering Boss
were pulling together. The Mayor's un
qualified indorsement of Barry has set
all doubts at rest as to where he stands,
and now the job chasers are deserting
McNab. .
Before a ballot was taken at the meet
ing last night the McNab men tried to
secure the passage of a motion to the
effect that all the candidates for dele
gates to the State convention who re
ceived the highest number of votes at
the last meeting should be declared elect
ed This was voted down after a long
wrangle. A ballot was then taken an*
seven Barry men were elected. As it was
necessary to select thirty more, a com
promise was agreed to. Sammy Braun
hart made a motion, which was carried,
that the representatives of the districts
in which contests existed get together
and agree upon the delegates. This was
another McNab scheme, but it did not re
sult as its promoters expected. Braun
hart failed even to carry his own district.
He and ex-Registrar Hinton clashed on the
selection of the delegates from the Twen
ty-ninth, and when the hospital corps at
the secretary's desk brought in the dead
and wounded it was found that Braun
hart had secured but one man to Hin
ton's three. â 
The selection of the delegates from the
Thirty-first Assembly District brought on
arother fight. The combatants were Jos
eph Leggett and R. P. Doolan. Doolan
was the only representative present from
the district, and he recommended three
names. Leggett wished to substitute
Charles H. Holcomb, president of the Cen
tral Democratic Club, for one of Doolan's
selections. He said Mr. Holcomb was
president of a Democratic club of over
900 members, and that as the representa
tive of such a large body of Democratic
citizens he ought to be sent as a delegate
to the State Convention. Doolan retorted
that Mr. Leggett was not a representative
from the. Thirty-first and had no right to
dictate who the nominees from the dis
trict should be. Doolan's recommenda
tion was adopted and Mr. Holcomb was
snowed under. This action brought
Francis J. Heney to his feet. He declared
that he would appeal to the State Central
Committee and seek to have the action
of the committee invalidated, as the
method of electing the delegates was un
constitutional; that the delegates were not
being chosen by ballot and none of those
named in the compromise had received the
requisite sixty votes because they were
elected by a vlve voce majority which was
decided by the chairman.
Harmony was again restored and the
remainder of the delegates were selected.
When the names were read by the secre
tary the members of the convention
checked them off, designating them
as " Barry or McNab men as
they went along. After adjourn
ment notes were compared and it was
agreed that Barry and his opponent had
an equal number of followers among the
delegates and that the doubtful ones were
more than liable to go to Barry and give
him a distinct advantage when the dis
trict convention is held. _ â ;.:â ;
The seven delegates elected by ballot
were: Charles Keisel, Twenty-ninth Dis
trict; N. Cellar, Thirty-first; F. C. Cleary,
T.Â» Kelly and E. D. Sullivan, Thirty-third;
R. Lynch and R. Webb and A. W.
Thompson, Thirty-fourth. â 
Those chosen as a result of the com
promise are: John F. More, Alex J. Es
telita, Emil Shuck and D. F. Murphy,
Twenty-eighth District; James P. Laliy.
Thomas Faulkner, Michael Lucy and
John Allen, Twenty-ninth District; James
Farrell. George Smith, John Devenney,
Thirtieth; Dr. Robert Lowry, John Reid,
Maior James Enright, Thirty-first; J. J.
McManus. W. .7. Rellly, Michael McGrath,
William J. Renwlck, Charles Kelly, Thir
ty-second; Robert Allen, James Kings
ton Thirty-third: Dennis O'Keefe. Patrick
Casscrly. John Salnislno, W. D. .Crowley,
Thlrtv-slxth; L. W. Lovey. Thirty-ninth;
O. M. Goldaracena. Forty-first: L. V.
Merle, George Krimphoff, Forty-fourth.
There were no contests in the Thirty
fourth, Thirty-ninth and Forty-first dis
tricts. The delegates selected on the com
promise were those who received the high
est votes on the first ballot.
CRAMER LOST.
The testimony was closed yesterday In
the suit of Herman Cramer against the
Singer Manufacturing Company for $1
damages and an injunction against the
infringement of a patent treadle on a
sewing machine. Circuit Judge Beatty
of Idaho, who was acting for Judge Mor
row, instructed the jury to bring in a ver
dict for the defendant, which was done.
Cramer is a resident of Sonora, Tuol
umne County, and fifteen years ago in
vented an improvement on sowing ma

LIVELY CONVENTION CONTEST
DELEGATES ALMOST COME TO
BLOWS.
Maguire's Candidacy Is Indorsed
and Senator White Is Urged
to Stand for a Re
election.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 10.â Interest in
matters political in this city to-day
centered in the Democratic convention
for the election of delegates tc/ the
State convention and the selection of
a County Central Committee. Judge
Albert M. Stephens was elected chair
man. In his speech accepting the honor
he said:
"I am glad the Democratic party has
cast out of the party that tool of the
monopolies. Grover Cleveland."
The morning session was enlivened
by the contest in Cahuenga Precinct,
which resulted in the throwing out of
J. W. Mitchell, a man who has been
prominently identified with the Democ
racy of this county for many years,
and the seating of G. W. Albright, a
negro, in his stead. During the discus
sion accompanying this action the lie
was freely passed and at times per
sonal encc-unters between Mitchell and
members of the convention were barely
averted.
The committee on resolutions com
mended Hon. Stephen M. White for the
fidelity, ability, integrity and courage
with which he had discharged his du
ties as a United States Senator, placing
him in the forefront of the great states
men and constitutional lawyers of the
nation, and extended to him the thanks
of the convention and the Democratic
party for the great services rendered
by him to the people of the Stats of
California.
The resolutions Indorse the adminis
tration and promise to sustain the ad
ministration in the vigorous prosecu
tion of the war against Spain until its
final and triumphant close.
The convention indorsed the candi
dacy of James G. Maguire for Governor
and instructed the delegates to vote for
him as a unit, and further instructed
the delegates to secure the adoption by
the State convention of a plan of co
alition with the silver Republicans and
the Populist parties to carry c*rt the
plan recently outlined at Sacramento.
Considerable friction occurred during
the selection of the delegates to the
State Convention, particularly so In the
Third and Fourth Supervisorial Dis
tricts, where the fusionists were unable
to fully deliver to the kilted McNab
and his fellow self-constituted DeÂ«r>o
cratic bosses, Alford and Gould, the
clean slate they had oromised. The re
sult is that out of the eighty-one dele
gates selected at least twenty are anti
fusionists.
The appearance of Senator Stephen
M. White upon the floor of the conven
tion during the evening session was
made the occasion of a most heattv
greeting on the part of the members, to
which Senator White responded, thank
ing the convention for its expression at
confidence. Speaking upon the annexa
tion of territory by the United States
he said:
"I doubt the wisdom of the acquisi
tion of an alien race or the acquisition
of the Philippine Islands. Shall we
bring into our grand republic an alien
race which does not understand our
institutions? A republic cannot exist
unless it is controlled by intelligence.
We less than all can afford to bring
into her confines a people who are un
able to meet the requirements of citi
zenship. We ought to remember that
we are to-day adopting a new policy
and we ought to pause.
"I am not yet ready to say what po
sition I shall take regarding the
treaty. I give to it every moment of
my time, and I shall act according to
my convictions, irrespective of the
opinions of others."
Senator White then announced that
he would retire to private life at the
end of his term in the Senate; that he
was too poor to again become a can
didate and must, therefore, decline a
re-election.
It was the sense of the convention,
however, that Senator White had
nothing to say about the matter, and
that it was his duty to again offer
himself for the place. The convention
adjourned at 11:30.

PARDEE'S MARKS
ARE CARVED ON
THE DELEGATES
The Doctor Does Some of His
Ward Politics in the
Encinal City.
Fresh Proof That He Is Preparing to Knife
Davis and Sell Out to
Brown.
OAKLAND, Aug. 10.â "Anything to cap
ture the delegation" Is Dr. George C Par
dee'd motto just at present, and he is fol
lowing it out to the letter. "Trust not
your closest friends" is another, conse
quently the doctor has cast dignity to
the winds and, refusing to rely on his
lieutenants, oversees every detail of his
campaign.
The methods pursued by Dr. Pardee
would be highly creditable to Chris Buck
ley, Sam Rainey or "Whispering" Mc-
Nab, but when adopted by an aspirant for
the Republican nomination for Governor
they stamp him as a man utterly un
worthy of the confidence of the people
and unfitted for any position above that
of ward boss.
Pardee's latest plot was exposed to-day.
It was a daring attempt to capture the
nine delegates from Alameda City, the
Republicans of that place being in open
revolt against Pardee, due primarily to
his insolent declaration that he would
not trust the Republicans to name their
own delegates, but would perform that
duty himself. The Alamedans rebelled
and asserted that they would select dele
gates uopledged to any candidate to rep
resent them at Sacramento. Last night
representatives from the various Repub
lican clubs met at Harmony Hall and
nominated an unpledged ticket, as fol
lows: P. S. Teller, A. R. Hamlin, J. C.
Bates Jr., Dr. C. L. Tisdale, Henry Sever
ing, J. L. toallentine. J. B. Lanktree, H.
Tank and George Britt. The clubs par
ticipating In this election were the Vet
eran Republican Club, Independent Re
publican Club, Young Men's Republican
Club and the Associated Precinct clubs.
Although instructed to name an un
pledged delegation it is plain that Pardee
got in his fine work, and it also gives
the best proof yet obtainable of the se
cret deal between Pardee and Lou Brown,
for of the nine men selected six are
avowedly for Pardee, and the remaining
three have openly expressed a prefer
ence for Brown. Not daring to take
them all himself, owing to the predom
inant Davis sentiment in Alameda, Par
dee has bartered away three delegates
from Alameda County to an outsider, be
sides proving to all the world that his
frecjuent assertions of good will toward
Davis, coupled with the promise to give
that gentleman his support, should he
fail to secure a majority of the county
delegation for himself, were as insincere
as most of his declarations.
When The Call first exposed Pardee's
alliance with Brown the doctor attempt
ed to bunko the people of this county
into the impression that he denied the
charge by devoting some space in his
newspaper to a tirade against a man he
well knew was not responsible for the ex
pose. His bluff being promptly called,
Pardee has since maintained discreet si
lence on the subject. Last Sunday Par
dee even promised J. W. Thomford of
Haywards that if he would go to Sac
ramento for him Pardee would throw his
votes to Brown at the proper time,
though less than an hour before the doc
tor had promised Daniel Chisholm of the
same place, who is a Davis supporter,
that Pardee's votes would be given to
Davis in case Pardee could not win out.
The Encinal City Republicans are fu
rious to-day over the deceit that has been
practiced upon them, and it Is certain
that another ticket in opposition to the
Pardee-Brown "unpledged" delegates will
be in the field at Saturday's primaries.
With all his scheming to defeat Davis,
Dr. Pardee continues to fill the columns
of his organ with frantic appeals for a
solid delegation, pleading with Davis in
one column to consent to such a plan,
and scolding at him in the next for not
doing so. Air. Davis would admit him
self to be a veritable infant at the game
were he to agree to any such proposi
tion. Aside from Pardee's underhanded
attacks on Davis, there are many reasons
why the latter gentleman should not con
sent to any such arrangement. In the
first place, in view of the promised as
sistance of the Buckley-Maguire high
binder tong at the primary Saturday, it
is reasonably certain that Pardee will
control fully half of the delegation, if
he does not capture a substantial ma
jority.
His men from Alameda County will rep
resent the sum total of his strength In
the convention, for The Call's canvass of
editorial opinions throughout the State
has convinced even Pardee himself that
he will not go into the convention with
any supporters outside of his own coun
ty. But were Davis to consent to the
unit rule, Pardee, having a majority,
would be enabled to go to Sacramento
with a solid delegation from home, and
this would give him a prestige that
might be of great value, for by trading
on other offices it would be possible for
him to gain enough outside support to
give him the nomination now or at least
tie it up for him four years nonce.
On the other hand. Davis will have a
considerable following from the outside
at the very start, and every delegate he
takes from this county and elsewhere n-ill
stand by him to the last. But were he
to go to Sacrami-nto without a single
delegate from home, he would never cut
any figure in the proceedings. As it is,
after Pardee's friends have performed
their duty by giving him the vote on
the first ballot and the doctor is con
vinced that ho is only a joke, they will
be free to vote as they choose, for it is
highly improbable that they will allow
themselves to be sold out to Brown by
Pardee, with Davis in the running. So,
although the doctor may fret and plead
to his heart's content, he will not have
the solid delegation, and he will not ma
the nomination. His friends admit th;tt.
The election of delegates to the Demo
cratic State Convention will be held to
morrow afternoon and evening, and the
pastoral picture is promised for exhibi
tion of fusion Populists participating in
Democratic primaries.
How beautiful! How touching! How
sweet !
In the old days of Buckley and Higgins
San Francisco was frequently treated to
the spectacle of the "Rockrollers" dipping
into the "Lambs' " pie, and vice versa;
but who could imagine anything so ex
tremely humorous as a flock of "Pops"
swooping clown on a Democratic feast?
Yet this is what is promised, and it is
likely the same thing would have oc
curred in San Francisco had not
"the McNrli" swallowed the whole
apple himself. The boast was made
in the fusion convention at Sacramento
that they wouid have a perfect right
to do so, and it seems as though their
claim is valid. About all that is neces
sary to entitle one to sign the Democratic
roll lure is to pledge that tho signer voted
for Bryan two years ago â if he had a vote
thenâ and ->vill vote the Democratic ticket
this fall. As the Populistsâ or the fusion
branchâ are qualified to t;ike that pledge,
there Is no good reason why they should
not help out.
There Is no likelihood of there being any
serious contest. Maguire is looked upon
here aa the only possibility under the cir
cumstances, but there is a firm determi
nation to protest against the McNab-
Gould-Alfor.i steal of Ban Francisco, and
the delegation from this county may be
safely counted on to Stand in with the
move to oust the delegation from across
the bay.
PLANNED BY PARDEE.
The Incidents of a Little Inde-
pendent Movement in
Alameda Town.
A few day ago independent Republicans
of the town of Alameda were gently
sounded to ascertain if they were ready to
ko into a little movement outside of the
regular order of politics to have certain
Influential men sent to the State conven
tlon. It was soon whispered around that
this man had been consulted and that
man Ignored, and so a little circle was
kept guessing as to the true inwardness
of the projected plan.
Tuesday afternoon the projectors of the
independent scheme passed the word
around that a meeting would be held in
the basement back room of Harmony Hall
that night. When the time came the
usual formality of electing officers of the
meeting was not neglected, but it was ob
vious that the organization was merely
perfunctory. Some speeches were made
and some statistics were presented show
ing the size and strength of Alameda
County, as compared wun the insignifi
cance of Alameda fn the administration of
State artairs, but the real purpose of the
meeting was not disclosed until a tiny*"
ticket, an inch and a half long and one
inch wide, containing the names of nine
Pardee Independents, was presented.
There was no space on the ticket to insert
names in lieu of those on the printed list
and so the programme was nicely execut
ed. Among the names on the ticket are
those of Ralph Hamlin, Dr. Tisdale. Jo
seph Langtree Brooks Jr.. and Harry
Tank. E. K. Taylor called the ticket "Dr.
Tisdale's medicine," and agreed to take it.
Influential citizens who were not consult
ed about the meeting and who attended
without the formality of an invitation
call It the "typhoid-pneumonia ticket."
Democratic Delegates.
ALAMEDA. Aug. 10.â At a meeting of
the Alameda Democratic Club last even
ing the following named gentlemen were
selected as candidates for delegates to
the State convention: T. C. Stoddard, F.
S. Crandall. John O'Brien. M. F. Tarpey,
F. W. Vugt and J. H. Haltan. It is un
derstood that the entire delegation is for
Maguire, and that there is a pronounced
sentiment on the part of some of them at
least against admitting any San Fran
cisco delegates who are not elected at
primaries.
Davis Meeting Last Evening.
ALAMEDA. Aug. 10.â There was a
good-sized audience last evening at the
meeting called to indorse the candidacy
of W. R. Davis for Governor. A brass
band aided in gathering an audience, and
many ladies were present. Mr. Davis was
the principal speaker of the evening and
took occasion to deny that he had ever
made any statement that he would abide
by the decision of the majority and sup
port whichever candidate developed the
most strength in the county.
Clark Must Hang.
The days of George "W. Clark, the Kapa
murderer, are numbereu, for the Supreme
Court yesterday affirmed the judgment of
the lower court, which was tnat he should
he hanged for his crime. From all ap
pearances the attorneys for the con
demned man abandoned tne ease, for all
they did was to tile the appeal without
making any points. Thus there was
nothing to guide the higher court but the
records, and no errors were found. The
crime for which Clark is to hang is one
of the most revolting in the history of the
State. He deliberately killed his brother
in order that he might have possession of
the brother's wife. The woman and the
scoundrel had been deceiving the victim
for year?.

OUR LOCAL BUNSBY.
IN the language first used to account for the stir at
the Hoffman House on the arrival of Mr. Moses
â¢. tuinst â "Maguire has came." Having "came," he
spoke, of course. 1 1 is speech was barren of reference
;to the Chicago platform, 16 to I, and government by
.injunction. Of course it was sumptuous in its treat
â jiient of the railroad issue, and was incidentally de
voted to attacking Senator Morgan for "yielding to
. corporate influence" in his support of Mr. Hunting-
Eton's funding bill. Loud and Barham were also
.mildly roasted, but the Judge failed to explain why
"he sat stiil and omitted the one objection, which, as
".explained by Senator Perkins, would have beaten the
.'jneasure. Perhaps the Judge wanted it passed in or
der to have a grievance that would be useful to him
and his daily organ, the Examiner.
When he came to speak of the proposed colonial
.policy, however, the Judge rose to the full height of
Bunsby. He said: "What shall be done with these
islands ultimately I am not prepared to say. but this
I do say concerning them, that they should be dis
.posed of according to the best interests of our coun
try, limited only by the consideration of the rights of
the people of the several possessions, rights that our
country recognizes and accords to all, at home or
abroad. In the settlement of the^e questions those
interests alone shall be considered, and respecting the
rights of the people there those questions shall be
settled according to our final judgment of what is the
best interest of our own country, without foreign in
terference."
There you have it. We are first to seek our inter
ests, limited by the rights of the people we conquest.
Then we are to settle the matter by considering these
interests ( the rights of the conquested) alone. Then
we are to settle it all according to our final judgment
of what is the best interest of our country, regardless
of any limitation by the rights of the conquested.
This enables the Judge to hit the settlement or
mrs< it. He carefully omitted what the people expect
of all public men now, an expression of his own
opinion of what the interests of this country are and
what the rights of the conquested. He avoided saying
whether he thinks the people of this conquested ter
ritory shall be made members of our body politic, be
.come our fellow citizens and enjoy our franchise, and
through it representation in our Government; or
whether they shall be excluded from our body politic
. and that we shall pay the cost of governing them;
or whether we shall tax that cost to them and deny
.'â¢to them representation. Upon this burning question
he was silent while pretending to speak.
. After shuffling off this fine coil of meaningless
.words he plunged up to his I's into the railroad issue,
omitting to explain his failure to enter the parliamen
. tary objection that would have killed the funding bill.
â¢ He indicated a wild desire for railroad competition.
He mourned that under the funding bill the people
of California are to be oppressed by Mr. Hunting
don "until they either build a competing railroad or
secure the building of one by somebody else."
In this connection one is driven to recall the re
cent situation in this State. "Some one else" put up
.the capital, not the Maguireans, and built a competing
line which ends "the dominion" of Mr. Huntington
in that productive area where it had been most gall
â¢ ing. No sooner had this competition been secured
. than Judge Maguire's daily organ, the Examiner, be
â¢.gan libeling the projector of this competing road,
whose credit and capital had made its construction
â  possible. The Judge's organ treated this gentleman
on a more libelous level than it had attacked Hun
tington upon, with the result that Maguire's friend,
Hearst, is exiled from California and dare not show
himself in the State for fear of punishment for his
low libels against the projector of competition to
Huntington.
In the closing sentence of his speech the Judge
brilliantly illustrated the illogical and contradictory
character of his mind. He said: "In my opinion
public operation of railroads is not necessary, and
under the Democratic idea it is not proper, unless it
is necessary to destroy the monopoly, but it must be
done if the Government is to preserve its indepen
<!rnce of corporate dominion. It must be done if the
people are to maintain the rights which alone can
seciire to them individual freedom."
We leave the Judge to explain why a thing that is
not necessary must be done.
Some foreign writers seem to believe there is
trouble in store in the Philippines for Americans.
But they will find that the Americans are generous.
That trouble will be distributed so that anybody in
the vicinity may have a share.
Senator Thnrston of Nebraska declares a disbe
lief in the sincerity of the Spanish. Possibly he also
believes that the world is round.
â¢â¢ Among the possible peace preliminaries the neces
sity for licking the Spanish some more may be dis
cerned by the observant.
IS THIS fl "REPUBLICAN YEOR?"
IF one were to judge from the large number of
dead men and respectable colored canines who
have been "prominently mentioned" for the highest
office in the State by the intelligent Republicans in
terviewed during the past few days by The Call's
gubernatorial canvassers he would be forced to the
conclusion that the great and overpowering menace
to Republicanism in California is again prevalent this
year.
What, for instance, can be running through the
mind of a human being who deliberately names a
Southern Pacific attorney to lead the Republican
party in the impending fight? What sort of a notion
car. a person have of political conditions who de
clares that a man who has been twice defeated for
Governor is the "strongest" candidate who can be
nominated? These notions, and others that might be
specified, are indubitably the product of over
confidence. There is an idea abroad that this is a
"Republican year" and that even a dead man may be
placed at the head of the ticket with safety. This idea
always presages Republican disaster. Political cam
paigns won in advance are generally lost.
Yet it would be difficult for any one to ascertain
the foundation for this assumption. Has a canvass
of the people been made for the purpose of ascer
taining what they think on the subject or how they
arc going to vote? Is there any fact in the history
o: past campaigns which indicates that the Republican
voters of the State are disposed this year to turn their
government over to the corporations, the yellow dogs
a; il the political bosses?
San Francisco is generally acknowledged to be the
uncertain quantity ot recent political calculations.
Has anybody taken pains to discover whether or no
its people will stand a railroad hack for Governor or
a colored canine for Mayor?
On December 27 last an election for Freeholders
was held in this city, at which 26,163 votes were cast.
On that occasion all the local parties, Democratic,
Republican and Populist, united and nominated a
fusion ticket. The Merchants' Association opposed
this unanimous political movement simply by placing
in the field fifteen ordinary citizens, and they de
feated the fusionists by majorities ranging from 2500
to 3300. Does this indicate that the people of San
Francisco are in any mood to follow the dictation of
;>auy politicians or accept the leadership of a yellow
dog, or a boss tool, simply because he is at the head
of a Republican ticket? How do the Republicans ex
pect to win this year without votes? Do they imagine
that blather about the war and cheers over the
achievements of McKinley, Dewey and the rest are
going to blind the masses to the fact that their real
interests lie in good government, an economical ad
ministration and consequent low taxation?
But how about State partisanship? Is there any
thing in recent history to justify the idea that a dead
man or a railroad hack can with safety be nominated
f;;r Governor this year?
Lei us scan the figures a moment. Two years ago
McKinley carried California by just exactly 1922
plurality. One Bryan elector was chosen, J. W. Mar
tin, who received a plurality of J4B votes. The total
vote cast was 298,691, of which McKinley received
146 688 and Bryan 144,766. San Francisco, a city
which gave Budd (Democrat) in 1896 12,000 plurality,
reunned a plurality for McKinley of 400. Had it
given its normal Democratic majority of about .3000
the President would have lost California and the Leg
islature would have been Democratic. At the same
(.â¢lection Southern California, which has always sup
ported the Republican ticket with from 6000 to 8000
majority, showed up with a beggarly plurality of 1000
for McKinley, electing t.vo Populist-Democratic
Congressmen over McLachlan and Bowers, the
strongest Republicans in the South. Furthermore,
Maguire carried the Fourth Congressional District
by 8134 plurality and De Vries defeated a "railroad
attorney" in the Second District by 4845.
Do these figures justify the confidence of those who
are now talking about placing at the head of the Re
publican State ticket a man who enjoys the favor of
the Southern Pacific and the political bosses? What
is the use of talking about it? California with a weak
candidate will never be safely Republican again. The
political party which persists in entertaining such an
idea merely falls upon its own sword.
If the convention which meets nt Sac.
ramcnto on the 33d inMt. does not nomi
nate for Governor a man who commands*
the confidence of the people, ho In hit*
person represents honest government,
low taxation, opposition to l>o*Â« control
and railroad and corporation corrup
tion, its ticket will encounter a political
icel>erjf in IVovemher -which will freeze
it still.
CAMPAIGN PROSPECTS.
rROM the non-partisan and possibly impartial
ground of the District of Columbia, where the
people have no vote, the Washington Post has
been studying the prospects of the approaching cam
paign arc", announces the conclusion that the Demo
cratic vote will exceed that of 1896 in a great many
Congressional districts, and that it is by no means
certain the Republicans will control the House in the
next Congress.
The reasons given in support of this somewhat sur
prising conclusion are that the subsidence of the silver
issue has been followed by a return of the gold Dem
ocrats to their former party, and that with little in
the way of a substantial issue on which to base the
campaign the Democrats of the Eastern States that
have thus far made nominations have exercised great
care to select able men as their standard-bearers, with
the object of making up for the lack of an intel
ligible platform by the personal force and popularity
of their candidates.
How far these conclusions are justified by the situa
tion in the East it is impossible for us to determine
from this distance and at this early stage of the cam
paign. It may be that the gold wing of the party
is returning to its former place in the Democratic
ranks and that the free silver plank has been slaught
ered as a fatted calf in honor of the returning prodi
gal, but if so we have noted no signs or reports of
these things in our Eastern exchanges outside of the
Pest. Moreover, we are equally ignorant on this side
of the continent of the personality of the able stan
dard-bearers who have been nominated to atone for
the lack of a platform. So far as we have heard no
Democrat has yet been put forward for Congress
who if elected will be big enough to cast the shadow
of eclipse over the present Democratic leader of the
House â the statesman who is known to fame as
"Boy Bailey, the teeming bazoo of the Waco school
of thought molders."
Nevertheless the estimate of the Post is not to be
set aside as unworthy of consideration. It may be that
the Washington editor is simply patting the Demo
crats on the back so as to encourage them to battle
and thus enable the District of Columbia people to
have a good fight to watch and bet on this fall. The
chances are, however, that the study of the Post is
more serious, and that we are to have in reality a
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, AUGUST 11, 1898.
hard struggle to retain in the next Congress the
splendid Republican majority of the present one.
The Call has repeatedly pointed out that in State
politics this is not to be a yellow dog year, and if the
Post is right the same warning may be given with
respect to the Congressional districts. Whether or no
the Democrats are putting their best men forward, the
Republicans must do so. Of the seven Representa
tives from California in the House but three are Re
publicans. We must at least reverse these figures in
the next Congress, and in order to make sure of
doing so we must beware of being over sanguine.
This may be a woodpecker campaign on the part of
the Democrats, but it must be borne in mind that
when the birds are plentiful and diligent they can get
away with the wood by pecking it just as effectively
as by sawing it.
NEWS FROM THE FRONT.
THE shifting scenes of war pass with the rapid
ity of a magic lantern exhibition. A short time
ago the "front" meant Cuba. Now it means
Manila. This possibility was recognized at the time
the first transports laden with troops started from
this city for the Philippines. The Call sent along
men in whose ability and courage it had the utmost
confidence. It is for this reason this paper is now
able to give each morning the latest information
from the islands where Dewey won fame and Merritt
has set up a government of which he is the head.
Among those whom The Call sent was Sol Sher
idan. He had nevej had an actual war experience,
but he had earned a reputation as a thorough jour
nalist, one who recognized the value of news, had the
faculty for expressing it in explicit terms, and who
would not shrink from any danger in his quest for
facts. He was not instructed to seek a post of dan
ger, but he felt that the place for him was where the
boys were fighting, and he was with them on the line
of fire. With modesty, and yet with succinctness, Air.
Sheridan told yesterday of his trying experiences. The
result was that this paper was enabled to print the
best account of the first battle in which California
troops were engaged. He was among the soldiers.
He heard the bullets sing, and he saw the Americans
fall. He was not forced to tell of what had been re
lated to him by stragglers from the front, for he was
there himself.
To boast is not seemly, and we refrain. The news
columns merit laudation, but they do not need it.
They set forth their own story. Sheridan is simply
a correspondent. He did not go with the title of
"special commissioner" nor was he laden with in
structions to Dewey, nor flags wherewith to make
glad the heart of the admiral. He went simply as a
newspaper man, the representative of a newspaper,
and he acquitted himself with honor. The readers oi
daily papers appreciate enterprise. There is no
occasion for calling their attention to it. yet to pay
a passing tribute to Mr. Sheridan for his energy, his
courage and his success cannot be out of place.
WITH a show (if impartiality and fairness the
Chicago Tinfcs-llerahl concedes it is natural
that the California State Board of Trade
should ask for the appointment of a citizen of the
Pacific Coast to the Peace Commission which .
decide upon the future disposition of the Philippines,
but it follows this concession witli the emphatic state
ment that the request should not be granted.
The argument uf our Chicago contemporary is
terse. It says that while the greater part of American
trade with the islands must be carried on through the
Pacific ports, yet as the men who are selected to ar
range for the settlement of the Philippine question
will be confronted by trained diplomats, it is neces
sary that they should be men of marked ability, and
that consideration, it claims, bars out all Commis
sioners from this portion of the L'nion, for it declares,
"There are no great international lawyers on the
Pacific Coast, but the best are all to be found east of
the Rockies.' 1
The arbitrary exclusion of Pacific Coast men from
the diplomatic service of the nation would be an in
jury, but to exclude them on the ground taken by the
Times-Herald would be the addition of insult to in
jury. That a widespread ignorance of Western con
ditions prevails in the East is made evident by the
frequency with which this assumption of superiority
in ability, intellect and learning is put forward by
the people beyond the Rockies. It is an ignorance
that should be dispelled, and one of the best ways to
dispel it is that of giving Pacific Coast men a chance
to demonstrate in a conspicuous field their fitness for
the- highest work.
No man can achieve repute as an international law
yer unless he is intrusted with the performance of
work which affords an opportunity to display his
ability to deal with international questions. It was
thought in the East that we could not build warships
until a contract was given to our shipyards to con
struct several of them, and then it was shown by the
Olympia, the Charleston, the Monterey and the peer
less Oregon that we can surpass competition in that
work.
In the East itself and in recent years there have
been abundant instances to prove that a high order of
ability may exist in men and be unknown to the na
tion at large for years simply because the possessors
have never had an opportunity for its display on a
great occasion. Neither Cleveland's Secretary of State,
Mr. Olneyof Massachusetts, nor the present Secretary,
Mr. Day of Ohio, had any fame as international law
yers before they were tried. There are men on the
Pacific Coast who are just as competent to serve
the nation with distinction in diplomacy as these men
of the East.
There may be good and sufficient reasons why no
member of the Peace Commission should be selected
from this section of the Union, but if so they will be
widely different from that assigned by the pre
sumptuous folks of Chicago. In this -.var California
beat the East in promptness and efficiency in furnish
ing men in response to the President's call for vol
unteers; warships built in San Francisco have sur
passed those of the fleet built in the Eastern yards,
and if a fair opportunity is given we will show that
we are equally capable of matching Eastern men in
maintaining the honor and the interests of the nation
in the fields of statecraft and diplomacy.
As every man has the right to think his own wife
the best in the world, so each State in the Union may
claim to have first sent its National Guard to respond
to the call for troops. And most of them are doing
it. We violate no confidence in saying that all of
them except California are mistaken, but no matter.
There is no surprise in the fact that the Supreme
Court of the State has declared marriages at sea, con
tracted with an express view to beating the law, il
legal. Nobody ever thought they were anything else.
California knew all the time that when the boys of
the First got on the firing line they would give a
good account of themselves.
Aguinaldo is said to be losing popularity, but he
is not losing any with us.
EASTERN ASSURANCE.
DR. CLINTON REPLIES TO FATHER YORKE.
To the Editor of The Call-Sir: The Rev. Father Yorke in to-day's
Call has made many erroneous and misleading statements which, in jus
tice to myseif, I desire to correct. ,
He states that lam the author of the communication signed b> the
board of managers of the Seamen's Friend Society and that-referring to
meâ "he is the moving cause in this latest attack on me."
I most emphatically deny both statements.
I am not tho author of the communication and I have never either di
rectly or indirectly attacked the reverend gentleman. eÂ«Â« A *Â»Â«
I had fondly hoped that with the granting of the lease of the , bailors
Home to the Seamen's Friend Society by his honor Mayor Phelan and
the Board of Supervisors, after they had thoroughly investigated us man
agement and found it faultless, the regrettable controvery over it would
cease. But it was not to be so. , , . . __
In a recent number of the Monitor the subject was again brought up
and again the management of the Sailors Home was attacked. This last
straw" was probably' the immediate cause which moved the board of that
institution to defend themselves In the manner they did before the board
of Supervisors. , â ,
Father Yorke has repeatedly and without just cause aspersed my good
name. The epithets which ho has so lavishly applied to me I pass without
comment, save to say I yield to no man in my love of fair play and in
my hatred of injustice. ,â , , *v . *
This i can truthfully say, and I believe the people will indorse the state
ment, that I have, according to my light and a conscientious sense of
duty, ever striven, as a public servant to do my whole duty by the whole
people of San Francisco.
Father Yorke is a minister of God and T am loth to believ- that he
has knowlnj '- borne false witness against me, :"- neighbor and friend. In
charity I forgive him the great wrong he has done me and I pray that He
who reads the hearts of all men may forgive him. C. A. CLI>Â«TO.N.
THE EFFECT OF THE WAR ON POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir: A question frequently
asked is the probable effect of the war with Spain upon political organiza
tions. This is a hard question to answer. The war and its probable con
sequences constitute but one factor in the co-ordinated events through
which parties are to be readjusted. That a readjustment if inevitable, I
firmly believe. The Federals and the Republicans of our early history, the
Democrats and the Whigs, and their successors, the Democrats and the
later Republicans, until within a few years ago were divided by distinct
issues upon which great statesmen brought to bear the pressure of their
intelligence and their patriotism. But, in recent years, while the average
standard of our population has been raised, the real intellect of the coun
try has been largely diverted to the army and navy, to the other learned
professions, and to the numerous channels of trade, commerce, finance and
literature, and the management of politics has been correspondingly rele
gated to greed, cunning, vanity and corruption. We still have able men in
public life, or our Government would have failed to rise even to the emer
gencies of this war. It is, however, true that intelligence and integrity have
been submerged, and that, in a comprehensive sense. official action
throughout the United States is on a plane far lower than our institutions
and the ma: - of our citizens.
One of the results is that party names have. lost their significance; that
issues are the catchwords of campaigns; and that glittering spoils mainly
stand for principles. Many Democrats in name are essentially Republicans
in fact. Many Republicans in name are essentially Democrats in fact. The
fundamental thought which tends toward centralization in some men and
toward liberalism in others, is lost sight of in a wild scramble for office,
and to-day the people, the real people, who are not in the service of "prac
tical politics," are groping for genuine issues, which will probably be found.
The war may furnish the occasion for the shaping of these issues. The
space I can occupy Ls too limited for elaborate discussion, but it must be
broadly acknowledged, however "the sober second thought" may modify
its influence, that there is a growing sentiment among millions, affected by
superficial enthusiasm for military glory, by a mania for speculation, or by
local, class or individual interests, and who have not yet stopped to reflect,
in favor of such radical changes in our Government and its policy as would
be tantamount to revolution. On the other hand, there are other millions,
ami many of them, less noisy and demonstrative, who adhere to the Amer
ican conception Of our constitutional system, at least to the extent he
â¢â .led by all parties. In these; facts there ls a basis fur the develop
ment of an issue, definite, exact and deep, upon which the intelligent masses
may be antagonistically arrayed and around which other issues may be
grouped and thus a readjustment of parties effected.
It Is difficult for me to be dispassionate on this subject, which, to my
mind, involves the destiny of the human race. A few words expressive of
my own convictions may not be misplaced. lam a firm believer in the
American system as originally constructed. I believe that as Judaism and
Christianity combined brought irflo the. world that love and fraternity which
are the bond Of peace and of all approaches toward perfection among men,
so Washington and his associates, the statesmen and the soldiers of the
Revo! i the fathers of the republic, formulated and organized the
undying type of government, of which the constitution! as heretofore ex
pounded, la the gospel. And, as any form of religion, no matter how elas
tic Us practical methods, which abandons its creed, must fail, so I believe
that if we abandon our creed and enter into a British policy of conquest,
under the pretext of extending the area of freedom, we will meet with the
Of Rome. Hut I am confident that America will never be converted
Into v lamb and swallowed by the British lion.
Centralization at home and conquest abroad must inevitably result In
imperialism. I care not what the government is named or what its appar
ent form, if it is not limited in its functions and quickly responsive to
the intelligent demands of man exercising and capable of exercising his
own sovereignty it is imptri ' in substance.
If this republic is a failure let the fact be squarely admitted and the
experiment abandoned. If it is not a failure then keep it on the founda
tion of the constitution. I hold that it is the most majestic triumph of
all history. But, for many reasons, the mere enumeration of which would
outrun my space, there has to be and there will be I contest between those
who work, consciously or unconsciously, for revolution and away from the
American ideal and those who feel and know that true progress, the pro
gress of life, energy, brains, education and system, is a growth of which
the motive power is immutable principle.
It is often but falsely suggested that the constitution, instead of sup
plying a force for unlimited expansion, was a sheet too narrow to cover
a great nation, and that Washington, in his farewell message, spoke for
a juvenile community and that his utterances, which have been the texts
of thp deepest thinkers of modern ttmes, were full of wisdom for his gen
eration, but had no application to a continental re^ablic stretching out in
all directions for trade, for commerce and for tinancial relations and, be
fore it is a century and a half old, finding it necefsary, with greater re
sources and with a sparser population to tho square mile than any other
civilized nation, to preserve internal peace by external outlet, for insub
ordinate energy.
I wish here deliberately to repudiate these and all similar propositions.
They are assumptions and delusions and not arguments, and they are
fraught with dangers at which humanity itself might well shudder. The
Declaration of Independence is an epitome of the eternal truths essential
to the welfare of man on thi3 earth. The constitution poured those truths
into channels as deep and as permanent as time, and capable of fertilizing
the human race as the Nile fertilizes thj wastes of Egypt. Washington
lived and wrote for nl! ages. And the dwarfs and pygmies who would re
verse this history, which is the natural womb of future humanity in its
most perfect form, in my opinion, have not reckoned with the American
people, as they will discover through the coming alignment of parties.
Thus, in compress) d sentences, I have endeavored to answer the ques
tion Which Las furnished my theme, and, in doing so, it w..s inevitable
that I should convey my individual ideas. So far as this State is concerned
I hope that our coming Governor may be a man of breadth and character,
better versed in our institutions, our business, our history and our re
sources than in "practical politics," and prepared, not to provoko and main
tain constant turmoil and controversy, but to co-operate with every man
and with evf t organization ready to work for our internal advancement
and for thp steady accumulation of the most fruitful and assimilating
elements of population. PUBLICOLA.

NAVAL SUPEEJOHITY.
It was expected that the war between
the United States and Spain would fu--
nish a practical test of many modern de
velopments in naval construction Â»nd ar
mament and Its beginning was watched
with much Interest on this account by
students and critics of naval wirfar-3. As
time went on it became apparent that
the test would not be satisfactory, and
after two months of remarkaole experi
ence we can aay that this war his dem
onstrated one thing and one thing only,
that the value of the modern armaments,
quite as much as of the old, depends jpon
the use that is made of them.
The Spanish navy was not ill-matched
to ours and we supposed that It was go
ing to give us trouble. But the Spaniards
have made such poor use of their ships
and machinery and have shown such lit
tle idea of gunnery that there has been
no actual test of one type of vessel
against another or of guns, projectiles,
armor, torpedoes or other appliances. It
would be absurd to assume, for example,
because the Gloucester demolished the
Furor, that a pleasure yacht with small
guns is superior to a torpedo-boat de
stroyer. But a pleasure yacht well com
manded and manned by good sailors and
gunners will outclass a much more for
midable craft if those <>n board the latMr
do not know what to do with it.
Neither at Manila nor at Santiago was

superiority of discipline. Dewey and

A PIECE OF ENTEEPRISE.
The Call did a splendid piece of work
this morning in making a canvass of
the newspaper editors of the interior of
the State with regard to the standing
of the different gubernatorial candi
dates. This canvass serves to clear
away a great deal of the mist and un
certainty of the contest and crystallizes
the facts with regard to the different
aspirants. Tho figures are given else
where and readers can draw their own
conclusions. They are worthy of close
and careful study. The Call is entitled
to the credit rt one of the best pieces
of enterprise seen in the local field for
many a day. â Alameda Encinal.

Sailing of the British Bark West
York Delayed Because Her

Captains of coasting steamers and mas
ters of tugs take issue with the Supreme
Court of California on the question of
marriages "on the high seas." They as
sert that the shipping laws of the United
States make It compulsory for the mas
ter of a vessel to "make an entry" in the
ship's log of "all marriages and deaths"
that occur during the voyage. A mas
ter's certificate of death is accepted, and
why, then, should not a marriage certifi
cate be also accepted?
"Again, the ceremony, in nearly every |
case, of marrying a couple Is performed |
three marine leagues from the shore, and,
therefore, outside the jurisdiction of the
United States," argued an old salt, who
has tied many a "true lover's knot"
in his time. "If .a passenger or a sailor j
dies within three marine leagues of port,"
continued he, "the body is brought ashore
and the Quarantine Officer passes upon j
the case. The only way in which I can
see that Upcle Sam has anything to do
with the case is that the marriage takes
place under the Stars and Strides, and !
that, of course, gives the Federal author!- j
ties power to act, but I don't see what ;
the State courts have to do with it, as the j
marriage took place outside the State."
A great many well-known San Fran
cis* o skippers have performed the mar
riage ceremony "on the hiÂ«h seas," and |
the decision of the Supreme Court was
read with great Interest by them. Cap
tain Alexander of the steamer Santa Rosa
is given the rank of "Archbishop" by the
chaplains of the fleet. Nearly all his j
marriages have been performed during
his steamer's run from San Francisco to
San Diego and vice versa. "Archbishop"
Alexai it is that ninety-:
Dine per cent of marriages performed by i
him have turned out happy ones.
N>xt to Captain Alexander comes Cap- ;
tain Jepsen of the Queen, who ranks as
"Bishop oi Southern California"; Captain
Dan Haskell, now a pilot, but late uf the
-.->, who ranks as "Bishop of
Northern California." and Dan James of
the tug Ida W, who ranks as "Arch
:,." Captain Hall, late of the
steamer Corona, but now master of the
. used to do considerable In the
ng line when he was on tho south
hut since he has been piloting
a to Dyea, Skaguay a:;J St. Michael
he has very few lovesick couples on hia
hands.
The foregoing masters take precedence
i wing to the number of marriages per-
I :â :; i d by them and duly recorded in the
ship's log, but the* following "Chaplains of
the ileet" run them close. Captain Clem
Randall, who succeeded Captain Haskell
aa master of the Fearless, and who is now
a pilot in the Alaskan waters, Captain
"Ike" Smith, master of the tug Bea
Queen; Captain "Dan" Thompson of the
rge Harvey of the
Liberty, Captain "Oil Brokau of the Re
Â«taln John SUovivh of the Alert,
Captain Henry Peterson of t lie Amy, and
r Tltchworth Of the Ant:ie. Besides
a number of marriages were per
formed on the gasoline launches Hettie B
lere, but these boats also went
: the three marine league limit be
fore their masters performed the marriage
my.
It. is safe to say that during the last
five years over five hundred of these tug
bout marriages have taken place on the
high seas, and the chaplains of the fleet
think It is very hard linos for the Supreme
t to come in at this iate day and M.y
the whole thing was worse than a farce.

YUKON GOLD
IS MEASURED
Leach of the Mint Says
Five Millions.
THE TALE OF THE NUGGETS
UNCLE SAM GETS ALL THE CAN
ADIAN OUTPUT.
Most of the Klondike Gold Has Been
Weighed and Assayed and the
Results Are Modest
Ones.
The measure of the Klondike gold out
put has been officially taken with what
appears to be a close approximation to the
definite total that will be worked out to
a decisive hgure in the near future.
F. A. L,each, superintendent of the
United States mint in this city, estimates
the output at about $5,000,000 and gives
facts and considerations to back up his es
timate.
This is an enormous shrinkage from
the $15,000,000 and $20,000,000 that have been
promised by all sorts of authorities, and it
Is a big falling off from the newspaper es
timates of recent weeks based on the tales
of returning miners.
Mr. Leach's estimate is the first official
one to be made, bused on the actual meas
urement of gold duet shipped out from
the Yukon region.
Whatever tales and estimates may be
given out by Yukon miners and corre
spondents the fact will remain that the
gold produced in that icy El Dorado will
practically all find its way to the United
States assay offices and mints, where its
amount and origin will be recorded.
Whatever tales and newspaper reports
follow the arrival of each party of re
turning Klondikers, their gold dust will
BOon be weighed and acounted for by
Uncle Sam. Guld dust and nuggets are
raw material which each owner, be It a
prospector, a commercial company or a
punk, promptly turns into drafts or coined
eagles and double eagles.
More than nine- ten tin of the gold from
the north or elsewhere in this country
soon reaches United States mints, which
except for the very small consumption
in the- arts, are the ultimate repositories
of all the raw gold and foreign gold
COme which reach the United States.
The tacts that the Klondike district is
in Canadian territory and that a consid
erable percentage -'i the producers and
shippers of gold dust from there are Ca
nadians ni.iKe no difference. The gold
brought to British < 'olumbia by Canadi
ans and the gold dust bought by banks
in British Columbia practically ail comes
here because this is the. natural market
for it. Tli>- Canadians do better by mar
keting their gold at Seattle or San Fra:i
than they can by paying express
a and exchange to Montreal.
Last year's output of Yukon gold near
ly all reached the San Friuiciaco mint. A
little went to the United Stales assay of
lice at Helena, Montana, suid some went
to the Philadelphia mint. Since then a
United Stales assay office has been opened
at Seattle. Nearly all of the gold which
has arrived this year has tjeen cashed
at Seattle and at San Francisco. Two
thirds of that marketed in San Francisco
has been sold to the Selby Smelting Com
pany and one-third directly to the mint.
That bought by Selby's is at once re
fined and deposited at the mint, so that
the mint receipts include always the Sel
by deposits.
Mr. Leacb stated yesterday that the re
ceipts at the mint here had amounted to
about $1,750,000 s-ince the first arrival of
Yukon gold a few weeks ago. This in
cludes the Selby receipts to date, and is
the amount of Yukon gold which has
come to San F: lie had just re
1 a letter from the superintendent
of the assay office at Seattle reporting
that the receipts there were about the
same amountâ sl,7jo,ouo. This accounts
for tg.600.0Q0.
"I estimate," Bald Mr. Leach, "that be
tween $300,000 and $3Pi,jou worth of dust
and nuggets has probably gone East,
either flapped there to be cashed or taken
there by returning miners, who want to
show it as a curiosity. I believe that
nineteen-twentieths of the gold qulckiy
reaches the assay office at Seattle, Sel
ir the Mint here. A good many
iltors have come to the Mint. Our
t single deposit was about $120,000.
From all the information that 1 can gath
er from all sources I believe that less
than $4,000,000 has so far reached this
country. This does not Include Canadian
royalties or dust kept at Dawson for a
circulating medium. Considerable that
has reached us has come from the chan
nels of trade up mere. I estimate that
there is about $1,000,000 more to come from
this season's output. The receipts of
which 1 speak <I<> not include the quartz
mines on the coast. Last spring I report
ed to the department at Washington that
the Yukon oi tput would probably be be
tween $3,000,00^ and $5,000,000."
It was said by other authorities else
where that the dust brought out by the
North American Trading and Transporta
tion Company was sent East and was not
included in Mr. Leach's figures. This
amount might possibly reach $500,000.
From this showing it would appear that
$6 000,000 would be a safe and conserva
tive estimate of the entire Yukon output,
including the American side as well as
the Klondike. ,__*â.
It is Interesting to note that the total
cold bullion receipts at tho Mint in July
wÂ«re the largest in its history. They
were $Â« 148,Â«48, or at the rate of nearly
$74 000,000 * year. This included foregn
cons from Australia and Japan, and bul
lion from all sources.

DR. PIERCE & SONâ Gentlemen: Last Oc-
tober, while at Fort Bliss, El Paso, Texas, I
sent for one of your famous "Dr. Pierces Elec-
tric Belts," for Rheumatism, etc., and after
using it only two months my complaints en-
tirely disappeared and I have not been troubled
with any pain or discomfort since. I consider
your Belt to be the finest body-battery In ex-
istence, as the electric current Is both powerful
and lasting. I purchased your No. XXX Belt,
and now, after using it several months. It Is
as good as new.
I heartily recommend Dr. Pierces Electric
Belt to all sufferers. Yours gratefully,
JOHN P. ANDERSON,
Co. H. ISth Infantry, U. S. Army.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Aug. 10.-Pretty much all of j
yesterday's loss In values was retrieved In to- j
day's stock market before the definite news 'â 
was received from Washington that a protocol ;
had been agreed upon between Secretary Day \
and M. Cambon for the negotiations of a treaty â 
of peace. But this news awakened the market
into renewed activity after a period of com; j
parattve dullness and some recession in prices, ]
and carried it to the highest point of the day, ;
holding It within a small fraction of that point
until the close. The early strength in the mar
ket was in spite of continued doubt whether
or not the whole peace movement was endan
gered by Spanish quibbling. The weakness in
Spanish 4s in I'aris and London gave some
ground for such apprehension. But a recovery
In the wheat market, renewed takings of
wheat for foreign account, and especially St.
Pauls statement of earnings for the flrbt week
In August were sufficient to turn the tide of
sentiment from yesterday's bearish disposition
and to induce shorts to cover. The St. Paul
statement showed an increase in earnings over
the corresponding period of last year of J24.287,
or the largest early August earnings in the
history of the road, with the exception of those
of 1892, which they nearly approached. The
Btatement Is a significant Indication that there
has been a sufficient recovery in the grain
movement after the decline following the ab
normal movement caused by the Lelter deal to
Bupplement the large current movement of gen
eral merchandise and bring the earnings back
to last year's high level.
Naturally the grangers led In the day's
movement, Burlington showing an extreme rise
of 2 1 ? per cent and St. Paul of 2. A continued
large demand for People's Gas also helped the
morning movement. In the afternoon's spurt
prices were sustained by the very heavy de
mand for Atchison preferred, and there was
(ome realizing in the grangers under cover of
this movement. But the close was strong and
pretty near the top at net Kains generally of
between 1 and 2 points. Lenders of money per
haps were a little more exacting regarding se
curities to-day. Payments into the sub-treas
ury on account of the new bonds are large and
the Government's deposits with national banks
do not fully keep pace. The drift of -currency
to New York is also falling off. New York ex
change at some of the important domestic
centers having fallen t<> discount.
Business In bonds was comparatively light in
the early part of the day, but the demand in
creased and prices Improved in the later deal-
Ings. Total sales. $3,7e5,000.
Government bonds were unchanged in the bid
price.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Aug. 10.â Liverpool opened 2d
higher for September wheat, but had moder
ate its bullishness to Id before trading com
menced en this side. The Liverpool news was
enough, to cause an advance of %c a bushel
h'gher in September. It was not sufficient,
however, to maintain this market's half
hearted sympathy very long. The heavy
traders fixed their attention on the promised
abundance of home crops. They treated the
smallness of current receipts and reports of
unfavorable weather with supreme indifference,
and in some instances expressed their undis
guised contempt for any consideration, outside
of the alleged fact that this season's harvest
in the United States would yield 700,000,000
bushels and that Europe would need less of It
than usual. The Northwestern grain men ap
peared similarly Impressed and were advising
thVlr friends here of the near approach of lib
eral rc-neipts, which had been temporarily ar
rested by ->>>â¢ wet weather of a week ago. The
various influences changed the market's
strength into demonstrative weakness before
ttll . session W a.-< half over. Receipts at pri
mary markets were conspicuously small. Chi
cago received 112 cars and Minneapolis and
I'mluth 86, agalnÃt 231 last year. The aggre
gate at the principal Western markets was
511 000 nui-liels, whereas on the corresponding
day a year ago It was 760,000 bushels. Sep
tember "closed %c lower and December %&\c
Light receipts and a good cash demand
stnrted corn higher. It noon became heavy on
the continued fine grrowlng weather and In
sympathy with the decline in wheat. The un
certainty of the Government report restricted
trade. September lout *4(&ViC.
Outs ruled easy, with the other grains. There
was some inquiry for cash, but bids fell short
of holders' views. September closed with a
loss of He.
The cash demand for provisions was excel
lent and speculative buying by packers was
heavy. The market opened at a moderate ad
vance, which was well maintained and In the
end received respectable addition, the latest
trading being at top prices of the day. Sep

â¢ DECIDUOUS AND CITRUS FRUITS.
The condition of the crops Is thus given by
the weekly bulletin of the Weather Bureau:
"The cooler weather which has prevailed dur
: ing the past week along the coast has been
| very beneficial. Grapes and Prunes are nearly
: all ripening. Fruit crops are generally small,
i with the exception of Grapes. Some varieties
of this latter crop, especially Tokays, were
Injured in the northern portion of the State
by hot weather of the previous week, but as
a whole the crop promises to be a good one.
Raisin drying- will begin in about two weeks.
Conditions are still favorable for good crops
of citrus fruits wherever the water supply will
! hold good."
! The market is choked with Peaches and
! Pears, and the canners, far from being pleased
1 with the glut, find themselves In the unpleas
| ant position of not being able to take advan
i tage of it, as they are loaded with contracted
fruit for which they have already paid, and
which prevents them from taking in the
cheaper fruit now under their noses. They
know that the glut is only a matter of a few
days at most, and fear that when they do get
ready to buy in this market prices will be
higher than they are now. All other sorts are
In liberal supply and slow.
Lemons are higher and scarce. Limes have
also advanced, as there will be no fresh ar
rivals for several weeks. $

A BAD DAY FOR THE
SLEEPY SPIDERS
NESTS IN THE HALL OF JUS
TICE RAIDED.
A Gang of Men Makes an Effort to
Show That Work Will Be Done
on the Building.
Yesterday was a day of hard luck for
the myriads of spiders which have spun
their webs in the quiet nooks and cor
ners of the new Hall uf Justice. Some
thing has evidently struck the contract
ors and struck them hard, tor yesterday
morning a force of men was put to work
on the structure. There were a few car
penters and bricklayers, and a gang o.'
men armed with brooms. The army of
sweepers made a vicious onslaught on
the spiders and routed them with great
slaughter, killing thousands and destroy
ing their camps. A few escaped, and the
probabilities are that by next week they
will again be enjoying undisputed pos
session of the foundations ot the new
municipal building.
After destroying the spiders the men
with the brooms were put to work clear-
Ing away the accumulations of dust and
runbish "which for months has lain on the
walls. Why this is being done
none can tell, but it gives the impression
that the contractors intend makijyj their
semi-annual blurt by laying anouier row
of brick and stone, provided yesterday's
exertions have not b.een so fatiguing as
to necessitate a year's rest.
The dilatory work of the contractors
has been the subject of innumerable jests
until it hat- become a. by-word with the
"dead beat" of the vicinity that "1 will

NATIONAL GUARD
OF CALIFORNIA
HOW PEACE MAY AFFECT RE
ORGANIZATION.
The Official List of Those Who Have
Entered the Auxiliary Naval
Foree â Some Interesting
Figures.
During the past week there has been
but very little doing in National Guard
circles, particularly in this city. At divi
sion headquarters answers are being re
ceived to the series of questions sent out
by Major General Dickinson concerning
the status of what there is left of each
regiment, from which men were drawn
to make up the requisite number of the
j quota of the State on the first and second
| calls for volunteers.
Until all such replies shall have been
filed, it will be impossible to start on the
movement for reorganization. There are
some who are of the opinion that in view
of peace, some of the California com
mandÃ at the local camps, and the one
across the bay, may not be sent away,
but may be mustered out. If that should
happen, it is possible that the men who
are in such commands will return to Na
tional Guard duty and in a measure facili
tate the matter of re-establishing the
State force.
The following is the official list of the
leaves of absence granted to officers and
furloughs given to enlisted men of the
Naval Militia for one year for the pur
pose of enabling them to enter the auxil
iary naval force of the United States
navy :

From the records of the office of the
Adjutant General at Sacramento it ap
pears that of the 4637 men who were mus
tered in on the first and second call for
volunteers from the State of California
there were 4071 natives of the United
States, and of this number IS7O are na
tives of California. The* next State that
contributed the greatest number was
Illinois with 229; then there are the fol
lowing States in excess of 100: New York,
213; lowa, 1*0; Missouri, 17B: Ohio, IK>.
Pennsylvania. 126; Kansas. 106. The
smallest number above rtve was furnished
by Colorado, Maryland and Vermont,
each 13.
The citizens of foreign birth who are
in the ranks show figures as follows:
Germany. 124; England, 94; Canada, 79;
Ireland. 70; Denmark, 34; Scotland and
Sweden, 25 each; Switzerland, 17; other
â :i countries, 91. The total of volun
teers of United States birth, 4071; of for
irth, 566. But this does not include
recruits <>n second call.
The tallest volunteers are James "W .
Gray, sergeant of Company F of the
Eborn in Texas, and H. Goslin. pri
m the same company, native of San
risro each 6 feet 6 inches, while the
- William H. Holden of Com
pany F, Eighth Regiment, born in San
Francisco. 5 feet Vt inch.
By thÂ«Â«e records the question that will
hereafter arise as to who was the oldest
and the voungeet volunteer from Cali
fornia, outside of the recruits on the sec
ond call, will be settled. The oldest is
Captain Lemuel E. Lyon. Company H,
Eighth Regiment, age .->8 years; the
youngest. Second Lieutenants H. L. :

SAYS HE WANTS TO
BE BURIED ALIVE
ALBERT FERDINAN'S QUEER IRE
QUEST OF THE POLICE.
Declares That He Has Lived in the
Grave Six Days Without Any
Apparent Injury.
A -well-dressed young man, giving his
name as Albert Ferdinan, last night vis
ited police headquarters and asked for a
permit to bury himself alive. Sergeant
Moffltt. who was on duty at the time
was so surprised at the request that he
was first tempted to have him arrested
for being insane. As the young man
seemed rational enough Moffltt decided to
listen to his story. Ferdinan. in a rather
soft voice, declared that he was "broke
and wanted a chance to make some
""My" "proposition is to be buried alive,"
he remarked. "I have lived under the

/ PEACE IN THE BELL HOME.
Suit to Declare Its Mistress Incompe
tent Dismissed by Judge Coffey.
Peace reigns once more in the "house
of mystery," the home of the Bells. The
differences that have existed between
young Fred Bell and Mrs. Theresa Bell
for the past few years have occupied no
Inconsiderable portion of Judge Coffey's
time but according to the young man's
attorney the days of contention have
passed, all difficulties h*ving been sat
isfactorily adjusted.
Some time ago Fred brought suit
aeainst the woman he supposed to be
his mother, Mrs. Theresa Bell, for an
accounting of the guardianship of the es
tate. The young man claimed that Mrs.
Bell and "Mammy" Pleasant had con
spired to squander the estate, had starv- j
c-d the children, and had been guilty of |
general misconduct. While being exam
ined as a witness in that case Mrs. Bell,
in her exasperation, declared that Fred
Bell, the complainant, was not her son.
Mrs. Bell's repudiation of her relation
ship to the plaintiff was not made an
issue in the case, but in any event, upon i
final judgment, the court refused to in
terfere in the matter of guardianship, al
though the family allowance was mate
rially decreased.
Later young Bell petitioned the court
to declare Mrs. Bell incompetent and to
appoint another guardian for her chil
dren. Yesterday morning, however, on
motion of the attorneys representing all
the litigants, the case was stricken from
the calendar. The court was informed
that an amicable adjustment of the mis
understanding had been arrived at, and j
that amid peaceful surroundings Fred \
was dwelling in the mansion of the
Bells. U

on August 13, and many oarsmen from
this part of the country will go by the
same steamer. The crews will go to their
destination a few days later by rail.
Apart from the crews mentioned the
oarsmen, Frank Duplissea, Dr. C. C. Den
nis. Alex Pape, Coney Ochs and Frank

English Sympathy.
Union Square Hall was crowded last
night by ladies and gentlemen who at
tended the entertainment given by the
Sons and Daughters of St. George for the
benefit of the Red Cross Society. There
were also present a number of the boys in
blue and the band of the First Tennessee
Regiment of Volunteers. The hall was ar
tistically decorated with American flags
and the flag of St. George. There were
fourteen numbers on the programme,
which include* vocal and instrumental se
lections, recitations and quartets by
members of Company H of the Tennessee
Volunteers. After the programme there
was dancing until midnight. There wits
presented to each person entering a sou

FRANCE MAY HAVE
TROUBLE WITH SIAM
VANCOUVER, B. C. Aug. 10.â Mall ad
vices brought on the Empress of Japan
say: Strained relations are said to exist
between France and Siam, and the out
look is serious. The news, as received
from Singapore via Hongkong, says:
The greatest excitement reigns in Sia
mese official circles in Bangkok on ac
count of the alleged conduct of M. Mont
mittonett. a member of the French Le
gation. Under the French-Siamese con
vention of 1893 all Laotians in Siamese
territory must be allowed and even as
sisted by the Siamese Government to
cross the left bank of the Mekong. In the
YVmana district, owing to high water in
the Mekong, a caravan of Laotians under
French guidance quits Siamese soil each
year.
This year they were superintended by
M. Montmittonett, and he met Mr. Rob
yns, the representative of the Siamese
Government. It is alleged that the
Frenchman treated the Siamese represen*
tatlva in an intolerably overbearing man
ner.
Prince Devawongse has practically com
manded the French Government to dis
miss Montmittonett, and demands that
he be punished. Consequently the rela
tions between the Siamese and the French
Governments are greatly strained. The
Siamese, it is said, threaten to shoot
down any Laotians who cross from Si
amese territory without Siamese pass
ports. Numbers of them have done so.
This seems to be the real cause of the
rupture.
SACRAMENTAN DROWNED.
Louis Morgan Perishes En Route to
the Klondike.
SEATTLE, Aug. 10.â Information re
ceived from Long Lake, B. C, records
the drowning of Louis Morgan of Sacra
mento. Cal. He lost his life in the Shis
ley River eight miles from its confluence
with the Inkling, while on his way to
1 ;ike Teslin, in company with twenty
others. The party built ten boats at
Hudson Bay post, fifty miles from Tele
graph Creek, and loading them with sup
plies attempted to go down the Shisley
and up the Niahlin to Lake Teslin trail.
This proved a perilous undertaking, as
seven boats were swamped and the car
goes lost, besides the drowning of Mr.
Morgan.

Chinese-Made Clothing.
Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald has for
warded to Governor Budd a long report
upon the matter of Chinese being employ
ed in the manufacture of garments for the
soldiers. About the time the labor unions
began their agitation against this injus
tice, Major Long of the Quartermaster's
Department caused to be inserted in the
contracts for clothing a clause prohibit
ing the employment of Chinese In this
work. That this clause was not observed
was well known. However the local Chin
ese Vice-Consul came to the conclusion
that the presence of the clause in the con
tracts was a discrimination against his
people, and in violation of treaties be
tween the two countries, so he wrote to
Secretary Day at Washington. The latter
passed the communication along to Gov
ernor Budd, who asked the Labor Com
missioner to make an investigation.
The Labor Commissioner's report will
take the Governor some time to read, for

REAL ESTATE
IS IMPROVING
A Perceptible Change
for the Eetter.
MANY SALES ARE NEGOTIATED
NUMBER AND AGGREGATE VAL-
TJE OF MORTGAGES.
A Glance at the Records, New Build
ing Contracts, ftecent Sales
and General Realty
Notes.
Real estate during the past week indicated
the commencement of a gradual change for the
â future from long existent poor to better con
ditions. The advance, although marked with
uncertainty and slowness, seems, nevertheless,
to indicate clearly that a change is being
undergone and that there Is r.n undercurrent
.01 prosperity striving to break through the
well-grounded surface of dullness which 1 -.Â».-â¢
characterized the progression in real estate for
the past six months or more.
Sales, although of not unusual value and
'size, are increasing in cumber dally with a
good prospect of continuing in the future.
Many of fair size were negotiated during the
past seven days by the brokers generally, which
stands as conclusive proof that the tide of
prosperity is slowly but steadily making its
way into the "world of realty."
The building contracts for the week are of
uniform value and correspond closely to the
record of the preceding week. But few con
tracts for mote than ordinary value were
awarded, none exceeding the limit of $5000.
The record for mortgages was unusual 1 y
Urge, the value of the total pledge involved
exceeding $400,000. The releases and reconvey
ances were few and of small value compared to
the record of mortgages, there being lew, if
any. recorded for more than $20,000,
The total number of mortgages for the montll
of July, according to Thomas Magee & Sons'
monthly real estate circular, was 230, aggre
gating a total value of $650, and the total
number or releases and reconveyances Is*, with
an actual value of $sÂ»SS,6Sj. 'lhe number of
Bales, according to the same authority, was 175,
With an aggregate value 01' $479,126.
The number of mortgages, according to tho
estimate made by the firm of G. H. Umbsen &
Co. for the same month (July), is 228, with a
total value of $652.a75, the releases and mort
gages being 199 in number and $865,433 in value.
REVIEW OF. THE RECORDS.
During the -week there were fifty-two mort
gages and trust deeds recorded, amounting to
J&.4.212. For the same period fifty-three re
teases and reconveyances passed to record In

WOODBBIDGE CANAL SOLD.
Judge Morrow Has Accepted a Bid
of $2 1,000.
The plant and other property of the
Woodbridge Canal and Irrigation Com
pany was sold by auction yesterday fore
noon by United State Circuit Judge
Morrow to G. Howard Thompson, for
$21,000. Mr. Thompson is understood to
represent the Bank of Calif.irnia.
The property had been in litigation in
the United States courts for many
months, and Ms ter in Chancery Heacock
baO held frequent sessions for the pur
of receiving bids, but the highest of
ler he could get was $5000. Judge Morrow,
over and over again, refused to confirm
the sales, and finally announced that he
would not submit to any more delays, and
that if a reasonable offer was not made
for th'; property, he would strike the case
off the calendar. This df-terminntlon on
the part of tho eor.rt inspired somn life
into the bidding and Receiver Chap.man
offered $22,500 conditionally, but afterward
withdrew the bid. At the same time an
offer wan made of $11,009 by another party.
Judge Morrow refused to confirm the sale
and set yesterday as the time for the final
auction. He himself acted as auctioneer,
and received a genuine bid of $21,000. He
will confirm hi? own salv.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, AUGUST 11, 1898.
BIG LEAGUE
CANNOT BOAST
It Has Many Things, But
Not Quite All.
THAT NEW EMERGENCY BOARD
ITS ORIGIN AND MYSTERIOUS
METHODS REVEAXED.
The Cause of That Rush of Talent to
the Press Box Stairs Two
Weeks Ag-o Ex
plained.
BY JOE CORBETT.
The National League has been and la
to-day a great organization. That is, It
is a great organization from a mana
! ger's standpoint, for the reason that the
I manager, or owner, more properly speak
j ing, partakes of all the emoluments which
accrue, while the player, the man who
draws the crowds, takes, with a few ex
ceptions, what he gets, and very often
considers himself a most fortunate
i young (or old) fellow, as the case hap
pens to be.
This organization, however, is great in
other ways. It has Its double umpire
system, its Brush rules, which, in my
opinion, are an unpardonable insuit to the
player, and it also baa its famous Nick
Young, a fine gentleman. But the Na
tional League is not too old to learn.
Out here we have a league which is
seldom heard of where stur players per
form and do other things. Nevertheless,
this same little league can boast of some
thing the National organization never
dreamed of.
It has, besides its "want it all" indi
viduals, who, by the way, are ever con
spicuous in the vicinity of Recreation
Park, or in Mr. Raver's office, its presi
dent, and, "like what you get, players,"
a board, which might be termed "strat
egy," yet, I think, a more fitting name
would be "emergency." *
This statement, I dare say, will be re
ceived with no little surprise, yet it is
a fact, and, owing to the novelty of it,
is the reuson I make mention of It.
1 call it an emergency board, because
it is not on the programme or schedule;
because it always meets in a hurry, and
has no quarters other than Recreation
Park. I have suspected its existence for
some time past, but could ne?er under
stand the cau^e of its origin until two
weeks ago. I happened, or rather, was
permitted to be a participant during one
of the conferences. It was during this in
terval that I was afforded an opportu
nity of familiarizing myself with its ob
jects and methods, which, to say the least,
are peculiar.
Tci describe It as it appeared to me I
must carry my readers backâ and I trust
this incident will cause no mental fatigue
or convenience â to the last game played
between the Gilt Edges ana Athletics,
which the latter club won through its
ability to be reticent under the most
"kicking" circumstances.
The game, as you will remember, was
replete with prolonged disputes, and it ia
to brine to a speedy and satisfactory
ending these disputes tnat first brought i
the "Emergency Board" into prominence.
At one stage of that game Catcher Stan
ley said something to Umpire Smith over
a decision which later on nearly caused
a general mix-up, and for his pains was i
put out of the game. This so enraged '
the Gilt Edge aggregation that tney
threatened to quit the field.
It was during this deliberation between
quitting or continuing that I espied Pres
ident Bert leaving the grand stand with ;
expedition. As my eyes followed him to !
the opening in the grand stand I discov- |
ered that there was a general rush for j
the same spot in that vicinity, and for
fear that something In tho nature of news
might escape me I was compelled to join
the "important ones" in their mad rush.
and brought up at the stairs leading to
the press box. This was the first real
glimpse I had of the emergency board,
and words would fall me were I to at
tempt to describe that collection of talent
that was hashed together in the little
opening which meets with your appro
bation after you Qnce open the door lead
ing up stairs.
Those, however, who seemed to be the
prominent ones, I will mention, and these
will at the same time give an Idea of
whom and of what the board is composed.
There was no spokesman. Everybody
was as good as the other in the mixup,
and I mention tl:is to save confusion.
The emergency boardâ President Bert,
Mr. Raver, the combined forces situated
in the press stand, including the official
scorer, Colonel T. P. Robinson, the um
pire, and those players who have or pos
sibly ever had a grievance â these gen
tlemen all made a rush for the same |
place when the kicking was at fever heat. ;
They met thus and discussed the i
situation and the best way out of it. Ur- â¢
pire Smith, who was extremely hot. lost ,
his head during the exchange of com
pliments and called the game in favor
of the Athletics. Now here is where !
the emergency board demonstrated its j
worth. They agreed without asking
opinions of each other that Smith's pre
cipitancy would causa dissatisfaction
among the holders of tickets and dead
heads; so he was ordered to change his
decision, which he did. Such was the
power of the board, and it racily sur
passes anything In the national league.
They then set to the work of bringing
both factions together, so the game
might proceed. Tueir efforts nvt with the
same success, and without thr- populace
knowing what transpired, tranquillity
was allowed to prevail. Now. of ;i'.l the
plans set forth whereby a game may \Â»
saved from a disastrous ending, this one
takes the ice-cream soda! It is truly \
jnoral, and what surprises me is the fact
that it is not made a part of the entire
league, as only teams and patrons of the
game in this city are given an opportunity
of enjoying the benefits which ensue from
its power to alter things.
THE IRISH FAIR.
Business Transacted by the Advisory
Board.
The advisory board of the Irish Fair
met last night at the Occidental hotel and
transacted considerable business. "Vice-
President T. J. Walsh presided, in the

All the booths are nearly finished and
the Pavilion will be handed over to the of

TROOPS ARE
TO BE SENT
UP THE YUKON
The Government Fears That the
Threatened Starvation May
Cause Bloodshed.
Desperate Efforts Will Be Made to Forward
Supplies and Maintain Good Order.
General Merriam's Plans.
Serious trouble in Interior Alaska is ap
prehended by the United States Govern
ment.
Food riots are feared at Fort Yukon and
ether upriver points, growing out of the
failure of the transportation companies
to g-ef supplies in there on tho pre\ ailing
low water.
Acting on Instructions received frum
Ington yesterday, Major General
Merriaxn will quickly dispatch a battery
of artillery to St. Michael, the officer in
charge having orders to proceed at once
up the Yukon River to Fort Yukon and
open a military post for the coming win
ter. The expedition will also carry a
large Quantity of extra provisions and
supplies to relieve distress. When St.
Michael is reached tho commanding of
ficer will promptly levy on any river
beats he may find, seizing them if neces
sary, and will transport his troopfl nd
supplies to their destination with all pos-
Blble dispatch. A form of military gov
ernment will be established and pood or
der maintained in Alaska, even if it re
quires the services of the soldiers and
artillery.
This news will come in the nature of a
surprise to most people bere. as the ab
sorbing Interest taken in the war has t< m
porarily diverted public attention from
the Alaskan goldiields and the many
thousands of people who entered the re
gion last year and this spring.
But these personsâ some 30.000 or more â
have been struggling with grim fate for
many a weary week, pushing <>n into tne
mountain traps of the interior and plac
ing themselves beyond the reach of ocean
vessels, the only sure carriers of supplies.
.Early in the spring a remarkable thaw
throughout Alaska and the British North
west melted the snow on the mountains
and in the valleys, and a phenomena!
fl" id took place, the Yukon and f>ther
streams rising to a height unequaled in
many years. The country was thus
drained* of its annual water supply, the
summer being almost dry so far a^ rain
Is concerned. The Yukon soon fell to a
very Low stage, and the river boats, with
a few light-draught exceptions, found it
impossible to get far up the stream. Two
or three of the lightest managed to reach
Dawson. and landed small cargoes
provisions and whisky, but the amount
was utterly Insufficient. Even the larg
est <>f the Yukon craft can carry not to
exceed 400 ions of freight at a trip, and
this means supplies for a year for about
400 men, a miner"s outfit for one season
weighing a ton. As fully 30,003 people
had reached Dawson and nearby pi.ints,
was scarce^ a taste of new provi
sions for the crowd. It would hnvc t;iKen
at least seventy-five large steamboats car
rying cargoes of 400 tons each to fully
supply the multitude. Many, it is true,
. brought in supplies with them, but in
.very limited quantities, and such supplies
have been mostly consumed.
. Now the summer there is almost over
and the startling fact has become clearly

: apparent that the up-river camps cannot,
in all probability, be supplied with provi
sions sufficient to feed half of the crowd,
even If high water comes for a few weeks
and allows all of the boats now on the
lower Yukon to ascend the stream. It
must be remembered that but few of the
many rivt-r craft constructed at San
Francisco and other Pacific Coast points
reached the Yukon this summer, many be
ing totally wrecked on the way. Others
were badly disabled. Out of the few that
did get there, a number were Incomplete,
their owners Intending to rlnish them on
the beach. Perhaps half a dozen out of
all the large new fleet have made trips
up the Yukon and other streams, so that
the bulk of the work of transporting pro
visions to Dawson and Fort Yukon, has
been left, aftÂ«r all, to tbe'fow steamboats
of the Alaska Commercial Company and
the North American Transportation and
Trading Company. That these two have
done their best goes without the saying,
but the fates seem to have been against
them this summer.
The first note ot warning was sent down
the Yukon by Captain Healy, the gen
eral manager of the N. A. T. & T. Co., at
Dawson. He ordered the company's trad
ers at lower river points to raise prices of
soods. At least this is the report which
now comes out of the country. Quickly
the fact became evident to the thousands
along the Yukon that the traders hau lost
confidence in their ability to supply the
up-river stations and were beginning to
hedge. The stern realities of the situation
were appreciated in Dawson by the end of
July when but few boats had arrived.
Hundreds began to leave and drift down
the Yukon toward Fort Yukon and Mln
ook. Many thousands, however, refused
to leave Dawson and the Klondike region,
being determined to take chances with
starvation rather than give fip the quest
for gold, after having gone so far and en
dured so much, to say nothing of the ex
pense incurred.
It is these people, perhaps twenty thou
sand in number, who will give the gov
ernments of both the United States and
Canada pienty of trouble before next
spring, unless all of the signs are wrong.
A large proportion of them will no doubt,
drift down to Fort Yukon late in the fall,
when there id no chance to reach St.
Michael, and there become a charge on
the military post. It was at Fort Yukon
last winter that so much trouble occurred
and where bloody riots would have un
doubtedly transpired had it not been for
the courage and firmness of Captain P. 11.
Ray of toe United States army and his
efficient assistant, Lieutenant Richardson.
These two men stood off an armed mob
of several hundred desperate men from
Dawson, who were intent upon looting the
two caches of the tra'dlng companies and
taking for themselves the provisions that
were needed to sustain life in about eight
hundred souls through the Arctic winter.
These officers then seized the caches an<l
rationed the supplies out fairly among
all who needed them, at the same time
exacting payment from those who had
money and work from those who were
indigent, so that the trading companies
would lose no money by the operation.
At present there are "no troops .it Fort
Yukon, not even one army officer, all hav
ing been withdrawn on account of the
war. There is, however, a quantity of
supplies at the post, unprotected from
marauders, if all reports are true. The
Government will, no doubt, be obliged to
seize these supplies, and add as much
more as possible, bringing the same from
the Lower Yukon. Even then there is a
strong probability of a shortage and of
consequent suffering, if not actual starva
tion.
The Secretary of "War, despite his many
duties in connection with the war, has
not lost sight of Alaska, having been
kept posted by Major General Merriam,
who has been In touch with news sources
in Alaska.
It will be remembered that the general
bad charge of the work of Alaskan re
lief last winter, by direction of the Sec
retary of War, and was authorized in
addition to send exploring parties of sol
diers through unknown portions of Uxj
territory to bring back information con
cerning the country. These parties are
now at work in various parts of Alaska,
and are making theix reports as oppor
tunity offers. Recently General Merriam
heard from Captain Abercrombie, in
charge of one of the parties on Copper
River, the captain reporting that there
wore hundred? of destitute men along
the Copper River, and that something
would have to be done for their relief,
or they might starve. This report was,
in turn, forwarded to Washington for the
consideration of Secretary Alger. It
should be stated that the Secretary still
has at his disposal over $100,000 of the
$200,000 appropriated by Congress last year
to relieve the tusiress in Dawson. This
money is now available for use without
further Warrant of Congress. It will be
spent, in so far as necessary, for the re
lief and military exepdltlon to Fort Yu
kon.
General Merriam will quickly determine
which battery will be sent to Alaska,
having now some choice in the mattor,
owing to the apparent ending of the war.
It is probable that the troops will be dis
patched within a week.
Speaking on this subject yesterday, the
general remarked:
"It Is now late in the season and we
will be obliged to move with all possible
dispatch in order to get the l>att>_-ry up
to Fort Yukon before the river freezes
over. It will be a tight squeeze, at best.
There will be no parleying done at St.
Michael with steamboat owners. If neces
sary the United States army officer in
charge will undoubtedly seize all of the
available transportation facilities. He
will take an large a quantity of supplies
up the stream as possible. It is the In
tention to make Fort Yukon tho base of
operations. The War Department does
not Intend to be caught unprepared up in
Alaska, as you can juo.Â£re from these
preparations. It Is very much feared
that serious disturbances may occur in
the Yukon Valley next winter. The trans
portation companies have utterly failed
to get in the necessary quantity of sup
plies for the multitude of people there.
Something has to be done and done at
once."
"â Flow about the relief of the minors re
ported to be suffering on Copper River?"
was asked.
"Thopc men can easily be reached," re
sponded the general. "They arc virtually
on the sencoast. None of them are more
than a hundred miles or so from salt
water. If the department sees tit to send
relief to them it can be easily done In a
week or two of tlm^. I do nÂ«t know how
their oupf-s will be regarded. It is a
question whether the Government Is un
der obligations to send ships to a far
away region to bring back Beveral thou-
Fand people who went there with their
eyes open and who knew of the risks they
Incurred. It may be that the duty of the
Government is limited to supplying those
people with the necessary food to keep
them from starving where they are. Trr>
question of steamboat transoortation Is
altogether different. Still they may be
brought away. T cannot say. Already
th.- officer in charge of the tror,,>s at Port
St. Michael hfis given needy miners
th*re transportation orders on the Gov
ernment which have been honored by the
steamship companies and the men
brought bar^k. 'i ne officer di-I this on his
own responsibility, and the paners in the
case have been forwarded to Washington
for the approval or disapproval of the de
partment. Perhaps the same thing will
he done at Copper River, If the officer
there thinks that the exigencies of the
situation po require. He will have to
take the chances of satisfactorily explain
ing afterward and tho possibility of hav
ing his transportation orders deducted
from his pny, !f th r - Government does not
approve of his procedure. Army officers
sometimes have to act on their own judg
ment In difficult situations and take
chances. I have had to do it: so have all
of them."

A HERO ON THE BATTLEFIELD.
James Frank Finley Distinguishes Himself
on the Bullet=Swept Plain of Malate.
Hobson's gallant deed at the entrance of Santiago Harbor has been
equaled on land by a California private, if credence can be placed in the
dispatches published in the papers y_( sterday.
James Frank Flnlay's gallantry at the battle of Malate, in which the
brave volunteers, who recently left this city were engaged, entitles him
to recognition at the hands of Congress. His rescue of Captain Richter and
a fellow soldier from the bullet-swept field and his ten Trips over the same
ground with cart-loads of ammunition for his comrad< a In the Pennsyl
vania regiment, stamped his a< lit to rank with that of the naval
hero whose name is now a household word.
Young Fin lay is but 24, and his action has seldom been equaled in bat
tle. First his native driver was placed horn de combat with a bullet in the
leg, and then his pony dropped to the ground with a weU-pUu â¢-.' bullet.
Undeterred by the missiles flying around him. the young hero disengaged
the shafts of the cart from the fallen animal and proceeded on bis way to
the front with the ammunition that gave his side the victory. On his return
for more he found Captain Richter lying next to a soldier, both badly
wounded. Again he panned in tho bullet-swept field and placed his supe
rior officer and fellow private in the cart and, grasping the shafts, hauled
them to a place of safety.
The news of his gallant act has been telegraphed about the world, but
in no place has it caused more joy than in his adopted State. At hia
neat little home at 1505 Devisadero street, his mother and sisters are prop
erly proud of the boy. Friends of the young man are calling in numbers
to congratulate the fond mother on her son's courage and miraculous es
cape.
"We knew he would distinguish himself," said one of his bright sisters
yesterday. "Frank!.? has always been brave and good. He always wanted
to be a soldier so that he could make a name, and now that ho has done
so, and without Injury, we are extremely happy."
Private Finlay was born in Yuma. Arizona. He came to California
while very young and attended the Valencia Grammar School until his folks
removed to Guatemala. While in that country the future hero displayed his
love for a military life by joining a regiment composed of lads of his own
age, who were anxious to take part in the revolution that was then waging
between Guatemala and Nicaragua. His knowledge of the processes of wax
and natural leadership gained him the title of governor, which hr- well de
served, and he might have been advanced to general but for the fact that
he was an American.
are likely to arise in Alaska, growing out
of the shortage of provisions, is the vex
ing problem of what shall finally be done
with all of the surplus people In Alaska.
Arc they to be forcibly shipped tv their
homes, or are those who choose to be
allowed to remain until the transporta
tion facilities of the region become suf
ficient to supply all the food necessary
for those who would mine In the coun
try? There are. no doubt/ many thou
sands who would like to remain and
search for the golden treasures that cer
tainly He burled in many directions, but
If they do so, under existing conditions,
they will virtually be dependent upon
the Government to a great extent, and
will expect relief wh<>n in distress. This
is the view of the matter taken by many
army officers, but it is a mooted ques
tion as to what can be done under the
lav. No existing statute, so far as
known, permits of the expulsion from
any portion of the United States of the
people resident therein, and it is quite
doubtful if such a thing could bo done,
even as a military necessity.
The personnel of the Alaska expedition
will be announced by Genera! Merriam as
soon as he can arrange the matter sat
isfactorily.
Whether other bodies of troops will
follow the battery Is not yet known, all
depending upon the action of the Secre
tary of War.

LAID AT REST WITH
LITTLE CEREMONY
FUNERAL OF ADOLPH SUTRO
YESTERDAY.
Services Were Held at His Old Home
on the Ocean Shore and Were
Devoid of Display.
The funeral services over the body of
Adolph Sutro were of the most unosten
tatious character. His remains, inclosed
plain casket, had been conveyed to
his old home, Sutro Heights, overlooking
the ocean, whose troubled waters seemed
to chant a foneraJ requiem as thes un
ceasingly dashed against the rocks in
unison with the sighing of the trees that
were stirred by the gentie breeze.
From 8 to 10 o'clock yesterday morning
the remains lay In state in Mr Sutro's
favorite room to the left of the hallway,
and his features were viewed by all who
desired. A pall of violets rested upon the
ctipk't and everywhere about the mom
were numerous beautiful floral tributes
from relatives and friends.
At 10 o'clock the doors of the house
were eloped to the public, the funeral
services then being held In private, only

ALL FOR THE LOVE OF A WOMAN.
Andrew Wilberg, a Seaman, in a Fit of Jealousy
Fires a Shot at His Landlady.
Andrew Wilberg. a seaman on the steamer Point Arena, languishes fn
the City Prison all through his love for buxom Amelia Reichmann, the
keeper of a lodging-house at 290 O'Farrell street, where he roomed.
They have known each other for six months and during that time V.ll
herg has been pressing his suit with ardor. He bought diamonds for
her, at least he says so, and did everything in his power to win her love.
Yesterday morning he. proposed marriage and was rejected.
"I cannot I've without you," he said, "and I will kill you and then
kill myself." He puled a revolver out of his pocket a.nd fired at Miss
Rc'chmann, who was standing in the doorway of her room. The bullet
missed her and struck the partition about a foot from the door. Sho
paw him place the muzzle of the revolver to his heart, and in terror she
ran shrieking into the street.
A telephone message was forwarded to the Central Police station and
Policeman McAuliffe was sent in the patrol wagon to the house. He
found Wllberg in bed and placed him under arrest. He had evidently
changed his mind and did not fire a shot at his heart. McAuliffe
searched for the revolver, but ould not find it, and he came to the con
clusion that Wilberg had thrown it out of the window, but a later
search was made and it was discovered under the mattress of Wilberg's
bed. .
Miss Reichmann accompanied Wllberg in the patrol wagon to the
prison, and after he was booked on a charge of assault to murder, she
went to Judge Joachlnsen's court and nwore to a complaint against
him. She admitted having a liking for Wilberg, but she was watching
him before consenting to marry him, as he was inclined to drink too much
liquor. He had been drinking the night before, and was not sober when
he asked her to marry him.
Alter she had left the prison Wilborg was heartbroken. "That's
pretty good," he said. "She gets all my money for diamonds and then
throws me in Jail. I wanted her to marry me, and she made me think
she would. Well, well, this is pretty good."
Miss Reichmann called to see him in the prison yesterday afternoon
and they had a long talk. It is probable that she will not testify against
him. She denied receiving any diamonds from him, and remarked that
she had all her diamonds before she knew him.
ASHTON POTTER
WENT TO HAWAII
UNDER ARREST
Humiliation of a Scion
of a Noble House.
MISS VAN NESS FORGOTTEN
WAS FOUR HOURS LATE IN
BOARDING THE MARIPOSA.
Wheeled on the Pier in a Carriage
After Midnight With Clem
Tobin and a Woman
in Black.
After disobeying every order issued by
his superior officers Corporal A9hton Pot
ter of the First New York Volunteers
left here at an early hour this mor,ning
on the Oceanic steamship Mariposa for
the Hawaiian Islands under arrest.
Instead of enjoying the stateroom, to
which his rank as a non-commissioned of
ficer entitles him, he will journey to the
land of eternal summer on a straw mat
tresa in the hold of the ship.
Ever since enlisting as a private in the
First New York Volunteers Corporal Pot
ter has been a thorn in the sides, so to
speak, of the officers of the regiment. He
has made a spectacular display of his
wealth and position, and among the pri
vates has boasted that not a man wearing
the shoulder-straps would dare incur his
enmity. The officers of the regiment took
another view of the matter, and while
there was never any actual understanding
among them as to the disposition of Pot
ter in case of a breach of discipline. It
was the general feeling that he should
be severely punished upon his first open
disregard of regimental orders.
On Tuesday evening Lieutenant Colo
nel Stacpole determined to send Potter
With E Company, and a detachment of
fifty men from D Company under com
mand of Captain Pickard to Honolulu.
"When Potter heard the orders he was
greatly displease^. At first it was the
inpression that he was loth to leave the
fair Miss Van Ness, who had won his
heart and in the fullness of her love had
attempted to end her life a few nights
ago because she thought him faithless.
Thinking that Potter would not put in a
timely appearance, Lieutenant Colonel
Stacpole gave special orders to Captain
Pickard and Lieutenant James Smith,
who Is in charge of Company D, to see
that all men were aboard the transport
Mariposa by 10 o'clock last night.
Early in the evening Potter was seen
entering the Palace grill room with Clem
Tobin. At that time Potter was notice
ably under the influence of liquor. He
was seen by one of the officers, who re
marked that the chances of the corporal's
appearance on board the steamship were
slim.
At 10 o'clock there was a roll-call of the
troops on board the vessel. Every man of
the detail resoonded save Potter. Lieu
tenant Smith called his first sergeant and
demanded to know if the corporal was
aboard the steamer. He was informed
that the gay corporal had not put in an
appearance. At midnight a second roll
call wan held. Again there was no sign
of Corporal PottÂ»r.
Lieutenant Smith called % on Lieutenant
Strevell, the adjutant of "the regiment,
and 'aid the matter before him, asking
his advice as to the course to pursue in
the matter. Lieutenant Strevell suggest
ed that the proper punishment for the
corporal would be a few night's in the
guardhouse during the trip to Honolulu.
At half-past 10 another effort was made
to determine whether the corporal had
boarded the vessel. Sergeant Walsh of
D Company, who went In search of the
nephew of the famous New York Bishop,
reported that the young man was no
where to be found. All had given up
hopes of his putting In an appearance
by 1 o'clock, when the last few visitors
on the vessel bade good-by to their
friends and left the wharf.
A few minutes afterward, however,
there was a loud rumbling of wheels, fol
lowed by a peal of boisterous laughter.
The gates leading to Pier 7 opened and
closed with a bang and a carriage
wheeled alongside the gangplank leading
on board the vessel. When the door of
the hack was opened Corporal Potter, fol
lowed by Clem Tobin and a Misy Evajis,
stepped out of the carriage. The trio
were laughing and talking in a jocular
manner. Mr. Tobin walked aboard the
vessel, leaving Corporal Potter and the
mysterious Miss Evans In a heated con
troversy on the pier.
Lieutenants Smith and Strevell were
standing aboard the vessel at the head of
the gang-plank. They watched the dra
matic parting of Corporal Potter and his
lady friend with manifest disgust. Turn
ing to an orderly, Lieutenant Smith si.id,
"Sir, a man in uniform has just reached
li. re In a carriage with a woman. Pleaso
ordT him on board at once.''
The orderly walked down the gang
plank, and a moment later marched up
the gang-plank in the wake of Corporal
Potter. The woman followed weeping.
She. demanded a farewell interview with
her sweetheart. The request was denied
by Lieutenant Smith, who called Potter

to account and demanded the reason of
his absence.
Potter said he was in ignorance of the
actual orders relative to the hour of re
porting. Lieutenant Smith asked him to
read the orders which had been given him.
Potter refused to do so and was immedi
ately placed under arrest.
When Potter was tak^n below young
Tobin approached Lieutenant Strevell and
requested permission to talk with him.
The request was refused. The woman
then begged the officer's premission to
say a farewell word. Her plea was in
vain. Potter was taken below and shown
an old straw mattress in the hold of the
vessel near the boilers. Lieutenant Smith
orders that this was to be his couch
until Honolulu was reached.
After being placed under arrest Potter
was sullen and disagreeable. He tried to
make trouble for every one near him.
He was sent to Honolulu in hopes that
the First New York would avoid the un
enviable notoriety that his escapades
have brought, upon the regiment. It is

THE COMMISSIONERS
START FOR HAWAII
MAY NOT ENFRANCHISE THE
NATIVES.
President Dole Will Be Continued
IndeflniteJy in Charge of Af
fairs as Governor.
"How will the Hawaiians line up in
politics? Well, I'm sure I don't know!
That's a new question," laughed Senator
Cullom, when approached on the subject
of Hawaii yesterday. '"We do not know
that the Hawaiians will vote in g-eneral
elections for a while. People are already
asking whether the islands will constitute
a State or a Territory. As a member ot
the Hawaiian Commission I cannot say
what will be done yetâ wnether the rela
tion will be similar to that of an English
colony to the mother country or a closer
one. However, there will probably be lo
cal elections and I suppose the boys will
at once begin to take sides in politics, but
whether the Republicans or the Demo
crats or the Populists wili have an toning
first is more than 1 can guess.
"One thing can be stated positively,
and that is the commission was given to
understand that Mr. Dole would be con
tinued indefinitely in charge of affairs as
Governor. The President recently wrote
him a letter, which 1 think Admiral Mil
ler carried, empowering him to hold office
until some future time, when Congress
may enact new legislation regarding the
government of the islands. Dole is vir
tually Governor."
This statement accords with that of
Senator Morgan, as exclusively piiblisneu
in The Call on Tuesday, and effectually
disposes of the story that Mr. Bewail or
any other person will soon take charge as
Governor. The Senators on the commis
sion and Representative Hitt all speak in
terms of admiration for the work already
accomplished by Mr. Dole, and make no
secret of their preference for him as me
executive head of the new colony or tern-
