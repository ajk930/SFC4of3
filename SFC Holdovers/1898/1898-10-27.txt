EXTRAORDINARY
PRECAUTIONS
Paris Authorities Will Strive to
Prevent Disturbaoces in
the Streets To-Day.
Exciting Scenes Expected When the Court of
Cassation Hears tr;e Dreyfus
Revision Appeal.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
LONDON, Oct. 26.â 1t is rumored that
President Faure of France has been
assassinated, but the news is not con
firmed.
PARIS, Oct. 26.â President Faure is
i iking the crisis quietly, and the belief
is stronger than it was yesterday that
M. Brisson fell because he wished to
It Is now rumored that General
due resigned the War Office port
folio out of pique at the refusal of the
staff committee to give him
>â¢â¢ mmand of an army corps.
Extraordinary police precautions
have been ordered against possible
disturbances at the Court of Cassation
to-morrow, where the Dreyfus revision
appeal will be b *
Although there is evidence of sud
sed excitement on all sides here.
there has been no disturbance. The po
nnd municipal guards are out in
g force and they will not permit
the crowds to assume dangerous
gth. But the situation was earn
eager groups in
the streets. President Faure this morn-
Ing received In audience Senator Lou
of the Senate, and ML
Deschanel, President of the Chamber
of Deputies.
It is the intention of M. Fauro to
form a new Cabinet as rapidly as dos
and the names of MM. Rlbot and
Freycfnet ar^ the most prominently
â¢ oned. During the afternoon M.
j-'aure consulted with M. Leveues,
-T 'resident of the Chamber of DÂ«p
who advised that the formation
.â¢ Cabinet include among its mem
and M- Dupuy as the
â pal Ministers.
In the lobbies of the Chamber of Dep
uties to-day all shades of opinion ex
pressed the conviction that M. d#l
( asse should remain at the head of the
Foreign Office, so as to insure the con
tinuity of the Fashoda negotiations.
The rn.-rning papers here treat the
fall of the French Cabinet and the
scene in the Chamber of Deputies al
most xclusion of general news.
All of thr'm, however, dwell briefly nn
the Spanish crisis or the split in the
Liberal party of Spain, without, how
ever, direct reference to the Paris
â¢ Commission, except In the case
â  newspaper, "La Volante," which,
in a Madrid article dealing with the in
' situation in Spain, sums up as
follows: "Whatever may be said one
or the other regarding the situa
one thing is apparent â that the
moment is badly chosen for a minis
terial crisis. When dreadful calami
ties threaten Spain from the outside
at the moment when her destinies
being decided by the Paris con
â¢ cc, and at the moment when her
was crushed at Porto Rico, the
Liberal party is in a state of chaos
and disagreement in the face of
American pretensions which are daily
â ning more arrogant, Spain finds
elf with a Ministry without au
. I y. Never has she needed more im
peratively a strong Government, one
more watchful and awake to outside
questions. Instead of this, miserable
internal quarrels are distracting the at
tention of those who ought to have
;her occupation than the salvation
;:oir country."
The Matin, closing a brief resume
of the Spanish situation, says: "The
council deliberated on the customs
tariff of Porto Rico prematurely con-
Bidered as no longer forming part of
Spain."
The Petit Journal to-day publishes an
interview with the former Minister of
War, General Chanolne, who explained
that he resigned on account of dif
ference of opinion with the Minister of
Marine, M. Brisson. He added that he
had not demanded the prosecution of
papers which had been attacking the
army because he considered that the
penalties provided by the laws were In
sufficient.
The moderate papers say that yester
day realized their hopes, and the radi
cal and revisionist organs express be
lief in the existence of a military plot.
They urge a union of all republicans as
the "nly means of giving stability to
the future Ministry.

MINISTER OF MARINE
NEW YORK, Oct. 26.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent says: It is

RAIN MARS THE OPENING
OF THE PEACE JUBILEE
Elaborate Parade Arranged by Phila
delphians Postponed Until
Friday.
PHILADELPHIA. Oct. 26.â President
McKinley arrived here at noon to-day,
but instead of finding the city in the
midst of the enjoyment of its peace cel
ebration he found a dreary, desolate con-
dition of affairs, and many thousand citi
sens and visitors who were grievous.ly
disappointed at the interruption of the
jubilee exercises by the rain.
The day's programme included the clvfc
parade, the greater portion of which it
was expected would he witnessed by the
President, General Miles and other dis
tinguished visitors. At 5 o'clock this
morning, however, rain began to fall
and unttl 10 o'clock there was a heavy
downpour. During the remainder of the
day rain fell at frequent intervals.
Early in the day the citizens' committee '
concluded to abandon the day's
gramme and to postpone the parade until
Friday. The reading of the Declaration
ioi" Independence in Declaration Hall was
also postponed until Friday.
The Presidential party was met at the
i station by a reception committee and es-
I to the Bt-ll.vue Hotel, which will
be the home of the visitors during their
stay. Mrs. McKinley and the other ladies
were taken in charge by a committee con
sisting of Mrs-. Cornelius Stevenson, Mrs.
Governor. Hasting--. Mrs-. Mayor Warwick
and Miss Anne Thomson, the last the
liter of President Thomson of the
| Pennsylvania Railroad.
Vice President and Mrs. Hobart arrived
| from Washington an hour earlier than
! the President and were escorted to the
Hotel Stratford, where quarters had been
reserved for them.
President McKinley was this evening
tendered a dinner and reception at the
Union League Club. The dinner was en
tlrely informal and w^.s given by the
j board of directors of the league. There
sixty at the tables. President Stu
art of the league welcomed President Mc-
Kink-y and the latter responded very
: briefly, simply with a few words of
thanks.
LOSS OF SHIPPING
ON LAKE MICHIGAN
A Furious Gale Causes a Number of
Wrecks Along the West
Shore.
CHICAGO, Oct. 2Â«.â The gale which be
gan last night continued most of. to-day,
causing immense damage to shipping. At
! 10 o'clock to-night the wind is changing to
, the south, and huge seas which have been
rolling- on Lake Michigan for the past
'â  twenty-four hours are fast running down.
] The storm brought a long list of disasters
to the local schooner fleet, but there was
!no loss of life. A canvass of the craft at
; this end of the lake to-night .shows the
following are missing:
Aberdeen, grain, from Chicago; Delta,
! lumber, from Sheboygan; Biwahik. grain,
i from Chicago. Stafford and McWilliams,
, the Delta and Filer broke away from the
i schooner L. Pablo off Port Washington
lant night. The Pablo has arrived here.
i The Filer has been abandoned, water
j logged, by her crew oft Racine, and the
; Delta is believed to be drifting fifteen
: miles off Kenosha. The Pablo went adrift
from Kalkaska and waterlogged off
i Grosse Point. The members of the crew
were brought ashore by the tug Perfec
: tion. Efforts are being made to-night to
â¢ save the vessel. The Maxwell, Cape Horn
: and Minerva lost thfir canvas and deck
loads. Four schooners are at anchor In
shallow water south of the harbor, but
: they are safe.
The Susyuehanna passed a four-masted
I barge hove-to in mid lake off Kenosha.
' She is thought to be the Olive Jeannette.
: She was riding the storm in good" shape
and had no signal of distress flying, so
the Susqur-hanna did not go to her assist
ance. Marine men to-night are much
i alarmed about the Aberdeen.

SCHEME TO UNLOAD
THE CUBAN DEBT
In Exchange Spain Would Lil^e
to Surreoder tf)e EQtire
Ladrone Group.
NEW YORK, Oct. 26.â The Herald's Washington correspondent
telegraphs: High officials believe the Cuban debt question was
finally disposed of at the siting of the Paris commission to-day.
It is understood at to-day's wssion that Day and his colleagues
would notify the Spanish Commissioners that no further discussion
regarding the Cuban debt would be permitted.
When the cession of Guam Island to the United States is taken
up it is thought the Spanish Commissioners will attempt to surrender
the entire Ladrone group to this Government in exchange for a por
tion of the Cuban debt, but the United States intends to take Guam
Island only and not accept any portion of the Cuban debt under any
conditions.
When these several matters are out of the way the commission
will consider the control, disposal and government of the Philip
pines.
LIEUTENANT SKELLY
BACK FROM ALASKA
To Be Captain of One of the Im
mune Regiments Destined for
Cuba.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 26.â Major General
Miles has received a telegram from Lieu
tenant L. S. Skelly at Vancouver bar
racks. Wash., saying he had just returned
from a trip through the unexplored re
gion of Alaska as far as Tanana River,
and is ready for other service. This officer
is a noted scout, having served gallantly
with General Miles In most of his Indian
campaigns. During his absence he was
commissioned a captain In one of the Im
mune regiments, but owing to the fact
that he was beyond the reach of commu-
nication, the commission was not issued.
Now that he has returned, however, the
original plan will be put Into effect, and
he will be apolnted a captain of one of the
immune regiments destined for service In
Cuba.

CABINET MEETING
AT PEACE JUBILEE
Important Matters Secretly Con
sidered by the President
and t-Jis Advisers.
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 26.â Immediately after the reception to the
President at Union League a meeting of the Chief Executive and
those Cabinet officers who are in attendance with him at the Peace
Jubilee was held at the Hotel Bellevue. Those present besides the
President were Postmaster General Smith, Secretary of War Alger,
Secretary of Agriculture Wilson and Solicitor General Richards in
place of Attorney General Griggs.
The utmost secrecy attended the proceedings, and It is impossible
to learn for what purpose the meeting was called or what subjects
were discussed. From an unofficial, though ordinarily reliable,
source it was gleaned that J. C. Kellogg, private secretary to Secre
tary Hay, reached here to-niKht bearing important dispatches from
the State Department. Neither Secretary Porter nor any of the Cabi
net officers could be seen after the meeting and no other information
from other sources could be obtained.
The meeting lasted nearly an hour and was held in the Presi
dent's rooms in the hotel. Local detectives prevented any one from
approaching the vicinity. Mr. Kellogg, when quaationed about the
matter, admitted being the bearer of a message, but said it was
purely a personal one from Secretary Hay. That it was more than
some ordinary deliberation was apparent from the fact that Mr. Kel
logg reached the Union League shortly before 11 o'clock and was
immediately taken to the President. He then left and went to the
hotel, the reception coming to an end very shortly. After the Presi
dent and Cabinet had concluded their deliberations Mr. Kellogg left
immediately for Washington in a special car. It was reported after
midnight that the President may leave for AVashington in the morn
ing and not remain to review the military jubilee parade.
CUBANS OBJECT TO

SANTIAGO, Cuba, Oct. 26.â General
\vnnfi is going to-morrow to Manzanillo
tn pVtablish a civil government there on
the Santiago plan. The Cubans when the
tnwn was evacuated, understood they
w^re to participate in the management
o\ affairs Colonel Pettit of the Fourth
Immunes after the evacuation proceed
ed to make arrangements for a truly
American election, to the consternation
of the Cubans, who were awaiting action
by the Santa Cruz Assembly In reference
to elections. The situation there Is now
somewhat strained. It Is General "Wood's
intention to instruct Colonel Pettlt as to
the American policy relative to civil mat
ters in Cuba.

SHIPS WANTED AT HAVANA
SHOW OF FORCE URGED TO
QUIET THE INSURGENTS,
Cubans Take to the Hills and Threat
en to Harass American Troops
as Long as Life
Lasts.
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, IS9S, by James Gor
don Bennett.
HAVANA, Oct 26 (via Key West).â
The American Evacuation Commission
continues to advise the sending of war
ships here, but can get no reply from
Washington. The reason may be that
Admiral Sampson refused to join Gen
erals Wade and Butler in the recent re
quests. A joint session of the two com
missions will " held soon. From an
American Commissioner I learn this
session will also certainly result in
making arrangements for evacuation.
In the meantime the work of preparing:
for the landing of American troops is
progressing as rapidly as possible.
As told in a recent dispatch. General
Butler warned Secretary Alger that
some show of strength must be made
soon or America would lose all prestige
with the Cubans. To this warning
there has been given emphasis by the
reported return to the hills of a band
of insurgents who have been encamped
near Sagua. These men sent word to
General Betancourt that their condition
was intolerable. In the hills they could
live as the- had for three years, and if
American troops took charge of the
island they would harass them as long
as life lasted.
According to Gomez, it would re
quire 10.000 men to eaotuxe fifty insur
gents fighting as guerrillas in moun
tains.
Insurgents in the neighborhood of
Havana are quiet, but far from satis
fied. Matanzas merchants complain of
the lawless conduct of insurgents who
still assfi-t the right to levy contribu
tions upon sugar eatates.
Smallpox is reported epidemic in
Roja's insurgent camp, six miles from
Cienfuegos.
Colonel Hecker, who has been abused
by the Diaro Marina, to-day visited the
editor and successfully demanded an
apology. The merchants of all parts of
the island are beginning to realize that
the withdrawal of Spanish troops
means a great loss of trade and paraly
sis for many industries. For more than
three years Cuba has had within her
borders never less than 150,000 soldiers,
whose food and clothing have been pur
ohased here. Advance orders for pro
visions and supplies have fallen off
$3,000,000 in the last month, according
to Havana brokers. Since October 1
orders have gone from Havana to Bos
ton for $1,500,000 worth of sugar grind
ing machinery. Several other orders
are now pending.
CAMP SITES FOR
TROOPS IN CUBA
Their Location to Be Decided Upon
When t.ue President Returns
to Washington.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 26.â The final se
lection of camp sites for the American
troops who will garrison Cuba awaits
the President's decision on his return
from Philadelphia. It was discussed at
some length at the Cabinet meeting yes
terday, and as the various reports of the
Hecker board were not finally disposed
of it is probable the Cabinet will feel
that it should take some expert advice
before making final selections. The troops
will not be landed at one place, but each
detachment will be landed at the nearest
and most accessible port to the place
which is to form its camping ground.
Among the places that have been recom
mended by the Hecker board are Guana
bacoa, which can be reached best from
Regla, opposite Havana, on the bay; Ma
riano, about six miles southwest of Ha
vana, with a seaport at Playa de Mari
ano, and Mariel on the bay of the same
name, about twenty-five miles from Ha
vana and beyond Mariano. All these
sites fulfill the needs of good camping
grounds, but in each case the Hecker
board has found that there must be con
siderable expenditure by the Government
if permanent landing places are to be
provided, so that the troops will not run
the risk of infection in passing through.

MANY SICK SOLDIERS
BROUGHT FROM PONCE
Hospital Ship Relief Reaches Phila
delphia â One Man Dies on
the Way.
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 26.â The hospital
ship Relief, which arrived here last night
from Ponce, Porto Rico, has on board 246
sick soldiers. One soldier died on tha
way here. He was Fred Reedhouse, Com
pany L, First Illinois. He died Monday
from heart failure, following typhoid
fever. Of the other sick, 150 are con
valescent, but ninety-six of them will
have to be taken to the hospitals on
stretchers. The work of removing the
men from the ship has not begun.
The National Relief Commission Is sup
plying the men with milk and delicacies,
while they remain on the ship. Among
those who came on the Relief was Lieu
tenant Colonel R. S. Huidekoper, who has
been at Porto Rico as chief surgeon of
the United States troops. Colonel Huide
koper will go to Washington in a few
days and says that after giving testi
mony before the war investigating com
mittee he expects to return to Porto Rico.

TWO THOUSAND MILES
OVER TRACKLESS WILDS
Perilous Trip of a Harvard Man Who
Sought Fortune in. the
Klondike.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Oct. 26.â R. S.
Dunn, editor of the Harvard Monthly
In the year 1897, arrived here yester
day, after a 2000-mile trr â â  over the
! terrible Edmonton route to the Klon
: dike. He started from Edmonton,
Northwest Territory, in May of the
j present year with a party of prospec
tors, and reached Fort Graham, this
i province, about half way to Dawson,
the last of September. The trip was a
terrible one, he says. The horses of the
! party died or were shot, and month
' after month the party struggled on,
: now through a dense trackless forest,
then over immense plains, until the
Rockies were reached.
Speaking of Major Moodie of the
Northwest mounted police, who started
out from Edmonton a year ago under
Instructions from the Canadian Gov
ernment to survey an all-land route
to the Klondike, Dunn says: "I believe
Ihe has met his fate in the north. He
j was over a year on the trail when we
heard of him at Fort Graham.
"His outfit was burned in the bush
I fires, all his horses died, and he was
i pushing on with his discouraged men,
250 miles north of the post in a practi
cally unknown country. An Indian
reached Fort Graham post before I left
with the report that he had seen a
white man dead on the trail. This was
probably the intrepid major. Before
leaving Fort Graham the major was
asked when he thought he would reach
the Klondike, and he replied. 'In about
ten years, if I ever do.' His fate will
be in doubt for months."
Dunn tells ;i remarkable story, but he
tells it with an air of truthfulness that
carries conviction with it. He gradu
ated at Harvard last year and his
father is a wealthy Boston merchant.
The Garden party of Fresno and the
White party of Michigan, representing
fifty people, have returned over the Ed
monton trail from the Peace River
country, after traveling through 1300
! miles of rough country and undergoing â 
i many hardships. They returned empty
! handed. They prospected twenty-eight
i creeks and rivers over 400 miles of terri
tory. They found evidence of gold
everywhere, but not one pan would pay.
The much boomed Peace River country
turned out very disappointing. Hun- j
dreds of Americans are coming back
i over the trail under terrific winter con
i ditions.
CARPENTER WILL CASE
IS STILL UNSETTLED
For the Fourth Time It Comes Up in
the Superior Court at Stock
ton.
STOCKTON. Oct. 26.â For the fourth
time the Carpenter will contest case came
up for trial in the Superior Court this
afternoon. The first trial was in Novem
ber of ISSS.
Charles W. Carpenter died on January â â 
22, 1884, leaving- a will, by the terms of
which his property was left to C K.
Bailey the remaining member of the firm
of Bailey & Carpenter. Bailey was ap
pointed executor by the court. At that
time the property consisted of a one-half
interest in the partnership property, of
the value of $150,000.
The heirs of Carpenter, three brothers'
and a sister, brought a suit to set aside
the will on the ground of unsoundness !
of mind on the part of the testator, and 1
of fraud, menace ,and undue influence on I
the part of C. K. Bailey in procuring the ;
will made.
The first trial was in November, 1885.
The jury rendered a verdict against the
validity of the will and a new trial was
granted by the Supreme Court. The sec
ond trial took place in May, IS9I. This
trial resulted in the Jury finding for the
contestants, and the will was set aside.
Again a new trial was granted by the
Supreme Court, this time mainly upon
errors in the instructions of the court.
The third trial was had in. the fall of
1897. This time the jury disagreed, si
ing eight to four in favor of the contest
ants.
WOMEN'S PATRIOTISM

Happy Incidents at a Session of
Their National Council in
Omaha.
OMAHA, Nebr., Oct. 26.â Patriotism wafs
the principal theme of the National
Women's Council this evening, and the
appearance of the American flag in the
pulpit was greeted with spontaneous
singing by the audience of a stanza of
the national anthem, led by Mrs. J. Ellen
Foster, president of the Women's Repub
lican Association.
Fraternal greetings were voiced by Miss
Mary Carty of Toronto as the representa
tive of the Countess of Aberdeen. The
Countess is the president of the Na
tional Council of Canada and also of the
International Council.
Susan B. Anthony made a plea for
woman suffrage. Mrs. J. Ellen Foster
explained why her organization aided the
Republicans without exacting a pledge
from the party in favor of equal suf
frage. She believed that ultimately the
ballot would come to woman, but mean
while it was her duty to do all she could
for the support of Republican principles
for lhe prosperity of the country gen
erally.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Oct. 26.â
Major Pettit, in command of the
United States troops at Manzanilio and
Military Governor of the city, tele
graphed to-day that the Cuban gen
eral, Rios, offers armed men to assist
the Americans ama in preserving order,
merely asking rations in return. Gen
eral Wood sent the following reply:
"Certainly not. The only conditions
on which rations are to be issued are
the complete disarmament ond dls
bandment of the troops."
Some of the Cubans here consider
that the United States is treating its
allies badly in not allowing the Cuban
forces to remain armed. They contend
that the Cuban soldiers, who have been
figjiting three years, who speak the
language of the country are better
fitted for garrison duty than "un
trained volunteers."
The Cuban general, Rodriguez, vir
j tually voices the sentiment of the Cu
ban army when he says: "We thank
the United States for the assistance it
has given us, but the time has now ar
rived when the Cubans should be
placed in the highest offices and should
! be prepared to take over the island on
the departure of the Spanish."
Cuban extremists here are jubilant
at the reported attitude of the Cuban
Assembly at Santa Cruz del Sur, where
the delegates, while expressing their
gratitude to the Americans, practically
demand a distinctive Cuban govern
ment. The Cuban moderates, on the
other hand, regret this stand, thinking
it best for the United States authori
ties to continue in charge of affairs for
a year at least so as to set things going
and to prevent any complications with
foreign Governments.
The foreign Consuls are considering
the advisability of appealing to the
powers to prevent a too hasty recogni
tion of the Cuban government.
â¢ General Wood is considering the ad
visability of granting a hotel license to
any responsible applicant who would
undertake to establish a first-class

General Wood is fully resolved to

and especially no more from the West
Indies, a class entirely unwilling to do
hard work. One schooner from Ja
maica and one from HaytV loaded with
negro emigrants, have been ordered to
return their passengers to ports of em

Lieutenant Victor Blue, in command
of the prize gunboat Alvarado, arrived

SAN RAFAEL JUSTICE
MAKES TW.O HEARTS ONE
Some Trouble About the License, but
Avarila Hess Finally Becomes
Mrs. Green.
SAN RAFAEL, Oct. 26.â The final chap
ter of the story recounting the indiscre
tion of youthful Avarila Hess, who eloped
and went to Victoria, with a man named
Wolfe, was written to-day, when the girl
was married in this city to Edward D.
Green by Justice Gardner. In response to
a telegram from an attorney of San
Francisco, County Clerk Bonneau held
his office open after the usual hour, and
met Miss Hess and her mother, Green
and the lawyer by appointment. Subse
quent events showed why. The mother,
Mrs. Lizzie Vernon of Merced, made affl-
davit that her daughter was past 16 years
of age, and gave her consent to the mar
riage. Upon this showing the license was
granted, and shortly afterward the par
ties were married and took the late train
for the city.
It was only yesterday that the couple
applied for a license in Oakland, and as
the mother admitted the girl to be only
14 years old, the law requiring that she
be 15 had to be observed, and a license
waa refused. If Mrs. Vernon told the
truth in Oakland she perjured herself to
day by swearing that the girl is past 16
yean of age. This explains the secrecy
maintained in securing the license and
the fear expressed to the Clerk that the
reporters might get hold of the facts.

OREGON INDIAN TROUBLE.
Several Citizens Reported Shot Near
Canyon City.
BAKER CITY, Or., Oct. 26.â Word was
received here to-day by telephone from
Canyon City of a shooting affray in which
Indians shot and seriously wounded Dave
Cuttings, and shot the horses from un
der F. Duncan and P. Mosier. The red
skins then went to the home of John
High and shot him, but not fatally. The
scene of the trouble is on the south fork
of John Daly River, about thirty miles
southwest of Canyon City. A well armed
posse from Canyon City has taken up the
trail and hard fighting is expected, as !
the Indians are well armed.
Strange Suicide Near Colfax.
AUBURN. Cal., Oct. 26.â An unknown

He was apparently about 65 years of age,
and wore a bushy, gray mustache. A

Populists Getting the Short End
Everything â Good Government

Gangsters.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 26.â Santa Clara
County will give Henry T. Gage a
iarger majority than it has ever given
any Republican candidate for Gover
nor. Reports from different parts of
the county con inn this. The orchard
ists and farmers do not take to Ma
guireism, and the majority of them are
enthusiastic supporters of Gage. Ma
quire was greeted by a big audience
here a few days ago, but a large pro
portion attended as spectators and
will vote the Republican State ticket.
The greetings accorded Congressman
Loud at his meetings throughout the
county during the past ten days shows
how the people startd on the State
ticket. Everywhere his meetings are
crowded and people promise their sup
port to himself and Gage.
The fusion of Democrats and Popu
lists has driven many Democrats to the
Republican State ticket, while there is
dissatisfaction among the Populists.
The latter believe they are getting the
worst of it from the Democrats and
that the Maguireites are working prin
cipally for their own men and these
will also support the Republican can
didate for Governor.
The Republican Good Government
League has been chiefly instrumental in
bringing about this condition in politics
for the Republican State ticket. They
harre â¢ canvassed the county and did
hard work for it in their fight against
Rea and for reform. At all their meet
ings they have urged the people to
support Gage, Loud and the State and
Legislative ticket. The league has over
1600 members and each of these has
been working energetically in his own
locality. By this means a thorough or
ganization has been perfected.
The Rea county central committee is
making no effort to elect the State
ticket. The Reaites county ticket can
didates hold nightly meetings in vari
ous parts of the county, bui they are
too busy seeking votes for themselves
to take any interest in the guberna
torial fight. This lack of interest in
the election of the State ticket is ac
cording to orders issued by Rea and
Mackenzie. In fact these two worthies
would like to see Gage defeatedâ simply
because Paul P. Austin, one of Boss
Rea's henchmen in the Board of Su
pervisors, vwas not given tin? Repub
lican nomination for Secretary of State.
The chances of. the Good Government
League electing its county ticket are as
bright as those for the State ticket.
Encouraging reports come in fro-m all
over the county, and it is almost certain
the reform forces will carry the election.
The union of Good Government League,
Democrats and Populists upon go<rd
men for county offices means the de
feat of the gang. The people art- tired
of being taxed to provide for the sup
port of friends of Rea and the Macken
zie family. Taxes are being steadily in
creased without any material benefits,
and the schools and other institutions
wrecked through gang interference.
The gang is doing all in its power to
defeat L. J. Chipman for Superintend
ent of Schools. This official has held
the office for over twenty years, and
because he refused to obey Boss Rea's
mandates the edict has gone forth to
ruin him politically and every other
way. Chipman refused to go before the
Rea Republican convention this year
and took the nomination from the Good
Government League. Rea's candidate
for Superintendent of Schools is H. C.
Fabes, a recent arrival from Santa Bar
bara. He is a migratory candidate for
the office and ran for the same po
sition four years ago In Santa Bar
bara County.
The gang has left no-thing undone to
defeat Chipman. The Board of Super
visors, at the direction of Chairman
Rea, a brother of the Boss, ordered an
investigation of the Superintendent's
office. Experts worked upon the books
for some time and last week turned
over a bulky report to Superintendent
Rea. This report has not been filed
with the board, but it is said that it is
being used as a campaign document
against Chipman. The office has al
ways been ably conducted and it is cer
tain no Irregularities could be discov
ered. I
Matters will probably be turned and
twisted bo as to make some nonsensical
charge against the Superintendent. The
report will undoubtedly be filed a day
or two before election, when It Is too
late to circulate a general denial

STARTLING NEWS BY COURIER

Much Alarm in the Southern Part of
Nevada â Washington Authori
ties Make Light of the
Situation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
RENO, Nev., Oct. 26.â A special from
Carson to the Gazette says Governor
Sadler has received p telegram from
Midas, Nye County, Nevada, announc
ing that a serious Indian outbreak has
occurred there and asking for arms and
ammunition. The Governor has for
warded seventy-five rines and a sup
ply of ammunition.
The trouble arose over the arrest of
one of the members of the Shoshone
tribe as the result of a quarrel between
him and a white man.
CARSON, i\ev., Oct. 26.â Officers at
the are in a state of deep
anxiety since the receipt of the news
of the threatened Shoshone Indian out
break at Midas, Nye County. No word
has beeoi received since the first mes
sage calling for arms and ammunition
and stating that the Indians threatened
to revolt.
The courier who rode into Sodaville
with this message only stopped to tell
the solicitous citizens the meager facts
and then remounted his horse with the
ominous words that he guessed every
one of the few settlers would be needed
and he would have to hurry back.
Although his message stated that
there were all the men necessary for
withstanding any attack from the In
dians, the officers in command of the
battalion are now in consultation as to
whether the mustering-out proceedings
should not be suspended pending
further news. This may not arrive for
several days, as Midas is situated in an
isolated portion of the southern part of
Nevada and the stage leaves there but
once a week.
Other Indian tribes have not as yet
become acquainted with the facts, so it
is not known whether they will assist
the Shoshones, who have heretofore
been regarded as the most peaceable of
dusky natives.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 26.â The alleged
threatened outbreak of Western Sho
shone Indians in Nevada has not been
reported to the Indian Bureau, and in
the absence of word of any kind offi
cially on the subject Commissioner
Jones is inclined to believe serious
trouble is not to be apprehended. There
are 645 of the Shoshones, all told, but
a very small number of braves. The
official reports of the tribe refer to its
members aa a "simple, kind and gen
tle people," and the latest one says
"disturbances are not as frequent
among them as they would be among
an equal number of white people dwell
ing together."
The Shoshones, it is possible, may
have had a little controversy with the
whites on adjacent lands, but the idea
of serious trouble is scouted. These In
dians have a reputation as willing
workers, but their land is poor agri
culturally and they have no means to
go into stock raising.
FIRE DESTROYS THE
HASTINGS SAWMILL
One of the Most Important Plants on
the Coast â Army of Men Out
of Work.
VANCOUVER, Oct. 26.â Fire has left
but a remnant of the Hastings sawmill,
and 250 men are out of employment. This
mill was one of the most complete on the
Pacific Coast, having a capacity for 300,
000 feet every twenty-four hours 0r.3,000,000
feet per annum. The very valuable ma
chinery has all been destroyed as well as
the wharf and company's mill. The own
er is the Royal City Planing 1 Mill Com
pany, and the loss goes up to several
hundred thousand dollars.
Three lumber ships were saved hy stren
uous efforts. They were the American
ship Kennebec, loading for South Africa;
the British bark Gartmore and the Chil
ean bark Elisa. They were in Imminent
danger during part of the fire, but fortu
nately tugs were in readiness close by
and they were hauled out into Burrard
Inlet. The cause of the fire is unknown at
present.

Turning Out Armor Ahead of Con

to the Ordnance
Bureau.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Oct. 26.
The first of an important series of
armor tests was held at the naval prov
ing station to-day when a 10-inch plate,
representing a large group of armor for
the battleship Wisconsin, under con
struction by the Union Iron Works at
San Francisco, stood successfully the
terrific blows from two projectiles fired
out of a 10-inch rifle with full service
charges. The delivery of armor for
this ship and her sister vessels, the Al
abama and Illinois, was not required,
under the contracts, until January 1
next, and the fact that the firms are
capable of turning out plates ahead of
required time is most gratifying to the
Ordnance Bureau, which will soon
award other large contracts for the
battleships and monitors authorized by
Congress at the last session.
The plate tested to-day represented
more than 700 tons of barbette armor.
The deduction made by the ordnance
officer who witnessed the test was that
a 10-inch projectile cannot penetrate
fifteen inches of armor, except when
the highest velocities are employed.
The plate stood the two shots well and
at the end of the trial presented but
one crack of a trivial character and
not extending through the armor.
The first shot was with a velocity of
1513 feet per second, armor-piercing
shell, and the effect was to break up
the head of the projectile and secure a
penetration of only seven inches. No
laree cracks resulted. On the second
shot the velocity was increased to 1903
feet per second the same gun being
used, and the result was to fracture
the shell in three pieces, the nose get
ting through the armor and into the
stout oaken backing behind. A slight
crack was created, but this was ex
pected, as the point of impact was only
thirty-six inches from the side of the
plate.
The results obtained were entirely
satisfactory to the experts and insure
acceptance of the entire group of plate.
Next week another plate, represent
ing a second group, will be tested. The
plate tested to-day was made by the
Carnegie Company. While the trial
amply demonstrated the resisting qual
ities of the armor treated with the Har
vey process, the ordnance officials are
confident that the new Krupp treat
ment is vastly superior, probably 20
per cent better, and that in the pur
chase of armor for new vessels and
monitors under this year's programing
of increase it should be bought.
Captain O'Neil, chief of the Ordnance
Bureau, believes that the Krupp armor
is so much better than the Harvey va
riety that even where it is more expen
sive the Government should protect the
new vessels with it.

A LYNCHING

by Roughs.
MANY VILLAINOUS CRIMES
WOMEN AND CHILDREN AT
TACKED ON THE STREETS
Carnes Held for Trial Before the Su
perior Court for the Abduc
tion of Edna
Osborn.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WATSONVTLLE, Oct. 26.â Something
In the shape of a man at the end of a
rope is liable to drop in this unusually
quiet and orderly city if the fathers of
families can lay their hands on the
man or men who are terrorizing their
children. This state of mind has
been brought about, not alone by the
Osborn abduction case, but by the
scandalous acts of several men who
have thus far escaped apprehension.
"Watsonville has been unfortunate in
her prosperity this year. The fact that
comparatively good crops were raised
here and that drought prevailed in the
adjoining and southern counties at
tracted a floating population that
could well have been spared. This
class of people is still here in large
numbers, and is composed of Slavo
nians and half-caste Portuguese and
Mexicans. They are in many cases
degenerates, have little respect for law I
and do not comprehend the meaning !
of the word morality. As a conse
quence, since the gathering of the har
vest began several scandalous acts
have been committed, the perpetrators
of which the law officers have been un
able to find. There is a "Jack the
Hugger" here, who walks up behind
women on the side streets in the even
ing and embraces them in a most amor
ous manner. There have been five
such cases in a week, and in one in
stance a married woman was forcibly
embraced while her husband was a half
block away, talking to a friend on the
si cie walk.
Another case is reported where a man
in broad daylight on a side street
walked up behind a young woman and
after taking shocking liberties with
her ran away and has not been appre
hended.
There is still another scoundrel in
this city who shocks decency by his ac
tions. The latest announcement which
adds to the anger of the men of Wat
sonville is that the daughter of A. W.
Fell, a phutngrrapher, was pursued by \
an unknown man for several blocks !
and fast running: only saved her from
the clutches of the miscreant. She
could not reach her home, but ran into
the house of a neighbor, being followed
to the gate by her pursuer. The young ;
woman was too frightened to tell her ,
experience promptly and the fellow es
caped, notwithstanding the man of the
house went after him with a gun.
There is an undercurrent of feeling
here in consequence of these outrages
that bodes no good for the perpetrators
It was publicly stated on the streets to
day by prominent citizens that if they
succeed in catching the men who are
committing these acts and are confident
of their guilt there will be no expense
to the county except that of a Coroner's
inquest. This sentiment is not con
fined to the younger men of the com
munity, but to those of mature years,
who are the fathers of families.
The fact that Fred Carnes, one of the :
men charged with the abduction of
Edna Osborn, was held to answer to
day before the Superior Court on a
charge of felony may put a check to
this kind of outlawry, and it will be
well for somebody if it does. The pre
liminary examination of Romero and
Came.Â« in the abduction case was held !
to-day before Judge Yoacham. Public
interest in the case was so- great that
the courtroom could not accommodate !
the people, the Mexican element b.in
largely in the majority. The testimony
presented was a repetition of what has I
appeared in The Call.
The facts that landed Carnes in the
toils of the Superior Court were the
finding of his weight tag from the su
gar company in the seat of the stolen
buggy, a lock of the girl's hair, th
tracing of the tracks of the vehicle to
the front of the door of his lodging
house and his inability to prove that he
was at home at the time the crime was
committed. Aside from the evidence of

Edna Osborn and her mother there was
nothing in the proceedings that has not
been published in these columns. The
intended victim is an unusually bright
girl for her years and bravely torn the
co-urt of her strange experience. She
j said she first thought in her semi-con
scious condition when being carried
from her room that there was a fire,
and that her sister was taking her to
a place of safety. Then the pressure of
the man's cold fingers upon her throat
and the realization that she was being
dragged down the steps aroused her,
and she had strength to break the
fiend's grip and cry out for the protec
tion of her father. Her outcry evi
dently alarmed her abductor, for he re
leased the girl and climbed over a six
foot fence. She only had a glimpse of
the hands and upper half of the face of
the man as he dropped aver the opposite
j side of the fence and could not identify
either of the prisoners as the man who
; carried her out of the house.
Mrs. Osborn, the mother, stated that
she was awakened about 2 o'clock in
the morning by a noise in the direction
of her daughter's room and heard the
cry of "Mamma," "Papa," followed by
the sound of some one colliding with
the kitchen table and of something be
ing dragged over the kitchen floor.
She aroused Mr. Osborn and before he
could reach the scene she again heard
her daughter's appeal for help. She
stated that the girl's throat was bruised
and scratched from the choking she had
received, and that one of her limbs be
low the knee was injured from being
dragged down the steps.
The evidence of Judson L. Craig, a
clerk in the office of the Western Beet
Sugar Company, with reference to the
issuance of the tell-tale weight tag was
the backbone of the prosecution's case,
without which Carnes could not have
been held.
The tag was originally given to Ro
mero, who handed it over to Carnes.
The latter returned it to the office of
the company for correction and was the
last man known to possess it. His ex
planation that he had thrown it away
did not account for it being found in
the seat of the stolen buggy and this
in connection with the other evidence
hoids him for trial.
Carnes comes from a fine family in
] Ventura. His father is an educated
| and polished gentleman, 80 years of age,
j and was the first Postmaster of Santa
! Barbara. The prisoner eight years ago !
! was Deputy Recorder of Ventura
i County and is said to have got into
I trouble that resulted in his permanent
j departure from that section. This even
. ing Sheriff Besse showed Carnes a dis
j patch from his old father asking about
i the result of the trial, and after read
ing it the prisoner cried like a child
Despite the fact that the circumstan
tial evidence was ample to hold Carnes
there is some doubt as to whether the
right man has been remanded. There
I is a certain hard element here that is
j not being overlooked. Bradley Sargent
i attorney for the defendant, stated open
ly this evening that he would, within
a few days, demonstrate that his client
is innocent and at the same time fasten
the crime upon two young Americans
VI t i ll ?. city whose connections are such
that his expose will shock the com
munity.
ENDOWMENT FOR THE

port of the archdiocese of that city re
plete with the details of the work of tne |

Charles Webber, treasurer of the Erastus !
Bronson memorial committee in a nttlne i
Â» ' Th P ? rted that the committee hal
decided that an endowment in theCath- !
?nPr.P^ ersity was an appropriate instru
ment to perpetuate the memory of that ]
eminent man, and he handed to Monsignor
Conally, the rector of the university, a
package, which supposedly contained a
check as the nucleus for rr ,.i~, r _Â,. !
these intentions. The monsipnor in a
brief speech, thanked the union for its
Rift, which he promised would be placed j
where it would do the most goodâ among I
the lay schools. Then he spoke of the
w<>rk and scope of the university of its
popular features and its prospects for
greater work in the future than in the
past. It was a university, he said, where
priests and laymen united as in no other !
place to teach the doctrines of the church ;
and sciences under the inspiration of God
Monsignor Stephen, head of the Indian,
bureau of the Catholic church, spoke of
his work among the red men of the West
pointing out the great work laymen can
do in this connection. The Indians wage
war, he declared, and he gave them credit 'â 
for doing so. for they had been cheated !
of their rights from first to last.
The following officers were elected-
President, WiUiam M. McGuire of Brook

Rahway, N. J. ; second vice-president
Daniel P. Toomoy of lioston; secretary I

GENERAL KITCHENER
ARRIVES AT PARIS
MARSEILLES, Oct. 26.â General
Lord Kitchener of Khartoum and Cap
tain Baratier, the bearer of Major
Marchand's Fashoda report, arrived
from Alexandria, Egypt, to-day on
board the Messageries steamer from
that port. During the voyage the two
officers dined together and cordlally
conversed on the customs of the tribes
and peoples each had met.
The British Consul here met General
Kitchener on landing and Captain
Baratier received an affectionate greet
ing from his mother and brother.
General Kitchener and Captain Bara
tier left for Paris on the same train.
A crowd which assembled on the plat
form cheered Captain Baratier and a
delegation from the naval and commer
cial schools presented him with the in
j signia of the Legion of Honor.
A deputation from the Geographical
j Society of Marseilles congratulated
j Captain Baratier. To General Kitchen
er the speakers also expressed admira-
I tion of his Nile campaign and his work
I in behalf of civilization and thanked
' him for the courtesy he had extended
j to Major Marchand and his colleagues.
The general thanked his visitors warm
ly and eulogized Major Marchand,
whose expedition he said had excited
the admiratio- of the world. The train

CRUISER BUFFALO
WILL SOON DEPART
Getting Ready to Make the Long
Voyage to Manila by Way of
the Suez Canal.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 26.â 1t is expected
at the Navy Department that the cruiser
Buffalo will start from New York on
her trip to Manila before the end of the
present week. Final preparations for hei
departure, such as coaling and taking on
supplies for the voyage, are now being
made under the direction of Captain
Hemphill, the vessel's commander. The
Buffalo will carry to Admiral Dewey's
fleet between COO and 700 recruits, besides
a quantity of supplies of various kinds
for our navy in the Philippines. She will
go by way of the Suez canal. The
Buffalo Is able to make this long, contin-i
uous trip by reason of her enormous
steaming capacity, which easily exceeds
that of any cruising ship in the navy.
Although there is no occasion for great
haste, no time will be wasted on the voy
age. The vessel is capable of making
very fast speed, as was shown in her trip
from Norfolk, Va., to New York just
after her arrival from Brazil, whence she
started with tne Oregon and the Marietta.
At that time, under adverse circum
stances after a long voyage, she made an
average of 15 knots an hour. Should any
emergency arise in the Philippines dur
ing her long voyage she could make the
last stage of the journey in very quick
time upon receiving orders at Colombo.
SURROUNDED BY FLAMES
WHILE FIGHTING FIRE
Shocking Fate of C. A. Newton in the
Yucaipe /alleyâ Death After
Intense Agony.
REDLANDS, Cal., Oct. 2Câ Yesterday
afternoon C. A. Newton was burned to
death while fighting the forest fire in
Yucaipe Valley. His home was threat
ened, and he was engaged in back-firing,
when he discovered that he was sur
rounded by flames. He made a dash for
liberty through a wall of flames and all
his clothing except his boots was burned
from his body. His wife saw him and
rushed to the rescue, helping to tear the
burning clothing from him, and finally
got him into the house, when she ran
three miles for a physician. For two
hours Newton suffered great agony, when
death relieved him. He was a native of
Ohio, aged 64, and a member of the G.
A. R.
AVARICIOUS WHITES
CAUSED THE TROUBLE
Commissioner Jones Reports on His
Investigation Into the Chippe
wa Uprising.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 26.â Commissioner
of Indian Affairs William A. Jones, who
has been for a week in Minnesota making
negotiations, which were successful, with
the Chippewa Indians for the resumption
of peaceful relations with the Govern
ment, has returned to Washington, and
to-day made a verbal report to Secretary
Bliss on his work. Commissioner Jones
says the trouble Is attributable to the
methods of the whites in the vicinity, who
are taking gross advantage of the In
dians.
Wheat $2 a Bushel.
Some farmers are holding their wheat be
rause they think the price will go to 12 a
bushel. The price, however, may go down
Instead of up, and thus great losses will fol
low delay In selling. In all matters delays
are dangerous, particularly so In sickness. At
the first sign of biliousness, dyspepsia, indi
gestion or constipation cure yourself with
Hortetter's Btomach Bitters. Don't wait for
your condition to improve Itself, for It Is apt
to get worse still.

FUTURE OF THE PHILIPPINES
AMERICANS READY TO TAKE
UP THE ISSUE.
Upheaval in France That May Delay
the Settlement of Matters Re
lating to the Peace
Treaty.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Oct. 26.â The American Peace
Commissioners held a session of sev
eral hours' duration to-day prior to the
joint session of the two commissions,
which opened at 4 o'clock this after
noon. The Americans fully realize
that they are approaching the discus
sion of the chief question intrusted to
them, namely, the future of the Phil
ippine Islands, and it may be taken for
granted that they are well prepared to
take the matter up when broached by
the Spanish Commission.
The meeting of the Commissioners
lasted an hour and five minutes and
was adjourned until to-morrow.
Both the Spanish and the American
Commissioners were more reticent after
this session than ever before. The
Americans fully appreciate not only
theii own serious responsibilities, but
also the delicate position of their Span
ish colleagues, to the burden of whose
duties here is now added the critical
political situation at Madrid, which
may compel the president of the Span
ish Commission (who is also president
of the Spanish Senate), Senor Montero
Rios, to leave Paris.
The Madrid correspondent of the
Temps, confirming the report that Pre
mier Sagasta and the Queen Regent
have prevailed upon the Minister of
War, General Correa, to indefinitely
postpone his resignation, pending the
conclusion of the peace negotiations,
says that they represented to the gen
eral that his withdrawal might entail
not only the fall of the Cabinet but
cause the resignation of certain mem
bers of the Spanish Commission, in
cluding Senor Montero Rios, and there,
by gravely compromise the United
States. The correspondent says:
"The net result is that an open crisis
seems to have been avoided until the
conclusion of the treaty of peace. In
any case this has done away with the
necessity of an ad interim government
which was lately suggested as likely
to be the only solution of the present
difficulties."
As the peace negotiations are now
nearing the discussion of the Philip
pine question, the Americans feel that
no stage of the proceedings has so de
manded their considerate treatment. It
may be stated to-night with certainty
that the Cuban question has not re
ceived its last consideration by the
Americans, nor # have the Spaniards ac
cepted as ultimate the United States'
refusal to assume any portion of tho
Cuban debt. It may, however, be af
firmed that the Philippine question was
not reached to-day, but it may be dis
cussed at to-morrow's session, which
will be the first occasion during these
negotiations of a joint session of the
commissions being held on succeeding
days, which fact is in some degree sig
nificant.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 26.â Some ap
prehension has been manifested in cer
tain quarters as to the possible ad
verse effect upon the Peace Commission
at Paris of an upheaval in France. It
has been suggested that the Spanish
case is in such shape that the Spanish
Government has nothing to lose and
everything to gain by any change that
can be brought about. However that
may be. it is the stated opinion of the
State Department officials here that
there is little danger of the situation
in Paris becoming so acute as to Justify

an abandonment of the work of the
commission on the ground that the
members themselves are in physical
danger. It is confidently believed
that, with the change of Cabinet In
France, the present disorder will sub
side and normal conditions will be re
stored. It is always possible that the
Spanish Commissioners, in despair over
their failure to force the Cuban debt
upon the United States in any shape,
may break off the sessions, but this Is
not regarded as probable. It is ex
pected that the Spanish programme is
to trump up as many points of differ,
ence as possible, relying upon the sym
pathy to be excited among European
nations by their dispute of each point.
This being the Spanish policy, it Is
expected that when the commission
takes up the subjects of Porto Rico and
the coaling station in the Ladrone Isl
ands, there will be many hair-splitting
objections interposed by the Spanish to
propositions from the Americans, just
as many references or attempts at ref
erence to Madrid and just as loud pro
tests over each little point by the Span
iards at the uncompromising attitude
of the Americans as there have been
In the case of Cuba.
HOW CORPORATIONS
DODGE THEIR TAXES
Plain Talk at the Convention of the
Municipal Improvement
Society.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 26.â Representa
tives from various cities of the United
States and Canada met here to-day at
the Arlington Hotel at the fifth annual
convention of the American Society of
Municipal Improvements. The attendance
was rather small at the opening, but
many delegates are expected.
The feature of the morning session was
an address of welcome by Hon. John B.
Wight, president of the Board of Com
missioners of this district, and the re
sponse by the president of the society,
Harrison Van Duyne of Newark, N. J.
Mr. Van Duyne said that coincident with
the advance In- city development the past
few years was the increased value of the
franchises that had been given to many
companies, which pay only a small part of
the public burdens belonging to them,
while the tax burdens of others had pro
portionately increased. He knew of no
reason why the companies owning fran
chises should not contribute their share
to the support of the schools and other
city expenses.
D. L. Fulton of Allegheny, Pa., sub
mitted his annual report, and that of
John Kennedy, the treasurer, of Nash
ville, Term., was read in his absence.
SMALL LEGACY LEADS

Himself.
ST. PAUL,, Minn., Oct. 26.â Late this af
ternoon Dan Coughlan, a blind retired
railroad engineer, shot and killed his
young sister-in-law. Miss Katie Marsinan,
and then fatally shot himself. Mr?.
Coughlan a short time afterward discov
ered the dead bodies, and then became
nearly crazed over the tragedy. The
mother of the two women recently died,
leaving her entire estate, valued at about
$1000, to the unmarried daughter. Cough

over this fact, which is thought to have
led to the tragedy, to which there were
no witnesses.

PATRIOTISM IN THE NAVY
THE SECBETABY P>YS HIGH
TBIBUTE TO THE MEN.
He Says That All Cabinet Officers
Should Have a Place on the
Floor of Con
gress.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, Oct. 26.â Secretary of the
Navy Long received a genuine New
England welcome at Music Hall to
night on the occasion of the annual
dinner of the Republican Club of Mas
sachusetts. There were more than 800
Republicans of New England at the
tables. The galleries were crowded
with ladies and gentlemen.
The other guests of honor were Gov
ernor Wolcott, Senator Lodge and Con
gressman Dingley. The guests and
many of the leading Republicans of the
State were seated on the platform.
Secretary Long was the principal
speaker. When he rose he received a
tremendous ovation.
My experience in the Cabinet has con
firmed the impression that I have long
cherished that a Cabinet officer, with or
without a vote, should have a place on the
floor of Congress, where he shall be sub
ject to questioning in all matters of his
administration and have the opportunity
to present in person the needs and de
mands of his branch of the public service.
The almost entire freedom of the navy
during the war from loss of life or sick
ness or disease and from even ordinary
casualties is the best evidence of the
thoroughness of its preparation, the In
telligence of its direction and the skill,
efficiency and thorough training of its
officers and men. Let me bear my testi
mony that all this has been the work of
the navy itself, and not of any man at its
head; of the completeness of its system
and the competency of its personnel. Of
its professional spirit I cannot speak too
highly. The commandant at the yard,
the chief in the bureau and no less the
grades, every one of them below these,
line and staff, superior and subordinate,
have all worked with matchless fidelity
and ability and in harmonious co-opera
tion, and deserve equal honor.
The glory of the navy and the glory of
the war, which it shares with the army.
Is not, however, in battle alone; or rather,
it is not in the brutal elements of battle.
It Is rather in the fine instinct, the heroic
courage, the splendid devotion, the in
tense patriotism, which nerve men to en
dure what otherwise were unpardonable
horrors of armed conflict for the sake of
the cause for which battles are fought.
The lesson has not been lost on civiliza
tion, when Cervera. returning to his seat
in the Spanish Senate, proclaims the hu
manity of America, and suggests to Spain
that she benefit by our example, awaken
from her bondage to old limitations, and
follow the lead of American enterprise
and American institutions.
If I may say one word more concerning
the navy, I agree with the evident propo
sition that with the extension of our ter
ritory, the new duties that are on us and
the now enlarged importance of our sea
power, the increase in our naval force
should follow. But I am not one of those
who would have it extravagantly expand
ed, and I would prefer a reasonable in
crease commensurate with the increased
need. Too rapid a development will sureiy
lead to a reaction in the popular mind and
a tendency to the extreme, as happened
after the war of the Union. Nor must
we forget that the Increase of the army
and navy is necessarily attended with a
great increase in expenditure; therefore
in taxation; and in the zeal of the present
moment we may stand on the old funda
mental principle that under no circum
stances should this be a country where
the military arm is a burden Instead of
a defense, and the military arm must be
subservient by a long interval to the edu
cational and industrial.
If ever there was a man who loved his
country, a servant of the public whose
purpose was to do his duty and was guid
ed by a prayerful sense of accountability
to God and his fellow-men, it is President
McKinley. For two years I have stood at
the Cabinet table, and I recall not one in
stance when one word has been uttered
with regard to its effect or bearing on the
personal or political future of the Presi
dent or any member of his Cabinet, or of
the party of which he was the choice two
years ago. as to-day he is the choice of
all the people.

Regarding Camps.
! DELAY IN SECURING TENTS
SNOWSTOBM INTEBFEBÂ£S WITH
THE WAE BOARD.
Inspection of Camp Frosee Suspended,
but the Taking ot Testi
mony Goes on
Steadily.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HUNTSVILLE, Fla., Oct. 26.â The
War Investigation Commission to-day
suspended the inspection of Camp Fro
see, owing to a mild snowstorm and
very muddy roads. The camp here is
a large one, with about fifteen subdi
visions of troops, to say nothing of the
hospitals.
The commission began the examina
tion of witnesses to-day with General
Louis H. Carpenter, who is in command
in General Wheeler's absence. He had
been at Chickamauga, Tampa and at
Fernandina before coming here. He
said the camp at Chickamauga was too
crowded. That at Tampa was unsatis
factory, but it was not intended to be
permanent. That at Fernandina was
ideal. The food supply had been ample
throughout, but quartermaster supplies
were generally slow and there had been
especial difficulty in securing tents.
There was more trouble in getting sup
plies at Tampa than anywhere else,
because of the railroad congestion.
Major Charles M. Gandy, the surgeon
who was in charge of the medical sup
ply depot at Tampa, said he had been
able to fill all reasonable requisitions
for medical supplies with promptness,
but many bulky articles for which sub
stitutes could be had were not supplied.
The regulars were easily satisfied, but
the volunteers were exacting. Still
there were delays. He mentioned one
instance of supplies ordered from New
York that were not received for two
months. He had fitted out the Shafter
expedition for Cuba and thought that
in the main the expedition was fairly
supplied. This was especially true of
the first requisition. Half of the sup
plies he had on hand had been packed
for Cuba, and he had afterward made
a supplemental shipment of two wagon
loads. He had afterward heard that
many of these stores came back to
Tampa in the hold of the Iroquois. He
gave the name of Captain Munson as
authority for this latter statement, and
he was sure Captain Munson would tes
tify willingly and fully.

Interior and others who have part in the
administration to urge immediate action
that the policy now theoretically held by

He Draws Thousands of Dollars
for a Fraudulent Mili=
tary Roll.
Used the Names of Ex=
empts, Dead Men and
Cripples to Swell Bis
Receipts.
During the present year and during
past years Tax Collector James N.
Block has drawn thousands of dollars
from the public treasury to which he
was not entitled by law.
Tax Collector James N. Block wants i
to succeed himself, and as a necessary j
preliminary he has secured the nor- j
ination for the office which he now
holds at the hands of James D. Phelan
and his Committee of One Hundred
Job-chasers. As a nominee he is being
held up by the Mayor as a model of j
purity and a man in whom the public
can repose the most implicit confi
dence.
For the benefit of those voters and
taxpayers who may be deluded by the
fulsome promises and ready tongue of
the "hefting" Mayor a plain relation of
facts concerning the way in which Tax
Collector James N. Block has trans
ferred from the public treasury to his
own pocket thousands of dollars to
which he was not lustly entitled and
has imposed upon the taxpayers of this
city heavy burdens that he might en
rich personal henchmen and thus repay
political obligations is here set forth
in as brief and concise a manner as is
consistent with a full understanding of
the facts.
The Tax Collector is by law (sections
1895 and 1897 of the Political Code)
charged with the duty of annually en
rolling every able-bodied male inhabi- i
tant of this city and county, except
MongMians and Indians, between the
ages of 18 and 45, not exempt by law
from military duty, and his compensa
tion is fixed by section 1901 of the same
code at the rate of 5o for each 100
names of persons returned by him as
subject to military duty. In other
â¢words, he is required to prepare a list
of the names of all men resident in
this city and county who are subject
under the law to military duty. For
performing this labor he receives 5
cents for every name so enrolled.
In addition to the above exemptions
the following are not subject to en
rollment:
1. Ministers of religion.
2. Civil and military officers of the
United States.
S. Officers of foreign governments.
4. Civil officers of the State of Cali
fornia,
5 All persons exempted from military
duty by the laws of the United States.
Various penalties are prescribed for
neglect or refusal of the Tax Collector
to make proper returns.
Instead of ascertaining by a house
to-house canvass, as the law clearly
directs, and as is done by the Federal
Government in taking the census as
â well as by the school department of
this city and county, this model Tax
Collector simply takes the various pre
cinct registers copies the names alpha
betically by Assembly districts and
then makes oath before the clerk of
the Board of Supervisors to the correct
ness of the roll.
And, wonderful to relate, he has used
the same precinct registers for two
successive years; that is, he made up
the roll for 1897 and 1898 from the regis
ters of 1896, owing to the fact that the
registers are only made up biennially
and whenever an election is about to
be held. The fact that hundreds have
died in the meantime, that other hun
dreds have gone to Cuba, Porto Rico,
Manila, to the Klondike and to the
Eastern States, and that several thous
and of citizens otherwise subject to
military duty usually refrain from
placing their names upon the precinct
ADVERTISEMENTS.
To keep the skin clean
is to wash the exaretions
from it off; the skin takes
care of itself inside, if not
blocked outside.
To wash it often and
clean, without doing any
sort of violence to it, re-
quires a most gentle soap,
a soap with no free al-
kali in it.
Pears', the soap that
clears but not excoriates.
All sorts of stores sell it, especially
druggists; all sorts of people uÂ»e it
registers makes no difference to this
model of municipal virtue. And since
the registers only contain the names of
those who have arrived at the age of
21, how are the United States officers
who are charged with the duty of en
rolling all persons who may from time
to time arrive at the age of IS years,
and who being of the age of IS years
are subject to military duty, to tell from
the original roll furnished them by the
State authorities when the roll of this
city and county does not contain the
name of a single person below the age
of 21 years?
Section 1627 of the Revised Statutes
or' the United States makes it the duty
of the enrolling officers to serve notices
upon those whose names appear upon
the roll, but the Tax Collector, in his
eagerness to grasp the 5-cent pieces, has
failed to give the addresses of no less
than Sl2l of the 46,290 persons whose
names he copied from obsolete regis
ters, making the roll practically useless
so far as the above number is con
cerned.
Compiled by Assembly districts the
missing addresses are as follows:
Twenty-eighth .... 260 Thirty-seventh .... SO9
Twenty-ninth 316 Thirty-eighth 806
Thirtieth 600 Thirty-ninth 761
Thirty-first 57.' Fortieth (S2
Thirty-second 457 Forty-first 420

Thirty-filth 375 i Forty-fourth
Thirty-sixth Â«&> | Forty -fifth ru
Total ltUll tUI
For performing this part of the sworn
duties of his ottice in a slipshod, per
functory and illegal manner he obtained
from the city and county treasury in
l&yT the sum of 52311 15 and in 1598 the
Bum of 52318 25. The roll as it stands
is written up by the clerks and depu
ties of the Collector, who receive no ex
tra compensation for their services,
while he, who performs absolutely no
part of the duty he is charged with by
law, puts the entire amount in his ca
pacious pocket. It is charged that dur
ing the first year of his incumbency,
to wit, the year of 1593, he got several
of his personal appointees in the office
to make oath to tho fact that they had
performed the duty set forth in the
law, but that they received none of the
compensation. Since then he has grown
very much bolder. He presents only
one demand at the treasury now, al
though the work is generally done br
others.
The meanest part of this annual com
edy, which partakes so largely of fraud
that the attention of the Board of Su
pervisors and of the Grand Jury is re
spectfully called to it, is yet to come.
As heretofore stated there are a large
number of persons exempted by the
laws of the State of California and of
the United States, but this greedy and
avaricious reformer stops at nothing
while collecting his nickels. To him all
coons look alike. He spares neither the
lame, the blind, the halt, the leprous,
nor those who are about to cross the
river, and he even demands his pound
of flesh from those who have- gone to
the undiscovered country from whose
bourne no traveler returns. And all
in the glorious cause of reform, as ex
emplified by Jimmy the Hefter, the new
Boss in the Silk Hat.
Though Mongolians are exempt by
law the Tax Collector will have his
nickel for every one of the following,
residing in the Forty-third District:
Tong Low, 1025 Dupont street; Gay
Poon, 730 Jackson street; Gun Ney, &14
Stout's alley; Geit Long, 10 Brenham
place; Fouk Wong, 12 Bartlett alley;
Fook Wong (No. 2), 706 Sacramento
street; Ho War Tong, 1111 Stockton
street; Hoy Lee, 1114 Stockton street;
Jne Lee To, 1016 Stockton street; Kirn
Lee, 936 Dupcnt street; Yon Wong Ding,
1005 Stockton street; Yon Lav Yuen, 18
Prospect place; Yon Kong, 807 Dupont
street; Chee Lee, 1114 Stockton street;
Ching Ling, 59 Spofford alley.
Next have been selected a few of
those who are beyond the statutory
limit of 45 years:
A. A. Louderback, 66 years; G. C.
Landis, 59; James Conlin, 64; A. L.
Lengfeld, 48; Wiliam Rotrosky, 46.
Here follows a list of United States
officials exempt by law:
Alfred Tunstall Spotts, Nathan Selig,
John McCabe, P. J. Donnelly, John A.
Degan and Charles S. Arms, employes
at the United States Mint; Bert Schles
inger, United States Assistant District
Attorney ; Richard P. Doolan, United
States Assistant Appraiser when roll
was made up; D. Q. Troy, United
States Postofflce; Theodore J. Wram
pelmeier, United States Revenue Of
fice.
Next is found an Associate Supreme
Justice, Charles Henry Garoutte, 46
years of age, and the following named
Superior Judges: William Raymond
Daingerfield, James C. B. Hebbard,
Carroll Cook, Rhodes Borden, 47 years
of a;re; Edward A. Belcher, Frank H.
Dunne.
To accompany the Judges there is
Walter Scott Hlnkle, Assistant District
Attorney; also an official stenographer
in the person of Francis Cornelius
Drew.
Of Justices of the Peace there are
two: Frank H. Kerrigan and John
Augustus Carroll.
For a change* there appear on the roll
the names of such well known State of
ficers as P. J. Harney and Rudolph
Herold, State Harbor Commissioners;
Alexander Tecumseh Vogelsang, State
Fish Commissioner; Andrew Jackson
Clunie, State Insurance Commissioner.
Next is found the name of no less a
personage than the Hon. James Duval
Phelan, known as the "Hefting
Mayor," and the following named Su
pervisors, constituting a quorum in the
camp in the event of a draft: Thomas
H. Hasklns, Patrick M. Delany, John
Henry Sheehan, James Edward Britt,
Edward Joseph Smith, Thomas Waral
Rivers, John C. Lackmann, and the fol
lowing clerks of the board: Henry
Clay Farquhareen, Thomas Bernard
McGlnnis, Patrick Henry McKenna,
Charles E. Parent. James C. Tomalty..
THE SAIST FRAXCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 27, 1898.
and the sergeant at arms, Henry Peter
Giannini, to preserve order.
From the School Department Mr.
Block has collected 5 cents each for the
names of Reginald F. Webster, Wil
liam A. Derham, Samuel Levy Waller,
Edward Joseph Gallagher (not of the
clan), Dr. Dennis Francis Ragan, Ed
win L. Head, Thomas A. Burns, Charles
Augustus Bantel â just a quorum to
transact business at the front.
Every department of the city govern
ment has been called upon to furnish
its quota of names, the owners of
which are exempt from military duty,
In order that the bank account of the
Tax Collector may be swelled without
expense to himself. The Police Courts,
the County Clerk's office, the Auditor's
office, the License Collector's office, the
Sheriff's office, the Coroner's office, the
State employes on the water front,
members of the Fire Department, the
Board of Healthâ in fact, every de
partment and every exempt class has
furnished names, each one of which
has netted Tax Collector Block just a
nickel apiece, the same being paid out
of the funds of the State treasury and
into the private bank account of Mr.
Block.
Actual and physical disability counts
for nothing with this greedy reformer,
law or no law. Herman Enkle, a dep
uty in Mr. Block's office, is physically
disqualified and he is 47 years of age,
yet he is on the roll. Every one in the
City Hall and many out of it know
that Louis Metzger is utterly disquali
fied, by reason of the loss of his eye
sight, yet he is on the roll from the
Forty-third Assembly District. Even
Augustus C. Widber, at present an in
voluntary guest at the Municipal Ho
tel, has not been forgotten by this
thrifty reformer, who spares neither
age nor condition.
Next we encounter a heavy contin
gent of hostlers, stable boys and
touts from the Ingleside racetrack, but
as their names are legion, and many of
them have long since left the city, it
is unnecessary to name them.
The Almshouse, dedicated by a gen
erous municipality to the use of those
who know nothing of hefting Mayors
and silk-hat bosses, has been laid un
der contribution by the Tax Collector.
At that place he has enrolled not only
Dr. William Edward Conlan, the phy
sician who has the care of the poor
unfortunates, but seven other employes
of the house as well, and he has even
laid his Shylock hands uwn the per
son of a poor blind broom-maker
named Michael Robert Emmet Coogan,
and told him to get ready for military
duty.
Not satisfied with having laid under
tribute the lame and the blind and the
halt and the leprous and the misshapen
and the sorely afflicted and the aged
and infirm, this valiant reformer in
quest of nickels has opened 'the pon
derous and marble jaws of death,
and with sacrilegious hands has torn
from their several places of sepulcher
those who were supposed to be safe
from even such "natural-born reach
ers" as Mr. Block. From the mortuary
records on file in the office of the Re
corder of this city and county appear
the following names, which also appear
on the Tax Collector's military roll:
Henry A. Hagedorn, William T. Dan
iels Dennis Crovvley, Ulysses Grant
Meehan, Thomas E. Godkin. Stephen
Truax and Thomas Sarsfield O Connell.
How many hundreds more of a like na
ture are hidden among the 46,000 names
time and a very searching investiga
tion alone will reveal.
The Collector is by law allowed five
deputies, who receive in the aggregate
the sum of 5850 per month, and such
extra assistance as the Board of Su
pervisors allow him from time to time.
When taxes are not due and payable
there is little to do. During almost
six months of the twelve the numerous
extra clerks find time hanging very
heavy upon their hands. In conse
quence whereof they are driven to do
politics in the corridors, to square a
case in the Police Courts occasionally,
to listen to arguments in the Superior
Courts and to attend the races when
racing is in season. Mr. Block of
course knows nothing of this scandal
ous state of affairs, for he does not re
main long enough in his office to ac
quaint himself with the facts. Urgent
necessity requires that he should give
at least four hours every dayâ from 11
a. m. to 3p. m.â to his Insurance busi
ness, in order to swell his bank ac
count and increase his income from the
tax office now amounting to 5500 a
month. When it is considered that in
addition to this comfortable amount,
part of it drawn illegally from the
treasury for imposing a fraudulent mil
itary roll upon the authorities, Mr.
Block has in his employ three near rel
atives who draw the additional sum of
$4200 from the municipal strong box for
doing little or nothing, it will be seen
that as a reformer he Is a howling suc
cess. The reports of the Tax Collector
on file in the office of the Auditor show
a remarkable state of affairs. Here is
a sample:
Taxes collected during July. IK9B $367 65
Taxes collected during August. IK9S 212 33
Taxes collected during September, 1898.. 323 10
Total J902 98
Salaries for 28 employes for July $3,150 00
Salaries for 28 employes for August..... 3,150 00
Salaries for 26 employes for September.. 2,950 00
Total *9.250 00
This is exclusive of the Collector's
Balary, which adds another $1000 for
three months. In other words, it has
cost the city more than $10 for every
dollar collected during the past three
months.
South Park Republicans.
The South Park Taxpayers' Republican
Club held an enthusiastic meeting Tuesday
night at 211 Third street. Speeches were
made by Bernard Cappel, indorsing
Charles L. Patton, for Mayor, and Julius
Kahn, for Congress; and Joseph M. Ellen
brook, indorsing Dr. H. E. Gedge for
School Director. As the old quarters of
the club at 211 Third street ha.ye been
found too small to accommodate the large
audiences more commodious quarters
have been engaged at 638 Folsom street,
where the next meeting will be held to
night. _

OLD SOLDIERS ARE
LOYAL TO THE FLAG
ROUSING MEETING AND CAMP
FIRE IN SARATOGA HALL.
The Democratic United States Attor
ney Says the Democratic Party
Does Not Exist Here.
The Army and Navy Republican League,
composed of veterans and Bons of veter
ans of the civil war, had a grand rally
and campflre at Saratoga Hall last night.
After the speaking, in which nearly all
the candidates on the municipal tickets
took part, several hundred invited guests
sat down to the camprire, where many
good things were eaten to keep company
with the many good things that had been
said.
Colonel T. C. Masteller of the City Cora
paign Committee called the meetinfi- to
order and introduced as chairman of the
meeting Colonel M. S. Blackburn of Le
land Stanford Camp, Army and Navy
League, which camp numbers 857 mem
bers.
Colonel Blackburn, after expressing
thanks for the honor, Introduced Colonel
Curry, chairman of the campaign com
mittee.
Colonel Curry aroused the enthusiasm
of his hearers at the very outset ot his
remarks. He began by saying that this
was a pretty good year to be an American,
and a better year to be a .Republican
American. The late crushing defeat of
Spain by the valor of American arms
was touched upon by the speaker, lhe
war was the offspring of the desire of
the people of the United States to right
a cruc-1 wrong, to rescue a country from
tyranny and to declare that the red and
yellow flag of Spain Is the emblem of
superstition, ignorance and tyranny.
Messrs. Gage and Xeff, the candidates
for Governor and Lieutenant Governor
on the Republican ticket, were mentioned
and their names were greeted with a
spontanous outburst of applause.
"We have the enemy on the run," said
the speaker, "and we are going to win.
From all over the State the most cheer
ing advices come to us, from the north,
the south, the east and the west. We, in
our turn, wish to show the interior of the
State that we all are alive and ready to
do our work, and to roll up a big round
majority for the .Republican ticket."
John B. Carson, Republican candidate
for Superior Judge, made a brief speech,
prefaced by the statement that etiquette
among the candidates for the Superior
Judgeship forbade a discussion of politi
cal Questions, but did not prohibit him
from asking his hearers to vote the
straight Republican ticket. He expressed
the hope that on election day the Re
publicans of the State of California and
of the city and county of San Francisco
would show that they admired and ap
proved of the acts of that sterling old
soldier, President McKlnley. The speaker
added that he had never held political of
fice although he had had the honor of
being a delegate to the -Republican State
convention. He was proud of that honor
and proud also of the fact that from the
time he first knew how to -discus? a politi
cal question he had been a Republican.
He had been a resident of San Francisco
since I< S 56, when he was but one year
old, and he had been continuously en
gaged in the practice of the law for twen
ty-two years. The only record that he
had was his personal reputation.
Comrade H. T. Smith followed with a
ringing, soldierly address. "In the war
with Spain," he said, "we have been
fighting for the highest type Of civilization
on earth, and on the sands of Cuba where
murder had run rife for years. 1 am
proud and we all are proud that President
McKinley was careful about going into
war. But we were so eager to pitch in
and -vwhip Spain that we criticized him
harshly.
The speaker closed by urging his hear
ers to do all in their power to support me
administration of President McKinley by
rolling up a Republican majority in this
State.
Julius Kahn, candidate for Congress
from the Fourth District, was received
with hearty cheering, and made a stirring
speech. In which he showed the necessity
of supporting the President and the ad
ministration that had gained for tne
United States so much valuable territory
in the late war with Spain.
Henry S. Foote, United States Attorney
for the Northern District of California,
an appointee of ex-President Cleveland
was introduced as the next speaker, and
was received by the veterans with a burst
of hearty applause. It was the first time
that the well-known brother of W. W.
Foote had ever addressed a Republican
meeting in harmony with its principles.
and he seemed to be proud of it, as he
ought to be. Mr. Foote said that he was
not making an address from the platform
of any political party.
"The party to which T once belongedâ
the Democratic party"â he said, "no
longer exists in the State of California
He desired, he said, to stand up for that
man who represented all that is true and
patriotic in this country Knd that man
was William McKinley, President of the
United States.
Speeches were also made by Cnarles F.
Curry, A. B. Treadwell. Henry S. Mar
tin H. N. Clement, Charles L. Patton, R.
H. Webster, William A. Deane, Judge
D. J. Murphy and others.
' The hall was crowded and the greatest
enthusiasm prevailed.

MAYOR PHELAN'S ESTIMATE OF THE
WORTH OF LOCAL DEMOCRATS
IMPORTED A RESIDENT OF MARIN COUNTY TO ASSIST HIM IN
NAMING HIS CANDIDATES.
James D. Phelan, autocrat of the San Francisco Democracy, has even a poorer opinion of the ho "^^ a "^
purity of the members of his party than was heretofore supposed. Mr. Phelan haa been generally credifefl with
having fixed the limit ofVeputable Democrats in this city at 100. that being the number he admitted to his
executive council and afterward increased their powers and allowed them to become his municipal nowaating
convention. . .
But this is a mistake. Mayor Phelan could only find ninety-nine Democrats in San Francisco on whom ne
could depend to carry out his -reat reform ideas; ha was compelled to go to Sausalito for his hundredth reform
er. Mayor Phelan, political purist and autocrat of the Democracy, not alone colonized his candidates for Super
visor, but he also "packed" his committee convention.
Michael H. Hernan is the importation from the English colony across the bay. Mr. Hernan is a worthy
citizenâ of Sausalitoâ a reputable lawyer, with an office at 402 Montgomery street, and a member of Phelan's
convention of 100 That there can be no doubt as to his residence. The Call reproduces his certificate of registra
tion issued to him by the Marin County Assessor and sworn to by himself on April 7, 1898. There is no mistak
ing Mr. Hernan's residence. The latest San Francisco directory gives it as Sausalito, and he is to-day a bona
flde resid nt of that delightful little English colony. .
And Mr. Phelan, unable to find 100 Democrats in this city of his own lofty ideas of political purity, has found
it necessary to import a Democrat from an adjacent county to take a hand in the purification pf his party In
San Francisco. Truly, Mr. Phelan's opinion of the moral worth of the great body of men he ask 3to support him
is not high.
Christopher A. Buckley, in the days when he carried the Democracy of San Francisco in his pocket, perpe
trated many outrages upon political decency, but Christopher A. Buckley never offered such an affront to his fol
lowers as has his successor, James D. Phelan. Mr. Buckley could always find hundreds of Democrats on whom he
could place every dependence to carry out his plans without going outside of the city; Mr. Phelan has so little
confidence in the Democracy that he cannot pick even 100 local party adherents on whom he can rely, but must
needs go abroad to find competent councilors.
Only ninety-nine Democrats in San Francisco whom Mayor James D. Phelan considers worthy of his con
fidence The remaining thousands are branded by this i.:odern Caesar as utterly lacking in honesty of purpose,
or as incompetents totally unfitted to be given a voice in their party affairs. But even as he brands them as
political outcasts he calls upon them to lick the hand that chides them and to continue him in power.
To Boss Phelan must be given all the doubtful credit there is in inaugurating the system of "packing"
municipal conventions with non-residents. A splendid reform system, surely, and one that speaks volumes of
the unworthy estimate that the greatest of reformers, Phelan, holds for the rank and file of his following.

Kellv on the griddle, but his audience was
not very appreciative on this matter.
Washington Dodge entered the hall
with a raft of maps, etc., and with the
assistance of a man who stood on a chair
explained alleged derelictions in the con
duct of the present Assessor. Dodge was
followed by Mayor Phelan, who spoke
briefly upon the material importance of

to bottom. _ _ _ ... _Â

Sunnyside A. B. Treadwell Club.
There were bonfires and enthusiasm "on
the bridge" in the Sunnyside district Tues
day night, when the second meeting of the
A. B. Tfeadwell Club was held. If any
Democratic candidates had been in the
vicinity It would have been enough to
make them quit and join the army for
Gage Patton, Treadwell and "sincere
reformation" in politics. A speakers"
stand had been erected on the slope near
the bridge which connects the short road
from Mission street to Ocean View, and
it was gayly decorated for the occasion
with Japanese lanterns.
John Barrett, an old-time resident of
the Sunnyside district, presided, and after
paying a graceful tribute to the wo>th of
the Republican nominees on the State
and local tickets introduced Judge A. B.
Treadwell as one of the next Police
Judges of San Francisco. The reception
of Judge Treadwell showed that he was
not unknown. He deVivered a stirring
address, urging upon his hearers to fulfill
their duty to themselves by casting their
ballots for the entire Republican ticket.
After singing by the Treadwell quartet
Arthur Attridge, candidate for Supervisor
for the Eleventh Ward, made a few re-

and appendages.

f( r ballots. He did not lift his voice
for any candidate nor indulge in eu
logy. He was there to tell why the
rmocracy of old still clings to and
votes for the tenets of Its creed and
why the Democracy of Bryan and of
Maguire does not; why the votes of

publican and why the votes of the tri
angular union of which Maguire is the
temporary leader will be used as a club
to beat down the Influences and break
up revered institutions that have dem
onstrated their soundness in a hundred
years of life.
For the purpose of his antithesis Col
onel Irish held the financial problem
paramount and argued from it. Said
ho:
The advocates of sound money are the
friends of the people who earn wages and
who produce and buy and sell the neces
saries of life.
The statement is often made that gold
iÂ«? the rich man's money, while silver is
: oor man's money. Ijhla is a country
of equal political and personal rights,
and it ha-s nÂ«vÂ«r been explained why,
under our Government, a poor man should
have poor money. As the law has but one
standard of right for all men, so for all
Is but one standard of money and
all men are entitled te the best. Espe
cially la it true of those men who are
il as poor, meaning thereby not the
indigent, but those who are still depend
ent on daily work for daily bread, and
whose toll is lightened by the prospect of
it. dependence to be won by thrift and
economy.
The monetary policy of a nation con
cerns all of its people. Its wafe-earners
have in that policy the greatest interest.
At the beginning of our Governnv-nt
this was perfectly understood by its
founders. When our people began to di
vide on party lines, under the leadership
respectively of Hamilton and Jefferson,
those two leaders and political philoso
phers were agreed upon one subject.
While they differed as to the extent to
v.-hich powr should be given to the peo
ple and were at war upon the construction
of tho Federal constitution, they both be
lieved and agTeed that money was to be
treated from a purely scientific stand
point, and that the principles governing
the selection and circulation of money, be
ing: derived from natural law. are fixed
and therefore cannot properly be made
the subject of party division and dispute.
There has arisen in California a com
bination of men, under various party
j frames, standing for an assault upon the
national standard of value. This com
bination demands the free coinage of sil
ver at the artificial ratio of 16 to 1, and
j also the issue of paper currency by the
Government, without stated limitation or
I redeemabllity. The same combination
exist?, in many States and its plans are
I urged with persistency and very remark-
I able energy. As long as it exists the ad
vocates of sound money must use pome
organization sufficiently' powerful to pro
tect our people by protecting the stan
dard of value, burihg the last adminis
tration President Cleveland, under cir
cumstances of peril and difficulty never
before surrounding a President in time of
I peace, maintained the sound standard of
value and successfully defended the na
tional honor and credit.
President McKinley has scrupulously
kept fnith with the people, and has not
only maintained the standard of value
and the public credit, but has done all
that lies in his office to promote further
legislation that will forever adjust our
financial troubles and give the country
that monetary stability which is the
foundation of all prosperity.
In our recent war of a hundred days,
men of all parties met in the ranks to ef
fect a common purpose. When it is ac
complished they divide again as to those
things they do not hold in common.
In the same sense the sound money men
combine upon a purpose of the highest
interest*, and when that issue reaches the
angle of repose, they will divide a^-ain.
What is money? It is a form of prop
erty having value and of such universal
desirability that it is exchangeable for all
other forms of property. When I speak
of money I mean a form of property that
has greater stability of value than any
other form, and is, therefore, the stand
ard of all values and the measure of the
medium of exchange. A check is not
money, nor is a draft, letter of credit or
bill of exchange or paper note. They
are titles to money only, and have no
value except as titles to that form of
property culled money. They are redeem
able In money.
Now what has Government to do with
that form of personal property called
money? It can only by statute confirm
the kind of property which is the natural
selection of the people.
Any man here who has property to sell
wants value for it. because it represents
vaJue to him. He wants that value in
such form that he can conveniently ex
change it for other values which he" may
desire. The GovernmT.t, fcr his con
venience takes Into its mints that kind of
property, brings it to a uniform quality
and puts on it a stamp which merely cer
tifies Its quality and quantity. It is then
returned to the owner who has earned
it, and pasaes from him to others who I
earn it by labor or take it in exchange
for oth^r values. Here is a $20 gold piece
from the United States Mint. The Gov
ernment eertint-s that it is $20, or 516
grains of tlif.t form of property called
gold. It passes for $20 only as long as it
I weigns 51Â»; grains. When it loses in
weight it passes for what its weight 1=
worth. Statute law has given it no value.
Its. value is derived solely from human
&fr S1 F e> T Wnen of full weight it is worth
$20 In London. Paris or St. Petersburg,
; in Stamboul. Teheran or far. Bombay.
Our fleets and our flag do -not follow it
,to make people take it. An act of Con
gres.s cannot follow it beyond our own
snores, but the natural law of value
originating in desire goes with it around
the world. Every dollar in silver and
paper issued by the laws of this republic
are made redeemable in it. and. therefore,
carry the same purchasing; power over
commodities. It is worth no more in a
rich man's purse than in a poor man's
palm. It is an honest standard and a
true measure of value, and, therefore the
national Democracy, standing for equal
ity of right and Justice to all men de
fends that standard.
I am here to-night because an advo
cate of the fusion in this State, speakinc
from this platform last week, said !t wan
the purpose of that f-ja-um to dri<e the
gold standard into the sea. He proposed
to do this by free coinage of silver at 16
to 1. and by the unlimited issue of irre
; deemable paper notes. The platforms
which propose this invoke the hallowed
j names of Jefferson and Jackson.
But Jefferson declared that thÂ© ratio
' between gold and silver is a commercial
! matter entirely, determined by their re
. spective values in me market. In the
i market to-day sixteen ounces of silver are

about thirty-two ounces of silver to bay
one ounce in gold, so the Jeffersoniah
ratio would be 32 to -.
We point to the progress of the country
under the gold standard since l&tt; to the

homes built. In no other land on earth
do as many laborers sleep under their
own roofs. Nowhere else are their tables
as bountifully spread, their children as
well educated, their rights as safe in the
keeping of the law.
The fusion platform denies the right
of the laborer to make a contract for the
payment of his wages in gold. We stand
by that right, which is his only mean* to
protect himself against that decline in the
purchasing power of his wages which les
sens the food on his table and the fire
on his hearth.
Therefore we sHbmlt to misunderstand

rights of the people are vindicated by
their motives.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 27. 1898.

"ROASTED" By
E, F, PRESTON
Plain Facts Presented
to a Big Audience.
RECORDS THAT ENTANGLE
THE "THREE-T AILED MONKEY"
PARTY'S POSITION.
F. H. Short of Fresno Speaks of HiÃ
Observations of San Francisco
Democratic Poli
tics.
Some time before the doors of Odd
Fellows' Hall -were opened last evening
a large crowd assembled to hear two
of the best-known Republican speakers
of the State. They were the Hon. E.
F. Preston and ex-Judge Frank H.
Short of Fresno. Their reception was
most pleasantly marked and the speak
ers were frequently interrupted by ap
plause.
One feature of the gathering was par
ticularly noticeable, and that was the
presence of a large number of men and
women whose gray hairs indicated that
they had witnessed many a political
campaign, yet as the addresses pro
gressed these aged listeners manifested
as much life and interest as the young
est present. Before the speakers were
introduced the Republican Girls' Quar
tet sang "America," and were rewarded
by two recalls. J. B. Stetson presided
over the gathering.
In introducing Mr. Preston the chair
man paid him the compliment of be
ing one of those workers in the causa
of the Republican party who never
seems to tire of enlightening the people
upon the principles that underlie and
form the very foundation of the organ
ization which stands for good govern
ment. Upon being presented Mr. Pres
ton called attention to the fact that he
was a little out of voice because of his
having stumped the larger part of the
State with the next Governor, Mr. Gage.
In his travels he has been surprised
that s*o many thousands are breaking
away from old traditions. The peo-ple
are alive to the issues of the day, the
issues that involve the happiness of the
homes and the prosperity of the Nation
and State. Of the old Republican party
he said it stands for one hundred cents
to one sound dollar, and no* that flimsy
currency that Herrmann, the magician,
draws from the air and drops into a
plug hat. It also stands for the Gov
ernment construction and ownership of
the Niearaguan canal and for the de
struction of the hydra-headed monster,
single tax.
Speaking of what James G f . Maguire
represents, the speaker said that this
gentleman was simply a figurehead of
a three-tailed monkey, to- wit: Popu
list, Single Tax and Free Silver.
Mr. Preston entertained the audience
by giving a few important features of
Judge Maguire's political life. For
eighteen days he worked as a journey
man blacksmith and resigned from
manual labor to enter politics, and has
never done a single days labor at the
forge since, thus spoiling a good work
man by becoming: a poor politician. The
causes of his resignation from the Su
perior bench, his desertion of the Demo
cratic party and his entrance upon the
work of propagating the principles of
single tax were also explained. Mr.
Maguire has stated, so said Mr. Pres
ton, that single tax Is not a factor in
this campaign, but facts show that the
Democratic candidate has been for
years and still is, a single taxer. He is
trying to force it down the people's
throats and his greatest effort is to con
vince the people that he is a Democrat.
The three-tailed monkey party is not
the Democratic party. Where, then,
the speaker asked, are the old, true
Democrats?
"In the ranks of the Republican
party," he explained.
Mr. Preston paid a few minutes' at
tention to Candidate Phelan and said:
"When a plug-hat boss raises his puny
voice and attacks the courts, in which
the whole people have the greatest con
fidence, I tell you that there is anarchy
in the air."
Coming back to Maguire he referred
to the Congressman's record at Wash
ington and said that the so-called "Lit
tle Giant" has had pages of Henry
George's and Herbert Spencer's works
printed in the Congressional Records
as his own speeches. These alleged
speeches were never made orally. They
were sent to the printer and later the
Records were sent to Mr. Maguire's
single-tax constituents to show them
what a great man the "Little Giant"
is. During the address the speaker took
special delight in quoting from the
speeches of Maguire, all the way from
Delaware to Metropolitan Hall. He
showed that Maguire has made so
many connecting statements and argu
ments that now he is hopelessly en
tangled in cords that he himself has
spun.
Considerable attention was paid to
Mr. Maguire's work against the rail
road and the facts presented showed
that he had nothing more to do with
the funding bill than every Democrat,
Populist and Republican in Washing
ton. Mr. Preston's closing remarks
were truly eloquent and caused a mani
festation of wild enthusiasm.
Chairman Stetson in a few happy re
marks made ex-Judge Short acquainted
with the San Francisco audience and
the man from Fresno was pleasantly
welcomed.
He made a decided hit In his opening
remarks by saying that he came up
here to study the initiative and refer
endum. He found that the initiative
consists of a committee Qf one hun
dred selected by a plug-hat boss, and
the referendum is the approval of the
candidates for office. His remarks
were full of wit, and the audience
showed its appreciation by frequent
applause. Coming down to sound ar
gument, the speaker discussed the.
funding bill, tariff, protection, money
and the anti-trust bill. He showed
that ail of these great measures and
reforms were advanced and carried out
by the Republican party. The Demo
crats, not having any of these subjects
to use as a campaign issue, have se
lected the railroad, which they assail
for the want of something better to
Jump upon. Some of the Democratic
Bpeakers have undertaken to cast slurs
upon the Republican administration, in
the matter of the late war, by discuss
ing the mistakes that have been made.
When the Americans, he said, won vic
tory after victory, the Democrats were
anxious to be credited with some share
in the hftnor.
Speaking upon the chances of success
of the Republican party, Judge Short
said that in the interior it is safe, and
victory is assured, and he hopes that
San Francisco will stand true to the
great interests of the people and the
State and show its approval of the Re
publican administration by electing the
ticitet Irom top to bottom, â¢ J
COMMISSIONER
FITZGERALD
PLEADS GUILTY
Makes Open Confes
sion of Call Charges.
HE APPEALS FOR LENIENCY
"THINGS HAVE BEEN SAID OF
ME THAT I CANNOT DENY."
Casts Reputation to the Winds and
Appeals to Friendship to Carry
Him Through to Vie-
tory.
"I thank you from my
heart for the warmth of the
greeting that you have given
me- It means friendship, and
friendship and nothing else
will elect me now.
"Things have been said to
and of me â and things are
often said of vs â that I can
not deny.
''Upon friendship and the
love that man has for man I
must rely for victory."
The Democratic Central Club held its
regular meeting last evening at Py
thian Castle.
It was an unusual meeting as meet
ings go. For a short quarter hour it
was lifted from the sin-murked sphere
of politics to the plane of Holy Church
and Edward L. Fitzgerald stepped into
the confessional.
In plain words and without qualifica
tion he pleaded guilty to the incontro
vertible charges that have been made
against him by The Call, and threw
himself upon the mercies and sympa
thies of his friends in an appeal to see
him through to victory "for the sake
of that love that man hath for man."
Mr. Fitzgerald was not announced on
the evening's programme as one of
those who were to speak. He came un
heralded and of his own volition. It
had been much the usual meeting up
to his arrival. A number of speakers
had entertained the audience. Charles
Eidelman had confessed to being a
friend of Judge Maguire and told hu
morously how he and "Tarpey" had ex
hausted all of the available supply of
steam beer in discovering that Mr. Ma
guire would carry the Thirty-first Dis
trict. And he had been followed by
others.
Fitzgerald's arrival was announced
by the warm greeting to which he later
alluded. He was escorted to the speak
ers' stand by a half dozen of the most
enthusiastic of the audience.
"I thank you from my heart," said
he, "for the warmth of the greeting
that you have given me. It means
friendship; and friendship and nothing
else will' elect me now.
'"Things have been said to and of me â
and things are often said of vs â that I
cannot deny. Upon friendship and the
love that man has for man I must rely
for victory.
"I am in a predicament that no other
nominee has found himself in. and I
want to say to you now that only such
friendship as you have shown me to
night will make my election possible."
The door of the confessional slammed
behind Mr. Fitzgerald at this point, and
for the balance of his speech he dealt
in what is technically known as flit
tering generalities. He laid bouauets
upon the altar of this new-found love
that constitutes his last resort and
tossed others at the chairman and
most of the members of the club. If
friendship was to take reputation's
place as an inducement to election
Fitzgerald did not intend to let any of
it get away.
There was nothing more of a sensa
tional nature to characterize the even
ing. Walter Gallagher and P. B. Mc-
Carty addressed the audience at length
upon the issues of the campaign and
were loudly applauded. McCarty spoke
in defense of Fitzgerald and pointed
out that his friend is sadly handi
capped in his race for honors, and he
urged that for the honor of the party
the "boys stand by and see him
through."
REPUBLICANS RALLY.
A Rousing- Reception Accorded to the
Nominees of the Popular Party.
It was a rousing rally, that at Mangel's
Hall on Twenty-fourth and Folsom
streets last night, where the Republicans
met under the auspices of the Twenty
third and Thirty-tifth Assembly districts.
The hall was, as is usual with all Repub
lican meetings, crowded to the doors long
before the hour set apart for the arrival
of the speakers. Captain George A.
Raabe, an old and stanch Republican,
had the honor of presiding at the meeting.
Without any loss of time or evidence of
a desire to hear himself speak he intro
duced Judge C. A. Low as the first speak
er of the evning. The Judge made a few
remarks and gave way to Attorney A. P.
Black, who appeared for the Republican
nominees for the Supreme bench. Mr.
Black is the escort and introducer of thii
Ladies' Quartet, as also their accompanist
on the cornet. The ladies who favor the
party nominees are: Ellen Coursen-
Roeckel, Miss Elena Roeckel, Mrs. H.
Lewis and Miss May Maybie. They were
well received and sang their campaign se
lections well. During the brief remarks by
Mr. Black, Charles L. Patton entered the
hall and was accorded a rousing recep
tion. He proceeded to the rostrum and
made one of his telling and vote-catching
short addresses; praising the Republican
platform and pointing out to his hearers
that clause that so forcibly comes home
to every man who hap to work by th-?
day. namely, that eight hours shall
constitute a day's labor and no less than
$2 shall be paid to any laborer. He said.
that if elected to the office of Mayor he
will give to the people as good a munici
pal government as is In his power to do.
He will count the people's money and see
that none of it is "hefted" away by a dis
honest Treasurer. No political boss or
corporation owns or controls him. Th_Â»
nomination for Mayor came to him with
out his seeking it. He favors the new
charter and will do all in his power to
see that it is ratified by the Legislature
whether he is elected or not.
11. N. Clement, nominee for Superior
Judge, made a short address. Hon W. F.
Fitzgerald, the present Attorney General,
met with a warm reception and delivered
one of his forcible short addresses. H:
spoke a kind word for all the nominees,
including the popular nominee for Rail
road Commissioner, C. S. Laumeister. D.
J. Murphy, nominee for District Attor
ney, has the faculty fit pieasing an audi
ence and winning its friendship before
he gets fairly started. His review of the
platform and the personnel of the nom
inees caught the voters to a certainty.
The everywhere popular Henry S. Martin
brought the house down, as the saying
goes, on his appearance in the body of
the hall. His reception on the platform
was one that any citizen might well feel
proud of. If men vote as they cheer,
Henry Martin will be the next Sheriff. A.
C Berthler, nominee for Recorder, has
no occasion to be jealous of any of his
companions m the race for office, as h
certainly met with a warm welcome from
the voters of the Mission. His address
was short and to the point.

REPUDIATES
THE PRINCIPLES
OF FUSION
H. L. Loucks Returns
to Republicanism.
WAS A PROMINENT POPULIST
REFERS TO DEMOCRATS AS
"HUNGRY WOLVES."
Opinions of a Man Who Is Well
Known and Highly Respected
Throughout the United
States.
Nearly every Populist in California
knows or has heard of Hon. H. L.
Loucks of South Dakota. He was the
father of the Populist party in that
State, and for many years, through
poverty and abuse and universal de
nunciation, he stood by the principles
of the Omaha platform, and was
chairman of the National Convention
at Omaha, July 4, 1892. The Democrats
were unfitted to appreciate so great and
noble a nature, and so they used their
surplus energies in crushing him. They
have driven him back into his old
party He recently addressed a letter
to a Republican county convention, in
his home county, of which the following
is the substance:
After discussing the peculiar and un
usual political situation confronting the
voters and rehearsing the formation and
srrowth of the Populist party, Mr. Loucks
htttprlv denounced the Democratic party
and the system of fusion. The Populist
i>arty has become, he said, the victim of
place seeking by hungry Democratic
wolves Democrats had enacted a higher
tariff than the McKinley law. and had
given the country the existing gold pol
icy It was incapable of progress. In
the South it had debauched the ballot box
and in the North it seduced the reform
voters. The fusion party in South Da
kota had passed under the control of the
most perfect machine in the Northwest.
All other machines were as nothing. The
true midroaders could not be traded off
for office.
Of State issues Mr. Loucks said: "As
for free coinage of silver, it will be very
embarrassing to discuss it, and the fu
sionist speaker who attempts it at this
time has my sympathy.
"I have not a principle in common with
the Democratic party, as at present con
stituted " declared the writer, "and I
cannot follow my party into the unholy
union which has been consummated.
Prior to 1890 I claimed to be a Lincoln
Republican. I did not leave you because :
of any personal grievance or disappoint
ment 1 was not an office seeker, and
several times declined preferment offered
me. I have not the courage to build up
a second party, now that my original i
one has turned from Its course and been !
perverted to Democratic use; to remain
neutral is to be called an assistant Re
publican and to have my motives Im
pugned, which has been repeatedly done
by the chief organ of the Democratic
party of this State. I desire, therefore,
to align myself in this campaign with
the Republican party. The remedy for ;
private monopoly is public monopoly. I
believe in the protection of American in
dustries and Interests; -m free ballot and
fair count, and in the extension of Ameri
can interests and territory. Old Glory
when once raised must not be lowered.
1 cannot be charged with selfish motives.
When I left your party it had a major
ity in this State of 30,000; it is now in the
minority. I speak for myself only, but
I know there are several thousand of us
who will go with you."

UNTAMED DOG-CATCHERS.
THERE may be raised a question as to what
shall be done with the dog-catcher. Clearly
this creature is more dangerous to the commun
thc canine he pursues. Yet he is not only
:ited at large without muzzle or license tag, but
to bear weapons wherewith to subdue the decent citi
zen, and a star of anthdrity to intimidate such as do
not venture near enough to be struck with a club.
He has shown himself to be a nuisance, a menace
and a disagreeable spectacle.
Undoubtedly the instincts of a gentleman would
lead him to adopt some other calling than that of
nabbing dogs in a net. However, if a decent person
were to undertake the task he would refrain from
brutality, from insulting and assaulting any who
might stand on their rights. When a citizen owns a
dog and has paid the required fee for the privilege,
and then notes the catcher calmly disregarding the
presence of the tag and taking the dog as if it had
been a homeless and unloved mongrel, that citizen is
going to fight. He will not only put up as good a
fight as his physical capacity permits, but he will find
that he has the approval of conscience, of the ob
servers, probably of the courts â of everything and
everybody save the flea-bitten catchers themselves.
The dog-catcher is a necessary evil, but there is no
excuse for the aggravated form of him. H'* moral
average is too low. He seems to be a rumar, a cow
ard and a thief. Surely he could lay aside these
characteristics, or at least modify them, and still be
capable of performing the duties of his degraded
office.
TOO MUCH BLAINE.
JAMES G. BLAINE is a striking illustration of
the degeneracy which may be manifest in the
son of a distinguished sire. He seems to have
the faculty of attracting attention through the spec
tacular display of bad qualities. If he has good quali
ties, they havcfeeen kept in careful concealment. His
appointment to the army was a mistake, which the
army had a right to resent. He had been, as a
civilian, an abject failure, and there was no reason to
suppose that in military life he would be different.
The expected has happened, as occasionally it will,
and Blame goes out of the army, and, it is to be
hoped, into the obscurity which would best become
him.
The history of the Blame family is a sad one. The
father died when his heart had been torn by dis
appointment. The two sons in whom he had con
fidence and paternal pride, on whom he had learned
to lean, preceded him to the grave. There was left
James G. Blame Jr. Possibly the possession of an
honored name would have 'stimulated some men to
earnest endeavor, but not so with this young sprig.
He married a woman too good for him, neglected
and deserted her. He essayed newspaper life, and
demonstrated that all he had to commend him was the
repute of his father. Finally he received an appoint
ment which brought him to this city. Here he dis
graced himself. In the islands he acted the part of a
drunken boor, and he came back with fresh no
toriety.
Now the telegraph states that he will be dismissed
from the service. If the good of the service is being
considered, there seems no other course.
There could be no finer weather than San Fran
cisco is having. Most of the recent days have been
ideal Indian summer. The fact is peculiarly interest
ing when it is considered that the Middle West is
trying to dig itself out of the snow and wondering
whether or not it has been blown into the next
county.
Occasionally a Judge who has passed sentence on a
malefactor hears himself denounced and his character
painted in unlovely terms by the condemned. Hearst
has had sentence passed upon himself, and seems to
be even'as other criminals.
Spain clainjs the right to sell the cannon which she
has no longer the right to fire. Possibly a few can
non over which she does not exercise dominion will
be necessary in convincing her of error.
"Wholly smoke!" exclaimed an observant citizen,
noting the circulation of the Examiner through the
chimney of the garbage crematory-
Chaplain Mclntyre's sentence has been approved.
The gentleman talked himself out of the navy, but he
had lots of fun while doing it.
Expressed in the vulgar and yet lucid language of
the street, France seems to have come off the perch.
EXPOSURE OF HEfIRST NECESSARY.
THE CALL has met and fulfilled the duty of ex
pusing two pretenders. The first was the so
ciety pretender, Williams. The second was the
journalistic pretender, Hearst.
The newspaper situation in this city has been long
clouded and corrupted by Hearst. Legitimate jour
nalism has suffered by it, and the educating function
of the press, by which a sound public opinion is
guided, has been vastly injured by the frauds, fakes
aiid offenses of this pretender, Hearst.
We have now made his exposure complete. His
agreement to cease unfair and malicious treatment of
a corporation for a money consideration is now public
property. The fact that, having sold himself, he sat
down with Mr. Herrin and argued and insisted that
he had stayed bought; the ietter of his business man
ager complaining that the corporation had revealed
the secret agreement for the sale of Hearst to Irving
M. Scott, have been published. The case is complete.
If Hearst desire to judicially test that contract we
have offered him an open way. If he will bring suit
upon it against the Southern Pacific Railroad The
Call will pay any judgment he gets for the unpaid
balance of $8000.
It was treated ty him and the First National Bank
as a negotiable contract. It has not lost its ne
gotiable character. We enlarge our offer. If he will
assign it to The Call we will bring suit on it, and
bring the contract into court and secure a judicial
decision upon it. If it were a simple contract for ad
vertising, judgment upon it will demonstrate that fact
and Hearst will be vindicated.
The business and reading public now understand
fully that in no other way than by suit for the balance
due can Hearst prove that he did not agree to sell
his silence to the corporation for thirty months for
the sum of $30,000.
His fury and abuse will not distract attention from
this simple solution.
But Hearst will not bring suit for the balance due
him. He will stand pilloried and convicted with the
broken time-lock on his blackguardism in full view.
Society is safer from pretenders that Williams
was exposed in the nick of time. Business men are
safer that Hearst has been stripped of his pretenses
and proved a blackmailer. The people are benefited,
for their confidence in legitimate newspaper criti
cism is restored. They may feel now that an expo
sure of wrongdoing by corporations, individuals and
public officers is legitimate and honest, and not a
means by which blackmail can be extorted.
Exposure of Hearst's methods deters his journal
istic imitators, because intended victims of blackmail
know that The Call will defend them against it. Cor
porations will wr.lk more uprightly, for they cannot
silence legitimate criticism by purchase, and their
proper conduct will get the credit to which propriety
i? entitled, whether manifested by a corporation or an
individual.
The air has been cleared and will be further puri
fied when Hearst is driven out of the State, which is
just now too hot to hold him.
THE CONTEST IN THE FOURTH-
WHILE the Fourth Congressional District has
in times past been regarded as a Democratic
stronghold, there are ample reasons for be
lieving it will be redeemed this year, and that its
voters will send to Washington that stanch Repub
lican, Julius Kahn, to uphold the administration and
the great policies of protection and sound money on
which the prosperity of the country depends.
In that district, as everywhere else, Democracy has
been learning a good deal since the last election. The
gold men who bolted the Bryan movement are more
determined than ever to rid their party of the fiat
money cranks, and the great mass of Democratic
workingmen, seeing the benefits accruing to them
selves from the Republican tariff, are not likely to
vote for a man who would, if he could, break down
the tariff as well as the gold standard.
The Republicans of the district, on the other hand,
were never more united or more resolute than now.
They are aware they have the backing of conserva
tive Democrats and independents, and feel that they
are making a winning fight. All their meetings in
the district have been well attended, and the polling
of the full party vote is assured on election day.
Favorable as are the conditions in the district to
Republican success, it is not upon those conditions
only the party relies for success. The personality of
the candidate is a potent factor in the canvass. No
better man could have been chosen for the contest.
He has youth, energy, eloquence, earnestness, a
large experience in politics, a proven capacity for
legislative work, and is well fitted in every way to
carry to victory the Republican standard in a field
where Democracy has for a long time been supreme.
Julius Kahn was raised in Calaveras County, and at
the age of eight years came to this city, where he re
ceived his education in the public schools, being a
graduate of the Boys' High School in the class of
1878. In 1892 he was elected to the State Legisla
ture, and the election was a striking proof of his per
sonal force and popularity, as in that year but one
other Republican legislative candidate was elected
from this city.
The legislative record of Mr. Kahn shows him to
have been a hard-working, faithful, honest and effi
cient representative of the people. Even his political
opponents conceded, after a full review of the session,
that his services had been of great value to the city
and to the State. Among the bills with whose pas
sage he was prominently identified were those giving
residents of Richmond District drainage for their
sewer system; repealing the street extension com
mission, whereby the property-owners of the Potrero
and the Mission were saved thousands of dollars;
providing the naval battalion their first State appro
priation; requiring that in all street railway franchises
a provision be made giving letter-carriers the right to
ride free while in the discharge of their duties; ap
propriating $250,000 for the erection of the buildings
of the affiliated colleges, and requiring the sale of
public franchises to the highest bidder.
In his private life Mr. Kahn has proven his devo
tion to the general welfare as well as in his official
career. He is thoroughly representative of the pro
gressive element of the State. He can be counted on
at Washington to advance every interest of Califor
nia, and the people of the Fourth District will have
good reason to be proud of their Representative in
Congress.
Mrs. Botkin has more reason to congratulate her
self. She would not have been Queen of the Tanks
and Empress of all the Hoboes if she had been taken
back to Delaware.
If Colonel Berry will take a word of friendly ad
vice he will let go that Red Cross money, and do his
talking about it after he has a receipt.
If Aguinaldo really wants to visit Paris he should
wait for the exposition of 1000 and go as an exhibit.
Carpet-bagging and sandbagging need elimination
from politics.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 27. 1898.
DEACON FITCH'S County Committee have is
sued a campaign paper called The Non-
Partisan, which, although bound to have only
a brief career, bids fair to become a. feature in the
journalism of San Francisco. The Deacon says his
sheet is to be devoted to "good government,' and
that it will appear three times before election day,
each issue being placed in the hands of every voter.
The Deacon has procured a list of the registered
voters from Registrar Biggy, and he will include
every name therein among his "constant readers" and
'"old subscribers."
The first issue of The Non-Partisan has a saluta
tory, editorials on the platform and the dollar limit,
an article with the ominous head, "Warning."' which
declares that unless the people look sharp the bosses,
boodlers and push will overwhelm them, and a long
list of the biographies of the Non-Partisan candi
dates.
There are also a few flip-flap editorial notes, writ
ten in the Deacon's best style, none of which are of
more than passing interest; but nowhere in his
paper does Mr. Fitch make any reference to the fact
that he and his party have become a tail to Mayor
Phelan's kite. In fact, the entire subject of Demo
cratic politics is ignored.
When he conducted the late lamented Bulletin the
Deacon was celebrated in controversy for the adroit
ness with which he closed up when cornered. He
was, in fact, throughout his newspaper career, known
in connection with certain subjects as the journalistic
oyster. Evidently he has adopted this policy in his
new venture. The people are panting to know the
details of the bargain by which the Non-Partisar.s
were sold to the Phelan machine. Why will not
Deacon Fitch discuss the subject? He can now en
tertain no fear of having his remarks garbled by an
inattentive or hostile reporter. He can make his ex
planation over his own signature in his own paper.
A review of the list of candidates published by
Deacon Fitch and indorsed by his paper shows that
out of fifty-three nominees only sixteen are Republi
cans. How could this partiality in favor of Demo
crats have been shown in a convention composed al
most entirely of Republicans, representing a voting
strength altogether Republican, unless a rank politi
cal bargain had been consummated? Deacon Fitch's
ticket contains but one Republican candidate for a
patronage office. The Sheriff, County Clerk. Super
intendent of Streets and the Board of Supervisors
have all been given by the Non-Partisans to the Dem
ocrats.
Is Deacon Fitch aware of the fact that every- Dem
ocrat on his ticket has promised to give his patronage
to Phelan, Fay, Popper, McNab and Braunhart, or
what Phelan calls the "organization"? Mr. Fitch is
an experienced political boss and he knows what
this means. Why will he not discuss it in the next
issue of The Non-Partisan? Does he think that in
aiding to build up a political machine with Phelan as
boss he is contributing to the cause of "good
government"?
These are important questions, and Mr. Fitch's
Non-Partisan constituents, before they are delivered
to the Phelan machine, want them answered.
WHERE THE BRITISH BEAT US.
A STRANGE contrast exists between the apathy
on the part of the American Government
toward merchant marine interests and the ac
tivity and energy displayed by the -British in building
up the merchant marine of their country. It seems
as if the British believe they can never do too much
to retain control of the sea in war and in commerce,
for they are lavish in their expenditures for the ad
vancement of both their navy and their trade ship
piny.
The present Parliament not only provided immense
sums for warships, but adopted a measure offering a
subsidy to ship-owners to take boys on their vessels
and train them for able seamen. It is stated that
this course was taken because the decline in the num
ber of sailors of British birth has of late years be
come serious. In the five years between 1891 and 1896
the number of native-born sailors on British ships de
creased 15 per cent, while the number of foreign-born
sailors increased 8 per cent.
It is estimated by the advocates of the bill that if
only half the number of ships that might take boys
for training will do so the result will be to add 8000
men annually to the merchant service, and incident
ally to the naval reserve force of the empire. Great
Britain will thus at a comparatively small outlay in
the way of subsidies convert a considerable part of her
merchant fleet into training schools from which
skilled seamen will graduate to man the commercial
shipping or the war vessels of the nation, according
to the needs of the time.
While the British are thus making every effort to
maintain a commerce which is almost at a standstill,
the United States, with a rapidly expanding foreign
trade, is doing nothing in the way of legislation to
provide a merchant marine for carrying it on. We
are paying a heavy tribute to foreign ship-owners and
are thus losing annually far greater sums than would
be required to advance both our merchant marine and
our ship-building industry.
There is a growing demand for American goods in
Europe, in South America and in Australia, and a
vast field for commerce awaits us in the Orient. The
great nations of Europe are alert and energetic in
their efforts to obtain the whole of this trade. They
understand the value of an adequate merchant marine
to all the industries of a people. They know it is use
less to manufacture goods unless some means is pro
vided for carrying them to the markets where they
can be sold. Moreover, they desire that the ships
which carry their goods shall fly their flag and be
manned by their sailors.
Surely with such rivals in the field it is time for
Congress to enact laws that will give the American
a chance to compete on equal terms with them for the
markets of the world.
So long as the Chinese highbinders intent upon
killing each other shoot straight there will be no par
ticular objection. They are not half so dangerous to
the community as the Democratic spell-binders.
If Spain did not so continually lose sight of the
fact that in the recent war she had the experience of
getting licked, there would be fewer hitches in the
negotiations for peace.
With Maguire depending on anarchist votes and
Henley looking to Mexican support, the outlook of
the two cannot be said to be bright.
Perhaps all these soldiers about to start for Manila
are getting married as a delicate compliment to Gen
eral Merritt^ good taste.
Rea's followers seem to be manifesting many of the
characteristics of rats who find themselves on a sink
ing ship.
Perhaps it would be well for France to employ some
of the sympathy expended on Spain for use right at
home.
PHELAN'S POLITICAL TfILE.
theTplug hat.
Editor San Francisco Call: Our institutions are all calculated or party
government. The men who founded the republic had been raised on tj
party system. Their experience showed that in e? ery nation there mvj .t be
differences of opinion. On the lines of these opinions the cttliena div We into
political parties. One party acts as a check on the other. Their mutual em
ulation tends to the pubiic weal. , . .. n ,_j|j g * oo
It is true that political orators have a of denouncing the candidates
of the other party as traitors who are unworthy to enjoy the Protection of
the flag. Such flamboyant declaration, are quite in order, and they * no
harm because no one takes any stock in them. The plain citizen beliefs
in his heart that the Republican and the Democrat and the Populist are
equally citizens of this country-equally entitled to the protection of the
was the belief of the fathers of the republic. They did not wish to
repeat here the experiment so disastrously tried in other lands, where a dis
pute between parties meant the arbitrament of the sword and where the vic
tory of one side meant the exile or extinction of the other They w.shdal
parties to live under the law. They wished .victory to be decided solelj
by the free votes of a free people, and they wished every man to 1 ia% c ac
cess to the ballot box so that his vote might have its own weight in de
ciding the fortunes of the battle.
In the same way there are differences between the members of tpe va
rious parties. One group favors one man or one policy another labors an
other man or another policy. These groups make up the party and no one
group has the right to cast out all the other groups and say, I alone am
the party." If any man does not wish to act with others of the same party
then that man
SHOULD GO AND FORM A PARTY FOR HIMSELF.
He does not belong under the American system to a party, because
a party means the mutual tolerance of differing groups. He is the cuckoo s
eg? laid in the strange bird's nest. As the intruder grows to power he casts
be rightful occupiers to make room for himself. Now the plain citizen,
like you and me, cares very little for one boss or another. All bosses look
alike to us. Our chief concern is that no boss can get too much power and
that is why we believe in parties and in groups within parties. We cannot
see why Rainey has not as much right in the Democratic party as Phelan
or Lanigan or Graney or Buckley or the rest of them. It seems to us it
rests entirely with the members of the party. Moreover, we cannot see for
the life of us why Rainey should read Phelan out of the party or Phelan
Rainey. They are both leaders of groups. One group may be larger than
the other, or may occupy a better position. But both groups belong to the
party. When Republicans win in an election they do not declare the Dem
ocrats outside the protection of American law. When one group in a party
triumphs it has no right to cast the other group into the outer darkness.
Of course the boss who is aiming at the complete control of the party
will not subscribe to this doctrine. But lam arguing now not as the boss,
but as the plain citizen arguesâ as you and I believe that things should be.
We are all the time looking to our own interest and our own interest em
phatically iics with the multitude of small bosses ever against the big boss
that rules them all.
BUT MR. PHELAN DOES NOT BELIEVE
In a patty made up of groups. Hia policy is the policy of the politicians of
ancient Rome in the days of its decline. When one party triumphed over
the other there was a proscription. The faction on top published a list of
the leaders of the faction underneath and every one on that li9t might be
slain at sight. Mr. Phelan hardly ever makes a speech that he does not trot
out Pericles or Cicero or some other ward heeler of Rome or Greece. No
doubt he has studied their methods closely and he admires their thorough
ness. He will tolerate no groups or factions under him. His faction must be
the Democratic party and every faction that will not bow down before his
statue "f brass must go incontinently into the fiery furnace. His plug hat
must shelter the whole Democratic party and on the rim of it there is writ
in large letters, "Outslde^of this there is no salvation."
This is a state of affairs which the Democratic party should consider
as closely as the plain citizen. Shall all the avenues to promotion in that
party be
BLOCKED IN FUTURE BY THE PHELAN TURNSTILE.
Is the Democracy of San Francisco to be another Phelan building in
which no one can obtain a room without paying rent to Mr. Phelan or to
Deacon McElroy, his agent, or to Mr. Charles Fay?
But the plain citizen can well leave the Democrats to attend to their
own affairs. He minds his business and he lets others mind theirs His
duty now is to survey the situation calmly and see how his interests are
affected by the coming election. He has nothing to hope from one party
or the other, but he has much to fear. Above all things he has to fear the
boss who may become so strong as to control all the other bosses You
and I have learned to beware of vaulting ambition. You and I, plain citi
zens that we are, are satisfied with the devices employed by our forefathers
to prevent the power of the people from being used against the people We
are committed to the principle of the division of power. Looking for our
suffrages is a man -who comes to us as the open and avowed opponent of
that principle. Mr. Phelan says, "Make me a Mayor; a Mayor not in name
but in reality. Give me officials who will support my policy; that is to say
Supervisors who will register my decrees; Judges who will deliver my ludtr
ments; Auditors who will throw open the doors of the city treasury at nfv
approach; Assessors who will, as I consider just, tax the property of thi
citizens, and incidentally my own not inconsiderable holdingsâ eive m* =
Sheriff, County Clerk, Superintendent of Streets, School Directorsâ blvp mt
everything and I will give you a good government." s me
THE PLAIN CITIZEN GASPS IN ASTONISHMENT
At such a proposal. Were Mr. Phelan an angrel from heaven we mi^t x
gin to consider well whether he might be trusted with such power Rm Z
Phelan is by no means an angel, at least not that kind of an ane^l v i
and I know a thing or two. The plain citizen hears plain talk nl I 2
asain about prominent personages. You and I know that the rran whl a
not respect the moral law will not rtspect the civil law as loS? Â»? h* a
disrespect it with impunity. We have been trained to trust no msn JÂ£Â£
euch power. Perhaps we may have our reasons for refusing to tnÂ£t W
Phelan least of all. Yours truly, A PLAIN CITIZEN

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VAL.LEJO, Oct. 26.â The cheering of
Butte County Republicans had hardly
subsided when Henry T. Gage rose to
board the 4 a. m. train to-day from
Orovllle to Vallejo, via San Francisco.
The Oroville demonstration, one of the
greatest ever held in Northern Cali
fornia, closed the standard-bearer's
tour of the Sacramento Valley.
The series of meetings beginning at
Sacramento and continuing at Au
burn, Nevada City, Grass Valley,
"Woodland, Redding and Red Bluff and
ending at Oroville, enlisted the enthu-
piasm of the masses. Mr. Gage's able
exposition of the dangers of the single
tax produced a profound impression
among the home-owning and home
respecting people of the valley and
mountains. The scheme which threat
ens to place all the burdens of taxa
tion on land alone is now accepted as
the vital issue of the campaign, heute
the public manifests great interest in
the discussion of the subject.
Apart from the mass meetings, *M>.
Gage during his tour had the pleasure
of meeting and 6haking hand.s with
thousands of his fellow-citizens. In
every place, Willows excepted, he re
ceived assurances that old-line Demo
crats, Populists and Silver Republicans
had broken away from the fusion pro
gramme and resolved to give their sup
port in this campaign to Gage and
Neff. Everywhere Mr. Gage was rec
ognized as the candidate of the people,
one who had never sought public office
and never drawn a dollar from the
public treasury.
Mr. Gage was met at Vallejo Junc
tion this evening by A. L. Hatheway,
chairman of the Republican County
Committee, G. J. Campbell and H. F.
Stahl of the Vallejo Morning News.
The candidate was accorded a hearty
welconie. The trip from the Junction
to North Vallejo was spent very plea
santly, Mr. Gage meeting many who
piedged him their friendship and ex
pressed their intention of casting a
vote for him on the Bth of November.
At North Vallejo Mr. Gage was met
by other members of the County Com
mittee and escorted to the Bernard
House parlors. After a short rest he
was escorted to Armory Hall by two
bands and a long procession of enthu
siastic citizens. A salute of twenty
one guns was fired by Harry Wilson
in honor of Mr. Gage and Victor Met
calf, while bonfires were burning on al
most every corner in town.
"When the distinguished gentleman
arrived at Armory Hall he was greeted
with a most enthusiastic ovation;
cheer upon cheer rent the hall and it
was some minutes before it subsided.
After a few remarks by George J.
Campbell, Mr. Gage proceeded with his
speech, which was listened to atten
tively. He thanked the citizens of
Vallejo. on behalf of the Republican
for the reception tendered him
and stated that it was a forerunner of
success for the State, county and leg
islative ticket. The reasons, he said,
were numerous, for the feeling pos-
Bessed by the people was that there was
danger in the fusion movement and
that many liberties would be cut off.
The Republican party was in favor of
law and order, while the Democratic
party was not. The fusion or Demo
cratic party denied the right of the
land owned to the soil which he has
paid for. This fusion party would
block the progress of the State for
years to come. It believes in free
trade, ruin of the shipbuilders of Cali
fornia and also the mechanic; it is al
lied to the anarchistic doctrine.
O'ntinuing, Mr. Gage devoted con
siderable attention to the railroad is
sue, in which he said that Maguire en
deavored to make it a prominent factor
of the campaign, and showed in a
plain and concise manner that the
nominee on the Democratic ticket was
trying to mislead the voting people.
Mr. Magruire, he said, dare not combat
his theories, and the railroad question
in this campaign was only a subter
fuge. He furthermore called attention
to the fact that Maguire, if he so de
sired, while in Congress, could by ob
n have prevented the passage of
the funding bill. He scored many teU
ing points against Maguire, all of
which were greeted with tremendous
applause.
Mr. Gagre showed that he never was
employed by the railroad and that cor
poration had no affection for him in the
least. "No railroad company has paid
me a fee in my life." said Mr. Gage,
"but I have received a great deal of
their money as judgment in damage
cases brought against them. Does that
look as though the railroad company
likes me? Do justice by me and that
Is all I ask."
He also showed in a capable manner
Mr. Magulre's un-American stand in
the recent war. The speaker was so
entertaining that the audience was dis
inclined to part with him. After the
meeting a reception was tendered the
visiting speakers at the Bernard House
parlors. The Benicia Glee Club, con
sisting of Messrs. Gise, Rueger, Rulof
son and Stanley, rendered several cam
paign songs.
Victor Metcalf. the Republican nomi
nee for Congress, followed Mr. Gage in
a stirring speech. In which he spoke ex
tensively on the silver question, and
also advocated the building .of a bat
tleship at the Mare Island Navy Yard.
"Here is the place to uuild such a ves
sel," said the speaker. "You have all
the facilities that are necessary for an
undertaking of that nature and rank
as the best mechanics in the world."
His remarks were greeted with im
mense applause.
SENATOR WHITE TALKS
FOR THE FUSION TICKET
Makes a Speech at Stockton Which
Fails to Enthuse a Small
Audience.
STOCKTON, Oct. 2C.-Senator White
spoke at Agricultural Pavilion this even
ing in behalf of the fusion ticket. Frank
D. Nicol acted as chairman of the meet-
Ing. White, who is always a favorite
with Democrats here, must hayÂ» detected
the total absence of enthusiasm among
his auditors. The tenor of his address
eeemed to indicate that he felt he was on
the defensive. The audience was not
large, and the distinguished speaker failed
to arouse any demonstration of approval
for his assertions. He denounced the
War Department, and claimed the army
scandals were directly due to Republi
can Incompetence. He declared that the
war revenue bill put burdens on the poor;
that beer was the poor man's drink and
should not have beea subjected to addi
tional tax. He also said that the popular
bond Issue was a fake, as syndicates got
agents to buy It up for them.
The Senator declared that the conven
tion which nominated Gage was not a
Republican convention, but a Southern
Pacific gathering. He had nothing against
Gage, but thought Maguire was a friend
of the people and they should give him
a vote of approval at the coming elec
tion. The speaker claimed that the sin
gle tax was not an issue, for it was not
in the platform, but in the next minute
he claimed that Maguire was entitled to
support on his own personal merits.
White was not at his best, as he was
suffering from a severe cold. Much com
ment is made at the failure of Governor
Budd to attend any of the Democratic
demonstrations in his home city.
MARIN REPUBLICANS
MEET AT SAN RAFAEL
Torchlight Procession Followed by
Addresses From Eloquent
Speakers.
SAN RAFAEL, Oct. 26.â The largest Re
publican mass meeting ever held in
Marin County was addressed by Hon. W.
R. Davis of Oakland and General John
H. Dickinson of Sausalito. Intense en
thusiasm prevailed, showing that both
speakers had the perfect sympathy of
their auditors. At 7:45 p. m. a special
train arrived from Sausalito, with a dele
gation of 100 from that town and seventy
live from Larkspur, all carrying torches,
tin horns and banners. Preceded by the
Richardson brass band of Sausalito, fol
lowed by the San Rafael band, the pro
cession marched to the San Rafael opera
house.
General Dickinson was introduced as
chairman by W. S. Dreypolcher, who
called the meeting to order. He spoke
at length on campaign issues and pro
phesied a sweeping Republican victory.
Mr. Davis followed in an eloquent ad
dress, portraying the dangers of Ma
guireisni and the single tax doctrine and
denouncing yie attempt to cloud ihe real
issues by the false statement that Gage
is a Southern Pacific hireling. Mr. Davis
was roundly applauded during the whole
of his convincing argument. Intermis
sions between speeches were filled in with
campaign songs by the Knickerbocker
male quartet. +
The meeting broke up with three deaf
ening cheers for Gage and the Republican
party.

utation of being the banner Republican

ODD FELLOWS' JUBILEE.
Permanent Organization Effected to
Prepare a Grand Celebration in
1899.
Last night there were In Eureka Hall
of the Odd Fellows' building the represen
tatives of 275 subordinate and Rebekah
lodges and encampments of the Independ
ent Order of Odd Fellows to take action
in the matter of a grand celebration In
1899 of the fiftieth anniversary of the in- j
siitution of California Lodge Xo. 1 of this j
State.
The meeting was called by the parent |
lodge, and was presided over by H. S.
Jones, who briefly explained the purposes
of the assemblage. Then followed a free I
discussion of the proposition to have a j
golden jubilee, and it was unanimously
! decided that there should be one.
The date of the institution of the parent
lodge was September 9, 1649, and it was
suggested that that would "be the proper
date for the jubilee; but there was a pro
tracted discussion on that point, in which

Breuck, Grand Secretary Shaw, Fast
Grand Patriarch Erlewlne, W. A. S.
Nicholson, Past Grand J. H. Simpson, I
Mrs Dell Savage (grand president of trie ;
Rebekahs), Mrs. M. E. Donoho (the grand
secretary) and others took part. Some
were opposed to the 9th of September, as
that was particularly Native Sons and
Pioneers' day. while others thought that
the Odd Fellows could make a success of
that day, irrespective of other organiza- ;
tions. It was linally decided to allow the !
date to be fixed at a future time.
The following, named by a special com
mittee, were chosen as the permanent of
ficers 1 H. S. Jones, President; Karl C
Brt-uc'k, grand master; J. W. Harris,
grand Patriarch; Mrs. Dell Savage, grand
president of the Rebekahs. and General j
C. C. Sherman, vice-presidents; U. S. G. i
Clifford, secretary, and George T. Shaw,
treasurer.
The following were elected a
committee of arrangements in con
junction with the permanent offi
cers: J. S. Robinette, Sacramento; F.
A. Week, Eureka; H. D. Richardson, Val- j
lejo - Mary E. Donoho, San Francisco; C. j

journment was taken, the convention to
be called again within sixty days.

George Huber, a Baker of Auburn,
Attempts to Commit Suicide.
George Huber, a baker of Auburn,
Placer County, yesterday afternoon at
tempted to commit suicide in the Ahlborn
House, on Grant avenue, by inhaling il-
luminating gas.
About two weeks ago Huber arrived In
this city and rented a room in the house
where he attempted to end his life.
Shortly after 4 o'clock yesterday after
noon one of the clerks in the house, who
was passing Huber's room, detected the
odor of escaping gas. Failing to arouse
, the occupant he forced an entrance and
: discovered Huber lying on the bed in an
unconscious condition. He had turned on
ihe gas after plugging the keyhole, but
falleu to close the transom.
Huber was at once removed to the Re
ceiving Hoaiptal. where he was treated by
Drs. Weil and Binne. It is believed he
will recover.
Huber would give no reason for his
rash act other than that he was tired
of life and wanted to die. He has a
wife and three children living at Auburn,
who have been informed of his attempted
suicide.

ADDRESSES TWO MEETINGS
REITERATES HIS CHARGES
AGAINST THE RAILROAD.
Talks About the Funding Bill Fight
in Congress and Denies Some
of Mr. Gage's State
ments.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WOODLAND, Oct. 26.â The reception
to-day to James G. Maguire was the
greatest political demonstration ever
seen In Woodland. The Judge arrived
from Colusa at 2 o'clock, accompanied
by E. L. Hutchison and H. A. McCra
ney. J. A. Jones came from the south
and D. A. Ostrom from Marysvllle. A
band and an immense crowd of people
received them. Great cheering fol
lowed Maguire's introduction to the
crowd. Judge Maguire and party
walked to the hotel, escorted by seve
ral hundred citizens. They appea/ed
on the hotel balcony and received an
ovation.
The main meeting in the evening was
held in the opera-house. Seats were
provided to accommodate 1200 persons.
Several hundred failed to get inside.
An overflow meeting was organized and
addressed by Messrs. Jones, Hutchison,
Ostrom. G. C. Martin and Judge Ma
guire. J. I. McConnell presided in the
opera-house, and there were 225 vice
presidents on the stape. Judge Ma
guire was the first speaker. C. W.
Thomas called the meeting to order
with an anvil and hammer, and Chair
man McConnell made a brief and ap
propriate speech. Mrs. Delia Prior-
Pierce and Miss Minnie Prior then sang
the "Star Spangled Banner," and for
an encore sang "Dixie."
Judge Maguire spoke for two hours.
He was given the closest attention and
was frequently and generously ap
plauded. His address was along the
same lines as those delivered elsewhere,
except he was more emphatic in giv
ing evidence that the corporations are
fighting his election. He called atten
tion to the fact that M. M. Estee had
been called off and a Southern Pacific
attorney substituted. He challenged
anybody to name any railroad man
who fs not supporting Gage, and he
challenged Gage's statement that the
funding bill amendment to the de
ficiency bill was Morgan's amendment.
He said it was Gear's amendment, and
that the Morgan clause in relation to
the Nicaraguan canal was stricken out.
He said Senator White opposed the
Gear amendment and only voted for
the deficiency bill after the Gear
amendment was adopted.
Referring to the charge that he had
been in office and drawn too much sal
ary, Maguire said that perhaps thÂ»
State has paid too much for his educa
tion, but he began in the kindergarten
and worked his way up, while Gage
wanted to begin in the university of
politics.
Upon the conclusion of Judge Ma
guire's speech in the opera-house ha
addressed the overflow meeting briefly
and Hutchison, Jones and ostrom ad
dressed the audience in the opera
house.
The big- crowd stayed until the last
speaker was through.
CONGRESSMAN BARLOW
ATTEMPTS TO EXPLAIN
The Populist Candidate Meets With
a Chilly Reception at Los
Angeles.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 2S.â Congressman
Charles A. Barlow for the second time at
tempted to-night to explain to a Los An
geles audience his famous "business op
portunities" letter which he addressed to
J. Marion Brooks after his election in
3596. He entered the same old plea of
ignorance of the law which makes it a
felony for a Congressman to act as an
agent for a private individual having a
claim against the Government. Barlow
varied the monotony a liftle this evening
by scoring Brooks In the most bitter lan
guage for having betrayed him. Barlow
also denied that he had Intentionally
loaded the mails during the weighing sea
son to help out the Southern Pacific. The
fuct remains, however, that he did this
very same thing.
Before closing, the Populist candidate
attempted to besmirch the character oi R
J. Waters, Republican candidate for Con
gress, by asserting that he was connected
with the failure of the Bear Valley Dam
Company. The statements Barlow made
are without weight, for thf reason that
Mr. Waters had no connection with the
Bear Valley Company for some months
prior to its failure.
The audience was a chilly one. Ma
gulre's name was greeted with but little
applause, and Barlow himself received a
veritable frost.

GEORGE A, KNIGHT
AT MARYSVILLE
Makes a Stirring Cam
paign Speech.
NO LIVE ISSUE OVERLOOKED
WORDS OF PRAISE AND CAUSTIC
CRITICISM.
Fallacies of the Single Tax Doctrine
Pointed Out â No Anglo-Saxon
Alliance â Patriotism in
Railroads.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MARYSVILLE, Oct. 26.â The Marys
vllle Theater was packed from pit to
dome to-night by an intelligent and en
! thusiastic audience assembled to hear
Hon. George A. Knight, San Fran
cisco's eminent lawyer and orator, dis
cuss the political issues of the day from
a Republican standpoint. A band of
i music enlivened the streets prior to the
j meeting, and Democrats and Repub
! Means vied for the choice seats next the
speaker's stand in the hall.
Hon. Charles M. Gorman, who was
chairman of the meeting, invited the
following vice presidents to seats on the
stage: G. W. Hall, G. W. Haxney, Phil
Divver, D. C. McGanney, J. W. Greely,
Dunning Rideout, G. W. Wilson, J. F.
Eastman, M. F. Brown, Harry Carden,
J. W. Cass, V. L. Earnshields, Samuel
Ewell, F. B. Moors, J. O. Gates, H. D.
King, A. B. Miller, W. H. Parks Jr.,
W. C. Swain, G. R. Eckart, J. C. Bald
win, N. V. Nelson, C. J. McCoy, Charles I
Hapgood, C. P. Pierce and Fred Mon
net.
Mr. Knight, who was the only
speaker of the eveningâ Tirey L. Ford
failing to arrive on account of another
engagement â began his address with a 'â 
glowing tribute to the Republican
party, which he declared was as broad j
in its principles as the country itself. ,
He took up the early banking laws and i
reviewed the nation's politics down to !
the time when the people decided they j
wanted a change of administration. He |
said they got Grover Cleveland, who j
was the friend of Wall street and the
bankers to the detriment of the navy,
which was badiy in need of ironclads.
To John D. Spreckels and The Call
Mr. Knight paid a handsome tribute,
declaring Mr. Spreckels to be one of
the State's best citizens, and that hia j
paper is doing effective work in every
cause that tends to benefit the Pacific
Coast. Of the Republican nominees i
for Justices of the Supreme Court he |
had only words of the highest com- j
mendation.
Then followed a grand word painting
eulogistic of the First Regiment of j
California Volunteers â "that noble body !
of young men first to take the Stars and
Stripes across the ocean." Maguire it i
was, he said, who voted to starve that i
patriotic band. Maguire it was who op
posed the teaching of the English lan
guage to the children in the schools of
New Mexico. If Maguire is the great
friend of the people that the Democracy
claims then his place is in Washing
ton, where the battle rages hottest, no-t
in the gubernatorial chair, where he
will have nothing to do but draw his
salary, with the stipend he gets through
the civil service.
Mr. Knight then paid a high compli
ment to Mrs. Phoebe Hearst, Miss Jen
nie Flood and Mrs. Stanford for their
princely gifts in the interest of educa
tion. Mrs. Stanford, the bereaved
mother and widow, he said, had stood
alone and fought her battle of circum
stances to carry out Senator Stanford's j
life desire; she had denied herself the ,'
court's allowance that the university i
might succeed, and at last preferred ',
duty to sentiment by giving her home j
for the help of our growing children.
The speaker next urged strong
grc-unds against an Anglo-Saxon alli
ance, favoring peace with all nations
and purposing with the crops of Amer
ica and the products of her artisans to
both feed and develop all the world's
nations. He had words of praise for
Russia, whose ironclads lay in our har
bors while England harbored our ene
mies and struck us a blow from which
we have never recovered.
The fallacies of the single tax doctrine
were pointed out briefly, and, alluding:
to the railroad question, Mr. Knight
facetiously remarked that if the people
are not careful thpy will have two rail
roads to fight instead of one. The ac
tion of the Central Pacific in sending
her trains of sealed cars to the East and
secretly carrying to San Francisco the
ammunition which Dewey must have
to protect the nation's honor alone
atoned for all the people had said of it.
None of the live questions of the day
escaped the notice of the gifted talker,
and when he had concluded three
hearty cheers were sent up for the Re
publican party and its standard-bearer
in California.

Frank Phillips. Pick atatrs that his em
ployer will probably be here the early
part of the coming week.
Dick Clawson is stiU riding in the far
East and will not be seen in the saddle
here the ttrst part of the meeting. His
services will be greatly missed, for Jockey
talent of the rignt sort is a scarcity.
It is gossiped about In Eastern turf cir
cles that Jimmy MoCormick, former
trainer for Burns & Waterhouse, will
have charge of Sydney Paget's string of
high-priced horse flesh next season. If
Jimmy still has the Eastern turf reporters
under the command of his mesmeric in

THE FLORISTS
PLAY POORLY
AT THE BAT
For This Reason They
Lost a Game.
EGAN SHOULD HAVE BUNTED
HIS DISPENSING WITH TEAM
WORK INJURIOUS.
With a Man on First and One on
Second With Nobody Out It ,
Is a Good Play to
Bunt.
By Joe Corbett.
The "Florists" of San Jose really star
tled me on Sunday last by the poor and
strictly amateurish methods which they
employed while at bat during their con
test with the Oaklands.
Since the game began to flourish I
have not witnessed such instances of in
ferior batting, and by a team which is
composed of such good talent. The partic
ular play which I intend criticizing (and
It will stand just a little bit) is visible in
the make-up oi all the clubs in the league,
barring the Sacramentos, and is one
which should be corrected before the
lesser lights of baseballdom become Im
bued with the idea that the present man
ner of consummating it is the only and
proper way.
This misplay originates from the fact
that there are a number of players in
this Pacific Coast League who do not
know, and,* I dare say, never will know
what team work really is, and the im
mense amount of benefits that are to be
derived from its use; andfelso that they are
either ignorant of the fact or are familiar
with it and don't careâ which would make
matters a trifle more seriousâ that an oc
casional bunt or sacrifice at the proper
moment would do more toward a team's
success than almost any other play.
In Sunday's game the Florists made
I but one run despite the fact that on three
different occasions they had two men on
bases with no one out. This Is very poor
baseball. True, Pitcher Russell of the
opposition was doing excellent service,
yet it makes no difterence how well a
pitcher may be doing, he can be bunted.
He can be "bunted when it is almost im
possible to hit him safely, and when the
Florists had men on first and second,
with no one out there was but one play
to make, especially when it was apparent
that sate hits were mighty scarce, and
that play was to bunt or sacrifice. Had
the Florists indulged in this style of play,
and the situation did demand It, surely
they might have won the game, and if
not so fortunate at least runs would have
crossed the plate to their credit. This is
so for the reason that in each instance
where a bunt would have advanced two
runners, a long fly or a hit follows, and
on each of these the man who should
have been on third would have scored.
Instead of sacrificing or bunting, how
evr, as every team should do in such
situations, each player did his utmost to
[ send the bail over the housetops to
Ninth street, and in consequence one
fouled out, another went out on a short
fiy and another hit a liner to second
base from which a double play enÃued.
To better acquaint the players and
readera of this article with the point in
question 1 will take up one of those mis
takes from its beginning. With a man
on first and one on second "Truck" Egan,
that handsome individual, came to bat.
Hts only play was to advance the run
ners and to do this it was necessary to
bunt or sacrifice, which in such an
i exigency, would be about the same thing.
I Instead of doing so he attempted to knock'
I the cover off the sphere, and failed, a lit
! tie foul fly being the best he could do,
j and this was gobbled up by the catcher.
The batter following Egan hit a fly to
short center Held and was out. The run
ner on second could hardly have made
third, and displayed excellent judgment
;in remaining where he was. The next
! batter made a hit to right. The ball was
fieldt- 1 rapidly and this runner on second
could not score. The next man up went
I out on a grounder, and mind you, out of
iit all, not a run crossed the plate. Egan
was the one responsible. If he had bunt
i ed, the runners on first and second would
I have advanced to second and third. The
i fly- to short center would, I feel certain,
have scored that man on third, and on
the throw to the plate, made in the hope
of shutting off this run, the one on sec
j ond, would, in all events, have gone to
third, and scored on the hit to right field.
Egan, by his "hit it over the fence"
methods, simply threw two runs away,
and if he is accorded the privilege of us
ing his own judgment at bat, it la high
time the management censured him. If,
however, he was told by the captain to
j "hit it out," it is time the club directors
I elected a man to the captaincy who is
; capable of directing players to do some
i thing that is baseball and worthy of com
j mendation.
i It was really aggravating, after all that
| has been said regarding team work at bat,
I to see players throw games away simply
i because they desire to make of themselves
[ heroesâ that only shine, by-the-by, but a
I brief minute. The patrons of baseball in
I the Eastern r.iAes will hoot and hiss a
! player unmercifully if he casts aside team
work to satisfy any other motive. They
Ido this because they understand the
! game, and the first thing the players of
the league know the hissing and hoot act
will be taken up by the fans at Recrea
; tion Park, and goodness only knows
' where it will stop.
There is no getting away from the fact
; that team work at the bat. as well as in
< the field, is indispensably necessary to a
club's success. It is an appalling sight
to see an aggregation like the "Florists"
play such poor ball at bat. One indiscre
i tion In a game might be overlooked, but
j when throe of them occur of a similar
; nature in the same contest and a game
j that might be won is thrown away, one
!!s liable to lftdulgeâ and justly so â in
thoughts that reflect no credit on the
| team or Its captain.
Ii is Impossible to state what really
' would have happened had the Florists
! made some attempt at team work in Sun
i day's game. Scan's stupidity I have men
| tioned, and it i.s not difficult to conceive
: the amount of damage his eagerness for
: glory brought his cohorts. And as Jwo
other players on that team made the same
mistake, one can readily see that the San
Jose players need a good shaklrtg up for
dispensing witn team work at a time
; when It is most needed. . There are a
I number of other players scattered
through the league who also need a shak
' ing- up on the same point, and the sooner
i!t Is done the better. They should be
ma.;<Â» to realize that team work is more
desiraUle than off-handÂ«>rl pUiying, and tne
patrons of the game shouiu not interfere
v Ith the player's intentions when he is
endeavoring to bunt and thereby make
the proper play by yelling to him to "hit
It out " This Is very bad form, and often
spoils a good plft^ In conclusion, 1 will
say once again that it is always a good
play to bunt with a man on first and one
'< on second, with no one out. And I trust
! the Fforlsts will make all the runs they
can in the future Instead of throwing
them away.
HEAVY-WEIGHT PUGILISTS.
! Nick Burley Will Fight Jack Stelzner
Before the Sacramento
Club.
As a return match between Jack Stelas
ner and Joe Kennedy is now doubtful, be
cause of Kennedy's proposed contest with
Jeffries, next month, Nick Burly, who has
Just returned from Roslin, after having
fought a ten-round bout with an Austra
lian pugilist named "Coolgardle" Smith,
states that he will take Kennedy's place
and fight Stelzner before the Sacramento
Club or any other club any distance from
ten to twenty rounds. Burley whipped
several fighters during the summer in
British Columbia.

REAL ESTATE
IS STEADILY
IMPROVING
Encouraging State of
the Market.
MANY SALES NEGOTIATED
A COMPLETE CHANGE FOR THE
BETTER PREDICTED.
A Review of the Records, New
Building Contracts, Recent
Sales and General
Notes.
Real estate is still slowly and gradually
Improving and conditions now point to
the certainty that before the present year
is over the market will have gradually
evolved from the long existent stagnation
which has characterized and impeded its
progress for a year or more and enter on
a new era of prosperity.
In every department there is a marked
indication of a gradual change for the
better. Sales are becoming more numer
ous, and. although not as yet of unusual
value, still are of a valuation which brings
encouragement to brokers inasmuch as
it is continually increasing on new nego
tiations.
The general idea that, unless large sales
are being made continually, the market
must necessarily be depreciating is er
roneous. As long as there is a steady
business animation or life realty will be
considered in a good condition.
This fact is being more fully realized
as the number of medium sales continue
to increase daily. Property owners who
have been so backward and timid in both
buying and selling are becoming satisfied
that the "world of realty" is steadily ad
vancing to a condition of life and pro
gress. It is claimed that as soon as prop
erty holders become confident and fully
convinced of the advancing encour
aging conditions of the market real es
tate will find a ready market and a good
price:
The building operations throughout the
city, although not very extensive, still
indicate by their increasing number an
evident improvement on the records for
the previous week. Advance in this de
partment seems general, not being re
stricted to any one section or individual
district of the city.

gages and trust deetis recorded, aggregating a

HEAVY-WEIGHTS MATCHED.
Jim Jeffries and Joe Kennedy Have
Signed Articles to Fight in
November.
Billy Delaney, the manager of Jim Jef
fries, the heavy-weight pugilist of South
ern California, held a conference yester
day with "Young" Mitchell, who is man
ager for Joe Kennedy, the fighter who
recently defeated Stelzner In Woodward's
Pavilion by being awarded a decision.
Mitchell has great confidence in Kennedy
whipping any of the big fellows now In
the professional ranks excepting Bob
Fitzsimmons, and feeling satisfied that a
contest between Jeffries and Kennedy
would result favorably for the local man,
he issued a challenge to Jeffries^ which
"deft" was quickly accepted by Delaney.
Articles have been drawn up and signed
for a twenty-round bout to be held in
Woodward's Pavilion in the latter part
of November. The club that offers the
better inducements will get the fight.
The agreement reads that the winner of
the match will receive 75 per gent of the
! winner's end and the loser 25 per cent.
Kennedy has been taking the best of
care of himself and will certainly be in
splendid form when he is called upon to
give an account of himself. Jeffries is In
Los Angeles working at his trade, which Is
that or a boilermaker. His friends say
that his left thumb, which was badly In
jured when he fought Bob Armstrong
(colored) in New Tork, is rapidly improv
ing and that the pugilist will have sound
hands on the evening he will toe the
scratch in Woodward's Pavilion. Doubt
less the Excelsior Athletic Club, which
has a permit for an entertainment in No
vember, will capture the heavy-weight
prize.

MEN WHO UNDERWENT
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
RECRUITING THE NATIONAL
GUARD OF CALIFORNIA.
Those Who Were Before the Surgeons
Have All Made a Very
Good Showing.
The physical examination of>4he men
who are to compose i the new National
Guard of California was commenced Tues
day night in the regimental armory at the
corner of Page and Gough streets. The
examination was carried on according to
the rules laid down for the United States
army, and was -conducted by Lieutenant
Colonel Hanson, surgeon on the staff of
Brigadier General AVarfleld, in the com
pany room of Company D. It was super
vised by Major Jansen, chief of the mus
tering officers, and Majors Margo and
Wagner. The physical work was per
formed by Surgeons Dunn and Hamlin of
the Fifth Infantry. Harris and Morrisey
of the Naval Militia, FHzgibbons of
Troop A and Major Peddlar, surgeon at
the Presidio Hospital. Major Schmitt of
the division staff was also present.
The men who were examined were
those who have signed the petition to be
come members of Company L of the
First Regiment and those who are anx
ious to enter the ranks of Company B.
The men made a remarkably good
showing, all being of good build, well de
veloped and free from deformities, and it
was the expressed opinion of the examin
ing surgeons that the percentage of re
jection would be exceedingly small. Aa
rapidly as a company is examined the
surgeons' reports will be forwarded to the
office of the adjutant general, wher they
will be passed upon. As soon as one
company shall have been accepted at
general headquarters, the men accepted
will be called upon to elect their officers.
and the same night they will be mustered
In.
Last night there was an examination
of the men who have asked to join Com
panies C and G at the Ellis-street
armory to-night those who want
to Companies H and B will be ex
amined at the regimental armory, on
Friday night those who petitioned to join
Company F of the Fifth Infantry will be
examined in Oakland, and on Saturday
the unexamined of Company B will ap
pear before the surgeons at the regi
mental armory.
This is the first time in the history of
the National Guard of California that
men have been examined before admis
sion into service of the State.

Becker and Creegan
Again in Court.
DEANF'S STORY OF THE PLOT
HE TELLS OF THE METHODS
USED IN THE SWINDLE,
The Prosecution Hopes to Supply the
Deficiency That Resulted in a
Reversal of the First
Verdict.
Parl Becker and James Creegan, ac
. of having swindled the Nevada
Pn:.k out of $22.iX0 by means of a r
draft, are again on trial before Judge
Wallace. The .iury was completed to try
otorious i Bterday morning
and the i penlng of the afternoon Bession
saw Prank 4^. Beaver, alias Deane, an
accomplice, who turned Btate'a evidence,
on the stand telling th<- story of the
planning of the scheme that was so sue
. ty carred out.
A quartet of forgers are said to have
shared honors in the swindle which re-
Fuited in the arrest of Deane, Creegan,
McClosky and Becker. Deane was fore
most in the conspiracy, his associates now
on trial claim, but the evidence given In
the last trial showed that such was not the
case. That he was associated with the
defendants and carried out the plans
they laid he does not deny, but that he
was the ringleader and responsible for
the sins of the forgers in custody he
does deny and the evidence bears out his
statements. The alleged accomplice. Jo
seph McClosky, was charged with com
plicity in the crime, tried and acquitted.
Deane has turned State's evidence and
the people now seek to place out of
harm's way his noted pals, Becker, the
"king of forgers," and Creegan, "the
middleman." Becker and Creegan were
convicted on their last trial, but the
lack of evidence tending to corroborate
the story given by Deane resulted in the
verdict "being reversed by the Supreme
Court. The want. It has been stated, has
been supplied since then and the pros
pect of the prisoners spending the re
mainder of their lives in prison is ex
ceedingly good.
The morning session yesterday was
dull, with the exception that Attorney
Dunne, who, with his partner, H. C.
McPlke, is caring for the interests "of the
prisoners occasionally livened matters by
referring to Attorney Ach, special coun
sel for the prosecution, as the represent
ative of the Bankers' Association. This
usually brought forth an answer, spicy
if not grilling, from the lips of opposing
counsel.
The afternoon session opened at 2
o'clock and Deane was immediately
placed upon the stand. He reiterated the
story of how he had been approached
by the prisoners in New York; how he
came to this coast and opened offices
and an account with the Nevada Bank;
how the draft was raised; how It was
cashed, and the manner in which the
escape was made to the East. Califor
nia was selected for the field of opera
tions he said, owing to the richness of
Its banks and the laxity of their officials.
His story was interrupted again and
again by counsel for the defense, but It
was, however, all placed before the jury
before adjournment. To-day the case will
go on. and the State hopes to build up
a rase against the forgers that will
stand.

Stormy Session of the Board Yes
terday Ends Without Decisive
Action on the Question of
Paying Obligations.
A pair of scrutinizing eyes from the
Grand Jury looked down upon the mem
bers of the School Board In regular ses
sion yesterday. The eyes were the per
sonal property of Samuel C. Irving, chair
man of the committee on schools of the
inquisitorial body, and they Ceaselessly
roved from one School Director's face to
.another's in apparently deep study.
"I want to get acquainted with the per
sonality of these gentlemen for certain
reasons," was the only explanation offered
by the grand juror, when asked for the
whys and wherefores of his presence. .Mr.
Irving remained In the gallery during
the early hours of the session.
City Attorney Gallagher presented an
opinion to the effect that the Board of
bupervisors has no power to erect a
school building in Lafayette Park. '
The financial question was evidently up
permost in the minds of th* members and
a heated. debate was precipitated by the
following, resolution, presented by Edward
Gallagher and Samuel Waller:.
Your committtee on finance recommends that
all expense except such as may be absolutely
necessary for the preservation of the health of
the children be immediately suspended, and
that no indebtedness in excess of $50 shall be
contracted by any committee except the same
shall be authorized by the board.
Director Head inquired as to the aggre
gate amount of the unpaid bills.
,* bout $14,000 worth have been aud
ited," replied Gallagher. .
"Are there any other bills not audited?"
demanded Head.
GalTa|ri'er a good many more," admitted
Gallugher.
"Then I object!" exclaimed Head "This
practice of various members in contract
ing debts for supplies without consulting
the board has been carried altogether too
far. It was without authority. We don't
know whether the supplies were ever de
pa^ e Oa a r d di V te^ d bif, OO s Wn the reSOlution to
Gallagher thereupon moved that the
'â  to h [f, of ,^ 6oard be notified that
tnelr bills will not be paid
This resolution raised a howl and three
or four members tried to talk at once
Waller demanded that all of the unpaid
bilis, Including those not audited, amount
%&JS a H oUt ?2 "- 000 - be brought in and
considered in open session
After a prolonged wrangle it was de
cided to meet at the call of the president
and discuss the financial affairs of the
DOOTu.
Superintendent of Schools R. H Web
ster presented a report which ended with
the following significant statement: "Re
garding finances 1778,000 remains to ope
rate the department for the next nine
months. Salaries alone require $838 000
earing a deficit of $60,000â without allow
ing a dollar for supplies and repairs The
situation suggests the exercise of' care
and frugality to prevent a deficit at the
end of the fiscal year exceeding that ex
isting June 30, 1898, to wit, $98,444 65 "
In the face of the financial difficulties
now threatening to overwhelm the board
Chairman D. F. Ragan and Samuel L.
\\ aller, of the Committee on Secondary
Education, recommended "that manual
training be added to the course of study
for the Mission High School."
Head objected. "Here comes the com
mittee trying to provide new places for
more teachers. This thing must stop."
Barrington added that the expense of
fitting up the manual training depart
ment would be heavy, and that there are
no funds available.
Waller and Ragan defended their action
in Introducing the resolution, and de
clared there would be no additional ex
pense worth mentioning.
The resolution was carried with an
amendment that no expense should be en
tailed thereby on the present board

A new class was formed in Crocker

Presented With an Address and a Check for Three
Thousand Dollars Before His Departure.
WPIKN the Rev. Peter C. Yorke
departs to take a much needed rest
alter the arduous labors which
have occupied his attention since
his installation into the priesthood, he
will carry with him something more sub
stantial than the well wishes and God
speeds of his friends in this city, for
while the hearty hand-clasp and tearful
eye which greeted him last night at the
reception at the parlors of the Pioneer
building were of a nature to touch the
heart and fill the soul with pleasure,
there was that given which showed the
appreciation of his friends was not con
fined to words alone.
After an hour of conversation, Instru
mental music and song. Judge R. Y.
Hayne advanced to the center of the
room and presented, in well chosen
. a magnificent address from his
friends to Father Yorke. The address
whs in illuminated text on embossed vei
lum, and the whole was bound in seal
and ornamented with silver. Accompany
ing this beautiful gift was one that was
not so ornamental, but which also car
ried a testimonial of love and apprecia
tionâa check for $3000.
Judge Hayne addressed Father Yorke
briefly and then read the address, as fol
lows:
Rev P. C. Yorke, San Francisco, Cal.â itev
erend and Dear Sir: Your friends have heard
with sorrow that the strain or yuor many du
ties nan been such as to render it necessary
that you show yourself the mercy of a little
rÂ«-tt and relaxation.
Your brethren of the clergy have testified
their fraternal regard and we of the laity have
deemed it a not unfitting- occasion to express
our appreciation of your services to the com
munity and our kindly fulmars to yourself,
personally, by asking your accaptance of this
accompanying testimonial.
It is proper to say that, while this has been
confined mainly to those who have personal
regard for you, It Is not merely because of
such regard that we have acted. It is because,
also, that we recognize your services to the
cause of religious freedom. It was no light
thing that a set of men should band together
for the purpose of preventing nearly a third
of their fellow citizens from sharing In the
jrcvernment of the country upon the sole ground
of their religious belief. As you have often
pointed out with a power that is beyond us,
this Is a practical violation of the provision
"that no religious test shall ever be required
a- a qualification to any office or public trust
under the United States," and of the provision
of the constitution of California that "the free
exercise and enjoyment of religious profession
and worship without discrimination or prefer;
ence shall forever be guaranteed n this State
and of the spirit of American liberty. Those
who laid broad and deep the foundations of the
commonwealth well knew that if one religion
girls were not concerned, was the cause of
his complaint. The Superintendent. s re
quest was referred to President Barring

Chinese Merchants Ask for Twelve

for a Bald.
The Won On Hal Company, a Chinese

Circuit Court yesterday against Chief of
Police Lees and Sergeant McManus to
recover $2535 actual damages and JIO.OOO

a posse of police, broke into their prem

the vigor of a strong mind and the indignation

Father Yorke was so overcome with
emotion that it was some time before he
could find words with which to thank his
friends for their testimonial of apprecia
tion. He said in part:
It Is very hard on such an occasion to find
â¢words to thank you for the kind sentiments
which you have expressed and the generosity to
me and appreciation of the work which It has
been my duty to take up and carry on. When
one feels deeply one prefers silence to voicing
sentiments, and were it not that you might
take it amiss I would now prefer that silent
gratitude which lies at the bottom of my heart.
In this country we are living under a govern
ment that has not yet grown out of the experi
mental stage. It is a system upon which the
governments of the Old World look with a Jeal
ous eye, lat it is a system that has been
proven a success. In this country and under
this Government every man stands an equal
chance and every man is eg.ua! before the law
and before God. And b* the constitution of
this Government no man shail be put to pains
and penalties because of his religious belief.

of government has been tried and
has not been found wanting.
The Catholic church, o which I am a priest,
came into this land and has .striven to advance
the cause of human thought, and in ro country
and under no government has the church reach
ad so gran<i and so glorious a position and in
no country is she so free as in this republic of
America. The Catholic church attempts to
gala nothing by coercion. Faith cannvt be co
â¢â¢:â¢â¢â  â '!. Th" church bases all her hopes of In
crease and power on appeals to reason, and
hers Is a religion that is b-st suited to those
who reason. It la for UÂ»" reason that she has
met R :â  dr-iimed of in other
lands, and the suivst promise of future success
lies In the bond of lore and sympathy which
exists between the c]prÂ»ry and the laity.
The reason for this is that we have grows
wipe with those who have founded and built
vernment of the republic. They tried to
combine the Individuality of the States Into
the unity of the nation, recognizing the rights
and the duties of the States Just as the church
recognizes the rights anU duties of the clergy
and laity. The separation of church and state
has brought about a union of church and state
ami the army of the I>ird g if-h on in the path
of duty, each portion keeping In Its sphere.
To come to matters that are more personal In
the addrets which you have presented me, let
me say that while I may have received some
censure for the stand which took in the mat
ter spoken of, when the church is at
tacked who will speak in her defense
if those who have consecrated their lives
to her service kpep silence? The fight was made
Â» cowards who attacked women and the poor
who were defenseless, and then It was that
those who believed in Justice and In fairness
were bound to stand up. It was necessary to
fight the enemies of liberty and that you have
shown appreciation for the small part which
I took in helping the cause of right shows me
that my work was not Ir- vain.
God knows that I am not sorry to cease work
for awhile, for while some may have thought
that I wan possessed of a perverse delight In
maklncr trouble, what I did was from a sense
of duty to combat the wrong to the utmost of
my power and ability. It was a hard task,
but it was made easy by the support given me
by you gentlemen and thnpe others of my
friends who so well upheld my hands.
Good-by was then spoken in words
that became much broken as the speaker
brought his talk to a close. The company
' which crowded the rooms gathered around
Father Yorke and extended to him good
wishes for a prosperous and pleasant
into custody for contempt of court. The case
was continued till to-day to get the evidence
of Mrs. Gross of Alameda, to whom Jung made
the threats.

A REMARKABLE OFFER!
TO PERSONS AFFLICTED WITH DEAFNESS OR CATARRH OF THE NOSE,
THROAT, VOCAL CORDS OR LUNGS, CATARRH OF THE
STOMACH, LIVER, ETC.
FREE TWO WEEKS' TREATMENT AND ALL MEDICINES INCLUDED
to those who apply at the office any time within the next two weeks from date.
People living in the country may avail themselves of this offer by reading the fol-
lowing symptoms over carefully, marking those that apply to their case and send-
ing them by mall to the office with a request for home treatment. This offer is
strictly an honorable one. It is made to those who suffer with affections of the
ears or catarrh in its various forms, to convince them that ours Is the treatment
that cures If at the expiration of the two weeks' free trial treatment you are
satisfied with its results, to continue treatment will only cost you our regular
rates. *5 per month, including all medicines and our watchful care and atten-
tion until a cure is effected. There are thousands of people in and about San
Francisco to-day who have some imperceptible germ taint of catarrh abroad in
the system or afloat in the circulation, as well as vast numbers of people in whom
those irerm taints have developed into chronic ailments of varying degrees of ma-
li^nitv suffering a"d danger. In most instances the difficulty is aggravated by the
fact that the victims cannot diagnose their miseries or distinguish the cause of
them The fact is a majority of common chronic diseases, though known as
throat trouble lung' trouble, stomach trouble kidney trouble, etc.. are really of
a rnHrrhÃl or'i-ln and nature. Every part of the mucous membraneâ the nose,
throat oars lungs, stomach, -liver. kidneys and bladder-is subject to disease
ami hl'leht by catarrh and to enable many afflicted persons to get a correct con-
ception of fee real nature of their malady the following almost unvarying symp-
toms are presented: ' . .. ,
CATARRH OF HEAD and THROAT
i The head and throat become disease! from
' neglected coMÂ«. Catarrh when the con-
dition of the blood predisposes to this condition.
"Is thf voice husky?"
"Do y is spit up slime?"
"Do y.'u ache all ov^r?"
"Do you snore at night?"
"Do you blow out scabs at night?
"Is your nose Ftopppd up?"
"Does your none discharge?"
"Does the nose bl**d easily?"
"Is this worse toward nig-ht?"
"Does the nose itch and burr.""
"Is there pain In front of hÂ»n<l?"
"Is there pain across the eyes?"
"Ir there tickling in the throat?"
"Is your senM ol smel! leaving?"
"Do'you hawk to clear the threat?"
"If. the throat dry in the mnrnlng?" _
"Are you losing your sense of taste?" -
"Do you sleep with your mouth open ?'
"Does your nose stop up toward nigh*?"
CATARRH OF THE
BRONCHIAL TUBES.
This condition often results from Catarrh ex-
! tending from the head and throat, and. if left
unchecked, extends down the windpipe into the
! bronchial tubes, and in time attacks the lungs.
"Have you a cough?"
i "Are you losing flesh?"
"Do ycu cough at night?"
"Have you a pain in side?"
"Do you take cold easily?"
"Is your appetite variable?"
"Have you stitches In side?"
"Do you cough until you gag?"
"Do you raise frothy material?"
"Do you coujrh on colng to bed?"
"Do you couph in the morning 7 "
"Are you low-spirited at times?"
"Do you spit up yellow matter?"
"Is your cough short and hacking?"
"Do you spit up llttlo cheesy lumps?"
"Hare you a disgust for fatty foods?"
"Is there a tickling behind the palate?"
"Do you feel you are growing weakar?"
"I? there a burning pain In the throat?"
"Have you pain behind the breastbone?"
"Do you cough worse night and morning?"
"Do you have to sit up at night to get
breath ? r>
CATARRH OF THE STOMACH.
This condition may result from several
causes, but the usual cause is Catarrh, the
1 mucus dropping down into the throat and be-
j ing swallowed.
"Is there nausea?"
"Are you costive?"
"Is there vomiting?"
"Do you belch up gas?"
"Have you waterbrash ?"
"Are you light-headed?"
"Is your tongue coated?"
"Do you hawk and Â«pit?"
"Is there pain after eating?"

from Kentucky, who used to be a great sufferer from constipation. ,
She says she used to suffer greatly with headache too, due, no doubt,
to indigestion and constipation, and tried 'every, kind of remedy, but
could find no relief I until she began using Ripans Tabules. The very \
first Tabule gave relief, M ai\d now," she says, " headache is a stranger. ** : â¢
The 'indigestion '- and constipation disappeared, and she never fell â¢

OUR WHEAT AND GOLD.
BHARP DEMAND FOR ONE AND EXOR
jiiOUS STOCKS OF THE OTHER.
The New York circular of Henry dews says:
Apart from ths election uncertainties, the "'â¢"
flmr.ce of which cannot be disregarded, c.-nd.
ti-jiiS affecting the stock market are inurcvlng.
The European wheat trade has com*; to under
stand that, notwithstanding the moderate in
crease In the worlds crop of this year ovjr that
o: in., t:.. supply from new crop ani stocks
in hand will not be up to the average standard
end nicy are consequently advancing their bids
t.i American wheat. The extent at the current
fcrMari ciÂ«p.t.nd may be inferred from the fact
that within the last lea days engagements have
been made for the export of uO.OOO bushels
or wheat. This shows that a point in price
has been touched at which our farmers are
â¢willing to sell; but it remains to be seen
whether, after such large foreign purchases at
the current range of values, growers may not
hold for a further rise. This ten millions of
busnels coming to seaboard will be a severe
tax upon the carrying capacity of the railroads,
and our Chicago correspondent telegraphs us,
"the business the Northwest railroads are do
ing Is marvelous."
It is as yet too early to estimate the effect
of these grain >.â .;â â  upon the gold movement.
Some moderate tnsasnncrits tux- being made
Icr the export of the metal to this side; and
although tae cpeiatlons are light and only
occasional they show tat the exchange market
Is in a condition Which intent readily yield to
the pressure of the bills to be made against
thest wheat shipments. That, however, would
not necessarily mean Imports of gold. Ihe
higher rate for money at London than at New
York would afford a tempting opportunity for
bixty days employment oi idle funds In the
purchase of exchangeâ a form of transient in
vestment which has been much resorted to
Within the last twelve months, and at one time
to an extent estimated at $:0,000,1<>0. In truth,
we have no reason to anxiously covet any
further additions to our already extraordinary
etock of the yeliow metal. A year ago our
national holdings of K^ld reached their highest
point $713,000,000. Since then we have made i
net imports amounting to $125,100,000, and tire i
domestic production and receipts^ from the |
Klondike re lon must amount to $70,000,000 j
more, which would make our present national
etock over fJOu.OOO.UOO. This places is far Ahead
of France, which has been the largest gold- I
holding country In the world, and puts our
stock nearly $:.V0,000,000 in excess of our former
highest figures. Th" receipts this week at Ban .
Francisco from Molbcurne amount to $3,750,000 |
an.] at this port $1 320,000, making the week's
arrivals over $5,C00,0C0. It Is to be hoped that
some more productive use may be round for our
increasing creditor foreign balances than piling
tip stocks of gold in excess of all requirements i
fur money or banking purposes.
- The phenomenal Increasing foreign trade i
balance in our favor, the Immense freight busi- !
ness of the grain-carrying roads and the grow
ing ease Id money, are factors forceful enough
to advance the stock market; and but for the
coming elections the market would now be in
a very buoyant ate. With the elections out
of the way the effects of these influences will
assert themselves and will suffice to knock out
al! bear Jictions. With such earning* as the
Western roads are making, and with the im
menaity of stuff In sight to be moved, it Is al
most impossible to keep the securities that
these roads represent down; and when they
get ready to advance the balance of the market !
will go with them. There Is, consequently,
much hone In the situation after the elections.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Oct. 26.â The stock market
showed a tendency to fall Into quietude again
to-day, as though In sympathy with the dull
ness and uncertainty of foreign exchanges. But
there was a quiet absorption of standard stock* j
all through the list, a generally firm tone and
marked strength In a few cases, so that the
average of prices is quite materially lifted as
a result of the day's trading. The reactionary
tendency in the wheat market, the falling oft
In the exports for both wheat and corn and the j
â weakness in the foreign grain markets were
Without effort apparently. The reason for the
apparently Illogical movements for â  the past
few days obviously is that the market Is en
tirely In the hands of professional traders,
without any participation by the outside pub
lic. When this class sell It Is simply with a
view to buying at a lower, level, and their
maneuvers can only prove successful where
they Induce a following to take the poor end
of the bargain. Where there Is no such follow
ing there is nothing to do but to retrace their
course by selling or buying, as the case may
be the Baal operations being made in opposi
tion to the culminating factor on which the
speculative commitment has been made. The
exciting causes of the traders' activities for
the last few days having subsided, the market
became comparatively dull to-day, and the
traders betook themselves to the highly specu
lative industrials. Tobacco moved feverishly
below yesterday's level and Sugar above on
large transactions; without and definable rea
eon in either case. The recovery In "sterling
exchange was the effect of the renewed string
ency in the London money market' caused- by
the needs of to-morrow's stock exchange settle
ment. Exchange on Paris showed easier tone,
reflecting the pressure for the movement of
funds from that center owing to the threaten
ing aspect of domestic politics there.
Honda were moderately active .at advanc
ing prices. Total sales, $319,000. - .
United States 3s coupon and the old 4s coupon

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Oct. 26. â The early Liverpool ca
bles showed that the wheat market there had
g-one to smash, as December had lost equal
to 2%c per bushel since yesterday's close. Paris
vras lower, while British consols were strong
at an advance of 1 I-160, telling plainly the
story of Improvement in the political situation
abroad. The opening price of wheat here was
from %@lc a bushel lower for December than
yesterday's closing quotations. Traders, how
ever, had a lurking apprehension that the for
eign' calm might be only the precursor of an
other storm. When later in the session a
further advance in consols was announced and
there watt an addition of Id to the opening
heavy decline in wheat at Liverpool, the feel-
Ing here became more pronouncedly bearish
and prices of wheat dropped through the bar
rier of "put*" that had been previously stop
ping the way. The total primary Western re
ceipts amounted to 1,587,000 bushels against
1,190,000 bushels the day corresponding last
â¢week. The market ruled heavy the greater
part of the session, but had numerous slight
reactions, due to taking profits by shorts. New

Prices rallied in the last ten minutes, due
largely to prudential purchases â by , shorts who
had profits. Various other reasons were as
signed, such as the taking of some wheat in

NEW YORK, Oct.' 26.â The Journal of Com

the last advance. Trade generally seems to be
lieve this report is being 1 circulated with a
view to stimulating the demand at current quo
tations, as it is not stated how soon or to
what extent prices are to be raised. Seeded
ralsir.B are reported to be in very good di
rmind, though prk-f-s vary widely. There has
been considerable demand for Valencia raisins.
Sultanas are scarce on spot. Currants aro in
I better request and the market is firm, with an
upward tendency. Apricots are firm, but thÂ«
limited supply and comparatively high prices
demanded restrict business. There is no change
in the market for figs.
California prunes are firm. Spot stocks are
pmall, and under gradually increasing de
mands of consumption the market is tending
upward. There is considerable inquiry for
Oregon and Washington prunes, but there is
little or nothing obtainable on spot, and there
are few offerings from coast. Some 1897 stock
Is ft-llinp from second hands at 6@6VzC for 40s

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,

The great struggle in the looal campaign
at this time is for the control of the
Board of Supervisors, and for the time be

Swell Supervisor Taicott's Majority.
publicans to succeed themselves. The re
maining three members are T. D. "Wells (a
Democrat), Charles Roeth (who has no
political creed) and John Mitchell (a Re
publican). The Democrats are trying to
secure the election of two of their faith,
because of the large amount of patronage
which the Supervisors control. Various
charges have been hurled at the Repub
lican members and many false and stuuid
statements have been made, but they are
so far removed from the facts that they
have had no efi'<_- t.
Supervisor Talcott has been criticized on
a â¢ int of his road fund. No fault has
been found with the many miles of roads
thai are under his charge, but ;>.\\ kinds
of nuns- nsical statements have been pub-
I regarding the funds. A careful
etud* of all that has been published re
but one fact, viz.â that Mr. Talcott
has, iike a good district official, "ot all
the money possible from the county for
the ro;uis in his territory and has spent it
to the very best advantage. It was re
cently stated that every day it rains adds
to Taicott's majority, because the hun
dreds of travelers along his roads cannot
help contrasting them with the condition
that prevailed before Mr. Talcott took
office.
The attempted opposition to Mr. Talcott
has brought out one very Important fact
of which no one was aware. It has been
stated that he was very careful to see
that the road in front of his own house
was in first-class .shape. It now trans
pires that the section of road referred to
was nut macadamized by the county but
by private contract and that Sherman &
Clay, J. R. Talcott and several other
property owners paid for it out of their
own pockets.
The substantial nature of the work done
on ihe roads, bridges and culverts in
Mr. Taicott's district has bsen common
subject of talk for the past two years.
Instead of frittering away public money
In wooden, flimsy structures that required
rebuilding after every storm, Mr. Taicott
has had constructed solid structures of
masonry that will last for all time, and
since he has pursued this business-like
policy there have been no complaints
made such as were of daily occurrence a
few years ago.
Alameda News Notes.
ALAMI2DA, Oct. 26.â The Democrats
will hold a rally next Saturday evening
at Holtz Hall. West End. N. J. Man
eoii will preside. Many of the candidates
on the so-called union ticket will address
the meeting. â .-___,Â»*,.
A woman representing herself as the ad
vertising agent of a local paper has suc
ceeded in collecting considerable money
from Alameda merchants on advertising
contracts, which have been pronounced
fakes.
Joseph A. Leonard underwent a surgi
cal operation to-day in an endeavor to
save his foot, which was seriously crushed
some weeks ago on the Yukon. It was
thought that the absence of medical at
tendance at the time of the accident might
necessitate the amputation of the injured
foot. Over fifty pieces of splintered bone
were removed from the foot to-day.
A MUCH-DESIRED CHILD.
Legal Fight Now On for the Custody
of Cecelia Church.
The fight between George F. Church, a
Fresno merchant, and the woman who
was once his wife, but who now bears
the name of Mrs. Alice A. Alexander, for
the custody of their child, Cecelia Church,
aged 15 years, again occupied the atten
tion of Judge Dunne yesterday morning.
The child Is now in the legal custody of
Mrs. Alexander. Church has brought
habeas corpus proceedings, an odd mode
of attempting to gain the custody of the
child, but, as she is of sufficient age to
nominate her own guardian, it is said
that it is simply a step taken on the part
of her father to find whether or not the
child is being properly cared for.
When the case was called yesterday a
continuance was requested, but before the
cour* would consent to grant the re
quÂ«Â»oc the child was placed upon the
stand. Prior to calling for her testi
mony counsel took occasion to explain the
circumstances that led up to the' litiga
tion for her custody. Eleven years ago
the litigants were divorced by a Fresno
court. Two children were placed in the
custody of the father, and one was placed
in the mother's care. Subsequently,
stated the attorney, the child given into
the custody of her mother left this city
and returned to her father. Mrs. Alex
ander hurried to Fresno and, with the as
sistance of a policeman, created considera
ble trouble, and when she returned the
child was with her. Again her father's
brother came to this city, found the child,
gave her money and told her to go to
her father. As the child was boarding
the boat on this side her mother, again
accompanied by a policeman, frustrated
the plans and placed the child in a con
vent in the Mission.
The child was then questioned regard
ing her peregrinations during the last
few years. She said she had been trans
ferred from school to school, having been
but a week in the Mission convent. She
expressed no choice between life with her
rather or dwelling in a convent at her
mother s bidding. In consequence, the
court postponed the case a few days and
In the meantime the child will deter
mine in whose custody she chooses to re
main until she attains her majority.
HIS CHARGES UNTRUE.
Officer Reardon Heavily Fined by the
Police Commissioners.
Policeman Neil Reardon of the Seven
teenth-street station was before the Po
lice Commissioners last night charged
with contumacious conduct in openly as
serting that Detectives Fitzgerald and
Graham and Prosecuting Attorney Gra
ham cf Judge Low's courf had destroyed
the complaint in a felony case for a mon
ey consideration.
The evidence showed that Reardon had
arrested a young man named Smith on a
warrant charging him with robbery.
Shortly before the preliminary examina
tion of Smith in the Police Court Rear
don, whose ambition is to be a detective,
declared In the presence of Beveral wit
nesses that Graham and Fitzgerald, the
! clever sleuths of the" Mission district, had
: conspired with Prosecuting Attorney Gra
; ham to "job" him. Just before the ex
; amination of the accused was commenced
i Reardon whispered to Judge Low that the
: complaint in the case had been destroyed
! and that the two detectives and the Pros
i ecuting Attorney of the court were guilty
I of the crime.
Reardon under oath denied he hail said
the officers or Graham had destroyed the
complaint. He admitted that at" tim.-s
he "talked too much," and perhaps said
something which some enemy had con
strued as reflecting on the integrity of the
two detectives and Prosecuting Attorney
Graham.
At the conclusion of the case the Com
missioners fined Reardon $100 with a se
vere admonition to keep his tongxie bri
dled in the future.

"A property owner paying taxes on $1000
at the rate of $1 10 (the average city rate
for the last ten years) now pays $11 tax.
When the park bonds are issued he will
pay $11 27. This will be a tax of only 27
cents a year, a total payment of $2 70
distributed over ten years.
"If a taxpayer goes to Golden Gate
Park, San Francisco, three times a year
because Oakland has no park, the cost
for his family of three persons would be
$2 70 per year for fares alone, or $27 In
ten years.
"For the second ten years, while the
park bonds are being redeemed, the tax
on $1000 will be $11 65\i. This will be an
additional tax of only 42^ cents per year
or a total payment of $4 26 on each $1000
worth of property, distributed over the
second ten years.
"This statement is based upon figures
furnished by the City Auditor."

Executive Committee.
The West Oakland Improvement Club
is divided upon the proposition. A long
discussion occurred at its regular meet
ing, and Colonel Irish opposed the issue
of bonds for park purposes. Auditor
Snow differed from the colonel.
"1 object to the whole thing," said
Colonel Irish. "I don't think that the
proposition is fair to the people of West
Oakland. It is proposed to take $488,000
out of the pockets of the taxpayers for
parks, streets and sewers for the benefit
of the people about the lake and give
West Oakland only $20,000 for the Improve
ment of its 11%-acre potato patch of a
park.
"The people of Oakland have not been
treated fairly with regard to the measure.
Had it not been for the action taken by
this club not a louu word would have
been spoken. This whole matter has been
urged under seal of secrecy and in a cor
ner. The advocates of this measure have
sought under silence to secure a vote in
its favor, trusting that no opposition
would thereby be developed. Mr. Adams
auks the people of Oakland to pay him
$4760 en acre for land that, when it was
assessed for $3000, he claimed to be an
excessive valuation, and went before the
Supervisors to get it reduced to $2000.
What is there bo sacred about the Adams
property that it should be treated differ
ently from others? Adams is ordinary
flesh and blood. I know him, and he has
the hereditary instinct for looking out
for his own interest."
A motion to favor the bonds was finally
passed. Colonel Irish stating that It was
understood the motion did not carry an
indorsement of the club. At a former
meeting the club opposed the bonds.
Friends of A. C. Berthier.
The employes of the leading wholesale
butchers of South San Francisco met last
evening at Myrtle Hall, Seventh and Rail
road avenues, and organized a club in
the interest of A. C. Berthler, Republican
candidate for Recorder. Judging from the
interest displayed Mr. Berthler has a
large number of friends in that section
of the city. The following named gen
tlemen were elected as officers: Presi
dent, W. Scheflian; vice president.

IN THE THIRTY -NINTH.
A Poorly Attended Meeting- in the
Interests of the Democratic
Candidates.
The Democrats in the Thirty-ninth As
sembly District did not rally to the meet
ing in Golden Gate Armory on Ellis
street last night, although two huge bon
fires were blazing in the vicinity and a
band of music played outside on the side-
walk, p
At no time during the meeting was the
hall more than half filled and the chair
man, Dr. T. L,. Mahoney, had several
times to beg the small audience not to
leave till the conclusion of the meeting.
The cheering and applause came from
about a dozen young men gathered to
gether in the rear of the hall.
Mayor Phelan was the principal speak
er. He made a long, rambling attack up
on bosses and corporations and declared
that he and the Democratic ticket were
fighting for the principle or popular rights
against corporate domination,
Barclay Henley, candidate for District
Attorney, asserted that all the respectable
and honest people in the city were sup
porting the Democratic party and all the
evil, sinister and damnable influences
were opposed to the party. He denounced
Buckley and Rainey and said it was to
get away from their influence that the
convention of One Hundred met to select
candidates, and it seemed to him as if
the selection was an inspiration from
above.
About twenty other candidates for office
addressed the meeting, but as a rule they
contented themselves with a few words
in regard to what they would do if
elected.
UNITED LABOR PARTY.
Supreme Court to Decide the Question
of Its Legal Existence.
An effort was made yesterday by tne
United Labor party to get the names of
Its candidates on the official ballot by ap
plying to the Supreme Court for a writ
of mandate. This political body on tne
18th inst. applied to Registrar Biggy to
have the names of its candidates placed
on the official ballot. The Registrar re
fused to do as asked, claiming that the
alleged party had not held a convention
and that the application by petition was a
fraud on its face. He said that a large
number of the names appearing thereon
were not the genuine signatures of the
persons that they pretended to represent
and that many of the other names were
obtained by fraud and misrepresentation.
Yesterday W. P. Grace, chairman of the
party's committee, applied to the Supreme
Court for a writ or mandate to compel
the Registrar to grant his demand. He
takes the position that the United Labor
party is an organization and at the last
election polled a per cent of the total vote.
He meets Biggy's objections by stating
that the Registrar has no right to go be
hind the certificates for his facts. He
says that If the matter Is not decided oy
the 29th inst. it will be too late and his
candidates will be barred by the fact of
the ballots being printed. Chief Justice
Beatty ordered that the writ issue, and
made it returnable to-day at 2 o'clock.
HOEY INDORSED.
Rattan Workers Offer Generous
Praise and Promise Support.
The Rattan Workers have adopted the
following resolution:
Whereas, The Rattan Workers' Protective
Union of San Francisco has existed twelve or
more rears, and its membership is entirely
composed of California residents of the Eigh
teenth Senatorial District; and whereas, during
that period and in that locality John A. Hoey
has been known toj us all; and whereas, he
has during ail this time -to our personal knowl
edge been the firm, unwavering and consistent
friend of labor, and especially a kind, inde
fatigable and sincere friend of this union, giv
ing It moral, political, social aud financial aid;
and whereas, he Is now a condtdate for Senator
from this district.
Resolveu, unanimously, That Irrespective of
party we as a body Indorse his candidacy and
urge his overwhelming election, being confi
dent that we will thus obtain an active, ener
getic and able man.

Henry T. Gage, Happy and Confident,
En Route to Vallejo.
Hon. iienry T. Gage spent half an hour
In this city yesterday, en route to Vallejo,
and shook hands with his friends. The
energetic labors performed by him dur
ing his recent tour of the State have left
no trace of fatigue, and Gage laughingly
remarked that he would willingly repeat
the task, together with what he has yet
to accomplish. The warm receptions and
the good sentiment which prevails every
where for the party is responsible to a
great extent for the high spirits of the
gentleman.
Th# Republican clubs eagerly await the
coming of Webster Davis, and it is safe
to predict that thousands will be turned
away from the doors of Woodward's Pa
vilion on Monday evening. Van R. Pa
terson has been selected to act as chair
man of the evening.
A Brophy Club.
At a meeting held in Berger's Hall, in
the Thirty-first District, attended by
about 150, a club was formed for the
purpose of advancing the interests of

nee for the Assembly in the Thirty-first
District. Speeches were made by Gus
Planz, P. Kerrigan, A. A. Friedlander
and others. The following officers were

In the Forty-Fifth.
A large Republican meeting was held
last night at 412 Jackson street in the
Forty-fifth Assembly District. The meet
ing was addressed by Judge A. B. Tread
well and Thomas F. Graham, Howard
Black and Edward Holland. The Troutt
quartet was received with great enthu
siasm. Colonel John H. Roberts spoke at
length on the issues of the campaign and
after mentioning the various candidates
urged the necessity of active, energetic
action for the success of the Republican
ticket from Gage down.
Slavic Republicans.
A large and enthusiastic meeting of the
Slavic Republican Club was held last
night at Alcazar Hall, OTarrell street.
There was an interesting address by J. J.
Calish touching upon the national, State
and local question. It was decided that
on some day next week a large ratifica
tion meeting of the club will be held for
Gage and Neff and the whole ticket.
Kahler Lectures on Art.
Joseph Kahler, chief of The Call's art
department, delivered a lecture before the
Good Samaritan Club at Second and Fol
som streets last evening. Mr. Kahler
told how the great dally newspapers were
Illustrated, and in a very interesting
manner explained this new and advanced
branch of Journalism from the first han
dling of the subject until the finished
production of the picture In the columns
of the paper. He said that the methods
and processes employed by the San Fran
cisco dallies are far more complete and
efficient than those introducel In any
other city of the United States, with the
exception of New York. As a finale to
his remarks, the artist touched upon the
subject of cartoons and converted the
features of some of the candidates in the
present campaign into ludicrous carica
tures. His address was enthusiastically
applauded.
Amateur Night at the Chutes.
The third "amateur night", at the
Chutes will take place this evening, when
a number of non-professionals will make
their first appearance upon any stage.
These occasions are unique and many
budding geniuses were discovered on the

ITS HEAD.
Movements and Whereabouts of

Suppress Them by Law.
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 26, 1898.
Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: A line would
be suffliclent to dispose of the communication
published in to-day's Call from the writer who
advocates the localization of the perpetrators j
of a misdemeanor If we considered it in itself, ;
but for the sake of the question with which
It deals we shall give it a little more atten
tion. In the first place we '--ye never favored ;
the diffusion of the evil under discussion. We
have demanded, as we had a right to demand,
its extinction. Why, therefore, does the writer
unjustly represent us as having declared our
selves in favor of diffusing it? His own
declaration that, "If, then, the example of God
is to be followed," and we hope he does not
think it a bad example, "the evil complained
of in this city should be stamped out on the
spit where it has existed from time immemo
rial," meets with our hearty approval, though :
we cannot say that we indorse his disapproval ,
of the means employed by God in blotting out
the evil trorn Bodom and Gomorrah. It we had
consulted with him before writing that ill-ad
vised letter we might not have classed thieves
with fornicators and adulterers and the disso
lute. Unfortunately St. Paul made the same
?nlstake. and as we have familiarized ourselves
with his epistles we may be pardoned for ex
pressing ourselves in a similar way. AYe are
grateful for the information that there was but
tine temple in Jerusalem, but we did not think
Jerusalem embraced Samaria, and besides our
divine Lord would peem more uncharitable if
he had lashed the thieves out o: the temple
and there was no other temple for them to go
to. St. Matthew spoke of "buying and selling
in the temple." If he had only used the word
"precincts" we doubtless would have copied
him, and our critic would not have had to men
tion the important distinction.
He says, "I refuse to believe that some of
the statements connected therewith have come
l'rom any clergyman." I take this opportunity
of assuring him that it is true "some of these
Htatements" did come from a clergyman and
he may no longer refuse to believe.
But, Mr. Editor, there are one or two state
ments In his letter that are worthy of serious j
consideration. 1 shall confine my remarks to ;
them. He says that he "had incontrovertible j
proof* that a movement was on foot to remove !
many of the fallen women from that area and
j 'lump them at our doors." I ask him In the
I name of the respectable citizens of the city of
San Francisco to furnish me with "incontro
vertible proofs" against the promoters of such
a scheme and I promise him that they will
' not be left free to attempt it again for some
â  time. No one can lawiuliy engage in such a
traffic. It is illegal. The Penal Codeâ sections
415 and 416 â makes it a misdemeanor, and it Is
unlawful to locate or impound a misdemeanor.
Because it is unlawful and a misdemeanor, it
Is the duty of every police officer of the Stateâ
and I may add of every good citizenâ to en
deavor to suppress tt.
To "impound" that which is immoral and
| unlawfulâ even if it could be doneâ would be to
j hold it up before our "virtuous mothers and
I maidens" and say that our city fathers, our
| local lawmakers, our local police officers, yea,
â  even our fathers and mothers, approved of the
vice, at least. In this limited way. But the
Legislature In its wisdom has made such a ;
thing impossible, and we are thankful that it i
has. If we admit that it is a necessity there i
is no argument for the virtue or the morality j
of man. Our monasteries, our convents, our i
colleges, our very homes, would be but store
houses of shame, society would be a mockery
and man would be no better than the ordinary
brute: animal passion would dominate reason,
marriage would be a farce and Christ a
failure.
These women are free, and because they are
free they are under no restraint except the
common law to which we are ail subject. They
can po and come as they please, they can live
as they pleaue. they can do as they please, pro
vided they do not violate the law. They are
not polleemtn, they are not soldiers, they are
not employes of ihe city, hence they are In no
way subject to the orders of our local legisla
ture as to their abode. If you attempt to set
apart a place for fallen women to carry on
their nefarious practices. It is but to extend
an Invitation to such women to come frum all
parts of the State and elsewhere, not to abide,
but to make this place a center from which
to disseminate their immorality and to estab
lish in our midst a veritable hell of all that
la vile and destructive of the morals of the
city. We do. Indeed, agree- with the writer
when he says "the evil complained of In this
city should be stamped out on the spot where
it has existed from time Immemorial."
Make these people behave themselvs a?
others do, and If the vice continues to exist, it
will not be because a public example 1b main
tained In the city.
The second statement, Mr. Editor, that
6trlkes ne as noteworthy in our critic's com
munication Is that he states he knows that
fallen women are in the neighborhood of Pine
and Dupont streets. He comes forward as a
witness and declares that such la the fact.
They are there. Does the Chief of Police
know It? If he does why are they permitted
tÂ« defy the law. Does the law not prohibit
the crime or misdemeanor, if you prefer? If
he does not know It where is he? In either
case is he doing his duty? Again we declare
that the Chief of Police is responsible for their
presence. And we ask the press of the city
to Join with us In forcing him to act or in get
ting him replaced by a Chief who will. He did
much when he was upheld by the senjtlment of
the community and we were grateful to him.
He seems to fear to act again. Why, we do
not know. He has left us to commence pro
ceedings and we have been forced to gather
evidence that will secure conviction in court,
fin last Monday an ordinance was Introduced
to closfe these resorts. Heretofore most of the
Supervisors have come forward In defense of
virtue and we have no reason to think that
any one will be able to "cajole" or "coerce"
them Into receding from the position that they
have taken. Yours gratefully.

Warrant for Miss Thropp.
Attorney Eugene Deuprey yesterday
morning swore out a warrant for the ar
rest of Miss Clara Thropp, the missing
star of the Comedy Theater. The war
rant charges Miss Thropp with embez
zling $500 from Manager Leavitt. The
money was loaned her. it is said, in order
that she might bring her company to this
city. As in paying the traveling expenses
of her troupe she acted as Leavitt's
agent, her failure to restore him the
money advanced is viewed as embezzle
ment.

PUBLICOLA ON CAMPAIGN ISSUES.
Good Reasons Why Honest and Intelligent Democrats
Should Oppose Maguire and Plielan.
San Francisco, Oct. 19, 1898.
To the Editor of the San Francisco
Call: The Call differs from some of
Its contemporaries. It does not force
its correspondents into absolute iden
tity with its own opinions. It actually
does tolerate among them some inde
pendence of thought and expression.
Tested by the standard of progressive
modern journalism, that carries weight
and influence and helps to form public
opinion, this tolerance is wise; but,
tested by the standards of sensational
ism, which exists chiefly for the grati
fication of vkiousness, it is a mistake.
A coward admires a bully who beats
a woman or a stripling, juet as a brute
adores a coarse sensualist, to whom ap
petite is the only god, and filthy no
toriety the sole equivalent for charac
ter.
Therefore, under the maxim "noscitur
a sociis," I must conclude that The Call
is right, and has a constituency that
really possesses manhood and is able
to comprehend American citizenship.
Inspired by this reliection, 1 request
you to allow me a little more space to
express my views of Jeffersonian De
mocracy, as related to the present can
vass, both State and municipal. I
have already had my say about the
platform of the late Democratic State
ention. I wish now to deal rather
more fully with the welded platforms
upon which Mr. Maguire and ihe re
ider of the fusion ticket havt been
nominated.
It must be conceded that a great
many citizens, who at least believe
themselves to be Democrats and to be
long to a political organization which
is within the constitution, which has
had definite views of constitutional in
terpretation, and which has a record
that largely enters into the history of
the country, will not vote for Mr. Ma
guire and his associates, and that
many of them, although they do not
believe in imperialism or in protection,
will vote for the Republican ticket.
These men are thinkers and readers,
with a strong inclination to support
party discipline, and they are not of
flce holders' or candidates. Therefore
they must have strong reasons for their
revolt against fusion. Let me briefly
explain what some of these reasons
are.
These Democrats wish to have a
Democratic candidate for the Presi
dency in 1900, and they are convinced,
referring particularly now to this
Stale, that, if the fusion ticket prevails,
the last page of Democratic success will
have been written. Apart from minor
ions, upon which ihe platforms
of all parties are virtually in harmony,
they are unable to discover a single
feature of true American Democracy in
the platform adopted by the late Dem
ocratic State Convention, and both
there and in the platform of the Pop
ulists they find revolutionary doctrines,
equally opposed to Democracy and to
Americanism. As I ventured to pre
dict in a former communication to The
Call, with ali its defects, they discover
more Democracy in the Republican
platform than has been offered to them
by the gentlemen who have assumed
the rig-ht to speak for the Democratic
party of the Union.
These Democrats refused to accept
the Chicago platform of 1*96 and the
candidacy of Mr. Bryan because in
their deliberate judgment both con
llicted with the fundamental doctrines
of American Democracy. They now ob
serve that the Chicago platform has
been formally re-enacted in this State
and therefore association with the
sound money Democrats of 1596 in
terms repudiated. They receive this
challenge with serenity and without a
quiver in their convictions. As Federal
Senators and Congressmen are to be
elected they consider the reiteration of
the declaration in favor of the free
coinage of silver at the ratio of sixteen
to one as an attempt to perpetuate a
national issue which would exclude
them from all participation in the party
to which they have been so long at
tached. The determined effort to sub
stitute cheap money in the form of sil
ver at double its bullion value for the
standard which has always been here
tofore enforced, to drive out gold, to re
duce wages, to confiscate indebtedness
and to increase the expense of living
the Democrats of whom I speak regard
as a breach of constitutional obligation
and a treacherous attack upon the
Democratic party and especially upon
this State, which, through its specific
contract law and the constant practice
of its people, is at the head of all hard
money communities. When to this Is
added a proposal to flood the country
with an irredeemable paper currency
under the absurd notion that value can
be created by legislation and this, too,
after the practical experience of the
civil war, the exasperated patriotism
of these Democrats will endure no
longer. They will never consent that
their country, through parties that
either do not comprehend or have aban
doned its institutions, shall be placed
upon even a lower footing among na
tions than Mexico, China and those
Central and South American States
which starve at home and buy gold at
an enormftis premium to pay their for
eign indebtedness.
But free silver is only one of the
anti-Democratic and anti-American
phases of the platforms which Mr. Ma
guire and his associates have indorsed.
The Initiative, the referendum and di
rect legislation are all expressions of
the desire to substitute the rule of an
irregular majority for the American
system, which secures both liberty and
order, under the supremacy of funda
mental principles and of established
law. The attacks upon the judiciary
are obnoxious to every citizen who was
trained In the school of conservative
Democracy and taught that the legis
lative department should make or
amend the law, that the judicial de
partment should declare it and that the
executive department should enforce it.
Government ownership of railroads and
acquisition of public utilities are a
mode of centralization and of enor
mously complicating the functions of
government and the opportunities for
corruption, which no Jeffersonian Dem
ocrat would even have been asked to
sanction until within the last few
years. The election of United States
Senators by the people in and of itself
would effect a revolution in our sys
tem and would be in line with the other
patent expedients through which
American Democracy has been invaded.
These are broad outlines of the neces
sity under which Jeffersonian Demo
crats of the type I recognize are liter
ally forced to antagonize the fusion
ticket, and, many of them at least, to
accept the Republican nominees. There
are two or three of these assaults upon
Democracy and Americanism, however,
to which a closer attention may be
beneficially paid.
Notably the referendum, the initia
tive and direct legislation are most
dangerous and even malignant inva
sions of the constitution. The British
Parliament is said to reach the ex
treme limit of power in a legislative
body and to respond quickly to popular
sentiment. But it Is only part of a
system, of which the crown is the cen
tral figure, and it is hedged in by an
unwritten constitution, established by
â statutes and by precedents, and also by
the traditions and the hereditary class
distinctions that exist among the Brit
ish people. Mr. Magulre and his asso
ciates, entirely departing from the prin
ciples of American Democracy, propose
in effect to concentrate authority in the
legislative department, and to place
that department under the direct su
pervision of what they term the peo
ple, acting through majorities. This is
an obliteration of the essential elements
of our American system of government
as declared by the courts and as con 1
strued and interpreted for nearly a
hundred years by the Democratic
party. The platform of the Populists,
which Maguire has accepted, and
which, so to speak, endeavors to hold
Itself in, so as to avoid the revelation
of the full purposes of Populistic lead
ers, is, nevertheless, incarnate Jacob
inism. A man who had suggested its
leading features in 1787 would have
been drummed out of the convention
that framed our Federal constitution.
Even the convention which formed the
present constitution of this State, crude,
entangled, cumbersome and detailed us
it is. would hardly have listened re
spectfully to men who would destroy
individualism and individual rights by
the sheer weight of numbers, and to
whom the very conception of property
in land, the most fertile source of pros
perity among the mass of the American
people, is revolting.
The genuine labor organizations of
the United States have never contem
plated, and would be among the last
to tolerate, so odious a revolution, which
would uproot our liberty and our or
der. And, while it is true that social
ism. \\ hieh is an importation from Eu
rope, is not in its principles, or as
taught by many of its leaders, directly
incendiary, and that it does not include
violence among its methods or as pai t
of its philosophy, it is also true that
disappointed socialists are easily con
verted into anarchists, and that the
most rabid advocates of the leading
ideas incorporated into the platform of
the Populists, and at least shadowed in
the platform which is labeled Demo
cratic in this State, are the men who
sympathized with the Haymarket out
rage in Chicago, or who as sandlotters
burned houses and threatened to burn
steamships in San Francisco. It would
be false, in my opinion, even to inti
mate that the body of Populists in Cali
fornia or elsewhere, or those of the
Democratic or Republican parties who
have betn touched by these proposed
innovations upon the constitution, are
intentionally or consciously opposed to
law or order, or that they intend to es
tablish their doctrines by force; but,
from my standpoint, it is perfectly cor
rect to urge that those doctrines are
antagonistic to the leading and most
vital principles of Americanism, and
that they represent the acrid discon
tent and attract the sympathy of the
uneducated and untrained elements of
population which have disturbed the
public peace, from Watt Tyler's
mob to Coxey's army. The very
genius of Americanism is the
perfected individual, capable of
being a law to himself, and, as
Herbert Spencer has demonstrated, this
is to be the highest product cf civiliza
tion, and the straining effort of ail mal
contents, of every sort, the common tie
which binds them together, is the ob
literation of individualism, which is the
converging point of every feature of cur
institutions that is distinctively Amer
ican and proclaims the inherent sov
ereignty of disciplined and self-poised
man, "vital in every part," coeval with
the origin of the race, surviving all the
catastrophes of history, and indissol
ubly linking the creature with the Cre
ator. The despotism of majorities, the
f.^sence of this attempted renaissance
of the French revolution, is the near
est approach to brute force and the
furthest remove from American consti
tutional liberty and order of which
modern development will admit.
The efforts which are daily made to
attract loose and thoughtless citizens to
the disconnected conglomeration of In
definite theories which is represented
by the fusion ticket would be amusing
if they were not so mischievous. It is
said that mistakes were made in the
conduct of the late war and some, like
myself, think the war itself was a mis
take, though it has poured glory on our
flag and intlamed the popular heart
with enthusiasm for conquest. But let
the mistakes be grantedâ is that a rea
son why Mr. Maguire should be elected
Governor of California? It is said that
the financial expedients adopted to de
fray the cost of the war were blunders.
Well! does it logically follow that Mr.
Maguire should win in the present can
vass? It is said that the railroad debt
should not have been treated as a mat
ter to be settled without litigation even
though Senator Morgan and Senator
White acquiesced and Congressman
Barham secured an additional guar
anty for foreclosure if the settlement
be not effected within a year. Well! is
that a reason for the election of Mr.
Maguire? The non-sequltur, or the ab
sepce of any connection between pre
mise and conclusion, was the main
characteristic of Mr. Bryan's -campaign
in 1896. It has been quadruplicated
this year until reason has almost been
scattered to th_> winds.
The single tax is pure confiscation
and a deception upon its face. Land
itself does not pay taxes, but it is the
basis upon which taxes are partly as
sessed and the money comes from the
rent. The single tax would transfer
the rent to the State, and with that
transfer private ownership would cease
in substance, and indeed virtually in
form. If this is not pure confiscation,
concentrating public burdens upon a
class, which includes farmers, horti
culturists and miners in the country
and a large number of landlords in
cities, and exempting from the public
burdens rich men, corporations and the
holders of personal estate and of im
provements on land, who could best af
ford to pay taxes, I would like Mr.
Maguire or some one else to explain
what It is. All the disquisitions upon
"unearned increment" and the other
cobweb arguments with which the State
has been flooded are destroyed by a
single fact, which every man whose
earnings are invested in land can see
as plainly as the nose on a human face.
It is said that the single tax is not an
issue. How can Mr. Maguire, candi
date for Governor, be separated from
Mr. Maguire's individuality, of which
the single tax is an incorporate part?
But the single tax, though not avowed,
is in the platforms. It is in the refer
endum. It is in the initiative. It is In
the local option proposition for munici
palities. And, while nominally dis
claimed, it has been persistently advo
cated since the fusion ticket was com
pleted, both orally and in writing. If
the constitution were or could be
amended so as to vest irresponsible
pow r er, without appeal, in a bare ma
jority, would not that cover the single
tax? I think the thousands of honest
citizens, who, through hard labor and
economy, have appeased, in America,
the "land hunger" which they con
tracted in Ireland or Germany or other
parts of Europe, will think twice before
they conclude that Mr. Maguire and the
single tax can be divorced or even tem
porarily separated.
These, however, shortly expressed,
are good and sufficient reasons for the
refusal of Jeffersonlan Demc-crats, of
whom I happen to hÂ« one,
to vote for the fusion ticket, so far as
State officers are concerned. Hut when
we consider the municipal situation the
case is no better. The Democratic mu
nicipal ticket is weighed down by all
the eccentricities of the State platforms
to which I have adverted and possesses
special demerits of its own. The des
potism of the Democratic State conven
tion in depriving San Francisco of all
Democratic representation in that body
has been underscored by the proceed
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 27, 1898.
ings in the selection of municipal can
didates. There has been no expression
of opinion by our local Democracy, un
less all power and all authority have
been delegated to Mr. Phelan and the
few men with whom he consults. I
have no disrespect for Mr. Phelan in
dividually, but his ideas of Democracy
and mine are as far apart as the poles,
and, on public grounds, I see vital ab
jections to the success of his personal
candidacy.
There is need in San Francisco for a
! higher standard of municipal govern
; ment. We have had a succession^ of
i bosses, with whom salaries at the City
Hall have been divided, ana by whom
young men. In order to gain a subsist
, ence fro-m the public service, have been
1 driven to the extremity of degradation,
i The field in which the taxpayer labors
! has been harvested and gleaned for the
benefit of a set of ignorant and licen
tious politicians, who would be con
temptuously driven from any business
enterprise which they undertook to
usurp and manage, until the descrip
tion of the prophet has almost become
locally applicable: "That which the
palm worm hath left hath the locust
i eaten, and that which the locust hath
I left hath the canker worm eaten, and
that which the canker worm hath left
hath the caterpillar eaten."
It is now proposed, as a remedy, to
i substitute for this regime a new form
of local despotismâ that of a wealthy
and ambitious Caesar, in whom all po
litical intelligence and virtue are as
sumed to be concentrated, and from
whom, therefore, all calls to office or
station should emanate. But both the
principle and the special application of
the principle are unsound and un-
American.
Mr. Phelan supports Mr. J. G. Ma
1 quire and the platforms on which the
i fusion ticket has been placed. Ttere
' fore this gentleman, who desires to re
â  tain the office of Mayor as a way sta
! tion to another destination, and who in
! that office would represent the substan
tial property-owners and business men
; of San Francisco, necessarily stands, if
not in his individual convictions, at all
; events by his formal indorsement, for
, the referendum, the initiative, the own
: ership of public utilities, including rail
; roads, by the Government, free silver
i at sixteen to one and the single tax, at
: least to the extent that it is covered by
i proposed amendments to the constitu
tion which Mr. Maguire and the fusion
ticket are pledged to support. In the
situation, as Mr. Phelan himself has
â  made it, how can he fairly escape from
i this dilemma? Mr. Maguire has ac
| cepted all these innovations upon the
i principles of the Democratic party and
I upon constitutional rights, as inter
! preted by all national parties, and Mr.
! Phelan has accepted Mr. Maguire and
become his champion on the stump. I
do not believe that it would be just to
say that, in his heart and in his mind,
he can indorse the anti-Democratic the
ory of government by tyrannical ma
jorities, which would tear up the roots
of our system, Federal and State. But
this concession makes the case so much
the worse for Mr. Phelan, because he
has allowed himself to be placed before
the people as a champion of the fusion
ticket, and especially of its head. If
Mr. Maguire should be defeated why
should Mr. Phelan be elected? What
honest answer can be made to this
question except that if one should fall
the other should fall with him?
And this is not all. It is a great mis
fortune to any commercial city to have
for its chief magistrate a man to whom
the honor is merely a stepping-stone
for ambition, and whose eyes are cen
tered, not on the plain duties that lie
about his feet, but upon a distant sta
tion, which all his energy is bent to
reach. A high municipal office may be,
and sometimes ought to be, the means
â  uf conducting a man who has fulfilled
I its obligations with exceptional ability
i and fidelity to a loftier sphere of action.
i But when a public officer substitutes
j his own will for the call of his fellow
i citizens and seeks to trample upon all
obstacles and crush others out through
' the opportunities which his office gives
: him, and thus force his way upward,
j then, in reality, that man must be and
jis a failure. He who does not wait for
j the summons, "Friend, go up hlgehr,"
but declares "I will go up higher," is
as obnoxious to the world as he is to
the gospel and is liable to find himself
in a lower room.
The "hefting" practice of Mr. Phelan
has been humorously treated in the
press. But innocent though he unques
tionably was of any design to neglect
his duty it proved a serious omission.
There was an incident in the history of
this municipality which ought to have
been a warning and to have been firmly
set In the minds of some of the gentle
men who gave Mr. Phelan his promi
nence in the Non-Partisan convention.
In 1874 a former Mayor of San Fran
cisco failed to count the money in the
city and county treasury, even by
"hefting," and his neglect almost cost
San Francisco a million and a half of
dollars. In connection with Judge Stan
ley and some other citizens, George K.
Fitch, the proprietor of the Bulletin
and part owner of The Call, through a
public meeting held at Plan's Hall,
saved that money. If It had been
counted it would never have been In
danger. If the law had been obeyed
by Mr. Phelan, and the count actually
made, Widber's defalcation might have
been averted.
I cannot of course speak for other
Democrats as to what they will do in
the municipal part of the election; but,
for my own part, looking solely to the
public good, I am as definitely in favor
of the election of Charles L. Patton as
I am opposed to the election of Mr. Ma
guire. I. have stated reasons which ap
pear to me to justify the defeat of Mr.
Phelan. I will state a few affirmative
reasons for the success of Mr. Patton.
He is a bright, energetic, thoroughly
honest man, native to our soil, and with
a sound professional and business train
ing. At all points he is Mr. Phelan's
peer. But he has special advantages
of his own. He is not a candidate for
Governor or for the United States Sen
ate. He is only an aspirant, at first re
luctantly, for the office of Mayor. He
has exhibited unusual executive ability,
the exact kind of ability needed in this
municipality; and, as Mayor, his mind
would a devoted to the discharge of
the duties and the fulfillment of the ob

TWO SHADOWS OF
FAMILY SKELETONS
OAKLAND, Oct. 26.â Charles Fisher, son of a prosperous restaurant
keeper, is missing, and his father believes that his son could throw
considerable light on a recent burglary at his home at Eleventh and
Webster streets.
When about to leave his home recently, early in the morning. Fisher
senior found one of the doors opened. He blamed his nephew, Gabriel, for
being careless, but the nephew was certain he had locked the door, and
was also positive that $14 50 had been taken from his pockets while he was
asleep. An investigation showed that the lock had been picked with a
piece of wire, and now Detective Holland is hunting for the burglar. Mr.
Fisher reluctantly says that he believes his son, who does not live at
home, can explain everything.
Mrs. Alice Thomas, a young and handsome woman, spent to-day in the
City Prison at her husband's request. The Thomases live in San Fran
cisco, and the husband is very anxious to help. his wife break off the habit
of drinking. Their life is one of happiness and tranquillity except when
the mania for drink breaks out in the wife. Yesterday Mrs. Thomas
crossed the bay to indulge her taste for alcohol and was soon found over
here by her husband. He was forced to ask for her arrest, as she was in
toxicated, but after he had made arrangements to take her to a liquor
cure sanitarium she was released. The ca.se is a very pitiable one, and
the couple are much attached to each other.
details committed to his charge. He is
a man of fine presence and courteous
manners, but concise and decided in at
tending to business. He is of a social
nature, with striking elements of popu
larity, but he would not be a popular
ity seeker. He would not try to reward
friends or to punish foes in the distri
bution of patronage. On all public oc
casions he would fully exhibit the hos
pitality and the dignity of San Fran
cisco; but he would not live or pose for
the public eye. If his candle burned so
that its light could be seen, it would not
be because he held it up, but because of
his work, and its results. I know Mr.
Patton well, and to know him is to re
spect him; but, if it had depended on
himself, he would never have been a
candidate. The suggestion of his name
was a happy inspiration. If he should
be elected, I am confident that he will
actually count the money in the public
treasury and that none of it will be lost
through any omission on his part, lie
is a clear talker and a sound reasoner,
but not an orator or a rhetorician. Like
Mr. Gage, he is a man of action, atten
tive, systematic, and eager to reach the
pith of every matter by the shortest
route. Eloquent speakers have rarely
made good Governors or good Mayors.
Sovereigns have frequently gone to sleep
in their carriages while a stream of mu
nicipal rhetoric was pouring into their
ears. I have a shrewd notion that Mr.
Patton's addresses would be very short
and pointed, and that, as Mayor, he
would have as little time for long dis
quisitions or learned essays as the head
of one of our great commercial or man
ufacturing establishments.
Altogether I look upon him as the
man for the place, and, as he does not
stand for free silver at sixteen to on<s,
for the referendum, for the initiative,
or for the single tax and is not trying
to climb a greased political rope, I hope
he may be successful.
It is recorded in the New Testament
that on a certain occasion some of the
disciples of Christ objected to a per
son who was not of their company
casting out devils in his name but he
rebuked them by saying that "he that
is not against us is for us." If the Re
publicans consider themselves the se
lect body of the righteous there is a
good lesson for them in this passage in
their dealings with those Democrats
who, for the sake of true Democracy
and for their country, are helping in
this campaign to cast out the devils of
Populism and of socialized Democracy,
that is, the Democracy of Europe and
not of the United States. They should
not abuse Democrats of this consti
tutional stripe, but welcome and ap
preciate their aid, even though in 1900
the result should be the reorganization
of the Democratic party on its ancient
foundation.
As I have referred to the New Testa
ment, permit me to close with the sug
gestion that it may be said of the fusion
Democrats, "But they * * â¢ have
transgressed the covenant," and of the
great Democratic party, so long as it
is victimized by unconstitutional ec
centricities, "Their heart is divided:
now shall they be found faulty."

A SPORTSMEN'S LEAGUE.
An Association Which Was Organ-
ized for the Protection of Clean
Sport.
A club known as the "California Sports
men's League" has been organized, and at
a meeting to be held this evening in Al
cazar building officers will be elected.
The club is non-politicai and its objects
are the protection and development of
such pastimes as hor.Â«e racing, coursing,
football, baseball, boxing and kindred
sports.
Although the club is yet in its Infancy,
it has a membership now of 4000 citizens,
who will endeavor to ascertain among
the candidates for oflice who of them are
opposed to sports and especially boxing
find horse racing. By-laws much of the
same nature as those of the London
(England) Sportsmen's Association will
govern the league. In London 163 mem
bers for Parliament who opposed boxing
as one of a series or sports mentioned
were defeated for office by the league
since its organization.

CLEVER PUGILISTS MATCHED.
Lavigne and Tracey Will Fight in
the Middle of November in
This City.
After meeting three times "Kid" La
vigne and Tom Tracey have finally agreed
upon fighting terms. Last evening Billy
Lavigne, on behalf of his brother, and
Al Smith, acting for Tracey, met the
directors of the National Athletic
Club. After considerable discussion
Lavigne agreed that the winner of
the proposed fight shall take 60 per cent
of the gross receipts and the loser /Â»
per cent. The date of the fight was fixed
for November 18 at Woodward's Pavilion.
The referee must be selected by ttie
contestants twenty-four hours before tne
contest, and should they fail to agree
upon any one person, the club will name
a referee. It is also stipulated In the
articles that the fighters must weigh 14
pounds at the ringside, and whichever
man breaks this contract must forfeit do
per cent of the 60 per cent they will bat
tle for. The club will select training quar
ters for the fighters, and a physician will
be engaged to visit the contestants occa
sionally and report their condition to the
club.
The contest should be one of the most
interesting affairs of the kind ever wit
nessed In this city, as both Tracey and
Lavigne are thorough masters of the
game.

BARON HIMFFSCH
CALLED "COME,"
AND SHE WENT
Miss Bouton Goes to
New York.
HER HAWAIIAN TRIP STOPPED
HAD EVERYTHING READY TO
SAIL ON THE CHINA.
Dr. Anderson Says New York's Cli
mate Will Kill the Actress.
Nevertheless She Obeyed
the Baron.
Madeleine Bouton has gone. The
charming young aotress left <>n the over
land train last night in obedience to a
peremptory telegram from her fiance.
Miss Bouton has been 111â seriously 111â
and when she began to recover somewhat
the desire for a change of air came over
her. San Francisco, she declared, was no
place for a convalescent, and she thought
a trip tv New York wouid do her Kood.
Dr. Winslow Anderson, her physician,
threw up his hands in horror at the
thought, and said "You go to New York
and you are a dead woman."
Now Miss Bouton did not like the idea
of dying, so she gave up the idea of go-
Ing to New York.
About this time Colonel George Macfar-
I'd.ne and several friends of Miss Koutoii
arrived from Hawaii. They insisted upon
a trip to Honolulu and said there was no
place like the Paradise of the Pacific for
building- up a broken down constitution.
iliss Bouton was charmed with the idea
and Dr. Anderson gave his consent.
Madeleine was delighted and wired her
fiance of her intended journey. "If you
are well enough to go to the "islands you
are well enough to come here," wired
back Baron Nimptseh In reply.
Miss liduton at once wired back that
the doctor said a journey across the con
tinent meant death. Then the Baron re
lented a little and sent back, "You can
g-o if you got a proper chaperon." The
chaperon was found, the Baron was sat
isfied, berths were secured on the steamer
China, trunks were packed and the hack
ordered to take the party to the M.'.il
dock, when a telegram from the Baron
arrived saying, in effect, that the Baron
wanted his fiancee to come East at once, i
climate or no climate.
The journey to the Paradise of the Paci- I
flc was dropped then and there, and that
was why the China sailed without Made
leine Bouton. She saw Dr. Anderson. I
again, and he reiterated his former state
ment, and Miss Bouton again wired the
Baron. Telegrams flew back and forth
all of last Wednesday and all Wedn<
night, and in the morning Miss Bouton
had decided to go back to New <irk in
spite of the doctor's warning. "I dread
this railroad trip," were the last words
she said as the train drew out of the Oak- !
land mole last night. She Is, however, !
buoyed up with the hope that as soon as i
the marriage takes place the Baron will j
take her to Italy to recuperate.

This Morning.
THE OHIO SAILS TO-MORROW
TO CARRY REMAINDER OF THE
WASHINGTON REGIMENT.
The Zealandia, Pennsylvania, New

Will Take the Remain
ing Troops. '
The transport Indiana will sail this aft
ernoon for Manila with the First and
Second Battalions of the Twentieth Kan
sas. These .troops will go aboard this
morning. The two battalions will leave
the Presidio just as soon as the tents are
dry enough to be packed. Colonel Funs
ton will be in command, and he will be
accompanied by his field and staff. The
only headquarters officer who will re
main for the present will be Lieutenant
Colonel Little, who commands the Third
Battalion. To-morrow morning the First
and Third Battalions of the First Wasb
i ington Regiment, which are now quar
tered at the Presidio, where they have
been doing- garrison duty, will go on
board the Ohio. This transport will sail
to-morrow afternoon. The departure of
i the Washington battalions will bring in
! from Fort Point the companies of the
Kighth California Regiment now en
camped there. These troops will perform
the garrison duty of the post.
After the departure of the Ohio there
will remain of the expeditionary forces
only the Third Battalion of the Kansas
Regiment, the Fifty-first lowa Regiment,
the Tennessee Regiment, a small detach
ment of the California Heavy Artillery
and General Marcus P. Miller, his staff
and headquarters. To carry these the
Government has at its disposal the trans

yet to be selected, will be sufficient to
take away these troops. It is thought
that the last of the Eighth Army Corps
will be gone before the middle of next
month. At department headquarters yes
terday nothing could be learned to con
firm the report published in the Chronicl
that the Wyoming Light Battery and th
troops of Nevada Cavalry had been in

GRAND JURY MAY
INDICT MRS. BOTKIN
HEE CASE WILL BE TAKEN UP
TO-DAY.
Chief Lees Hopes to Take His Pris
oner to Delaware for Break
ing Postal Laws.
The Grand Jury will convene this af
ternoon and upon the suggestion of As
sistant District Attorney Hosmer will
Investigate the case of Mrs. Cordelia Bot
kin with the object of finding an indict
ment aguinst her upon the charge of
murdering Mrs. John P. Dunning.
The Grand Jury's action in the matter j
will be solely upon the suggestion of Mr.
Hosmer. Chief Lees and Detective â¢Mc-
Vey have cut loose from the District
Attorney's end of the prosecution and
are lending their energies to no scheme
that has not for its object the removal
of Mrs. Botkin to Delaware for trial.
With this in view Lees has resorted to
j the United States postal laws in the hope
! that there he may iind some charge upon
i which Mrs. Botkin may be arrested and
i taken back to Delaware. Once in the
jurisdiction of that State, he argues, the
' postal charge could be dismissed and the
I original charge of murdering Mrs. Dun-
I Ding could be substituted.
Under section 327 the Federal statute
j makes it a misdemeanor, punishable by
: a fine, to include any writing in mail
i matter of the fourth class. The statute
i is part of the act of Congress of March,
| 1H79. The statute also provides that a
violation may be prosecuted either at the
I place where the package was mailed or
at the place of its destination.
It will be remembered that the box
of candy which was sent to Mrs. Dun
ning also carried a note, alleged to have
been in the handwriting of Mrs. Botkin,
with the phrase "With love to yourself
and baby, Mrs. C." written in it. As a
box of candy Is classed as mail matter
of the fourth class the laws pertaining I
to such were clearly broken, according ;
to the provisions of the statute.
To this statute there are two drawbacks
that render it of no potency. The first 1b
that the Supreme Court has time and
again reversed decisions that were gained
by just Buch uses of the Government's
processes. If Mrs. Botkin were arrested
in this Jurisdiction upon a misdemeanor
charge on a Federal court warrant and I
taken back to Delaware for trial the I
fraud would immediately become appar
ent if the charge were dismissed and she '
rearrested for murder. By writ of habeas
corpus she could regain her liberty upon
that showing, according to the decisions i
of the Supreme Court.
The second weakness of the statute is j
that it provides for trial In either place
the package is mailed or the place where
It is received. In cases of this sort, where
the alternative trial is provided for, the
State in which the arrest is made has a 'â 
prior right over the prisoner, and it has !
never been decldedthat any prosecuting !
officer has the right under the law to i
waive the rights or his State.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 27, 1898.
HUNDREDS LOOK ON AT A DROWNING.
John Owens, a Driver for the Gayer Dairy, and His Horse and Wagon, Went
Overboard From Jackson Street Wharf and Both Man and Animal Lost
Their Lives.
A FATALITY that might have been averted occurred at Jackeon-street wnarf yesterday. A young man drowned
1n full view of a hundred men, each one of whom was telling the other to "go to his assistance." John Owens,
a driver for the Gayer Dairy, 1212 Ellis street, went down to Jackson-street wharf to look for a load of milk.
When he got to the end of the pier he found It crowded with wagons, and attempted to turn and go back.
Martin Picken, who was working close by, told him he could not turn in the space and warned him that both horse
and wagon would go into the bay. The- only answer he got was to mind his own business. Owens made another at
tempt, and in a moment man, horse and wagon were overboard.
Near where Owens was trying to turn his wagon there was an open chute, used by the small river steamers
while loading. In turning, the horae got its forefeet on the incline, and in a moment all was over. The horrified by
standers called upon Owens to jump, but his presence of mind was gone, and he did not move. As the wagon followed
the horse into the bay It turned over, and in doing so Owens must have been struck, for when he came to the surface
he only made a feeble effort to swim. He rose and sank three times, while the onlookers did nothing but shout'at each
other.
Xo one was willing to get his ciothes wet In an effort to save a fellow-creature, but one man called out, "Go and
get Frank Dezalla; he's the best swimmer on the front." Frank wan working on the wharf and was brought to the
scene In a hurry. He at once began disrobing, but as he was taking his last shoe off Owens went down for the last
time. Shortly afterward boatmen with grappling-irons were at. work, and the body was recovered and removed to the
Morgue. Then the horse and wagon were brought to the surface. The harness was taken off the dead animal and it
was allowed to drift out with the tide, while the wagon and harness were hoisted to the wharf.
THE CRUISER
PHILADELPHIA
IS LEAKING
Will Drydock for an
Overhauling.
WAS BOOKED FOR SAMOA
SHE WILL NOW GO TO THE NAVY
YARD INSTEAD.
British Ship Glenericht That Was in
Collision With the Balmoral
Will Probably Be Con
demned.
The cruiser Philadelphia will not go to
sea for some mouths to come. Instead of
starting away under sealed orders for
Samoa she will go to the navy yard to be
thoroughly overhauled and have several
leaks that are now causing trouble
stopped. In order to do this she will have
her coal and ballast removed and will
then be put on the dry dock. One or two
of the plates will have to be fixed up,
perhaps removed, and the hawse pipes
wili have to be looked to, as they take in
water during heavy weather.
ThÂ© Philadelphia arrived here from
Honolulu on October 14, 1897, after a long
term of service- In the southern seas. At
that time she was booked for a thorough
overhauling and in consequence her crew
was drafted into other ships and she was
dismantled. Then came the war with
Spain, and the work of getting the cruiser
ready for sea was begun and rushed to
a completion. By the time she was ready
to go into commission the war was prac
tically over, so she was sent to Honolulu
with Admiral Miller to hoist the stars
and stripes over Hawaii. She left here
on July 27 and returned again on the Bth
inst.
During this voyage it was found that in
heavy weather the Philadelphia made
water and the steam pumps had to be
brought into service to keep her clear.
The leaks are not serious but still they
are bad enough to make it unwise to send
the big warship on a cruise in the south
err; seas without an overhauling. When
the orders came to coal ship and get
ready for sea, therefore, the facts of the
case were laid before the authorities at
Washington. The orders were at once re
scinded and the cruiser will go to Mare
Island to-morrow. About 150 tons of coal
has been taken into her bunkers, but
this will probably all be used up in keep
ing steam on the donkey boilers and sup
plying the launches before the Philadel
phia goes on the drydook. The chances
tire now that the gunboat Wheeling will
be sent to Samoa or on whatever mission
the Philadelphia was to have sailed.
The steamer Greenwood, which started
on her usual coasting trip last Tuesday,
had to return to port yesterday on ac
count of having broken a crank pin.
The British ships Balmoral and Mada
gascar raced here from Swansea and the
latter won by a few hours, owing to a
streak of luck and a light breeze. The
British 9hip Falls of Halladale and the
Italian ship Macdiarmid also raced herG
from Hull, and while the Macdiarmid
reached port yesterday the Falls of Hal
ladale is still 300 miles off shore. There
was a big difference in the sailing time
of the two races, as the Madagascar-Bal
moral event only occupied 135 days, while
the Macdiarmid was 153 days getting
here. The Falls of Halladale has prob
ably been within sight of the Farallones
for a couple of days and yet it may be
another day or two before she gets in.
The steamer Sausalito broke down on
one of her morning trips and the San
Rafael had to take her place. A link in
the steering gear broke and caused the
withdrawal or the ferry boat for one
round trip.
The German bark Henry Hackfeld
which left here 166 days ago for England,
has not been heard from and 5 guineas
per cent reinsurance is being paid on her.
She was built in 1865 and was formerly
the bark British Nation, The British ship
Lauralbank Is now out 55 days from
Shanghai for Astoria and 15 per cent re
insurance is being paid on her, while 85
per cent is being paid on the American
ship David Morgan, now out 213 days from
New York for Nagasaki.
The British ship Glenericht, which was
in collision off the Horn with the Bal
moral, is still at Montevideo. No repairs
have been made on her and she is to be
condemned if the special agent sent out
by the underwriters cannot arrange a
purchase. Captain Davies of the Glene
richt was so certain that his wife was
cafe o-n the Balmoral that he sent his
elster here to meet the ship. She was
broken-hearted when she heard that Mrs.
Davies lost her life in the collision.
A STEAMER SEIZED.
Lieutenant Butt and the Revenue
Cutter Took Possession of a
Rebellious Craft.
The steamer Laurada, the old Havana
blockade runner, created some excitement
on the city front yesterday afternoon.
At 2 o'clock Deputy United States Mar
shal Littlefield went on buard the steamer
with the papers in the libel suit of F. E.
Mathieson to recover $110 and a few odd
cents for pilot fees. Littlefield served the
papers in clue form and placed J. W. Dur
kin in charge as keeper. Captain Fisher
said he didn't care a darning needle for
the writs, that the steamer was already
in the hands of a receiver and that as
soon as he could discharge her cargo of
wheat he would pull up anchor without
waiting to heft it and skip out for Port
land.
Littlefleld reported the rebellion of the
captain to Marshal Shine and the rosult
was that Collector Jackson ordered Navi
gator Butt to prevent the Laurada from
leaving port. The navigator drew the
revenue cutter alongside the Laurada and
boarded her in all the pomp and panoply
of war. declaring that he would put a
bullet through the carcass of any one
who would attempt to defy the Govern
ment. Deputy Marshals Farish and Mof
ntt came to the rescue with revolvers and
handcuffs. When the captain reappeared
after a temporary absence, the matter of
the receiver was explained and it was
found that the attorneys had made a mis
take. Lieutenant Butt was withdrawn
from the bloodless contest of words and
the Laurada was allowed to start for
Portland.
NEW RAILROAD LINE STARTED.
Work Commenced on the San Bruno
Road Branch of the Folsom-
Street Une.
Chief Constructor H. H. Lynch of the
Market Street Railroad Company made a
start yesterday morning: on the San Bru
no road branch of thn Folsom street elec
tric car line. At 8 o'clock 100 men with
necessary teams congregated at the junc
tion of Army street and Precita avenue
and at once broke ground for the branch
line that will, when complete, connect the
people of the San Bruno road with the
city proper by means of a direct electric
car service. The proposed line will con
nect with Folsom street at Precita ave
nue and Folsom street and continue along
Precita avenue to Army street, running
along that thoroughfare until the San
Bruno road is met, when the line
will continue along that roadway as far
as the terminus of the present horsecar
service, returning over the same route
until Army street is reached, when the
line will continue along that street until
Folsom street Is met, where connections
will be established and the line continued
direct to the ferries. It is the present in
tention of Superintendent Vinfng to have
a ten-minute service from Folsom and
Precita avenue over the San Bruno road
line. The cars for this new addition to
the Market street system will run along
Precita avenue to San Bruno road return
ing over Army street, thus tapping Pre
cita Valley on both sides from Fol6om
street eaat to Army.
The addition of this Hne will be appre
ciated by the people living on the line of
the San Bruno road, as under tho present
system of travel, the horsecar, it requires

out leaves Twenty-fourth street and Po

BONDSMEN OF
SCHOOL BOARD
TO BE SOED
Grand Jury Decides
on a Plan.
WILL PUSH A CIVIL CASE
ONE JUROR IS TO ACT FOR THE
CITY.
Suit to Recover the Money Over-
Expended by the Board of Edu
cation During the Present
Year.
The chances are that the members of
the School Board will be treated to a dis
agreeable surprise within a few days. It
is the present intention of the Grand Jury
to take radical action looking to the
speedy recovery from the bondsmen of
the School Trustees of the amount of
money over-expended by the Board of
Education so far during the present fiscal
year. The Grand Jury construes the law
to forbid, under the one-twelfth limita
tion act, a mass of expenses which have
been piled up recently aggregating close
on to $100,000, if not more. It is the con
tention of the jury that the board had
no right to pay last year salaries of
teachers during the present year, as was
done, nor had it the right to pile up heavy
expense bills for furnishing Mission High
School, without having the funds on hand
to pay for the same.
The plan of operation proposed by the
Grand Jury is novel. Citations will at
once be sent to various members of the
School Board and creditors of the board,
directing them to appear and testify con
cerning the unpaid accounts. As soon as
it is legally ascertained that the Board
of Education is in debt over and above
the lawful amount allowed by the one
twelfth act, the jury will appoint one of
its members as a private citizen and tax
payer, to institute proceedings in the
courts against the bondsmen of the School
Directors, to recover the full amount
Prior to taking this step the Grand
Jury will report its findings of misman
agement of the school funds to Judge
Belcher, expecting to receive from him
the advice to go ahead and prosecute the
bondsmen. This idea is an outgrowth of
the Judge's recent action advising the
Jury to enter the Police Court and prose
cute the school lumber thieves, if it could
not indict them for trial in the Superior
Court. In the present case the Grand
Jury does not see its way clear to in
dict the members of the board for over
expending money but it does see how to
reach them legally through their bonds-
men.
The probabilities are that Chairman Ir
ving, of the Grand Jury's committee on
schools, will 'be the agent deputized to
act in bringing the suit. The fact that
this policy has been determined upon
comes from unquestionable sources. The
Botkin murder case, which comes before
the jury this afternoon, will first be dis
posed of, and then the action proposed
against the School Board will be taken
up.
After the school cases are finished the
Grand Jury will consider the alleged for
geries in connection with the election peti
tion of the United Labor party. Then the
Supervisors' gas contract will be taken
up, and other matters pertaining to tnat
| Board will receive careful attention. From
, evidence now in possession of the commit
! tee on Mayor, City Hall Commission and
Board of Supervisors, it is believed that
j a hot roast and several Indictments will
j be served up at the same time.
Surrendered Themselves.
Edward D. Swift, lumber merchant, and
John J. O'Brien, Inspector of Schools,
who were indicted by the Grand Jury on
a charge of defrauding the city of money,
surrendered themselves at the City-
Prison yesterday morning and were re
leased on $5000 bonds.

The Society of Old Friends has, through
its committee on entertainment, arranged

next Wednesday night in Washington
Hall. One of the features of the evpninr

tion of T. Tregellas.
NO CLEW TO
THE MISSING
STANFORD MAN
Goetz's Whereabouts
a Mystery.
DID HE GO TO MEET A MAN?
LEFT HIS VALUABLES ' WITH
MBS. CLARK.
The Missing Man Was Working His
Way Through College and
Was in His Junior
Year.
Mystery still surrounds the sudden dis-
appearance of Adolph Goetz, the Stan
ford man. The friends of the missing
student have made every effort to locate
him and have called to their aid the Ala
meda police.
Up to last evening no clew had been
obtained as to his whereabouts and the
case remains shrouded in the deepest
mystery. Mrs. A. H. Clark, 1417 Sherman
street, Alameda, was the last person, so
far as is known, to see Goetz. The lady is
filled with alarm for the safety of her
friend, and is positive that the young
man must be either dead or so situated
that he is unable to communicate with
her, otherwise Mrs. Clark is positive the
student would certainly let her know
as to his safety and his whereabouts.
"Goetz is a remarkably frugal young
man," said Mrs. Clark yesterday, "and
so far as hia friends know had neither
bad habits nor vices. He was working
his way through college and was in his
third â the junior year. So far as I know
he had no enemies. He had but few
lady friends; in fact, he was rather diffl
[ dent in seeking the society of young
i women. He came to see me on Saturday
I evening, arriving about 9 o'clock. We
i chatted for some time, and then Goetz,
suddenly alarmed at the lateness of the
hour, declared he must go to see a friend
I whom he had promised to meet on Park
I street any time between y and 12 o'clock.
J I remonstrated with him as to the late
ness of the hour, and advised him to let
the meeting go until the next morning.
He was obdurate, however, and said he
could not break the appointment. There
upon he left, promising to be back in less
than half an hour."
A peculiar feature of the case is that
the missing man before he left the Clark
residence gave his watch and chain and
return ticket to Palo Alto to Mrs. Clark
for safekeeping. The placing of his val
uables in the possession of Mrs. Clark
came about so naturally that there was
nuthing in the transaction to arouse the
suspicions of the lady.
"Goetz showed me his watch," said Mrs.
Clark, "as he was very proud of it. He
said it had been given to him by the
King-Richardson Publishing Company of
San Joee as a reward for faithful serv
ice. Goetz during the summer vacation !
had been canvassing for the firm, and
the watch was their token of esteem for
the highly satisfactory way in which
Â» performed his duties. Goetz took
the watch for me to examine and
rward did not put it on, but let it
lie upon the table. It was the same way
with the ticket. He placed it quite casu~ j
ally beside the watch, where he also put
Rhite embroidered silk handkerchiefâ
ft from me to him last Christmasâ a
which he recalled to my remem-
Mrs. Clark met Adolph Goetz three
years ago at Palo Alto when she was em
ployed down there in the students' res
taurant. After serving about three
months at the restaurant Mrs. Clark con
tinued at Palo Alto, attending lectures
at the university. The lady, who is a
widow and quite elderly, is now making
her living by doing seamstress work.
Goetz was in the habit of calling upon
Mrs. Clarke every two or three months
and usually remained from Saturday un
til Sunday, and sometimes until Monday.
When he called on Mrs. Clark on Satur
day he informed the lady that he had
been in San Francisco during the day
attending to business, the nature of which
he did not explain.
The missing student has no relatives In
these parts. His only brother, Christian
Goetz, is a member of the Fourteenth
Infantry, Company X, now serving In
Manila.
At Stanford Goetz has always been
known for the peculiarity of his habits.
He was always alone and seemed desi
rous of keeping entirely to himself. In
class he sat by himself, and so far as is
known he had no intimate friends here.
He was extremely poor, and lived by
himself in the "pigeon" house, a small
structure on the Mayfleld road. He did
not have the name among his professors
of being a bright student, but one who
got his work by dint of hard labor. To
secure funds to help himself along in col
lege he did housework in the families of
the professors. Before coming to Stan
ford Goetz was graduated from the West
Indiana Normal School, where he was
a student for three years.
Held for Criminal Assault.
Louis Vonnuccl, a bootblack, was yesterday
held by Judge Low to answer before the Su
perior Court on a charge of criminally assault
ing Ethel G. McCarthy, a girl 6 years of age,
at Ellis and Larkin BtrÂ°<ns on October 17. His
bonds were fixed in $5000.
