VOLUME LXXXIII.-XO. 37.
GERMANY MAKES A LEASE
THE PRETEXT FOR TAKING
THE PORT OF KIAOCHAU
GIBRALTAR OF THE CHINESE COAST.
Principal battery on the shore of Talien Bay, fifteen miles from Port Arthur.
This fortification is on an elevation overlooking the bay and is defended by ordnance
of heavy caliber. It controls the entrance to the Gulf of Pechili and in the hands
of Great Britain would render harmless the occupation of Port Arthur by the
Russians, It was captured by the Japanese in the late war with China. Foreign
officers who have inspected the forts of Talien rate them superior to those of Aden,
Gibraltar or Cronstadt. The picture is drawn by a Call artist from a photograph
taken by an officer of the engineer corps of the Japanese army.
PEKING, Jan. 5. â The Kiaochau difficulty was settled yes
terday at a conference of the Tsung Li Yamen, which made the
necessary concessions.
LONDON, Jan. 5. â A dispatch to the Times from Peking,
dated Wednesday, says Germany has taken a lease of Kiaochau
for fifty years. It says also the report is current there that a
French occupation of Hainan Island is imminent.
BERLIN, Jan. sâ The Reichsanzei
ger this evening announces that ac
cording to a telegram from Peking an
understanding has been reached be
tween Germany and China regarding
the cession of Kiaochau Bay to the
former. The arrangement, it is added,
is substantially as follows:
It is intended by the cession to render
possible for Germany the fulfillment of
her Just wish for the possession, in the
same way as other powers, of a base
of trade and navigation in Chinese
waters.
The cession of Kiaochau Bay to Ger
many takes the form of a lease for an
Indefinite time. Germany is at liberty
to erect on the coded territory all the
necessary buildings and establish
ments and to take the measures re
quired for their protection.
Continuing the RHohsanzeiger says:
"The ceded territory comprises the
whole of the inner basin of Kaiochau
Bay as far as the high-water line, the
larger headlands situated south and
north of the entrance of the bay to the
point where they are naturally bound
ed by mountain ranges, and also the
Islands situated within and front of
the bay. No obstacles are to be raised
by China to any measures Germany
may deem necessary for the regulation
of the watercourses. China has trans
ferred to Germany for a period not
stated in the telegram a lease of sov
ereign rights over the ceded territory.
"If for any cause Kiaochau Bay
should prove unsuitable for the objects
Germany has in view, China, after ar
riving at an understanding with Ger
many, will cede another piece of terri
tory on the coast which Germany may
regard as more suitable for her pur
pose."
LONDON, Jan. 6.â The Times edi
torially says this morning: "It would
be simple to assume that the Reichsan
zeiger's dispatch tells the whole story,
for It quite omits to say what China
gets In return. To the world at large,
however, the material fact is that Ger
many, by physical force, has obtained a
naval station. This is the fact that
must guide other powers In determin
ing their own policy.
"The talk of a lease is a mere sav
ing of appearances. There is no doubt
that both Germany and China are
aware that it Is a practical cession in
full sovereignty. It provides further
argument In favor of an English guar
anteed Chinese loan."
The morning paper editorials general
ly are in the same strain as that of the
Times. They point out that the con
tract Is one in which Germany appar
ently gets everything and China noth
ing, while the question of the safety of
the missionaries is entirely dropped.
Nothing is said about railways or
mines.
The question has been raised here as
to Herr Detrlng's right to succeed Sir
Robert Hart as director of Chinese
imperial maritime customs.
The Daily Chronicle says: "The
agreement upon which the last Chi
nese loan was floated in England con
tained a clause declaring that the man
agement of the customs should remain
The San Francisco Call
as now, which was interpreted to meaJi
that they should be in the hands of an
Englishman."
The paper believes that England
would not accept Herr Detring as Sir
Robert Hart's successor.
The Standard says editorially: "Eng
land need not be ruffled, because she
can claim exactly the same privileges
as Germany. This is the logical and
unassailable position the Government
has taken up; and it Is not astonishing
to find that it has made a profound im
pression in Europe, as well as had a
satisfactory reception in America.
Whatever Mr. Sherman may say, the
mercantile community is well aware
that England, in claiming equal rights
for all, is fighting the battle of the
American merchants and traders as
well as that of her own subjects."
The Daily Mail, commenting upon the
"fact that the United States and Japan
are openly on our side in the Chinese
affair," says: "For once we are getting
some recognition for our generous com
mercial policy."
There is a general feeling .n England
and it is reflected on the stock ex
change that the situation in the far
East is improving. It is bettered the
proposed Chinese loan of Â£16,000,000 will
be guaranteed by the British Govern
ment.
The Pall Mall Gazette this afternoon
refers to the "ascendency of money
over the mailed fist," and says: "Great
Britain's vessels are anchored off Che
mulpo and at Port Arthur. This is
quietly Implying that Great Britain
will have a voice in future arrange
ments. Further, the latest telegrams
clearly indicate that she has plenty of
friends."
The Pall Mall Gazette continues:
"Aside from Japan, nations like the
United States, whose interests are
purely commercial, are well disposed
toward our Government and are op
posed to trade excluslveness."
Ernest Terah Hooley, who negotiated
with China simultaneously with the J.
Pierpont Morgan and other syndi
cates, is not concerned in the present
loan.
Special dispatches from Shanghai to
day say that J. McLeavy Brown, the
British Corean Customs Agent at
Seoul, maintains a firm hold on his
post, and that M. AlexiefT, the Russian
Agent, who has been endeavoring to
supplant him, has been unable to ob
tain control of the finances, owing to
the fact that all the funds are vested
in Mr. Brown's name in the Hong
kong Bank at Shanghai, which insti
tution honors Mr. Brown's signature
only.
The negotiations between Sir Claude
McDonald, the British Minister at
Peking, and the Tsung LI Yamen with
reference to the questions arising from
the Russian occupation of Port Ar
thur, are proceeding.
The idea of an alliance with Great
F-itain is reported to have excited in
tense enthusiasm in Japan. The Mar
quis Ito's Cabinet, It is added, will en
deavor to promote an Anglo-Japanese
alliance.

THE AMERICAN FLEET
IN ASIATIC WATERS
TO BE STRENGTHENED.
The President Has Also Determined That He
Will Send a Strong Man to the
Chinese Mission.
NEW YORK. Jan. 5.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Tele
graphic orders were to-day sent to
Commander A. Walker, commanding
the gunboat Concord, directing him to
proceed with the vessel under his com
mand to the Asiatic station and report
to Commodore George Dewey, its
commander in chief. The Concord will
stop at Honolulu en route and ought
to arrive in Japanese waters within a
month. The American- force on the
Asiatic station at the time of her ar
rival will be composed of the Olympia,
the flagship of th<' station; the Boston,
which is at Chemulpo, Korea; the Ral
eigh, which is now en route to the
Asiatic station and is exported at Aden
in a few days; the Petrel, >-n route to
Canton; the Monocacy, which is at Woo
Sung. The Helena, which sailed from
Bermudas on December 30 for Funchal,
is not expected to reach the Asiatic
station before next fall.
Captain A. F. <'rowninshield, chief of
the Bureau of Navigation, t<>!d me to
day that with the addition of the Ral
eigh and the Concord he thought the
naval force of this Government in
Asiatic waters would be ample to pro
tect American Interests.
The muddle the administration has
got into over the Chinese mission will,
according to the present plan, be
solved by the transfer of Dr. James
B. Angell from Constantinople to Pe
king and the appointment of Charles
Page as Minister to Turkey instead of
China.
Mr. Bryan, I understand, has been
sounded on the question of acepting
the Turkish mission, and says that he
will accept it in view of opposition
which has developed against his ap
pointment to China. The fact that Mr.
Bryan's nomination was formally laid
before the Senate to-day and referred
to the Committee on Foreign Relations
was something of a surprise to the
I'rtsident. As previously stated in the
Herald, it was sent to the Senate be
fore the holiday recess, but before it
was formally laid before that body the
President received such strong protests
from Senator Frye and others that he
asked the Vice-President to temporar
ily withhold it. Some days afterward,
during the recess, the President decid
ed that notwithstanding the opposition
he would carry crut the promise he had
made to Secretary Gage. Senators Cul
lom and Mason, and other friends of
Mr. Bryan, and would allow the nomi
nation to take its course. Since then,
however, the question of the transfer
was taken under advisement, but prob
ably through an oversight the Presi
dent failed to inform the Vice-Presi
dent of that fact.
Now that it is known the President Is
considering the transfer, the commit
tee will delay action, and when all ar
rangements have been made it will be
Just as easy to recall the nomination
from the committee as from the Vice-
President's hands.
The increased importance given to
i the Chinese mission by reason of the at
| titude of the European powers toward
that country is the main reason for the
desire of the President to make the
transfer he has in mind.
ABOUT TO DOCK
THE CLEVELAND
Will Soon Be Running Again
Between Tacoma and
This Port.
Indians Tell of Wreckage Believed
t6 Be From the Second
Mete's Boat.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Jan. s.â The steamer
Cleveland arrived at Quartermaster
Harbor drydork to-day and will be
docked Friday, fo-morrow the steam
er Skiisrit Chief will go alongside her
and take aboard her freight for Taeo
ma and Seattle. A large part of this
Is floating around in the hold abso
lutely worthless and will be dumped
overboard.
Captain Hall reports that on Sun
day, Just before he left Barclay Sound.
Indians reported to him the finding: of
what is believed to be wreckage from
Second Mate Henderson's boat, which
is Ptill missing with six men. The In
dians claim to have found i(rt of the
boat, n cracker box and wine clothing
on the beach two miles farther north
than Captain Hall and his men search
ed for the mining boat. The tugs Czar
and Tyee were then fastened to the
Cleveland ready to tow- her to Victo
ria, and he had no chance to person
ally investigate. He considers the
story plausible.
Neap tides were so high where the
steamer Cleveland was beached that
plates had to be bolted over the holes
in her bottom by a diver. Her beach
ing and repairs here, it Is estimated,
will cost $15,000. She is accompanied
here by Mr. Tyson, her manager; Cap
tain Metcalf, Lloyds' surveyor at San
Francisco, and Captain Cartmel,
Lloyds' engineer and surveyor at Vic
toria. It was reported to-day that the
Cleveland had been sold to the Cana
dian Pacific Navigation Company for
its Victoria and "Wrangel route. Mr.
Tyson to-night denies this and says
she will again run between San Fran
cisco and Tacoma.
FALLS SIX HUNDRED
FEET DOWN A SHAFT.
Frightful Death of Captain Hall, Superinten
dent of the Leroi Mine at
Rossland.
ROSSLAND (B. C), Jan. s.â Captain
Hall fell from the surface to the 600
foot level to-day in the Leroi mine.
His body was crushed almost beyond
recognition. He had been making his
daily inspection of the mine and com
ing to the surface stepped from the
skip to a narrow beam dividing the
double compartment shaft. He lost
his footing and plunged down to death.
Captain Hall was a native of Ire
land, aged 61 years. For seventeen
years he was superintendent of the
Alice mine, near Butte. He leaves a
widow and live children in this city.
The remains will be taken to Butte for
burial.
The only witness of the tragedy was
the engineer. He saw Mr. Hall stumble
and fall, catch desperately at the tim
bers and vanish into the pit. A man
working on the 300-foot level, near the
shaft, heard â  cry and saw a lleeting
glimpse of the falling form. The alarm
was given and men descended imme
diately to the 600-foot level. The body
had fallen across a skip and was man
gled beyond recognition

Coryrlgrht, IS9S. by James Gordon Bennett.
HAVANA, Jan. 5. â All Havana was
talking this morning of the frustration
of a plot to kill or capture General
Aranguren, in which General Lee and
Representative King of Utah were In
nocents instruments.
Mr. King since his arrival ten days
ago has proved himself an enthusiastic,
but most Indiscreet investigator. He
made no- secret of his intention to com
municate with the insurgents, and ex
pressed a particular desire to meet
General Aranguren. He succeeded in
inducing General Lee to provide a
guide, who agreed to take him to Gen
eral Aranguren, but insisted that the
proposed expedition be kept a close se
cret, for fear the Spanish authorities
would take advantage of it to learn of
General Aranguren"s location.
In spite of this, the story not only
leaked out, but Mr. King was offered
assurances by the secretary of General
Congosto to the effect that no opposi
tion would be made to his passage
through the Spanish lines. All was ar
ranged for Mr. King and his guide to
pass the lines this morning, ajid go to
the rendezvous where he was to meet
General Aranguren and Colonel Del
gado to-night. The guide became
alarmed last night. Noticing that Mr.
King was closely shadowed by Span
ish police agents, he watched and
about 10 o'clock discovered Mr. King
and Secretary Congosto in earnest con
versation under a dark colonnade In
the Prado. Fully realizing the danger,
the guide started for the country, and
in a half hour was on his way to warn
General Aranguren.
It is openly asserted that the author
ities made every preparation to follow
Mr. King to the place of meeting and
to have a force on hand ample to over
come resistance by the rebel chiefs.
A train of Seventeen cars filled with
troops left this morning, going In the
direction in which the meeting was to
take place. Mr. King's first intimation
of the failure of the proposed expedi
tion came this morning, when he
learned that his guide was missing.
Buried in New York.
PARIS, Jan. P.â Mrs. Ayer's body will
be embalmed and is going to New York
for interment. Funeral services will be
held at Holy Trinity here on Friday.

ALEX MCDONALD'S STORY.
Perils of Himself and Two Compan

Was Raging.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA. Wash., Jan. s.â On De
cember 23, while coasthound miners
were crossing the summit of Chilcoot
Pass in the teeth of a biting blizzard,
an avalanche of snow and ice came
thundering down the mountain side
above the narrow defile through which
the miners pass,. It covered the Burns
tramway and several sleds and tons of
provisions, all of which will probably
be a total loss.
On the other side of the summit,
near Crater L^.ke, a glacier broke
away while the storm was at its
height, burying in its icy grasp two
sleds and part of the outfit of three
Scotchmen, who were coming out from
Stewart River. Their loss was nearly
$1000. The losers are Alexander and
James McDonald and J. Kenneth,
three men who went into the Yukon to
test an electrical ground-thawing ma
chine.
Alexander McDonald described the I
slide of snow and ice to-day as Col
lows: "It came down the mountain (
side with a roar and with terrific '
force. The Burns tramway was coy- |
ered up under a pile of snow several ;
feet thick, while the provisions and !
outfits awaiting transportation to the j
lakes beyond were huried out of sight. \
An immense quantity of snow shot |
down the hillside. The tramway was
damaged so badly as to be of no use j
till the snow can he cleared away and j
repairs made. Much worse than that j
was the loss of provisions which were '
covered up by the ice and snow.
"The storm was raging so that travel
was difficult and dangerous. We j
found it impossible to get the sleds
laden with our outfits over the pass
without lightening them and doubling
over the summit. We had made one â 
trip and went back for the remainder j
of our outfit. When we got back we
found that the glacier had covered our
sleds and provisions clear out of sight.
Our loss was approximately $1000, but
I don't believe that will nearly cover
the amount of damage done by the j
snowslide on the summit."
Frank Burns had Just repaired his
tramway and gotten it in running or
der for the winter work. During the
summer his wooden whim, the most
important part of the outfit, was cut
up by Klondikers and used for fire
wood. He was then in the interior.
On his return he set about replacing
the whim at an expense of several
thousand dollars. He had taken a few
outfits over, and had contracted to
take a large quantity of supplies over
from the Scales to Crater Lake, part
of them being provisions badly needed
at Lake Bennett. Their transportation
will be delayed until the immense
quantity of snow and ice brought
down by the avalanche can be shov
eled away. Some damage was done
to the other tramways now building,
but the amount is yet unknown.

No Resistance Offered When the

Possession.
Spoclal Dispatch to The Call.
CITY OP MEXICO, Jan. 5.â A high
official of the Department of Foreign
Relations said to-day regarding the
Clipperton Island incident:
"The sending of the gunboat Demo
crata on a visit of inspection to por
tions of the Mexican territory was de
facto, attended by no conflict or diffi
culty with the individual Americans
found there, and in no event should that
visit have given rise to international
questions, inasmuch as the occupation
of the island, if occupation it may be
called, was the act of private persons
having no official character.
"The American flag was found flying
there, but the Americans themselves,
on hearing from the lips of Mexican of
ficers that the island was Mexican ter- i
ritory, hauled it down and allowed the ;
party of Mexicans to run up the flag of |
this country without the slightest op
position, either in act or in word. There
was no ill feeling or bitterness between
the Americans found on the island and I
the expeditionary party. On the con- '
trary. nothing but good will and
friendly disposition was displayed on
both sides.
"The claim made in behalf of France
by La Liberte of Paris is regarded as a
canard. France never held the island."

SOLEDAD, Jan. 5. â An experiment
was begun here to-day of extraordi
nary moment to the entire country, in
asmuch as its success will solve the
problem of congested populations in
the cities and prove a long step in the
direction of minimizing the evils of
municipal poverty and pauperism. It
was the practical Intention of the plan
of General Booth and his corps of en
thusiasts in matters of social and re
ligious reform to capitalize the surplus
labor of the commercial centers and
colonize it on the most desirable arable
lands of the West.
Commander Booth-Tucker, to whom
was assigned the task of bringing into
existence the first tentative settlement,
arrived this afternoon from San Fran
cisco with a group of colonists for Fort
Romie and a full-uniformed escort of
the Salvation Army. The little town
turned out to give the new-comers a
cheering reception. Festooned car
riages were in waiting to convey the
officials of the enterprise to the site of
the colony, anl larger vehicles were
provided for the settling families and
such household effects as they had
brought along.
Fort Romie, thus named in honor of
the Californian who contributed most
to the undertaking, is west of So-ledad;
it is a mile and a half, as the crow
flies, on the opposite side of the Sali
nas river, and three miles distant by
the county road. The settlement con
sists of a 500-acre tract segregated
from the Romie estate, one of the larg
est in Monterey county. The foron is
that of a V, resting on the west shore
of the Salinas, and extending more
than a mile to the foot of the gently
sloping r"oast range. The inner sur
vey of the plat is a triangular reser
vation for parks, townsite, creameries,
public wrrrks and such other uses as
the incorporation may deem advisable
to the progress and interest of the com
munity.
Encompassing the triangle, on the
nppoplte sides of two broad avenues
that start from the county road at the
west and converge to a point near the
river, are the ten acre lots Intended for
apportionment among: the colonists.
The dwellings on these are to sym
metrically front the avenues. Thirty
of the intended fifty are nearly com
pleted. Ten are of four rooms each,
for large families, twenty of two rooms
each, for small ones. The buildings,
though unornamental, are neat and of
various designs of architecture. The
first comers have preference of selec
tion.
In the center of the townsite a large
two-story-and-a-half co-operative store
is going up. Twenty-eight men have
been employed for weeks in breaking
the land preparatory to individual cul
tivation and erecting the buildings.
This force will be dismissed at an early
day, and the continuance of the publio
or general work will become the first
duty of the colonists who are in evi
dence, as soon as they have chosen
their lots and installed their families.
Mr. Romie placed his horse herds at
the disposal of the colony, and thirty
of these are already broken to plow
and harness. Within forty days the
irrigation plant and canal system are
expected to be in operation.
At the junction of the Arroyo and
Salinas Rivers abundant water has
been tapped at a depth of eleven feet,
a half-mile from town. Here an exca
vation 40x40 feet will be made for a
reservoir, with a centrifugal pump and
a 90-horse power engine. The colony
canal will be supplied with a water
flow at the rate of from 6000 to 9000 gal
lons a minute.
In the colony tract are embraced
two old lessee estates, comprising
many useful building Improvements
and two excellent orchards, one of
twenty acres and the other of seven.
It was to one of these that the colon
ists were taken on their arrival to
day. The swift transformation of the
scene was inspiring. The laughter of
the happy mothers, vicing with the
boisterous shouts of the little children,
who were plainly overjoyed to be spir
ited into this favored spot of nature
from the streets of the city; the boyish
Interest and enthusiasm of the fathers,
the haltering and breaking of horses
which was going on, the myriad chick
ens scurrying about out of reach of the
youngsters, the ten-horse gang plows
moving steadily down the open, the
echo of the click of the carpenter's
hammer on the uprising buildings, and
amidst it all Booth-Tucker and his
men vainly trying to repress their
gratification, formed a picture of an
ticipation and happiness not to be for
gotten readily.

- â ' The r>oo acres, with orchards and im
provement*, is paaaed over to the col
ony Incorporation, to be paid for at
ISO an acre In ten years on the install
ment plan. This obligation is as
sumed by the company, which is capi
talized at $100,000. Against the loans
secured within this amount the trus

Of interest ranpinK between S and 6
per cent per annum, interest and in
stallment to be paid annually after the
full amount of capitalization has been
procured. Four of the trustees are
chi sen from among the principal sub
scribers. Commander Booth-Tucker,
who stands as sponsor for the honesty
and sincerity of the undertaking, is
th.- fifth.
The charge to each holder of a lot is
the 160 original acreage cost per acre.
He Is to pay the trust this amount on
the annual installment plan. He rc
ceivea at the outset from the company,
.for his first year's help, a cottage
W< rth $12f>, outfit. $130, and loans aa
absolutely required for his mainte
.to the amount of $200. These
he lik--.\:s â  is to refund in installments,
with interest. On the part of the as
sociation, it is required of the settle*
that he pay in to the trustees a regu
lar weekly installment of $1 80, mak
ing $75 annually, and the interest on
his indebtedness. From this forced
payment a sinking fund is created
against the liquidation of the capital
Investment.
The process, in short, will make of
the trust a sort of repository for the
funds of the colony, and place It In a
position t" control the communal
finances. Of course the purpose Is to
exercise this control for the common
welfare. The foregoing basis of cal
culation, though described as for one
person, is really for a family of five.
Accepting: it as of sound promise It
demonstrates, according to Booth-
Tucker, that the $50,000,000 now ex
pended annually in loosely administer
ing: to city charities, if invested on his
plan now about to be put on trial at
F>rt Ronile, would furnish self-sup-
Ing homes for 100,000 families, compris
ing in the aggregate a half million per
sons, at present helpless and destitute.
It should be stated that of the 550,Â«
000, or half the capitalization needed
immediately for the carrying on of the
Fort Romie undertaking, something
less than $9000 has been secured. Of
this amount $1300 was donated.
The system is neither visionary nor
new. It is copied and slightly amend
ed on the lines of co-operation, from
the Raiffeisen plan of loan association,
carried on for fifty years in Germany
and initiated later throughout Europe,
without having a single failure record
ed against it. As an investment it is
held to be safe and beneficent for capi
ta! to make according to all human ex
perience.
Major W. AY. Wlnchell will manage
the affairs of the colony as the repre
â  tive of the association. The keeper
of the co-operative store will serve as
secretary. Adjutant W. H. Wood will
be superintendent of agriculture, aided
by Captain Simpson, an expert, as in
structor. These men are especially se
lected for fitneaa
It is not yet decided what will be the
policy as to cultivation, although It is
pretty well understood that at least
two acres of each ten-acre allotment
will be devoted yearly to the cultiva
tion of sugar beets, which will be sal
able to the immense sugar works al
most at the very threshold of the col
any. With the care to be given such
limited land holdings under experienced i
direction, it is estimated that the prod
uct will average for each settler forty
ton? an acre, which, at $4 a ton, would
mean an annual income for him of
$320. The hisrh average of product and
quality would be maintained by alter
nating: the beet acreage with cereal
crops for the support of dairy cattle
and chickens. A certain part of each
lot wi'.l be devoted perennially to al
falfa. Small orchard space will also be
provided for.
In the heart of the townsite will be
the co-operative store, at which col
onists are to receive coupons indicat
ing the amounts of their purchases.
Quarterly an accounting will be made
by the storekeeper to the trustees, and
they will declare a dividend, on which
each colonist is to share according to
the relative amount of his purchase, as
shown by the coupon stubs. Saloons
are not to be tolerated within the lim
its of the settlement, and settlers pat
ronizing any that may be planted out
side to bait or lure them will do so at
the peril of expulsion from the colony.
This contingency is provided for in
the individual contract entered into be
tween the colonists and the tyist as
sociation.
Good moral conduct and honesty of
â¢dealings are further stipulated as
the sine qua non to the benefits and
membership of the settlement.
Four hundred applications for ad
mission to the colony are filed with the
trustees. These are to be sifted care
fully and the applicants will be in
some respects subjected to the most
rigid examination. The fortunates al
ready selected passed successfully
through an ordeal designed to test
their honesty of purpose as well as
their capacity for work. They are:
G. D. Weber, P. C. Anderson, C. Stohi.
L. B. Smith, N. Hameus, J. Lohmann,
A. J. "Webb, Emil Shogren, E. A. Tra
vers, George Toole, C. Springer, F.
Lindstrom. M. McCurdy, Charles Gil
lespk-. \V. F. Sharp, Henry Smith and
Thomas Pascoe, all with families rang
ing in number of children from one to
nine. Several others have been chosen
from among the numerous applicants
and will arrive later to take their lots.
The religion, creed or sect of a mem
ber is of no consideration to the cor
poration. The project is social and
economic betterment. Any number of
the colonists desiring to build a church
may purchase a lot for the purpose
and enjoy the fullest exercise of their
religious inclinations.
With impressive ceremonies the
stars and stripes will be floated over
the colony to-morrow and nailed to the
staff. ID.COWBN.

JACK DALTON
AS A LEADER
Will Pilot Government
Relief Forces to
Dawson.
General Merriam's Conferences
With the Intrepid
Klondiker.
Great Activity at Vancouver Barracks
for an Early Start of the
Expedition.
Special DlÃpatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Jan. s.â Awakened to the
realization of an impending food fam
ine in the Klondike district, through
facts sent out by Sam Wall, The Call
correspondent, the Government is act
ively arranging to send a relief expe
dition into Dawaon City.
Jack Dalton, so famous in connec
tion with Alaskan history, has Just re
turned to this city from Vancouver
Barracks, where he had a two days 1
consultation with r>rigadter-General
Merriam of the Department of the Co
lumbia. Conferences between Captain
YV. D. Robinson, assistant quartermas-*
ter stationed in Seattle, and Palton. are
of daily occurrence. Dalton will likely
lead the expedition, which it is believ
ed will be on the move within the next
two or three weeks.
Captain David L. Bralnard of the
Subsistence Department, U. S. A., who
will accompany the expedition, arrived
at Vancouver Barracks yesterday from
Chicago, where he inspected the stores
that are to be token to Dawson. After
consultation with General Merriain at
Vancouver, it is expected that Captain
Brainard will come to Seattle to con
sult with Captain Robinson and others
rned in the expedition.
Captain Ray, who was sent with
Lieutenant Richardson into the Yukon
last summer, is believed to be on his
way out of the Klondike over the ice
and snow. Captain Ray, it is under
stood, was to secure dog teams at Cir
cle City and as soon as the riven
froze was to start for the coast, bring
ing a full report of conditions as they
existed, both as regards food and the |
need of Government troops to main
tain order on the American side. He I
is anxiously awaited, for it is believed j
that on his report as to the condition j
of the trails, etc.. will depend to some j
extent the movements of the War De
partment.
In view of the negotiations that have !
been going on it was stated to-day by
well informed people that in all prob- j
ability Dalton would be called on by j
Secretary Alger to lead the expedition <
into the Klondike. On Christmas day
Dalton. at the request of General Mer
riam and Captain W. W. Robinson, left !
this city for Vancouver to consult with
the former. Dalton's services, it is un
derstood, are in great demand by the
r,.iv.-rnment, and it is stated that if
the contract to freight the supplies in
to Dawson is not awarded to him it
will be because his services are held j
at too high a figure.
Dalton. if any arrangement between
himself and the Government is carried
out. will, it is understood, take the re
lief supplies to the Klondike at a stip
ulated rate per pound, acting as
freighter. What portion of the com
plement of men and horses is to be
furnished him by the Government has
not yet been given out.
General Merriam also consulted Dal- |
ton with reference to what trail was
best adapted to the objects of the ex
pedition, and what means of convey
ance were best suited to the purposes
, of the Government. Dalton refuses
to state just what passed between him
! and General Merriam during his last
visit to Vancouver. However, he
; strongly intimates that he will be con
| nected with the expedition of taking
1 Into the grubless camp the supplies of
provender which the Government has
ordered purchased for the needy min
ers.
Considering the fact that Dalton has
been in the business of taking men and
supplies over his trail into the gold
fields for several years .in<l has in that
time won an enviable reputation for
sagacity and courage under adverse
circumstances, it is natural to presume
that the officials of the War Depart
ment wish to have him assist in taking
the supplies to Dawsnn.

a long speech, said:
"I am going where I shall unques

Whatever Jealousies or antiquated an
tipathies may be in the hearts of oth
ers, the Salvationists on both sides of
the water have â  nljr affection and con

i our sorrows and storms. In the United
States one of the greatest sorrows that
could come to a general of God has
come to me. One of my sons has de
parted from his father's side and from
; the Salvation Army. I do not bear
htm ill will, for, though I think he is
; very much in the wrong, he is still my

The Manifest Importance of a
Better Knowledge of the
Dairy Cow.
Papers of Interest Read by the Lead
ers in the Several Fields
of Work.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. Jan. s.â The final
session of the Farmers' Club's Insti
tute was held to-day, and the attend
ance was larger than on any previous
day. The convention has been one of
the most successful gatherings of agri
culturists in all branches and lines of
that industry ever convened In the
State. A committee of three was ap
pointed to consult with the Merchants'
and Manufacturers' Association in re
gard to establishing an exchange. The
chairman was instructed to make a
correct statement regarding the San
Jose scale and its habits, and give it to
the correspondent of the Associated
Press at Los Angeles, In order that it
may be telegraphed all over the United
States. It was said that if it got into
the Associated Press dispatches it
would not fail to reach Germany, the
objective point.
Professor McClatchie delivered an in
structive address on handling milk. He
prefaced his address by saying that
dairymen do not take a proper interest
In their work.
They have some of them been in the
business twenty-five years and still
think a cow is a cow. and milk is milk,
and that there is nothing more to be
said. He touched upon the importance
of testing cows to see if they paid for
their keeping, not by single tests, but
j tests continuing throughout the year.
If milk was sold to creameries, the
amount of butter fat turned out during
the yt-ar was the basis for the test.
Each test should be taken from
samples taken for at least four suc
| cessive days. Changes in temperature,
j sudden changes in food, a new milker
I or change in time of milking produce
j temporary changes in the quantity and
j quality of milk.
So long as the cow has plenty of
feed, the kind of food would affect the
milk little: quality of milk is determin
ed by the breed and not by individ
| uals, and the only way to improve it is
j to improve the breed.
These statements were all borne out
by experiments made in Denmark for
ten years on 2<>o<"> cows.
George E. Platt followed with a paper
on "A Better Dairy C< w." He enlarg
ed upon the importance of selecting
proper breeding animals, the feeding of
calves and giving them good pasturage.
James R. Boal read a paper on "The
Silo." The silo is a tight pit where
green food may be stored for long pe
riods and still retain its freshness.
Cornstalks can be made use of. and
many economies are made possible by
the use of the silo. Corn, alfalfa and
oats make good silage. Sorghum is
too acid and Egyptian corn too woody.
The cost of a silo is $60, and a cutting
outfit $125. The latter can be bought in
partnership by several farmers.
Papers were read as follows: "Lemon
Culture." hy G. p. Hall of San Diego;
"Lemons on the Coast," by EL C. Dil
lon of Long Beach, and N. W. Hlanch

This evening Hon. Abbott Kinney
read a most interesting paper on "For

the subject, and his remarks were lis

Wiislte also discussed th^ subject of
the preservation of forests.
NE PLUS ULTRA COPPER
MINE CHANGES OWNERS.
Sold to a Stockton Syndicate for About
$15,000â Recent Developments Show
Very Good Ore.
FRESNO, Jan. s.â The Ne Plus Ultra
copper mine, situated on the Daulton
ranch on the line between Bcrenda and
Raymond, in Madera County, has been
sold to a Stockton syndicate. The tran
saction involved about $15,000.
The mine was discovered by the late
N. L. Bachman, and in 1865 a company
mi farmed and incorporated, with Judge
C. G. Sayle as president and Judge E. C.
Wlnchell as secretary- The mine was
operated a number of years, the ore be
ing hauled to Stockton by ox teams and
thence shipped to Swansea in Wales for
reduction; there being, at that time no
reduction works on the Pacitlc Coast.
The mine was closed down In 1!>77 owing
to the low price of copper and the hign
rates of freight demanded by the rail
road company.
In June, ISM, the parties to the present
purchase, under a contract, resumed
work on the mine, and the results were
M satisfactory that they have taken ad
vantage of the option and will erect re
duction works on the ground. The work
ing of the mine will be pushed by the new
owners.
Besides the Daulton estate there are
several Fresnans Interested. Judge-
Sayle is still president of the company;
ex-Assemblyman N. L. F. Bachman.
nephew of the discoverer of the mine, is
secretary: Alex Goldstein, president of
the Farmers' Bank of Fresno, treasurer,
and Judge Seth Mann of Oakland and
John F. Daulton are the other directors.
The recent developments show a fine
quality of "peacock" ore. â  The mine Is
one of the best on the coast, and Its fur
ther development will be watched with
great interest.

repudiate the insinuations against Ger

Count yon Munster (German Embas
sador to France) volunteered to make
a similar statement at the trial of

DEBATE WILL
BE CUT SHORT
Currency Reform to Be
Taken Up in the House
To-Day.
Overstreet Will Introduce the
Indianapolis Commis
sion's Bill.
Speaker Heed Opposed to a Lengthy
Discussion of Monetary
Measures.
Bpeclal Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office. Rlggs House,
Washington, Jan. 5.
Representative CKerstreet will to
morrow introduce the currency reform
bill proposed by the Indianapolis Mon
etary Commission. A meeting of the
banking and currency committee will
be held to-morrow to determine
whether four members of the Indianap
olis conference shall be given a hearing
on the bill. Ex-Senator Edmunds, ex-
Secretary Charles F. Fairchild, J. F.
Fries of North Carolina and Judge
Robert S. Taylor of Fort Wayne had
expressed a desire to be heard.
Early this morning Representative
Johnson of Indiana asked Chairman
Walker of Massachusetts to call a
meeting of the committee to enable the
four gentlemen named to be heard. Mr.
Walker sat up an obstruction at the
very outset. He declared that the rep
resentatives of the Indianapolis plan
should not be heard.
"There has been enough talk al
ready, " said the chairman.
Representative Johnson took the
reins in his own hand and circulated a
pap^r among the members of the com
mittee requesting the chairman to call
the meeting to determine whether the
four commissioners should be heard.
He soon obtained a large majority of
the nu-mbers of the committee and
Chairman Walker weakened and con
sented tÂ«> call the committee to-mor
row. Walkers obstructive tactics have
caused much comment.
Now thai the \\.>rk of the Monetary
Commission has taken practical shape
in the form of the report which was
published a few days ago, the members
of Congress are waiting with interest
the bill which has been prepared. Care
ful inquiry among the leaders in the
House to-day wuuM Indicate that the
prospect 'for such sweeping legislation
as is designed by either the Gage biU
or the forthcoming commission biii is
not to be expected. Nor is there a
prospect for long debate on currency
and financial reform in the House.
Speaker Keed is opposed t<- a long dis
cussion by members of the H<use. Pub
lic has been aroused and
public opinion formed by the work of
the Indianapolis commission, and it is
earnestly hoped by the leaders of the
House that the commission will con
tinue its work of <iis.Â«i'niinating Infor
mation on the subject. It is not believed
that much can be accomplished in the
matter of passing currency reform bills,
and. therefore, oMMt "f the time de
to such debate would be wasted
It has been set forth In these dis
patches that no measure contemplating
the withdrawal of the greenbacks will
become a law. Nor is the time be
lieved to be ripe for bills revolutioniz
ing the present system of national
banking, based on the issue of cur
rency by the banks against national
bonds deposited by them. All such bills
as Mr. (Japf-'s or of the commission
which contemplates the issue of cur
rency by the bank:*, based <m a per
centage of their "business assets" are
regarded by the leaders of the House
as premature. Even if th- y i
the House they Mould die in the Sen
ate.
In the opinion of the House leaders,
which Includes every member of the
ways and means committee, the bank
ing and currency committee should
confine itself to the Introduction of
the modest measures recommended by
President MeKinlej --namely, the es
tablishment of small hunks In rural
community, permitting banks to is
sue currency to the par value of depos
ited bonds and reducing the tax on
circulation. There is strong ground for
the belief that these bills could pass
the Senate. A further measure restrict
ing the issue of bank notes of the de
nomination of $10 and over and requir
ing all banks t>> redeem their own
notes in gold on demand might also be
enacted into a law.
It is wry probable that before the
end of the present session the commit
tee on ways and means will lay before
the House a bill to authorize the Secre
tary of {ho Treasury (whenever the
expenditures of the Government for
any one month have exceeded the re
ceipt?) to issue short term bonds to
the amount of such deficiency, the
bonds to be redeemed after three years,
and bearing about 24 or 3 per cent In
terest.
GENERAL YEATMAN-BIGGS
SUCCUMBS TO DYSENTERY.
Commanded the Second Division of the
Tirah Expedition to India's
Frontier.
LONDON, Jan. 6 .â According to a
special dispatch from Peshawur, Ma
jor-General Arthur Godolphin Yeat
man- Ripzs, in command of the second
division of the Tirah expedition in the
northwest frontier of India, died on
Tuesday rrf dysentery. The news is
confirmed from various sources.
Major-General Yeatman-Biggs was
a son of the late Harry Fair Yeatman,
of lfanrton House. Dorset, and was
born in 1843. He entered the army in
1860, became a captain in 1874, a majoT
in ISBO, lieutenant-colonel in 1882. col
onel in 18S6 and major-general last
year. He served in China in 1862. dur
ing the South African war in 1879, and
with the Egyptian expedition in 1882.
In I^7*. he assumed by royal license the
additional surname of Biggs. He was
created a Companion. of the Bath (mil
itary) in 1891, and from 1895 had com
manded the presidency of the district
of Bengal.
Some of the most effective work of
the Rritish forces on the northwest
frontier of India during the campaign
against the rebellious tribesmen ha*
been done by the troops of the Second
Division. The most brilliant exploit of
the punitive expedition was the storm
ing and recapture of Dargai Ridsre on
the Samana range by the Ghurkas and
the Gordon Highlanders of the Yeat
man-Biggs brigade last October.

BOSTON. Jan. s.â The meeting this
afternoon at the Fitchburg Women's
Christian Temperance Union in regard
to the protest against Miss Addle Gil
lette's admission to the bar has only
added fuel to the discussion of the case,
which is stirring the whole country.
Mrs. Jabez Fisher, the President, and
Mrs. Coolidge. wife of ex-Congressman
Coolidge, read this memorial:
To the honorable the Justices of
the Superior Court: The undersigned
women of the city of Fitchburg respect
fully protest against the admission of
Miss Addle F. Gillette to the bar of
â \\ orcester County.
"We thought it best," continued Mrs.
Coolidge, in a gentle voice, "that this
should be signed, not as an organiza
tion, but as Individuals. It Is the pro
test of the women of Fitchburg."
Why do you protest?" asked the
vice-president, after a pause, during
which everybody appeared a trifle em
barrassed.
"We make no charges." replied Mrs.
Coolidge. "We did not suppose it would
be necessary to file any protest. We
never believed that the men would al
low her to go through."
The protest was signed by every
woman present. A similar protest was
ofTHred at the meeting of the Woman's
Relief Corps, and, it is said, has al
ready more than fifty signatures. Soro
sis acted simultaneously with the
Woman's Christian Temperance Union.
Sorosis is made up from Fitchburg's
400; or, more literally, the first twenty
women of the city. The petition was
very generally signed. The Daughters
of Rebecca followed the example of
other societies. To-day the Woman's
Club and the Wednesday Club took
similar action.
ELECTED A LIEUTENANT
COLONEL OF THE SIXTH.
Captain Johnson of Stockton Wins a Close
Contest By a Single
Vote.
FRESNO. Jan. 6.â After a deadlock
lasting until 1 o'clock this morning the
line and field officers of the Sixth Reg
iment. N. G. C. elected Captain W. A.
Johnson of Company A, Stockton, to be
their lieutenant-colonel. Captain Wil
liam H. Cook of Company G, Bakers
field, was his opponent. A Merced
lieutenant, who arrived at 1 o'clock,
cast the deciding vote.
The balloting began at 8 o'clock, and
the first vote stood 13 to 13. By 11
o'clock nine ballots were taken, and the
result remained unchanged. The sup
porters of each candidate were deter
mined not to yield to the rival, as the
repeated balloting showed.
The cause of the close contest was
the rivalry' between Stockton and
Fresno for the location of the regi
mental headquarters. The vote to
night was c-.nfined closely to battalion
lines. The First Battalion embraces
the two companies at Stockton, Com
pany D of Modesto and Company H of
Merced. The Second Battalion is
companies G and F of Fresno, that at
Visalia and that at Bakersfield. Until
Colonel S. S. Wright of this city was
elected to the command of the regiment
a year ngo Stockton held the head
quarters ever since the organization of
the Sixth. Colonel Wright removed a
part of the regimental band, which re
ceives State aid. to Fresno, and this
aroused the animosity of Stockton and
the guardsmen of the First Battalion.
The companies of the southern part
of the valley think that Fresno Is en
titled to have the headquarters for a
few years at least.

Supervisors, accompanied by a woman,
and explained that he had found her
and two small children Jn a destitute
condition alongside the public road
about a mile southeast of the city. They
were camped on the bare ground, with
out anything to protect them from the
wintry weather.
The womtn was then asked to step
forward, while the members of the
board Interrogated her. She was at
tired In a loose wrapper, which was
much the worse for wear and dirt. She
was a healthy-looking woman of about
40 years, but not at all prepossessing.
The woman told a remarkable story.
Her name was Mrs. Jeffres, she said,
and her home in Harrison County, Mo.
Her husband died two years ago, and
the two children she has with her are
aged three and six years respectively.
She has grown children residing in Mis
souri, but they are not able financially
to render her any assistance.
About a year ago the woman left
Missouri, accompanied by her two chil
dren, with a family named Howard.
The entire party was very poor, but
they suiceeded in driving overland to
Portland, Oregon. The opportunities
that had been expected on the Pacific
Coast were not found and the party de
cided to return to Missouri by way of
California and the warmer southern
route. When Fresno was reached the
Howards concluded they would take
Mrs. Jeffres' children no farther. They
were willing to take the mother on the
long journey back to Missouri, but they
insisted that she should dispose of the
children by finding some one who would
give them a home. But Mrs. Jeffres
would listen to no such proposition.
Then the heartless Howards, who
consisted of a man, wife and three
children, coldly unloaded the effects of
Mrs. Jeffres from the wagon on the side
of the road, and the man ordered the
mother and children to get out of the
conveyance.
The pleading of Mrs. Jeffres was in
vain, and the Howards, whom she
had counted as her friends, drove off
toward the south, leaving her and the
little boy and girl standing, with their
few belongings, in the road,
and without a cent of money or a par
ticle of food. For two nights and a day
the unfortunates starved and suffered,
but this morning the kind citizen came
along and supplied their temporary
wants.
The Supervisors took no action to
day, although the unfortunate family
is provided for to-night.

Amazing Confession of a.
San Bernardino Sal
vationist.
Arrested for Grand Larceny He
Pleads Guilty to Numer
ous Crimes.
His Record Overa Hundrsd Burglari*Â«
and Foraging Expeditions in
Five- Years.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN BERNARDINO. Jan. s.â ln
the Superior Court of this county to
day was enacted a scene that sur
prised even those whose duty brings
then in contact with crime of all de
grees. For years A. H. Revis has been
a bright and shining light in Salva
tion Army circles, and little did they
expect that the* one who nightly
sought the sinner to come to the fold,
confess their sins and plead for for
giveness, was at that time prowling
from place to place and stealing any
thing that he could lay his hands on;
yet such was the cage.
A short time ago Revls was arrested
for' the larceny of eleven bottles of
brandy, nine bottles of whisky and a
pair of gum boots from a Redlands
merchant named Spoor, and, on his
being arraigned, admitted his guilt
and desired a speedy trial. He was
brought to this city and arraigned be
fore Judge Campbell, and when In
formed of his rights declared that he
would waive them all. pleaded guilty
and asked to be sentenced at once.
He even declined the services of a
lawyer, saying he was guilty and had
no money to spend on them, and,
when informed by the court that they
could serve for nothing, he declined
to put them to any trouble at all in
his behalf.
To-day was the time for sentence,
and when asked if he had anything to
say, he handed the court a list of all
the burglaries he had been guilty of
during the past five years or so, which
when scrutinized disclosed the aston
ishing fact that he had participated in
no less than 108 foraging expeditions,
securing in every instance booty rang
ing from three loads of wood he had
taken from as many schoolhouses to
carpenter tools from the chests of
workmen engaged about the city.
Nor was this all. He informed the
Court that since preparing the list he
had called to mind four or five more
cases, which he wished incorporated in
his confession, and that he stood ready
for sentence.
Judge Campbell was amazed. He re
marked that he had given the case a
good deal of thought, but as the pris
oner was only arraigned on one charge,
he would sentence him on that, and
gave him one year in San Quentin.
Many think the man insane, but he
declares that he is not and says his
object Is to clear his mind and serve
out his sentence and come back to his
old haunts purified of his Bins, so- that
he can preach the gospel of salvation
to erring souls in this section. He goes
to the penitentiary in the morning.
WILL REQUEST PAYMENT
OF THE SEALING CLAIMS.
President McKinley will Formally Ask Con
gress to Satisfy the
Award.
NEW YORK, Jan. sâ The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: President McKinley will for
mally request Congress in a few days
to satisfy the award made by the
Anglo-American Commission in the
matter of sealing claims filed against
this Government by the citizens of
Great Britain.
The officials of the State Department
were in consultation to-day with Don
M. Dickinson, senior counsel of the
United States before the commission,
preparing the list of the claims, with
the action taken in each case by the
commission. The award made by the
commission amounts to $296,000. with
interest. Figures being prepared at
the State Department show that the
President will have to call upon Con
gress for an appropriation amounting
to $460,000 to satisfy the claims and
interest.
I understand that one of the claims
which the commission refused to grant
was for $600,000, value of skins which
the British Government asserted would
have been captured by British vessel*
had they not been seized.
Brown-McCrunj Wedding.
OAKLAND, Jan. s.â The marriage of

groom and another young man, both
of whom were in the United States
navy. Last fall a double engagement
was announced, and to-night's wed
ding is the first of these to take place.
The bride Is a popular young lady in

Declares thÂ« Cl-vll Sorvloe La-w Is a

Special Diapfctcfc to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
"Washington, Jan. 6.
The presentation of replies of the
members of the Cabinet to the res
olution calling for Information as
to the application of the civil ser
vice law to the various depart
ments of the Government, together
with the consideration of the bill es
tablishing a bureau for the twelfth'
census, precipitated a sharp civil serv
ice debate in the Senate to-day. Cul
lom of Illinois, the author of the reso
lution, thought that modification of the
law ought to be made, as the authori
ties had drifted far away from the or
iginal intention of the authors of the
civil service law. Allen of Nebraska
ged that the law was openly and
daily violated, and said it was a hiss
and byword among the people. Cockreli
of Missouri declared that it was pre
sumptuous in Secretary Sherman to
make recommendations to Congress
that certain positions in his depart
ment should be excepted from the
classified service, when the President
had full authority to make the excep
tions he recommended. He thought an
effort was being made to tie the Presi
dent's hands. Davis, chairman of the
committee on Foreign Relations, gave
notice that he would, next Monday, and
daily thereafter, move that the Senate
consider in executive session the Ha
waiian annexation treaty until it was
disposed of finally.
There was only a Email attendance
in the Senate. Allen of Nebraska
Bpoke on the immigration bill and de
clared in favor of consular inspection
of immigrants.
Teller of Colorado spoke at some
length in support of the idea that the
Census Bureau should not be a parti
san bureau, and that its employes
should, therefore, be placed in the
classified service. He was particularly
anxious that honest, competent men
should perform the work of the next
census, because he had knowledge of
intentional rnisstatements and inten
tional fraud that had been perpetrated
by one statistical department of the
Government in making out that the
world's production of Bilver was $10,
000,900 larger than it actually was. He
was prepared, he 6aid, to establish this
statement, if necessary, to the satis
faction of a jury. If the men whose
appointment is provided for by this
bill are competent they ought to have
the protection of the classified service.
Properly administered, said he, the civil
service law is a wise measure. It has,
however, been badly abused and thus
brought into disrepute. Civil service
has come to stay in this country. It
will stand, and only reasonable modi
fications of its application will be
made. Some modliications may be de
sirable.
C'hilton of Texas, in an extended
speech, in which he discussed the work
of previous censuses and indicated the
enormous amount of work, unnecessary
and irrelevant, that had been performed,
declared that it was a scandal to have
issued so many volumes as seemed
necessary to co-ver the work of the cen
sus of 1880 and 1800. He expressed a
hope that the efforts of the gentleman
from Maine (Hale) to reduce to rea
sonable proportions the topics to be
handled by the twelfth census would
be successful.
Quite unexpectedly the lively civil
service debate was precipitated just at
the. close of the session. Carter in
charge of the bill, said that he would
% have the measure printed with amend
ments that had been offered to it and
for that purpose would consent to have
it temporarily laid aside. He then
moved that the Seaate procr-pri to ,â ,â¢',,,_
sideratic-n of executive bush:
Pending the passage of that motion
the Vice-President laid before the sen
ate the reply of Secretary Sherman to
the Senate resolution requesting infor
mation as to the application of the
civil service law in his department.
Cockrell of Missouri was on his feet
instantly upon the conclusion of the
reading of Secretary Sherman's com
munication.
"Coming from Secretary Sherman,
who served lon- years in Congress,
this communication must be regarded
as a very remarkable document." said
he 'The President himself, as Secre
tary Sherman well knows, has ample
authority to modify the law in accord
ance with the recommendations of his
Secretary of State. The extension of
the operation of the law has been
made from time to time by executive
and not by legislative action. For a
Secretary of State to come to Con
f-.r such relief as Mr. Sherman
request?, when his own chief, the Pres
ideni of the United States, has full
power to act, is presumptuous."
Allison of lowa said that in making
his reply Secretary Sherman had sim-
Ply complied with the explicit request
.of the Senate, and he had the resolu
tion read to show that it called for
recommendations or suggestions for
modifications that Cabinet officials
might have to make. Allison did not
think that Senators ouj-ht to criticize
members of the Cabinet for furnishing
to the Senate precisely what it had
asked for.
Cockrell thought it was a "catch"
resolution which had been framed by
the Senator from Illinois (Cullom). but
he thought it was unnecessary to con
sume the time of Congress in the dis
cussion of this question unless there
was a desire on the part of the Presi
dent's party to tie hi? hands.
Cullom of Illinois, the author of the
resolution calling for the information,
in the course of some remarks bearing
upon it, said in a general way he was
in favor of the civil service law. He
was free to say, however, that modi
fication in its application might be
made with advantage.
Cullom was Interrupted by Allen of
Nebraska with the charge that the civil
service law was openly and daily vio
lated by the heads of the Government
departments.
"As it is now administered," said he.
"it is a hiss and a byword among the
people."
Resuming, Cullom said he had no in
forntÂ«tion as to specific violations of
the law, but he would like to have the
whole matter investigated, as he was
satisfied that the authorities were very
far from carrying out the original in
tention of the authors of the law.
Jones of Arkansas declared that it
was evident that the authors of the
law had not intended that Inefficient
persons should not be removed by the
heads of Government. departments. He
held that the executive heads of ae
partments ought to have the right to
remove incompetent employes without
reference to the action or opinions of
the civil service commission.
At 3:10 p. m., on the motion of Car
ter, the Senate went into executive ses
sion and soon after adjourned.
REFORM OF THE
CIVIL SERVICE
Sweeping Changes Made in the
Bill Drawn by a Special
Committee.
Would End the Tenure of Present
Employes Five Years After It
Is Enacted.
Speda! Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington. Jan. 5.
The bill for the reform of the civil
service law, which has been drawn
by a special committee of Repub
lican members of the House of
Representatives, makes sweeping
changes in the present system, the
most important of which is the es-
tablishment of a five-year tenure
of office for those Government em
ployes who are brought within the
terms of the bill. This measure limits
the application of the civil service sys
tem to the departments in Washing
ton, and to such other localities where
the total number of employes exceed
twenty-five. All appointees are com
missioned for five years, with the
power of removal clearly regulated and
vested In the appointing power. It is
provided, however, that no removal
shall be made for political or religious
causes, and in case of removal the
causes shall be specified and the papers
made a record of the office.
Ail persons now in the public service
are to terminate their service five
years from the time that the act takes
effect. The measure recognizes the
general eligibility of these persons for
reappointment.
It includes in the civil service postal
clerks and letter carriers in offices hav
ing over ten employes, exclusive of
subordinates. It limits the civil ser
vice regulations to rlÂ«rxs whose com
pensation is from $900 to $1800 per year
and includes as clerks, copyists, com
puters, counters and draughtsmen.
It is pointed out that the essential
idea of the foregoing bill is to take out
of the civil service all responsible and
important officers, limiting it only to
clerks in Washington and certain large
cities, and in these cases fixing a te
nure of office of five years.

Should Be Repealed

Washington, Jan. 5.
The civil service debate began In
the House to-day, based on the
Item In the legislative, executive
and Judicial appropriation bill for
the maintenance of the commission.
It promises to continue at least
until the end of the week, %vith
a possibility that It may run longer.
But it is generally admitted on both
sides that the appropriation In the bill
will stand, as the anti-civil service re
formers do not seriously contemplate
an attempt to strike it out. The de
bate, therefore, is only preliminary to
any programme which the enemies of
the law may agree upon. The members
of the House are divided into three
camps on this question â those who
stand by the law, those who advocate
Its entire repeal and those who desire Its
modification. These divisions were ap
parent in the debate to-day, the nature
of which was not as stirring as had
been anticipated. Moody (B.) of Mas
sachusetts, Grow (R.) of Pennsylvania
and Greene (Pop.) of Nebraska de
fended the law. Doekery (D.) of Mis
souri, Robb (D.) of Missouri and Pear
son (R.) of North Carolina opposed it
outright, while Landis (.R.) of Indiana
favored modifications of the law.
There was not a very large attend
ance when the House convened after
the holiday recess. The galleries were
crowded. It was noted that, with one
or two exceptions, the members of the
Ohio delegation, both Democrats and
Republicans, were absent.
Without any preliminary business
the House went Into committee of the
whole to resume consideration of the
legislative, executive and judicial ap
propriation bill. All the features of the
bill had been disposed of except the
appropriation for the civil service com
mission, upon which, by previous ar
rangement, there was to be an indefin
ite general debate. It was proposed
that Moody (R.) of Massachusetts and
Doekery (D.) of Missouri control the
time for and against. Hepburn (R.) of
lowa suggested that it was a three
cornered contest.
"The Democrats," said he, "desire the
entire repeal of the law. Some of those
on this side desire it to stand as it is.
while a large body of us desire a whole
some modification of its provisions."
"Why does the gentleman aver that
all the Democrats on this side of the
House desire the entire repeal of the
law?" inquired Clark (D.) of Missouri.
"Simply because that would be wrong
and your side is always wrong," re
torted Hepburn, amid great laughter.
All suggestions as to the control of
the time failed at last, and the chair
recognized Grow (R.) of Pennsylvania,
who spoke for twenty minutes in sup
port of the general principle of the
civil service law.
Moody of Massachusetts made an
elaborate defense of the civil service
system.
Pearson (R.) of North Carolina at
tacked the law and said a bill for its
repeal would be brought in by a ma
jority of the Civil Service Committee.
Moody (R.) of Massachusetts follow
ed with an admirable defense of the
civil service law. which, he said, pro
tected officials who received $70,000,000
in salaries per annum. Yet, he said,
he had no sympathy with those who
believed the law was perfect and
should be modified only by extension.
He thought those who were placed un
der the protection of the law by execu
tive order should be compelled to sub
mit to a test of their efficiency, and he
also believed that some method should
be found to preserve, if not to restore,
the efficiency of the service. He de
fended the administration of the law
and the character of the examinations
of the commission. In conclusion he
declared that the hostility to the law
was superficial. The sentiment of the
Republican party, he insisted, was
overwhelmingly In favor of the party
keeping the solemn pledge it had given
to the people.
Mr. Dockery (D.) of Missouri opened
the debate in opposition to the law,
which, he argued, was odious to the
American people and should be re
pealed in toto. He pointed out that the
striking out of the appropriation for
the commission would accomplish
nothing, as the Commissioners could
sue the Court of Claims for their sal
aries. The courageous thing to do. he
said, was to pass a bill aimed directly
at the law.
Robb (D.) of Missouri and Pearson
(R.) of North Carolina followed in op
position to the law. The latter, who
has been very active in his hostility to
the civil service law, contended that life
tenure inevitably meant a civil pen
sion list, whether the pensions should
be paid directly out of the Treasury or
indirectly from a retiring fund col
lected from employes for that purpose.
Clark (D.) of Missouri asked whether
the Republicans who were hostile to
the law intended to bring in a bill for
its repeal, to which Pearson emphati
cally replied in the affirmative.
"Will you gentlemen on the other side
use your best endeavors to secure con
sideration for it when it is reported?"
asked Clark.
"We will make desperate efforts,"
answered Pearson. "We will go to
the extreme and vote with Democrats
to secure consideration." (Applause and
laughter).
Landis (R.) of Indiana favored a
modification of the law, which, he said,
would doubtless earn for him a repu
tation as a spoilsman. He sneered at
the professional civil service reform
ers. He had never known those who
called themselves the "better element"
who were not narrow, selfish, bigoted
and dangerous. They had bulldozed
and cowed national conventions and
hypnotized presidents, while they man
aged themselves to set continuously
at the banquet table. He denounced
Cleveland's methods in his second ad
ministration, describing particularly
what took place in the Government
printing office, to the head of which,
he said, Cleveland appointed a man
who would do the "dirty work." On
a single day, he said. Public Printer
Benedict discharged 750 men. That
was known at the Government print
ing office as "bloody Monday." On an
other day he discharged 420. When
1800 removals had been made and 1800
Democrats appointed, Cleveland press
ed the button and the Civil Service
blanket was thrown over them. He
read what purported to be a literal
transcript of reasons assigned for the
discharge of the Republican employes
In the secret record of Mr. Benedict's
private secretary. Some of them were
very amusing and kept the House in a
roar.
When he had concluded the reading
Perkins (R.) of Pennsylvania asked if
it was proposed to return to a system
which made such a recital possible.
"No," replied I^andis, "but we want
to modify the law."
Henderson (R.) of lowa protested
against the production of the record
of one man In condemnation of the best
system yet devised for the purification
of the Government service. He said
thÂ« Civil Service Commission did not
indorse such work.
Unless the law was modified by its
friends, Landis said, a Democratic
President and Democratic Congress
would destroy it root and branch. The
law must be rescued from the clutch
of the zealots.
Landis was vociferously applauded
when he concluded.
Greene (Pop.) of Nebraska closed the
debato for the day with a speech in
favor of civil service reform.
Richardson (D.) of Tennessee, in re
ply to Landis, asserted that the record
showed that when the civil service was
extended to the Government printing
office only 31 per cont of the employes
had been appointed under a Democratic
administration, while 44 per cent had
been appointed by a Republican Pub-
He Printer.
At 4:55 p. m. the House adjourned.

Secretary of War Submits a Report Relative
to Improvements on California
Streams.
WASHINGTON, Jan. s.â The Secre
tary of War to-day submitted to the
House in compliance with the river
and harbor act of 1596 a report of the
Colchas fR. Suter corps of engineers
relative to the Improvement of the Sac
ramento and Feather rivers. The re
port says that seven or eight feet at
low water stages of the river can be
obtained by contraction works at the
separate localities where the river is
in all rases abnormally wide; these are
to be of the nature of pile and brush
work consisting of two parallel rows of
piles extending from the banks out in
to the stream as far as may be re
quired, packing in between the piles
with brush held in position by rock
placed on top and also by brush aprons
placed above, below and at the outer
end of each of these wing dams, sup
plemented by dredging if this should
be required. The aggregate length of
the wing dams believed to be necessary
is about 15.650 linear feet, estimated
with the bank protection to cost $19
per linear foot, or $261,000. The dredg
ing is estimated to cost $18,750. Total
cost of improvements both rivers $279 -

HERALDS THE
STRUGGLE ON
ANNEXATION
Davis Gives Notice
That It Will Begin
on Monday.
Will Then Move the Con
sideration of the Ha
waiian Treaty.
Executive Sessions to Be Asked
For Until the Issue Is
Decided.
IN LINE FOR THE FRAY.
Senators Deluged With Protests From
Farmers Against Acquisition
of the Islands.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office. Riggs House,
Washington, Jan. 5.
"I desire to give notice that
on Monday next at the conclu
sion of the morning business I
shall move that the Senate pro
ceed to the consideration of ex
ecutive business for the purpose
of considering the Hawaiian
treaty. I also give notice that
I shall move an executive
session each day thereafter un
til the matter is closed."
In these words Senator Davis, chair
man of the Senate Committee on For
eign Relations, formally sounded the
warning note of one of the great fights
of the session. It Is going to be a
great battle. Senator Davis realizes
this, but he has bravely undertaken the
leadership of what he confidently be
lieves will be the winning side. He
Is fully alive to the tremendous opposi
tion.
Farmers in all sections of the coun
try are deluging their Senators with
protests against the treaty. Senator
Davis believes that there has been a
change of sentiment with regard to an
nexation, and expects the friends of
the treaty will have the necessary two
third vote to secure ratification. With
in the last few days there have been
frequent conferences at the White
House between the President and Sen
ators Davis, Cullom, Frye, Elkins. Fair
child. Teller and others favorable to
annexation. The result of these con
sultations is that the friends of treaty
propose to make the issue on commer
cial lines and eliminate to a marked
degree the flavor of Jingoism that was
sr> conspicuous in the original plan.
In assembling the annexation force
on a commercial basis several recruits
have been made from the Democratic
side of the Senate, and in the coming
contest the plan is to obliterate party
lines and make the Issue on the ground
that the annexation of Hawaii will
materially improve trade relations
with the United States. Instead of in
dulging in war talk in connection with
Hawaii and speculation on the cost of
maintaining a naval station there, the
friend of annexation are speculating
on the alleged benefit to American
commerce which would follow sole
ownership of Hawaii by the United
States in the event of a conflict be
tween England, France, Germany.
Russia and Japan over the partition of
China. One of the most ardent advo
cates of annexation, from a purely
commercial standpoint, is Senator El
kins of West Virginia, who is taking
an active part in the fight. Senator
Elklns says that In view of existing
complications in the far East trade re
lations between the United States and
the countries involved must be fos
tered and guarded.
"I am not in favor of the annexation
of Hawaii, with any intention of try
ing to assimilate the population of
those islands with our own people,"
said Senator Elkins. "I don't believe
it can be done, and I am not disposed
to try any experiments in that direc
tion; but I am firmly convinced that
we need Hawaii in our business rela
tions with foreign countries, if we only
use it on which to rest a cable. Com
merce seems to be coming our way,
and I believe in doing everything with
in reason to encourage trade. It is im
possible for ships going out of Pacific
Coast ports to Eastern countries to
pass Hawaii without stopping for
coal or supplies, as it is a natural half
way house."
The annexationists will have a strong
ally on the Democratic side in Gorman.
The Maryland Senator is a conserva
tive business man. He tavors annex
ation on the ground that the commerce
of the United States would be largely
benefited. He says he does not be
lieve in wholesale acquisition of terri
tory by the United States, but would
not consent to the acquisition of Ha
waii by any other nation.
'We have a lease or some kind of
claim to a coaling station called Pearl
Harbor In Hawaii," said Gorman to
day, "and if we needed Pearl Harbor
years ago. when our commerce was sel
dom found on the sea, we have greater
need for it now, when every sign points
to a rapid growth of our commercial
relations. If any other nation should
attempt to acquire after we have re
jected it, what are we going to do
about Pearl Harbor, and what has been
the meaning and intention of all friend
ly concessions we have been making in
behalf of Hawaii all these years?"
Senator Jones of Arkansas, who is
opposed to annexation, was an interest
ed listener to the remarks of Senator
Gorman, and Gorman's statement
seemed to make a considerable impres
sion upon the Arkansas Senator. In
replying to the Maryland Senator, Sen
ator Jones said he did not believe any
other nation would attempt to acquire
Hawaii, but if it did he would be in
favor of fighting for whatever right or
title we may have to Pearl Harbor.
Senator Gorman retorted that if Pearl
Harbor was worth fighting for, the en
tire Hawaiian group ought to be worth
something to the United States, now
that we had an opportunity to obtain
possession of these islands, without go
ing to war, and it seemed to him from
a purely business standpoint a good in
vestment. In eastern trade Hawaii of
fered Just the facilities we needed, and
it would be folly to let such a golden
opportunity pass from us.

Men Who Give Employment to the
Asiatics Loudest in the Cry for
Annexation.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, Dec. 24.â Considerable
indignation is felt by white carpenters
and mechanics in Honolulu at the em
ployment of Chinese and Japanese me
chanics alone on the construction of
their costly residences by several Gov
ernment officials and men who since
1893 have made their living out of the
taxpayers. Remonstrances personally
and in the press are in vain. The very
men who are employing: the Chinese
and Japanese are the loudest In the
cry for annexation and the influx of
white labor and capital. Surely there
never has been so much misrepresen
tation and hypocrisy displayed as In
this annexation campaign, when
through this misrepresentation even
the President himself has been in
duced, unwittingly, of course, to make
two grievous errors in his address to
Congress â the one in regard to the
wish of the people of Hawaii as to an
nexation, and the other as to the Jap
anese treaty and conventions. Even
the Government organ takes the Pres
ident to task for committing the error
of stating that the Hawaiian arbitra
tion case is based under the conven
tion of 1886.
Up to this date the Hawaiian Gov
ernment has received no intimation
that Minister Shimamura has received
dispatches from his Government, al
though the fact is admitted by the
Minister himself; but he naturally de
clines to intimate the nature of their
contents and they have been delivered
to the Foreign Office.
It is thought by the Minister of For
eign Affairs not improbable that there
may be some reference to the matter
of annexation in these dispatches, in
asmuch as with the exception of the
formal notice given to tne Japanese
Government of the ratification of the
annexation treaty by the Hawaiian
Senate, and the equally formal ac
knowledgment of the receipt of such
notice, there has been no reference
hitherto made to it in the correspond
ence between the two Governments,
nor has any protest against it been
filed with the Hawaiian Government.
On the 20th inst. Judge Perry of the
| First Circuit Court, Oahu, passed the
i death sentence upon Kapea, the mur
; derer of the late Dr. Jarrad K. Smith,
brother to the Attorney-General, and
Kaio as an accessory before the fact.
The date of the execution was fixed
for April 11, 1898, at Oahu jail. It will
be remembered that the doctor was
shot at night at his door by these men,
whose female relative he had con
signed to Molokai as a leper.
Hon. A. G. M. Robertson, for the de
fense, gave notice of appeal on the
point, new here, that sentence once
suspended cannot be reimposed; and
that forty-eight hours, as required by
the statute, having elapsed through no
fault of the defendant from the rendi
tion of the verdict of the jury, any sen
tence now imposed would be null and
void. The matter will be argued at the
next session of the Supreme Court in
the April term.
Reports of another bloody tragedy
among the Japanese on Kauai have
been received. A jealous lover stabbed
a woman in a dozen places and was in
turn stabbed by his rival, who then
attempted to cut his throat. And still
! another suspected murdpr is reported
from Hawaii, where the body of a Jap
anese was found with the head sev
ered.

ANTI-HANNA
MEN LACK A
CANDIDATE
Unable to Fix Upon
a Choice for the
Combine.
Must Be a Republican
Suitable to All the
Democrats.
None of the Doubtful Members
of Ohio's Legislature Have
Yet "Flopped."
APPEALS TO BUSHNELL
Protests From Members of His Party
Still Pouring in Upon the
Governor.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
COLUMBUS. Ohio, Jan. 5. â Both
branches of the Legislature have ad
journed to Monday. Both sides of the
Senatorial contest remain in confer
ence daily and nightly at the Neil
House and the Gre;;t Southern Hotel,
respectively. The suspense and secret
work will continue until next Tuesday,
when the two branches of the 1. -
lature vote separately for Senator. The
doubtful members made no flops to
day. They still remain doubtful, and
they are receiving the united and un
tiring attention of the legislative
steering committees and outside work
ers.
Next Monday Governor Bushnell will
be inaugurated f'">r his second term,
but the exercises will not interfere with
the Senatorial light! The anti-Hanna
Republicans expect all of their follow
ers here Monday for a large demon
stration.
Although many Republican clubs
have canceled their engagements for
quarters *.>n inauguration day, it is be
lieved that the efforts of the anti-
Hanna Rrpuol Scans to have as big a
demonstration as usual will succeed.
The Hanna men will also take advan
tage of the excursion rates to have
visiting Republican delegations here
on that day to protest against "the
combine" with Democrats. The ex
pected deadlock will not begin until
n^xt Wednesday, v. hen the two houses
ballot jointly for Senator. As the bal
loting may continue Indefinitely, it is
not expected that the inaugur
visitors i am to add to the
chorus of bitter howling and counter
charges, bul apprehend insulting
demonstrat; '!.s and even tcrious dis
turbances on Monday.
Letters and telegrams from protest
ing Republican clubs and committees
and others continue to pour in from
the counties on the Governor and the
Republican members who are co-op
erating with the Democrats, and <s<->me
of these messages and missives appeal
to Senator Foraker to come to the re
lief of the party by declaring it to be
the duty . f K-publicans to stand
by the decree of the Toledo State con
vention in supporting Senator Hanna.
In reply to the reports about Secre
tary Sherman. Assistant Secretary
Day, Congressman Grosvenor and
others, being made the Republican
Senatorial nominee. Senator Hanna
said positively to-day that he would
never retire. He eaid he was nomin
ated by the Toledo State convention for
Senator and could not retire in favor of
any one. If he were defeated the re-
sponsibility for disregarding the decree
of the State convention would rest on
those who were now co-operating with
the Democrats. The Senator insists
that he will never withdraw, even if
defeat should become inevitable, but he
still insists that he will win before an
other week rolls around.
Senator Hanr.a, Mr. Kurtz and other
leaders are now almost worn out and
they evidently have a long struggle still
ahead of them.
The standing committees have not
been announced in either house and
"the combine" is using the patronage
to hold their men in line. In the Sen
ate to-day Senator Burke showed some
tendency to co-operate with his Repub
lican colleagues. The Democrats want
ed to report the committees, but Sena
tor Burke stopped it by,, saying he
would vote with the Republicans. Later
in the day Senator Burke was in con
ference with Hanna and he spent most
of his time with the Hanna workers.
While the Hanna men are still Bhort
three or more votes on the current
claims of both sides, yet "the combine"
is having its troubles in fixing on some
one who can command all the Demo
cratic votes as well as those of the dis
senting Republicans. Lewis G. Ber
nard, the Democratic leader from Cin
cinnati and the manager for John R.
McLean, said to-night:
"There will be no election for a long
series of ballots. The Democrats will
scatter their votes."
This is taken to mean that the Dem
ocrats will not be able to agree In
their caucus on a candidate. The anti-
Hanna Republicans announce posi
tively that under no circumstances will
they vote for a Democrat. They will
continue the deadlock indefinitely
rather than elect a Democratic Sena
tor.
Ex-Senator Brice delivers an address
here next Saturday night at the Jack
pon day banquet, and his presence is
anticipated with some anxiety. The
Press is out with a sensational extra
edition to-night announcing that the
Democratic Prosecuting Attorney has
presented the Senatorial situation to
the Grand Jury. In referring to this
lnquistlon, the Press says sworn state
ments have been submitted to the
Grand Jury from Representative and
Mrs. Griffith of Union County. Repre
sentative George Spellmeyer and Chris
Monter of Cincinnati, Hon. N\ R. Hysell
of Columbus and others against cer
tain workers for Hanna, This affair
is pronounced as an attempt at intimi
dation by the Hanna men.
The Hanna men laugh at the attempt
to secure indictments against certain
â workers, and say that the men who
are spending the money are the ones
to raise the cry about bribery. The
cry of the opposition has been that of
"bosslsm and boodle" during the con
test.
At the antl-Hanna quarters they are
confidently claiming a new accession
to-night, but refuse to give the name
of the member. Senator Burke and
several other members got avay from
the pressure to-night by returning to
their homes.
Following close on the reports about
Mrs. Griffith taking a deep Interest in
the vote of her husband on the sena
torship, comps a report that Mrs. Sny
&*r- the wife of Representative Sny
der, of Greene county, is taking an In
terest In the contest and is favorable
to the opposition. Snyder attended the
Republican House caucuÃ last Saturday
night and voted for Boxwell for Speak
er on Monday, but the opposition is
constantly after him to vote against
Hanna. In connection with the reports
about Representative Griffith, especial
ly about the preferences of Mrs. Grif
fith, there are reports of the wives of
other Republican members being listed
in the contest. And there are reports
that wives of seine Democratic mem
bers are urging their husbands not to
vote for any Republican Senator, but to
stand out for a Democrat.
Kurtz and his associates are reported
to be unable to control the antl-Hanna
Republican members for a Democratic
Senator, and the McLean managers are
believed to have some trouble to get
all the Democrats to support a Repub
lican for Senator.
A MOTHER'S EFFORTS TO
RECOVER HER CHILD.
Mrs. Springstein and Her Sister of San
Francisco Cause Quite a Commo
tion at Napa.
XAPA. Jan. 5. â An exciting attempt
to recover a child occurred in Napa
early this morning. Some time last
summer a young physician named
Benjamin Springstein died in San Fran
cisco, leaving a wife and one small
child, a boy of three years. The parents
of Springstein are well-to-do residents
of this dty and after the death of their
son they secured possession of the
child, alleging that the mother was
unfitted to raise it.
The mother has made several vain
attempts to recover her little one and
last night, becoming desperate, she
came to N'apa on the steamer Zinfan
del. She was accompanied by her sis
ter, also of San Francisco, and to
gether they visited the home of the
grandparents. Then followed a scene
very animated and touching. The
grandparents refused to surrender the
child and the mother begged earnestly
and piteously. Her appeals were un
availing and she will now, it Is said,
make application to the courts.
WILL FURNISH TIES FOR
THE VALLEY RAILROAD.
The Motley Brothers Lumber Company of
Monterey County Secures an Im
portant Contract.
MONTEREY. Jan. s.â The Notley
Brothers Lumber Company, which has
its base of operations about eighteen
miles along the coast south of this
place, has just secured the contract
from the San Joaquin Valley railroad
to furnish the ties used in constructing
the road south of Fresno, and G. C.
Notley, who has negotiated the matter
with the Valley Road people, is now en
r>>ute to Notley Landing to attend to
getting out the ties.
The work of cutting the redwood tim
ber from the forest, several miles In
land from the present lumber camp,
and shipping the ties from the com
pany's landing by steamer to Stockton,
will be begun at once and pushed for
ward as rapidly as possible.
Notwithstanding the fact that this
firm handles and ships annually large
quantities of lumber and tanbark, its
work is carried on with great difficulty
owing to the extreme roughness of the
country. Nearly all the tanbark is car
bon where it is taken to the land
ing on pack mules, other means of
hauling being impossible.
N '.ley Bros, will furnish about 200.-
M, all of which will be cut In the
â¢ anci then packed by mules to
Notley Landing.
SAN JOSE IS OFFERED
AN ART COLLECTION.
Mrs. O'Connor Will Give a Fine Array of
Paintings if the City Will Erect a
Suitable Bui/ding.
SAN JOSE. Jan. s.â An art gallery' Is
among the possibilities of the near fu
ture for this city. Mrs. M. P. O'Con
nor, wife of the capitalist, has offered
to donate a fine collection of oil paint
ings as a nucleus for an art school
and gallery, provided the city will erect
a suitable building. The list includes
copies of all the famous paintings and
works of the great masters of ihe Old
World and is worth thousands of dol
lars. They are at present in Notre
Dame Institute and the O'Connor San
itarium, but as soon as the establish
ment of an art school and gallery is
assured they will be given to the city.
It has been suggested that a two-
Ftnry building be erected in Normal
square, the lower part to be used for
the art school purposes and the up
stairs as a gallery- An art club will
be organized and arrangements made
so that San Jose can take advantage
of the munificent gift.
Mrs. O'Connor is the wife of M. P.
O'Connor, who has done so much in
the way of gifts for charitable pur
poses for San Jose, among which are
the O'Connor Sanitarium and the No
tre Dame Institute.
WILLIAM R INEH ART'S
HEIRS NONSUITED.
Fail in a San Jose Court to Recover Posses
sion of a Ranch Valued at
$10,000.
SAX JOSE. Jan. s âThe suit of Jo
seph Rinehart and other heirs of the
late William Rinehart against Edward
Donovan and wife to recover posses
sion of a ranch valued at $10,000 was
decided in favor of the defendants by
Judge Hyland to-day. The plaintiffs
sued to recover a tract of land of forty
acres near Agnews, which they claimed
Donovan and his wife obtained from
William Rinehart by undue influence
just before his death and without valid
consideration.
The plaintiffs succeeded In breaking
the will of the decedent by which Don
ovan and his relatives were well pro
vided for the exclusion of the plaint
iffs, but the Court held the transfer
in question and the present suit to have
been legitimate.
SENSATIONAL SCENE IN A
FRESNO DIVORCE SUIT.
Father of Mrs. Ash, the Defendant, Whips a
Man Who Tries to Take Away Her
Children.
FRESNO, Jan. s.â At the trial to-day of
the suit for divorce brought by Richard
Ash against his wife, A. R. Ball, father
of Mrs. Ash. whipped John Bt. Clair.
who had attempted to gain possession of

Judge Cheney Says the Prosecution
Has Interesting Testimony in
Reserve.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 6.â After a
somewhat erratic and acrimonious de
bate, which occupied nearly an hour
and a half, the Board of Education
decided upon a method by which the
investigation of the charges against
School Director W. L. Webb would be
considerably shortened, the expense
lessened and the teachers saved much
perturbation of mind and physical in-
convenience. It was the announced
plan of the defense to put every school
teacher. Janitor and other employe of
the School Department on the stand to
prove that none of them had paid, di
rectly or indirectly, for their positions,
or had been approached to do so. This,
they claimed, was necessary not only
to prove the baselessness of the
charges made against Webb, but la
vindicate the entire Board of Educa
tion and to remove the stigma that had
been placed, according to their views,
on every teacher and employe in the
department.
The method adopted by the unani
mous vote of the board was to have
the teachers resort to affidavits instead
of taking the stand to testily orally.
There were present: Directors Davis,
Poor, Webb, Mathlss. Conrey and Bart
lett. The Council chamber was again
well filled. In opening the meeting.
Chairman Davis said:
'"I want to make one statement to
the board and to the defense. I feel
that in Justice to myself I cannot allow
the examination as it was carried on
last night, taking simply negative tes
timony, to continue without a protest.
I consider this an absolute waste of
time and money. It has no bearing on
the issues of the case. I do this be
cause the expense is a large one and
the inconvenience to the teachers is
great."
To this Mr. Oliver, on behalf of the
defendant, replied that the local pa
pers had published the innuendoes
made by the prosecution against Webb.
These, he said, included charges of cor
ruption in which Webb was implicated.
'This defendant," he continued, "has
the right to refute these slanders that
have gone out against him. If the
prosecutiun will join hands with us and
admit that the teachers will testify
that they were never approached and
never paid a dollar for their positions,
then we are willing to suspend ihe ex
amination right here."
Chairman Davis remarked: "Mr.
Webb is charged with two separate
charges. These other matters have
nothing to do with them."
This brought Webb to his feet.
â I would like to call your attention."
he said, "to the fact that we have
something like $800 to pay for the sten
ographers" bill. If ten per cent of that
bill was expended in the examination
of the charges preferred against me
and not as to whether Bartlett had
sold a piano or something else equally
Immaterial, then I will admit the Jus
tice ->f your remarks. You have gone
right along with the prosecution for
three solid weeks. The defense has had
three or four nights on the stand and
then you say these examinations are
irrelevant. You allowed Mr. QlMwaa to
say all kinds of thingsâ that we had a
piano deal on, that we had a cement
sidewalk deal. etc. The impression has
gone out that every teacher was cor
ruptly approached. The papers have
said that I was drawing this out. but
that I had better be careful or I would
run into a snag. I am not afraid of
any snag. Mr. Gibbons and Judge
Phillips of the presecutton have been
continuously promising the public that
there is more to come, and even Judge
Cheney said last night that there were
to come â "
Judge Cheney Interrupted to say:
"I said we would have some Inter
resting matters to produce in rebuttal,
and I stand by that statement."
After some further debate the follow
ing resolution introduced by Poor was
adopted:
Resolved. That the attorneys In Â»hls
Investigation be required to prepare a
list of the interrogations to be presented
to each and every teacher, janitor or
other employe employed !n the School
Department of Los Angeles city not here
tofore examined in these proceedings,
which lift shall be printed and sent by
the Board of Education to each and tmtf
employe aforesaid, requiring- them to
answer the aforesaid interrogatories un
der an oath to tell the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth, and
that the said interrogatories thus taken
will be admitted as evidence in the pres
ent proceedings against Walter L. Webb
providing, however, that each side shall
have the right to recall any of the said
employes thus interrogated for further
examination. And it Is further under
stood and agreed by and between the at
torneys in the above proceedings that
the said depositions taken as aforesaid
shall be taken by the Board of Educa
tion as final evidence and as true, except
wherein it shall be contradicted or re
butted by other contradictory evidence
It is expected that all these affidavits
will be filed some time next week,
when the Investigation will be resumed.
Adjournment was taken until Monday
night out of respect to Attorney E. A.
Meserve and his late wife, who died
this evening.

Leap From a Train Near

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 6.â C. W. Fil
kins, after a desperate fight, was taken
into custody this afternoon and Is to
night en route to the penitentiary,
where he will serve five years for bur
glary.
Filkins is the most shrewd and dar
ing criminal Los Angeles County has
contributed in its quita of Folsom in
mates in many a day. He was formerly
more or less prominent as a real estate
operator in Southern California, but it
has since been demonstrated that as a
side line he followed the profession of
burglary and with great success. Fi
nally, however, the police landed him.
and then the supposed respectable
business man was uncovered as the
:.. at sagacious house burglar who had
ever operated in this section. It was
impossible to get more than one case
against him, but he was given the full
term Â«rben he was sentenced.
Filkins during his trial received
many attentions from Mac de Long, a
woman of the half-world. She en
deavored to plan for his escape, but
was frustrated in her designs.
Filkins, "however, was more success
ful. While he was being conveyed to
the penitentiary he jumped through
the car window of a moving train at
Fresno. He had an Oregon boot at
tached to his left leg. This impedi
ment did not prevent his getting away.
He had plenty of money and must have
used it, for his scheme to get away suc
ceeded.
Sheriff Burr did not drop the affair.
Filkins was shadowed rmm Fresno to
this city. Fur three weeks the Sherift
and his entire force of deputies have
been endeavoring to locate him. Finally
they succeeded, and it was through the
woman who had helped Filkins so
much that the escaped convict was at
lest uncovered in a Wilmington-street
lodging-house. As soon as it was as
certained to a certainty that Filkina
was there a force of flvt deputies was
detailed to bring him. They proceeded
to the h>. use. t'nder Sheriff Clements
and Deputy McClure entered from the
rear. Filkins was evidently warned,
fur he made a break for the front door
and started out. As soon as he opened
it his eyes rested on three stalwart
Deputy Sheriffs. They all drew re
volvers and ordered him to hold up his
hands.
For a reply he stepped back into the
house and slammed and locked the
door. He then ran down the hall Into
a side room, dodging Clements and
McCiure. and jumped through a win
dow. They followed, and McClure
fired at him. Filkins was caught like
a rat in a trap, for he could not scale
the back fence. He threw up his
hands and surrendered. He was con
veyed to Jail, and at 10 o'clock this
evening McClure started with him for
the penitentiary- Sheriff Burr accom
panies him.
Filkins curses his fate, but still
states with the same insistency that he
showed before that he will not serve
his sentence.
Before the train left for the north
to-night Filkins consented to tell a
brief story of his experiences. After he
jumped through the window near
Fresno he lay in a haystack hidden
for a day and a half. Then at night
he dragged himself to a blacksmith
6hop and filed the Oregon boot off. He
then took a brake beam ride to Por
terville. Thence he proceeded to Tip
ton, and, boarding a Southern Pacific
train, arrived In Los Angeles on
Christmas eve on a brake beam. He
has since been living -with the woman,
moving about in various parts of the
city. If the <.fficers had been five min
utes later he would have been gone,
for he had his effects all packed ready
to Jump to Arizona.

He Pleads With Governor
Wolcott for the Life of
Jack O'Neil.
Says He Was Not Justly Con

Mrs. McCloud.
HIS APPEAL IS FUTILE.
Despite Scientific Reasoning, the Con
demned Man Will Die on
Friday.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
BOSTON, Jan. s.â Jack O'Neil. the
murderer of Mrs. Hattie McCloud, will
hang on the day of Theodore Durrant's
execution. This is in spite of a most
startling attempt made to-day to save
him. The Governor said that after
considering the whole case carefully,
In his opinion sufficient cause had not
been shown to justify his interference
with the sentence, and that he did not
feel warranted in staying the execu
tion. In this conclusion the Lleuten
ant-Governor and members of the coun
cil present concurred.
An attempt to save the condemned
murderer from the gallows was made
at the State house to-day, when Dr.
Woodbridge of Williams College called
on Governor "Wolcott by appointment.
His argument was sensational. Briefly,
he purported to show that on the evi
dence of the Government O'Xeil waa
not justly convicted. He asserted in
effect that the medical examination of
the body of Mrs. McCloud was bung
lingly made, and that the report, so far
from establishing the facts which it
pretended to show, clearly established
their falsity. In other words, it was
clear to him that Mrs. McCloud was not
the victim of a heinous assault, and
that her neck was not broken by her
assailant, but by the physicians who
handled the body afterward. He ad
mitted that she died of suffocation, but
It was his theory that It was epileptic
asphyxia.
In proof, of his allegations concern
ing the neck not having been broken
until after it had been frozen, he pro
duced a portion of the trachea taken
from a woman 36 years old, or several
years older than Mrs. McCloud. He
defied any member of the council to
break it. His own studies in Vienna,
London and Bellevue Hospital, New
York, had taught him that the trachea
did not become brittle enough to break
until late in â fifty years usually in
women, seven or eight years younger
in men. Ossification sets in about that
time, the rings may be disjointed before
that time, of course, but the material
Itself, a cartilaginous substance, could
not be broken until ossification had
been produced. This his medical edu
cation had taught him.
Recently, however, in order to fortify
his argument, he had examined the
tracheas of seven bodies of or about
Mrs. McCloud's age and found his the
ory sustained. It was the trachea of
one of these that he produced in the
council chamber. He therefore af
firmed as admitting of no doubt what
ever that the neck was broken, not be
fore death, but after death.
The most important assertion, how
ever, was that which would be dis
cussed more fittingly in the pages of
a medical journal.
It was on the testimony of the physi
cians who examined the body he could
prove that no attack was committed.
Dr. Woodbridge also asserted and pro
duced authorities to show that the
physical condition of Mrs. McCloud.
which by the medical examiner's tes
timony tended to prove assault, were
in reality the necessary concomitants
of suffocation.
Dr. Woodhridge was one of the ex
perts summoned by the defense to tes
tify at th^ trial, but since his testi
mony at that time was covered by
other experts, it was not given. After
the trial was over Dr. Woodbridge took
all the medical evidence of the govern
ment and analyzed it. He soon arrived
at the conclusion that it was contradic
tory, and the deductions were unwar
ranted and dangerous. In the interest
of the future, of science and of the con
demned man he felt obliged to attempt
a stay of proceedings.
O'Neil is now doomed to die on Fri
day and the death watch is set. The
gallows is being erected in the County
Jail at Greenfield. O'Neil continues in
the best of spirits. His appetite is ex
cellent and he sleeps well. He still
maintains his innocence.
UNABLE TO RAISE
THE MORTGAGES
Financial Embarrassment of
C. H. Phillips, the Land
Speculator.
All His Property in Santa Clara and
San Luis Obispo Counties
Attached.
Bp*rlal Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. Jan. sâ An attachment
has been levied upon all the Santa
Clara County property of C. H. Phil
lips, the capitalist and land speculator
of San Luis Obispo and Santa Clara
counties, to satisfy $4182 75 due to
General P. W. Murphy of San Luis
Obispo on a note. For some time ru
mors have been in circulation as to
Phillips" insolvency and financial
straits. On December 28 the attach
ment papers were received from San
Luis Obispo. but the matter was kept
a secret and did not leak out until to
day.
Philllpe purchased the Morgan Hill
and San Martin ranches in this county
about five years ago, and placed them
upon the market to be sold in small
tracts. He also sold several large
tracts in San Luis Obispo and estab
lished the town of Templeton. His
property in this county sold well and
he made considerable money, but dur-
Ing the past year he has been dilatory
in meeting bills. The property he has
In this county is all heavily mortgaged
and it is doubtful whether there will
be enough left to satisfy the mortgage
of $4182 75 levied a few days ago.
Mrs. Diana Murphy Hill has a large
mortgage on the Morgan Hill ranch,
and there are two mortgages on the
San Martin ranch. The first is held
by the San Francisco Savings Union,
and the second by the Commercial and
Savings Bank of San Jose. It is im
possible to tell just the amount of
these mortgages, as a certain per cent
of the sales is devoted to their liquida
tion, but the mortgages are far in ex
cess of the value of the land.
HIS MIND UNBALANCED
BY EXCESSIVE DRINKING.
Ben Bah well, a Visa/ia Blacksmith, Makes
an Unsuccessful Attempt at Self
Destruction.
VISALIA. Jan. s.â Ben Bahwell, a
well-to-do blacksmith of this place,
made a cool attempt to commit suicide
this afternoon. He went to a drug
store and bought a small bottle of laud
anum, but when he told the druggist
that he expected to see him no more
the druggist at once took the poison
away from him. Bahwell then visited
another drug store and obtained an
ounce of laudanum, for family use, he
said. Here the druggist noticed that
Bahwell acted rather strangely, for he
shook hands and said good by before
leaving the store. The druggist noti
fied the City Marshal, who went at once
to the blacksmith shop and told Bah
well's brother what he had done. The
brother hurried to Ben's house and
reached the room jusf as the would-be
suicide was preparing to swallow the
poison. As the bottle was taken from
him he declared he would try to take
his life some other time. Bahwell has a
wife and two small children, but hard
drinking has unseated his reason.
A NEW WITNESS
AGAINST ROUP
San Joaquin County Wants the
Napa Burglar for Train
Robbery.
In Any Event It Seems That the
Prisoner Cannot Escape Life
Imprisonment.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NAPA, Jan. 5. â Sheriff Cunningham
of Stockton wired to the District Attor
ney of Napa C"unty this morning that
he would not demand James Roup, the
burglar, and whatever action was taken
here against the accused would not be
opposed. Sheriff Cunningham stated,
however, that Roup would be indicted
by the San Joaquin Grand Jury.
Roup, it will be remembered, com
mitted burglary in Napa one night last
week and was apprehended. His pic
ture was printed exclusively in The
Call and it led to the discovery that
he was the missing third bandit in the
attempted train robbery near Lathrop
last September.
As matters now stand the man will
probably go for life from this county.
He will plead guilty to the charge of
burglary, it is believed, and this with
prior sentences in the State Prison en
ables his being sent up for life. He was
arraigned in the Superior Court this
afternoon and asked if he wished an
attorney. He answered in the affirm
ative, and the Court appointed John T.
York, to represent him. Time for plead
ing was set for to-naorrow morning at
10 o'clock.
Late this evening Sheriff McKenzie
received another message from Sheriff
Cunningham, stating that a new wit
ness against Roup for the train rob
bery had been discovered, and that the
accused would be demanded by San
Joaquin County.
STANFORD'S NEW BILLET
FOR BILLY McLEOD.
The Clever Trainer of Its Football Squad Is
Chosen to Act as Rubber for the
Track Team.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Jan. 5.â
"Billy" McLeod, the man who did such
efficient and conscientious -work as
trainer of the Stanford football squad
of last season, has been selected by
Track Manager Gregory aijd Track
Captain Brunton to act as rubber fbr
the track team. He will arrive on Jan
uary 15, when hard training will be
gin. McLeod will merely look after the
condition of the men. The training of
the new men will be done by the old
members of the track team. Captain
Brunton will look after the sprints, ex-
Captain Dole will keep an eye on the
pole vaulting and the jumps. Paul Wal
ker will have charge of the distance
men. and Charlie Fickert the weights.
It was not until after long and se
rious consideration of the matter that
the representatives of the students de
cided to adopt this new policy, which
does away with the professional track
coach. The faculty athletic committee,
who strongly object to the introduction
of the professional element into college
athletics, are more than pleased that
the students have decided to find train
ers among the old men now on the
track and alumni members who will as
sist in the work. There is, however, a
large number of students who, while
not opposed to the experiment, have
great faith In the professional trainer.
It is hoped that by having a number
of men interested in the development
of the team, the second-class men
will receive more attention than they
have heretofore, and this neglect of
those who do not show up immediately
as crackajacks is one of the strongest
arguments against the professional
trainer.
Among the students who will enter
this semester there will at least be two
men who should be valuable additions
to the team. Trenchman of Portland"
Or., has a record of 6 feet in the high
jump. Billy Jordan of the same place
has done remarkably good work in the
sprints.
There is a proposition before the exe
cutive committee of the student body
to erect a training house within the
oval. The matter will be settled as
soon as college reopens.

DOUBLE LIFE

First Wife of the Actor

Attorneys Send to London for
the Daughter of the Fish
monger.
Asked to Come to America to Appear
Against the Husband Who De
serted Her.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. s.â The argument
on the application for a certificate of
reasonable doubt of the legality of the
conviction of Actor Ratcliffe for wife
beating was on again to-day before
Justice Dickey in Brooklyn. Should
the certificate be granted Ratcliffe
would be released on bail, pending an
appeal to the higher court.
Assistant District Attorney Lloyd
says that the Grand Jury will be asked
to indict Ratcliffe on the statement of
Caroline Ravenhill of Loadon that he
married her in 1883 and deserted her
and her baby in September, 1888, Rat
cliffe having testified on his own trial
for beating Alice de Lacey Ratcliffe
that the latter was his only wife.
District Attorney Gardiner has ca
bled to London asking Caroline Ra
venhill to come to Xew York and ap
pear as a witness against Ratcliffe.
Howe & Hummel, attorneys for Rat
cliffe"s wife, received a cablegram to
day from their London representative
stating that he was mailing to them
an official copy of the marriage certifi
cate of Edward J. Ratcliffe to Caroline
Ravenhill, a fishmonger's daughter, on
August 19, 18S3. Their representative
also stated that several columns re
garding Ratcliffe's antecedents were
published in to-day's Mail. Howe &
Hummel instructed their representa
tive to send the woman to this coun
try on the next steamer. According to
Howe & Hummel, their London repre
sentative obtained confirmation of the
story of Ratcliffe's English marriage
from the fathers of both parties to the
alleged marriage. They also declare
that the father of the Ravenhill
woman had a letter written by Rat
cliffe to his daughter while the actor
was in this country, in which Rat
cliffe was alleged to have asked after
the health of his son.

On the stand to-day Dr. Leverson
said that he believed what he said of
Comstock to have been true then, and
does so still.

Miss Mead Tells Why She Resorted
to Such an Unusual
Method.
"With manacles on his hands and

Knight. a pupil of the John Swett even- j
ing school, was whipped on the hands i
with a strap by the principal of the in- !
stitutlon about three weeks ago, and !
now certain members of the Bqard of j
Education, who object to corporal pun- t
iehment, are preparing to investigate
the matter. Their attention was called \
to the case by statements madp by pu- <
pile showing that unusual severity in
the matter of punishment is sometimes â¢
meted out in this institution.
That the case of McKnight was an
extraordinary one is evidenced not only
by his own story and that of his school- j
mates, but by the statement of Miss i
Mead, the principal, who admits that j
she strapped the boy while handcuffs
circled his wrists.
McKnight is 14 years of age, a small
and not very robust boy, and despite
the stories that he is unruly and hard
to control neither his actions nor words
when spoken to indicate anything of
the kind. He is steadily employed in
a Market-street hatstore during the
day and assisting his father and in
valid mother with whom he resides on
Fell street, to make the McKnight
home comfortable. His employers
speak of him as a steady, industrious
boy.
Night school is the only opportunity
afforded him to gain an education and
he has been an attendant at the John
Swett evening school for four months
past. He tells the story of how he
was handcuffed by Special Policeman
Kelly, who is also janitor of the school,
in a straightforward manner that car- ;
ries conviction with it.
"Two or three weeks ago I was called
into Miss Mead's room one evening," he
said, "and told to hold out my hanis
for punishment I asked the reason
of this and was told that I had been j
caught playing ball in the Bchcol and ,
must be punished. I was not guilty !
and denied the accusation, at the same !
time refusing to hold out my hands.
"Then Miss Mead called Kelly, the i
janitor, and before I knew what was j
going on he had snapped a pair of j
handcuffs on my hands, and I could not
help being whipped. I got it good, too,
Kelly holding me while the principal
laid on the heavy strap with which the
boys are punished.
"My mother and sisters complained
about mv being whipped in this way,
but it did no good. I would have gone
to the Board of Education or had some
one else do so before this, but I was
told that I would have to have a law
yer and it would cost a lot of money.
"I work all the time that I can get
anything to do, and I don't think I
should have been punished in this way
even though I did commit some little
offense and then refused to take a
whipping.
"I am told that suspension was the
proper kind of punishment, and I know
that I tpld Misa Mead at the time that
I would rather be dismissed than take
such a thing again."
Janitor Kelly, who was seen last
evening, flatly denied the story told by
McKnight and Miss Mead, affirming
that he had never handcuffed a boy in
the school in his term of service there
and his story differs In every particu
lar from that told by the boy and prin
cipal.
"Miss Mead called me one evening,"
he said, "and told me that she wanted
mo to help her punish a boy. I found
McKnight thrashing about the office,
refusing to hold out his hands, and
â  told him he would have to behave or I
would take care of him.
"For an answer he made a kick at
me and I took out my handcuff 3to In
timidate him. Then he gave in and I
law that he was well punished. I never
put the ruffs on any boy In the school,
though I arrested four at different
' times for various offenses. I would pre
fer you to see Miss Mead about this
f case; she will tell you all about it, and
Just as I do, that the cuffs were not
: : . .used."
': Miss Mead did tell "all abput it," but
she differs materially about the man
â 'â  acles.
â¢ "James McKnight Is an unruly boy,"
â  : she said, "and he was handcuffed by
â Janitor Kelly so that he could be strap
. ped.
"I had heard complaints about him
a number of times, and I made up my
m!nd to punish him the first oppor
tunity. One night a substitute was
Bnnt Into the class, and she com
plained that MeKnight had been rude
to her and had made a large amount
of noise after she had admonished him
tv be quiet."
Just then a door opened near the
office and a chorus of yells resembling
those of a boatload of school boys go
ing down the Chutes came forth.
â¢'That is the class McKnight at
tends, said Miss Mead. "So you see
what it Ib. Well, I went to the room,
and as soon as I got there McKnight
did something as much as to say that
he was not afraid of me and I told
him to go to the office for punishment.
"He was defiant, and when I told
him to hold out his hands refused to
do so. I asked the Janitor to
< 'me In and see that I was obeyed,
and he did so. McKnight said that if
he was strapped his hands would have
to be held, and then Mr. Kelly put the
handcuffs on him. He submitted with
out the least fuss and received the
customary five lashes on each hand.
I used the strap that Mr. Lyser
uses, and 1 know that it hurts, 'too,
for they never come back for a second
d '' se - J can see no wrong in having
the boy handcuffed to whip him, and
I should do the same thing again.
"I expected that there would be a
fuss over the matter, and two days
after it occurred went and told the
president of the board all about it.
McKnight has caused no trouble since
|c was stopped. Hid sister tells me
that he is a troublesome boy at home,
and has asked me to punish him se
verely if necessary."
Miss Mead is petite and pretty, and
her black eyes flashed as she told of
McKnight's misdoings. There were
evidently other unruly classes in the
school, for while being interviewed she
dismissed another boy who said he
could not be good because half the
class was throwing rubbers, books and
other movables.
ACADEMY OF SCIENCES.
Annual Meeting at Which Officers
Were Elected for the En
suing Year.
The annual meeting of the Academy
of Sciences was held on Monday and
officers were elected for the ensuing
year. There was no opposition to the
regrular ticket, wjiich was as follows:
President, William E. Ritter; first vice
president. Charles H. Gilbert; second
vice-president, EL H. Behr; correspond
ing secretary. J. 08. Gunn; recording

trusteesâ William M. Piers=on. James * .
Houghton, William H. < "rocker. C. E.
Grunsky, E. J. Molera, George C. Per
kins and G. W. Stewart.
In rendering his report David Starr
Jordan, the retiring president deliv
ered a lengthy account of the doings
of the society for the past year. He
said in part:
The chief functions of a society of this
kind may bf> briefly stated as follows:
The popularization of science by means
of public meetings and lectures at which
scientific questions shall be discussed In
an Intelligible way by men recognized as
authorities on the subject under consia
ei Another way in which science can be
popularized is by means of exhibition of
collections which shall show for them
selves the facts of biology and ethnol
ogy. By the maintenance of such a lib
rary in the center of the city the acad
emy has s=Â»<rv*>d a valuable purpose to the
scholars of San Francisco and the towns
lying about the bay.
The lack of funds with which to
carry on the academy was commented
on, as also that of its taxation, as fol
lows:
The gross income for the past year was
J27.888 11. Its taxes wero $6751 39. Tilts
mean way of treating gifts is not due to
any lack of appreciation or of hospitality
on the part or the people of California.
It is due merely to the fact that wo live
under a constitution which James Bryce
declares to be the worst under which any
civilized State has ever transacted its af
fairs.
The deaths of H. N. Bolander,
Charles F. Crocker. Thomas P. Mad
den, Luke Robinson, L. F. Reichling
and Francis X. Simon were men
tioned, as was also the honorary mem
bership of E. D. Cope and George H.
Horn.
THE FIRST OF THE RUSH.
Mlrjers Frori) Eureka Outfitting for
fllasKa io a Hurry.
"When the Alaska Trade Bureau
opened yesterday morning there was
unusual activity on the part of the
visitors and attendants. The exhibit
rooms were fully crowded and addi
tional interest was given to the early
hours by the fact that a party of fif
teen men, who came from Eureka,
were In such a hurry to secure Infor
mation in directions, as they wished to
sail by the Umatilla to-day if possible.
After looking over the exhibit
the Eureka party started out to pur
chase the supplies and outfit neces
sary for a long stay in the Alaskan
gold fields. They hope to be able .to
get all the necessaries together in
time to take the steamer for Skaguay
this morning, but in case of delay some
members of the party may remain in
the city until the Walla Walla sails.
The party was prepared to buy cloth-
Ing and provisions sufficient to last
them not less than a year.
In addition to these miners who out
fitted yesterday more than seventy
persons registered their names on the
books of the Alaska Trade Committee.
This was outside of all inquiries by
mail. It is the practice of the clerk in
charge of the registry list to person
ally inquire if the persons registering
contemplate going to Alaska, and
while a large quantity of literature is
given out to persons who are merely
asking information no record of the
names and addresses of any persons
are kept, except where they give as
surance that they have made up their
minds to go to the Klondike. Up to
the present time over 1100 persons
have been registered, and the practice
of the committee in taking the names
and addresses of such visitors was
only begun within two weeks.
HOFF HELD FOR MURDER.
HÂ« Will Reserve His Defense for
trje Superior Court.
Albert Hoff, charged with the murder
of Mrs. Mary A. Clute, was yesterday
held to answer before the Superior
Court by Judge Joachimsen without
bail.
When the case was called yesterday
moruing Attorney Schooler announced
that the defense would offer no testi
mony bo as not to expose its hand, sav
ing It for the higher court. He moved
that the testimony of Mayer May, the
witness who testified to having seen a
coupling pin in the possession of Hoff
about two years ago, be stricken out
of the record on the ground that he
waÂ« a thoroughly Incompetent witness,
but the court ruled against him. He
then moved to dismiss the case on the
ground that sufficient cause had not
been shown to warrant the court In
holding Hoff, but the Judge dismissed
the motion and held the defendant to
answer.
LAUNC H OF THE CHITOS.
February 20 Is the Day Set for
the Great Ever;t.
All the men that can conveniently
work on the Japanese war vessel Chl
tos, now In course of construction at
the Union Iron Works, are busy put
ting the finishing touches on her huge
body. In addition to the men engaged
on the vessel proper there are corps
of engineers at work down in the en
gine room putting the machinery to>
gether which will propel the huge mass
of steel through the water when set
In motion.
The 20th of February Is the day set
for the launching of the vessel, and in
order that there may be no mishaps,
everything that can be foreseen to pre
vent any accidents is being looked af
ter with care. A dredger is now en
gaged in the bay in front of the slip,
from where the vessel will glide from
her berth into the water.
Union League Club Election.
Considerable interest is felt by mem

DIRTY DOG
Row in the Board of
Election Commis
sioners.
Creswell and Black in an
Exchange of Com
pliments.
The Attorney's Even Temper
Suddenly Deserts
Him.
PHELAN ALSO SQUELCHED.
âââââ
Official Count Does Not Differ Mate
rially From the Semi
official.
"If you were not a miserable dirty
dog I'll pull the nose off your face,"
said City and County Attorney Cres
well to Tax Collector Block yesterday
in his calmest and suavest tones, and,
moreover, he looked as though he
meant what he said.
The remark quoted was the climax
of an acrimonious debate during the
session of the Election Commissioners.
The Board met to officially declare the
result of the late election, and, after
that had been done, Commissioner
Block moved that those who had been
engaged in canvassing the returns be
allowed $25 for their services.
"Surely, that is too much," protest
ed Mr. Creswell. "These men have
worked only a day and a half, and I
understand the compensation to be at
the rate of $10 per day."
"Well, they have worked longer
than the heads of departments in this
government," said Mr. Block.
"How do you mean?" asked Cres
well.
"I mean." returned Block, "that of
fice hours In this City Hall are only
six hours a day, when these men here
worked much longer."
"What your hours may be I know
not, sir," Creswell retorted. "But, as
for me, I am at my office by half-past
8 or 9 every morning, and I never leave
before half-past 6 or quarter to 6."
"H'm, you've got work to do,"
sneered Block. "You're busy, you
are."
"Yes, I have work to do," returned
Creswell, calmly. "So have you, and
so have all the heads of departments,
If they will only do It."
"Well, you're paid for It, ain't you?"
said Block.
"Yes, sir," returned Creswell, chil
lingly. "So are you. But you are not
paid to spend two or three hours every
day down town attending to your pri
vate business. Yet you do so."
"I don't Intend to be criticized by any
Commissioner," returned Block. "I
think your remark is impertinent and
Insulting. I don't propose to submit to
such remarks."
"Mr. Block, If any remark was In
sulting, there is but one way to resent
It. You are at liberty to take that
course, sir," was Mr. Cresweil's calm
reply, though it was evident that trou
ble was brewing.
Block shrugged his shoulders. "I
treat your remarks with contempt,
sir."
This was too much for the City and
County Attorney, who In a Southerner.
With his eyes blazing, he faced Block
and said: "If you were not a poor,
miserable, dirty dog I'd pull the nose
off your face."
Mayor Phelan attempted to take a
hand, and hammered hie gravel on the
desk, but he was promptly squelched.
"This Is my affair, sir," said Com
missioner Creswell, "and I do not In
tend to be shut off. When Insults are
offered, they should be resented, sir."
The shell of Indifference again cov
ered the Mayor and the Incident closed
with the exit of Block.
The official count showed that the
various candidates fared as follows:

MISS SNYDER
WILL APPLY
FOR DIVORCE
Not a Single Friend
Knew She Was
Married.
Another Sensation That
Startled Oakland
Society.
Crossed the Bay to Wed a Man
Who Talked About His
Riches.
HER FEARFUL DISCOVERY.
Married to Marsh, Who Stated That
He Was a Partner of a Cattle
King.
Oakland still continues to deserve Its
title of the "hatchery of the unexpect
ed." If society was shocked a week
ago by the McKlslck-Bruglere elope
ment it was electrified yesterday when
It became known that Miss Lilian Sny
der was preparing to file a suit for di
vorce.
No one was aware that Miss Snyder
had taken any of the preparatory
steps, such as contracting marriage,
suffering from domestic unhappiness,
â ad many other Incidents that pave
the way to the divorce court. She has
always been looked upon as one of the 1
most attractive and vivacious Oak
land belles, and owing to the wealth of
her father, the well-known capitalist,
who owned a large portion of Oakland
and who died a few months ago, her
charms were not considered to belong
solely to her personal beauty, but her
claim to the title of heiress added
much to the interest the male
branch of local society took in the
young lady.
True it is that occasionally rumors
of an engagement to some wealthy
suitor in the far East reached Oak
land. But there was not sufficient
foundation in them to prevent her
from being looked upon as an eligible
catch for any one with charms enough
to aspire for her hand, heart and any
thing else properly belonging to her.
From what can be learned it now
transpires that Miss Lilian Snyder for
feited her right to use that name some
months ago, and since that time she
has been Mrs. Marsh. So carefully has
her secret been guarded that even her
own relatives are not ail aware of the
event that has recently rome to light.
Miss Snyder nine days previous to her
marriage came to San Francisco and
met an attractive, dashing young fel
low named Marsh. He represented to
! her that he was wealthy, and his dia
monds, ready ca.h and dapper cloth
ing seemed to bear out his statement.
He completely captivated Miss Sny
der, and each of the nine days brought
the affections of the young people
closer together.
Marsh told Miss Snyder that he was
a partner of Mr. White, who is known
as the cattle king of Mendocino County.
By such stories and other inducements
added to his gentlemanly conduct and
appearance the Oakland girl was com
pletely won over. Without giving warn
ing to anybody a license was procured
and the young couple were properly
married.
Immediately after the marriage the
young wife's eyes were opened and she
quickly realized that she had made the
mistake of her life. Little by little the -.
horrible truth dawned upon her and be
fore a week had passed she discovered
that her V jsband was v man of no
reputation and is believed to be the
same J. Marsh who, as the partner of
Howell, the notorious counterfeiter, fig
ured in the local courts for several
months In the early part of last year.
Miss Snyder's brother. A. J. Snyder,
was asked yesterday afternoon when
his sister was married. He could not
tell the exact date, but said it occurred
in San Francisco and that immediately
after the marriage she returned to her
home in Oakland and told him of what
she had done. He said she had never ,
lived with Marsh as his wife, and that
after learning of the affair he at once ]
came to San Francisco and discovered
that his sister's worst fears were real
ized.
A visit was made by Secret Service
Agent Harris a few days ago and to
him Mrs. Marsh told her story. The
object of her visit was to procure evi
dence regarding her husband upon
Which to bmmt her suit for divorce. Mr.
Harris supplied all the information de
sired and When Been to-night by a Call
! reporter he said that although Marsh
admitted when on the stand that he
was a professional gambler, this was
one of his mildest disadvantages.
Ex-City Attorney James A. Jo-hn
| son has been retained to handle the
' case for the girl, and this afternoon he ;
! stated that he would not say whether
ft criminal action might not be instl- ;
tuted as well as a divorce suit. He also j
stated that the police in San Francisco i
could put their hands on the man at I
any time and that the papers would ,
soon be filed and the summons served. \
"The family is heart-broken over the '
affair," said Mr. Snyder Jr., "and I
am not authorized to make any state
ment for Lilian, who is too ill to be
seen. The truth will come out soon
enough."
Mrs. Marsh is staying at present with
Mr. W. B. King at 1313 Seventh ave
nue. East Oakland. Mr. King was
asked last night if he knew where Mrs.
Marsh could be found. He said that
she was at home and had not been at
his house that day.
"She is not on intimate enough rela
tions with our family for me to ask
any questions," he said. "When she
told us that she was married, no ques
tions were asked her. I do not
know what she intends to do. But I
do know that she married a man of
poor reputation."
Mrs. Carrie Frost-Snyder, a relative
of the family by marriage, only
learned the truth to-day. "I cannot
believe it," she said, "because Lilian
is engaged to a wealthy manufacturer
of Toledo, Ohio, and the marriage was
to come off shortly. I have never even
guessed that there had been any such
event in the family, so carefully must
it have been guarded."
The Snyder family is one of the old
est, best-known and wealthy families
in this city. Miss Lilian was theÂ»last
of the family to get married, but her
wedding was far from being the one
that society had anticipated.

GOING NEW YORK ONE BETTER.
THE plan to make a separate State of the
majestically swollen city of New York will
be recognized as having points of excellence.
That place contains much of the wealth, the aris
tocracy and the brains of the land. Any New
Yorker will tell you so. It is also cultured to a
degree almost awesome. Anybody who doubts
this has only to reflect that its best people had
crystallized into a select Four Hundred and that
this aggregation has been pruned down to a super
select Seventy-five. Where but in New York
would so just and proper a division have been
made? Every one of these Seventy-five knows
what to wear to dinner, and in the park rides be
hind a bang-tailed horse. They are blue-blooded,
too. None in the lot admits descent from a clam
peddler, calmly and with unquestioned wisdom
eliminating such ancestors as irrelevant to the
present situation. So New York deserves to be a
State if such is its desire. But it is too modest.
Xew York should be a kingdom. To set up a
throne and on it place the mighty Croker, to build
up a local nobility â for which much raw material
is now going to waste â nothing could be finer nor
more in keeping with the genius of the times.
With a nobility of its own New York would no
longer be under the painful necessity of hawking its
daughters to paupers from abroad. It could sustain
with the United States such relations as must nat
urally obtain between the pedigreed and the scrub,
and by erecting a dividing wall keep the plebeians
of the West from getting too fresh. Altogether it
is a beautiful scheme. The only embarrassment to
be anticipated springs from the multiplicity of ap
plicants there would inevitably be for the position
of court fool.
THE RUSH FOR ALAKSA.
A RECENT di?patch from Chicago to the New
York Press says that Western passenger
agents are now making their arrangements
to handle the Alaskan rush, and the longer they
study the traffic the larger it appears to them. It
is said, "There is hardly a Western passenger man
who does not expect the traffic to amount to fully
200,000 persons."
That the estimate is exaggerated is beyond ques
tion. It is hardly probable that anything like that
number of persons will start for Alaska from
points where the roads of the Western Passenger
Association will get a share of the business. The
exaggeration itself, however, is a proof of the ex
tent of the Alaskan excitement in the East. It
seems to be of even larger proportions beyond the
Rockies than on this coast, and is apparently in
creasing every day.
As every ship that comes down from the north
brings additional confirmation to the stories of last
summer concerning the marvelous richness of the
new placers there will be no diminution of the
popular ardor on the subject. On the contrary,
many of those who at first doubted the wonderful
tales told of the Klondike have ceased to be skep
tical in the face of the evidence givÂ«n of their es
sential truthfulness.
Another factor that will have a tendency to in
crease the number of adventurers is the extension
and improvements of facilities for reaching Daw
6on. It is now certain that the journey nÂ«xt season
will be far less hazardous and difficult than it has
been. Moreover, there will be hardly any fears of
famine next year. These facts will solve the doubts
of many who would have hesitated to venture into
the frozen north under past conditions and will thus
swell the number that with the coming of spring will
hasten to this coast to arrange for the journey to
the gold fields at the earliest date possible.
All signs tend to the conclusion that those who
are looking for an extraordinary rush to San Fran
cisco early in the spring will not bÂ« disappointed.
We can hardly overdo the work of preparation for
the coming trade. There is but one city on the Pa
cific Coast that can handle such an amount of
traffic That city is of course San Francisco, and
even with her commercial facilities she may find
her energies strained to meet the emergency.
As to the actual situation at Dawson, it seems to
be that there is sufficient shortage of food to stim
ulate the commercial instinct and induce specu
lators to see which can get there first with the
privilege of charging famine prices.
Colorado produced more gold than any other
State in the Union last year. It is hard for Cali
fornia to give up its accustomed place temporarily,
but it might as well do so pleasantly. It still leads
in so many things that it can afford to be gracious.
A month's run at one Amador County mine
yielded $50,000. Naturally there are some people
to whom it is useless to talk of the riches of the
Klondike. â¢
SPECIAL LAWS FOR HAWAII.
THE Chronicle should not get reckless. It
should trust to the healing influence of time
to cicatrize the wound made in its hopes by
the defeat of annexation. Such a poultice as its
editorial anger makes will inflame the sore spot.
It has said, among other enraged and lurid things,
that the labor organizations don't know what they
r.re talking about, that the "annexation treaty ex
tends our humane labor laws to Hawaii and sub
stitutes freedom for slavery," etc. Well, if that is
so, the labor organizations are in the distinguished
company of President McKinley, who says in his
message:
"What the conditions of such union (with
Hawaii) shall be, the political relation thereof to
the United States, the character of the local ad
ministration, the quality and degree of the
elective franchise to the inhabitants, the ex
tension of the Federal laws to the territory,
or the enactment of special law* to fit
the peculiar condition* thereof, the reg
ulation. IF IYI:EI> BE, of the I \ltOlt
system therein, are all matters which
the treaty has wisely relegated to Con.
fjress."
The Call has said that somebody is being
cheated, either the planters of Hawaii or the white
labor of the United States. The Chronicle flies
mad at this, and with congested face and corru
gated front raises an apoplectic shriek of "You
lie!''
Will it tell frankly whom it is trying to cheat by
telling white labor that the treaty "extends our hu
mane labor laws to Hawaii" when President Mc-
Kinley says it does not? Why not tote fair? The
plot stands exposed. Shah Dole and his planters
know that they must have Asiatic labor, and he
says he believes we will give them a separate law
to protect penal contracts with such labor.
We don't think the Chronicle will deceive any
one but its clients, whom it may deceive into the
belief that it can deceive white labor in this State.
But white labor is not like its description of the
Azores and Cape Verde islanders in Hawaii. It
reads and writes and ciphers, and can figure as well
as the Chronicle. It knows on which side to butter
its bread and uses butter for that purpose.
THE OHIO CONTEST.
BY no means creditable to them in any respect
is the contest which a factious minority of
the Ohio Legislature is waging against the
election of Senator Hanna to the oiTice he now
holds by appointment It appears from all reports
to be a fight made solely from motives of personal
spite and is not justified on any ground of public
benefit or even party advantage.
The appointment of Senator Hanna to the
United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by
the retirement of Secretary Sherman was cordially
approved by almost the whole membership of the
Republican party of the State. When the time
came to prepare for the campaign of last summer
Mr. Hanna was put forward by the Republicans as
their candidate for the Senate. Nearly every
county convention of the party indorsed him. His
candidacy was a conspicuous feature of the can
vass. The attacks of the Democratic and Populist
fusion were directed much more against him than
against the Republican candidate for Governor.
The election of a Republican Legislature under
such circumstances was a proof that Mr. Hanna is
the choice of the Ohio voters as well as of his party
for the Senatorship. The Republicans who are
now opposing him are therefore violating their ex
press pledges to the people and the express com
mands of the people to them.
If the Republican bolters gave any reasonable
excuse for their opposition the case against them
would not be so bad. They have advanced, how
ever, no excuse whatever except to assert that Mr.
Hanna has treated them badly and they are now re
venging themselves. Even the Governor, who has
taken a prominent part in the fight on the side of
the factionists, has no defense to offer for his
course except to assert that since he appointed
Hanna to the Senatorship the Senator has "waged
a cruel and unrelenting war" upon him.
The Governor's plea of "cruel and unrelenting
war" is eclipsed, however, by the plea of Represen
tative Griffith that he can never consent to vote
for Mr. Hanna because of indignities heaped upon
his wife. In the extraordinary letter addressed to
the public on this subject Mr. Griffith does nf>t
state the nature of the alleged indignities, nor does
he give the names of the men who committed
them. He simply strikes the attitude of an indig
nant husband and makes a grand stand play of
avenging a wrong done to his spouse.
Under ordinary conditions the people could af
ford to laugh in derision at this faction quarrel of
little men over petty spites and imaginary griev
ances, but unfortunately the conditions of politics
are not ordinary. The Republican administration
at Washington needs a strong and vigorous sup
port in the Senate, where the equal division of par
ties threatens to seriously interfere with the enact
ment of important legislation essential to the wel
fare of the country. A factional strife in Ohio that
threatens to weaken Republican supremacy in the
Senate is therefore a matter of national concern.
If the bolters persist in their determination to de
feat the will of the party and of the people they
might as well bid farewell to political life. At the
next election the Republicans whom they have be
trayed will follow the counsel given by a stalwart of
party discipline and "conciliate them with an ax."
The matter of pugilism is of no great importance,
and yet the literary persons who pose as champions
manage to keep up a sort of interest in it. This in
terest just now takes the form of wonder that two
large-fisted non-fighting fighters who are 60 bliss
fully certain each that the other is making a bluff
do not call the bluff and let the world have peace.
One lady correspondent in the Klondike has be
come the wife of "Nigger Jim." We hasten to con
gratulate the gentleman, as there are, it is under
stood here, a paucity of eligible women in that
country. However, out of respect to his new dig
nity he should insist on being called "Negro
James."
It is reported that the train robbers who attacked
an express car at Kansas City were very nervous.
As they got what they went after and nobody at
tempted to interfere it seems probable that however
nervous they may have been they had no monopoly
of the prevalent tremors.
There has just been a peculiar pair of duels in
Hungary. Somebody got hurt in each event. Such
a violation of precedent will be apt to discourage
statesmen from resort to physical rudeness. It is
just as effective to make faces at the opposition.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 6, 1898.
THE attention of all respectable people may at
this moment with much propriety be called to
the serious plight of the two moral reform
newspapers of this city. Within a month these
sheets have jointly conducted a campaign for "good
government." They have supported a Board of
Freeholders nominated by a respectable association
of merchants, and in the name of those merchants
they have claimed a part in the victory which has
been won. Each has loudly proclaimed itself the
possessor of all the virtues and the repository of all
the morality of the town. Yet while thus masquer
ading in the livery of Heaven each has been serv
ing the devil in true Satanic fashion.
One of these moral reform organs was long ago
convicted of contracting with the Southern Pacific
Company for thirty months of editorial silence at
Siooo a month. The brazen effrontery with which
it has since coughed down this judgment has been
the wonder of the State. Evidently it has reasoned
that repentance is unprofitable, for while ignoring
its record and while conducting the reform cam
paign to which we have referred it has been de
tected in and convicted of falsifying a telegram,
distributing anonymous circulars in the name of a
local trade committee for the purpose of injuring
the business of a rival, and publishing false "want"
advertisements, to the injury of humble people who
are sufficiently foolish to rely upon its advertising
columns.
At the same time the partner in "reform" of this
degraded sheet has been caught and convicted of
tricking business men into signing contracts for
advertising and collecting money by threats of
legal proceedings under such contracts. Confront
ed with its infamy, this moral reform organ has
acted exactly as its coadjutor in crime did when
confronted with the railroad "advertising" con
tract. It has made a loud display of its virtue and
emitted a torrent of abuse of its critics.
The Call cherishes no ambition to become the
journalistic censor of San Francisco. We do not
set ourselves up as a paragon of virtue, nor can we
compel any other journal to imitate our efforts to
publish truthful news or conduct its business as
the business of an honest journal should be con
ducted. It is disagreeable to expose newspaper cor
ruption. We know that when the mask is torn from
the face of a journalistic scoundrel a reproach is
cast upon the entire profession. We know that
thoughtless people will say that in exposing the
Bulletin and in laying bare the hypocrisy and cor
ruption of the Examiner we are governed by ig
noble motives.
Yet somebody must do this work or journalism
in this city will soon be in the gutter. When a
newspaper like the Bulletin, upon whose roll of
honor are emblazoned the names of James King of
William, James Nesbitt, Dr. Turtle, J. W. Simon
ton, Benjamin P. Avery, Loring Pickering and
George K. Fitch, descends to securing advertising
contracts by fraud and extorting money thereunder
by threats it is certainly time for somebody to rush
to the rescue of journalism in San Francisco.
Philip A. Roach and George Perm Johnston long
ago turned over in their graves for the Examiner.
The illustrious dead of the Bulletin will have to
arise in their winding sheets to do their feelings jus
tice.
But what is the remedy for this kind of journal
ism? Will the people continue to patronize news
papers which thus, in the guise of moral reform or
gans, practice the arts of highwaymen, which black
mail corporations and business men with equal
recklessness and which sell their subscribers to the
criminals of society without compunction? The
Merchants' Association is paying the penalty of as
sociating with the Bulletin. Thirty-six of its mem
bers at least have been robbed. All the people of
San Francisco may yet be called upon to pay the
penalty of supporting the Rulletin and Examiner.
When that time arrives they will not have it to say
that they were taken in unawares. The Call at
least will be able to affirm that it did its duty, dis
agreeable and exacting though jt was.
A LOS ANGELES ACCOMPLISHMENT.
OXE of the notable successes of holiday jour
nalism has been achieved by the "midwin
ter number" of the Los Angeles Times. The
publication is an attractive one and forms a valu
able advertisement for the whole southern section
of the State.
The main portion of the edition is issued in a
form half the ordinary size of the paper and con
sists of eighty-eight pages. This is a veritable com
pendium of the resources, attractions, advantages,
industries and prominent leaders of Southern Cali
fornia. It is well written, well printed, handsomely
illustrated, and will be found instructive as well as
interesting to all concerned in the welfare and
progress of the seven flourishing counties to which
Los Angeles serves as a metropolis.
While the edition as a matter of course is largely
devoted to the wonderful fruit industry of that sec
tion, considerable space is given to the mineral
wealth and mining industry. The number is there
fore pertinent to the coming exposition of mines
and mining in San Francisco. It will recall the at
tention of the south to her great mineral resources
and make known the importance of exhibiting
them where all the world can see. Taken alto
gether, the number is a successful one in every re
spect and deserves a wide circulation, not only in
California, but throughout the East.
The question of whether or not a man having
fred two bullets into his brain could summon up
fortitude to fire a third and then compose himself
to rest, after having carefully laid the pistol aside,
is troubling the local officials who have such prob
lems to deal with. It would be presumption to pro
ject an unprofessional opinion into the situation,
yet the humble intelligence of the layman has a
firm grasp of a conviction that though a suicide
might have conducted himself this way, he mighty
seldom does. A bullet in the ordinary brain has
a tendency to dull the activities.
Probably Lady Anne Coventry has been married
to Dhuleep Singh of Lahore, since all the dis
patches agree on this point. However, this is no
excuse for ringing in an old Patti photograph as
that of the bride, an error into which about nine out
of ten papers have fallen.
Senator Teller seems to be wise in opposing the
partition of China. The habit may grow upon the
powers so that inÂ«time they will take a notion to
divide us. They could not do it, but the effort
would lead to a straining of relations.
There is an easy explanation of the fact that an
Oregonian failed to die after shooting himself
twice, both bullets entering his head. The surprise
and novelty of having anything in his head merely
acted as a stimulant.
CORRUPT JOURNALISM.
MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
On the 10th of last November Wagner's
"Meistersingers" was produced in Paris
for the first time, with the most gorge
ous decorations. No expense was spared
to make the opera a success, and the
result fully realized the most extrava
gant expectations. The French nation
had set itself obstinately against Wag
ner and his works, and it has taken
thirty years to overcome this prejudice.
The recoil has been as violent as the at
tack, and now Wagner is the idol of the
hour in Paris. Nearly thirty years ago
the "Mfistersingers" was produced at
the Theater Royal, Munich, under the
patronage of Ludwig. King of Huvarla.
At that time very favorable criticisms
appeared in the Fronch papers, and M.
Victorin Jonciere. a painter and a musi
cian, sketched M. Betz in the role of
Hans Sachs during the performance. He
also drew the scenery of the second act,
and both appeared in an illustrated sup
plement of the Figaro of the sth of July,
M. Franz Betz as Hans Sachs, at the
Koyal Opera, Munich, 1868.
IS6S. After he had written "Tannhauser"
Wagner thought of writing an opera
that should be a comic counterpart to
this work. In his own words, "I sud
denly conceived the idea of a comic play
which might follow my minstrels' con
test in the Wartburg as a significant
satire play. This was the mastersingers
of Nuremberg, with Hans Sachs at their
head." On this occasion Wagner broke
with all his dramatic traditions. No
more did the sirens and the voluptuous
pagans of Venusberg appear; no knight
in white tunic and sparkling coat of mail
descended on his legendary swan from
the celestial heights of the Holy Grail,
as in "Lohengrin"; the love philters, the
aspirations and the enervating buddhism
of "Tristan and Iseult" equally disap
peared. The action passed in times and
places with which we are still familiarâ
In the imperial city of Nuremberg to
ward the middle of the sixteenth cen
tury. It is said that if the finale of the
third act of "Tristan"â the scene of the
transfiguration and the death of Iseultâ
did not exist, and the representation
could be reduced by half an hour, the
SCENE IN THE SECOND ACT OF THE MEISTERSINGERS.
opera of the "Meisterslngers" would be
"Wagner's chef d'oeuvre. The accom
panying drawings are exact reproduc
tions of the sketches made by M. Jon
ciere and published In the Figaro in 1868.
M. Franz Betz, the celebrated barytone,
who took the part of Hans Sachs, re
tired from the Imperial Theater, Vienna,
on the first of last September. The Em
peror of Austria has made him an hon
orary member of the opera, and he will
appear from time to time In his prin
cipal roles. Hans Sachs, Falstaff, Tell
and Kwewenal.
Soms more of Rubinstein's thoughts
and aphorisms: "The greatest good that
has been given to man is the llgrht of
the sun. Oh! tho beautiful rays of the
sun. I cannot understand how men who
live under the blue, Bun-lit sky can have
the name social and political discontent
as thoÃe who are obliged to live in the
fog or under a gray sky."
"It Is not the same thing to be shot
as to be hanged. The latter mode of
execution Is regarded as more dishonor
able. There are, then, two kinds of
deathsâ one for great lords, the other for
moujiks."
"Everything can be replaced except
life."
"I find It very strange that the law
permits people to marry even to the third
time, and not only after the death of one

M. Salnt-Saens has had a great success
In Madrid, where In fifteen days the
Concert Society gave under his direction
three performances entirely devoted to
his works. The flrat, which took place in
the hall of the Prince Alphonse Theater,
comprised "Phaeton," the prelude to the
"Deluge," the "Breton Rhapsody," the
Symphony in A minor, of which two
pieces were encored, the "Danse Mac
abre" and the airs of the "Stephen Mar
eel" ballet. After these concerts, which
were for him a perfect ovation, M. Saint-
Saens was named Commander of the Or
der of Isabelle the Catholic and a mem
ber of the Royal Academy of Madrid.
The next Saturday, under the direction
of the composer, the first performance of
"Samson and Delilah" was to take place,
with M. Dupeyron in the role of Samson.
Schopenhauer, who, like Nietzsche, was
a great musical amateur, speaking one
day of Wagner, expressed himself in
these terms: "Tell your friend Wagner
that I thank him for the copy of his
'Nibelungen,' but he ought to give up
music. His aptitude is for poetry. As
to me, I remain faithful to Rossini and
Mozart. He has sent me his trilogy,
but the boy is no musician." When Schop
enhauer spoke of Rossini he devoutly
raised his eyes to heaven, but yet one day
when Rossini was spending a few days
In Frankfort he refused to be Introduced
to him, saying that it was impossible that
the fat Frenchman could be Rossini.
Schopenhauer possessed a complete col
lection of Rossini's operas, arranged for
the flute, and played them every day,
from 12 till 1, but he never permitted any
one to listen.
It is rumored that the great maestro,
Verdi, is again a candidate for matri
mony. And why not? Years are not al
ways a guide to ege. Some men are old
at 40 and others are young at SO, and the
truly "grand old man" must possess won
derful vitality, for when people were look
ing for him to be overwhelmed with grief
he wisely buries the past and determines
to make the most of the future, in company
with another celebrated singer. Mme.
Stolz is expected to be the third Mme.
Verdi.
At Monte Carlo, on the occasion of the
second classical concert, a. new ovation
was accorded to M. Leon Jehin for the
remarkable execution of Cesar Franck's
Symphony in D minor, which was lis
tened to with profound attention. The
overture to "Tannhauser" and the very
curious suite of Greig upon Peer Gynt
and the "Hallujah Chorus," by the or
chestra and chorus, followed.
The Royal Opera, Budapest, has Just
given the premiere of Leoncavallo's
"Boheme" with great success. On the
eve of the performance a concert was
given, at which all the elite of society
assisted. Mme. la Countess Vasquez and
Mme. Bardossy sang, accompanied by the
maestro. A grand banquet followed the
concert.
At Riverside, Cal., the Arlington band

A new device has been applied to the
clarinet, the invention of M. Prepeschi,
an Italian. The peculiar advantage
claimed for it is that while it does not
require any change of fingering the key
arrangement is such that passages which

become as simple as the common chord.

A POLYGLOT MAGAZINE.
The announcement from St. Lou's of a
magazine published in twelve different
parts and twelve languages and dialects
)s most Interesting. It is the intention
of the publishers to make this publica
tion serve the interests of good American
citizenship. The proprietors are men of
business, who perceive that there is a
field for a popular magazine to reach im
migrants newly arrived in this country,
among the great numbers of German's
Swedes. Norwegians. Russians. Italians.
Hungarians, Louisiana French, Cali
fornia and New Mexico Spanish, etc,
who never learn to read the English
language. In the second generation many
foreigners read and speak our national
tongue with facility; on the other hand
there are thousands of Americans born
under the stars and stripes living in
communities where only the parental
tongue is used, and who never come into
any useful knowledge of the English
language. For these people, as well as
for the newly arrived, a separate maga
zine in their own languages, yet all tend
ing to explain American institutions
may become a vast power for good citi
zenship.âBoston Transcript.
SONG.
A spirit haunts thÂ« year's last hour*
Dwelling amid these yellowing: bowers:
To himself he talks;
For at eventide listening earnestly.
At his work you may hear him sob and sitrh
In the walk.-:
Earthward he boweth the heavy stalks
Of the molderlng flowers:
Heavily hangs the broad sunflower
Over Its grave P the earth so chilly:
Hepvlly hangs the hollyhock.
Heavily hangs the tiger-lily.
ThÂ« air is damp and huph'd. and close
As a sick man's room when he taketh repose
An hour before death;
My very heart faints and my whole soul
grieves
At the moist, rich smell of the rotting leave*
And the breath '
Of the fading edges of box beneath.
And the year's last rose,
Heavily hangs the broad sunflower
Over its grave i' the earth- so chilly
Heavily hangs the hollyhock.
Heavily hangs the tiger-lily.

PEARY'S METEORITE.
By the way. Lieutenant Peary's "me
teorite" is still on sale. Good iron ore is
worth in Egland some 11 shillings a ton;
metallic Iron sells at about 5 shillings a
ton. So, taking the latest statement as
to the weight of this "meteorite," it
may lie worth Â£250. Metallic Iron is not
a very valuable commodity in either
England or New York; so that it ap
pears a pity to have deprived the Green
landers of what, according to Peary, was
sent to them as an iron mine directly by
Providence from the heavens. That the
block is a meteorite is open to question.
The Greenland basalts contain a percent
age of metallic iron in what petrologists
call the "interestitial groundmass" of the
rock. This appears to owe its presence
there to the reducing action of beds of
carbonaceous material, with which the
molten basalt came into contact. There
have recently been described several in
stances of the segregation of the ferru
ginous constituents of molten rocks into
great masses. It is probable that Peary's
block of iron was formed in this way,
a.:d is of purely terrestrial origin. The
process seems still to be going on, for
the block was at first reported to weigh
some forty-five tons, and the American
experts who have seen it put the weight
at about that amount. But on Monday
evening, at the Geographical Society, it
had grown to ninety tons. â Saturday Re

REFLECTIONS OF A BACHELOR.
The reason why women are better than
nun is because they don't know It.
Style to a woman means whether you
have to wear clothes that are too big to
look well or only too small to feel com
fortable.
A mnrried man always boasts about
his having made one woman happy, bnt
an old bachelor is the only one that can
be sure of it.
Even when a girl has fixed a sprig of
mistletoe in her hair, so it will look like
it fell off the chandelier, she will pretend
to fight against it.
All women believe in their hearts that
woman is the superior of man, but very
few of them care to brag very much
about it till after they get married.
When a man gets tired of a girl he has
to stand it; when a girl gets tired of a
man she has only to ask him to carry a
few of her littlest bundles.â New York

MUST PAY LICENSE FEES.
. Deroand by Insurance Comrnis
:V- sioner Clunie on por-
eign Companies.
. Each of the thirty- four European
.: fire Insurance companies doing busi
ness in this State has been presented
'â 'â 'â â  with an official demand by Insurance
â â¢â¢â â â¢ Inspector Clunie for unpaid license
fees, which in a majority of the cases
.â â¢ run back twelve years and â Which ag
.;'.â  gregate $279,530 98.
These license fees were imposed by
a law enacted March 3, 18S3, requiring
foreign insurance companies operating
in this State to pay annually 1 per
cent on their premiums to the Treas
urer of every county or city and coun
ty In which the business was done, for
the benefit of the firemen's relief fund
of such county or city and county.
The law has not heretofore been en
forced, because of a decision of the Su
preme Court, obtained soon after its
enactment, holding that it Imposed a
municipal tax, which could be levied
only by a municipality.
Commissioner Clunie, however,
maintains tho State's right to impose
such a license as the one contemplat
ed, and that it is the duty of the In
surance Commissioner to deny to com
panies refusing to pay the fees permis
sion to do business. lie declares, more

IN HONOR OF
THREE BELLES
Elegant Ball at the Tevis
Residence Last
Evening.
Old Time Scones of Generous
Hospitality Pleasantly
Renewed.
The Affair Complimentary to Miss
Bianding and tho Misses
Salisbury.
Two dainty buds, Miss Susie Bland
ing and Miss Margaret Salisbury, and
one of the most charming belles of this
season. Miss Kate Thornton Salisbury,
were the especial guests of honor at the
ball given last evening by Mrs. Lloyd
Tevls, at her elegant home corner of
Jackson and Taylor streets.
It has been many years since the
, Tevis home, famous, in days gone by for
its generous hospitality, was the scene
! of so large and brilliant a gathering.
The few old friends of the family pres
ent, for the majority of guests were
the especial friends of the young guests
of honor, compared the entertainment,
with most delightful results, to the
i many affairs of a similar nature given
by the generous hostess nearly twenty
i years ago. The same elaborate hos
! pitality that prevailed then was re
! peated, and the only difference seemed
: to be that in place of the old familiar
â¢ faces in the vast ball room were the
I sons and daughters of those who had
assisted at those magnificent entertain
' ments.
The guests last evening numbered
200, and the entire lower floor of the
' house was placed at their disposal.
Each apartment boasted of Berne in
' dividual decorations. No set arrange
ment was adhered to, but the effect
jof choicest flowers, arranged with
that art which conceals all art, was
' beautiful and pleasing in the extreme.
In the corridor long-stemmed Ameri
can Beauties and violets filled the huge
! vases and bowls that were placed in
'. the many pretty niches. In the main
â  drawing-room there was a delightful
i arrangement of bridesmaid roses. The
dining hall was gay with cordons of
green and bunches of red berries, and
the reception-room was handsomely
decorated with carnations of every
shade, each blossom of which was a
prize hothouse flower.
All the rooms were covered with
snowy white canvas and the dancers
were made welcome everywhere.
At 10 o'clock the guests began to ar
rive and dancing was at once Inaug
urated. There was no receiving party.
Mrs. Tevls, surrounded by all the mem
bers of her family, had a kind word
for each and every one.
At midnight dancing was suspended
and a delicious supper enjoyed, which
again was followed by the dance which
continued until the wee nraa' hours.

of immature calvea concealed in a barn
at 214 Langton street, owned by
Kearnes, where the inspectors found
them a few minutes later.
Anticipating that Keurnea was still
to come the inspectors went back to
watch for him, and were rewarded an
hour later b,y seeing him drive up the
road, his wagon also heavily laden.
After stopping at the barn and leaving
m< >re calve 3he drove to the shop of
Goldmeyer at Second and Howard
streets and left the carcass of a cow.
By the time th** inspectors reached the
shop the carcass had been cut up, but
evidences were found that It was dis
eased.
Warrants will b*> sworn out for the
arrest of both K^arnes and Ooldmeyer,
the first on a charge of bringing con
traband meat into the city and the sec
ond of offering the same for sale. The
calves and beef were seized and sent
to the fertilizing works. As this is
the second offense of the two men the
inspectors expect to make them pay
heavily for their acts.

THE LION WILL
STILL SLEEP
Attorney Lemon Called
Off His Threats of
Law.
The Police Judges Breathe
Easier and Feel Much
Safer.
Question of Constitutionality Will
Not Bo Tested Just
Now.
"Do not rouse the sleeping Hon."
Perhaps this admonition from a mem
ber of the Supreme bench of the State
was given in order to put a stop to
useless litigation; but whatever may
have been the motive of the advice the
effect has been startling.
When Attorney A. D. Lemon threat
ened to test the constitutionality of
the Police Courts of the city and coun
ty of San Francisco it Is possible that
the threat was nothing more than the
natural ebullition of indignation aris
ing from defeat, but -while the Judges
of the Police Court 9 were not much
alarmed over Lemon's proposed action
they did not rest so easy under the
hidden meaning of the "sleeping Hon."
There Immediately began a legal
game of tag with each of the four
members of the Police Court, endeav
oring to fix upon some other member
the onus of being "it." They did not
realize the fact that the "sleeping
lion" might possibly have a length of
ears that would place him In another
family of animated nature.
Yesterday the four Police Judges
had out their "busy-day" cards, but
the business which occupied their
minds was not that which comes from
the misdemeanors pt their fellow-men.
They were interested in finding out
Just where they were "at."
When Mr. Lemon got unduly exer
cised over his case and breathed his
threat of turning loose the dogs of law,
or words to that effect, upon the ques
tion of constitutionality of the acts of
the sitting Police Judges, he raised
such a sense at Insecurity In the
breasts of four men who have sent
chills down the backs of various evil
doers that for a while the wheels of
Justice almost refused to turn.
It looked dark, indeed, in the early
morning hours for the Judges, but as
the day waned and the fog cleared
Lemon experienced a change of heart
and concluded that the sleeping lion
would not be roused. It might cause
too much trouble for the public, and
anarchy and chaos might reign If the
lion was not permitted to have his nap
out. Consequently the threat was call
eu off and the Judges now breathe
easier.
Judge Joachimsen felt sure that he
would not be disturbed in any event
as he held down the bench In division
No. 3 and the unconstitutionality could
only apply to division No. 4. But Judge
Low has a word to say about this. He
cannot see why he should be relegated
to the rear simply because he happened
to be put on the fourth bench by the
presiding Judge. He thinks that the
fact that he received the largest num
ber of votes at the election would In
dicate that he was a fixture.
The result of all this scare was that
each of the four incumbents ransacked
their desks and found their election
certificates and were ready to meet any
and all comers. But happily for the
public and the Judges Lemon will not
press his point and those who are on
the lookout for strange things will miss
the opportunity of finding out whether
the animal is really a lion or another
animal with a borrowed skin.

The T'nited States Board of General

Importers. The decision prow out of a
case in which a number of New York
Importers made a claim that bottles
marked by the sand blast process are not
etched but only labeled, and therefore
not dutiable as etched grlass. The matter
was taken before the New York Board
of Appraisers, who rendered the decision
that inasmuch as the process of sand
blasting differs from the process of etch
ing, engraving or cutting, and is only
done to designate the contents or in
tended owner, bottles marked in this
way cannot be classified as etched, cut
or otherwise ornamented glÃss.

RAISING MONEY
FOR THE JUBILEE
Funds in Sight Will Jus

Features.
The Hibernians Will Parade a

Accepted.
Money collected and sums promised
have given fresh courage to the mana
gers of the Golden, Jubilee celebration.
It Is now considered that the funds will
be sufficient to Justify the finance com
mittee in giving out word that several
of the fine features, held in suspense, so
to speak, may be embraced in the gen
eral programme.
The Ancient Order of Hibernians is
bent npon making a most creditable
showing in the parade. It has been de-

cided to form a Celtic division, irre
spective of membership to the order.
The local divisions of the order which
form the principal feature of the dis
play, wID enter representatives to the
number of at least 1200 men, under the
leadership of P. J. MoCormick, county
president, who has been chosen mar
shal of the Celtic division. J. P. Dig
nan and E. J. Hannon recently called
upon the Oakland divisions of the order.
The five divisions have unanimously
agreed to parade and will send over a
delegation of about 500 men. Already
it has been decided that 150 men will
come from San Jose; 100 from Vallejo;
and delegations are expected from San
ta Cruz and Salinas. A circular has
been issued inviting all the Hibernians
In the vicinity to be present with their
friends at a Joint meeting of the A. O.
H. on Sunday at 2:30 p. m., at 1320
Howard street.
The Fishermen's Benevolent Society
will march in the parade with 100 men.
The men will be uniformed in blue
shirts, black pantaloons and white
straw hats with waving ribbons. The
organization will enter a float consist-
Ing of a fishing boat with sails occupied
by fishermen in costume. The aids are
to be Victor Arlnai, George Maggio and
Paul Maggio.
The Santa Clara County Board of
Supervisors has notified Grand Mar
shal Morse that It has selected Paul P.
Austin of San Jose and Charles P.
Derby of Almaden to act as aids to him
in the parade.
Yerba Buena Parlor No. 84 of the N.
S. G. W., In reply to the solicitation of
Grand President G. D. Clark, has de
cided to participate in the parade.
A meeting of the jubilee parade com
mittee was held yesterday afternoon
with J. H. Grady in the chair. Lieu
tenant Roudiez of the United States
army was present. At his suggestion
it was decided to hold military ath
letics on some suitable park in the city
on Wednesday, the 26th of January,
and military maneuvers on Friday,
the 28th of January. Both events will
be preceded by a military concert. On
Tuesday afternoon In some park in the
city a football game will be played be
tween the United States Army team
and the members of the National
Guard. The management of these af
fairs and the arrangement of their pro
gTamme was placed under the direction
of Lieutenant Roudiez. On next Sun
day the Presidio will be examined in
order to see if it be necessary to erect
extra .Beats.
A. Becker and R. Lorentz, repre
senting the Verein Entralcht, were
present to consult in regard to a Tur
ners entertainment, which it is pro
posed to hold on some evening during
Jubilee week. These gentlemen fell
heartily in with the idea of the com
mittee, and will call together the other
Turner societies throughout the city,
and make a subsequent report upon the
matter to the parade committee.
The BrewerÃ' Association has de
clared its intention of entering a float
In the Jubilee parade. The float will
represent a German brewery, built of
Btone with its towers and turrets,
upon which will be flags.
The Butcher Board of Trade at a
meeting held Tuesday evening last
authorized the payment of $100 to the
Golden Jubilee celebration committee.
THE MINING FAIR.
Silken Banner Prize for the
Best County Display on
the Opening Night.
The board of managers of the Min
ing Fair held a meeting last evening at
the Mechanics Institute, E. A. Denicke
In the chair. Messages from many
mountain counties were considered.
Nevada, Tuolumne, El Dorado, Yuba,
&<ua Bernardino, Shasta, Placer and
Amador counties, each desire space for
an exhibit of mineral wealth. Nevada
county wants 2000 feet and announces
an appropriation of $2000. The super
visors of El Dorado County failed or
refused to appropriate money and the
Miners' Association and Native Sons
took the matter in hand and raised
funds necessary to make a creditable
display of the county's resources.
The board of managers last evening
resolved to give a silken banner to the
county making the best mining display
on the opening night of the exposition.
An eloquent address will be made to
the public concerning the fair. It will
be prepared by a committee consisting
of E. A. Denicke, Mayor Phelan. T. L.
Ford, J. A. Filcher and Robert Ken
drick.
Committee and Individual reports
submitted last night Indicated that all
the space In the pavilion had been re
served for exhibitors. Immediate at
tention will be paid to advertising the
event. _____________
FOR THREATS TO KILL.
J. P. freryna firrested on Comp
laint of J. F- Turner.
J. F. Turner, real estate agent, was
successful on Tuesday in getting a war
rant from Judge Conlan for the arrest
of J. P. Frenna on a charge of threats
to kill.
Frenna surrendered himself at police
headquarters, and, after the charge
was booked against him In the City
Prison, he was released on his own
recognizance by Judge Conlan.
Turner alleges that on December 17
Frenna met him In the City Hall cor
ridor and made the threat complained
of. Frenna on the other hand declares
that he has not spoken to Turner for
two years, since he commenced pro
ceedings against Turner, and denies
making any threats against him.
Turner, when Interviewed last night,
said that the arrest of Frenna on a
charge of having made threats against
his life, was only preliminary to a
series of other charges that will follow
shortly. "Frenna has made threats
against my life," said Turner, "and I
did not feel safe until I had him placed
under bonds to keep the peace. It is
my intention to have him and L. S.
Megginson arrested on charges of per
jury. I expect to prove that the testi
mony given by them before Judge Wal
lace, and on which I was convicted of
a charge of forgery, was untrue in all
its material points. I am the victim of
a conspiracy to rob me of valuable
property, and I will not rest contented
until I have those engaged in it behind
the penitentiary walls. It is true that
I have been convicted on the testimony
of the men I now intend prosecuting,
but the conviction will never stand.
Time will prove that I have been the
victim, and that, instead of being a
wrongdoer, I have been greatly
wronged."
AN INSTITUTION
TO BE ASHAMED OF
Dr. J. M. Williamson's Opinion
of the City and County
Hospital.
The Wooden Buildings Should Be
Replaced by Structures of
Modern Design.
Dr. J. M. Williamson of the Board of
Health has come out boldly and given
his views of the City and County Hos
pital, not as to its management, but
regarding that group of decaying
wooden buildings in which the indi
gent 111 and maimed are treated. Dr.
Williamson's views are uncompliment
ary In the extreme, but nevertheless
they are based on a lengthy personal
acquaintance.
As an introduction of a not brief con
demnation the physician refers to the
apathy of the average citizen of San
Francisco when the matter of making
needed public improvements is broach
ed. It is owing to this apathy In the
opinion of the doctor that the reform
has not been consumated long ago, but
he hopes that in time the people will
realize the importance of the needed
Improvement and the suffering of those
who are forced to apply at the hospital
for treatment and demand that the
disgrace be wiped away.
In turn the various departments of
the hospital are attacked by Dr. Wil
liamson, and those who are in a posi
tion to know say not unjustly. "It is
interesting to note," he said, "that the
fatalities in the cases of Miller and
Hawkins forcibly emphasize the in
excusable condition of the Pesthouse
and hospital. In the cases referred to
the press and pulpit combined in de
nunciation of the condition of the
buildings. Leaky floors, tottering walls
and unsanitary plumbing possibly
reeking with germs of death are part
ly responsible, and the decay of the
material of which the establishment Is
constructed preclude any attempt that
may be made to reconstruct them."
The laundry, kitchen and many
other departments are scored, and the
"ensemble of the whole" is condemned
as unfit for the housing of those un
fortunates, who, stricken by disease,
go there perhaps to recover their
strength or perhaps to die.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 6, 1898.
A LIVELY
BATTLE IS
PROMISED
The Freeholders Are
Unable to Agree on
a Chairman.
Political Lines Are Now
Being Drawn by the
Members.
Ex-Mayor Ellert and Joseph
Britton Are the Rival
Candidates.
PHELAN IS DISAPPOINTED.
He Is Advised That It Is Necessary to
Keep Ellert in the Back
ground.
The recently elected freeholders who
are to frame a new charter for the gov
ernment of the municipality are al
ready In the whirlpool of politics. They
were elected as non-partisans, and not
withstanding the promise made that
they would eschew politics, the politi
cal lines have been drawn already, and
this before they have received their
certincates of election.
There is every promise of a lively
battle when the charter framers meet
to organize. The first skirmish will be
over the selection of a chairman. There
are two candidates in the field. Joseph
Britton, who presided over two prev
ious conventions, that framed charters
that were voted down by the people,
is the choice of Mayor Phelan. The
other candidates is ex-Mayor L. R. El
lert, who ran away ahead of his ticket.
It is over these two candidates that
the battle will rage the hardest.
When Mayor Phelan suggested Brit
ton fur chairman, he believed that there
would not be any opposition. He was
so used to having matters go just
about as he wanted at the convention
of the Committee of One Hundred he
did not dream that any other aspirant
would appear in the field. But the
friends of ex-Mayor Ellert among the
Freeholders decided that he was the
logical candidate for chairman. The
fact that he ran over 1000 votes ahead
of any of the other candidates on the
ticket seemed to them to be a pretty
fair gauge of the will of the people in
the matter. In addition to this, his
four years' service as a member of the
Board of Supervisors and two years
in the Mayor's chair gave him a better
insight into municipal afralrs than any
other of the Freeholders. For these
reasons his friends decided to nominate
him for chairman and they are hope
ful of winning their fight.
But there is more than the mere mat
ter of chairmanship involved In the
coming fight. Underlying it all is a
desire for political gain.
Mayor Phelan is ambitious and de
sirous of political advancement. He
would gladly accept the Democratic
nomination for Governor, but as mat
ters now stand Congressman Maguire
appears to have the inside track. If
the gubernatorial plum falls to Ma
guire the Mayor will consent to again
head the local ticket. Therein lies the
secret of the fight that is now being
made to secure the chairmanship for
Britton.
The political advisers of Mayor Phe
lan work out the problem in a manner
that causes him considerable uneasi
ness. They argue that if Ellert is
chosen chairman of the convention and
a charter is framed that will meet with
the approval of the people, there will
be a boom in Ellert's political stock.
They fear that he might become an as
pirant for the highest place on the
State ticket, or enter the mayoralty
race. They recognize Ellert's strength
and so far as either nomination is con
cerned they consider it good Demo
cratic politics to keep him In the back
ground.
So it is that the fight for chairman
of the freeholders' convention will be a
lively one. The workers for both can
didates are pulling hard on the other
freeholders and trying to get them in
line to support their favorite. Several
of the freeholders have expressed their
choice for chairman but the majority of
them seem to think at present that it
Is the best policy to keep silent and
look wise.
J. Richard Freud, who wan secretary
of the charter convention, is the only
candidate thus far named for the sec
retary of the freeholders' convention.
It is generally conceded that the high
office of treasurer will go to Isador
Gutte without opposition.
Draynjen and Teamsters.
The Draymen and Teamsters' Union
held its semi-annual election on Tues
day evening at B'ne B'rith Hall. The
Hollowing officers were elected: Presi
dent, E. Maglnnls; vice-president.
Samuel Dennis: treasurer. John S.
French; recording secretary. I. B.
"Wlderost: financial secretary, George C.
Evers: sergeant-at-arms, C. J. Barrie;
trustees for long termâ C. D. Evers, Wil
liam Rawllngs and D. P. Brown.
A. general review was given by the
recording secretary of the society's
standing. Since its organization, No-
JVrJS * 10, 1876, it has paid out yearly
11000 for sick benefits on an average
and on death benefits about $15,000,
in twenty-one years, $1000 funeral ex-
Pâ¢ s es. and has still a bank account of
*euw. The standing of the Draymen and
Teamsters' Union to-day is Al. Its work
ings are simple, but some of its mem
bers are getting old and it is hoped that
the union will soon be increased by the
young teamsters of the city.
WORK FOR YOUNG MEN.
Enthusiastic Annual Meeting of
the Young Men's Cbristlan
Association.
The forty-fifth annual meeting of the
Young Men's Christian Association of
San Francisco was held Monday even
ing in the lecture hall of the Associa
tion building. Mason and Ellis streets.
C R. Bishop presided. Reports were
presented from nearly all departments
of the work, especially the educational,
German branch, employment depart
ment, physical culture and religious
work committee.
A financial statement from Samuel
Foster, treasurer, showed the total in
come from membership fees to have
been $11,342 90; rents from portions of
the building $11,L33 61. and that the
total receipts were about $800 in excess
of the expenditures for the year. For
the first time in the history of the work
the earnings from membership dues
and portions of building rented paid
running expenses, independent of do
nations. This, however, did not ap
ply to interest on the building indebt
edness, which has gone behind and
Beriously crippled the work of the in
stitution.
The forty-fifth public anniversary of
the San Franclsro association will be
observed on Sunday afternoon, Janu
ary 30, when the address will be de
livered by President Jordan of Stan
ford University. The following gentle
men were elected last evening as di
rectors of the association: Messrs. Ed
ward Coleman, J. J Valentine, A. B.
Forbes, Robert Bruce, R. V. Watt and

Officers on the board of directors
were also elected, as follows: John J.
Valentine, re-elected president; Messrs.
C. S. Wright and R. V. Watt, vice
presidents; Samuel Foster, treasurer;
B. C. Wright, auditor; C. A. Maydwell,
recording secretary; Judge K. D. Saw
yer, attorney for the association.
The following were appointed a
finance committee: Samuel Foster, C.

CLOSED IN A
BLAZE OF GLORY
The Last of the Beautiful and
Magnificent Columbia
Pageant.
Th* Benefit a Gratifying Financial
as Well as an Artistic
Success.
The beautiful historical pageant, "Co
lumbia," that has held the stage at the
California for the past thr^e nights,
closed last evening in a magnificent
blaze of glory, with an enviable record
of financial as well as artistic success.
Time did not seem to wither "or cus
tom stale" the infinite variety of the
Inspiring tableaux, and many who at
tended the opening performance went
again and again, and always found
more than enough to please and inter
est them.
From a thoroughly artistic standard
the pageant was the most creditable
performance ever held by amateurs in
this city. The usual petty differences
that habitually disturb all affairs of
this kind were, happily, wanting. There
were no murmurs of discontent; no pet
ty Jealousies. All the participants ban
ished all thoughts of self and worked
bravely and unselfishly for the suc
cess of the whole.
The public seemed loth to bid fare
well to those who labored so nobly and
successfully to please them, and de
manded that the curtain be raised time
and time again after each scene. Es
pecially was this the case with the
gorgeous minuet, and the charming
patroness. Miss May Hoffman, was
loaded down with floral offerings.
While no Just estimate of the re
ceipts has as yet been made, it is
known that the opening night yielded
over $1100, that on Tuesday night, the
attendance represented over $1000, and
that again last evening the house more
than equaled the attendance of Mon
day. Taking out the expenses, which
represent between $200 and $300 per
night, the result promises to be a most
gratifying one.
CONCERTS AND PLAYS.
The Lecture Recitals of Miss White
Coromerjce To-Night.
At the California Theater to-night
Miss Villa Whitney White, of whom
much has been written lately, will

said to be quite a musical scholar, and
her talks on the history and develop
ment of the folk-eong with vocal illus
trations interspersed have won for her
a unique fame. The second recital
takes place Friday night; the third on
Saturday afternoon.
Stuart Robson In "The Henrietta"
closes with the week at the Bald-win,
when comes Willie Collier with Dv
Souchet's "Man From Mexico" on
Monday night.

Henry in a new piece called "A Night
In New York."

Goose" will be submitted by the Tivoll
next week.
A three-week run of "The Girl I
Left Behind Me" at the Alcazar will
be accomplished by Sunday night.
Then "Esmeralda."
The Orpheum offers the usual big
variety entertainment.
Morosco has selected Oliver Byron's
"The Plunger" for next week's bill at
the Grand.
Verdict Against the Railroad.
A verdict of $5000 against the Market
street Railway Company was rendered

GORMAN TO BE
HACK INSPECTOR
Gets the Vacancy Caused
by Sergeant Martin's
Retirement.
Corporal Ayers Promoted to
the Office Vacated by Abe
Houghtaling.
Police Officer Bowlen Also Honored
toy the Board of Commis
sioners.
Police Officer Owen Gorman will suc
ceed Hack Inspector Martin, who was
retired on a pension at the recent
meeting of the Police Pension Com
missioners.
This was decided upon at a meeting
of the Police Commissioners last night.
Gorman is one of the best known men
in the Police Department. For a num
ber of years he was assistant hack in
spector, and made an excellent record.
He is held in high esteem by Chief
Lees and the members of the commis
sion.
Corporal John C. Ayers was pro
moted to be sergeant to take the place
of Abe Houghtaling, who was also re
tired. Ayers has been In the force for
thirty years and is held In high regard
by his superior officers. After his ap
pointment was known he was warmly
congratulated by his fellow officers.
He will do duty at the Central station.
Police Officer Tom Bowlen of the
California-street station was appointed
corporal, to fill the vacancy caused by
the promotion' of Sergeant Ayers. He
will remain at the California-street
station.
The other vacancy, caused by the
retirement of Sergeant Fitzgerald, was
not filled, the Commissioners deciding
to wait until the next meeting of the
board.
At the same time It is expected the
vacancy in the detective department,
caused by the promotion of Captain
Bohen, will be filled-
Patrolman Frank Smith, charged
with being under the influence of
liquor while on duty, was fined $50.
A similar fine was Imposed upon
Cassius Blackman lor Imbibing too
freely.
The charge of failing to do his duty
preferred against Patrolman William
Harrison was dismissed.
Officer John Lynch, charged with un
officer-like conduct, was fined $20.
The case of J. A. Crackbon, charged
with being absent from his beat, was
also dismissed.
GOOD WORK BY SHEA.
The Chinatown Squad Makes a
Raid on Two Large Gam
bling Dens.
The Chinatown police squad, under
the direction of Sergeant Shea, made
a couple of raids last evening which
will put a stop to much of the gambling
going on in that part of the city. While
the officers very seldom fail to make
at least half a dozen arrests every
evening, the capture of nearly a hun
dred offenders on Tuesday surpassed
anything they have done recently and
will bring in the neighborhood of $500
into the city treasury, as the Chinamen
never defend their cases, but always
plead guilty and pay the fine of $5
without a murmur.
The raids last night were made on
two of the clubs and the Mongolians
were caught red-handed in the game
of fantan. Officer Morton disguised as
a Chinaman entered the Oriental Pa
cific Club at 713 Jackson street, and
after he got in his disguise was dis
covered by some of the inmates, who
assaulted him, but he drove them off
with his pistol before they could injure
him. He blew for help and Officers
Tracey, Burke and Handley, who were
watching the exits, rushed to his as
sistance. At this house, which was for
merly owned by Little Pete, and is be
lieved to be run by his relatives at the
present time, $300 and a complete fan
tan outfit was captured, with over sixty
men.
The Buk Yah Hlng Chinese Mer
chants' Association at 802 Dupont, was
the other place raided. This club was
started quite recently and the prompt
capture of the proprietor and inmates
show that the police have their eyes
open. Officer Galloway in disguise
gained admission to the place and was
backed up by Sergeant Shea and Offi
cer Silver. The capture here was $53 30,
a tan outfit and twenty visitors.
The accommodations at the Califor
nia station were not sufficient for the
large number arrested, and after being
booked the prisoners were transferred
to the city prison.
THE CITY WINS.
Home of Inebriates Loses a Valu-
able Richmond District Lot.
By a decision of the Supreme Court
rendered yesterday the city gains pos
session of a valuable lot in the Rich
mond district near the Park that the
people of the Home for the Care of In
ebriates have been fighting in the
courts for during the past three years.
The land In question is a lot fronting
on Ninth avenue, between Clement
and Geary streets, and running
through to Tenth avenue. It is 150 by
240 feet. In 1870 it passed Into the
hands of the Home for Inebriates un
der an act of the Legislature providing
for the setting aside of land for the
use of public Institutions. In the lower
court the claim was set up that the
home was a public institution and for
public use, and that the lot was in
tended for the home. The claim was
also made that the title to the land
could not be assailed by virtue of the
Statute of Limitations.
The position of the Supreme Court
Is that the Home for Inebriates is not
a public Institution, but that it is a
private corporation and not a public
agency in any sense. Hence the land
was not intended for the home, nor
could the institution take any land set
aside for public uses. By this the
Judgment of Superior Judge Hebbard
was affirmed, and the city will take
possession of its own as soon as the
remittitur is sent down from the
tribunal.
Estate of William H Gagan.
Charles R. Gagan has applied for let
ters of administration upon the estate of
William H. Gagan, who died a short
time ago at his home in this city. The
estate of the decedent, who died intes
tate, consists of a stock of goods and fix
tures in a drugstore at California and
Larkin streets. Mary M. Gagan. widow
of the deceased, has also applied to the
court to appoint Charles R. Gagan gen
eral administrator of the estate left by
her husband.

WHILE HE COUNTS
THE FLYING HOURS
When Left Alone He Gives Way to Over
whelming Despair.
GUARDS EXPECT A COLLAPSE.
Another Disappointment From the Circuit Court,
Another Appeal to the Governor, but
Littie Hope in Either.
The baleful influence of an ever j
present gallows is telling on Durrant
and it is the belief of those who are
closest to him that he will not be able
to mount the steps of the scaffold un
assisted, should nothing occur to pre
vent, the execution to-morrow.
There are two sides to the prisoner's
character, and but one is shown to
those who call to see him; when alone
with his own thoughts, or with the
watchful guards who by their presence
remind him always of the approaching
end, the horror of his situation gets the
better of him, and the men of the death
watch have seen him writhe on the
floor in his anguish and they have
heard his cries of despair resound
through the cell.
It has been evident to every one who
has seen Durrant since he was placed
in the condemned cell that he was
breaking down, but beyond the mem
bers of the death watch no one knows
how greatly he has changed. They
his outward calmness is assumed
f"r the benefit of whoever is coming to
him; that when he hears the ap
proach of any one he pulls himself to
gether, strides up and down his cell
"."??Â£ a few niinutes and then meets his
visitor with something of his old time
â¢ bravado; and when he is left alone
Â£Vpain the horror returns, and he
throws himself on his mattress and
s.ab.s bitterly.

NO WOMEN ADMITTED.
In accordance with the resolution passed by the Board of Prison Direct
ors and confirming the statements heretofore given by me in person, that no
temale will bz present to witness the execution of W. H. T. Durrant, I now
.reiterate that declarationâ No woman will be admitted under any urcum

ing for the hour when a legal death
awaited him, and they say that unless
he is different from them all, Durrant
will never be able to climb the gallows'
* stairs; the strain has been too much
f for him and when the end finally comes
they believe he will collapse. A sensa
tion is looked for when the fatal hour
arrives to-morrow.
Yesterday another disappointment
was added to the already long list of
those gone before; the United States
Circuit Court denied his application for
a writ of habeas corpus, and what was
worse still, when his attorneys wished
to file papers on appeal, the court re
fused to allow them to be placed in
charge of the clerk. He has a repre
sentative in Washington, however, who
will present to the United States Su
preme Court an application for a writ
of error on the proceedings in regard to
the sentencing of November 10, but the
fower court passed upon the very point
th^y are trying to make before the
higher court, and the ruling was
. against the prisoner.
â -/.*.â  The Governor is the last hope and an
:â¢: .appeal was made to him yesterday
.â¢', afternoon by General Dickinson. Wil
.â â¢};.â¢;,: Hoeffler, W." W. Fonte and ex
â¢ -â â â 'vJudge Sanderson. The gentlemen ap
â "V.'jpeared before him, where he is lying

â ".-â *, -The Governor was not asked to com
\ >;raute the sentence; the plea was a
::".;nÂ£w one in the case, for the only re
â â ''^uest was one for time. General Di0k
.'..".,. -Jnson urged the trial of the Williams
â â 'â¢':' -case, for he said the two cases had
."';'â ' ..fc^Vn so closely connected by the pub
;V"'Jj* that people were trying to hang the
Â"-";'..p.ris='>rier for both crimes and on the
â ;â¢.' /gvidence of but one. "Suppose," said
-;â  :*tsh< general, "that Durrant should b-*

â ;' ' Mr. Foote. Judge Sanderson and Mr.
-V ffler also spoke, the burden of their
'â '-â  remarks being that they did not think
Durrant had had a fair and impartial
trial. Chief Justice Beatty of the Su
preme Court spoke to the Governor on
behalf of Durrant on Tuesday evening,
and the Governor has received numer
ous communications on the subject.
The petition was listened tc v ith at
tention, and when all the lawyers had
spoken the Governor said he would
-carefully consider all he had heard.
From the Governor's manner", General
â Dickinson says he has strong hopes
â¢- that the prayer will be granted.
;Â° Mr. Deuprey conducted the proceed
ings before the United States Court
â .yesterday- morning. At 11 o'clock
â¢ Â° Judge Morrow and Judge de Haven ap
'=: L*ared on the bench and Ju^"- Mor
â ;' row read his opinion denying: the arpli
\ cation for a writ of habeas corpus.
:â  The opinion recited the facts of the
case in detail and then dealt with the
contention of the prisoner's counsel
I that the defendant had an absolute
| right of appeal. This contention was
based on the action of the Federal
' Judges after 'the sentence of November
10, when they refused even to allow
the clerk to handle the papers. They
â  decided that an appeal was not an in
Â°l herent right when it was prosecuted for
.. the evident purpose of obstructing the
process of the law. The court consid
â¢. ered that the Judge had discretionary
powers to the extent of refusing an ap-
peal when such a state of facts was
. apparent.
\\ Ik plain the attorneys have not
much hope in the further process of the
court; their energies are all bent on the
Governor,, and the only ray of light
that glimmers in the darkening hori
Â«i\zon comes from him. General Dickin
son was much encouraged by the Gov
ernor's manner when listening to the
petition for a reprieve, and places great
*e^nce in the promise to carefully
consider the facts.
It will not be the first time the Gov
ernor will have considered the facts of
the Durrant case, and he is nearly as
familiar with them as the attorneys.
The purpose of any continuance at this
time. is to try the Williams case, and
that was made the burden of the
prayer for delay. Should the Williams
case come to trial and should Durrant
be acquitted of that charge of murder
the conviction on the Lamont charge
would be dealt a moral blow which
I might redound to the benefit of the
; prisoner to the extent of avoiding the
; gallows, even though the conviction
stood. The Williams case was always
I considered the weaker of the two, and
, one of the first legal fights in the case
â  was over the attempt of the prosecu
| tion to try the Lamont case before the
Williams case, because the Lamont
' case was the stronger.
It has already been settled that there
can be no legal connection between
i the two cases, and the Governor has
i already intimated by his attitude in
; former appeals where the same point
i was raised that he considered that the
Williams case was one of secondary
importance when the Lamont case was
being considered. It is generally be
: lieved that he will take the same stand
i he has taken before and will not in
terfere in the course of Justice. His
decision is expected some time to-day,
: and there is little doubt but that it will
' be the dying of Durrant's last hope.
â  â¦
HIS HOPE IS GONE.
The Condemned Man Prepar
ing for the End To-Morrow.
SAX QUENTIN PRISON, Cal.. Jan.
i s.â Dun-ant has lost all hope and all
to-day he was preparing himself for
the final moment. Rev. Rader and
Prison Chaplain Drahms called on the
condemned man early in the afternoon
and offered religious consolation. To
them Durrant earnestly asserted his
innocence of the crime he is doomed to
die for. After a brief prayer Durrant
asked them both to be with him on the
scaffold. To that they assented and
as they went away they promised to
call and be with him most of to-day.
When they left Rev. Father Lagan
went to the death chamber and bid the
murderer farewell. The reverend
father and the prisoner have become
close friends since Durrant came to
San Quentin and the leave taking was
not without tears.
Laier In the day the father of the
dooncd man called and <or n *?-â¢> r.d
time he v^as compelled to talk to his
son with the bars and tho heavy
screen separating them. The senior
Durrant told his son of the refusal of
tin? District Court to grant any fur
ther delay in the punishment for the
murders of Emmanuel Church and the
news took all hope from the condemne-l
man. The father told him that the
Governor might interfere, but the pris
oner said he had little to look for in
that direction, and when his father
.vent away he said he would be brave
to the last and die on the scaffold in
nocent of the crimes attributed to him.
loiter in the evening Durrant's guards
sent word from the death chamber that
the condemned man was fast losing ih^
composure that has characterise i him
since his arrest, and they predicted
that the murderer would break dov.n
completely before the supreme moment.
Two guards were stationed in the
death cell w ith him last night, and an
other watched him through the befcvy
bars In the room in which he is < on
flned, waiting to be led to his doath.
The prison physician has been caution
ed to be within call at all hours of the
day or night at a moment's warning, in
case the doomed man may attempt to
take his life to cheat the gallows.
No move of the murderer is unheed
ed, and the prison officials are taking
no chances to let the murderer escape
the death penalty. After the elder
Durrant came from the death chamln-r
he called on the Warden and requested
that after the body of his son was cut
down after the law had been satisfied
it be immediately placed In a coffin
without the black cap being removed
from its face and the casket closed.
He .said he requested it so that the
features of his dead son could not be
gazed upon by those who witnessed
the execution. He asked that the
body be given into his care as soon as
possible after the execution, and that
no inquest or post-mortem examina
tion be held. He also requested that
the Warden take the rope with which
his son was hanged and burn it, as he
or the mother of the condemned mur
derer did not want it to he cut up and
pieces of it distributed about the coun
try as mementoes of the event. The
Warden granted the requests and
promised that they would be fully car
ried out.
After the Warden had given his con
sent to the requests Mr. Durrant in
formed tiie Warden that he had de
cided not to witness the execution of
his son. He said he had taken that
resolve on the advice of Rev. Dr.
Rader, who he said would be at the
side of the condemned man on the
gallows. To-day the death machine
was placed in readiness, and the room
where the gallows stands was prepared
for those who will witness the execu
tion. Warden Hale all day was in con
stant communication with the Attor
ney-General, and if any stay of execu
tion is granted the Warden will only
recognize a communication from that
official.
No One May Enter.
In speaking of the Durrant case last
evening General Dickinson said: "No
one will have permission to Interview
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 6, 1898.
the condemned man before he is
hanged, as I have authority in the
matter and have given strict orders
that no one shall see him. If the un
fortunate man must die, I believe in
letting him Bpend his last hours in
peace, and will not submit to having
him pestered. If any one does permit
him to be seen it will not only be con
trary to my orders, but will also be a
violation of faith and the breaking of
a solemn promise."
Another Guilty Mao-
The crank has not finished his work
of attempting to divert suspicion from
Theodore Durrant. Yesterday morning
Coroner Hawkins received the follow
ing letter scrawled with lead pencil on
a soiled sheet of note paper:
Jan. 4, 1898.
Coroner Hawkins you will find the last
of me in the Park near the Museum i
was born in Mayfield. Theodore Durant
is innocent 1 am the man who did it
remorse has seized me. You will find
my credentials in my pockets locate
Donald Robs.
tfo autopsy to he held. BYRON K.
The Coroner only laughed at the note,
but telephoned out to the park police
station and advised them to look for
a suicide, but has nothing from that
quarter. The letter is evidently the
work of some insane person who has
let the Durrant case work on his
nerves.
Can Do Nothing.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Jan. s.â ln
discussing the report that one of Dur
rant's attorneys would arrive here to
make a last appeal in the case, an of
ficer of the Supreme Court said that
he could not Imagine upon what
grounds an appeal co-uld be made, and
he did not believe that any appeal or
any sort of motion would be enter
tained by the Court. He said that any
further action would have to be in the
Circuit Court, for the United States
Supreme Court had already decided
that it could do nothing.
Sends for His Mother.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON. Jan. 5.â
Late to-night Durrant sent a note from
the death cell to Warden Hale asking
him to send word to his mother in the
city asking her to come and see him
early in the morning.
THE STORY OF THE CRIME.
Rev. Frank Cressey, ex-Pastor
of Emmanuel Church, Tells
of the Great Case.
BOSTON, Jan. s.â The following arti
cle was written to-day by the Rev.
Frank Cressey, now pastor of the Bap
tist Church in Weymouth. Mass, He
was pastor of the Emmanuel Baptist
Church in San Francisco, where the
Blanche Lamont murder was com
mitted, up to within a few months of
the terrible double crime. He knows
all the parties concerned from having
been their pastor, and his narration of
the crime, as told from personal knowl
edge, is such as has never before been
given. Here are the words in which he
describes it:
Four times Theodore Durrani has stood
before a Sun Francisco Judge and heard
pronounced on himself the sentence of
death by hanging:. The last date set for
execution is January 7, IW, and the
present probabilities are that he will then
surely die. From a legal point of view
the case has become one of the most in
teresting, not to say notorious, in the
history of American criminal Jurispru
dence.
It may be said that the moral character
of each of these three persons was en
tirely above reproach, and each was
among the foremost of religious workers
in the Young People's Society of Chris
tian Endeavor connected with the Em
manuel Church.
Durrant's father has long been a fore
man in a. large shoe factory, a man of
quiet and exemplary life. Durrunt's
mother, scarcely sixteen years older than
her aon, la â  woman of refinement, and,
like the mother of Gracchi, delights in
her children as her Jewels. ,
The elder L-urrant. together with f hts
parents, was a member of the Metropoli
tan Temple Baptist Church, San Frar.
clsco at the time uf its collapse, a
dozen years ago, and in its mem
bership he was baptized a few
rears previously by Rev. Isaac S.
Kalloch. or.cc pastor of Tremont Temple,
Boston, whom Editor de Young of the
San Francisco Chronicle once tried to as-
Mtfflnwtn Editor de Young was after
ward shot dead in his business office by
a son of Dr. Kalloch, which son was
once pastor of the present Emmanu.-l
Church.
Theodore Durrant became a member of
the Emmanuel Church live years ago. He
was received by myself, us pastor. I
had at that time the utmost confidence
in Durrant"s Christian character. I had
always found him an unusual helper in
church work and even now can hardly
bring myself to believe in Durrant's
guilt.
At the time of the murders Durrant
was studying medicine as a student at
one of the medical colleges of the city.
Miss Lamont's home was in Montana,
but on account of poor health she was
spending the winter with â¢her aunt and
uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Noble of San Fran
cis* â¢>, members of the Emmanuel
Church. She was at the time of hor
death attending the Girls' High School,
iji.'iut four miles from ht-r aunt's home
and the church. Theodore Durrant was
a more or less frequent caller on Miss
Lamont at her temporary homr, where
h*- was always welcome for his worth's
sake. Th<- calls and companionship, were
si) frequent that some people began to
whisper of a possible engagement.
Miss Williams was a young woman of
large and recognized worth, though ex
ceedingly unfortunate in her life. By
her own observation she became con
vinced six or seven years ago of her
father's alleged infidelity to her mother,
and a separation of the parents was the
result. After some months of painful
struggle by Mrs. Williams, the Em
manuel Church sent her and her three
i young children to her parents' home in
Canada. Minnie remained in San Fran
cisco to earn her own passage money
I ard.
Miss Williams was of short and deli
cate physical frame and was very quiet
| and retiring. She wan baptized by me
! at nearly the same time that 1 received
| Theodore Durrant into the church and
soon after I had received Mr. and Mrs.
Noble, relatives of Miss Lamont.
Now as to the murders. On Wednes
day afternoon, April 3, nearly three
yean ago, 15!anch<* Lamont did not re
turn from school at the accustomed hour.
Nor did she come that evening; she never
came.
Nine days after Miss Latnont's disap
pearance, on a Friday evening:, Theodore
Uurrant and Miss Williams were bothex
pected at the private residence of one of
the Emmanuel members to attend a
meeting of the Christian Endeavor So
ciety. Miss Williams did not come. Dur
rant came, but he came late, at perhaps
I 9:lio (/clock. When Durrant camp it was
v.ith disheveled hair and general disar
rangement of apparel. To the host of the
; evening, a chum-like friend, he explained
; his condition )>y saying that as a mem
ber of the State militia he had to go to
Mount Diablo, thirty miles away, early
i the next morning on a heliographio ex
pedition. When asked: "Where's Mln-
I nic?" he unconcernedly answered that he
didn't know.
At midnight Durrant was met by one
of tin- younjj men of the evening's com
pany near the Emmanuel Church. The
i next morning, Saturday before Easter
(Jay, I'urrant went away, as intended.
Thr same morning young womtn went to
I Emmanuel Church to adorn it for Easter
, festivities. One of them wished to see
the new library, one which Durrant had
' been arranging.
The library closet door was opened
Horror of horrors! There lay Minnie
Williams murdered!
The already deeply stirred city because
of Miss Lamont's disappearance was now
at fever heat. Who was Miss Williams'
murder<T? For some reason suspicion
pointed Immediately in one direction.
Durrant was arrested.
What is the theory as to Miss Williams'
murder? This:
She left her home on the Friday even-
I ing Jn question ostensibly to attend the
Christian Endeavor meeting, but really to
meet Durrant at the side entrance to the
church, and where, it Is said, they were
seen to meet under the street gas light
Thence they went into the great dark
church together. There he killed her by
The fac-simile S"d? s/0/r sr_ ** *â¢ on evei 7 wrapper

choking and throat cramming. Then he !
went to the Endeavor meeting, spent the
evening cheerily, went home with one of !
the young women and then, fearing that
his deed was not thoroughly done, he |
returned to the church at midnight. He i
entered its sepulchral gloom, groped his I
way first into the kitchen of the church,
broke open the closet, took one of the
case knives kept for use at socials,
groped his way tc where he had left the
body two hours before, dragged it Into
the library room and there out the wrists j
and stabbed the heart, and then with his j
hands threw the blood on the walls.
Why was Miss Williams murdered?
The generally accepted theory is because
she was supposed to know too much
about the disappearance of her friend.
Miss Lamont. "Dead men tell no tales."
Easter morning came and the detectives
resumed their search in Emmanuel !
Church. They burst open the gallery
steeple door, "they mounted stair after .
stair, and on the topmost floor, fully i
seventy-five feet from the street, they
found what was once Blanche Lamont.
The mystery of many days was solved.
On what evidence was Theodore Dur
rant convicted of the murder of Ulanche
Lamont? Various persons testified that
they saw him waiting in front of the
Girls' High School on the afternoon of
her disappearance: that they saw him
Join her as she came out; that the two
rude together on the street cars to the
Emmanuel Church; that they got off to
gether, entered the church about 4
o'clock; that she was never seen alive
afterward, and that about 5 or 5:30
o'clock lhat afternoon Durrant came
down from the upper part of the church,
evidently very tired and complaining of
being faint. To a church friend whom
Durrant found playing on the piano
when he came down he explained that his
faintness wma due to some exhausting
work he had iv.st been doing with the
i electric wires in the church, but at the
; trial It was testified that the wires had
â¢ been untouched for weeks.
Durrant's conviction was in the lfiain
if not entirely on circumstantial evidence.
; As to possible or probable motive it had
j been strongly contended that as a mcdi
: cal student h<Â» was of morbidly sensual
: nature, and that he killed Miss Lamont
1 that he might feast his eyes on her nude
! body; possibly, that he might have a
fresh subject for dissecting purposes. On
the other hand. Durrant's friends point
to his former character and manner of
life us proof positive that he was a mnn
incapable of such motives and conduct.
The relations between Durrant and his
pastor, the Rev. J- George Gibson, have
I from the first of the murders been pecul
iarly unfortunate. The pastor has sel
i doni or never railed on his sad and
| accused parishioner. This partly, perhaps,
because of a rumor somewhat current at
the time that Pastor Gibson knew more
about Miss Lament's death than he cared
to tell. Indeed, in a letter, the Rev. Mr.
Gibson, referring to Mr. Deuprer. Dur
rant's lawyer. Mdd: "What <lo I know?
Mr. Deuprey has not the genius to find
out. Had he ma.!.- a friend of me instead
of an enemy. h<- would have, succeeded
better. If he had only taken me into his
confidence, as he did the other witnesses
of thÂ»- Mission, how different his case
j would hare been." Yet further, Mr. Gib-
I son's asp^rti<n? as first quoted are held
to furnish not B little reason why the
! Governor should commute the death sen
tence to imprisonment for life.
Durrant a month ago wrote a letter to
his pastor on tho basis of the above as
sertion, but so fur as is known Mr. Gib
i son has made no reply to the letter.
< though it was printed in lull in the daily
papers. - v i ;: '
The police have warned the Rev. Mr.
Gibson that he is in danger of assassina
tion. The theory is that some of Dur
rant's friends may kill him and then give
out that he committed suicide through
remorse at having himself murdered
Miss Lamont. The warning has been ac
cepted by the church. One of Its mem
bers armed is with the pastor by night
and by day. and detectives attend all
services of the church.
I have written Durrant, expressing no
opinion as to his guilt or innocence, but
begging him. if guilty, to confess it and
not go before his Maker with a lie on his
lips as well as the blood of murder on
his hands. J- .' â¢â .
Durrant has replied by autograph
letter asserting his Innocence. I have
again written the condemned man, and
expect a final declaration on the scaffold
if the worst should come.

SWINDLED MIS FRIEND.
Charles Blackburn Wanted for
Burglary on Coroplaint of
William W. Miller.
William W. Miller, editor of the
World, swore to a complaint in Judge
Low's court yesterday for the arrest
of Charles Blackburn on the charge of
burglary.
Miller has Just served a sentence for
criminal libel while running a paper
in San Jose. While In jail he alleges
that Blackburn went to his mother
and represented that he had been
commissioned by Miller to get from
her $250, to be paid to Attorney More
house. Blackburn pot the money and
went to San Jose, but instead of giving
Morehouse the $250 he only gave him
$150.
On November 23 Blackburn again
called upon Mrs. Miller and told her
that Attorney Morehouse -was to apply
for a writ of habeas corpus and $23
was needed. He got the money, which
he appropriated to his own use and
purposes. He did more. Before leav
ing the house he went into Miller"s
bedroom and stole his gold studÃ and
other articles of Jewelry.
Mrs. Miller will also Bwear to a com
plaint to-day for the arrest of Black
burn on a charge of embezzlement In
getting away with the $100 and $25.

SUICIDE THE
COMMON THEORY
John H. Dow Was Very
Despondent Friday
Night
"Babe" Wilson Proved by a
Presidio Soldier to Be
in China.
A Williams Woman Now in the
Case â Evidence of the Keys
Favors Self-Murder.
Whether John H. Dow, the proprle
i tor of the shooting gallery at 815
Kearny street met his death at the
hand of an assassin or killed himself
may never definitely be settled, but
one thing is certain, as each day goes
by the evidence seems more and more
to shift toward the suicide end of the
balance. The absence of a motive for
murder, the presence of several for
; suicide, the manner in which those
who fell under suspicion have man
aged to acquit themselves of any con
nection with the affair, the condition
of the room and body at the time the
man was found dead, and other small-
er circumstances, all tend to convince
the impartial investigator that the
man had tired of life and made way
with himself.
In the first place there was only one
entrance to the gallery, and this door
had a double lock, different keys being
used from the outside and inside.
When the body was f und the door
was locked from the inside, one set of
keys being In Dow's pockets and the
other on a shelf. No way can be found
to explain how the murderer, if such
there be, could have locked the door
on the inside and made his way out
except through the transom, and in
this case the circumstnces are such as
to make any transom theory out of the
question. The pistol lay in Just such
a position as it would have been if
dropped from the man's hand after
the commission of the deed, and the
hand was stretched out over it. The
fact that the man had carried the pis
tol himself, as is testified to by the
Dazel woman, is also a strong point.
Then it is known that Dow's finances
were In a bad condition and that he>
was sick and despondent. Only the
evening before the death occurred he
went into Peterson's Cafe at 623 Kear
ny street and ordered eggs, soft boiled,
from the waiter, Frank Martinson.
When they were done he was unable to
eat them, and in response to a query
of the waiter, with whom he was well
acquainted, as to what was the mat
ter, he said he was ill. He seemed to
be not only unwell, but in a very de
spondent state of mind.
Frank S. Hayes, to whom the anony
mous letter referred as the "short,
stout, red-headed man." has shown
that he had nothing to do with Dow's
death. Hayes is employed by the Mon
arch Business Exchange, 1346 Market
street, and has demonstrated that he
only saw Dow three times, once going
to see him about two months ago to
inquire for another person if the place
were for sale.
It is now proved by the testimony
of a soldier at the Presidio named Ran
. kin thut the woman, "Babe Wilson,"
who has figured somewhat as a sus
] pect, has been in China since last July.
> Bohen sent for Kankin last night, and
! he said he had known the woman inti
j mately for a long time and produced
| two letters which he had received, one
, of them being received from Shanghai
about two weeks ago.
The only theory so far advanced In
favor of suicide is that the man could
not have shot himself a second time.
But a man has been known to have
lived with two thirty-eight-calibre bul
lets In his brain. These were only of
twenty-two-calibre, and it may have
been that the third one was the only
bullet that produced instant uncon
sciousness. At least the police incline
to that theory.
Mrs. Daz>l again visited Captain
Bohen's office yesterday afternoon and
made an additional statement. She
claimed that a woman, who is known
as Mrs. Williams, was in the habit of
visiting Dow. She saw her Christmas
night in Dow's shooting gallery. After
she had left Dow called Mrs. Dazel and
told her that in the future not to recog
nize the woman.
"She always wants money," he re
marked. "I am getting tired of her
constant demands."
Mrs. Dazel describes Mrs. Williams
as being about 40 years of age and
rather tall. She does not know where
she lives.
Arter hearing her statement Captain
Bohen at once detailed Detective
Crockett to find Mrs. Williams. He be
lieves that she may be able to throw
some light on the death of Dow.
Engine-Driver Injured.
While engine 5 was coming down the
steep hill on Pacific street, between
Taylor nnd Mason, yesterday afternoon,
thf-- brake on the rear wheels slipped,
nnd to check the speed the driver.
Charles OutuuTt, made a half turn, in
tending to zigzag down the hill. The rear
Wheels, however, struck the curbstone
and upset the engine. Cosgrove. who
WSfl â trapped to the seat, was badly
shaken Op, and it is feared that he has
sustained internal injuries. The engine
w.-is badly battered, but no serious
breaks occurred.

good sense to resign from the office he

from Mr. Carman at the Alaska Trade

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Jan. s.â The stock market gal
away from the bears in the later dealings'to
day and closed buoyant and very active,; In
part because of the rush of the shorts to cover.
Boom of the specialties were strong throughout
the day, but there was a period In the early
session when- the reactionists 'gained . control,
some of the Southern and Southeastern stocks
being Â»old down over a point. The bears also
attempted to utilize the Introduction at Albany
of bills directed against combines of capital,
but the effect of these bills was confined to
Consolidated Gas, which fell over a point.
Some heaviness early was manifested also ' In
other prominent railroad stocks, | which may
have been due to sympathy with the depres
sion In the same stocks in London and on
European exchanges. This was notably the
case with the New York Central stocks and
Northern Pacific preferred. The forced cover-
Ing a shorts and the later buoyancy of the
market brought the extreme advances In some
of the most prominent stocks to nearly 2 points
or over, and net gains- of a point or over are
very frequent throughout the list. The failure
of the bears to effect declines encouraged ag
gressiveness In the bulls. There was a grow
ing feeling also that recent utterances by rail
way officials pointing to poor returns on ac
count of low rates and rate-cutting were not
fully warranted and were designed to influ
ence public opinion and the action of Con
gress. The day's reports of railroad earnings
came to re-enforce this view.
Officially the Union Pacific reorganization
committee presented Its check to the Assistant
United States Treasurer for $8,500,000. which

The consummation of this deal, which has
been a disturbing factor in the money market
for a month, and the absence of flurry on ac
count of it In the money market to-day were
viewed with relief by Wall street. The future
ease of â¢ the money mark* now seems assured
so far as Government operations are concerned
This encouraging combination of circum
stances served to put an end to the bear cam
paign to-day and turned the tide In favor of
the bulls, ' though ; the day's business was still
largely confined to the professional trading ele
ment.
The bond market took on an Increased ac

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Jan. s.â Wheat start~l easy at
about VÂ»c under the closing figures at the day
b*>fr>re. May opened at from 91c to 91VÂ»<" an.l
July from S2&C to S*c. â¢ It acted Irregularly
within a narrow compass for an hour. May
playing, during that time between 91*Â»c and
91c The slightly' easier feeling with which
trading commenced "was' partly due to a crop
report . of I Thoraan that made the acreage
planted with winter Wheat 11.4 per cent larger
than! the area harvested -last season; also re
ported the condition now 87 against 84.1 De
cember 1 last, and estimated the quantity In
farmers" hands at 240,000.000 bushels, or 41.31
per cent of last year's crop, and that there Is
available for export In the' next six months
100.000,000 bushels. It was also a matter of
some disappointment to the bulls that the
Minneapolis and Duluth receipts were not re
duced more materially than as shown by 35t>
carloads at the two places to-day, as against
441 a week ago and 120 carloads the corre
sponding day of last year. < Chicago made some
amends, however, only. 26 cars being returned,
as against estimates made the day before for
75 and compared with ISS the similar day of
last week and 37 a year ago. Liverpool was
about Vid lower to begin with and dropped
another Hd later In the day.
The first thing the bulls got any additional
comfort. from was the sale by Armour & Co.
of 40,000 bushels of No. - spring heat for ex
port at once by rail hence to the seaboard,
and a rumored sale of a further 32.000 bushels.
The price was said to be 4^ic below the May
price. New York confirmed the taking for ex
port yesterday of S4 boatloads â bushels
âthere and 176.000 bushels at outports. The
export clearances from Atlantic ports were
again liberal, amounting in Wheat and Flour
to 600,000 bushels. That was a sustaining fac
tor, but when about two hours of the session
had gone, and the foreign markets were found
to have closed weak, confidence began to de
bert the early buyers and they became more
anxious to avoid a loss during the following
half hour than they had been before to secure
a prcflt. Liverpool closed %d lower for the
day, Paris at a decline of from 10 centimes to
15 centimes In Flour and 10 centimes In Wheat
while Antwerp. In addition to a drop of 12W
centimes for red American the day before re
ported a further decline of a like extent for
both red winter and white Californian. These
features of the midday news caused a break
to 90V*c shortly after their receipt. Letter's
agents were quite active sellers on the de
cline and the bull crowd was apparently play-
Ing for a break. Nevertheless It had the ef
fect of keeping the smaller fry out, and after
these who had bought in the morning had
liquidated at a loss there was little trade of
consequence besides the Letter transactions
the local crowd evidently being. afraid of tie'
Ing caught. A short time before the close May
reacted to 90% c. which proved ' the final tie.

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON. Jan. 6.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow of the
Wool market:
Most persons In the Wool market have the
Impression that this has been a quiet week,
whereas the sales In Boston have amounted to
7,fi50.000 pounds. 254,000 pounds more than the
previous week.
This is an extraordinary showing for the
first week of the year. Below we tabulate the
showing for the past week, as compared with
thÂ« corresponding period â¢ for a number of
years:
Year. Pounds. ' Tear. Pounds.
1894 1,801,500 ISIW 7.6.V1 000
ISO 3 3.009.000 1897 3.800.000
1532 1.557.000 1896 3.000.800
UN 2,427,000 1895 756,000
We see from this that the sales last week
were about 147 per cent larger than In any
corresponding period In the last seven years.
It is Judged that, owing to the shortage In
the Australian clip and the defective character
of the Wool, good staple Wool will not be
easily obtained during coming months. Con
sequently the large mills have been continued
heavy purchasers of domestic staple. Nominal
quotations have not been advanced, but it Is
now much easier to obtain the prices which
dealers have been holding for ever since the
"boom" culminated In October. Consignees
have placed new restrictions on Eastern hold
ers of Wool. Staple Territory cannot be bought
under E2c clean, and some ask 68c. Fine and
fine medium Wools are worth fully 60c -and
medium is quoted at 45c.
In foreign Wools, Australian cross-breds have
been a feature, some half-blood selling at 34c
In the grease. *
NEW YORK WOOL SALES.
NEW YORK. Jan. ThÂ» fifth auction of
wool was held to-day at the Wool auction.
Representatives of the Wool trade from all
parts of the country were present. The cata
â  logues consisted of over 1.300,000 pounds of
Wool on a greased basis, and which realized
over $250,000. About SO per cent of the Wools
were domestic. Boston. Providence. Hartford
and Philadelphia were well represented by
buyers. '

questions asked are such as would have
to he submitted to an attorney In pood
standing: for his opinion, but this depart
ment finds "that a patent vests the
patentee with the common right of
ownership from the center of the earth
upward to the sky. and the additional
right to follow â  vein or lode upon Its
dip within his side lines under the sur
face of adjoining territory (United States
Revised Statutes, section 2322; Iron Co.
vs. Klpin Co.. US U. S.. 21S); provided
he has the apex or lode within his claim
and subject to the same right in behalf
of others similarly situated. In other
words, the patentee nas no greater
rights, privileges or immunities than had
a locator on the question of extra
lateral rights. In either event he may
Invade other territory or have his own
territory invaded when the circumstances
warrant, whether both are held by loca
tion or patent, or one is patented and
the other is held by location, and the
relative dates of patents or notices of lo
cation are immaterial (Colorado Central
vs. Turck, 50 Federal Reports, 888). But
the vein cannot be followed into the
lands of an adjoining proprietor who
holds an elder title under a patent for
agricultural lands (Amador vs. Spring
Hill. 38. F. R.. 668). Nor where the claim
is in the form of an isosceles triangle
can the lode or vein be followed through
the side lines (Montana vs. Clark. 42 F
R., 62Ci." This is from "A Dissertation
Upon American Mining Law," by A. H
Ricketts.

Seventh Ward Hysteria
Among the Army of
Politicians.
Leckie, Dodge, Jordan, Bradley,
Melvin and Others Are
Interested.
The ?n!nry Ones Said to Bo So
Niggardly Now Looks
Large.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Jan. 5.
Politics has broken out in the i
Seventh Ward. It is always a promin
ent factor in the daily life of that end
> t" town, but now it is in a state of '
eruption. At the present time there
are almost enough acknowledged Re
j Ã¼blican candidates to make a com
plete county and a partial State ticket.
Ex-Assessor Robert Leckie would like
to fill the place he once occupied, but
he will have a hard fight on his hands, i
because Harry Dalton, the present As
sessor, has already outlined his plans
to succeed himself. For the office of
District Attorney there are no less than
three candidates from this ward. Harry
Melvin. at present a deputy in the of
r.-Aoe, ex-Assemblym*n C. G. Podge and
City Attorney Dow have aspirations to â 
succeed Mr. Snook, and it is not yet
certain that Mr. Snook is anxious to
. vacate the place. He has had two
terms already and the third term hoo
doo has been pretty well aroused in ]
This county during the past six years,
;ind If he sees this objection raised he
â win probably bend all his energies to
ward entering the State Senate.
. Dr. Bradley, ex-City Health Officer, j
would like another taste of political life |
; and has aspirations t<-> preside over the
: . morgue. Coroner Baldwin, however, |
./will not yield his position without an
. effort to save it, and so the belligerent
â¢ aspect of politics is knocked down even
In this grewsome section of the city
government. Dr. H. B. Mehrmann of
the other end of town will also keenly
contest the Seventh Ward's aspirant in
this connection.
Prank Jordan, also nf the Seventh
"Ward, realizing that a great many im
portant duties will fall to the County-
Clerk during: the next two years" es
pecially in the carrying out of the de
tails of the Stratton primary law. has
magnanimously given up his great de-
Fire to study law and enter his
â ' brother's firm in the interest of the
voters of this county. Mr. Jordan does
not want to vacate his office and havo
The great responsibilities thrust on in
'â¢' experienced shoulders. So far no other
Seventh Warder has appeared against
Mr. Jordan, although the woods
around East Oakland are full of other
candidates.
James Carey, the Courthouse gar
dener, has. while mowing the lawns
and training the young trees, imbibed
political ambitions and thijiks he
would make a good representative in
thf Ptate Assembly next year. George
Chase, at one time County Treasurer
and for half a generation an assistant
In the office, has not yet expressed his
preference for a position, but it is
hardly likely that so many good things
. -will he allowed to pass without George
making at least an effort to catch one
of them. Justice Lawrence is said to
be doubtful as to whether he would
like to succeed himself or represent his
d'Ftnot in the halls at Sacramento.
Henry turn Suden has no doubt that he
wouid like to succeed Mr. Lawrence a*

Choosing New Policemen.
OAKLAND, Jan. s.â The Board of
Police and Fire Commissioners held an
executive session this afternoon last
ing two and a half hours. The selec
tion of ten men for policemen from a
liirt of eighty applicants was the work
under discussion. The mode of pre
<~<flure was to strike from the list
those whom they did not want until
nly ten were left. This proved to be
>w process, and the board ad
journed at 5:30 p. m. with a large
number still on the list. City Attor
ney Dow, the president of the board,
.will be in the Circuit Court in San
Francisco to-morrow forenoon, so an
other meeting cannot be held until the
afternoon. At that time it is believed
by membf-rs of the board that the ten
men may be selected.

SCORES WERE DEFICIENT.
Many University Students Will Be
Dropped on Account of
Deficiencies.
BERKELEY, Jan. s.â Between twen
ty and twenty-five Berkeley students,
mostly freshmen and sophomores, will
be "advised to withdraw" from the uni
versity on account of deficient work
during the past term. Besides those
who will be dropped from the univer
sity roll, from forty to fifty students
will be placed on probation, and their
work between now and next May will
determine whether or not they will be
allowed to remain at the university.
About 400 deficiency reports have
been sent out since the Christmas ex
aminations by Recorder Sutton. Half
of this number, however, were for
cases where examinations had been
postponed by the instructors and the
reports deferred, so the number of act
ual deficiencies will Bcarcely exceed
200. These figures represent only the
results in the term courses, the marks
in the year courses not being given un
til the close of the college year in
May.
In spite of the large number of de
ficiencies this term, notices having been
sent to one-quarter of the students at
Berkeley, Recorder Sutton states that
the number of conditions is not pro
portionately greater than it has been
on previous occasions. The same, he
declares, is true of the score or more
of students who will be forced to with
i draw from the university.

BERKELEY. Jan. 5. â Recorder
James Button has sent to the univer
sity printer the last proof sheets of the
new catalogue of officers and students
at the University of California. The
catalogue shows a total of 2281 stu
dents in the various colleges as against
2150 for last year â being a gain of 131
for 1897-8.
Of the 2281 students at present en
rolled In the university, 1565 are taking
work at Berkeley, while 716 are attend
ing the professional colleges in San
Francisco. As compared with last year
the colleges at Berkeley have gained
135 students, while the professional col
leges have lost four. The number of
graduate students at Berkeley has in
creased within the year over 36 per
centâ from 108 to 147.
The proportion of women students at
Berkeley has increased slightly. Last
year 689 out of 1430, slightly over 41
per cent of the students enrolled in the
Berkeley colleges, were women. This
year the co-eds constitute over 42 per
cent.

that at the next election there will be
a warm contest for the office of Justice

the result was that neither made a de
cent living. Under the new law only
one Justice is allowed in a city where
a recorder is provided for. This ap
plies to Alameda, and as there is a
good living in the office if confined to
one man, it is expected there will be
a sharp contest for the coveted billet.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 6, 1898.
HOW INDIA
WAS HELPED
Dr. Prautch Assisted in
the Distribution of
Food.
The Fearful Famine Is Now
Thought to* Be at
an End.
Throughout the Empire There la a
Feeling of Gratitude for
Americans.
Oakland Office, San Francisco Call,
903 Broadway, Jan. 5
Rev. A. W. Prautch, D. D., who has
Just returned to Oakland after thirteen
years of missionary life in that dis
trict ir. India where the famine Is still
raging. toK; some pitiful stories to
night at tr.o First Methodist Church of
his experiences.
"In the Pundlta Ramabai's Home, for
which support was received from this
district, 200 starving children from the
worst famlne-strlcken district have
been en red for," he said. "This fact
should be particularly Interesting be
cause the home of which I speak la
entirely Bupported by the California
circle organized by the Princess Rama
bal. I have Just received from her a
letter In which she tella of the latest
news from her district. She sayÃ they
have just received sixty-four women
and children In the home who presented
a pitiful sight when they first came.
Some were too weak to move, others
were covered with sores, painful to
look at, and others through poverty had
been forced to wear the same clothes
po long that they would hardly hold to
gether.
"The famine relief work still goes on
and I am informed it will be necessary
to give out help till the middle of Jan
uary, bo that I hope by this time India's
i horrible famine is at an end. I was
; privileged to see the arrival of the
corn, rye and beans sent to India by
this country. On the one hand was
the Joy of the people and on the other
the clean beautiful grain, presenting a
contrast from the undressed rice which
we were used to seeing, and I can as-
Fure you that this substantial help was
more than acceptable to the starving
people. When It was distributed every
! body acknowledged that we made it
reach exactly the persons who most
needed it, and on behalf of the many
, who were helped, I wish to thank again
and again all the donors.
"The Indian Government was led
largely by American Influence to pro
vide public work for the purpose of
giving wages to thousands of starving
men. In our work we employed some
400 to 700 persons for five months, the
! men receiving 8 cnts a day and the
women 6 pice, or about a cent and a
half a day. They were only then half
fed. but it tided over the fearful pe
riod, and much good work was done
on these lines. A leper asylum, con
sisting of seven buildings, was enm
; pleted, a native hospital was built,
t and In one place a good well was dug,
! which supplied a whole village, and in
I other places miles of roads were laid
out."
The speaker stated that among the
j natives of India there Is a very warm
feeling for all Americans on account
lof the substantial help sent them
when most needed. Although the corn
! and provisions sent |rom this country
1 are comparatively small when the ex
j tent of the famine is considered, still
! the news of its arrival spread all over
i the country and helped to cheer many
I who did not receive any of the mate
rial benefit.
SCHOOL MATTERS.
Necessity for Providing Further
Accommodations for the In
creasing Nurr)berof Pupils.
ALAMEDA, Jan. s.â At the meeting
of the Board of Education last night
considerable time was spent In a dis
cussion of the pressing need for fur
ther school accommodations. The re
port of the Superintendent showed
that there were 2465 pupils mn\' en
rolled, while the number is being con
stantly added to. All the schools are
crowded and in one two pupils are re
quired to occupy seats only intended
for one. Something is needed to re
lieve the pressure, but nothinsr wu
suggested last night, though some plan
will be suggested before long.
The financial report for the last six
months showed a balance in all the
funds of the department of $10,772.39.
Rome time was spent in discussing
the care of the lawns of the different
schools. For some reason there is con
siderable rivalry as to whom this task
shall be given, and several gardeners
have applied for the Job. The Board
decided, however, to do nothing and
make no change until next June.
What Might rjave|Been.
OAKLAND, Jan. "..âCollector of Cus
toms Andrew I* Hollywood for this
port has compiled the following statis
tics at the request of the Board of
Trade, which show what might
have been the receipts of his of
fice here had the harbor been deep
ened and the ships made first discharge
here, instead of in San Francisco, and
afterward coming over here. It shows
75,000 tons of coal, yielding a revenue
of $4S,000; machinery, cement and
"th>'r merchandise duty amounting to
$125,000. Sixty-three ships have ar
rived in the ?ix months covered, thirty
two discharging at Long wharf, twen
ty-one at Adams wharf and ten at
Franklin street wharf.
Good Roads Association Flourishing.
OAKLAND. Jan. s.â The meeting of
the Good Roads Association to-night
at San Leandro proved to be a very
successful affair. Colonel Lyman
Bridges presided and Messrs. Manson,
Price and Ashe, State Highway Com
missioners, addressed the meeting on
the work that had been done in their
department in the way of statistics.
They then showed hnw the local asso
ciation could assist, which they
readily agreed to do. Three roads are
now under way v.hlrh will bs com
pleted as soon as possible. Seth Mann,
president of the Alameda County As
sociation,, then delivered an address
which was heartily received. The at
tendance was large and enthusiastic.

REPUDIATES
THE AGREEMENT
Florence Blythe Hinckley
Files a Surprising
Document
Says Inexperience Led Her to
Sign Away a Tenth of Her
Father's Estate.
Alleges She Indorsed * Dooumen
Held by Mr*. Byrne Without
Knowing Its Contents.
There is now on file in the County
Clerk's office a legal instrument in the
nature of an answer by Florence
Blythe Hlnckley, as co-defendant in
the actions of Henry J. Lang, Levi Ko
walsky, Henry Mohr, Samuel G. Mur
phy and Ida J. Phillips against Kate
C, Byrne to recover sums of money
alleged to have been advanced by them
to Mrs. Byrne to be used In the prose
cution of Florence Blythe Hinckley's
claim to the estate of her father,
Thomas H. Blythe, which practically
amounts to a repudiation on the part
of Mrs. Hinckley of the agreement held
by Mrs. Byrne, and which she al
leges entitles her to a 10 per cent in
terest of the estate lately recovered by
Mrs. Hlnckley. The filing of the paper,
however, notwithstanding the serious
ness of its wording, is not accepted lit
erally by those interested, as Florence
Blythe Hlnckley has agreed to- pay
Mrs. Byrne, In lieu of her efforts to re
gain for Florence her father's estate,
the snug sum of $280,000. which is $120,
000 short of Mrs. Byrne's original
claim.
The agreement referred to Is one
which was entered Into at the begin
ning of the contest for the estate orf
Thomas H. Blythe. Mrs. Byrne, who
as Mrs. James Crisp Perry was a step
grandmother of Florence Blythe Hinck
herfor an aggregate sum of about $160,
of Florence made the agreement with
her and on that paper became the cred
itor ct the people who are now suing
her in nn aggregate sum of about $160,
000. Now that the estate of Thomas
Blythe has been given Florence, It is
alleged that Mrs. Byrne Is entitled to
a share of the property, and in conse
quence those who lent her their money
and services are anxious to recover.
In her answer filed yesterday Flor
ence alleges that the agreement now
held by Mrs. Byrne giving her a right
to a tenth interest in the estate of
Thomas H. Blythe was obtained in a
manner not beyond reproach. Florence
states that when she signed the agree
ment on the 12th of March, 1892, she
was young and inexperienced and as
she had lived many years with the
holder of the agreement she signed
the Instrument when it was pre
sented to her without reluctance,
was presented to her for that purpose.
Mrs. Hinckley also states that owing
to her trust in Mrs. Byrne she did not
even read the paper when it was pre
pente'd to her for her signature and in
consequence repudiates it.
In the original application for the
honoring of the agreement. Mrs. Byrne
ask^d for 10 per cent of the estate,
which Fhe valued at $4,000,000. This
amount was too large to suit Florence
Blythe as she claims the estate Is only
worth $2.R00,000. and on her figures a
compromise â¢was reached. Florence
Blythe Hinckley has agreed to live up
to the terms of the compromise and
Just what the effect of the legal repu
diation of the agreement will be re
mains to he seen. The cases of the va
rious claimants for a portion of Mrs.
Byrne's portion of the estate are now
;>eing heard by Judge Seawell and a
decision on them Is expected in the
near future.
PROGRESS OF
THAT CANAL
The Special Committee on In
vestigation Makes Its
Report.
A Meeting Held at Which the Im
provement Was Fully
Discussed.
ALAMEDA, Jan. s.â The committee
appointed by Chairman Forderer of the
Joint meeting of Invited citizens of
Alameda and Fruitvale Sanitary dis
tricts No. 1 and 2, appointed to wait
upon Colonel Suter for Information
with regard to the completion of the
tidal canal, submitted the following
report at the meeting called this even
ing:
Your committee begs leave to report
us follows:
That, acting under the Instructions) of
said meeting, your committee waited on
Colonel Charles R. Suter, T'nlted States
Division Engineer for the Pacific Coast,
and was respectfully referred to Major
Heuer, engineer in charge of the Oakland
harbor improvements.
Major Heuer, when waited upon, cheer
fully gave your committee the following
Information:
That, pursuant to Instructions from the
Department of Engineers at Washington,
ne had prepared plans, specifications and
fstlmutes for the completion of that part
of the project where the recommenda
tions of Colonels Mendel and Suter did
not conflict: to wit:
Firstâ Dredging the channel 300 feet
wide from the Alice and Webster street
hri<lg^s west to deep water in the bay of
San Francisco to a uniform depth of 20
feet at low tide.
Secondâ Deepening the channel from
the Alice and Webster street bridges east
to the tidal basin to a uniform depth of
17 feet at low tide.
Thirdâ Dredging the channel in the tidal
basin on the East Oakland and Alameda
shores to a depth of 8 feet at low tide,
and deepening the tidal basin Itself to a
uniform depth of 2 feet at low water.
The above plnns and specifications have
been forwarded to the authorities at
Washington, and as soon as approved
bids will be advertised for, and if no
obstacles present themselves, work will
be commenced at once; the same to be
let on the continuous contract plan, but
not more than 25 per cent of the total
appropriation of $666,000 to be expended
in any one year.
The plans and specifications of Major
Heuer called for no bulkheacllng or fill
ing in of the canal, Â«nd unless specific
instructions to that effect are received
from Washington no action will be taken.
Your committee was also informed that
the improvements as outlined might pos
sibly be done for about $400,000. Respect
fully submitted.
Aicxander Mackie. chairman: J. R.
Knowland. John T. McLain. O. E. Derby,
Tohn Driver, committee.
Addendumâ Since writing the foregoing
report your committee has been reliably
informed that the plans and specifica
tions submitted by Major Hueur to the
juthorities at Washington have been re
turned with the approval only of "dredg
ing the channel 800 feet wide from the
Alice find Webster street bridges west to
deep water io the bay of San Francisco
to a uniform depth of 20 feet."
ALEXANDER MACKIE.
The report was received and filed
and the committee discharged with
thanks.
JO4OQ Hunt then moved thnt a co:"n
mltt-fe cf seven be appointed by the
chairman of the meeting to a?t with
a cantiniHec of a number from Sun
Lenndro tnd Fruitvale to use all legit
imate means to pecure the completion
of the tidal canal. Alex Maitcie was
opposed to the motion. He believed
that the city of Alameda should ' ab
action with Oakland and any other city
Interested in the improvement. Mr.
Pembroke believed that Colonel yon
Schmidt was superior to Colonel Suter
as regards the knowledge of Oakland
harbor. He stated that he believed
that if Colonel Suter were stripped of
his titles and compared with Colonel
Yon Schmidt that Yon Schmidt's word
as to the matter would be taken in
preference to Colonel Suter's. He
thought it was high time for Oakland
and Alameda to take measures to cut
through the canal and relieve it of filth.
He believed in another committee
meeting with Oakland. Mr. Forderer
stated that he did not think that the
Oakland committee would ever consent
to cut the canal through directly, and
he believed that if Alamedans did not
take some action the engineer's report
would be accepted by the Government.
A great deal of discussion was had over
the motion. It was finally adopted
and the chairman will appoint the com
mittee in a few days. It is expected
that like committees will be appointed
from San Leandro and Fruitvale. The
meeting adjourned until two weeks
from to-night, when it is expected that
' some report from the committee to be
! appointed will be received.
OVERWORKED OFFICERS.
Lteutenarjt Beooett and Three of
His Men Laid on the Sick
List.
Thp Influx of "rrooks" Into the rlty
during the present winter has piven
the Police Department a considerable
amount of extra .work. Not only have
tho men on this side of the city been
kept busy, but also those on the South
ern Heights, or Potrero section. Lieu
tenant George W. Bennett, who has
charge of this division of the Police
Department, had made up his mind In
the early part of the season that come
what may his district should be kept
free of the burglars and highwaymen
who ply their nefarious vocation on
unsuspecting citizens. This promise he
has faithfully kept, as the records will
show, for the southern section of the
city has been free from hold-ups or
burglaries. A quartet of Oregon bur
glars, however, pitched their camp in
the Potrero in the early part of De
cember, but the vigilant eye of Ben
nett soon discovered their headquar
ters, and inside of a week he had them
locked up on the charge of vagrancy
and at the same time had confiscated
their kit of burglar tools, which he
found In an empty house on Nebraska
street. The names of this quartet are:
Ed Fitzgerald. Frank Wood, Thomas
Burke and James Moran. The rogues'
gallery has been ornamented with their
phizes and the charge of vagrancy
placed against their names on the
prison register.
Since this quartet has been "bagged"
the Potrero has been free from import
ed crooks. The last case, and the one
which has brought the attack of ill
ness on Lieutenant Bennett, occurred
last Sunday night, when a man named
Daniel Meehen, who was employed in
the Union Iron Works and who roomed
: in the house of Mrs. Kane on Twen
i tieth street, broke into Miss Kane's
j room during the night and stole her
gold watch and chain, valued at $150.
The case being reported to Lieutenant
j Bennett, he at once set out to find the
thief. This he succeeded In doing,
: after being out for twenty-four hours
without rest or refreshment. The un
i dertaking was, however, too much for
his constitution: he received a severe
I stroke of apoplexy at his home on
, lowa street yesterday forenoon. At one
â  time his life was despaired of, but Dr.
! Jerome Anderson, who was called into
' attendance, pulled him through, so far
; as to give his many friends and his
'â  family hopes of recovery.
Lieutenant Bennett is not the only
member of the police force in the
southern section who has suffered by
! overwork in keeping the place free
;of thieves. Officer R. Ennls, who has
charge of the South San Francisco
station, is an invalid suffering from
inflammatory rheumatism. Officer
Robert McConnell, the prison keeper at
the Potrero station, is confined to his
bed suffering from a touch of the grip.
Officer T. C Clancy is down with an
enlargement of the liver. In the mean
time Officer John Lews is In charge
of the district, while Officer Tom Stan
ton has charge of the Potrero sta
tion. The only consolation growing out
of all this misfortune to the Police De
partment and the officers Immediately
I effected is that the Potrero is free of
j burglars and footpads.

THREE CHOICES
WERE BECALMED
Clear Sailing for Three
Others Timidly Sup
ported.
The Strongly Touted Sprinter
I Don't Know Finished
Third.
The Track Suited JoeUllman and He
Won, Heavily Backed by Some
Wise Ones.
The favorites about managed to
make a stand-off of it â 'ladies' day" at
Ingleside. finishing first in three of
the six events. The attendance was
about as large as usual, but the bet
ting was a trifle dull. "Longshot"
Conley was again the favored one of
the grand stand, and when he man
aged to get left at the post with Hei
delberg in the third event a groan
arose from its occupants that sounded
not unlike the roar of the tireless
breakers on the distant ocean beach.
The colored lad redeemed himself later
in the day though by riding a corkinp
race astride of Yankee Doodle.
If ever a horse was more strongly
"touted" than the northern sprinter
I Don't Know, that animal has yet to
make its appearance at the meeting.
He opened in the betting at 8 to 5, and
though the money poured into the
books on him. in various sized amounts,
the newcomers' odds gradually drifted
back in the betting to threes, the lay
ers of prices apparently not taking
much stock in the tip. Q. Morse had
the leg up, and, getting the Oregon
horse away from the post none to well,
Quickly showed in front and remained
there until the paddock was reached.
There he became leg weary and was
passed by both Joe Ullman and Twin
kle Twink, the former winning in a
drive by a neck. Stentor, the favorite,
made a miserable showing. The win
ner was played down from 10 to 6.
The Morello colt Imperious finally got
out of the maiden class in the opening
seven-furlong run. He was coupled
In the betting with Joe Levy, and the
ring laid :. to 1 against the pair. The
latter led the big field until well into
the stretch, where Cash Sloan came
with a rush on Imperious and won
handily from The Dipper, ridden by
Conley. Preston, the 6to 5 favorite,
could not get up, finishing a hard-rid
den third.
The Kittleman Bros, made it three
straight with the good filly Midllght in
the six-furlong sprint n.^xt decided,
"tt'ith Conley up. she ruled a 13 to 5
choice in the betting, and in a rat
tling drive with Lucky Dog the last
Bixteenth. earned the decision by a
nose. Miss Lynah and Sorrow showed
prominently out in front to the stretch
where they grew leg weary.
In the mile selling run which follow
ed. Master O'Connor, the midget rider
celebrated his first win in the saddle
Bince hi? arrival here. He had the leg
up on Kaiser Ludwlg, and Griffin's
horse ran away from his field, galloping
In ahead of Rufalba, a 6 to 1 chance
Old Mulberry stumbled into the show
Heidelberg, the third choice, with Con
ley up. and Miss Ruth, a longer priced
one, were left at the post.
Charley Thorpe got home first with
the favorite San Marco in the fifth
event, another mile selling affair
Thorpe took no chances with the first
choice, but kept his horse in front all
the way, and in a hard drive led Be
namela and Charlie Relff a length
Benamela managed to secure the place
by a nose.
The final race on the card, a mile and
a furlong selling affair, went to Ed
Purser's Yankee Doodle, ridden by
Conley. Leading from the start he
grot to the wire first in the hardest sort
of a drive, a nose before Song and
Danof, with Spencer In the saddle. Una
Colorado was a fair third at long odds

TRACK ITEMS.
Prestar Is a very slow colt to get In motion
and most of his races are lost at the start.
He also appears to be more at home In heavy
going.
While the talk Is going the rounds about the
soil of the two big tracks tangling up form.
It might be well for the Ingleei'le management
to Inform the people when it Intends to plow
up the course, as it would then be easier to
figure on the prospective winners. On Tuesday
it was Jn record-breaking condition, but yes
terday It had been so harrowed up that the
time would Indicate the presence of rain.
Sam Hlldreth seemed fated to lose Lucky
Dog. Some days ago the big sprinter was taken
out of a selling race by Ed Corrlgan, but Sam
managed to get him back the same night.
Yesterday he was claimed out of the third
event by Hugh Jones, owner of Mainstay. The
big fellow was entered to be sold for $700,
which makes him stand his new owner $975.
Hugrhey also -went after Benamela, to which
horse his colt Charlie RelfT finished third 'In
the fifth race, but was Just four minutes late
in putting In his claim. He supposed the time
allowed by the rule was twenty minutes, when
it is only fifteen.
Tom Griffin got rid of one of his string yes
terday. He had Kaiser Ludwtg in the third
event entered to be sold for $300. After the
colt had won in a gallop Johnny Coleman bid
him up to $500 an.l Griffin let him go. He
looks a very reasonable horse at the figure.
It looked very much as though Master O'Con
nor was caught napping with Miss Prim. The
mare was in a position to break, but she
either would not or O'Connor did not expect
a breakaway. Dave Gideon went down the
line on her.
"Butch" Fisher stood to make a mild "kill
ing" on the last race. He backed his old
horse Una Colorado at the long odds of 160 to 1.
and had he finished first Instead of third
"Butch" would have taken over $7000 from the
ring.
On Monday, January 10. the firm of Kllllp &
Co. will hold a big sale of hackneys, mares and
geldings sired by Imp. Paragon, at their sales
yard. Market street and Van Ness avenue.
The stock to be disposed of Is from the breed

THE SAN FKAXCISCO CAl__, THURSDAY, JAXTJART 6, 1898.
PEARY WILL
LECTURE HERE
The Distinguished Arctic Ex
plorer to Be in This City
Next Week.
Friedlander, Gottlob A Co. Hivs
Arranged to Have Him Begin His
Tour Here.
Dr. Fridjof Nansen will not be the
only explorer to tell of his wanderings
in the unknown northern regions to a
San Francisco audience, as Lieuten
ant R. E. Peary, whose fame as an
explorer is equal to Nansen's, will lec
ture at the California Theater next
month.
The announcement of Lieutenant
Peary's coming was made yesterday at
the Baldwin by Russell Palmer, who is
here as the personal representative of
Major James B. Pond, under whose di
rection the lecture tour will take place.
He has completed arrangements with
Friedlander, Gottlob & Co. to have the
lieutenant lecture on the 15th and 16th
of February.
In speaking of the coming tour Mr.
Palmer said: "Since his return from
the Arctic regions Lieutenant Peary
has received a reception almost
amounting to hero worship. He has
been dined and wined by the leading
geographical and scientific societies of
the East, and has won the confidence
of all by his modesty, courtesy and
learning. While in England his recep
tion was greater than has been accord
ed any American citizen since Grant's
notable visit. The Queen dined him
and he lectured before the famed geo
graphical societies of that country. The
Royal Scottish Geographical Society
presented him with its medal and other
honors were showered on him. Mr.
Peary will come direct from New York
to this city and will lecture throughout
the coast."
Mr. Palmer will leave in a few days
for the south, where he will arrange
other lecture dates for the distinguish
ed traveler.
Boodsmen r|eld.
A suit has been filed in the District
Court against A. W. Robinson and W. A.
Davies to recover $2500 bail for James
Anderson. Anderson, who was charged
with having counterfeit monfv In his
possession, left the vicinity and his pres
ent whereabouts is unknown.

BULLETIN BUNKO GAME
DENOUNCED BY VICTIMS
Piling Up Evidence of That Pa=
per's Crooked Methods.
Blackmailing Demands Are
Paid by some, but
Others Resist.
The Bulletin does not seem to- ap
preciate that the exposure of Its meth
ods has been made more in sorrow
than in anger. It has not the intellec
tual grasp to understand that the task
is one of pain: that mere recognition
of the fact that any paper is rotten
from the core out must cause discom
fort to decent journalism. If it could
realize that the exposure is made with
a desire not only to protect the com
munity but to have the Bulletin see it
self as others see it, perhaps it would
be grateful, and ultimately led into the
paths of rectitude, atoning by fasting
âprobably enforced â for Its career of
crime.
Of course the Bulletin cannot answer
the charge of working a confidence
game. The evidence is complete, the
verdict of "guilty"' on record. In the
court of public opinion there is no
"stay" -while lawyers wrangle over
technicalities. If a paper steals, it is
OBTAINED BY MISREPRESENTATION.
The solicitors from the Bulletin in this industrial edition came to inter
view me one day on the matter of giving me a "write-up," stating that I
had bec-n selected as one of the leading representatives in my line of busi
ness, and wishing for data and information in general in regard to myself
a.nd my l:r.o. of business to embody in this "write-up." Particular emphasis
was put on the words "write-up." and also the fact that the "write-up" was
to be free of cost. In answer to my inquiry as to where their particular
profit came in. it was suggested that no doubt I would not object to taking
a certain small ad. anyway, which I could suit myself on, anywhere from
$5 in SI I , they suggested: "Of course I would not ohject to buying a certain
number of papers to send away," all of which I would have been perfectly
willing; to do. The words "writ^-up." it seems to me. was the trick that did
the work for most of us. an.i this was understood by me and others with
whom I have conversed to he entirely without cost, and that the advertise
ment part proper was to be solicited later by a different set of men sent
around for that purpose. No one, however, has ever been to Bee me since
th.f- first conversation as to the "write-up, and no arrangement made for any
advertising of any kind. My surprise was very great on receiving a demand
tor 153 for advertising, and I have refused absolutely to pay the same, h<>
lievir.g that the contract whb obtained by misrepresentations, and could be
so proved. They have been to see me three times for their money, and also
sent me a request to call at their office. My business is such that it does not
require any advertising, my goods being sold entirely by travelers under no
particular trade mark er name, and the retail dealers are the only ones in
my line who do anything of the kind; hence there would be no reason why
] should do anything in this way, anyway.
a thief. If a paper tries to extort
money and holds over its selected vic
tims a threat.it is a blackmailer. There
is no midlde ground. But in lieu of a
reply such as would have been made
had the Bulletin had the slightest
grounds for defense, there is the undig
nified squeal of a poaching pig caught
under the gate. There were yesterday
many expressions of pity that a jo-ur
nal once respectable should have fallen
so low, and yet its victims show no
inclination to shield it. They feel that
they owe a duty to the public.
The evidence on which the Bulletin
has been hurled from a place among
honorable publications was already
heavy enough to be final, but it con
tinues to pour in. It shows that the
contracts under which the Bulletin is
trying to collect were procured by
fraud, and that the means resorted to
in the process of collection are the
most contemptible known to the dis
barred attorney. There is little need
for comment, as the correspondence
and interviews below fully explain
themselves. The following letter from
a well-known house is an interesting
sample:
Â , Dec. 22, 1597.
Business Manager San Francisco
Bulletinâ Dear Sir: We were consid
erably surprised to have presented to
us on Monday last a bill for $155 for
what purported to be advertising
done for our account and at our
direction in your special edition of
recent issue. We wish to say that
we authorized no advertising done
for that amount or for any amount
approximating it whatever. When
your solicitor first appeared with the
proposition to insert the matter re
ferred to we absolutely refused to
listen to him. saying we were not in
the market as advertisers even to the
most limited extent. He replied by
saying that the Bulletin was going to
write up all the most prominent busi
ness houses In the city, and that an
article on our establishment would
certainly appearâ that It would be
better it we prepared the matter our
selves so as to avoid errorsâ and,
finally, -that it would not cost us a
single cent. On our expressing sur
prise at so generous a proposition he
remarked that if the article pleased
us after it was written we could have
a rew additional linfs prepared as a
special notice, for which the charge
would be $1 a line, and in that way
we <-ou!d discharge our obligation
with regard to the main article for
which they absolutely refused to re
ceive compensation. But he also re
marked that this special notice was
entirely at our optionâ that it would
cost but a small amount in any event,
and he mentioned $5 or $10 as the
probable amount which we would be
called upon to pay. We told him we
had no time to furnish him with ma
terials, but that, a short time pre
viously, at the request of the secre
tary- of the Mechanics' Institute, we
had written a history of the business,
and. as it was copied In our letter
book, he could read it over and use
what material he wanted. He sug
gested that it would be a capital Idea
and we suggested that our type
writer copy the article and ho could
then take It away and look it over at
his leisure and select such parts as
he required. He did so, and in a few
days he produced a proof for our in
spection, which we examined, and
finding no typographical errors
handed it back with the remark that
It was correct. We noticed that the
article was copied almost word for
word, and wondered that it had not
been condensed, as the matter, as
written for the Mechanics' Institute,
was rather an elaborate statement of
facts from which a short account,
suited to their report, was supposed
to be written.
He then suggested that most of the
other houses had cuts of their build
ings, and inquired if we had any elec
trotypes that he could use, as it
would very much improve the ap
| earance of the artlUe. We told him
that our billheads were lithographed
by Pickman, Jones & Co. and possibly
they could furnish him with an im
pression. We saw later, when the
article appeared in the paper, that
your enterprising solicitor had suc
ceeded in obtaining the impression
also. Finally he produced the con
tract you possess, and remarking that
this referred to the special mention
of which he had spoken, requested
that it be signed, in order that the
Bulletin might know that it was au
thorized by us. We did not see the
special mention, hut supposed that it
was to be written by some one con
nected with your office and would ar>
penr in connection with the main
article or in some other part of the
paper, and. relying upon the repre-
sentations of your solicitor, besides
being extremely busy at the time,
the contract was signed without
scrutiny and in accordance with our
understanding of its purport. You
will say that this was carelessness on
our part, and we admit that It was.
but you must bear In mind that we
did not know we were dealing with a
special canvasser whose sole interest
in the transaction was to endeavor to
inflate our bill to the uttermost ex
âthis we found out later. We
supposed, at the time, that he was
one of your regular attaches, and.
knowing the Bulletin as an honorable
paper, relied upon any assertions Its
representatives might make, with the
belief that through him we were deal
ing with the lournal itself. This was
more especially so as we have always
regarded the Bulletin as particularly
a friend-Mr, de la Montanya having
been a subscriber to it. as your rec

of the first volume un to the present

â¢This ; courteous protest produced a
quick response from a man named
Jennings, who was pleasantly men
tioned yesterday as having been dis
barred, and the bill was paid. Similar
bills have been paid by firms desirous
of avoiding litigation. Here is the Jen
nings letter:
t Â§ A ? FRANCISCO, Dec. 23. 1897.
Â»trÂ» C 'a M< >ntanya Esq.. 214 Jackson
street. City-Dear Sir: The Bulletin
has handed me your favor of 22d lnst..
with instructions to reply.
L Th^,, Bu ], letln appreciates your
good will and support and begs to re
ciprocate.
J We beg to say you misapprehend
ed our solicitor when you understood
him to say "it would not cost us
il? I a m/] sle sen5 ent <" of which we
think a little reflection will convince
you. Newspapers are not run that
wa 7 * (a ,v fact which is well known).
What the solicitor did say, as he
states, and what he was authorized to
say was that a cut of your store and
mention in editorial review would be
made without cost; that Is, no charge
would be made for the cut and the
editorial mention; and none has been
made. The charge is $1 per line for
the "writÂ© up," which Is strictly In

accord with the terms of the contract.
A house In business as long as
yours, and with the successful career
that yours has had, would not, we
assume, sign a contract without
knowing what It was. and If It did,
we do not see, as we accepted tho
matter In good faith, what legal dif
ference It would make. No one is
better aware than yourself that a
man Is chargeable with notice to
whatever he puts his signature, and
we do not understand how, having;
done this and received the considera
tion undertaken on the part of the
Bulletin, there could be a demurrer
entered to bill. People do sometimes
make contracts that they afterward
regret, that do not. In their estima
tion, return them a quid pro quo; but
that, we submit, furnishes no legal or
just grounds for annulment or repu
diation. The fact that your house
has not for some time undertaken
much, if any, newspaper advertising
would suggest that an extended
notice in our industrial edition would
be agreeable to you.
In conclusion, we accepted this
contract from you in good faith, like
wise published the "write up."' and
feel that we shall have to insist on
the payment of this bill. If we
should make a reduction for one we
should have to for all, and this we
could in no wise consent to: besides,
many of the parties who Joined with
us in this special edition are constant
patrons of our Advertising columns,
and If we should make concessions to
any one these would be entitled as
suredly to consideration. We have
not done so, and to do so would in
volve us in loss. We believe that the
"write up" will result in much greater
advantage to you than this modest
charge. Kindly send check to cover.
Very truly yours,
C. M. JENNINGS.

ler & Co. was too keen for the bunko
sharp. The game was cleverly put up
to rinch the firm to the extent of $50
or $75, but Mr. Mau was shrewd enough
to mark on the accepted copy thÂ»
words, "The expense in no event to ex
ceed $5." The write-up which the so
licitor brought to the store for accept
ance was rejected, and forty words
were substituted. According to the
calculation of the solicitor the words
would run eight to a line, therefore five
lines would amount to forty words c.r
$5. Speaking of the transaction Mr.
Mau said: 'The Bulletin sent in a bill
of $9, hut we pay only $5. I did not
sign anything, but simply put the rub
ber stamp on the acceptance and wftote
on the face of the copy that the amount
was not to exceed $5. The difference is
slight, but we pay only $i>."
Max Ordenstein, 320 Battery street,
was among the bunkoed. He paid up
and did not intend to say anything
about it until he heard that others who
had been victimized by the Bulletin's
game were making the scheme public.
"I hay no time now to tell you all
about it. as I am busy balancing my
books, hut r''iif to-morrow and I will
give you the whole story Just as it hap
pened," said Mr. Ordenstein. "My
case is similar to the Excelsior Glove
Company's experience," continued the
victimized merchant. "I paid, but I
do not care to say how much. It was
a swindle, all the same. I signed no
contract and made no agreement t<>
pay what was demanded. That's
right. I was bunkoed."
At the meeting of the Bulletin's vic
tims called by the Merchants' Associa
tion F. W. Dohrmann stated in the
clearest and, most explicit language in
the presence of Boyle, the business
manager of the bunko paper, that the
words "one dollar a line" were stamped
on the "O. K." signature of Nathan,
Dohrmann & Co., after the document
was taken from the store. "The dollar
a line stamp was not there when I
signed," said Mr. Dohrmann. "I would
take an oath to that."
An old and respected institution
which has patronized the Bulletin for
thirty-four years figures in the bun
koed list. It was planned to swindle
this institution out of a sum consider
ably in excess of $200, when only an
expenditure of $5 was authorized. One
of the directors of the institution said
to the business manager of the Bulle
tin: "We have never sued or been sued
since our institution was created. We
will pay the full amount of this claim
if you demand it, but when you get our
receipt you get notice that no solicitor
from your paper shall ever be received
In our place."
"How much did you figure on pay
ing?" asked Mr. Boyle.
"The sum which we authorlz- d was
$5. and in no event did we expect to go
above $25."
The business manager then took out
an envelope containing several con
tracts, saying as he disclosed the con
tents of the envelope: "These are con
tracts made by our particular friends
and no suit will be brought to enforce
A VICTIM'S EXPERIENCE.
A solicitor of the Bulletin called on us some weeks ago and stated that the
Bulletin would publish an illustrated and industrial edition. It would be a
grand thing, containing cuts of all the principal wholesale houses, factories,
etc., with a description of the same, amount of capital Invested, etc. Before he
got any further I told him It was no use to talk to me, as w<> would not spend
a cent advertising. Then he proceeded to explain that it was not an advertising
scheme. Thousands of Bulletins would be sent to different points In the United
States, and the purpose of this edition is to show what great advantages this
city has from a commercial standpoint; and In view of the expected great rush
to Alaska next spring.it would no doubt be the means of convincing a great many
that San Francisco Js the best place to outfit. That all they wanted was the
moral support and co-operation of the business men; that there would be 'â¢abso
lutely no charge for the write-up." But the paper was going to a great expense,
and we would be at liberty to donate whatever we saw fit if we were satisfied
with the write-up. Then I again told him we did not care to have a write-up,
in reply to which he said: "Well, you can give anything from $1 up: you would
not object to giving a dollar?" Then I told him If It would not b<; any more he
could go ahead. He then wrote down a few lines, which I dictated to him, and
afterward handed me a paper to sign, stating at the same time it was "only a
matter of form to show at the office that we gave our consent to a write-up."
A few days afterward we recelw-d by mail a typewritten pr.iof of about twelve
or thirteen lines; I don't' remember exactly. I made a correction of the street,
and returned it by mail as requested. A few day* after this write-up and cut
of our store appeared in print, a collector called with a Mil, not for $1, as per
agreement, but for $42. I protested, of course, but r sed to pay any more than
what I agreed.
their collection. Your contract is here
and you will not be sued."
At last accounts the matter rested in
this manner. The BuUetin will prob
ably receive $5, and a chance to try the
bunko game again.
About the rawest work of bunko
steerers was done at the house of Con
radi & Goldbprg, 730 Montgomery
street. The solicitor had the cut of
the building to display, and likewise
had committed to memory the fine
rigmarole about the "absolutely free
notice" in general terms. Speaking of
the game. Mr. Goldberg of the firm yes
terday remarked: "The solicitor sat
there juat where you are sitting. He
Bald nothing would be charged for tlie
picture of the building, but that a lit
tle write-up would cost 51 an inch. He
took out his paper and a rule and drew
a diagram of an inchâ not an inch
square, but a space a half inch one
way and two inches another. We
agreed to take several inches. The so
licitor then went away, and some time
after that there came to the store a
bungling write-up which we did not
want. We prepared something more
suitable, and I supposed it would
amount to five or six dollars. I signed
something which I did not read, as I
was very busy when the paper was put
on my desk, but nothing was ever said
about a dollar a line. When the bill
for $65 came I thought there was a mis
take and told the collector so. I thought
it was $6 50. I went to the Bulletin
office and saw Wolf. He said arro
gantly that $65 was what the contract
called for. I demanded to see the man
with whom I had made the agreement.
Wolf said. 'He's only a solicitor and
is not here. The contract talks.' My
first thought was to refuse payment,
and stand a lawsuit, but recollecting
that a suit in law does no good to a
firm, I concluded that since I had been
such a jackass as to sign something
without reading it carefully, I ought
to be made pay even if the amount was
1600. At first I was ashamed to W
the public know that I had been bun
kood. but when I found that others v no
had heen swindled in the same way
were coming to the front with their
experience I decided to speak."
That's the reason I notified The
Call. We have been miserably swin
dledâyes, bunkoed, that is the term.
The glove company's case is the same
as ours. Hereafter I sign nothing.
This morning a man came to me and
said: 'Goldberg, you own a lot in the
cemetery?' I said' -Ypp." Then he said
'We are getting a subscription to fix
up the walk and I want you to sign
for your share. It will be very little.'
I told him to go ahead and fix up the
walk and that I would pay my share.
He said, 'Then sign the little paper."
I replied, 'I sign nothing from this time
out. You take my word â no more sig
natures from me after my experience
with the Bulletin.' "
R. H. Pease, vice-president and man
ager of the Cioodyear Rubber Oom
puny, somewhat reluctantly consented
to tell the story of how deception was
practiced on him by the Bulletin. "A
solicitor called on me and asked to be
allowed to give our firm a write-up,"
said Mr. Pease. "He said it was to
appear among others in an industrial
edition. I told him that I had re
fused all the other paper? an adver
tisement and did not think I could
give him one. In fact I refused him
point blank. He then told me that the
write-up would be without charge and
was done for the purpose of adver
tising the Bulletin among the large
business houses and to advance the
city's interests. Witn this under
standing I gave him a few facts about
our business which he incorporated in
an article that I received some days
later. There were some corrections
madp by me and I marked the copy
â¢ â¢ X and returned th.^ same to the
Bulletin people. The lirst I knew of
being charged for the article was when
a . "Hector called and tendered me a
bill for $119, being at the rate of $1 a
line. I was surprised at receiving the
bill and declined to m^.-t it. telling
him I had not agreed to pay anything
for the write-up.
"The next day the man who had Inter
viewed me called and ihowed me a blue
contract on which was the name of the
firm in rubber stamp. He told me I
had signed it. which I denied. He told
me his word was as good as mine, and
on that point I did not care to argue.
After he left it occurred to me that he
might have asked to be allowed to
stamp the firm's name on a paper so
as not to make a mistake in spelling,
and he may havf placed it on the con
tract, which 1 had never seen. It has
never been my ustom to sign con
tracts with a rubiier stamp, particular

have called on the proprietors and

J. C. HALT,. MANAGER OF THE
ONION LITHOGRAPH COMPANY.
325 SANSOME STREETâ I have no
kirk coming, because I must have en
tered into the contract with my eyes
open. However. I thought the bill
would not exceed $25. and it amounted
to about $50. When I paid the bill I
told Boyle that I would charge the ex
tra sum up to experience.
J. S. DANKER. MANAGER OF THE
FIRM OF S. P. TAYLOR & SONS.
DEALERS IN PAPER AND PAPER
BAGS. 400 SANSOME STREETâ The
solicitor told me the bill would not
amount to more than $5. I don't re
member signing any contract, but must
have done It, as my name is there in
my own handwriting. They sent in a
bill for $40, but they will wait some
time before they get that sum. The
main thing that worries me is that I
made such a jackass out of myself, but
there is one consolationâ there are
others.
L. G. SRESOVICH, FRUIT DEAL
ER AT 507 SANSOME STREETâ It is
the meanest thing out. I was told I
could put in a small ad. and the bill
would be all right, the write-up to be
free. They sent in a demand for a bill
that nearly reached $50. They will
take less.
D. E. ALLISON OF THE D. E.
ALLISON COMPANY, PRODUCE
MERCHANTS, 501-3 SANSOME
STREETâ I didn't know I was to pay
a cent and was led to believe the write
up was to be free. I signed a contract
and did not take any time to read it, as
I regarded the Bulletin as a decent
sheet. I was sent in a bill for $34 and
when I refused to pay it was told suit
would be brought if it wpre not settled
on a certain day. I didn't pay and no
suit has yet been brought. It was the
smoothest thing I ever saw. I am will
ing to do what is right in the matter
and that is all.
HENRY CAMPE, DEALER IN
\VIN*:s AND LIQUORS. 221-5 FRONT
STREETâ The bill I received for the
write-up given me in the Bulletin In
dustrial Edition amounted to over $40.
It has been compromised and I do not
care to say too much about it on that
account. It was very smooth work
and I was led to believe the bill would
not amount to more than $10, at the
outside limit. I went on the assump
tion when I signed the contract that
the paper was an honorable one and
would deal justly with reputable mer
chants, iam sorry to say that I was
disappointed and I think the action
was reprehensible.
L. HARTTER OF HARTTER,
HAVES & CO., WHOLESALE GRO
CERS. 216 FRONT STREET-I was
led to believe that the write-up was to
be free by the Bulletin solicitor and
was thunderstruck when I received a
bill for $43. I have refused to pay it
and have not gone to see the business
manager, as I have been requested to
do. it is a pure skin game In my opin
ion, and there will be trouble in camp
beforo they can make me pay any such
sum as that.

COMPANY.?,O7 BATTERY STREETâ
Our rasp is rather a peculiar one, as
we had write-ups In the Buleitln before
and had always paid $10 for copies of
AN EASTERN SWINDLE.
The Bulletin solicitor called on us and asked for a photograph of our
place of business. He said that the paper was going te advertise the local
merchants free of charge. They could, of course, give anything they
pleased toward defraying the expenses of the publication. When the proof
was shown me I marked it O X and mailed it. The agreement to pay $1 a
line for the advertisement was written in afterward, by whom I do not
know, but certainly not by any member of the firm. A bill for $3S 75 wna
presented to me. I refused to pay it, as I had learned that the method pur
sued was an old Eastern style of swindling. Had the paper acted In the
least bit fair we would have paid something for the advertisement. As it
now stands we will never pay a cent. When the collector called a few days
ago 1 told him that it was a swindle, and offered to bet him $500 that no one
would pay. He then left the office.
the paper. We made the same arrange
ment as regards the facts concerning
us published in the Industrial Edition,
and had a bill for $55 sent in. We do
not intend to pay it and the paper will
have a sorry time making collection.
Their game was one of the slickest I
ever sau .
M. EHRMANN, OF THE FIRM

WHOLESALE GROCERIES, 104
FRONT STREETâ I was informed by
the solicitor that the write-up would
cost us nothing and signed a contract
for nn ad. with the understanding that
it was not to exceed five or six dollars.
They never came for the ad., and Bant
in a bill for $39 for the statement pub
lished regarding the firm. We are will
ing to pay what we agreed, no-t to ex
ceed $6, and that is all.
HAMILTON PAGE OF THE INDI
ANAPOLIS FURNITURE COMPANY,
on Mission Ftreet, between Third and
Fourth, was fortunate enough to es
cape the bunko men. "When the proof
of the 'write-up" was forwarded me to
Â») X," said Page yesterday afternoon,
"I telephoned the Bulletin to inquire
the cost. I knew that the Bulletin was
not giving a reading notice and a cut
of our building without expecting
something in return. A representative
of the paper called on me and told me
what it would cost. I made him a
much lower offer and he accepted it.
The ad. was published and I paid what
1 promised."
R. L. LILIENTHAL. SECRETARY
OF THE BERNHARD MATTRESS
COMPANY, is anxious to meet the so
licitor who called on him. "I was busy
at the time," said Lilienthal, "and told
him that we did not care to advertise.
He assured me that the Bulletin was
getting up a trade edition for the ben
efit of its patrons and that a write up
and cut of the building would not cost
anything. I gave him a catalogue of
our house to get rid of him, telling
him at the same time that he could get
all the data he desired from it. He
handed me some kind of a printed pa
per and asked me to put the address
of the firm on It, so that there would
not be any mistake. I stamped the
paper without reading it. A few days
later I received a proof with a request
that I O X it if it were satisfactory.
I did so, and thought nothing more of
the matter until a collector came
around with a bill for $35. I told him
that the firm had not contracted for
any advertisement. He then informed
me that I had signed a contract and
that he would send around the man
who secured it. I answered him that
it would afford me great pleasure to
meet him and kick him into the street.
There is one thing certain, we will not
pay a cent. I told the collector that it
was a skin game, and I guess he knew
what I said was true, for I haven't
heard from him since."
BERNARD ROSENBERG. SECRE
TARY OF WILMERDING, LOEWE &
CO.. was presented with a bill for $27.
"The solicitor came into the store."
said Rosenberg, "and asked for some
data as the Bulletin wanted to give the
house a gratuitous write-up. I gave
him some particulars, and he left after
assuring me that the advertisement
would not cost anything. He said that,
all that would be expected of us would
be to buy some copies of the issue to
distribute among our customers. A
proof was sent us but we did not re
turn it. You can say that the $27 bill
will never be paid by the firm as we
never contracted for the advertise
ment."
HORN & CO.. TOBACCONISTS, at
205 Battery street, are among the vic
tims of the swindle. "We were elected
hy the Bulletin," said one of the firm
yesterday, "and feel very sore ever it.
We do not care, however, to go into
detail*."
HERRMANN KLTLLMANN. PRESI
DENT OF KULLMANN, SALZ &
CO.. LEATHER DEALERS, 106 BAT
TERY STREETâ The whole story was
told in The Call this morning. I was
led to believe that the advertisement
would be gratuitous, bo you can imag
ine my surprise when a bill for $77 was
presented by the Bulletin. It hasn't
been paid, and never will be paid. I
don't know how the game was worked,
but I do know that there was some
hocus-pocus about it. I wasn't hyp
notized, and didn't sign any contract,
so the Bulletin has no claim against
the firm.
I. S. ACKERMAN, one of the mana
gers of the American Crockery and
Glassware Company, at 108 and 110
Pine street, is very indignant over the
deceptions practiced on the firm. "The
solicitor." said he, "told Mr. Block that
the Bulletin was going to give the
merchants a write-up that would cost
but a few dollars â just enough to cover
the cost of the cut and the type set
ting. A few days ago a bill for $70 was
presented and we refused to pay it, for
there is a business principle at stake.
It is not the amount we object to. but
the deceptive methods practiced by the
solicitor. We would rather spend $5000
than pay an unjust bill like the one
presented."
G. H. M ALTER, SECRETARY OF
THE ST. GEORGE VINEYARD COM
PANY, at 123 Market street, is saving
a $79 bill as a memento of the visit of
the Bulletin bunko man. "It was rep
resented to me," said Malter yesterday,
"that the Bulletin was preparing a
special edition, and that in order to
defray expenses, a write-up of the com
pany would only cost $10. I told the
solicitor to go ahead, but did not sign
any contract with him. A proof was
sent me and I sent it back after mark
ing it O K. You can imagine my sur
prise when a bill for $79 was presented
to me. I am willing to pay $10, the
amount I promised, but not one cent
more. The St. George Vineyard Com
pany pays all its just debts on present
ation of a bill, but as secretary, I will
never allow or pay a bill like the one
presented by the Bulletin."
H. MOHR of the South San Francisco
Packing and Provision Company, 218
Front street, was absent from his
place of business yesterday. The book
keeper said that he had heard the con
versation between Mr. Mohr and the
Bulletin solicitor in regard to the write
up in the Industrial Edition, and that
he had represented that the only cost
to the firm would be a dollar. The
bookkeeper heard the solicitor use the
words, "A dollar won't break you, any
way." The bill that was sent in was
for $114. It is stated that a reasonable
settlement will be made, but that no
such sum as mentioned will be paid
under any consideration.
J. IVANCOVICH OF THE FIRM
OF IVANCOVICH & CO.. COMMIS
SION MERCHANTS, 209 AND 211
WASHINGTON STREETâ I was ad
verse from the start of advertising in
this jubilee edition of the Bulletin for
the simple reason that I never adver
tise In the newspapers whatever. Mr.
Price came to me and asked me if I
wouldn't consent to a write-up of my
establishment generally, together with
a cut of my building, mentioning at
the same time that it would cost me
nothing. I asked him how a paper
could publish .such things free of
charge, and he told me that the Bulle
tin people were willing to defray the
expense of gratuitously publishing a
write up and cut of each business
house in the city, as it would materi
ally benefit the metropolis and also in
crease the circulation of the Jubilee
edition In the Eastern cities. He
showed me the list of merchants who
had already agreed to advertise In the
paper. Not wishing to be excepted
from them in a matter of this kind (as
I thought the Bulletin people were do
ing it for the good of the State) I
agreed tr> have my establishment de
scribed and exhibited before the pub
lic.
He then gave me a paper to sign, tell
ing me that this was to be done simply
MISERABLY SWINDLED.
"We were miserably swindled and do
not hesitate to say so openly. Our
experience was about the same as
that related by the Excelsior Glove
Company In The Call. We paid $65
because we did not care to have a
lawsuit abotit so small a matter. Now
that the Bulletin has compromised
with the glovo company and other
firms we- Intend to take measures to
recover the amount from the paper.
The solicitor came here and distinctly
stated that the price for the write-up
would be $1 an Inch. He explained
fully what an Inch meant, and we
were astonished when the bill came In
for $65. Our bookkeeper was certain
that there was some mistake and that
only $6 30 was charged. When we
asked to see the man who made the
contract or called to see us we were
told that he was only a solicitor and
was no longer there. We insisted
that the man who came to see us
should be produced, but Wolf would
not produce him. We were bunkoed,
and concluded at first to say nothing
about It, believing that we were the
only houae taken In. Now that others
come forward and admit that they
have been done up by the- same game
we are willing to speak. That is the
reason we telephoned to The Call
office as soon as we read the state
ment of the Excelsior Glove Company.
We have all the papers. Including the
letter from the Bulletin's attorney
demanding instant payment on threat
of instituting suit. At first we said
if we have been such jackasses as to
sign a contract without knowing
what it contained we ought to pay,
but the dollar a line was never men
tioned by the solicitor.

as a matter of course, and associating
no importance to the paper whatever
Thinking that everything was all right,
I inadvertently signed it without first
perusing It. I told Mr. Price I would
give him five dollars to help the edition
alc-ng. I thought no more of the mat
ter until a few days ago, when the
collector of the paper presented me
with a bill for $61. I asked him for an
explanation, and in answer he told me
that he had devoted sixty-one lines of
space in the edition to the exclusive
description of my establishment, and
at the rate c-f a dollar a line I owed
him 561. He showed me the contract
with my signature affixed and asked
me if I could deny its authenticity. I
admitted that I had signed it, without
knowing its purport, but I told him it
%vas a fraud and defied him to collect
the money. Since this interview I have
been repeatedly requested to call on,
Boyle and arrange matters, but I re
fused to go.
GEORGE HERMANN, PROPRIE
TOR OF THE PACIFIC AMMMONIA
BOTTLING COMPANY â I agreed
with the Bulletin solicitor to pay $5 for
the insertion of my business card in
the paper and informed him that I
wanted nothing else in the way of a
write-up in their holiday edition ex
cept the insertion of this card. I have
my bookkeeper and others as witness
es to this fact, and the bills these peo
ple hold against me will not be paid.
I recognize that the sketch and his
tory of my establishment were ex
tremely complimentary; but I didn't
authorize it and I won't pay for it.
C. M. MANN, 211-213 WASHING
TON STREETâ I do not intend to pay
a cent of the bill for $61 that these peo
ple hold against me, as I told the so
licitor when he came to me that if the
write-up and cut cost a cent I didnjt
want them. He told me that I needn't
be afraid on that score, as the Bulletin
was doing it for the good of the city
and didn't mind losing a few dollars
in the interest of such a cause. I told
him if this was the case he could have
my permission to write as much as he
pleased concerning my establishment.
This he did to the extent of sixty-one
lines, and now expects to collect $1 a
line for the praise that was given my
establishment on a verbal promise that
it was to be free. I refused to pay the
money and I intend to place the mat
ter in the hands of my attorney.
Senator Braunhart Is Angry.
Senator Samuel Braunhart, who Is
also a member of the Board of Port
Wardens, is justly indignant because
of the use by the Bulletin last night
of a private letter received by him over
a year ago from Louisville, Ky. The
letter has no bearing on the charge
that the Bulletin, through its agents
and solicitors played a sharp bunko
game on the local merchants.
"I am astonished." said Braunhart,
last night, "that the letter was pub
lished, and I have a poor opinion of the
person who gave it to the Bulletin for
publication. It is true that I received
the letter and in March last I gave it
to J. P. Edoff, president of the Califor
nia Protective Association, and mem
ber of the firm of Dallemand & Co., for
his private use. It was a private and
confidential letter, and I believed that
Edoff, knowing that, would treat it as
such. I intrusted it to him as a pri
vate communication so that he alone
might have the benefit of the contents.
You now see how the confidence re
posed was betrayed."
REAL ESTATE MEN SPEAK.
They Will Oppose ar> Objectiooable
Plumbing Ordioance Before
the Supervisors.
About a dozen representatives of the
larger real estate firms met yesterday
in the offices of O. F. van Rhein &
Co., 636 Market street, to con
sider the questions involved in the
proposed plumbing ordinance, to which
all real estate men are strongly op
posed. O. F. yon Rhein was elected
chairman, and the proposition was dis
cussed from every standpoint.
There are sixty-eight sections in the
proposed ordinance, all of which are
couched in technical terms, and the
principal objection to it from the real
ty men is, that it will permit irrespon
sible deputies to condemn tiie plumb
ing of all houses over five years old
and put In new pipes arid drains. They
state that they are for anything in the
nature of an improvement, but regard
this provision as harmful.
It was finally decided that a commit

Committee of the Board of Supervises
to argue the .question Friday next, at

family. The head of the household is
Gustav Diehl, a French cook, and with
his wife and four little children live at
316 Seventh street. All of these are
huddled in two small rooms for which
they pay $5 per month. Diehl was
formerly a well-to-do cook in several
of the large hotels in Europe and the
East. It was an evil day on which he
came to this coast, for bad luck has
followed him ever since. For a time
he followed his vocation in this city
and then went to Seattle, where event
ually he started in business for himself,
but failed. Again he came to San
Francisco and worked in one or two of
the best eating establishments and
clubs, but in every place he was obliged
to give v*-> his work on account of ill
health.
Just before the holidays he found
employment In a restaurant on Sixth
street, but that failed on the day before
Christmas, and Diehl only received $2,
which sum has lasted the entire fam
ily ever since. Most of the time the
father has been so sick with consump
tion that he has not been able to work,
and when the neighbors learned of the
condition of the family through the
children there was not a single crust
of bread in the house. Officer MrMur
ray of the society informed the Asso
ciated Charities of the condition of the
family and the help was promised at
once.
