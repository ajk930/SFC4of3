Kinley, was shot dead at 6:10 this even-
Ing in front of the residence of Mrs.
Eva B. Althouse, widow of the late
George Althouse. 319 Lincoln avenue,
where he is presumed to have gone to
make a Call. Five shots were fired,
three of which entered his body. Mrs.
Anna C. < Jeornre has been placed under
arrest on suspicion of murder.
gaxi â¢: a unconscious when neigh
bors arrived and began investigating
the cause of the shooting, and dead
when the physicians and officers ar
rived, the (physicians having expressed
the opinion that death was instan
taneous, tfiree bullets having entered
vital spots. The position of the body
indicated that he had been on the step
to the Althouse residence when the
- were tired. The body was taken
to an undertaking room and placed in
charge of the Coroner. Immediately
after the autopsy it will be taken to the
home â¢: M. C. Barber, a brother-in
law, where Saxton. who was unmar
ried, made his home.
Mr. Saxion left the Barber home
about 6 o'clock, riding his bicycle, and
this was the last seen of him by his
Is, The Althouse home was dark
ami locked, and the neighbors said Mrs.
Althouse frad not been at home for the
past three days. One of the neighbors
said a woman who was supposed to
have done the shooting had passed
back of the house. Mrs. George took
her supper, as usual, at a downtown
restaurant at 4:45 o'clock, and some
time later was on a westbound car, and
according to the motorman, A. Story.
F ,. t atH Â«* iimHHli avenue, ne*:r the
Althouse home. About 9 o'clock she
was arrested by the police officers and
locked up. Trouble in locating her was
due principally to the fact that she
moved from her old home yesterday.
Mrs. George is the divorced wife of
Sample C. George, who formerly was a
tenant of Saxton in his downtown busi
ness block, conducting a dressmaking
business. Her divorce was obtained in
Dakota and a proceeding later filed in
local courts by the husband against
Baxton charged that Saxton h,ad sent
her t: ure the divorce, the pro
ceedings here beint." a suit fc-r damages
for th^ alleged alienation of the wife's
ions.
This case has been through all the
Intermediate courts and was passed
upon by the State Supreme Court on
an interpleading and finally remanded
for hearing on its merits here. Before
this occurred, and on Wednesday, a set
tlement was effected. Saxton paying
Genre* $I^." on the claim set up of $20,
000 for damages. Mrs. i It^irge has also
had several cases against Saxton,
claiming the detention of furniture, the
defense of Saxton being that the arti
cles were held for overdue rent in the
rooms. Mrs. Althouse, in front of whose
house the shooting occurred, several
months ago began peace proceedings
against Mrs. George, alleging that her
life hftd been threatened.
For some time past Mrs. George has
been living at 1516 West Tuscarawas
6treet, about five blocks away fr<.-m
where the shooting occurred. Early in
the week she is said to have packed up
h^r household goods to have them
chipped to her mothers home at Hano
verton. Since her goods have been
.she has been living at the rooms
of Mrs. Jake Oberlin, in the same house.
She left the house at 9 o'clock this
morning and did not return. While the
officers were talking to Mrs. Oberlin to
night Mm. George was seen coming
across a lot near by. As she attempted
to go around the house to get in the
back way, she was put under arrest by
the officers and taken to police head
quarters. When she was brought into
the station she seamed to be self-pos
sessed. She was given a chair, and
one of the officers took a small cape
which she carried and placed it on the
SAMPSON GIVES
WAY UNDER THE
NERVOUS STRAIN
High Tension of the Pdst Several
Months Causes tfyeÃecir
Admiral's CollapAe.
NEW YORK, Oct. 7.â The Washington correspondent of the Her
ald telegraphs: I am informed late to-night that AdmiAl Sampson is
extremely ill in Havana. He has been constantly fallinr and is un
able to do any work. Other members of his command think he should
go north, but dare not suggest it. His physician was callei to him in a
great hurry after midnight this morning. He became Ttbrse during
the day and his life was thought to b^ in danger, but theie is no im
mediate fear of death. I
His trouble is a general giving way of his constitutlol under the
strain of last year, coupled with chronic stomach complallt.
The San Francisco Call
table. Prosecuting Attorney Pomerent,
who was present, pulled his chair in
front of her and said:
"Mrs. George, where were you about
6 o'clock?"
Mrs. George called Turnkey Becherer
and whispered something in his ear. He
spoke to the prosecuting attorney and
then told her that he could not grant
her request. The question as to her
whereabouts at the hour named was
.ted. She answered in a perfectly
calm and quiet tone, "Pardon me, sir;
I will talk when the proper time
comes."
"Did you go out on the streetcars
about that time?
There was no answer to the question.
"I will say to you, Mrs. George," said
the prosecutor, "that if you had noth
ing to do with this, we will not detain
you a moment."
There was no answer and the prose
cutor said, "Do you know why the offi
cers brought you here?"
No answer.
"Do you know that Mr. Saxton is
dead?"
Th^re was no answer save a slight
twitching of the lips.
Mr. Pomerent then said, "It has been
said to me that you threatened to kill
him. Is it true?"
To this and several other questions
asked the woman returned no reply
whatever.
Mrs. George was then taken into the
women's department. No weapon was
found on her. The skin of her hands
! was scraped and will be analyzed to
! see whether there are any traces of
powder upon them. She was locked up
to await a hearing.
It was common talk that Mrs. George
would make frequent threats of taking
Saxton's life. Many of these threats
are said to have been sent through the
I mafia, and the Federal Grand Jury sit
ting in Cleveland last fall Indicted her
for alleged improper use of the mails.
Mrs. George gave a bond, and the mi
i dietment, so far as is known here, is
! still alive.
Sample C. George, the husband, is
| now reported to have been married to
1 a second wife for more than a year. He
iis reported married . in Wheeling to
' Miss Lucy Graham of Alliance, and the
i marriage was kept secret until after
j the settlement with Saxton. As soon
; as George got his damage money from
i Saxton he announced his marriage.
j Mrs. George claims Saxton deceived her
i and deserted her.
NEWS BROKEN TO
MRS. M'KINLEY
WASHINGTON, Oct. 7.â When the
startling news of the murder of George
Saxton, Mrs. McKinley's brother,
reached the White House to-night
President and Mrs. McKinley had just
come down stairs to receive the mem
bers of the Episcopal convention. There
was a hurried conference of the officers
of the White House as to what should
! be done to convey the tidings to Mrs.
! McKinley, and it was finally decided to
wait until the guests had departed.
The President was called aside by
' Secretary Porter Just as the last guest
bade him good night and shown a brief
dl patch from Canton saying that
<;â¢â¢ rge Saxton was shot and killed this
( evening. The President tenderly es
corted Mrs. McKinley to the upper part
, ol th< house and there as gently as the
i clrcun stances would admit broke the
news to her. Mrs. McKinley, although
! at first stunned by the tidings, bore up
i remarkably well. She expressed a de
: sire for particulars and the President
i at once had telephonic connection made
with frienis in Canton with whom he
! talked personally for some time. All
: the officials around the White House,
j respecting the wishes of the President,
â  are naturally reticent about the affair.
I The only announcement made officially
; is that the President has received con
i flrmation of th~ death of Mr. Saxton
and that he will go with Mrs. McKin
ley to Canton to-night.
Secretary Porter further stated that
i the President would keep his public en
â  gagtments in connection with the
Western trip, the only change being
! that lie would go from Canton Sunday
; night instead of leaving here Monday
I morning, as originally planned.
SAX FRANCISCO, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 8, 1898.
THE LEECH LAKE BATTLE GROUND.
Scene of the battle between General Bacon's troops and the Pillager Indians just
before the firing began, as described by Colonel J. T. Sheehan, United
States Marshal, and from photographs. On the right, in the fore
ground, is Bog-Ah-Me-Go-Shik's log house, used later as a hospital.
To the left are the little side-wheel lake steamers Flora and Chief, which
brought the party from Walker. On the shore, near the house, Colonel
WATSON INJURED
IN A TRAIN WRECK
COMMODORE J. C, WATSON, INJURED IN A TRAIN ACCIDENT
(~\ ACRAMENTO, Oct. 7.â Commodore J. C. "Watson Buffered injuries in a
\ train accident near Colfax this afternoon, and this evening when tHe
w) commodore reached Sacramento his head was in bandages and his
clothes were stained -with blood.
The westbound overland passenger train was passing the vicinity of Cape
Horn, about a mile east of Colfax, when for some reason not explained, the
two end cars broke from the train. One of these cars, the first, was a pri
vate coach occupied by Commodore Watson and his suite, en route to the
Mare Island Naval fetation. The next and last car was a Pullman sleeper
containing a number of passengers. The commodore's car was thrown with
great violence against a rocky bank and the shock threw the occupants of
the car out of their seats.
Commodore Watson was found to have suffered a scalp wound three
inches in length, from which the blood dripped freely. Nobody else in the
car was injured and the occupants of the sleeper also escaped without
bruises. Orders were given to transfer the commodore and party and the
Bleeper passengers to the cars remaining on the track, and the train minus
the two derailed cars continued on to Sacramento, arriving several hours
late. *
A wrecking crew was dispatched to the scene and is now at worK replac
ing the cars on the track. This may take all night, and it was stated here
to-night that the eastbound overland leaving Sacramento at 10 o'clock
would be detained at Colfax twelve hours.
Commodore Watson, when he reached Sacramento, was able to receive
and send telegrams, and despite his bandaged head and blood-splashed gar
ments, appeared in good spirits.
PORT COSTA, Oct. 7.â Commodore Watson and party left the train here,
and were conveyed to Mare Island on the Government tug Unadilla. The
commodore will formally take command of the navy yard to-morrow.
Sheehan is engaged in conversation with several Indians, while a number
of bucks who have just left the house are hastening to join their disaffeoted
comrades in the thick timber. The troops are just returning from an
excursion around the peninsula, and one party has stacked arms, pre
paratory to unloading their stuff from the boats. The hostile Indians were
in the heavy timber in the background.
ENGLAND SEIZES
MANY ISLANDS
IN THE PACIFIC
Cruisers Goldfinch and Mohawk
Conclude a Wholesale
Annexation Raid,
Head-Hunters of Rendova Capture a Village
and Feast Upon the Bodies of Its
Inhabitants.
VICTORIA, B. C, Oct. 7.â The steam
ship Warimoo, which reached port this
evening after a smart passage from
Australasia and Honolulu, has news
that H. M. S. Goldfinch has lately an
nexed the Duff group of islands, and
several others of the Pacific group, in
the name of Great Britain. The seiz
ure of these islands, particularly the
Duff, Cherry and Mitre Islands, is con
sidered significant.
The British warship Mohawk also
seized a number of Islands, the British
flag being planted by her officers on the
Santa Cruz Islands, the Reef Islands
and the Swallow group. In her trip to
the latter islands she ran on a reef and
was considerably damaged.
From the particulars given by the
officers of the Mohawk, it seems that
the Duff group numbers eleven islands,
all thickly inhabited by copper-colored
natives. The islands are densely wood
ed and of great fertility. Mitre Island
is uninhabited, but Cherry Island has
between 500 and 600 natives on it, the
same race as the Tocuplans. The whole
of the recent annexations have been
placed under the control of Mr. C. M.
Woodford, the British resident in the
Solomon group.
Among the islands over which a pro
tectorate has thus been declared was
Vanikoro, celebrated as the place where
the ill-fated ships of the French ad
miral. La Perouse, were destroyed.
Upon another of the islands of the
Santa Cruz group, seized by the Mo
hawk, Bishop Patterson was murdered.
At the island of Utupa in the Santa
Cruz groun the Mohawk found a na
tive of New Hebrides, the sole survivor
of the crew of the New Hebrides cut
ter Two white men and one native
had been murdered by the natives
about ten days previous to the Mo
hawk's visit, and the cutter had been
burned.
From New Caledonia comes the news
of the escape of a number of French
prisoners. The schooner Laura was
stolen by four ticket-of-leave men and
they hid it in a secluded anchorage
and at nightfall about eighteen es
caped from the penal settlement, were
taken aboard and the schooner sailed,
it is thought, for Australia. The cutter
was, it is said, well provisioned. The
authorities at New Caledonia organized
a search party and left in pursuit of
the prisoners in a small cutter. The po
lice at New Zealand and Australian
ports have been warned to be on the
lookout for the schooner.
The head hunters, a cannibal faction
of the natives of Rendova, have of late
been extremely active in the prosecu
tion of their horrible custom, and a
terrible atrocity was committed by
them on the western portion of the pro
tectorate. They captured a village,
and, after slaughtering many inhabit
ants, returned home with thirty pris
oners. These thirty were killed and
eaten at a barbaric feast given by
the head hunters in honor of their vic
tory. One of the most notorious of the
head-hunting chiefs has since been
captured by the British and is in cus
tody at the Government station at Tu
lagi. He will be given a trial for mur
der and in all probability hanged
**pour encouragez les autres."
The native rising at Espiritu Santu,
according to reports brought to Nou
mea by the British warship Meldura,
has been quelled.
The island of Motuiti, or Kennedy
Island, which has appeared on the
charts since the beginning or the cen
tury, was searched for in vain .by
the steamer Mohawk when she seized
the Santa Cruz Islands. No island ex
ists anywhere near the position assign
ed and it is thought that that island,
like Falcon Island, also has sunk be
neath the waves.

SANTIAGO DE CUBA. Oct. 7.â General
Lawton, who has been ill for the last few
days and unable to attend to business,
has applied for three months' leave of
absence from his duties. The fatigues of
the campaign and arduous work since he
succeeded General Shafter have weakened
his health, making it compulsory for him
to take a holiday. General Wood will
succeed him for the present.

GENERAL BACON AT WALKER
RETURNS FROM THE SCENE OP
THE FIGHTING.
Reports That His Command Was Not
in Danger of Massacre and
Did Not Need Rein
forcements. \
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 7.â Reports re
ceived by the officials of the War and
the Interior departments from the In
dian outbreak are of a reassuring char
acter to-night, and they now feel that
the uprising may be regarded as over.
General Bacon, who has charge of
affairs in the department of which he
is in command, will remain at Walker
for the present and this, it is hoped, will
have a quieting effect on the citizens of
the surrounding country who have felt
that they were in danger from the red
skins.
General Corbin said to-night there
was no basis for the report that two
troops of cavalry on their way to
Huntsville, Ala., from North Dakota,
had been ordered to Walker, General
Bacon's telegram showing he was not
in need of reinforcements. The follow
ing is General Bacon's latest dispatch:
WALKER. Minn, (via Brain- -
erd), Oct. 7.â Arrived here at -
noon with my detachment in -
good condition. The killed and -
badly wounded were shipped to -
Fort Snelling this morning. The â 
Indians have been badly whipped â 
and left the country adjacent to -
the fight. En route here, other -
Chippewa bands displayed white -
flags along the lake shore. Much -
talk here of general Indian out- â¢
break. Will ascertain facts and
report later. Find Colonel Har
bach at this place with 200 men,
Third Infantry. Will remain my
self and keep troops here await
ing developments.
Regret exaggerated reports
published, resulting from my in
ability to communicate. Have
been in no danger of massacre
and need no reinforcements.
Colonel Harbach's coming was in
good time in sending out boats.
The following reassuring dispatch
was received to-night by Commissioner
Jones from Gue-Bel-Cu, a well-known
Chippewa Indian, who has transacted
considerable business for that band in
Washington:
WALKER, Minn., Oct. 7.â Not
more than twenty-five or thirty
Indians engaged in the outbreak.
Chief Gaywuche Waybinung and
Macheguh Bow, both of Bear Is
land, and Wahbununnee. of
Leech Lake village, are doing
all in their power to suppress the
outbreak. Chief Flatmouth ar
rived at Leech Lake village to
day with a large number of fol
lowers, and is strongly opposing
the outbreak. Indians are com
ing into Leech Lake rapidly and
are registering their names in
the overseer's office with the in
tention of remaining at the vil
lage until the trouble has sub
sided. White Earth, Red Lake
and Mille Lac Indians are not
affected. Think there will be no
general uprising.
SETTLERS YET NERVOUS.
ST. PAUL, Minn., Oct. 7.â Opinions
differ as to the present status of the
troubles with the Leech Lake Indians,
but even though nothing more follows
enough has happened to cause North
western settlers to feel somewhat un
settled In their homes for some time to
come. There is something of a panic
in most of the small settlements near
Walker, it being the center of the Leech
Lake district, and the men in the lum
ber camps in that vicinity have quit
work and are either in or on their way
to Walker. The teachers in the Indian
schools and others about the agency
have also thought it well to change
their location for the present. There
have been some sensational stories
from that region to-day, but they do
not seem to be well founded. There was
certainly no battle to-day, because the
troops are all known to be in Walker,
resting after their hard experiences.
General Bacon returned from Bear
Island on the mainland, or near there,
where Wednesday night's fight oc
cured to Walker to-day, bringing
with 'him all the first detachment of
troops, the dead and wounded having
been sent in first and brought down to
Fort Snelling this evening. There was
no difficulty in embarking the men at
Sugar Point, and General Bacon reports
officially that the trouble is about over,
as he has whipped the Indians badly
Governor Clough will send a battery
of artillery of the National Guard to
Cass Lake in the morning to protect
the residents of that locality.
! DESERVE MEDALS OF HONOB.
WALKER. Minn., Oct. 7.â The battle
of Leech Lake has developed more than
one hero.
General Bacon, Major Wilkinson,
Lieutenant Ross, Surgeon Harris, Hos
pital Steward Burkhart, Sergeant But

are all deserving of medals of honor,
the first three named for the gallant
manner in which they led the troops,

PRINCESS KAUILANI
CRUELLY MALIGNED
The Examiner's Story of h\er "True
Love" Stamped as False and
Malicious.
BY HORACE WRIGHT.
HONOLULU, Sept. 29, via Victoria, B. C. Oct. 7.â Hon. A. S. Cleg
horn and Princess Kauilani are very anxious that The Call should
contradict the absolutely false and cruelly malicious mis-statements
of the Examiner in its issue of September 10 in an article headed
"Princess Kauilani's True Love." There is no foundation for the
statements made and they have been read with profound pain by all
who are acquainted with the personages- referred to. Mr. Adams is
an estimable young man who was for a considerable period on the
editorial staff of the Advertiser, but his relations with Mr. Cleghorn's
family were never as intimate as the Examiner correspondent states.
The delicate position in which the Princess is placed politically na
turally renders her extremely sensitive to such malicious and un
truthful stories. Her relations, too, with the members of the Ha
waiian Commission were most cordial and not otherwise as suggested
by the article in question.
the sixth for bravery displayed on sev
eral occasions.
Briggs is a barber of Walker and
was sworn in as a deputy sheriff be
cause he wanted to accompany the
3. When the Indian sharpshooters
were tiring upon every one who showed
above the ground, Briggs went to the
beach and carried supplies to the block
house. He also volunteered to go to
the Flora in a canoe and was allowed
General Bacon who re
marked as he gave his consent:
'â¢You have lots of nerve, young man,
and are taking your life in your
hands."
Colonel Rheehan's gallantry is re
markable because the coionel was there,
not in a military capacity, but as a
deputy marshal, and his work had been
accomplished. He and Briggs will be
mentioned in General Bacon's official
report, and Steward Burkhart will be
recommended for a medal of honor.
BACON'S OFFICIAL REPORTS.

that the last dispatch probably means
that General Bacon will return with his

Chief Bu-Go-Nay-Ka-Shig. He says
they are completely whipped Indians.
The name of this Indian is apparent
ly intended for Bug-Att-Mah-Ge-Shig,
who was the cause of the whole trouble,
other Indiana having taken him by
force from the deputy marshals, who
were taking him to Duluth as a wit
ness in an illegal llquor-selliner case.
PILLAGERS A FIGHTING RACE.
The Pillager Indians â called in their
own language Mukundwa, meaning
"Takers"â are quite distinct as a tribe
from the Chippewas and other Indians
on the adjacent reservations, though
all of them belonged to the great Al
i gonquin nation, which occupied the
j northern part of the United States and
[ Upper Canada. They were among the
rs in the Western migratory
movement of the various tribes of that
race about the middle of the seven
teenth century, which was occasioned
by the French and English encroach
ments from the Atlantic coast. They
came into the Leech Lake country
from Fond dv Lac, and, driving out the
Sacs and Foxes and Sioux Indians who
preceded them and with whom they
had several fierce battles, settled down
on the mainland and islands about the
southern and eastern sides of the lake,
where they have since remained.
"With the settlement of Minnesota
I lands by the white men and the as
signment of reservations to other
tribes, the limits of a reservation for
the Pillagers were also fixed by the
Government officials, though not under
any treaty stipulations, as was the
case with the other tribes. This ab
sence of guarantee of any rights and
privileges to these Indians has been the
primary cause of the trouble with
them.

SELL HIS PAPER
Deal for the Mercury
Pending.
SYNDICATE MAKES AN OFFER
SAN JOSE EDITOR TO RETIRE TO
PRIVATE LIFE.
Denies That the Suits Recently In
stituted Are Responsible for
the Proposed Change
of Ownership.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 7.â The sale of the
San Jose Mercury is now pending and
in all probability will be consummated
shortly after election. Charles M.
Shortridge, who has conducted the
paper for the past fourteen years, will
retire to private life. This is the sub
stance of a statement made by Mr.
Shortridge to-night.
Mr. Shortridge stated that he had had
| several offers for the Mercury lately
and that he was certain the paper
would be sold after the November elec
tion. He said a syndicate headed by
C. M. Wooster had an option on the
paper for sixty days. He refused to
state just what price was agreed upon,
but said it was upward of $100,000.
The syndicate, he said, was com
posed of both local and San Francisco
capitalists, about equally divided. Any
how possession would not be given for
I at least sixty days. The Mercury would
j remain a Republican paper.
Mr. Shortridge said that the suits re
cently brought against him for about
$50,000 had nothing to do with the sale.
j The stock pledged to W. A. Nevills and
! Joseph Britton was more than ampli
security for money borrowed, a,.d ne
could still retain possession of the
paper if he wished. He denied that W.
EL Mills had made an offer in the inter
| est of the Southern Pacific Railroad.
j The only offer being considered waa
| that of the Wooster combination.
For some time there has been talk
on the streets that the Mercury was
financially embarrassed. The suits
| filed by W. A. Nevills for $23,000 and
j Joseph Britton for $25,000 served to
j bear out the statement, and it is said
j that during the past few days local
j creditors have been very anxious and
| pressing.
Knowing ones claim the paper's mi
i debtedness amounts to nearly $100,000.
i Over $30,000 of this is held by the
Union Savings Bank, and the Commer
; cial and Savings Bank has some $8000
of Mercury paper in its vault. Paper
| houses and type-founders also are said
j to be among the creditors.
The paper is a splendid naying prop
erty, and Mr. Shortridge claims its net
earnings for the past five years have
averaged over $15,000 annually. Up to
within thelast few years the Mercury
has been very influential, but of late
' it has been the recognized organ of the
i "srang" and lost much prestige. Its
1 policy to print only the news that suits
the "gang" has been its ruination.
It is believed the price asked by Mr.

It Is the Californians who have cap
tured Manila. That fact is pretty
plainly apparent from the foregoing
list of the offices the boys of the First
have secured. Why, if the Seventh had
ever got here there would not have
been enough to go around. Seriously
speaking the fact that the First Regi
ment should have been called upon to
furinsh men for these places In the
civil administration of the government
here is the highest possible praise for
the general efficiency of the regiment.
Every general officer who has came in
contact with the Californians on this
expedition has learned to apreciate the
mettle of the boys. The last order
issued by General Merritt before his
departure for Paris, as follows, shows
how they were regarded by him:
OFFICE OF THE MILITARY COVER
NOR AND HEADQUARTERS DE
PARTMENT OF THE PACIHC.
MANILA, August 30, 1898.
Colonel James F. Smith United States
Volunteers, Commanding Firsj California
Volunteer Infantry-Sir: On the eve ot
mv departure I desire to express to you
and your regiment my great appen.-na
tion of the way in which I have been
supported by all the troops of my com
mand. The cheerful fortitude with which
all the officers and soldiers of the Eighth
Corps present endured the hardships or
the campaign and their gallantry in ac
tion is a matter of great pride to me, and
I thank your regiment and yourself for
your most valuable Bervlcea. VÂ«y re
spectfully, Vt â¢ MbRKIII,
Major General United States Army.
I do not know for the life of me why
there should have been a prejudice
against the Californians from the start,
but there was. The regiment was obe
dient, tractable, well drilled. Its officers
were competent and soldierly. It obeyed
every order, even some orders that were
unreasonable, without complaint. It
showed, when the time came, that it
could fight. General Anderson did riot
like the Californians, was only mildly
prejudiced, however, and he was won
by soldierly attention to duty. General
Greene did not like the Califurnians.
was in fact, strongly prejudiced. He
was won by attention to duty, by will
ingness to do without complaining
what no white man should be called
upon to do in this climate, by superb
fighting qualities displayed on that
awful night of the 31st of July. Lastly,
General Merritt was prejudiced against
the First. The gallant charge of the
Second Battalion down the Calle Real
and up to the walls of old Manila car
ried the old soldier's heart. Now the
First California is the pride and joy
of the army. If there are any more
places going the First will be in line
for them.
There has been a lot of speculation as
to whether General Merritt will returp
from Paris to Manila. I do not think
myself that he will. He is an old man.
and long trips must be trying to him.
In this connection, the report of Colo
nel Jewett upon the ability of the Fili
pinos to govern themselves, made to
Merritt just prior to his departure,
should prove interesting at this time.
The substance of the report was as fol
lows :
"It is potent the Tagallo Is In no con
dition to govern himself or his nation
at the present time. It would be wrong
to turn the Philippines over to the Gov
ernment of Spain, as Spain has shown
incompetence in this direction in the
past, and is to-day in worse condition
than ever to accomplish any good."
Colonel Jewett does not see any pres
ent way out of the difficulty. Perhaps
the Filipinos, the better of them, will
show him a way outâ after they have
shaken themselves free of leaders who,
like Aguinaldo and his kind, use the
worst impulses of their countrymen to
further their own evil purposes.
The boys of the First Regiment are
busily preparing for a great celebration
of the 9th of September. It will be held
in the palace occupied by the Second
Battalion in all probability, as the place
best adapted for the purpose and will
be calculated to make up in enthusiasm
what the Native Sons of the Golden
West lack in numbers so far away from
home.
They were dredging the Paslg River
to-day back of the palace where I am
quarteredâ for lam back in the Palace
of Malakanan. It was the strangest
sight I have seen here yet â and it has
been a land of strange sights. Six
natives in a dug-out canoe sixty feet
long, which they call a barca, had long
poles, to the ends of which were fas
tened large baskets. One man would
lower the basket to the bottom of the
river, perhaps eight feet, while an
other, diving from the boat to the bot
tom, scraped it full of soft mud, when
the diver would come up simultaneously
with the rising of the basket. Fancy
how much slickens would be cleaned
out of San Francisco Bay in a year if
the Tagallo method was followed? The
men 1 saw were dredging all day and
the boat at dark was not half filled
with mud.
I cabled you the other day that
Aguinaldo, with the consent of General
Merritt, given somewhat reluctantly,
had sent an envoy to the Paris con
ference. I do not suppose even Aguin
aldo supposes General Merritt can give
the Tagallo envoy standing there, and
I know perfectly well General Merritt
knows .he cannot. It Is merely the last
spectacular play in what most intelli
gent persons hereabouts realize Is a
lost cause. The dream of liberty for the
Filipinos, even of liberty with the pro
tectiori of the Americans, is a dream
that is dreamed. Aguinaldo, it is true,
still insists that he will have that
which he craves, or he will have noth- I
ing. Yet, bar a few Englishmen who
should know better, nobody takes much
stock in Aguinaldo. The Englishmen
who do would not, perhaps, if they had
not suffered from the depredations,
during the siege of Manila, from the
savages of a nearer and more offensive
type of the Tagallo. The Tagallo, it
should be premised, is pretty much all
of one type. He varies merely as the
square of his distance from the ob
server lessens or grows greater. Seen
from the United States he is a fine,
manly fellow, fighting a hopeless bat
tle against the aggregated wrongs of
centuries. Seen closer, in peace as at
the island of Guam, where he is known
as the Chimarro, he is a good-natured,
If somewhat dirty and leprous, individ
ual, who gives you green cocoanuts or I
sells you sucking-pigs, with equal,
abandon. At his home, here in the
Philippines, he is a devil, pure and
simple. He is a liar, and the truth is
not in him. He is true to no cause and
no leader. He is, in short, a good
natured, murderous, music-loving, ly
ing, indolent, thieving, burly, leprous,
lazy, hard-working, puny, muscular
scoundrel, who makes a good servant
so long as he is rewarded with kicks
and cuffs, but who grows "hot in. the
head" and runs amuck just as soon as
he waxes fat under the generosity of
what we, in America, call decent treat
ment. He is, in a word, an Asiatic.
Treat him as an equal, and he is sure
you are afraid of him. Treat him as an
inferior, as he is accustomed to be
treated, and he will serve you well.
Treat him as a brute, as he treats the
poor little ponies that fetch and carry
for him, and he will defy you for a
few generations, when, as he has
found out in^the case of the Spaniards,
he will one day discover his idol is
made of clay, and will turn and rend
you.
The Tagallo can read and write and
has taught himself to read and write.
iHe has just the little learning that is
a dangerous thing. He lacks, neverthe
less, the cohesiveness which welds in
dividuals into the state â the power to
bear and forbear for the common good.
And he cannot understand to this day
why the Americans, having won Ma
nila, do not loot the city and put all
Spanish prisoners to the sword. With
all due respect to their intelligence it
must be said that some of our Spanish
prisoners exhibited the same wonder
rather plainly up to a day or two, I
though they are beginning to know us I
better now and to come out from the
walled city with their wives and their
choice possessions and to resume the
manner of life which obtained before
the siege.
Just now there are two leaders who
are giving the rebel chieftains a lot of
trouble. These are General Pio Pilar,
who commands the district up about
San Pedro Macate, near where the bat
tle was fought which won Manila to
the Americans, and a Chinese leader,
called Pu Ah, the theater of whose
operations is on the north side of the
city in the Malabon district, into which
region Aguinaldo proposes presently to
remove his camp. Whether he will be
a match for the Chinese leader, who
has never acknowledged his leadership,
if it comes to a duel between them, re
mains to be seen. Aguinaldo is not an
educated man, is not a great soldier
d( spite his experience in guerrilla war
fare against the Spaniards and upon
the two occasions when I saw him did
not impress me as of particularly
strong character. The Chinese I have
never seen, but he must be a man ot
marked strength to have attained any
degree of influence with the people,
who look upon a Chinaman as just one
degree lower than a dog.
Besides these two there are a score
or more lesser leaders, each fancying
himself the center around which the j
Filipino world turns, all more or less
engaged in the business of plunder in j
a small way and all more or less Inimi
cal to Agulnaldo's dreams of a Filipino
republic with himself at its head.
All this adds strength to a movement
of which I heard to-night for the first j
time. This movement, fathered by the
more intelligent and wealthy of the
Tagallosâ for some of them are intelli
gent and some are wealthy â sympa
thized in by the mestizoes, or half
breeds, and likely to be pushed on by
the English here as promising the best
solution of the Philippine problem, is
entirely in* the interest of the restora- j
tion of prosperity to the land and the
securing of that stability of govern
ment without which there can be no
permanent prosperity. The movement,
In a word, will take the form of a pop
ular request for the annexation of the
islands to the United States. It will
leave Aguinaldo's envoy to Paris hang
ing in the air rather. It will leave
Aguinaldo himself hanging in the air â
if, indeed, he does not meet the just
reward of his deeds and do that in
sober earnest to which I have alluded
heretofore only in a metaphorical sense.
Aguinaldo certainly cannot have his
republic if the movement for annexa
tion succeeds. There is room for only
one republic under the Stars and
Stripes.

QUESTIONS OF
GREAT INTEREST
TO HAWAIIANS
Costly Improvements
Proposed.
CAN MONEY BE BORROWED?
DOLE'S ADMINISTRATION AL
READY $600,000 IN DEBT.
Changes in the Executive Depart
ment Caused by the Resigna
tion of Auditor Gen
eral Lawes.
BY HORACE WRIGHT.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, Sept. 28.â The United
States steamship Bennington, E. D.
Taussig commander, arrived In port at
8:30 yesterda-'- morning with all well on
board.
Since the Hawaiian Commission left
last week matters of official interest
have been wondrously tame and in
sipid. There is, however, a tendency
to brighten up inasmuch as three in
cidents have occurred which have set
political tongues wagging and editorial
quills a-driving. The first was the re
signation of the Auditor General, John
Lawes, who resigns to accept the im
portant position vacated by the death
of Theodore C. Porter, ex-minister of
finance, in the bank of Claus Spreckels
& Co. Mr. ; Lawes is to be succeeded
on the first prox. by Mr. H. C. Austin,
Tax Assessor of the island of Hawaii,
; one of the firmest adherents of the
"family compact" ring. He has been a
faithful and capable public servant of
the Government for many years, and
his friends and the Government claim
that the appointment is based on the
true lines of civil service reform and
the possession of the requisite qualifi
cations, and not for political purposes.
The executive officials so well preserved
their secrets in regard to the change
that they have again given bitter of
fense to the Sewall wing of our so
called Republicans, who v once again
have been left out in the cold just at
the very time when they wanted the
warmth of an influential Government
position.
The next incident, of a very embar
rassing nature for the Government, has
been brought about by an oversight of
Minister Cooper, the ex-Premier, Min
ister of Foreign Affairs and the Minis
ter of Public Instruction. It was in
tended that the Legislature should ap
propriate $10,000 for the removal of thÂ»
Boys' Reformatory School to -Nawili
wili, Kauai, and the Minister and the
Cabinet took it as accepted that due
provision had been made as intended.
Consequently the Minister rushes off to
Kauai, heads off a competing purchaser
and buys the property and enters into
a number of arrangements for carry
ing out his pet hobby, and returns with
banners flying and trumpets sounding
only to discover that the aforesaid ap T
propnation had been killed in confer
ence committee and could not be found
in the appropriation bill, or anywhere
else. It is now seriously proposed to
insert that special appropriation, by
hook or by crook, by means of affidavits
from legislators that the item was in
serted in the bill, or if not it should
have been, which amounts to the same
thing in their opinion. Another prop
osition is to induce the Cabinet to plead
with the Council of State to pass an
emergency appropriation, possibly on
the grounds that the school- will pre
vent war, plague and pestilence, but
then there are tho%; who claim that
Mr.' Newlands effectively killed that
august and convenient body that voted
Mr Dole $10,000 with which to travel
to Washington. Mr. Cooper is good
natured at times, but just now there is
too much laughter at his own expense
to induce him to be particularly merry
himself. People are ungenerously re
calling other matters which did not re
sult as planned by him and his cinder
path of fame is being studiously
studded with tire-penetrating tacks.
The third question that has just been
brought to public discussion is really of
considerable importance to us in con
nection with our public improvements.
It is the question, Has the Government
the power to raise $300,000 for Internal
improvements by way of Hawaiian
bonds? If they have not the power,
then much needed and revenue-produc
ing improvements must be deterred,
for we are about $600,000 in debt beyond
the four millions we have handed over
to the continental branch of our do
mestic economy.
The Government, through the mouth
of the Attorney General, feels inclined
to hold that they are thoroughly Justi
fied in carrying out the projected works
with borrowed money, especially as un
der the ruling of the State Department
the Government of Hawaii continued
its titles and powers until Congress
should provide a new system of gov
j ernment, and, furthermore, that the
I works contemplated will materially add
|to the increase of the revenue. The
obstinate ones, however, hold to the
theory that we have no security to of
fer to Investors inasmuch as all the
right, title and interest to our estates i
I have been vested in the United States. i
The plans are being discussed this
week for three or more plantations and
the wonder-is, where are all the neces
sary laborers to come from? Certain
ly we have already had nearly 700 new
Japanese this month, and the Aztec is
almost hourly due with another batch
equally large, but they, and more, are
required for immediate necessities,
while the new plantations will' require
for themselves within the next two
years several thousands:
On Saturday next Hon. S. M. Damon,
Minister of Finance, will entertain the
whole community in ""â  honor of the
United States army and navy at his
country residence at Moanalua, a few
miles down the railroad in the direction
of Pearl City. : It will be the most am
bitious . garden party ever ; essayed â ; in
this country, and will ; require ' a . large
number of special trains to convey the
guests.
General King is making himself very
popular with the National : Guard of
Hawaii and encouraging them with the
hope that they may be eventually the
supports of the artillery, post ; to be es
tablished.

COMBINE TO BREAK
THE LABOR CONTRACTS
HONOLULU, Sept. 28.âThere Is a
j movement on foot to get the Chinese
contract laborers on this Island to enter
j , combination having for Its bb
" , , . Â«. , . , .
j J*ct the breaking of their present labor
! contracts. The scheme Includes the as
j sessment of such Chinese as are will
i ing to enter Into the compact $2 each,
; and the fund thus created is to be used
to pay certain attorneys, who in re
turn agree to use their best efforts to
procure a decision by which Chinese will
be released from the fulfillment of their
contracts. It is set forth by those who
are engineering the scheme that the
present contract labor laws are at vari
ance with the constitution of the United
States and that a final decision to that
effect can be obtained by taking a test
case to the Supreme Court at Washing
ton. As this is a process that will take
both time and money It is proposed to
assess all the Chinese interested $2 each
and thus raise about $10,000.
LILIUOKALANI WILL
PRESS HER CLAIMS
HONOLULU, Sept. 28.â 1t is learned
on good authority that ex-Queen Llli
uokalani will leave for Washington
about the middle of November to press
her claims against Congress for re
muneration for the loss of her throne
and the revenue from the crown lands,
for which she feels that the people of
the United States owe her some pecu
niary compensation.
Upon being questioned on the sub
ject J. O. Carter said: "The ex-Queen
has not mentioned the matter to me of
late. At the time of her return to the
islands she was quoted as saying that
she intended to return to Washington
in November and I believe we had some
talk about it. But nothing was de
cided then and as far as I know noth
ing is settled now. I know she will
not leave for some weeks on account
of some business matters in which I
am assisting her. What her plans are
concerning her trip to Washington she
has not mentioned to me yet, but of
course she may go."

Blatantly Describes How He Main=

Desperate Efforts Made to take the Sting of Slander
From the Charges He Made Against
Ex=Councilman Jarman.
PAN* J'">?E. Oct. 7.â Jim Rea's pres
ence we the witness stand to-day added
Interest a hundred fold* to the Jarman-
Uea slander suit.
Judge Kittredges court was packed
-ins and others anxious to
hoar about the inside workings or gang
politics.
Rea v.as a willing witness and when
kJ his story ran on unceasingly.
He confessed to dabbling in city affairs
and tuld of bargains and agreements
he had made with the liquor in
the A. P. A. and church people in
der to carry electioi
He lost no opportunity to blacken the
characters of ex-Councilmen Dittus
and Kreig and to protect Fay and
ing, who were the former's colleagues.
About 2:30 o'clock
neys got through questioning Mr. Rea'
and he was turned over to Mr. Delmas
for ' cross-examination. This had just
begun when shortly after 3 o'clock an
adjournment was taken until Tuesday
morning. Before Rea gets oft' the stand
some further sensational statements
are looked for.
Rea was the first and only witness.
He said that while passing Mrs. Knox-
Goodrich's piace on North First street,
near the Southern Pacific Railroad
- ng, he met Jarman, the plaintiff,
superintending the painting of a fence.
;;tinued as follows:
I tipped my hat to Mrs. Goodrich and
said. "Good morning. Mr. Jarman," and
or.. Mr. Jarman came up behind
Lftar I had passed 10 or 15 yards
and I heard him accost me very excited
ly, ar.d I turned around and he said a
great many things, but among them that
1 had been lying about him and that I
had to take it back. I repiled that if I
had said anything about him which was
:rue, I was ready and willing
to make a correction, but that it was
always my purpose to state the truth and
nothing else. He said that I had told
Archi-r McDonald and Tom Montgomery
th;.t he had received $900 on the purchase
ot the steam roller. I told him 1 did
rot state to Archie McDonald or Tom
meiy or to any other human being
that he had received $900 or any other
sum for his vote on the purchase of the
steam roller, but that if he wanted to
know what I did state I would tell
him, and so I proceeded to teli him, which
took some little times. I told him what
I had said to my friends as an explana
tion why he and I were not working to-
f ether, that was the idea; why we had
ivided politically. I mentioned the â¢
cil episode In which the policemen were
to be elected and also other little mat
ters that were displeasing to me, among
therr. the Rinehart matter.
1 to him that I said to these people !
time of his nomination that there
were f-'ements in this city which were ,
antagonistic and had kept the city of San j
â  and occasioned derision, there (
was the Light and Power and the Electric
Improvement controversy, and also what !
was known as the liauor interest, the !
church people, the A. P. A., who were
against the people who be
longed to the Roman Catholic church, !
:.at I had met with committees from |
the old soldiers or battlefield veterans, the
A. P. A. and the church people and we
had agreed upon a policy which In my
opinion would win the- campaign. It was .
to be a Republican policy to carry out !
the following idea and principles: That I
urch people were to have a resi
dence â  saloons would not
be granted a lie-
Witness said he then in conversation
with Jarman referred to the circum
stances of hi? nomination and election
and the agreement made and the vio
lation of that agreement. He continued:
I said to him that instead of staying with
the Republicans and the policy "oir
he went off with Mr

favorable report on the purchase of the
roller, and that he (.Jarmuni. of course,
had supported the roller. That is, he ad
vocated it, Â»r.d that 1 thought an explana
tion from him was due as to what became
| of this money and where it went.
He said to me: "You know 1 didn't get
! any â <( it."
I said, "I don't know anything of the
kind."
He said, "Do you know Mr. Fay and
I Nolting got some of it and Mr. McKen
; zie?"
I said, "I don't know anything of the
kind."
He said, "You know I didn't." '-'^
I said. "If you want to know what I
think, not what I know, 1 will tell you."
He said. "Well, what do you think?"
. And I ' ald Â« "* think you got $450 of
it. During all of this conversation, how

and was using numerous ephithets to me
and as I. thought, was tryingâ"
By Mr. Delmasâ Never mind what you
thought. J
By the courtâ Just the conversation, Mr.
Rea.
Reaâ l thought I would like to hit him
here, you see he riled me up to it What
I meant to say was, that we had both be
come very much interested in the dis
cussion. He was very much excited and
abusive and said a great many things.
Everything he could iay his tongue to.
He said 1 was in with a band or thieves
who were looters of the public treasury
that I was a disgrace to the city, mv fam
ily and myself and everything else. He
said everything and when I told him I
thought he had got $450, why he said that
he would thrash me. -I said "Mr Jar
an a >"b'dd>"" are a cripple and >' ou can-t whl P
He said, -Then I will shoot you "
I said. "Don't get excited, you are
crazy.
Then he said that I was a coward and
he would challenge me to a duel.
I said. "Well, go and get a couple of
pistols or a pistol and take a couple of
shots ;> then hand them over to me if you
miss. At that time some one came alone
ana took me away.
Attorney Morehouseâ at that time,
-Mr. Rea. did you use these words: "There
was $SfO paid on the purchase of the
steam roller to some of the Councilman
and you got $400 of it?"
Reaâ sir. I did not. .
. "-; ow ' a t the time you told Mr. Jarman
that you thought he got $450 of it how aid
you mean that he received $450?"
!â J V s i.f ave him mv thoughtâ my opin
ion. I did not say that he received if I
simply said I thought he did."
"Did you in this conversation with Mr.
Jarman tell the source sV your belief?"
"I did."
"What did you say to â  him was tne
source of your information?"
"The gentleman who sold the roller to
the city."
"What did you tell him, in that conver
sation, the gentleman who sold the roller
told you?"
"That he had exhausted the commission,
wnich was $750, in securing a favorable re
port upon the purchase of the roller."
"Was that all you told him?"
"That he had informed me where a part
of the money went and that he also in
formed me where a part of It did not co."
"Did you tell him, in this conversation,
where he told you a part of the money
had gone?"
"Yes, sir."
"What did you say to him?"
"I said that he told me that his com
bine then remaining in the Council had
received $200."
"Whose combine?"
"Mr. Jarman's."
"Did you give the names of those per
sons to Mr. Jarman?"
"I did."
"Who were they?"
"I told him it went through Mr. Kreig.
He is the one the gentleman told me it
went through, and Mr. Dittus. Mr. Dittus
had nothing to do with it directly, as I
understood It. He was in the combine. I
said: 'Mr. Jarman, he told me your com
bine, through Mr. Kreig, had received
$300.' "
"Did you tell him anything else at that
time that this man had told you."
"I told him that he had offered me the
roiler for $3000â for $2750, as a matter of
fact."
"Who were in the Common Council at
the time of this conversation with Mr.
Maggard?"
(Majrgard was the agent for the steam
manufacturers.)
"Fay and Nolting and Dittus and Krelg
Mr. Koch. I had two conversations
with Mr. Maggard. "
ite what the whole conversation
[r. Jarman was."
"He accused Fay and Nolting in coun
ter-accusations. He said we were all a
band that Fay and Nolting eot
that propositionâ a hundred dol
lars apieceâ and that I wanted a steam
f. And I said: 'For argument
sake. v. â¢ will admit it; but explain why
you were so anxious to involve the city
still deeper in debt when its treasury was
already depleted, to buy a steam roller
to roll my rock with?" "
"Now, In this conversation he referred
to something that you were supposed to
have said to Mr. Montgomery and Mr.
McDonald?"
"Yi-s. sir."
"Will you state what conversation you j
had. where you had it and under what i
circumstances you had It with Mr. Mont
gomery and Mr. McDonald?"
"I was a director of the Hotel Vendome
and met with these directors on nearly
every meeting night. They were all my
personal friends and some of them my
political friends. We had finished the
business of the meetings and were dis- I
cussing different topics. The discussion' i
was about the new charter ticket and the J
opposition ticket or the opposition to It. :
The question was propounded to me by â 
Mr. Montgomery. 'Why are you fighting
Mr. Jarman? We were alweys friends in j
business and otherwise, and you and he l
were great friends, and you were with i
him when he ran for the Council, and
why are you against him?' And I said ;
that 1 thought he was crooked; that I:
lost faith in him and his sincerity; that !
he was posing for an element In the com
munity which was setting itself up as |
the embodiment of all that was pure and I
accusing those in opposition to them with,
everything that was vile and corrupt; '
that while there were worse men than :
Mr Jarman. I had nothing against him i
personally, yet I did not think he was !
entitled to occupy the position that he *
was trying to occupy in politics and the
public, to my mind; that the new charter
Itself had provided for any contracts that
were let for over $100. and that Mr. Jar- i
man had with Mr. Dlttus and Krelg
painted certain engine-houses in town,
and his bill was cut in pieces so as to
come within ; the $100 limit. I did not i
think that that was In harmony with my '
ideas of a Councilman . that was repre- {
sented as he was. I stated that originally I
Mr Jarman and myself were friends; j
that the committees of the different or- !
ganizations that I had spoken of had con
ferred with me and that I had agreed to .
Join with them with my Influence and :
support upon the following policy: That
the liberal element of the community
there had been a fight between the i
church and the whisky element, as It is ;
commonly knownâ that I was in with the
church people and the A. P. A.'s upon the
following policy; that I had organized or j
helped to organize at that time these ele- j
ments upon what- I conceived ' to be the
right' principles, which would remedy in }
my mind what suggested itself to me as j
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 8, 1898.
a foolish feeling that existed at that time '
In the community and would, in other ;
words, settle all of these questions, which
co much fuss was made over; which was,
first, the liquor question. The church
people wanted a residence districtâ that
is. 1 agreed to go in with them and give ,
them a residence district. Not for the
purpose of hurting anybody, but that all
people who may have their saloons and
their business inside of this limit were to
be left alone and not blackmailed as they
bad been in the past, and all work to
combine to have decent and respectable
places in that business, and if an indi
vidual went beyond the limit his license !
was to be removed, but otherwise he wasi
to be unmolested and allowed to feel se- j
cure in his business. In regard to the i
A. P. A. proposition, I refused to meet j
them as A. P. A.'s., but said if they would
come to the Republican party I was will- !
ing to recognize them as Republicans and !
that they should have a representation in ;
proportion to their strength; that those
Who voted the Republican ticket were to
be on an equal footing, regardless of their
position or business: thai they were not â 
to be ostracised or punished. The School j
Department was to be kept out of poll
tics. It was conceded that the people i
who belonged to the Catholic church j
paid at least one-third of the taxes of
this community, and that they also had
one-third in the representation in this
city in votes; therefore they were entitled
to representation in the School Depart
ment. It was agreed that thfy were to ;
have one-third, and that no party in a j
school position was to be removed except
Cor incompetency. and. in that event, i* It :
happened to be one of the Catholic faith i
that went, one of the same faith was to
be replaced. And upon these lines and '
upon this policy we started out. Mr.
Jarman's name was mentioned by me as
a candidate. I claimed that this was a
rock upon which we were all likely to
split , that it was a dangerous experi
ment. We had to have men we could
trust. I believed Mr. Jarman to be hon
est, I believed him to be competent, and '
I believed he would satisfy the taxpayers
as well as these various Interests in the
city. It was therefore agreed that Mr.
Jarman, If he would accept, was to be a
candidate. Mr. Jarman belonged to no ;
organization, and he was a RepubMcan-V '
that was the understanding. He belonged
to no secret society that was in use ti&ai,
and he therefore aid
Attorney Delmasâ All this Is still the
: conversation.
Rea, continuingâ With Montgomery &
Co.. yes. sir. I explained the whole ma:- |
ter to Mr. Montgomery.
â  Delmas â You are referring- to the meet- i
ing of directors at the Hotel Vendome?
"'Yes, elr. I went to Mr. Jarman and I j
toid him my opinion of Mr. Dittus and I
Kreig: that I did not think any body had !
: any confidence in them. I told him thr>
| policy that we had outlined; that I had :
i friends of all descriptions, and that my â 
' Catholic friends who were personally |
friendiy to me would support him, which '
! they did. That the other element w-niid ;
1 support him and that my idea of him w;us ;
I this: That he was to caucus with the Re
publican members of the board and v.as
j to use his influence to mnintain harmony i
among these elements, and harmonize and
keep in harmony the Republican pany I
upon these lines, and that I thought we |
would have no further trouble, and that
if this harmony was maintained and the !
same condition of affairs existed when j
the Supervisor matter came uo he would i
| be an available man for Supervisor, and '
| I wanted him to consider that, if he would,
and that I knew of nobody who was more
available. He said he would accept, which
he did. and all of these elements. In fact ;
! every element pretty near in town, sup- \
, ported Mr. Jarman In the Fourth Ward.
I told them after he got In the Common :
' Council it was reported to me that he ,
I was combining ajraJnst me: that I went j
him, and he assured me that such
I was not the case. He assured me his
ideas were still in keeping and in line ,
with the views he- had entertained orig-
Inally, and that he would do as I wished :
j him "to; that I had fxolained to him that
' I had no candidate that I wanted In a !
i public place or in public position; that all i
! I wanted him to do was to satisfy the
; leaders whom we had got together to
bring these elements together in the in
terests of the Republican party. Monday
evening was the election for policemen.
Delmasâ Ail this you told Montgom-ry?
Reaâ Yes. sir; all of this I told Mont
gomery.
"Proceed."
. "I went to Mr. Jarman's house Sunday
mornlng for the purpose of asking him
to meet with the balance of the Council
men the following Monday and these dif
ferent leaders for the purpose of satisfy
ing them, If it were possible. I went to
Mr. Main's house and was directed over |
to his wood yard. I went over there and S
to my surprise, I saw them closeted with ;
Dittus and Krelg. Mr. Martin wai there I
also. I knew he did not belong there.
They were discussing the matter and I
asked Mr. Jarman if he proposed to stand '
in with that combination, and he said he
would not be dictated to. I told hfm I
had no dictations to make, only I thought j
It would ruin him, politically, at least;
that he would displease everybody and i
! place me in a false position. If these peo- |
; pie would happen to think I was responsi- i
| ble for It it would piece me In a false po- !
i sltion, and I did not care to be placed in j
! such a position. Mr. Dittus spoke up i
! rather exultantly, and I thoupht I would '
! uncover the situation to them so that
I they would see where they stood. I said \
to Ifr. Martin: 'Mr. Martin, you won't
j vote with these people, and why don't j
I you tell them so? They are only making 'â 
i "fools of themselves.' I said: "Martin.
Sou know that your employer is in direct
opposition In feeling and spirit and is a
personal enemy of Dittus. and you won't
permit him (Dittus* to fill this depart
ment up with his patrons to the detri
ment of your employer. If you do Tues
day morning you will lo- c your job.' It
was finally agreed that tht.-y should go
j out to my house and that I would try to
I pet Councilman M.ingrum and Mayor
i Paul P. Austin to go out there also, to
: gether with the leaders of these different
' elements.
"At my home we gathered about a
table. I sat on one side, Austin sat at
J the head. and these gentlemen sat
around. As they would suggest a name
I would write it down. Jarman wanted
I Reed, Main wanted Buckley. Kreig al
ready had Scully slated. They could not
! agree, so I was taken to one side and :
j asked for a thousand dollars, and was
i told that I could make up the slate and
i put any name on it I wanted. I cam'?
! into the room and said: "Gentlemen, I :
| am opposed to your slate on the ground
i that it don't represent either party, fae
j tlon or anything clsf>. only pure favorit- ;
i ism of the paint-shop or the butcher-sh tp ,
lor different businesses. I am opposed to :
j Kreig's proposition most emphatically,
and you people can't put up a slate with
j me under any consideration."
; Jarman. Kreig, Dittus and Main went to
; San Francisco to delay the election. <)n
| the night of the -election, the following
! Monday night, Mangrum read off the
i same slate from top to bottom and it was
seconded and came to a vote and they
were lÂ«*ft out. Mr. Jarman then led the -
tight after that and showed a great deal
or bitterness. I told them that C. M.
Hatcher had come to me and asked me if
I could help him in reference to the Rein
bardt houses that had burned down on
Third street. He wanted the fire limits
changed so that he could rebuild; that I
said I would, and I went to see Jarman
and he demanded the painting without
competition.
Muggard came to me and asked for my
influence to help him get his money for
his roller. He stated to me that he had
made arrangements with some one. I
said to him. "What Is the situation? I
don't care to touch this matter until I
know what you have done." He said
that they had all agreed to vote for the
roller. I asked him if he had made ar
rangements with them. He said he had,
and f-.e wanted me to see Mr. Fay and
Noiting. I told him I would.
I saw Mr. Noltingâ -just spoke to him
casuallyâ but he said he was going to
vote for it. Later Maggard came back
and told me it had cost him $250 extra, so
he came back her? and offered me the
roller for $27!J0 net to sell u> the county.
I thought I would investigate the matter
a little, and went over the different Coun
cilmen's names. He said he had not paid
them. When I came to Mr. Jarman's
name he refused to discuss it.
Rea said he met S. G. Tompklns on |
the street and they discussed the
Charter Club ticket. Finally Tomp
kins a.fÂ»ked, "How do you like our
ticket?"
Witness answered, "Haven t you
got the crookedest combination of lead
ers in the Charter Club that ever was
got together?" He started in to name
the ticket, which I criticized or did not,
as the case may be. When it came to
Jarman, I said the gentleman who sold
the steam-roller to the city .offered it
to me for $3000, and if Jarman was a
business man, as he claimed he was.
he could explain why he did not get
this for $3000 instead of $3750."
In reference to the conversation with
E. P. Main. Rea said Main was pass^T
Mrs. Goodrich's house at the time or the
altercation Â«ith Jarman. "I Just
ply waved my hand," said the witness,
"and said 'I was asking 1 Jack what be- i
came of that $450.' I had discussed the j
matter a day or two before and it was :
the continuation of our previous con
versation. Main and I had been dia
cussing the roller matter. I think he !
called my attention to it. We were i
trying to account for the $450 other j
than the $300 paid to the Krieg com-
Tt>ine."
He admitted discussing Jarman with
J. B. Church and E. A. Hayes while
plaintiff was running for Supervisor.
On cross-examination by Delmas
Rea was Just getting warmed up when
adjournment was taken. He said he
had seen Maggard on the train a
couple of times since the suit for slan
der had been brought against him.
Each time he met liaggard the defen
dant wa# going to Gilroy. Rea said
he did tiot know where Maggard lived
and never inquired, but supposed he
lived in San Francisco. They discussed
i the present suit each time. Maggard
had made a proposition to Rea to sell
the roller to the county, and told him
he could have all he got over $2750.
The agent had told him Supervisors
; Roll and Ayer were in favor of pur
; chasing the roller, but the other Super
! visors were not.
Rea said he told him he did not
want anything to do with it, and only
questioned him closely to simply deter
mine the facts.
"What did you say to that proposi
tion that this man made to you, that he
I could not sell this roller to the Super
visors because a majority of them were
against it. only two favorable to it,
and that he would sell it to you for
$2750. which was $250 less than the com
â¢ pany had ever accepted for it, and you
could take the difference between that
i and what you could get out of the
! county?" asked Delmas.
"I didn't say anything."
Did you tell him that tnai was not a
I very f"air proposition or a very honest
, one?
I did not discuss the matter. I gave
; him to understand what my purpose was
in questioning.
You didn't consider that as an insulting
- and offensive proposition, did you?
No.
That a man should use you to get
through the Board of Supervisors, one of
whom wtts your brother, a proposition
that he himsolf could not get through and
pay you for it. you considered that that
was perfectly legitimate?
He had asked them. I think, $37W for It.
Then he was wiling to let you have it
j for $2750?
And let you make a thousand dollars
I commission on it if you couldâ was that
' It?
If I was disposed to pell.
! Did you rebuke him for making any
â  such proposition to you?
That was not my business. I had an
1 other object in view.
Well, did you?
Well In a way I did. I said that I never
had done such business, and that my only
purpose In queptioning him was to deter
mine the facts in relation to the .roller
that had been sold to the cltv.
Rea said he asked Maggard: "Did
you pay Mayor Koch anything on
that?" and Maggard said: "Xo, sir.
He ie a dead square man."
The remainder of the cross-examina
tion was in regard to the purchase of
the steam-roller and similar to the tes
timony already given.
At 3:30 an adjournment was taken
until Tuesday morning at 10 o'clock,

SPANIARDS MUST
EVACUATE PORTO
RICO FORTHWITH
Ordered to Withdraw
by October 18.
PRESIDENT M'KINLEY FIRM
EXPLICIT INSTRUCTIONS WIRED
TO COMMISSIONERS.
Dons Also Informed That They
Must Retire From the Island
of Cuba by Decem
ber 1.
Special Dlspatrh to Tbe Call.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 7.â President
McKlnley has cabled the United States
Military Commission at Porto Rico that
the island must be evacuated by the
Spanish forces on or before October 18,
and that the Spanish Commissioners
must be so informed. In case of the
failure of the Spaniards to complete the
evacuation by that date, the United
States Commissioners are directed to
take possession and exercise all of the
functions of government, and in case it
is found to be impossible to secure
transportation for the Spanish troops
by October 18, they may be permitted
to go into temporary quarters until
transports can be secured to take them
to Spain.
This fact was developed at to-day's
Cabinet meeting, and it was also stated
that, from this time forward, a more
vigorous policy would be pursued with
respect to the evacuation of Cuba.
The President has notified the United
States Evacuation Commission at Ha
vana that the Spaniards would be ex
pected to have evacuated the island by
December 1. with a strong intimation
that, in case of failure, the United
States would brook no further delay,
but immediately thereafter take pos
session of the Government.
At to-day's Cabinet meeting tele
grams were read from General Otis, at
Manila, stating that the Spanish Gov
ernment has requested that General
Jaudenes be permitted to return to
Spain, where, it is understood, he will
bs called before a court of inquiry to
answer certain charges affecting his
management of affairs in connection
with the surrender of Manila
General Otis was authorized to per
mit the Spanish general to leave, to
gether with several other Spanish offi
cers who are on the sick list.
Major General Fitzhugh Lee received
an order from the War Department to
day directing him to move his com
mand from Jacksonville. Fla.. to Sa
vannah. Oa.. and to get It in readiness
to embark for Havana the last of this
month. General Lee leaves to-night
for Savannah to make preliminary ar
rangements to carry the orders into
effect.

WELL-MEANING,
BUT DANGEROUS
An Educator's Opinion
of Maguire.
SAYS HE IS NARROW-MINDED
THIS VIEW CONFIBMED BY GEN
ERAL BARNES.
Addressing a Large Gathering at
San Jose, the Orator Discusses
the "Little Giant's"'
Isms.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX JOSE, Oct. 7.â Fifteen hundred
people, including a generous propor
tion of ladies, heard General Barnes
taik this evening upon Maguire and
the issues of the State campaign. It
was the opening meeting of the State
campaign in Santa Ciara County.
Professor Duniway of Stanford Uni
versity was chairman of the evening.
In an opening address the chairman
alluded to Maguire as a well-meaning
but dangerous man in politics â danger
ous because he was narrow-minded
and mistaken, and holding vicious
views. He then introduced General
Barnes, who proceeded to severely ar
raign James "Holy G." Maguire, "that
consummate juggler of words," and his
"crazy patch" politics.
The "Lame Uiaiu s public career as
an office seeker was reviewed. The
speaker paid tribute to Maguire's re- !
markable memory and granted that he
made a good Judge, but told how lie '
had fed at the public crib for twenty
years, and when not in office his time j
was spent in running after it, "sweat
ing at every pore." The present fusion,
made without principle, and with noth
ing in common between the factions in
it, was declared a disgrace. The |
Democrats, he said, represented two- i
thirds of the aggregation, the Populists i
one-third and the Silver Republicans
Ute rest. The speaker pointed out that ;
there were but two points of difference
between the Republican and the Demo
cratic platforms; that the latter was
silent upon the subject of Hawaiian
annexation because Maguire had op
posed it, and that it also stood for the
immediate foreclosure of the Central
Pacific's debt, instead of the method
adopftd by Congress.
The Populist platform upon -which
Maguire stood was scathingly reviewed.
His support of a graduated income tax
was dismissed with the statement that
two United States Supreme Court de- j
cisions declared it unconstitutional.
His advtrt?acy of Government owner
ship of railways and telegraphs was
declared a "wild, cranky and crazy ;
idea." The reclamation by the Govern- ;
ment of all lands held in excess of the
actual needs of the owner was hastily
explained and the single tax fallacy ex
ploited. Constitutional amendment No.
10 was explained as an out-and-out ,
single tax proposition and a compro- i
mise between the Democrats and Popu-U
i lists.
After alluding to Maguire's speech in
Congress last winter, where he had de- !
dared sympathy with the anarchists of
i Europe, the speaker closed with a
I strong appeal soliciting the support of
i honest, conscientious Democrats for
j the Republican State ticket, and. In a
masterful peroration, scathingly de
nounced Populism. Nihilism, Anarch-
Ism and Maguireism.
EATON FOR MAYOR
OF LOS ANGELES
Outcome of itepublican Primaries In-
dicates His Nomination by-
Acclamation.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 7.â Primaries to
elect delegates to the Republican city
convention were held throughout the
city to-day. There was an extraordi
narily large vote polled, although in
most of the precincts the caucus ticket
which previously had been agreed upon
was elected. The Republicans are
manifesting great Interest this year in
the city contest, which will follow the
State election by Just thirty days.
The result of to-day's primaries in
dicated the nomination of Fred Eaton
for Mayor on the first ballot, if not by
acclamation. There has not been uu
to this hour any avowed candidate
against him. Mr. Eaton has resided
here for over thirty years, and has al
ready filled creditably the position of
City Engineer for several terms. The
primaries ajso insure the renomlnatlon
of J. H. Drain for Street Superinten
dent.
The Republican city convention will
be held next Wednesday. At present
the Democrats have the Mayor, City
Engineer, City Clerk and City Assessor.
The Republicans propose to mak* 1 a
strong fight to reclaim these offices,
and the leaders have the utmost confi
dence that the party will succeed if
proper nominations are made by
Wednesday's convention.
Registration Lists Reopened.
SALINAS, Oct. 7.â Acting under the de
cision of Judge Hyland of Santa Cruz
County, registration of voters for the
coming election was reopened by County
Clerk Kalar of Monterey County this af
ternoon. It had been agreed previously
by both county committees to bring a
test case in the Superior Court here, but
this action will stop the suit. The regis
tration previous to the former closing'
was very heavy, there having- been nearly ;
1200 new" voters registered. The reopening I
will add about 250 more. The total vote ;
of the county probably will be about 6200.
The new registrations Indicate an in
creased Republican vote.
Enthusiasm at Ferndale.
EI'REKA, Oct. 7.â A big Republican
rally was held at Ferndale to-night. Ad
dresses were delivered by Congressman
J A Barham and Judge Oregon Sanders.
Four hundred went from this city on a
special train, the party comprising the
Gage-Neff Club, escorted by the Barham
Drill Corps and a brass band. There was
an Immense turnout at Ferndale. A dem
onstration will take place in this city to
morrow night, when Congressman Bar
ham and Judge Sanders will again speak.
Needham at San Bernardino.
SAN BERNARDINO, Oct. 7.â Needham
or Modesto, Republican candidate for
Congress In the Seventh District, and
Major C. W. Kyle addressed a large gath
ering at the pavilion to-night. The mat
ing was presided over by Judge C. N.
Damron. Needham made a good impres
sion. Both speakers held the close atten
tion of the audience.
Democratic Bally at Gilroy.
GILROY. Oct. 7.â The Democrats fired
the first gun cf the campaign here to
night. Reel B. Terry and Eurdette Cor
nell, a Populist, spoke in the interest of
Maguire and the fusion ticket. Bonfires
blazed in the streets, anvils were fired
and the band supplied lively music. At

by ex-Mayor Casey.

COLONEL LEE AND MAJOR HER
SEY ALSO TESTIFY.
All the Witnesses Declare That a
Vast Majority of me Com
plaints Were Exag
gerated.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 7.â Three wit
nesses were before the War Investigat
ing Commission â General Greene, who
participated in the battle of Manila;
Colonel Lee, chief quartermaster at
Camp Thomas, and Major Hersey, who
was for a time in command of the
Roosevelt Rough Riders. Each ad
mitted the possibility of individual
cases of suffering and discomfort, but
ail said that the vast majority of com
plaints were exaggerated, if not with
out foundation. They agreed in saying
that no army was ever so abundantly
and luxuriously supplied as was the
American army in the Spanish war.
General Greene said that there was
no complaint during the voyage to Ma
nila of scarcity of supplies, but during
the first two days out there was some
dissatisfaction with the cooking. This
was soon improved, and no criticism
was heard afterward. The details of
the ocean trip and of the battle of Ma
late were related in a manner calling
for the closest attention from the Com
missioners, but covering the same
ground as his report to the War De
partment, recently made public, had
done. He spoke of the insurgents who
lay between his forces and the Spanish
lines. It was, the witness said, impos
sbile to give an estimate of their num
ber, but he thought it was about 10,000.
They were well supplied with Mauser
and Remington rifles, many of which
they had captured from the Spanish
and others which they had purchased
abroad.
The site of Camp Merritt, San Fran
cisco, was very poor. The location was

made by General Otis, and General
Greene felt safe in denying the report
that there had been collusion with the
railroad authorities in choosing the
site.
The most flagrant evidence of neglect
that he had seen during the war was
the case of transports at New York.
Their condition was of a character that
should be remedied. He had also seen
green coffee used, both in Flo-rida and
at Manila.
Major Henry B. Hersey of Santa Fe,
N. ML, of the Roosevelt Rough Riders,
said the camp at Tampa. Fia.. was low
and flat and toward the close of his stay
there in July there was an increase of
fever and kindred diseases. The troops
v.'ere, he said, well supplied from the
commissary an r l other departments,
but there were some complaints of the
bearing of the physicians who were
left with the squadron at this point.
He ascribed the sickness of the men In
Cuba to the climate and the hardships
cf the campaign.
Colonel James G. C. Lee. chief quar
termaster at Camp Thomas, said that
all his estimates for supplies had been
met with a remarkable degree of
promptitude. He dwelt upc-n the nat
ural difficulties of supplying an army
of 56,000, who seemed to expect to be
able to turn a faucet and get every
thing they wanted "on the spur of the
moment." There were some articles of

HONORABLE DISCHARGE
OF MANY GENERALS
Officers Promoted From the Regular
Army Will Return to Former
Duties.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 7.â The War De
partment to-day issued the long expected
order for the honorable discharge from
the volunteer service of the United States
of three major generals and twenty-six
brigadier generals of volunteers. This
heavy reduction was made necessary by
the fact that the volunteer army itself
has already been reduced by fully 50 per
cent and there is consequently no duty
remaining for these officers to discharge.
The officers wno were promoted from
the regular army will return to their for
mer duties. The list is as follows:

REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ASSEMBLE TO CHEER THEIR RESPECTIVE LEADERS
HENRY T. GAGE SPEAKS
AT THREE MEETINGS
A Great Throng of Republican Voters Greet
Their Standard-Bearer at
Athletic Hall.
Charles L. Patton, the Next Mayor, Julias Kahn and Others
Make Brief Addresses at Potrero Opera-Honse
and Metropolitan Temple.
"When Dr. C. L. Morgan, chairman of
the ratification meeting held by the Thir
tieth Assembly District Republican Club
In the rooms of the San Francisco Ath
letic Club on Sixth street last night, called
the meeting to order there was hardly
an inch of seating space not occupied by
a voter of the district. All of the stand
ing room was also utilized by residents of
the district, who uncomplainingly stood
for hours listening to the eloquence
poured forth by the numerous candidates
â who appeared before them. Like their
more fortunate neighbors who were seat
ed they interspersed the addresses of the
orators by cheers and applause.
The appearance of Henry T. Gage near
the c!o ;e of the meeting won him an ova
tion. Ine voters stood on their seats and
cheered until the very rafters rang, and
the efforts of the musicians, who were
manfully trying to play a welcoming air,
â were lost in the volume of sound. As the
Republican candidate pushed his way
through the standing throng his hand
â was grasped on all sides. He was accom
panied by Irving M. Scott, lately returned
from Washington with another contract
for the building of a great battle-ship.
Mr. Gage and Mr. Scott were escorted
to the platform, and bowed their appre
ciation of the splendid reception. A. B.
Tteadwell, candidate for Police Judge,
Â«Vas speaking at the moment, but on the
entrance of the distinguished guest he
closed his remarks.
Again the cheers rang forth when Mr.
Gage was introduced by the chairman as
next Governor of California. When
the noise had subsided Mr. Gage opened
his remarks by saying that some might
think he was a stranger in their midst.
He won the crowd almost immediately
by Baying that he was never a stranger
where the stars and stripes floated.
"Wherever that flag waves," he con
tinued, "and I look into the faces of citi
zens who love that flag I feel at home.
(Applause.) And here in your midst, j
though a long distance from the place
where I pass most of my life, I feel at
home.
â¢*I would like to discuss the funding
movement and all these Questions, but
the time allotted is short. These villain
ous attacks on me by the Democratic
press and the stump orators of the 'con
fusion' convention, where they declare I
am a railroad hireling, are infamous and
the man who charges me with such Is a
corporate scoundrel himself. (Applause.)
In my earl" manhood I commenced to
battle against the right of the railroad to
operate this State, and the first political
utterance from my lips was that the
Southern Pacific had no right to inter
fere with political affairs."
When Mr. Gage informed his listeners
that he assisted Joseph Call in wresting
from the railroad corporations of America
nearly 30,000,000 acres of land and restored
It to the public domain, the applause was
deafening.
"It is infamous for this man to stand
on a political rostrum and declare I am
a tool of the railroad. It hurts my heart
and I resent it because they strike at
the name find honor of my children,
whom I love. (Great applause.) Fear
not, fellow-citizens, that I will ever be
dominated by that kind of influence. If
I am elected Governor of this State of
Californiaâ and I will be Its next Gever
nor (continued cheering and cries of
"you will")â you may depend upon it that
when I occupy that chair there will be
a heart beating there for the poor man.
No Governor will occupy that chair who
has not an ear of sympathy for RtrugfÂ«
grling manhood."
At the close of Mr. Gage's address the
audience arose and gave him three ring
ing cheers.
Charles A. Patton, Republican candidate
4.
for Mayor, was given a warm welcome
when introduced. He said that if elected
he would give the city an honest admin
istration, and stated he was in favor of
municipal ownership of gas and water
works.
Speeches were made by John A. Hoey,
Louis A. Devoto, Edward I. Sheehan,
John E. McDougan, Julius Kahn, Dr. W.
J. Hawkins, I. J. Truman, Judge Mur
phy, G. W. Collins, Mr. Bergerot and
Judge Treadwell. The Knickerbocker
Quartet, Emmet S. Scanlan and Blum's
Band furnished music during the even
ing.
The entrance of the Phoenix Drill Corps
during the meeting was a pleasing diver
sion. They were heartily cheered, and in
turn cheered the candidates on the plat
form.

auspices of the Spanish-Amercian Re
publican League of California was an
other demonstration of enthusiasm for

of the Republican party.
Shortly after 8 o'clock Andrew Branch,
on behalf of the league, called the meet
ing to order. Mr. Branch, referring to
his experience in former campaigns, add
ed that he never had greater confidence
in the success of the party than he had
at the present time. In closing. Mr.
Branch introduced A. de la Torre Jr. as
the chairman of the meeting.
In the course of his remarks Mr. Kahn
said that it was especially gratifying to
note the presence of a vast audience, es
it signified the deep interest manifested
in the Republican cause. The great mass
of the people of the United States praise
President McKinley, and hold that he is

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 8, 3 898.
MEETING OF THE RIVAL CANDIDATES IN FRONT
OF THE MERCHANTS' EXCHANGE.
SHIP MASTERS
AND OWNERS
GREET GAGE
There was quite an imposing scene on
the floor of the Merchants' Exchange yes
terday afternoon. From Ito 2 p. m. near
ly all the prominent merchants, shipown
ers and masters of vessels gather there
daily to discuss business and occasional
politics. Â« _ ..
At 2 p m. yesterday Henry T. Gage, the
Republican candidate for Governor, ac
companied by Hugh Craig, president of
the Chamber of Commerce, put in an ap
of the first order. Mr. Kahn reasoned,
therefore that it was the duty of the
American people to uphold the brilliant
fdmini S t?aUon P of President McKinley. lt
was due to him, he said, that a Republ'
car. Congress should be chosen to sus
tain him Mention was made of the geo
graphical position of California as re
fated to the Philippines and the argument
was advanced that a magnificent com
merce should be created to enrich the
country of the Pacific Coast The destiny
of San Francisco as a great commercial
city was dwelt upon. Mention was made
of the Federal appropriations demanded
to complete the Postofflce in San I ran
cisco, and the point discussed that Con
gressmen in sympathy with the admin
istration should be chosen to represciw
LIIL I 11 J Or T?uman, Republican candidate for
City and County Treasurer, was intro
duced as the second speaker.
Mr Truman remarked that if a vote
were taken now the Republicans would
roll up an immense majority. He was
persuaded to this belief by the enthusiasm
for the ticket among the masses of the
people. He described the way in which the
Democratic State Convention was packed
by two or three bosses in San Francisco.
Mention was made of the "raw" work
In packing local conventions. The fact
was cited that A. C. Freese, one of the
strongest men of the city, was turned
down for Public Administrator and a man
named Fitzgeraid Imported from Oak
land and placed on the ticket.
A. B. Treadwell, nominee for Police
Judge, was welcomed with great demon
strations of applause. In his speech he
exalted the constitution of the United
States and paid a tribute of praise to
American heroes.
Thomas Graham, nominee for Police
Judge, was the next speaker. Judge
Joachimsen followed with a few remarks.
R. R. Duckworth, president of the
Spanish-American Republican League of
California, was presented to the audience.
He made a brief speech.
Judge C. A. Low had only a few words
to say. He was firmly convinced that the
Republican ticket from top to bottom
would be elected. He had doubts for a
time about the success of the municipal
ticket, but now he was convinced that
the whole ticket would win.
Patriotic songs were sung by Mrs.
Bertha Adams. She was cheered and re
sponded to an encore.
Chairman de la Torre presented to the
audience ex-Governor Romualdo Pacheco,
remarking that the distinguished man
served in Congress with the noble Wil
liam McKinley. The applause following
the introduction of ex-Governor Pacheco
was prolonged and hearty. The ex-Gov
ernor said he appeared before the audi
ence as an old friendâ an old public serv
antâwho had endeavored to render the
best service in his power. As in the p-."t,
he was now a Republican and a supporter
of Republican principles. Mr. Pacheco
dwelt upon the forms of government in
pearance and was hailed with cheers. He
was introduced to all as "'our next Gov
ernor," and all without exception wished
him success. Mr. Gage had not been in
the room five minutes before he had made
a dozen friendsâ friends who will be able
to do a great deal for him in the coming
struggle.
Amony those who were introduced to
Mr. Gage were, J. Eppinger, Captain J.
H. Bruce, W. H. Mighell, H. J. Emery, J.
K. C. Hobbs, Captain Freeman, Captain
Alex Swanson, R. G. Sneath, Colonel C.
L. Taylor, A. Chesebrough. John Rosen
feld, J. Dailey, Captain T. P. H.Whitelaw,
Captain F. W. Jordan, Captain W. J.
Gray, Abe Marks, W. B. Downs and J.
\V. Harrison, who was presented as "a
good Democrat." Mr. Harrison was
charmed with "our next Governor," and
is half persuaded to become a good Re
publican.
As Mr. Gage was leaving the Exchange
building he encountered Mr. Magulre go
ing in. The rival candidates stopped and
chatted for a few minutes and then con
tinued on their respective ways. When
Mr. Maguire got into the Exchange he
found that everybody, except one or two
dled-In-the-wool Democrats, had left the
building with Mr. Gage, so he also re
tired, promising to call again to-day.
the United States, pointing out the sim
ple features of our system. He spoke of
his acquaintance with Henry T. Gage,
and from personal association with him
knt-w his abilities. Ob this topic he said:
"I do not know of one better fitted to
fill the office of Governor than Henry T.
Gage. Nature has endowed him with
qualities which place him in touch with
the people."
A few minutes before 11 o'clock there
was a great tumult of applause, which
signaled the arrival of Henry T. Gage, the
Republican standard bearer. Although
many had gone home weary of waiting,
1000 people remained to greet the next
Governor. The greeting accorded to Mr.
Gage was in the nature of an ovation.
The audience applauded and cheered for
several minutes. Owing to the lateness
of the hour the standard bearer did not
make a speech. He expressed his grati
tude to the people for the compliment they
had paid to him in waiting so long. It
was explained that engagements else
where detained him. He promised at
some opportune time to speak at greater
length, and closed by thanking the peo
ple for the magnificent reception.
AT THE POTRERO.
Republican Nominees Enthusi-
astically Received by the
Mechanics.
The Opera House at the Potrero was
packed last night with the mechanics,
their wives and children, in the anticipa
tion of seeing and hearing the men that
will administer the laws and govern the
State and municipality on and after the
first Monday of next January.
Shortly after 8 o'clock a carriage drove
up with the next Governor. Henry T.
Gag%; Irving M. Scott, C. S. Laumeister
and Alva Watt. These gentlemen were
met at the door leading into the hall by
T. C. Duff and Dr. T B. de Witt, the lat
ter acting as chairman of the meeting
and the former in the capacity of presi
dent of the Potrero Republican Club.
As soon as the guests had been seated
on the platform T. C. Duff called the
meeting to order and introduced Dr. de
Witt as chairman of the meeting. This*
gentleman introduced Irving M. Scott
On the introduction of Gage the rafters
of the house were made to vibrate. He
commenced his discourse by gaining the
goodwill of his audience in telling them
that he had been a hard-working man in
his younger days and as a consequence
his sympathies were with the working
man. Maguire claimed to be a black
smith, but he was under the impression
that it was a good many years since the
single-tax eater had heard the music of
the anvil under his own hammer. (Laugh
ter and applause).
' At the conclusion of Mr. Gage's remarks
he was given three cheers by the audi
ence.
C. S. Laumeister, nominee for Railroad
Commissioner, was enthusiastically re
ceived. He made a short addreÃS, telling
his audience that in 1868 he lived in the
Potrero while following his avocation as
an engineer. He was a mechanic and un
derstood the trials and difficulties which
beset men who have to work for a living
in order to properly support their families.
He spoke for the nominees of the party
and was sure of the success of the entire
ticket on election day.
C. F. Curry, W. A. Deane, Edward Shee
han, Thomas F. Graham and Charles L.
Patton and Julius Kahn, who arrived late,
were received with hearty cheers. All
made short addresses which were listened
to with marked attention. Graham, who
is a nominee for Police Judge, being a
graduate of the rolling mills, had the en
tire sympathy of the boys in ihe Potrero
with him.
Another meeting will be held in the near
future at which the municipal nominees
alone will be accorded the pleasure of
talking to the men who build the ships
that command the respect of the whole
world and add luster to the American
flag.
Much Democratic Oratory.
. On Thursday evening the Thirtieth Dis
trict Maguire Club met in the hall of the
San Francisco Athletic Club to hear the
usual flow of Democratic oratory. Tim
Tracy, L. M. Manzer and E. L. Fitzger
ald held the crowd until the advent of
James H. Barry. A number of other can
didates followed Barry, but tho crowd
was restless, and began to thin rapidly.
Clitus Barbour had a two hours' speech
on Barnes which he did not deliver, but
he lives in hopes of being able to work
It off yet on some Democratic club.
UNIVERSITY STUDENTS
GREET JUDGE MAGOIRE
Members of Two Colleges Tender a Reception
to the Leader at Woodward's
Pavilion.
Class Yells, Oratory, Campaign Songs and General Good
Fellowship Mark the Proceedings of the
Eyening Governor Budd's
> Address,
"Are we relying on the 'Little Giant?' "
Several hundred students asked that
question at frequent intervals at Wood*
ward's Pavilion last night, and each time
would follow the answer, almost in the
same breath:
"You bet we are relying on the 'Little
Giant. 1 "
Question and answer afforded them no
little satisfaction, and it certainly afford
ed the big crowd packed into the lower
part of the structure much amusement.
It also tickled the man on whom they
placed so much reliance, as well as the
other aspirants for office and the invited
guests seated on the little balcony that
served as a speaker's stand.
The occasion was the joint reception of
the students of California and Leland
Stanford Jr. universities to James G.
Maguire. For once the rival college
yells rang out in blissful harmony in
stead of defiant challenge. The blue and
gold was Intertwined with the crimson;
the men of the two great institutions in
termingled on terms of courteous cordial
ity. For the hour the bitter gridiron
scrimmages and the hostile meetings on
the diamond were forgotten, or if not for
gotten, were ignored. When the short,
snappy bark of Stanford rang out the
quick, raspy cry of Berkeley was defer
entially stilled until the close. Then it
would come as a friendly acknowledg
ment of the other. It will be different a
few weeks hence.
The big pavilion was artistically decor
ated with the colors of the two colleges
in honor of the occasion. Back of the
speaker's stand was a broad banner of
blue and gold, which bore the motto in
letters of silver, "Truth is eternal and
must prevail." The front of the stand
was draped with crimson, festooned with
an eagle and shield, while underneath
were large crossed American flags.
Around the gallery the two college colors
were entwined, caught up at intervals
with portraits of Judge Magulre and
American shields alternately, while over
head broad streamers of blue and gold
radiated from a crimson centerpiece.
The gallery was reserved for the colle
gians and invited guests, while the main
floor and lower circle were thrown open
to the public. There was some misman
agement on the part of the police, to
which Governor Budd called attention
when the matter was brought to his no
tice. When the officers thought there
were enough in the hall they refused to
admit any more, although there were
many vacant seats left and a large crowd
outside clamoring for admission. When
the Governor demanded that the people
be admitted the doors were thrown open
and the hole quickly filled.
Pending the arrival of the guest of the
evening and his associatesâ and they were
late in reaching the pavilionâ the audi
ence divided its attention be
tween the band and the shouts of the
students. When the latter gave their vo
cal chords a rest they would fill in the
time distributing cards of the various
candidates. Those seated on the main
floor were the recipients of these favors,
which were usually snapped down to
them with catapult force.
After a time the celebrated Columbian
Quartet made its bow and sang a new
patriotic song, giving for an encore a po
litical effort telling about the hot time
there will be in the old town when Ma
guire is elected Governor.
It lacked just 10 minutes to 9 when
Judge "William P. Lawler, chairman of
the Union Campaign Committee, made a
passageway through the crowd for Judge
Maguire, Governor Budd, James H. Barry,
William Craig, William M. Hinton, John
P. Dunn, E. L. Hutchison, Will S. Green,
H. A. McCraney and the Stanford and
Berkeley orators. The party ascended the
speakers stand amid a tumult of en
thusiasm, while several clubs with band
and drum corps marched in, adding to
the hubbub. Judge Maguire bowed his
acknowledgment of the brand new calls
the students turned loose in his honor,
and after the cheers for the candidate
had subsided they broke out afresh for
Governor Budd, and the welcome ac
corded him was fully as demonstrative as
It had been for Judje Maguire.
After a time, John C. Applewhite of
the pioneer class of '95 of Stanford man
aged to make himself heard. He said:
"The students of two great universities
have met this evening to jointly receive
James G. Maguire, whom you all know.
These two universities have met before
upon the gridiron, on the diamond and in
debate, at which times free vent has been
given to their rivalry; but to-night they
meet in perfect harmony."
After a few laudatory words of Judge
Maguire, the speaker presented Governor
Budd as the chairman of the evening.
Again the cheering for "Jim Budd' broke
loose. After it had subsided the Governor
spoke in part as follows:
"It is enough to knock one speechless
to see such a crowd turn out on such a
night as this, and nothing but the honor
of presiding over a meeting of the stu
dents of these two great colleges would
have brought me out to-night. Away
back in 1869 I entered the first class of the
University of California for the full four
years' course, and in 1873, with eleven
others, I was graduated from that insti
tution. I have watched its struggles in
infancy and have seen it grow to man
hood under the fostering care of our peo
ple until it has been so magnificently en
dowed that it will soon be the university
of the world.
"Then there is that other university
brought into existence by the generosity
of one of California's most public-spirited
citizens. Already it has become famous
throughout the land as a temple of learn
ing, and has brought to this State that
splendid body of instructors headed by
the scholarly David Starr Jordan. But
neither of these universities is of a po
litical character.
"When I took up a paper this morning
I saw a statement credited to the Repub
lican candidate for Governor that the
University of California is a Republican
institution, fostered by Republican gen
erosity. Back into his teeth I hurl the
falsehood, for it is false. For him I have
the greatest respect as a man and law
yer, but as a political speaker I will not
say anything."
Governor Budd then gave a history of
the founding of the State University, and
said that both parties and all the people
had helped It. There was no politics in
it.
"Hastings founded the college of law
that is now a part of the university, and
he was a Democrat; Toland founded the
medical department, and he was a Demo
crat; Mrs. Phebe Hearst is now engaged
with plans for new buildings that will
be a lasting monument to her generosity;
while Miss Jennie Flood, whose father
was one of the leading Democrats of the
State, has just endowed it with $3,000,
000. Nobody ever claimed the University
of California was a political institution
until yesterday, and if that gentleman
doesn't know any more about the college
than that he had better remain in Los
Angeles and practice law.
"During the last session of the Legis
lature when more generous provision was
made for the University of California than
ever before at one time by the State, Re
publicans and Democrats alike, without
a single exception, supported the meas
ure. Coombs, the speaker of the Assem
bly, a regent and a Republican, indorsed
the bill; so did Jeter, the president of the
Senate, also a regent, and a Democrat,
and I as Governor, and, too, a member
of the Board of Regents, signed it. Three
regents and every member of the Legis
lature gave their time and attention to
that bill."
The Governor then launched forth into
the Issues of the campaign, asserting
that the railroad was the paramount is
sue. He said the Republicans denied
that the railroad was in politics, but its
hand was too apparent in Gage's nom
ination to attempt any denial. In order to
conceal the real issue Mr. Gage and his
followers raised the bugaboo of the single
tax. If they were asked about the rail
road they would reply, "Shâ h, Maguire
is a single taxer." If Maguire were forty
single taxers he could not carry into ef
fect his theory without the approval of
the people, for It would require a con
stitutional amendment to adopt It.
The question to-day, he said, was tne
income tax, and though he had worked to
secure an income tax, his efforts had been
defeated by a Republican Legislature, in
conclusion, he said: "I ask the people to
seriously consider the issues of this cam
paign. The railroad is either for or
against one of these two candidates for
Governor, and whichever way it be, the
people want to be on the other side."
Hugh Bradford, class of '99, University
of California, followed the Governor. He
is an able speaker and before he had ut
tered a dozen words, he had won the sym
pathy and approval of the audience. He
had a particularly happy way of present
ing his arguments which aroused many
hearty burette of applause. He said thÂ«
students of the colleges had no fear of
the single tax, and the efforts of the Re
publicans to force it to the front was
ridiculous. The poll tax was of much
more concern to the students. He termed
this form of taxation as unjust and arbi-
He said the currency question waa Â»
more vital issue of the campaign, while
no question could be of greater import
ance to the people of the Pacific Coast
than the construction of the Nicaragua
canal, which should be built by the Gov
ernment for the people, as the Democrati
advocated, and not by the Government
for private individuals, as the Republi
cans desired. The Nicaragua canal led up
to the railroad question, and the speaker
proceeded to grill that corporation to
the keen relish of his hearers.
Everybody on the stand shook hands
with the young orator when he had fin
ished, and after a musical selection
Ralph B. Filcher, class of '99. Stanford
University, was introduced. He said in
"I want to tell you that the Stanford
students are right in line for James G.
Maguire. I know personally that one
fourth of the men there, who were for
merly Republicans, are for the Democrat
ic nominee this year, and I have not heard
of one Democrat who is opposed to him.
"Students have much to do with the
study of political economy, and when
they find a great corporation evading its
just obligations and interfering in pub
lic affairs for its personal ends, they are
not slow to rebuke it. He who oppose*
such corporate greed is a patriot of the
highest order, and such is now James G.
Maguire. Mr. Gage may be a most
worthy gentleman, but he is in extremely
bad company." . , ,
Mr Filcher is a born orator and hia
speech delivered with fiery eloquence
brought the people to their feet with re
peated cheers when he retired.
The Stanford quartet sang several cam-
paign song-s to the delight of the crowd,
after which Clinton E. Miller, class of '00.
University of California, came forward.
His crisp, epigrammatic sentences were
full of pith and humor and he soon had
his auditors in rare good humor. v
His allusion to the Green Gage < â ldi
date" made a general hit. He conceded
his address by reading a resolution favor
ing Maguire, adopted at a recent meet
ing of the University of California Ma
guire Club.
Anthony H. Suzzalo, class of '99, Stan
ford, was the last of the collegians to
address the gathering. Mr. Suzzalo has
a fine presence, a clear resonant voice
and delivered a carefully prepared speech
with telling effect. He concluded by
reading resolutions adopted by the Stan
ford Maguire Club, in which the candi
dacy of Maguire is heartily indorsed.
Governor Budd at this stage presented
all the candidates for State and Congres
sional honors to the audience, each being
cheered in turn. After a couple of songs
by the Columbian quartet Judge Maguire
was introduced. His address was very /
short, as the people were beginning- to
leave the hall. He said, substantially:
"Mr. Chairman, gentlemen of the uni
versities and ladies and gentlemen: This
is by far the grandest demonstration of
the campaign. It is a demonstration of
principle by the two greatest universities
of the West. I have watched and sym
pathized with the growth of the Univer
sity of California. I heard it said when
it was founded that it would only be
come a college for rich men's sons. I
have seen it the college of men of every
condition. /
"I have seen it grow in the last four
years under the efforts of Governor Budd
until it has doubled in attendance. I
stand on a platform pledged to the liberal
support qÂ£ the University of California,
and when I succeed Governor Budd, for
I shall succeed him, I pledge myself to
foster it as Governor Budd has done.
"The Leland Stanford Jr. University is
magnificently equipped and splendidly
endowed and has added new luster to the
State. In the study of political ecopomy
by these young men the principle instilled
in them, above all others, is the doctrine
of equal rights to all. It was the doc
trine of Thomas Jefferson and the im
mortal Lincoln.
"We welcome these students to our
ranks to battle with us for equal rights.
I thank you for this magnificent recep
tion to me."

After holding threÂ« sessions In as many

convention last evening at 9134 Market

Raymond Estadille. His next suggestion
was that the People's party convention
Indorse the Assembly and Senatorial can
didates of the Democratic party in a
lump, without bothering to read out the
names, as he said that the delegates must
know all of the Lines by that time.
Glilispie had the convention with him.
and with the exception of one the dele
gates decided to swallow the whole, bait,
hook and bob. This provoked the in
dignant eloquence of Dr. Griswold. who
declared that the People's party, in so
doing, was nuklr.g a base surrender to j
the Democratic party of its party rights, i
He stared that the fusion at Sacramento j
contemplated equality, but Gillispie's i
proposition was simply making the Peo- !
ple's party an insignificant tail to the <
Democratic dog. and for one lie did not
desire to be wagged In any such a man
ner. Dr. Griswoid soon learned that he
was a minority of one, and he consented
to compromise by hearing the names of
the Democratic nominees read before th<_ir
Indorsement.
The reading of the names proceeded un
til the Fortieth District was reached, ]
â¢when GUllsple announced that the Demo- |
crats had not nominated any one for that i
district. He suggested that some one be j
nominated with the understanding that j
he could be pulled down in favor of one j
that the Democrats might choose. Dr. i
â¢Jriswold was on his feet in a second, I
declaring that if the convention would go j
bo far as to indorse all of the Democratic <
nomir.et-s the ieast that that party could
do would be to accept one named by the j
People's party, and he denounced Mr. Gii
litpie - remarks aoout presenting a solid
front as all rot.' In fact, when the
aged doctor was sat upon again by the
convention he became so indignant that
he started to leave the hail, but was In
duced to remain by the serjeant-at-arms, j
The nrst proposition prevailed, and K. C. i

The formality of placing the names of

retary cast a ballot for the whole batch
was gone through with and thus the
nominations were made. However, there
was a little joker rung In before this busi
ness closed. J. M. Kinne stated that it

scribe to the principles of the Democratic
ratty before rinal indorsement. He said
.that he hn.l met one Democratic candi
date who had refused to support James
G. Maguire foe Governor, would go
against the new charter, declared himself
as against the Democratic platform and
repudiated the free coinage of silver Mr
Kinne thought the executive commit
tee should have the privilege of remo^â¢ing
the name of such a candidate from the
People's party ticket. He said that there
might be others. The convention gave

euch a candidate and substitute the name

elicited much unfavorable < â¢â mment
among men of all shades of political be
lief. So fearfui were the programmers
that Mr. Freese's popularity would result
in the breaking of the slate that some
members went so far as to Insinuate that
Judge Coffey had. in a private letter,
crtticized Mr. Freese's administration un
favorably. The fact that the insinuation
could not be established by evidence is
made plain by the subjoined testimonials
flren Mr. Freese by Judge Coffey and
udge Slack:

As Captain A. C. Freese is r.Â»arlne the end

Uncle Sam's Treatment of Red

Treatment of the
Filipinos.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Oct. 7. âThe American and
Spanish Peace Commissioners again
confronted each other this afternoon.
The American Commissioners held a
session this morning and were occu
pied with Washington correspondence.
During the recess they have sought to
perfect the United States' position in
relation to the alternative or contin
gent attitude or propositions of the
Spanish this afternoon. Thus far the
form or substance of the American pre
sentment has not been disclosed. It
was its presentation at Monday's joint
session which caused the Spaniards to
ask for, or demand, a recess from Mon
day until Friday. Whatever was new
or stronger will possibly develop from
the American side as having resulted
from the conferences with Major Gen
eral Merritt since Monday's joint
Sc-ssiun. If the Americans were then
sweeping in their demands regarding
the Philippine Islands, they have cer
tainly not been weakened by the state
ments of General Merritt.
The session adjourned at 3:15 p. m.
until Tuesday. October 11. The pre
liminaries are finished.
The Commissioners at to-day's session
settled upon the points which are to
be taken under consideration, but mere
is no settled order in which they are
to be considered. Propositions ' have
been exchanged in writing between the
commissions, and each commission, in
recess, will separately deliberate upon
them. Senor Ojeda, the secretary of
the Spanish Commission, made his first
appearance at to-day's session. Sec
retary Moore and Senor Ojeda have de
c-hied upon a plan for keeping the re
cords of the conference. There are no
stenographic minutes of the meeting.
The secretaries each record the pro
ceeding's and the results.
If for no other reason than the fact
that the Philippine Islands were not
mentioned first in the protocol it may be
said with assurance that the commis
sions' Joint sessions have not yet
touched upon the question of the Phil
ippine Islands.
The Liberte this evening, referring to
the Indian outbreak in Minnesota, con
trasts editorially the Federal treatment
of the redskins and the Spanish treat
ment of the natives of the Philippine
Islands, expressing the conviction th.it
any contrast must prove unfavorable
to the Federal authorities.
EPISCOPALIANS HONOR
CANADIAN CHURCHMEN
Expressions of Love and Good Will
Exchanged at the Triennial
Council.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 7.â A signifi
cant session of the Episcopal Triennial
Council was held to-day, when the
House of Bishops joined the House of
Deputies in a jcrint meeting to receive
and do honor to a deputation from the
English Church in Canada. This blend
ing of the church forces rrom both sides
of the border was regarded as in line
I with the recent Anglo-American trend
I of events.
At the last council a committee was
i appointed to convey greetings to the
| church In Canada, and this committee
gave its report in the agreeable form of
presenting to-day a deputation repre
senting the first churchmen of the
Dominion. It was headed by his Grace,
the Right Rev. Archbishop Lewis,
Archbishop O'Meara and Judge Herbert
McDonald. Archbishop Lewis is the
head of the church in Canada, not only
!in authority but also through fifty
' years of continuous eervice.
After the visiting delegates had been
; escorted to the platform all the Bish
ops ar.d delegates rising, Bishop Doane
of Albany, the presiding officer of the
House of Bishops, extended them an
j eloquent welcome. He greeted them, he
i said, in the name of a common church
â one in England, In America and in
Canada.
As it was impossible, he proceeded,
for the waters of the St. Lawrence to
create distinctions between things ec
! cleslastlc in the United States and
things ecclesiastic In Canada; so, too,
it was impossible for the waters of the
Atlantic to create distinctions between
two great nations.
"Closer and closer the ties have been i
drawn between the people of these two I
nations." he said, "and may we not
hope that this church â the same In Ut
! any and in language â may be the link j
I fastening more closely the natural and
j racial instincts that are In our hearts?"
His Grace, Archblshep Lewis, spoke
! in feeling terms, expressing the deep |
and admiration of the church In i
Canada for the sister church on this ;
! side of the border.
Right Rev. Dr. O'Meara of Winnipeg,
j in behalf of the clergy of the Canadian
i West, and J dge McDonald, the lay j
| representative from Canada, spoke in i
I the same strain.
Rev. Morgan- Dlx of New York, chair- <
\ man of the House of Deputies, closed j
; the exchange of cordiality. He. too,
! noted how the progress of events was j
bringing together those who speak the j
English tongue in an inseparable union !
of heart and hand.
The Joint session was then continued I
! to consider the subject of mission re
i ports.
The House of Depjuties, sitting sepa
| rately from the Bishops, did consider
able routine business, admitting to hon
orary seats representatives from Hono- I
i lulu and Alaska and discharging the j
I committee on the proposition to create :
[ a northern diocese in California.
To-night the members of the council j
were received by the President and j
Mrs. McKinley.

TROUBLE AT MANZAMLLO
COLONEL RAY MARCHES HIS
MEN IJSTTO THE CITY.
Invaders Line TJp for Action Before
They Take Possession of
the Spanish. Bar

Special Dispatch to The Call.
MANZAXILLu, Oct. 7.â This will be
a day long to be remembered in the his
tory of Manzani'.lo. A fight was r.ar
rouiy averted between th = Spanish gar
rison under Colonel Parron and the
United States, under Colonel Ray â one
battalion of the Third Immune?, who
have arrived here from Santiago to
take possession o: the city.
The arrival of the Americans had
taken the Spanish commander by sur
prise, and he had represented to Col
onel Ray that he had received word
General Blanco Informing
that the date for the American o.cupa
tion had been postponed to Octooei +j.
He requested Colonel Hay to cab.c (ox
additional instructions. Ihe latter con
sented to do so and sent a dispatch to
General Law ton at Santiago.
At . o'clock this morning Colonel
Ray, not having heard from General
Lawton to the contrary, sent word by
Adjutant Collins to Colonel Parron
that, in accordance with his instruc
tions, he should march his men to the
city from the doi_K a mile away, where
the transport had moved at the re
quest of Colonel Parron, and would
take possession of the public buildings
m the name of the colonel.
At S o'clock the battalion was In
motion, with colors flying. Colonel Ray
marched toward the city, but before
the troops reached the city gate Ad
jutant Collins arrived with Colonel
Parron's reply. The letter said he had
no objection to surrendering the cus
tom house at once, provided the Ameri
can flag was not raised. Colonel Ray
retorteu that the United States was not
accustomed to takm? possession with
out displaying the insignia of its sov
ereignty.
The march was then continued to
ward the city. When the troops
paaed the guard at the gate â a body of
twenty-live â the latter lined up and
saluted. The report soon spread
through the city that the Americana
had arrived with colors flying, and the
streets were soon thronged by appar
ently the whole population, men.
women and children turning out by
thousands as the regiment marched to
ward the principal square, where it
haited.
At this point a Spanish bugler
sounded the call to arms, and the Span
ish garrison turned out to the number
of L'jO men on the other side of the
square. Colonel Ray visited Colonel
Parron at the palace, and a somewhat
stormy interview took place between
them, with the aid of an interpreter.
Colonel Parron said the American
troops must be removed at once. I
nei Ray refused and Parron said he
wc-uld use force. Ray answered: "If
you wish to precipitate further hostili
ties with the United States, I am un
able to prevent it. But so far as I am
concerned, I have certain orders, which,
as a soldier, I am bound to carry out.
I appreciate the position in which y.iu
find yourself, but am unable to help
jrou. If the United States troops are
fired upon I believe the men who are
with me are quite able to take care of
themselves, even though a little out
numbered, and although I am opposed
to a useless waste of life. I shall face
the issue in any way it suits you."
After considerable discussion and
many requests on the part of Colonel
Parron that Colonel Ray should take
his men out of the city until General
Blanco could be communicated with, it
was decided not to take action until the
cable office should be closed at 6 o'clock j
this evening, Colonel Ray asserting
that If by that time no further instruc
tions had been received he would take
action immediately before nightfall.
On leaving the palace the two col
onels walked to the square, where they
arrived just in time to prevent a col
lision between their forces. It appears
that some Spanish officers who had
misunderstood an order from Colonel
Parron had just notified the American
troops that they must leave immedi
ately. Captain Frost, in command dur
ing" Colonel Ray's absence, refused to
comply, whereupon he was told that the
blood of his men would be on their own
heads.
At this moment Colonel Ray came up,
and Captain Frost reported the occur
rence. -Colonel Parron promptly order
ed his over-zealous subordinate away.
It was Colonel Ray's firm intention
to take action as soon as the cable
closed, and it was evident that the sol
diers on both sides were quite ready to
try conclusions, the Spanish officers not
taking kindly to evacuation.
But some time before the cable closed
Colonel Ray received a dispatch from
General Wade explaining that the
commander of the Spanish troops at
Manzanillo had requested a delay until
October 10 and that the formal evacu
ation was, therefore postponed.
Proposed Alliance With England.
If the United States and England should form
an alliance, the combined strength would be so
! great that there would be little chance for ene
| mleÂ» to ove :ome us. In a like manner, when
) men and women keep up their, bodily strength
I with Hostetter's Stomach Bitters, there Is lit
j tie chance of attacks from disease. The old
I time remedy enriches the blood, builds up the
' muscles, steadk the nerves and Increases the
: appetite. Try It. ' â 'â - "-

A BUNKO GAME.
THE Phelan Democratic sideshow, falsely rep
resenting itself as a N on- Partisan attempt to
purify the local government, possesses the
merit of frankness at least. No concealment what
ever has been made of its purpose in the present
campaign of turning the control of the municipality
over to Mayor Phelan and the office-seekers who sur
round him. The nature of the bargain by which the
Non-Partisans have been captured is, of course,
kept in the background, but that it is advantageous
to both sides admits of no doubt. Probably it in
cludes a fair division of the spoils and a continuation
of the valuable services of Deacon Fitch as chief
vaquero in corraling Republican votes for the Demo
cratic machine.
The intrinsic value of Mr. Fitch's services in this
relation may be estimated when it is considered that
ninety out of every hundred persons who vote the
Non-Partisan ticket are Republicans. If, therefore,
the Xon- Partisans cast iooo votes on election day for
a ticket made up mainly of Democrats, it is per
ceived that 900 votes will have been delivered to the
candidates of a party which, under no other circum
stances, could have procured them. In other words,
900 Republicans will have been bunkoed into voting
for Democratic candidates upon the false pretense
that they are Non-Partisans.
For many years the party of Deacon Fitch has
been engaged in this sort of work, but not until now
has it been thoroughly exposed. Heretofore the
Democratic politicians who have manipulated it for
the purpose of getting Republican votes have prose
cuted their scheme with some respect for the de
mands of decency: but all regard for the appear
ances has this year been thrown to the winds. Boss
Phelan evidently relies upon the reputation he has
â worked up for "honÂ«sty" himself as a cloak to cover
his real designs, and he has no fear that his Non-
Partisan dupes will break away from him.
Perhaps the hollowness of Deacon Fitch's pnrty
having been completely explored, it is not necessary
to pay any further attention to it. Perhaps in no
ticing it at all we are unduly magnifying its impor
tance. Rut there is a principle at stake in the matter
which ought not to be ignored even in the confusion
of a warm campaign.
Non-partisanism as presented by Mr. Fitch's "con
vention" is a bunko game. It is designed to deliver
Republican votes to Democratic candidates upon the
theory that they will give the people better govern- |
ment than Republican candidates, when, in fact, the |
contrary is the case. Being a fraud, therefore, it is j
the duty of every respectable citizen to fight non
partisnnism. Even though the bunko steering might
not yield Phelan 500 votes, it must be remembered
that 00 per cent of the 500 will be defrauded, and no ;
stone should be left unturned to protect them. Every \
Republican candidate owes this, duty to the people j
of his party for whom Deacon Fitch's trap has been j
set.
THE CONSERVATIVE.
ONE of the best weekly publications devoted to
political and economic problems that the pro
lific press of the Mississippi Valley issues is
the Conservative, recently established at Nebraska
City, with J. Sterling Morton, ex-Secretary of Agri
culture, as editor. No periodical in the Union more
ably upholds the doctrine of sound money and honest
finance than this journal, which has its home in al
most the very center of Populism and fiat money
heresies.
In a recent number the editor set forth the object
of his publication in the brief statement: "The Con
servative is not a partisan journal. It has faith in the
ultimate triumph of everything that is just. The Con
servative is an advocate of more capital for the West
and South. Therefore the Conservative is against
all legislation unjustly discriminating against capital.
The Conservative calls to capital 'Come in' instead of
'Get out.' "
In another article is made this point, whose jus
tice will be recognized by everybody: "The redis
tribution of capital is a favorite theme with persons
who never created any capital. These men grow fer
vid depicting the injustice of that industry and self
denial which creates capital for itself instead of
creating it to bestow upon loafers and political elo
cutionists. If inanity of brains, inertia of body and
a disregard, for truth were capital some of our Sen-
ators and Representatives in Congress would be
mental and moral millionaires."
The success which Mr. Morton has accomplished
in the management of the Conservative is another
evidence of the versatility of his mind and the un
tiring energy of his faculties. He as an editor is
doing good work in educating the people of the Mis
sissippi Valley in the complex problems of politics,
economics and sociology, and bids fair to become as
eminent in journalism" as he has been in agriculture
and politics.
When Phclan predicts the end of boss rule, and
th?t he will be. elected, he is jruilty of inconsistency.
GOOD MEN TO ELECT.
AS the campaign progresses the Republican can
didates gain greater strength even than had
been anticipated. They have the advantage of
being good men. and, in many instances, the added
advantage of being opposed on the ticket by bad
men, rather, by weak men, whose only excuse for
being before the public is a yearning for office.
The list of Republican candidates is too long to
permit of each being mentioned here in detail, but it
is a list which will bear comparison with the other
side, and bear it so well that the thoughtful voter, re
gardless of party, will be impelled to support it at
the polls. It has doubtless been aided by the so
called Non-Partisans, who, after proving themselves
partisans of the narrowest stripe, withheld indorse
ment from a large share of the Republicans. It is
being helped in many other ways. The candidates
are meeting the people face to face and winning their
confidence.
At the head of the State ticket Mr. Gage is ex
posing the fallacy of single tax, a favorite scheme of
Maguire's, and demonstrating that Maguire's rail
road fight had in it a large element of that quality
commonly known as bluff. Maguire answers by
saying that the single tax is not an issue, and that
the Congressional Record lacks accuracy. Neither
arrswer is deemed adequate, and the followers of Ma
guire melt away.
Of course there is in San Francisco an accentuated
interest in the municipal fight. There could not well
be a greater contrast between two men than that
which is made apparent by a study of Patton, who
heads the Republican ticket, and Phelan, who not
only heads the Democratic ticket, but dictated every
name thereon. Patton is a citizen, called suddenly
from private life because the interests of the com
munity demanded such guidance as he could give
and such probity as he is known to possess. Phelan
is a boss. Pretending to be horrified at bossism, he
has adroitly gathered the potency of a party into his
individual hands, and hopes to control the city.
The fact has not been forgotten that the Super
visors of Phelan's selection, now in office, are a
precious lot of banded rascals, the good ones among
them being a helpless minority. It is fresh in the
public mind that the Board of Education, an un
blushing aggregation of the venal and corrupt, was
also the choice of Phelan. As in the Supervisors, so
in this board, the honest are outnumbered and
powerless. Now once more Phelan has taken the
role of dictator. Once more he has named the per
sonnel of the two bodies as Democrats hope to elect
them. What guaranty has the public that for this
second time Phelan has not picked out men who will
readily form themselves into "Solid Eights" or
"Solid Nines?" None whatever.
Incidentally, the Widber matter is also damaging
to Phelan. Widber stole because the opportunity
was at hand, and the carelessness of the Mayor af
forded the opportunity. Doubtless the Mayor never
thought that the "hefting" of coin would contribute
to the ruin of a life, the making of a felon and the
disgracing of an honored name. This possibility was
one of the things he failed to "heft." But now. with
grim justice, it weighs against him. The clang of
prison donrs on Widber will be an audible reproach
to the aspiring Mayor.
Patton has no awkward record to explain away.
Instead of reaching for the office, it truly sought him,
and found him reluctant to accept.
WILLIAM F- FITZGERALD.
BY all intelligent voters of San Francisco the
opportunity now offered of obtaining in the
office of City and County Attorney a lawyer of
such eminence and a man of such unquestioned in
tegrity as William F. Fitzgerald will be regarded as
too valuable to be lost. The support given him will
far exceed the limits of party. It will include not
only all Republicans, but all independent citizens who
appreciate the importance of the office and recognize
the necessity of filling it worthily.
Mr. Fitzgerald, after having demonstrated in his
private practice his knowledge of the law and his un
swerving devotion to duty, was appointed to the Su
preme Court, where his service, though comparatively
brief, was of exceptional merit. The record made on
the Supreme bench won for him the suffrages of a
majority of the voters when he became a candidate
for the office of Attorney-General. In that office,
which he now fills, he has added to his former high
reputation as a jurist and as an official. He comes be
fore the people of San Francisco, therefore, as a man
who has been tried and tested both in private and in
official life and has shown himself worthy of the sup
port of all.
The responsibilities of the City and County Attor
ney of San Francisco are great and onerous. Much
of the public welfare depends upon the manner in
which those duties are fulfilled. It is an office which
requires of the incumbent a wide legal knowledge, a
thorough acquaintance with the practices of the court
and a firm resolve to maintain the inviolability of
justice.
It is not often that a lawyer of Mr. Fitzgerald's
rank consents to accept this office, for the salary is not
large. It is. therefore, an evidence of his patriotic re
gard for the public welfare that he has consented to
become a candidate for the place. San Francisco will
honor herself more than him by his election, nor will
the honor be an empty one. With such a lawyer to
guard the interests of the city and county the benefits
sure to accrue will be of the highest value to the whole
community.
Here are a lot of mere generals assuming to know
something of the conduct of the war, and to possess
information to the general effect that the Hearsts
and Pulitzers of the land have been lying! The case
is simply beyond comment. Pretty soon somebody
will be declaring that when Dewey bombarded the
Manila fleet he was not acting under the direct or
ders of the yellow journalists.
Historians will never cease to regret that the cam
paign at Santiago was not conducted by Richnn!
Harding Davis. Anybody who does not believe
Davis the soldier of the generation must at the same
time doubt tb* literary worth and accuracy of that
distinguished word mechanic, aTid to do this were
treason.
The Los Angeles Times expresses the laudable
hope that in ten years that city will be as large as
San Francisco â meaning, of course, the San Fran
cisco of to-day. Even the Times knows too much
to be yearning after the unattainable.
Perhaps it would be a good plan for the Oakland
authorities to decree that cigarettes shall not be
smoked through the nose. This would teach the
consumers to taper off gracefully.
As to the investigation of the War Department,
there will be a protest the instant Alger tries to slosh
round in the whitewash bucket.
Blanco has a strike on his hands, and will prob
ably learn that a mere war is a small affair.
THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 8, 1898.
WHAT MAGUIRE STANDS FOR.
THE defense of Judge Maguire by Mr. Preble,
one of his partisans, is the severest attack yet
made on Maguire. We knew when we offered
space in our columns for an answer to our statement
of "What Maguire Stands For" that the only answer
must be an admission of the truth of our charges
and an argument to vindicate the Judge's views as
we had declared them to be.
Mr. Preble admits that Maguire in Congress de
fended the nihilists and anarchists and declared them
to be the Democrats and Republicans of Europe,
whose ''purpose is right and their cause should be
sacred to every lover of liberty and justice." Mr.
Preble says of this speech that its "every syllable
must be indorsed by enlightened citizens who believe
in the great democratic principle of political equality
and freedom." And this defender of anarchy and
Maguire adds: "Anarchy is no more a menace to
civilization than any other line of philosophical rea
soning."
Mr. Preble avows himself in sympathy with an
archy because he, too, desires to overthrow existing
things, for which he has a contempt.
No intelligent man need make any mistake about
the motives and the methods of anarchy and nihil
ism. When Judge Maguire spoke for them in Con
gress he was not in ignorance of them. They oppose
all government, no matter what its form, as Maguire
perfectly well knows. Nor are those who are se
lected to execute the death sentence "hunger-crazed
wretches," as Mr. Preble asserts. They are selected
as executioners by the council of murderers.
About a year ago anarchy was preached and taught
in San Francisco by one of its apostles, who boasted
that the assassin of President Carnot of France was
his pupil in the study of murder. Herr Most of New
York is not a hunger-crazed wretch, nor is Emma
Goldman. The anarchists who committed the mur
ders at Haymarket square in Chicago were not
driven to assassination by want. They were members
of a circle that had organized then to overthrow this
Government by murder. On their trial it was proved
by their own admissions and by written and printed
matter, of which they were the authors and distrib
utors, that they had opened a laboratory in which to
study and test fulminates and high explosives. They
had issued minute instructions to their followers for
the construction of bombs, and it was shown that the
bombs with which they killed a score of people were
manufactured in their laboratory and according to
the directions which they had printed.
It is not yet three years since one of these an
archists said in a speech in this city that the way to
human liberty lay over the dead body of the Presi
dent of the United States!
We will later on print the- platform of anarchy and
nihilism as formulated by Karl Marx and Krapot
kine.
If citizens who have something at stake, who have
an interest in law and order and who believe in gov
ernment, desire to see how rapidly the Maguire
school is approaching the danger line for our in
stitutions, they should read Mr. Preble's defense of
Maguire's defense of anarchy. Magtllre's speech in
favor of the anarchists and nihilists and Mr. Preble's
defense of it should be printed and circulated as cam
paign documents, when the people of California
have read them, let them decide whether they can
afford to elect as Governor a man who stands for
anarchy and nihilism, and is defended in it by his
supporters.
WHILE the events of the war, by demonstrat
ing the need of a short waterway between our
Pacific and our Atlantic coast, has revived
popular interest in the Nicaragua canal project and
increased the force of the demand for its construc
tion and operation under the control of the United
States, it is now evident there will be a strong oppo
sition in the field when the subject comes up in Con
gress. The promoters of the Panama canal have
come to the front, and are urging the adoption of
their route instead of that across Nicaragua.
The agents of the Panama scheme in this country
have presented the argument in favor of their line,
and it has been well received in some quarters.
They claim that their route is the logical one, that it
crosses the land where it is narrowest, presents fewer
difficulties in construction, and that a canal at that
point would be more serviceable to the general de
mands of the trade; that the time required for a
ship to pass through the Panama canal would be
only a few hours, while about two days would be
needed for the passage across Nicaragua.
Commenting upon the claim that the Panama
route is the better fitted to meet the demands of
trade, the Boston Herald says: "We fancy that this
latter statement is true with respect to all trades ex
cept that of the Western coast of this country, and
the needs of this section are so far supplied by our
own transcontinental railway systems that it is hardly
desirable to build a canal to meet the wishes of this
particular trade if the construction is of disadvantage
to all other classes of business. For Australia and
South America the Panama route is much to be pre
ferred over the Nicaragua route."
That is a peculiar statement to come from an
American paper, and it shows the extent to which
the Panama promoters have succeeded in influencing
Eastern opinion. It should hardly require any argu
ment to convince the people of the United States
that the route which will bring our Western and our
Eastern coast into the closest relation is the route
that Congress ought to fix upon. Our Government
is not particularly interested in opening a canal for
the benefit of the general trade of the world with
South America and Australia, but it has a deep and
abiding interest in the opening of one that will facili
tate the passage of warships and merchant vessels
from one side of the republic to the other.
There are other considerations that teU against
the Panama project. One of these is that of econ
omy, forit seems to be conceded the Nicaragua route
ran be opened tip for a ship canal much cheaper
than the one at the isthmus.. Furthermore, the
Panama canal is essentially a French enterprise, while
that at Nicaragua is American, and it appears the
latter would be much more completely under our
control than the former could ever be.
Both companies will press their claims upon Con
gress until a decision is reached and one or the other
is chosen. There is some reason to believe the
Panama promoters are really seeking less to transfer
their route to Congress than to head off the Nicar
agua scheme. At any rate, the opposition is becom
ing formidable, and it behooves the advocates of a
speedy beginning of the work to be on their guard
lest the controversy between the two projects should
lead to an indefinite postponement of the great and
much needed enterprise.
Some gentleman with the eye of faith has been
seeing Dunham again, this time in Southern Califor
nia. As there is no doubt Dunham killed himself
after the commission of six murders, it must be his
ghost that is so frequently discerned, and of course

REPUBLICAN OSTENTATION AND ROYAL SIMPLICITY.
Peace has Its dangers, no less than war, and victory is often to be
feared by the conquerors quite as much as by the conquered. Popular feel
ing, subject to rapid changes, as is always the case in every country gov
erned on democratic lines, has swung from one extreme to the other. The
excitement of battle is over, the glow of an easily won though complete vic
tory has inflamed men's minds, the spirit of chauvinism is in the air.
To borrow from the English a term for which we have as yet no local
equivalent, the American people have become for the nonce an excited set
of jingoes. Of course this wave of imperialist feeling will pass, as all waves
do, but it will leave behind it a sediment; our republican institutions will
emerge from the depths sadly besmirched.
What, for instance, could be more foreign to the first principles of re
publicanism than the extravagance of our Peace Commission now at Paris?
Washington, Franklin, all the great founders of our nation, rightly rele
gated ostentatious display to the courts of monarchs. When Franklin went
to Paris as Peace Commissioner in 1776 he had for suite only his young
grandson, a mere schoolboy. He had neither secretaries nor clerks. Con
gress, with extreme parsimony, re f used to make him any allowance for ne
cessary clerical work. Of course this was going too far, and as a result
Franklin's accounts were but ill-kept, and his financial transactions were
covered with confusion.
To-day, though but little over a century has passed, we are going just
as far in the opposite direction, and are striving to rival royal courts in os
tentatious extravagance. Indeed I question whether we are not surpassing
them, for there is hardly a monarchy in Europe which would have sent such
a costly Peace Commission to Paris in order to settle a matter already prac
tically arranged through the ordinary diplomatic channels. Of late years,
under the sobering influence of modern ideas, diplomatic conferences have
always been characterized by the subdued and businesslike attitude of their
members. When Beaconsfield went to Berlin, in 1878, and all the leading
statesmen of Europe drew up one of the most important peace treaties of
the century, there was no attempt on the part of any of the nations to as
tonish the others with the brilliancy of its entourage. That sort of thing
has long since been relegated to the days of barbarism, when monarchs had
no other means of impressing rivals with a sense of their importance.
The spread of education, the high average of intelligence attained by the
masses, has almost banished regal display from the courts of Europe. A
royal procession is but a mere skeleton of the glorious pageants of the
olden days, nothing more than a shadowy reminiscence. Kings and Queens
are becoming more and more like ordinary human beings, and it is per
haps only in Russia that an ignorant peasantry believes in the divine ap
pointment of its Emperor.
It is strange, therefore, that the democratic west, where the standard of
culture and intelligence is higher than in any other part of the world,
should seek to impress foreigners by the mere vulgar display of wealth.
Does any one who knows his Paris â and what good American does not? â
suppose for a moment that the luxurious habits of the American commis
sion will have the slightest effect on the minds of the people? The fact that
the Commissioners have been authorized to spend a quart jr of a million dol
lars in junketing merely shows that Uncle Sam has money to burn, and
nothing more. The thrifty Parisians will of course take the money, but they
will shrug their shoulders as soon as the American back is turned, and
scornfully wonder what sort of a republic the nation they helped to free a
century ago has become.
If the conference sat at Madrid and it were desirable to impress upon
the Spanish people the fact that the resources of the United States had
not been in the slightest degree strained by the war, the expenditure of a
few millions on idle pomp might be justifiable. But in Paris, the most
luxurious city in Europe, where the wealth of the world gathers to take
its pleasure, no one will be in the slightest degree impressed. Least of
all the Spanish Commissioners, diplomats by profession and trained to life
in courts. Indeed, they will only wonder whether the Americans have be
come intoxicated by success, and have forgotten the businesslike methods of
dealing with affairs, for which they are famous.
Of course it is impossible to return to the Spartan simplicity of Le dine
Franklin, which so impressed the pleasure-loving Parisians of Louis XVl's
day. But there is a mean in all things. It has always been the boast
of the republic that its diplomatic representatives went abroad as simple
gentlemen, wearing no gorgeous uniform nor tawdry frippery. And the ap
pearance at a diplomatic gathering of an American Embassador. clad simp
ply in the evening dress of a gentleman, was always a hundred times more
Impressive than if he had worn the most magnificent state uniform which
could be designed.
We should have gained more if we had remembered this fact, and sent
our Commissioners to Paris in the guise of practical business men. If the
members liked to take their wives, their sisters, their cousins or their
aunts with them they could have done so, but not at the nation's expense.
The clerical work of the commission, which cannot be very heavy after allj
could have been performed by half the staff. It amazes one to read the
news which was cabled in all seriousness the other day that the secretaries
and clerks were actually engaged compiling a digest of the French and
Spanish newspapers for the benefit of the Commissioners. Why couldn't
the Commissioners read the papers for themselves, and in any case, what
ha? the opinion expressed by an irresponsible French newspaper to do with
the terms upon which two great nations are to conclude peace?

for the Night.
FAILED TO FIND A VERDICT
PROSECUTION'S CASE LACKED
STRENGTH.
I~.s*r-actions on the Most Material
Points Were All Given in
â ^avor of thÂ»
Accused.
The Jury now holding in its hands the
fate of Augustus C. Widber. charged with
having embezzled $117,000 from the vaults
of the city treasury, spent the hours be
tween 10 o'clock last night until the early
hours of this morning behind bolted
doers in the S:. Nicholas Hotel, under the
â¢watchful eye of Deputy Sheriff Yaomas
F. Whelan.
All the morning yesterday District At
torney Hosmer argued on behalf of the
people. His argument concluded. Judge i
Cook proceeded to instruct the jury. The j
instructions of the court and those given j
at the instance of the prosecution and j
defense did not materially vary from the }
ordinary, except regarding the alleged !
confession. On this point the instruction I
:
In this case certain evidence has been
offered as to certain admissions or confession*
en the fart of the defendant. In this connec
tion I instruct you. gentlemen of the Jury, that
all testimony as to confessions or admissions
alleged to have been maiie by the defendant at
any time or t j any persons should be received
and considered with great caution, and are net
to be considered at all unless they were made
freely and voluntarily. In considering any such
alleged confessions or admissions alleged 10 have
been made by defendant, you should receive
and consider the same with great caution, as
there is danger c' mistake from misapprehen
sion ot the witnesses and misuse of words and
failure of the defendant, if he made s^ch state
ments, to express fcis own meaning-, and the
infirmities of memory on the part at witnesses
and the failure of witnesses to reproduce
clearly ail that was said and the surrounding
circumstances of the conversation. For these
reasons the rule, which is a dictate of reason,
ac well as cf humanity, ts that such testimony
should te received and considered with great
caution.
Regarding the condition of mind of the
accused at the time of the alleged con
fession the court instructed that "Such
testimony must be taken into considera
tion by the jury as going to the weight
or value as evidence of such statement or
confession, and if the jury believes from
all the testimony that the defendant, by
reason of the use of intoxicating liquors
or by reason of the use of dru^s or from
any other cause that the defendant was
in such a state of mind as not to under
stand or comprehend what he was stat
ing or confessing, then I charge you that
it is the law that the jury should dis
regard the statement or confession alto
gether." The court further charged
"That the defendant was not precluded
by the confession, but had the right to
offer testimony to show that the facts
set forth in the confession were not true
and that they should, especially where
there was a question as to the mental
condition, weigh such evidence with care,
and the defendant was entitled to the
benefit of the reasonable doubt as to his
mental condition, and that the defendant
cannot be convicted en his extra-judicial
confession alone."
The charge completed, the jury retired
to deliberate upon a verdict. During the
long hour? that Intervened between the
time the jury retired and the order of the
court to iook it up for the night. Wldber
spent the hours pleasantly chatting with
his counsel and a number of friends who
have remained loyal to him during th-;
trying period following his arrest. His
aged mother went to her home as the
jury f.ied from the courtroom, after re
ceiving Instructions, and did not again
return. She doubtless felt unable to en
dure the suspense in the crowd court
room, and did not want an unsympathiz
lng crowd to s~e her grrief in ths event
the jury determined that her son must
wear the felon's stripes.
This morning at 10 o'clock the Jury will
be aeain brought into court and the ques
tion a.s to whether the prisoner must
again be tried, go to prison or free will i
be determined.
MISS O'NEIL

Miss O'Neil played Canaille at the
Columbia last night and did her most
artistic work of the season ao far as it
has gone. It was a foregone conclusion
that she would be in person rather
etrapplng for the consumptive heroine,
and that her tempestuous declamation
would mar the brilliancy of the lighter
Bcenes. But from the opening of the
third act her impersonation was genu
inely emotional and surprisingly vivid
In its physical expression. The big scene
with Armand's father she acted with
what, for Nance O'Neil, was admirable
repression. She let her feelings bore
in rather than boil out. and realized a
great deal of the emotional value of the
lines; and In the scene where she writes
the letter to Armand her grief did not
find vent in a fury of sobs. She con
trolled herself as would Camille who
was capable of the sacrifice. Her fare
well to Arrnand was louder and fuller
of pose and not so convincing, but on
the whole this third act was played in
a warm human key, and there was
scarcely a dry eye to be seen in the
house when the lights "went up after it.

DR. FRYER ON
THE CHINESE
SITUATION
Interesting View of
the Orientalist.
THINKS THE EMPEROR LIVES
I
PROBABLY BEEN SUPPRESSED j
BY THE CONSERVATIVES.
Critical Conditions by Taking Ad
vantage of Which. America
May Put Russia iÂ»
the Shade.
Dr. John Fryer, professor of Oriental
languages and literature in the State
University, gave an interesting opinion
yesterday concerning the present condi
tion of affairs in China. Dr. Fryer has re
sided in China for the last thirty-five
years, thirty of which were spent in Gov
ernment service, and during that time he
ha* been intimately associated with the
leading Chinese officials In such a way
as to be kriown a3 one of the beat au
thorities upon questions relating to the
eTeat empire of the Orient.
~On the whole he is inchned to think
that the situation in Peking, precipitated
by th action of the Empress Dowager,
is not as critical is reports seem to in
dicate, and that the -whole trouble is but
a passing gust which will soon have
spent its force. With regard to the for
eign relations of China, however, he in
terprets the present course pursued by
the Chinese Foreign Office as showing
a well conceived scheme on the part of
that body â which hitherto American and
English diplomats seem to have failed
to recognize, but which, if true, should
call for immediate action on the part of
American and English statesmen. Dr.
Fryer said:
"For fifty years Europe and America
have brought their influence to bear upon
the Chinese, with the result that there
has grown up among the latter a party
bent upon reform. This party is com
posed largely of men holding extreme,
radical '.lews. Their influence has lately
been brought to bear upon the young
Chinese Emperor, and this is. at bottom,
the cause of the present trouble.
"One of their number, a mandarin
named Kang. stationed himself at Pek
ing, and there gathered around him a
group of younger officials, whom he im
bued with his Ideas. Among other books
which Kang published in the Interests
of his cause was a life of Peter the
Great. By chance a copy fell into the
hands of the young Emperor, who, cap
tivated by its pregnant suggestions of
reform associated with absolute power,
soon came under the sway of its ideas.
He strove to imitate the example of the
founder of St. Petersburg. He took as
his advisers men who were connected
with the radical party. Edict after edict
was issued, embodying changes which
could have produced nothing short of re
bellion and revolution. The situation in
the imperial city was indeed critical, and
the mere conservative among the Chi
nese statesmen viewed the outlook with
aittrm.
'Tt was at this Juncture that the Em
press Dowager was forced to move. With
a master stroke of policy, her strong arm
removed the radical party from power,
and, placing the young ruler In temporary
retire) set! the helm of state and
righted things once more. I am Inclined
to discredit altogether the reports that
the Emperor has been assassinated. I feel
convinced, as I said, that he Is merely in
temporary retirement, and before very
long will be vested with his full rights
again.
"I regard the situation, therefore, as in
no way worthy of very serious apnrehen
sion. China is not on the verge of dis
integration. Again and again in the course
of its history the country has tided over
difficulties much graver than the present,
and I feel sure that this will come out all
right In the end.
"As to foreign relations, they certainly
merit very grave consideration. The Em
press Dowager and the conservative party
generally realize that, sosner or later,
China must come under the dominating
influence of one or other of the great
powers. It Is merely a question of which.
The Chinese know that Russia* wants ter
ritory and that England and America
want trade. Which would they naturally
prefer? And yet. as long as England and
America refuse to play their part. Rus
sian influence must grow and eventually
dominate the empire. The Chinese have
no great liking tor Russia; on the con
trary, they fear her presence very much.
And this scheme of building railways is
merely a device for gaining time. The
policy of the Foreign Office undoubtedly
is to play off one great power against an
cthÂ«=r and I fear this building of railways
13 merely something dang-led before their
eves for the sake of drawing- them on.
Th*Â» condition of affairs admits of no de
lay' and I think that trade overtures
made to the Chinese Government on the
part of England and America would serve
eventually to check the power of Russia,
which the Government is only too anxious
to throw off."

An agreement baa teen reached between
prosecution and defense on a plan to get
thÂ« Botkin extradition problem before the

Chief Justice Beatty yesterday agreed
that the Supreme Court would hear the

one of the lower courts, and as this is
what Governor Budd desires he will at
once take the steps necessary to bring
the case before that body. This will
probably be accomplished by a petition of

REALISM OF A PLAY
STIRS A SOLDIER TO ACTION
A SOLDIER of the volunteer army, presumably a member of the Kansas
Regiment, created a scone at the Comedy Theater last night. The
-â¢:al of Liberty" is being produced there this week, and many of
th Idiery have attended as the guests of Alf. Eliinghouse,
the resident manager.
Havana is the scene of the play, and grim Morro Castle and the Ill
fated battle-ship Maine are each* conspicuously during its action.
Patriotism is the theme on which the play Is written. Last nig-ht the boxes
of the theater were filled with officers of the Kansas Regiment, while
several hundred of its enlisted men occupied stats on the lower floor. In
the third act of the drama, Harry O'Connor, playing the part of Captain
Mantenello of the Spanish army, and J. W. Newman that of a Cuban
have a personal encounter. They agree to fight a hand-to-hand
battle, the Spanish officer affirming that he is unarmed. The Cuban
thr ws away a knife and steps forward for the combat, when, the Span
iard shoots him.
The scene is a striking one. and Invariably strains overwrought nerves
to the breaking point. The theater la darkened at the time. Last night as
the climax was reached a soldier occupying one of the center aisle seats
Jumped to his feet. and. shouting. "Oh, you <= -oundrei:" made a dash for
the stage. He fell over Second VI " upsetting him and
nearly breaking his Instrument. The soldier, in his excitement, could not
get across the footlights.
The ushers caught him in a moment and led htm out of the theater.
As he had done no damage, he was not turned over to the police. In a few
momenta the theater was in an uproar. The ladies in the audience were on
their feet, and a panic was imminent. The lights were turnea on and or
der was soon restored. The excitement so unnerved Mr. O'Connor that
he refused to appear for the last act. The curtain was down nearly thirty
. ; Mr. O'Connor was finally prevailed upon to Dplete 1
forxnailce. The part is so uncongenial that it is said he is the thirteenth
man who has played it in the twelve weeks the company has been on the
road from Chicago. He has determined to play some other part hereafter.
"UNITY" THE
NEW HYMN
OF ALLIANCE
Sung by the Oratorio
Society.
AN INTERNATIONAL LINK
MUSIC BY AN AMERICAN, WORDS
BY ENGLAND'S LAUREATE.
A Pleasant Entertainment Before
St. Andrew's Society â Facts
About the Com
poser.
There was an evening of music in Scot
tish Hall last night, the occasion being
a reception tendered by St. Andrew's So
ciety to the San Francisco Oratorio So
ciety, and the grand feature was the
singing by the Oratorio Society of a new
international hymn entitled "Unity." The
members of St. Andrew's Society were
present in large numbers to welcome the
guests, and there were also present many
ladies. The guests of the evening, some
fifty in number, occupied seats on the
stage.
The programme opened with the rendi
tion of the "Triumphal March" from
"Xaaaan" by the guests of the evening.
J. Stuart Murdoch, a tenor, gave in
pleasing style "Gentle Zephyr" and "May
Dew," after which Miss Grace Morris
sang a contralto solo, "Bonnie Sweet
Bessie." Mrs. M. Keiley, a soprano,
charmed the audience with an old Eng
lish ballad.
Albert Daw Kerrell delivered a short
address, taking occasion to call attention |
to the growing feeling in this country and
Great Britain for an alliance between the
two countries. He said that he had for
many yean urged such an event, and
was called a dreamer. He said that the
recent war had shown there are many
more who may be classed as dreamers, j
and he expressed the hope that the time
is not far distant when such an alianee
will become an actual fact.
He then called attention to "Unity," the
international hymn, which was composed
by Alfred Austin, the poet laureate of
England. He drew attention to the fact
that while the poem was written by an :
Englishman the music was composed
by James Hamilton Howe, a native of
New England, a descendant of the first
poetess of that section of the United
States, Ann Dudley Bradstreet, daugh
ter of Governor Dudley of Massachusetts.
He said that the words of the hymn have
by the beautiful sentiment they express
attracted a great deal of attention, and j
that it i. â â â  been scattered broadcast
wherever the English language is spo- ;
ken. He then read the words, and his
reading was loudly applauded. He an
nounced that the hymn would be sung ;
by the society under the leadership of
the composer of the music, who is the
conductor of the society. He also said
that a copy of the hymn had been sent to
President McKlnley, and his acknowledg- ,
ment was daily expected.
The following are the words of the Eng
lish poet, which are described as of na
tional importance, and Heated to
Queen. Victoria and President McKlnley:
UNITY.
Answer them, sons of the self-same race, and
blood of the self-same clan.
Let us speak with each other, face to face, and
ar.-wer as can to man.
And . rally love and trust each other as none
tut free men can.
Vow fling them, fling them out to the
breeze. Shamrock. Thistle and. Rose,
And the "Star-Spangled Banner" unfurl with
these, a message to friends and foes.
Wherever the sails or peace are seen and wher
ever the war wind blow*.
A message to bond and thrall to wake, for
wherever we come, we twain.
The throne of the tyrant shall rock and quake,
and his menace be void and vain;
For you are the lords of a strong- young land,
and we are lords of the main.
Tea, this Is the voice en the bluff March gale:
"We severed have been too long;
But now we have done with a wornout tale.
the tale of an ancient wrong;
And our friendship Â»hail last long a3 law doth
last, and be stronger than death II
strong."
The family from which Mr. Howe de
scended has as descendants many who
made a mark that has been recorded
In the history of the United States. These
are William Ellery Charming. eminent
Boston divine and philanthropist: Wen-
Phillip*! celebrated as a lecturer on
Lost art and an authority on matU
state; Richard H. Dana, and the revered
poet, Oliver Wendell Holmes, who encour
aged the composer in his art work and
presented him with a photograph and
wrote several letters to nim shortly be

brought to this country was by an an

Aioiii"- Mary Howe-La vin of the Berlin
Opera- Walter H" Â»Â» Jones, head of the
School of Haste, Illinois University;
Emma Howe-Unverhau, many years pro
fessor of music Wellesley College and
also of De Pauw University, where our
composer was once dean: Charles T.
Howe, flute virtuoso, son of Ohio's fore
most historian. Many others might be
mentioned. As the national song, "The
Star-spangled Banner." was arranged by
Edward Howe Jr.. it Is an appropriate
coincidence that another representative
of the same famiiy, James Hamilton
Howe, should compose' the "International
Hymn."
The Oratorio Society sang the hymn
and was forced to give an encore, so well
pleased was the audience with the rendi
tion.
After that waa rendered the following,

NUMBER 148
FOR THE CITY
Board of Supervisors
Has It Ready.
WILL BE PRESENTED SOON
THE ONLY LABEL ON IT IS
"GAKBAGE CONTRACT."
The Merchants' Association Takes
Steps to Prevent the Municipal
ity From. Securing the
Questionable Prize.
The Board of Bupervteow will be fur-
I with Information as to the cost of
collecting garbage in other dtles. The
board itself has taken no steps in the
tfon of making inquiries, apparently
lertng it a matter of small import
ance whether the people of this city pay
more or less than 1 "â  other
dtles. The Merchants' A- -" how
is bent upon having the Super
informed on this particular point, and
yesterday sent in a communication to the
board requesting that further action re
garding the proposed garbage contract
be suspended until the Merchants' spe
cial committee could send in a mass of
data from all sections of the Union show
ing the methods and cost of collecting
garbage.
The association is going- at the matter
in a buisness-like manner, securing Infor
mation which the Supervisors should have
obtained themselves before advertising
for bids on a garbage contract. Naturally
the first question 01 men of business in
stincts Is: How much does it cost to do
such work in other cities? Not so with
the San Francisco Supervisors. As long
ago as last May the board had under con
sideration the scheme to get rid of the
scavenger - stem and to substitute con
tract work. As a preliminary Clerk Rus
sell was Instructed to send a specified list
of questions to ail large cities in the land,
asking how garbage was collected,
whether by the municipality, public con
tract or private scavengers. Not one word
was said regarding the cost in this list of
questions. Probably it was because the
Uiita were not desired.
In response to the Inquiries replies were
received from thirty-- cities, aijd are
now on file in the Clerk's office. These re
plies tabulated in a report to the board
state that scavengers only hold sway in
three cities, while the other thirty cities
have the work done by contract or by
the city authorities. This was the fact
which the interested Supervisors wanted
to be made clear to the public, although
they knew the general facts in the case
before the questions were sent out. Hav
ing established a basis for future opera
tions, the Supervisors took the next step,
which was to draw up specifications for
a private contract to do the garbage col
lecting. The public was purposely given
no information as to the cost in other
cities. What did it matter? The board
proposed to let the contract to a certain
corporation, and so worded the specifica- i
tions as to practically bar out any other I
bidder. Now the matter has reached the
critical point, where a long-term con
tract is to be executed and over a quar
ter of a million dollars of the city's funds
are to be paid out each year on an iron
clad agreement, without any previous in
formation being obtained by the Super
visors as to whether the price is moder
ate or excessive. Such Information could
easily- have been obtained by Inserting a
question to that effect in the list of
queries sent to the thirty-three cities.
Now the Merchants' Association, per
ceiving the gentleman of t color who Is
domiciled in the wood pile, proposes to I
give the Supervisors some Information on I
comparative cost in other cities, which â¢
the "board, in Its financial wisdom, has j
not seen fit to acquire.
Whether or not the Supervisor? will
consent to defer awarding the garbage
contract' to the chosen corporation Is
something that cannot be determined be
fore next Monday, when the Supervisors
meet in regular session.
SHE FEARED PRISON

looked so badly my friends hardly

OLYMPICS AND
STANFORDS
ON THE GRIDIRON
The game this afternoon between the
Oympic eleven and the representative
team of the Stanford University at the
Recreation Grounds will not afford much
of a test as to the comparative strength
of the blue and gold and cardinal elevens.
The season is a bit too early to form
Judgments on the efficiency of the col
lege teams on account of the variable
Quantities which the Olympics present-
There is as yet no solidification in the
athletic club team, as it has not found
Its measure and is in the experimental
stage.
The great surprise to football players
and enthusiasts was the showing made by
California in the game la.st Saturday.
The victory with its score, 17â0, looks
â well on its face for the people from across
the bay, but when all is told and the
proper deductions are made the result
â¢toes not appear in such brilliant colors.
team that played the college men
â was, perhaps, the weakest opposition that
has ever been offered in the way of an
athletic club eleven in many years. The
Olympics had not segregated into any
kind of a team at that time and the col
lege athletes played In a surprisingly co
herent manner. The one week they util
ized In training for the game was spent
In signal practice and the preliminary
work of the Held With the resuit which
the score shows.
As far as California Is concerned It may
fee safely said 'that never In the history
of blue and gold gridiron attainments has
bo much been accomplished in so short a
time. Cochran, if nothing else is done
for his team, has shown the people of
California that he is a coach and that he
understands the intricate and simple de
tails of the game. ill:* material was noth
ing of the remarkable order, yet lie has
unified it and laid the foundations of a
complete organization. The Idea of star
has been eliminated .and now the men
work cohesively with a common end in
View. This is what has won the victories
for Stanford In past years, and would
certainly have wrought a like success this
season "nad not a man arrived on the
scene who knows what Is needed and has
the ability to do it. The intercollegiate
game this year will be well worth the
Beting, and ii will be a test of well de
lined and organized strength and skill.
Before a real judgment can be placed
on California's eleven there must be a
contest with a much stronger team than
that which the Olympics put in the field
last week. The club lias been more than
unfortunate in the loss of Pete Smith,
their captain, who Is now laid on the
shelf for the rest of the .season. He in
lured his left shoulder last Saturday, and
before- It had entirely recovered from the
strain he recommenced playing and the
result is a disablement which will pre
clude his appearance on the gridiron until
very late In the year, practically until the
end* of the season. His position cannot
be refilled unless Hobbs will come out
something which he says Is well nigh im
possible. But that has often been told
in "football and la found wanting In truth,
for the recalcitrant player rarely stands
out when he sees his fellows In harness
and is under a lire from his friends who
â work Incessantly to have him don the '.an
vas Jacket. The loss of Smith has a more
or less demoralizing effect upon the rest
of the team, as he was a captain of rare
ability and possessed the contldence of his
rr.en. Erskine, who has succeeded him.
Is a player of dash and spirit and will
handle the team In good style.
The Olympic team is not a strong team,
and though fortified in some respects, will
not present a very strong front when it
meets Stanford this afternoon. Tom Code
will play as Quarter and this will allow
"Weldon to return to the position which he
baa played for several years. He Is a
good mar. as full back and but an indif
ferent player at quarter. This will have a
tendency to strengthen the back field,
â which, with the possible addition of Morse
and Taylor, will make a good strong quar
tet.
A new man has come out on the Olym
pics to practice, or rather an old man
who has done good service on the grid-
Iron, has come out anew. Milton W.
Franklin of the University of California
Medical School has been practicing with
the club men during the week, and if he
can regain the dash and daring he used to
display on the held in the old days he
should be an acquisition of some value to
the Olympic team.
The Stanford team is now in the hands
of Harry P. Cross, a coach who has come
before the Western public before and won
their confidence. His team of '96 proved
a winner by 20 points and gave evidences
of the strongest kind of play. He has be
gun his work systematically, and In the
course of a few weeks hopes to have the
Stanford eleven well in hand. The center
at Palo Alto is the weakest portion of the
team and will absorb the attention of the
coach for a little time. Stanford is strong
on the ends and the bocks are also men or
tried ability.
Over sixty men show up on the campus
at Stanford, more than enough to form
two games, which will undoubtedly be
done before the season has advanced far
along 1 .. The preliminary practice has giv
en way to regular games, in which the
players are changed at every interval of
rest. As soon as it is feasible Cross will
form a team and then begin to work his
men together.
A feature of. the games this year will be
the freshman contests. The freshman
classes, of both colleges are enthusiastic
over the game and are working assidu
ously toward a comparative perfection of
team play. California's freshman eleven
lias arranged for a number of games dur
ing the season. On Tuesday next they
will play the lightweight Olympic eleven,
hitherto invincible and a strong lot of
young players. In a practice game be
tween the Olympics and the lightweights
on Thursday evening the latter riddled
the former for many big gains and the
Olympics proper scratched their heads
and wondered. On Saturday next the
California freshmen will meet the Santa
Rosa High School eleven. Stanford fresh
men have also arranged a scries of games
before the intercollegiate freshman game
on October 21.
Cochran is putting his men through .1
practice that is gradually developing Into
the regulation hard practice game. Cad
wallader appeared on the field In the be
ginning of the week and it is thought
that he will cast his fortunes, with the
California eleven and sacrifice his chances
for the Yale team of '99. He has been
playing guard and his presence lends
both support and strength to the rest of
the team. Some notable Improvements
have been made in individual playing but
the general character of the past week's
work shows a slight improvement In team
work and the Indications point toward
tome good ball from the blue and gold this
year.
The Olympic line has been changed con
siderably. In the game to-day Sheeny
will be in his old position, right guard
Billy McLalne, formerly of Stanford and
a crack player, will be on the left ex
tremity of the line. The backs, with the
exception of Code and Weldon, are un
known quantities.

NORTHERN DUCKS
ARRIVE
WITH THE STORM
The rainstorm of last Sunday morning
put a damper on the fondest anticipations
of the firet-Sunday-ln-the-year sportsmen.
The undergrowth was too wet for quail
shooters to enjoy the pleasures of the
chase. The heavy downpour of Sunday
morning soaked everything in touch, not
excepting the unfortunates who had
camped out with the sole purpose of being
among the quail "bright and early" on
the first holiday of the season. But the
quail-shooters had companions who fared
worse, and they were caught by the rain
king just as they had reached their
"blinds" and were patiently awaiting the
first light 'of day to open lire on the
northern invaders.
It was about 5 a. m. when the sky dark
ened ominously about the Suisun marsh
es, and presently the rain fell in torents.
Few sportsmen anticipated a wetting,
consequently there were many soaked and
disgusted trigger-pullers on the return
home that evening with empty pockets
and an abundance of experience.
The members of the Black Jack Gun
Club, whose headquarters are located on
Sherman Island, fared very well on the
opening day (Saturday), but the storm
evidently disturbed the birds, and very
few broadbllls were In evidence on Sun
day President Lemmer, whose good luck
in* duck-shooting is proverbial,^ bagged
something like thirty birds on Saturday
morning and would assuredly have
smashed duck bones "to the queen s
taste" .m the Sabbath day had there been
anything animate about with feathers on,
excepting, of course, the royal flam
beau," which bird, according to Black
Jack - rules, can be shot only by James
Markland, the club's royal secretary.
Richard Flukes, a gunner who never
shot less than 100 ducks at a sitting, ielt
rather bilious on Sunday morning when
he entered his tule-splitter. and asa result
he paid his best respects to Professor
Mud! Though rather annoyed by his^^in
voluntary bath at such an early hour,
he managed, with the assistance of will
Nve and "the Indian. 11 to regain his equi
librium and a fresh start was made for
the 'duck ponds. Flukes subsequently had

Owing to the late dry season, market

Francisco club. Already very nearly JfiOOO
has been subscribed by the Incorporatora,
and it will not be many days before the
foundation is laid for a handsome house
with all the modern appointments. The
grounds will receive an overhauling and
the links will be laid out anew. The mem
bers of the San . Francisco Club promise
some interesting tournaments for the win

SOUND ADVICE
TO THE
LOCAL PLAYERS
There Is one play always executed in
the same manner to which I wish to call
particular attention. It is a play unsur
passed for simplicity; one that should
never be permitted to exist in the gamt
at Recreation Park, and that I have in
tended to criticize ever since the consoli
dation.
The play In question has been consum
mated In the same manner by all teams
since the beginning of the season. It has
never been played properly yet, although
every player Is acquainted with the man
ner in which to go about it, which fact,
by the way, reflects no credit on the more
exalted individuals, made so conspicuous
of late by their "off days," and lack of
base hits.
With a runner on the initial base, or
first on third, the first mentioned gentle
man is continually permitted to pilfer the
second cushion. About once In twenty
times some half-hearted attempt 1? made
to catch him while he is pllierlng this
base, but it always ends unsuccessfully,
owing principally to the amount of diffi
dence displayed on the pan of those con
ducting the play-
Sometimes the catcher will throw to
second in the hope of drawing on th 3
third base runner; sometimes he will
throw to the pitcher for the same pur
pose; sometimes he will, by a quiet move,
endeavor to deceive this man on third by
making what is termed a bluff throw to
second, but hardly ever does he attempt
to really catch that man running from
lirst to second. He Is allowed to steal
that base without being molested, and the
Idea seems to prevail that he cannot be
caught without the man on third scoring.
The idea, permit me to say, Is horribly
wrong. A runner on third can score, if
the play breaks properly for him, but he
takes a very big chance every time he
starts. In fact, if the play be perfect, he
cannot score, nor can that rran on first
.steal second. The simple fact of there
being n runner on third does not in any
READY FOR THE CHASE.
Country Club Sportsmen Leaving for the Preserved Shooting Grounds

sense change the situation. In the Na
tional League It is much harder to pilfer
second, with a man on third, than It la
otherwise.. I know that when "handling
the mystic" myself I always paid more
attention to a runner on first than I did
when there was one on third. I knew
he would steal on the very first chance,
and consequently I would work in con
junction with the catcher for this man
only.
However, the slightest mistake and all
is lost. The players in the major league
make this play in the same manner as do
those of tne Pacific Const League, the
difference being that the first mentioned
make the play properly and go about
their work with confidence.
When the runner on first starts for sec
ond the second baseman and shortstop

about fifteen feet In front of the other.
Now, the one in advance, Instead of let
ting the ball pass on to the base. Invaria
bly catches it. and stands stupefied with
thf ball In his hand, without an oppor
tunity to make a play.
The difference in the two leagues lies
In the fact that in the National the men
making this play almost always allow the
ball to pass to the base and play for the
runner endeavoring to steal. They have
a superfluity of confidence in their ability
to return the ball to the plate should the
man on third attempt to run home, and
it is this confidence which enables them
to consummate plays successfully.

CRICKET WILL BE
PLAYED AT LAREPORT
At a meeting of the California Cricket
Association held on Wednesday at the
office of the secretary permission was ac
corded to the Placer County cricketers
to play against the Lakeport and Sun Jose
cricket clubs. The Placer County citrus
colony eleven will play at Lakeport on
October 18. 19 :nd 20. On October 21 they
reach San Francisco and play a one day's
mntcli against the Alameda Club (cham
pions of ISO';) on October 22. Next day
they will try conclusions with an eleven
of the Pacific club. On the 24th and 2&lh
they hope to play against an eleven <>f
San Jose, either at San Jose or Alameda.
As there is no suitable ground at San
Jose, It is not unlikely that the San Jose
men will come up to San Francisco.
To-morrow, on the Alameda ground, the
third and deciding Banks and Insurance
versus All-Comers match will be played,
the two previous games having been
played on July 24 and Aupust 21. On July
24 the Banks and Insurance men defeated
All Comers with a score of 87 against 2S,
for though All Comers made 110 runs for
eight wickets in their second innings, the
match was decided on the first inning', on

YACHTS CRUISE
UPON THE
BILLOWY OCEAN
The prize cups, class flags and certifi
cates of merit won at the Pacific Inter
club Yacht Association's third annual re
gatta on Admission day will be pre
sented to the owners of the winning
yachts on Thursday evening, October
13, in the assembly hall of the Mills build-
Ing.
The San Franciscos will probably give
a Jinks at their club house on the night
of the closing day but its date is not yet
settled.
The injury to the Truant from colli
sion with the yawl Articus can be read
ily repaired. She has been taken on the
"ways," and a new rudder will be put In.
As the tide runs out in the morning
and floods in the afternoon, several
yachts will take a cruise outside the
heads to-morrow. On October 15 the Cor
inthians sail to El Campo, where next
day a small yacht regatta and nautical
games will be held. The South Bays he
ing anxious to try Auzerais and Smith's
sloop Papoose against the 25-footers of
the clubs around San Francisco, Com
modore AVesterfeld has promised that, if
three or four yachts will enter, the Cor
inthians will provide starting guns, set
out stakeboats and take times. A race
between Papoose, Mistral, Merope, Phoe
nicia and Cupid should prove decidedly
interesting.
The sloop Emma, with C. G. and Mrs.
Taylor, and the new sloop Gladys, with
Hobron and his nephew, have gone on
an up-river cruise.
J. V. O'Rrien. F. M. Thornton, W. C.
Howe and E. F. Sager are the committee
in charge of the closing day jinks..
A. M. Clay of the California Yacht
Club has bought the sloop Sam Vincent,
giving the Sea Fox in part payment.
The Encinals are holding a bowling
tournament and a handicap billiard tour
nament, the entries to which closed at
10 p. m. September 30. A handsome cue
hap been presented by the Brunswick
Balke-Collender Company, to be given to
the winner of the billiard tournament.
Last Saturday afternoon the Encinal di-
rectors, who have been much annoyed by
persons not members of the club
opening the gate and using its quarters
put a new lock on the premises. Mem
beis have been supplied with keys to the
new lock, and have been requested to
hand over all keys to the old lock to the
secretary or the boat-keeper.
William Harrison and pp.rtner have
bought T. L. Miller's sloop Idler, and will
add her to the Encinal tleet. The yawl
Emerald has returned from a two weeks'
fishing and hunting- trip up the fiver,
and the Bloop Fawn has just started on
an up-river cruise.
The Californias cruise to-night to
North Beach cove, and to-morrow will
Ball outside the heads. They will have
a closing jinks for members at the club
house on Saturday, October 29, and a
final cruise next day.
The South Bays go out upon a hunting
cruise to-morrow, and close the season
on the 30th.
VAMPIRE FOOTBALLERS.
Association Practice Game Will Be
Played on the Golden Gate
Ground To-Day.
This afternoon the members of the
Vampire Association Football Club will
hold their first practice game of the sea
son on the ground nt Golden Gate. The
following players will take part: G. T.
S. White. C. P. Coles, J. McOaw. J. D.
Robertson, H. W. Dye. J. J. R. Peel, H.
Bird, H. W. Westerfeld, A. F. Chambers,
T. W. G. Wallace. H. Punnett, J. Myers.
P. A. Crump, L. J. C. Anderson, Clausen,
Fry, Harris, Charles Rieveley and J. M.
Punnett. Sides will be picked up by G.
T. S. White and J. McGaw.
Next Saturday the Vampires will play
the first match of the season at the Pre
sidio against a team of cavalrymen of
the Fourth Regiment and Washington
volunteers.
A regular schedule of games to be
played during the season will be ar
ranged, and at the end of the present
month, when the cricket season is over,
the Webster ground at Alameda will be
secured by tho footballers. There will
probably be five teams, and play will go
on until about the middle of March of
next year. An effort will be made to
arrange a few games against teams of
players from Stanford and the University
of California, so as to attract the atten
tion of collegiate football players to the
game, and to introduce it to the notice
of the general public. Comparatively
few people on this coast have ever seen
a game of association football or have
any idea of Its special and peculiar fea
tures. _^_______^__
The Valentine Insolvency.

yesterday granted a temporary Injunction
In the case of Blake, Moffitt & Towne. L.
H. Bonestell and C. H. Bonestell and the
American Type Founders Company vs.

FIRST-CLASS DOGS
WILL RUN AT
INGLESIDE PARK
The late rains have converted the In
gleside coursing sward, late of somber
color. Into what now has the apearance
of a beautiful emerald carpet. Great,
therefore, should be the coursing of to-
day and to-morrow.
The card presented by the Ingleside I
Club Is truly excellent, as a large num
ber of high class dogs figure among the
entries for this afternoon's meeting.
Among the ."flyers" of high degree may
be mentioned the recently celebrated dog
Rock Island Bay, winner of two stakes
within two months subsequent to his ar
rival from the East. The Boy recently
sustained a severe injury, which was
occasioned by a bite from his kennel mate
Meta, who herself is by no means a lady
to be overlooked when contesting in the !
best of company.
Acording to the trainer of Rock Island
Boy the dog has vastly improved in
health and spirits, and will doubtless cut
up the new grass in the park in the most j
approved style this afternoon, if com- j
pelled to extend h.mself. The Rock is
being played well in the poofs to win the
stake, and although as good and as true
as a greyhound should be to command
the respect and admiration of leashmen.
his admirers must not forget that "there
are others."
Mialmo, Patria, Brllliantine, Quick
Stitch, Mayflower, Flying Faster and
Soubrette are very dangerous rivals, and
any of them â perhaps a dark horse, for
that matterâ may capture the winning
colors from the crack Eastern dog when
a turn in the tables is least expected.
Horse racing is bad enough as a gam
bling proposition, but In coursing, which
is by far the most honest sport, there is
nothing which in the lexicon of the sport
can be called "dead."
How often have you heard the remark
"that's a cinch." and how often have
you subsequently learned that the
"cinch' failed to cash? But although
there are many "good things" in cours
ing as Â«r/ell as there are in other games,
"ciccnes, 1 as a rule, should be avoided,
as they more frequently assist to burn
"rather than coat the pockets of specu
lative sports.
Yes, the.re should be rattling good sport
at Ingleside to-day, and it goes without
saying that the patrons of the game who
will witness the rundown can rest as
sured of returning home thoroughly
pleased with their outing.
Brilliantine is a dog of very high
breeding that is rapidly improving and
may be heard from to-day. Quick
Stitch, an Eastern dog that put in an
appearance for the first time last Sun
day, will surprise the talent to-day if in
food form physically. Mayflower was not
eeling well when she ran in the Pro
duce stake, but if report is correct she
will cut a dash to-day. An eye should
be kept on Flying Faster, and also on
the speedy Soubrette.
John Grace Jr. left yesterday afternoon
for Los Angeles, where he will remain
under engagement to the Los Angeles
Coursing Club^ to judge meetings held
on Sundays. The young judge of cours
ing has proved that he is a chip-of-the
old-block, and it can be safely said that
the southern leashmen wil be highly
pleased with his decisions.
The Ingleside Coursing Club will meet
on the great plains of Merced on No
vember It!, at -which time the hares will
not be too fat nor too thin, but just good
enough after one month of chewing on
young grass to give the hounds all they
will require in the way of hard exercise.
During last year's meeting the plains
were barren of any kind of vegetation,
and as a result the hares were in condi
tion to run over miles of country at
top speed. The dogs suffered from the
long and gruelling courses to such an
extent that those who did not die were
laid up for several weeks, but the condi
tions will be different this year.
DOGS SAVED FROM THE
LUCAS KENNEL FIRE
The establishment of the Pacific Ken
nel League engrosses the attention of all
the local fanciers and. it may truthfully
be said, of Eastern dogdom. Opinions
vary widely as to Its opportunism, and
equally so as to its duration. The of
ficers elected are men of irreproachable
standing and reputation, but the consti
tution and rules as adopted give rise to
grave doubts as to their wisdom in de
parting so widely from customs which
experience has taught are based on com
mon sense principles.
So far the San Francisco, Pacific Fox
Terrier, Mastiff, Oakland Kennel and St.
Bernard clubs persist in their allegiance
to the American Kennel Club, and it Is
difficult to perceive how the new league
will manage to make headway while five
of the most important clubs on the coast
remain outside of the fold.
The meeting of the Pacific Coast Field
Trials Club is scheduled to take place on
the 22d inst. Henry Keller, the presi
dent, is coming up from Los Angeles to
attend it and will be accompanied by
John Schumaker, the owner of Valiente.
Lovers of the dog will learn with pleas
ure that the destruction by fire of Mr.
Lucas" kennels at San Rafael did not in
volve as large a number of canines as
at first reported, although, as it was, the
loss of lite was too heavy. Those de
stroyed were an English setter bitch with
a litter of seven pups, and besides these
three young dogs between six and twelve
months old.
Th<> Fresno fanciers are making efforts
to form a kennel club, and propose to
hold a show in January. It is as yet un
decided as to whether the show "will be
held under American Kennel Club rules
or under those of the Pacific Kennel
League. A majority of the Intending
members appear to favor the idea of
standing in with the San Francisco and
Oakland clubs, and thus securing recog
nition of the wins over the entire United
States, instead of being contented with a
more limited appreciation.
WALSH FAMILY TROUBLES.
A Wife Chased by Her Husband
With an Ax to Shed Blood.
The preliminary examination of James
Walsh, a laborer living on Athens street.
Silver Heights, on the charge of assault
to murder, was held before Judge Mogan
yesterday. Mrs. Walsh and her daughter
testified that Walsh had been drunk for
three weeks, and about a week ago he
chased his wife with an ax. threatening
to kill her. He then chased the daughter
out of the house and tried to strike her
with a heavy piece of wood.
Mrs. Walsh keeps a grocery on Athens
street, and told the Judge that she had
been able to save $3000 and pay for the
house where they lived. It was Jointly
in her and her husband"s name. She did
not wish to prosecute him if he would
only let her alone, and she would even be
willing for him to get all the money. The
Judge insisted on the case going on, and
will probably hold Walsh to answer to
day.
Walsh's friends were out in force and
insinuated that the wife and daughter
were prosecuting the husband to get him
sent to San Quentin bo that they could
obtain possession of the property by the
wife securing a divorce.
Chareed With Grand Larceny.
Edward Goldenson was arrested yes-
terday afternoon on a warrant charging
him with grand larceny. He is acused
by Deputy Sheriff Ortelli of stealing a
horse and wagon which had been at
tached by Ortelli. The warrant was is-
Bued from Judgo Mogan's court.
Permission to Foreclose.
The Mutual Savings Fund and Loan and
Building Association was granted permis
sion yesterday by United States District
Judge Hawley to foreclose a mortgage for
S3oov on the property of H. O. Steams,
bankrupt. \
OARSMEN WILL
ENJOY
SMOOTH WATER
All the rowing clubs will be represented
at the Guerneville regatta. On the first
day, October 16, Dr. v. C. Dennis of the
South Ends, C. Ochs of the Pioneers and
F. Wilson of the Arlels will pull in the
first heat of the skiff race. In the second
heat will be A. Webb of the Alamedas,
V. Caglieri of the Dolphins and Fickert
of the Ariels. T. R. Keenan of the Dol
phins and H. A. Wittkopf of the Ariels
will try conclusions in shells, for which
the smooth water of Bohemian Lake is
eminently suitable. There will be a barge
race between the Ariels, South Ends and
Pioneers; a canoe race between represent
atives of the Pioneers and the Dolphins,
and a tug-of-war in boatsâ Pioneers ant
Ariels vs. Dolphins and South Ends.
On Sunday, October Hi, C. Ayers of tha
Alamedas and W. O. Patch of the Dol
phins will row against the winner of uiie
of the previous skift' heats, and J. Schup
pert of the Tritons against the winner uf
the other. The Alamedas, Dolphins and
Olympics will then pull in barges, the
winner to niett the winning crew of bat
urday's race.
The polo team of the Lurhne Swimming
Club will be captained by U. Widemanu.
and the Olympic team by A. W. Pape.
Of the skiff men, Dennis. Ochs and Wil
son are well prepared, and Avers ana
Patch will have to pull hard to beat the
best of the three. J. Schuppert will be
the first Triton man to appear in a re
e< The' Ariels will send their Intermediate
barge crew, with R. Ellis in the place of
G. Stefft-ns; the Pioneers will send a
strong four, and the Alamuda seniors will
be on hand.
At a special meeting of the Olympic
Boat Club, held on Tuesday evening, it
was decided that the captain should be
instructed to have the barge moved from
Tiburon over to the Dolphin buathouse, of
which the Dolphins have kindly offered
the use, so that the Olympics may be able
to get some practice on week day even
ings. The barge is to be repaired, var
nished and put in order. The following
were appointed a committee on nomina
tions of officers for the coming year: J.
Cunningham, Leo Pockwitz and H. \\ .
George James, captain of the Olympio
Club has called a cross-country run for
to-morrow. The runners will take the 8
o'clock morning boat, and starting from
the boathouse at Tiburon will run alone
Raccoon Straits over the hills to El
Campo and return by way of Belvedere.
Lunch will be served at the boathouse,
and a crew may be made up for tha
championship races.
The members of the Alameda Boat Club
have been out on the estuary a great deal
of late Some have had fine sport trolling
for striped bass. W. Q. Hansen caught
one 33 inches long, weighing 13 pounds.
Two or three members of the Univer
sity of California Boating Association ara
practicing In skiffs, and one of these may
enter the championship skiff race. Ow
ing to their distance from a body of water
suitable for rowing it is not possible to
do much at Stanford in the way of boat
ing, and the University Boat Club at Palo
Alto Is no longer in existence.
The South Ends have purchased an out
rigged skiff from Kennison. R. McArthur
has tried it and thinKs it one of the best
boats he ever sat in. It is very light. It
will probably be taken up to Guernevilla
and used by Dr. C. C. Dennis.
The old barge Blister will be taken to
the Russian River and manned by a crew
composed of T. I. Fitzpatrlck. Al Fritz,
M. Breen and E. Shortall, with either
Fitzpatriek or Fritz as stroke. The junior
barge crew will go into regular training
next week for the championship regatta.
The South End Club will hold its annual
high Jinks on the afternoon of November
6, after the championship regatta. The
"Midgets"' will probably row in the cham
pionship rarge race.
In the absence of T. J. Kennedy, cap
tain, A. W. Pape is in charge of the Dol
phin Boat Club, and is keeping the inter
mediate barge crew hard at work. Every
night the crew rows three miles, from the
boathouse to Lombard street wharf and
return. Besides this they do gymnastic
work. The crew is in excellent trim, and
the four that beat it will be a good one.
A. W. Pape is getting up a junior barge
crew for the championship race's. It Is
made up of Charles? Roach, F. Woernner.
J. S. Earls and L. Duncan. These rowed
last Sunday to Sausalito and thence to
Tiburon. where they visited the ark Mi
kado. Victor Capllerl and A. W. Pape will
go up next Friday to Guerneville to .take
part In the swimming and canoe races on
Saturday.
A performance will be given to-night at
Union Square Hall for the benefit of thÂ©
parents of the late Daniel D. Connolly,
thp well known oarsman nnd member of
the South End Kowing Club. Profes
sional talent has been enjraped. George
Green and Frank McConnell will box four
rounds, with R. ivi^Arthur as referee. W.
A McGrill. Jack O'Brien. D. F. Sullivan
and J. Foley are on the committee in
charge of the affair. The Young Men's
Institute and Native Sons of the Golden
West will also assist.
FOOTBALL AT THE PRESIDIO.
On Sunday there will be a match game
of football at the Presidio athletic

On learning this the classic features of
William look on an ashen hue, and with
a tragedian-like tread he visited the
stand and delivered himself of an ad
dress. He told the judges his views on
running- a racetrack, why this Govern
ment should hold the Philippines, the
many valuable qualities of Henry T.
Gage, candidate for Governor, and all so
liberally sprinkled with adjectives strong
enough to make "Fighting Bob" Evans
â¢wince that the officials increased the fine

man Durfee, and he mentioned a place
where the inhabitants wear lighter ap
parel than the people of Yuma, and told
the judges to make it ?10Q if they liked.
They acquiesced by ruling Mr. Durfee off
the turf for life.
In the following heats of the race Dur

better advantage.
The friends of Mr. Durfee claim that
he was doing his best, and circumstances
point that way. However, hoodlumisn:

ruling, though severe, appears a just one.
The attendance was better, and the
number of bookmakers laying prices de

more coin in circulation. It was hard to

a twenty-five-round bout at 142 pounds
and although McKeever stayed the full
limit the bout was one-sided and all in
Smith's favor. McKeever was heralded
as a more dangerous proposition than
Smith had ever tackled, but his show
ing was a great disappointment, as he
wus at no time capable of making an
impression upon the "mysterious"
b<>xer, who knocked him off his feet in
the twenty-third and twenty-fifth
rounds. The attendance was far above
the average.
The "mysterious" boxer boxed twen
ty-live rounds with Jim Judge at Scran
ton, Pa., last Monday night and
knocked out his man in the last few
seconds of the final round. After such
a contest most pugilists would have
Uik'-n a rest of a few weeks before en
gaging in another bout, but "Billy"
turned up at the club house to-night
looking as lit as If hu hud not boxed in
two months. He was the favorite at
100 to 80.
In the fifth round McKeever landed
a left on the face, making Smith's nose
bleed. Throughout the bout Smith
pounded his man heavily in the wind
and ribs and over the kidneys, while
McKeever played for the face. Both
men drew blood in the eighth. In the
fifteenth Smith planted a terrible right
on the stomach and put a straight left
6n the face. Mac raised his knee to the
body, but the referee said it was an
accident.
When the last five rounds began
Smith was as fresh as ever, while Mc-
Keever, though plucky, was evidently
much weakened from his punishment.
In the twenty-third round Smith swung
his right on the Jaw and McKeever
dropped to the lloor. He got up quickly
and hugged his man until the referee
pulled them apart. "Hilly" rushed mat
ters in the twenty-fourth, but the- bell
came to McKeever's rescue. In the last
round Smith knocked McKeever clean
off his pins with a right swing on the
jaw, but the Philadelphian was up
within three seconds. "Billy" tried hard
to get his right over to the mark, but
could not land it and Mac lasted the
limit.
The referee awarded the bout to
Smith.
FITZSIMMONS ORDERED
FROM GILSE* HOUSE
Made to Suffer Because of the Recent
Corbett-McCoy Imbroglio
in the Hotel.
NEW YORK, Oct. 7.â James H. Breslin,
proprietor of the Gilsey House, this after
noon faced the delicate task of refusing
a meal to Robert J. Fitzslmmons at his
hotel. Fitzsimmona entered the hotel at
about 3 o'clock. He looked curiously at
the spot where the Corbett-McCoy im
broglio took place, and then walked into
the men's dining-room. Several men in
the corridors recognized him and in some
way his presence in the house was made
known to Mr. Bresliu.
"1 dv not wish you to dine here," said
Mr. Breslin to the champion. "I shall be
very much obliged if you will leave. I
cannqt permit my employes to serve you."
A trace of color tied to "Fitz's" cheek,
but he kept his seat and answered stead
ily enough:
'1 am now an ordinary citizen. There
i - nothing in my conduct at present to
i take me objectionable to any one here.
Why do you bar me?"
"I do not wish your trade," said Land
lord Breslin. "l'ou will oblige me by leav
ing. "
"Fitz" protested again, saying that he
considered it unfair treatment, but Mr.
Breslin was obdurate and the big fellow
finally arose and reached for his hat. He
walked into the corridor and out to the
main entrance, where he stood for a few
seconds and then strode down Broadway.

Women in Business.
From the Free Press. Detroit. Mloh.
A prominent business man recently ex-
pressed the opinion that there is one
thing- that will prevent women from com-
pletely filling man's place in the business
worldâ they can't be depended upon be-
cause they are sick too often. This is
refuted by Mrs. C. W. Mansfield, a busi-
ness woman of 58 Farrar street, Detroit,
Mich., who says:
"A complication of female ailments
kept me awake nights and wore me out.
I could get no relief from medicine and
hope was slipping away from me. A
young lady in my employ gave me a box
of Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale Peo-
ple. I took them and was able to rest at
night for the first time in months. I
bought more and took them, and
they cured me, as they also cured
several other people to my knowl-
edge. I think that if you should
ask any of the druggists of Detroit,
who are the best buyers of Dr. Williams'
Pink Pills, they would say the young
women. These pills certainly build up
the nervous system, and many a young
woman owes her life to them.

EXTENDS TO ALL
BUILDING TRADES
Spread of the Strike of
Paris Workmen.
SIXTY THOUSAND MEN OUT
WORK ON EXPOSITION BUILD
INGS HAS CEASED.
Police, Troops and Mounted Repub
lican Guards Called Out to
Quell the Dis
orders.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Oct 7.â The strike of the la
bcrrers here has extended to nearly all
the building trades, and It is feared the
railroad men will join in the movement.
Work on the exhibition buildings and
underground railroad has completely
ceased. About 60,000 men have gone out
on strike, and the situation is causing
consternation. The attitude of the strik
ers is increasingly aggressive, and
fights between strikers and so-called
"black legs" are incessant, involving the
intervention of the police, troops and
mounted republican guards, who have
been obliged to repeatedly charge on
the strikers. The quarters in which the
rioting has taken place are patrolled by
strong detachments of police and
troops.
There are great apprehensions lest the
agitators turn the strike movement to
political ends.
The Temps declares that the ieaders
of the men are aiming at a general
strike, if not at a revolution, and
points out what a dreadful thing it
would be if the Exhibition of 1900 is
compromised.
The latest news this morning is that
the Municipal Council and the contrac
tors have come to an agreement re
garding- the demands of the laborers,
and hopes are expressed that the strike
will end in a few days.
But in spite of the hopes entertained
of a termination of the strike more men
struck to-day and numerous bands vis
ited various works for the purpose of
forcing men to join in the strike. The
police dispersed these bands and ar
rested a number of leaders of the dis
turbers. Additional reinforcements of
troops have been drafted into the city
from outlying garrisons.

DENVER, Oct. I.â Simon Guggenheim

ernor It is understod that a fusion on

FASTEEN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
.<F.V,' YORK, Oct. 7.â The stock market con
tinued narrow and professional to-day, and
even the Industrial specialties, which have
ehown violent fluctuations and feverish activity
for some time past, fell into comparative quiet
ude. The Industrials, nevertheless, continued
to occupy the most prominent place In the
trading. The movement of prices In this group
was conflicting the early part â â ' the trndmg,
but the reactionary tendency Rained the upper

the earlier gains. Sugar was less active than

heaviness of the general market. Metropoli

late dealings to 153V4! People's Gas and Brook

Btrength, but succumbed in the late dealings,
the latter showing a net loss of l*%. Tobacco.
Consolidated Gas, Cleveland, Loral n and
Wheeling preferred. Reading first preferred,
Pacific Coast and a number of other special
ties were notably weak. In the railroad list
the m .st notable feature was the continued
large offerings of Northern Pacific and the
poor absorptive power of the stock showi by
the market.
The opening was at a decline of % In spite
of the fact that It was the one American stock
which showed an advance In London. Th i

German holders, but the burden of liquida

LONDON MARKETS.
NEW YORK, Oct. 7.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stork
market here was quiet and dull to-day, politics
and the monetary position In Berlin being the
ihle:' factors. The latter especially affected
American rails, notably Pacific stocks, and the
close In this market was about the lowest.
Argentines, Spanish 4s and other foreign se
curities were generally flat.
The decline in Consols is said to he partly
due to the Bank of England borrowing on
then-.. If so, It Is very Important, as affecting
the future of the money market hÂ»re. Â«
The September trade returns are decidedly
satisfactory.
The London discount rate is 2 11-16 per cent,
due tv the monetary position In Germany as
told In these dispatches yesterday. The best
I . -i favors a rise In the German bank rale
on Monday next but considerable doubt la en
tertained Such a movement would probably
be followed by a rise In the rate hare. The
situation In Germany is not really serious, but
It may perhaps entail considerable slow liqui
dation.
The Issue n-night Is announced of the large
Havana Tobacoo Company, announced recent
ly in these dispatches. The share capital Is
Â£500,000. with debentures amounting to 1:260,000.

FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK. Oct. 7. â Bradstreet's Financial
Review will say to-morrow: It has been an Ir
regular market, with restricted professional
trading. Most of the developments. Including
the current reports of railroad earnings, have
been favorable, but the breaks In the industrial
stock list under the lead of Tobacco last week
and of sugar stock this week, have apparently
eliminated public Interest for the time being.
London has shown a disposition to purchase
the Pacific stocks, but Its transactions here
have had little effect. The Increasing case of
the money market seems to be responsible for
the renewed activity and strength In the bond
list, but neither this nor the continuance of
gold Imports seem to revive the flagging spirit
of speculation.
The chief incident has been the weakness of
American Sugar stock on cutting of prices for
the reflne<l article.
The railroads have been neglected, but some
specialties have been actively manipulated and
advanced. Tobacco has ceased to bo a leader
of the market, the revelation about the dis
agreements and liquidation of the pool In the
stock having quieted the street's apprehen
sions about the Industrials as a class. Sugar,
however, took Tobacco's place In the market.
Prices for refined have been generally reduced,
both by the American Company and the oppo
sition refineries, until on Thursda" Is was un
derstood that granulated sugar was sold at
about 4%c a pound, which, .It Is believed, re
moves all profit from the refining business.
From 118% at the beginning of the week the
price of sugar stock fell to 112 V*. Its course be
ing markeed with great Irregularity and fre
quent rallies on the Fhort interest. The latter
Incidents were assisted by the apparent scar
city of stock and the perevalence of a premium
for borrowing it of one-sixteenth to one-quar
ter of 1 per cent. The other industrials were
but little affected by the course of Sugar.
People's Gas was very strong, rising from 101
to 10514 on Inside support and Intimations that
the arrangements settling the natural gas dis
pute and Involving the purchase of an im
portant auxiliary company which supplies the
company with oil are decidedly beneficial, al
though an Issue of $3,000,000 new stock Is said
to be part of the arrangement. In the outside
market the Federal Steel Company stocks have
been the object of considerable dealings at
well-sustained prices, the common being about
25(559.
The railroad share list has been neglected.
ThÂ» grangers, with the exception of Rock Isl
and, which had support on Its favorable Aug
ust statement, were dull. Atehlson preferred
was something of a feature, rising to M on ru
mors that dividends will commence In Janu
ary. Northern Pacific common on the other
hand has been Irregular in spite of foreign sup
port. After selling up to 42 It encountered
liquidating sales on discouraging rumors about
the probability of a dividend In the common
and mysterious intimations regarding alleged
disagreements between leading Interests to
the management. â 
â Railroad bonds have been active and strong,
the Atchtson Issues being particular features.
Government bonds are j steady for the new
fours, though the banks are celling the latter
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, SATUBPAY, OCTOBER 8, 1898.
and buying the new threes war bonds, which
have been very strong at an advance to 10oV4
atikej.
ERADSTREET'S REVIEW.
NEW YORK. Oct. 7.â Bradstreet's to-morrow
will say: With the exception of some parts of
the South, where heavy storms and yellow
fever, with resulting quarantines check distri
bution, a very large business appears to be |
doing, though complaints of a narrow margin ;
of profit are well nigh unanimous. "While the ;
bank clearings of September point to a slightly
smaller business done the country over than
one year ago, this week's figures point to a
fair gain over last year, and therefore over
all previous records lor this week of the year.
The volume of distribution, as a whole, is well
up to or above that reported a year ago in
most sections, and therefore far in advance or
recent preceding annual periods. As for some
time past, most avtlvlty Is perceptible in the
West and Northwest and on thÂ« Pacific Coast,
particularly at Puget Sound and Columbia
River points. It has been a carnival and fall
celebration period at a number of Western
cities this week, and a resulting large dis
tribution, both retail and wholesale, Is reported.
At leading Eastern markets recently favorable
reports .ire fully maintained, with business In
textiles, particularly cotton and woolen goods,
least favorably situated. Signs are not want
ing that the spread of yellow fever In some sec
tions of the South with resulting quarantines,
has sharply checked trade In the lower Miss
issippi Valley, while heavy thunderstorms on
the South Atlantic coast have operated to ar
rest distribution and reduce the rice crop. The
general industrial situation Is a very favorable
one. Marked activity continues to be a feat
ure of the Iron and steel trades, but the im
mense rate of production at present, In the
absence of immediate new demands, has caused
a sharing- of some few grades of pig iron and
steel billets. Movements In an upward direc- ;
tion, however, are reported from the West. I
The situation as to prices generally la one of |
sustained strength, wheat being prominent in
this respect, while the most important reduc
tion is that growing out of the refined sugar
war. To the exceptional strength of ocean
freights Is charged some of the Tailing oft In
exports from southern points. Business failure i
are still down to a minimum, numbering 1*54 j
for the week, against 166 last week. 237 In this j
week a year ago and 23$ in 1894. Active demand j
for the actual wheat and unprecedentedly
smaller stocks to start with have constituted
a balance for generally estimated maximum
world's yields, and recent considerable Increase
In stocks at home and abroad. In the face,
therefore, of a gain of 7.000,000 bushels In Amer- I
lean and Europeans stocks last week, prices \
influenced by the small gain In world's stocks i
In Septemberâ ls,soo,ooo bushelsâ have ruled .
firmer and higher. Bradstreet's monthly re- I
port of wheat stocks shows a total on October J
1 In this country and Canada of 23.525.000 bush
els, a gain of 10,135.000 bushels for the month, j
against 12.745.000 bushels a year ago, while Eu- |
ropean stocks on a like date are given at >
42,200.000 bushels, a gain of only 5.400.000 bush- j
els. against 14.200.000 bushels In September a i
year ago. A combined pain Is here indicated |
of only 15,500.000 bushels, against 27.000.000 last <
year, and 20.000. 0C^ to 21,000.000 bushels gain j
In l<9. r , and ISM. Stocks In this country and j
Canada east of the Rockies on October 1 are
the smallest reported at thai date since 1881.
Prices of leading staples as reported to
Brads: reet's. while showing rather more Irregu
larity, In tlie majority are well held.
Warmber weather early In the week checked j
buying of heavy poods at Canadian cities, but
better conditions later have favorably affected j
distributive trade. Toronto reports heavy j
Northwestern buying, with farmers In that |
section still depositing wheat Tn elevators. De- :
liveries are more liberal, although prices are
still above an export b \r- In Ontario. Ameri
can lumbermen are reported hiring large num
bers of men for work In Canada this winter.
Canadian failures this week numbered 23.
against 1" last week. 45 a year ago, 37 in IS9C,
64 In ISM and 37 in 1594.
DUN'S REVIEW of TRADE.
NFW TORK. Oct. 7. R, a. Dun & To.. In

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Oct. 7. â Liverpool gnve the tone
to the early trading in Wheat. That market
surprised the bears by showing %d advance at
the start. As the local market had failed to
advÃnce yesterdny, a decline in the English
market was looked for by a good many, and
the contrary being true, the more timid shorts
covered at once. The result was an opening
advance of %c In December, that option start
ing at 62 7 4Â©63 c. All forenoon the market
showed strength, shorts being more or less
prominent, while a good deal of quiet Invest
ment buying was done. Plenty of bull news
drifted In during the morning to encourage
buying.
The market here was at Its strongest around
noon. Seaboard reported export sales of at
least 60 loads. This evidence of the continua
tion of the recent heavy foreign demand for
American Wheat was responsible for a con
siderable Increase In the demand, which was
augmented by the strength of cash Wheat In
outside markets, notably New York and Minne
apolis, and the highest price of the day was
reached, December being bid up to 63%@63ftc.
This was nearly lc above yesterday's closing
price, and showed a profit tempting enough to
bring about a good deal of realizing in the last
hour of the session. Prices dropped somewhat
under this, although offerings were well taken.
December closed at an advance of %<3fte.

shipping demand, and closed Vie higher.

CALIFORNIA FIGS IN THE EAST.
NEW YORK, Oct. 7.â The Journal of Com
merce says: ThÂ«- failure of the Turkish Fig
<-r. p baa offered an opportunity to growers. In
otiier parts of the world to press their claims
for recognition on consuming markets, and It
Is being fully utilized.
California is making a Â«tror.g bid for populnr
favor this year nn.l by putting on the market a
b.nt.-r class of roods than h;tv* heretofore iÂ» i en
cent out Is attracting buyers, particularly as
prices quoted are comparatively low. While
thr California Fig is much Improved in qual
ity nn.i texture. It is asserted that th-^re is still
a poo.i ,i^al left to be desired. It lacks yet the
sweetness and keeping qualities of the Oriental
fruit, but growers are b -ruling all their en..i.nies
toward overcoming deficiencies in this regard,
and this year's output is far In a Ivance of
anything that has heretofore been offered from
the coa*t. and as regards styl<-- of packing Cali
fornia fruit certainly seems to have an advan
tage over Imported goods.
Portugal and Greece, taking advantage of the
short crop In Turkey, are pressing their claims
for recognition in American markets. From
Portugal '"â¢ >n-.andrp Kips, in tapnets, are seek
ing to make up for the shortage In .Smyrna
fruit and are said to be meeting with consid

STILL CHASING
UP MISSING
C ASH BAIL
Dr. Edwards Before
the Grand Jury.
AN INTERESTING DISCOVERY
*L DEPUTY SHERIFF PRODUCES
AN IMPORTANT RECEIPT.
Records That Do Not Show What
Disposition Was Made of
the Case Against Ed
wards.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
Broadway, Oct. 7.
Some really interesting facts developed
et the ir.\fsiigation into the conduct of
Constables by the Grand Jury to-day.
Dr. A I- Edwards, a San Francisco
. in company with Annie Ar
irrested in February, 1596, for
the peace, and subsequently
. $10 cash bail each, was before
! Jury this afternoon; as were
ble Glaze and his deputy, Harry
Cramer, who made the arrest, and Deputy
ff Lane, who released the prisoner.
BOS that he paid the $20 bail
puty Sheriff Lane, and that when he
sed he presented Lane with $10
:onal out of consideration for kind
ment. He claims that he was re-
I on a telephonic order from Justice
I B. L. Lawrence of Brook
lyn Township, in Constable Glaze's baili
wick
At the time of Edwards' arrest he
calmed that he had been robbed on the
: ty road.
Deputy Sheriff Lane emphatically denies
i 1i 1 at he received any 'â¢presents" from Ed
wards, and his record shows that the
prisoner when searched at the County
had but $23 on his person, and all
but $3 went for cash bail.
Lane has been at a loss to remember
what he did with the bail when Edwards
released. To-day, however, he and
:>- White searched his records thor
oughly and were rewarded by finding a
t signed by Deputy Constable Cra
mer for the missing: $20 bail. It was
: that on the same day Cramer gave
Lane another receipt in another case
wherein the bail was $25.
There is every likelihood that the Grand
Jury will pretty definitely ascertain where
the money went to.
Justice of the Peace Lawrence s docket
chows that Cramer swore to the complaint
against Edwards and his lady friend, but
it does not show what disposition was
made of the case or one word about the
bail. Moreover, Lawrence insists that his
ru'.e in disturbance cases Is $100 bond or
ISO cash. ,
Deputy Constable Cramer states that he
remembers the fact of the arrest and that
he subsequently called at the County Jail
POSTUM CEREAL.
ANOTHER BRAIN WORKER
Gives Experience in CofEee Drinking.
Ik "My work (writing for papers and
Pfnacazines) calls for such steady use of
"the brain that, like many fellow work-
ers .in that line, I became badly ex-
hausted at times, and naturally felt a
A for some sort of stimulant.
"Coffee I have used considerably. Its
effects finally became so apparent that
I decided I must make a change, for I
could not endure the headaches and
extreme nervousness that followed.
Then came the objections innumerable
from the other members of the family.
'What shall we have for breakfast in
the place of coffee, for you, of all peo-
ple, are very particular about your
morning drink. 1
MBS. MABY E. FOBSYTH,
Milwaukee, Wis.
"We tried leaving off coffee, but for
a morning or two the breakfast was
â  not tempting.
"Then Postum Food Coffee was
brought to my notice, and unfortu-
nately, the first morning It was care-
lessly made by the cook, and was not at
all satisfactory. I determined to look
personally after its preparation, and
after noticing that the directions
called for full fifteen minutes' boiling
after boiling had really commenced, I
made it that way, and these were
some of the exclamations at the
breakfast: "Why, It's far better than
coffee!' 'What an exquisite flavor?'
'Delicious, delightful,' etc.
"The effect of the change on my
health was magical. The headaches
and nervousness were gone, and in j
their place a peculiar and grateful ex-
hilaration possessed the entire body. I \
was not the only member of the fam- \
lly that was benefited by the change. \
One member who had suffered serious-
ly with stomach trouble was relieved
entirely i n a very short time.
"Perhaps you might be Interested to
know that there are several of our
friends who have been greatly helped
by the use of Postum. Mrs. Emma
Max used to be greatly troubled with
nausea and B ick headaches; Miss Addie
Slight was cured of stomach trouble; j
Charles Kverson, formerly suffered |
greatly with headaches and nervous-
ness; Miss Eliza Smith was a great
fr Â° m sever c bilious attacks.
All of these persons have been relieved i
of their difficulties and put in a fine
condition of health by abandoning cof-
fee (which evidently was a poison to
each of them) and Ã¼Ãlng the Postum
Food Coffee.
"I am convinced that your claim
that Postum furnishes the particles of
Â»iosphate of potash and albumen nec-
Jseary to rebuild the delicate matter
â n the nerve centers Is true, for my
lown experience and that of my family
fend friends gives every indication of
In company with Glaze to secure Ed
wards' release, and he, moreover, identi
fies the signature on the receipt held by
Lane as in his handwriting, but he does
not recollect to whom ne thereafter
turned the money over.
"I either gave it to Glaze right there
and then." said Cramer to-day, "or, as I
usually do, I turned it over* to Judge
Lawrence. This ie the first time I have
ever had any trouble of any kind, and It
comes In very unpleasantly at this time,
when I am a nominee for the office of
Constable."
The Grand Jury will take the matter up
again next Tuesday.
STIEGLER RUN DOWN
BY TROLLEY CAR NO. 13
A BAKER SUSTAINS INJURIES
THAT PROVE FATAL.
He Was Caught Under the Fender
and His Chest Crushed Inâ The
Tracks Were Slippery.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Oct. 7.
Gustave Stiegler, a baker, residing at
Elmhurst, was struck by a Haywards
electric trolley car at Fitchburg about
noon to-day, sustaining injuries that
proved fatal.
Stiegler was driving In a covered wagon
and had been around serving his custom
ers at Fitchburg. He was driving by the
Fitchburg school house as car 13 came
In view. The motorman saw the danger
when the wagon was crossing the track
and reversed his power, but, owing to the
light rains, the track was slippery and
the car could not be brought to an Im
mediate standstill.
Stiegler also made an attempt to check
his horse, but without avail. The car
struck the wagon squarely In the center
and smashed it into fragments, while the
driver was thrown off the wagon and
caught under the fender. His chest was
crushed In, and several bones were
broken. He also sustained other Injuries
about the abdomen and head.
The injured man was immediately re
moved to his home at Elmhurst, where
Dr. Dodge attended him.
Stiegler waa about 3ti years of age, and
had a wife and two children.
Gustave Stiegler died shortly after 3
o'clock to-night. Coroner Baldwin was
notified and will hold an inquest to-mor
row night.

LADY YARDE-BULLER
IGNORES THE MAYOR
HAS NOT BECEIVED ONE OF HER
NUMEROUS LETTERS.
Her Ladyship Criticizes His Honor
and the Council and Objects
to Taxes.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 7.
On several occasions during the past
month letters directed to "Mayor
Thomas," and signed by "M. L. K.
Yarde-Buller." have appeared In the
papers, relating to Mrs. Buller's prop
erty and the taxes thereon. A peculiar
ity of the correspondence Is that the
Mayor has not received one word from
her ladyship. He said to-day that he has
read four letters in the papers, directed
to him, from Mrs. Yarde-Buller, but has
never seen the originals.
"The letter published last night," said
the Mayor, "is somewhat of an insult.
It declares that neither I nor the Coun
eilmen can dominate the Supreme Court,
and suggests tha* -'? are trying to go
something illegal or aiÃhonorable with the
lady's alleged estate. 1 can only arrive at
the conclusion that Mrs. Yarde-Buller
does nnt realise what ph<-" is doing and is
irresponsible, although if ahe wishes to
correspond wit., me on any subject I
would rather receive my mail from tne
letter-carrier than through the news
papers."

THE SAIN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 8, 1898.
MAYOR THOMAS
CONDEMNS THE
$1 2 TAX LEVY
Strongly Opposes the
Council's Plans.
ABLE PLEA FOR MORE FUNDS
GLOOMY PROSPECT FOR THE
GROWING CITY.
High Schools and Libraries Would
Have to Be Closed and Fire De
partment and Streets
Neglected.
OAKLAND, Oct. 7.â The meeting called
by the Mayor to-night to decide the tax
levy was entirely unproductive, as the
very men whom his Honor wished to
meet absented themselves. There were
present Messrs. Girard, Rowe, Cuvellier,
Woodward and Pringle. Councilman Up
ton is opposed to the proposed ordinance,
but is sick and Woodward is in favor of
it. Woodward is once more â as in the
water rate cases â the pivotal man, and
his vote is the middle one of the thir
teen. Mayor Thomas had prepared an
analysis of the proposed ordinance, which
1b in effect in the nature of a vote. It
is as follows :
The tax levy ordinance passed by your hon
orable body on October 3 is now In my haniis.
By the terms of said ordinance you have fixed
the tax rate at {1 21 upon the taxable prop
erty of our city. After carefully considering
the matter I am convinced in a number ot
cases the apportionment of funds as made in
said ordinance will not provide amounts suffi
cient to carry on the various departments of
the city government for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1599, and X beg leave to call your at
tention to the following facts and figures as I
find them.
I present herewith a statement showing the
actual cost of maintenance only of the various
departments for the last fiscal year after
eliminating therefrom all items unnecessary
to duolicate this year. These amount to
$85,555, and provide for not $1 of betterments.
The Jl 21 ordinance will provide J50.560, and
to this may be added the $44,000 to be derived
from other sources which will provide a total
of J94,560, or |i>3os more than was required for
the above offices last year; but this amount
will not be sufficient to meet the additional
expense for elections, which the Auditor esti
mates will cost $8500, and the increased cost
of advertising, which the Auditor estimates at
Â»6Â£oO.
This ordinance therefore fails to provide for
the expenses which have to be met from the
general and salary funds to the extent of
16000. What offices has this Council reduced,
or will it reduce, to meet this deficiency of
J6000?
After showing that there will be a de
ficit of $9008 in the street lighting fund,
$3000 in the Fire Department without al
lowing a dollar for the large annexed ter
ritory, $6000 in the police fund and $3750 in
the street fund, the message proceeds:
ThlÂ« calculation will depend wholly upon
what la done with the East and weiff
Side sewers. Two cents will provide for what
Is called the Cemetery Creek connection with
the main lake sewer. One cent will provide
for the sewer repairs estimated in the city.
An additional cent will, in my Judgment, con
struct a temporary sewer, and by that I mean
a wooden box sewer, which shall take up the
sewage now running into the lake on the
East Side and convey it to the estuary. This
temporary sewer will. In my opinion, answer
that purpose until the city of Oakland shall
bond Itself to construct a complete sewer sys
tem under plans already submitted, or that
may be submitted, and I suggest that there
might be a savine of 4 cents or more in the
amount fixed by the ordinance passed.
The grammar and primary schools cost last
year for maintenance only $246,732. Betterments
have already been made this year amounting
to 12000. The |1 21 ordinance provides *12,716,
$1000 less than the amount required for bare
maintenance. The free library cost last year
for maintenance alone, without any new books,
$15,224. I believe this to be the most econom
ical department in the city.
The Jl 21 ordinance will provide $8476, a little
more than one-half the amount required. I
think It would he a nubile calamity should
the free library and public reading rooms be
compelled to close for the want of funds. Shall
they be closed?
The High School cost last year for main
tenance only $46,294. The $1 21 ordinance will
provide $25,430. This Is $20,264 short of the cost
of maintenance only last year. The teachers
have been hired, and I am Informed that the
courts have deeded that teachers' salaries
must be paid from any moneys in the treasury
regardless of Its distribution to funds. I am
convinced that additional money must be pro
vided for this department or the Board of Edu
cation will be compelled to close the school
In February- The ordinance provides for main
tenance this year of 85 cents, as atcatnst 95
cents last year, with a shrinkage of $70,000 on
account of lower valuation by the Assessor.
While I am strongly in favor of as low a tax
levy as is consistent with an economical man
agement of the various departments, I am
strongly opDosed to such a distribution and
apportionment of the funds raised that the
High School, free library and reading rooms.
Fire and Street Departments shall be bo hamp
ered that the two former shall have to be
closed for a portion of the year, that street
sprinkling and repairs would necessarily be
stopped which would result in great damage
to our streets, and that our efficient Fire De
partment should be compelled in any way to
take a step backward when it should be in
creased and some protection given to the large
district lately annexed. And I sincerely hope
that the Council will take such steps as may be
necessary to amply provide for the proper
maintenance of every department in our city
government.
Woodward was the only one present
who did not admit the feasibility of the
Mayor's position, and he was not posi
tive in his views. The ordinance con
demned by the Mayor provides $80,000 for
dredging the lake and $38,500 for sewers.
Attorney Cohen Gives Bonds.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 7.â Several days ago a
warrant was issued for the arrest of At
torney A, H. Cohen on a charge of having
maliciously assaulted I. L. Borden, caus
ing him to break his leg. The warrant
was not served for some reason, but yes
terday Cohen appeared in Justice Morris'
court, having learned of the warrant
through the press, and Rave a bond for
his appearance whenever the caae should
be set for examination.
DENVER CLAIRVOYANT
KILLED BY A STRANGLER
DENVER, Colo., Oct. 7.â Mrs. Julia
Voght, a clairvoyant and medium, was
found dead in her apartments on Cham
pa street to-day. She lay on the floor,
face downward. A twisted towel was
tied tightly around her neck, and there
is no doubt that she had been strangled.
There is no clew to the murderer, but
the police believe that the deed was com
mitted by the same strangier who mur
dered three women on Market street In
thie city in 1894. Shortly after those
murders Mrs. Voght informed the police
officials that spirits had given her, while
she was in a trance, a description of the
strangler. but he has never been dis
covered. It is thought that the murderer
of Mrs. Voght either believed that she
did know something, or he was a believer
in "spirits," and decided to put her out
of the way, and. possibly save himself
from exposure.
Mrs. voght had a brother and a sister,
Andrew and Amanda J. Wright, living
at 2021 North Broadway, St. Louis. Her
husband is serving a term in the peni
tentiary for having stolen bicycles.

ZAZUETA'S WIFE
NOW LIVES ON
RARATONGA ISLE
Elopers Heard From
After Many Years.
TOOK THE MAYOR'S VALISE
A CRUEL FATHER WANTS HIS
LITTLE CHILD.
Sequel to a Shooting Affair That
Caused Much Scandal in This
City Several Years
Ago.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 7.
Dominguez Zazueta, who disappeared
from Oakland some years ago at the
same time that the wife of a prominent
contractor also deserted her home, has
been heard from. He is now a prosper
ous cigar manufacturer In Philadelphia.
He has written to the firm of Benham
& Thomas, asking what became of the
wife and child he deserted in Oakland
when he ran off with Mrs. Antonelli.
Some years ago Dominguez Zazueta
lived In this ~.cy -with his wife and
child. He frequently did business for
the firm of which Mayor Thomas was
then a member. He became greatly in
fatuateu with the wife of Contractor
Antonelli and one evening ilr. Antonelll
took a shot through his back window
at a fleeing form which he declared was
that of Zazueta.
"The next day after the shooting,"
said the Mayor this afternoon, "I re
ceived a visit from Zazueta, who told
me he had a splendid trade in view in
Tulare. He assured us there was a big
commission in it and a-s he had fre
quently done business for us we ad
vanced him his expenses for the trip.
He also borrowed my leather gripsack
and started for Tulare. A few days
passed and he did not return, but one
evening I was surprised when Mr. An
tonelli called at my house. He was
very excited and was crying. He asked
me where Zazueta was and I told him
that I expected him back any day, I
then asked him what was Uie matter
with him and he told me that Zazueta
had undoubtedly taken Mrs. AntonelU
with him.
"I wrote to Tulare and was surprised
to learn that Zazueta had never been
there, and from that time we heard
nothing more of him. He deserted a
lovely little wife and child, who lived
on Telegraph avenue, and after awhile
Mrs. Zazueta went back to her parents
in the interior of the State.
"About two years ago Mrs. Zazueta
called on me and surprised me by say
ing that she was the wife of the captain
of a south sea trading vessel and that
their home was on the Island of Rara-
Honga, in the heart of the Pacific. She j
told me she was very happy and that
she would like to know if 1 had heard
anything more of her former husband, i
I had heard nothing of him and so in- |
formed her. But she impressed me that
her happy life recompensed her in a
great measure for the misery she had
endured In this city. She was on aÂ« visit
to her parents and I presume she is
now on her Island home.
"Not long ago we received a letter
from Zazueta. He told us that he was
settled in Philadelphia and was doing
a good business as a cigar manu
facturer. He made Inquiry about his
wife, but seemed more interested in his
child and expressed the hope that some
thing might be done by which he could
recover it. 1 wrote to him and told
him of the visit of his deserted wife
and assured him that I could see no
hope for him getting their child. I took
particular care to let him know how
happy his former wife is, for I con
sider him to be a perfect coward, treat
ing his family in the way he did. I re
minded him that we still held his note
for $190 for that Tulare trip and also
suggested that if he felt like redeem
ing it he could express the coin to us
in my leather gripsack which he was
thoughtful enough to borrow.
"Zazueta does not mention in his let
ter what became of Mrs. Antonelli, but
as he only seems anxious to get his
child I presume they are still together.
After his wife's disappearance Antonelli
sold his beautiful home for a mere song
and left Oakland and I have not heard
of him since. He was so broken
hearted that I feared what he might
do to himself."
Some weeks have passed since the
Mayor answered Mr. Zazueta's letter,
but neither the coin nor the gripsack
has yet reached Oakland.
STREET CAR GOES OVER
AN EMBANKMENT
ONE WOMAN PASSENGER IS SE-
BIOUSLY HUBT.
A Horse Car in Berkeley Becomes
Derailed and the Occupants
Are Shaken Up.
BERKELEY, Oct. 7.â This morning as
one of the horse cars which run between
East and West Berkeley was passing near
the corner of University avenue and
Fourth street, it left the track and fell
down an embankment some four or five
feet high.
The car left Berkeley station at 10
o'clock. The driver was Samuel More
head, and the only passenger a Mrs. Ol
sen of Haywards. As the car had al
most reached Fourth street on Univer
sity avenue, one of the wheels struck a
small rock placed across the track. It
overturned at once, falling to the wagon
road below.
At the scene of the accident the track
is raised a little over four feet from the
main road. The driver had juat turned
the Fourth street curve when he felt the
car jolt, and Instantly leave the rails.
Me applied the brake at once and tried
to stop the horses, but the momentum
carried the car onward until it Btruck
the edge of the embankment and rolled
over. The driver was thrown from the
platform, but still managed to hold the
horses. Mrs. Olsen made every attempt
possible to escape, but her right hand was
held tightly by the door and she was per
fectly powerless to move until help ar
rived. The injured woman was taken In
a carriage to the residence of Mrs. Cap
tain Thompson of Fifth street, where a
physician was immediately summoned.
Faithless Spouses.
OAKLAND. Oct. 7.â Mrs. Nancy Simms
of Alameda is rtvee from her obnoxious
husband. The decree of divorce granted
to her this afternoon allowed her to re
sume her maiden name of Nancy Culver,
but it contained no reference to alimony.
The couple had not been married a year
when the young wife was deserted, and
on this ground she was awarded the de
cree of separation.
Joseph F. E. Lewis was also granted a
divorce to-day from Gertrude Lewis on
the ground of infidelity. The climax of
Lewis' trouble occurred a month ago
when he found his wife in the company
of a man named Harris at a Piedmont
resort. Lewis vowed that he would take
his rival's life, but instead he sought the
divorce court.
ACCUSED OF HAVING
POISONED HIS WIFE
Wealthy Kansas Man May Have to
Answer for at Least Three
Murders.
LAWRENCE. Kans., Oct. 7.â J. J.
Kunkle, a wealthy merchant tailor,
was arrested here to-day, charged with
having murdered his wife by poisoning.
Mrs. Kunkle died ten days ago. About
four weeks previous to the woman's
death Birdie Cominyore, her 14-year
old daughter by a former husband, died
after a lingering illness which baffled
the skill of the family physician.
A few days before the death of Mrs.
Kunkle she told several of her neigh
bors that she was being slowly poison
ed, and also tnat her daughter had
been poisoned. When asked why sh?
did not leave the house, Mrs. Kunkle
replied that she did not feel strong
enough to go, and that she hoped to se
cure actual proof of the truth of her
suspicions.
Upon the death of Mrs. Kunkle, her
neighbors brought the case to the at
tention of the Coroner, who caused the
woman's stomach to be taken to the
State University for analysis of its con
tents. The result of this analysis was
reported to the Coroner's jury yester
day. Strong signs of arsenic were
present, and upon this showing, and
upon the testimony of neighbors of the
Kunkles, the jury returned a verdict
that Mrs. Kunkle came to her death
by poison "administered at the hands
of her husband and'others to the Jury
unknown." Following the rendering
of this verdict Kunkle was arrested.
The stomach of Mrs. Kunkle's little
daughter has now been removed for
analysis.
A former wife of Kunkle died sud
denly after her life had been heavily
insured.
In the deelopments in the cases of
Mrs. Kunkle and her daughter have re
vived incidents attending the death of
other members of Kunkle's family.
Three years ago the father of his
first wife, an old man who lived with
Kunkle, died very suddenly, death oc
curring- within a few hours after he was
stricken. Kunkle's first wife, whose
life had been insured for $6000, died in
convulsions a few months later. Fred
die, a little son of the first wife, also
di'?d suddenly after his life had been
insured.
Shortly before the death of his first
wife Kunkle's house and barn burned
under circumstances which caused con
siderable gossip, and he collected a
considerable nmount of insurance.
Kunkle has lived in Lawrence for
twenty-five years.

DELANY AND
RAGAN BURY
THE HATCHET
A Peaceful Meeting
Is the Result.
â¢
THE CAPTAIN IS VICTORIOUS
NEW TERMS MADE FOR THE
STANYAN STREET LEASE.
Rent Reduced to $125 Per Month
and the Owner Is Compelled
to Keep the Building in
Repair.
Captain Delany was the sole member of
the Health and Police Committee of the
Supervisors present yesterday when the
hour set for the meeting arrived. Usu
ally there is a full attendance of the com
mittee, but perhaps the others did not care
to face the captain In his wrath and be
cause of his threat to ventilate the lease
of the Stanyan-street property remained
away.
So Delany passed upon several matters
alone. Including the petition of Mr. Kelly,
who has the contract for burying the in
digent dead, asking to be allowed $6 95 ad
ditional for each person who dies of con
tagion, on the ground that he is compelled
to bury such in metallic coffins at that,
much more expense. The captain allowed
the petition, ordering that the money be
paid out of the urgent necessity fund.
Supervisor Rivers came in while several
petitions for boxing permits were under
consideration and the two decided to post
pone action on the applications tor a
week Just at this juncture School Direc
tor Kagan, the "party of the first part
to the famous lease, entered the commit
tee room and dropped into a seat con
veniently near the door. Â:â  'â¢â ;
Delany looked up and to the surprise
of those present, who anticipated a ter
rible outburst of indignation, greeted the
doctor most cordially, his salutation be
ing returned in kind.
The captain fumbled among a lot of
papers for a moment, apparently trying
to collect himself and then dove into the
subject matter without further ado.
"In regard to this Stanyan-street lease,
doctor," he began, "in my conversation
With you I said we did not require the
entire property, and we were to have
what we wanted for $125 per month.
Moreover, my understanding was that you
were to pay for the necessary alterations j
and keep the place in reasonable repair.
But this lease puts all that expense on
the city." 'â . : ,,- Â ,
"When the lease was made, replied â¢
Ragan. "it included all the property; no
provision was made for part of it."
"Are you willing to lease part of it at
the figure you stated to â $125 a
month?" _ /
"Yes."
"And how about your agreement to tit
it up properly?"
"I will keep the agreement," returned
Ragan. "That lease on file is an exact
copy of all leases on record and I merely
flowed the < sual terms in drafting it.
"We waive that right."
"Well, I want you to put this new
agreement in writing," said Delany.
"All right, you have it prepared and I
will sign it."
"Remember, it's only for a portion of
the lot at a rental of $125!"
"I will comply with the requirements
of the Police Department. They have an
architect at work on the matter now, and
I can't tell just what they will want.
They will haye 1 the entire frontage, the
portion to be discarded to be In the rear. j
what they select will be embodied in the
lease. I have prepared a waiver on the
lease on file which can be attached to It,"
and the doctor produced the document.
The clerk was instructed to prepare a \
form embodying the provision that Ragan |
is to make all necessary alterations and
report it to the committee next wee*.
"I will sign this waiver Monday," ssid
Ragan, handing it to Delany. "You Irid
better read it over carefully, you may rind
another gold brick."
"We ought to hold the whole matter
over for a month," retorted the captain,
"and we would get a still further reduc
tion in the rent' from you."
Ragan groaned. "This kick of yours
has cost me considerably more than $1000
now. including the reduced rent and cost
of alterations and repairs; you oucilit to
be satisfied with that." The doctor cast
a reproachful glance at Delany and left
the room, while Delany beamed on the
others and refrained from delivering his
threatened speech.
He would not even explain how he was
"bunkoed" into signing the lease.
THE LAST RAINSTORM
WAS A REAL FREAK
PROBABILITIES HAMMON GOT
MIXED ON LOCATION.
The Storm Started at Point Reyes,
but Extended All Over the State,
Doing Much Good and
Some Harm.
Rainmaker Hammon grot sadly mixed In
location with his latest attempt at order
ing rain. He had intended tc leave for a
month's vacation In the East on yester
day morning's train, but was obliged to
remain over until afternoon to get his
etorm started off right in the direction of
San Joaquln's dry pastures.
Yesterday's storm should properly have
started somewhere off the Washington or
Oregon coast, and the weather bureau
should have had at least three days' no
tice in which to get its flags flying. In
stead of that the first rain fell at Point
Reyes, and two hours after it started it
â  had centered over San Francisco, where
It left Just .43 of an inch of water.
Prom here the storm was blown by an
eighteen-mile an hour southeasterly wind
and it became general all over the State.
It was the first rain of local origin that
has attained a general precipitation since
Mr. Hammon has had charge of the west
ern department, and he is at a loss to
know whether to lay it to some recent
deflection in the Japanese current or to
pure contrariness.
Vine growers fear that this last rain
â¢will play havoc with the grapes. The
first showers of the season had a benefi
cial effect, cleaning the fruit and putting
It in good condition for crushing, but the
last fall has been so heavy that it is
feared that ripe grapes will be badly
rotted. ,
SANTA ROSA, Oct. This morning a
heavy thunder storm passed over this
county, followed by tremendous rains,
which seem likely to continue. The rain
will mean thousands of dollars' loss to the
grape growers and fruit driers. Thou
sands of trays of fruit are out of doors,
and grape picking has hardly commenced.
This is the first heavy rain of the season
and is very disastrous at the present
time.
SONOMA, Oct. 7.â The second rain
storm of the season set in this morning
and continued at intervals throughout the
day. Sonoma Valley is now in the midst
of tne vintage season. It is feared that
much damage will be done to scapes if
It does not clear up soon. â  ' Little or ho
damage has been done up to the present
time.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 7.â lt has been raining
at intervals since 1 p. m., and there is
every prospect for further showers to
night. The fruit crop, having be\ â Uarly
harvested, will not be much dv.--.agea,
but the vineyards in some portions will
suffer. .'."â '* : . :
SANTA CRUZ, Oct. 7.â At noon to-day
rain commenced, and the prospects are
for heavy showers.
NAPA, Oct. 7.â Heavy rain fell to-day.
Soldier Allen Discharged.
F. M. Allen, an 18-year-old boy who en
lioted in the First Washington Volunteers
without permission of his parents, wae
fliHcharped on habeas corpus yesterday by
United States District Judga Hawley.
ABDUCTION OF
A PRETTY GIRL
The Police Are Searching for Eva Hess, Fourteen
Years of Age, Who Came From
N the Country.
EVA HESS, a pretty girl, 14 years of age, has been abducted, and De
tective Anthony and Officer McMurray, of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Children, have been for several days searching
for her. They have come to the conclusion that she has been sent
to British Columbia for Immoral purposes. The girl left her home in the
country about six weeks ago to
come to the city in search of
employment. Not having heard
from her since a day or so after
her arrival here her mother be
came alarmed and came to the
city, notifying the police.
After diligent inquiries the girl
was traced to 208 O'Farrell
street, where she had been liv
ing with another young girl,
Ella Byer, from Oregon. The
offU-ers ascertained on going
there that about ten days ago a
ir.an called at the house and told
the Hess girl thai he had been
sent by her mother to take her
home. He had a telescope bas
ket with him, and not doubting
the truth of his statement the
Kked her things In the
Lnd went away with the
ho g?ye hi" name as
" It is thought that the
it the girl in charge of a
to British Columbia,
fleers, from Information
given them by the Beyer girl,
believe that the man was Isaac
Wolfe, a clerk in the Devon lodging house on Market street, and he
will probably be arrested to-day on a charge of abduction. Wolfe was
sterday by the officers, but he declared that he only took the girl
from the house to a car and there left her. Mrs. Hess is determined to
lind her daughter and take her ba?k home with her.

the new edifice was laid. The lines will be j
formed at '.t:4o a. m. on Post street, facing
west, the right resting on Powell street.
The signal to advance will be given
prompuy at 10 a. m. The formation will i
be In three divisions, each division con
taining ten chapters, lodges or consis
tories, headed by a band. The line of
march will be up Post street to Mason,
down Mason to Market, and thence down
that thoroughfare to the ferry- On arriv
ing at the ferry the first division will in

The grounds of the magnificent edifice
compose 26C1 acres of the finest land in
Alameda County, all of which has been
paid for. A large building and annex of
brick and stone has been erected at a cost
of $75,000. It contains sufficient room for
100 orphans, twenty-five widows, twenty
five men and the necessary attendants.
It Is understood that the ladles of the
Eastern Star. Grand Chapter, will furnish
the home. They will meet this month and
reach a definite decision. The ladies of
Golden Gate Commandery presented a
beautiful art glass window to the home to
be placed in Memorial Hall.
It Is partially due to the Masonic Fair
that the debt on the grounds and build
ing was cleared. The fair was one of the
Â«qÂ°?li EU Â£cossful ever held and netted
Siy.iiou. jhe expenses amounted to $6000
As 10,000 people are expected to attend
the dedication the railroad has made a
special rate of 75 cents for adults and 40
cents for children.
DESERVED PROMOTION.
Eugene T. Wilson, TJ. S. A., Pro
moted to Major and Commis
sary of Subsistence.
Another capable and progressive officer
of the United States army has received
deserved promotion. The President has
appointed Captain Eugene T. Wilson
Third Artillery, U. S. A., to the rank of
major and commissary of subsistence.
United States volunteers. Major Wilson
has wired acceptance of hts commission.
This officer, whose meritorious services
have been recognized, was born in Ohio
and graduated from the West Point Mili
tary Academy in the class of 1888. He was
aauitional second lieutenant Fifth Artil
lery, June 11, ISBB, and second lieutenant
Fir^ Artillery December 4. 1888. He was
subsequently promoted to first lieutenant
Thi '. Artillery and assigned to Captain
Sedgwlck Pratfs Battery E, stationed at
Fort Mason. At the beginning of the late
war Mr. Wilson was promoted to the
grade of captain In the Signal Corps and
assigned to Important duties connected
with the harbor defense and mine fields
of San Francisco Bay. The duties of the
position demanded intelligence of a high
degree and constant activity. Captain
Wilson met the requirements of the
office, and no doubt his advancement to
the grade of major is in recognition of his
faithful and vigilant service. The promo
tion may call him to another station, as
regular army officers familiar with the
work of the subsistence department are
in demand.
"WELL DONE, RILEY."
Andy McGinty Thrashed for Using
Language That Was Unpatriotic.
Andy McGinty made himself conspicuous
in front of Metropolitan Temple Tuesday
night during the Democratic meeting by
shouting "Down with McKinley! Hurrah
for Maguire and the single tax!"
Charles Rlley, a plumber, happened to
be near McGinty at the time and told
him that If he was dissatisfied with the
country he had better return to Ireland.
McGinty persisted in his cry and Rlley
hit him a clap on the face. McGinty
raised a row, and yelled for some one
to arrest Riley. Policeman D. R. Camp
bell appeared and Rlley was arrested on
a charge of battery.
The case was called in Judge Low's
court yesterday morning, and Rlley said
he was willing to plead guilty and pay
a fine. Prosecuting Attorney Reynolds
entered a demurrer. He said he heard
McGinty, and if Riley had not struck
him he would have done so himself. He
suggested that the case be dismissed. The
Judge convicted Rlley and imposed a fine
of $0 with no alternative. As Riley was
the court room some one shouted "Well
done, Rlley!"

TURNED INTO LODGINGS
-
MBS. JOHN PETTEE MAKES SOME
WARM CHARGES.
Superintendent Hutchinson of the
Boys' Training Home Accused
of Mismanagement.
When Superintendent Hutchinson of the
Boys' Training Home, on Howard street,
near Sixteenth, gave vent to his feelings
in a caustic article which appeared in
"Our Youth," he little dreamt of the
wrath he was incurring by his alleged
disclosures.
The superintendent has not only wound
ed the feelings of a number of ladies /who
compose the board of management or a
similar Institution at 3262 Twenty-fifth
street, known as the Boys' Home, but has
brought down on his own head some
counter charges that place him in an
awkward position. Mrs. John Pettee, one
of the foremost members of the latter or
ganization and a lady whose deeds of
goodness and hard work in behalf of the
orphan have given her quite a local repu
tation, is strong in her denunciation of
Hutchinson and his methods. She not
not only charges the superintendent with
being incompetent to fill his present posi
tion, but declares him unworthy to act as
head of a charitable institution. The lat
ter charge is aimed solely at his manner
of running his present Home. ~
Mrs. Pettee called attention to the arti
cle that appeared in the "Youth," and em
phatically stated It was malicious and
untrue. "This man," said she, "is angry
with us because we opened a Home for
the little ones and are doing so well. We
once gave him an opportunity to show
his ability to conduct an institution, but
he signally failed, and now he Is trying
to belittle us in his sheet and other papers
by saying we are collecting money and
donations for the officers of the society.
"About six months ago he was at the
head of a Home for Boys at 26 Laurel
place, but instead of trying to make it
an abiding place for the orphan, he turn
ed it into a dwelling house for his family
and friends. A number of us visited the
place one day and found it in such a
wretched condition that we wondered how
they existed. Vermin was everywhere
and filth so great that we had to be care
ful where we walked. Mr. Hutchinson
explained its condition by saying that he
was doing badly. We sympathized with
him, and thinking he was a deserving
man we organized a board of managers
and engaged rooms on Howard street and
gave him the management of the Home.
All we asked was that he keep a set of
books showing what he received and ex
pended.
"Shortly after he took charge of the
new home he occupied the rooms with
his two adopted boys. He "also allowed
Mrs. Kelly, the matron, her husband, two
sons, her daughter-in-law and husband to
live in the house that was rented for or
phans.
"He requested the management to fur
nish him with kerosene, and I sent him
out a five-gallon can. He used it up in
live days and called for more. When I
asked him how he used It so quickly, he
replied that Mrs. Kelly's husband was*
afflicted with rheumatism, and they had
to burn the oil during the night to keep
his feet warm. We were so .disgusted
with his conduct and His refusal to keep
the books assigned him that we dropped
him from our rolls.
"We have opened a nice home at 32G2
Twenty-fifth street and are doing well.
We have twelve boys and a number of
little girls. The reason why we notice
his attack Is that we believe him un
worthy to call on the public for assist
ance."
BRUTAL POUND OFFICIAL
Two Warrants Out for the Arrest of
William Robling for Battery
and Vulgar Language.
Two warrants were issued yesterday
for the arrest of William Robling, a dep
uty poundmaster, and from the com
plaints made it would seem as If Robling
was trying hard to outdo his confrere,
Frank Tyrrell, who is now serving a term
in the County Jail.
Edward Loughrey, a young man living
at 334 Chapultepec street, was standing
In front of his house on Thursday, when
Robling came along in the pound wagon.
A little Russian terrier was playing In
front of the house and Loughrey grabbed
hold of the dog and turned into the gate.
Just then Robling threw his net at
Loughrey, who dodged It. Robling made
a grab at his arm and dared him to come
outside the gate and fight him. Robling
used the most filthy language toward
Loughrey. The complaint charges him
with battery and using vulgar language.
Loughrey will have a witness, Henry
Burke, a boy living on California aveune,
who was struck by Robling Wednesday
afternoon and had his eves olackened.
Mrs. Ella Gorman. 527 Chenery street,
also swore out a warrant ror the arrest
of Robling on a charge of battery. Tues
day afternoon he struck her and Emma
Koenig, a young girl, with the rim of his
net because a small dog he was trying to
catch sought shelter near them. He also
used the vilest language to Mrs. Gorman.
After the warrant was issued Poundmas
ter Osborne asked Judge Conlan to re
lease Robling on me own recognizance
when he was arrested, but the Judge re
fused. Robling was outside the hall on
his wagon, and when he was informed of
the refusal of the Jmiere he drove off
The Same Old Way.
Ting Fong, a Chinaman, who proved to
the satisfaction of the Chinese Bureau
that he was a native-born American, was
arrested yesterday by Chinese Inspector
Lynch just after he had been allowed to
land for having m' his possession a letter
of instructions telling him how he should
testify before the Bureau in order to
secure his admission. The letter had been
sent to him in China. He will probably
be deported.

SNOBBISHNESS
AT THE GREAT
PEACE JUBILEE
American Wines Are
Coldly Rejected.
BARRED IN THE BIG BANQUET
ONLY FOREIGN PRODUCTS WILL
BE LISTED.
Local Commercial Bodies Wire a
Patriotic Protest in the In
terest of California's
Worthy Vintages.
"The label on the bottle" Is doing Its j
deadly work at Chicago highly inimical I
to the Interests of American wines. The
great American city of wind and enter
prise is about to hold a grand peace Jubi
lee, in which President McKinley, his
Cabinet and the majority ot prominent
men of the country will take part. The
windup of the event which fes to celebrate
the magnificent victories of American
arms in the war with Spain is to be a
banquet at which one thousand guests
from all parts of the United States, in
cluding the President, will be present.
It would naturally be supposed that on
such an occasion American wines and
other luxuries produced by Americans
would be given a place on the historical
menu card; but it appears that no such
distinction will be accorded them.
Charies K. Bowen of the Wetmore-
Bowen Co.. well-known wine merchants,
has just returned from the big city and
he brings an account of the situation
there that puts ordinary snobbishness In
tin- shade. It occurred lo Mr. Bowen
that in connection with such an event it
would be highly proper and appropriate,
to say nothing of the demands of patriot
ism, to have American wines provided at
the banquet, lie suggested this to the
managers of the celebration and was fin
ally referred to Chairman Henrotin of the
banquet committee. Thia gentleman is
the Belgian Consul, a gourmet, connois
seur anu clubman par excellence in that
bailiwick. He will order the food and
Vines for the banquet aJid has very pro
nounced ideas as to the qualities of
American products.
"In my interview with him on the sub
ject of native wines," said Mr. Bowen
yesterday, "he had the courage to tell me
without equivocation that he was 'not
bold enough to place American wines on
the menu. 1
"I asked him if he did not think it was
a strangely bold stand for him to take
upon such a thoroughly American and
momentous occasion. According to his
proposition victory for American arms j
meant defeat fur American wines that
had so long been lighting a hard and dis
couraging battle. The chairman did not
consider these matters of particular im
portance, but called my attention to the
fact that the banquet was to cost $15 per j
plate to the banqueters and that nothing j
but the very best of Imported products j
would be ptaced on the tables. Argu
ments on consistency, patriotism, etc.,
had no effect, and he declared that he
would stand to his decision. The state
ment of facts was published by the Inter
Ocean, but no comment was made."
During the Interview Mr. Henrotin did
not have .time to state whether or not
Chicago hams and frankfurters would
figure In the big feed or whether these
articles would come from Westphalia and
the city on the Main. However, after
several days' consideration It was finally
decided that "no Spanish wines would be
used." This last severe blow to the van
quished Dons will, to a certain extent.
be softened by knowledge of the fact that
California's good ports and sherries will
also be tabooed.
California wine men have spent great
sums of money in developing foreign mar
kets for the products of their vineyards,
and are naturally deeply chagrined at re
ceiving BU< b a deliberate snub on such
a great national occasion. They most
properly remark that American products
might have been at least accorded the
honor of .1 place on the wine list, and
that there was no rale compelling ban
queters to consume them.
Mr. Bow.Â»H brought the matter before
the Manufacturers and Producers' Asso
ciation, and the result was the sending
of a dispatch yesterday to the jubilee
management that will afford them a sub
â¢ r sertolM consideration. The tele
gram follows:
HAN FP.ANCTSrn, Oct. 7. 1898.
Chairman I'eace Jubilee Committee, Chicago,
111 : In behalf of the wine Industry of Cali
fornia, we earneFtly request reconsideration
of the decision of the banquet committee of the
Peace Jubilee to exclude American wines on
that occasion. California wines obtained medals
and premiums for their excellent qualities ut
Genoa, Italy, and Dublin In 1881, Bordeaux In
[89G and only recently at the Italian exhibit
at Turin. Italy, where they obtained a diploma,
of honor.
Chicago 181 8 Peace Jubilee Is the celebration by

ent: W. C. Espy, Pioneer Rowing Club,
chairman; J. R. Bockman, Ariel Rowing
Club, secretary; A. P. Rothkopf, Dolphin
Boating Club; Julius Morton, Olympic
Boat Club, and A. H. Schimpf, Triton

regatta committee. The boats to be used
at the regatta will be transported free,
and should be at Tiburon ferry on
Wednesday evening, October 12. so that
they may be taken over to Tiburon on
Thursday morning. A committee of four
will go up to Guerneville on Thursday to
take charge of the boats and make ar
rangements for housing them.
Arrangements will also be made to find
accommodations for the contestants. It
is probable that a hotel, now vacant, will
be fitted up for this purpose. Rooms will
also be engaged in private houses in the
town.
Entries for the regatta close on Tuesday
night, October 11, and must be made with
the regatta committee at A. P. Rothkopf's

the arrangements. Delegates will bring
the entries from their clubs to this meet-
So much energy and enthusiasm are be
ing expended upon all the details l or tne
carnival, both by the people of Guerne
ville and the rowing men of this cit>,
that two days of good sport seem assured.
THE SEVENTH'S FATE DECIDED.
It Will Make Its Exit From the Serv
ice Some Time Next Week.
Next week the Seventh California Regi
ment will make its final exit from the
service of the Government, and its par
ticipation in the war will be only a mem
ory. As predicted exclusively in The
Call last Thursday week, the regiment
will be mustered out of the service. When
the order came for the regiment to go to
Manila, with the provisional clause that
such of its members as desired and could
show good cause would be mustered out
upon making their individual applications
for discharge. The Call emphatically stat
ed that this opening was given the jnen
because the War Department desired to
ascertain just what were their wishes,
and that if it was found that a majority
wanted to be mustered out General
Merriam would make a recommendation
to that effect and that then the regi
ment would be ordered mustered out.
From the official sources that has made
The Call's war news the most reliable of
any of the papers, it learned the facts in
the case and stated them, whllfe the other
papers were hinting at the facts as a pos
sibility. It has happened as The Call
predicted. Yesterday the following order
was received:
WASHINGTON, D. C, October 7, 1898.
Commanding General Department of California,
San Francisco, Cat.: Your telegram about the
Seventh California Is received and muster out
will proceed as heretofore directed, and you
will see that this Is so understood by all con
cerned. Uy order of the Secretary of War,
H. C. CORHIN, Adjutant General.
This is the final disposition of the mat
ter, and the regiment will leave the serv
ice.
Captain Pratt, the officer who has
charge of the mustering out of the regi
ment, stated yesterday that the Seventh
would probably start for Los Angeles
about Tuesday or Wednesday of next
week, where it will be furloughed for
thirty days prior to being finally mus
tered out. The regiment was paid yester
day.
The Senator was put in drydock yester
day and cleaned and scraped. She will
probably begin coaling to-day. It is the
Intention of General Merriam to get her
away about next Tuesday. While no for
mal "assignment of troops has been made
to go upon the Senator, it is generally
understood that the Third Battalion of
the Twenty-third Infantry and the Ore
gon recruits will be selected to go, and it
is not improbable that General Miller and
his headquarters may also be sent upon
the Senator. In event of General Miller
going upon the Senator the command of
the remaining troops will devolve upon
Colonel Funston, who at present com
mands the Second Bripado.

ROMANTIC
ELOPEMENT
IN A JUNK
Chinese Lovers in a
New Role.
RETURN OF THE VALENCIA
THE TROOPSHIP BRINGS A FEW
SOLDIERS JFROM HONOLULU.
Close Ocean Race to Siberia and Back
Between the Schooners H. D.
Bendixen and John D.
Tallant.
One of the most novel a\nd exciting
races ever seen on the bay todk place
yesterday. The contestants were four
Chinese junka, and the prize was a hand
some Mongolian woman. The winner
â¢will have to keep out of the way for
some time to come, as his life may pay
for his success If tho loser 3 lay haaods
on him.
There is a Chinese fishing village in San
Pablo bay, and there the Mongodiar.s
catch and dry the shrimps and email n>h
which they ship to China. As soon as a ,
6teamer begins loading for China the
Junks can be seen daily plying between
San Pablo Bay and the Mail dock with
loads of the dried fish. The principal
fisherman is named Hop Tuck, and his
daughter is an almond-eyed beauty be
loved by ever>' Chinese beau in the vil
lage. The young lady had love for Wong
Chin only, while the father favored the
suit of Shin Lun.
A marriage was arranged between Shirt
Lun and Hup Tuck's daughter, and^Vong!
Chin was in desDalr. After much talk
he finally persuaded his love to ny with
him. Early yesterday morning they grot
into one of the junks and started for San
Francisco. To a fair wind the lateen Ball
was hoisted and good progress was made.
Half an hour later their flight was dis
covered and the angry father started In
pursuit in one junk, while the deserted
lovers piled into the other two and gave
chase. The true-lovers' boat about this
time struck a calm streak, and the pur
suers gained on them rapidly. The wind
came up fresh again, and blew steadily j
until the lovers landed at Fisherman 3 ;
wharf. There they chartered a Chinese
fish wagon and were driven rapidly away.
Fifteen minutes later the other junks,
propelled by uars and sail, came, but they
were too late. The lovers had made their
escape. After a great deal of talk they
sent two of their number into China- i
town to look for the couple, and the oth- j
ers got into the junks and sailed them j
back to the village on San Pablo Bay.
The British ship Hawthornbank got in
from Hongkong, and the transport Val
encia from Manila via Honolulu yester
day. The steamer took thirty-four days
to " come over, while the sailing vessel
made the run in forty-five days. Captain
Greig of the Hawthornbank was here last
in the Elmbank. It will be remembered
that the vessel was loaded with sulphur
and caught fire at Green- street wharf, i
It took weeks to put the fire out. but at j
last it was smothered. From here the ]
Elmbank went to England, and was lost
on the Irish coast while being towed to
Liverpool. Captain Greig was then ap- j
pointed to the Hawthornbank, and this
la his first visit to this port in her. The j
vessel anchored off the Farailones last
Thursday night after an uneventful voy
age and was towed in yesterday.
"Tommy" Crowley, the boatman, met
with a painful accident while trying to I
board the Hawthornbank. He attempted |
to step aboard the quarantine boat, but
missed his footing and fell, striking his
mouth against the rail of the steamer.
His jaw was broken, and it will be some
months before he can eat solid food
again.
The Valencia stopped at Honolulu for
coal. The only passengers she brought
from Manila were Lieutenant R. H. Mi
ner, who went from here as executive of
ficer of the collier Brutus, which left here
in company with the Monterey, and J. O.
Knight, a newspaper man. From Hono
lulu she brought up Lieutenant M. L.
Berger, Corporals Sam W. Burk, Jesse
Perry. Charles U. Bell and Private Harry
P. Berry. The soldier boys at Honolulu
were kicking. There was a mistake made
in their pay roll, and instead of the
money it was returned for correction. In
consequence they will not get their money
until the Alameda reaches Honolulu. The
Valencia brings the news that the gun
boat Bennington reached Honolulu on
September 27. and that three days later
the cruiser Philadelphia was to start for
San Francisco. There- was a fire in the
cruiser's bunkers while she was returning
to Honolulu from a practice cruise, but
it did no damage and was quickly put out.
The Valencia docked at Lombard street
â wharf last night, and the work of over
haulinK her will begin to-day. She has
not suffered much during her long voyage
and looks n't to start out for Manila again
to-morrow.
The schooners H. D. Bendixsen and
John D. Tallant have just completed a
long ocean race. Both of them sailed for
the Amoor River on the same day, and
the Tallant won the race. On the way
back, however, the Bendixsen turned the
tables. They sailed from Decastres Bay
together, but the Bendixsen had to put
into Hakodate to unload 120 tons of cargo
and take in ballast. Nevertheless she ar
rived at Clallam Bay twenty-four hours
before the Tallant reached Port Town
send. The Bendixsen made the lun
across, including stop, in twenty-five
days, a very smart performance.
The rain ruined a masterpiece by W. A.
Coulter, the celebrated marine artist,
yesterday. A few days ago he decided
that the roof of his cottage at Sausalito
required painting, so yesterday morning
he got up eerly and treated It to a coat
of a beautiful dark red color. Half an
hour later it was raining in torrents, and
ever since that roof has been weeping
blood, while Coulter â well, the least said
Is soonest mended.
The Mail Company's steamer San Jose
Is laid up for repairs, so her commander,
Captain W. H. McLean, will take out the
City of Sydney.' Cautain Russ-311 of the
Sydney will take a well earned vacation.
Charles Piggott and a man named
Childs were arrested at the ferries in the
act of robbing Mrs. Charles Weinormann
of Oakland of her purse. They were
booked for grand larceny at the Harbor
police station. Pipgott was arrested on a
similar charge two months ago, but es
capod conviction.
Sutter Street Baths.
After a period of inactivity, occasioned
by a serious flre, the Sutter Street Ham
man. Turkish and Russian Baths, 416 Sut
ter street, have resumed business. To
the public this misfortune has proven a
distinct advantage, for the proprietors,
Messrs. Lindstrom & Johnson, now an
nounce a reopening of what are practi
cally new baths and on a scale of mag
nificence unequaled by any similar insti
tution on the coast.
The baths have been so thoroughly re
modeled and refurnished that old patrons
will scarcely recognize the place. Many
new features ar.d improvements, involv
ing the latest i(?jas, have been added that
will tend to itvrease the luxury and phy
sical benefit of these baths that are so
highly recommended by the medical pro
fession. The departments of both the
gentlemen -\nd ladies have received the
same thorough renovation, and upon both
only the most skilled attendants wait.
. The Institution is a mode! of convenience
and cleanliness. That this sanitary con
dition will be scrupulou.-iy maintained is
assured by the fact that the manager,
Mr. Johnson, is one of the oldest and
most experienced bath conductors in the
city.
On the second floor of the baths Is a
separate department, professionally
known as Llndstrom's Institute for Mas
sage and Swedish Movements, and con
stantly supervised by Mr. A. O. Lindstrom,
medical gymnast. This department has
received the same artistic refurnishing
' and improvement that characterizes the
entire establishment. It is provided with
all the latest and most approved appar
atus that , may be applied in rendering
relief and assistance to those who require
the beneficial aid to be derived from
either the massage or Swedish treat-
A RACE FOR A BRIDE.
-| x rONG CHIN ran away with his employer's daughter from the Chinese tishing camp in San Pablo Bay and bor
yy rowed his rival's junk to escape to San Francisco. When the fishermen discovered their loss they got into the other
Junks and gave chase, but Wong reached Fishermen's wharf first and made his escape with his lady love into China
town.

kindly tear for the poor suicide husband and chastising with Azore-manu
factured profanity the faithless wife.
At the Lisbon House drinks prevail from sunrise to the break of the
succeeding day, and the language of the Islanders is prolific of opprobrious
epithet. Consequently no phase of the sad story Is left uncared for, no
guilty party to the scandal is spared.
On Saturday last Filomena Leonora Mideiros, a Portuguese belle, from
the fair and distant island of Fayal, landed in this city. On Tuesday Vic
torino Viaera, the man, who, by reason of a contract wedding, solemnized
according to the laws of Portugal, considered himself her husband, claimed
the fair Filomena for his own. Two days later Filomena came to the un
happy conclusion that Victorino was not hnr affinity and that the mischievous
little god destined her for Manuel Marianno dos Santosâ a fact she took no
pains to conceal from her husband.
Friday Victorino returned to his home In Palo Alto hea.vy-hearted and
alone. The sight of the pretty little cottage, newly furnished ajid all ready
to receive its recreant mistress, maddened the unfortunate husband, and on
the evening of the same day, by means of a razor and a noose, he put an
end to his unhappy life.
Filomena refused to go to the obsequies, and made use of her recovered
freedom to flirt more desperately than ever with Manuel. Wednesday last
the lover's holiday came to an end, and he returned to Pinole, where he Is
employed as a laborer by Bernard, a wealthy rancher. Immediately upon his
absence the fickle maid from th< Azores turned her dark eyes in the direc
tion of Jo Silva, and when, yesterday, a message came from Manuel offer
ing the damsel a place as domestic on the Bernard ranch, Mrs. Viaera an
nounced her engagement to Silva, and with him left for Stockton, where the
latest favored lover is engaged in sheep herding.
The capacities of the Filomena heart have aroused the deepest antago
nism In the Portuguese colony. The fate of poor Viaer^rls" universally de
plored, and the woman, without a single exception, is roundly censured.
The money that brought Filomena to this city was sent by Victorino, who,
during nine years of residence on this coast, uninterruptedly shared his sav
ings with the girl towhom he was betrothed since childhood days.
Filomena met Marhiel Santos on the journey that was to land her near
her husband. Santos was returning from Fayal, where he had been to visit
his wife, who is an inmate of an aÃylum for the insane. Immediately upon
their arrival here the Intimacy of the couple was the cause of scandal. The
preferment of the woman for Santos was openly proclaimed. Friday last,
previous to Victor's return to Palo Alto, his wife and he had words, in
which Madam Victor was heard to declare that the man to whom she was
bound was not the man who could support her in the fashion she desired,
and when the spurned husband left It was with the demand of his wife ring
ing in his ears, a demand that he transfer his hard-earned savings to her.
Viaera was employed by J. A. Bowlevare as a farm laborer, and his em
ployer, as well as all the people of Palo Alto, have nothing but the kindest
words with which to speak of the unhappy ending of a well-spent life. The
poor suicide's only relative here is an uncle, Frank J. Silva, a passenger
agent for the Southern Pacific.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 8, 1898.
Marlowe and Wilkinson got "cold feet,"
and retreated behind a fence. Burke,
thinking he could arrest the murderous
tinker without assistance, waved tne
other officers back, and, approaching the
cabin, called upon Haynes to surrender.
Haynes opened the door and pointing us
revolver at Burke ordered him to leave,
under penalty of being riddled with bul
lets. Burke tried to reason with him,
stating that he was only doing his duty,
when the eccentric tinker opened fire on
him. The first shot struck Burke in the
groin, inflicting a fatal wound.
Instead of going to the assistance of
their superior officer, Wilkinson and Mar
lowe retreated behind a fence and made
a "bluff" at shooting at Haynes. Mer
chant and Kennedy emptied their re
volvers at the tinker, but failed to bring
him down. At this juncture George
Cashel the patrol-wagon driver, who was
a witness to the shooting, crept up to the
cabin and dragged the wounded officer
away. He was at once taken to the .City
and County Hospital, where he died a
short time afterward. Havnes was cap
tured without much difficulty, and is now
doing a life sentence for the murder
During the trial of the accused officers
Kennedy swore that Wilkinson had
threatened to shoot him if he took tne
stand against him. For some reason the
Commissioners concluded not to dismiss
Merchant and Kennedy, although the e\i
dence showed that they acted in the same
cowardly manner as Marlowe and \\ n
kinson.

THE KING OF
THE DUMPS IS
ON HIS METTLE
Does Battle With a
One-Armed Man.
DOGS CHEW OFF AN EAR
BUT THE MAIMED ENEMY IS
STILL UNTERRIFIED.
His Majesty Detects the Hand of
:'- Collis, but Hopes to Triumph
in the Police
Courts.
James Gallaudett, better known as the
"King of the Dumps," is in trouble again.
Like most kings, he has a war on his
hands. His adversary is a one-armed
man, J. Kramer by name. But back of
Kramer the "King of the Dumps" sees
the hand of "Uncle" Collis and the South
ern Pacific. The battle V.-111 be fought to
a finish in Police Judge Mogan's court
on the 12th of this mqnth.
According to the "King's" story Kra
mer moved on the dumps and established
a new dynasty at the suggestion of the
railroad. He built a shack at the water's
edge adjoining the "King's" boathouse.
Kramer was not content with encroach
ing un the driftwood that the "King"
had always considered his exclusive prop
erty as aquatic lord of that region. He
helped himself to the "King's" posses
sions as well.
The "King" claims that on answering 1
a knock at his boathouse door he was
thrown down and severely beaten. He
says he recognized his assailant as Kra
mer, and called loudly for help. His three
big Dane dogs answered his cries, and,
breaking their chains, came to his rescue.
The "King" says he had to beat the dogs
back from Kramer, but not until they
had chewed off one of Kramer's ears al
most and badly lacerated the other.
Before the "King" could swear out a
warrant against Kramer for assault, he
himself was arrested on a charge of bat
tery, preferred by Kramer. Judge Low
released the "King' on his own recogni
zance, and the trial was set for the 12th
of this month.
The "King of the Dumps" is still in
hopes of getting back the property on the
cormr of Mf-rrlmae and Kentucky streets.
The railroad dispossessed him of it some
months apo. The "King" had lived there
thirty years, and had himself filled in the
water and "made" the land. The Sher
iff was ordered to eject him, which he
did, moving his effects into the street.
The railroad company got the decision
against him without the case ever com
ing to trial.
The "King" moved his household goods
into his little boat-house near by. The
railroad company tore down his old house
and took possession of the land.
Then Kramer, the one-armed man, ap
peared and commenced a series of
petty annoyances, according to the
"King," ending in the assault and en
counter with the dogs.
Kramer is now minus an ear, as well as
an arm.
The "King" claims that his one-armed
adversary has been seen'in frequent con
sultation with the railroad employes, and
that fresh annoyances always followed
these conferences. Even the boys in the
neighborhood, once friendly to the
"King," have turned against him, and are
constantly annnoying him.
All this the "King of the Dumps"
claims is being done at the instigation
of the railroad people. He claims they
are after the land where his boat-house
stands, as well as the land from which
he has already been ousted.
But all hands are going to try to set
tle the dispute before Police Judge
Mogan.

in the naval battle at Manila a four-inch
I shell from the Spanish cruiser Reina

Carson City, Nev., whose skull was badly
fractured by a fall from a California
"â¢street car last Tuesday, showed signs of
Improvement last night, and the doctors
have hope of his recovery. He has not
yet regained consciousness.
BRILLIANT
EXCHANGE OF
SILVER BARS
A Financial Coup by
the Seligmans.
UNCLE SAM SAVES FREIGHT
THAT TRAINLOAD OF SILVEB
WILL NOT START.
A Quiet Deal With the Government
Which Gives Tons of Local
Silver to the
Mint.
The Seligrmans, bankers of New Tork,
London, San Francisco and elsewhere,
have just quietly effected quite a big and
brilliant deal in silver bullion with Uncle
Sam.
By it the Government will probably be
spared the cost of that spectacular trans
continental shipment of seventeen guard
ed carloads of silver bullion to the San
Francisco Mint and the smart bankers
will turn a few honest pennies.
The revenue law, passed at the last ses
sion of Congress, provided for the addi
tional coinage of 1,500,000 standard silver
dollars per month. The tide of gold has
been so great during the recent months
and the demand for subsidiary silver bo
constant, owing to the business revival,
that the three mints in commission have
been crowded with work without this
new burden.
The Philadelphia Mint could not well
coin 1,500,000 dollars a month along with
the rest of its work, and the big San
Francisco Mint, which is breaking all
mint records these days, was naturally
turned to.
But the silver bullion to be coined was
all in the East. The San Francisco Mint
has hardly any on hand. What it receives
is quickly coined mainly in small change.
The Government buys no silver. All it
receives at its mints is what comes mixed
with gold bullion to the extent of fifty
per cent or less. The purchases are of
gold and the silver parted from it is
paid for at about the market price of the
commodity.
So, if the San Francisco Mint was to
coin silver dollars in large quantities the
bullion would have to be shipped to it
from the Government vaults in the East
where it was piled up in the past. It was
determined to send 10,000,000 to 12,000,000
ounces out here. The news of it was ac
companied by the story that it was pro
posed to load a special freight train,
guard it with soldiers and send the pre
cious bars at special freight rates.
The.Seligmans control the Anglo-Cali
fornia Bank here which is the San Fran
cisco agency for J. and W. Seligman & i
Co., and they are the heaviest dealers in i
the silver bullion which reaches this im- j
portant silver market. The silver which
iinds a market here comes from Pacific
Coast points west of Denver, from Brit
ish Columbia, Mexico and Central Amer
ica. About 8.000,000 ounces a year are
refined by Selbys and by them sold to
local bankers. Perhaps 2,000,000 ounces
in refined bars reach here from other
smelters. The silver coming to San
Francisco yearly is thus approximately
10,000,000 ouncesâ about the amount of the
contemplated Government Khipment.
Practically all of this silver goes di
rect to that great sink-hole of silver,
the Orient, owing to the conditions of !
transportation and exchange. Shipments
are regulated by the condition of the
market and the price of exchange. One
steamer will take 1,000.000 ounces and the
next little or none. The New York mar
ket is too far away, and express charges
are high. The Seligmans are credited
with handling the bulk of this silver here
through the Anglo-California Bank. The j
Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and the
Yokohama Specie Bank are also dealers.
It was under these conditions that the
Seligmans hopped on to the brilliant idea ]
that had not occurred to the Secretary I
of the Treasury or anybody else, and the i
arrangement was made with the Treas
ury Department at Washington the other
day. They proposed that they deposit
silver at the /lint here and receive a cer
tificate therefor. On the presentation of
puch a certificate at the Treasury at
Washington or at the New York Sub-
Treasury they would receive the exact
amount of silver deposited here. No sil
ver would be bought or sold by the Gov
ernment, but by this simple swap of the
same stuff the Government would get its
silver transported across the continent !
with neither cost nor risk, and the bank
ers would get their silver here trans
ported to New York at the cost of a few
postage stamps and with no express
charges or exchange to pay.
So the big shipment is off for the pres
ent, and for two or three days heavy
trucks have been carting silver bars from
downtown vaults to the Mint.
