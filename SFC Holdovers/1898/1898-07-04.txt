OFF SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Sun
day, July 3 (by Herald-Call dispatch
boat Golden Rod to Kingston, Jamaica,
Monday, July 4).â Five vessels of Ad
miral Cervera's fleet have been de
stroyed by Admiral Sampson's squadron.
No American vessel has been lost.
Santiago is likely to be surrendered to
General Shafter within a few hours.
This is glorious news for the American
Fourth of July.
The Spanish Admiral, driven to desperation by the steady
advance of our troops upon Santiago and the evident intention of
the commander of our squadron to force his way into the har
bor and give battle, attempted a forlorn hope last evening.
His fleet pushed its way around the sunken wreck of the
Merrimac, and come out to sea in the bold effort to run past our
squadron and escape or to give battle.
Sampson's ships were ready. The first ship in the Spanish
squadron had not poked her nose a dozen yards beyond the nar
row entrance before she was seen by our watchful lookouts. A
moment later Admiral Sampson himself had been informed of the
news and was on the deck of the flagship signaling orders to his
commanders to close in around the mouth of the harbor and cut
off Cervera's escape.
The entire American fleet moved forward within a dozen minutes,
and in less than a quarter of an hour every vessel was crowding past
Morro Castle, and close up to the harbor, firing steadily as they ad
vanced, with the crews lustily cheering, because the movement for which
they had so long waited had at last arrived.
There was a tremendous fire from the vessels in Admiral Cervera's
squadron, as they steadily advanced, and shells fell all around the Ameri
can warships.
But their fire did little damage compared with the tremendous de
struction by the guns on the American warships. The thirteen-inch shells
of our big battleships fell with deadly effect upon the Spanish ships.
The aim of our gunners was almo&t perfect in spite of the clouds of smoke
that rolled up around the fleet. â "â ':'â ' '.â¢'â 'â¢.'â 'â â

So deadly was the aim of our gunners that three of the Spanisfc.
cruisers were soon utterly destroyed, just what ones it is not now possible
to tell.

WASHINGTON, July 4.â Shortly after 12. o'clock : . this 'â .
morning- Assistant Secretary of the Navy Allen left the : White. ;;

following statements on the bulletin board: . ;:;,â :

Washington, July 3.â
From the bent and carnage of the
battle of Santiago, where for the
last '-three (lays the American
forces', have pressed forward
against at. entrenched enemy.
Genera } Shafter to-day sent the
following dispatch, summarizing
the situation :

War; W ashington:

ALGER, Secretary of War.
The dispatch speaks for itself,
and, as Adjutant General Corbin
said, tells what a desperate fight
our gallant troops have been in.
It was received at noon to-day,
after a lull of nearly thirty-six
hours in the official information
from the field.

FIRST FLEET AT MANILA,
Continued from First Page.
Washington correspondent telegraphs :
Secretary Long received to-night a dis
patch announcing the arrival of the dis
patch boat Zafiro at Hongkong for the
purpose of filing dispatches from Rear
Admiral Dewey.
At a late hour to-night these dis
patches had not arrived, but as they do
not usually come in until morning the
authorities are not concerned over the
delay.
It is believed the purpose of the Ad
miral in sending the Zafiro to Hongkong
was merely to assure the Government
of the safety of the troops and that the
operations against Manila would be
commenced at once.
It is the understanding of the depart
ment that as soon as the American
troops have recovered from the effects
of their voyage they will at once co
operate with the insurgents and ships
for the reduction of the city, and it is
confidently expected the present week
will bring the good news that Manila
also has surrendered to the American
forces.
had reported the defenses to be
so strong it would be impossible
to carry them by storm with his
present force, there was moment
arily a wave of deep apprehen
sion. But this was not shared by
the military authorities here. All
their energies, all their attention,
was turned to meet the situation
as presented by General Shafter.
There was neither time nor dis
position to take account of what
had gone before, when the fact
was plain that the American army
had fought its way, inch by inch,
under a blazing sun,, through a
dense tropical vegetation, stead
ily advancing and beating back
the foe, taking position after posi
tion, until, as General Shafter re
ported, the town was well in
vested on the north and east by
the long drawn out line of Amer
ican troops. That was a sufficient
tribute to the valor of our brave
men, and it silenced all cavil over
the conditions now presented by
General Shafter.
It was a time for action, for re
enforcements, and toward the
Pando came with the re-enforcements
from Manzanlllo.
The first fort on the left of Canosa
is the Fuerte Pedrera, with Fuerte
Santa Ursula and Fuerte de las Can
adas covering the road from Justica,
Fuerte Benehcencia and Fuerte del
Castro on the San Juan and
execution of this end every effort
of the administration was at once
turned.
But there was other Information of a
different tenor coming about the same
time. The American army was not
alone feeling the effects of this three
days' shock of arms. Definite, posi
tive information was at hand that San
tiago had been literally torn to pieces,
and that in the wreck and ruin of de
molished buildings the Spanish casual
ties numbered fully 1000. This was a
fitting offset of any qualms raised by
the reports from the American lines.
This information came to one of the en
gineers stationed at Santiago, who re
ported to the representatives of his
country in Washington the fearful ha
voc within the city wrought by the
American army and the fleet.
The distress of the city, even before
the battle, was clearly shown by the
action of the French Consul in serving
out rationb of half a pound daily to his
fellow countrymen, a few hundred la
number, for the last onth. Evidently
there was no .ood to buy, the Spanish
military forces having taken every
available pound. Only by this official
distribution cf rations to the foreign
colony could they be kept from star
vation.
Then came the brief but graphic re
cital of the terrible effect of the Amer
ican attack from land and sea. The
bursting of shells from our fleet had
dor.c the 'test damage inside of the
city. Buildings were riddled with rifle
shot and mown down with the huge
shells and solid projectiles from the
shir I*.1 *. Most serious of all. the Spanish
commander, General Linares, occupy-
the Aguadores roads. Then an
other fort not named on the road to
Las Cruses, h^lf way down the entire
side of the bay.
Outside the circle of forts come the
line of earthworks and the line of
blockhouses, the three constituting the
immediate and most important defenses
ing a place similar :o that of General
Shafter in the American army, was se
riously wounded. This last fact had
been grudgingly admitted from Madrid,
but the report reaching here left no
room for doubt as to the seriousness of
this feature. With it was the further
fact that the Spanish casualties, even
behind entrenchments, ran up to a
thousand, and was equal to that of the
fearless men who fought in the open.
With all the lights furnished on the
situation, official and unofficial, direct
and indirect, it was apparent that each
side had suffered terribly, with not a
period of lull for those In responsibility
to measure their conditions, bury their
dead, care for their wounded and pre
pare for the graver conflict yet to come.
The President and his war advisers
remained calm throughout the trying
experiences of the day. All their at
tention was directed to the work of
preparation. The future movements
of General Shafter are well established.
They have been made known in his dis
patch, but it was demed advisable not
to make this portion public as it would
serve to advise the enemy of the Amer
ican plan. It can only be said that
General Shafter's forces will be strong
ly and favorably located, with the guns
of the American warships serving as
an additional protection to their front.
Re-enforcements will be hurried to
them, which will be ample for any
emergency, whether it be storm or
siege.
With Santiago partially wrecked and
filled with a thousand dead and
wounded, the condition there is des
perate, even critical. There is little
likelihood of any Spanish sortie in force
under such circumstances, but the pos
sibility is still open that the Spanish
garrison may seek relief by evacuating
the city and retiring to the mountain
paths to the north. But the American
plans are for offensive, vigorous action.
As General M'les said, 50,000 troops, if
need be, will be moved on Santiago; if
more are needed, then it will be 75,000.
The lesson of Santiago has served only
to enkindle a greater earnestness
throughout every avenue of official life
at the national capital. And there is
a deep-set determination to meet heroic
conditions with heroic treatment.
Following the receipt of General
Shafter's telegram there was a hurried
war conference at the White House.
Secretary Alger, accompanied by Gen
eral Corbin, reached there a few min
utes before 1 o'clock and was imme
diately closeted with the President.
Secretary Alger brought the Shafter
dispatch with him and also maps and
other data necessary for the important
meeting about to take place. General
Corbin was with the President and the
Secretary for a few minutes and then
hurried back to the War Department,
where he made public such portions of
General Shafter's dispatch as was com
paiible with the public interest As
sistant Secretary Meiklejohn, who has
a thorough knowledge of the transport
service, was also hastily summoned
and reached the White House about 1
o'clock. The conference lasted for
some time.
General Miles, who also was at the
White House, said that re-enforce
ments would be rushed to the assist
ance of General Shafter, and if neces
sary, these would aggregate 50,000 men,
though the general had no idea that
such a number would by any means
be necessary.
The combined American and Cuban
forces now under the command of Gen
eral Shafter amounted approximately,
he said, to 23,000 men, while those
available for the Spaniards were prob
ably 23,000 soldiers. These included,
however, the men at Holguin, presum
ably about 10,000, and the force under
another Spanish general, amounting to
about 8000 men.
General Miles d not say whether the
two bodies of men last referred to had
actually joined General Linares, but
the understanding here is that they
have not. Colonel Humphries is in
charge of the transport service with
Shafter's army, and will send back
to Tampa the vessels that can be
spared as rap'lly as possible. In fact,
word has been -"ceived that the trans
ports had started for the United States
this lorning.
If poss the War Department will '
send 35,000 men from Tampa on uiese
transports. Six vessels have been re
cently loaded with men, munitions,
arms, supplies, etc., and are now either
at Key West or oi their way to rein
force Shafter's army. Included in this

effect on our troops under Genera
Kent when assaulting San Jaur
Heights on Friday.
expedition are some batteries of artil
lery. In all tl.ese forces constitute
about 2o( or 3000 men.
General Miles, in the course of a brief
talk, said to-day that General Shatter
might contemplate the withdrawal of
his forces to the highlands in the direc
tion of Sibonf\, whore they would be
near the sea. This, however, would be
a temporary expedient, enabling the
soldiers to rest and prepare for the
work ahead
Th- officials hope to rush the rein
forcements to General Shafter, so that
there will be f rom 32,000 to 35,000 men
under his command within the next ten
days, and sooner if this can be ar
ranged. This is exclusive of the insur
gents, . horn General Garcia has
been able to bring to Shafter's com
mand approxi ately 4000 men. There
\verÂ« about 15,:00 men and officers in
the expedition that set out from Tampa
less than a month ago. These have
since been reinforced by the troops of
Brigadier General Dyffield's command,
amounting to 3000 men and consisting
of the Thirty-third and Thirty-fourth
Michigan and the Nint'. Massachusetts
regiments. Th â¢ first 1400 of General
Duffield's brigade have been with Shaf
ter for a week, while the remainder
have just debarked.
During the past week a expe
dition of large proportion was sched
uled to leav rampa, carrying a good
porti n of General Simon Bnyder's divi
sion of the Fourth Corps as reinforce
ments for General Shatter. Assistant
Secretary Mciklejohn said to-day that
eleven transports were available to
carry Snyder's troops, and. while with
out official information on the subject
he assumed th^t probably 5000 of them
were on the way in these transports to
join those in Santiago Province. The
other troops to be sent to the aid of
General Shafter will, according to the
understanding here, be the remaining
portion of General Snyder's division

LINARES' WOUND
SO SERIOUS AS
TO RETIRE HIM

Command of the Spanish
porces at Santiago.
Special Cable to The Call and th* !S>*v York: Herald. Copyrighted, 1808,
by James Gordon liennett.
WITH THE A*RMY AT SAN JUAN, CUBA, July 1, by Herald-Call
dispatch boat Golden Rod to Pert Antonio, Jamaica, July 3. â I have
received positive information that General Linares, commander of the
Spanish forces about Santiago, was bo seriously wounded during the
fighting to-day that he had to retire. General Vara del Rey succeeded
to- his command.
Ceneral Linares had thrown himself into the fore front of the battle
from the minute the American forces under the command of Major Gen
eral Shafter effected a landing in Cuba. General Linares went with
his troops to the plateau opposite Altares, and frc-m .there witnessed
the landing of General Shafter's troops. He it was who planned the
ambuscade at La Quasina, in which the Rough Riders were caught
and Hamilton Fish Jr. and a half dozen others killed.
General Linares remained at" that point, taking personal charge of
Ms men and encouraging them to make a desperate resistance to the
advance of our troops. He was at the head c-f his men in the several
skirmishes that took place while the American troops were fighting
their way foot by foot from Juragua to Sevilla. He had his head
quarters in Sevilla when General Shafter's men made an assault
against that place, and he was one of the last to retire when the Ameri
cans drove the Spaniards back toward Santiago.
From the moment ef our attack on the enemy's outer defenses this
morning General Linares was much in evidence. He went to the front
to take personal command of his men. Mounted on a spirited horse
the Spanish general rode up and down the lines before his troops,
directing their defense of the city's intrenchments and freely expos
ing himself to our fire.
While General Linares was thus inspiring hig men to bravery by
his own actions he was struck by a bullet and fell from his horse. He
was surrounded immediately, and while the Spaniards were fighting
fiercely to keep back the Americans General Linares was carried to a
point of temporary safety in the city by members of his staff.
General Vara del Rey at once assumed command of the Spanish
soldiers.

Comment of the London
Papers on Battles.
"NET CAST TOO WIDELY"
THE AMERICANS SHOULD HAVE
FIRST TAKEN HAVANA.
Now That the Spaniards Have "Vin
dicated Their Honor" the Times
Says They Should Seek
Terms.
LONDON, July 3. â The Daily
Graphic, in its editorial, observes:
"The signal gallantry and devotion
displayed by both Spaniards and Amer
icans sends a thrill of pride through
out the Anglo-Saxon world. The
story of the splendid manner in which
j the Rough Riders carried San Juan is
instinct with the indomitable spirit of
Balaklava."
The Daily Graphic says, however,
that "the blunder lies deeper than any
mere temporary miscalculation," add
ing that "the Americans cast their net
too widely, as it might have been better
! to have left Santiago ami Manila alone
; and to have concentrated their efforts
j upon Havana."
The Times this morning, discussing
the fighting at El Car.ey, says:
"Both sides have shown- courage of
a very high order, and it is hard to say
whether the splendid dash and bravery
of the American advance in the teeth
| of a galling fire, or the stubborn ten
acity of the Spanish defense is the more
admirable. Both sides have learned
Ito appreciate the splendid military
qualities of their adversaries. It is a
I pity that enemies who have shown
â  themselves such worthy foemen in the
I field cannot see their way to save blood
shed by coming immediately to an ar
rangement on a peaceful basis.
"The Spaniards have vindicated
their honor, and if they were wise, they

would now prove their common sense by
offering terms to their opponents, terms
which if they were reasonable, would
almost certainly be discussed in a gen
erous spirit."

SHAFTER, Friday, July 1, eveningâ
By the Associated Press dispatch boat
Cynthia, via Port Antonio, Saturday,
and Kingstc-n, Sunday, July 3, 2:30
a. m.â Although it is impossible at this
time to give a list of the dead or
wounded, it is safe to say that the loss
in General Lawton's division will be 150
killed or wounded.
Among the officers wounded are:
COLONEL CARPENTER, command
ing the Seventh Infantry.
LIEUTENANT COLONEL PAT
TERSON, commanding the Twenty
second Infantry, will probably recover.
LIEUTENANT BESARO, Adjutant
of the Seventh Infantry, wounded
twice.

CAPTAIN JACKSON at Company G,
Seventh Infantry, shor in the left
breast.
LIEUTENANT CHARLES E.
FIELD, Second Massachusetts, shot
through the forehead.
General Ludlow's horse was killed
under him. â -
In General Lawton's division the Sec
ond Massachusetts had, up to the
middle of the day, suffered the heaviest
loss, although other regiments were
more actively engaged during the after
noon.
A conservative estimate by army men
â not official â is that our casualties
during yesterday's fighting were nearly.
I If not quite, a thousand, about fifteen
I per cent of which were deaths.
To-day's casualties of the American
side were much lower, because our
troops had been well entrenched the
night before.

casualties in the battle before Santiago,
so far as obtainable:

The.se are among the notable excep

; dust:' "Jack" ' Ross, one ;of the New
1 "England, passengers, reports the loca- i
â¢oÂ° tioji" of river boats as follows:
"The-May .West will likely be the first
r steamer, into St.' MJcnael." "We passed
â¢ .her June 6, 100 miles down ti.e. river j
"from Dawson. She was heavily laden !
with' passengers. The following day
the Victoria was passed 165 miles from
0 Dawson. â¢ The barge Seattle No. 1 was '
' temporarily hung on a bar twenty
- miles above Circle City. She has 175 pas
sengers 'aboard. "On June 8 the Gov
ernor Stoneman, with a"number of pas
sengers, was ashore .on a bar at Fort !
Yukon. â¢ They, expected to float her the
next 'day. Forty miles below Fort Yu
kon we passed the steamer Hattie B. of
San .Francisco. She was on a bar, but
with eVery probability of soon getting
" into the channel again.
''The 'river boats of the two big com- ,
. mercial companies withstood the ice !
break. good shape. The Bella and.
i ! another steamer which had been forced :
â¢' upon an island opposite Circle City had
been "skidded into deep water and
, â¢ started for Dawson. The Weare, Ham
Â° ilton, ' Alice; Margaret and Thomas
Dwver wore on their way up the river
and making good time. - The Healy and
St. Michael -were on the lower river
â¢ bound, up." â¢ â¢
An interesting story of the conditions
at Dawson is told by Henry Anderson
BoB of -San. 'Francisco. .He went north last
summer and worked for a lay on No.
200 below Discovery on Bonanza Creek.
He has" worked hard and returns with
95000. To The Call correspondent he ;
- said:
'.'The' men who came down on the New
England are all workers for wagesâ
that is, they have depended on their
bande for their bread. Many of them
own claims in- the Klondike, but nearly
"all of them have either worked for
wages in the camp during the last
, winter or else have worked on lays.
*"Their : success has been moderate; none
of them have i â â â â â  a heavy winners, like
McDonald'. Clarence Berry and other
pld, timers in the country. All of them,
however, have some money.
"We" all floated down the Yukon from
Dawson in open boats. The trip was
I pleasant enough, but there was -no
luxury about it. On our way down we
passed a number of river steamers
bound for Dawson, and we saw some
that will not go up the river for many
weeks yet, being stuck on sandbars.
The first river steamer to bring out
mMi with gold will probably be the
I May West, which was within a day's
run of Dawson when we passed her
coming down the river. The Hamilton
was under good headway going up
lh river when we passed her between
Anvik and Nulato. She will probably
bring down a big list ,of passengers
and gold. : â¢
"Want of everything in the way of
panitary arrangements in Dawson is
the ojoet unfortunate characteristic of
the place. The streets are covered with
filth and refuse. - The summer months
breed disease under natural conditions,
and I greatly fear for the people of
Dawson when once the hot weather of
this season begins.
"A lew days before I left Dawson the
Yukon rose suddenly until the principal
streets of the city were water. This
lasted for two days. The Gold Com
missioner and his force of clerks were
driven to the upper story of the build
ing they occupied. The mounted police
were driven out of their quarters by the
high water and several stores lost
something in the way of damaged
goods. The people went about in high
topped boots or boats. Then the river
feu again and traffic was resumed as
usual..
'"Late in May several boats contain
ing new - comers from the outside
reached Dawson. They came at the
rate of ten and twelve boats a day for
a week or more. These people sledded
their boats and outfits across Lake Le
barge and followed the ice out of the |
river. One man brought 300 or 400
papers containing accounts of the dis
pute between this country and Spain.
They sold like wildfire at from $1 to $5
each.
"On an island above Circle City sev
eral steamers have gone aground. The
Weare. Bella, Victoria and St. Michaels
were stuck on dry land, but most of
them had succeeded in getting off when
we passed. The others had gone into
winter quarters near Circle City and
the ice pack had forced them up onto
the beach. The receding waters left
them high and dry on the bank. It is
problematical whether they will get oft!
uninjured or not. They will have to be
blasted off with giant powder.
"The safes in Dawson are all full of
gold left over from last year. There
must be at least $5,000,000 in dust which
was mined last season and which the
companii b oÂ»uld not send out on ac
count of the low water. In many cases ]
the trading companies have refused to i
lake the gold of the miners because
they have no way to keep it. This con
dition resulted in the calling of a
miners' meeting in March to provide
Borne wav to care for the dust after it
was taken out. Arrangements were
made with the mounted police to store
the dust in their barracks, where it
will be under guard and perfectly safe.
"At Dawson, while there has been no
starvation or food shortage, prices of
all kinds of edibles are high. An ordi
nary meal at a restaurant costs $2 50.
The meal consists of a piece of cariboo
steak, some dried vegetables, bread,
butter and coffee. These, with bacon
and beans and canned goods, comprises
the Hat of edibles in the camp. Of
coarse it has grown very monotonous
to the inhabitants of the camp. Scurvy
is common not only in Dawson, but
also in the diggings on the banks of the
gold-bearing streams.
"Beside scurvy the miners are afflicted
with typhoid fever and pneumonia. The
only hospital in Dawson, conducted by
the Catholic sisters, is full of patients '
all the time. It has a capacity of per- ,
haps thirty people, and all the accom- |
modations are taken. Victims of the (
diseases I have enumerated are dying <
at the rate of tlm a day. As yet how
ever, the unhealthy season has only
begun.
"On June 4 the Catholic Church j
caught fire and was almost entirely de- !
stroyed. An exploding lamp caused
the. conflagration, which endangered
the Catholic Hospital, it being located
near the church."
George Merwin and Michael Chris
tensen, who left San Francisco a year
ago, are glad to be among the return-
Ing passenrers. They have been work
ing on a lay on Bonanza Creek and
claim to have made some good strikes.
The story of the trip of the New
England Is full of interest. She left
Seattle on May 22, towing the river
steamers Rock Island No. 1 and Rock
Island No. 2. She laid up two days in
a bay at Kodiak Island and six days in
Chiquik Bay. Otherwise her passage
as far as Bering Sea was made success
fully and without delay. Pome ice was
encountered in Bering waters and a
day's delay caused. St. Michael was
reached on June 21 without a stop hav
ing been made at Dutch Harbor. All
the ice went out of the Norton Sound
on June 16, and the schooners Bartlett,
Watson and Leeds came in shortly
after. Their trips from Seattle were
uneventful. The Alaska Commercial
and Canadian Pacific companies river
steamers had been completed and were
awaiting the arrival of steamers with
machinery.
The officers of the tug were much
surprised to find some thirty miners at
St. Michael who had in their hurry to
get out of the country risked the trip
down the Yukon in small boats. Eigh
teen of them, all the New England had
I room for. paid big prices to be brought
; to Seattle.
About a day's run out from Bering
. Pea the steamer St. Paul .was seen
i rushing toward St. Michael. She was
racing against the steamer Roanoke,
which was rushinp along at full speÂ«d
dragging a river steamer in her wake.
The steamer Bertha also was passed in
Bering Sea, as well as the steamer
llivaJ with a river steamer in tow.
The cutter Bear left Dutch Harbor on
June 23 on her long trip to the relief of'
the imprisoned whalers in the Arctic,
to whose rescue some of her officers
have been working their way overland
since last fall.
Tho New England towed the bark

of Dutch Harbor and started them

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JULY 4, 1898.
ONE OF THE MEN WHO DIED FOR HIS COUNTRY,
Captain W. W. O'Neil, commanding a company in Roosevelt's Rough
Riders, had a most adventurous career. He was better known on the
Pacific Coast as "Bueky O'Neil, and resided for many years at Prescott,
of which town he had been Mayor and was once Probate Judge and also
Sheriff of the county. At the last general election he was a candidate for
Congress on the Populist ticket, but was defeated. He was a newspaper
man of ability and at different times had been interested in Arizona jour
nals, both as editor and proprietor. He had acquired a reputation, how
ever, as a writer of short stories and sketches of frontier life, many of
them of considerable merit. Latterly he had devoted his time and energy
largely to the development of mining properties, of which he was a large
holder.
BATTERIES OF
MORRO FORT
DESTROYED
Guns at the Entrance to
Santiago Harbor Quickly
Silenced.
Spanish Flag* Brought Down by
a Splendid Shot From the
Oregon.
OFF SANTIAGO DE CUBA, July 2
(via Port Antonio, Jamaica, and King
ston, July 3). â The men of the flagship
New York were a pretty tired lot, after
nine hours' fighting yesterday, when
they turned out at 4 o'clock this morn
ing. At 6 o'clock the fleet went to gen
eral quarters. The knowledge that
Morro Castle was not to be spared
created much interest and the greatest
satisfaction among the gunners.
Rear Admiral Sampson said to the
correspondent of the Associated Press,
i shortly before the firing commenced:
"General Shafter sent me word last
night that the batteries at the south of
the harbor had fired on his troops. I
am almost certain that General Shafter
is mistaken, as all our information
shows that no guns bear shoreward.
However, I thought it best to bom
bard a train to-day. It will be useful
and may have a moral effect that will
assist the army."
With the flagship New York leading
the eastern end of the crescent of ships
the fleet steamed in shore 2000 yards
from Morro until in a position to enfi
lade both the eastern batteries.
At 5:45 the firing commenced. The
sea was smooth and a light breeze was
blowing.
For the urst te,n minutes the marks
manship of the gunners was splendid.
One of the eastern batteries was so
badly punished that not a shot was
fired from it during the engagement.
A few small sh-''s from the western
batteries dropped around the ships, but
hit nothing. ,
The terrific fusillade of heavy shells
from all the battleships of the United
States fleet silenced the fire from the
shore in short order. One particularly
good shot from the flagship New York
sent a gun on one of the eastern bat
teries flying high into the air and enor
mous red clouds of earth and debris
arose all around Morro. The smoke
from the ships drifted from east to
west.
At 6:30 o'clock the firing. had become
slower and more deliberate. The In
diana, Oregon and Massachusetts were
signaled to go right in front of the har
bor to shell the Punta Gorda batteries
inside, on the eastern arm. They
steamed to within 2000 yards of the
shore. The Oregon took a shot at
Morro Castle and down came the Span
ish flag. At the sight of this splendid
piece of marksmanship the crews of the
different ships cheered enthusiastically
for several minutes.
The three battleships then kept up an
Incessant fire on the Punta Gorda bat- j
teries, doing great havoc to the fortifi- ]
cations and the works in the course of
construction. Not a shot came from
the enemy.
The ships contented themselves by
taking occasional shots at Morro |
Castle. Its ancient battlements were j
knocked to pieces and great holes
loomed up in its parapets.
At 7:25 o'clock Admiral Sampson
hoisted the signal, "Cease firing," but j
it was half an hour later before the j
Oregon had fired her last shot.
As the ships returned to the blockad
ing stations two futile shots were fired '
at them from five-inch rapid fire guns
on one of the western batteries.
ON BOARD THE ASSOCIATED
PRESS DISPATCH BOA'l CYNTHIA,
off Santiago July 2, via Port Antonio
and Kingston, July 3.â A half-hour af
ter the bombardment ceased this morn
ing Rear Admiral Sampson .aid to a
correspondent f the Associated Press
that he was well satisfied with the re
sults and regarded the attack as the
most destructive yet made by the
American navy on Santiago. He also
believed, he said, that the moral effect
would be sure to be good, and would
tend to dishearten the Spanish troops
and to encourage our own.
While the -^ irai was talking with
the correspondent an orderly reported
to Captain Chadwick, who was present
in the admiral's cabin, that the Spanish
had raised a very small flag on the
western tower of Morro Castle to re
place the colors sent to earth by the
Oregon. Captain Chadwick laughed,
saying:
"Oh, well, we will just have to knock
that down, too, when we get ready."
As soon as the bombardment closed
Admiral Sampson sent an officer on
shore to commui.icate with the land
forces, and expressed* eagerness to learn
what was being done on shore. Neither
he nor Captain Chadwick sa.d so In
plain terms, but it was evident that
both believed Santiago would be ours
by sunset to-day.
Before the Cynthia had gained an
offing of ten miles from El Morro, at
the entrance to Santiago harbor, huge
columns of gunpowder smoke could be
seen slowly climbing skyward against
the background of the mountain at
whose base Santiago lies. At 11 o'clock
this morning the smoke covered the en
tire valley in which the city is, and had
grown into the semblance of a huge
silver-gray pall, edged with black, and
overhanging the greatest struggle of
the present war.
Up to the hour mentioned the fleet
was still visible, and no signs of a re
newed bombardment are to be seen.
Frcrni the fleet nothing whatever
could be seen of the fighting around
Santiago, which is not more visible
from the sea than is Philadelphia from
the Atlantic, and it is doubtful whether
even the sound of cannonading could
make its way to the shore line since
the breeze was out from the land.
To the correspondent Admiral Samp
son reiterated his belief that Hobson
and his comrades were safe in the town
of Santiago. P.oth Admiral Sampson
and Captain Chadwick looked well,
though tired.
CHILE DECLINES TO
SELL THE O'HIGGINS
Neither Spain Nor the United States
Can Purchase the Formidable
Cruiser.
NEW YORK, July 3.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Chile has
declined to sell the armored cruiser
O'Higgins to the United States. On
good authority I learned to-day that
this Government, through a private
firm in New Y"ork, had attempted to
purchase the cruiser, but on account of
the position of neutrality which the
Chilean Government has assumed the
purchase could not be effected. Nego
tiations were started in Washington
some time ago when the Government
received a report from its agents in
London that Spain had bought Uie
O'Higgins. Fearing the report might
be true, this Government offered to
purchase her. Owing to Chile's refusal
the Navy Department now believes the
cruiser wil not be sold to either Spain
or the United States.
CEBVERA-S
FLEET SUNK
Continued from First Page.
Furor and Terror were torpedo
boat destroyers, and the Reina
Mercedes was an old vessel that
was sunk a short time ago by a
shell from Admiral Sampson's
fleet. The Terror was not with
the fleet at Santiago, but is sup
posed to be at San Juan, Porto
Rico, undergoing repairs made
necessary by an encounter with
the St. Paul a few days ago.
In addition to the foregoing
mentioned vessels, there were
two torpedo boats and a coliier
in the Spanish fleet originally.
Whether the collier was at San
tiago or not is not known.
NEW fORK, July 3.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald sends
the following: President McKinley and
his Cabinet have 'been deliberating to
day upon the important and gratifying
news from the front.
According to dispatches received from
Colonel Allen, In charge of the cable
station at Playa del Este, by General
Greely, stationed in New York, and
transmitted to the Secretary of War,
Admiral Sampson has met and de
stroyed all of Admiral Cervera's fleet
except one vessel, which the vessels of
his squadron are now pursuing, and
General Shafter has demanded and mo
mentarily expects the surrender of San
tiago.
According to the message which first
came through the source indicated, Ad
miral Cervera's fleet, in desperate
straits, made an effort to leave the har
bor and run the gauntlet of the Ameri
can fleet. He was partially successful,
but as met by a fierce fire from the
vessels of Admiral Sampson's squadron,
which, following in hot pursuit, en
gaged and destroyed all the vessels in
the Spanish West Indian squadron, ex-
cept one.
A later report was to the effect that
Admiral Sampson had forced his way
into the harbor, and had destroyed all
of Admiral Orvera's ships.
The President and his advisers are
eagerly awaiting official dispatches
from General Shatter or Admiral Samp
son to know exactly what has hap
pened. They feel satisfied that Admiral
Sampson has met Cervera's fleet and
credit tho report from Lieutenant Col
onel Allen that they have all been de
stroyed exc<er>t one, but they do not
know whether the engagement occurred
inside or outside the harbor. They
have one dispatch from General Shaf
ter filed at 3 o'clock this afternoon. The
general stales he has demanded and
expects the surrender of Santiago. He
also confirms the report via Madrid to
night to the effect that General Linares
has been irortally wounded and half
his command has been rendered hors
dv combat.
Another dispatch was received at the
War Department this afternoon from
Colonel Wanger, stating that Pando
had not yet arrived and that his force
] consisted of but 5000 men. General
i Garcia has occupied such a position
: with his 3000 men as to prevent the en
trance of Pando into Santiago. From
'â â  all Information the authorities have at
hand, they at the hour this dis
patch is filed consider Spain's naval
power in the Atlantic has been de
stroyed, and that Santiago de Cuba is
j now at the mercy of General Shatter's
1 army and Admiral Sampson's fleet.

ESCAPING VIZCAYA
TO BE PURSUED BY
TWO FLEET CRUISERS.
NEW YORK, July 3.â A Washington
special to the Journal says: The Viz
caya, supposed to be the ship which
escaped from the harbor, is one of the
fastest war vessels afloat. She is an
armored cruiser, really a second-class
battle-ship, and can do better than 21
knots an hour. She made the speed
mentioned in her trip from New York
to Havana last March.
No ship of the regular American
navy can make the speed of the Viz
caya. It was reported to-night at th->
Bureau of Navigation that the Vizcaya
will be pursued for a fight or surrender
by the Brooklyn and New York. It is
not expected the escaping vessel will
try to make PnÂ»-tr> Rico, but will take
a long run to the south, and then
make straight away for the Spanish
coast. The Spanish vessel is swifter
than either of her pursuers, but the
American vessels will take the chances
of overhauling and sinking or v cap
turing her.
Five Deaths by Drowning.
CLEVELAND. 0.. July 3.â Five persons
were drowned in the lake to-day. H. H.
Kralick and Miss Joannette Kaiser lost
their lives while bathing in the presence
of several hundred. They were floating on
a log when Miss Kaiser lost her hold and
sank. Fralick tried to save her and both
went down. Two unknown men rocked a
boat, which capsized and both were
drowned. One man was a cripple. Frank
Shubbeck, a news agent, lost his life I
while bathing.
CAMARA'S
TURN WILL
COME SOON
Spain's Last Peet to
h|unted Down and
Destroyed.
Watsoo's Squadron Will Be; f|eK
Enforced and at Once Start
for Port Said. v
NEW YORK, July 3.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: With Cervera's fleet destroy
ed, the armorclad's of the American
navy will now devote their exclusive
attention to Admiral Camara's com
mand and the coast of Spain. It can
be stated on authority that the moment
word is received from Admiral Samp
son confirming the War Department's
report of the destruction of Cervera's
fleet, instructions will be Issued di
recting the increase of Commodore
Watson's eastern squadron, which will
at once be sent In pursuit of Camara,
and a second fleet will undoubtedly be
formed for operations against the
coast of Spain.
Spain now has only Camara to de
pend upon, and It is, therfore, impos
sible for her to send a squadron to
bombard American ports or to relieve
her troops in Cuba and Porto Rico. In
view of the destruction of Cervera's
fleet, it is the confident prediction of
the officials that Camara will be or
dered to return to peninsular waters
with his command.
The latest advice received from
Deputy Consul Watts, who is at Port
Said, anounced that at 1 o'clock this
afternoon the Spanish vessels were still
coaling just outside the three-mile
limit.
In official circles it *is stated the
Spaniards are evidently coaling as
much as possible in order that time
may be consumed â time which their
Government is apparently anxious to
obtain before giving sailing orders to
Admiral Camara. The fact that two
of the vessels of the Spanish fleet, one
j collier and one other supply ship,
! passed through the canal is no indica
â  tion, the authorities now believe in the
light of recent developments, that the
entire squadron will follow them.
"The Herald stated the matter cor
rectly this morning," said an official
with whom I talked, "when it was an
nounced that Admiral Camara, even if
he does continue his voyage to the
Philippines, will, not go near Manila.
He will land his troops at some other
point and defend it against Admiral
Dewey's squadron.
Upon the conclusion of the war, Spain
will assert that the American Govern
ment simply holds one little city in an
archipelago of 400 islands, and, there
fore, is not entitled to their possession.
Commodore Watson's duty will be to
check this plan of attack. As the Her
ald stated, he will follow Camara, even
to the Philippines, and, when he finds
him, will destroy the fleet under that
officer. The Eastern squadron has two
battleships assigned to it. It may be
increased by a third, leaving Rear Ad
miral Sampson with one first-class bat
tleship, one second-class battleship and
two armored cruisers to bombard the
ports of Spain. There is no necessity
of keeping any armorclads in American
or Cuban waters, as protected cruisers,
gunboats and auxiliary vessels can eas
ily take care of the* naval force of Spain
cooped up In the harbors of Cuba and
Porto Rico.
CAMARA'S VESSELS
STILL OFF PORT SAID.
Weather Continues Too Rough to
Permit of the Coaling of
the Fleet.
PORT SAID, July 3.â Admiral Ca
mara's fleet is outside the harbor. The
weather yesterday and to-day has been
too heavy for the Spanish vessels to
coal:
CAIRO, July 3.â lt is rumored here
that more Spanish ships are arriving at
Port Said.
GIBRALTAR, July 3.â Ten thousand
Spanish soldiers and 300 civilians are
employed on the defenses of Algeciras,
on the west side of the Bay of Gibral
tar. It is reported that the Spanish
forces in this district will be raised to
25,000?
SENATE TO WORK ON
THE FOURTH OF JULY
An Emergency Deemed Necessary by
the Friends of Hawaiian
Annexation.
WASHINGTON, July 3.â The Senate will
be in session on the Fourth of July, an
unusual Bitting, but deemed necessary by
the friends of the Hawaiian annexation
resolution. It is probable that the week
will be consumed in the discussion of the
resolution unless a vote is reached ne;tr
the middle of the week, which some of
the Senators have hoped for.
The House will not be in session until
Tuesday. There is no definite programme
determined upon for the week. The â  in
ference report upon the deficiency bill will
be considered Tuesday, and it ma; pro
voke considerable debate. The Naval Af
fairs Committee has a number of bills
which it desires to bring up, and a day
may be given to it. The naval personnel
measure is the most important. If it can
bel reached under call of committees an
effort will be made to take up the anti
scaiping Dill. The bill to incorporate the
International American Bank will follow
the deficiency bill conference a-id continue
before the House until disposed of.

. PLANNING THE DRILLS.
Officers Will Consider Schemes
for Advanced Instruction
of Their Commands.
The folowlng circular issued yesterday
by Brigadier General Miller to the First
I Brigade is one of the most important
I that has come out. It bears directly
upon military discipline and drill, for
which General Miller is noted:
The commanding officers of organizations be-
I longing to the brigade will pubmit schemes of
! Instruction for their commands for the ensu
j ing ten days, commencing July 5. IS&S. The
ln.-tructlons should be progressive, the last
! three of four days fur cavalry, Infantry and
battalion of heavy artillery-, California, devoted
i to marching with advance and rear guards and
: flanking parties, establishing pickets and recon
noitering the streets of a city or village. For
taken to once more place the guard of the
State on a footing of efficiency. In view
of the fact that not more than one-half
of the maximum strength of any of the
companies of the National Guard was
mustered Into the volunteer service, it
is probable that companies will be re
cruited to the minimum strength, namely
fifty, so that when the guardsmen return,
and it is the hope of every one that they
will, they may return to their former
station, if they so desire. If that is done
it will give the State an armed force that
may be called upon at any time In case
of internal trouble.
In speaking of the objection that was
made to the reorganization of the guard
on the ground that there was no appro
priation for uniforming or equipping the
same, a retired officer said on Saturday
thru that would not be a serious objec
tion for the reason that the credit of
the State is good, and that there are a
number of citizens who would advance
tho means to rehabilitate the guard,
trusting to the Legislature to reimburse
them. He was of the opinion that the
State should not he allowed to remain for
any length of time without a stronger
force than now exists, as it is not known
at what moment the friends of Spain
might create a disturbance in portions
of California now without military pro
tection. While It is true, he admitted,
that upon proper representation the vol
unteer force could be secured to give
such aid as might be required, still there
! would have to be so much red tape un
wound and rewound that in the meantime
much damage might be done, while if
there was a small force oi National
Guard In the vicinity of where such
trouble might start it could be checked
in its inciplency. "But," as the speaker
said, "that is a matter for the consid
eration, of those who are at the head
of the State military affairs."
At Division Headquarters those in
charge are receiving the reports of the
several captains whese commands of the
National Guard have been accepted and
these are being arranged in a systematic
manner so that the exact status of the
men and of the company property may be
known. As the State has furnished to the
United Stat<s a great deal of property be
! longing to the State, the accounts must be
| made up to have a correct debit and cred
it account with Uncle Sam. This will take
some time and will not be completed un
til after the Eighth Regiment shall have
been mustered in to the last man.
It is asserted by those competent to
judge that the several companies of the
Fifth Infantry of the N. G. C. went be
fore the mustering officer in better condi
tion than the majority of the companies
that had preceded them and that when
they went into camp at Fruitvale they
were tn first class condition. It Is evident
that those who were at the head of the
movement profited by the mistakes that
were made In the first instance and took
the precaution to avoid them.
The members of thÂ« Seventh Regiment
of California Volunteers, recruited from
the ranks of the Seventh Regiment of the
National Guard, and those of the Eighth
Regiment of Volunteers, recruited from
the Seconfl and Fifth regiments of the
National Guard, feel reasonably sure that
they will be sent to the front with the
fourth expedition, consequently they are

HAD FRIENDS HERE.
Some of the Killed and Wounded
Are Well Known to the
Military Officers in
San Francisco.
The general topic of discussion among
the officers at the Presidio Club yesterday
afternoon was the battle of Santiago. The
consensus of opinion was that if the re
sult for the Americans so far was no
more than a drawâ as General Miles
called itâ then the situation was not quite
so bad as some might suppose, and that
Santiago is doomed to fall there seemed
to be no doubt, but its capture, it was
conceded, would require re-enforcements
and much more time than at first expect
ed. In one sense the temporary backset,
as one of the officers put it, would have
a healthy effect in that it would convince
people that the war with Spain is by no
means a picnic, and that the Spaniards
are fighters. Hereafter our Government
would be better prepared before giving
battle, and less attention would be given
to the clamor of those who have criticized
the administration for moving so slowly.
Many of the officers killed or wounded
in the battle of Santiago were known to
the officers now in San Francisco, al
though but few of them ever served in the
Department of California. They are all
highly esteemed by their fellow officers
here.
lieutenant Ord of the Sixth Infantry,
who is among the killed, was the son of
the late Major General Ord. He enlisted
as a private in the First Infantry while
it was stationed at the Presidio and was
soon promoted to be a non-commissioned
officer, leaving here with the First In
fantry, he was promoted to a lleutency
and transferred to the Sixth.
Captain Taylor of the Ninth Cavalry,
happy, but those who were mustered in
from the Sixth Regiment of the National
Guard are despairing of being ordered
where their fellow national guardsmen
have been or will be sent. They feel that
selecting for the field of action organ
izations of the State mustered in after
theirs was is- an uniust discrimination
against them. They hold that as far as
the State troops are concerned they
should have been sent to the front in the
order in which they presented themselves
for service.

there was a business meeting in the as
sembly hall, at which Rev. Father Crow
ley presided. After a few words of wel
come Father Crowley gave a detailed ac
count of the work done since the last
meeting. He stated tnat during the half
year more than 250 boys had been re
ceived into the home and provided for.
Since the departure of the regular troops
for Cuba and the going out of our volun
teers to Manila there has been a very per
ceptible increase in the application for ad
mission. "The children of the soldiers
must be looked after at all events," re
marked the reverend speaker, "and we
want your co-operation in providing for
them proper food and clothing. Their
fathers are fighting for our flag on for
eign soil, and they must not feel that the
children whom they love are in dire dis
tress in a land of plenty. These are our
present care and concern and to them
we must devote our best efforts as well as
our last dollar."
"The work of this society," he contin
ued, "is of the highest Importance to the
community, and you have reason to fee l
satisfied and proud of the results of your
labors in the past. A number of those
who were saved by your untiring energy
and zeal shared in the dangers and tri
umphs that have immortalized the name of
Admjral Dewey, while one of your wards
is now on the way to the Philippines in
the capacity of stenographer to General
Merritt. These are results of which we,
as lovers of our country, have reason to
be proud."
Father Crowley then spoke of his diffi
culty in meeting the many demands made
upon his depleted exchequer. The solicit
ors agreed to put forth their best efforts
In the patriotic work of maintaining the
Youths' Directory.
Rev E. 11. Younan's address was de
livered in the chapel of the institution,
which was packed with an attentive au
dience. The eloquent Paulist held the

sonal interest in helping to save the
homeless boys.
who was wounded in the stomach, com
manded a troop of scouts during the Pine
Ridge Indian campaign in South Dakota
in 1890-91, and with his troop was engaged
in the battle of Wounded Knee.
Captain George A. Dodd of the Third
Cavalry, who was wounded in the head,
has been in command of men for many
years and is a fine soldier. He gained
considerable fame by introducing and de
veloping fancy cavalry riding, known as
the Cossack style, in which the men of
his troop have for a long time been re
markable experts.
Captain Morgan of the Third Cavalry,
who was killed, was a dashing fighter.
He was severely wounded in the arm in
General Chaffee's fight with the Apaches
at Chevalon's Fork, Arizona, in 1883.
Captain Charles .Dodge o"T the Twenty
fourth Infantry, reported as among the
killed, was the inventor of the blanket
roll yoke, which keeps the rolled blankets
off the chest and back.
Lieutenant Colonel Patterson of the
Twenty-second Infantry, wounded in the
groin, was the lieutenant colonel of the
First Infantry while at the Presidio.
Colonel Wyckoff of the Twenty-second,
reported killed, served throughout the
Civil War, and at the battle of Shiloh one
of his eyes was shot out. He was wound
ed several times in other battles. He was
one of the bravest and most gallant sol
diers in the army. Wyckoff was formerly
major of the Fourteenth Infantry, and
was last stationed at Vancouver barracks,
Washington.
Major Corliss, Captain Jackson, Lieu
tenant Besaro, all reported killed, and
Lieutenant Charles E. Field, fatally shot
in the hpad, belonged to the Seventh In
fantry and were well known by Lieuten
ant Bennett, aid-dc-camp to General
Merriam. The Seventh is Lieutenant Ben
nett's regiment. Captain Jackson was
a West Point classmate of Colonel Barry,
adjutant on the staff of Major General
Otis.
Lieutenants Conkling and Farr, of the
First Artillery, who are among the
wounded, are highly spoken of by those
of the officers in San Francisco who knew
them.
The Presidio officers, who were consider
ably "in the dumps" yesterday afternoon
over the news from Santiago, were
greatly elated last evening upon hearing
of the destruction of Cervera's fleet by
Sampson and the rapidly approaching fall
of the Spanish stronghold.
MET HER SOLDIER LOVE.
A Long Pilgrimage Ends in
the Rounding Out of a
Pretty Romance.
A portion of one of the prettiest ro
mances of the present war has been en
acted in this city during the past fort
night. Let Colonel Anderson, a gruff but
kindly old veteran of the Civil War, tell
the story as it developed under his eyes:
"While on my way to this coast several
days ago," he said, "my atention was at
tracted by a young woman who was trav
eling unattended. She was blessed with
more than ordinary good looks, was tal-
ented and a brilliant conversationalist.
She soon became a favorite with the other
passengers, who were deeply interested
in her mission to the Pacific Coast. This
was to find her brother, a comparative in
valid, according to her story, who had en
listed in the Montana regiment. As we
drew near our destination she was fairly
bubbling over with good nature in antici
pation of the meeting that was in store
for her. She was a stranger here, and I
volunteered to escort her to the camp up
on our arrival. We lost no time after reg
istering at a downtown hotel, but made
our way at once to the Richmond Camp.
"Upon arriving there I was surprised to
hear her inquire for Mr. Ferguson, as she
had given her name as Miss Holliday. I
dismissed the matter from my mind,
thinking that such a difference was
caused by a second marriage of one of the
parents.
"We did not find her brother that morn
ing, but she said she would visit the camp
again during the afternoon. I lost sight of
her for some days, as I was busy with
matters of business. One day I was stand
ing on Market street watching some
troops go by. I felt a pressure on my
arm, and turning around was greeted by
my traveling companion. With her was a
stalwart soldier. After the exchange of
greetings she introduced her escort as
'My husband, Mr. Ferguson !' I could
not conceal my surprise, but divined at
once the reason for her hasty trip to this
coast.
"Some days later I learned of the Inci
dents that led up to the affair. The young
couple were natives of lowa. They were
betrothed, but he met with business re
verses and went West to repair his dam
aged fortunes. When the war broke out
he offered his services to his country and
the fortunes of war sent him still further
westward.
"Colncidently with the breaking out of
the war Miss Holliday was left an inde
pendent fortune through the death of a
relative. She knew of a slight affection
of the throat from which her lover suf
fered, and her womanly Instinct told her
that the surgeons would not pass him.
This proved true, and she arrived just at
the time of his discharge, whereupon they
were married. They are now touring the
Yosrmite. as happy a couple as there is in
all the West."
Volunteer Engineers.
Two companies of the Second Regiment
of Volunteer Engineers went into camp
yesterday on the Presidio plain north of
Camp Miller. One company is from Colo
rado, under Captain Draper, which ar
rived Saturday night, and the other is a
California company, under Captain Wrek
HIS SHOE BETRAYED HIM.
A Saloon Burglar Returns for His
Missing Property and Is Cap
tured.
The saloon of Richard Madden at Fran
cisco and Mason streets was entered by
burglars early yesterday morning and the
supposed robber was captured when he
returned to the place to find a shoe he
had left In the yard back of the saloon.
Madden had been to an opening of a
rival saloon In the vicinity of his place,
and as the party did not break up till
morning he decided that he would not go
to bed but would open his place for busi
ness. When he came to the front door he
found the glass broken and entering the
place discovered the back door open. Offi
cer Irvine was called in, and in the rear
of the saloon he and Madden found a
shoe. While they were examining the bit
of evidence William Thompson, a nine
teen-year-old boy living near by, made his
appearance with but onÂ« shoe, and
claimed the one the officer held as his.
The policeman took him in charge and

THE MIDSUMMER LULL.
T~~} USINESS fell off somewhat last week, and the
r^\ gain over last year, as represented by the bank
* â clearings, was only 9.1 per cent, whereas of late
it has been running from 20 per cent to 30 per cent.
Various causes contributed to this falling off. In the
first place, tins is the season for the semi-annual
closing down of many industrial concerns, notably
iron, steel and glass, and for the regular midsummer
stock-taking. However, the shutdown will be briefer
thaÂ« usual this year, and in some sections will not
occur at all. Still it has its effect on the volume of
trade all the same. No noteworthy fluctuations in the
leading staples are observable, and the general mar
kets exhibit the usual midsummer inactivity.
The record of failures for the first half of 1898 makes
a favorable showing, the number being 0429, or 8
per cent iess than for the same time in 1897, and 15
per cent less than in 1890. The liabilities, too, were
smaller, being $7.2.120,000, or 23 per cent less than
last year and 31 per cent less than two years ago.
The exports of wheat continue extraordinary, those
for last week being over 4,000.000 bushels from At
lantic ports, against 2,004,000 last year. Thus far this
year these exports of wheat, including flour, amount
to 217.872.000 bushels, and of corn 211.452,000 bushels.
Prices for general products have shown more or less
weakness, notably in cereals, pork, lard and cotton,
while the number of advances is small. However,
prices for wool, hides, leather, groceries, print cloths
and metals, except iron, are reported steady, and the
cotton trade reports a general looking up.. The de
mand for fireworks and flags, which is purely a
transient condition, is better than for years, owing,
of course, to the spirit of patriotism awakened by the
war.
Wall street continues quiet. Speculation is narrow
and professional, and though the general public are
not buying, they are not selling. The course of
shares has hinged on the progress of events at San
tiago and Manila, and as both of these propositions
have been more or less uncertain, prices have been
unsettled. The grotesque marine parade of Admiral
Camara in the Mediterranean, and his moth-like flut
tering about the northern entrance to the Suez Canal,
were used as levers to depress quotations by the bears,
but with indifferent result, as Camara. with his an
tiquated and patchwork ships, is of no interest to
'Americans, except as a sort of naval curiosity. Still,
rverything goes in Wall street.
The local situation was distinguished last week by
;the hot north wind, which swept the State from one
end to the other. California is almost exclusively a
producing State, and is therefore peculiarly sensitive
to weather conditions. This wind has changed con
ditions materially, but they will not be wholly mani
fest for a week yet. In the first place, it caused a
rise in barky from $1 13^4 to $1 22 z / 2 by shelling out
.the grain in. those late districts in the Sacramento
â River which still remain uncut. In the second place
j:he hay farmers estimate that by unduly drying out the
hay it decreased the tonnage of the crop at least 25
per cent. This may or may not prove correct, but it
i-.ertainly did hay no good, and the product will have
. sere appearance the rest of the year in consequence.
The.pear districts report more or less loss through the
(lowing off .of the fruit. South of the bay the wind
lried the soil -so in the orchards that it is feared
>runes will suffer, both in size and volume of output.
n short, it caused more or. less mischief everywhere.
t is difficult to say which is the more disastrous, a
lot north wind or a hard frost, and we have had both
his year.: â¢" '.
As- :f.ar-.2ts prices for farm products are concerned
he oii.tlbok is bright. The tendency, is upward all
ilong-the.ii'ne. Fresh. fruit is- bringing good returns,
md the trade look for a fine market for the dried
)rod"uc!t '.owing to the light yield and the brisk inquiry
or.trie-'-Eas't.-' The establishment of 8!/?oc per pound
is the ..quotations for new apricots is a har
>inger bf=how prices for other kinds will run. Hay
â¢ules 'firm : ' and" no decline is expected, in the near fu
â¢ture.Vat least. At the close of the week all cereals
showed.arj advancing tendency. The livestock mar
ket likewise moved up somewhat and closed stiff.
' Trade in provisions bids fair to continue lively at the
k satisfactory quotations.. Wool is still quiet, but the
Is firm. ' Some, damage to the hop cron by
the hot Wind is feared, as the plant is now in bloom
and desiccation is apprehended. A few contracts have
jeen draw.n at i2 T < cents,per pound, which is a profit
able .figure. .Prospects for a large grape and raisin
.'crop. are good..- Ht>nce it will be seen that even-thing
that the .farmer- raises promises to yield him lucrative
retiirns. "This- being the case, it is hard to figure out
anything- else than a" jrood year for the State.
From such â¢ knowledge of Admiral Dewey's char
acter as has been gleaned since he sailed into Manila
Bay "there is every reason to suppose that the German
admiral -over there will either behave himself or ac
quire, disagreeable ex-perience faster than it ordinarily
rorrues even to ameddler.
For a nati.on .whose intentions are friendly, and
which has no idea of interfering, Germany is sending
i surprising number of warships to Manila.

NEWS OF VICTORY.
]") ULLETINS announcing the destruction of the
fj Spanish fleet at Santiago displayed by The Call
yesterday afternoon and evening filled the city
with rejoicing and fitly prepared the people for the
celebration of the national festival to-day. Thousands
of eager readers gathered about the bulletin boards,
and by their cheering evinced the joy they felt in the
new triumph of our arms, and when later in the even
ing the news of the arrival of the transports with
troops at Manila was announced, popular exultation
knew no bounds.
The destruction of the fleet at Santiago v in many
respects a more important event than will be the cap
ture of the city itself, which must soon follow, even if
it does not occur to-day. It was, in fact, to assure the
destruction of the fleet that the city was Invested. Of
the three fleets that bore the Spanish flag upon the
seas, two are now destroyed and the thiru can escape
the fate of the others only by surrender to the first
American squadron that meets it, or by the applica
tion of the Spanish Government for peace on any
terms the United States may dictate.
Such glorious news would stir the people with en
thusiasm at any time, but coming as it did on the eve
of the Fourth of July, it will animate the nation with
an ardor almost beyond precedent. Victory and the
Fourth are two events that harmonize well. Their
influences accord like notes that blend into perfect
music. Their inspirations join to form a concord of
jubilant exultation that will be felt as a thrill in every
home and patriot heart throughout the length and
breadth of the Republic.
For the heroes who have fallen a willing sacrifice
to purchase for the nation the victories around San
tiago, and to whose devoted valor and patriotism we
owe this triumph, there will be every honor that the
living can give the dead. In the glory of the day they
will not be forgotten. To them, under God, is due
the credit for the success which gladdens the nation,
and in that gladness there will not be lacking a peo
ple's pride in their deed and mourning for their loss.
In their heroism we exult as we cheer the star
spangled banner, and rejoice that the foe has been
beaten, that Manila and Santiago are ours.
RESTORED.
AN esteemed political prophet of this journal, in
the course of an article published Friday,
declares that a bargain has been struck between
Dr. Pardee of Oakland, Republican candidate for
Governor, and the Third Street Boodler (late of Mis
sion street), whereby the latter is to give its support
to the former in the coming campaign. Our es
teemed prophet does not believe that on its part the
latter is sincere. He hints strongly that the Boodlerâ
which does its boodling under Democratic auspices
is supporting Pardee for Governor because it regards
him as a weak candidate, who, if nominated, will elect
Judge Maguire.
This is a plausible theory, but it is lacking in prob
ability. The Boodler is too cunning to use its in
fluence in carrying out any such scheme. In the first
place, like all boodlers, it entertains an exalted no
tion of its power, and if it were shrewd enough to
support Pardee for the purpose of electing Maguire
it would always be haunted with a notion that pos
sibly it might succeed in making the former Gov
ernor, in which event it would defeat itself. Out
siders may think the Boodler capable of playing this
game, but no person who understands the nature of
its opinion of itself will for a moment entertain the
idea.
With all due respect to our esteemed political
prophet, therefore, we beg to scout his theory, and
in place of it substitute another more probable and
equally as plausible. The Boodler is supporting Dr.
Pardee for Governor. There is no doubt about that.
Dr. Pardee is the Southern Pacific candidate. That is
also certain; our political prophet establishes his
connection with the monopoly by unmistakable evi
dence. How is it possible, then, for the inevitable
conclusion to be avoided? The Booaier has been re
stored to the Southern Pacific payroll.
The only question which remains concerns the
amount of the Boodler's new contract. Formerly it
received $1000 a month, and it had a written contract
whereby the subsidy was to continue for thirty
months â a period covering two Legislatures and a
State campaign. As a matter of fact, the payments
did continue for twenty-two months, at the end of
which time the Boodler broke its silence on railroad
topics, and the monopoly, considering its contract at
an end, refused to longer put up.
What is the amount of the contract this time? Has
the figure been increased or reduced? Is the present
contract to cover the Legislature of 1899, or has the
Boodler simply been employed to support Dr. Par
dee? These are questions the people desire answered,
as there is not the slightest doubt that arrangements
have been perfected whereby the Boodler has again
agreed to aid the Southern Pacific to capture the
State.
Even if it were not plain that the Boodler has taken
a contract to nominate a railroad candidate for Gov
ernor in the Republican convention â the choice of
which is certain to be elected this year â sufficient evi
dence might be adduced to prove that it had been re
stored to the payroll. It has kept very quiet on rail
road matters lately. All its various cinches have died
out. The marked attention it is paying to war mat
ters and the able manner in which it is daily discussing
European politics would be suspicious under any cir
cumstances, but they are doubly suspicious at this
juncture. We are unqualifiedly of the opinion that the
Boodler has a new contract.
The Examiner used the early hours of the calm
Sabbath morning in stealing an interesting cablegram
from The Call. The theft was committed in great
haste, for the larcenist omitted several essential de
tails and forgot to place the line "Copyrighted by W.
R. Hearst" at the top of the stolen article. The
cablegram contained an account of the sinking of a
gunboat, a sloop and a pontoon by Sampson.
It is worthy of note that at the time Sampson's
fleet maneuvered at the mouth of Santiago Bay a
Whitehall regatta held its peaceful course in San
Francisco harbor.
It is not easy to understand how matters could have
gone wrong in Cuba with Correspondent Hearst right
on the spot. Can it be possible he was not consulted?
Any pleasing little theories that the Spanish would
lay down their arms at sight of American troops far
less than themselves in number have been revised.
Military critics who never smelled powder will please
bear in mind that to tell a general what he ought to
have done is merely a display of cheek.
It was the Oregon, our California battleship, that
struck down the Spanish flag from the Morro at San
tiago. The ten strike of the day was ours.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JULY 4 1898.
THE GLORIOUS FOURTH-
rAR and wide over the globe, in every spot
where any number of Americans are gathered,
the star-spangled banner will be unfurled to-day,
and there will be shouts and songs of patriotic pride
and feelings of love and loyalty so deep they will
move to prayers and tears. From Dewey's conquer
ing rleet in Manila Bay, from transport ships in mid
ocean, from the victorious army around Santiago,
from American residents in the great capitals of the
Old World, from the far off islands of the sea, the
swelling notes of bands and the voices of men and
women singing will send forth upon every breeze
under the whole heavens the triumphant strains of
the national anthems of the republic
Strong and free will be the sounds of patriotic re
joicing that will come to us from far off, but stronger
and louder will be the mighty chorus that rolls up
from the soil of the republic itself, when throughout
all the States the people assemble to honor the day
by every form of memorial observance known to man.
Never before has the United States seen a festival like
that which this morning summons every citizen to
adorn his home with banners and give free utterance
to the enthusiasm of loyalty, and never before has
that summons been so universally heeded or obeyed
with such intensity of ardor.
Far removed from the comparative indifference of
former years will be the feeling with which we will
celebrate this anniversary of the declaration of our
national independence. The memories of the Revo
lution that made us a nation, of the war of 1812 that
established the rights of our seamen and our flag
upon the seas, of the Mexican War that widened the
original boundaries of the Union and made it an
ocean girt republic, and of the Civil War that freed
the slave and kept the Union whole, will be brightened
and freshened in our hearts by the war that now
rages, and we shall draw from out the past a deeper
inspiration of patriotism than has been our custom in
times of peace.
Deep in their foundations and lofty in their heights
will be the sentiments stirred within us by the recol
lections of the past glories of the nation, but deeper
yet and still more lofty will be the feelings born of
the present emergency, the offspring of the conflict
we are now waging not for ourselves alone, but for
an oppressed people, that liberty may be established
and justice done in all parts of this hemisphere. Our
thoughts to-day will be with the conquerors at Manila
and with the victorious battalions that are battling
around the entrenchments at Santiago. Indeed at
this juncture we need borrow nothing from the past,
rich as it is in noble inspirations to patriotism. The
living present is in itself sufficiently vital with pa
trotic impulses to thrill every heart with an exultant
and devoted loyalty.
From our orators we have reason to expect to-day
a genuine eloquence. The theme is great, the occa-
sion momentous and the audiences will be every
where responsive and inspiring. A mighty people,
recognizing the grandeur of the manifest destiny of
their nation, has made with itself a resolve to be equal
to that destiny and strong to bear every burden it im
poses. The wealth required for the struggle, the lives
demanded in payment of victory, are given freely, not
from recklessness, but from an abiding faith that they
are expended in the service of the country and of God
and will secure a thousand blessings for the land and
for humanity.
BY reports of the destructive forest fires in the
vicinity of Michigan Bar the people of Cali
fornia are once more reminded of a danger that
in many parts of the State it continually imminent
during the dry season. Every year there are a con
siderable number of fires in our forests and the an
nual loss is in the aggregate one of great proportions.
It is therefore important that all persons who are in
the habit of resorting to the forests or fields for any
purpose should be very careiul of fire at all times and
under all circumstances.
It is never easy to trace the origin of a fire in the
woods or in the fields. A cigar stump carelessly,
thrown away by a casual passer along the road, a fire
started by a camper and left burning after he had
gone, a match dropped in a meadow and started into
flame by the hoof of cattle â any one of these things
is sufficient under certain conditions to begin a blaze
that in the dry season will sweep miles of country be
fore it is checked, and the cause of the conflagration
would never be discovered.
Nor is it easy to estimate the damage done by such
fires. The loss of grass or grain in a field may in
deed be computed with reasonable correctness, but
the amount of the loss occasioned by an extensive
fire in a forest is almost incalculable. Our woods are
of great value in many ways. Their destruction en
tails the loss not only of the merchantable timber
standing in the area swept by the fire, but a multitude
of young trees not yet of commercial use, but which
it will require years of growth to replace.
So great is the loss to the commonwealth by these
annual summer ffres that competent experts agree it
would be an economy for the State to maintain a
forest police to watch our woods during the dry sea
son. In the end it may be found necessary to provide
such a police, since there is no way to make forest
laws and regulations enforce themselves, and so many
people are seemingly careless whether the woods burn
or not.
Something of a combined and resolute effort will
certainly have to be undertaken to protect the State
from the enormous losses of these ever recurring fires.
In some of the older States of the Union, such as
Pennsylvania, for example, that originally possessed
forests as valuable as our own, a neglect of proper
protection has left them so exposed to the ravages
of fire that they are now virtually destroyed, and the
State is the poorer by untold millions of dollars. We
should be able to profit by the warning of such ex
amples and not have to learn wisdom when too late
by undergoing the same experience.
German editors are charging us with presumption
because some papers have gone so far as to accuse
the Kaiser of insolence in attempting to dictate the
policy to be followed in the Philippines, where it is
none of his business. They should remember thai
in this country the divine right of kings is regarded
as a royal bluff, and the divine right of expressing
opinion something that cannot be taken away. If
any American papers have rebuked Germany they
can put forward the excellent excuse that Germany
needed it.
fn the report that the Spanish are using Red Cross
flags for protection there is nothing out of consonance
with the Spanish character as revealed since the open
ing of the war in Cuba.
Now it is a Pasadena man who has been found
far from home without the slightest idea how he got
there. Perhaps, however, this case Is novel. The
man may be sincere.
A San Leandro man who slapped his sweetheart
because, as he claimed, she had told him a falsehood,

social ethics.
FOREST FIRES.
A FEW THOUGHTS FOR JULY 4, 1898.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir: I differed from many citi
zens in seeing no logical reason for the present war, and I now believe that
the effete Spanish monarchy, with all its possessions, is not worth the good
red American blood that has been poured out at Santiago. But all this is
comparatively unimportant. The war is on, and whatever the cost in life or
in money our country must win and the honor of our flag be upheld. The
questions that may now be considered are those in which I agree with The
Call and recognize it as among the stanchest defenders of true American
ism in the United States. In fact, your splendid editorials, which I have
read for the past \ 'ek, are the immediate inspiration of this communication.
The tactics and methods of the sensational press, especially of certain
newspapers which profess to be Democratic, are plainly infamous, and in
this respect there is nothing to be added to your searching comments. But
I would like to supplement with a few paragraphs your powerful and ac
curate discussion of constitutional limitations and of revolutionary tenden
cies.
What Is the outcome of this war to be? The humiliation of Spain un
doubtedly, and possibly, in the event of combined interference by European
powers, a magnificent vindication of the strength, the intelligence, and the
physical and moral ascendency of the composite race which speaks our
language.
But after that, what? This is the question of questions on our na
tional birthday. Are American institutions to be permanently changed. Do
the new conditions of modern times demand a political revolution? Or is
the system of government devised by the fathers of the republic, as Inter
preted and conducted during the first century of its existence, the best
guaranty we possess for the spread and the durability of organized and edu
cated liberty?
These interrogations are variously answered. You have responded to
them rationally and strongly. In relation to them, my own opinions are so
fixed and my feelings so intense, that I read with horror of the tendencies
which you are seeking to counteract and which are manifested, at least on
th. surface, in every direction.
Our national flag has no connection with classes or with dynasties. It
is the converging point for humanity everywhere. It represents the possi
ble breadth and depth of fraternal patriotism. It means the Declaration of
Independence â the Constitution of the United States â Washington's Fare
well Address â the Monroe Doctrine defined â oar Civil War, with its results
of unclassified freedom, of law and order, of an ibroken Union of hearts
and hands.
But, in some parts of our Republic, and among men of influence and
standing, it is boldly asserted that we have outgrown the theories and the
practice of a hundred years and that the war in which we are engaged fur
nishes us with an opportunity or a pretext for abandoning our constitu
tional moorings, and launching into a dazzling career of conquest, which will
necessarily b-ing us into an alliance with Great Britain, not for the legiti
mate purpose of maintaining the fundamental rights of men, ' ut to extend
our dominion through the essential methods of imperialism.
It has been said that "war is hell," but these ideas and projects are
vorse. They are false in every detail. They involve among those who pro
mulgate them, consciously or unconsciously, treason to the flag, and trea
son to mankind. If the young men of the present day, with their high intel
lect, their nob 1 ' ambition, their sturdy manhood, were seduce by them,
they woul^ make a long stride toward the destruction of their country, the
obliteration of self-government, and the revival of Napoleonic despotism.
The obstinate attempt to annex Hawaii, anu the inflexible purpose an
nounced, not by the Government, but in Congress and in other quarters, to
annex the Philippine Islands, Porto Rico, the Canaries and other Spanish
possessions, with their barbarous or mongrel populations, are illustrations
of a deep-laiv. revolutionary design, which must be trodden under foot at
once, or we will follow the precedent of the Roman Republic with such un
erring certainty as almost literally to justify the universal application of
Solomon's aphorism, that there is "nothing new under the sun." Language,
race, deep-seated love of freedom and Independence, may retard, but they
cannot arrest or turn the stream of conquest, whtn it once fairly begins to
flow from the heart and brain of a great nation. Let any citizen read the
history of the decline and fall, not of the Empire, but of the Republic of
Rome, say in the pages of Duruy, and he will find whole chapters, which,
with very slight changes, could be published as a narrative of what is go
ing on to-day in our own midst.
The fact that we cannot annex Hawaii or administer the Philippines or
other Spanish possessions without breaking our constitutional compact,
abrogating the Monroe doctrine and violating our own precedents and prac
tice, has been demonstrated until the argument has become threadbare.
There is not a great lawyer, a great publicist, or a great American in any
profession who would even attempt by any sound or honest reasoning or
citations to dispute this proposition. And it ought to be superfluous to say
that the essence of treason is to defy the constitution.
But, independently of these conclusive points, what caused the destruc
tion of the Roman republic but foreign conquest, colonization, mercenary
armies and the internal corruption, individual, social and political, which
inevitably flowed from these causes? How can we expect to avoid identical
consequences if we drift into identical channels? If we annex Hawaii,
against the will of Its people, if we take the Philippines, we cannot develop
them into States, and, with their inferior populations, we must govern them
as dependencies. A policy of conquest, once adopted, never -*ops until Prov
idence breaks it up. With the schemes already developed we shall need the
second largest navy In the world and an army of 500,000 men. Who are to
compose that army? The forces we are now sending to the Philippine Islands
and to Cuba are mainly American young men, fresh from the American
schools, filled with the ardor of citizenship, and with the glow of intelligence
behind the fire of their rifles. These men have left their various pursuits
in life, their relatives, their families, their useful functions in civilized Amer
ican society not for the pay, which Is a poor substitute for what they have
sacrificed, but for patriotism. They saw that Spain had to be thrashed, after
hostilities were once declared, and they have deliberately accepted their share
of the danger and of the glory. These men will not remain in a standing
army, itself a menace to liberty, but they will do their work and go back to
their homes and to industry. The standing army of the United States, like
the standing army of the Roman republic, will be composed of mercenaries,
incapable of citizenship, and in this, as in every other particular, if treason
able counsels should prevail, the deadly parallel of history will be completed.
This is by no means all I could say, but it is all I will say now, and it is
the contribution of one humble citizen to the literature of our national
holiday in 1898. PUBLICOLA.
THE FOURTH IN
THE INTERIOR
THE Fourth of July observances of
the year IS9B in the towns, cities
and hamlets of California will be
long remembered. The war with
Spain has fanned patriotism into
a blaze, and from one end of Cali
fornia to the other national salutes, fer
vid oratory, parades, pyrotechnics and
national songs will illustrate this fact.

communities near at hand have published
their programmes in the local papers.

The following significant bit Is from the
Los Angeles Herald:
"British-born Americans" will turn out
In force on the Fourth of July, and they
promise to provide an interesting and
characteristic feature of the parade. It is
a noteworthy fact that at the meeting
yesterday which took steps to organize
the affair the feeling was predominant
that this British feature of the parade
must be primarily American. However
much love and admfrntion British-born
citizens of the United States feel for the
land and the flag of their birth, the fealty
they Âaye sworn to Old Glory will always
overrule. No one will deny his father
land; still less can the true man be dis
loyal to the land of his adoption. Ameri
cans of British birth are entitled to every
duty and privilege of this free land. Th^ir
demonstraton on our national holiday will
be of peculiar significance when they
march beneath the star spangled banner
and the union jack.
NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
Rearmament and refits of the older
British armored ships are progressing 1 . The
Alexandra. 9490 tons, built }n 1877. has been
fitted with six 4.7-inch quick-firers in place
of the old six 4-inoh battery, but the main
battery of eight 10-inch and two 9.2-inch
muzzle and breech loaders still remains,
owing to lack of modern puns. The ship
has also been fitted with four-bladed pro
pellers in place of the three-bladed,
â¢which wore unsuited for the unusual full
lines of the hull.
The Niobe, one of the e!ght new 11.000
tons protected cruisers building for the
British navy, has passed through some of
her steam trials. Under one-fifth power
she developed 3341 horsepower during thir
ty hours and 12 knots speed, using 1.77
pounds of coal per horsepower per hour.
"With full power 16.834 horsepower were de
veloped during eight hours and a speed of
20.5 knots with a coal consumption of only
1.66 pounds. The contract required was
16,500 horsepower and 20.5 knots speed.
Commander Herman Gercke of the Ger
man navy has an elaborate article with
numerous Illustrations In the Marine
Rundschau on the disaster to the Maine.
He proves to his own satisfaction at lrast
that the explosion was not caused by a
mine or any other outside agency, but
that the forward magazine of the Maine
caused the catastrophe. He claims that
there was an accumulation of gases from
the powder and explosives, the properties
and dangers were not understood by the
officers on the ship and that these gases
caused the forward magazines to explode.
Similar conclusions have been reached by
"naval experts" in France, Spain and
Austria, tending to show that the articles
have been Inspired by the Governments of
those countries. On the other hand in
countries friendly to the United States
there has been no attempt to disprove the
conclusions reached by our naval board
that the Maine was destroyed by agencies
outside the ship.
The failure of the Terrible to maintain
a more than ordinary speed, owing to de
fects In her engines, is being investigated,
by a board appointed by the British ad
miralty. Lord Beresford has promised a
thorough examination and that the public
will be made acquainted with the facts.
He is not ready to lay the blame on the
contractors, J. & G. Thompson. Clyde
bank, but is of the opinion that the high
pressure of steam, which is 230 pounds,
may have something to do with the inabil
ity of the engines to work where 180
pounds has hitherto proved no obstacle.
It is the first time, it Is claimed, that en
gines of such great horsepower have been
built and that it may be found that the
limit of safety has been exceeded. Other
ships with 21.000 horsepower, such as the
Minneapolis, have three engines, whereas
in the Terrible and Powerful the two en
gines are worked up to 14,000 horsepower
each, or just double that in American,
French and German ships.
Great Britain has acquired from China
an extension of territory around Hong
kong of 1247 square miles. The original ;
treaty of 1543 gave England only about 29
square miles, but the acquisitions of Ger
many and Russia by leases from China
necessitated a like course on the part of
Great .Britain and by a treaty of June 9
this year a lease of 99 years was given
covering the waters of Mirs Bay, Deep
Bay, the peninsula and promontory of
Kau-lung and island of Lan-tao. The ter
ritory extends about 43 miles east and
west and 29 miles north and south. Dur
ing the year past active preparations have
been in progress to extend the fortifica- â¢.
tions and improve the dockyard facilities
of Hongkong, for which several million
dohars were appropriated, and another
foreign stronghold in the Chinese empire
to outrival those at Port Arthur and Kiau
Bay will be completed within a few years.
The British torpedo-boat destroyer
Dasher of 220 tons, built in 1886, has had
her Thorneycroft locomotive boilers taken
out and water-tube boilers substituted.
"With the latter she developed last month
during a three hours' trial an' average of
3888 horsepower and a speed of 27 knots,
while with the old boilers th,e horsepower
was only 3152 and the speed 2(3.21 knots.

AN EASY VICTORY.
San Jose Had No Trouble in
Winning From the Fresno
Team.
FRESNO, July 3.â The ball game to-day
between Fresno and San Jose resulted in
easy victory for the latter, the -score be
ing 11 to 2. The game was not character
ized by any brilliant playing by either
side, the principal feature being the man
ner in which the visitors found Tawney,
who pitched for Fresno. He was almost
hammered out of the box by the sturdy
stickers from Garden City. Eighteen hits
were made off his delivery. The homo
team placed Arick, who occupied the box
f'>r San Jose, safely seven times, but the
hits were too scattered to be effective.
In the first Inning Eagan for San Jose
lined out a three-bagger, scoring three
men. The official score of the game is as

pitching, coupled with the perfect sup
port he received, was too much for the
San Franciscos to digest to-day. The vis
itors had a rather patched-up team and
played with little life. Krug started in
to pitch, but owing to his wildness gave
way to Shea, who held the locals down
quite well. The score was:

THE SAIN" FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JULY 4, 1898.
STIFF BREEZE FOR THE WHITEHALLS
The Little Racing Craft Rounded the Blossom Rock Buoy in
Bunch and Started an Exciting Run fop Home.
There was ah exciting Whitehall boat race in the lower bay yesterday afternoon. The regatta was a part of the
Fourth of July celebration and the shore of the bay was lined with spectators, while the racing boats were followed
by a fleet of tugs and launches. The entries were: Robert J. Tobin, Maurice Behan captain; Stewart Menzies, D.
Crowley Sr. captain; Ella, John Engels captain; Golden Shore. James Sinnott captain; General Shatter, Minor Mul
laney captain; Colonel Dan Burns, William Clarke captain; Arthur McCracken, Thomas Crowley captain; Chief Lees,
Thomas Lyons captain; H. T. Emery, M. J. Fitzgerald captain.
The course was as follows: Starting from Powell-street wharf to and around Blossom Rock buoy, leaving It on
the port side: thence to and around a stakeboat anchored 300 yards west of Powell-street wharf, leaving tire same on
the starboard hand; thence to and around a stakeboat anchored off Fort Point wharf, leaving the same on
port hand; thence to Powell-street wharf, finishing across a line drawn between the stakeboat and Powell-street
wharf.
Thomas Lyons' Chief Lees was the first to round Blossom Rock buoy, soon after rounding which the mast of
William Clarke's Colonel Dan Burns became unstepped, causing some delay to that boat. After rounding the stake
boat to the west of Powell-street wharf it was a hard beat to windward against a stiff westerly breeze out to the
Fort Point stakeboat. Maurice Behan's Robert J. Tobln and Thomas Crowley's Arthur McCracken raced nip and
tuck till the stakeboat was reached. The Arthur McCracken neatly rounded it, and set her spinnaker for the run
home; the Robert J. Tobin was not up quite enough to windward and fouled the buoy. By the time she got clear the
Arthur McCracken had obtained a lead that rendered it impossible to catch her. But, though Thomas Crowley'a boat
ran home an easy winner, she neglected to cross the finishing line between Powell-street wharf and the stakeboat,
crossing to the north of the stakeboat, and was disqualified. This seemed to leave the first prize to Maurice Behan's
boat, but as she fouled the Fort Point stakeboat first money may after all be awarded to James Sinnott's Golden
Shore, which came in a good third. The committee will confer with the judge at the stakeboat before deciding the
awards. It seems, however, certain that Thomas Crowley must have misunderstood the course, for he had so long a
lead that he might easily have put about, beaten out to windward for some distance and run home between the
wharf and the stakeboat a winner.
A. Beyer's Captain Staples was Judges' tender. There wan a brisk but steady breeze, and enough sea to test the
weatherly qualities of the little boats, which were well handled and presented a pretty picture as they ran before the
wind with mainsheets free and spinnakers set.

CAUSE OF DEATE IN DOUBT.
Cornelius Cronin May Have Died
From Heart Trouble or a
Broken Neck.
Cornelius Cronin died at his home at
705 Tehama street last evening under cir
cumstances which leave a doubt as to
wheiher death was due to natural causes
or a fall resulting in his neck being
broken.
Cronin had lunch with his family late
in the afternoon, and, after rising from
the table, went to the back porch, where
he stood for a few moments. A noise of
something falling brought his wife to the
OnuT and she found her husband lying on
the ground in .in unconscious condition.
Examination proved that he was dead,
and the Coroner's office was notified. At
the earnest request of Mrs. Cronin the
body was not taken to the Morgue, but
to an undertaking establishment, where
an autopsy will be held.
Deputy Coroner Haliett believes that
Cronin was attacked with heart failure,
which caused him to fall down the steps,
but Mr. Haliett says there is a chance
that he may have slipped and in falling
broke his neck.
YACHTS AT VALLEJO.
Fewer Boats Than Usual Attend the
Interclub Cruise.
The third annual cruise of the Pacific
Inter-club Yacht Association was held on
July 2 and 3. Owing to the fact that the
Corinthians had a cruise to Martinez in
thoir programme for the 2d, there were
by no mean? so many yachts at anchor
at Vallejo as last year. The breeze on the
night of the 2d from Sausalito and Tib
urun up to Red Rock was somewhat
fHiky, but from that point on was steady.
The following yachts left Sausalito on
Saturday evening: Commodore Dr. T. L.
Hill's sloop CygnUÃ, having on board Dr.
and Mrs. T. L. Hill. Mrs. C. B. Hill.
Messrs. E. C. Bartl^tt, C. Rieveley and
Arthur Inkersley; Vice Commodore G. T.
S. White's sloop Will o' the Wisp. Arthur
D. Naylor's sloop Twilight, A. Suther
land's sloop Catherine and E. New-hall's
schooner Virginia. Yesterday morning, in
addition to most of those, there lay at
anchor at Vallelo Fred King's sloop Lois,
the yawl Frolic. R. R. 1 Hommedieu's
s!<">p Phoenicia and the Encinal yacht
Fawn. It was expected that several Cali
fornia yachts would join the rendezvous
and that the number would be largely in
creased by the addition of the Corinthian
fleet on its return from Montezuma
Slough.
NEW REVENUE AGENTS.
L. A. Thrasher Ordered to Washmg-

Revenue Agent L. A. Thrasher hns re
ceived orders from Commissioner N. B.
Scott, relieving him from duty on the
coast siid instructing him to report to
Washington, D. C.
The order transferring Agent Thrasher
also assigns Burt M. Thomas, the newly
appointed agent, to duty here in his home
division. Mr. Thomas will take charge
of the office to-day, but Mr. Thrasher will
remain here until the current business of
the oflice is finished. This will take until
about the last of the month, when he
will report at Washington, from where
he will be assigned to duty probably in
the division including North and South
Carolina.
Sunday-School Exercises.
A series of pleasant Sunday afternoons,
patriotic in their nature, was inaugurated
by the members of the Central Methodist
Episcopal Sunday School yesterday. Spe
cial exercises, consisting of vocal and in
strumental solos, recitations and address
es, were presented. Professor H. M. Bos

"FOR FREEDOM"
IS INVINCIBLE
The English Dog Lands
Another Stake.
FALSE FLATTERER DOWNED
SKYBALL TRAVELS A LONG AND
FATIGUING COURSE.
Union Park Furnishes Some Bare
Sport â Ingleside Crowded With
Followers of the Pastime,
The Record.
For Freedom, the speedy importation
from England, still upholds the reputa
tion he has earned since his advent to
this coast. Yesterday at Union Park he
went past his rivals as if they were stand
ing still and won the open staJte in his
usual style. Whenever J. H. Rossiter, the
fortunate possessor of the great dog, en
ters him for a stake it seems a foregone
conclusion that he will carry it off, and
the talent is chary about laying their
shekels on any other candidate. At times
the shortenders are fascinated by the odds
of 20 to 1, as was offered yesterday, and
bet in the hope of seeing the invincible
dog meet his Waterloo. It is vain hope,
however, as For Freedom once looseiu i a
from the slips, bounds after the prey with
lightning syeed, leaving his rival far in
the rear. This was the rule yesterday.
Such speedy performers as Mira Monte
and Minneapolis wero made to look like
has bceiis. Although the Eastern produc
tion made a fair showing against the
wonder in the final after the hist turn,
For Freedom's speed asserted itself and
he earned the flag. His owner was offered
$UuOO for him by a Mr. Edmondson, a lover
of the sport, but Mr. Rossiler refused tho
tempting offer, saying that the dog was
not for sale.
Nothing of a sensational nature was
sprung yesterday. The talent took a few
falls during the running, but retrieved
themselves on tho winnings of the favor
ites. The Gossoon, lilacktun, Camilla ana
Terrona contributed to tho joy of the
shortenders by landing flags. The Gos
soon defeated the 2>/2 to 1 lavorite Doug
las; Blackton won fron .Lady Blanche
at 3 to 1, and Camilla keeled over the
slight favorite, Tea Rose. The defeat of
False Flatterer by Terrona, at 4 to 1, was
the saddest blow of all. The talent was
ho confident that the former would win
that they banked heavily on her, and
much disappointment was displayed when
Terrona was declared the winner.
Hot Stuff' 3 second day's appearance was
signalized by his defeating Glenstone anc?
Terrona. Vanity Fair and the former ran
a no course, after which the latest as
pirant for honors was defeated in a close
course.
Old Skyball displayed grit and staying
powers by landing a tricky hare after a
course similar to that which laid Black
ette out a few weeks ago.
A great many hard losers railed at
Judge Bull for not deciding in favor ol
their choice, Rosette, in her course with
Firm Friend. The decision, in the minds
of non-bettor?, was a fair one. as Flrn.
Friend did the most work at the finish.
The course was a good one and was keen
ly watched.
Firm Friend's hnrd courses in the byes
played havoc with him. and when he ap
peared against Minneapolis proved an
easy rival.
Following is the way the stake was
run:

PATRIOTISM HIS THEME.
Dr. J. A. B. Wilson Addresses Some
Timely Remarks to Members
of the Boys' Brig-ade.
Dr. John A. B. Wilson, pastor of the
Howard-Street Methodist Church, deliv
ered a stirring- sermon on "Patriotism"
before a large and attentive congregation
last evening composed in part of the
young people who compose the Boys'
Brigade. He based his remarks on Prov
erbs, xiv:34: "Righteousness exalteth a
nation, but sin is a reproach to any peo
ple." In part he said:
"The implication is that the exaltation
of a nation is desirable, but that
moral evil prevents while righteousness
promotes it. Love means the desire and
effort to uplift the object loved. War and
courage in battle is one way but by no
m< iin.s the only way of promoting the in
terests of our country."
The speaker then called attention to
Dt-wey and Hobson as being believers in
Christ and of their bravery in times of
peril. He outlined Hobson's character and
pointed him out to his young listeners as
the ideal soldier and Christian. In clos
ing he said:
"Young men, do not force the opportun
ity of doing great things. Get ready for
the move by discipline and devotion to
the unromantic duties of your station,
and if the hour never comes you will
have increased the average of national
righteousness by the quality of your own
personality, and If the hour comes It will
find you ready."

AGGIE BEATS
THE LURLINE
Unsatisfactory Race of
the Yachts.
HEAVY FOG AND NO WIND
THE CONTEST LITTLE MORE
THAN A DRIFT.
Occupants of the Two Vessels Boy
ally Entertained on Their Ar
rival at Santa
Cruz.
6p*clal Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA CRUZ, July 3.- Shortly after
11 o'clock this morning the yacht Aggie
hove In sight, winning the race of the
Pacific Yacht Club. She was followed a
few minutes later by the Lurllne.
The cruise w.- s a most uns isfactory
one. The yachts started from San
Francisco yesterday morning. The tug
Alert to 1 the Lurline and the tug
Sea Witch toy ;d the Aggie to a mile
beyond the lighthouse boat. They cast
off and the race was commenced in
earnest. The yachts Immediately lost
sight of each other in the dense fog
which prevailed. The fog lasted for one
hour and when it lifted the Lurline was
two or three miles ahead of the Aggie.
Soon after another dense fog bank ap
peared, enveloping the yachts until 9:30
o'clock this morning. During the night
both yachts were becalmed and floun
dered at sea. Neither had any idea
where the other was, but both were
about nine miles from Santa Cruz, up
the coast opposite La Guna. The Aggie
had the advantage, being closer to the
shore.
There was very little wind and the
boats drifted down the coast, the Aggie
arriving at 11:28 this morning. If the
wind was good, it is conceded, the Lur
line would have won by about three
hours. The race really was a drift the
entire distance, except for about fifteen
miles.
The elegant prize offered by citizens
of Santa Cruz, a case of pearl-handled
knives, forks, spoons, etc., is now the
property of the Aggie.
The yachts vill leave for home on
Tuesday morning, remaining: in the
harbor here over the Fourth. On board
the Lurline are Hon. W. W. Foote,
Judge Fred Henshaw, J. W. Reid, Her
vey Fortman, A. B. Spreckels and W. S.
Leake. On the Aesrie are E. Wilke, W.
Northrup Cov.ies, W. T,. Holms and C.
A. Williams.
The yachtsmen were royally enter
tained at dinner to-night at the hospi
table home of J. P. Smith at Sunshine
Villa, on Beech Hill. A delightful
evening was spent.

NOTED THIEF
IS ARRESTED
He Robbed a Woman of-
Her Purse. .:
THROWS AWAY THE SPOILS
CLEVER CAPTTJBE OF A WELL
KNOWN PICKPOCKET.
John Comerford Buns a Great -vace, : .
but Succeeds in Landing in the
Tanks â A Desperate
Crook.
While visiting Sutro Heights yesterday
afternoon Mrs. Dunn of 3793 Seventeenth
street had her pocket picked of a pursa
containing $29 80. Suspecting a young â â¢.
man who stood near her, she informed
Police Officer George Douglass, who pro- '
ceeded to arrest the thief. 'â¢
The latter, evidently realizing that Mrs.-.
Dunn had suspected him, took to his â 
heels, followed by the officer. During the
chase he threw away the purse, which
was picked up by a citizen. After a run'
of several blocks Douglass succeeded in â¢
overhauling the thief. At the City Prison'
he gave hiÃ name as John Comerford and
was charged with grand larceny. His
companion, who gave his name as Charles
Coulter, was also arrested by Detectives
Egan and Gibson and charged with -va
grancy. "'â  "
Saturday night Gibson and Egan de
tected Comerford in the act of picking a
woman's pocket on Market street. They
started to arrest him, when he broke
away from them and ducked down Mar
ket street, pursued by the detectives. In
his flight he knocked down several
women. A soldier, hearing the cry of
"Stop thief!" attempted to stop him. but
In doing so tripped up Detective Gibson,
who was almost within arm's reach of
the thief. After regaining his feet Gib
son continued the pursuit, finally compel
ling Comerford to seek refuge In a build
ing on Market and Stockton streets. Gib^
son followed him. and as he was about to
place him under arrest Comerford jumped
through an open window to the ground
below, a distance of tweny-flve feet. For
tunately for him he was not injured.
Gibson immediately ran from the build
ing, expecting to see the pickpocket lying
in the street a fit subject for the hospital
doctors, as he expressed it. To his sur
prise, however, Comerford was not to be
found. While the detective was leaving
the building, as it was afterward learned,
the bold thief, after picking up his hat,
which he had dropped, ran along Stockten
street and made good his escape.

Charles Hopps, George Rnde and James
Crosbie found the body of an unknown
man in a cave just south of the Cliff

two months and was badly decomposed. It
was entirely naked, save a shoe on one foot

DESERTED BY A CRUEL MOTHER.
Harold Dickson, an Injured Babe, Reveals the
Heartlessness of a Worthless Parent.
Nrglceted and deserted by his mother, Harold Dickson, a manly little fel
low two years old. wandered into the street in front of his home, at 525 J 4
Howard street, yesterday evening, and was run over by a passing milk
wagon. The baby was taken to the Harbcr Receiving Hospital and an abra
sion of the right leg was treated by Dr. Deas.
The injury to the boy was slight, but the accident brought to light the
sad story of the desertion of an honest, hard-working husband and six help
less babes by a nenrtless wife and mother.
Richard Dickson. the father of the injured boy, is employed at thfi
Union Iron Works, and is considered by those who know him to be a sober,
industrious man. His family until two days ago consisted of a wife and five
childrenâ two boys and three girlsâ the oldest of which is but six years of
nRÂ»\ Sat unlay night the wife and mother was persuaded to leave her home
and family and cast her fortune with a male admirer.
The husband is heartbroken over the desertion of his helpmate for his
children's sake, as he is at a loss to know how to give his babies the care
they need. He was at work all day yesterday, and during his absence the
children had to depend on the kindness of neighbors. All of the children are
bright and intelligent, and, young as they are, realize that the mother
whom they thought would love and protect them, has left them to the ten
der mercy of strangers.
Rev. W. I. Kip of the Mission of the Good Samaritan has known of the
condition of the family for some time, and when he heard of the injury to
the little boy took immediate steps for the future care of him and his broth
ers and sisters
The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children was notified of the
case, and will probably take some action in the matter. The injured child
was taken home by his father after his injuries had been attended to, but
probably all of the children will be placed in some institution.
It is stated that Mrs. Dickson ran away from home once before, and when
she returned her husband had her placed in the Rescue Home of the Salva
tion Army. Later she repented of her action and was allowed to return to
her family on promise of good behavior.

A number of the members of the First

THE WAR AND THE DAY.
Rev. C. E. Locke Delivers an. In
tensely Patriotic Sermon.
Dr. C. E. Locke of the Central Method
ist Church, who has heretofore shown his
Intense patriotism, delivered 'one of his
American discourses at the evening ser
vice yesterday to an over-crowded house.
The eve of America's anniversary falling
on the Sabbath day was to him a happy
event, more particularly in this year,
when at a time our nation was engaged in
a mighty struggle The present war
would, he was sure, end as all other wars
In which the American people had been
engaged in victory, because we were right
and God always stood with those in the
right. This was not a war for conquest or
gain, but one for suffering humanity
against a cruel and tyrannical people. As
the Hebrews of old were patriotic citizens
who loved the land of their forefathers
and their idolized Jerusalem, fought for
It because it was their home and their
all, so it is with the American citizen, who
above all others on earth has a country
worth loving. In none other is the spirit
of liberty enjoyed by all as It is in the
United States. The incentive for patriot-
Ism is so great that should our beloved
President call for 10,000 volunteers to-mor
row there would be 40,000 volunteers ready
to respond before the setting of the sun.
A high compliment to the valor of our
boys now at the front was paid, which
brought forth a ringing round of ap
plause. We have one of the very host
armies both on land and on the spa that
ever the sun shone on. Nelson said Eng
land expects every man to do his duty;
the same can be said of every American
with this difference, that every American
"does" his duty because his duty is that
of protecting his own home and family.
His patriotism to his country is akin to
the love a man bears to his mother, to
insult her means to have a light on your
hands should you be the one who offered
the Insult. Our citizens are made up of
the best material imported from all the
countries of Europe; they have the brains
and the bone and sinew and the love of
liberty, all of which goes to make brave
and isrood men.
The alliance of England and America
means that the coming century will wit
ness the English speaking people masters
of the whole world and with it the spread
of the gospel of Jesus Christ into the fur
thermost parts of the earth.

Enthusiasm.
"Wild excitement reigned at Camp Mer
ritt last night after the reception of The
i Call bulletins announcing the great and
: glorious news from Santiago. The bulle
i tins were distributed throughout the
i camp.
The Kansas band turned out and ser
| enaded the officers of the camp.
Discipline was all but forgotten, and
! seniors hugged their juniors and yelled
like incnrrigibles.
The Tennessceans turned loose that
, Southern yell and to the tune of "Hot
; Time" fell Into each other's arms and
\ waltzed all over their camp.
Even the staid 'officers of division head
quarters let loose their enthusiasm and
' cheered to the echo the fighting brothers
i in arms they have at the front.

"CHATTERING
DAWS OF MEN"
Realf's Idea as Applied
to Local Politics.
CHEAPNESS OF SELF-GLORY
SPIRIT OF THE FOURTH MAY BE
DISASTROUS.
It Hay Extend to the Breaking Up
of the Little Coteiie That Has
Grown Rich and Lazy on
Politics.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
Broadway, July 3.
For One. day Oakland is to forget the
puny -aspirations of ambitious individuals
arid; to devote her attention to things so
: great .and noble that the selfish minds in
her: midst. cannot even comprehend them.
In common with all other parts of this
Union, -the/ people of this city realized
when. the. 'first shot of the war was fired
that:: there was .something greater than
persona) party. politics. There. were a few,
.It is..true r so blinded by their environments
of -importance created by their ignor
â .ance'and'smallness that they persuaded
themselves these baubles overshadowed
the great . events that now quicken tbe
pulse .'of the nation. â¢ During the past few
â¢ days, : . however, even these have been
.forced to affect ..a show of decency, al
though' they- undoubtedly believe that it
is shockingly bad. taste on the part of the
public':, tq.revere.-.theVDeweys and Hobsons
.'..tit- to-day- rather than themselves.
.Eighteen; years ;ago a noble-hearted sol
;dl!e.r...wbp'was brave enough to face the
armies .of the -.South, but who could not
withstand; the- â¢ warfare of domestic
: troubles,, hastened, his freedom in an Oak
â¢ land hotel;. â Â« Before tloing so he wrote a
: short poernV This man was Richard Realf,
and almost' before the Ink was dry on the
; final expression .of his soul . he fired the
shot that ended his sorrows. One line Of:
.'that poem almost compels the belief that
. the noble soldier-poet had been walking
on Broadway and had been buttonholed
by those who think that cheap political
ambitions are the noblest aims of exist
ence.:: It is /easy to imagine that he was
assailed as he passed down the street
thinking the noblest thoughts by politi
cians informing him that "1 am out for
poundmasti or Governor, or any other
old thing with a salary attached to it.
â¢.It was in â '; October, and the probability is
.-.that. with a November election in sight
tssumption is correct. . And that one
line, In his farewell to the world reads:
'.'And the little, voluble, chattering daws
, of.rtiehl'' .Perhaps another generation of
'â¢th:es<j-"daws:of men" has sprang up since
Reaif .died, .but the genius. is not extinct
by any- meahb'.' .Â« â â  â  .'â¢ â¢ â¢
'. -.O.'n Mlus: l-uurth of July, when the Bag
of the ':L/.nl6;i is for the first time in. his
tory, being' Harried by our soldiers into a
Tiew-.herniaphcri", the. paltry aspirations of
individ'uaik 1 1> \ t-r â  heard of outside their
-.ow.rt.- very smalt world, appear by contrast
â â¢ lof.b'e- nothing short of mockery. The his
tory'of-this Fourth is- not being made by
a ftiw.-who sound thfir own self-adulation
' from \the: public' platform at a meeting be

tri/itiVm.- consists. of .bravery such as the |
worUlaflmlreSv'. rather than of braggado- !
â¢cia-.whicfi-.'aiauKeatfcsVyet there are some
â "little.' voluble* chattering daws of men"
who. have even tO-day failed to realize the
fact ''that- they have so tittle judgment as
not to .i>ee. .the' trend of public opinion in
this county.- For monthsâ for almost a
year, in factâ while t\e true American
mind has beeij: entirely, absorbed in ques
tions that, reached even beyond the con
fines; of the Union, and while the coun
tries of the Old World were locking on
with wonder and with awe at the manner
In which this' country was threatening to
overthrow the old order of things and
start the century with a new history
âyet these "little. . voluble, chattering
daws of men" forced themselves and their
pelf-inflated 'dreams upon an intelligent
public, failing themselves to see the in
decency of such nonsense.
Nearly everybody In Alameda County
realizes that the semi-prophetic words of
America's great home-poet are now being
fulfilled in their most sacred meaning, yet
there are a very few "little, voluble, chat
tering daws of men" in our midst whose
Belf-infilcted blindness prevents them
from appreciating the fact that "human
ity with all its fears, with all its hope of
future years" is not "hanging breathtless"
on their fate, but on the fate of those
brave fellows toward whom on this
Fourth the eye's of the world are turned
and who are Belling their patriotism with
blood and not stultifying it with bombast.
There will not be an exodus from Oak
land on this Fourth of July. Last year
was the extreme in deadness reached by
this city on the great holiday. This year
Oakland has gone to the other extreme,
find from the rising- of the sun until long
after it has sent its last illuminating ray
through the Golden Gate onto the Berke
ley hills, will this county be expressing
its patriotism. At the very commence
ment of the preparations for the celebra
tion the very commendable course was
taken of- putting, the foremost commer
cial men upon the committee. Instead of
as in former years, traducing the very
breadth of ; the spirit of the day by leav
ing; its observance to some particular
clique, which' as a rule antagonized all
other clkjues," the. policy has been adopted
of making it what it should be â an Amer
ican Fourth' 'of . July. The spirit shown
by those, in. ..charge has had the propei
ffect,'- find has-. -spread all 'over the city.
InÂ»tead : of -the. .musty, water-washed dec
oratlons-.thaivhave done duty year after
year., >y>ryiio(iy- has- invested liberally In
new holiday, -attire, and the city has neve.i

boon any -lark, of .support of the finance
commltt,e'e-, : \yhich/-.in itself. Is perhaps the
best proof : that.; Atam.;da County did the
right thing' in : November, 1593. Â«
There is ;â â .ln.lj-.; â â .In.lj-. : ;'i.-.i'.n that the spirit
of Indeperiaencc..in : this county will not be
conflned'.-to- the'leuing 1 . off of fireworks or

Healer J r rHnGi.s...W'arho.n. This earnest-,
but without .â¢doubr..mii?e^iided. fellow has
been rnor- jfcned afeainst than sinning.
That his mapmetlc -hands have helped sev
eral sufferers 'â  is- .'true,- -that they hay*
1 failed to help many more is also true. But
that he believes what he preaches and
does his best to all who visit him cannot
i c doubted by those who have talked with
him and attended his meetings. One of
the great thing* brought against him is
that when a friend called on him Francis
was. in bed covered up by the bedclothes,
use bis very scanty wardrobe had
been washed and he was waiting for it
to dry It is surely not un-American to be
plenty of our heroes in Cuba and
ihi Philippines have no more clothes than
"Brother Francis." Another p< Int which
! has been brought forward as against the i
healer is that he drinks distilled water. |
Surely this is no greater crime than tilling |
himself with whisky every night. An
other of hi? misdoings is that on several
occasions men visited him at his hotel to
talk over business project* with him. Is
there any crime in this? One writer had j
the temerity to suggest that because the
healer was accompunied by a lady and I
that neither he nor the lady had a mar
riage license pasted on their hats it was
evidence that "something was wrong. ,
This is surely an un-American argument. !
Another crime attributed to the healer is |
that he sold stove polish from door to
door. It is not charged that he asked two
prices for it, or that the stove polish was
not good, and 1 fail to see anything dis- j
honorable in earning bread and butter by |
such means.
Francis is not a saint, because if he :
! were thoroughly sincere in his belief that
! the body should be kept absolutely pure I
as a terhple-of the Holy Ghost he would
not have offered a friend a box of cigars,
which he did. He is very well read in the
Scriptures, is harmless, interesting, but
certainly falls a long way short of the
s i\ lor in his performance of miracles. He
is certainly not a schemer or he would not
be so poverty stricken as he undoubtedly
Is, for if he be one-tenth as smart as must
of his defamers credit him with being, he
woiild certainly be able to carry around a
full purse. There are scores of people in
â¢ â¢akland who have been professing for
years to do just what Brotner Francis af
fects to do. and no notice has been taken
of them. There is much in the brother's
method that savors of blasphemy and
not appeal to common Bep.se, but I
think the truth about the be-bearded gen
ileman is told when he is described as a
wandering Englishman â wandering both
bodily jind mentally, and there is nothing
in this menacing to the commonwealth. J

in some way or other, the present drought.

Woodson Allen, of Ashby avenue, who Ik j
Bted in the project, said to-day that
unless a municipal water supply was as
sured before very Ion?, the residents of
the' vicinity would certainly start a com
pany of their own. Ho estimated that n

be required. The company would erect i
tanks together with a' pumping plant.
Water would be furnisher! to the stock
holders only. He exprpssed himself aÂ»

THE SAN FKAXCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JULY 4, 1898.
REUNION OF
KEY'S FAMILY
Members Coming From
Many States.
A GRANDDAUGHTER'S STORY
PLAYED "STAR-SPANGLED BAN-
NER" TO ITS AUTHOR.
Strong Religious Sentiment Was
Always the Leading Trait in the
Family Since Their Set
tlement.
Oakland Office Ran Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 3.
The most interesting visitor to Oak
land of the Fourth is Mrs. Reuben
Norwood, a granddaughter of Francia
Scott Key, whose famous song, "The
Star Spangled Banner," bids fair to be
come the national anthem of the
United States. Her home is at Texar
kana, one of the lively cities that lie on
the borderland of Texas, and is claimed
as a part of Arkansas and Louisiana,
as well as the Lone Star State.
Mrs. Norwood is the only descendant
of the famous poet whom Texas shel
ters, and her visit to the coast is to at
tend a gathering of the Western de
scendents. Captain Baldwin, a great
grandson of Francis Scott Key, and an
officer in the Kansas Volunteers, Is
visiting his mother in San Francisco,
and Mrs. Lieutenant Cutts, a grand
daughter, whose home is at Mare
Island, is also in that city attending
the family reunion.
Mrs. Norwood is a woman well past 70
years of age, but keen of mind and
vigorous of body. She is the daughter
of Anna Key, who married Congress
man Turner of South Carolina. Anna
Key was a belle and a beauty and her
wit and briliancies made her the toast
of all the beaux in Washington, and
later in Atlanta, where as the wife of a
wealthy Congressman, whose father
was Governor of the State, her social
powers were unexcelled.
Mrs. Norwood was raised in all the
luxury of a wealthy Southern home,
with slaves to wait on her slightest
wish. She inherited much of her
mother's beauty and wit and also some
of her grandfather's genius, for she,
too, writes poetry and has set some of;
It to music. She is a clever conversa
tionalist and is full of reminiscences of
the poet, who died when she was about
12 years of ape.
"Francis Scott Key was one of the best
men that ever lived," said she. "There
wore two things that he held dearer than
all else in the worldâ his country and his
God. He inculcated Into his children and
his grandchildren this love. He was a
quiet, modest man and was not wont to
talk of himself or what he had done. He
was an intellectual man, and I remember
that every Christmas brought a box of
books from grandfather to his grandchil
dren,, and these were days when books
were expensive luxuries. He was a nan
of most domestic tastes and nothing
pleased him more than to gather his chil
dren and grandchildren around him at
family reunions. He was a devoted
churchman, and wrote several hymns
which will be found in the hymnal.
"In personal appearance he was a rath
er small m;in. but fine looking. He was
dignified and yet there was an affection
ate kindness about him that drew all
hearts to him. He was devoted to his
grandchildren and they in turn were de
voted to him."
Mrs. Norwood declared that many of
Key's poems are now lost. During his
lifetime he would never consent to have
any of them published, and though one of
his daughters collected several poems for
publication later, the collection is not
complete.
Mrs. Norwood is an accomplished musi
cian and plays skillfully on the harp,
guitar and piano. Among her music is
a brilliant arrangement of "The Star
spangled Banner." which as a girl she
played to the composer, and now as an
old lady still plays for her friends.
Mrs. Norwood is out here for an in
definite length of time and may not re
turn until m-xt year. She has had several
pictures taken of the monument in G<->ld
en Gate Park to her grandfather's mem
ory. Mare Island, where the bodies of
her mother and father are buried, will
also be visited before Mrs. Norwood re
turns to Texas.
The most noted characteristic of the
family of the Keys has been for three
generations their strong religious ten
dencies. Thomas * Key, the father of
Francis Scott Key, who died in Maryland
in 1764. left n will which is remarkable for
its devoutness and manliness. Had all
slave owners been of the same disposition
as old Thomas Key, the Civil War would
have been postponed for a long period.
Compared with the curt "In the name of
God, amen," with which modern wills
commence, Thomas Key's opening para
graph is a complete declaration of Chris
tian faith, even to the "Trinity in Unity
and Unity and Trinity" to whom he ap
peals. The will makes detailed provision
for every debt and every slave, and
breathes the spirit of nobility and charity
in every line;
PATRIOTIC CHRISTIANS.
Impressive and Stirring Sermons in
the Churches of -txlameda.
ALAMEDA, July 3.â Several of the
churches to-day held special patriotic ser
vices.
The First Presbyterian Church was
elaborately decorated with flowers and
flags and the choir rendered excellent
music. Dr. Brush preached a very able
sermon on the "Imperial Policy pt Amer
ica.", A stirring feature of the* morning
services at the close of the sermon was
singing of the "Star-spangled Banner"
by the choir and congregation.
In Christ E piscopal Church, Rector
preached a patriotic sermon. The
soldiers were invited especially to attend.
The church was beautifully decorated.
Patriotic services were held in the
Park-streel Methodist Episcopal Church
this evening. In the Young People's En
deavor meeting to-night Dr. C. A. Coe of
the Northwestern University of Chicago
made an address on "Christian Citizen
ship," after which Chaplain W. H. Scott
of the United States army spoke on "Our
Country and Its Flag." The pastor. Dr.
Bovard, followed with a discourse on
"The Religious I'hases of the War With
Spain." The church was decorated with
the stars and stripes and patriotic music
was rendered.
A BABY BUFFALO AT
THE PARK ZOO
SMALL CRCWDS â  TSTEN TO A
FINE MUSICAL. PROGRAMME
The Soldiers Enjoy Lively Swimming
Contests at Sutro's and Break Â«.
Coast Under Water Record.
Owing to the lowering clouds and cold
mists driven Inland by the winds of the
'â  sea the park and Cliff House were unpop
ular with the masses of pleasure seekers
; yesterday. Many lovers of melody, how
ever, enjoyed the programmes at both
; places The Park Band played much long
ler than usual. It began at 2 o'clock and
did not leave the stand until after 5 In
the evening. The programme was com
posed of both sacred and patriotic selec
tions, and the martial selections that car
ried the mind from those peaceful scenes
out under-the trees, to the faraway shores
of Cuba, where America's sons are bat
tling for the right, were encored again
and again. At Sutro Baths and at the
Chutes the largest numbers congregated.
An appropriate programme was rendered
at the Chutes and the various features
were enjoyed by all. This evening will
probably see a larger crowd at the Chutes
than that of yesterday. The city fireworks
I will be displayed just opposite the big
pleasure, resort, and when the last rocke<.
has hurst and spread its myriad of mul
ticolored lights a novel pyrotechnic dis
play will be given on the lake in the
â¢ 'hutes ground. If the piece can be per
fected by this evening, and it is thought
that it can, .a representation of the sink
ing of the Maine will be the feature. A
I handsome little vessel, the counterpart of
I the great ship that went ,to the bottom
through the treachery of our now common
enemy, will swim on the lake, meet with
disaster and go to the bottom, its outline,
| guns and turrets being lines of fire, bril
| liaiit as the tints of a kaleidoscope.
The principal feature of the programme
at Sutro Baths was the underwater swim
ming of G. Bundy of the Washington and
H. Thompson of the Minnesota regiment.
Both contestants beat the coast record of
43 yards, held by Lonnie Trueworthy. The
event was decided a tie. as both men
dived the entire length of the tank, 48
yards.
The winners of the other events were:
Fifty-yard dash for Kansas Volunteers, J.
Miller. L. Funua; 75-yard dash for Ten
essee Volunteers, G. Michols, G. Drake;
100-yard dash for Colorado Volunteers G
Clark. J. Anderson; 120-yard dash for Min
nesota Volunteers. F. Buck, C. Cragie
150-yard dash for California Volunteers, J.
Brit. F. Dahne; high-diving championship
of the volunteers. G. Leiue of the Seventh
California, 73 feet.
Many new attractions have appeared at
the park during the past week. Saturday
a baby buffalo came into the world and
the day preceding an elk was born. The
little creatures, in accordance with their
native instincts, become startled at the
approach of their admirers and scurry
away as fast as their immature limbs will
carry them. They are handsome little fel
lows and make a valuable addition to the
features at the zoo. John Daggett of this
city has donated a long list of Indian curi
osities to the museum and they will be in
place in a few days.
Bittejj by a Fly.
George Peterson, 658 Jessie street, was
sitting in a barber shop on Seventh street,
near Mission, yesterday morning, waiting
his turn to be shaved. There was a slight
cut on his left thumb and two flies alight
ed on the cut. Almost immediately after
ward his thumb began to swell and he
hurried to the Receiving Hospital, but be
fore he reached there his hand and arm
were badly swollen. Dr. Rinne cauterized
and j dressed the thumb. He thinks that
the flies must have carried some poison
ous substance with them.

A card engraver and designer who lives in Brooklyn, says :
*â¢ I work steadily all day in a downtown office in New York.
Often when I get through at night, I am tired and faint at my
stomach. I suppose my stomach is tired too. Anyway I feel
hungry and I am apt to eat too much supper, and the conse-
quence is I frequently used to have a bad stomach all night
and a head on me the next morning. But I have lately found
that if I take a
ripans
after my supper, it digests all right. Whenever my stomach
has extra work to do, the Tabule takes hold and Helps like
a hired man."

COCKROACHESâ Subscriber, City. It
is said that btfrax is one of the best roach !
exterminators--that there is something
peculiar, either in the touch or smell of

water until the strength is extracted; mix
-,vr- decoction with molasses and spread
it in plates In the kitchen or other apart

MINERS INCH IN CALIFORNIA-J.
R.. Qulncy, Cal. By an act of the Legis
lature May 1. 1872. there is the nearest
approach to the definition of a miner's
Inch as applied in California. It is that
the claimant of water must declare in
hi? notice "that he claims the water there
flowing to the extent of (giving the num
ber of inches) inches measured v- 'er a
four-inch pressure." James D. Schuyler,
Assistant Engineer, in the report of the
State Engineer of California to the Leg
islature, session of 1880, gives the mathe
matical equivalent of an Inch of water as
"0.01996 of a cubic foot per second. That is
1.Y.<~ cubic feet per minute or 8.954 gal
lons, per minute. â¢

at fever heat owing to the destruction of
Cervera's lleet by Sampson, who has
added fresh laurels to those already won
by the American navy. The news of this
great naval exploit, probably equal to

The Lesson of To-Day.

"Blessed is that nation whose God is the
Lord." The pastor spoke of the Lord's
onre over this country from the beginning.
(!â¢â  dwelt on its development on Christian
lines and the need of Christian manhood
both in times of peace and of war. The
sermon was more in keeping with the
lesson taught by to-day's anniversary
rather than any lesson taught by the war

CHiCAGO, July 3.â The situation be
tween the striking stereotypers and the
publishers of Chicago remains practi
cally unchange., and probably no Chi
cago paper will publish before Tuesday
morning, at the earliest.
The publishers had a conference this
afternoon, when it appeared that the
number of stereotypers on the way
from various parts of the country was
very satisfactory. It was determined,
however, that no attempt to issue to
morrow would be made. The publish
ers are confident that by to-morrow
evening they will be sufficiently well
equipped to resume publication Tues
day, but with the papers somewhat re
duced in size.
A committee from the Pressmen's
Union waited on the publishers to-day,
asking for an opportunity to act as a
committee of conciliation, but the pub
lishers refused absolutely to have any
thing to do with the Stereotypers'
Union in any way hereafter, decluring
that none of its members would be per
mitted to work in any of their offices
again.
A special train from Milwaukee, over
the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul
road, came in to-night bringing extra
editions of Milwaukee evening papers
to partially supply the demand of read

minute, and the papers were disposed of
to eager citizens almost as soon as they
appeared on the street.

started in the residence of Mrs. Frank

mother having died that morning. The j

total loss. The barn and $300 worth of hay

dry grass and extending over a mile from j

WAR NEWS AT THEATERS.
Sampson and the First California
- Enthusiastically Cheered.
The news of Sampson's demolition of
Cervera's fleet was received . with wild
enthusiasm at tjie theaters. The Call's
bulletins were read from " the various
stages and caused intense excitement.
At the Chutes there were over a thou
sand soldiers in the audience and when
the announcement of the glorious vic
tory was received the boys in blue
howled themselves hoarse. They
threw their caps in the air, hugged
each other and danced around in a
maddened enthusiasm.
At the California Theater an Ameri
can ilag was lowered from the ilies
with Sampson's portrait attached, and
Miss Minnie Dreyfous sang the "Star
Spangled Banner" from, 1 the gallery.
The audience arose and joined in the
chorus, which was led by Rhys Thom
as, the "Uncle Tom" of the cast.
The Orpheum and Morosco's were
packed and the news caused a pande
minium of delight. At the Tlvoli Ed
Stevens invited the audience to sing
the "Star Spangled Banner" and the
invitation was eagerly accepted. The
patriotic production of "Fort Frayne"
at the Columbia was particularly apro
pos and the packed house applauded
the news.
Are They Worthy of Their Sires P
"Arc America"* Sons Worthy of Their
Sires?" was the interesting and patriotic
subject of a lecture delivered last even
ing by the Rev. J. Stephens before a large
congregation at the Simpson Memorial
Episcopal Church, of which he Is pastor.
The preacher drew a well defined parallel
between the revolutionary and the pres
ent war, closely linking the soldier of to
day with the soldier of 70. In the course
of the lecture the preacher touched upon
the subject of Independence Day, out
lining the necessity of a universal Cele
bration of the nation's natal day.
"Seldom, if ever," he said, "will the
nation see such a demonstration of patri
otism as will be held to-morrow through
out the entire Union. We are just be
ginning to realize the meaning <>f the Dec
laration of Independence, and understand
the principles upon which it is founded.
As we look back to the time when the
English yoke of oppression was cast aside
and remember the framers of the national
constitution, that noble product of those
colonists from the Old World, we are as
sisted in realizing more fully the mean
ing of the revolution, and the principles
upon which the constitution is based, by
a contrast of the governmental crisis of
that period with the national crisis of to
day.
Immediately after the sermon a patri
otic song service was rendered by the
choir, the chorus of the national hymns
being sung by the congregation.
Overlooked the Flagpole.
Although every outward indication to
day will point to a general and appro
priate observance In commemoration of
the Union, there are many faults to be
considered. T..e members of the Street
Committee of the Board of Supervisors,
whose duty it is to advocate and procure
the necessary appropriation for the equip
ment of the public parks with flags and
staffs, have failed to do so either from
negligence or direct motive. The parks
that are provided with flags can boast of
nothing more than ragged apologies of the
national emblem. Jefferson square, which
will lie in full sight of thousands of pa
triotic- citizens and strangers of the city,
will show no evidence of Old Glory. The
fla,g is there, but covered up and hidden
in the tool shop for the want of a pole on
â which to erect it.
Accused of ilobbery.
Klttie Phillips, a notorious character
living in Bacon place, was arrested yes
terday and charged with grand larceny.
She Is accused of having robbed A. B.
Faries.

FIFTEEN
FOOLHARDY
GOLDSEEKERS
Left Boston in the
Stowell Sherman
WITHOUT A NAVIGATOR
CARED FOR BY THE CONSUL AT
MONTEVIDEO.
When Picked Up by the Pennsyl
vania They Were Without
Money and the Schooner
Wa.3 Unseaworthy.
'..'â¢â¢â¢â¢ Of all the foolhardy expeditions ever grot
together to hunt for gold, that which
started out last November on the schoon
er Stowell Sherman from Boston for the
â¢ Klondike -was the worst.. The vessel was
â¢without a competent navigator, was
manned by school boys and clerks, and
while the Stowell Sherman was well pro
visioned there was very little ready
money In sight. The end of it all was
that the schooner was abandoned at
Montevideo and nine of the gold hunters
were sent on here on the steamer Pennsyl
vania by the United States Consul.
When the Klondike craze was at its
height a party of young men got together
in the Hub City and decided to purchase
a schooner, provision her and start for the
new El Dorado. There were fifteen of
them, and Martin F. Culbert was chosen
captain and . Thomas Roose chief officer,
while Charles Cousins was installed as
navigating officer. A start was made last
November, and for six months the
schooner was buffeted by every wind that
blew and â  her bowsprit was pointed to
every point of the compass in a vain
Bearch for land. Storms were encountered
and the amateur sailors had a terrible
time of it. Finally, when worn out and
disgusted the coast of Brazil was reached
and the vessel made Para. There Second
Officer James Doonan, C. W. Coburn and
P. S. Yerxa left the expedition in disgust
and shipped before the mast on a Nor
â¢vvi-eian bark bound for Pensacola.
After leaving Para the Stowell Sherman
was headed for Montevideo, and during
the run Charles Cousins, the navigator,
was taken sick and died. He was only
confined to his bed one night, and the
doctors at Montevideo said that beri-beri
â was the cause of his death.
On May 2 the schooner was run into
Montevideo, and there she is still. There;
â  was no one left who was considered com
petent to take the vessel through the
Strnits of Magellan, and besides she re
quired a thorough overhauling and there
Was no money in the treasury. She was
examined by the marine surveyors and
ti â¢ ;. said that in her condition she was
fit to make the journey to San Fran-
The eleven men left aboard were
in ;i quandary. They had the vessel and
â  they had provisions, but they had no
ri â  . They could, of course, stay by
the snip until all the provisions were
. up, but then what were they to do?
After a fortnight spent in considering
the n : tter the men appealed to the I'nit-
Consul. When ho understood
the" ureed to do what he could
g thorn home. On May 17
ania put in there to make
Bom< : airs to her machinery and
randed gold hunters were put
on her. I aptain Culbert and First Officer
.'. â¢ . ied behind to look after the
schooner, and the other nine are now in
San Francisco.
The men who came up on the Pennsyl
vania report the Klondikers on the
schooner Actaea stranded at Buenos
â¢Ayres. This expedition was got up in
New York and sailed last February with
Captain McCarthy in control. This party
also has. plenty of provisions but no
monej , and in consequence there was
..ng -with which to pay for fresh pro
visions and necessary repairs. At Buenos
Ayres, therefore, the Klondikers will have
to remain until remittances reach them
or another steamer puts In, on which the
United States Consul can send them home.
Four other vessels are making long voy
ages from Atlantic ports with Klondikers
aboard. The bark Apate is out 138 days
from New York. She piloted the Stowell
Siierman into Montevideo on May 2, but
as her gold hunters had some funds they
were able to get away again on time. The
Thomas F. Bayard, out IC2 days from
Philadelphia, sailed for this port from
Valparaiso on May 9, while the Rein L.
Richardson, out 143 days, and the Mildred
E. out 116 days from Boston, have not
â  been spoken since they sailed away from
Boston. All of them, except the Agate,
are under IK) tons burden and the voyaga
on them must be, to say the least of it
irksome. They are all old timers, the
Stowell Sherman having been built in 1876,
so it is no wonder that they required re
pairs before attempting the Straits of
Magellan.
The report of Captain Doxrud of the
Pennsylvania is very short: "Eighty-five
days fmm Philadelphia: thirty-seven days
from Montevideo; twenty-three days from
Coronel. .May 18â Put into Montevideo for
Blight repairs to machinery. June 7â Put
into Coronel for coal. Brought from
Montevideo nine destitute seamen for the
United States Consul."
Shortly after her arrival the Pennsyl
'. â¢ 'vanla was docked at Harrison-street
wharf, and the work of discharging her
will begin- to-morrow morning. As soon
as she is clear of freight the work of
. puting in accommodations for the soldiers
â¢ " will begin. In about a fortnight the big
:.' . steamer can be got ready to follow her
elst.'T shipsâ the Ohio and Indianaâ to
Manila.
. A SHIP'S HARD LUCK.
Made a Long Voyage and
Lost Her Charter â Water
Front Noes.
.. Overdue reinsurance paid by the
underwriters and loss of a charter
through- failure" to reach port In time Is
the hard luck story of Captain Evans of
the British ship Penrhyn Castle.
The .vessel left Newcastle, N. S. "W.,
over four months ago with a cargo of coal
fop San Francisco. After discharging
here she â¢ was chartered to proceed to
Portland to load wheat for Europe. The
charter party expired on the Ist Inst., and
Â the vessel only reached Astoria yesterday.
â¢â¢'". The Penrhyn Castle reached here on
June. 16 and had taken so long to come
from Australia that 10 per cent reinsur
. ance was paid on her. That left a fort
' night in which 'to discharge the cargo and
get her into the Columbia river. The
Â« ccar'go was got out .in a week and on June
' 24 the ship started out in tow of the tug
Wizard. Everybody thought that the ves
sel would, get to her destination in ample
time, but the fates were against her, as
- the. tow-boat broke down and Captain Ev
ans had to. proceed under sail. The Pen
rhyn Castle reached her destination two
o days too late and nothing as yet has been
heard from the Wizard. When the big
raft that was coming down. in tow of the
â¢ tugs Monarch and Rescue was seen off
Crescent City by the steamer Umatllla
only one tug had hold of It. It was
thought that the other one had gone into
Crescent City for coal, but it may now
Â» turn out that she sighted â > the disabled
Wizard and went to her assistance.
Second Mate McCarthy of the ship Ta
coma, who tried to kill Officer Dillon of
the Harbor Police and got shot in the
â¢ legs for his pains, was taken to the Cen
tral police station yesterday. Some time
ago McCarthy was arrested on almost a
.similar charge by Officer George Lake.
He went into his room in the Brooklyn
Hotel on East street and began firing off
his revolver. He shot through the door,
the walla, celling and floor and drove ev
erybody In the hpuse out on the sidewalk.
T\ hen arralgred in court he told the
Judge he though he was fighting the
Spaniards find his honor let him go..
. Early yesterday morning he got another
"fighting .lag" on. and ho proceeded to

this tlmo because the landlord would not
give him any more liquor, oncers Di'inr
and McGratn were soon on the. scene and

COLORS FOR THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.
Impressive Ceremonies Attending the Flag Raising at the South
ern Station.
The exercises attendant upon the raising of a beautiful American flag at the Southern Police Station at noon yes
terday were of the most impressive character. In deference to the wishes of Captain Spillane they were arranged
on simple lines, losing nothing in solemnity thereby.
The flagstaff was erected on the McAlister-street side of the new City Hall grounds. The lawn upon which
the invited guests were grouped was carefully boarded over and seats were provided for hundreds of people.
Among those within the enclosure were Judge Conlan, Judge Low, Judge Mogan, Captain John Spillane and wife,
Thomas Spillane, Miss Mary Spillane, Captain Wittman, Captain Seymour, Captain Bohen, Captain Dunleavy,
Lieutenant Birdsall, Lieutenant Anderson and Chief Lees, the latter in subdued civilian garb.
Lieutenant Hanna presided over the exercises. With a few remarks in keeping with the occasion, he intro
duced Policeman Thomas R. Judson, who recited with dramatic effect "Drake's Address to the American Flag."
At its conclusion he was greeted with cheers, which did not subside until Lieutenant Hanna led Miss Mary Spil
lane forward. The captain's daughter then released the chords which bound the flag and "Old Glory" floated out on
the breeze. Cheers were given for the flag amid a deafening cannonading from fire crackers exploded by Ben.
Davis of the Health Department.
The principal address of the day was then delivered by Senator Frank McGowan. It was thoughful and
clever, breathing of patriotism and love of country throughout He spoke not of the flag, material, but of the flag
emblematic of progress, patriotism, civilization and above all as the flag of an united people. The speaker told of
the men who had fought under the flag and who are to-day shedding their life's blood for the principles of liberty,
upon which this nation is founded. He spoke of the struggle in the name of humanity to free the Cubans from the
thralldom of Spain.
Miss Viola Vogel recited Webster's address to the flag, and then more cheers were given for the flag, for Cap
tain Spillane, for the police, and finally for Chief Lees. A throng of spectators crowded Larkin street, viewing with
appreciation the exercises.
pistol McCarthy placed the muzzle of It
against the officer's stomach. It was then
that the shot was fired that placed the
sailor hors dv combat. His wounds were
dressed at the Harbor Receiving Hospital
by Drs. Hill and Zabala.
IN BARGE AND
OUTRIGGED SKIFF
THE OARSMEN FURNISH SOME
GOOD SPORT.
The Alameda Crew, in Their New
Boat, Win the Senior
Barge Race.
For some time past the Independence
day rowing and sculling events have at
tracted little attention, and the racing ..as
been of a mediocre character. But yester
day at Long Bridge really good sport was
afforded uy the skiff and barge races held
under the auspices of the regatta commit
tee of the Pacific Athletic Association.
The committee, â which is made up of
five members, one from each of the five
leading rowing clubs on the bay, had ar
ranged four racesâ junior and senior out
rigged skiffs and junior and senior barges.
The races were not quite punctual in be
ginning, but once begun were brought off
in good time.
For the junior outrigged skiff race,
which opened the programme, there were
six entries, two each from the Alamedas
and Pioneers and one each from the
Ariels and South Ends. The two Ala
meda men, not having any skiff to pull
in, retired, as did also P. Orr of the Pio
neers, leaving the event to be fought out
by Coney Ochs of the Pioneers, W. Howe
of the Ariels and J. Lyons of the South
Ends. Howe got the inside station and
the best of the start, but on the way out
to the stake broke his oarlock and retired.
Coney Ochs won easily by six lengths in
ten minutes.
The second event was the junior barge
race, for which ai. the five clubs had en
tered crews. The contestants narrowed
down to three, the Dolphins, the South
Ends and the Ariels. The center station
was allotted to the Dolphins, the inside to
the Ariels and the outside to the South
Ends. The South Ends got the worst of
the start and fell behind, the Ariels and
Dolphins rounded the stakes together,
the Dolphins winning an excellent race
by two lengths. Timo. 9 mm.
The following were the crews:
1. Dolphin Boating Clubâ Victor Caz
lieri, bow; F. Schwarting, two; W. O.
Patch, three; A. W. Pape, stroke. A. -W.
Pane worked splendidly and was well sec
onded by Patch.
2. Ariel Rowing Clubâ E. McDonough,
A WILD AND PATRIOTIC JUBILEE.
How the News of Sampson's Victory Ran Its Fiery
Course Through the Streets.
All day long the crowds that anxiously watched the bulletin boards for
news from Santiago saw nothing reassuring in the reserved dispatches that
the Navy and War Departments gave out. What little was heard from Shaf
ter and Sampson sank deep in the hearts of the public, for the news was
portentous and full of omen for the gallant army at the front. Every indi
cation was for a somber Fourth, and the very atmosphere became heavy
with dread forebodings.
At about 8:30 in the evening The Call bulletined a dispatch which told
such another story as that of May 1, when the anouncement of Dewey's
victory swept the chain of nations from one end of the world to another
and gave birth to a universal wonderment.
When the destruction of Cervera's fleet was made known to the neople
gathered around The Call's bulletin a great shout went up. Grave fears
gave way to ecstatic emotion. From the bulletin boards, like an electric
current that knows no period of time in its transmission from one point to
another, the news spread through the masses on Market street, which soon
became a surging sea of emotional humanity. Sampson was the name on
every tongue. Glory was for the victor and base derision for the people
who, In their arrogant and presumptuous pride, scorned the arms of Amer
ica. The old men on the street recalled how thirty-five years ago, on July
3, the great battle of Gettysburg was fought, and how this ray of light burst
upon a field that was altogether dark and full of despair. The young men
with thoughts only of the present and the future, wondered what next
could be added to grace the American banners in this present struggle
with effete Spain.
Good news was close upon the heels of good news last night. Hardly
hRd a nervous composure settled on the crowds In the street when ariother
bulletin was flashed out telling of the arrival of the First California at
Manila. With renewed vigor the blasts of patriotic ardor swept over all.
There were cheers for the men fighting in torrid Cuba, and cheers for the
untried and embryonic heroes In an antipodal land.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JULY 4, 1898.
bow; A. Haughton, two; F. Loth, three;
E. Lynch, stroke.
3. South End Rowing Clubâ C. Jenkins,
bow; J. Blumlein, two; A. Mclsaac, three;
T. J. Fitzpatrick, stroke.
The third event was the senior outrigged
skiff race. For this there were five en
tries, but the Alameda men having no
skiffs withdrew, leaving as contestants H.
A. Wittkopf and Frank Wilson of the
Ariels and W. O. Patch of the Dolphins.
Wittkopf had the outside station, Patch
the inside, and Wilson the center. After
proceeding a few hundred yards, Wilson
bored Patch, and a foul ensued, but both
men rowed on. All three made the turn
together, but on the way home Wilson
gradually forged ahead, and, though
Patch gamely stuck to his work and made
a capital spurt, Wilson won by about four
lengths. Patch second and Wittkopf third.
Time, 9K minutes. Patch's chance of win
ning was much lessened by the fact of his
having rowed a hard race in the Dolphin
barge just before starting in the skiff
event.
The fourth and last event was the se
nior outrigged barge race, for which the
Ariels, Pioneers, South Ends and Alame
das had entered. The Ariels dropped out,
the Pioneers had the inside station, the
South Ends the center and the Alamedas
the outside. Tue Alamedas occupied their
new barge, which looked very neat and
smart. They had tried to row over from
Alameda in her, but she shipped so much
water that they were compelled to put
back, and bring her over on the Creek
boat. After the turn the Alajnedas began
to draw away, eventually beating the
South Ends by two clear lengths. Time.
8 minutes 30 seconds. The crews were
made up as follows: 1. Alameda Boat
Clvb â E. Hadcock, bow; W. Hansen, 2; A.
Webb, 3; F Ayers, stroke; E. Hanson,
coxswain. 2. South End Rowing Clubâ S.
Friend, bow; M. Breen, 2; J. Pallas, 3;
E. Scully, stroke; G. McGrill, coxswain.
3. Pioneer Rowing Clubâ G. Larsen, bow;
Conrad Ochs, 2; F. Orr, 3; W. St. John,
stroke.
The course was one and a half miles
with a turn, and the water was smooth,
though a moderate breeze was blowing.
The races were in charge of the follow
ing officials: Referee, J. J. McCarthy;
starter, J. T. Sullivan; marshal, John No
lan; assistant marshal. W. H. Brown;
judgesâ T. Kennedy and E. Sullivan of the
Dolphins, W. St. John and A. Smith of the
Pioneers, H. A. Pless am. D. O'Connell of
the Ariels, A. H. Mellitz and W. Fox of
the South Ends, L. Thomas and Charles
Smith of the Alamedas; timersâ J. Kee
nan of the Dolphins, J. ODea of the
South Ends, F. O'Neil of the Pioneers,
George Steffens of the Ariels, W. B.
Hlnchman of the Alamedas.
War Time Sermons.
The Rev. John Hemphlll of Calvary-
Presbyterian Church chose war-time
themes for both his morning and even
ing discourses yesterday. In part he said:
"On general principles I am opposed to
i war, which, I am sure, no one loves. We
i are a peace-loving nation, yet God has
safely led us through five wars during the
, past century and a quarter. The Bible
says that war has served a divine pur
pose. I reverence our noble patriots who
have fought so nobly for our land. We
should honor both the dead and the
living."
BROKE AN AMERICAN
SWIMMING RECORD
H. F. BREWER SETS A GREAT
QUARTER-MILE PACE.
Was Disabled for the Half -Mile Con
test, but Expects to Do More
Time-Smashing To-Day.
The Results.
The admirers of aquatic sports who did
not attend the swimming contests at the
I Lurline Baths yesterday afternoon missed
| the best battles In this line that have
been witnessed in this city for a long
I time. The Lurline Swimming Club car
ried off nearly all the honors and they
I declare that they would have taken all If
I it had not been for the disability of their
I best man. Brewer.
One of the unexpected results of the
games was the smashing of the American
record in the 440-yard race by H. F.
Brewer of the Lurlines, who covered the
distance in 6:10 minutes, as against his
former pace of 6:23 3-5. Brewer took his
record with a magnificent burst of speed
that was well maintained throughout the
distance. His showing puts him well on
the way to take the world's record. E. B.
Stolle was second; time, 6:32 1-5.
In the 50-yard maiden H. H. Wiedeman
of tho Lurlinea won in 29*4 sees., being
within a quarter second of the American
record held by Dan Renear of Chicago.
G. A. Hinkel of the Lurlines was second.
The 75-yard maiden was taken by
Wiedeman in 42 sees, flat, G. A. Hinkel
second.
The half mile contest was not satisfac
tory by reason of the fact that Brewer
was unable to take part after his violent
exertions in the other races, and while he
was resting he was examined by his
physician and advised not to enter, as any
further competition at that time might
lead to serious heart troubles.
The result of the race was a viotorv for
the Dolphin Swimming and Boating Club
E. R. Stolle taking first in 13:53. as against
14:17, his old record. J. E. Odgers of the
Lurlines was a had second.
A polo game which followed the races
was won by Captain Pomins' team, and
there was an exhibition of high diving by
Professor Cobleyn, who dove from a
height of 99 feet. Some fast and fancy
swimming was done by Professor Goetze
and R. Cardell, the mascot of the Lurline
Club, did some clover clown diving
This afternoon there will be another
race meet. The events will include 100
yards, 220 yards and one mile. Brewer
will contest and try to make some new
recoias.
Those races are proving highly interest
ing and by reason of the brilliant work
of yesterday will attract the attention of
that numerous class throughout the world
who take an Interest in such amateur
contests. Tiie Luline orchestra furnished
acceptable music during the games.
PATRIOTIC SPIRITUALISTS.
Mrs. Lillie Delivers an Interesting
Address on the War.
The regular weekly meeting of the So
ciety of Progressive Spiritualists was held
last night at 305 Larkin street. After an
entertaining programme had been ren
dered Mrs. L,illle delivered an Interesting
address on the present war.
"We are fighting for only one cause,"
she declared, "and that is liberty. When
Spain sought to persecute and murder
the helpless Cubans President McKinley
and the people of the United States arose
in their wrath and declared that it should
stop. War between the two nations re
sulted, and although hundreds of our gal
lant boys have fallen in the heat of battle
the stars and stripes will shortly wave
over the Spanish possessions. While our
hearts trembled and tears coursed down
our faces as we looked upon the brave
soldiers who left this city to defend the
flag of our nation, yet we all felt glad
that they were bent on a merciful mis
sion of delivering the unfortunate Cubans
from the tyranny and abuse of the
Spanish."
Mrs. Lillie was warmly congratulated
at the conclusion of her patriotic address.

A DESPERATE
WOMAN TAKES
MIXED POISON
Only Nineteen, but Is
Tired of Life.
DRUG NOT DEADLY ENOUGH
A STRIKING CASE OF MAN'S
BASE INHUMANITY.
Still in Her Teens, but Has Been
Marrieu, Divorced and Is Now
Friendless â Mrs. Alvis'
Story.
Dolly Alvls, a pretty girl, 19 years of
age, felt yesterday that she was tired
of life and swallowed a potion consisting
of aconite and iodine. It was not strong
enough to end her earthly career, and
she was soon pronounced out of danger
by the attaches at the Receiving Hospital.
Her maiden name was Baldwin, her
father being William Baldwin, a well
known diver in Seattle. She was married
when she was 15 years of age, her hus
band being manager of a machinery linn
in Seattle. A baby girl was born to them
and it seemed as if their cup of happiness
was full. But the tempter came in the
shape of Lieutenant John Van Wykoff
of the Fire Brigade, and the husband,
about a year ago, secured a divorce from
his wife.
According to Mrs. Alvis, the lieutenant
promised to marry her, but he fa'led to
keep his promise, and as her frlenda
looked upon her with coldness, she deter
mined to leave Seattle and fight the bat
tle of life for herself.
She came here about seven weeks ago
and tried hard to procure a situation as
cook in a restaurant or any other thing
that might turn up, but was unsuccess
ful. She had been living with a family
named Desmond on Fifteenth street, but
a week ago quarreled with the head of
the household and was turned out. She
went to live with Richard Currie, a col
ored hackman. and his wife, at 113 Aus
tin street, and yesterday afternoon in a
fit of despondency she swallowed the poi
son, after bidding Currie and his wife
good-by.
Her grandmother, uncle and aunt live
in Stockton. Her uncle is a prominent
physician there, but she will not ask him
for help as he refused to assist her at
the time she was divorced from her hus
band. She also claims that through her
father she is a distant relative of "Lucky' 1
Baldwin.
BREEDERS' MEETING
AT OAKLAND TODAY
CR3AT CROWD EXPECTED TO BE
IN ATTENDANCE.
An Exceptionally Good Card Offered,
With the Innovation of a Free
Field â Some Interesting
Track Notes.
The card at Oakland to-day Is an ex
ceptionally good one, and with the inno
vation of a free field should attract the
banner crowd of the meeting. The pro
gramme for the extra twelve days will
be published this week, and if it fills, as
It certainly should do, the extra two
weeks beginning Monday will surely be
given. The horsemen, therefore, have
the matter entirely In their own hands.
The big chestnut pacer Bernard stepped
a mile in 2:15*4 Saturday morning and
was then sent a fifth-quarter in :32%, a
2:11 clip.
Billy Donathan says he can step Resort
a quarter in :30, but when it comes to
racing it is a different proposition getting
him away level.
Thompson has tried "the governor" on
Little Thorn, and he goes away steadily
enough now to get the money even If the
heats be 2:08 or 2:09.
Sky Pointer makes his debut Friday.
He is a full brother to the pioneer two
minute horse, Star Pointer, 1:59V4,.
"Julian" Bill has quite won the hearts
of all horsemen by the way he has pre
pared the Oakland track for the trotters,
and it would be hard to find better foot
ing than he has furnished.
Many have noticed the strong resem
blance Little Thorn bears to the grand
little ex-champion Robert J, 2:01%.
Walter Mabeau's injured wrist is doing
well, but it will be some weeks before he
again gets into a sulky.
Little Osita, by McKinney, is stepping
great guns and can reel off a mile in
2:15 "so easy" that he looks to have a
grand prospect in his class, barring acci
dents.
Delphi, by Director, very closely re
sembles his noted sire, the hero of the
grand circuit of '83.
There are more hobbled pacers at the
track than one ever saw at a meeting be
fore. Next season the powers that be say
they shall be barred entirelyâ that is. the
National Association does, but the Amer
ican will continue to allow their usage.
Monterey, 2:13%, does not look up to
race estate, yet good judges are busy pre
dicting 2:11 or 2:12 for him.
The "guess club" have Agitato down
for a 2:05 mark should Maben get right to
"sight" him before the season's end. Ha
is working right well at present.
A. Hayward's grand stallion Stambou
lette now has a record of 2:12%, and will
doubtless cut a figure in the $10,000 stake
at Charter Oak, Hartford, later on. He
could step the San Mateo farm track very
fast before Van Bokkelen took him East.
Klamath, the veteran trotter, is better
this season than ever. At Denver he
stepped to c three-quarters in 1:33%â a
2:05 clip. Hi:; owner offers to match him
against any trotter in the land.
The dam of Alix, 2:03%, has been bred
to Sable Wilkes, 2:IS, the one time three
year-old champion. It should be good
property, a colt from such parents.
John Goldsmith at one time owned Fitz
Aymou's sire. Waldstein. The late reins
man was a grand judge of .iorseflesh.
Williams always gives Monterey an easy
mile to cart before his races. Few trot
ters stride as far as does the son of Sid-
ncy.
After Roderick's sulky broke down driv
ers thought it advisable to put a kicking
strap on in big fields. Then, if a wheel
buckles, the vehicle is kept off the horse's
heels. It is an idea of Billy Ewing, who
formerly racori Dandy Jim, 2:0f1%.
I Direct could probably pace to a record
of 2:12 or thereabouts if he would go
steadily.
There are a number of Dexter Princes
on the grounds and before the close of the
meeting they may ma.-j their presence
felt.
The following are the entries for to
day's races:
