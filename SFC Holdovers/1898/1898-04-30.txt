DEWEY'S FLEET ARRIVES
OFF THE HARBOR OF MANILA.
THE POWERFUL SPANISH FLEET WHICH LEFT CAPE VERDE
YESTERDAY.
SPAIN'S TORPEDO FLEET
LEAVES THE CAPE VERDE
ISLANDS AFTER MANY DAYS
The Strongest of the Ships Sail Westward, but
That May Be Only a Ruse to Give the
Americans a Scare.
ST. VINCENT, Cape VERDE ISLANDS, April 29. â The Spanish squadron, composed of four first
cias-- cruisers, three torpedo-destroyers, three tofpedo-tvr.ts and a transport ship and collier, which have
been in this harbor for some time, left this morning.
I am told that the Spanish admiral received sailing orders from Madrid late last night. These orders,
however, were sealed and will not be made known to the officers and crews of the ships until they are on
the high seas. It is asserted here by high authority that the reason for the departure of the squadron was
because of representations by the American Government to Lisbon.
There was great activity on board the Spanish fleet for the last day or two. Yesterday the pay
masters visited the city, paid all the bills and gave shopkeepers to understand that. they would soon lose
their Spanish customers.
Part of the fleet sailed out of the harbor by Washington Head at 7 o'clock. This force included two
of the cruisers and the torpedo-boat destroyers Furor, Terror and Pluton. About an hour later the other
two cruisers, followed by the torpedo-boats Ariete, Azor and Rayo, together with the transports Ciudad de
Cadiz and the armed collier San Francisco, left the harbor of St. Vincent.
In the meantime the first section of the squad dn, which had left the harbor, was waiting outside,
and upon the arrival of the second division signals were given from the flagship and the cruisers Viz
caya, Almirante Oquendo, Infanta Maria Teresa and Cristobal Colon, followed by the three torpedo-boat
destroyers, sailed in a westerly direction, presumably for Cuba or Porto Rico. The remainder of the
fleet, torpedo-boats and transport and collier, at once steamed in a northerly direction.
The torpedo-boats, with. the transport and collier, which steamed north, returned to port in a few
hours. The reason given was that one of the torpedo-boats had been slightly damaged in collision with
one of the fleet. The vessels are expected to start out again in a few hours.
Although the fleet divided and the powerful boats sailed west and other vessels sailed in a north
erly direction, toward the Canaries, 1 tmve it from a person in authority that all the vessels will ulti
mately go to the Canaries, where they will be joined by the battleship Pelayo and other warships now
cruising in the Mediterranean.
NEW YORK, April 29.â A Wash-
ington special to the Herald says:
Spain's fleet has sailed from Cape
Verde Islands in two divisions, one
of which, sailed north toward the Ca
nary Islands and the other went to
ward Porto Bico.
An unsigned dispatch reached the
State Department this afternoon an
nouncing that the first division, ap
parently bound for the Canaries, had
returned to St. Vincent on account of
a collision. It is believed by the
administration and naval officials
that this dispatch was instigated by
the Spanish authorities, and it is
therefore regarded with considerable
doubt.
Four armored cruisers â the Almir
ante Oquendo, the Vizcaya, the In
fanta Maria Teresa and the Cristobal
Colon, and three torpedo-boat de
stroyers, the Terror, Furor and Osado
â formed the division which sailed
westward.
The division which started north
consisted of three torpedo-boats â
Ariete, Azor and Rayo, the auxiliary
cruiser Ciudad de Cadiz and the Eng
lish collier, from which tne fleet
coaled before it sailed. It was this
division which was reported to have
suffered an accident and returned to
port.
The announcement of the depart
ure of the Spanish men-of-war
reached the State Department this
Morning, and it was confirmed by
private information received here. It
was this announcement which caused
the oflScials to look upon the message
subsequently received as of Spanish
origin.
Notwithstanding the report made
by the American Consul in the morn
ing that the fleet had sailed, the dis
patch this afternoon reiterated this

Official dispatches from Ad
miral Sampson received at the
Navy Department to-day tell,
briefly of the bombardment,
which the Herald so fully and

the return of the division composed
of the torpedo-boats on account of a
| collision. Had the message simply
stated that the torpedo-boats had re
j turned on account of a collision, even
had it been unsigned, the department
' might have put some faith in it, but
\ the reiteration of the news of the
! sailing of the fleet caused officials to
'. regard the information with suspi
| cion. The dispatch was probably ad
dressed to the department, but the
: absence of the Consul's name and the
'â  further fact that it was not in cipher
were regarded as significant indica
tion of the source of the message.
As the Spanish force has not been

reinforced by the battle-ship Pelayo,
the protected cruiser Alfonso XIII
and second torpedo-boat flotilla at
Cadiz, the authorities do not believe
that it will come west, despite the
fact that the armor-dads and de
stroyers sailed in the direction of
Porto Rico. It is generally be
lieved in naval circles that the ships
will proceed to the Canary Islands,
where they will await the arrival of
reinforcements from Spain and will
then come west.
In order that the authorities may
be advised without delay if the ves
sels are bound to Porto Rico, the St.
Louis or Harvard will be sent to the
eastward of Porto Rico to ascertain
the fleet's position, if bound for that
point, and when this information is
secured will hasten with all speed
to where the armored fleet of the
American Government will be in
waiting.
Considerable relief is expeuenced
in naval circles over the departure of
Spain's fleet from St. Vincent, for
the reason that the safety of the bat
tle-ship Oregon is now believed to be
assured. The accuracy of the Her
ald's cable advices is shown by the
fact that while the Navy Depart
ment learned yesterday that the tor
pedo gun vessel Temerario. belong
ing to the Spanish navy, had gone
to sea, the Herald announced this
morning that it had only gone to La
Plata. The arrival of the Temerario
at La Plata was confirmed by of
ficial advices received here to-day.
Secretary Long is now confident
that the Oregon and the gunboat
Marietta are safe, and expressed the
belief that the Oregon, even if at
tacked, could take care of at least
two armored cruisers before being
disposed of herself. As to the
Temerario, it is believed she is not
bent on the destruction of the Ore

PRIVATEERING AS
A LAST RESORT.
Spain Will not Issue Letters of
Marque Unless Her War
Fleets Are Destroyed.

MADRID, April 29.â 1 am Informed
on high authority that the Spanish
Government's reservation of its rights
to issue letters of marque d<.es not ne
cessarlly imply that she will have re
course to privateering. The Govern
ment, indeed, has no' intention at pres
ent of doing so. She has simply re
served the right should circumstances,
such as the destruction of the Spanish
fleet, compel her to take such a course.
The rumor current at Washington re
cently that Spain had offered Cuba to
Austria is absolutely without founda
tion. â¢
The eminent academician. Pierre
Loti, who has just arrived in ifcidrid,
is much annoyed about the absurd ru
mors current with regard to his inten
tion to offer his sword to Spain. Al
though he acknowledges his entire
sympathy as with Spain and the Queen
Regent, it Is all he can give, as his
service belongs to France. The facts
published in the Herald that he had
not asked permission of the French na
val authorities to offer his services to
Spain, which, as an officer on the ac
tive list, he would h*ve to do before
he could take any step of the sort,
sufficiently mark the baselessness of.
the reports current in Paris. He will
remain here about a week.
DECEPTION CREATES

m.\dRID, April 29.â A most notable j
change has taken place in public opin- I
ion within the" last couple of days. Be- J
fore the people were confident Spain j
would fight gallantly. NoV they are
confident that Spain will win.
The Correspondencia says to-night:
"Spain fears the conflict less and less
every day."
This really epitomizes the state of the
public mind. It is principally due to
the accounts received here from Amer
ican correspondents of Spanish papers.
These picture a sort of anarchy as
reigning in the United States. Naval
and military chiefs are shown as
changing their ideas every day about
the plan to be followed. They describe
the American ships as hopelessly mis
handled and the alleged encounter be
tween the Ligera and the Cushing be
comes a great Spanish victory. How
much truth there is in these reports it
is impossible to find out, as no others
are allowed to enUr.

HONGKONG, April p.â lt is denied that the Spanish fleet has left Manila to
meet the American squadron. On the contrary, it is asserted that the Spanish
warships will remain in Manila Bay to assist the forts.
It Is reported from Manila that the American warships have
been sighted, but the weather has been too stormy for the fleet
to communicate with the rebels.
The insurgent chief, Aguinaldo, is coming to Hongkong from Singapore. It is
| alleged that he absconded with half a million dollars paid by the Spanish Gov
ernment for the other insurgent leaders. All Manila telegrams are censored and mail
I communication with Hongkong has been suspended.
LONDON, April* â The Daily Mail hears from Singapore that a naval battle
is momentarily expected in Manila Bay.
A dispatch to the Daily Mail from Hongkong says : "Commodore Dewey con
siders that his duty will be done when the Spanish fleet is captured and safety has
ibeen secured for American trading vessels. Eleven of these vessels are overdue and
! the Americans feel exceedingly anxious.
"The formation of the Provisional Government at Manila will be announced at the
discretion of United States Consul Williams.
"It is believed that there are not many Spanish troops at Manila. They have gone
into the interior. The American fleet carries in all 2000 officers and men. The Concord is
expected here for dispatches on Wednesday."
The Daily Telegraph's Hongkong correspondent says the insurgent chief, Aguinaldo,
is preparing to make a descent near Manila. His supporters are plentifully supplied with
arms and ammunition from the American squadron.
MADRID, April 29.â The city is on the tiptoe of expectation for news of an en
gagement off the ' Philippines, which, it is felt, cannot be long delayed. Indeed, rumors
have teen current since about 5 o'clock that the fleets have already met, that the Span
iards have defeated the Americans and that three American vessels have been sunk.
No official information has been received yet, nor can the rumor be traced to its
foundation.
THE LITTLE FOOTE CHASED
TWO SPANISH GUNBOATS
INTO CARDENAS HARBOR
Copyrighted, IS9B, by James Gordon Bennett.
KEY WEST, April 29â The
torpedo-boat Foote, under com
mand of Lieutenant Rogers, had
an interesting, though net serious,
exchange cf compliments with t'vo
small Spanish gunboats last Sun
day, which was announced ex
clusively by the Herald.
Accounts brought in by the
officers of the Puritan, now here
coaling, say that the monitor
Terror lay some miles off Cardenas
Bay on Sunday afternoon at 3:30
o'clock. When the officers in the
messroom heard shots they ran on
deck and saw the torpedo-boat
Foote lying well in toward Car
denas.
About one and a half miles
nearer shore, close to the mouth
of the harbor, their glasses re
vealed two small Spanish gun bqats
sneaking along, hugging the coi.st.
Lieutenant Rogers had seen them,
and, as he afterward explained to
the Terror's officers, he decided to
have iome fun with them, though
the range was rather long for
serious execution.
The Foote opened fire with one
pounder guns and Lieutenant
Qualtrough of the Terroi thinks
one of the Spaniards was bit by
one shot, but he is not certain.
Both the Spanish gunboats re
turned the Foote's fire without
hesitation. Lieutenant Rogers
then steamed toward them, firing
as he advanced. The Spaniards
replied with a few more shots, all
of which went wide of their mark.
Then, apparently not liking the
Foote's rapid advance, they turned
and steamed back into Cardenas
harbor.
Knowing the harbor to be mined,
and that both the Spanish vessels
carried heavier guns than his own,
Lieutenant Rogers refused to fol
low them inside the harbor and re
turned to his post.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
It was the topedo-boat Foote at
which the first shots were fired
recently from Matanzas' three bat
teries.
One of the Spanish gunboats
with which the Foote exchanged
shots is believed to have been the
Nigero.
The above is a true version of
the occurrence, and differs ma
terially from the description given
by General Blanco. Blanco's
Madrid version of the same en
counter says that the Spanish gun
boat Nigero repulsed three United
States torpedo-boat destroyers
which tried to enter the port of
Cardenas and compelled them to
retreat.

TORPEDO BOATS
flssistaQt Secretary Roosevelt
MaKes tfye Recommendation.
Contracts Will Be Made.
NEW YORK, April 29.â A Washington special to the Herald says:
Assistant Secretary Roosevelt made a recommendation to Secretary
Long to-day that a contract be made for 100 new torpedo boats.
Since the beginning of the present difficulty with Spain the fact has
been most apparent that the United States navy is greatly in need of
torpedo boats, and every effort has been made by this Government to
purchase from abroad a few of this style of craft, but with little suc
cess.
Chief Constructor Hichborn and Engineer-in-Chief Melville recom
mended some time ago that the Government make contracts for at
least 100 boats, but until to-day no action was taken. It is understood
that the torpedo boats specified in Roosevelt's recommendation are
of tho smaller class and are to be used exclusively for harbor defense.
The proposition will be received with much favor by war ofliclals,
and in all probability contracts for their construction will be made with
in a few days. By having several shipbuilding companies divide the
work it is estimated that all of the boats can be ready for active ser
vice within three months.
Lieutenant Commander Charles A. Adams, who was recently court
martialed and found gui> .- of conduct unbecoming an officer In the
navy, was sentenced to three months' suspension to-day.

Epecln.l Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, April 29.â The Liberal
leader. Sir William Vernon Harcourt,
arraigned the weak policy of the Mar
quis of Salisbury in the far East, in
the House of Commons to-day, point
ing out the collapse of his "open door"
policy, through Germany obtaining
preferential privileges on the Shan
Tung peninsula, while Great Britain,
he added, had made an undignified re
treat in the Talien Wan affair. Ger
many and Russia, the speaker contend
ed, had both scored at the expense of
Great Britain.
The Liberal leader was listened to
by a full house and great interest is
attached to the debate in view of the
intense dissatisfaction felt at the Gov
ernment's policy among its own fol
lowers and by the conservative news
papers.
In reply to Sir William Vernon Har
court, Mr. Balfour First Lord of the
Treasury, Government leader in the
House and Acting _ ore : -n Secretary,
denied that there had been a violation
of the treaty of Tientsin. *" claimed
that throughout the length and breadth
of China Britishers had equal rights
with other nations. England, he de
clared, took Wei-Hai-Wei for military
and diplomatic reasons, and quite with
out reference to considerations of
trade and commerce. He laid stress
upon the distinction between the
spheres of interest and of influence.
Trade and commercial interests in
the province of Shan-Tung were not
the considerations, Mr. Balfour con
tinued, which controlled the Govern
ment in taking Wei-Hai-Wei; nor was
the question of the permanent occu
pation of Kiao-chau by Germany a de
termining factor. Hence he failed to

George E. Bell of Chicago is the judge engaged by the San Fran

Canada. His appointment has met with universal approbation
throughout the Eastern States. He is also one of the most successful

diplomatically at Peking in times of
peace and strategically in times of
war."
The Government would not have
been justified in going to war over Port
Arthur, the occupation of which by the
British would have been a defiance to
Russia, whereas the occupation of Wei-
Hai-Wet by the British could be no hu
miliation to Russia and would not af

relations. Mr. Balfour contended that
Russia, in-tead of being in a better,
was in a worse position than she was

Special Dlsjiatch to The Call.
LONDON, April 30.â The departure of
the Spanish fleet from the Cape Verde
Islands is regarded as the first really
important news of the war. No fur
ther information has been received here
as to its destination, but it is consid
ered not unlikely that it will go to the
Canary Islands to await i nforce
ments from Cadiz, without which it is
considered a hopeless task to attempt
to attack Rear-Admiral Sampson's
ileet. It is also supposed that it may
attempt to intercept the American
cruiser Oreeon.
The idea that it will attempt to bom
bard the United States coast cities is
not seriously regarded here. No fur
ther actual news has reached London,
where the immediate fact of interest is
the expected naval battle in the Philip
pines.
The story that only a mule was killed
at Matanzas during the bombardment
of the forts there â '-nishes a text for
many humorous remarks in the papers
this morning. The Russian official dis
patches during the war of the Crimea

CHICKAMAUGA NATIONAL PARK
(Oa.), April 29.â This has been a hust

Chickamauga Park. In pursuance of
orders issued yesterday the light bat
teries in camp were ordered at once to
Tampa, and the entire day has been
taken up in getting the men, horses
and guns aboard the cars. Trains bear
ing these men and their equipments
have been given the right of way, and it
Is expected they will arrive at Tampa
early 'i-morrow morning. The
Twenty-fourth Infantry is under orders
to ir.ove, and will break camp in the
morning.
The Ninth Cavalry received perem
tory orders to-night to move at once,
and the men are packing up to-night.
It is stated that they will march to this
city and take the train here to-morrow
morning.
It was learned to-night that orders
would be issued to-morrow for the re-
I moral to Tampa of the Twenty-fifth
| Infantry and the Tenth Cavalry, and a
| semi-official rumor is current to-night
to the effect that the Second Cavalry
and the Seventh Infantry will go early
next week. None of these commands
have been filled to the war strength,
very few enlistments having been made
up to this time.
The Sixtenth Infantry, which arrived
to-day, was assigned to the First Bri

MOBILE. April 29.â The Tenth and
Twenty-second regiments left camp
here late this afternoon, bound for
j Tampa. They were all day getting out
I fmm camp, beginning after drill at 10
o'clock. When, at noon, the Twenty
second, the famous Arizona Indian
fighters, came marching down to the
depot, a large crowd of citizens and
several soldiers were gathered there,
and the members nf the Tenth Regi
ment were also on hand, ready for em
barkation for Tampa. When the Twen

Colonel Wickoff in the lead, and the

of enthusiasm aa had never before
been heard here. Everybody joined In

lowed cheer, hats flew in the air, and
it was altogether a stirring scene.
There was a long wait foT the train
j to start, even after the baggage had
been placed on board the cars, which
took a couple of hours. Meantime, the
first good soaking rain of the encamp
ment set in, and the enthusiasm had
to be postponed for a while, the sol

The announcement that the United
States will adhere to the principles of
the treaty of Paris is an expression of
a genuine desire to conform to the more
humane views of warfare accepted by
the powers. The very sympathy for the
United States felt by Great Britain can
not but be strengthened, especially
among the commercial community, by the
sense of relief thus afforded.â London

The idea of ridding Cuba of Spaniards
has been threatened by American states

merit of acting upon it, wfth all its tre

is a meritâ belongs to President Me Kin

cannot be doubted in England, and every
voice is raised to wish the United States
success.â London Graphic.
So the nation welcomes the inevitable
conflict without fear and without un
seemly rejoicing. It has no doubt as
to the outcome, for that would be not
only to doubt its own vitality, but the
justice of Providence toward an effort
to defend the helpless and to rescue the
suffering.â Pittsburg Dispatch.
The United States sends her armies
forth to war with Spain for righteous
reasons, and in unclouded honor and with
a clear conscience. They go to stay the

remove a dangerous menace to the peace

of its compensations, that it will mako

has been known since the ante-bellum
days of our wooden shipbuilding suprem

GENERALS MEET
AND CONSIDER
THE INVASION
Alger, Corbir), Shafter ar)d Lee
Con)plete Plciqs for Larjding
ar; Army in Cuba.
NEW YORK, April 29.â The Herald's Washington correspondent
telegraphs: United otates troops will leave Tampa for an invasion
of Cuba within the next few days.
Orders were issued by the War Department to troops mobilized
at southern points to be ready to start in a moment's notice, and by
this evening, I am told, several regiments and troops of cavalry w..l
be on the move toward Tampa.
General Lee has returned to Washington and was at the war
and navy departments to-day. He had long conferences with Adju
tant-General Corbin, Secretar Alger and General Shafter in regard to
the general plan of campaign, as exclusively stated in this morning's
Herald. General Lee was exceedingly careful in talking over the
coming invasion of Cuba, but expressed himself as not in the least sur
prised at the ease with which Admiral Sampson's fleet had demolished
the fortification . at Matanzas. These fortifications, he said, were
principally made of sandstone, as are also many of those at Havana.
He did not seem to think that the capture of the Cuban capital would
be a very difficult task.
In anticipation of the invasion of Cuba in the coming week, the
War Department is sending to Tampa large quantities of supplies to
be used by the invading army. Stone buildings are now in course of
erection at Tampa, to be used as cold storage f ~ rations for the army.
It is understod that while the army is In Cuba the necessary supplies
will be shipped daily from Tampa and carried directly to some sea
port nearest headquarters to the United States army. In this way
troops will receive fresh provisions every day, which will be a great
factor in warding off sickness.
Preparations for enlisting ""0,000 Immunes are progressing rapidly
and all indications show that the entire quota will be made Inside of
a few weeks. The President had a consultation to-day with General
Meyers of Louisiana in regard to these troops, and final arrangements
were made for raising the army.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. April 30.â The great
American line steamship Paris,
rechristened the Yale, was sighted east
of Fire. Island at 47 minutes * past 2
o'clock this morning. The Paris will |
reach quarantine about half-past 7 j
o'clock. This will bring her up to the I
slip some time between 9 and 10, just
in time for her commander, Captain
Watkins, to hear the cheers from the
crowded ferry boats that will be sure
and greet his ship when she comes to
her landing.
The Paris brings 160 passengerÃ and
guns and ammunition for the Govern
ment. She left Southampton under
hurry orders, -aptain Watkins knew r
before putting to sea that war was on
and he was cautioned to keep a sharp
lookout for Spanish warships. It was
rumored that the Paris had been cap
tured by a torpedo-boat in the English
Channel and another report had it that
she had put into an English port to
elude a hostile craft. Neither of these
rumors had tho slightest foundation.
To Captain Watkins' discretion was
left the course the Paris would take.
Custom-house brokers are preparing
to give Captain Watkins a rousing re
ccjtion when he goes to the Custom
house to enter his manifest. The in
terior of the big rotunda is gayly deco
rated with flags and bunting.

WISEMAN'S STUDENT LIFE.
The student life which Wiseman led for
four years was one of great regularity
and of strict discipline. The English col
legeâalthough less exacting in its regu
lations than some of the Italian collegesâ
preserves a measure of Continental se
verity. The students rose at 5:30. Half
an hour's meditation was followed by
mass and breakfast. Every day. except
Thursday and Sunday, lectures were at
tended on philosophy, theology, canon !
law, church history, biblical exogesis, as !
the case might be, and the rest of the
morning was devotod to study. The mid- i
aay dinner was preceded by the daily !
"examination of conscience." After din- \
ncr came a visit to the Blessed Sacra
ment, and. a little later, the siesta. A
space in the afternoon was allotted to a
walk through the city, either to some ob
ject of interest â a church or a museum â
or to one of the Palazzos, or to. Monte
Pincio, where friends would meet the
collegians and exchange greetings or con
verso.
Nearly all the collegesâ and among them
the Englishâ would take their walk in
camerataâ that is to say, the students |
walking two abreast, in double file. Out- i
side the city or on Monte Pincio this or- |
der was relaxed for the time and students
might disperse, reassembling for their re
turn homo. The bell toward sunset for
the Aye Maria would summon the cam
erata back to college, and the rest of the i
day was spent chiefly in study and I
prayer. On Thursday, the weekly holi- i
day, expeditions were often made beyond !
the city walls to places of interest. The
Easter vacation and the long summer
holiday wero spent at the country house '
belonging to the college at Monte Porzio, I
near Tusculum. Here the discipline was
somewhat less strict, but was still a life ;
of great regularity, and passed under !
community rule. The day, both in Rome
and at Monte Porzio, was brought to a j

Special Dispatch to The Call. o
Call Office, Riggs House,
>v Washington, April 29.
Before the setting of another sun the
most experienced naval c "cers believe
a sea fight will have passed into his
tory, compared with which the great
battle of the Yalu will seem a veritable
tempest in a teapot. Following his in
structions as to speed and steaming at
the most economical rate of coal con
sumption Admiral Dewey's Asiatic
squadron, barring accidents, will arrive
off the harbor of Manila early Satur
day mornii.j. There it is expected he
will be i et by the Spanish Philippine
squadron â met but not rr.atched, for
the doughty American commander, who
is rated as one of the pluckiest men in
the service, will have at h s disposal a
fleet that far outclasses his adversaries.
Provided the Spanish ships reported to
be in Asiatic waters can "> concen
trated off the Philippines Dewey's force
will be one and one-half times as
great, estimated on the basis of the
weight of metal his guns can throw.
Considering rel.tive marksmanship the
American fleet ought not to leave a
Spanish vessel afloat.
The possibility of a bombardment of
Manila depends to some extent upon
the action of the Spanish fleet. Dewey's
orders are similar to those of Sampson
in one important particular, namely,
that no risk of disabling one of his ves
sels is to be taken in bombarding any
port in advance of a battle with the
Spanish* squadron. Once this squadron
is disposed of attention may be given to
reducing and occupying the city of Ma
nila.
But while Dewey is busy Sampson is
not idle. The Navy Department has re
ceived advices through commercial
sources of the highest reliability that
Captain General Blanco has been as
sured by the Spanish Government that
he will be relieved by a powerful naval
force before his condition is rendered
desperate by the blockade of the Ameri
can fleet. The department does not
doubt tfiat thn means that the- Cape
Verde squadrr.n, which left St. Vincent
to-day, will ultimately reach Cuban
waters and seek to unite with LUe Span
ish vessels in and out of the harbor of
Havana.
Whether one or more vessels will be
sent south to intercept the Oregon and
Marietta is a mere conjecture at this
writing. It is considered unlikely for
two reasons; first, because the largest
possible fleet will be needed in Cuban
j waters if Sampson's squadron is to be
I challenged, and, second, because no two
! vessels in the Cape Verde fleet are a
' match for the Oregon, which is one oÂ£
our most powerful battle-ships, to say
nothing of the aid to be rendered by
her gallant little consort, the Marietta.
But while a naval battle in Cuban
waters now seems imminent, the War
| Department is not abating its activity
! in preparing for the invasion of the
! island. With a few exceptions regular
troops only will go. and so far as pos
sible immunes not liable to yellow fever
will be chosen. General Shafter will
lead them, and they will be landed at a
â¢point not yet mentioned and which, for
obvious reasons, will not be announced
in advance of the sailing of the trans
ports. The regulars will start within
a week unless something unforeseen oc
curs to modify the Navy Department's
plans. From a base of supplies arms
and ammunition will be furnished the
insurgents, food distributed to the
starving Cubans/and a line of commu
nication with the rebel army kept open.
One by one the batteries on the north
coast of the island will be demolished
by Admiral Sampson's fleet, and the
joint movement will gradually concen
trate upon Havana, the capitulation of
which is as certain as if the pride of the
Pearl of the Antilles already lay in
ruins.
SPAIN'S SEA - FIGHTERS ARE
INFERIOR.
Since the battle of L,epanto ln 1571.
when the Spanish and Venetians together
fought the Turks and won after a long
and bloody contest, Spain has not won v
notable victory on the sea. Her naval
prowess has steadily declined, and to-day
few of the little South American repub
lics, who were her former colonies, would
confess that they were afraid ol hsr.
The last naval battle fought by Spain
In the New World showed conclusively
how her maritime power has decreased.
She was defeated by Peru, with Chile's
aid, and since then the Spaniard har3 kept
away from the Pacific coast of South
America.
The story of that war and its disastrous
results to Spain is told in the Army and
Navy Journal. In 1864 Spain sent a squ.id
ron of seven vessels, mounting 211 guns,
to punish the Peruvians for the maltreat
ment of Spanish subjects. The Peruvians
had nothing on the water with which tc
oppose this force, but Chile came to her
aid with three vesselsâ the Esmeralda,
carrying forty-two smoothbores; the Vic
toria, a small one-gun monitor, and the
Loa, a diminutive Merrimac, plated with
Iron and mounting two sixty-eight-pound
ers. The Esmeralda met the Spanish
gunboat Cavandago (three guns) and cap
tured her in twenty minutes without the
loss of a man. The Spaniards fired only
three shots. They had two men killed
and fourteen wounded. The loss of the
Cavandago, followed by the capture of '
an armored launch, so chagrined the !
Spanish admiral. Pareja, that he blew out '
his brains in his cabin.
Admiral Nunez, who succeeded Pareja,
then gallantly assailed the defenseless
Valparaiso, where not a single gun was
mounted except a few saluting pieces.
Not a shot was fired from the town and
the Inhabitants promptly evacuated it.
This Spanish admiral, in spite of the pro
tests of the foreign rrfen-of-war in the
harbor, threw from 2000 to 3000 shells into
it from his fleet of six vessels. The
Spanish gunnery was so wretched that
little damage was done, except by flre,
which destroyed 110.000,000 worth of neu
tral goods. It was a most wanton piece
of barbarity, for if the Spaniards had
had a landing force they could have taken
the town without tiring a shot.
The gallant Nunez next assaulted the
city of Callao, which taught him the dif
ference between an open town and one
that was adequately defended. In four
or five hours the Spanish squadron was
badly used up and was glad to crawl back
to Spain as best it could in its crippled
condition. The Villa ffia Madrid, fifty-six
guns, got a shot in her steam chest and
was towed out of action; the Berenguela,
thirty-six guns, had a hole twenty feet
square knocked into her near the water
line by an exploding shell and crawled out.
of range to repair damages.
r lhe ammunition in two other Spanish
vessels gave out after a two hours' fight,
and they had to retire, one of them hav
ing been twice on flre in the neighborhood
of the magazine. This left two vessels,
the Numancia, ironclad, and tho Alman
za. Two hours later these two, vessels
ceased their fire and withdrew, the Chile
ans firing at them until they were be
yond range. The Spanish loss is not ex
actly known, but is supposed to have
been about 200. Commodore Rodgers, ,
D. S. N.; estimated the loss of the Chile
ans at eighty, though others give a larger
number. No aetioas damage was done to
either ships or forts l>y the tire beyond
that earned. The Spaniards then with
drew discomfited from the Pacific, being
short of stores and ammunition and with
their vessels foul for want of docking.
They ha.l established a base at the Chin
cha Islands, but they had no facilities for
repair.
Spain has shared in the movement of
naval progress and is far more formid
able in ships and guns than she was in
1884, but not relatively. We have no rea
son to suppose that her sailors are better,
though ii may he that the use of range
flndera may improve their gunnery. Still
the personnel factor will tell, and that is
always in favor of the American. The
Spaniard has never distinguished himself
on the sea, where the personal equation
is so important.
THE DECLARATION OF INDEPEND
ENCE.
The declaration is divided into two
parts: First, the statement of certain
genera] principles of the rights of men
and peoples; and, second, an attack on
George 111 as a tyrant, setting forth in a
series of propositions the wrongs done
by him to the Americans which justified
them in rebellion. Criticism has been di
rected first against the attack on the
King, then to the originality of the doc
trines enunciated, then against the state
ment of the rights of man,- Jefferson's
"self-evident truths," and finally against
the style.
The latest criticism is easily disposed
of. Year after year, for more than a cen
tury, the Declaration of Independence
has been solemnly read in every city,
town and hamlet in the United States to
thousands of Americans, who have heard
it over and over again, and who listen to
it in reverent silence and rejoice that it
is theirs to read. If it hail been badly
written the most robust patriotism would
in- Incapable of this habit. False rhetoric
or turgid sentences would have been their
own death warrant, and the pervading
American sense of humor would have
seen to its execution. The mere fact that
Jefferson's words have stood successfully
this endless repetition is infallible proof
that the declaration has the true and
high literary quality which alone could
have preserved through such trials its
lmpresÃivenesa and Its savor. To those
who will study the declaration carefully
from the literary side it is soon apparent
that the English is fine, trie tone noble
and dignified, and the style strong, clear
and imposing.â Senator H. C. Lodge in
March Seribner's.

FLEET TO
ASSEMBLE
Vessels to Be Selected to
Stand Off the Span=
ish Ships.
There Will Probably Be an Im=
mediate Junction of the Best
Craft in the Commands of
Sampson and Schley.
NEW YORK, April 29â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
sends the following: Immediately fol
lowing the receipt of the official infor
mation announcing the departure of the
Spanish fleet from St. Vincent sailing
orders were issued to the flying squad
ron, under command of Commodore
Schley. â  These orders are the result of a
discussion by the Naval War Board of
the strategical considerations entering
into the departure of the Spanish men
of-war.
Naturally the greatest secrecy is ob
served as to the destination of the fly
ing squadron, but it is generally con
ceded by naval experts having knowl
edge of the plans of the board that the
probabilities point to an immediate
junction of t!. armored vessels under
Commodore Schley and those com
manded by Rear-Admiral Sampson, and
the placing of this formidable force at
a central position where they can
promptly resist any attack made by the
Spanish fleet either upon the American
or upon the blockading squadron
surrounding Cuban ports.
In addition to the orders to Commo
dore Schley's command, I learned to
day that telegraphic instructions have
been sent to Cramps to hasten the com
pletion of the American line steamer
St. Paul, and she will probably be ready
for sea to-morrow. Tte St. Louis and
Xcw York or Harvard are at Tomo
kinsville, and the St. Louis will be sent
at once on scouting duty. The Paris
(or Yale 1. which is expected momen
tarily at Nejf York, will be supplied
with only four six-pounders, as were
the St. Louis and the New York, and
be sent to sea also act as a scout.
In determining the formation of a
squadron composed entirely of ar
mored craft the department has been in
fluenced by a desire to have at hand a
force which could be depended on to de
feat any fleet which might be sent to this
side of the Atlantic by Spain. For some
days past, as the Herald has stated, the
War Board has been carefully consider
ing the advisability of forming this
squadron, and it needed but the depar
ture of the Spanish ships to cause the
necessity of such action to appear press
ing.
Commodore Schley's fleet, as at pres
ent constituted, is not sufficiently strong
to meet the Spanish vessels, even the
first division, composing four armored
cruisers and three torpedo boat destroy
ers. Two of his ships, the Minneapolis
and Columbia, are on scouting duty
and under orders to pick up any Span
ish merchantman which they might hap
pen to meet. Commodore Sthley, there
fore, has at Hampton Roads only the
armored cruiser Brooklyn Cthe flag
ship), the first class battle-ship Massa
chusetts and the second class battle-ship
Texas. Under Rear-Admiral Samp
son's command are the armored cruiser
Ifew York (the flagship), and the first
class battle-ships lowa and Indiana.
The junction of these vessels with
those of Commodore Schley's force will
place under Rear-Admiral Sampson's
command four first class battle-ships,
one second class battle-ship and two ar
mored cruisers. Commodore Schley
would retain command of his force as
a division under Rear-Admiral Samp
son.
In withdrawing armor-clad.; from the
Cuban blockade the force on that duty
while it would be greatly weakened
would still be of ample strength to de
stroy Spanish vessels in various ports
and enforce the blockade as strictly as
it is now maintained. It will be poss
ible to retain on blockading duty all
the protected cruisers, gunboats, con
verted gunboats, etc., now in Cuban
waters, and these vessels would still be
superior to those of Spain there. It is
therefore considered practically, feasible
and desirable by the naval experts that
an armored fleet should be formed at
once, in view of the fact that it is not at
all certain where the Spanish fleet is
bound. It is appreciated at the depart
ment that when the armored fleet is
finally assembled it will be desirable
to attach to it a number of sea-going
boats to act as patrol boats and prevent
Spanish torpedo boat destroyers and
Spanish torpedo boats from attempting
to sneak in on the vessels at night on
hostile errands. The Scorpion, for
merly the Sovereign, which is now at
Hampton Road-, with the flying squad
ron, will be one of the vessels detailed
to this duty.
As to the point where the armor-clads
will be stationed, nothing can be learn
ed, but it will undoubtedly be in south
ern waters, so that they can be equally
convenient to Cuba and Porto Rico and
Â£u N ,Â° rt ! iern POmtS Of this country.
While they are stationed at that point
six vessels, which will be engaged on
scouung duty, will be steaming about
the seas endeavoring to obtai.. informa
tion concerning the whereabouts of the
Spanish fleet. The Minneapolis and
Columbia will probably be retained in
northern waters,, while the St. Paul, St.
Louis. New York and Paris will be
sent to the Canaries and possibly near
the coast of Spain to ascertain the po
sition of Spanish men-of-war. Recog-
BATTLE=SHIP INDIANA, Reported by Blanco to Have Run Aground.
nizing the possibility of the Spanish fleet
proceeding to Porto Rico, it can be
pretty definitely stated that one of the
American liners, either the St. Louis or
New York, will be sent to that neigh
borhood with instructions to report to
the department or Rear-Admiral Samp
son the appearance of any Spanish *hip.
The St. Paul, which is armored and can
therefore successfully meet any of the
auxiliary cruisers of Spain, will prob
ably be sent over toward the Canaries,
and the Paris and either the St. Louis
or New York will probably ioin her in
scouting the seas in that vicinity.
Under instructions which will be
given the commanding officers of these
scouts it is expected that they will ob
tain information not alone by sighting
the enemy itself, but by speaking neutral
merchantmen when they may chance to
meet. As the American liners have an
extremely large coal capacity it will be
possible for them to remain at sea for
quite a long time, and to report to the
department when they secure any in
formation. By this m^ans the Spanish
authorities will be kept in a state of
anxiety and suspense, not knowing but
that the vessels may be under orders to
capture merchantmen plying along their
own coast. It is not going too far to
say that the American liners will pick up
any Spanish merchant vessels which
they may run across.
ROUGH RIDERS TO
ROUND UP THE DONS.
Arizona's Quota of Cowboy Riflemen
Leaves for Whipple Bar
racks.
BISBEE. * Hz.. April 29.â The Cochise
County quota for the Arizona cowboy
cavalry left for Whipple Barracks this
afternoon. It consisted of seventeen
cowboys from this vicinity â rough
riders and fine shots. One of the men
at a practice ride and shoot got his
mustang to bucking. The horse bucked
the bridle off and broke both cinches
off the saddle, and the rider put three
bullets into a tomato can fifty feet off
while his animal was doing the turn.
The horse was unable to throw him.
This is a sample of the material com
posing this cavalry. Large crowds
were at the depot to bid them fere
well. This cavalry is picked for duty
at the front in Cuba, and will leave
for New Orleans on Monday or Tues
day under command of Major Alex O.
Brodie to help round up the Spanish

CHATTANOOGA, Term., April 29.â
General Brooke, in an address to the

night, called attention to the short
sighted policy of the Government in
! not maintaining a larger standing
j army, stating that the army was now

1 that the delay in invading Cuba was
! due to the unpreparedness of the army,
i occasioned by the lack of necessary
legislative provision.

Cuba.

Tells Spain's Parliament That

Take the Offensive.
Could Have Kept His Promise
Have 50,000 Veterans to Attack

Eperlal Dispatch to The Call.
MADRID. April 29.â 1n the Cortes to
day General "Weyler, in a clear voice
and amid marked attention from the
whole house and the galleries, apolo-
gized for prolonging the debate, plead
ing that he could not allow the oppor
tunity to pass of defending himself
against criticism. With much warmth
and sternness he defended his political
and military acts of severity in Cuba,
showing that he deemed them virtually
necessary and that they were justified
by the results they produced. So much
was this the case, he declared that
had he been allowed six months longer
he would have entirely crushed the in
surrection and would have realized the
promise he made to Senor Canovas del
Castillo that by April. IS9S. he would
be in a position to offer him 50,000 vete
rans to attack the United States.
General Weyler severely criticized the
home rule policy in Cuba and the time
selected for decreeing it, and he con
cluded a passionate appeal for a dis
play of energy, urging the G .vernment
to take the offensive vigorously on both
land and sea, as remaining on the de
fensive was "the worst possible policy
with such an enemy."
The Duke of Tetuan and Lieutenant
General Azrarrage declared that the
Conservative party always approved
and accepted the responsibility for the
a.ts of General Weyler in Cuba. These
declarations afforded Senor Moret, Sec
retary for the Colonies, an opportunity
of avoiding a debate with Weyler. Se
nor Moret declaring that such a course
would be unadvisable at present and
would better be left for "a day when
statesmen can find time for "discus
sion."

Should the two warships put in here
they will be allowed to remain twenty

HEAVY FIRING
HEARD IN THE
BAY OF FUNDY
No Warships Known to Be
There, Yet It Gives Down
East Men a Scare.
EASTPORT, Me., April 29.â Intense excitement was caused here
between 5:30 and 6 o'clock by the boom of heavy suns off Quoddy
Head. The reports were plainly heard here and the firing was evi
dently heavy and rapid. All sorts of reports are flying about the city
to-night, but it is generally believed that tlie cruiser Minneapolis has
taken part in an engagement.
The Minneapolis left Machias, Me., at 2:30 o'clock this afternoon
bound west. The reports to-night came from the direction sh.ps would
take in ajid out of St. Johns, which would be the course al .g which
the cruiser would proL bly steam if coming from Machias.
Rumors of the presence of Spanish gunboats in Fundy Bay,
coupled with the mysterious movements in these waters of the cruiser
were held to account for the visit of the Minneapolis and many fancied
that a Spaniard and the cruiser had met.
Another theory was that the Spanish gunboat was after American
merchant vessels. The weather is very thick outside and nobody could
see far enough to gain any idea of the cause for the shooting.
NEW YORK, April 29.â A Halifax, N. S., special to the Herald
says: There is no news whatever in this city of firing in the Bay of
Fundy. It is utterly impossible that any Spanish gunboat could reach
that bay, which is practically an inland pea, bounded by the coasts of
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, without the fact becoming well
known. There is no record of a Spanish gunboat ever entering the
Bay of Fundy. American vessels in that water are infrequently seen,
and so far as known there has not been a vessel flying the American
flag in the bay for months. There is none such there now.
on board the United States monitor
Puritan. The rumors arose from the
strange action of a fireman, with a
Spanish soundins- name, now under re
straint on the warship because of his
eccentricities. The officers of the Puri
tan declare there is no thought of try
ing the man by court-martial, and that
all the talk about treason is absurd.
It appears that a few days ago the
man in questitn was seen in one of the
monitor's turrets, and the man who
saw him reported that he had his hand
on the lock of the magazine, whereupon
the fireman was placed under restraint.
The crew of the monitor became ex
cited, and dccl. red there was a Spanish
spy on board. Through this the ex
travagant stories were concocted.
The officers of the Puritan believe the
man is a Cuban, and they assert posi
tively that he has never given evidence
of any sort of sympathy with Spain,
but they add, on the contrary, that
when the Puritan was off Matanzas,
the man was frequently heard to say
he would like to get ashore and join
the insurgents.
The action of the officers of the moni
tor in placing the man under restraint
was guided solely by the danger of al
lowing an unevenly balanced man to
be at large;

their country's consuls and agents at
Havana for the departure of foreign of
ficials and colonies as soon as there is
any indication of bombardment or any
other move that will imperil the lives
of foreigners residing in Havana. A

Special cable to the Herald from a
Spanish source:
HAVANA, April 29. â A squadron,
made up of three armored ships and
three small ones, attacked Matanzas
day before yesterday afternoon, firing
seventy-two shots. The city did not
suffer any damage nor was any person
wounded. Some shells fell into the city,
but none exploded.
After a few shots had been fired by
the squadron all the city was filled with
bands marching through the streets,
playing national and Cuban airs. They
were applauded by the people, who
hoisted flags and cried "Viva Espana!
Here come the northern barbarians!"
Women enthusiastically waved hand
kerchiefs and fans, and men and wo
men ran to behold the spectacle of a
bombardment, shouting "Fire your
shells! You can't kill anybody."
The batteries of the city answered
by firing their guns. Foreign Consuls
protested because the bombardment
had been begun without previous an
nouncement. The Consuls of Austria
and France have made a formal pro
test.
The city of Havana remains abso
lutely quiet, cave for bands playing
at Central Park. Every street is gay
ly bedecked with banners.
During the day the American fleet
off the coast draws an immense crowd,
who look at it with spy glasses and
opera glasses. They comment on the
blockade as sport. Havana beach has
these last few days been converted into
a promenade. A man with a large
telescope on a tripod offers a sight of
the fleet for 5 cents.
The rebel brigadier, Masco Parra, has

Bays that article 3, which permits
belligerents to make a short stop at
Portuguese ports, probably will be bet
ter understood by saying that belliger
ents will not be permitted to make long
etays at Portuguese ports. Under the
usual rules of international law the
stay is likely to be confined to a day or
two. In this connection the Minister
drew attention to the privileges per
mitted when warships of both belliger
ent nations were at the same port. In
that case, if the warship of one power
leaves port, the warship of the other
power cannot leave in pursuit within
twenty-four hours, that much time be
ing allowed the ship first departing to
go on her way without molestation.
Portugal has been very insistent
upon this particular rule, and notable
Instances of it occurred when the fa

was at Lisbon during the Civil War. A
United States ship entered Lisbon har

the Alabama immediately withdrew.

and were prepared to make armed re
sistance to the departure of the second

full twenty-four hours' start. It
turned out that the Northern ship had

again be observed in the present con

Boston is the first city in the country
to make such a move as this in the i
present crisis. There are about 1200
prisoners at Deer Island. In spite of i
all the efforts that are being made to i
prevent such a thing, it is feared that
the transfer of so many prisoners of !
such a character cannot be accom- i
plished without great danger of riot
ous outbreaks, attempted rescues and
escapes. The very fact of this danger
is evidence that the city officials axe
deeply impressed with the probability
of the threatened Spanish naval attack !
on Boston. If they were not so they j
would never take the risks necessary
for such a step as this.
It is not known just where the pris
oners will be placed, but it is certain
that they will be taken well into the i
suburbs or the heart of the city, so as '
to be well removed from the reach of |
the enemy's guns. As many as can be j
possibly accommodated at the Reform- '
atory at Concord will be taken there. I
That is a State institution and is well
filled. Serious outbreaks are expected,
as there is absolutely no place where
the prisoners can be properly accom
modated, as every jail and prison for
miles about is crowded to the very
doors. They will have to be divided
and scattered in different places.
There is a panic at Deer Island, pris

understood that the German Embassa
d'>r will also receive instructions on the

structions is not disclosed, but they,
doubtless, relate to joint representa
tions against the severity of the new
tonnage tax.
Leading diplomats are hopeful that
their representations will lead to a
modification of the clause, otherwise
they feel that the tonnage duties will
be co burdensome on British, French
and Gorman slapping as to cause it to
seek Canadian and Mexican ports.
Aside from the expected official repre

the shipping interests of London,
Havre and Bremen and other ports are
supplementing the diplomatic negotia

against the increased tonnage taxes.
The republic of Hayti is expected to
maintain strict neutrality as between
th â  United States and Spain, and it is
understood that reports of exceptional
privileges given to the United States
warships in llaytian waters are erro
neous. The Haytian Minister, Mr. Le
Gare, Baid to-day that he had received
n official instructions concerning neu
trality, but he had no doubt an atti
tude of impartial neutrality will be
maintained. It is recognized among
officials here that all the sympathies of
Hayti are with the United States, and
yet any action by that country incon
sistent with strict neutrality would
place Hayti in the attitude of bein~ an
ally of the United States and an open
enemy of Spain. Mr. Le Gare had
noticed the published quotations from
the treaty between the United States
and Hayti which, it is asserted, gave
exceptional privileges to the United
States in that our warships were given
the right to take coal and supplies in
Haytian ports. The Minister made a
careful examination of his official text
of the treaty, and was unable to locate
any such exceptional privilege. The
treaty was made during the civil war,
and contains many provisions relative
to ships of war. But Mr. Le Gare's
reading of them does not disclose any
provision which is inconsistent with
impartiality in a neutral attitude be
twen Spain and the I'nited States.

Reference to Cuba.
Completing Details to Trans
port Regulars to Co-operate
With the Insurgents-
Shafter Leaves Washington for New
Orleans, From Which Placa Ho
Will Lead thÂ« Invasion.
Special Dispatch to The Cat!.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, April 29.
General Miles and his assistants were
in conference at various times during
the day respecting military operations
that are to be undertaken in the occu
pation of Cuba. They all maintain the
strictest reticence concerning the re
sults of these deliberations, and have
adopted the policy of making nothing
public regarding the regular army
movements, and none of the officers
would confirm the reports published to
day that the infantry regiments at New
Orleans and some of the troops at
Chickamauga are to proceed without
delay to Tampa.
General Shafter, who commands the
brigade at New Orleans, left to-night
for that place, accompanied by his ad
jutant, Colonel Babcock. The Cuban
representatives in Washington were at
General Miles' headquarters to-day
and were consulted in regard to various
steps which would arise in connection
with the co-operation of United States
troops with the Insurgent forces In
Cuba.
The War Department, it is expected,
will endeavor to secure additional ships
for transports, but it is said that none
were acquired to-day. The capacity of
those obtained yesterday is not ade
quate to the number of men which, it
is reported, will embark on the expe
dition to one of the Cuban ports, and
which, it is believed, will be sent in a
very short time. The commissary de
partment has depots of supplies at New
Orleans, Mobile and Chickamauga ade
quate, it is said, for the immediate use
of the service.
AGAIN A RUMOR OF
GERMAN INTERFERENCE.
Report That the Kaiser Will Not
"Permit" a Bombardment
of Manila,
MADRID, April 29.â A great impres
sion has been produced here by a ru
mor that the German Government has
issued a note declaring that it will not
oppose the landing of troops in the
Philippines, but will not permit a bom
bardment, owing to the importance of
the German mercantile interests in all
the towns of the island. Germany's
omission to declare neutrality is held
to give color to this rumor.

KEY WEST, Fla., April 29.âDiscov
eries made to-day on the captured !
Spanish steamship Panama made it ;
very improbable that she will ever be \
returned to Spain, whatever may be j
made of the Buena Ventura and other \
prizes taken. A search of the Panama's |
cargo was begun yesterday by the Prize j
Commission. This search was continued j
systematically to-day, and it is as yet i
far from complete, but the commission j
has already discovered 200 new Mauser |
rifles and a large consignment of
swords and bayonets, besides a quan- I
tity of fixed ammunition for the Pan
ama's four 14-pounder guns which she I
might have used to blow her captor, the !
Mangrove, out of water, but did not.
The Panama s captain had refused to
admit that his cargo included any con- j
traband of war. It is believed that a j
further search will reveal many more
weapons, and possibly more ammuni- !
tion.
The Prize Commissioners also found
papers tending to show that certain
ones of the Panama's passengers and
other New York Spaniards had been
actively engaged in plans for aiding
the Spaniards of Cuba in getting arms,
ammunition and supplies. The discov
ery of these documents has already led j
to an order from Washington to hold j
as prisoners of war a large number of !
the Panama's passengers.

DIES OF THIRST
ON THE DESERT
Fate of a Stranger on the
Death Valley Borax
Road.
Found Unconscious and Re
vived by a Physician and
His Wife.
Opens His Eyes Only to Release
Flood of Tears and Then Closes
Them in Death.
Special DlÃDatch to The Call.
JOHANNESBURG, April 29.â Many
prospectors have died of thirst near
Lone Willow Spring. This is half way
between Ballarat, Inyo County, and
Granite Wells, San Bernardino County,
on the Death Valley borax road. The
spring is two miles from the road and
hard to find.
Last Tuesday Dr. S. M. Slocum and
his wife of Randsburg found a man by
the side of the road near Lone Willow
spring, unconscious from thirst. He
was lifted into the wagon, an injection
given him, and whisky forced past his
swollen tongue. Then the man partly
opened his eyes, and great tears rolled
down his cheeks as Dr. Slocum said:
"You're ail right; I'll take you home.
Don't feel bad."
The word "home" conveyed too much
of happiness. With sighs the poor man
breathed his last almost in sight of
water and comfort. His fingers had
been worn to the bones digging for
water. At places along the road it
could be seen where he had dvg 1 . There
was nothing about the maa to tell who
he was or wherefrom. He was of
light complexion, like a Scandinavian.
The body and all of the stranger's
belongings are buried sixteen paces
from a certain rock on the Death Val
ley road.
Two graves beside the road, one near
the Lone Willow spring on the moun
tain side, mark the resting place of
three other men who died of thirst,
similar to this case.
SAN DTEGO, April 29.â Ed Moore
of this city and Jay S. Green of Los
Angeles have returned from a trip on
the Colorado Desert, in this county.
They left the third member of their
party, Joseph S. Stanley, aged 35, of
Bakersfteld, dying of hunger and thirst
at Coyote Mills, on the desert, seventy
five miles east of here, on Wednesday
last. They lost their way in attempt
ing to reach Yuma, their horses died,
and they left their companion when he
could no longer walk.

CHOOSING
GENERAL
OFFICERS
Difficulty of the President
in Naming Volunteer ,
Comn)aQders.
For the One Hurjdred and Twenty-
Five Thousand Troops Called
For It Will Require Nearly
Four Hundred Officers.
NEW YORK, April 29.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald tel
egraphs: No part of the Avar prepar
ations has given President McKinley
more trouble than the appointment of
officers to perfect the organization of
the 125,000 men that have been called
into service. Try as he will to pre
vent politics entering the question, he
is besieged from all directions by mem
bers of his party who are not only ask
ing, but demanding appointments. He
has the greatest amount of patronage
which has fallen to any President since
the war.
In connection with the volunteer
army alone he will have the appoint
ment of twelve major-generals and
thirty-four brigadier-generals, with
their staffs, which aggregate twenty
one lieutenant-colonels, 100 majors, 147
captains and sixty-eight first lieuten
ants, making a grand total of 384 of'
fleers. Of these six major-generals
and fifteen brigadier-generals will be
appointed probably on Monday. The
President will appoint all of these 384
officers, but the recommendations of
the general officers will in most cases
prevail when it comes to the selection
of members of their staffs.
General Grenville M. Dodge to-day
declined the position of major-general
of volunteers which President McKin
ley had offered. General Dodge has
been in this city since Tuesday and has
had many conferences with representa
tives of the army and War Depart
ment, who have tried without success
to prevail upon him to accept the com
mand of the first volunteer corps. Gen
eral Dodge was greatly complimented
at the honor offered him, but said he
was too old to take the field again. He
will abide by his decision unless the
war becomes more severe or lasting
than is now expected.
other candidates for the high mili
tary positions at the disposal of the
President are presented by influential
men each day. Generals Wheeler and
Lee are about equally well indorsed
for the command of the army corps to
be formed from the Southern quotas.
The selection may, however, be a little
influenced by the political status of the
two candidates. The Southern Demo
crats seem to prefer General Wheeler
on the ground of his free silver affilia
tions.
The name of General James Wilson
is now the only one in the list of promi
nent Northern generals who remains
of the general officers which the Presi
dent had at first intended to select.
General Wheeler and General Wilson
were opposed to each other through the
rebellion as leaders of the Northern
and Southern cavalry forces in the
Gulf States, and it would be an inter
esting incident if after thirty years
they should command adjacent corps
in the army of the Union.
General Wilson's selection is consid
ered here as practically <-Â°rtaln. He is
one of the youngest of the prominent
war generals now living, having been
graduated at West Point in the class
of 1860. General Wilson had every rank
in the army, from second lieutenant to
major general of volunteers, and cul
minated his career as a dashing cav
alry leader by the capture at the close
of the war of the Confederate Presi
dent, Jefferson Davis.
Brigadier-General William R. Shaf
ter, who will command the first expedi
tion which is sent to Cuba, and which
will be entirely composed of regulars,
will upon his return receive the rank
and command of major-general of vol
unteers. General Shafter has a dis
tinguished war record, and served on
the frontier for twenty-five years as
commander of his regiment.
Many applications have heen made to
the War Department by Governors of
States for permission to appoint a
number of junior line officers of the
regular army to higher commands in
the volunteers. There also have been
received from Governors a number of
indorsements for officers of the grades
of colonel and lieutenant-colonel in the
regular establishment for the rank of
general officers of the provisional
forces. Colonel Lawton will be selected
by the President to fill tho highest po
sition with the Indiana quota, and Ma
jor Garington will be appointed briga
dier-general and accredited to Smith
Carolina. The most prominent and cap
able officers of the present National
Guard will be called upon to fill some
of the higher commands.
The officers most generally recom
mended for general officers among the
militia are Generals Snowden and Go
bin of Pennsylvania, who have re
ceived the almost unanimous indorse
ment of their State, and General Roe
and Coloner Francis V. Greene of New
York, the latter as a West Point gradu
ate and the former regular, being very
prominently favored at the War De
partment.
Colonel Otis of California will prob
ably command the troops left on the
Pacific Coast, with the rank of brig
adier general of volunteers. Colonel
Garretson of Cleveland and General J.
Warren Keifer are slated for high posi
tions with Ohio's representation. The
latter is a warm personal friend of the
President, has a distinguished war rec
ord, and is mentioned among the possi
bilities for command of a division.
Webb Hayes, a son of former President
Hayes, was to-day appointed major of
Ohio vavalry. The lieutenant-colonelcy
of the regiment has been given to Cap
tain Day of the regular army.

VAI/LEJO, April 29.â Mrs. Cooley, wife
of an employe of the sugar refinery, while
crossing the railroad track to-day, was
knocked clown and instantly killed by the
Oregon express. The engine threw hor a
distance of thirty feet, breaking her neck
and limbs.
The Charges Against Hanna.
WASHINGTON, April 29.â The charges
against Hon. M. A. Hanna in connection
with his election to the United States
Senate by the State Senate of Ohio have
been received by the Vice-President, and
will probably be laid before the Senate
on .Monday. It in presumed the documents
will be referred to the Committee on
Privileges and Elections.
SAFE ARRIVAL OF THE
TROOP SHIP PANTHER.
KEY WEST, April 29.â The chief in
cident of tht_- day was. the sale arrival
of the troop ship Panther with nearly
700 marines on board. The Fern arriv
ed from Tampa with ammunition for

been is not known, except to the au
thorities and those aboard.
A statement is made by Lieutenant
McKinley, in charge of the harbor de
fenses, that Key West will be practic
ally closed to vessels between the
hours of 8 p. m. and 4 a. m., beginning
to-morrow night.
The Mascotte arrived here this after
noon, bringing Miss Clara Barton and
a corps of red cross workers. The
party did not come ashore, but were
taken down stream to the red cross
ship State of Texas, which has been
awaiting their arrival. The State of
Texas has on board about 1400 tons of
provisions, clothing and medicines.
She will await instructions from Wash

EVERY YOUNG OR MIDDLB-

should make the true nerve test.
This is done by concentrating the mind
on a given object for an ordinary

melancholy thoughts stealing over you
it is treatment you need and the k ( nd
of treatment that will restore you to
vigorous strength. Weakness comes
j upon men in a variety of ways. Most
frequently weakness comes on a .man
through his early errors. If these er-
rors are stopped in time and the young
man pays good attention to the laws
of health no bad effects result; but if
these vicious habits are continued and
other bad habits contracted the indi-
vidual comes to the point where he
must get medical aid or become an ex-

ture decay is the sad condition of majiy
men to-day. Now you know the rea-

COIN FOR
THE FRAY
Speedy Passage of the War
Revenue Bill by the
House.
In Offering an Entire New Measure
Including Committee Amend
ments, a Clever Parlia
mentary Victory Is Won.
Call Office Riggs House,
Washington, April 29.
The House to-day passed the war
revenue bill, with only the amend
ments agreed upon by the Republican
members of the Ways and Means Com
mittee added. In order to accomplish
this a parliamentery maneuver was
necessary, as the whole time f^r
amendments was oxhausted by the
minority in trying to amend the bond
feature of the bill. Dingley offe- ' as
a substitute an entirely new bill con
taining these amendments after the
bill had been reported to the House.
This was an old pariiamenta .. trick
frequently resorted to years ago. The
Morrill tariff law was passed in this
way in Its original form, after it had
been loaded down with amendments in
committee of the whole.
Many amendments were offered to
the bond feature of the bill, ranging
from a proposition for the substitution
of an income tax provision '.Â» an au
thorization for an issue of $150,000,000
of greenbacks. But all were voted
down. At the last moment the Demo
crata decided to offer a motion to re
commit, with Instructions to report
the income tax proposition as an
amendment to the bill, instead of as
a substitute for the bond proposition.
This was due to the fact that a num
ber of Democrats declined to vote to
strike out the bond proposition. The
motion was defeatedâ l 34 to 173. Four
Republicans voted with the Democrats
and Populists on this vote. But on the
final passage of the billâ which was
carried, ISI to 131â the Democrats and
Populists, with six exceptions, voted
solidly against the bill. The Democrats
who voted for the bill are Cummings,
McClellan and Griggs, of New York,
Fitzgerald of Massachusetts, MeAleer
of Pennsylvania and Wheeler of Ala
bama. Two Republicansâ Linney of
North Carolina and Thorp ofVirglniaâ
voted with the opposition. Quite a
number of Democrats declined to vote.
The House convened at 10 o'clock this
morning to allow two hours more general
debate on the revenue bill before the bill
was taken up at noon for amendment
urder the five-minute rule.
Bland (D.) of Missouri discussed the
bond feature of the bill to whioh. he said,
the Democrats could never agree. They
could not agree to the issue of any more
"coin" bonds, which would be construed
under a Republican administration to
mean nothing but gold. So long as the
mints were closed to tho coinage of one
half the money metal of the world, the
Democrats, only under circumstances of
extreme stress, could consent to the issue
of such bonds. He argued the advisa
bility of th<' immediate coinage of the
gi'.vf'r seigniorage.
Kewlanda (811. Rep.) of Nevada argued
that the war would be confined to th>
navies of Spain and the United States,
and that its duration would depend upon
how long Spain could maintain upon the
pea the guerrilla warfare she has \x -en
accustomed to wage upon land. He
thought the war should be vigorously
prosecuted, and apparent extravagance
now might prove economy in the end.
By the Terms of the bill two-thirds of the
- were to be laid upon consumption
and one-third upon the current transac
tions of business. Not a dollar was to be
raised from the accumulated wealth of
the country. This was unfair, he said.
Grosvenor <R.) of Ohio, said that at
such a crisis as this, there were, as
(Stephen A. Douglas said, but two classes
\ci the countryâ patriots and traitors. He
was willing to accept the suggestions
emanating from the Democratic side,
however wild or impracticable, in poo.i
!airh. He would not impugn or even BUB
i lack of patriotism. Grosvenor then
proceeded to criticize some of these sug
gestions. Speaking of the bond feature,
he declared that the bonds would be
taken by the people of the country not
enly as a profitable Investment, but as
nee to the world that this country
proposes to free Cuba In the face of Spain.
Austria or any other country that saw
The other speakers before noon were
Curtis i Hi of Kansas, Shafroth (811. Rep.)
rado and Brown <R.) of Ohio.
At noon the House went through the
formality of adjourning and reconvening.
under the order, the bill was taken
up for amendment under the five-minute
rule.
Under tho arrangement made, the hnnd
nÂ« of the bill wero first to be open
lo amendment. McMillln (D.) of Tennes
see, offered, on behalf of the minority,
t'.-i amendment to strike out section 27.
the bond provision, and insert in lieu
thereof, the income tax amendment. It
1? identical with the income tax provision
of the Wilson tariff law, with tbe taxable
Income reduced from $4000 to $2000 per an
fium. and the per cent increased from 2
to .", per cent,
Walker <R.) of Massachusetts offered
as an amendment to the original section
a provision to change the terms of the
bonds so as to make them redeemable
one year, after the date of their Issue
and payable after three years and upon
me expiration of seven years, or due on
n certain day within three years, as the |
Secretary of the Treasury might elect.
Walker declared that his amendment !
v.-vii. gave the people from $2U.0<j0,000 to
| 000, Walker declared the bill should
â :. and that every Repub
lican should vote for the motion.
Korry (D.) of Kentucky called attention
remarkable coincidence that by this
bijl it wan proposed to issue J500.000.000. the
amnniit which Secretary Gaze had roc
ommend'-d for the purpose of redeeming
the greenbacks. There was no necessity
for such an enormous loan. The fortifi
cations of Matanzas had been reduced in
thirty minutes. Havana could be reduced
in two hours, and the war would be at an
end. Th* war should be pushed. The
reina should ho loosened. Havana would
fa.i before Sampson, the Plitllppit.'es be
fore Dewey and the Spanish fleet crowded
acrora tbe Atlantic before the onset of j
the flying squadron. Tho seriousness of
the situation was thoroughly exagger- i
att-d. "While our fleet was being held in
leash the population of Havana was
starving, find the end for which we aimed,
the relief of humanity. \ms being defeat
ed. In nine days. In his opinion, the war
would be over and the American flag
would be flying over Porto Rico and the
Philippines.
Walker's amendment was lost without
division. Many five-minute speeches on
the Income, tax amendment follow. -d
At 4 o'clock, under the rules, the bill
was reported to the House. As Chair
man Dingley had had an opportunity to
offer the amendments agreed upon by the
majority of the Ways and Means Com
mittee, he offered as a substitute a bill '
containing these amendments. There was
some question as to tho regularity of t hi- ;
proceeding, but tho Speaker hold that it
was in order. There were many protests ;
from the Democrats &gainsl this parlla
mentary move, and Bland insisted upon
the reading of the substitute in full.
Dingley briefly explained the committee
amendments, which were enumerated in
these dispatches last night, and "then de
manded the previous question. The sub
stitute was then adopted without divi
sion.
McMillin moved to recommit the bill,
with instructions to strike out the bond
provision and insert in lieu thereof the
income tax provision, but withdrew it
and allowed Bailey to modify the motion
to instruct the committee to add the in
come tax provision as an amendment to
thÂ» bill, the bond feature being retained.
The motion was defeatedâ l3l, 173.
The motion to recommit was defeatedâ
134. 173.
The vote was then taken on the final
passage of the hill and it was passedâ lSl,
131. With six t-xieptions the Demorrats
and Populists voted against the bill, and
two Republicans voted with the opposi
tion.
Boutelle <R.Â» of Mnlnp. chairman of the
Committee on Naval Affairs, presented
the conference report on the naval bill.
Cannon <R. \ of Illinois made the point of
order that the conferees had exceeded
their jurisdiction in that they added over
$500,000 above the difference between the
two houses and had also added provisions
whl< h were not in conference. With the
point of order pending he moved an ad
journment, which was carried.

INSURES GOOD CROPS.
Farmers Along Woodbridge Canal
Supplied With Water.
STOCKTON, April 2?. â Farmers along
Woodbridge canal are now happy, for the
canal Is running full of water, and thetr
thirsty lands are absorbing it. It comes in
time, too, to insure first class crops. The
water is running to the end of the main
ditch.
The dam Is still in the hands of the re
ceiver, but ranchers have an arrange
ment with him whereby the 1 "- can hold
their property under a sort of lease. The
money for the repairs ($. r .oooi was put up
by men who own about 170) acres of land,
and they get first call on the water. They
pet their money back in water at the rate
of $3 an acre. There are still about 3000
acres along the ditch which can be prof
itably Irrigated, and at a small charge
for water they can be made to pay the
cost of repairs.
Russians Friendly to Spain.
ST. JOHNS, N. F.. Anril 29.â The
British steamer Wa.nsbeck, Captain
Jones, from Cadiz, arrived to-day. Cap
tain Jones reports that when he left
Cadiz, fourteen days ago, active prep
arations were being made by the Span
iards for war. The dockyards were
crowded with artisans, cruisers and
torpedo boats were under repair and
regiments were assembling at the gar
rison. A Russian warship was aico
there, and it was evident that a very
friendly feeling existed between her
crew and those of the Spanish ships.
Captain Jones saw nothing of any war
ships on his voyage.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEVADA CITY, April 29.â This was
the closing day of the session of the
Grand Parlor of the Native Sons of the
Golden West. Opposing candidates for
office met on the floor, fought out the
battles that have been planned during
the past four days, and to-night the
vanquished made merry at the expense
of the victors. Never in the history of
the order has there been such a spir
ited contest for places on the board of
grand trustees. With few exceptions
there has never been so speedy a settle
ment of rival claims when the matter
was finally put to a vote.
Up to within twenty-four hours of
the time for making; nominations there
were no less than fifteen candidates In
| the field, in spite of the fact that there
were but six seats in the board to be
\ filled. Seven trustees were to be
elected, but precedent made it neces
| sary to give one of the places to the
; local parlor. The number of candi
dates was reduced somewhat by the
withdrawal of Henry Lichenstein of
Alcatras Parlor No. 149, Joseph E.
O'Donnell of Yerba Buena Parlor No.
84 and Frank Sablchi, a member of the
outgoing board.
Sabichi's withdrawal was a genuine
surprise, as his election was conceded,
even by his opponents. His action In
retiring at the last moment was due
to the fact that he believed that his
election, which was opposed by a por
tion of the southern delegation, would
not assist in promoting the best inter
ests of the order. O'Donnell's with
drawal was als<r an unlooked-for event,
which was brought about by an unsuc
cessful attempt to consolidate the vot
ing strength of the San Francisco dele
gation in the interest of Charles R.
Heverin of San Francisco Parlor No.
49 and Lewis F. Byington. a member
of the retiring board, as against Jos
eph K. Hawkins of Pacific Parlor No.
10 and O'Donnell. Although the at
tempt at amalgamation proved futile,
O'Donnell decided to withdraw from
the contest rather than be placed in
the position of being a disturbing fac
tOT.
For the more important offices there
was no contest, the election resulting
in the selection of the followlnar-named
grand officers, to serve durinpr the en
suing year:
Grand president. William N. Conley of
Madera.
Grand first vice-president, Frank Mat
tison of Santa Cruz.
Grand second vice-president. R. C. Rust
of Amador.
Grand orator, Frank L. Coombs of
Napa.

San Francisco.

San Francisco.
Grand inside sentinel, John J. McMahon
of Santa Cruz.
Grand outside sentinel, A. W. Fiedler of
Llvermore.
Grand marshal, W. A. Gaston of San
Jose.
The first ballot taken on the names
of candidates for grand trustee re
sulted in the election of H. R. McNoble
of Stockton, F. A. Cutler of Humboldt,
Lewis F. Byington of San Francisco.
Joseph K. Hawkins of San Francisco
and E. A. W. North of Winters.
On the second ballot A. Ramish of
Los Angeles was elected.
David Morgan of Nevada City was
elected by acclamation. Morgan is at
the head of the order in this city and
he has for years been a prominent fig
ure in the affairs of the order through
out the State. The success attending
the entertainment portion of the pres
ent session of the Grand Parlor Is
largely due to his individual efforts.
To-morrow Nevada City will see the
last of the Native Sons who have been
her guests during the week. A ma
jority of the visitors will leave for
their homes on the early morning
trains, carrying with them a host of
happy memories of the days spent in
and about the mining metropolis of
California.
T<>-nisht visiting delegates were ten
dered a banquet at Armory Hall. The
occasion was made the opportunity for
the presentation to Junior Past Grand
President Clark of a handsome jew
eled badge emblematic of his honorable
position on the rolls of the Native Sons
of California. As ia the usual custom,
the toastmaster held sway during the
latter part of the repast. Cheers were
given for the nation and her heroes on
land and sea and toasts drunk
to the health and long life of the Na
tive Sons and Native Daughters who
have contributed to make the visit to
Nevada City a pleasant one.
ENGLAND'S COAST DEFENSES.
It can no longer be said that Great
Britain is unprotected. The coast de
fenses were never more complete or ef
ficient. Right round our shore stretch
I these many defenses, not isolated ani
therefore of little account, but forming a
linked protection, with the telegraph or
telephone at hand to respond at navai
! headquarters in London to the slightest
i warning, and from Whitehall there
i branch off private wires to the great
arsenals of Portsmouth, Devonport. Chat
ham and Sheerness.
A few words from any point on the
coast, be it an isolated coastguard sta
tion or a lonely guardship, may in an
hour or two have led to orders of na
tional import being Hashed over sleeping
towns and villages to the naval com
manders in chief at the coast, and be
fore the outside world knows of impend
ing danger all the machinery of defense
will be in readiness for any emergency.
That this is no exaggeration those may
I judge who remember the hasty commis
'j sloning of the particular service squadron
in January. lS9fi. when the German Em
peror's ill-judged telegram to President
Kruger set England ablaze with anger.
Before even the Times announced the
decision of the Government to form this
new squadron, "to do anything and go
anywhere," as Mr. Goschen explained, the
telegraph instruments at Whitehall had
been vigorously ticking, and unknown to
I the public the admirals at Chatham,
i Portsmouth and Devonport had had their
â¢ orders. By the time the world was
; awake the preparations for commission
ing the ships had commenced, and in a
i few days a squadron of powerful modern
] vessels was fitted out and ready for any
task. When the necessity arises no less
promptly will the machinery of defense
be again put to the test, possibly on a
more extensive scale.â Chambers' Jour

DEFRAUDED HIS
WARD'S ESTATE
San Jose Court Orders a
Guardian to Make
Restitution.
Must Repay Money Misappro
priated During His Ad
ministration.
Decision Rendered Against Abram
King, a Capitalist of the
Garden City.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, April 29.â Abram King,
who for nearly twenty years was guar
dian of the person and estate of Steph
en Hobson, an incompetent, will have
to reimburse the estate to the amount
of $13,242 66 for moneys misappropri
ated during his administration. This
was the decision rendered by Judge
Hyland to-day. The court said it was
shown by the testimony that King had
imprudently invested his ward's
money, had made overcharges, grossly
neglected matters and failed to account
for moneys received. He allowed King
i $2800 for commissions as guardian, and
! this will be deducted from the 513,242 66
i shortage.
King was appointed Hobson's puar
j dian in 1877, and a year or two later
j began his gross mismanagement of the
' estate. The estate of his insane ward
was worth about $40,000, and consisted
of a building and lot at the corner of
! Santa Clara and Lighston streets in
'â  this city and some cash. He overcharg
!ed the estate on every occasion. On
' bills that he paid he would afterward
raise the amount, and for a number
of years he failed to turn in the full
amount of rent received from the
I building belonging to the estate.
Hobson died about two years ago.
i His daughter, Mrs. Louise J. Kruse, ob
tained letters of administration. An
investigation showed the estate had
1 been systematically robbed of about
$16,000. A demand was made on King
; for this amount, but he refused to set
! tie. Suit was then brought. An ap
| peal will bp taken from the decision
j rendered to-day.
King is a prominent capitalist of this
I city and is worth over $500,000.
THE FUTURE CZAR OF SAN
FRANCISCO.
The Lord Mayors of Birmingham,
Dublin and Belfast are serfs compared
with the Mayor of San Francisco, who
under the new charter will enjoy more
personal power than Emperor William
in Berlin. The English Lordships are
mere creatures of the Government.
They have no special authority to in
fluence legislation. They cannot veto
a single ordinance nor hinder the ex
penditure of a single cent. They can
not appoint a public officer, dispute a
contract, or stop the payment of the
smallest claim upon the treasury. They
enjoy no patronage and their office anil
functions have, therefore, no political
significance. Their personal power and
responsibility are merged in the corpor
ate power of Die rnvernment. They
represent (Si public interests and act
under the mantle of popular support.
Their personal influence depends on
brains and patriotism and their reward
is the approval of the citizens.
Under the new charter the Mayor of
Pan Francisco will be a veritable Czar.
He is authorized to initiate new policies
and to veto legislation, to cut down ap
propriations, to refuse the ratification
of contracts, to reject items of account,
and besides his legislative functions he
will have discretionary power to ap
point and remove the officials who con
stitute the real governmen . Moreover
he is authorized to suspend the very
elected of the people. He appoints and
will control the election officers and is
practically responsible for an honest
counting of the votes. He and his min
isters will have charge of all the city
property, parks, schools and public
buildings. They will control 83 per cent
of the entire expenditures of the city
government. Of this two millions and
a half will have the form of patronage
â with a certain future increase, especial
ly In the Department of Public Works.
He is also given power to influence ap
pointments in the lower ranks.
The Commissioners of Civil Service
are servants either for good or evil. No
one supposes that the New York com
mission appointed by Mayor Van Wyck
will pass Republican candidates for
Tammany and Croker, and the rules
have been ignored in many other cities,
of which Philadelphia is a marked ex
ample. This distribution of power con
trasts unfavorably with that of Eng
lish cities. The financial reports of
San Francisco and Birmingham for last
year will show the difference. In San
Francisco the total expenditures of the
city government exceeded six millions.
In Birmingham, with a population a
fourth greater it was $3,600,000. In this
is included the salaries of a stipendiary
Police Judge and the officials of his
court. The cost of the police, the pub
lic, technical and industrial schools,
eight public parks, five public gardens
and recreation grounds, five public
baths and wash houses, three public
markets with food inspectors, a com
plete staff of health officers and munici
pal officials, a fire brigade of moderate
dimensions, a public museum and a
school of art and twelve public free
libraries. In San Francisco the salar
ies amounted to three millions, in Bir
mingham to $300,000. In San Francisco,
after the payment of salaries and ne
cessary current expenses, there is noth
ing left for permanent improvements.
In Birmingham 40 per cent of the pub
lic expenditure is devoted to permanent
improvements, such as widening and
paving streets, erecting public build
ings, improving lighting, sewerage, etc.
The municipal government of Birming
ham is acknowledged to be one of the
best in the world, due mainly to its
form. That of San Francisco is proba
bly the worst. Will it be wise to elect
a Czar or better to elect a Birmingham
Lord Mayor?

PEOPLE FED ON SAWDUST.
Some time ago, says the Family Doctor,
at the depot of Havre, the Government
seized a consignment of 10,000 pounds of
finely ground sawdust. The seizure was
the result of numerous complaints made
by bread consumers In the department in
which Havre is situated. Investigation
brought out the fact that for more than
two years bakers' flour had been sys
tematically adulterated by the addition of
a free sawdust. The culprit was arrested.
At his examination it was learned that,
in one department alone, he had disposed
of ovf-r 500 wagon loads, and that in vari
ous other departments his sales had ag
gregated over 5000. The sawdust was pur
chased in Paris, and shipped to the vari
ous points where the culprit had sold it.
His customers were mostly millers, who
supplied the adulterated flour to the
bakers. The investigations and resulting
prosecutions will involve a large number
of millers and bakers.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WOODLAND, April 29.â A pretty lit
tle cottage in Bremer Park is the seat
of more woe and desolation than
usually falls to the lot of one family
in a single day. Within its portals a
father and son lie dead, one by the dis
pensation of Providence, the other by
his own hand. James Gilmore Stewart,
20 years of age, after an illness of a
little more than a week, died yester
day. His death was a great shock to
all the members of the family, but the
father, William J. Stewart, more than
all others, took It to heart. He blamed
himself for the fatal illness of his son,
and the feeling of remorse no doubt in
fluenced him to take his own life.
For many years the father had been
addicted to strong drink, and in conse
quence contributed but little toward the
support of the family. The burden of
support has been chiefly borne by the
son. A few days before he was stricken
by his fatal illness he and his father
had a quarrel on account of the failure
of the father to provide for his family.
While the son was delirious the father
made frequent references to the quarrel
and spemed greatly worried on account
of it. Ho even went so far as to say
that he ought to kill himself, as his
son's illness was no doubt due to the
trouble between them.
An hour after the death of the son
the father came to Woodland. There
was nothing about his manner to indi
cate that he contemplated self-destruc
tion. He did not return home until 9
o'clock in the evening. He was in a
maudlin condition, but as that wan
nothing for him his wife put him to
bed, thinking that sleep would sober
him.
At 6 o'clock this morning the family
was aroused by a sound of labored
breathing, which came from the room
in which the elder Stewart slept. Mrs.
Stewart went to the bedside and found
her husband unconscious.
Dr. Kier was summoned. Upon his ;
arrival an examination disclosed the I
fact that the man had been slowly dy- j
ing for hours from the effect of opiate !
poisoning.
The usual remedies t. ere applied, but
without effect. The o;.i man never re
gained consciousness. He breathed his \
last at 9:30 o'clock this morning.
It has since been learned that while
Stewart was in this city he purchased
a bottle of whisky at one place and a
quantity of laudanum at another. As
he took neither home with him the pre
sumption is that he drank both. Cor
oner Bean will hold an inquest Satur
day morning.
COLONEL JOHN HAY'S POEMS.
The world knows Colonel John Hay
best by his "Pike County Ballads."
Few things, indeed, are more remark
able in the history of our modern lit
erature than the way in which this
handful of poems took the English
speaking world by storm. They came,
they saw, they overcame â after the
manner of all true poetry which
touches the most human side of men
and women. The London Spectator
goes on to say: The poem called
"Banty Tim" is in our opinion the
most heroic of Colonel Hay's ballads.
The lines describe how Sergeant Til
man Joy, a Northern veteran, explain
ed to the white man.'s committee of
Spunky Point, 111., that he was not go
ing to have his negro friend, Tim,
driven out of the village:
Why, blame your hearts. Jest hear me!
You know that ungodly day
When our left struck Vicksburg Heights, how
ripped
And torn and tattered we lay.
When the rest retreated I stayed behind.
For reasons sufficient to meâ
With a rib caved In, and a leg on a strike,
I sprawled on that cursed glacee.
Lord! how the hot sun went for us.
And'br'iled and blistered and burned!
How the rebel bullets whizzed round us
When a cum in his death grip turned!
Till along toward dusk I seen a thing
I couldn't believe for a spell;
That niggerâ that Timâ was a crawlln' to me
Through that fireproof, gilt-edged hell!
The rebels seen him as quick as me.
And the bullets buzzed like bees;
But he lumped for. me. and shouldered me,
â¢ Though a shot brought him once to his knees;
But he staggered up. and packed me oft,
With a dozen stumbles and falls.
Till safe in our lines he dropped us both.
His black hide riddled with balls.
So. my gentle gazelles, thar's my answer,
And here stays Banty Tim:
He trumped Heath's oco fnr mo that day
And I'm not going back on him!
You may rezoloot till the cows come home
But pf "no of you tetches the boy.
He'll wrestle his hash to-nlglit In hell.
Or my name's not Tilman Joy!
This is a poem which goes straight
to the heart with the sacrod comrade
ship of the battlefield. The phrase,
"You may rezoloot (resolute, I. c., pass
resolutions till the cows come home,*'
is alone enough to make the poem a
memorable one. It puts in a sentence
that Anglo-Saxon scorn for the oppres
sion of the lawless mob, or the lawless
majority which is so sound a barrier
against the excesses of a too trium
phant democracy. It is the plain man's
very unmistakable way of saying.

not my tyrant."

SPANIARDS
SEEN NEAR
THE WORKS
Their Blankets Found at
the Scene of the Santa
Cruz Disaster.
William Peyton, Inventor of Ex
plosives, Certain that Spies
Destroyed the Powder
Factory,
SANTA CRUZ, April 29.â There Is
no escape from the theory that the ex
plosion at the California Powder Works
here was caused by an act of treach
ery. That is the calm judgment of
William Peyton, one of the inventors
of modern artillery powder. While he
is not writing or talking on the sub
ject, his views are clear and pointed.
He believes there was treachery back
of the disaster.
Mrs. Martha Wilson, who lives on
Beach liill, contributes a little testi
mony as to the identity of the three
dead men whose remains are not
known here. She says she saw two
Spaniards with blankets the day of the
explosion. They were going toward
the powder works. The blankets have
been found and Coroner Clark expects
to have them before the inquest on
Monday.
A man named Kenny, who works at the
mill, saw a stranger peeping through a
knothole in a board fence near the
works about the time of the explosion.
That might account for the third body.
Government agents are quietly work
ing on the case and nobody is allowed
on the grounds. There is no excite
ment here over the explosion, because
people know nothing about the mys
tery of making modern prismatic and
military powder. The public dismisses
the question with the simple verdict
that the disaster was accidental, but
suspicions become more and more
grave in the minds of those who know
the details of the explosion.
Colonel Bernard Peyton, in an inter
view with The Call correspondent,
said:
"There is absolutely no way to solve
the mystery. It is almost a certainty
that the explosion began in the room
where wet guncotton was dried, and it
is equally certain that all experience
has shown that wet guncotton is harm
less. It will burn quietly without do
ing danger, and it cannot be exploded
by a blow from a hammer or by a rifle
or pistol shot, so the entire matter is
a mystery; but I do not believe it was
done by spies."
Colonel Peyton made the following
significant admission concerning the
explosion:
â¢'I think we have plainly proved that
the explosion began in the guncotton.
drying room; also that no human being
was there at the time. I admit that
spontaneous explosion in this place
seems absolutely impossible, and that
a man skilled in chemistry and explo
sives might have set a fuse with a de
tonating cap in such a way as to cause
the disaster. I disagree with my son
and others, however, who hold some
such theory."
Colonel Peyton says that about a
hundred new men were working on the
grounds at the time Of the explosion.
Some of them, he says, were probably
killed and unidentified. There is a ru
mor that some of the new men were
very careless and that one of them re
cently frightened old hands by upset
ting two cans of nitro-glycerine from a
wheelbarrow, a terrible explosion being
averted only by the fact that the cans
struck soft earth. The accident theory
might find confirmation in such facts
as these â green men handling danger
ous explosives in a careless way.
In view of recent developments a let
ter which Lieutenant-Governor Jeter
sent to Governor Budd at 8
o'clock Sunday night becomes very
important. Adjutant-General Bar
rett telephoned to Lieutenant-
Governor Jeter on Saturday that
the Governor desired him to call on
Superintendent Peyton and ask
whether Colonel Peyton believed the
powder mills needed protection. Mr.
Jeter called and Colonel Peyton ad
mitted that the interests involved were
very important. Lieutenant-Governor
Jeter's letter was as follows:
SANTA CRUZ. Cal., April 23. 1898.
My Dear Governor: At your request,
through General Barrett. I went tn the
California Powder Works this morning
and talking with Colonel Peyton, the
superintendent, as to th.c advisability of
having military protection for the plant.

apprehend any trouble, but whilst the

caution to prevent accident to this"plant.
Lieutenant Babbitt, ordnance officer
from Benicia. was at the plant at noon,
to-day to look after a shipment of 100,000
pounds of powder, which leaves to-night
to be landed In Chicago within ninety-six
hours. He has been here frequently and
is thoroughly familiar with the topog
raphy of the location and the general de
tails of the plant. I talked with him about
the matter and requested him to call
upon you or General Barrett at the Cali
fornia upon his return to the city Mon
day. I understand that he has already
urged the matter of protection before the
federal authorities.
In conclusion I have to say that it is
my candid opinion that stÂ«ps toward the
military policing of this Important prop.
erty should be taken without delay.
Yours sincerely,

A SANITARY MEASURE.
Walls Must Be Cleaned Betore Being
Repapered or Repainted.
At a meeting of the Health and Polica
Committee of the Board of Supervisors
yesterday it was decided to report in
favor of granting permission to the Cali
fornia Athletic and Swimming Club to
give exhibitions of boxing, wrestling etc
at its rooms at 1006 Golden (late avenue.
Favorable action was tak.-n on the peti
tion of the Building Trades <"ouncil ask
ing that an ordinance be passed making
it a misdemeanor to paper, tint, or kalso
mine any room, hall or closet without
first removing the old paper, tint or kal
somine, the order not to appiy to old
work done within a year.
A DOG'S SENSE.
A young girl was crossing the publio
garden the other morniner upon the
main path which crossed the bridge.
She was accompanied by a magnificent
mastiff, who strode along beside her in
the most companionable sort of way,
looking up into her face occasionally
as if to remark casually that it was a
very fine morning or to ask if there was
anything he could do for her.
The two crossed the bridge together,
and finally came to the < 'harles street
gate. Here the young girl, not wishing
to have the care of the dog in the busy
streets, turned to him and said:
"There, that is far enough now,
Marso. You need not go with me any
farther, but turn about and go back
home."
She did not take her hands out of her
muff to point the way, and she spoke
as she would to a small brother, in a
pleasant, 'conversational voice.
Marco looked at her with his largo
eyes, then looked across the common,
wagging his tail slowly as though he
were thinking how very pleasant it
would be to go the rest of the way.
Finally he turned back to her again
and with a movement of his head and
eyes asked as plainly as though the
words had come from his mouth:
"Please let me go a little farther, it is
such a fine morning."
"No, dear; I'm going shopping, you
know," answered the girl, explaining
the difficulty as if Marco were human.
"There'll be crowds or people and I
shall not know what to do with you.
But go along now, there's a good fel
low, and I'll be back soon."
Without another word Marco turned
and walked back across the gardens.
He did not slink away, as some dogs
do when sent back, but marched lies
urely alonp with his head in the air,
stopped a moment on the bridge to
watch the children skating below, then
trotted on toward Commonwealth
avenue. The Athenian watched him
until he had disappeared beyond the
gates, then resumed his own way, won
dering whether Darwin loved dogs or
not. â Boston Record.

POWDER-MILL EXPLOSIONS.
\OPULAR suspicion that the explosion of the
Ly powder mill at Santa Cruz was due to Spanish
treacher}- will be increased by the news oi the
explosion of the powder mills at Dover, N. J. It
is certainly a singular coincidence that two such im
portant works should have been blown up in such swift
succession within so short a period since the declara
tion of war against Spain.
At Santa Cruz and at Dover the powder mills were
running at full speed for the manufacture of ammuni
tion for the Government. The need of smokeless
powder is urgent, and the mills therefore are of the
highest importance to the nation at this emergency.
The increased activity at the works of course in
creased the chances of explosions, but this was fore
seen and increased care was exercised. That both of
them should have been destroyed under such circum
stances is therefore a coincidence which recalls the
destruction of the Maine and inevitably awakens sus
picion of foul play.
In the United States there is so large a liberty of
action granted to individuals and the population is
made up of persons of so many nationalities that it
is comparatively easy for unscrupulous persons to
inflict great damage upon the country and escape
detection. Men of all races come and go freely in our
cities and throughout the country. We cannot read
ily perceive the difference between the loyal and
patriotic American of Spanish or Mexican descent
and the sneaking spy or treacherous dynamiter who
may cunningly slip into the country to work some
devilish scheme against the Government.
The two explosions may have been the result of
accident, but they should serve to put the Govern
ment and the people on guard against possible
treachery hereafter. In each case the official inves
tigation into the causes of the disaster should be
made with the closest scrutiny. Accidents in pow
der mills are of course difficult of avoidance, but un
der the present circumstances we ought not to be too
easily persuaded that the explosion of these two mills
in such swift succession was merely a coincidence of
accidents.
Since the yellow press has taken to sending out
commissioners instead of correspondents, a difference
between the two has become apparent. A correspon
dent tries to get news, and exerts himself to put it on
the wire. A commissioner is too high-toned to be
hampered by mere facts. He interviews Princes and
potentates without having seen them, he tells of the
policy of nations, detailing as confidentially revealed
to himself plans never formed nor contemplated.
He directs the movements of navies and armies,
knocks a throne over by a stroke of the pencil, erects
it with an eraser. He cables over the inmost thought
of the Vatican, describes engagements that never oc
cur, or that, occurring, he never saw. He boasts of
bravery which is bogus, of achievements never at
tained. In short he is an all-round liar, faker, fraud,
a mischief-maker and a nuisance.
Germany desires to retain freedom of action during
the present trouble, and if the Kaiser can refrain from
indulging in one of his justly celebrated tantrums per
haps there will be no objection. But if in his capacity
of war lord he tries war-lording over a scrimmage
which is no concern of his, the hesitancy about calling
him to his senses, so far as possible, will be notable
for its entire absence.
It appears that the Board of Education has stolen
enough lumber from each school to build a house.
Perhaps the honorable body can plead that it would
have been a small house, anyhow, but it is not easy
to see how circumstances will permit the presentation
of any better excuse, and this would be regarded by
the public as faulty.
It is not pleasant to read that the Panther, a ship
loaded with marines and apprentices, is a leaky tub
with a downward tendency manifest every time the
wind rises. It would seem to the lay mind that the
marines will be exposed soon enough to unavoidable
perils. !
A question has arisen as to whether Widber did
not bury some of the money he stole. Probably he
did not, or the present circumstances would have a
tendency to make him dig it up. Widber had money
to burn, not to bury.
The morning paper which stole a copyrighted pic
ture from Truth ought -to have done that publication
the honor to have produced a reasonably fair copy
of the booty. People do not care to see a sky-blue
cruiser sailing right into a geyser of catsup.
School Director Gallagher appears not to like the
Grand Jury, and there is painful evidence that the
â¢motion to which he gives voice is mutual.
WAS BRIBERY USED ?
PATRIOTISM, that love of country which
moves men to the highest personal sacrifice, is
sometimes simulated by pretenders who use it
to conceal sinister and covert motives and purposes
of individual profit. It was knowledge of this pre
tended sentiment that moved Dr. Johnson to define
patriotism as "the last refuge of a scoundrel." Cer
tain yellow journals in this country have been scream
ing for a year to bring about recognition of the so
called government of a faction of the insurgents in
Cuba. That government has issued bonds in a large
amount, and its recognition would make these bonds
valid and compel their payment out of the resources
of the island when it becomes independent, if the fac
tion that issued them is recognized as being a gov
ernment prior to such independence.
It is known that $2,000,000 of these bonds was
offered to the proprietor of an influential Chicago pa
per if he would push recognition. As this offer was
made, it does not require a suspicious nature to con
clude that similar offers were made and accepted by
the yellow journalists. Any one familiar with the
blackmailing record of Hearst may even see in the
yellow zeal for recognition shown by his two papers
a motive with nothing better than a bribe at its base.
His gross abuse of the President for disfavoring
recognition and his faking of exciting statements
which would create a public opinion to bring press
ure on the President and Congress perhaps were
evidence of a desire to force a policy that would
validate bonds and make them a lien upon Cuba.
The last American Consul to escape from the
island says that the so-called government which
Hearst wanted recognized can muster at the maxi
mum only 35,000 fighting men, while he believes that
Spain can secure from the island population about
ten times that number. It appears, then, that Hearst
wanted to recognize a faction that does not command
the confidence and support of a majority of the
islanders, who want independence, but object to
being forced to take that minority faction as their
government.
If it become certain that this vile c cheme for per
sonal profit was the motive of Hearst and the cause
of his detraction of the President, the people will
have an account to settle with him and his indecent
papers. A war upon the high ground on which the
influence of the President has succeeded in putting
it is sad enough as a means for enforcing a great
policy. It will cost dearly in lives and treasure, but
its success will be accepted by the country as worth
the sacrifices it will demand.
But a war on the ground urged by Hearst, to put
millions in the pockets of its promoters and to saddle
those millions on the people of Cuba in the shape of
bonds issued by a fly-by-night government, would
have been the vilest thing in history.
Forewarned is forearmed. The Congressional
elections will take place in all probability before the
war is over, and the Hearst papers and others which
may be actuated by the base motive of gain will be
found inflaming the people in favor of electing a
Congress which will recognize the government in
Cuba which has issued a blanket mortgage upon the
island. This must be prevented. The highest dic
tates of patriotism forbid that a corrupt financial
scheme shall succeed by misusing the high sentiments
of the American people.
Hearst has exploited his qualities as a blackmailer
by rifling the treasuries of corporations 2nd exacting
money for "fnir treatment," as set forth in the con
tract. But t ..ckmailing of a people like the Cubans,
with the U .ted States army and navy to enforce it,
is a scheme so abhorrent that it would turn the stom
ach even of Weyler.
ELECTRIC ENERGY IN FRANCE.
\A GUILLAIN has recently submitted to the
/ \ French Chamber of Deputies a report of a
* â¢ commission upon the distribution of energy
from natural sources throughout the country, to
gether with a bill designed to promote by govern
mental action the extension of the distribution on a
grand scale. The object of the movement is to pro
vide the French people with the full use of the water
and other natural power which is now going to waste
to a great extent, and if carried out will of course
vastly increase the working strength of the nation.
It is pointed out in the report that the construction
of railways by cheapening the cost of transportation
of raw material has massed the working population
into large cities, most of which are distant from
waterfalls and other natural sources of power. The
invention of a means of transmitting energy by elec
tricity from the water power to the city has compen
sated for the loss occasioned by the original removal
of the factory from the place where the fall exists.
Hence the development of that transmission is one of
the needs of the time. The raw material having been
carried from the country to the city, the natural
power must now be carried there also.
According to the report of the commission the
waterfalls of France have a force which is estimated
to surpass the motive power generated by all the
steam engines in the entire world outside railways
and steamboats. By a well devised system of elec
trical transmission every pound of this power could
be made available for use in city or country, and the
productive energies of the nation largely increased.
An important feature of the transmitted energy is
the facility with which it can be subdivided and de
livered in force proportioned to the demand. The big
factory can obtain ioo-horsepower, and the indepen
dent workman in his small shop can get half a horse
power with equal ease. Moreover, the farmer can
have it in his fields as well as the artisan in his work
shop. This fact may have far-reaching consequences,
for one of the reasons why small factories are now
being crowded out by the larger ones is the superior
advantages of the big factories in the matter, of power.
When the individual worker can get power on some
thing like equal terms with his giant competitor
there is likely to be considerable change in our in
dustrial system.
From the reports of the bill which have come to us
through Le Petit Journal it is not clear to what ex
tent the commission would have the Government ex
ercise control over the transmission of energy. It is
certain, however, that the aim is to prevent this vast
power from falling into the hands of monopolies or
other irresponsible control. The natural energies of
France are to be developed for the whole people of
France, and if the great plan is carried out the bene
fits likely to accrue can hardly be overrated.
Madrid diplomatists are sounding the praises of
the Spanish soldiers in Cuba, which is very kind of
them. However, a stock of provisions patriotically
projected through the blockade would be more con
ducive to the accumulation of fat on the soldierly rib.
It seems necessary to remind certain gentlemen of
commercial instinct that the American flag was not
designed for the purpose of advertising even so
noble a product of civilization as gum.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 30, 1898.
IF the Railroad Commissioners undertake an inves
tigation of the expenditures of the Southern Pa
cific Company for the purpose of determining
whether or not the corporation is able to pay divi
dends upon its capital stock they should make the in
quiry thorough and complete. There will be no ex
cuse for a partial investigation. For instance, it will
be entirely unsatisfactory for the Commissioners
to ascertain the amount paid in salaries to officials,
the amount consumed in influencing legislation and
the amount charged for legal expenses without in
quiring as to the sums which have been paid to news
papers as a consideration for their silence.
There is a rumor that a certain journal in this city
has a "pull" with the Commissioners by which it will
be enabled to suppress all yiquiry by them concern
ing the journalistic operations of the Southern Pa
cific Company. We do not credit this rumor. If
such an influence exist we doubt whether the mem
bers of the board would be as anxious as they appear
to be to precipitate an inquiry, because it is abso
lutely certain that if the investigation proposed is un
dertaken everything will come out. Somebody will
be present to ask concerning the expenditures of the
corporation for newspaper silence, even if the Com
missioners themselves shall be opposed to exploit
ing that branch of the subject.
Besides the $1000 a month paid to the Examiner
for twenty-two months of editorial complaisance
upon Southern Pacific subjects, we are informed that
the same sheet was paid $7000 for publishing Colonel
Creed Haymond's address before the Senate Com
mittee on Pacific Railroads, $5000 for keeping its
hands off the Pattison Pacific Railroad investigation
and $2500 for a blooded colt which Senator Stan
ford lost in an attempt to do business with the pro
prietor of the sheet. Here is $36,500 expended by the
corporation for illegitimate purposes. We are in
formed also that during a single year, not very long
ago, the corporation declined to collect a bill of over
$30,000 for transportation from the same journal.
These matters are of serious moment, and if the
money of the corporation is being wasted as they
seem to indicate surely the Railroad Commissioners
should put the facts on record. Indeed there will be
no excuse for them if they do not. If they ignore the
subject in pursuance of a political or other "pull"
which the Examiner is alleged to have with them it
will be to their immeasurable discredit. There is a
rule of evidence which provides that when a fact is
asked for in testimony the opposition is entitled to
bring out all the other facts bearing on the matter.
This rule should be adopted by the Railroad Com
missioners in their proposed investigation.
WAR TAXES AND PATRIOTISM.
rOLLOWING its custom and practicing anew
its old trick of trying to win favor with the
masses by asserting that the Government deals
unjustly with them, the Examiner of yesterday made
an attempt to excite class prejudice against the Gov
ernment by denouncing the war revenue bill as an
imposition upon the poor. Among other things it
said:
"The most telling criticism on the bill is that it is
a tax on poverty and not on wealth. There is more
truth' than fancy in this indictment. The taxes on
! beer, on tobacco, on coffee and on tea, which are
; estimated to bring in two-thirds of the income fur
i nished by the measure, will be paid for the most part
by those who are not to be classed among the
j wealthy. The tax on financial transactions will in
; part come from wealth, but it is unfortunately true
that but little of the taxes for the war will come out
of the great accumulations of capital."
Having prepared this appeal to poverty for its edi
torial columns, the Examiner took care not to publish
yesterday any report whatever of the debate on the
I bill in Congress. Had it done so the fallacy of the
attack on the measure would have been exposed, for
; the whole tone of the discussion showed that the ob
jections made to the bill were not directed, as the
: Examiner says, to the imposition of taxes on poverty,
; but to the feature of the bill providing for a bond
issue.
It is not true that "the taxes on beer, on tobacco,
on coffee and on tea are estimated to bring in two
thirds of the income furnished by the measure." The
bill makes no provision for any tax on either tea or
coffee. The tax proposed on fermented liquors is
estimated to yield $35,000,000. That on tobacco and
cigars $20,000,000. These amounts do not constitute
twe-thirds of the proposed $100,000,000 revenues by
any means. The stamp taxes on business documents
alone are expected to yield $30,000,000, and in addi
tion there are taxes on tonnage and taxes on wines
and mineral waters, the income from which has not
been estimated, but which is certain to be large.
It is gratifying to note that in making this attempt
to arouse class antagonisms over an important meas
ure of the war the Examiner represents no party.
Patriotic Democrats and Populists will alike repudiate
the yellow scheme. General Wheeler of Alabama, a
Democrat of the strictest school of his party, gave ex
pression to the loyalty of Democracy when he de
clared on the floor of the House that while he dis
liked the bond feature of the bill he would neverthe
less vote for it, because in times of war there should
be no partisan opposition to measures of war.
The whole issue was well summed up by Hender
son of Iowa: "Taxation there must be. The step we
have taken has cut down our revenues. All our esti
mates are gone. We need men, bullets and cash.
Let us move up like brothers. Let us have no this
side nor that side, no Republicans, no Democrats.
Let us fold up our campaign speeches and back up
the steps we have taken by giving cash without re
serve"
Governor Leedy of Kansas may be doing the best
he knows how. It must be remembered that the gen
tleman has never been supposed to know much. But
a Governor who at this time so checks the ambitions
of National Guardsmen to enlist that they burn him
in effigy ought to hire his office boy to do his think
ing for him.
John J. Ingalls gives out a delicate intimation that
as Secretary of State he would have filled a want felt
a long time by an ex-Senator who is now engaged in
putting extra thick splotches of yellow on daily jour
nalism.
Spain still calculates to use some of her cruisers
now near Manilla to scour the Pacific. The chances
are that the Pacific will be obliged to get along as
best it may unscoured.
When Roosevelt's cowboys reach Havana it would
be unseemly for them to ride up the steps of the
palace, but the colonel will have hard work to re
strain them.
Spanish tactics do not seem to have changed yet.
With unabated fervor the Dons continue their prac
tice of robbing the starving.

UNHAPPY SELECTIONS OF NAMES.
How Some of Our Newly Acquired Vessels Are
HandicaDDed in This Renard.
SEVERAL of the names selected for
the vessels recently acquired by the
navy are not alone inappropriate, but
in two cases, at least, probably the
worst that could have been chosen and
are not likely to make the respective
ships' companies proud of their vessels.
The yacht Alicia has been renamed
Hornet, of which there have been four
in the 'navy. The first belonged to the
revolutionary navy, and was blown up in
Delaware Bay in 1777 to prevent her cap
ture. Hornet No. 2 was a transport dur
ing the Tripolitan war, and was sold in
1806. Hornet No. 3. a brig of IS puns. 440
tons and carrying 140 men, performed gal
lant services during the war of ISI2-15,
and her numerous captures and actions
with superior ships, notably with the
Peacock and Penguin, were highly cred
itable to the navy, but her loss with all
hands in 1529 brought mourning into many
homes. Hornet No. 4, a small schooner
used as a dispatch vessel on bays and
rivers, was broken up in 1820. With the
loss of the Hornet in 1829 the name dis
appeared from the navy list.
The yacht Hermione is henceforth to be
known as the Wasp, making the fifth of
that name. The first was blown up in
Delaware Bay in 1777. The second Wasp was
captured at sea by the British October 13,
IXI2, taken into the navy and subsequent
ly lost. Wasp No. 3, known by its gal
lant action with the Frolic and other
heroic engagements, was lost at sea with
all hands in ISI4. A side-wheeler, Emma
Henry, was captured December 8, 1864,
and taken into the navy under the name
of Wasp, sent to tho South Atlantic sta
tion, where she lay for a number of
years off Montevideo, and was finally
sold in 1876 for a nominal sum.
The yacht Almy has been renamed
Eagle, and will be the fourth In the navy
of that name. The tlrst and third were
sold in ISOI and 1524 respectively and the
second was captured June 3, 1813.
The tug E. P. Luckenback, now called
Teeumseh, recalls the fate of the monitor
Tecums.'h before Mobile August 5, 1564,
when BhÂ« was blown up by a torpedo and
93 officers and men were drowned.
To the torpedo boat purchased in Ger
many the name Somers has been given.
A schooner by that name was captured
in Lake Ontario August 12, 1814, by the
Hritish. The second Somers has a his
tory which is the only blurred page in
American naval history. She was a brig
of 10 guns and 2')9 tons, built at New
York in 1842, and sailed on her lirst cruise
in September of the same year with a
crew of 120, of which 96 were apprentice
boys. Commander A. S. Mackenzie and
seven other officers had charge of the
ship, and it was not until in the vicinity
of St. Thomas, homeward bound, that
any trouble hod manifested itself. On
November 26 Commander Mackenzie re
ceived information that one of the mkl
shlpmen contemplated mutiny, and Philip
Spencer, midshipman; Small, boatswain's
mate, and Cromwell, seaman, were ar
rested. A court-martial was convened,
which found the prisoners guilty without
bringing them before the court, and three
days later the' unsuspecting prisoners
FABLES WITHOUT MORALS,
Observing the tone of a European
press to be hostile a citlzr:i asked a
President what he thought about it.
"Really," responded the President, af
fixing his signature to a declaration of
war, "I have l^ad important things to
think about and had not noticed the
matter you speak of."
Thereupon the citizen went his way
convinced that the long-distance bluff
was not fully appreciated in this coun
try.
A circus poster blown from Its posi
tion by a spring zephyr chanced to meet
a Yellow Journal.
"My only regret," said the Poster,
scraping some disfiguring paste from
its back, "is that I am not so consti
tuted as to wear a hat that I might
take it off to you as a bigger liar than
myself, who aforetime was reckoned
the prince of all liars."
"I also have had regrets on a similar
score," replied the Yellow Journal po
litely, "not that I would take a hat
off even to you, but I sometimes feel
the need of it to talk through."
Such conversation .s might have en
sued was cut short by a garbage man
who at this juncture loaded the pair
into a convenient receptacle for trash.
Accosting an ex-President a fresh
and blithesome reporter asked him his
opinion as to war with Spain.
"I am free to tell you," answered the
ex-President, "that the weather is
fine."
Thanking him cordially the reporter
were informed by the captain himself
that they had only ten minutes more to
live, and at the hour named they were
hanged from the yardarm. There was a
profound sensation in New York when
the Somers arrived thirteen days later,
and the news of the triple execution
spread. Philip Spencer was the son of
the Secretary of War under President Tv
ler. The parents of the 17- year-old boy
were naturally distracted, and they and
their friends had an Inquiry brought
about by the Secretary of the Navy, who
appointed a board for that purpose.
Owing to the partisan feofing, which at
that time was highly antagonistic, pub
lic opinion was swayed and confused by
the press and statesmen in Congress.
Colonel lienton and Fenimore Cooper con
demned and the New York Tribune and
Charles Summer commended Mackenzie's
course. The naval court acquitted the
commander, but when the trial was to

The only New Orleans we have had in
the navy was a llne-of-battle ship- of
seventy-four guns and 2805 tons, begun
at Sacketts Harbor, Lake Ontario, in
1S15 ? but never launched. She was sold
with twenty other vessels in 18S3, realiz
ing $427, although the nuik was only ap
praised at $200. During the course of de
molition a part of the hulk toppled over,
killing one man and injuring several
others.
The two cruisers purchased from Brazil
have been named New Orleans and Al

taches to the first name, but of the lat

disappeared in 1864, taking down with her
210 men, of which fourteen were officers. |
There was a second Albany, built under |
the name of Contocook in 1864, at a cost j
of $984,055, which was sold in 1572 for \
$48,000, being exactly one year one month I
and ten days in commission.

There was a steamer called the Algon

which turned out a lamentable failure.
She was sold in 1869 for $30,000, her ma

as a fertilizer manufactory for many
years in New York harbor, and was fin

sought another ex-President and put to
him the same question.
"Since you mention it," was the po
lite rejoinder, "the day is a little chill
for this season of the year. It is al
ways a delight to me to talk with a
journalist. Good day."
Greatly enlightened the reporter went
to his desk and wrote an interview two
columns in length.
A female who glories in being an an
archist and makes shrill acclaim of
her rabid state was detected shrieking
from the rostrum that in this land there
is no such thing as liberty.
"Will you kindly explain," asked a |
voice, "how It happens then that you
are not in jail?"
"In discussing the problem of life,"
resumed the female, "I decline to be
pinned down to the consideration of
paltry details."
She then proceeded to demonstrate j
how the blessed boon of liberty could \
be secured through the simple process
of hanging the President.
An emissary of the Government, hav
ing been dispatched to a foreign land
on a task of great danger, was be
trayed to a yellow correspondent, who
straightway exploited the scheme to the
delight of the enemy who sought the
emissary with intent to slay him.
"Meddlesome knave," said an indig
nant official to the correspondent,
"would you have a brave countryman
shot?"
"Be assured that I would." replied
the correspondent, "I would shoot him
myself at regular space rates."
Then did that official marvel greatly
that he could find in law no warrant
for suspending the correspondent by
the thumbs.
In the heat of debate a Magulre made
assertion that the acts of the Govern
ment, from whose treasury he draws
pleasing sustenance, were acts of pira
cy, and these remarks one versed in
shorthand made bold to set down.
Thereafter were they printed that all
might see. When the Magulre ob
served them in cold print he was great
ly perturbed of his peace, making loud
lament.
"Verily," quoth he, "a man may bi
divers kind of an ass and never wot
him as to his own condition, save ha
see the same portrayed in type."
An Uncle owning a fair land thr>
which was known to the world as
Florida, heard once on a time that
there was coming a haughty Don with
purpose to possess the same and to
hold it for his own uses.
"Are you beset with fear lest the
Don carry out his evil purpose?" asked
a nephew.
"The emotion which excites me," the
Uncle made answer, "is not that of
fear, but admiration. I had never
hoped to live to witness a display of a
cheek adamantine so that nothing less
than a 13-inch gun would have ten
dency to mar its contour."
Shortly after speaking, he command
ed his trusted men that they go forth
with guns of this caliber and make
essay to batter the cheek of the Don.
Yet had he misgivings, "for," commun
ed he with himself, "the ammunition
wherewith my guns are made ready
has been tested by nothing more fear
some in its hardness than Harveyized
plate."
Having caught a nickel-in-the-slot
machine a policeman threatened it
with arrest as being the wicked instru
mentality of a game of chance.
"It is evident," retorted the ma
chine, with ill-concealed contempt,
"that you have never played me."
Stung by the tone of the accused,
the policeman dropped in a dollar's
worth of nickels, getting as he him
self thereafter made declaration, "not
a bean."
"I did you an injustice," he remarked
to the machine,- with deference doffing:
his helmet and bowing low. "As a
game you offer no chance whatever.
But," he added, drawing a club, "you
are under arrest for highway robbery."
For he was a just man.
"Alas," exclaimed a trusted official,
who had been caught stealing, "what
have I done?"
"The people," replied one who was
there and dearly loved a jest.
"This is no time for unseemly lev
ity," the trusted official retorted, with
dignity. "Truly my outcry comes
fro-m the heart torn of grief and peni
tence. I have brought upon myself
sorrow and disgrace."
Then were his hearers touched, and
abjured him to make no moan, saying:
"When one repenteth him of his
wrongs then will much be forgiven."
Yet did their consolation fail to reach
the spot, for the grief of the man was
not that he had taken the spoil, but
that in his haste he had left aught be
hind.
Inflating his chest so that a broad
side of brass buttons flew therefrom,
a Spanish admiral announced that he
would scour the Pacific.
"Do so if you wish," said an Amer
ican admiral, who had chanced to
overhear, "but I must ask that you
scour the bottom of it. I have myself
a contract to attend to the surface."
The Spanish admiral then explained
that he had merely sprung a Castilian
joke, and the wake he left behind him
would have swamped any craft ven
turing near, even as the billows of the
tempest when it roars.
A director of schools made boast
that during his term he had accom
plished much. Being pressed for par
ticulars, he was for a little time at a
loss.
"Tell us one simple thing," they be
sought him.
"Truly, you are a lot of dullards,"
he retorted, "not to perceive for your
selves that I have kept out of jail."
Then did they make sorrowful ado,
as those who have been humbled in the
dust, and as they so beseemed them
selves the triumphant director walked
across the street to avoid meeting a
policeman, lest his record be marred in
the hour of victory. H. J.

Public School Pupils Anx
ious to Fly the Red
Cross Flag.
Patriotic Ladies of Oakland Call a
Mass-Meeting to Organize
a League.
THE public schools are preparing !
to be mustered into the Red j
Cross army.
Yesterday a number of the
principals of the high schools :
and grammar schools were in consul
tation with their teachers as to- the
\\ is^st plan of securing that which all
agree is a natural and desirable end â
the co-operation of the school children
of San Francisco with the Sanitary ;
Commission and Red Cross League.
As a principal in charge of one of the i
best disciplined schools in the city
s.ud yesterday, "It is at once a lesson !
in patriotism and in altruism, to be
permitted to work for the comfort of
our men who have gone to the front." i
The question that is being agitated '
In the School Department is, "How can j
the best and fullest results be secured :
without distracting the attention of !
the children from their studies?" J
When this problem has been solved the ;
- I children of Pan Francisco will
the banner of the Red Cross and |
enlist in n body. Some of those in j
charge of schools, however, are already I
preparing to coin into a Red Cross
fund the talents of the gifted young !
cans whose ardor requires the '
conservative rein of maturer years to ;
â¢it war talk and love of country
from occupying all their time and
thoughts.
It is an interesting sight these days
to watch the "Salute to the Flag,"
which only six months ago was ren
dered by the older pupils in a rather
perfunctory manner. Nowadays,
though, every morning while the
schoolyards are crowded, just as the
boys and girls are standing ready to
enter upon their day's work, the flag
runs out along the pole. From six to ,
fieht hundred bright faces are turned
upward to watch the stars and stripes :
stream out upon the morning air. as
many eager hands are raised in salute,
and from the hundreds of youthful
dOmea the loyal chorus:
"I pledge allegiance to my flag and
to the republic for which it stands;
one country, one people, one flag."
It requires only intelligent direction
to transform each and every one of
these eani"st young patriots into quite
as enthusiastic auxiliaries of the Red
Â» 7ross League.
SHOULD BE
ORGANIZED.
Dr. Lane Believes Much Suf-
fering Can Be Prevented
by the Red Cross.
"I believe a great and noble ana good
work Â« an !Â»â  done by the organization of
h Red Cross League and Sanitary Com
mission," said Dr. Lane, the president of
'â ;.â¢â !â  Medical College and the Lane
Hospital, yesterday. "Such an organiza
:n time of war. is greatly needed
and it can be of the greatest utility.
"I have spent three years In the tropics
on board a man-of-war a.nd have experi
enced the unhealthful climatic conditions
that prevail in and about Cuba at this
time of the year. Ido not believe young
women should be permitted to face the
insidious dangers of that region during
the disease season. The weather is very
trying and strangers are almost sure to
be disabled by fevers. Even on ship
board it is impossible to keep from in
fection, and on the vessel I was on, even
though the greatest precaution was ta
ken, we had many cases of fever to care
for. If Cuba should be invaded by Amer
ican forces ] do not believe the soldiers
who are attacked by the fevers will be
allowed to remain there. It is only a
few hours' run to the more hospitable
shores of America, and I think it will
be the policy of the army sanitary corps
to establish hospitals along the Atlantic
seaboard, where they will be easily
reached, and all sick will be taken tp
them by hospital ships as soon as it is
possible to get them away from the in
fected districts. In those hospitals there
will be much need for trained nurses,
both men and women, and It is well to bÂ«Â»
prepared by organization.
"It will be the duty of the Government
to care for the hospitals, but many
skilled and trained nurses will be re
quired and it is a good idea of the Red
Cross League to have a corps of them
ready to be sent wherever they may bo
needed at the command of the medi
cal department of the army. Those
nurses, should they be called, should go
well equipped, and while they are ser
vice they should be properly 'provided
for. That can best be done through the
channels of the Red Cross League. The
Sanitary Commission should be ready to
furnish needed supplies for the hospitals
should the equipment from the Govern
ment prove inadequate or insufficient."
WILL PERFECT
ORGANIZATION.
Oakland Red Cross League
Calls a Mass-Meeting
for Sunday.
There will be a big mass meeting Sun
afternoon at 4 o'clock at the First
Congregational Church in Oakland, when
]i!;ms will be perfected for the perma
nent organization of a Red cross society
to embrace all Of Oakland. Not only will
the churches of all denominations be rep
resented, but also the various fraternal,
literary and philanthropic societies, two
delegates to be sent from each.
Mrs. Granville Abbott will preside at
this meeting and will be assisted by Rev.
Charles R. Brown. A One programme
of patriotic music has been arranged to
be sung by choruses from the various
i hurcb.es.
This decision was reached yesterday
morning at a meeting of the executive
committee of the Red Cross Society, as
at present organized, which was held in
rooms "ox the Ebell Society. Mrs.
Granville Abbott was in the chair, witn
Mrs. Ronald P. Oleason as secretary. The
others present, Including Mrs. <;. \V. Bun
nell, vice-president, were Airs. F. B. Glun,
Mrs. A. B. Nye. Mrs. Giles Gray, Mrs.
Sol Kahn. Miss Babson, Mrs. B. Kinney
and Mrs. Franklin Bangs.
At the meeting to be held Sunday after
noon there will be a number of gentle
men speakers yet to be named, who will
be limited in their addresses to about live
minutes each. There will be a delega
tion of 200 school children present from
the Lincoln School, under the direction
of Principal T. O. Crawford. The speak
ers from the school will be Cornelia Strat
ton, daughter of Senator F. S. Stratton,
and Ray Coyle, son of Rev. R. F. Coyle.
Thus far about a hundred names "have
been placed on the roll, first among them
being those of Mrs. P. M. Smith and her
whole family. It is the intention, how
o\Tr, to have lists out by Sunday morn
ing and placed in every church in the
city, so that the people may sign them
before the afternoon meeting. These lists
will be circulated in all Catholic, Protest
ant and Jewish churches alike.
It is understood that there are to be no
dues or initiation fees required of those
who join the organization. The members
are to be banded together for help and
sympathy, and not until it is found that
there is a need for actual assistance will
lintmces be considered.

Secretary J. j> Wilson visited all of the
grammar schools in Berkeley to-day to
tak.- steps toward forming an auxiliary
organization at each school. The idea
was taken up enthusiastically, and in a
very short time it is expected that every
public school in Berkeley will have its
junior auxiliary.
The officers of the commission will at
tend the general Red Cross meeting in
San Francisco next Monday evening,
when some definite plan of affiliation with
the general society will be formulated.
Meetings of the Berkeley commission will
be held, at which Drs. Greenleaf, East
man and Rowell, who constitute the med
ical board of the commission, will speak.
Dr. Greenleaf will begin the series of
talks next week with some instructions
on "How to Prepare Bandages."
This Week's Wasp.
The Wasp appears this week in a new
| and attractive cover with over twenty
pages replete with interesting reading,
and attractive and timely cartoons and il
lustrations. The cover is exceptionally
original and characteristic of the paper.
The cartoons, of which there are a num
ber, are all well drawn and clever in con
ception. One depicts the statue of Queen
Isabella and Columbus in the State Capi
tol animated with fear at the terrible
warlike appearance of Governor Budd.
Mayor Phelan and Auditor Broderick are
tli" central figures in another cartoon re
lating to the recent defalcation of the late
Treasurer Widber. The proposed alliance
of England and America and the results
to the United States of such a step is
happily caricatured. The Old Ifaid'i
Diary relates entertainingly about the
latest feminine fad. The musical criti
cisms by Professor R. A. Lucchesi will
be read with considerable interest. In the
"Social Side Lights," Paul Pry relates a
story of a millionaire who sold his moth
er's tombstone. The Professor in "Under
the X Hay" treats of some literary cater
pillars who try to flutter on borrowed
wings. Altogether this week's issue of
j the Wasp is an exceptionally attractive
and interesting number. â¢
Missionary Congress.
The missionary congress to be held in
Calvary Church on Friday, May 6, prom
ises to be an occasion of great Interest.
An excellent programme will be given
and a number of distinguished speakers
and singers will be heard. The topic for
the morning session will be "What Would
the Union of All Christian Effort Do for
the World?" In the afternoon there will
be two subjects: "What Lines of Home
Work Will Best Promote Work in Foreign
Fields?" and "How to Strengthen the
Forces." Miss Ackerman will speak in
the evening.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 30, 1898.
HOW BUSINESS WAS RENEWED.
Erasure of the Word ''Spanish" Restored Confidence.
Once more a Spanish ensign has been obliterated, and on this occasion it
happens to be local. For many years past Jose Pages has been reaping an
enviable harvest In a restaurant entitled La Castllla, Spanish Restaurant,
but since the Maine was shattered to atoms, the proprietor has been watch
ing developments with a great deal of Interest, as the sign which was so
courageously shown during war times was a source of annoyance to all who
were employed In the establishment. After many days of thought it was
decided to allow the sign of the Spanish restaurant to remain, but now new
tactics will have to be brought into execution to make the business a pay
ing one.
When the eagle screamed thÂ© proprietor noticed that very 'ew of his old
customers seemed to be desirous of eating breakfast, and when they did not
appear at the noon hour and again In the evening, the "boss" of the shop
became alarmed that his old-time friends might starve. In consequence he
went forth and found a few stragglers and discovered, much to his regret,
that the sign above the door was the reason that his favored few had sought
other quarters for their food, as they feared dynamite might be smuggled
in with mush, crab or any other old thing. They were fully aware that
many of Spanish descent were working in the establishment, and hence the
fright which seemed to possess them.
A few brave ones continue to satisfy their appetites in the restaurant,
but as the daily papers were placed before them, showing the status of
affairs as existing between the two countries, the codfish bails seemed to
rest upon their digestive organs with a dyspeptic force truly remarkable. It
was at this point that the proprietor of the establishment realized that some
thing desperate should be done, and in the hours of darkness a man crept
forth from the door of the place in question with a large bucket of darkly
hued paint and wiped the Spanish phrase from the face of the earth, or in
other words, from the sides and front of the knuildiiiK- Now trade is pick
ing up and the owners of the place realize that the feeling in the American
breast is at white heat and that something "might" have been doing had
not the painter done his work well and under cover of darkness.
The top of the building where the word "Spanish" once shone forth in
glittered letters is now a darkened and unrecognizable mass, and the sides
of the building, although worried by the painter's brush, still show traces of
the old sign which for years was anxiously searched for by those who in
times gone by smacked their lips at the thought of a good old Spanish
dinner. It is rumored the painter who obliterated the signs was paid a
goodly sum for risking his neck while climbing to lofty heights in the
darkness, for the purpose of doing the work necessitated by the business
status of the proprietor of the one-time La Castilla, Spanish Restaurant.

"One night I was bound to the timber
and began struggling while the two vil

flashing along the shining barrel were a

"The theater was in an uproar in a mo

CALIFORNIA'S
YEAR OF GOLD
The Figures for the Year
Are Now on the
Record.
Statistician Yale Says the Dry
Season Lessened the
Product.
Tho Golden Stato Takes Second Rank
for Once, but Its Primacy Will
Soon Bo Regained.
The official record of California's gold
product for 1597 is made up, and it is
$10,181,401. This is $1,310,161 less than the
State record for 1K96, and about the same
as the United States Mint record for that
year.
Charles G. Yale has been the. statistician
of both the San Francisco Mint and the
California Mining Bureau for several
years, as he is now. His estimate of the
gold and sliver production of ' California
is the final State record, but it is always
subject to revision at Washington as the !
Government record for this State.
Last ear Mr. .Yale's estimate of over
$17,000,000 was cut down nearly $2,000,000.
Mr. Yale's figures are based on written
and confidential returns from* every gold
producer in the State, large and small,
whose address is obtainable, supplemented
and corrected by all the collateral infor
mation he can gather and his own judg
ment derived from his acquaintance with
the industry in this State.
The Director of the Mint collects in
dependent returns from the mints, smelt
ers and refineries only, and on these fig
ures has always cut down the State esti
mate, taking no heed of the amounts
shipped to China by the Chinese, the
amounts going directly to the useful arts,
safes, etc. In many ways the figures of
the Director of the Mint have always
done California an injustice. This year
Mr. Yale has made what appears on the
surface to be an ultra-conservative esti
mate. The year has seen an immense in
crease in the gold mining activity of the
State, but, on the other hand, the result
ing increase has been, perhaps, more than
balanced by the great loss of production
consequent on the general lack of water,
which for months has halved or stopped
the operations of many of the biggest
hydraulic and quartz mines in the State.
The season's lack of water has undoubt
edly cost the State $3,000,000 or more in
gold production.
Silver never cut much of a figure in
California, and never will, but it is in
teresting to note under all the circum
stances th#t the" product shows an in
crease of 130,325, commercial value, over
the product of $422,463 in 1896. The yield
of the State by counties for 1897 and 1896
is as follows:

In 1596 there were seven counties of the
State that produced over a mimon dol
lars, and one of these yielded over two
millions. In 1897 there were but six mil
lion dollar counties, and none of them
reached the two million mark. Nevada
County, which held the place of honor
in 1896 in bullion product, still maintains
its position in 1597. But Tuolumne Coun
ty, which ranked No. 7 in IS9O, takes sec
ond place this year, displacing Placer,
which is now third on the list. Calaveras.
which was third, is now fourth in rank.
Amador also drops back one nlace. being
now fifth Instead of fourth. Trinity,
which was tilth last year, is sixth, in
1N97 holding the pl;\ce Sisklyou did the
previous year, the latter county dropping
nut of the list of million dollar producers
for the time at least.
Investigation has been made into the
origin of bullion, whether from alluvial
washings or veins. It is found that vein
mining very greatly leads not only one
but all forms of K<>ld washing combined.
The figures of California in 1897 are as
follows:
Quartz mining, $11,390,1X0: surface
placers, $2,379,911: hydraulic mines, $1,351,
088, and drift mines. $1,203,058. In the
quarts total is Included the silver outnut
of ?i'.J.7 w ' 1 . commercial value. From cop
per ores included In the quartz column
the product of gold was $149,406 and of sil
ver $;i.V.C'v From silver-lead ores, mainly
in Inyo and Mono counties, the gold prod-
UCI w.is $14,801 ;md the silver $.14,100.
Figures collected by the Mint also show
approximately the number of men en
gaged in precious metal mining in the
State for the year 1597. The number
given is 16.783. as compared wilh 16,790 in
the previous year.
MISSION ROWDIES IN JAIL.
A Gang of Toughs Make a Brutal
Assault on a Scavenger.
A gang of Mission toughs assaulted an
old scavenger named John B. Rappo at
Twenty-sixth and Valencia streets last
night about 7 o'clock.
The old. man's cries for help attracted
the attention of Officers C. T. Merchant
,md E. Thomson, who hastened to the
scone. On their arrival Ihe gang broke
and ran away. The officers succeeded in
capturing John Tyrrell and Thomas
Stan ton. Tyrrell showed fight to the offi
cers, but was speedily silenced by the ap
plication of a club which eamr in con
tact with his scalp. The contact made a
slit in Tyrrell's cranium, which was
brought to by the use of a needle and
thread In the City and County Hospital,
whore he was taken for treatment.
Hoth prisoners were booked at the
Sfvonteenth-street station on the charges
of battery and vulgar language.

LOCAL WARRIORS GETTING READY
VOLUNTEER
TO FIGHT
National Guardsmen All Along
the Line Step Forward
and Sign the Roll.
An Active Day at Headquarters â Messages
Wired From the War Department
Smooth the Way for Speedy
Action in Mustering In
State Troops.
An Important order was issued from
the headquarters of the National Guard
late yesterday afternoon. It clearly
shows the present status of the situa
tion as regards the mustering of the
guard into service, and also clearly
cites the Governor's position upon the
much agitated question of regimental
preservation, which just at present is
the all absorbing topic in military
circles. The order is to the brigadiers,
and reads as follows:
To brigade commanders, N. G. C: I
am directed by the commander in cliief
to communicate the following to you for
the information and guidance of all con
cerned. Telegraphic Information has just
been received stating that the orderdetail-
Ing United States mustering officer was is
sued this day. Detailed instruction?,
blanks, etc., are now en route by mail
from Washington, D. C, and until they
arrive the muster cannot begin; all that
can be done until that time Is for all men
desiring to volunteer to sign rolls now
with the captains, restrain their anxiety,
and await patiently the proper time for
the muster, which will then be expedl
tiously proceeded with. All existing regi
mental and company officers, so far as
practicable and are Qualified physically
and otherwise, will be retained in their
present positions if their organization is
called out.
A. W. BARRETT. Adjutant General.
Company commanders will publish the
above ti> their companies, and post in
conspicuous place in their armories.
Brigadier General, Commanding Brigade,
N 'i. C.
The following dispatch was received
by Adjutant-Genoral Barrett yesterday
afternoon:
Los Angeles, Cal., April 29, 1898.
Brigadier General A. W. Barrett. San
Francisco, Cal: Companies A, B, L and I
rolls complete, one hundred each. All
others will be complete with like number
to-night. Officers' applications waiting
medical certificate.
C. P. A. LAST, Brigadier General.
Governor Budd said that the Na
tional Guard has now two completely
recruited regiments, the First and the
Seventh. Colonel Smith's regiment was
completed last night, and his comoanv
rolls handed In to General Barrett, and
those of the Seventh will no doubt be
received to-day.
This leaves everything practically in
readiness, and all that remains for the
National Guard is to await the Wai-
Department's orders from Washington.
Governor Budd shortly after noon
yesterday appointed Surgeon-GpnÂ«ral
Hopkins and Division Surgeon Gall-
Wey as members of the examining med
ical board to assist in examining the
volunteer surgeons.
The War Department authorized the
Governor to make these appointment.
It is not known what Government offi
cers will compose the board.
It would appear from Captain Car
rington's dispatch from General
Schwan that it is possible he may be
ordered by telegraph to proceed with
the mustering of the National Guard,
but the possibilities are that the mus
ter blanks have been sent by mail, and
in that case the guard will have to
â wait until the middle of next week be
fore they are placed on Uncle Sam's
payroll.
Governor Budd very naturally feels
the unmerited criticisms that have
been made upon his tactics in not or
dering out the Guard with a grand
hurrah, and sending them to immedi
ately storm Morro Castle. The fol
lowing presentation of the situation
shnws the case exactly as it is:
Governor Budd has been officially
notified by the War Department to
await his mailed orders from Wash
ington. Were he to order out the Na
tional Guard just to satisfy the war
like ambition of some over-zealous
patriots, he would directly break a
positive military order that has been
given him.
The ordering out of the Guard by
the Governor before he receives his
orders would mean an enormous ex
pense to the State and a prompt call
ing down of the Governor by the Gov
ernment. Governor Budd said yester
day:
"For the last time, I will say that I
am In constant communication with
the War Department and am rating
under my orders. I am enough of a
soldier to obey orders â not to break
them. The Government knows Cali
fornia's willingness to go to the front,
and when It is ready it will call upon
the State. I do not propose to take the
business of conducting this war out of
the Government's ha.'.ds."
Colonel D. B. Fairbanks of Peta
luma, commanding the Fifth Infantry,
and Colonel James Smith of the First
Infantry were at headquarters yester
day and were closeted with the Gov
ernor. Their visit was relative to busi
ness pertaining to their commands.
Captain Carrington received yester
day morning a dispatch from Assist
ant Adjutant Schwan at the War De
partment In Washington, D. C, in
forming him that orders had been is
sued detailing him to muster In Cali
fornia's quota of men, and that in
structions and mustering blanks would
follow by mall. The dispatch further
states that First Lieutenant Sidney
A. Cloman, Fifteenth United States In
fantry, now stationed at California
A BATTERY OF HIBERNIANS.
It Is announced that Father Crowley will go to the front as the chaplain
of the Hibernians, Wfalcfa order last night adopted the following resolutions
"Whereas, the United States, having become involved in a war with
Spain because of the efforts of the former to ameliorate the condition of the
people of Cuba; and whereas, millions of our race who were compelled by
Inhuman laws to leave the land of their birth, found a home and a field for
their labor in this the land of liberty: therefore, be it
"Resolved, That it will be our pleasurable duty to participate in safe
guarding our common country and defending Its flag; therefore, be it further
"Resolved, That we. the Ancient Order of Hibernians of San Francisco
organize at least one battalion of infantry, and that same be placed at the
disposal of the Governor of our State." '
University, will be detailed as acting
assistant quartermaster and commis
sary of subsistence. It further informs
Captain Carrington that his sugges
tion regarding the mustering in of
the troops as the Government is pre
pared to receive them has been ap
proved.
Captain John A. Miller, Lieutenant
F. Nippert and Sergeant F. L. Brown
of Company F, First Infantry, appear
ed before the Regimental Examining
Board last night, and were examined
preparatory to confirmation of their re
cent election.
Colonel Hopkins, Surgeon-General of
the National Guard of California, re
ported at headquarters last night, and
held a conference with General Barrett.
The conference was relative to the
business of the sanitary corps.
SEA BATTLES.
Plan of Naval Operations
Discussed at the Bur
nett School.
The principal of the Burnett School
yesterday gave a highly instructive les
son to the pupils of the ninth grade
on the Americo-Spanish war.
Mr. Stone served during the Civil
War in the Gulf squadron as ship's
clerk with Lieutenants Dewey and
Sampson, now admirals in charge of
the great American squadrons. Large
maps of Cuba, the Atlantic coast line
and Philippine Islands were used to
illustrate the principal's description of
the movements of the American and
Spanish fleets.
Arms and projectiles were also dis
cussed, and the means that would be
employed by ourcoast defenders in case
of an attack by a Spanish fleet on San
Francisco.
It is safe to say that the youngsters
will read this morning's Call with in
creased interest, following out the
lines of yesterday's lesson.
THE FIRST
RECRUITING.
Muster Rolls Being Turned
In â Men Wanted for
the Navy.
The emergency rolls of the First In
fantry were opened for signatures last
evening, and before 11 o'clock they were
all ready to be turned iijto the head
quarters of the regiment. From there
they will be forwarded without delay to
the Governor.
All the officers of the regiment have
already volunteered by personal commu
nication to headquarters, the certificate
of the surgeons of the guard in each case
accompanying the application for service.
The officers were examined Wednesday
evening and yesterday morning, and there
were but two in the regiment who were
not passedâ First Lieutenant Carrol and
Second Lieutenant White. Both Carrol
and White were rejected for constitutional
weakness.
Colonel Fairbanks and Lieutenant-Col
onel Whitton of the Fifth Infantry wore
in the city last evening, and they were
for some time in close conference with
the field officers of the First Infantry in
regard to the stand taken by the officers
of the First regarding their desire that
the regiment go to the front as an or
ganization. The officers from the Fifth
Regiment indorsed in every particular the
attitude of the officers of the First.
The companies of the First Regiment
are all recruited above the legal number,
so that in every case there is a reserve
list to draw from to till the places of the
men who cannot pass the examining sur
geons.
At the naval rendezvous there has been
a notice issued calling for volunteeers as
follows:
Chief machinists and first-class machin
ists for tugs for one year; first-class ma
chinists and first-class firemen for cruis
ers for three years; first and second class
firemen, oilers and seamen for tugs for
one year; seamen and ordinary seamen
for cruisers for three years; ordinary sea
men, landsmen, carpenters' mates, stew
ards' men, cooks and mess attendants
for tugs for one year.
These are men who will be needed In
the new mosquito fleet and on the cruis
ers Charleston and Philadelphia and the
gunboat Yorktown (now being repaired at
the Mare Island Navy-yard). Responses
to this call will begin to come within a
few days, and there Is no doubt enter
tained that when the vessels are ready
for sea there will be no lack of men to
man them.
OFFICERS BUSY.
One Hundred and Eleven
Men Added to the Rolls
Yesterday.
The recruiting office In the old armory
of the First Regiment was a busy place
yesterday. Recruits are coming In with

STEAMPHIP SERVICE.
The report from the East that the Pan
ama Railroad Company had suspended
steamer service between New York and
Colon on account of the war is denied by
Fred F. Connor, the agent of the line
in San Francisco. He received a tele
gram yesterday from the general office
announcing that the steamship Advance
would sail from New York for Colon on
Monday, May 2.
A BRITISH HURRAH!
To the Editor of The Callâ Sir: As an
Englishman I desire to express through
your columns the henrty good will of all
Englishmen for Uncle Sam in the present
crisis. It is undoubtedly true that sev
eral European nations are anxious to nip
this country's growing greatness In the
bud, and for this purpose have formed a
coalition against it, and but for the bold,
outspoken loyalty of England to the
United States their combined fleets would
to-day be lining up with those of Spain
to menace this "sweet land of liberty,"
progress and humanity, but they are re
strained by the attitude of the British
lion and dare not move, knowing that old
England is enthusiastically solid for
America, and that sixty millions of Eng
lishmen over the globe are promptly
ready to back up Uncle Sam to the last
man and ship, and; girdle the earth, if
need be, with a blinding sheet of flame
and hurricane of shot from red regiments
and gallant fleets in whole-souled sup
port ot bet splendid kith and kin. Back
to back Uncle Sam anu John Bull are
more than a match for "the world in
arms." and abundantly able to make a
dear path for liberty over the prostrate
forms of banded cruelty, despotism and
tyranny all around the earth. Let not
our cousins doubt for one instant (our
little "scraps" in the past notwithstand
ing) that old Enghind is with them when
deeded body, bouts and all. The hearty
and loyal friendship of England for this
country has long been a dead certainty.
When recently Italy seemed bent on
Bending her fleet to bombard* New York
an English admiral, on hearing the re
port, blurted out the significant words,
"Then, by , they must do It over the
hulls of my fleet." All England applaud
ed the sentiment to the echo; and to-day
that generous feeling is at whitest heat.
Being in communication with British
statesmen in highest authority I am war
ranted in asserting that at the smallest
overt act of European hostility the Eng
lish will roÂ«r "Hands off!" Till then
England will simply sta.nd at "atten
tion," assured that Uncle Sam needs no
more than her moral sympathy while in
dulging in the recreation o? polishing off
the bantam Dons; but I repeat, let the
fateful hour strike when practical aid is
needed and England unsolicited will leap
into the crowd, uplifting for crushing
blow a clinched hand that will overshad
ow and paralyze the vaunted "mailed
fist" of all Europe. I am positive, sir,
that I voice the unanimous sentiment of
Englishmen everywhere when in one of
the greatest American papers I claim
permission to raise the hearty Anglo-Sax
on cheer: "Hurrah for Uncle Sam! We
are with you! Go in and win!"

Fourth United States Cavalry
to Guard Powder Works
at Santa Cruz.
The Six Batteries of the Third Artillery and
the Squadron of Cavalry, Stationed Here,
to Be Immediately Recruited to the
Maximum Strength, Under
the New Law.
Orders received yesterday from the
Secretary of War and the department
commander, U. S. A., created a rapid
current of comment among the soldiers
stationed at tha Presidio. General Mer
riam wired Colonel Morris to detail a
troop of the Fourth United States cav
alry to proceed immediately to Santa
Cruz and establish a patrol around the
powder works of that place.
Late last night the detail of a troop
had not been made. It seemed to be
the impression that the order would
be amended requiring two troops for
the duty. The troopers when they ar
rive on the presmises will establish a
line around the works and permit no
person who cannot give a good account
of himself to cross the line.
The Fourth Cavalry men are elated
at the prospect of active servir \ The
idea of the infantry going to the front
and the cavalry remaining on the res
ervation struck the riders as the most
remarkable thing ever heard of. Yes
terday when the troopers were ordered
to parade to-day in heavy marching
order, fully equipped for the field, they
received a hint of prospective service
at the front.

THOMAS G. CARSON,
Second Lieutenant Fourth Cavalry, Ad-
Jutant.
Orders were received from the War
Department through department head
quarters early in the day yesterday,
which directed immediate recruiting: to
fill the United States army to the limit
authorized by law. Each of the six
regular batteries of the Third Artillery
on duty in this harbor will be filled up
to the strength of 200 men. 'This will
add 120 men to each battery. The op
portunity of serving in a regiment so
renowned as the Third Artillery, un
der officers so capable and with men
so proficient, may appeal to many
youngsters who are now seeking an op
portunity to serve the country.
Apart from the artillery service It is
noted that each troop of the Fourth
United States Cavalry is to be recruited
to the strength of 100 men. This will
give 200 fearless and active young rid
ers of California a chance to serve the
country under such gallant leaders as
Colonel Morris and Captains Benson,
Gale, Lockett and Neall. In due time
announcement will be made where men
may apply for service in the United
States army. The Presidio recruiting
office should be a busy station in view
of the authorized increase of the reg
ular army.

ABOUT BALL
"Ham" Iberg Emulates
the Rolling Stone in His
Restlessness.
"Youngus" Johnson Gets His
Price From Rochester and
Goes East.
Bad Umpiring at Santa Cruz Causes
thÂ« Boys to Use Language More
Forcible Than Elegant.
By Joe Corbett.
The first fame under the new league
will be played at Central Park Sunday.
It Js about time "Ham" Iberg signed
â¢with some club. His mysterious maneuv
ering from one club to another has caused
no little amount of speculation as to his
finish.
Manager Coffroth, In company with
Bushnell, the "photographic wonder," is
scouring the country in the vicinity of
Greenbrae. in the hope of securing a few
"knights of the ball field." It is said that
"Bushnell's ark," which plays tag wkh
the merry little wavelets in that neighbor
hood, contains many hidden treasures, as
well as "secrets," and it is hoped that
"Fairest James" unearths a good pitcher.
"Youngus" Johnson is the recipient of a
U-le.eram from the Rochester dub, ad
vising him to come East Immediately.
"\oungus" says that Rochester has at
last come around to his figure, and while
he hates to leave dear old Frisco, still
business is business, therefore, must Â£<â >.
His departure will be a serious losa to
the San Francisco dub, with whom he
had consented to play while in California.
Our "favorite" Hughes dropped a game
to the Brooklyns Wednesday, but he can
not be expected to win every game. The
Brooklyns, at times, are a hard crowd to
beat. They may go along in a "don't
care sort of a way" for a week, then
wake up and bat any pitcher. Then again
pitchers, especially youngsters, have oft*
days and are easy for any team. No
doubt after pitching that great game
â¢gainst Boston, the reaction set in, which
undoubtedly accounts for Wednesday's
defeat. It is to be hoped Manager Han
lon does not work this young man too
often at the start, as the weather back
there at present is not quite warm enough
for pitchers. bfcJames and Hugnes have
done nenrly all the box work so far, and
it Is about time Hanlon gave some of
those other "stars" an opportunity to
earn their salary.
Harvey, the crack pitcher of the Gilt
Edges, has received an offer from the
Pittsburg club of the National League.
He intends to remain in California this
however, yet is thinking very seri
ously of joining fast company next sea
son, and will no doubt uphold the glori
i.us reputation attained by former native
sons in the Ka-st.
Charley Sweeney, whose record as a
strike-out pitcher is yet to be equaled,
says his arm is gradually "rounding to,"
and that he will be able to use it to good ;
advantage before long.
Pitzpatrick, he who monopolizes the I
coach line every time the athletes cross
bats at Central Park, should apply for
a patent on that voice. Any player who
Should dare make a mlsplay when this
gentleman is doing his act should be sus
pended for life.
Every team that goes to Santa Cruz
seems to entertain the same grievanceâ
"poor umpiring." There are some very
raui^hty things said about the gentleman
who bundles the Indicator in that town,
and quite a number of players state that
it is almost impossible to win a game in
which he officiates. Such a state of affairs
El'ould not be tolerated, and the league
should furnish good umpires, proficient
enough in the game to give a correct de
cision, at least, once in a while. Have
good umpiring, and save trouble, dissatis
faction and a possible "riot."
One thing is certain, the teams now
composing the new league will have to
practice if they expect to play good ball. |
No player, no matter how good he might
be, can give a good account of him
self (unless through sheer luck) unless
ho devotes some of his leisure time to
practice. In the major league, players
must practice every day, barring Sunday,
from one to two hours, and very often
with this amount of practice put up an
inferior article of ball. Therefore the
managers of the various teams should in
sist upon their men practicing, for if
they do not, poor baseball will be the
inevitable finish.

The Speedy Canace Downed
Sombre in a Long Hard
Drive.
Valenclenne Had All Her Old Time
Spaedâ Throe Events Went
to Favorites.
The "surprise" stable of W. B. Jen
nings & Co. sprung another one yester
day at Ingleside. It was the brown colt
| Glorian, which turned up winner of the
mile and a sixteenth handicap at odds
of 10 to 1. Johnny Woods had the leg
up and with 94 pounds to carry the 3
year-old made an end-to-end affair of
it. winning all out at wire a neck before
! Fonsovannah, with Dick Clawson in the
saddle. Joe Ullman, the 2-to-l favorite,
; looked dangerous to the stretch, gallop
â  ing along in second place, but when
j Clayton called on him he could not re
spond and fell back beaten.
The racing throughout was a shade
off color and the attendance was hardly
up to the average. Favorites were suc
cessful in three instances.
Trappean, a 5-to-l chance, downed a
band of "dogs" In the opening five fur
long scramble. Oeloso looked to have
the purse won at the paddock, when
ShielJs on Trappean came wi.h a rush,
beating the Baldwin filly a head. Gran
dezia, the favorite, with Thorpe up was
third.
The event following, a five and a
: half furlong sprint, was another sec
i ond-hand affair. Amasi was made fa
vorite and as non^i of 4 i-<e "crabs" be
hind him could raise a gallop won all
!by himself. Pongo, a 25-to-l chance,
1 took the place from Gotlieb.
In receipt of weight from the 3-year
' old Valencienne it looked as though
1 Miss Lynah could pull off the six fur
: long selling event and she opened up a
i 4-to-5 choice. The wise ones, however,
. got aboard Valencienne, forcing her
I odds down from 5 to 2 to 3 to 2, at which
price Miss Lynah also closed. It proved
the subject and he will promptly an
swer: "I think about ten rounds will
wind Jeffries up."
Then he resumes his preparatory
work with renewed energy, to the great
physical anguish of his four assistants,
but the fixed look tells that his
thoughts are far fro;n the roadside
house on the beach, that punching
bags, pulleys, boxing gloves and dumb
bells have no place in his mind.
For Sharkey has heard the roar of
guns and the shriek of shells at Ma
tanzas an'i hearing them he listens for
more music of the same kind.
While he is preparing to pummel a
fellow citizen â or get pummeledâ brave
boys in blue are getting ready to wal
lop the Spaniards, and /hen he thinks
of this Sharkey wishes the whole thing
was over and that he was once more
on the gun deck of a man-of-war. Some
of the sailors in the fleet awaiting the
signal to bombard Havana were ship
mates of the pugilist once and Tom
frankly confesses that he would take
more pleasure in sharing with them the
prize money obtained from a Spanish
ship than in pocketing the purse hung
up for the v inner of next Friday's
event.
"Do I wish I was back in the ser
vice?" repeated Sharkey yesterday.
"You bet I do and if this scrap con
tinues I'll get there too. Only I shall
go East to enlist if I go back for I
wouldn't take chances on being tied
down to one of the ships 0:1 this coast.
If I go into the navy again it will be
to fight and not to be bottled up in this
port.
"Oh, it's all nonsense to talk about
those greasers whipping us in any kind
of a fight. I wouldn't want anything
better than to be one of the crew on
a gift for Valencienne, the filly gallop-
Ing away from the Jennings entry,
winning easily from Rebel Jack. Miss
Lynah was fourth behind Miss Ross.
Canaee, the shifty filly from the
stable of Nick Hall, took the six fur
long run for 2-year-olds in the gamest
possible manner from Sombre, the sec
ond choice. Taking the lead soon after
the start the winner was challenged by
Sombre in the run home and driving
hard from the furlong pole "Skeets"
Martin landed her winner from the Jen
nings entry n neck in 1:15)4. Owyhee
was third, a length in front of the fa
vorite. Milt Young.
Martin also piloted the winner of the
final race on the card, a mile and a fur
long run, dr-rided under selling condi
tions. He had the mount on Thelma,
the lukewarm choice, and keeping the
brown mare out in front all the way
downed San Marco over a length in
1:55^.
INGLESIDE STAKE TO-DAY.
Five Starters Will Face the Flag In
the Four-Mile Event.
The rich Ingleside Stake over four miles will
be the feature of the sport this afternoon. The |
field should furnish some rare guessing, as none
of the starters have eve"r been asked to go the
rout'-. Buckwa looks far and above the class
and should be able to win.
Eddie Ames, who piloted Montallade, was
susnomled. There was 7 to 1 offered in the
opening letting against the sprinter, and as his
preceding race, with Piggott up, when he fin
ished fourth, was an indifferent one, It looks
as though Holly's horse has simply gone stale. 1
At the conclusion of the racing the stewards
held a meeting, and Henry Mason, the trainer
of the fast colt Lobos, was reinstated. That ;
is, he can race at Ingleslde, but still remains
suspended at the track over the bay. Judge
Murphy demurred against the decision, think
ing Mnson deserving of punishment, but tue
majority rvled.
Miss Lyn&h pulled up bleeding slightly after
her 1:

MANHATTANS ENTERTAIN.
Bouts of a whirlwind nature were fur
nished to about 300 lovers of boxing last
evening by the Manhattan Athletic Club
in their rooms at 1745 Mission street. One
became so torrid that a police sergeant,
fearing a repetition of the Griffo-McCar
thy battle, ordered a halt in the middle
of the fourth round, just when the spec
tators were warming up to It.
After interesting preliminary three-
J round goes between Fred Schoenfeld and
1 J. L.ahey, Wood brothers, Gus Coster and
I Fred Muller, Joe Sullivan and Oscar Ilil
j ton, Yama and McDevltt, Ast and Magee
were disposed of, Young Muller, an elder
brother of the redoubtable Fred, and
Jack King, alias Roberts, entertained the
spectators with three rounds and a half
of arm swinging and ludicrous boxing.
The first round was filled in with long
distance sparring and grimaces, and the
second was a repetition of the first, with
the exception of a clean knockdown
I scored by King. In the third Brother
Fred tried to coach Brother Joe by mak
ing fistic motions, but it availed him not.
Early in the fourth King let out a kink
and swinging his right uppercut Muller
:in the eye, closing it. He then followed
1 him around the. ring administering blows
j which, had they landed, would have ended
! hostilities. It was then that the sergeant
; interfered and Keferee Wiggin awarded
j the decision to King.
Phil Green of Oakland (145) and Al Neu
! (145) were next to contest for supremacy
i but after four rounds of vicious fighting
I the bout was adjudged a draw. Green
was ovtr-anxlous and missed many heavy
i swings, while Neil, somewhat " cooler,
. awaited their coming, and would step in
; close and land. Both men fought evenly
\ and cleanly throughout the four rounds
; and their efforts were appreciated by the
i spectators.
It is expected that Matchmaker Mullei
will arrange a go between Lon Agnew and
Neil, to take place some time in May.

CHAMPION DOGS
WILL RUN
THIS AFTERNOON
Tho greatest coursing events of tho
season will be hold to-day at Union and
Ingleside Coursing parks. At the Union
the fastest dogs In the State have been
entered for tho championship stake, and
as they are all prize winners it would be
difficult to even hazard a guess as to the
probable winners.
Although coursing has prevailed on the
coast for many years the sport, as it is
now conducted by the two parks, practi
cally dates from the opening of Ingle-
Bide Coursing Park.
In years past the leashmen met at New
ark, at Ocean View and near Colma,
Many good dogs were then owned in the
State and not a few of the game old per
formers have left behind records that yet
live and by the owners of such are yet
referred to proudly. But the sport In
those days long gone was not always
what It has now become. The decisions
of the various judges were often ques
tioned. Dosing and "doping 'of candi
dates were then openly alleged. The ac-
commodations were poor. The sport was
not one catering to the attendance of
ladies. The prizes were small. And
when a prize had been won there some
times yet remained tho more important
matter of its collection.
Two years ago M. J. Donovan and Jack
Dalton entered into a and
opened the present coursing grounds at
Ingleside. The park was opened on May
3, 1896. Mr. Dalton was called to the great
majority only nine months later, but the
park, still owned jointly by his widow
and Mr. Donovan, and managed by the
latter, has elevated coursing to a plane
that In many ways is only equaled by
horse racing and in many other ways sur
passes the "sport of kings."
At the outset It was announced that
the racing must be absolutely without
taint ot fraud, that the accommodations
afforded and conduct maintained must be
such as to render the sport a pleasure
to even the most fastidious of both sexes,
and that tho prizes must be sufficiently
liberal to encourage the propagation of
the best stock in tne world. These rules
are yet maintained and no departure
therefrom has ever been permitted.
The Interstate Coursing Club of Cali
fornia was organized, embracing in its
membership the representative leashmen
of the State, and under its rules and reg
ulations has the park ever since been con
ducted.
Any attempt at fraud has Invariably
resulted in a prompt suppression of the
delinquent, ana If on investigation so or
dered by the club any one has been found
guilty of questionable practices his ruling
off tor life and the ruling off of his dogs
has always followed, no matter who the
offender might be.
The prizes hung up at the outset were
largely in excess of those previously ob
taining, and they have been constantly
Increased, until this weekâ the second
birthday of the parkâ the twenty-four
dogs will divide no less than ii-l-iv, the
winner alone receiving 5500.
All this has very naturaJly resulted In
the acquirement and breeding of remark
ably high-class stock. A list of the grace
ful longtails that have pulled down goodly
prizes during the two short years would
demand too much space. Many of the
old-timers have earned a trip around the
â¢world. Many new ones have sprung into
fame and annexed purses previously un
heard of in America.
Looking back over the meetings, the
Dean kennel looms most prominently to
the front. Dean has a quartetâMoon
dyne, Mialmo, Connemara and Gladiatorâ
that have won in prize money something
like a kings ransom. During the past
Six months at Ingleside they have won
JIU'A 1 , besides which Mialmo won the big
ifloou stake at Merced,
The Curtis stable showed up some re
markable youngsters about a year ago.
In June, July and August Cavalier and
Rosette took both fust and second money
In the sapling and puppy stakes wherein
they were entered. Rosette and Maud S
(another <if the same, litter,) did the sajnu
trick on Admission day, and Cavalier, yet
v puppy, wflu out the old dog event on
September 12. Maud S won the puppy
event on September 26, with Rosette third.
Rosette tOOK the Old dog stake October 10
and HI, ajid on the latter day Maud S was
â  I in the puppy scramble. Rosette
divided first and second with her kennel
mate in the old dog event December 26.
and Rosette pulled down like contests on
January 23 and February 0.
Lowe & Thompson's kennels have
loomed to the front of late, but the work
of Patriu and Victor is frt-ah in the minds
of all.
Magnet was a money-getter from the
opening of the park until last August,
and during that period was deemed very
near invincible. Since then he has seemed
to go back, but in his day won thousands.
Skyball, the speediest of them all In his
time, is now In the stud, with a long and
valuable list of brackets to his credit.

The Union Coursing Park, which is pos
sibly one of the greatest of its kind
in America or England, is only a few
months old, but since its Inauguration it
has made wonderful strides in gaining the
support and well wishes of all sportsmen
who take an active interest in coursing.
Judging by the enthusiasm manifested
by its patrons, it is safe to say that
Union Park is here to stay, and it goes
without saying that under the present
management leashmen can safely count
upon a fair field and no favor while the
grand old sport has a following in this
great Western State.
The prizes that have been paid to the
owners of the winning greyhounds since
Union Park opened its gates to pleasure
hunters are truly liberal.
As an illustration of what coursing is
to-day and the money that has been cap
tured by leashmen who are the fortunate
owners of fast dogs, the following table,
kindly furnished The Call by the park
management will attest:

CHAMPIONS ON
TRACK
AND FIELD.
This afternoon at the Olympic Club
grounds the Pacific Association of the
Amateur Athletic Union will try its met
tle on the track and field. Since the
memorable field day in the spring of 1*92,
when the Olympic Club athletes suc
cumbed for the first time to the men from
Berkeley, the Pacific Association has
been powerless to enlist teams from the
colleges and athletic clubs for a general
field day. Once again the association has
heaved itself out of a sea of inaction, and
the programme arranged for this after
noon contains the tlower and essence of
the athletic species centered around San
Francisco.
The entries are extremely numerous.
There are over 100 entries of fir.st-class
j material, some from the preparatory
J schools, but most of them from tho col
| leges. It will be a contest, in certain re
i spects, of the very young man against
1 the young man. Athletes whose gristle
has not yet hardened into bone will toss
the hammer and run races with men who
have earned for themelves records and
i laurel wreaths on the field and track. The
preparatory school athlete is carefully
j watched by the university man, for it is
; he who will help form the college team in
' the near future.
The majority of the entries are from
' the two universities, though the Amateur
! Athletic League will send a large quota.
j Perhaps the A. A. L. athletes are tho
most enthusiastic of all. The first oppor
tunity to meet the college men on an
equal footing is sure not to be neglected.
' Already they are scheming how to free/.,;
out some of the college men with reputa
tions as long as a hoe-handle. Stanford's
! and California's teams laugh derisively
jat the hopes and expectations of the
I "prep," thinking his chance to be solely
] one of mind. It is lmrdly probable that
i any first place will be captured by any
i A. A. L. entry, but there will be a few
I seconds and thirds on their list.
In the 100-yard sprint three athletes of
â¢ recognized ability will toe the scratch.
Abadie, Drum and Broughton are all
fleet-footed sprinters. Just what Abadie
will do when opposed to seasoned run-
I ners like Drum and Broughton is doubt
< ful. There are some who proclaim him
I the prospective winner. If so the time
! will be close to ten seconds, for Drum is
| a mercury on the cinders. Broughton is
I another short-distance runner of great
PROMINENT COURSING MEN OF THE STATE.
speed. The same conditions underlie the
220 and 440, all of which should be close
and interesting races.
In the long-distance events the best
talent of the State will enter. Smith of
Stanford, who ran the mile in 4 mm. 38 2-5
sec. last Saturday in the intercollegiate
games, will try for a new record. He will
have such men as Walker, Carpenter and
Jackson to tight against. This should be
one of the prettiest races of the day.
Both hurdles will probably go to Mor
gan of Stanford. His strongest opponent
is Dawson, who is hardly equal to the
performance of Morgan. A brace of
A. A. L. entries in both hurdle races will
show just how the "prep" stick-jumper
compares with the matured hurdler.
The field events promise some good
sport. In the hammer throw Bob Ed
gren, the erstwhile champion, will ap
pear. Edgren has returned fresh from
Eastern athletic successes. Plaw, an A.
A. 1,, man, and Guiberson of California
will be Edgren's strongest competitors.
A long list of names are entered in the
shot-put. The other field events show
good and plentiful material.
The games will begin sharply at 2
o'clock. John Elliott will referee. Wal
ter Scott will hold the starter's pistol,
and many of the now retired but once
famous athletes of the coast will judge
and time the events.
SWIMMING RACES

ranged an excellent aquatic programme

HEAVY-WEIGHTS
ANXIOUS
TO BOMBARD
"Well, who do you think will win the
big fight on Friday evening?"
This query Is asked by large numbers of
people, who are seemingly very much in
terested in the result of the great twenty
round fistic argument between the bold
sailor lad, Tom Sharkey, and the big and
powerful heavy-weight, J,im Jeffries.
It is very safe to say that the prognos
tioatore who can call the winner and will
play the game heavily will reap a rich
harvest of golden dollars, as the betting
gives promise of being extremely spirited.
Even money is now offered, and the pool
rooms are well supplied with coin, which
will be placed either wayâ take your
choice.
As to which of the great fistic punchers
will carry off the long end of the percent
age is a puzzle that is now bothering the
thinking-boxes of the wisest of the wise
sports.
The men who are sanguine of Jeffries'
success contend that the representative
from the orange groves Is the equal of his
opponent in boxing, ran hit a more, power
ful blow and is not so apt as the sailor
to shoot wide of his mark. Apart from !
this, they contend that Jeffries' great
weight, which will give him a handicap i
of at least thirty pounds over Sharkey,
and also the inches he will have in height,
Bhould prove a great advantage in his
favor.
Tom Sayers, who in his day was ad
mlred by the folowers of the prize ring
as being not only a wonderful master of
the game, but a man also of extraordi
narily ke*n judgment, <>!!<â¢Â»â  s;il<i that in
his opinion a prize-lighter who scaled
more than 175 pounds when in condition
and who In stature exceeded 5 feet 10
inches would never capture a champion-
ship.
But in the days of Sa.yprs and Heenan
the Queensberry rules seldom governed
a pugilistic contest. It was London prizo
ring rules that held sway in the days
when men fought to a finish on the turf
for amounts ranging in value from Â£50
($250) to Â£100 ($S0oÂ».
The offer of a $5000 purse would simply
mesmerize any of the champion pugilists
of fifty years ago, who thought that the
capture of 100 guineas was something a
pugilist could feel deservedly proud of.
But what a change has occurred in the
interest of the game in the past ten years!
It was the old California Athietlc Club
of this city that started the boom in
purses, and competition since then has
raised the price until now a first-class
"scrapper" can command more money
than a large number of first-class actors.
The fact of the matter is that the people
want the game, and they will pay lib
erally to see a first-class iistic bombard
ment between two heavy-weight cannon
aders.
The sports of this city -tan rest satisfied
that they will have "a run for their
money" when Jeffries and Sharkey meet
in a twenty-four foot ring.
The contest promises to be exceedingly
Interesting while It will la*t. Sharkey in
tends to cut out a fast pace from the
clash of the gong. His backers say he
will win within three rounds. They llgure
this way: Sharkey has a better record
than Jeffries. He hns proved by his fights
with Choynskl that he can do greater
execution in a shorter space of time than
can the man from Los Angeles. He is
quicker on his pins, can hit a more wicked
blow and, above all, he is game to the
core and will not wince until knocked
completely out.
The sailor's supporters are of the opinion
that good money should always be placed
on the gamest manâ and there you are.
A MIXED DOUBLES
TENNIS TOURNAMENT
The formation of a mixed doubles tour
nament is now agitating the minds of
the lady tennis players of the California
Tennis Club. It is intended to have a
mixed doubles tournament played on
Wednesday next, if plans can be perfected
in time. The young ladies, in leapyear
like fashion, are given the privilege of
choosing their partners. Therfe will be a
rush for the best dancers of the court as
soon as the entries are opened.
Doubles tournaments will be in order
during the month of May. The three bay
town clubs will be brought in closer t6uch
by interclub matches, a new innovation
in tennis affairs. On Decoration day the
Alameda club will hold an invitation
doubles, each club sending three teams to
compete for championship prizes. Fol
lowing this tournament there will be an
interclub tournament in singles and
doubles, to be played at the California
club courts.
Not very much activity marked the
work of the week in the California club
courts. Joe Daily beat Rob Whitney, 4â â¬,
6â2, 6âo. Stauf beat O'Connor 6â4
Stauf and Kr-llog defeated Hamilton and
Yale, 6-2. Yale defeated Hamilton, 6-4,
6âl. Blive, in a series of matches with
Root, has been treating the latter to a
dose of aggravated defeats. Weihe de
feated Hoffman in three straight sets.
OFFICIALS AND
RIDERS
OF RELAY RACE
In cycling club circles the principal
topic of conversation is the annual 100
mile relay race around the bay, which
will take place this year on Sunday, May
8. It is now definitely known that but
five clubs will enter teamsâ the Olympic
Club Wheelmen and Bay City Wheelmen
of this city, Reliance and Acme Club
Wheelmen of Oakland, and the Garden
City Wheelmen of San Jose.
The Olympic team will probably be
made up from among the following:
Wing, Fuller, Stanley, Kingsley, Bean,
Cook, Kroetz, Tantau, Dell, Kragness
and Bozio, though the latter will be pro
tested if he rides.
The Bay Citys lost one of their best
men this week, when Emll Languetin
fell from his wheel while training and
sustained such severe bruises that he
may never be able to ride again. The
Davidson brothers, Black brothers, Men
ne, Raynaud, Ben Noonan, George Felix
and one or two uncertain ones to be
chosen after a tryout to-morrow at San
Leandro will make up the team. As
usual, the Bay Citys have something up
th<-ir sleeve, to play at the last moment.
The Reliance will turn up strong with
Deacon, Bacon, Rosenheim, Gooch, Poole,
Valentine, Mosher and Hayselden. They
lost a good man when Wyman was sus
pended this week, but altogether will put
up ;i stronger ten men than ever before
in the race.
Th Acmes never Intended to put in
Howard Squires, so his suspension does
not affect them. The Ferris suspended
la Joe Ferris, not George, so this does
not bother them either. A tryout will be
held to-morrow morning at 11 o'clock
from Fruitvale to liaywards. It will be
a ten-mile scratch race, with the follow
ing starters: Staples, E. J. Smith. A. T.
Smith, Schleuter, Bolte, Burke, McDou
gall, Hanlin, George Ferris, Young and
GalLndo. From tnese the team will be
picked, plus a possible addition from the
south.
The Garden City Wheelmen team is
about completed. Ted Belloli. Schnitz
pan, K. Bridgeman, Tony Delmas, Har
<!> ntirook, Julius Smith. Â«^uimby and
Thorn make eight of the number. "Bunt"
Smith was also chosen, but transgressed
the O. A. C. C. rules and Is suspended.
The other two will not be known until
Thursday, on which day at 12 o'clock
noon all entries must be in the hands of
Chairman Myrick of the road racing com
mittee.

Fabulous Wealth.
The "incalculable mineral wealth" of newly
found mining regions largely run by syndicates
and promoted by transportation companies Is
In too many instances really a fable. The
products of industry in legitimate fields of
enterprise nearer home are far surer and
promise more stable rewards. No one will go
unrewarded in the matter of improved health
who use regularly Hostetter's Stomach Bit

GROOMING DOGS
FOR THE
BENCH SHOW
The approaching bench show will de
velop a startling novelty on the last day
of the show, viz., an auction will be held
of all dogs offered and 10 per cent of the
proceeds will go to swell the fund for
charity.
Some changes from the classification as
advertised in the premium list are an
nounced by the club.
The limit of weight in the bull terrier
classes is changed from twenty-flyÂ©
pounds to thirty-five pounds.
Pointer bitches are reduced from fifty
five to fifty pounds.
In the novice, limit on open classes of
the Irish water spaniels, dogs and bitches
will be judged separately.
D. J. Sinclair intends to keep the office
of the club, at 224 Montgomery street,
open at night until 10 o'clock and all day
on Sundays.
D. W. Donnelly of Burlingame will
show his collie bitch Floss, winner of first
at San Francisco, 1593. '
J. P. Norman's mastiff Major is another
instance of renewed ambition,
Mr. Hickman of San Mateo has entered
his fine fox terrier bitch White Violet, by
Oriole Bluffer out of Dauntless Suzette.
In both limited and open classes, and hi 3
puppy Count Othmar in the puppy limit
and open. .
TI A new St. Bernard star has arisen. O.
H. Greenewald's puppy dog Pedro looks
fit enough to sweep the deck.
William R. A. Johnston's fine young
mastiff Beau Montez, by Chino Don ex
Lola, is to compete for honors. Beau
Montez swept everything before him at
San Jose, except the prize for best mastiff
in the show, for which he was beaten by
H s r-^ mm '' Mra - j - P - Norman's Lola
(AKCSB 37547).
The Verona kennels will enter all their
collies, but the imported stock will not
compete under these circumstances.
Norman J. Stewart of Aromas, C. R.
Harker and Miss Delia Beach of San Jose
feel encouraged to again try for ribbons,
with some prospect of success. They will
all show large kennels.
Sig L. Simon, bookkeeper in the Sheriff's
office, will exhibit his Newfoundland Jack
in the novice limit and open classes.
The following communication from J.
B. Martin, a well-known fancier and
breeder of fox terriers, is self-explana
tory: ni^ni
SAN FRANCISCO, April 27, 1898.
Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: My attention
has been called to a letter of J. P. Norman's,
'published in your paper recently, wherein ha
adverts to the opposition to the San Francisco
bench show by one of the local fox terrier men,
and I conclude that I am the one he refers to.
Mr. Norman states that the judge selected for
the above show is well and favorably known
the world over, and lie is a man of ability and
Integrity.
Mr. Norman, being a novice in dogdom, la
not supposed to be familiar with kennel his
tory, and for his information and that of your
readers, I will give a brief history of George
Bell, the Judge selected to act at the coming
do* show here, which will show sufficient
reasons why many dog men oppose putting
their doss under such a man.
In July, 1593. Bell sold to me for $100 a fox
terrier bitch, Blemton Consequence, guaranteed
to be in whelp, agreeing to take her back if
she did not prove so. A bitch arrived here
(not the one I bought) not in whelp, certified
to by A. R. Rowat. D. V. S., and by prominent
dog men, and she did m>t have pups. I notified
Bell offering to return her without cost to him
on return of purchase money. He declined to
I receive her and return purchase money. I then
preferred charges against him before the Amer
ican Kennel Club, and in May, 1894. he was
disqualified for one year by Thomas H. Terry,
H. P. Cromwell, Major J. M. Taylor and Ed
| ward Brouksâ four of the best known dog men
; in this country â who acted upon the committee
that tried liell upon my charges, and his de
fense prepared by well known attorneys of To
ronto, Canada. In September, IS^3, before I
filed the charges against Bell, he discovered
that he had sent me the wrong bitch. This
information was imparted to him by a well
known dog man who saw Consequence at To
i ronto, but Bell suppressed" this knowledge until
| April, IV.<4, when he, by false statements, in
j duced a. gentleman to write to me to that
effect, offering to send Consequence if I would
return the bitch he pent out, and to pay all
express charges for his mistake.
I declined the offer, and I then called the at-
I tentlon of the American Kennel Club to this
[ state of facts, and the secretary preferred
charges against Bell, basing them upon the
above, and upon November 14, 1594, Bell was
disqualified for all time, and this action was
ratified at a full meeting of the club.
Bell applied upon several occasions to be re
stored to good standing, and this was refused
him until December 28. 1896, when the A. K.
< !. removed the disqualification, to take effect
Manh 1, 1898, but Bell was not satisfied, and
asked to have it take effect February 15, 1896.
This was denied. This last order appeared to
rankle in Bella bosom and he thoueht once
more to defy the A. K. C, with the following
result :
"Whereas, George Bell made entries at the
Detroit show while not in good standing, not
withstanding the fact that his appeal for re
instatement under date of January 29, 1596, to
permit him to make entries prior to March 1,
1596, was denied February 6, 1596; ordered,
that said George Bell be and is hereby dis
qualified until -May 1, IS'J~."
Even eliminating the above disqualifications
from consideration, there is very little to Jus
tify Bell's selection.
So far as I can learn by an examination of
the American Kennel Gazette from January.
1889, to February, 1892, and the American
Field from the last date to May. 1894 (the
time of Bell's disqualification), I find that he
judged some breeds at four shows, neither one
of them having one-half the entries had here
last year. From May, 1594, to date he acted
at two shows, and during the last nine years
he has, so far as I can learn, only judged once
in the Vnited States. There were several cap
able all-round judges to be had and they are
men of established reputation and vast ex
perience, but the club overlooked them be
cause Bell was secured at a low figure.
San Francisco has been very fortunate in
the past in securing the best judges obtainable,
and now when the prospects were so bright
it is a severe blow to the kennel interests of
the coast that a judge of the reputation and
standing of Bell should have been selected.
i'Â«iurs truly. J. B. MARTIN.

The Grand Court of Cali
i fornia to Meet There
on Tuesday.
There "Will Be a Contest for
the Office of Grand
Secretary.
An Effort Will Bo Made to Have
Sessions ljut Once In Two
Years.
The next session of the Grand Court of
California of the Foresters of America
will bo held in Healdsburg. Sonoma Coun
ty, commencing next Tuesday.
The court at that place and the citizens
havo for some time past been making ex
â  poratlonÃ for the reception of
the grand officers and delegates, who will
require at least four days to transact all
the business that will come up before
them.
The question of greatest moment to the
order will be the proposition to change
the constitution so as to have a session
but once in two years, instead of yearly
as in the past. There are a great many
members of the order who favor the !
change on the ground that annual Bes- j
sions are very expensive in the matter of I
mileage and per diem, and that the money !
that would be spent at a yearly session
could be used to better advantage in the
propagation of the order.
JQ| Another matter will be the discussion of
rie new ritual which was put In force a
few months ago. There are a number of
features that many of the membership
do not take kindly to, and it is probable I
that the grand body will make sMgges- |
tions as to changes to forward to the
Bupreme circle.
In the choice* of grand officers It Is
probable that J. Samuels, the present
grand sub-chief ranger, will be promoted
grand chief ranger. The great contest
will be for the office of grand secretary
The Incumbent, John J. Cordy, who was
elected last year to till the vacancy caused
by the death of C. H. Bremer. who was
suddenly called while the grand body
was in session at Marysviile, and Sol
Peiser, secretary of the Foresters' Hall
Association, are the prominent candi
dates.
The reports to be presented to the Grand
Court will show that the membership is
13,201 in California. There are 141 courts.
The receipts during the year were $181,246;
expenditures, $174,665. The funds of the
courts amount, in the aggregate, to $149,
049, showing an increase during the year
of J6SSI. There was paid out for medi
cine and medical attendance, $3694; for
sick benefits, $47,573; for funerals, $9559,
and the donations to members in distress
were $2s.SO.

NO WOMAN IS EXEMPT.
Regularity is a master of importance
in every woman's li*. Much pain is,
however, endured in the beliei that it
is necessary and not alarming, when
in truth it is all wrong and indicates
derangement that may cause serious
trouble.
Excessive monthly pain itself will
unsettle the nerves and make women
old before their time.
The foundation of woman's health is
a perfectly normal and regular per-
formance of nature's function. The
statement we print from Miss Ger-
thcde Sikes, of Eldred, Pa., is echoed
in every city, town and hamlet in this
country. Read what she Bays:
11 Dear Mrs. Pixkham:â l feel like a
new person since following your ad-
vice, and think it is my duty to let the
public know the good your remedies
have done me. My troubles were pain-
ful menstruation and leucorrhoea. I
*ras nervous and had spells of being
confused. Before using your remedies
I never had any faith in patent mcdi'
cines. I now wish to say that I never
had anything do me so much good for
painful menstruation as Lj-dia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound; also would
Bay that your Sanative Wash has cured
me of leucorrhooa. I hope these few
words may help suffering women."
The present Mrs. Pinkham's experi-
ence in treating female ills is unparal-
leled, for years she worked side by
side with Mrs. Lydia E. Pinkham, and
for sometime past has had sole charge
of the correspondence department of
her great business, treating by letter
as many as a hundred thousand ailing
women during a single year.
All suffering women are invited to
write freely to Mrs. Pinkham, at Lynn,
Maas., for advice about their health.

A SETBACK IN
WHEAT PRICES
Depression in Eastern Markets
Is Repeated Out
Here.
Brokers Are in a State of Nervous
ness and Awaiting Foreign
Action.
Wheat prices yesterday received a bad
setback. Thursday's depressed feeling in
Eastern markets was repeated in Euro
pean markets yesterday morning. Liver
pool quoted wheat 22 i 4 d lower (5*4 cents).
The short interest, which had so much
to do with the strong advance early in
the week, was, as it turns out, protty
well liquidated above $1 So. This left the
market without sustaining power. There
was a very weak feeling in wheat from
the start at the opening.
December sold at $1 75. Offerings were
more than the crowd could take care of,
and the price dragged under this pres
sure until $1 73% was quoted. At this
price new buyers appeared, and the mar
ket firmed to $1 76*4- About this time the
Chicago market became depressed. The
feeling was soon repeated here. Sellers

ped to fl 74 : ' 4> with few buyers. At the
decline May was somewhat firmer, but
transactions were small. Liquidation by
outsiders appears well over in that
option.
The morning's tradirtg closed with an
undercurrent of weakness, which became
very marked at the closing afternoon
session. The, session opened with Decem
ber selling at $1 74*4. Heavy offerings by
E. A. liresse started a Hood of selling or
ders to appear, and within a short time
the price was hammered down to $1 72%
when the market closed for the day. On
the curb another spasm of weakness ap
peared. Cutter & Moscley's offerings s>-nt
December to $1 71^*. from where a rally
to $1 72% took place. The rally was of
short duration. The growing pressure.
soon dropped the price to $1 TiVa. Sellers,
again buyers, bid the market to $1 72Vfc
The curb trading was large and of an
erratic nature.
Yesterday's decline came from an over
bought condition of the market. Thj:
shorts squared up their contracts and left
the bulls to their fate. When the

were not easily found. Concessions Wi re

Trouble Between the Crew of the
Collier Lucilie and ths Sea
men's Union.
A very heavy northwest storm has been
raging up the coast for the last forty
eight hours, and the captains of the
coasters now due are sure to have some
hard-luck stories to tell when they reach
port. Thursday night it blew over seventy
miles an hour at Point Reyes, while at
Port Ross the seas wt-re running moun
tains high. A private dispatch from
that point says that if is many a day
since such a terrific sea has been seen off
that point, t '
At Point Reyes yesterday morning it
was still blowing fifty-eight miles an
hour, but at noon it had subsided to
forty-live miles an hour. During the
night the pilot-boats America and Gracie
S caught it. A heavy sea swept the
America and carried the yawl overboard.
Some other minor damage was doneabout
the deck, but no one was hurt. Outside
of a most uncomfortable night the pilots
on the Gracie S did not suffer.
The bark Alaska got away for Kotze
bue Sound yesterday morning with 110
gold hunters aboard. She must have got
a full share of the storm, and the for
tune seekers must have had a hard time
of it. The majority of the men had never
been to sea before, so when the bark be
gan to plunge into a nasty cross sea their
condition can be imagined.
The ship Lucille got away for Seattle
yesterday after a brush with the walk
ing delegate of the Coast Seamen's Union.
Th<Â« men all belonged to the union, and
shipped for $3t a month, or $5 more than
the Ship-Owners' Association is paying
sailors in coal ships. Just before the Lu
cille sailed the walking delegate put in
an appearance and .said the men had to
strike for JW a month. This they refused
to do, and a wordy warfare ensued. The
walking delegate insisted that the men
should do as they were told or take the
consequences. The sailors had a confab
together, and then said they had decided
to stay by the ship. The walking dele
gate then demanded their union cards
and bonks, which were given him. lie
then started for headquarters to make a
report, but by the time he got back the
captain of the Lucille had procured a
tug and the ship was on her way to sea.

and then went to Pacific-street wharf,

There was a surfeit of lively scenes on
Pacific street wharf yesterday. \V. Daley,
freight clerk on the wharf, rescued a
Spaniard from drowning; Charles Olsen,
the boss stevedore, put out a lire that at
one time threatened to burn down the
shed, and T. McCombe, purser of the
Zealandia, stopped a runaway team. The
Spanish boy jumped overboard to earn
50 cents by saving a hat His suspenders
broke while be was diving and his panta
loons lell down until his legs got en
tangled in them and he could not swim.
It waa at this juncture that Daley gal
lantly went to the rescue and kept the
drowning boy's head above water until
assistance came.
Some one dropped a lighted match be
tween the boards on the sidewalk on East
street, and the strong breeze soon quick
ened the dry timbers into a blaze. Olsen
came alone in the nick of time and or
ganizing a bucket brigade soon had the
tire out. The draught was beginning to
carry the flames under the wharf, and
a few minutes later a big lire might have
been raging.
The horses in one of the delivery
wagons on Pacific street wharf took fright
at a steamer whistle and began to run
away. The team was headed right for
a group of women, and some of them
would surely have been hurt had not Mr.
McCombe grabbed the near horse by the
head and hung on to him until the wagon

Charles Ketler was injured while work

CLUBS NOT
FOR WOMEN
So Said Mrs. Horatio Steb
bins in an Ad
dress.
Woman's Unitarian Confer
ence Elects Officers for
This Year.
"The Paganism of the Young" Dis
cussed by the Laclits â Reports
of Delegates.
Mrs. Horatio Stebblns raised her voice
against clubs for women yesterday at
the Woman's Unitarian conference. Mrs.
Stebbins was requested to read a paper
on "The Secularization of the Mother,"
and it was in this sketch that the lady
condemned the new woman, who belongs
to many clubs. She said in part:
"The trend of society of the present
day is to overwhelm the mother and dis
qualify her for the discharge of her home
duties. But wisely used it makes her
bring brightness to the home.' 1
Mrs. Stebbfns dwelt particularly on the
effect of bad society as being corruptlve
of the home, "me woman," she said,
"should use society, not be used by it.
The club life Is fascinating, but is exposed
to excessiveness. A club woman cannot
be a wise and loving spirit of the house
hold. The duty of woman Is to give the
best of her life with authority of love to
those in her home."
The remarks of Mrs. Stebblns were
greeted with applause, her audience
agreeing with her at every point.
The "Paganism of the Young" was an
other excellent paper delivered by Rev.
S. P. Carr. Discussion followed by Mrs.
W. O. llenn, Mrs. B. F. Giddlngs and
Miss Eva Carlin.
Mrs. Carr said: "I admit that the
spiritual is lacking in youth. They see
tin' beauty of the flower, but not the
beauty of that which is behind it. Im
portant example is set the younger peo
ple by their elders, and they are only
too glad to miss church when the elders
do likewise."
Mrs. llcnn of Alameda followed Mrs.
('air's talk. "The paganism of the
young," said she, "is inevitable, but I do
not Inilii've unremediable. The fact that
the children are semi-pagan is encourag
ing in itself. The mother of the present
time shrinks from teaching the child for
fear of teaching it something by which
the child later might suffer. I think that
the best way is to give the young people
as much to do as possible. Give them
something for which they are responsible.
Truly, often they blunder, but then they
haven't blundered long, they haven't had
much of a chance."
"The Development of a Soul" was writ
ten by Mrs. J. B. Comstock, but read by
Mrs. Humphrey Smith, as Mrs. Com
stock wns unavoidably absent.
The morning session of the conference
was given over entirely to reports of the
delegates and election of officers.

A SAILOR WITH
A BAD VOODOO
He Luffed to Starboard When
He Should Have Rushed
to Port.
All His Sails Tore Loose and Paint
Pots Rained on Deck When
He Went Aloft.
Stlllman Stover, first mate of the
American brigantine Harriet G, was
placed on examination yesterday before
United States Commissioner Heacock on
two charges of beating and wounding sea
men on the high seas during the recent
voyage of the Harriet G from New York
to this port.
The complainants were Albert Mattson
and Ole Anderson Sellevold. Ole Ander-
son told the Commissioner how Stover
had knocked him down and kicked him.
He product (1 Dr. Wise of the Marine Hos
pital to testify that he was still suffer
ing from an injury.
Albert Mattson was influenced by a
voodoo during the voyage, if his story is
to be believed. If he fastened a sail it
was sure to become loose and rlap de
liantly in the gale, and when ordered to
an something on the port side of the
ship he invariably went to the starboard.
It was his ill luck also that whenever
he made a blunder of that kind Matt:
Stover was sure to be around and pro
fane.
About February 23 this year Mattson
reefed the jib, but he had no sooner left
the job than the jib broke loose and
fluttered gaily in the breeze. The ship
was tacking at the time, and the mute
became angry and called him "a big
Dutch fool." He gave Mattson another
order and the sailor went to the wrong
side of the ship, whereupon he was fol
lowed and thumped by the mate on the
jaw and the back of the neck, and wat>
kicked two consecutive times. The mate
in making another kick slipped and fell
on the flat of his back and Mattson fell
on top of him. Mattson would have died
of fright if members of the crew had not
lifted him to his feet again.
On St. Patrick's day thu voodooed sailor
made his worst blunder. He was aloft
painting, and the pot of paint slipped
from his hand and fell from the royal
yard to the deck, striking within a few
feet of the mate and bespattering his
sou'wester. Then, when Mattson came
down to get the pot and scrape the deck,
the mate struck him a right hajider in
the left temple, knocking htm senseless.
MattKon denied that he had drawn his
knife on the mate, but admitted that
the mate took the knife away from him.
Other witnesses corroborated the stories
told by the two sailors.
Stover flatly denied having struck or
kicked Anderson or Mattson. All that
he would admit was that he might have
shoved them out of the way or sworn
at them.
The examination was continued until
next Monday afternoon at 2 o'clock at
which hour the captain of the brlgantine
will give his testimony.
Mattson filed a libel yesterday against
the brig for $69 60, the balance of wages
claimed by him. He admits having de
serted the ship at this port, but says he
was forced to leave by reason of the
cruelty of Mate Stover.

DEPUTIES MADE HAPPY.
Only Four Demands of the County
Clerk's Employes to Be Held Out
for the Test Case.
At the conference between the Auditor,
the Mayor and the County Clerk, held
yesterday in the office of Auditor Broder
ick on the matter of the warrants of
deputy county clerks it was decided to
hold out only four demands to serve in
the test case now before the Supreme
Court as to the legality of the employ
ment of more than thirty-two deputies
by the County Clerk.
Auditor Broderick held out forty-live of
the eighty-four demands last month, and
will now sign all of these except four. Hi;
will also hold out four from the April de
mands.
It was left to the employes in the Coun
ty Clerk's office to select the four men
whose demands were to be used in the
test case.
GOT MAGUIRE'S MONEY.
Wells, Fargo & Co.'s Detectives
Hunting for "John Doe."
Detective Hume of Wells, Fargo & Co.
is hunting- for "John Doe," who is wanted
on a charge of obtaining money by false
pretenses. The warrant was obtained in
Judge Joachimsen'a court yesterday
morning.
It appears that on March 9 a letter was
sent from Forest Hill, Placer County,
containing a money order for $40 to John
Maguire, who was then living at 007 Mar
ket street. Maguire did not receive the
letter, and on making inquiry ascertained
that the order had been cashed at Wells,
Fargo & Co's oilice to a man who rep
resented himself as Maguire. How he
had got possession of the letter is still <x
mystery. The $40 had again to be paid
to Maguire, and the company now want
to punish the false Maguire, at present
known as "John Doe."
PUGILISTS SHOULD
BE EXAMINED
The Death of "Bull" McCarthy
a Warning to Fight
Promoters.
National Club Fighters in Superb
Condition â A Large Ad
vance Sale.
The death of "Bull" McCarthy, the
pugilist who succumbed shortly after his
twenty-round bout with "Young" Griffo
in Sacramento on Wednesday evening,
and the arrest of the Australian, were the
sole topics of conversation in sporting
circles yesterday, and for the time being
the ever-recurring discussion over the
probable outcome of mo tistic argument
between "Sailor" Sharkey and the L.os
Angeles giant was dropped. It was the
universal opinion that Griffo could not
deliver a blow hard enough to cause
death and that the Sacramento Athletic
Ciub, under whose auspices the fight took
place, was highly negligent in not hav
ing a proper examination made of the
principals before they entered the ring.
"It has always been our practice," said
; Manager Oroom of the National Club
' yesterday, "to have the contestants un
dergo a thorough physical examination
! before beginning hostilities. The result
! has been that the -â â .annual oub lias
! never had a casualty. We have pulled
off more big lights in this city during the
past two years than any other organiza
; lion, because we have selected the par
ticipants with care and had our phy
sician keep a watchful eye on their phy
sical conuition. Had the Sacramento
Club done this the death of McCarthy
. would not have resulted. I regret ex
ceedingly the outcome of the bout, be
cause it gives a black eye to pugilism.
"Our pnyslcian. Dr. L>. D. l_.ustig, will
! shortly pay a visit to tne training quar
j ters of bharkey, Baker, Stelzner and Jef
! fries, and will thoroughly examine the
men. If he reports to us that any of the
men are unfit they will not appear under
the National Club auspices. But 1 antici
1 pate no such report, as from what 1 hear
; the men are ready to light the battle of
their lives. In my opinion the winner of
| the Sharkey-Jeffries go will be the cham
! pion of the world. i3oth men have met
â  the top-notchers and have made excellent
; showing."
Baker, who is to meet Stelzner, is in
better condition to-day i..iin he has been
' since his arrival on the coast, and can be
; relied on to give Stelzncr a warm recep
: tion. In the East Baker enjoyed a good
j reputation as a scrapper, but since his
: visit here he has not devoted much time
to keeping in condition, caring more for a
sporting life. Baker has now seen the
foolishness of such a plan and has stop
ped drinking and is training with avidity,'
knowing that if he defeats Stelzner his
chances for future engagements will be
better. He has been heard to say that if
j he had been in as fine fettle when he met
1 Jeffries there might have been another
man training to meet Sharkey. Baker
' has been in both camps and sparred with
| both men, and the knowledge he gained
! leads him to pick Sharkey as the winner
of the coming light.
The seatingarrangements in Mechanics'
Pavilion on the night of the contest will
be better than at previous contests. Every
ticket-holder will be assured of an unob
! structed view of the arena, and there will
be no crowding. Captain Curtin will have
lifty men under him to regulate the
crowd and perfect order will be maln
j tamed during the progress of the fight.
The advance sale of tlcKets is very large,
and Mr. Groom predicts that a larger
crowd than that which witnessed the
Corbett-Sharkey and Fitzsimmons-Shar
key goes will be present.
Gained 22 Pounds in 5 Weeks.
From the By-Stander, Macomb, 111.
Alderman Louis W. Camp of our city
has quite astonished his friends of late
by a remarkable gain in weight. He has
gained 22 pounds in five weeks. Those of
his friends who do not know the facts of
his sickness will read with interest the
following:
"I was broken down in health and ut
terly miserable," said Mr. Camp to our
reporter. "I was unable to work much
of the time and so badly afflicted with a
form of stomach trouble that life was a
veritable nightmare.
"I tried various remedies, but during
the six months of my sickness I obtained
no relief. I had always been a robust,
healthy man and sickness bore heavily
upon me.
"About two years ago I was advised to
try Dr. Williams' Pink Pill for Pale Peo
pl". I purchased one box and received so
much benefit that I used five more and
was entirely cured. I gained twenty-two
pounds in five weeks. Since I stopped
taking the pills I have scarcely had an
ache or pain.
Interviewing the Alderman.
"Dr. Williams" Pink Pills restored me
to health, and I most heartily recommend
them."
L. W. Camp on oath says that the fore
going statement is true.

What United States Court Clerk Morse
Saw and Heard on His Visit

George E. Morse, clerk of the United

Washington with his wife and little
daughter, where Mrs. and Miss Morse
had been on a yisjt to President McÃin
ley and family for the past three months.
Mr. Morse took copious mental notes of
the war excitement in the East, and tells
an interesting story. President McKinley
is Mrs. Morse's uncle, and owing to the
kinship existing Mr. Morse was able to
see and hear a good deal of the inside
sentiment in Washington. He says that
the President was opposed to entering
into war with Spain or any other country,
and strained every nerve to prevent it,'
but after he had sent his message to Con

to him to the best of his ability.

You know that our minister used to be a practicing
physician. He was a graduate of the College of Physi-
cians and Surgeons, New York, and he says of Ripans
Tabules that the formula has long been in favor with
medical men, but the method of preparation in the pres-
ent form is modern and a very great convenience. He
lately spoke .of them to me in ; these 'very words : "I
always keep a vial of the Tabules upon my dressing-
table and use them with confidence whenever occasion
arises. For a disturbed condition of the digestive or-
gans 1 I know of nothing so good, and for an 'all round'
family remedy I do not believe there is anything better
to be had.'
feeling was manifested in the East and
here. He says that all uirough the coun
try wherever ho traveled business houses
anfl private residences floated the starg
and stripes. Not a flagstaff waa bare, and
houses unprovided with tlnm floated Old
Glory from the balconies and the second
story windows. He said the floating ot
the national colors seems to be the ex
ception instead of the rule.
Here also all the excitement seems to
be on the streets and around the bulle
tin boards, while in Washington and else
where the excitement is greatest behind
closed doors. xhere are no unusual
crowds on the Eastern streets, but the
people walk along at a more lively g.iit
than usual, snowirâ¢ suppressed excite
ment, none the less intense than that ex
hibited more freely in the cities of the
Pacific Slope.

FAILURE TO PROVIDE.
The Troubles of Clay H. Powell, a
Student of Pharmacy.
Clay H. Powell, a student of the Col
lege of Pharmacy, appeared before Judge
Campbell yesterday afternoon to answer
a charge of failing to provide for his
child. His attoFney got a continuance
til! Monday.
It seems that Powell was clandestine
ly married in San Rafael about a year
ago to a daughter of Orrin White of Lar
kin street. They did not live together,
as Powell was unabie to provide a home
for her. She gave birth to a daughter
about a week ago and the wife's father
Insists upon Powell supporting the child.
Powell will claim that he was drunk from
whisky and absinthe when the marriage
took place and that he did not know
what he was doing. He will also claim
that he was not 21 years of age, and if
he should so testify he will get himself
into trouble on a charge of perjury
It Is understood that Powell has "insti
tuted proceedings for a divorce and .Mon
day a lively time is expected.
Injured by a Baker's Wagon.
L. D. Jones, a boy about five years of
age, living at 1020 Folsom street, was
knocked down by a baker's wagon at
Mission and Mary streets yesterday. One
of the wheels passed over his abdomen
and left leg. He was taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital. Dr. Weil thinks ho
may be suffering from internal injuries.

THE WAR SEEMS TO HAVE NO EFFECT
WHATEVER UPON IT.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
"The absence of panic or sensation In the
very presence of war is something remarkable
and has rarely been witnessed In the world's
money markets under the influence of like con
ditions. Such catastrophes are Invariably at
tended with panic on the Bourses and violent
fluctuations Jn the money markets, which ex
tend to other countries than those directly
concerned In the hostilities. In our case, we
have stood peculiarly exposed to suffer from
effects of this nature. We are probably the
moat largely debtor nation In the world. Eng
land, Germany. Holland and France hold, ac
cording to common estimate, fully $2,000,000,000
of our Investments. These creditors have re
cently had their confidence severely tested by
the late sliver agitation; and it might be ex
pected that those fears would be acutely re
vived by the financial strain to which this war
may subject the country- That such appre
hensions would cause a more or less important
return of corporate securities from Europe was
naturally to be expected, and. in fact, has been
looked for. But no such movement has ap
peared to any appreciable extent. The foreign
organs of financial opinion, which at times
have had much to say about the possibility of
our drifting upon the silver basis, have had
nothing to suggest about that danger being In
creased by the contingencies of war finance;
American securities have held their own by the
side of the issues of other countries, while
Spanish 4s have declined 30 points, and the
r. mount of stocks and bonds returned to our
home market has not been at all abnormal In
n mount. This experience is the more remark
able in view of the fact that the floating in
debtedness of Europe to the United States is so
altogether extraordinary as to furnish a strong
motive for Influencing the return of our se
curities In order to avert shipments of gold.
Within a few weeks about $65,000,000 of gold
have been sent i..>..er In settlement of trade
balances, and a balance of not less than $30,-
OiVt.nno still remains to be liquidated. Under
ordinary conditions, such a state of the ex
changes would have caused large sums of our
st-ourlties to be sent home, but no such move
ment of any moment has occurred. This fact
rap be accounted for only upon the supposition
that the foreign holders of these Investments
feel satisfied that, at present prices, they are
sound and safe, even in the prospect of the un
certainties of war. This tacit verdict expresses
the opinion of the banking and Investment in
terprets of Europe upon the effect the war Is
likely to have on the commercial and financial
stability of this country. It would not have
hr-en surprising had our foreign creditors
deemed it a wise course to sell their holdings
of our securities in anticipation of the war,
v.ith a view of buying them back after the
pressure of the struggle had worked its full
effect upon them; and the fact that they have
not done so can only be regarded as implying
confidence not only in the future value of these
Investments, but also In our being able to sus
tain the burdens of hostilities without serious
consequences, and In our being able to bring
the struggle to an early and successful Issue."

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Ajprtl 28.â The bull campaign
Inaugurated yesterday was continued' with ag
gressive vigor to-day In the stock market, and
prices were lifted from 1 to nearly 4 points
throughout the active list. The sharp advance
did not bring out any large amount of offer-
Ings to realize, but there was some proilt
taklng, apparently by small traders, in the last
dealings, which clipped off the extreme gains
for the day. It was noticeable, however,
throughout the day that any marked reaction
In prices Immediately led to a cessation of
offerings and the market fell into Intense dull
ness. The rather hesitating and unsettled tone
of Americans in London was Ignored and
prices were confidently advanced here from the
opening. There was no important opposition
to the bull campaign and prices moved quite
easily, the supply of stocks continuing rather
limited. The volume of business showed fur
ther increase ovÂ«r yesterday and further addi
tions to the list of active stocks.
| The speculative leaders, which were bought
, by the bull coterie, were followed by other
stock* whose friends desired to see them keep
pace with the rest of the market- There were
j no new developments during the day beyond
! the continued confidence In the general sltua
! tlon. The declaration of neutrality by Portu
gal may possibly have had some slight influ
ence. The main consideration was the satis
faction felt over the excellent gunnery of the
{ United States ships at Matanzas and In pur
! suit of prizes and the Ineffective efforts of the
Spanish gunners. The skill thus demonstrated
i impart a a atronff conviction as to the su
periority of the United States forces. Early
Intelligence is also confident of a naval vie
; tory over the Spaniards off the Philippine*.
; The strength of the market was quite general,
| but none of the specialties, notably Sugar,
Manhattan and Metropolitan Street Railway,
moved more orderly than the general list. The
Grangers, as usual, led the railroad list. For
eign exchange was lower, demand sterling
breaking sharply 4c to $4 84. The discount
rate in London also declined. This led to re
newed talk of gold Imports, and the stiffening
of the call loan rate was a further factor
j toward this end. The abundant supply of
: money which has been available for call loans
, has been based, however, on the disinclination
of lenders to put their funds Into time loans
I and commercial paper. Accommodations in
these departments are now more easily had
and the outlook Is believed to favor easier
money conditions.
There is increased Inquiry for railroad bonds,
; with the promise of easier conditions In the |
; money market. Prices moved upward to-day |
on an increased volume of business. Total
sales, $1,450,000.
I Government bonds were strong. The new
' 4s coupon and the seconds advanced 1 per
cent, the new 4's registered and the old 4's
' registered 4 and the old 4's coupon and the
S*a coupon \i per cunt In the bid price. There
. were sales of the new 4's, both coupon and i
registered, at an advance of M over the last !
Rale price, but the old 4's registered showed a
; decline of 4 on actual sales from the last
J price.

NEW YORK, ,vprll 29.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here to-day were good on the con
tinued arrivals of gold, nearly 700,000 pounds
coming In to-day. I have reason to believe,
however, that not much more Is to come from
Germany or France. There is yet a slight
American demand for gold.
Americans opened above the New York parity,
and were a good market, closing a fraction be
low the best. Canada Pacific and Grand Trunk
â were strong on the growing expectation of the
end to the rate war Boon.
Kaffirs were better and show signs of Im
proving a little. The Transvaal Government
wants a loan, and It Is said neither Germany
r.or England will negotiate until more con
cessions have been granted. The West Aus
tralian market troubles continue and will not
be arranged until next week. There were four
failures to-day and more are expected.
, A statement is expected soon relative to the

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, April 29.â the first time in j
five days the Liverpool market showed signs j
of weakening. It started at declines averaging j
2ftc a bushel, except for spot grain, whici I
was quoted ' 14c higher. This was the first |
setback in the foreign market after 21fte ad
vance. The bears were Jubilant, thinking as
they did that the so-called speculative bubb'e
abroad had exploded. Quotation* were lfts3c
a bushel higher from London and 2ftd at
Paris, but were quietly ignored, and July,
which closed here yesterday worth 9F4c start
ed at from gS^ig^STio. A little covering car
ried it up to 94ftc. This demand was . soon
filled, and bottom was not reached until July
had sold at 924 c. Closing Liverpool cables
brought the bulls no relief, that market wind-
Ing up at the bottom of a 6c decline for July.
But the local crowd, which had apparently
sold short almost to a man. tried to cover half
an hour before the close and had to compete
with heavy New York buying. The result was
a bulge of 2ftc In July, which touched 94% c.
Realizing carried It back to 934 cat the close,
a net loss of 2 cents. May, which opened
$1 204@l 21. sold off to $1 174, closing at $1 20,
a net loss of 2'sc.
Corn was fairly heavy for the most part.
The lowest prices were at the start, out the
heavy feeling prevented any material recovery.
July closed ftc net lower.
Oats opened weak, but heavy purchases
against cash acceptance caused, a rally, espe
cially In May, which closed 14c net higner.
July gained 4c.
The demand for lard was the feature In pro
visions to-day. Some covering of pork and ribs
was Induced by the independent strength of
lard and the market closed strong. July pork
closed 224 1 ' net lower, July lard closed 10c

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK. April 29.â R. O. Dun A Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade will say to-morrow:
Hostilities have not as yet changed last
week's conditions. There Is much postpone
ment of orders by men who do not know what
they are waiting for and much restriction of
loans by banks which are abundantly strong.
All this checks new business, and yet the vol
ume of transactions through clearing-houses
Is 8 per cent larger than the same week in
1892, with no foreign trouble. But this increase
would be much larger but for speculative stag
nation here. New York clearings being 2.1 per
cent smaller than In 1892. Railroads are doing
a great business, 5.7 per cent larger than in
ISS2 in April earnings thus far and 13.9 larger
than last year.
Many have been asserting about every day
for the past two weeks that the wheat specu
lation has culminated, but the price has in
that time advanced 214 c SUe within the past
week. Receipts of 2,746,790 bushels at the West
this week, against 1.562.835 a year ago, and
averaging 250,000 bushels per week for Janu
ary, February and March, show no exhaustion
of supplies, while exports amounting to 3,704,
675 bushels from Atlantic ports, against 043,148
last year, and 786,078 from Pacilic ports,
against 186,5)41 last year, flour included in ail
cases, makes exports for the four weeks 12,093,
768 from Atlantic and 2,880.020 from Pacific
ports, and for the crop year thus far 1&0.661.678
bushels, against 127.168.684 bushels during the
same months and weeks of last year.
Corn exports for the week were 3.773,280 bush
elÃ, against 3.029,0 ft last year, and for four
weeks have been 12.266.651 bushels, against 12.
260,207 bushels last year. This makes about
151,000,000 bushels for the crop year. No such
foreign demand for both grains has ever been
known, and it does not seem to be satisfied at
all as yet.
Confusing accounts about the great indus
tries cannot cause surprise. In view of the con
tradictory influence of monetary stringency,
curtailing many orders, heavy orders by the
Government in many branches and all-pervad
ing confidence that after temporary conditions
business Is to be better. The Government le
buying many uniforms and great quantities
of supplies, cloths, shoes, copper wire and iron
for vessels and armament, and the purchasing
of many ships compels building of other ves
sels.
Banking caution at the same time is stop
ping work in some Iron and woolen mills. Yet
confidence as to future business causes refusal
of very many contracts for long time, the
holding of wool above its current manufacture
value and a marked rise in hides.
The consumption of iron is still the greatest
ever known, though many structural and car
contracts have been deferred. The week has
witnessed Eastern inquiries for plate at Chi
cago and a general advance of $2 per ton, with
refusal of bids by implement makers at Chi
cago for bar iron, because higher prices in the
future are expected and Eastern buying of
bars from Chicago for car building, with a
shade lower prices at Pittsburg for Bessemer
pig, because the associated producers hold to
agreed prices, although middlemen are selling
at lower figures. In spite of any agreement
by foundrymen and forge producers the price
of gray forge at Pittsburg slightly declines.
Considerable orders for steel rails for export
have been received during the week. With but
two or three structural orders of consequence
the works are fully employed for months to
come.
Woolen manufactures are doing rather bet
ter, large Government orders helping. Sales
of wool are about a sixth of last year's for
April, half of those In 1896 and a third of
sales in 1892, though Eastern buyers are weak,
but country holders are sticking for higher
prices.
Failures for the week have been 262 in the
United States, against 237 last year, and 16
In Canada, against 40 last year.

BRADSTREET'S REVIEW.
NEW YORK. April 25 .â Bradstreefs to-mor
row will say: The lark of excitement, ner
vousness or Interruption, the ordinary or
derly conduct of public affaire and particularly
business operations with which this country
has passed from peace to war, seem likely
to become historical. When contrasted with
the records, where extant, of business move- j
ments at periods In the country's history, when ',
war was the tlnal result of strained relations,
the temper with which the country has recog
nized the outbreak of hostilities with a for
eign power Is not only proof that the dullness
and depression of the past six weeks have
largely discounted the effect usually witnessed,
but furnishes a valuable index to the general
point of view taken by the business commu
nity as to the outcome of the pending war.
Little or no eff<Â»ct upon general trade distri
bution* of an unfavorable character is per
ceptible in the reports of the past week.
Perhaps the most notable, because most uni
form feature, has been the unanimity with
which the quotations of leading staples have
been marked up. These advances, too. have
not been confined to food products, hut Include
many widely differing articles, alike of home
and foreign Â«ruwth. It Is true that the great
est animation has been displayed in those pro
ducts o' the United States and foreign coun
tries, the ocean transportation of which is. in
the minds of some people, likely to be int :r
fered with. Thus wheat, whose strong statis
tical position has hern frequently referred to.
has been again marked up, chiefly because if
the excited foreign demand which ha* developed
and of the heavy advances at consuming points i
abroad. Following the leading cereal in its j
upward movement, corn, oats and flour have I
likewise advanced, while In pork and other j
animal products, notably lard, baron and |
hams, quotations have also bean marked up.
The demand for steel plates for vessels to
replace those taken by the Hovornment is also
a feature of interest and the outlook is for
activity In the ship building industry for sonir
tlme to come.
A feature of importance is the immense de
mand and rather lnmdÂ«qu&te supply of freight
room in vessels sailing from this country In
the near future. Rates have a^ain advanced
and shipments- from several ports ;iri reported
crippled, not only by the advanced quotations,
but by the absolute scarcity in some cases of
neutral bottoms to carry freight In. The crop
situation generally Is of a most gratifying
kind, but particularly so Is that of wheat and
other grains, with the sole exception, as to lo
cality, of California, which is buying wheat
in Oregon and Washington. Undoubtedly, the
favorable crop prospects have been a stimu
lating feature tl^oughout most sections of the
country, and taken in conjunction with the
advance in cereal products, have tended very
largely to offset any possible ill effects grow
ing out of the present situation.
Cereal exports, as already noted, show a con
siderable Increase this week, wheat shipment*
from this country and Canada aggregating 4,
160,998 bushels, against 3,232.000 bushels last
week. 1,155,000 bushels in the corresponding
week a year ago, 1,260,000 bushels in 1896 and 2.
565.000 bushels In 1895.
Business failures in the United States this
week number 245. a gain of 21 over last week'Â»
total and compared with 244 in the correspond
ing week of 1597, 254 in ISH6 and 206 in 1895.
BRADSTREET'S FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, April 29.â Bradstreet's Finan
cial Review to-morrow will say:
Speculative conditions this week have been
a disappointment, both to those who held that
war was likely to cause further serious de
pression In stock prices and those who look
for the immediate development of an active
and excited bullish market. As a matter of
fact Wall street has not seen such a dull,
tame and waiting market in a long time. The
public is out of it. either as investors or specu
lators, and the leading operators and manipu
lators up to the la.st two days' trading rested
on their oars. Transactions by the smaller
fry were consequently of a limited and re
stricted kind, while London sold slightly at
the beginning of the week and later on showed
a disposition to purchase, but In neither case
to an extent sufficient to affect the tone de
cisively. The market was simply heavy and
lower in the early part of the week and dull
but stronger in the succeeding portion.

Natives.
wurious Experience While Trying to
Paint the Ship Morning
Star.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway. April 29.
Arthur P. Alexander, who baa been
Eerding: special letters to The Call from
the South Sea Islands during the past
year? cruise of the Morning Star, has
returned home, leaving the. vessel at
Honolulu.
I the most pleasant incidents of
the trip was the visit of the yessel to
Ponape on the 2Gth of February.' This is
a little island which is under Spanish
control, and although the most bitter
feeling was at that time existing be
tween America and Spain the innocent
people of this Island, far removed from
bulletin boards, knew nothing whatever
of the trouble. They treated everybody
aboard the Morning Star in a very gen
erous manner, and showed every possi
ble kindness. This little island will prob
ably not know of the war until it is all
over. It is a singular fact that although
a large fortification on the island is oc
cupied by Spanish soldiers ihe Gov
ernment of Spain receives no income or
revenue from it, merely holding the isl
and for the glory there is in It.
The Morning Stur. which is supported
by the little contributions of tens of thou
sands of Congregatlonalist Sunday
school pupils all over the country, has
just completed a cruise of nine months
through the islands of Micronesia, dis
tributing provisions to the missionaries
at work among the natives. During the
whole time the vessel met witii no acci
dent except the loss of a boom.
The work in the South Seas is reported
as going along splendidly, and the more
the natives learn the more they are anx
ious to know.
Among the returned missionaries are
Rev. J. Mitchell, who will remain at Hon
olulu, and Messrs. Anderson and Scum
felt, who are from Rutaritari, in the Gil
bert Islands, whither they went two
years ago. Mr. Scumfelt went as a vol
unteer, and is now returning to his home
in Los Angeles. Miss Foss, a school
tf arhor from the island of Kuk. and Miss
Palmer of the Kusaie Girls' School, are
on thÂ»ir wrav home; Miss Wilson of
Kusaie; Miss Price, who comes to this
try to be educated; John Higgins;
Rev. b. Kaaia, wife and daughter, .â . â¢:â ;
Rev. Kapaaluhi. wife and. three children,
arc also returning. . ,
Mr. Kimm came from the Marshall Tsl
ands, whero he has charge of the business
â 'f Mrs. Insalls, whose husband, now de
ceased, was at one time American Consul
imoa. He brings with him Christo
pher Inpalls to be educated here.
One of the most amusing experiences
of th voyage was the Impossibility of
painting the ship while at any of the isl
ands. The mate. Mr. Anderson, made a
dozen attempts at it. but the desire of
the natives for paint is so great that they
would rub it off the ship's sides on every
thing they couid find, thereby, in their
eyes, adding greatly to its value.
MARSH WILL GO

No New Trials for a Member
of the Sporting Life
Gang.
But for His Voluntary Delay Half
the Sentence Would Now
Ba Served.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 29.
William Marsh, one of the "Sporting
Life gang," tec-\s sorry to-day that he did
not take his sentence as soon as he was
many months ago, for it would
now be half over. Judge Ogxlen this
morning sentenced him to one year in
San Quentin, and all the Â«nonths passed
in Jail have been for naught.
A peculiarity of the case is that Marsh
is one of four hard characters arrested
at the same tiny and charged with the
smif crime, burglary and criminal as
sault. "Tho evidence in the cases tried
was the sain- in each instance, but Marsh
was the only one convict 'd. two of the
members escaped punishment because of
a misunderstanding between the Disjtrirt
Attorney's office and the police, and Marsh
has had his case continued several months
for sentence, while his attorneys intended
to argue, for a new trial.
Attorney Nusbaumer resumed his argu
ment this morning, and it was mainly
through his njeading that the sentence
whs so light. Judge Ogden denied the
motion for a new trial and said he could
see nothing that would induce him to Bet
aside the verdict, after which the court

"I do not intend to visit upon this young

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 29.
The students of St. Mary's College have ]
been busily preparing for some time past
for their annual field day, which is to
take place May 12.
The athletes have turned out in large
numbers and are assiduously training
every day to win new laurels and break
records, and everything seems to give
promise that they will acquit themselves
admirably.
Several of the athletes who participated
in the events last year are training hard
to excel their previous records. Several
new men are also training and will make
an excellent showing. Welch, who ran
the 100-yard dash last year, will have a
good competitor in Meyers, who is quite
it Cast man and a good all-round athlete.
Huff and Ryan are good sprinters, and
will make the 100-yard championship a
very interesting event. Jessen and Por
ter art- very good men in the hammer
throw, and the shot-put will be hotly
contested by Brady, Jessen and McDon
ough.
The relay race between the collegiate
and commercial departments will un
doubtedly prove very Interesting as a
ki'i'ii but friendly rivalry exists between
th<se departments. The tug-of-war teams
will 1:. captained by F. M. Silva, who
coached his team to victory last field day.
and by A. P. Finan, and should be quite
interesting, as the teams are very evenly
matched.
The band has prepared several pieces,
and will furnish music on the campus field
day.

Forty Members of Company Q Sign
the Roll and There Are More
to Follow.
ALAMEDA, April 89.â 1t was regular
drill night for Company Q last evening,
but before the hour sot for the com
mencement of duty Captain Simpson re
ceived orders from Adjutant-General Bar
rett to call on such of his men as de-
Blred to volunteer for service in the war
to sign the roll pledging themselves to do
so. In response forty of the young men
of the company put their names on the
list. These men are all from the original
membership of the company; which num
bered fifty-five, and they include all the
unmarried ones. During the day the sig
natures of a number of those who have
recently made application to Join were ob
tained, and it is expected that by to-night
all of these will have signed "the roll,

Captain Simpson took his examination
to-day for the purpose of sending in his
application for retention of the command,
and the other officers will do likewise. It
is believed that enough additional men
can be obtained to fill the entire roll of
the company to its maximum strength.

George Oakes Named by

a Reward for Party

Failure of the Plan of Sending an

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,

notification to-day that his appointment
as postmaster had been sent to the Sen
ate by President McKinley. There is no
doubt the Senate will confirm the nomina-
GEORGE A. OAKES, Haywards' New Postmaster
tion. This ends one of the hottest fights
made In Haywards for many yeara for po
litical preferment. A new feature was in
troduced into this light in this oontest
which may possibly become a precedent
when old soldiers, especially, are seeking
an office.
The keenest opponent Mr. Cakes had
was Alonzo Bradford, a veteran wh- I
a prominent ]>art in many battles of the
Civil War. As a memento of a brush
with the Confederates Mr. Bradford si ill
carries with him a bullet safely imbed. led
in his knee. When anxious to be post
master, Mr. Bradford, no doubt strength
ened in his idr-a by bearing so much ai">ut
the Boldler President, decided to send a
pictorial petition to Washington.
Hfe exposed bis knee to the X-ray and
the negative clearly showed the location
of the bullet. Some of George' B friends
hinted that the negative, in so far as the
bullet was concerned, had been "touched
up," but this was Btrenuoualy denied.
However, the petition and picture were
duly received and placed on tile, but tho
active work done by Mr. Oakes, who iÂ»Â»
proprietor and editor of the Haywarda
Journal, during the last national cam
paign, carried the day.
Mr. Oakes has been a resident of Hay
wards all his life, and is a son of the
celebrated caterer, Tony, known t^ every
bun vlvant of the last generation in this
State. The new postmaster now declares
he will change tne motto of tin- Journal

BERKELEY'S NEW
ATHLETIC FIELD
Surveys for a Running Track,
Ball Fields and Tennis
Courts.
The Track to Have Three Laps With
a Two Hundred and Twenty
Yard Straightaway.
BERKELEY, April 20.â Surveys have
been made and it is understood that grading
will soon be commenced on a new athletic
li'-i<i, including a football gridiron, a base
l.ail diamond, tennis courts and a running
track, for the University of California
athletes. The new Held will be located
In the northwest corner of the college
grounds, where the orchard and wheat
field now are. ,
The track will have three laps to the
mile, and will have a 220-yard straight
away. Within the track will be the base
ball and football fields, and tennis court*.
A -rand Btand with a capacity of at least
25,000 will be built and a fcrove of euca
lyptus trees will be planted, in order to
break the wind. The track will probably
be raised, so as to be easily visible at
every part from the grand stand, and the
turns will be banked, so that bicycle races
can safely be ridden upon it. The foot
ball field will be underlaid with a stratum
of tanbark to make it springy.
Jt will probably be some time before the ;
new Held, which is to be a part of the
greater university plan, will be completed.
The grading alone will consume many
months, but it is stated that the money
for the purpose is ready and that work
will soon be commenced.

AN AMAZONIAN MARCH.
Elaborate Preparations for t'ne Grand
Carnival To-Night.
The preparation for the carnival of the
Golden Gate Association, to be held in
Mechanics' Pavilion to-night are about
completed, although everything has not !
been decided upon as yet. For the past
few days scarce an hour has passed that I
the fertile brain of some committeeman j
has not evolved some pleasing novelty, i
something to interest, to amuse to at- |
tract, and the expense of bringing it out j
will not be a consideration, as f\rr* and !
foremost everything is to be first-class, j
and there is to be as much of everything ,
as can be given in one night without !
crowding.
Among other things there will he the ;
grand Amazonian march, which will be j
participated in by 150 of San Francisco's j
prettiest young ladies in appropriate cos
tume. When the march begins the lights i
will be lowered and beautiful effects will
be secured with thÂ« calcium. Barnum'a
famous $10,000 drum major will lead the !
march and show what marvels of twirl
tag can be accomplished with the baton. !
Music will be furnished by Bennett's fam- !
ouj band. In the afternoon a short street I
parade will be given.
A Relic of Former Days.
A relic of former d;iys, tlio days of '48,
has recently been sent to the State Mining
BUread. It is an old-fashioned pick used
in the placer mine at Sutter's Mill. Work
men have been cleaning out the old tail
race below the sluices and found the pick
and shovel. The latter had heen so dis
integrated that it fell into pieces, but the
pick is well preserved. The peculiar fea
ture of the old implement is that the iron
oxide has made the gravel adhere to the
iron. The :>iok is on exhibition at the
Mining Bureau.
RAINEY'S MEN
NOW UNITED
Newly Elected Commit
teemen Perfect Perma
nent Organization.
Major P. J. Harney Unani
mously Chosen for
Chairman.
The Dispute in tho Thirty-Second
Assembly District Was Ami
cably Settled.
The new general committee of the
Rainey-Harney wing of the local Democ
racy met last night in Pioneer Hall and
effected permanent organization by the
election of officers.
The meeting was called to order by
Major P. J. Harney, who appointed a
committee to examine the credentials of
the members. The only dispute concern
ing the soating of the committee was in
the Thirty-second Assembly District,
where there was a question raised as to
the eligibility of four of the members re
ported elected by the district club. The
committee on credentials speedily dis
posed of the matter, after listening to the
contestants, by seating the members re
ported elected by the club.
The roll of the new general committee
was then called, and 383 out of the 450
members answered to their names.
J. A. Spinetti next arose, and in a brief
but eulogistic speech placed Major Har
noy in nomination for permanent chair-
man.
There was no opposition, and Harney
was elected by acclamation.
In aceptlng the office Harney said that
he would act for the best interests of the
Democratic party, and promised that in
his. rulings he would neither show fear
nor favoritism. -He then referred at con
siderable length to the disruption in the
ranks of the local Democracy, and said
that the committee over which he had
been. chosen to preside was in his opinion
the only representative Democratic or
ganization. "All that I ask," said he "is
that the organization be given a fair and
impartial hearing by the Stave Central
Committee when the question of the local
dispute is being considered. If that is
granted I am. and I know that you are
satisfied, to abide by the result. If there
is any question as to which of the local
organizations represents the Democracy,
let the State committee order an open pri
mary, and let the Democratic voters by
their ballots show who is entitled to rec
ognition."
William Asmussen, who ran for Treas
urer at the last general election, was then
elected vice-chairman by acclamation.
John F. McGowan, who was recording
secretary of the old committee, was re
elected in consideration of the valuable
services rendered by him to the party
during the last campaign.
â  J. C. Saulman was elected correspond
ing secretary and William B. Hines
treasurer.'
The committee then adjourned to the
call of the chairman after adopting the
following resolutions:
Resolved. By the representatives of the Dem
ocratic party of the City and County of San
Francisco, in council assembled:
That it is our earnest hope and prayer that
the state of war new existing between the
United States of America and the Kingdom of
Spain may be pursued with unrelenting vigor
and dispatch by those charged with its prose
cution, and that it may be brought to a speedy
and successful termination.
That the flag of Spain, which has been and
is still symbolic of murder, butchery, pillage
and of the basest treachery, ought to be driven
ignomlnlously from a continent dedicated to
freedom. i iis 'â¢'â  ' '.'
That we cordially indorse the action of tha
representatives of the Democratic party In
Congress â  assembled, aided by a few Independ
ent Republicans, to welcome the Republio of
Cuba among the sisterhood of nations as a
free and Independent state.
THEIR HANDS TIED.
No Money to Be Provided for Rela
tives of Officials Who Go to
War.
As the consolidation act limits the ex
penditure of public moneys and gives the
board no authority to expend moneys
raised for the support of the municipal
government for any other purpose, the
Finance Committee of the Board of Su
pervisors yesterday decided to report
against the adoption of the resolution
providing aid for the relatives of city
officials who resigned to give their serv
ices to the General Government In the
pending unpleasantness.
In the matter of the petition of the Pre
clta Valley Improvement Club for an ap
propriation in the next tax levy of $12,000
for the improvement of Bernal Park, it
was decided that proper provision would
be made for public square improvements
in the next tax levy.
Wadham Is Secretary.
The directors of the Eureka Society for
the Protection of Children have selected
a new secretary to look after the busi
ness. E. L. Wadham has taken the place
of Colonel Dimpfel. Although Mr. Wad
ham has not had much experience in this
line of business he is thoroughly familiar
with the city and people.

GRAND JURY
PROBES THE
DEPOT JOB
Four Witnesses Tes
tify Regarding the
Contracts.
Engineer Holmes Denies
All Knowledge of the
Financial End.
Admits That Many Changes
Were Made in the
Plans.
CONTRACTORS CALLED ON.
Three Men Who Wers Interested in
the Construction of the Building
Testify Briefly.
The ferry depot scandal was taken up
by the Grand Jury last night, and it will
be probed to its lowest depth, for the
members have accumulated a great quan
tity of evidence tending to throw light
on the unsavory mess, and are determined
to make those who have squandered the
people's money, if they have not actually
absorbed it illegally, suffer for their mis
deeds.
The session was short, only four wit
nesses being examined, and comparatively
little of importance was developed; but
next Thursday, when the matter will be
taken up again, some interesting develop
ments are expected. State Engineer
Howard C. Holmes and three of the con
tractors were examined last night, but,
naturally, they put on the best front pos
sible.
Engineer Holmes was examined at
length, being careful at all times not to
say anything that might reflect upon Ar
chitect Swain or the Harbor Commission
ers, who had charge of the construction
of the depot. Holmes admitted that there
had been many changes in the plans and
the materials, but set up in defense the
assertion that in every building the origi
nal plans are altered more or less.
Considerable stress was laid on the
point that the beauty of the interior had
been enhanci d by the alterations, but
when questioned closely regarding the
difference in the cost of those changes
Holmes said he knew absolutely nothing
about thHt. an he had nothing to do with
that part of the matter.
Fur instance, when asked if it was true
that Tennessee marble had been substi
tuted for white glazed bricks. Holmes
said it was. but headed off unpleasant
questions as regards the difference in
cost (the marble being much cheaper) by
asking the juryman if he would not pre
fer marble to brick, and then launched
into a tribute to the beauties of Tennessee
marble.
The subject of stone occupied consider
able time, and Holmes made it as easy
for Contractor McCarthy as possible. It
will be remembered that most of the bid
ders on thf stone work of the ferry depot
put in two bids, one on Oregon gray
and one on Colusa. the difference in the
price averaging about JfIOOO, the Colusa
stone being that much cheaper.
McCarthy bid on Oregon gray alone, his
bid being accepted. Afterward he was
allowed to change and substitute Colusa
stone at the pr:<-o be agreed to furnish
the other. Holmes said that at the time
the bids were opened the Colusa quarry
was not developed, and when his atten
tion was called to the fact that several
buildings in this city had already been
built of Colusa stone, he said the stone
used in those buildings was merely the
outcroppings.
The terra cotta, heating, plumbing and
iron contracts were all touched upon, and
Holmes told what h<' knew about them.
When he was finally excused. Captain
W. H. Taylor, of the Risdon Iron Works,
which had the iron contract, was sum
moned. He was briefly questioned about
the changes authorized in the iron and
work, and the comparative cost of
the original and the now plans.
P. y.rd. Bean, of the rirm of Gladding,
McÃean & Co., next testified to the alter
ations in the terra cotta work, his ex
amination occupying scarcely five mm
Utes, and then Thomas Butler was called
to tell what he knew about the masonry
work on the building. The Grand Jury
found he could tell all he knew, or all he
wnnted them to know, in about two min
ut>s. so after asking two or three minor
questions, the Grand Jury continued its
Investigation until next week. It will
probably require several weeks to get to
the bottom of the affair.
Held for Robbery.
The preliminary examination of Joseph
Theron, alias Thorne, John Wlnrow and
George Barker, charged with assaulting
and robbing Edward Liehscher, a grocer
on Mason and Pacific streets, was con
cluded before Judge Low yesterday and
they were held to answer before tho Su
perior Court it SriOOO bonds each. A strong
case was madt out against them.
REMINDERS OF A GOLDEN AGE.
Workmen in the Old Stock Exchange Uncover Inter
esting Relics of the Past.
J-ike a whitened sepuloher, the walls of the old Stork Exchange, at 411*4
California street, have been hiding under their coating of plaster the skele
tons of a vanished past that has given to the future the most interesting and
exciting chapter in the history of our State.
Some I'.vv days ago the Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, which was
San Francisco's stock board during the merry Con-Virginia days, set a
force of plasterers to work getting the place cleaned up and fitted for oc
cupancy.
The first step was to scrape the plaster from the sides of the room where
it had stuck for years. The tools were put to work and. as the plaster
fell, piece by piece, to the floor, it gradually uncovered caricatures in
scriptions and quotations traced on the bare walls berteath by hands that
once signed cheeks for millions.
They were all there, those old-time mining princes, who sported with
fortunes and laughed at practical jokes, the points of> which, sometimes
pierced to the very center of the mercantile world and transfixed whole
communities in their passage.
In one place on the wall was the drawing of a man wearing a peculiar
stiff-brimmed braver hat, long-tailed coat and a pair of trousers which were
held In place by straps passing under a pair of highly varnished boots
looking in the direction of a young and lovely female in hoop skirts and
curls. Beneath the sketch was a notice informing the public that "Billy"
Ralston would give thirty shares of Sierra Nevada to be twenty years
younger.
Another inscription, dated May 3, 1576, said "market broke to-day " How
many hearts and fortunes broke, how many lives and ambitions were shat
tered at the same, time, no one can tell.
In another corner of the room is a picture of two prize-fighters and
over the head of one is the name of Tom Chandler, while over the other
is the name of old Barney Farley. This sketch is of the vintage of '77
Along the wall are quotations of all the different stocks In existence at
that day. Some of them are still alive, but the great majority have be
come only memories, and to hear of their glory one must frequent the al
leys and byways where the wrecks of better days congregate and tell of
the time they counted their possessions by the thousands.
Not the least interesting of these reminders of the past is a very legible
writing on the east wall of the room. It contains in brackets the following
names with the statement that on the 6th of April, '77, they were all out
of stocks: Sharon, Mackay. Livingston, Ralston, Jones, Strauss, Vallejo
Williams, Grayson and Bradley. If that statement was the truth in '77 the
gentlemen mentioned have managed to collect a few during the intervening
twenty years.
The plasterers at work are now on the celling, and it will probably be
several days before the inscriptions will be completely obliterated. In the
meantime it would well repay some of the old fellows who were alive and
participated In the stirring times, when millionaires were made paupers at
the ticking of a watch, to brush up their memories by visiting the place and
looking at the historical names that adorn the walls.
BLOOD FLOWED
IN QUANTITY
Surprises "Were Sprung at
the Excelsior Ath
letic Club.
Billy Otts Gained the Decision
Over Jack Granfield in
Eight Rounds.
At the Manhattan Club Green and
NeÂ«i Fought a Spirited Four-
Round Bout.
Songs, knockouts, noise and princi
pally blood cheered the hearts of the
members of the Excelsior Athletic Club
last evening. It was the monthly
exibition held In their hall at Eighth
and Folsom streets, and many a ten
dollar piece has been paid to see sport
far below that presented to the large
crowd which gathered there to see the
fun.
J. J. Hourigan, master of ceremonies,
carried out the programme with pre
cision and good judgment and the of
ficers who gathered at the ring side i
with Sergeant Brophy kept good order ;
while the excitement was at its height, j
Mr. Leary was selected as timekeeper |
for the club during the preliminaries,
which proved to be surprises. The
first go was said to be a friendly con- j
test limited to three rounds, between \
Tom Lynch and Charles Heusman.
Both men appeared as giants and it j
was not supposed anything but a few ;
passes from each would be brought :
forth, but the crowd was badly mis- |
taken. In the first round Heusman :
commenced to force matters, and now j
he Is sorry he spoke. Lynch took up
the way things were progressing and |
with a few punches had his opponent â 
"going." When they toed the scratch
In the next round Lynch caught Heus
man on the point of the chin and lifted
him ceilingward, and with a thud the ;
unconscious man lit on the canvas and
was helped to his corner. It is more
than probable that the two men will
fight for a purse in the near future.
Eddie Toy and Jim Dougherty then
exhibited considerable skill with thÂ« â .
gloves, and they were followed by j
George Savage and H. Wiley in a three- j
round friendly contest, which proved '
to be out of the line drawn by the first i
two aspirants for slogging honors. Pat
Lynch and Jimmy Lawlor also gave an !
exhibition of how friends can spar
without becoming excited and blood- ,
thirsty, and Haggerty of Sacramento j
had it out with George Hanley of San j
Francisco in three spirited rounds.
Then came the favorites, Kelly, Mar
lowe and Hansen, with some songs, and
the announcement was made that the j
event of the evening was now in or- ;
der. C. H. Long acted as timekeeper j
for the club, with McQuiney and J. !
O'Leary holding the watches for the !
fighters, Billy Otts of the Excelsior \
Club and Jack Granfield of the San
Francisco Athletic Club. Gus Herget j
was chosen to act as referee.
Both men appeared to be in good
condition and were evenly matched. |
From the first clang of the bell the men
fought with a determination to do or
die. and until the last round, which was â 
the eighth, it looked as if the referee j
would declare the bout a draw, but at â 
a critical moment Otts showed his su- !
periority as far as cleverness was con- j
cerned and got the decision. Blood
simply flowed during the fight, and the
eyes of each seemed to be covered with
mud. The bodies of the fighters were
red from dripping blood and hard :
punches, and the spectators went wild
when the blows came the thickest. !
Both pugilists showed themselves to be |
willing to go the pace, and it is ru- j
mored a return match will be made in
the near future. It was announcd that ;
the Western Addition Athletic Club j
will hold its first monthly meeting on
May 17.
Thrashed by His Neighbors.
James Johnson, who resides at Sunny- j
side, was taken to the Receiving Hns- i
pital yesterday morning by Policeman j
Brown to have a lacerated wound In his ;
cheek stitched and dressed. His face was
also badly bruised. He stated that whll*
driving near Ingleside Thursday night hÂ« !
had been attacked by robbers and badlj
beaten. When taken to police headquar
ters he confessed that he had been beaten
by neighbors who had a grudge against
him. and that no attempt had been made
to rob him.
Woodmen of the World.
Western Addition Camp No. 306 of the
Woodmen of the World will give a grand
ball in the Social Hall of the Alcazar
this evening for the benefit of the emer
gency and relief fund. This will be the
first ball given by this camp.
Deacon Keppel Convicted.
The jury in the case of the United States
vs. Garret Keppel yesterday returned a
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 30, 189 S.
verdict of guilty of sending an obscene
pamphlet through the mails. He will be
sentenced by Judge de Haven on Mon
day.
Keppel fell In love with Mrs. W. S.
Little, a comely widow of West Biggs.
Butte County, and when the widow gave
him the cold shoulder "he published a
pamphlet interspersed with Scriptural
quotations and accusing her of having
yielded to his wiles.
EFFECT OF A JOKE.
Miss Mary Christmas Suffering From
Spinal Paralysis.
A cruel joke was perpetrated upon Miss
Mary Christmas, 9 Boston Place, Thurs
day night by National Guardsmen at the
armory on Ellis street, between Polx
street and Van Ness avenue.
She has two brothers who belong to tha
National Guard, and some one had told
her that they had been ordered to go to
the front at once. To satisfy herself she
went to the armory and asked some ot
the Guardsmen if it were true that her
brothers had been ordered to the front.
They solemnly assured her that such was
the case. Immediately she fell to the floor
in a fit and she appeared to be so bad
that the ambulance was summoned ami
she was taken to the Receiving Hospital.
An examination showed that she was
suffering from spinal paralysis, caused b>
the sudden shock, and the result might
be serious. She was sent to her hornÂ«Â»
later.
Young Ladies Entertain.
The members of the Young Ladles'
Sodality of the Sacred Heart Parish gave
a social and dance last Wednesday even-
Ing in their hall on Fell and Fillmore
streets to over 100 specially invited guests.
It was one of the most successful and en
joyable entertainments of this character
ever given by the society. The Interior
of the hall was one blaze of light and
artistic decorationâ flags and bunting
lined the walls on all sides, giving the ap
pearance of a fairy palace. Several toasts
were given, those responding being as
follows:
Rev. J. J. Cullen, Dr. Hugh Lagan,
Joseph McDonald, H. Dumont and D.
Sheer! n.
The following young ladies assisted in
entertaining the guests: Misses Edith
Halpln, Fanny Butler, Katherine McDer

In an interview published by the Virginia
i Chronicle Patrick Keryln, superintendent of
i the Brunswick Kxploration Company, says that
If the proposed arrangements ran be made with
the Comstock Tunnel Company, the first move-
I ment when work is begun on the tunnel level
will be to reopen the north drift, driven two or
three hundred feet north of the tunnel line fol
1 lowing the lode, soon after the completion of
i the tunnel. Rome high assays were obtained
: at that time, and the lode at tliat depth shows
I a broad belt of mineralized quartz over two
! hundred feet in width. Work through the shafts
j on the Brunswick will be continued as usual
i while explorations are in progress on the tun
nel level, as the shafts will be needed as air
ways. When connection Is made with the
'. shafts on the tunnel level the operating ex
' penses of the company will be materially re
duced, as all waste and ore extracted in drift-
Ing and raising will be run out through the
tunnel, thus dispensing with the use o. -istly
; hoist plants.

SINISTER
SHADOW CAST
BY HIS CRIME
Widber's Defalcation Threatens to
?<iterfere With the Collection
of Personal Taxes.
Litigation Over the Payment of the $100,000
Bond Will Deprive the City of This
Money for Some Time.
All the evils that Wldber's defalcation
may breed are apparently far from hav
ing been developed. Each succeeding day
is likely to see some fresh tangle evolved
from it. Yesterday the sinister shadow
of the ex-Treasurer's crime fell on the
Assessor's office. Unless Widber' a short
age is speedily made Rood to the city it
!s likely to lea-d to serious inconvenience,
!f not loss, to the city in the matter of
personal taxes.
As the matter now stands the city is
face to face with a lawsuit over the re
covery of the $100,000 bond of Widber, and
the resulting litigation may be so drawn
out that the machinery of the municipal
government â will be badly clogged by the
lack of the stolen money.
While the Fidelity and Deposit Company
of Maryland does not refuse to pay the
bond of SIOO.OOO, it mak. s conditions for its
payment that are not to the satisfaction
of the city authorities. The surety com
pany claims that it should first have the
right to realize upon the defaulting offi
cial's property, and then pay whatever
deficiency may remain, mi the part, of the
city It Is held that the surety company
should pay its bond, which was given by
them and accepted by the. city, without
other condition than that it should be
payable on the default of the Treasurer.
The matter of the course to be pursued
to collect the bond has been referred to
the City Attorney, and under the circum
stances it is the opinion of those versed
in legal lore that he will advise that Im
mediate suit be brought to recover from
thÂ» surety company. His opinion will in
all probability be presented to the Super
visors on Monday.
Assessor Siebc folt the first pinch of the
city's present poverty yesterday. He sent
the following: communication to the Fl-.
nance Committee of the Supervisors:
To the honorable the Finance Committee of
the B^ard of Supervisorsâ Crentlemen: The un
dersigned herewith makes application for an ap-
BO for extra clerks for the
month of June. IS&S. The appropriation for
extra clerk? for the Assessor's office this year

The communication was ordered placed
on file, as until the moneys abstracted
from the treasury by Widher are recov
nr] paid to the Treasurer the board,
it w;,f claimed, cannot consider or author
izt- ;his expenditure.
The same committee determined to rec

SENT TO PRISON
FOR THIRTY YEARS
Heavy But Warranted Sen
tence Passed on Charles
S. Dugan.
ThÂ« Prisoner Still Claims Ho Is In
nocent and Will Appeal
ihe Case.
Charles Spurgeon Dugan. a religious
pretender belonging to "God's Regular
Army." who was convicted of having
cruelly ill-treated little Alice Loy, an S
year-old girl, who was placed in his
charge, received a heavy but warranted
sentence yesterday at the hands of Judge
Wallace.
When Dugan was called for sentence
his attorneys asked for a new trial on
the usual statutory grounds.
Judge -Wallace, in denying the motion,
said that the defendant had been granted
a fair trial, and that there was no reason
for setting aside the verdict of the jury.
He then directed Dugan to stand up, and
without any comment sentenced him to be
imprisoned for thirty years in the State
penitentiary at Folsom.
Dugan, who throughout the trial had
shown the utmost indifference, bowed his
head when he heard the court's decree.
He quickly recovered himself, however,
and those who thought that he was about
to faint, were astonished when he re
marked in loud tones that he was a
Christian and innocent of the crime of
which he was convicted,
His attorneys then asked for and were
â ranted a twenty day's stay of execution
In order to give them time to prepare a
bill of exceptions on appeal of the case
to the Supreme Court.

ITCHING HUMORS I TS3LSSi2 r
tlon of the funds In the treasury and the
recent defalcation of A. C. Widber.
This action, if approved by the board
on Monday, will Interfere with the col
lection of hundreds of thousands of dol
lars due as personal taxes which must be
collected by the Assessor. The t"t;il
amount of personal taxes to be collected
is Jfioo.ooo. of this amount only about
Jl.io.ooi i was collected during the month of
April. This leaves $470,n00 to be collected
(hiring May and June. With, the present
force at the disposal of the Assessor it
will be an impossibility to get all this
money in by the Ist of July, when all tne
personal property taxes unsecured by real
estate should be in the city treasury.
With the Jfoioo asked for by the Assessor
he would secure an additional force of
sixty men.
When the Af=sesso- - s attention was
called to the action of the Finance
Committee, he expressed himself as fol
lows:
"The Board of Supervisors appropriated
only $67,000 for extra clerks for the As
sessor this year. The appropriation here
tofore has always been 175,000. The work
of completing the assessment ruii and
collecting the taxes cannot be done with
the appropriation which the board has I
made, so we have to ask for an additional :
appropriation of $6000 to complete the as- ,
sessment In the time provided by the law. !
"There is yet time to make the appro- !
priation, as we are asking it for the
month of June. We have enough to carry
us along for May. We think that when
the matter comes Â»;r before the Finance j
Committee again v. â¢ can explain the
matter to them and that they will give
us the extra appro priation. "It is cer
tainly to the advantage of the city to
have all the personal property taxes col- i
lected by us. because it is necessary for
the city to have this money. If we don't
get this appropriation we can't collect)
this money. We have $800,000 to collect
for these taxes. We started to collect on
April I, and have collected to date $13,000.
The great bulk of the amount will have
to be collected in May and June."
Although Wtdber's snfp in the Treas
urer's office was attached last week, no
attempt was made to ascertain its exact i
contents until yesterday. The work of
going over all the papers and books it
contained was performed in the presence
of Treasurer Reis. Chief Lees and repre
sentatives respectively of the Mayor and
th Sheriff. A block of Hale & Norcross
stock was found, also some papers be- -i
longing to the Treasurers office, docu- j
ments concerning Wldber's mining and
real estate properties and a number of
notes, presumably from persons to whom
Widber had made loans. Among the latter
was one for about $350 made by Eddie
Casey, a deputy in the County Clerks
office. All the private papers of Widher
have been placed in charge of the Sheriff,
who declines to divulge their nature, say
ing that the Chief of Police has given
these instructions, as some of the docu
ments may be needed as evidence against
Widber.

SUPERSTITION IN MEDICINE.
Dr. Henry Gibbons' Lecture Before
Cooper Medical College Last
Night.
"Superstition in Medicine" was the sub-
I ject of a lecture given by Dr. Henry Gib
' bons Jr. at Cooper Medical College last
â  night. In his introduction the lecturer
j quoted Mark Twain's aphorism, "Let me
make the superstition of the world and I
care not who makes the laws."
Superstition was defined as being exces
sive reverence for that which is unknown
or mysterious, and the speaker observed
that superstition has a close relationship
to religion, but is founded In ignorance
and credulity.
The Romans called those who escaped
from battle "Superstites," hence supersti
tion is that religion which remains when
the real religion is dead. From the crea
tion of man the mysterious, unseen and
| unexplained has governed him; in his
barbaric state he is a believer in sorcery.
Through 'succeeding centuries man finally
received some conception of an almighty
being who ruled the world according to
reason and law.
The lecture was interspersed with many
! humorous descriptions of attempted cures
] by superstitious practices among the ig
j norant in the early days.

THE SAy FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY APRIL 30, 1898.
POISON MIGHT
BE THE CAUSE
Two Young Brothers Die
Under Mysterious
Circumstances.
But One Day Elapsing Between
Their Deaths Causes a
Suspicion.
The Doctors, Unable to Diagnose the
Case, Appeal to the
Coroner.
The death of the two young; sons of Mr.
and Mrs. J. P. O'Connell occurring within
two days under circumstances which point
strongly to poisoning is being investigat
ed by the Coroner, and there is consider
able mystery attached to the case. One
Of the boys died Thursday morning pre
sumably of cholera infantum, and while
the end came sooner than the doctor in
attendance expected, he thought nothing
wrong in the case, so signed the death
certificate and the child was buried. The
following day the second boy died with
symptoms similar to those observed In
his brother. As the physicians were not
entirely satisfied with the diagnosis of the
malady of the first patient the matter
was reported to the Board of Health, and
the body of the second child given into
the- care of the Coroner.
James Joseph O'Connell was 4 years
! old and a particularly healthy child.
, Wednesday morning he complained of
pains in his stomach and was seized with
vomiting. The mother thought there was
nothing serious in the illness and applied
home remedies until late in the evening,
when, as the boy grew worse, Or. Conran
,of 860 Mission street was called. He
! found the boy in convulsions, and after
1 investigating the case decided that cholera
infantum was the trouble. He relieved the
suffering as much as possible, and appre
! hended no fatal termination of the at
tack. Greatly to the doctor's surprise, the
child died at 2 o'clock Thursday morning.
The death certificate was signed and the
body buried in Holy Cross Cemetery yes
terday morning.
While the body was still in the house,
Thomas P. O'Connell. 3 years old, was
taken sick in the same way that his
brother had been, and Dr. Bell, the reg
ular family physician, was railed to at
tend him. This boy was resting easy
when the funeral was held yesterday,
but on the return of the mother from the
funeral he was found to be worse, and
died shortly after 1 o'clock. Dr. Bell was
puzzled by the case, and decided that it
was one worthy of an investigation.
The mother of the children lives at
153 San Carlos avenue, where- she conducts
a small grocery-store and bakery. The
father is a blacksmith by occupation, but
is at present among the gold-hunters ot
Alaska, where he has been since last
January. Mrs. O'Connell says she does
â¢. not know where the children could have
'â  got any poison, as none was kept about
the place. The family has eaten no canned
goods, and the children have been to no
place where any were given to them.
There are three little girls in the family,
and the mother said these had not been
sick, but this is contradicted by Dr. Bell,
who states that all three have been sick
and vomiting much in the same way the
tw.i boys did. and that he has been treat
ing them. He admits that the symptoms
â which both boys exhibited might be due to
cholera infantum, but says that the
deaths were too sudden to be the result
of that disease. It is his opinion that
i they have been eating something that
contained poison, and he believes It
might be arsenic.
Dr. Gallagher, the autopsy physician of
the Coroner's office, made an examination
of the body of the child who died yester
day. The stomach was entrusted to Dr.
('. L. Morgan, the Morgue chemist, who
will make a chemical examination to-day.

Judge Barry Declares That the Money Is Not

On Sunday the California Wins Club
will open fire at live birds at the Ingle
side shooting grounds. The Reliance
Club will meet at the Webster-street
grounds, the Golden Gate Gun Club at
Alameda Junction and the Empire at
Alameda Point.
Doubtless the largest gathering will
witness the Empire's handicap pool and
merchandise shoot, which will commence
at 10 o'clock. In the merchandise event
all ties will be shot off at ten birds.
Although the streams are exceedingly
low and clear and trout consequently
wary, some very nice creels of fish were
taken during the week from coast
streams. Fred Johnson and a friend se

Johnson reports having seen several trout
of good size leaping in the deep water,

flies and other lures intended for their
capture.
W. Cooper was one of the fortunate
anglers who returned from Lagunitas
Creek last Sunday. The expert spoon
caster enticed three large trout to par

fellows made a very nice appearance
among a few dozen seven and eight-inch
fish which lined the bottom of his basket.

of Paper Mill Creek.
Striped bass are now being caught by !
anglers in the bay near Rodeo and Pinole j
Stations. I,ive shrimp is the most killing !
bait yet discovered.
John Butler, Frank Marcus and John i
Lemmer have had good success on Lake I
Lagunitas. The trout are in good condi
tion and will take a rty whenever the
water is ruffled by a breeze. Uait fishing
is not allowid.
It was reported yesterday from the I
headquarters of the Spring Valley Water i
Company that owing to the extreme low
water of Lakes San Andreas and Pilar
citas permits for aneling will not be
given this season.
NOT A RAILROAD JURY.
Verdict for 8500 in Favor of Mrs. !
Honorah Burns.
â  One of the new juries, free from the
railroad influence, rendered a verdict in
favor of Mrs. Honorah Burns for $500 last
evening, in her suit for /damages against i
the Geary Street Railway.
Mrs.. Burns was : injured in March, 1593,
by being thrown from one of the Geary
street cars on Point Lobos 1 avenue, "near
First Â£ avenue! She had boarded the car
whtn .it started suddenly, : and then 'â  as
suddenly stopped; then it started forward
again : with -redoubled â  speed, â â < and- the !
woman, who was sitting on : the dummy, I
waÂ«; thrown violently to the â¢ ground -. and j
knocked senseless. - . â  - .
â¢ Tne car. was nearly opposite the power- !
house "at. First â¢ avenue, and the uncon
scious ; woman was : taken in , there and |
surrounded by employes of the road, who j
den:nnued her name â  and address. When j
she came to she- was put on another car !
and 'Sent home.. ; â  -â  â 
She brought suit, and last Tuesday it i
came up â  for trial in "' JudgeDaingerfield's
court, i Reuben H. Lloyd. Peter F. Dunne I
ana -Alexander Heyneman were retained i
by .the ; company,; and Samuel M. Short
ridge. fought the case for the woman. The
delense was , that â  Mrs. Burns t was under
tut Influence of liquor, and that she step
ped oft ( the car i herself; but â¢ this " conten
evading the answer that the element of
consideration had been wholly absent.
The Judge rendered no written
opinion, but his statement was ample
and lucid. He said the only point he
had to consider was as to whether the
deposit had been made voluntarily. He
concluded that when a citizen applied
for a meter and was informed that he
cnuld secure one only by advancing a
certain sum that the payment was not
voluntary, but the result of coercion.
There was therefore nothing for him
to do but decide for the plaintiff.
This suit is of vastly more importance
than appears on its face. There are
thousands of people who are awaiting
the final outcome, and if the Superior
Court shall sustain Judge Barry there
will be such a run on the gas companies
that they will be forced out of the
banking business.
Meanwhile whoever has a deposit
with either concern can pet it back by
ordering out his meter, settling his ac
count, and then ordering the meter re
placed. The cashier of the Gas and
Electric Company was good enough to
give the public this tip while on the
stand.
tion was overthrown, and the verdict was
rendered in her favor, with costs, last
evening, after the jury had deliberated
Lr.t a short time.
A Valuable Specimen.
The State Mining Bureau is in receipt
| of a valuable specimen known as platt
i nerite, or dioxido of lead. In the com
; mercial world this mineral has but little
; value, but to the curiosity hunter its
; value is estimated at about $90 a pound.
This value is because of its being so
scarce. The specimen comes from the
mine of \V. J. Clark of Mullen, Idaho.
Mr. Clark has sei t a similar specimen to
the Smithsonian Institution, where it is
highly prized.
Says He Is All Right.
Mrs. Powers, the mother of Thomas
Powers, the man who was arrested last
Wednesday on a charge of burglary, says
the police are in error when they Pay
her son was ever arrested before. She
says he is not a burglar, nor has he ever
given the police any trouble. It was
reported by the police that Powers was a
sneak thief.
