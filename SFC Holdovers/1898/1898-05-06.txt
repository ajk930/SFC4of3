GOVERNMENT PREPARING
AN EXPEDITION TO HELP
DEWEY HOLD HIS PRIZE
It Is Proposed to Take Six Thousand Men and
to Raise the Sunken Ships of Spain
to Fight the Spanish.
NEW YORK, May 5.â The Her
ald's Washington correspondent
telegraphs: Active preparations
were being made to-day by both
the War and Navy departments
for reinforcing Commodore Dewey
at Manila, and sending out suffi
cient men and supplies to hold the
islands and maintain order. If a
report is received from the com-
modore within the next few days
the details of the expedition may
depend largely upon his repre
sentations as to the situation. The
War Department is preparing to
send about 6000 men with camp
supplies, field guns and horses for
the cavalry and artillery. Addi
tional sailors and marines will also
be sent to Commodore Dewey, and
the Navy Department has directed
Admiral Kirkland, at the Mare Isl
and Navy-yard, to provide pro
visions for 2000 men for three
months. The^e provisions are for
Commodore Dewey's men and the
sailors and marines who will be
sent out with the expedition.
As was stated in the Herald this
morning the army authorities in
California have been given full
power to obtain the necessary
transports for troops. 1 am in
f formed that bids for these trans
ports have already been presented
/ by several steamship companies on
the Pacify Coast.
It has not been definitely decid
ed as to the exact time when this
expedition will leave San Fran
cisco. The department will take
no action until communications

have been received from the Asi
atic Squadron. Some time will
aiso be consumed in organizing the
army and obtaining for it such
equipments as will be necessary.
The only convoy which will go
with these transports will be the
cruiser Charleston. This ship is
now undergoing all necessary re
pairs, and to-day Captain Glass
was detached from the command
of the Pensacola and ordered to
command the Charleston. Several
more of her officers were also or
dered to-day.
The steamship City of Peking
will be fitted out immediately at
Mare Island as an immediate ma
chine ship and will go with the ex
pedition to Manila. Her crew will
consist mainly of naval engineers
and first-class machinists. She will
have improved apparatus neces
sary to repair any damage which
may have been done the ships in
Commodore Dewey's fleet.
It is the purpose of Naval Con
structor Capp, who will be in
charge of the machinists on the
boat, to raise and put in perfect
condition the disabled ships of the
Spanish squadron. For this pur

The machinists in this expedition
will be taken nearly exclusively
from Mare Island Navy Yard and

with their proposed work.

TORONTO, Ontario, May s.â Senor
Polo dc- Bernabe. formerly Minister to
the United States, who leaves here to
morrow fur Montreal, en route for Mad
rid, has been the cause of an interna
tional discussion, the outcome of which
has been his departure from Canada at
a much earlier date than he at first in
tended. Three days ago he received a
long dispatch from Madrid requesting
that as early as possible he should quit
Canada. The dispatch intimated that
Sir Julian Pauncefote had reported to
Lord Salisbury that the United States
Government had made no official or
unofficial representation to him rela
tive to Senor Polo, but that public opin
ion, as represented by the press and
many public men of broad views in the
States, were excited over his stay In a
friendly State at and on the borders of
the Union by the former Minister, who
was in a position to give valuable in
formation to Madrid. Lord Salisbury
put the matter before the Government
at Madrid, with the result that Senor
Polo will leave here to-morrow. He
spent the day in preparation for his
departure.

MADRID, May s.â lt is
said that two ironclads,
two cruisers and three
transports are about to
leave Cadiz to drive the
Americans from Manila
and then bombard Cali

The debate on the
Government's policy

severely criticized the
Government for its lack

MOVING FOR THE

An Asylum Prepared at the Capital of
Austria for the Reception of
Spanish Royalty.
NEW YORK, May s.â The Herald's Washington cor
respondent telegraphs: United States troops will be on
Cuban soil before to-morrow morning. Officially, the au
thorities positively refuse to discuss the question of the time
for invading Cuba, but the above statement was made to
me to-night by a gentleman in the confidence of those who
have the plan of campaign in hand.
Just how many troops have embarked for Cuba this
gentleman could not tell me, but he felt sure that it was not
less than 5000. This body of troops is regarded as an ad
vance guard of the invading army of 15,000 men which will
be embarked for the purpose of attacking Havana in the rear
as soon as the navy is ready to begin the bombardment of
the fortifications at the entrance of the harbor. ,
The understanding is that the troops will be landed
at some point between Mariel and Havana, where they will
meet the insurgents from General Garcia's army and hold a
base of supplies preliminary to a move on Havana when the
rest of the army has been landed and the vessels of Admiral
Sampson's fleet are ready for action.

cerning him, and 1 am confi
dent he will communicate

first favorable opportunity."
This statement was made
to me this afternoon by Sec
retary Long in answer to a

it is due to the relatives and

Queen Regent of Spain in case she arrives before apartments have
been prepared for her in her brother's palace.
"Telegrams from the Austriaan Embassador at Madrid, Count Du

VALENCIA, May 5. â Riots continue to be the order of the day.

Caceres, Talavera and Gijon have also been the scenes of wild riot
and tumult, which ended in pillage and robbery. Grain and provision
stores ire being gutted and merchant offices broken into and robbed.
All these disturbances are due to economic causes, to a great
dearth of wheat and the consequent advance in the price of bread, and
the closing of the factories and workshops owing to complete paralyza
tion of trade and the prohibitive prices of coal and raw materials.

KEEN WATCH
FOR SPANISH
TORPEDO-BOATS
It Is Expected That the Govern
ment Will Hear prom Them
Not Later Thar) Monday.
NEW YORK, May 5. â A Washington special to the Herald says:
By Monday next the officials believe they will learn the position of the
Spanish armored cruisers and torpedo boat destroyers. Steaming at the
rate of fifteen knots an hour, it is estimated by experts that they
ought to cover the 2400 miles separating St. Vincent from San Juan
de Porto Rico by to-morrow.
Cdins at their most economical speed of ten knots, Monday will be
the date of their arrival. Instructions to the American liners acting as
scouts require them to be particularly observant during the next week
in order that information may be obtained without delay of the where
abouts of the enemy. A prominent engineer officer told me to-day that
he h:id no doubt the report that the Spanish men-of-war were short
of engineers and machinists is correct.
â¢'I have looked into the matter," he continued, "and I have found
that most of the engineers and machinists of enemy's vessels are Eng
lish or Scotch. Under the plea that they are not allowed to serve in
time of war because of the foreign enlistment act of their country' they
have been leaving the ships' service. The Spaniards themselves are not
a mechanical race. They are a commercial and agricultural people, and
I have no doubt they will be greatly handicapped by their lack of
experienced engineers and machinists. The recent report of damage
tn their torpedo boats while at St. Vincent I have no doubt is true and
the damage was the result of the handling of machinery by inexpe
rienced men."

In army and navy circles
the report is current that
Great Britain has denied the
agents of this Government
the use of the cable from
Hongkong on the plea of neu

"This report cannot be
true," said a State Depart
ment official with- whom I
talked. "You wiil recall that
the Spanish Captain-General
during the battle notified
Madrid over the cable con
necting Manila and Hongkong
and thence from Hongkong
that the Spanish fleet had
been destroyed, and sent va
rious other reports before the
cable was cut. Great Britain
cannot now deny this Gov
ernment's agents the use of
the cable. Neutrality with
respect to cables means that
the Government that controls
them shall permit the bellig

not permit one to use them
to the exclusion of the other.
"As soon as Commodore
Dewey's dispatches are re

"Besides what I have stat
ed the London Government
is evidently desirous of fa
voring the United States in
the present war, and would
undoubtedly not raise at this
time the point that a bellig

it is the confident belief of
administration officials that
the next twenty-four hours
will witness the end of their
suspense, and that they will
be in receipt of official infor
mation from Commodore
Dewey which will guide
them in their future plans. Jn
the meantime every prep

THE REVENGE
OF A CUBAN
Weyler's Relative in
Grave Peril at Key
West.
How Laborde Paid Back an
Insult to a Helpless
Prisoner.
Men Captured on the Argonauta
Taken North as Prisoners of
War. x
KEY WEST, Fla., May s.â The pris
oners captured on the steamer Argo
nauta were sent north on the steamer
City of Key West this morning. They
were a colonel and nine staff officers,
one sergeant and nine privates. A
guard of ten soldiers of the Twenty
fifth United States Infantry, command
ed by Lieutenant Moss, acted as escort.
Unusual precautions were taken by
the military authorities here to pre
vent the Cubans wreaking summary
vengeance on Colonel Vicento de Corti
jo. Colonel De Cortijo is distantly re
lated to General Weyler and was on his
staff during the latter's reign in Cuba.
For more than a year he was governor
of Cabanas fortress, where most of the
Cuban political prisoners are confined,
and was noted for his cruelty to the
captives. He is said to have been par
ticularly venomous toward any Cu
bans suspected of sympathy with the
insurgents..
His cruel acts numbered hundreds
and the Cubans swore to have his life.
On this account Colonel De Cortijo's
capture was purposely kept from the
Cubans here by the United States au- j
thorities. What seemed a retributive \
circumstance, however, placed his life j
in imminent peril.
The Competitor incident, which oc
curred during Weyler's rule, was one of
the first events which stirred the peo- I
pie of the United States to a realiza- j
tion of the condition in Cuba. The j
captain of the ill-fated Competitor was :
Alfredo Laborde, a Cuban. He had rei- !
atives in the insurgent army, and was
known to be an active sympathizer in
the cause of Cuba libre. When La
borde was consigned to a dungeon in
Cabanas fortress, he was brought be
fore Colonel De Cortijo. Laborde,
knowing himself to be unjustly de
tained, requested permission to make a
statement to the governor of the prison.
In response Colonel De Cortijo leaned
across his magistrate's desk and delib- !
erately spat in Laborde's face. The ;
Spanish officials present openly ap- |
plauded this act of their superior tow- i
ard a helpless prisoner.
Laborde was then cast into a cell far
beneath the earth, but he took an oath
to revenge himself on the man who had
Insulted him. Time and Consul Leo j
brought about Laborde's release from !
Cabanas fortress, but a price had been I
put on his head by Weyler and he
could not return to Cuba to get ven
geance. .
Weyler was recalled, and with him
went Colonel Cortijo. His absence only
fanned the fire of Laborde's hatred.
Two years passed. When war between
Spain and the United States began, he
volunteered his services as pilot to Ad
miral Sampson. He was accepted and
assigned to the gunboat Nashville. His
knowledge of all the intricacies of the
Cuban coast and its waters mad* him
very valuable. When the Argonauta,
with Colonel De Cortijo and staff on
board, was intercepted off Cienfuegos
and captured, fate decreed that the
prisoners should be taken on the Nash
ville to Key West. One of the first
men to see Colonel De Cortijo after he
was taken over the Nashville's side
was Laborde.
Then ensued a dran.'atio scene. With
his face pale with the degrading recol
lection, Laborde stepped directly in
front of the Spanish colonel. "Do you
remember me?" he asked, in Spanish.
Colonel De Cortijo looked at the white â 
faced man for several seconds, then
shook his head.
"Perhaps Cabanas fortress and this,"
ejaculated Laborde, spitting in De Cor- I
tijo's face, "will assist your memory."
It was De Cortijo's turn to grow pale,
but he did not reply. A naval officer
orderpd Laborde away and the incident
closed.
The prisoners will be taken direct to
Fort McPherson, near Atlanta. They
seemed glad to get away from Key
West, for there are too many Cubans
here. Just before leaving their bag
gage was searched, and it is said docu
ments were found which will be for
warded to Washington.

RUSSIA YET A
FIRM FRIEND
Czar Nicholas Is Not Dis

Foreign Diplomats Begin to Realize
the Warm Feeling of England

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, May 5.
A leading Russian diplomat said to
day that the cable report from London
stating that Emperor Nicholas of Rus
sia was much disturbed as to the ulti
mate destiny of the Philippines and
that some sort of immediate interven
tion was probable, was entirely un
warranted and placed Russia in a mis
leading position before the people of
this country. He says the sentiment
throughout Russia, official and unoffi
cial, is one of extreme cordiality to
ward the United States, and it shows
there will be no change in the tradi
tional friendship existing between the
United States and Russia. The friend
ly feeling, he pointed out, was shown
by the Russian newspapers which ar
rived in the mail to the Russian Em
bassy yesterday. They were published
just after the declaration of war, and
their comment was, without exception,
of the most friendly character toward
the United States. He said this feel
ing prevailed to a marked extent even
among the peasantry of Russia, and it
was a matter of surprise to him under
such circumstances that reports
should be circulated in the United
States that Russia was about to as
sume an unfriendly attitude toward
this country.

sini, is expected here some time next

saint's day after whom the Empress

Russian officials went to Fort Monroe,
where they will have the opportunity
incidentally of seeing Commodore
Schley's flying squadron.
General Mertwego, the Russian na
val and military representative hero,
has not yet arranged to go to Cub<Â»,
and it is felt the important operations
are still some time off.
At the several foreign headquarters
to-day the speech of Lord Salisbury
before the Primrose Club last night
was regarded as deeply significant, in
that it was the first expression from
a high official source clearly indicat
ing the sympathy of the British Min>
lstry in the present course of the United
States.
In British quarters Lord Halisbury's
speech is received with much satisfac
tion, as another evidence of cordiality
between this country and Great Brit
ain. At the same time it is stated with
the greatest posltiveness that this
friendly feeling has at no time taken
form in the way of an entente, or un
derstanding of ny kind. It is regarded
as none the less helpful, as leading
toward further cohesion and ympat l^""
between the English-speaking people
on both sides of the water.
The Paris report that the United
States "has promised to capture the
Canary Islands and rede them to Great
Britain" is characterized at the State
Department and by leading diplomats
as purely fanciful. The State Depart
ment gives a specific denial.
The foreign embassies and legations
have received notification from the
State Department that any cipher ca
bles they may desire to send to their
Consuls at Havana. Porto Rico or

Interrupted or censored.
The Japanese Minister. Mr. Hoshi,
was among the callers at the State De
partment to-day. He had not heard
from Manila and thought information
might come by way of Formosa, to
which place Japan had laid a cable.
The Minister does not credit reports
that Hawaii is about to be turned over
to the United States. He says Japan
has 'nothing to say if Hawaii is ac
quired by the United States in the usual
way by treaty so long as Japan's in
terests in Hawaii are safeguarded. But
he feels that it would be unfortunate
to have the acquisition occur through
any sudden, surprising move, particu
larly in view of tha friendly relations
just at present existing between the
United States, Great Britain and
Japan. Mr. Hophi is inclined to believe
that when the Japanese decree of neu
trality is in hand it will disclose that
coal is not made a strict contraband of
war.

CHICKAMAUGA NATIONAL PARK,
May 5. â Orders were received from the
War Department to-day by (General
Brooke, commanding the provisional
army corps at Chickamauga Park, to
dispatch, the Twenty-fifth Infantry
(colored), Colonel Burt commanding,
with all speed possible to Tampa.
Two companies of this regiment are
now at Dry Tortugas, and It is believed
that the destination of the remainder
of the regiment is the samÂ» point. It
is further believed that the regiment
will shortly go to the fron, 1 as Colonel
Burt, who has been named as a briga
dier general in the volunteer army, is
expected to go south with his command.
It is the purpose to embark early to
morrow evening. The Tenth Cavalry
(colored) is expecting orders to move
to-morrow as are also the Sixth and
Third Cavalry.
The court-martial trial of Private
Marshall, Tenth Cavalry, which was
stationed near Fort Missoula, began to
day. When the Twenty-fifth Infantry
left Fort Missoula Marshall was greatly
disappointed that he was not allowed
to go to the front also and he immedi
ately left his command and beat his
way South by telling conductors on the
various railroads that he belonged w
the Twenty-fifth and had been acci
dentally left behind. He reached Chick
amauga several days ahead of his com
mand and was immediately put under
arrest.
Captain Oscar J. Brown, First Cav
alry, has been appointed colonel of a
Georgia volunteer regiment and given
an indefinite leave of absence from the
regular army.
DIFFERENCE IN TIME.
The world generally reckons longitude and time from the meridian of
Greenwich Observatory on the outskirts of London.
The earth turns through 360 degrees in twenty-four hours, hence 15 de
gTees difference in longitude makes one hour difference in time, 1 degree
makes four minutes, and one minute longitude four seconds of time.
Standard time now in use by transportation lines all around the world
is Greenwich time, at the nearest meridian of 15 degrees, or an even multi
ple thereof. Thus, as New York is near the seventy-fifth meridian from
London and San Francisco is near the one hundred and twentieth meridian
by standard time, when it is noon at London it is 7 a. m. at New York and
4 a. m. at San Francisco, which is actually four minutes slow by solar time
for New York and ten minutes fast for San Francisco. Manila is 120 de
grees 52 minutes east of London. So when it is noon at London it is 8 p. m. by
standard time at Manila, making 16 hours between San Francisco and Manilla
by standard time (16 hours 23 minutes actually). The reckoning of the new
day begins on the one hundred and eightieth meridian in the middle of the
Pacific Ocean, where it is JUHt midnight when it is noon at London. Thus
when It Is one minute past noon at London May 6 it is one minute past 12
o'clock a. m. May 1 on the one hundred and eightieth meridian.
THE REPLY
OF MILES
TO MOSBY
Stirs Up Something of a
Sensation at Wash
ington.
It Has NÂ°t Beer) Supposed That
iQfluence Had Arjything to Do
With Commaods iQ the
Arn)y.
NEW YORK, May s.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent says: De
spite President McKinley's announce
ment that "political influence" will
have no weight in army appointments,
it now seems probable that Colonel
John S. Mosby, who has applied for
command, will be compelled to resort to
the services of politicians before he
gains his wish.
I asked General Miles to-night if the
published report were true that he had
replied to General Mosby's telegram
offering his services to the Government
with the suggestion that he "see his
Senators" and exert what influence he
could.
The general appeared much disturb
ed by the question, and said to me very
determinedly that he had nothing to
say in regard to the matter.
"I cannot see," said General Miles,
"how these things become public. It
certainly looks to me as though some
one had been tampering with private
telegrams. I have received a message
from General Mosby and he has offered
hes services and asked for a command. I
Further than this I have nothing to say
OQ the subject."
There has been considerable specula
tion as to what would be the outcome
of the matter since General Miles' re
ply to Mosby became public. An army
officer said to me this evening: "If
it is true that General Miles toM Mosby
that he must get political influence in j
order to secure command, he has placed \
himself in a rather embarrassing posi
tion. Mosby's reply that he had no in
fluence except his military record was
most appropriate. He was a good cay- i
airy commander, as the Union army
found to their sorrow, during the war,
and if he has applied for a command
now he surely deserves one."
COLONEL MOSBY HAS
NO POLITICAL PULL
Colenel John S. Mosby, the famous Con
federate raider, said last evening, in re
gard to the tender of his services to the
Government and the reply of General
Nelson A. Miles, in which the latter advised
him to secure the influence of his Sena-
tors:
"I wrote to General Miles two weeks
ago, just about the time that the reso
lutions passed, and on the day that Presi
dent McKinley sent his ultimatum to
Congress I, telegraphed offering my serv
ices to the Government. I did so, not out
of vanity or thinking that my services
would be of any value, but because I
thought, and so wrote, that any Con
federate officer who had won prominence
in the late war should offer his services
and thus show his loyalty to the flag. It
1 had served in the Union army 1 would
not have done so.
"Last Saturday I received a letter from
the general, in which he said he recom
mended me for a position in connection
with the troops that were to be raised
in the South. When I received the tele
gram from Miles advising me to secure
the influence of my Senators I was great
ly surprised. I could not understand why
thc-y wanted political influence as a con
dition of accepting my services as a sol
dier. They know my war record. 1 fought
against Miles, against McKinley in the
Shenandoah and against Alger. and what
the devil good can White or Perkins do.
Major McKinloy knew me before he ever
heard of White or Perkins. Another
thing, you know the publication of war
records, which has been going on during
the past ten or twelve years, is superin
tended by a joint board of Union and
Confederate officers. General Marcus
Wright, chairman of the Confederate
Board, voluntarily wrote me two years
ago that he had read every report and
dispatch of General Robert E. Lee. and
that there wore more complimentary no
tices of me than of any other man in the
whole Confederate army."
As thf gray-haired officer thought of
their forgetfulness he became more heat
ed. "After the war General Grant wrote
his memoirs when he was dying at Mount
McGregor, and he paid ihe highest tribute
to me both as a man and as a soldier.
Now, I say, the President. General Miles
and Secretary of War Alger know my
record perfectly well. and. as it was in
dorsed by General Lee during the war
and by General Grant afterward, for me
to ask some Congressman to indorse my
fitness as a soldier would be like ankiiiK
Vanderbilt to indorse a tramp's note to
give him credit. If my record as a soldier
is not recognized by the Government I
can stay at home. I have done my duty.
"General Miles is a friend of mine, and
his suggestion was friendly advice. I have
not a bit of influence, and I don't think
that politics or influence would be neces
sary- I would not ask a Congressman to
indorse me if it was to make me a
major-general; I have too much pride.
I did not say one word about rank or
commission, but offered 'my services to
the Government.
"My son Beverly, who is a lawyer in
Salt Lake City, wrote me that he would
leave in an hour for Virginia, where he
will fight in the ranks of a Virginia regi
ment."

LOOKING FOR
SPAIN'S FLEET
Aided by Scouts Scouring
the Atlantic in Advance
of His Squadron.
Some Reason to Believe the
Boasted Armada Has Igno
miniously Gone Back
to Cadiz.
LONDON, May 6. â The Daily Mail's Paris correspondent hears on un
disputable authority that five Spanish ships including Pelayo and Al
fonso X^II are not yet supplied with ammunition.
The Daily Mail's Paris correspondent says that want of ammuni
tion for the Cadiz I'.eet caused delay in the sailing of the Cape Verde
fleet and will probably compel the latter to return to Cadiz.
NEW YORK, May sâ The Her
ald's Washington correspondent sends
the following:
Within a day's sail of Porto Rico and
within a comparatively short distance
of the United States, the armor-clads
of Rear-Admiral Sampson's squadron
are ready to leap upon the enemy as
soon as his whereabouts is learned.
Patrolling hundreds - r miles of ocean
to the east of Porto Rico, on a degree
of longitude chosen by the Naval Board
of War. are the eyea of Rear-Admiral
Sampson â the scouts whose duty it is
upon the appearance of the erctny to
hasten to a cable station to inform the
Navy Department of what they have
seen and then to speed under all steam
to the point where Rear-Admiral Samp
fleet is waiting to impart to its
commander the news they have ob
tained.
Authoritative information that I ob
tained to-day shows that in sending
Rear-Admiral Samp on with his armor
clads away from Key West the Naval
War Board was guided solely by the
feature of its plan of campaign which
requires the destruction of the Spanish
fleet before the Government shall enter
upon the reduction of Porto Rico or be
fore any extensive invasion of Cuba is
set on foot.
While taking every precaution for the
safety of the battle-shio Oregon, the
gunboat Marietta and the cruiser Nicth
t-roy (or Buffalo), it is not proposed
to re-enforce them by any of Rear-Ad
tniral Sampson's fleet unless the scouts
report that they have found the en
emey's squadron steaming to the south
ward, when armor-clads will be sent
poste haste after them.
Captain Clark's instructions, given
him before his departure from Rio
Janeiro, give to him the route he shall
take to reach northern waters, but no
surprise need be experienced if it should
be found fifteen days hence that the
( >regon has attached herself to Rear-
Admiral Sampson's command, while
her consorts have continued their voy
age to Key West.
Having a division of the Atlantic
squadron stationed at the strategic
point selected, it will not be a difficult
matter, the Naval Board believes, to
rarry out the rect of the plan deter
mined upon. The St. Louis, Harvard
and Yale have each been given a cer
tain district to patrol up and down,
which they cruise day and night, always
alert for the^first ?i^n of smoke on the
horizon which will reveal the enemy's
squadron. The districts lected were
picked out by the board because the
Spanish fleet bound from St. Vincent to
the Caribbean Sea. Porto Rico or any
point in the United States would have
to pass through one of then to reach
its destination.
The war experts have compared the
position of i>t. Vincent with the west to
the center of a circle, with the United
States, Porto Rico and the Caribbean
Sea forming an arc. The enemy's fleet
will have to sail along one of the radii
to reach any point on the arc, and these
radii pass through the districts which

NEW YORK, -May 5.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Word has
reached Washington o^ the successful
landing of General Nunez and his
party, comprising about a dozen Cuban
officers, with arms and equipments for
the insurgents, at a point in Cuba east

CAPE HAI-.EX, Hayti, May
s.â The captain of the German
steamer Castilla, which has just
arrived here, reports that some
Spanish vessels have been coal
ing and taking on ammunition at
St. Thomas.
He also said he saw Spanish
warships patrolling outside the
harbor of St. Thomas.
are now being patrolled by the Amer
ican scouts.
Assured, therefore, of the prompt dis
covery of the Spanish men-of-war upon
their appearance, and of the immediate
transmission of the news to Rear-Ad
miral Sampson, the next point to be
determined by the board was as to the
place and manner of giving battle in or
der that the advantage might be with
the American forces. Of course Rear-
Admiral Sampson will give battle
whenever he comes across the Spanish
force, and confidence is felt that he will
be able to defeat it. But should the
Spanish men-of-war arrive at San Juan
before the American fleet, reaches there
it will be the duty of 'Rear-Admiral
Sampson to station his rieet before the
harbor and. in the words of the expert
to whom I talked, thus completely
"bottle them up."
In stationing Rear-Admiral Samp
son's force between Key West and
Porto Rico the War Board had in
vie v the protection of the. cities of the
Atlantic coast and the prevention of
any attempt on the part of Spain's war
ships to break the blockade of the Cu
ban coast. The vessels which he took
with him from Key West include the
battleships Indiana and lowa, the ar
mored cruiser N^w York, the monitor
Puritan and several torpedo boat de
stroyers.
While a formidable force has been
left behind, including the three moni
tors, Amphitrite, Terror and Mianto
nomoh, their slow speed would prevent
them from coming up with the enemy,
and it will therefore be necessary to
place the annor-clads within strikine
distance should the enemy out in an
appearance in their rear.
Rear-Admiral Schley's squadron will
not be called upon to re-enfo cc Rear-
Admiral Sampson's command unless
such action should be necessary. The
squadron will remain at Hampton
Roads to assist the northern patrol
squadron in the defense of the coast.
Should it be definitely 'earned that
the Spanish fleet is not on its way
across the ocean the probabilities are
strong that a battle-ship, either the Ore
gon or Indiana, will be assigned to
Commodore Schley's force. The New
Orleans will take the place of the Co
lumbia, which has been assigned to the
northern patrol squadron, and the fleet
will start to sea on a cruis- to the east
ward of Porto Rico.
Rear-Admiral Sampson's force will
then be left to continue the work of re
ducing the fortifications of Cuba and
Porto Rico, and by depriving Spain of
these bases of supplies prevent her mak
ing any extensive attack upon the coast
of the United States.
of whose soldiers they have landed in
Cuba.
Senor Gonzalo de Quesada, secretary
to the Cuban delegation, has returned
to Washington from New York. His
visit to Gotham \vas to communicate
with other Cubans on the subject of
the organization of a Cuban-American
corps, which, under the command of
General Nunez of the army of libera
tion, will co-operate witht the Ameri
can army of invasion. Senor Quesada
said that New York City would furnish
one full regiment of twelve companies.
Only native Cubans would be enlisted.
Regiments were being recruited at New
Orleans, Galveston and other Texas
points, Atlanta, Baltimore, Cincinnati,
Chicago, St. Louis, Jacksonville, Mo
bile. Tampa and Key West.
The American Government has
equipment for the Cubans ready and
will cover the landing of the corps on
Cuban soil with the guns of the block
ading fleet.
With this Cuban corps will be several
batteries of rapid fire guns, and a stock
of military stores?, including medicines,
food and ammunition.

THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 6, 1898.
HOW SAMPSON
GOT ORDERS
Burned to Emulate the
Good Example of
. Dewey.
Had Some Hot Correspondence
With the Naval Author
ities at Washington.
Then the Big Boats Sailed Away and
Everybody Looks for
a Fight.
Copyrighted, lE9B, by James Gordon Bennett.
KEY WEST, Fla., May s.â Admiral
Sampson sailed at daybreak yesterday.
He took with him the flagship New
York, the battle-ships lowa and Indi
ana, the cruiser Detroit and the torpedo
boat Porter. This formidable force
will be augmented by the monitors Ter
ror and Amphitrite and two of the tor
pedo-boats now doing patrol duty along
the coast of Cuba. At present the
Terror is blockading Matanzas, while
the Amphitrite is doing similar work off
Cardenas. Late last night the Mar
blehead, fully coaled, left the harbor
and sailed away in the wake of the
big ships. This leaves the monitor
Puritan still here, the cruiser Cincin
nati, half a dozen gunboats and reve
nue cutters and the torpedo-boat Erics
son.
Admiral Sampson's desination is not
known. There is little doubt, how
ever, that it is Porto Rico. Among
the officers of the fleet this is the only
opinion held. While the big ships were
here the officers came ashore in great
numbers and freely discussed the pros
pective movements of the fleet. For
a week they have been daily expecting
the fleet to move to Porto Rico. The
order for the big ships to return to Key
West to coal was to be the signal.
While here news of the victory of
Dewey came. It was a spark to fire
the ardor suppressed for weeks. Ad
miral Sampson sat on his flagship and
fretted and fumed. He burned to em
ulate Dewey. It is well known among
the fleet officers that Sampson has
chafed dreadfully under the restraint
imposed by his superiors at Washing
ton.
On Monday and Tuesday some hot
correspondence passed over the cable
between Sampson at the one end and
Secretary Long at the other. The re
sult is not positively known, but he
admiral let it be known among- his sub
ordinates that he had obtained at least
discretionary permission to do some
thing.
Sampson's plan, while not definitely
known, may be outlined with reason
able accuracy. Sam-son will take the
New York, Indiana, Amphltrite and
three of the torpedo boats over to Porto
Rico. There he expects to be joined by
the Massachusetts, Texas and Brook
lyn, and probably the Vesuvius. These
will make a fleet of twelve vessels,
eight of them being batt!e-ships, ar
mored cruisers and double turreted
monitors.

cruel and cowardly destruction of the Maine;
Whereas, The Foresters of America, a patri

earnestly approves and heartily applauds the
course and -conduct of this Government In the
premises; and
Whereas, Many members of our order are

KEY WEST, May 5.â A naval offl

i Rear Admiral Sampson being com

The censorship of dispatches here
I continues very strict. Captain Lyons
jof the gunboat Dolphin, which has
1 been cruising for eleven days along the
I western coast of Cuba, says there is
i great activity on shore throughout that
section, and especially at Bahia Honda,
Groups of Spaniards can be seen work
ing on improvised fortifications of all
kinds. Earthworks have been thrown i
up all along the coast and apparent
preparations against invasion are be
, ing made.
During her cruise the Dolphin held !
up eighteen vessels, all of which were
released except the Spanish fishing
schooner Leolo, which was sent in here
', the other day. The Dolphin had pre- I
viously taken the Leolo, but had re- !
'â  leased her on the captain's promise to !
!go inshore and remain there. Not long I
j afterward the Dolphin again found the '
â  Leolo cruising and apparently signal- !
ing Information to some one on shore, i
The Spaniard was then captured de- :

J he was not signaling.
"LILLY" LANGTRY
LEAVES THE STAGE
Henceforth She Will Devote
Herself to Her Racing
Interests.
Will Launch Out on Such a Scale as
to Throw Many Competitors
Into the Shade.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 5.-A cable to the
Telegraph from London says: "Lilly"
Langtry will never be seen upon the stage
again. This statement Is made on the
basis of her own assertions, re-enforced
by the testimony of her friends. Hence
forth she will devote herself to her racing
interests, and she promises to become one
of the magnates of the English turf. She
has now put herself on record as stating
that she Intends to launch out on a scale
which will put the majority of her com
petitors in the shade. In order to do this
she has evolved an exceedingly ambitious
scheme. It will be remembered that she
has a ranch in Lake County, (Jal., which
is devoted to the breeding of horses. This
same ranch she intends shall in future
act as a feeder to her English stock. Her
present proposition is something to this
effect: She will send English stallions
to her ranch, and these will be mated
with American brood mares. The off
spring, after proper selection on our side
of the water, will be sent to England,
where the fair owner hopes they will win
for her a series of victories. A prelimi
nary experiment on the lines indicated
is through the medium of the stallion
Gold Finch, well known in British turf
circles. The stallion was sent to Ameri
ca not so long since and has already been
mated with half a dozen mares at the
C'aliforninn establishment.
Mrs. Langtry is now making arrange- i
ments to send three other famous stal
lions to America for the same purpose. I
Incidentally, the value of the California !
ranch, together with its stock, is, so I am j
told over a quarter of a million dollars,
which is a guarantee for the quality of
the animals to be found thereon. Mrs.
Langtry, when seen at her superb house,
Regal Lodge, Kentfoni, did not hesitate
to state her plans on the lines indicated. I
She added that she believed that the nual
ity of her ranch-bred stock was mainly
due to the grass of the region in which
they are raised, and she therefore pro
posed to import hay made from this grass
in large quantities.
FRUIT GROWERS
MEET AT ORANGE.
Thirty-fourth Annual Session of the
Pomological Society of South
ern California.
ORANGE, May s.â The thirty-fourth
semi-annual meeting of the Pomologieal
Society of Southern California was called
to order by President Abbott Kinney this
morning. The hall was neatly decorated.
The programme opened by an invocation
by the Rev. S. S. Fisk. The address of
welcome was delivered by Hiram Hamil
ton, during which he called to mind many
notable incidents connected with the his
tory of the society.
President Kinney made a very appro
priate response. The president appointed
the following committees: Resolutionsâ
Hiram Hamilton. S. K. Hemphill, S. Ar
mor; nominationsâ A. D. Bishop, D. Ed
son Smith, James Boyrl, Dr. W. B. Wall
and C. H. A. Goodwin; auditingâ D. Ed
son Smith, C. P. Taft, James Fullerton.
At both morning and afternoon sessions
the cause of puffy oranges was discussed,
but nobody was able to give a remedy or
cause. D. Edson Smith of Santa Ana read
an able paper on waste in the orchard
and how to overcome it. C. P. Taft of
Orange, who has made a specialty of the
loquat, placed on exhibition a display of
this fruit, and read an interesting paper
upon "New Varieties of Fruit." Fred
Raffertf of Santa Ana read an Interesting
paper on "Floriculture."
A. D. Bishop said that It was the duty
of every horticulturist to grow green
manure.

WASHINGTON, May s.â Senator Mor

Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA, May s.â The recently
lected Cuban Deputies assembled yes-
terday for the first time to effect or
ganization. Assembled in the hall in
addition to the members of Congress,
the colonial secretaries, etc., were Ad
miral Manterola, General Losado, the
civil and military anthorities, the
bishop, the foreign consuls and the
commanders and the officers of the
British cruiser Talbot and the French
cruiser Fulton, both of which are in
port. Besides the officers and officials,
there were present many representa
tives of the Spanish nobility, the lead
ing politicians of Havana and the rep
resentatives of the local and some of
the foreign newspapers. There were
also many ladies present.
The Captain-General was received
with the greatest respect as he entered
the hall, which was finely decorated.
j In the center of the hall on a platform
| was a big presidential table, under a
canopy, and right and left of it were
portraits of the little King of Spain
! and his mother, the Queen Regent.
General Blanco took up a position
! behind this table. At his right were
the members of the Colonial Govern
j ment and the Secretary-General of
â  Cuba. On his left stood Generals Par
rado, Pando and Solano. When all
j participants in the ceremony were in
j their places the Captain-General sa
; luted military fashion and read his
I message to Congress. General Blar.co
said in substance:
I take great pleasure in seeing the rep
resentatives of this island united here for
the rirst time. In spite of the fact that
the United States ha 3 tried to impede
the re-establishment of peace, Spain has
fulfilled her promise of introducing re
forms in Cuba, and was approaching a
: reconciliation and the ending of the war.
i But the United States, though speaking
of peace and autonomy, has tried to pre
vent us from bringing them about.
If the declaration of the United States
had been sincere its guns ought to be
saluting to-day the lirat Cuban Parlia
ment, instead of threatening the lives of
its members and proving herself so false
to their policy, ambitions and plans. Spain
has given the island all she is authorized
to do for the purpose of restoring peace,
and without any conditions. Tne autono
mist form of government established is as
ample as that of the British colonies, and
Spain has declared that it will be made
more ample still if such a course is Judged
to be necessary by the members of this
Congress.
Rigid customs and other rules were
abolished in order to heh> the reconcen
trados, the victims of the fight sustained
j by the United States. We admitted free
of duties the "help"' sent from America
sent for the purpose of increasing the ex
isting discords. In short, nothing has
I been left undone which might satisfy the
aspirations of the people, if compatible
with the national honor.
On the petition of his Holiness the Pope
I and the European powers hostilities were
suspended in order to treat for peace,
when, ignoring all this, the President of
the United States declared that the auton
omous form of government had turned
[ out to be a failure, when Parliament had
I not eyen assembled, and the patriots of
the I nlted States were excited by the
declaration that Spaniards caused the
Maine catastrophe, forgetting the gener
ous hospitality her sailors received here.
And now the United States is taking up
arms to impose its domination. Before
such an outrage Spaniards and Cubans
must unite to defend the fatherland, and
the reconcentration will be all the more
sacred in view of the actual circumstances
in the case. The defenders of Spain and
of the autonomy of Cuba all have Span
ish blood in their veins, or were born on
this soil.
All the new laws must be put In force
on July 1. Preference should be given
to the measures providing for public se
curity and the maintenance of the na
tional honor of Spain, the only country
which can protect the development of
this colony and bring about the forma
tion of a great country' united to the
old Castilian nation, and at the sametlme
be the mediator, in the new world, be
tween both continents.
When he had finished reading his
message Captain General Blanco
shouted "Viva Espana," which cheer
was responded to with considerable en
thusiasm. The captain general then
declared the Cuban Congress open and
administered the oath to the Depu
ties. He asked all of them if they
swore to always defend Spain, and was
answered with a spontaneous "yes."
At about 2:?" > m. - third salute of
fifteen guns from the fortress an
nounced the departure of the captain
general froi.i the hall, while a fourth
salute of fifteen guns announced his
return to the palace.
At the palace the captain general
from a balcony witnessed a march past
of the troops.

FOR CUBANS
Success of the Government
Expedition Sent to Meet
Insurgents.
Important Information Received,
but Not Without Encounters
With Patrolling Troops of
Spanish Cavalry.
Copyrighted. IS9B, by James Gordon Bennett.
KEY WEST, Fla., May s.â lmportant
information regarding the Spanish
forces in Cuba was gained by the tug
Leyden's expedition which left here last
Monday. The details of this informa
tion I am not permitted to give, but I
can say that the expedition was suc
cessful in every sense.
Aside from Interviews with leaders
direct from the insurgents' camps a
large quantity of ammunition was
landed near Mariel and safely conveyed
by the insurgents into the interior.
Spanish cavalry made two attacks
while communication between the men
from the Leyden and the insurgent
leaders was in progress, uut the only
damage done was to the paint on the
Leyden's smokestack, which was struck
by bullets from Spanish rifles.
Baldamero Acosta, an insurgent chief,
j and five other Cubans were with the
! expedition. Three of them remained on
I land to gather information, while Gen
| eral Acosta and J. E. Gartaya returned
to Key West.
The tug effected a landing on Tues
day near Mariel, on the north coast of
Cuba, a few miles west of Havana,
where It had been arranged to meet
Colonel Perico Delgado of the insurgent
army and deliver to him dispatches to
' General Mayra Rodriguez, in command
j of the insurgent forces in Pinar del
Rio district.
General Acosta, Antonio Moria Leon,
Marcos Diaz and Alberto Guzman were
put ashore charged with the delivery
of the dispatches. The Leyden then
| steamed east along the coast under
j cover of the blockading fleet to a point
I near Cardenas, where General Donre
| ano Prado ajid Ambrosio Diaz went
' ashore. Everything went according to
I the prearranged plans. The insurgents
! in sufficient numbers to make a stand,
! who were in concealment afforded by
bushes, eluded the Spanish cavalry pa
trolling at some distance from the coast
line and joined the party landed at
Mariel.
When the Leyden returned there un
! der the cover of darkness on Tuesday
i night it was found that General Acosta
and his companions were in consulta
tion with Colonel Delgado, who is in
command of a brigade in that zone,
â â  and who had 100 insurgents with him.
Colonel Delgado went aboard the tug
soon after daylight Wednesday and
i the work of landing the freight and
ammunition on board the latter, con
sisting of 50,000 rounds and two boxes
of dynamite, was contin d. A few
boxes had been safely conveyed to the

alry suddenly galloped into view, shoot
ing wildly and without effect. The in
surgents, hidden behind clumps of
bushes near the beach, returned the
fire. About twenty shots were ex
changed, the Spaniards retreating after
their first volley. This engagement took
place in full view of the tv" which
was anchored not more than 300 yards
away. After the Spaniards had dis
appeared Colonel Delgado. who had
left the tug and returned to shore, sig
naled to the Leyc' Â»n to land the rest of
the ammunition.
The continuation of this work was
deemed imprudent, however, at that
time by the o"^ers of the Leyden. who
feared a re-enforcement of the Spanish
company that had made the attack
just ended, and the Interception of the
insurgents before they could safely get
their boxes into the interior. The in
surgents were left to guard what had
already been landed, and the Leyden
steamed away to the west to meet the
Wilmington, which was blockading in
front of Morro Castle. It was about 8
in the forenoon wh^n the brush be
tween the Spanish cavalry and the in
surgents took place on the beach, and
five hours later when the T,pyden re
turned, followed by the Wilmington,
Colonel Delgado and his men were still
there, having remained concealed in
the bushes.
WTiile the Wilmington remained In
sight, no Spaniard was seen and the
gunboat returned to its station off
Morro Castle. When it was about three
miles away the Leyden resumed the
work of landing the cargo. The ammu
nition had all been conveyed to the
shore, when the Spaniards again ap
peared and began a fusillade with their
rifles, several shots striking the tugs.
Meanwhile the insurgents took to the
bushes and succeeded in escaping, the
tug seeming to be the main object of
the Spanish attack. Her smokestack is
indented and her ventilator perforated.
The Leyden carries only one small gun,
but during the morning some wooden
poles and a flagstaff were mounted on
the deck to resemble a cannon, and it is
believed the sudden flight of the Span
iards after firing one volley in the first
attack was caused by the impression
they received of the warlike qualities
of the Ledden, lying only a few yards
off shore, a mistake which they did not
discover for some hours.
Captain J. H. Dorst, of General Miles'
staff, was on the Leyden. He did not
go ashore, but had a long talk with Col
onel Delgado while the latter was on
board the tug. He brought back infor
mation, which I learn will have a

OFFICERS OF THE SEVENTH REGIMENT.
The G. A. R. and Veteran Reserve
Corps, under command of Captain John
J. G. Cox of this city, one of the most
prominent shipping men on the coast,
has an astounding theory to advance
in regard to the failure of Commodore
Dewey to report the news of his vic
tory over the Spaniards at Manila. It
â will be remembered, Captain Cox says,
that the American fleet arrived in the
harbor at Manila in the darkness. Get
ting past the formidable batteries on
the islands of Meriveles and Caballo,
which stand at the mouth of the har
bor, and the fortresses of Telago and
San Jose points o-n the north side and
Limbones on the south side, without
damage, they encountered no subma
rine mines, for it would be most diffi
cult to lay them there, the channel be
ing about 2400 feet deep and the tide a
very swift one.
After entering the harbor which,
save for about three miles of shoal in
front of the city proper, is free from
menaces, Dewey undoubtedly steame.i
toward the Spanish fleet, which would,
Captain Cox said, either engage the
squadron or run for shelter beneath the
guns in the smaller harbor of Cavite.
To Judge from the reports received
they must have adopted the former
plan with the disastrous results to the
Spanish already chronicled.
There is always a large flotilla of
merchantmen in the harbor and DeWey,
Captain Cox says, after returning from
the first engagement would undoubted
ly shelter behind these from the shells
of the forts while he repaired and re
turned to the attack. He would be
obliged to be ever moving to escape the
fire from any land batteries.
Captain Cox is of the opinion that
Dewey and his fleet will be obliged to
reduce the forts at the mouth of the
harbor ere he can get out, for until the
guns there are silenced they would
make frightful havoc should the fleet
attempt to leave the harbor. This is
the reason the news of the victory has
not reached Honr-kong, Captain Cox
Bays, notwithstanding the fact that
p< rt is but 650 miles away, for none of
th>> vessels are able to get out with the
news. Manila Harbor, Captain Cox
sayp. is very unsafe at this time, as the
munsoon season is about beginning.
Should storms arise now they would
add greatly to the peril of the American
fleet.
Describing the various fortifications,
Captain Cox says Cavite is a well con
structed fortress and nuite imposing in
appearance. It mounts a large number
of guns, but they are not of a very
modern type. Manila <s surrounded by
land batteries, which are intended,
however, more for land use than for
guard from attacks by sfÂ»a, that work
being left to Cavite and the other forts.
Meriveles â or Corregidor, as it is some
times called â the island fort two miles
from the north shore at the mouth of
the harbor, is sixty-two feet high and
mounts ten guns, but. as at. Cavite,
these are not modern. Caballo, a small
island near by with a lighthouse, has
four guns.
The three fortresses on the north
shore are well fortified and carry a
large number of guns. These, as well

as the fort of Limbones Point and the
batteries extending along the south
shore to Cavite, could do much damage
ere silenced. Although Dewey is un
able, in his opinion, to come out at
present. Captain Cox does not think
the Am^rk-ans will meet with disaster,
as they will reduce the forts ere they
attempt to leave.

WAR PLANS OF
THE PRESIDENT
Porto Rico Is to Be the
Next Point of At
tack.
Sampson Will Destroy the
Spanish Fleet if He
Meets It.
Secretary Alger Is Planning Now to
Lay a Cable to the Far
allones.
Bpecial Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, May 5.
It can be positively stated that the
Navy Department Is in complete Ignor
ance of the whereabouts of the Spanish
fleet. Various reports have located
these vessels at Cadiz, the Canaries,
off the Newfoundland coast and in mid
ocean, and it was determined to start
Captain Sampson out to look for them.
As nearly as can be ascertained the
argument made by the naval strategic
board was as follows: If it is true
that the vessels are heading for this
side they must be intercepted before
reaching their base of supplies at Porto
Rico, and therefore a naval engage
ment on the high seas would follow,
but if by the time Sampson reaches
Porto Rico it appears that the Spanish
fleet is yet anchored off the coast of
Spain the batteries of Porto Rico will
be bombarded, and the enemy's only
naval base on this side of the Atlantic
destroyed or occupied by our vessels.
The work of reducing the batteries will
not require all of Captain Sampson's
vessels, and it is believed that he has
orders to dispatch two or more of them
to the south to capture the cruiser and
war transport, Alfonso XIII, now at
Barbadoes.
If Spain's fle^t is now In mldocean,
as currently reported to-day, and head
ing for Porto Rico, a battle royal on
the high seas will be the result; but
if the vessels are yet on the other side
of the Atlantic news will be received
in a few days that Captain Sampson
is bombarding Porto Rican batteries,
so that, in any event, before the week
is out, or at latest, by Sunday or Mon
day, thrilling' news may be expected
from that part of the Atlantic.
Senator Burrows called at the Whit*
House to-day to present some friends
to the President. As he left he said:
"Everything is moving along smoothly
and well. What we want now is Porto
Rico. We ought to have that to-mor
row."
"Will It be as soon as that?"
"Yes," was the reply. "Probably in
a day or two."
While refraining from saying what
took place during his brief interview
with the President, his statement that
the seizure of Porto Rico is expected
to be effected in a day or two was
thought by his hearers to be signifi
cant, having been made immediately
after the Senator left tho President.
In addition to the war signal balloon
recently shipped to Staten Island from
Fort Logan, the department will pur
chase two other balloons to send with
Shafter's men to Cuba, These will be
used at the seized Cuban port. They
will be attached to a windlass and may
be readily elevated or lowered. By
means of strong field glasses a view
of the surrounding co-untry for a dis
tance of fifteen or twenty miles may
be taken, so that our soldiers will be
given early notice of the enemy's ap
proach. General Greely, chief signal
officer of the War Department, has
just completed a fine system of tele
graphic and telephonic communication
for the Atlantic seaboard as far south
as Fort Caswell, in addition to a tele
phone system for the field, so that the
various corps and divisions may com
municate easily with each other. He
will now turn his attention to the Pa
cific, and if, as reported in the dis
patches from San Francisco, a cable
can be laid from that city to the Far
allon Islands, twenty-eight miles from
the Go-lden Gate, for $35,000, this work
may be undertaken without awaiting
a special appropriation of Congress, as
there is a balance available out of the
amount set aside by Secretary Alger
for the signal service.

CHARLESTON IS
IN COMMISSION
AT MARE ISLAND
An Interesting Ceremony at the
Navy Yard in Which Sailors
Are Joined by Civilians.
VALLEJO, May s.â The United f
States cruiser Charleston was placed in
commission this morning at the navy
yard by Captain J. J. Brice, U. S. N.,
who has just, been assigned as captain
of the yard. As soon as the ship was j
turned over to Captain Henry Glass, j
U. S. N., the commander of the ship,
the Independence band, as the flags
were unfurled, played '"Hall Colum
bia" and other patriotic airs. Then
cheer upon cheer was given for the
flag, the Charleston, and lastly for the
commanding officer, Captain Henry
Glass.
The sight was stirring and had never
before been witnessed at Mare Island.
The officers, as well as the entire crew
and many civilians assembled on the
wharf, joined in the loud huzzas.
The band furnished more music, the
flags waved to the breeze, and soon the

MUCH TYPHOID FEVER.
Already Thers Has Been a Startling
Mortality, but the Worst Has
Yet to Come.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, May s.â Frightful
possibilities are ahead of the people of
Sacramento. The horrors of war and
the terrors of famine are no more to
be dreaded than the ravages of a deadly
epidemic and that is exactly what con
fronts the residents of the capital city
to-day.
Already has there been a startling
mortality for the early spring; already
are numerous cases of typhoid fever re
ported, and if steps are not immediately
taken to the end of suspending the
; :it method of disposing of the
prison sewage at Folsom (which is done
by dumping it into the river, the death
rate for the coming summer and fall
will be frightful.
â¢ Typhoid fever," said a prominent
physician to The Call correspondent,
"results from the introduction of a
specific poison into the system and is
due to the development of a specific
bacillus. It is not contagious, and the
poison appears to be communicated
by infection.
Continuing, the physician, who made
a special request not to have his name
mentioned, said: ' A ne water in the
river at high stages is bad enough, but
the thought of people drinking it when
the stream is sluggish and laden with
the filthy offal from the prison ami
other points along the American River
rs the situation a most revolting
one and causes one to shudder at the
contemplation of the awful consequen
ces which are sure to follow. Unless
something is done I predict the great
est death rate Sacramento has ever
known. The low stage of the river will
be the means, the defilement of the
water the cause."
The waters of the American River
jH.ur Into the Sacramento at a point
just beyond the northern limits of the
city, and just above the place where the
city takes its water for domestic pur
poses. That the exact situation might
be ascertained The Call correspondent
made a trip up the river from the
Twelfth-street bridge to the great dam
of the Folsom Electric Light and Power
Company. There is not a single avail
able space along the river banks, from
its mouth to the dam, a distance of
twenty miles, that is not used as a
dumping place for sewage and offal.
Pig pens, barn yards and closets by the
score are drained into the American
River. Dead animals in various stages
of decomposition can be found floating
toward the mouth of the great supply
pipe which furnishes the city of Sacfa
mento with its drinking water. In
numerable ditches from Chinese settle
ments pour their stenchful contents
into it, and at the town of Folsom, not
only does every drop of the village sew
age reach it, but the sewer, already
running full of offensive iiuid, serves a
thickly populated Chinatown as well.
But the prison furnishes the principal
source of the river's defilement. At
this point does the stomach sicken; at
this place is found the principal foun
tain of filth. Thousands of gallons
per minute of prison sewage finds its
way into the river at this point. The
pollution is so evident that for miles

Places Flows Directly to the River.

the water carries the stench of the
prison.
Just below the town of Folsom can
be found several pools of stagnant
water covered over with a green and
moldy scum, emitting odors that are
simply frightful. And yet, notwith
standing this, the school children of
Sacramento are compelled to drink this
water straight from the hydrant with
out the slightest attempt at filtration.
It is a shame, a sin, a crime, and the
people should be aroused to the enorm
ity of it.
Warden Aull has full knowledge of
the awful abuse, for in his last report
to the Governor he wrote:
For some years past the citizens of Sac
ramento City have complained serif" siy
against the emptying of prison sewage
Into the American River. The question
has been brought up many times, but no
attempt haa been made to remedy the
evil. In May last the- State Board of
Health served notice on the prison au
thorities, calling attention to the law and
demanding that some provision be made
to obviate this difficulty. It is clearly
witbia the province of the State Â§oard
of Health to regulate tlu-se matters, and
they having taken official notice of the
matter it becomes necessary to adopt
some other method of disposing of the
prison sewage. This will involve a pump
ing plant and pipe line to carry it out on
the farm, to be deodorized and used as
fertilizer. Before the meeting of the I^eg
islature an estimate will be prepared of
the cost of such a plant. The Legislature
should make the necessary appropriation
to prevent the further pollution of the
American River frmn this soure<\ While
it is true that Sacramento and other cities
are guilty .of the same offense against
the law, there is no excuse for State in
stitutions violating a plain provision of
the statute. They should at least set the
example of complying with the law, even
though cities and towns fail to do so. The
public health cannot be guarded too jeal
ously. It is in a enough to say that dan
ger is remote, as no epidemics have yet
orcurn d directly traceable to tins evil.
Epidemics have occurred in the past and
will again in the future, and it will be
too late to apply the remedy when a
scourge of this kind ia upon us.
Following out the suggestions of the
report Hon. Scott F. Ennis, one of the
Assemblymen from this county, intro
duced at the last session of the Legis
lature a biii which provided:
"That the sum of $15,000 should be
appropriated for the purpose of erect
ing a sewage pumping plant at the
State's Prison at Folsom."
Among the sections of the bill were
the following provisions:
Sec. 2. The State Board of Prison Di
rectors shall, witliin ninety days after the
ige ol this act, have prepared by a
cumpcttnt engineer, plans and specifica
tions for pumping the sewage from the
Folsom State prison into properly con
structed reservoirs, so as to prevent pol
lution of the American River. These plans
and specification? shall be submitted to
the State Board of Health for their ap
proval.
Sec. 3. As soon as the plans and speci
fications provided for by section two of
this act have been approved l>y the State
Board of Health the State Board of Pris
on Director? shall proceed without delay
to the erection of the sewage pumping
plant provided for in this act.
The measure was known as Assem
bly bill No. 132. It passed the As
sembly, but came to grief in the Sen
ate. There is no doubt but that an
other appeal will be made to the next
Legislature, but the question arises:
What are the people of Sacramento go
ing to do in the meantime?
The coming summer promises the
lowest river water mark ever reached.
With no current to carry these deadly
deposits away, they will accumulate in
enormous quantities in the bed of the
river, and when the first freshets of
fall come the entire amount so accum
ulated will be carried down the river
at one time, and the results will be

fearful to contemplate. The peo
ple of Folsom are thoroughly alarmed
over the present outlook, and many are
preparing to leave for the summer, be
fore the epidemic, which is sure to
come, arrives.
The State Board of Health will no
doubt be called upon to take some steps
toward bettering the situation, and the
local authorities will, in all probabil
ity, be asked to co-operate to the sams
end. In the meantime the peo
ple of Sacramento will be living in
peril. The doctors of the city have ad
vised no one to drink water that is not
boiled and many are taking that pre
caution, but for the poor, who cannot
afford to buy ice to cool the water after
boiling, it is a very difficult practice
to pursue. Typhoid fever is a most
dreaded disease, however, and once the
people are aroused to the necessity of
complying with these sanitary meas
ures, discomforture and trouble will
not be taken into consideration.

SAN JOSE, May s.â The fight over
the $300,000 left by the late George H.
Parker began in earnest this morning.
A jury was secured yesterday after
noon, and when court convened this
morning Attorney Nicholas Bowden
made the opening statement for the
contestant.
Mrs. Emma L. Parker, the contest
ant, was the first witness. She testi
fied she married Edward L. Parker,
the testator's only son, in Hartford,
Conn., in 1573, and they had lived to
gether until her husband's death in
1593. Edward Parker was conducting
a shoe store in Hartford at that time.
She said they lived "together happily
until Jane Pomeroy, sister of George
H. Parker, took a dislike to her. Mrs.
Pomeroy then set her machinations to
work to separate witness and her hus
band. Mrs. Parker accused Mrs. Porn
eroy of writing to her father-in-law
and giving her (the witness) a bad rep
utation. She saiu Mrs. Pomeroy told
her if she did not leave Edward Par
ker she would make things uncomfort
able for her and that they would nevei
receive a cent from his father.
Witness also said undue influence
had been exercised over George H. Par
ker in the making of his will.
There were frequent interruptions by
objections from various attorneys. Mrs.
Parker had not finished her testimony
at adjournment.
The number of churches in Chicago has
grown from 157 in 1870 to 633.

NEW YORK, May 5.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Immedi
ate action by Congress on the resolu-
I tion for the annexation of the Hawaiian
Islands is most earnestly desired by the
administration. Chairman Hitt of the
House Committee on Foreign Affairs
called a special meeting of the commit
tee to-day to consider the annexation
resolution introduced in the House by
Representative Newlands. The matter
was discussed in all its details, and it
was found that the resolution would
have an overwhelming majority in the
committee â twelve of the members be
ing in favor of it and only three
against it.
Final action was not taken at :\: \ to
day's meeting, however, for the reason
that it was thought that Commodore
Dewey's report of the situation at Ma
nila might render some change in the
form of the resolution desirable. Chair
man Hitt save notice that another
meeting of the committee would be
held on Tuesday next. Final action
on the resolution will then be taken,
and it will be reported to the House.
The present programme is to have it
taken up in the House and passed not
later than Thursday.
Strong arguments in favor of imme
diate action were advanced in the com
mittee this morning. It was contend
ed that the possession of the islands
was absolutely essential for war pur
poses at this time, and that whether
Congress acted or not, we might be
compelled to use Honolulu as a base
of supplies. The necessity of imme
diately reinforcing Commodore Dewey
and of sending: him enough troops to
enable him to hold the Philippine Isl
ands and maintain order among the
Spaniards and the natives was re
ferred to.
It was pointed out that his report
would probably Indicate the necessity
of immediately dispatching an /expedi

BUNKOED BY A
SHREWD RASCAL
Expressman Burkhart of San Rafael
Has a Sad Experience With a
Confidence Man.
SAN RAFAEL, May s.â One of the
cleverest bunko games ever played la now
a matter of ancient history, and J. A.
Burkhart, the expressman, is left to
mourn. A man who grave his name as
T. J. Davis is the sharper on whose trail
Constable Traynor is now camping. Yes
terday Davis came to W. J. Miller, the
real estate agent, and said he wished to
rent a house and bring his family here
from Larkspur. Miller made arrange
ments to secure one of Attorney M. F.
Cochrane's cottages for Davis, who went
to Burkhart and asked him to go to Lark
spur at 4:30 a. m. to-day and bring his
belongings here. Burkhart did so and de
parted'without any breakfast, after lend
ing Davis $5 on his representation that
$20 would be paid for the express work,
Davis explaining: that his wife had all
his money. When Burkhart reached
Larkspur he sought everywhere for Mrs
Davis to give her a note from her hus
band, explaining that Burkhart must be
given his breakfast and $20. The note
was signed "Father." Mrs. Davis proved
to be a will-o'-the-wisp, and the express
man returned to San Rafael a madder
if not a wiser man. His bewilderment
and anger increased on reacu-ng home to
learn that Davis had gone to-Mrs. Burk
hart and secured $5 on an order from her
husband, evidently written in his sleep.
Davis was not to be found, and a war
rant was sworn out for his arrest and
placed in the hands of Constable Tray
nor, who is now searching for the wily
thief. Davis is a tall, heavy fellow, and
is said to have operated pretty thorough
ly throughout the State. He is supposed
to be now in San Francisco.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, May s.â Mrs. Minnie
Lakln was arrested by Constable C.
Shepard to-day on a warrant sworn to
before Justice Rodden by Mrs. M. Gil
leran, charging her (IVfrs. Lakln) wlch
assault and battery. On the face
of It the affair would present
merely the aspect of an ordinary neigh
bor's quarrel, but when the facts lead-
Ing up to the arrest are investigated,
taking the evidence of the witnesses in
the case for the truth, there is revealed
a case of alleged fiendish cruelty by Che
woman to be arrested that is enough
to make one shudder â a case in which
a half-witted brother was starved,
beaten and kept closely confined in a
cellar for several years, on the alleged
ground that avaricious hands itched for
a sum of money comins: to him.
The unfortunate wretch is Thomas
â  Jamison, a brother of the workman
; who was killed by falling from the
partly completed Hall of Justice build
ing in San Francisco some time ago.
Mrs. Minnie Lakin is the man's sister
and is "taking care" of him for a cer
tain monthly sum. " seems that the
woman who caused the arrest, Mrs.
Gilleran, knew too much and talked too
little, the result of being an assault
upon her by Mrs. Lakin, and the is
suance of the warrant.
Mrs. Gilleran's story, which she as
serts will be told on the witness stand,
I and which witnesses will be compelled
Ito corroborate under oath, is as foi
i lows:
"For a number of years I lived on
Petaluma avenue, near Third street,
and next door to Mrs. Lakin. with
j whom I came to be very c hummy. The
brother under her charge, Thomas,
j was left about $25,000 a good while ago
'by an uncle. Mrs. Lakin received a
( like sum, and the other brother,
Jo h, who was killed, the same,
i Mrs. Lakin's treatment of this
half-witted brother, whose money
she has charge or, was some
thing frightful. He was kept locked in
a cellar under the house and nobody
ever saw him. I saw him twice in
these years and he was unkempt, un
shaven and hollow-cheeked. Moreover,
he was kept nearly starved. On one
occasion I saw him in the back yard,
as he managed to get out of his cellar
in fÂ»me way, and he was eating
chicken-feed in a pan in the back yard.
His appearance was pitiable.
"Mrs. Lakin used to beat him se
verely. One night I was awakened by
hearing shrill howls of anguish, and,
throwing up my window, heard the
sound of heavy blows in the cellar op
posite. Between yells I heard Tom
brokenly plead, 'Oh, Minnie, do quit;
I won't do it again.' Th^ next d.n y T
told Mrs. Lakin 1 was going to see the
authorities and have the brutal trtcti
raent stopped. She talked to me for
a while and I told her she wanted the
poor fellow out of the way to get his
money. She said if H would keep still
and let her give him poison she would
see that I got money enough to make
me comfortable.
"A few days ago I went and told a
man the whole story. He made me
promise to keep still for two days
while he investigated the charges, but
in trying to learn things from the
neighbors he must have put the La
kins on their guard, for Mr. Lakin
was waiting for me as I went to work
in the. French laundry, on B street
early yesterday morning, and, showing
me a pistol, said he would blow my
brains out if I didn't keep quiet. To
day he came up here and abused me
before the other employes. I consulted
with my friends, and as Mrs. Lakin
had beaten me in my house on April 28
for talking I was afraid they would do
worse, and I have had her arrested.
"As God is my witness, this is true,
I and I will tell it all under oath."
The neighbors of Mrs. Lakin are
afraid to talk fur various reasons, but
enough can be learned to corroborate
Mrs. Oilleran's story in many particu
lars. Thomas Steward and his wife
lived by the Lakins for ten months.
I Mrs. Steward said:
"Durii~- all this time I never saw
this half-witted brother ttut once, and
then they had him bringing in a load
of lumber from the sidewalk â a load
so heav- he tottered under it. Rumors
of ill treatment have been current for
a 'nng time, and the man should have
been placed in an asylum."
Mr. Steward said he never saw the
poor brother in the whole ten months.
He understood the family had promise!
to take him out for exercise every
day.
Mrs. Agnew, who now lives near the
Lakin house, says he is never taken out
for exercise and was not even allowed
to take exercise in the back yard till
recently. Mrs. William Crane states
that on one occasion the man ran away,
hut when he got a few blocks from the
house he appeared to become dazed and
halted long- enough to be brought back
by the Lakins. At this time a beard
of about four months' growth covered
his face.
Mrs. Honeywell, another neighbor,
admitted the story of inhuman cruelty
had been in circulation for a long time,
but nobody seemed to care to take the
Initiative to stop it. One neighbor, Mrs.
Ring:, denied there was any truth in
the tale, but stultified herself by deny
ing that such a story was in circula
tion, which none of the neighbors cared
to deny. She is known to be an inti
mate friend of the accused.
It is needless to say the Lakins deny
the story in toto, but when the
case comes into court some sensational
evidence may be adduced.

CHRISTIANS AT
SAN RAFAEL
Forty - Fifth Quarterly
Convention of the En-
deavorers.
Delegations From the Golden
Gate Union Invade the
Marin Metropolis.
Interesting Services Held and Reports
Made at the Session of the Pres
byterian Cnurch.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, May s.â This city was
captured to-night by the Christian En
deavor army, 600 strong. An alarm
was sounded at 7:30 p. m., when the
train rolled into the broad gauge depot,
and soon the streets were crowded with
people eager to witness the invasion.
Singing gospel hymns, the delegations
from the various Sau Francisco
churches belonging to Golden Gate
Union marched four abreast in compa
nies to the new Presbyterian church at
E and Fifth streets. They were es
corted by the reception committee from
the local Congregational and Presby
terian churches, composed of Dr. Van
derlip, C. Mockler, A. Todd, Edward
Davenport, Henry Harrison and Miss
Clifford. The occasion was the forty
fifth quarterly convention of the Gold
en Gate Union of the Society of Chris
tian Endeavor.
Under the direction of the decoration
committee the church had been taste
fuliy decorated with Sowers, while
banners were placed in conspicuous po
sitions. The decoration committee was
composed of the following: Miss I.
Shaver, Miss M. Dollar, J. Elliott, A,
Taber, Stanley Dollar, Miss McKenzie,
E. Boyen and O. Jacobs.
Rev. Dr. Robert Mackenzie delivered
the address in his usual masterly style,
treating of the purposes of the Chris
tian Endeavor societies generally and
of the Golden Gate Union in particular.
Rev. "W. B. Noble gave a Scripture
reading and offered prayer, and Presi
dent J. S. Allen spoke eloquently on the
work accomplished by the union.
Reports were handed in by Miss J.
K. Partridge, recording secretary; Miss
H. L. Reynolds, corresponding secre
tary; W. Clark, treasurer, and by the
chairmen of all the standing commit
tees. They showed the union to be in
a flourishing condition financially and
to have accomplished much work un
der the banner of the peasant of Pales
tine for the last quarter. The praise
service was of an unusually fine order
and was led by J. J. Morris. Messrs.
Dufflcy and Vanderlip in addition sang
an offertory.
After the regular convention business
was closed and the president had made
the concluding remarks aji adjourn
ment was taken for the regular social
hour. /
All the delega*^ Â»n Joyed themselves
heartily. They departed for San Fran
cisco at a late hour by special train.
TO TAX SOME
CORPORATIONS
Democratic Amendment
to the 'War Revenue
Bill.
Call Office, Rlggs House,
Washington, May 5.
There Is little doubt from Senator
Wolcott's expressions in the Senate
I Finance Committee yesterday and the
fact that he did not sit with the Re
publican members to-day that he will
vote to eliminate the bond provision,
but it is understood he is not quite so
clear as to the support of a substi
tute.
The Republican members are dis
turbed over the discovery of his posi
tion and are considering how to best
repair the breach occasioned by his
probable deflection. They were not so
greatly surprised at Jones' position,
although they had hoped to be able
to secure his support of the measure
practically as it passed the House.
The proposition on which Senator
Woleott and Senator Jones of Nevada
voted with the Democrats in the Com
mittee on Finance yesterday was a dec
laration to the effect that the bill
should provide more than $100,000,000 in
revenue.
On this the two Western Senators
aligned themselves with the Democrats
and in opposition to the Republicans.
The delaration was construed by the
Republican members as in opposition
to the bond provision. 5
The Democratic members of the
Finance Committee held a conference
late this afternoon and agreed upon an
amendment they will offer to the bill,
imposing a tax of 1 per cent on the
revenues of certain corporations, in
cluding railroad, express, sleeping car,
telegraph and telephone j companies.
This probably is the only addition they
will suggest to the revenue portion of j
the bill, but it is probable that they
will also urge the coinage of j the sil- j
ver seigniorage in the treasury and the [
issuance of at least $150,000,000 in green- ;
backs. The seigniorage amounts to i
about $42,000,000, and the intention is !
to authorize the issuance of certificates |
for it, so as to secure immediate money '
and not wait upon the coinage of th*
silver. These certificates, with the
greenbacks, would give $192,000,000 of j
immediate cash, and the Democrats
think this would be sufficient for the
immediate wants of the Government. !
They believe that the tax they pro- j
pose on corporations would increase I
the regular revenues to the extent of
about $50,000,000 annually.

MYSTERY NOT
YET CLEARED
Cause of the Santa Cruz
Powder Explosion
Unknown.
So the Coroner's Jury Declares
in Its Verdict on the Re
mains of the Victims.
Three of the Mangled Bodies M*y
Continue to Be Classed as Those
of Spies.
Special Dispatch to The CalL " 1
SANTA CRUZ, May s.â This after
| noon the Coroner's jury rendered the
â  following verdict in the powder explo
| sion case: "Cause of the explosion un
| known. Number of lives lost twelve.
; Bodies of Ed Gillersr and Guy Fagen
j identified. Bodies accounted for but un-
I identified eight. Unaccounted for bodies
[ three. We further find that no blame
j can be attached to the managers of the
i California Powder Works for the ex
j plosion, and absolutely have no reason
. to believe the same was caused by de
! sign."
The verdict still leaves the mystery
surrounding three bodies as deep as
ever. At the inquest to-day George
Hannah and W. Huntington Jr. testi
fied to seeing Edward S. Holway, prin
cipal of the Soquel public school, and
his brother at the works three-quartera
of an hour before the explosion.
W. C. Peyton, the assistant superin
tendent, who was in San Francisco,
could give no reason for the explosion.
He said that fire had been known to
break out in gun-cotton. He was at a
loss to explain the detonation, for
smokeless powder burns in layers,
which communicates with other sub
stances. One explosion was from two
cans of nitro-glycerine which were
found out of one of the mills when the
fire reached it. The first explosion was
in a small dryer. Ten thousand pounds
of gun-cotton and twelve thousand
pounds of finished smokeless powder
and two smokeless mills were burned
without an explosion.
Peyton gave it as his opinion that
but ten men were killed as no one had
as yet reported any persons missing.
He thought the remains of one body
might be counted as two bodies.
Coroner Clark introduced fragments
of the thirteenth and gave an ana
tomical lecture on them. He believes
thirteen lives were lost.
Peyton said that the floors of the
mills were cleaned several times a day,
so that no danger from a contact of
metallic substance with dust on tha
floor might result.
No more boys will be employed at the
works for the present. There are fifty
there now, and it is considered they
are better than men for certain lines
of work. As a result of the recent ex
plosion it is doubtful if the dryers will
be rebuilt, as gun-cotton is to be dried
by a new process. The powder com
pany was always opposed to dryers,
but as the Department of Ordnance in
sisted that the drying should be done
in a certain way the company had to
follow instructions. The drying will be
done through a mixture of water and
alcohol, which will greatly lessen the
danger.

A TRAVELING MAN.
Gives Some Valuable Hints Regard*
ing the Care of the Health.
While Traveling.
Mr. R. W. Wincherdon, a commer-
| cial traveler from Birmingham, whosa
business keeps him almost constantly
lon the road.- relates in the Sunday
: News the dangers to health resulting
i from constant change of residence and
the way he overcame the usual injuri-
ous effects.
He says: One thing people traveling
cannot very well avoid is the constant
change in water and food; the stomach
; never has an opportunity to becoma
i accustomed to anything and in a few
years or much sooner the average trav-
eling man becomes a hopeless dyspeptic.
For several years I suffered more or
less from indigestion, sour stomachs,
headaches, distaste for food, often no
! appetite, gas on the stomach and the
j usual unpleasant effects of imperfect
j digestion.
Nearly every traveling man has his
j favorite remedy for different troubles)
1 and I tried all of them with indifferent
f results. Finally on the train between
' Pittsburg and Philadelphia one day, I
! overheard a conversation between two
I ladies, one of whom had suffered seâ
i verely from indieestion and stated she
, had been completely cured by a remedy
i which she called Stuart's Dyspepsia
! Tablets; I remembered the conversa-;
j tion because it directly Interested me.
and at the next town I Inquired at tha .
first drug store und bought a package
for 50 cents, and from that day to this
I have never been without them. They
are pleasant tasting tablets, not a se-
cret patent medicine, but composed of
vegetable essences, pure pepsin, fruit
salts and Golden Seal; being in tablet
form they never lose their good quali-
ties like a liquid medicine would, but
are always fresh and ready for use.
I carry a box in my pocket continu-
ally, and whenever I see any symp-
toms of indigestion I take one, also one
after each meal, and for a year and a
half I have not lost a day by reason of.
poor health and can eat anything and
relish what I eat; my digestion Is ab-
solutely perfect as far as I can judge
from my feelings, and although there
may be other stomach rr.edicines Just
as good as Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
I do not know what they are. Certainly
for people who travel they are far
ahead of any liquid medicine, as they
are so convenient, they can be carried
in the pocket and used whenever
needed.
I believe they are sold by.all drug-
gists at 50 cents, and believe any one
who will try them will agree with me,
that for indigestion and stomach
trouble Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are
unequaled.

IS HE A LORD MAYOR?
DR. J. H. STALLARD, M. 8., Lond., in a
recent communication to The Call, declared
that the Mayor of the proposed new charter
will be a "veritable Czar." The doctor apparently
repudiates the notion that this official is properly de
scribed when the term "Lord Mayor" is applied to
him. He says the Lord Mayors of Birmingham,
Dublin and Belfast are serfs compared to him â mere
creatures of the government without special author
ity to influence legislation or control finance. On
the other hand, the proposed Mayor of San Fran
cisco is an uncrowned king. Dr. Stallard says:
"He is authorized to initiate new policies and to
veto legislation, to cut down appropriations, to re
fuse the ratification of contracts, to reject items of
account, and besides his legislative functions he will
have discretionary power to appoint and remove the
officials who constitute the real government. More
over, he is authorized to suspend the very elected of
the people. He appoints and will control the elec
tion officers and is practically responsible for an
honest counting of the votes. He and his ministers
will have charge of all the city property, parks,
schools and public buildings. They will control 83
per cent of the entire expenditures of the city govern
ment. Of this two millions and a half will have the
form of patronage with a certain future increase, es
pecially in the Department of Public Works. He is
also given power to influence appointments in the
lower ranks. The Commissioners of Civil Service
are servants either for good or evil."
Is or is not this in accordance with the facts? We
have already called attention to the subject without
eliciting a reply from any of the ex-Freeholders or
other friends of the proposed charter. Is it under
stood that nothing is going to be said concerning the
powers of the extraordinary official described by Dr.
Stallard? Is it assumed that a "Czar" is the kind of
Mayor we need, and that there is no occasion to dis
cuss the question whether or not it is a good idea to
set up such a political despot in our midst?
We think the ex-Freeholders are in duty bound to
point out to the people the precedents upon which
they have relied in the creation of this Mayor.
Whence have they taken his model? Let us know
all the fact 3 before the vote is had. We assume that
the ex-Freeholders are interested in the future of the
city and that they are as loath as anybody to estab
lish in it a political monarchy. Why, then, do they
not come forward and refute Dr. Stallard's asser
tions? It has now been over a week since his com
munication was published.
NEED FOR A FARfILLON CfIBLE.
THE necessity for cable connection with the
Farallon Islands will impress many now who in
time of peace would not have given the sub
ject a thought. If there is the slightest danger of
a hostile vessel's approaching this coast the fact
that its coming could be detected from the
islands long before it could from the lookout points
about Golden Gate is too important to be ignored.
But there are other reasons for having a cable.
There is much difficulty in forecasting the weather
here. Of what air currents may be on the way from
the west over the Pacific the signal officer knows
nothing. He is handicapped oy a chronic lack of data.
In a measure his forecast must be a guess. The moun
tains of fog which drift in also serve to make his
task more uncertain. With a cable to the Farallones
the State would be benefited by more complete and
accurate prognostications. This would be a distinct
gain to farming, shipping and general commercial in
terests. The islands are far enough away to be out
side the fog belt, and fairly subject to such climatic
conditions as would afford the signal service a basis
from which to work.
It is to be hoped the present plan for securing the
cable will not lag. Compared to the advantages to
be reaped, the cost is too trifling a matter to be con
sidered. The plan is one appealing particularly to
the organizations having for their purpose the bet
terment of trade. An appeal from the Chamber of
Commerce would have great weight with the author
ities at Washington. To formulate such an appeal
without delay would be a wise measure. And as there
is always some delay owing to necessary official for
malities even after a decision has been reached, the
desirability of prompt action on the part of San Fran
cisco is apparent.
There is little reason for terming Weyler a "Span
ish Boulanger." He does not even possess the
proper brand of whiskers.
It is a melancholy coincidence that of the two Gov
ernors, one burned in effigy and the other hanged,
fcoth arc Populists.
THE EXPLANATORY MAGUIRE.
JUDGE MAGUIRE is a member of Congress.
It is true that he is a candidate for the governor
ship also, and in this dual character, holding on
to one office and reaching for another, he affects to
believe that critisism of him as a member of Con
gress is caused by his candidacy for the governor
ship. He attributes all such criticism to "the rail
road" and presents himself as a martyr to the oc
topus.
Now, we are not concerned about Maguire's can
didacy for the governorship, and we will admit that
as an anti-railroad person he is fully up to the stan
dard of his daily organ, the Examiner. What does
concern us is his expression and conduct as a mem
ber of Congress from California and a citizen of the
United States.
After the Spanish Minister demanded his passports
and left the country under instructions from his Gov
ernment, and after the American Minister at Madrid
had been handed his and he had been hooted and
stoned across the Spanish frontier, our navy, with
Key West as a base, seized as prizes Spanish mer
chant ships, some of them on their way to Havana
and others bound to other ports.
In an idle moment Judge Maguire said that taking
these prizes was piracy, and therefore our naval offi
cers became pirates, though they may have been pre
venting the victualing and arming of Havana.
It was easy for the Judge to say this, but hard for
him to see it in print When he said it his weekly
organ here, the Star, which is the ever faithful mir
ror that reflects him jn all his phases, said: "Repre
sentative Maguire regards the seizure of the Buena
Ventura and some five or six other Spanish vessels
prior to the declaration of war on April 25 as an act
of piracy, as to which he is probably correct."
Maguire's readiness to criticize his own Govern
ment, even to the extent of classing our naval offi
cers with pirates, met ready and approving response,
therefore, from his leading supporter here. The only
interest in his opinion arises from the fact that he is
a member of Congress, and as such voted for the
most, extreme war propositions, including recognition
of the Cuban insurgent government and validation
of its bonds and blanket mortgage on the island.
Under such circumstances his denunciation of prize
taking as piracy was sure to attract attention, and
when it did he forwarded to his daily organ, the
Examiner, what he intended as a denial of the ex
pression which his weekly organ had indorsed.
It being charged that he said the seizure of Span
ish merchantmen prior to April 25 was piracy, he re
plies in the Examiner to this effect:
"My attention has been called to an alleged state
ment by me concerning the seizure of the Spanish
merchant ship Buena Ventura by our navy as fol
lows: '/ consider this act and the other seizures up
to this time nothing more than piracy.'' 1
Observe now that "up to this time" was up to
April 25. The explanation continues:
"I made no speech on the subject at all, and I
mide no such statement, either publicly or privately,
and entertained no such opinion. I passed no criti
cism whatever upon the action of the naval authori
ties or the administration in seizing and detaining
Spanish merchant ships."
That is a positive denial. He says: "I made no
such statement and entertained no such opinion."
Then follows his own version of what he did say and
of the opinion he did entertain:
"Believing that as our Government is not bound
by international law, except in so far as it chooses to
observe it, and the retroactive clause in the act in
question would put our Government in the position
of passing a law for the purpose of confiscating ships
and their cargoes, I said that such an act would
lower the moral plane of humanity and liberty on
which we were conducting the war and would place
our country before the world in the position of
seizing and confiscating a few merchant ships under
conditions condemned by the treaty of Paris as no
better than piracy."
We submit that the most rabid "railroad" paper
in California could not place him in any worse po
sition than he puts himself in.
He was accused of saying that the seizures were
"nothing more than piracy" ; he denies saying "arty
such thing"" and admits that he said they were "ho
better than piracy." It is hardly the difference be
tween "How are you, Gallagher?" and "Gallagher,
how are you?"
Judge Maguire is either ignorant of the force of
language or thinks others are or he would not play
such an obvious fluke. Let it be put so plainly that
the most obtuse can see it â he denies saying the
seizures were "nothing more than" piracy, and ad
mits saying that they were "no better than" piracy.
In the denied form our naval officers would be
"nothing more than" pirates; in the admitted form
they would be "no better than" pirates.
These are Red Cross days, and perhaps in a spirit
of mercy we should leave Judge Maguire to the
oblivion into which he has talked himself. But may
we not suggest that he is not always aware of the
force and meaning of terms?
In his speech at the Henry George memorial serv
ices in this city last year he said: "Great problems
affecting mankind had remained unsolved before the
coming of Henry George. Before his day professors,
philosophers and publicists had proposed to cut the
Gordian knot with pools of blood."
The habit of expression which can cut things with
pools of blood, and probably whet them first on a
bar of soft soap, is all that can be pleaded for his
latest performance. It is important merely as the
unconscious betrayal of a mood of mind inimical to
the purposes of his country.
Three police officers are to explain to the commis
sion the particulars of a disgraceful fight in which
they were recently engaged. This calls to mind the
fact that four police officers have yet to explain a
disgraceful flight in which they were recently en
gaged. Chief Lees may have forgotten the incident,
but the public has not.
Chaska, the Indian gentleman who has just com
mitted suicide, would have saved himself much
trouble if he had performed this thoughtful act be
fore he married Cora Belle Fellows. His sorrows
began right then.
The Eclair says that commercial Europe could not
tolerate the capture of Las Palmas. Perhaps this is
a serious matter, but there is no general understand
ing that commercial Europe has been asked to toler
ate anything.
It is to be hoped that the tendency of spies to get
aboard our warships will be discouraged. At least
their treatment should be such as to make them rate
as very poor insurance risks.
General Blanco is rash to be wearing his most
gaudy uniform just now. When a Folsom convict is
forced to put on a scarlet shirt it is so be can be
utilized as a target.
THE SAX FRAKCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAT 6, 1898.
RACE TROCK GAMBLING.
ACCORDING to the evidence so far adduced
the scandal in the County Clerk's office ap
pears to be an insignificant affair. None of the
public money has been stolen. It is alleged that one
of the clerks has sold his warrant for a single month
to four different brokers, thus defrauding three of
them. The suit brought by Mayor Phelan by which
the salaries of the Deputy County Clerks were
stopped enabled him to do this. He took advantage
of the situation to defraud the warrant shavers â a
class of financiers who are the constant prey of the
tax eaters.
Probably the public, seeing that it loses nothing,
will not take much interest in the scandal. But the
moral which it points should receive more attention
than is likely to be given to it. Deputy County Clerk
Piper hypothecated his salary warrant four times in
order to procure money with which to "play the
races." Had there been no races to fire his ambition
to get rich by gambling he would never have de
frauded the warrant brokers. Internal Revenue Col
lector Welburn and his deputy, Norton, embezzled
the funds placed in their hands for the same reason.
They wanted money to bet on the races.
Theodore Figel was also animated by a desire to
acquire wealth by the easy and exciting process of
putting it on the right horse. Behind the scrape
from which he extricated himself only after a des
perate struggle in the courts there stalked the specter
of a horse race. Much of the money embezzled by
Treasurer Widber went the same way. He used the
accumulations of the taxpayers to buy fast horses,
and had he been let alone a while longer no doubt
the city would have finally found itself the owner of
a promising stable. It might ultimately have suc
ceeded Widber as manager of the "string," and, with
Mayor Phelan as manipulator, have gone regularly
into the business of "promoting" the development
of thoroughbreds. The Mayor, being a "hefter,"
would make an ideal handicapper.
The question which seems to us to be uppermost
at the present time is, Have not the people of San
Francisco had a sufficiency of race track gambling?
The number of fools who think they can get rich at
it seems to be limitless. Pools are sold to them out
side the race track without hindrance. There ap
pears to be no way of protecting them other than
the suppression of horse racing, except for brief pe
riods at agricultural fairs or under the auspices of
private individuals. The incorporation of race track
gambling and its prosecution as a business bids fair
to make out of the young men of the city a com
munity of gamblers, embezzlers and defaulters. Is
it not about time that a stop were put to it?
TOURISTS COMING WEST.
LETTERS received by the manager of the State
Board of Trade from Eastern correspondents
asking information concerning the various sum
mer resorts of California are reported to be suffi
ciently numerous to justify the conclusion that a much
larger number of tourists will visit the State this sea
son than ever before. It promises to be, in fact, a
boom year for the tourist hotels and for all places in
the State having attractions for holiday visitors.
The cause of the increased interest in California
on the part of the Easterners is of course due to the
war. A large proportion of the Eastern pleasure
seekers who generally go to Europe during the sum
mer will prefer this year to come West and see some
thing of their own country rather than take the risk
of such dangers or inconveniences at least as the men
ace of war imposes on all Americans who cross the
ocean. This conclusion drawn from the conditions
of the situation is confirmed by letters from many of
the correspondents, who frankly state that the in
tention to take their holiday in the West this year is
due to a fear of the existing war and the possibility
of its spreading.
If the increase in the tourist travel to the State is
anything as large as is expected from the present out
look it may be-classed among the benefits the nation
will gain from the war. The annual exodus of Amer
ican pleasure-seekers to Europe is an evil of no slight
magnitude. It not only carries abroad vast sums of
money, but it leads an increasing number of Ameri
cans to look to Europe for the gratification of their
intellectual and esthetic tastes rather than to their
own country, and in that way, while building up for
eign pleasure resorts and promoting foreign art and
manufactures of articles of luxury, it diminishes to
a corresponding extent the growth and development
of our own.
Tourist travel is mainly a matter of fashion. The
great mass of pleasure-seekers follow a route that has
been marked out for them by those who have gone
before. The tourist track has been almost literally
established across Europe like a highway, and the
traveler can as readily distinguish when he is in it or
out of it as one can determine in any particular lo
cality whether he is on the main thoroughfare or a
byway.
This being so, the importance of once turning
American tourist travel Westward can be readily seen.
Descriptions of the wonders and the climatic charms
of California given by Eastern tourists to their friends
on their return home will incline many of those
friends to come West themselves next year. Thus the
gain from the increased travel caused by the war
may prove to be a permanent benefit to the country
in many ways. If the money now expended by Amer
icans every summer in Europe for pleasure and for
art should be in any considerable measure expended
on the Pacific Coast our advance in the production of
means for all forms of esthetic enjoyment would be
rapid, and with that would come also an advance in
wealth and general prosperity.
While awaiting news from Dewey some of the yel
low journalshave beenpublishingaccountsof the fear
ful slaughter of the men aboard his ships. There could
be no excuse for this act of cruelty. If a correspon
dent must lie, let him lie cheeringly. It is just as
easy, and probably the truth will be somber enough.
Still the Railroad Commissioners have not asked
Mr. Huntington about the money his company has
paid to the Examiner. Aside from the duty of fur
nishing the public with information to which it has a
right, the witness might remember that the Examiner
is not exerting itself to protect him.
There seems to be a disposition to regard the ac
tion of a public official in hypothecating his salary
warrant to four different brokers as a private mat
ter concerning him and them. If this is true the
Grand Jury ought to be abolished as a piece of un
warrantable impertinence.
If coast troops are to be sent to Manila the Red
Cross people will find the additional necessity of fit
ting out a sanitary ship among their duties.
Weyler is a traitor, and that his own country does
not execute him shows that "laxness of discipline"
prevails to a certain extent in Spain.

Do you know that our splendid bat
tle-ship Oregon recently passed through
a very novel experience? Of course
you don't unless you have seen a let
ter that one of the officers recently sent
to his son. The letter was written
since the vessel left this port a few
weeks ago on her way to join the At
lantic squadron, and has just been de-
livered. Of course the information in
the letter has not yet been given to the
I Government officers, but it will be in a

â  big battle-ship was actually held up at
j sea by Neptune and his wife, Amphi
â  trite. His jolly followers attended on
aboard and after securing the captain
compelled the crew to do their bid

Everybody has heard of the White
head torpedo and knows that it is one
of the most terrible engines of destruc
tion ever invented. But everybody
doesn't know how it was invented, how
it is made, how it is launched from the
torpedo-boat and how it is steered
through the water until it strikes the
object that it is destined to destroy.
IN NEXT SUNDAY'S CALL,
There will be a full description of this
terrible piece of mechanism.
Since the battle of Manila Bay has
become a matter of history it is only
natural that great interest should be
taken in the engagements of ironclads.
The Manila fight is the third one in
history. The first was the battle of
Lissa, some thirty years ago, and the
second the battle of the ialu. This
fight taught naval experts more than
they had ever learned before. It solved
a good many puzzles and also pro
pounded a good many. But it was a
THE THANKS OF CONGRESS.
The gallant action of Commodore George Dewey with the Spanish fleet and
shore batteries at Manila has prompted Representative Grosvenor of Ohio to
introduce a resolution in Congress for a vote of thanks to the brave commander
in-chief. A vote of thanks by Congress is the highest honor that can be be
stowed upon an American citizen. Besides its intrinsic value it carries, also,
advancement in rank to the navy or army officer, increased pay and a right to
remain upon the active list if he chooses until his life closes.
In the recognition of distinguished services Congress has always been very
chary, hence the honor is Justly looked upon as being as great and deserved
as is the bestowal of the "Victoria Cross" in Great Britain and the "Iron
Cross" in Germany.
Since the year 1800 Congress has recognized gallant services in about fifty
instances, but only eighteen have been in the formal vote of thanks, the others
were by presentation of gold medals, swords, money and promotion. In 1805
Commodore Edward Preble, and through him, his officers, petty officers, seamen
and marines, received the thanks of Congress for gallantry off Tripoli in 1804.
In 1814 Captain Macdonough and O. H. Perry were similarly rewarded for their
gallant fights on Lake Champlain and Lake Erie.
At the close of the Mexican war, August 7, 1848, the officers, sailors and
marines of the navy received a vote of thanks, which, however, was of no in
dividual benefit, except as a compliment
The civil war of 1861-65 was naturally more prolific in substantial Congres
sional gratitude, and the following officers were thus honored in the order
named: Dupont, Â«once; Foote, Worden and Farragut twice; Goldsborough, Davis
and Rowan, once; Porter, three times; Stringham, Dahlgren, Rodgers, Ringgold,
Winslow and Cushing, once. Dahlgren received the vote of thanks for distin
guished services in connection with gun making, and Ringgold for saving lives;
all the others were for bravery and skill in battle.
In every instance advancement in rank and increased pay followed. Farra
gut rose from captain to rear admiral July 16, 1862; to vice-admiral December
31, 1864; to admiral July 26, 1566. Porter was raised from a commander to rear
admiral July 4, 1863; to vice-admiral July 25, 1866, and succeeded Farragut as
admiral at "the death of the latter, August 15, 1870. Rowan became a rear
admiral July 25, 1866, and succeeded Porter as vice-admiral August 15, 1870.
There has been only two admirals and one vice-admiral in our navy. The
rank was created expressly for Farragut, Porter and Rowan, and ceased with
the deaths of these officers. The retiring age of naval officers is 62, but the
vote of thanks retained these officers many years after the ordinary limit.
Farragut died at the age of 69; Porter at 78, and Rowan at 82 years of age, and
they remained on the active list until death closed their career, excepting Rowan,
who voluntarily retired one year prior to his demise.
Of rear admirals, Rodgers and Worden retained their places on the active
list many years beyond the retiring age.
A vote of thanks to Commodore Dewey, therefore, means that he will be,
promoted to the rank of rear admiral; that his salary will be increased from
$5000 to $6000, and that his retirement will be deferred to such a time as he may
choose, which otherwise would occur next year. His promotion would not create
a vacancy in the grade of commodore, for officers thus promoted are carried In
addition to the regular number.
There has been several efforts to re-establish the grades of admiral and
vice-admiral, and if opportunities offer there are a number of officers that will
make records entitling them to become something higher than rear admiral.
Farragut reached that rank when he was past 62 years of age, Rowan was 58, and
Porter only 50. All of which tends to indicate that mere age, old or young, Is
no criterion of a naval officer's usefulness.
THE fIMERICfIN SONG.
What song shall America sing.
Young heir of the elder world.
Whose knee ne'er bent to tyrant king,
Whose banner defeat ne'er furled?
A song for the brave and the free.
No echo of antique rhyme.
But a shout of hope for the day to be,
The light of the coming time.
From the dark lowlands of the past.
Swelling loud o'er the victim's cries.
The hero's shout sweeps up the blast
Where wounded Freedom dies.
The drum's dull beat and the trumpet's blare
From the far-off years are heard;
But the paean of kings Is man's despair.
And the hope of the world deferred.
'Tls the song of the free we sing;
Of the good time not yet born.
Where each man of himself is kliig.
Of a day whose gladsome morn
Shall see the earth beneath our feet.
And a fair sky overhead;
When those now sad shall find life sweet.
And none shall hunger for bread.

At a meeting of the Building: Trades
Council at 915 Market street last night,
presided over by T. Crawnford, P. H.
McCarthy, president of Carpenters' and
Joiners' Union No. 22, introduced the
following resolutions, which were
adopted unanimously and a copy im

Kinley:
Whereas, The name of Harrison Q.
Otis has been presented to the Presi

United States Volunteers, and
Whereas, Senators White and Per
kins are urging the said appointment
of Harrison G. Otis, and in the event
of said appointment said appointee
would be placed at the head of troops

Whereas, The said Harrison &.
Otis is now and has always been

Whereas, The insult cast by him.

THE CAMP
California Troops Being
Rapidly Got Into
Condition.
The California troops, now being
mustered into the service of the United
States, are not equipped to the extent
necessary for active service. These
troops will be fitted out at the expense
of the Government, and will be
equipped on the same basis as the reg
ulars. The clothing and equipage now
in the hands of the volunteers will be
taken and a receipt given for the same
to the State authorities. Active prep
arations are now being made, and it
Is expected that within the next ten
days the volunteer regiments will be
in perfect condition.
To-day a site for a camp will be se
lected by the military authorities, and
It will probably be located on or near
the Presidio reservation. Hermann
Fchussler, chief engineer of the Spring
Valley Water Works, has tendered the
use of seven blocks in the Richmond
3 district, adjoining and south of the
Presidio reservation. Opposite this
site, on the Presidio rifle range, is
where the main camp will no doubt be
locate.d. Several other localities have
been looked over, but objections have
been raised against them.

this council that such honors be con
ferred upon those who enjoy the con

has done all in his power to hold the

himself so unpopular with our
people.

Captain Oscar F. Long, assistant
quartermaster, United States army,
acting- depot and chief quartermaster
of the Department of California, is
probably the busiest man in the ser
vice, stationed on the Pacific Coast.
The captain is a young, energetic of
ficer, and is capable of meeting any
emergency.
Captain Long has received authority
from the War Department to dispense
with formal contracts, etc., and to
day an informal contract will be
awarded for 1000 cords of hard wood
for the volunteer camp.
The army supply depot Is kept very
busy in getting ready for issue the ar
ticles of clothing, camp and garrison
equipage needed by the troops, in ad
dition to the supply now on hand that
was issued from the State of California.
The necessary transportation, con
sisting of wagons, harness and mules,
will be purchased under informal con
tract by the quartermaster's depart
ment and distributed to the different
organizations as directed by the com
manding general of the Department of
California.
Governor Budd has already submitted
to the military authorities statements
of what is required in addition to what
is now on hand to properly equip the
volunteers for field service. This state
ment shows the immediate requirement
of the troops of quartermaster and ord
nance stores. The former will be sup
plied from San Francisco and the ord
nance stores and equipments will be
issued from Benicia Arsenal.
There is a sufficient quantity of quar
termaster and ordnance stores on the
Pacific Coast to fully equi California's
quota of volunteers. When a deficiency
exists immediate supply will be fur
nished from Eastern depots.
Major Field, acting adjutant general
of the department of California, is well
acquainted with the needs of the regu
lars and the volunteers that will soon

constant communication by wire with
General Merriam, and sees that all the
orders coming from the general are
properly executed. General Merriam is

Gough streets to be mustered into ser
vice. The rolls now contain 492 men.
FATHER O'RYAN, WHO WANTS TO CO TO THE FRONT.
Father P. O'Ryan, director of the League of the Cross and assistant editor of
the Monitor, has volunteered his services to his country. He sent his name in to
Governor Budd when war first seemed inevitable. He has volunteered to go as
chaplain. Father O'Ryan was about the first clergyman to volunteer, but the
fact that he had done so was kept quiet. He is one of the most popular priests
of this city, and has been connected with the Monitor for a number of years.
but only 300 will be taken, giving 150
men to the company, but the KJK will
be retained as they may be needed to
recruit the two companies that are to
come from Sacramento and Los Ange
les.
Captain Carrington last night re
ceived the following dispatch:
Washington, D. C, May 5, 1898.
Confer with the Governor as to the nu
merical and other designations to be given
to volunteer regiments when mustered
into the United States service. Designa
tions thus arrived at will be satisfactory
to the War Department. CORBIN,
Adjutant General U. S. A.
This will enable California's National
Guard to keep their regimental forma
tion intact, and it is a source of great
rejoicing among the officers of the
Guard.
It is known that Governor Budd will
in all probability confirm all the recom
mendations that Major Rice of the ar
tillery may make for the appointment
of officers of his command.
IN CAMP ON
SATURDAY
Volunteers Will Go Under
Canvas at the Pre
sidio To-Morrow.
The California Volunteers will go into
camp next Saturday, if plans now formed
are not changed. In regard to water sup
ply for the troops, a conference was held
yesterday at United States army head
quarters in this city. Herman Schussler,
chief engineer of the Spring Valley Water
Works, indicated to Major Field, acting
adjutant general, U. S. A., and Captain
Carrington, the mustering officer, the
places where mains of the company's sys
tem might be tapped.
At headquarters of the. State military
forces in the California Hotel, a vast deal
of business necessary for the equipment
and mobilization of the California Volun
teers was transacted in a systematic
manner by Governor Budd and Adjutant
Genera^ Barrett.
Among the callers at headquarters who
were granted a conference with the Gov
ernor was Mayor Snyder of Los Angeles.
He denied that his visit had any signifi
cance or anything to do with military
matters. It is believed that he called
upon the Governor to discuss politics.
John A. Koster, who has been appointed
first lieutenant and adjutant of the bat
talion of heavy artillery by Governor
Budd, called at headquarters yesterday to
se"te General Barrett. He thanked the
Governor for his appointment, and stated
that he was glad to have a chance to
serve the Government. Lieutenant Kos
ter was at one time in the service of
the brigade of volunteer troops of South
Carolina. He has also seen eight years
of service In the National Guard of this
State, having been, in 1&87, appointed
captain and aid-de-camp of the comman
der of the Second Brigade.
Major General Dickinson has made the
following: changes in the detail of the offi
cers of his staff. The following have been
ordered upon active duty: Colonel L.
Barrere, Colonel J. J. Dwyer, Colonel C. T.
Sttmicy, Major L. S, Schmjtt aad Colonel
T. M. Cluff. The general also sent a dis
patch to Brigadier General Last yester
day instructing him not to bring along
â with the Seventh any soldiers who have
families who are dependent -upon them,
or any that are physically disqualified.
The fact is the men of the Seventh have
already been examined by the regimental
surgeons of that organization, but they
will also have to pass the physical exam
ination when they arrive here. â¢
Colonel Johnson of the Sixth Regiment
was closeted with the Governor for quite
a while during the earlier part of the day.
He seemed to be in an exceedingly happy
frame of mind when he came out of the
Governor's office, and the cause for the
same was found in the official statement
made by Governor Buua that Colonel
Johnson would command the two bat
talions of infantry.
Either Captain Rottanzl or Major Ped
lar of General Muller's staff will be ap
pointed surgeon of the battalion of in
fantry. The chances are that Rottanzi
will secure the appointment, and that
Pedlar will be given a surgeonship in
some other command.
Major Hayes of the Fifth Regiment is
investigating the destruction of Colonel
Fairbanks' picture in Oakland by some
member of that regiment. It has been
traced to one man, and he will be severely
dealt with by the officers of the Fifth as
soon as Major Hayes officially reports
the same to General Barrett.
Captain Louis Turner of the Naval Bat
talion, who has just returned from Alas
ka, was at headquarters yesterday, but
did not get a chance to see the Governor.
He reports that the sailor boys are eager
and anxious to see service, and that they
are trained to the hour, so to speak. Col
onel Thomas Barry was also at head
quarters early in the morning.
Major General Dickinson will issue the
necessary orders to-day calling out the
companies that have been chosen to form
the battalions of infantry. They will as
semble here about the middle of next
week and be mustered into service just
as soon as the heavy artillery has been
disposed of by Captain Carrington. The
Seventh Regiment will leave Los Angeles
early this morning, and will be ac
companied by Brigadier General Last and
staff.
While it was not officially given out by
the Governor, yet it is positively known
that the commissioned officers of the
First are to be Te-examined and subjected
to the same rigid physical examination
that the men have been made to undergo,
and that an order has been received from
the War Department to have this en
forced.
REGULAR ARMY.
Active Work in Recruiting
at the Presidio.
The only sign of activity at the Presidio
yesterday was centered in and about the
office of Lieutenant Boyd, recruiting offi
cer of the post. Twelve of the applicants
for enlistment succeeded in passing the
medical examination of the post sur
geons and were sworn in. Some of the
men presented flattering letters of rec
ommendation from well known business
men of this city, and the character of the
men generally is far above the average
of applicants for enlistment. Several of
the recruits are especially desirable on
account of their familiarity with the
handling of machinery of all kinds, and
such men will be assigned to the artillery
branch of the service.
While nothing definite has been done
regarding the encampment of volunteers
on the Presidio, Colonel Morris has, how
ever, concluded, after a careful inspection
of the grounds, that the only available
places are located on the slope to the left
of the railroad, at the entrance to the
reservaion, and the flat on which the tar
get range is situated. Water will, how
ever, have to be brought to the first
named place from some point outside of
the reservation, as it is claimed that the
present supply is sufficient only for the
regular number of troops stationed at the
post.
The Third Artillery band, wmch came
over from Angel Island Wednesday, will
probably return to that place soon, as no
provision has beeen made for maintain
ing the band at the Presidio. It is there
fore uncertain whether the band will give
a concert this afternoon.
RANGE OF GUNS,
San Francisco in No Dan-
ger of Serious Bom-
bardment.
Colonel Charles R. Buter, chief of the
Pacific Division of the United States En
gineer corps, is recognized in the array
as one of the leading experts In modern
artillery. He served with General Gil
more in the siege of Charleston and di
rected the fire of the ten-inch rifled Par
rott guns, which had a range of seven
miles. The modern ten-Inch rifled gun of
this day has an extrf-me range of ten
miles from a shore elevation.
The Scientific American of April 16, 1808,
published a diagram of the defenses of
San Francisco, and. added this comment
to , the publication of ; the map: "In > point
of fact with the . eleven-inch guns of > the
Vizeaya the vessel might lie off the coast
at the ; spot : marked Ai in â¢'â¢ the " engraving
and play at . bombarding the town of San
Francisco as long ias she pleased. .: : The
guns 'within the Golden ; Gate would -,â  be
powerless to : prevent bombardment."
When i Colonel Suter ; was shown the ar
ticle ; and ; the I engraving .he : said without
hesitation that.; the article was absurd,
ias \ the ' position : marked A', off | Seal =. Rock
â¢was in the range of the, iwelve-lncli rifled
mortar battery. "Apart from this, re
marked Colonel Suter, "it is doubtful
whether a ship coulu stand the recoil of
guns elevated to the degree of throwing
a shell into San Franvisco from that
point. There is always talk of this kind
to cause women and children to shiver,
but the thing is absurd. Every shot from
a high-power gun of eleven-inch caliber
costs a large sum of money. No sane
commander would think of expending his
valuable ammunition for the mere sake
of throwing shells into a city which he
could not capture. When cities are bom
barded the small shells are used. When
they explode in a building they do the
work of destruction as thoroughly as big
shells. I doubt very much if the damage
to San Francisco by a bombardment at
the range described would destroy prop
erty equal to the value of the ammunition
expended. Many of the shells would fall
on the streets or vacant, lots.
"A shell passing through abuildingwith
out exploding within the structure causes
little damage. Shells might pass through
the Claus Spreckels building without
doing a great deal of damage provided
that one did not explode inside the struct
ure. An interior explosion would create
great havoc."
Colonel Suter remarked that the plans
of defense contemplated the construction
of a battery near Lake Merced, but at
present it was essential to so fÂ»rtify the
Golden Gate as to prevent a hostile fleet
from getting into the harbor. The life of
a ship depends so much on Its supply of
effective ammunition that a commander
cannot afford to throw away his shells
in idle bombardment.
THE FIRST
REGIMENT MUSTER
The First Regiment will face the oath
to-day, and to-night it will sleep in the
Presidio under the eye of the Govern
ment.
The last company was examined by the
surgeons early this morning, and then
they heaved a sigh of relief, for they had
been on duty from early yesterday morn
ing, and nearly SOO men had passed
through their hands.
The regiment will be mustered In as a
body. It has been thought best to do so,
for under those circumstances the com
missions of the officers will all date from
the time of their original issue in the
National Guard, as their rank as volun
teers will all date from to-day.
'.It .was announced from Washington
that there would be battalion adjutants
allowed the regiment, and in that case
there may be a chance for providing for
some officers on the regimental staff who
have been legislated out of office. In case
Colonel Smith is consulted he will recom
mend Lieutenant Tobin inspector of rifle
practice and Lieutenant Huber commis
sary for the battalion places.
There is also a vacancy in the second
lieutenancy of Company E, and Otio
Swerdflger, the regimental sergeant
major, will be recommended by the colo
nel, if he has a chance to recommend.
The officers of the regiment were ex
amined last evening, and all of them
passed, while the men cheered every
time one of their own leaders came from
the examining-room with a smile of tri
umph.
It has been decided that the designation
of the First Regiment, after being mus
tered in, will be the "First Regiment of
California Volunteers." The Seventh
Regiment would in the ordinary course of
Â©vents be known as the Second California
Volunteers, but there is a desire on the
part of that regiment to â¢ retain its own
designation, and the Governor is disposed
to allow it to do so.
It has also been decided that those
men from out of town who come to San
Francisco in good faith for the purpose
of being examined and mustered in will
be returned to their homes at the ex
pense of the Government, but they must
have come in good faith.
It has been found, too, that most of the
supplies of the men of the regiment need
can be purchased here, and this will be
done. The men will be given . clothes,
shoes. Springfield rifles of the model of
'84 for all the old ones, besides tents,
blankets and everything pertaining to the
soldier. â -â¢'â  '..: i-.

A Patriotic Boy,
A boy about 17 years of age, giving tho
name of Charles Flynn, applied for en
rollment at the recruiting oiii'-Â» yester
day. He walked into the armory with a
pronounced military bearing, and asked
to see the recruiting officer. He was
properly directed, and he at once went
forward. He saluted the examining sur
geon and made his application to be en
rolled as a soldier.
"I am a corporal of the League of tho
Cross Cadets," he said, "but Colonel Sul
livan, our commanding officer, is so long
about calling us out that I got tired wait
ing. I am a son of Thomas Flynn, a vet
eran of the Civil War. I admit I do not
look to be very strong but I can hold my
own with any one of the men of the Na
tional Guard. If it is possible to take me
I would like you to do so, as I will go
along anyway."
"Come to-morrow." said the surgeon,
"and bring your father, the veteran, with
you, and we will see what can be done."
The boy retired, saluting as he went.

GAME BIRDS
FOR CALIFORNIA
Mongolian Pheasants to Be Im
ported and Liberated in
the State.
Streams Well Stocked With Trout
and the Fish Hatcheries Boun
tifully Supplied.
At the meeting of the State Fish and
Game Commissioners, held yesterday, the
subject of more extensively stocking the
State with Mongolian pheasants was dis
cussed at length. Some time ago the
Commissioners sent to Oregon for a lot
of these beautiful game birds, and many
j of those from the northern State were
I liberated in the most favorable valleys %>f
| California. However, the supply was not
j equal to the requirements, and the Com
missioners decided that greater efforts
should be made in this direction. Inquiry
was made through W. F. Russell of the
I North Pacific Coast Railroad Company
as to what the cost would be of getting
the birds direct from China, and a corre
spondent in Shanghai showed that they
could be landed in this city at a cost of
only $2 50 per pair, whereas it costs all of
! $4 50 per pair to get the pheasants from
j Oregon.
Upon this Bhowing the Commissioners
| decided to import about 100 pairs of birds
as an experiment from China. If they
I reach this port without much loss in num
i bers and In good condition it is likely that
1 a goodly number will be brought here so
th;it the entire State can be stocked. At
the present time pheasants are fully pro
i tected by law. Chief Deputy Babcock
! was instructed to make an investigation
; as to the freight rates on the proposed
| shipments of this kind of game.
Reports were made from the several
' trout hatcheries, all of which were of tho
most encouraging nature. At the Shovel
Creek station the take of trout eggs has
. been 750,000 so far and the run of fish is
| still fair. Superintendent E. \V. Hunt of
the Tahoe hatchery states that three and
a half million eggs have been taken. Ow
inp to the scarcity of water it has been
I derided that as soon as the number of the
take reaches four million eggs this work
will be stopped. The Increase in the take
this year over that of all other years Is
attributed to the fact that Placer and El
Dorado counties have passed local laws
which prohibited the taking of trout un
til June 1. or two months' longer season
than in the other counties of the State.
The State fish patrol la still on duty on
j the lake and streams leading to it, and
Placer County has helped greatly by fur
nishing a county patrol.
This policing of the trout waters has
prevented the Indians from destroying
large quantities of fish, as they usually
do. with spears and nets. In fact, thÂ«
Indians have been driven away from
these waters altogether.
Another Important movement the Com
missioners decided upon was the resump
tion of the work of stocking the streams
of the State with black bass. Deputies
Wilson and Cross will start out on this
work at once and place these fish in all
of the available streams where they will
have any chance of living.

THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 6, 1898.
FIRST CHOICES
IN HARD LUCK
The Bookmakers Had a
Corner on the Money
Market.
Miss Ross at 3O to 1 Downed
Zamar in Clever
Fashion.
Recreation Led Past the Wire by
Fonsovannah â Canace Fortu
nate to Get the Show.
A g-ood attendance, one glaring reversal
and the downfall of four well supported
favorites were the principal features of
the sport at Oakland yesterday. The
bookmakers smiled and fattened In nock
etbcok over the misfortunes of the
choices, for all were extensively patron
ized In the ring.
The side step Recreation gave the crowd
In the mile run was a most costly one.
She carried commissions galore at the
short price of 3 to 5, and was rather
handily beaten by the second choice, Fon
sovannah. Under double wraps for nearly
six furlongs she would not or could not
respond when Woods called on her in the
run home, and was led past the tape more
than a length by Hildreth's good colt.
La Goleta ran so well that she will bear
watching in her future races.
In her last two races Aprona has done
nothing to warrant her having an out
side chance In a bronco busting contest,
and was allowed to go to the post at odds
of 15 to 1 in the opening five furlong dash
for maidens. With Rufus Narvaez up
she led all the way, and in a hard drive
got the decision from the favorite, Rosa,
by a short head. Flandes came fast the
last part and was placed third, although
it looked as if Rose Maid finished in that
position.
Joe Mussle downed a bad lot in the
seven furlong rtin next decided. He ruled
a slight favorite over Millbrae In the bet
ting and won by half a dozen lengths.
Zaraida took the place from the latter.
The finale to the four furlong scramble
for two-year-olds was a smashing good
one. resulting in a victory for the Burns
& Waterhouse entry. Banewor, piloted by
Johnny Woods. Canace was a 6 to 5
choice throughout the betting. Banewor
broke first, but was almost immediately
passed by both Owyhee and the favorite.
When the scratch was reached McNich
ols had the first choice in front, but fool
ishly drew his whip. Woods then passed
him on the outside with Banewor, win
ning cleverly at the wire by less than a
length, and he also was nosed out for
the place by Owyhee. astride which Pig
gott put up a great ride.
The mile and a furlong was a pickup for
the 7 to 10 favorite. San Marco. Piggott
had the chestnut horse in front when the
stretch was reached, and won galloping
from the hard ridden Claudius. Metaire,
at 40 to 1, dropped into the show.
In the final six furlong sprint the 4 to
5 choice. Zamar, was beaten through the
stupid riding of tiawsnn. With the race
well in hand in the stretch, he came down
the center of the track, which gave Mc-
Donald, on the 30 to 1 shot. Miss Ross, an
opportunity to slip up on the inside and
win cleverly by over a length. Perry got

TRACK NOTES.
It Is now an assured fact that the great mare
Fleur de Lis will not journey East this spring.
Trainer Ab Stemler had the daughter of Maxim
out on the track yesterday, and while galloping
she broke down badly, and will now be shelved.
Mike Hennessy, who rode Flandes in the
opening event was positive that he won. To
moFt outsiders it looked as though Mike was
fortunate in being placed third.
Potentate and Palmerstcm were recently sold
to a Nevada purchaser who will use these two
well-bred horses for breeding purposes. Dan
Honig also disposed of three mares to the same
party.
r. It waa not Sari Cochran's day. The lop
eared horse will run better some day later in
the meeting when the price lengthens out.

PTJRE FOOD CAMPAIGN.
It Is to Be Waged With More Vigor
Than Ever Before.
James P. Dockery, chief food inspector,
inaugurated a new campaign against the
dealers in impure foods and milk yester
day. A lull in the fight for pure food was
caused by a misapprehension of the re
cent decision in the Superior Court. Now
that it is known that the pure food law
is valid, and that it was only insuffiiMency
of evidence that prevented a conviction in
the case tried. Inspector Dockery pro
poses to wage a vigorous war on all who
handle adulterated articles.
About twelve inspectors will be put in
thÂ£ field. Some will look after foods and
others after milk. Arrests will be made
of all who sell adulterated or impure food.
Samples of all kinds of articles will be
purchased, and no further warnings will
be given the milkmen. It Is probable that
a raid will be made to-night on some of
the milk wagons.

Injured in a Collision.
James A. Grant commenced suit yes
terday against the Market-street Railway
Company to recover $5000 damages for
personal injuries alleged to have been re
ceived on March 16 last while driving
along Broadway in an express wagon.
An electric car of the Broadway system
ran into the team, and Grant was thrown
from his seat, receiving severe bruises
about the body and head. Grant claims
that the accident was due to the careless
ness of the motorman.
Bad Tea Destroyed.
Twenty chests of condemned Chinese
tea were put aboard the revenue steamer
Hartley and dumped into the bay yester
day. It has been the custom heretofore
to have all condemned teas burned in the
Appraisers' building, but the burning was
very troublesome and consumed so much
time that it was decided to destroy It by
throwing it into the bay.
BETTING IS
NOW EQUAL
Sharkey Has Taken a
Very Sudden Rise in
Pooling.
Doubtless Ho Will Be a Favor
ite Before He Enters the
Ring.
The Purchasers of Tickets Must Be
Carol ul of Counter
feits.
Tom Sharkey is as confident of de
feating Jim Jeffries this evening as is
Admiral Sampson of defeating the na
val fighters of Spain.
Sharkey said yesterday that when a
match with Jeffries was first sug
gested he never expected to have an
opportunity of meeting the man who is
held by many expert judges of pugi
lism as being the superior of all the
fighters, excepting the Invincible Fitz
simmons.
Regardless of the fact that Jeffries
and Sharkey are equally confident of
victory the strangest feature in con
nection with the much looked for con
test between two marvelously able fel
lows is that the sports who are sup
posed to know a "thing or two" about
pugilistic contests are about equally di
vided in their opinions.
The only line that can be taken as an
evidence of the sincerity of the con
testants to fight for the honor and
emoluments at stake is the betting.
Jeffries, who certainly should command
the lead in the betting, with all things
considered, sold a strong favorite from
the time any wagering had been in
dulged in up to last evening, when a
marked change took place. For the
past week Sharkey was the under dog â
that is so far as the gambling end of
the game is concerned.
He figured for a time as low as $7
when Jeffries sold freely at $10, but
even at these figures the Sharkey men
! did not flood the market. In fact, very
[ few bets were registered.
Yesterday the Sharkev end took a
sudden jump in the ascendency, and
several large commissions were re
ceived at Crowley & Raggett's and at
Corbett's poolrooms to be nlaced in
front of the sailor's name. The order
of betting changed Immediately, and
Sharkey, boosted by his supporters, ran
from 7 to 10 to even money, and at
these figures the pool-sellers had large
wads of Sharkey money when they
closed shop.
Doubtless the Oakland sports will re
ply to-day with a large bag of coin,
which may alter the order of betting
somewhat and place Jeffries on the long
end.
Notwithstanding the fact that even
money was offered last evening in the
auction pools, Jeffries sold a strong fa
vorite in the paris mutuels as the fol
lowing table will attest, viz:
At 10 p. m.â
Jeffries. Sharkey.
From 1 to 4 72 32
From 5 to 9 188 82
From 10 to 13 107 68
From 14 to IV Â» 38 35
From 18 and over 58 63
Of the men it can be said without
the least fear of contradiction that
Sharkey and Jeffries are In splendid
condition to do battle for a nation, and
the general belief is that the best man
will win.
It Is to be hoped that the best man
will win and that the referee, Alexan
der Greggains, will decide accordingly.
This is Greggains' opportunity to
make or break. If he will be directed
by the advice of political sports then
his career as a referee and that of an
honorable man will end avd further
more a bad decision will certainly
sound the death-knell of pugilism in
this city.
Dan Lynch, although seemingly tak
ing not the least interest in this con
test, has been closeted with political
men who are In a position to kill or
elevate pugilism in this city.
Sufficient to say, however that if an
other Fitsimmons-Sharkey episode will
result then the sport of pugilism will
receive its well merited downfall for all
time.
The managers of the National Club,
Messrs. Groom and Gibbs, request that
the purchasers of tickets will be care
ful not to accept any tickets from out
side parties, as the market is flooded
with counterfeit tickets, which will not
be honored at the entrance to the Pa
vilion.
Agitator Kidney Dead.
"William Kidney, an old-time local poli
tician and self-constituted agitator, died
at the City and County Hospital yester
day afternoon. Kidney was arrested on
Tuesday for drunkenness, and when taken
to the Central Station showed symptoms
of illness which brought about his re
moval to the Receiving Hospital. From
there he was transferred to the City and
County Hospital, where he died. His ill
ness was caused, it is said, by exposure.
Kidney's first appearance in the political
arena was on the sand lot in the palmy
days of Denis Kearney. In some things
he was well informed, but his peculiar
method of imparting his information made
him an unwelcome orator on the political
rostrum.
The Actors' Fund.
At a meeting of the board of trustees
of the Actors' Fund of America, held in
New York a few days since, the Aldrich
percentage plan was adopted as the best
plan that could be devised for the pur
pose of keeping the treasury of the fund
in such condition as to meet the con
stant drain. After the plan was adopted
a circular, stating the many worthy fea
tures of the fund, and a pledge to be
signed by the various managers and
actors throughout the country was sent
out, reading as follows:
Aetnrs' Fund of Americaâ To the Board of
Trustees: We pledge ourselves neither to give
our theaters Without charge, nor our services
as managers or actors for any benefits (ex
cept In case of national calamity or local pub
lic disaster) unless the recipients of said bene
fits Bhall agree to turn over 12v, per cent of the
gross receipts thereof to the Actors' Fund of
America, to assist in its philanthropic work
of caring for the sick and dead of the theatrical
profession.
The above pledge has been duly re
ceived and signed by the firm of Freid
lander, Gottlob & Co.
ALL THE TRUTH
WILL NOW BE TOLD
Examination of the Case
Against the Railroad
Commissioners.
Collis P. Huntington Cited to Appear
Before Judge Heacock to Testify
to All the Facts.
For several days the attempt to induce
C. P. Huntfneton to tell something of
Southern Pacific affairs has been In prog
ress before the Railroad Commission. No
success has been attained there so far as
anybody has been able to notice. Now
Mr. Huntington is to be given another
chance. There is some curiosity to know
whether he will be so frank and open be
fore the second tribunal.
Mr. Huntington has been subpenaed to
appear next Monday and tell all he knows
concerning these delicatft matters. There
is a hope that during the course of in
quiry he will he requested to reveal the
whole truth concerning the charge that
his company has devoted certain sums
for corrupting certain papers, of which
the Examiner of this city is suspected of
being a sample. In fact it is expected
the president of the Southern Pacific will
be asked right out in meetin' if he ever
paid that publication $1000 a month, also
why. It may also be determined if he
paid it J7OOO for printing Creed Raymond's
speech, and $5000 for the purpose of in
ducing it to maintain a dignified and non
committal attitude while the Pattison
committee was at work.
Judge Heacock yesterday morning be
gan taking testimony in the case of the
Southern Pacific Company vs. the Rail
road Commissioners of the State of Cali
fornia. A week ago United States Cir
cuit Judge Morrow decided that all evi
dence relating to the expenditures of the
railroad company for lobbying and for
the subsidizing of so-called anti-monopoly
newspapers was admissible, and Commis
sioner Heacock is taking the testimony
on those lines.
There appeared for the railroad com
pany yesterday John Garber, J. E
Foulds and E. S. Plllsbury. On behalf of
the Railroad Commissioners Attorney
General Fitzgerald and Deputy Anderson
were present.
The only witness examined was George
T. Klink. auditor of the disbursement de
partment of the railroad company. He
told about the amounts of the different
mortgages upon the roads, and stated his
willingness to furnish the complete de
tails next Monday morning at half-past
10 o'clock.

LIABILITY OF
TOWBOATS
Mate Pederson Cannot Recover
From the Vigilant's
Owners.
Tha Schooner Danlalson Should
Have Followed tha Tug Better
Than She Did.
An interesting case, involving the lia
bility of towboat owners, was decided by
the Circuit Court of Appeals, when they
held that Louis A. Pederson was not
entitled to damages from the John D.
Spreckels & Bros. Company for a broken
leg. He was injured on board the schoon
er S. Danielson in Santa Barbara Chan
nel on December 1, 1894. while the ship
was in tow of the tug Vigilant.
The tug had been passed a line, one end
of which had been brought through the
breast chock, and from there was led to!
ths "pawl bit," where it was made fast.
The ship had been under tow for about
twenty minutes when the chock broke,
and Pederson, who was parceling tha
line near the chock, was thrown against
the capstan so violently that his leg was
broken and he was otherwise injured. Ha
sued the owners of the tug for damages,
alleging that the tug had not been skill
fully handled, and that it was towing too
fast. The decision was against him in the
lower court, and the Court of Appeals has
affirmed that ruling. Pederson was sec
ond mate of the ship.
In deciding the case the court declares
that the tug was properly handled and
that the rate she was going was a safe
one for tnwing. Testimony was quoted
to show that the line was fastened to the
wrong bit, and "had it been passed farther
aft, so as to tow in a straight line, the
chock would not have carried away.
It was also held that the vessel towed
must keep in the wake of the tug towing,
and this, it was declared, the testimony
showed, had not been clone. The com
plainant must prove negligence on the!
part of the tug, the court alleges, and
this had not been done. In fact, the court
announced as its opinion that the acci
dent was caused by the negligence of taa
mate. i

The Passion Play.
The "Passion Play" continues success
fully at the Baldwin every afternoon, be
ins displayed before the graze of spec-!
tators that have grown steadily in sizo
since the initial presentation. The per
fection of the animated pictures thrown
upon the screen is such that not the least
important feature of the great produc
tion, as it is given at Oberammergau
every ten years, is missed and a person !
sees the various characters full of life,
scenes of action and passing incidents in.
a most impressive manner. One of the
scenes of the play that is particularly
fine represents the placing of the crown
of thorns upon Christ's head. Then the
brutal guards press the cruel thing down
upon the victim's head until, as is most :
plainly seen, he falls forward in agony,
only to be dragged along by the crowd.
The "Passion Play" is to be continued
at tiie Baldwin every afternoon, including
Sunday, Saturday excepted, at 3 o'clockNEW PARK COMMISSIONER
The Successor to John Rosenfeld Appointed bu the
Goyernor.
A. B. SPRECKELS.
A dispatch from Sacramento announces that Governor Budd has appoint
ed A.' B. Spreckels as one of the Park Commissioners of Golden Gate Park,
San Francisco, vice John Rosenfeld. whose term has expired. The dispatch
says that while there are two other appointments to be made, the Governor,
following the lines laid down in his inaugural address, will not make any
other change in the Board of Commissioners for a month or two.
While it cannot be definitely stated that any one has been selected for
the next appointment, it seems to be understood that Dr. John F. Morse
will be chosen. As to the third Commissioner there is a deal of conjecture.
Rumor has been busy with the name of Colonel Kirkpatrkk. manager of the
Palace Hotel, but it is surmised that the Governor, while recognizing the
principle of a non-partisan selection, would not feel justified in naming two
Republicans on a board of three Commissioners.
A. B. Spreckels is a well-known citizen and Republican, and no doubt his
appointment will give universal satisfaction. The duty staked out for him
i? in line with his inclinations. He has always taken a deep interest in the
affairs of the park, and fortunately for the city he has the time and the
means to serve the public in this capacity. There is no salary attached to
the office, and therefore the only reward that one in this position can legiti
mately receive must spring from the knowledge of the Commissioner him
at he has done something to promote the welfare of his fellow-citi
sens. As a student in Germany Mr. Spreckels fancied the study in botany.
He is at hum.' among plants, knowing their natures and species. He is a
progressive, public-spirited man, who will take pleasure and pride in the
adornment and extension of Golden Gate Park.
GUNST IS
STILL IN
NEW YORK
The Police Commis
sioner is Seriously
111.
Has Abandoned His In
tended Trip to
Europe.
His Relatives Are Greatly Wor
ried Over His Condi
tion.
JUDGE TOBIN ALSO ILL.
The President of the Board Is Shortly
to Visit the Springs for His
Health.
Police Oommisssioner Gunst is a very
sick man. His friends are alarmed over
his condition, and fear that he will never
again occupy his seat in the Police Board.
Several weeks ago Gunst was granted
an indefinite leave of absence to visit Eu
rope in Bearch of health and rest. He got
a.Â« far as New York when he was taken
.sly ill. As his condition became
alarming, his physicians advised his re
moval to Atlantic City. He remained at
the latter place for n short time, and
was taken back to New York.
The fact that Gunst has not yet reached
Europe sefÂ»ms to Indicate that his health
tfllly pro wing worse. It is believed
that he has abandoned his trip to Europe
and intends to return to this city. His
relative*, whil<- refusing to discuss his
condition, admit that he is "not well."
Dr. Keeney, who returned from New
York several days ago. has told several
of his friends that Gunst was a very sick
man. He advised him. it is said, not to
m;ikf the trip to Europe, as it would
seriously interfere with his possible
chances of recovery. It is claimed that
the Police Commissioner is suffering with
Bright* disease of the kidneys and is in
that stage that presages little hope.
Judy Tobln, another member of vie
Police Commission, is also sick. He was
taken ill about two weeks ago, and has
since been confined to his bed. At one
time his life was despaired of, but the
attending physician has now hope for his
recovery. In a few days he will be re
moved to Skaggs Springs, where it is ex
pected he will regain his lost health.

Professor Ross of Stanford will never
forget the insult offered a Stanford grad
uate by some member of the San Fran
cisco Board of Education if his remarks
last night go to show anything. The sub
ject of his address which he delivered be
fore the woman's congress was "Can We
Escape the Growth of Social Distine
| tion?" He was mild until he came to the
â  question of public schools. He said that
he did not believe in sending children to
a public school if the private school were
superior to it. "How can the private
j schools help being superior," said he, "to
J the public ones when such a corrupt
Board of Education is elected as in this
city? Right ftere in this very city a Stan
ford graduate was refused a certificate
unless she paid $500. No wonder the
schools are corrupt when you have such
men in office."
"Equality as an American Ideal" was
the subject which David Starr Jordan
discussed to some extent. A few remarks
that- caused much favorable comment
were: "The greater number of people
who die do not die from any disease, but
merely because they are too foolish to livÂ«
any longer." "This country is now get
ting too large for any other country to
touch; they do not want to interfere with
us." Ending his remarks he said: "We do
not want to hold down our skylarks be
cause the chickens can't fly above uio
bushes."
Mrs. Sarah Pratt Carr spoke in the af
ternoon on the "Disintegrating Forces of
City Life." Mrs. Carr spoke for forty
minutes, and during that time she was
repeatedly applauded. In her address
she showed that she thought that a
woman's sphere was her home, that a
woman's mission was to be a good wife
and mother; that to understand how to
care for her house was the best knowl
edge of all.
Professor H. C. Babcock of the Univer
sity of California spoke on "The Mission
of the Social Settlements." He reviewed
his life in the South Park settlement in
this city, and seemed highly pleased with
its progress. He told of the mission of the
settlement and the good it did. He said
that the idea was to remedy the present
evil, and when the future comes along
with its misfortunes that another remedy
would be applied to them.
Injured in a Collision.
A jury was impaneled in Judge Hunt's
court yesterday to try the suit of Julian
R. Brandon to recover $75,000 damages
from the Southern Pacific Company.
Brandon, who was formerly engaged as a
real estate solicitor and instructor of
athletes, alleges that he received injuries
that will permanently disable him for life
during a collision between two trains near
Oceaa View April 1, 1897.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY G, 1898.
SHOULD BE
PUT OUT OF
THE WAY
Significant Remark
of the Spanish
Tourists.
They Threaten to As
sassinate Governor
Budd.
Think He Is Taking a Too
Active Interest in the
War.
THE POLICE INFORMED.
One of the Men Said to Bo In Hiding
at the Present Time at
Pinole.
There was considerable excitement
at police headquarters last night, due
to the report that two visiting Span
iards had openly asserted that they in
tended to assassinate Governor Budd.
The men arrived here last Friday on
the Eastern overland.
When this side of Sacramento one of
them was heard by a brakeman who
understands the Spanish language, to
say that Governor Budd was taking a
too active interest in the war and
should be put out of the way.
"He is an easy mark," the compan
ion is said to have remarked. "We can
get him at any time."
Suspecting that the brakeman under
stood their native language, the men
afterward conversed in subdued tones.
When Pinole was reached one of the
Spaniards, after wishing his compan
on good luck, alighted from the train.
The other did not leave the train until
it reached the Oakland mole.
He was soon lost in the crowd, and
whether or not he came to this city is
a matter o/ conjecture.
After seriously thinking aver the le
marks passed by the Spaniards the
brakeman, fearing that they intended
to assassinate the Chief Executiva, de
cided to inform Detective Seymour,
with whom he is well acquainted. Last
evening he visited police headquarters
and informed Seymour of the conversa
tion between the men. Seymour, after
ADVERTISEMENTS.
A WISE
Intelligent men have long
been convinced of ths desir-
ability of life insurance, but
certain of them have thought
it not wholly wise that a con-
considerable sum of money
should be given into the keep-
! ing of the members of their
family who often are wholly
inexperienced in the care of
money and the value of in-
vestments. Recognizing the
sense of this contention The
Mutual Life of New York
offers in its Continuous In-
come Debenture Policy a
contract which provides a
life income f-r a surviving
wife, and which also secures
a like definite income to her
children, and finally the re-
version to them of the sum
originally insured.
It is an income-producing
estate, and absolutely the
safest asset a man can leave
to those who survive him.
The contract provides for
the wife a life annuity of 5$
on the total amount of the
insurance, and at her death
either an annuity of 3$ con-
tinued to the children or the
payment of the entire princi-
pal sum to the child or child-
ren named as residuary ben-
eficiaries.
These are the simple, and,
at the same time, the great
advantages obtainable under
this pledge of faith and se-
curity of this great Company.
Further privileges and addi-
tional benefits are included
in the options of the policy,
but its great and important
value consists in the interme-
diary trust during the life of
the wife and at her death the
reversion of that trust for an-
nuity purposes or the pay-
ment of the full amount to
the surviving children.
No contract containing
such provisions can be had
elsewhere which can offer
any such intrinsic value.
This is based on the vast re-
sources and unassailable rec-
ord of
THE MUTUAL LIFE
INSURANCE COMPANY
OF NEW YORK.
listening to his story, at once hunted
up Governor Budd, to whom he im
parted the information of the alleged
plot to assassinate him. The Governor
did not seem in the least alarmed, but
requested Seymour to do all in his
power to apprehend the Spaniards.
"Look out for that fellow at Pinole,"
the Governor is said to have remark
ed. "He may cause us some trouble."
As the powder works are situated at
Pinole and to prevent a repetition of
the terrible explosion at Santa Cruz,
which presumably was caused by
Spaniards, the police are doing their
utmost to locate the two men.
When seen last night Detective Sey
mour was inclined to be unusually se
cretive.
"Whether there is anything In it or
not I do not know," he remarked after
considerable questioning. "The brake
man, whose name I am not at liberty
to divulge, has been in the employ of
the railroad company for over twenty
years. lam convinced that he is tell
ing the truth, as he would have no
object in misleading us. He speaks
the Spanish language fluently, and
could not have been mistaken in the
meaning of the remark passed by the
blood-thirsty Spaniards."
Seymour admitted that he was look
ing for the two men and that he earn
estly hoped to apprehend them. The
Constable at Pinole has been advised
of the remarks passed by the Spaniards
and instructed to arrest the one who
left the train at that point.
THE CROCKER MINORS.
Mrs. Easton Wants to Be Relieved of
uuarding the Minor Children's
Estates.
Mrs. Adeline M. Easton, guardian of
the person and estates of Mary, Charles
Templeton and Jennie Adeline Crocker,
the children of the late Colonel Charles
F. Crocker, has petitioned the Superior
Court to be relieved of the responsibility
of looking- after the estates of her grand
children. She wili retain the guardian
ship of their persons, but asks that Henry
T. Scott and Charles E. Green, the execu
tors of -Colonel Crocker's will, be
awarded the guardianship of the estates
of the three children. Mrs. Easton, who
is the grandmother of the children, feels
that she should relinquish the guardian
ship of their estates, as she is growing
old and infirm. Judge Coffey will hear
the petition a week from next Monday.
IN THE DIVOBCL COURT.
Judge Hunt yesterday granted Catherine
Strong a divorce from Allen Strong on
the ground of neglect.
Mary Yeaton has been granted a divorce
from Charles H. Yeaton on the ground
of extreme cruelty.
Judge Hebbard yesterday granted An
gus A. Gilmour a divorce from Susan E.
Gilmour on the ground of desertion.
Judge Belcher has granted Laura C.
Brott a divorce from Frank Brott on
the ground of failure to provide.

It was the storekeeper at a little lowa town who
reTated that the first he ever heard of Ripans Tabules
was from a runner for a Burlington house, who gave him
a few. " I had been telling him that I had been a pro-
nounced victim of dyspepsia for several years, when he
took from his pocket a small vial, saying : â¢ Here is what
you want.' Well, from that it came about that I began
to use Ripans Tabules. It may be that I would have
got well anyway, but of this lam certain : I have not
been troubled at all with dyspepsia during the last yeaii l^

are expected.
Sudden Death of J. H. Hefing.
John H. Hefing, or Haling, was
found dead in bed yesterday morn
ing in a lodging house at 519
Sacramento street. He was a native
of Germany and about 65 years old. Death
was from natural causes, but because no
physician had been in attendance the
body wa3 taken to the Morgue. Hefing
left $1600 in the Hibernia and the German
banks, and lived very economically on the
small sums which he drew every month.
Sent to the Insane Asylum.

EXPLANATION.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top fig
ures at station indicate minimum temperature
for the days; those underneath it. if any. the
'amount of rainfall or of melted snow In inches
and hundredth s during the past twelve hours.
Isobars, or bo! lines, connect points of equal,
air â¢.-lire, isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
â temperature. The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and is usually accompanied
by lair weather; "low" refers to low pressure
and Is usually preceded and accompanied by
â cloudy weather and rains. "Lows' usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure is high in the Interior and low
â¢along the coast, and the Isobars extend north
and south along the cast, rain Is probable;
â¢but when the "low" is inclosed with isobars of.
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is Im
â¢probable. With a "high" in the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Califor
nia coast, warmer weather may be expected In
Himmer and colder weather In winter. The re
verse of these conditions will produce an oppo
site result.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, May Professional operators j
all turned bulls to-day after a brief period of
doubt and hesitancy after the opening of the
. Stock Exchange. As ; a matter !of fact, \ they
â¢were forced into this position by the unmis- j
takable temper of the outside public, mani- j
fested by their disposition to come in the mar- i
ket and buy stocks In large blocks at the i
market price. The professional operators were
made somewhat wary by the failure of the
London market to show any Independent inter
est In American securities yesterday, while
Wall street was taking a holiday. The same
elements were apparently rather suspicious of
the advance in London before the opening here
this morning, and were disposed to attribute j
It to manipulation from this side. Prices here i
failed to respond at the opening to the London !
advance and ruled below the London purity j
for a considerable time. The market was full |
of outside buying orders and business was on
a large scale, but had a very heavy burden of i
profit taking sales to carry, and the small
opening gains were In large part wiped out
during the first hour. The reaction here failed j
to impair the confidence In London, where !
Americans continued very active and strong. \
The buying here for arbitrage account was also â 
on a very large scale in all the international '
stocks and turned the scale to the bull side. '
Large operators who had taken profits 'on '
Tuesday and this morning, impelled by appre- |
hension that the rise was progressing too fast, i
felt renewed confidence on account of the sup- j
port accorded to London and the outside public
and turned buyers of stocks again. The mar
ket presented all the characteristics of the
rampant bull spirit. From time to time the
general strength was taken advantage of for |
heavy profit taking In special stocks. At otner
times. when there was a disposition for busi
ness to languish individual stocks were pushed I
vigorously upward for the purpose of sustain
ing the general market. Rock Island was the
center of interest In the railroad list and was !
lifted l'Â« points to a parity with St. Paul.'
Sugar was furiously active and very volatile j
all day, covering an extreme range of 4% points
and gaining 3% points net. The large majority
of stocks traded in are at least a point higher,
and net grains range from that up to 3 points.
There was no special development in the situa
tion to account for the buoyancy of the mar
; ket beyond the general conviction that Spain's
capacity to carry on the war is nearly ex
hausted.
. The bond market shared the activity and
strength of the stock market and shows higher
prices all around. Total sales, $2,525,000.
United States new 4s registered advanced *Â£, I
and United States new 4s coupon % in the bid i

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, May s.â Liverpool set the ball
rolling in the wheat market by reporting an
other sensational advance there at the open
ing, the gain In July compared with the pre
vious day's closing- quotation being equal to
about 7c a bufhel. The reason for the Liver
pool advance was of course the Continental
competition for the wheat cargoes and ar
| riving off coast in the United Kingdom and
i the greater activity of France and Antwerp
| Importers to secure them. The grain duties
j having been abolished in France, Italy and
! Spain, leaves those countries to dispute with
the United Kingdom for possession of the
wheat as it arrives off coast on the other
side. The confirmation abroad, so clearly
given by the removal of the duties, Justified
apparently to the full the conviction with which
Leiter started in last July to buy wheat. The
Continental nations by throwing off the im-'
port duties seemingly admit their own stocks
have been practically exhausted. Active com
petition at Liverpool has caused a rapid ad
vance there for the past week; but the full
I force of the famine was not felt in this mar
ket until tc>-day. At the present time July
option is the active speculative month and
bears have sold freely, expecting to fill their
I contracts out of the new crop. But the May
i options appear to be controlled entirely by
Joseph Leiter, who, If to-day's market can be
taken as an indication, holds the few who are
still short to him In a "death grip."
The market opened at an advance of lc for
July and â¬c for May. As usual, the pit traders
sold and July wheat started at 99% c, sold up
to $1 00%, and dropped back to 98*ic. May
which began at $1 3., reacted to $1 31. Letter
brokers thought July on the decline and after
| accumulating a pouple of million bushei 3 with
j drew. Closing cables from abroad showed ad
; ranees of 7^c at London, ,'c at Liverpool. 4c
j at Antwerp and Cc at Paris. Then I,t-it.-r
I capped tho climax by announcing th.^ sale of
2.'R'".oot"> bushels of No. 2 red to a French syn
dicate at $1 47 per bushel. In addition Leiter
sold 730,M6 bushels in odd lota. This remark
able transaction set tho pit wild. May wheat,
which had rallied to the. opening price, $1 37
Jumped- to $1 50, with 2 and 3 cents between
â J sal(}Â£. The trad.9 was apt bread by any means .
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 6, 1898.
It simply meant that somebody '-'â . had ' been
caught short and was trying to get . out ' re
gardless of the : cost. At $1 50 Leiter brokers
stopped the advance by selling a few small
lots, but the market closed strong at the fig
ures. July was handicapped by free liquida
tion for a time. . From around 99% c it grad

NEW YORK WHEAT MARKET.
â¢ NEW YORK, May s.â The sensational fea
ture In wheat this afternoon was furnished
by the May option. In steady leaps and
I bound? of several cents at a .clip ' It bowled
: along until stopped by the closing gong at $1 45,
the highest price since the days of "Old
I Hutch." On this basis cash No. 2 red would
| be nominally worth $1 47 in this market. The
i July option kept very strong all the afternoon
i and closed finally at SI 09%. after sales at
' $1 10Â»4, representing advances of 6%c over Tues
! day's close and 2\c above yesterday's curb
| price. May closed 22c higher than Tuesday
i and 27c above the low . point this week. .It
was simply a gigantic squeeze of shorts, made
possible by the duty removals in France, Italy
and Spain, which is expected to swing an
enormous export business this way in the next
two months. The price of flour has advanced

A car of new Oats, the first of the season,
came in from Mayfleld. It was very poor,
being foul and not over six Inches long. No
body wanted It and $.12 50 was the best bid
for it. There will be a good deal of such Hay
this year, and by and by people will be glad
to get it. â¢
The market is lower, owing to heavy receipts
from outside sources. Of yesterday's receipt!

NO CASH FOR
THE EXPERTS
Only Glory for Witnesses
in Clara Fallmer's
Defense.
Those for the People Receive
Handsome Fees for Their
Knowledge.
Interpretation of a Statute That Is of
Great Import to Defend
ants.
Oakland Office, San Francisco Call,
SOS Broadway, May 5.
A question involving the privileges of
a person charged with murder is now j
hanging fire in the legislative department
of this county, that if a determination j
can be reached will establish an import- j
ant precedent one way or the other. The
debatable point is the latitude of a stat- |
ute enacted in 1872, which gives the court j
and its officers power to employ expert ;
testimony in any case in which it is con- ;
eidered absolutely necessary.
In the trial of Clara Fallmer for murder |
two experts, Drs. Robinson and Rucker, j
â were employed by the District Attorney |
to assist in the prosecution. The defense j
having no money, and considering it nee- ,
essary to employ medical experts, ap- j
pealed to Judge Ogden to authorize under >
the statute of 1572 the employment of nee- j
essary expert testimony. The judge i
Btated that in his opinion the statute in- j
vested the court only with the power to
demand such testimony, and said that if j
It w i ro left to the attorneys for the de- j
tfensf it would be opening the door to vast
expenses for the county in the future.
Attorneys George W. Reed and A. L.
Friek, who handled the case for the de- i
fendant, argued in chambers that the
statute clearly gave them the right to ex- j
pect that the fee for their experts should ;
be paid by the county when it had been
shown that the defendant was without
means to provide such testimony.
The statute states that the court shall
name the amount of the fees to be paid !
to the experts, and also states that this j
statute is not conclusive. The attorneys j
for Clara Fa'.lmer argued from this that i
the statute meant to give equal chances j
to the prosecution as well as to the de- :
fense. so that justice could be obtained, j
The District Attorney does not consult
the court regarding the employment of j
witnesses necessary to present Ills side of !
ase, and the defense contends that \
should exercise the same privilege. !
In the case the judge declined to make ;
rder before the trial, and the de- j
fense subpenaed Drs. Dunn, Rabe and \
Uamlin in the prisoner's behalf. After
the trial Judge Ogden way asked for a ]
certificate that could be attached to the
lulls of the three doctors, and declined to
give one. After more argument he signed j
a modified certificate, which set forth the |
services rendered, the language of the ;
statute, and also the fact that the judge
had not appointed the experts.
It was generally understood by the de
fense that when the bills were presented !
to the Supervisors they would be passed j
and paid. But at the last meeting an oral i
opinion was rendered from the District
Attorney's office advising that the certifi
cate was not sufficient and that the bills !
be not paid.
On looking at the record it is shown !
that the two doctors who testified for the ;
prosecution received {100 apiece, and as
the experts for the defense only charged i
ISO a. niece, they contend that there can be
no doubt as to the reasonableness of their â 
charge, and consequently the case hangs
entirely on the interpretation of the stat
ute.
Clara Fallmer's attorneys exnress the
opinion that if the bills of their experts :
are not paid it shows a possibility of dis- i
crimination not contemplated by the stat
ute against people without means who
are charged with serious crime. All the
experts in the case were put on to testify I
rr-garding the insane tendencies or the de- ;
fendant. and mainly on the strength of
the testimony of the experts for the de- i
Tense the girl was acquitted.

vAKLA.\'D, May s.â The fourth report '

Derby. Nicholas Moritz and A. L. Mc-
Phtrson. George E. de Golia is the at
torney and C. S. Melvin the secretary. !
The first report was presented September !
1, 1893, and knocked out July 6, 1894 by the !
euit of H. M. Cameron vs. T. G. Harrison i
then Superintendent of Streets. The sec- I
ond report was filed July 20, 1895, and re- i
t erred back by the Council. The third re- !
port was presented November 26, j
1896, and knocked out by the suit of Isa- |
bel Wright vs. Street Superintendent I

Employes' Day's Outing.
OAKLAND. May 5.â A. L. Stone, secre
tary of the Oakland, San Leandro and j
Haywards Electric Railroad, gave his [
men full swing of the road to-day for
their families and friends for their annual
picnic at San Lorenzo Grove. The cars
ran "regardless" and "meeting points"
were anywhere except on "single tracks." â 
The invitations were not as numerous as i
last year, but' those who attended had
B better chance to enjoy themselves, ow- ;
Ing to the absence of a jam. The early ;
morning was dark and unpleasant, but ;
before noon the sun came out and the j
Fifth Regiment band played while the
"boys" let the trolley fly. A lengthy pro- |
gramme and plenty of athletic events !
made the time fly only too quickly. It i
-was late to-night before the return home j
â¢was made.
Bostonian Visitor Missing.
OAKLAND, May s.â Andrew Mahan,
â who arrived here last Friday morning
from Boston on a visit to his brother, is
niiFsing, and it is feared that he has met
â with foul play, as he had considerable
money when last seen. The police have j
been requested to look him up as he has
been unaccounted for for nearly a week.
He went out on the evening of his arrival
and has not been seen since.
Emery Tract Changes Hands.
OAKLAND. May s.â The Abner Doble
Company transferred a mortgage on the
entire Emery tract to the Realty Syndi
cate to-day. It was to cover six promis
sory notes of the value of $100,534 28, $61,

TRIED A CASE
TOO EARLY
Meyer in Court the Day
After He Won a
Sheepskin.
Not Having a License He Was
Forced, to Give His
Testimony.
Lost His Suit but Thinks Ho Can
Win by Prosecuting an
Appeal.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 5.
J. S. Meyer passed his examination be
fore the Supreme Court to practice law
a week ago. The next morning he was
engaged in a case in the Police Court, j
appearing as attorney for Contractor j
Quirk, who was on trial for an alleged
violation of the ordinance governing the
laying of sewers.
Aiuiough it requires no license to prac
tice in the Police Court, the practitioner
cannot plead that he is debarred from
testifying, if called upon, on the plea of
professional confidence.
Prosecuting Attorney Melvin was con- j
ducting the case for the people, and he j
put J. S. Meyer on the stand to testify j
against Quirk. Meyer protested that he
was an attorney and declined to testify,
making the excuse that the information
he possessed was obtained in confidence ;
from Quirk. Judge Allen ruled that as ;
Meyer had no license to practice law, no
such professional confidence could exist,
and to avoid contempt proceedings Meyer ;
gave his testimony. \
Quirk lost his case, and Meyer and J.
F Fitch, who also appeared as attorney
for Quirk, declare that it was through j
Meyer's testimony that the verdict was
The next morning Meyer received his
certificate from the clerk of the Supreme i
Court, showing that he had successfully j
passed his examination and had been ad- j
mitted to practice law. Now the point j
i rises whether Meyer was a bona fide
attorney as soon as his case was passed
upon by the Commissioners, or whether
his legal standing became a fact only j
when he received this certificate. He be- ;
lieves that if an appeal be taken he can !
satisfy the Sunerior Court that he was j
de facto an attorney at the time he was ;
ordered on the witness stand, and that \
his testimony should, therefore, be strick
en from the record, i*. this be done At
torney Meyer is confident the judgment
will be reversed.
National Guards Hopeful.
ALAMEDA, May s.â Despite the dis
couraging tenor of Governor Budd s re
marks upon the Fifth Regiment, as re-
I ported in the morning papers, the mem
1 bers of Company G continue hopeful tnat
< some way will be found to let them enter
the active service. The record made by
them at the last inspection, the rapidity
. with which the full number of men was
recruited and the general high standing
i of the organization are the reasons for
! their hopefulness. While they would pre
'â  fer of course to remain in the Fifth Regi-
I ment. still, so long as their company or
'â ' ganization is maintained, as proposed by
i the authorities, they have no objection to
! being put into any other regiment. In
' fact, all that they want is active service,
and they are ready to obey orders
promptly and with enthusiasm.
Bed Cross League.
ALAMEDA, May s.â Enrollment lists

natures were obtained during the day. It
is proposed to call a mass-meeting as
soon as public interest shall have been
sufficiently aroused. Twgnty prominent
citizens will be appointed vice-presidents
by President Mastick within two or three
days.

THE SAIS FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 6, 1898.
WANT FUSION
AND MAGUIRE
Populists Open Their
Campaign With a De
sire to Mix.
Prospect That the Stalwarts
Prefer the Middle of the
Road.
Democrats Have Not Vet Made a
Move in Alameda
County.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, May 5.
The Populists opened their campaign
last night in this county. Since the lively
times prior to the McKinley-Bryan cam
paign little has been heard df the party,
and it almost completely lost its identity
in the celebrated fusion that did not fuse.
In 1894. at the county election, the Popu
lists showed what might be called abnor
mal strength in this county. They elect
ed the Sheriff, the County Treasurer and
County Superintendent of Schools, and
their organization was remarkably
strong. Two years later the party fell
into the fusion trap of the Democrats,
and, as the fusion vote of Alameda Coun
ty for Bryan was not much larger than
the ordinary Democratic vote, some sur
prise was expressed and some curiosity
evinced to know what had become of the
Simon Pure Populist*. Since that time
till last night the party has been in se
clusion, but It is now coming to the front,
and it is found that there is still a strong
fusion element in it, only this time the
desire to fuse is not over a President, but
a Governor. It seems to be conceded
among the Democrats of AJameda County
that AJu.guire will be the candidate for
Governor. There are many Populists in
this county who think enough of Maguire
to want to fuse with the Democrats to se
cure his election. This element in. the
Populist party in Alameda County col
lided very forcibly at the very first meet
ing of the county committee heid last
night, with the stalwart Populists, who
argue first, last and all the time in favor
of keeping in the middle of the road.
The latter element is headea by Dr.
Oberg of Temescal and A. A. Bretz, who
figured once in the Assembly.
F. J. Gregory is said to be the leader
of the fusionists, and at present there is
no prospect of immetJate harmony. The
party evidently intends to get into the
field early, for Chairman Gregory has al
ready appointed a committee consisting
of G. A. Toyne, M. J. Manson, P. B.
Preble, A. Hoenich and J. C. Estey, to
draw up a call for the county conven
tion.
So far nothing has been heard from the
Democrats of Alameda County. Whether
the old factional strifes are still in ex
istence or whether the hatchet hae been
permanently buried cannot be tojd. But
the prospects are that there will be as
much discord within the ranks as there
always has been.
The Seventh Ward Republican Club will
meet to-morrow evening in Judge Law
rence's courtroom in Elast Oakland, and
it is believed that an attempt will be
made to unite the club with the Young
Men's Republican Club of that ward.

cial notice for a full attendance, as he
will appoint the club's executive commit
tee to-morrow night.
Recruiting in Oakland.
OAKLAND, May s.â Orders were re
ceived to-night from Colonel Fairbanks
of the Fifth Regiment by the captains of
Companies A and F to recruit to the full
limit of 103 men each. Company A drilled
to-night and already has ninety-nine men.
The companies will be filled to-morrow.
An investigation has been made into
the insult to Colonel Fairbanks, whose
pictures were turned to the wall and
dressed with old overalls yesterday. It
has been found that the work was done
by some hotheaded members of Company
A, who were also responsible for the un
seemly language written on the portrait
in Company F's room. The perpetrators
of the deed will be punished.
Took Tobin Unawares.
OAKLAND, May 5.â D. J. Tobin, a
horseman, was arrested yesterday for
battery upon the person of his Japanese
cook. Deputy Constable Robinson went
to his residence to serve the warrant, but
was told that he could not, as it was in
Contra Costa County. He returned to
ward home, but stopped when well out
of sight and tied his horse among some
trees. He then hid along the road. After
a two hours' wait he was rewarded by
tWe appearance of Mr. and Mrs. Tobin
in their family coach, driven by a coach
man. He stopped it and read the war
rant in a loud tone of voice. Tobin was
then compelled to go to Justice Ij&w

MOSQUITO FLEET
NEARLY READY
Revenue Cutters Grant,
Rush and Corwin Put
on War Paint.
Alterations to the Fearless, Vig
ilant and Active Nearly
Completed.
In a Week or So the Little Boats Will
Be Ready to Back Up the
Monterey.
The revenue cutters Grant, Rush and
Corwin put on their fighting colors yes
terday and are now ready for active ser
vice as far as looks go. Early in the
morning the sailors were put to work
and before very long the white, trim
looking cutters were the same color as the
Monterey and equally as attractive look
ing.
Alterations on the tugs Fearless, Vigi
lant and Active are rapidly progressing
and in a few days they will be ready to
Join the revenue cutters, and then the
mosquito fleet will be ready for action.
The Vigilant has had her masts and tow
ing bits taken out, her machinery and
boilers have been overhauled and as soon
as her guns have been mounted she will
be ready for service. The boilers have
been taken out of the Active and several
alterations have been made to her hull,
and she will also be ready to give an ac
count of herself as soon as her guns are
mounted. Very few alterations are to be
made on the Fearless outside of painting
her the regulation fighting color. After
the war the chances are that the Active
and Vigilant will be sold 1 but the Fearless
will always remain a part of the United
States navy.
In a week or so the entire fleet will
probably be seen off Folsom street wharf
keeping the Monterey company. There
will be eight vessels in ail-the Grant,
Rush, Corwin, Vigilant, Fearless, Active,
Unadilla and Monterey. Then if the
Charleston should not have sailed for Ma
niiT n.nd the rejuvenated Camancne should
c^me down from Mare Island there, would
be quite a gathering of Uncle Sam's yes-
States steamship Albatross,
late the Fish Commissioners' steamer, la
also being fitted out at the Union Iron
Works Lko the other boats her crew
is now being enlisted at the naval rendez
vous at 10 California street. The suppo
sition is that either the Albatross or
Grant will be the flagship of the mosquito
fl Captain L, H. Turner of the Naval Re
serve returned from the north yesterday
and at once paid a visit to the training
ship Marion. He found that in his ab
sence Lieutenant Commander Nerney
had taken all the necessary steps to have
the men ready for an instant call. The
boys n blue are taking a great interest
in pa^sint? events and every one cf them
is hoping that he will get a chance to do
some fighting under Old Oiory.
The mascot of the coast defense steam
er Monterey is a bis black dog named
Jumbo and the canine's particular fnend
Is "sailor named Skelley. The latter was
skylarking with some of the men early
yesterday morning, and to escape a rush
made by one of them, he jumped Into a
catamaran that was swinging in the
davits. The catamaran tipped over and
Skelley was dumped .into the bay. The
strong flood tide carried him away from
the warship, but before he had gone
thirty feet Jumbo was off to the rescue.
He swam up to Skelley, and catching him
by his clothiug around the neck held his
head above water until the snips boat
came along and picked them both up.
The sailor was none the worse for his
ducking, and now Jumbo is more of a
pet than ever on the Monterey.
The batteries at Fort Point, Lime Point
and Point Bonita are to do some practice
filing in a few days, and the officers of
the forts have issued a warning to all
kinds of craft to keep out of the line of
fire. Notices in English and Italian were
posted at Fishermen's wharf, and the
fishing steamer Alphonso XIII was sent
out to the fishing grounds to warn all the
incoming boats. Assistant Chief Whar
finger Scott took a gang of men with him
on the State tug Governor Irwin and
placed a red flag nn Mile rock to warn
everybody out of the line of fire. It was
blowing almost a gale of wind at the
heads, and in consequence the landing
party on the Irwin had considerable diffi
culty in planting the flag on the rock.
The ship Louisiana, which arrived from
\ustralia with coal last Wednesday,
dragged her anchor yesterday and nearly
went ashore on Alcatraz Island. It took
two tugs a long time to get her anchors
up and the vessel to a safe anchorage.
Several changes have been made in the
officers of the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company's fleet. J. Judson Campbell, the
purser of the Umatilla, has been trans
ferred to the new steamer Senator, and
T C. O'Donnell, late freight clerk of the
Umatilla, has been made purser of that
vessel. Charles C. Lacey. who for years
was chief engineer of the Umatilla, has
been made supervising engineer of the
company's fleet, with headquarters at
Seattle. " Mr. Lacey was at the head of the
engineers' force that assisted Captain C.
Miner Goodall in raising the steamer
Corona.
News was brought from Dyea the lat
ter pa-rt of April that among those killed
in the avalanche at Sheep Camp was C.
C. Jewell of this city. This information
was not correct, as his wife has received
two letters from him since that date.
The Yukon River steamer Rideout was
launched at 3 p. m. Wednesday from the
shipyard at Stockton and was towed to
San Francisco the same night by the
steamer A. C. Freese. The Rideout is 1&0
feet long. 32-foot beam and 4^-foot depth
of hold and will have two pairs of tandem
engines 14 and 24-inch diameter of cylin
der by 6-foot stroke. She is calculated to
make about 14 knots, and will be used on
the Yukon as a passenger and towboat
combined, having accommodations for 200
passengers. The boat was put up by
William Delaney at the yard of the C. N.
& I. Co., and was ready to be knocked
down and shipped on the Whltelaw on
March 10, but owing to the loss of the
wrecker by fire at Dyea the managers of
the California Yukon Trading Company
decided to complete the boat and tow her
to St. Michael. Captain R. Fredrick, who
was placed in charge of the work, put a
number of extra kelsons and clamps in
her. bracing her thoroughly under the
deck with truss work and fastened her
throughout with screw bolts, making her
stiff enough to make the long ocean voy
age. She was ready for launching in
twenty days, but was delayed by not be
ing able to secure calkers, and as the
boat was set up 100 yards from the water,
another delay of a week was caused In
moving her to the river. The machinery
will be rushed into her by Chief Engineer
Fox and his assistants, as she should be
ready for sea by the 20th of this month.
A BOBBERS' ROOST.
Detectives Make a Big Haul in West
Oakland.
OAKLAND. May 5.â Detectives Hodg
kins and Shorey discovered a vacant
house in West Oakland to-day that had
been used as a storehouse for robbers.
The house was declared by the Health
Department to be unfit for habitation
some months ago. When the place was
visited a vast stock of boxes of crackers,
sugar, provisions, dozens of bottles of
whisky and beer and other provisions
was found.
In a house on Campbell street, between
Sixteenth and Seventeenth, where one of
the burglars lived, was found a lot of
furniture, bedding and apparel, most of
which had been taken from houses while
the tenants were absent. All the prop
erty was taken to the Police Station, anl
already much of it has been identified by
people whose houses were robbed by
burglars. There is a wagon load still to
be identified. The robbers have not yet
been caught. _

COL. DIN BURNS
IS HOME AGAIN
Says He Feels Inclined to
Enlist With the War
Volunteers.
Mexico Is in Accord With the
United States in the
Battle.
It Is Believed That He Will Take a
Hand in Local Political
Affairs.
Colonel Dan M. Burns, who left here
last December to look after his mining
interests in Mexico, returned last night
and was greeted at the ferry landing by
many of his old time political adherents.
He appeared to have grown considerably
stouter during his absence, and in re
sponse to inquiries made by his friends
concerning his health replied that he
never felt better in his life. A carriage
was in waiting for him, and axter excus
ing himself to his friends he was driven
to his home on Octavia street.
"Business is steadily improving In Mex
ico," said he last night, "and all the
mines are panning out well and profitably.
The people are greatly interested over
the war, and every bit of news is eagerly
read and discussed. The sympathies of
the majority of the people of Mexico are
with the United States, and they expect
to hear of ereat and signal victories
both on land and sea. I understand that
reports have been circulated that the
Mexican people are not in hearty accord
with the United States. Such reports are
not true. The few Spaniards there are, of
course, in favor of their mother country,
but they do not amount to many. The
presence of the Spanish is unwelcome in
Mexico. You can rest assured that the
majority of the people of Mexico are In
hearty accord and sympathy with the
battle being made by the United States
"The reports of the great naval battle
won by Commodore Dewey were gladly
received by me. When I read them I
felt like enlisting, so as to take a hand
in the fight, and I am not certain that I
may not yet do so. lYtie American pluck
and courage were shown by Dewey and
his men. When they entered the harbor
of Manila they well knew that they had
to win or die. They took the chanceâ and
won. Such deeds arouse the fire of patri
otism in the hearts of every one. There
was every possibility of their vessels run
ning into the mones laid in the harbor.
That did not cause them to hesitate for a
moment. They ran the gantlet and vic
tory was theirs."
"What do you think of the local politi
cal situation?" was asked.
"I have not been paying any attention
to politics," he answered, "and since I
have been on my way home I have not
heard of anything but the war."
"Do you intend returning shortly to
your mines?"
"I will remain in the city until after the
first of the year." And the answer was
given in a manner that suggested that
Colonel Dan Burns will be mixed up in
the political fight next winter unless he
goes to the war.
FORTY MISSING
FROM THE VAULT
Chinese Certificates That Can
not Be Found and Are .
Probably Stolen.
It Will Be Six Months Before the
Exact Loss Can Be Dis
covered.
With reference to the article published
exclusively In The Call yesterday con
cerning the loss of several Chinese cer
tificates of registration from the Dig
vault of the Collector of Internal Rev
enue during the administration of O. M.
Welburn, P. T. M. \V aite and H. C. How
ard, the clerks appointed recently to in
dex the 48.000 certificates, said yesterday
that forty are missing. They will not be
able to ascertain whether these have been
stolen or mislaid until the whole work of
indexing has been finished. They know
that forty duplicates have been called
for and that they have been unable to
find them, but hope that when the work
of indexing shall have been completed
they will turn up.
There is no clew as to the persons who
are responsible for the loss of the valu
able documents, and in all probability
the culprits will never be discovered un
less some one of the number turns State
evidence and exposes his accomplices.
The indexing is going on at the rate of
5000 per month, and 20,000 have been in
dexed already. This leaves about 28,000 to
finish. In about six months' time the
number of certificates missing may be ac
curately determined.

HUNTINGTON A
POOR WITNESS
Very Little Information
Gained From His
T .
Lips.
Treats the Commissioners to
Repartee and Long Ex
planations.
Commissioner Hinton Â«nd the Rail
road Magnate Have a Merry
Game of Fence.
Collls P. Huntington treated the Rail
road Commissioners yesterday to one of
the cleverest exhibitions of swordsman
ship that has been seen In this city for
many years. The manner In which he
parried questions and guarded himself
from the sharp thrusts made at him by
the board led every one present to be
lieve that he alone could uphold this
State in a contest against the leading
fencing masters. Besides being a master
of telling all he knows about nothing and
nothing about what he knows, the vener
able president of the Southern Pacific Is
especially apt at repartee. Commissioner
Hinton's terse criticisms on the famous
Colton letters and the Railroad Com
pany's actions in the lobbies at Wash
ington and Sacramento would fluster the
witness for a moment, but the next In
stant lie would calmly and cleverly
smooth over any proceeding that threw
discredit on himself or on the corpora
tion of which lie is the shining head. As
on the previous days, Mr. Huntington's
memory was a blank, but he was pro
fuse in his willingness to assist the board
in their investigations.
After struggling through a report that
the commissioners called for the day pre
vious, the witness was asked what roads
were owned by the Southern Pacinc Com
pany and whether it was not a ract that
many In the possession of the company
,had been obtained after outside parties
had exhausted large amounts in building
and putting them in running order. Mr.
Huntington replied it was very likely.
GRIEF LED TO HIS DEATH.
Frank L Smith Fatallu Shoots Himself Beside His
Dead Wife's Body.
Grief, caused by the death of his wife yesterday morning, led Frank L.
Smith, a carpenter by occupation, living at 207 Carl street, to take his life.
Both bodies were removed to the Morgue, as Mrs. Smith died from periton
itis under rather peculiar circumstances, and an investigation will be made
by the Coroner.
About a week ago Mrs. Smith, who has worked in various laundries in
this city, was taken sick, and Dr. Starr was called in to attend her. All
efforts to relieve her suffering were in vain, and she died early yesterday
morning. The attending physician notified the Coroner's office, but Smith
was determined that the body of his -vile should not be taken from his
1 pine. He went from the house for the r urpose of finding a physician who
would sign a death certificate, but without avail.
He then went to Klrchner's grocery store, on the corner of TValler and
Cole streets, where he took a drink, and then returned to the room where
his wife lay dead. In a few minuses two shots were heard by those in
the vicinity, and when the door was forced in it was seen that Smith was
dead, he having shot himself with i srr.al" caliber revolver in the forehead
and fallen to the floor by the side of the bed that held his wife's body.
Captain Thompson, of the pirk police, discovered the two bodies, arrt
then notified the proper authorities. Tho couple had no children, and there
are no relatives on this coast so far as known. He was a mem
ber of tne A. O. U. W.. and apparently in good circumstances. Jt
is supposed that Mrs. Smith die;] from peritonitis, caused by self-per
formed criminal treatment, and it iÂ» not known whether or not the husband
was cognizant of the crime or participated in it.
None of the residents of that portion of the city seem to be acquainted
with the couple, as they are strangers in the city. They both appeared
to be industrious and everything in the house showed that they had been in
comparatively easy circumstances so far as money was concerned. A Coro
ner's investigation will be held for the purpose of determining the cause of
the death of Mrs. Smith.
THE SCENE OF THE TRAGEDY
As to what roads were thus acquired, the
witness" memory was at fault. He ex
plained that many roads in this State
were run with a loss, and after the own
ers found it so the Southern Pacinc was
able to obtain them.
Such inquiries as to what was a fair
cost of a roud and the price given for
some so obtained elicited vague answers.
He was questioned at length on this sub
ject, but would always entertain his hear
era with a long tale of what he had done
in trying to interest rich men into taking
stock and the hard work he did to further
the progress of this State.
"What is the present commercial value
of the Southern Pacinc road?" asked
Chairman La Rue.
"I can't tell you; I believe It has a suffi
cient value, both present ana orr>spec
tive."
"How much money has gone into it?"
"I can't say. Money has been put into
it for forty years, and almost every work
ing day during the last thirty years. The
only way to tind out what a road costs
ana its actual worth would be to put it
on auction, and the man who bids will
give you its worth; no living person can
tell otherwise."
Another means given by Mr. Hunting
ton to ascertain the value of the road was
to take the roads of the world, find their
cost and then make an estimate. He did
not think that roads built during the past
year should be used In comparison.
The aged witness became tired with the
constant questioning about values and
said: "You are asking me questions that
no man in the world can answer." Com
missioner Hinton in trying to soothe him
told him that he believed he was honestly
trying to answer. He then quoted some
thing that Huntington had said on a
previous occasion. The pent-up feelings
of the witness gave way again, and he
pointedly replied that Hinton must have
seen some of his friends â Sutro and Bas
sett. Hinton Indignantly replied that he
had not, but that the question was put
to him just as it was asked by Senator
Morgan in the examination before the
Senate committee.
Before hostilities could commence Chair
man La Rue asked the witness whether
there were any books or data by which
the value of the road could be ascer
tained, and the witness in his nervous
ness said: "I don't think there is; I
don't think there is."
Mr. Huntington said that its present
value could only be got by comparison
with other roads, but did not thing a
comparison with the roads that have just
been constructed parallel with his road
would be a fair one.
Mr. Hinton read another question from
the report of the examination of the* wit
ness before the Senate committee and the
witness facetiously remarked that Mr. Su
tro had a full file of such Literature in hi 3
library. The Commissioner could not see
the jest, but sharply reminded the mag
nate that Mr. Sutro should not be intro
duced in the proceedings, as the poor man
was lying at death's door. The witness
was not ruffled in the least, and when
the Commissioner sprung another ques
tion from the report and asked an expla
nation he could not remember whether he
had testified in such terse language.
Mr. Hinton took another shot at the i
magnate by saying that he did not think
the language was as terse as his letters
to Mr. Colton, adding that he might read
THE SAIST FRANCISCO CAIX, FBIDAY, MAT 6, 1898.
them to him before the examination was
concluded.
The remainder of the afternoon was de
voted to interesting repartee between Mr.
Huntington and Commissioner Hinton,
which made Samuel Braunhart laugh In
glee. Tho witness was voluble in answer
ing the many hundred questions asked
him, but very little valuable information
was gained.
The Commissioners will try again to
day.

CLAIMS HE IS
NOT A FORGER
Arthur Klein Visits Police
Headquarters and Denies
the Charge.
Pictures the Lifo Lod With the
WÂ«llÂ«oo Woman Â«nd lis
Result.
Arthur H. Klein, characterized falsely,
as he claims, the cleverest forger In local
or Eastern fields, appeared at the City
Prison yesterday morning exhibiting
every Indication of violent agitation and
tfluntly asking the destt sergeant If that
gentleman wanted him. The officer in
charge Informed him that the house was
full, but if he wouid leave his address an
agent of the prison might call later to let
him know If they wanted his company.
"I live at 15V4 Powell street." said
Klein, "and if you fellows want me you
can alwa\s find me at the above ad
dress."
This dialogue was the outcome of a
charge made by Beatrice Wallace, alias
Hopkins, against Klein on an alleged con
fession made by him of forgery commit
ted in the Eastâ he having signed his
father's signature to a document, so she
claims, which compelled him to flee to
this coast to e-ude the hounds of justice.
All this, and, in fact, every allegation
of crime made against him by the Hop
kins woman. Klein denies, but admits,
however, that in a spirit of banter, in or
der to frighten her, he had told her that
he had committed forgery and that un
less she kept me fact a profound secret
i he would be sent Dack to Allegheny and
compelled to suffer the punishment for
his crime. â , .
This she evidently failed to do either
through the utter impossibility of keeping
a secret or an Innate aversion to practi
cal jokes.
Klein, in defense of his honor, his repu
tation and his self-respect, claims that
Beatrice has been the cause of his fall
from the pedestal of virtue to that of dis
grace and calumny; ana in view of this
fact he feels it his bounden duty to clear
himself of the base charees made by his
arch tempter b-" divulging her true char
acter to the entire English speaking
world.
"Miss Hopkins says I tried to commit
suicide by cutting my throat- with a 'corn
razor' in' the dead of night, but the shoe
fits entirely the other way. It was she
who tried to sap my young life blood
with the ragged edge of the corn exter
minator.
"One morning after a particularly
stormy night she approached me with the
blood curdling confession that she had
that very same jaggei. razor under her
pillow and that if I had accidently fallen
asleep during the course of the preceding
night she would have severed my jugular
beyond repair. She also stated at the
time that if 1 was ever seen in company
with another woman she would repay me
for my infidelity by murdering both of us.
"The public doesn t know," he contin
ued, "the torments that I suffered since
I first met Beatrice. At the time 1 en
countered her bewitching eyes and first
saw her beautiful tresses and the
exriulsite lines of her abbreviated figure I
did not know what it was to deviate from
the strict lines of virtue and propriety,
and I had in ray possession a good stock
of worldly goods, consisting of $500 In
cash, two rings of more than ordinary
value, a diamond pin and nine suits of
clothes. These possessions have slipped
like a 6rr>- oi mercury from under my
fingers into the hands of Beatrice and I
have nothing to show for them but the
cold immobile countenance of a woman
whom I once loved.
"I showed her - good time." continued
Klein with a sig. "and what it was to
live in the true sense oi the word, and she
has repaid the experience by robbing me
of my money and jewelry and going back
on him whom she called her only Arthur.
'Tootsie Wootsle' and various other pet
but insincere appellations to inspire him
with an untold liberality.
"To show her real temner and create a
feeling of awe within my breast she took
a carving knife and deliberately sliced
the crowns of the three best hats in my
possession â one of them a silk hat of fine
texture and better price; and ripped my
trousers in twain, casting one section in
my face and the other out of the window
where it descended like a lifeless limb
that had been lopped off the trunk of
seme unfortunate being by some frenzied
demon.
"When I was president of the American
Advertising Company I received $40 to
write a song which was also hypnotized
into the possession of the unscrupulous
and 'bogus' Beatrice before I had time to
take a second look at It.
"This is fate, sad fate," concluded
Klein, "to fall in love with a lunatic who
takes your money, cuts the roof from
your hats and pnes about the silent and
quiet hours of the nierht with a Jagged
corn razor in search of your windpipe."
The very interesting story of the
practical value of the new Oakland
Training School for Children is told

ADOLPH SUTRO
FORCIBLY TOKEN
FROM HIS HOME
h|is Legal Guardian, Mrs.
Merritt, Tool^ H im to
Her Residence.
Removed Despite the
Protests of One of
His Daughters.
Tried to Wreck the Am
bulance That Was to
Carry Him Away.
Miss Clara Sutro Adopts Despe
rate Measures to Keep Her
Father With Her.
A SCENE AT THE HEIGHTS.
The Ouardlan Claims She Wants
Her Charge Near Her to Give
Him Better Care.
Adolph Sutro, ex-Mayor and capital
ist, who was a few weeks ago declared
incompetent to manage his own affairs
by the courts, was taken from his home
at Sutro Heights yesterday by his
daughter and guardian, Mrs. Emma
Sutro-Merritt. His removal was some
what in the nature of an abduction and
it grew out of a family quarrel. The
leave taking of the aged millionaire
from the home he loved so well had ar.
exceedingly exciting and dramatic
tinge, and it deepened the hatred the
members of his family have formed for
each other during the past few months.
Sutro for weeks has been an invalid,
and during the last month or two he
has been unconscious to his surround
ings. His daughter. Miss Clara Sutro,
and his son Charles have been in al
most constant attendance on him. Yes
terday forenoon the daughter was at
his bedside attending to his wants
when the wheels of a carriage grated
over the gravelly driveway leading to
the door of the quaint residence on the
cliffs, and Mrs. Emma Sutro-Merritt
announced that she had called to take
her father away to her home on Sut
ter street and Van Ness avenue. Op
posite the door was an ambulance and
behind Mrs. Merritt were two burly
men ready to carry out her orders.
Mrs. Merritt announced her mission
in a haughty way and pushed past her
sister and beckoned the ambulance
men to follow. In vain Miss r*lara Sutro
protested. She begged and pleaded with
her sister to allow her father to remain
in the home he built and beautified and
loved so much, but Mrs. Merritt was
obdurate. The two burly ambulance
drivers lifted the old, weak and child
ish man in their arms and carried him
to the waiting ambulance. The aged
millionaire, unconscious of what was
going on, prattled on to the men who
were carrying him and seemed oblivious
that he was being taken from his home
for perhaps the last time.
The ambulance men set their burden
down in the doorway while they pre
pared the wagon for him. After the
horses had been turned heading toward
the gateway the men returned for the
aged capitalist. They carried him down
the stairway in spite of the pleadings
of Miss Sutro.
They were about to lift him into the
ambulance through the doorway that
opened In the rear of the wagon, when
MisÃ Sutro grasped the whip from the
seat of the conveyance and gave the
horses a stinging cut that started them
at a gallop across the yard. She hoped
to wreck the ambulance and so thwart
the designs of her sister and the guar
dian of her father until she could sum
mon assistance from her brothers and
so keep the declining philanthropist at
his home until the end of the few days
he has left on earth.
Away the horses went down the
driveway, overturning the statuary
that peeps from the shrubbery and
â¢which has made the Sutro Heights of
world-wide fame. The horses, however,
trained to drag an ambulance and to
avoid obstacles with the vehicle be
hind them made a poor runaway. They
circled around the grounds a few times
and came to a standstill In the main
driveway without doing much damage
to the rig. There their drivers caught
them and soon !iad them at the door
of the residence again. In the am
bulance the feeble old man was placed
and he was soon on the way to the resi
dence of Mrs. Dr. Merritt at the corner
of Van Ness avenue and Sutter street.
The reasons alleged by Mrs. Dr. Mer
ritt for wishing to place her father in
her own house are that by so doing she
will be better able to watch over him
and give him such medical care and
attention as his condition warrants.
She claims that as his legai guardian
she has a perfect right to l.iake such
disposition of his person as may seem
to her best, provided that her desires in
this matter do not run contrary to any
established social or legal requirements.
She asserts that her rights in the prem
ises are those of a parent over a child.
There are others who profess to be
lieve that Mrs. Dr. Merrltt's motives
for wishing to remove her father from
his place of asylum at Sutro Heights
contemplate something more than a
wish to insure his physical comfort.
These persons say that the ill-feeling
that is known to have existed for some
time between the two sisters has had
the effect of inspiring a fear in the
mind of Mrs. Merritt that if left in the
care of her sister her father might, in
his present enfeebled state of mind, be
induced to subscribe his name to some
document whereby all or a part of his
estate would be deeded or willed to
those who are antagonistic to Mrs.
""hUe It is true that such a document
would be of little or no value If it was
proven to be executed at a time when
the aged millionaire was known to be
mentally unsound, yet if the paper
ante-dated this period of mental inca
pacity It would be an exceedingly diffi
cult matter to prove that it had been
executed at any time other than that
shown on its face.
For these reasons, as well as for
those piven by Mrs. Merrltt, it might be
considered a wise thing to get the aged
capitalist ( it of harm's way. Not even
Mrs. Merritt will admit that since her
father's mental prostration he has had
anything but the most careful attention
and the best medical treatment. Sutro
Heights is supposed to be a most
healthful spot, and the nurses provided
for the invalid were the best that could
be procured. These things being con
sidered, it Is not too much to say that
the events of yesterday were set on
foot by more potent reasons than those
alleged by Mrs. Merritt and her
brother. It remains to be seen whether
their acts will be met by any counter
move on the part of the children who
are opposed to them in the matter of
the custody of their father.
The immediate outcome of yester
day's happenings at Sutro Heights will
probably be the institution of a pro-
EX-MAYOR ADOLPH SUTRO.
The aged millionaire was yesterday forci
bly taken from the home he built and
loved so well by his guardian and
daughter.
ceeding in court to-day, having for Its
purpose the release of Miss Clara Sutro
and perhaps her brother 'rom the bond
of Mrs. Merritt as trustee of her
father's estate. It Is probable that the
court will be petitioned to appoint a
new guardian and trustee, and if so
the allegations that will be made in
support of the petition will no doubt
enumerate all of the causes that have
led to the division of the Sutro family
against itself. When the family skele
ton, if there be one, is haled into court
there will be a rattling of dry bones
that may not prove uninteresting to
those who are interested in the fortunes
of the stricken capitalist.
Edgar E. Sutro, a son of the ex-
Mayor, left a sick bed last night for the
purpose of refuting the story that his
father had been kidnaped. He stated
that he had seen him at 1 o'clock at his
sister's home, looking contented and
enjoyed the best of health. He knew
of his removal from the Heights and
said It was done for the purpose of giv
ing him the best of care, which could
not be given him out there. He said
the kidnaping story had been circu
lated by disappointed parties and
thought it outrageous.
When told that a story was in circu
lation that Mr. Sutro was kidnaped he
ridiculed the idea.
"If he had been, do you think I would
stay in bed and not make an effort to
find him?, The fact is, he is at my sis
ter's home."
In order not to be misunderstood Mr.
Sutro wrote and signed the following
statement:
"I deny that my father "was kidnap
ed, but he was removed from Su
tro Heights to Dr. Merrltt's residence,
northwest corner of Sutter street
and Van Kess avenue, she thinking
that he could be better cared for in her
own home. EDGAR E. SUTRO."

SUICIDE OF
AN AGED MAN
William Thackeray, Pressed by
Creditors, Becomes De-
spondent.
He Was Librarian for the Odd Fellows
and Had Belonged to the Order
for Thirty Years.
William Thackeray, until recently
librarian of the Odd Fellows' Library,
killed himself last Wednesday night by
asphyxiating himself with illuminating
gas.
Thackeray had been for a long time de
pendent for support upon his salary as
librarian, and when he was informed that
the library was about to be sold he pur
chased a lot of furniture from Koonan &
Co., dealers on Mission street, on the in
stallment plan, and fitted up a lodging
house at 740 Ellis street. He employed
Mrs. E. N. Kulston as housekeeper, but
the business did not pay, and he was un
able to meet his installments as they fell
due His creditors pressed him for trie
money and he became very despondent.
Last 'Wednesday Mrs. Ralston went to
Noona-n & Co. and asked for an extension
of time, but she reported that they had
refused to grant it, but instead threatened
that if Thackeray did not pay up the in
stallment due to-diiy they would take the
furniture from the house.
This preyed upon the mind of the unfor
tunate man and he became very despond
ent. When he retired on Wednesday night
he went into a room other than the one
usually occupied by him and took off the
tip from the Kfis burner. Then he turned
on the pas and waited for the stupefac
tion which precedes death from asphyx
iation. His body was found yesterday
morning at half-past 7 o'clock.
The deceased was a native of England,
62 years of age, and was a distant rela
tive of the celebrated satirist, William
Mnkopoace Thackeray. He had been an
Odd Fellow of thirty years' standing and
had a host of friepds who would have
rallied to his aid had they known of his
distress.
The remains have been taken charge
of by the Coroner preliminary to the in
quest, but they will be interred by the
Odd Fellows.

(Signed)
JAMES H. BUDD, Governor.
JAMES D. PHELAN, Mayor.
MRS. W. B. HARRINGTON,
President Red Cross Society.
MRS. JOHN F. MERRILL,
Chairman Ladies Executive
Committee.
The affairs of the Red Cross Society
are rapidly shaping themselves so as
to insure success. At a meeting of the
executive committee held last evening
at the California Hotel a resolution
made by Rabbi Voorsanger, and sec
onded by W. J. Dutton, was carried
unanimously â "That the millionaires
of San Francisco be disregarded and an
appeal be made through the press to
the people for 50-cent contributions,
any one subscribing $1 to be enrolled as
a member of the Red Cross Society.
In support of his resolution Rabbi
Voorsanger spoke with eloquent sim
plicity.
"We are organized for two things,"
he said; "as an auxiliary to the Na
tional Red Cross and as citizens of Cal
ifornia to strengthen the hands of the
Sanitary Corps of the National Guard
of our State. There's a call from
Washington now, and our boys are al
ready in camp. The very moment raw
recruits go to camp is the time to look
after them. Nine thousand dollars is
needed to put these men on a war foot-
Ing. The surgeon-general is responsi
ble for the figures. Governor Budd in
dorses them. The Governor told me
personally that there was no fund at
his command to supply the needs of
these brave boys of ours. New York
has already raised half a million for
her sons. It would be a disgrace if Cal
ifornia could not in forty-eight hours
raise $9000. I am confident the thing
can be done."
On motion of Charles R. Bishop, sec
onded by Father Wyman, it was unani
mously decided to "accept the very
j generous offer of Mr. Claus Spreckels
I of rooms in the Claus Spreckels build
: ing, corner of Third and Market
streets, for headquarters of the Red
Cross Society."
Secretary Hansen asked the commit
tee to authorize his acceptance of an
offer made by a wealthy gentleman of
San Francisco, who desires for the
; present to withhold his name, of a
1 corps of from six to ten completely
equipped trained male nurses, outfitted
in camp uniforms, to be sent to the
Philippines with the California troops
under the auspices of the Red Cross
Society of California â all expenses to be
paid by the anonymous benefactor.
"This Is a magnificent donation," said
Dr. Voorsanger. "I move it be accept
ei with heartiest thanks."
The motion was carried unanimously.
The name of Sam :el Knight was added
to the committee on constitution and
by-laws.
"The simpler our rules and regula
tions the better," said Mr. Knight. "Let
us not get entangled in a mesh of by
la-.vs. The same rules of general guid
ance that serve the national organiza
tion will serve us. Let us get along with
as few rules as possible."
Wendell Easton and Colonel Smed
herg were added to the committee on
entertainment. R. H. Webster's name
was added to the committee on schools.
Dr. W. E. Hopkins, surgeon general of
California, was made a committee on
purchasing. A resolution authorizing
the treasurer, William Alvord. of the
Bank of California, to disburse funds
only on warrants drawn by the presi
dent and secretary was passed.
The committee adjourned to meet on
Saturday evening. May 7. at 8 o'clock,
at the Red Cross Society's headquar
ters, rooms 204-5-6-7 second floor Claus
Spreckels building.
BADLY BATTERED.
Henri Jannaud Wants Edward Bitter
and Louis Dutilleul Arrested.
Henri Jannaud, 9 Carlos place, swore to
a complaint in Judge Low's court yester
day for the arrest of Edward Bitter and
Louis Dutilleul on a charge of battery.
Jannaud stated that Dutilleul had rep
resented to him that he was a detective
and told him that he knew who really
murdered Mrs. Clute. He said It was not
Hoff but Bitter, and he would at the
proper time prove it.
Bitter and Dutilleul called at his house
Wednesday night and without saying v
word to him commenced to thrash him.
He was knocked down by a blow from
some blunt instrument and then he w;is
beaten over the head until he became un
conscious.

Because of this, Architect Swain
spent three hours on the anxious seat
in the witness-room connected with
the apartments occupied by the Grand
Jury at the City Hall yesterday after
noon. He had been served with a sum
mons to appear before that body to
explain his connection with changes in
plans and specifications and the sub
stitution of poor material for good, by
means of -which certain favored con
tractors were enabled to reap enor
mous and illegitimate profits from
their work on the ferry building. The
gTand jurors were desirous, however,
of ascertaining a definite knowledge of
the situation before subjecting Mr.
Swain to the grilling process, so he was
of necessity compelled to console him
self with his thoughts while some half
score or more of witnesses were being
examined. His name had not yet been
called when the hour of adjournment
was announced.
Now that the Grand Jury has evinced
a desire to probe to the bottom the
corruption that has marked the prog-
ress of the construction work on the
ferry building since it has been in
charge of Commissioner Colnon and
Architect Swain, there is a great influ
ence being brought to bear to have the
whole matter sidetracked. In the
event that this course should not prove
successful an attempt will be made to
minimize the scope of the inquiry and
thus protect the men who are believed
to be responsible for the thievery that
has been practiced in so bare-faced a
manner for more than a year past.
This was made evident at the inquiry
yesterday by the questions asked some
of the witnesses by one or more of the
grand Jurors who had been primed in
advance with alleged facts tending to
discredit the testimony that it was
known could be given. It is also
known that the men who have been
growing rich at the expense of the
State by reason of their connection
with the work done on the harbor front
have, through the medium of influen
tial friends, been attempting to influ
ence the minds o-f members of the
Grand Jury. That this, attempt has
proved unsuccessful, except In one or
two instances, goes without saying. To
what ends these same men will go to
the end of procuring perjured testi
mony or the concealment of records re
mains to be seen.
Among the witnesses examined yes
terday was Chief Plumbing Inspector
Sullivan of the Board of Health. Some
weeks ago he inspected the plumbing
work in the ferry building and pro
nounced it practically worthless. He
said that it was so defective in the
matter of material used and the man
ner in which the work was done that
it constituted as . a whole a positive
detriment to the building and a menace
to public health. Since that time Sul
livan has had many conferences with
the water front officials, as well as with
the contractor who installed the plumb
ing system. The plumbing con
tractor even went so far as to threaten
Sullivan if he did not approve of the
work as constructed/What effect these
conferences and threats may have had
is not known, but it is certain that in
giving his testimony yesterday Sulli
van was mildly lenient in his discus
sion of the work he had before charac
terized as a cheat and a sham.
There were other witnesses who gave
the members of the Grand Jury a cor
rect idea of the manner, in which the
plumbing contractor was permitted by
the officials who had charge of the work
to swindle the State. Among them was
Thomas Ford, a plumbing expert, who
had made a complete and detailed ex
amination of the plumbing work in the
ferry building. He explained to the
Jury how, the system had been changed
by juggling the iron pipes and that by
reason of this chan â the contractor
was enabled to veap a very considerable
profit at the expense of the State. The
witness also detailed the manner in
which the contractor had reaped rich
profits by reason of other changes au
thorized by Architect Swain and ap
proved by Commissioner Colnon. He
also told how the law had been evaded
in regard to the manner in which vent
pipes and other vital portions of the
plumbing system had been constructed.
Howard C. Holmes, chief engineer for
the Harbor Commission,- was one of the
witnesses z examined during the course
of the afternoon. He was asked re
garding changes in plans and specifi
cations â¢ authorized by ' Architect Swain
and Commissioner Colnon, but was un
able to throw any light on the : subject
except to say that he knew that many
such changes had been authorized and
that in some instances the contractor
had been required to reduce the amount
of his contract and in â¢ others the con
tractor had been paid considerable
sums " in i addition to the amount speci
fied in his contract. Whether or not the
rebates were : too small and ' the addi
tions too large he was unable to state,
as his duties did not compel him to
have anything to do with the supervis
ion of the construction work on the
building. He said that in his opinion
the Harbor Commission had . paid ; Con
tractor Cronan a sum approximating
$3000 over and above l the original': con
tracti price for work that : was included
in the original contract. Also that Cro
nan had i been permitted to perform the
work lin a manner contrary to the pro
visions of the contract, the finished
work being much : inferior; in point of
strength, durability - and ': cost to ? what
it would haye = been had the work been
done according to the provisions of the
contract. :' ; . ; â¢.â¢â _â¢â  . â .â  c: ..,/.-.
The Grand Jury also ; devoted con
siderable time during the session to go
ing into the details,- concerning the
manner ;in which the ; contracts â  for
stone and terra cotta : work ? have \ been
manipulated. Among the witnesses ex
amined on this particular subject were
P. McG. % McÃean, >J., W. McKay J and

NATIONAL AIRS
AT THE SYMPHONY
Scheel Plays "The Star-Span
gled Banner" While
Women Stand.
Season Closes With a Good Pro
gramme and a Snug Balance
in the Treasury.
The symphony season at the Tivoli
closed yesterday afternoon with a fine
programme proper and a triumphant
flourish of interpolated patriotism. Mr.
Scheel not only played Weber's "Jubel"
overture, which closes with the hymn
that we Americans call "America," but
"The Star-spangled Banner" as well. He
played it first in its original form and
then as done into a quick march by
George Theile, embroidered and counter
shot with snatches of "Yankee Doodle"
and "Dixie." The audience, a very large
one, stood up to the last woman and re
mained standing while the patriotic tunes
were being played. "The Star-spangled
Banner" is good music at any time, and
Scheel played it like an American; but
Mr. Theile's Sousaesque version of it has
no place on a symphony programme, and
in conditions other than the present would
be an affront to the symphony subscri
bers. As it was, there seemed something
yellowly sensational in dragging it in
where a repetition of tne good old simple
tune undiluted would have serveu so
much better.
However, the general programme was
beyond cavil, and the work of the band
was surer, evener and more finished than !
at any other concert of the season. Ber
lioz's* "Harold in Italy" symphony, a
work unique in the theatrical literature
of the orchestra, was played with sur
passing dramatic power. Jf the worth of i
Bernat Jaulus as a viola player had not j
been established by earlier performances j
in chamber concerts he would have iin
ished the solo viola part yesterday to find j
himself immediately famous. He played
the part, which is supposed to represent
Harold, with a rare tone, musicianly poise j
and a certain Byronic blend uf despair
I and devilment that were cumulatively
splendid.
For all his masterly instrumentation j
and color sense. Berlioz, in this work at '
least, does not touch the emotions as they j
are touched by Tschaikowsky's "Pa- j
thetique" or Beethoven's C Minor. His aa- t
peal is more theatrical, more sensuous, >
than theirs, and as he insists on "pro
gramme music" and relates rather .than I
reflects, it may be that his touch is more '
vivid. But he is neuner as terrible as j
Tschaikowsky nor as supprhumanly hu- [
man as Beethoven. After a fasblon he is j
Ito them what Sardou is to Ibsen and j
Shakespr-are. It would be impossible to i
overpraise Scheel's management of the
orchestra in this difficult work.
The Tschaikowsky serenade, too. was
beautifully taken, its contrasts in som
berness and almost mppancy being finely
marked; and the "Kaiser March," by
i Wagner, was played with just the right
sonorous pomp.
The music public is indebted to Mr.
Scheel and the Symphony Society for the
i only first class season of music ever heard
i in San Francisco, a not inconsiderable
item of which season is that :t has been I
a big success financially as well as artis- |
tically. There' is a snug little balance of i
$3fioo on hand, and hundreds of ready sub
scribers to insure the second series, which
commences in the fall.

Claims to Bo a Local Newspaper
Correspondent and Circulates
Bogus Drafts Broadcast
William Ijodtmann, who recently con
tributed several articles to local papers,
has proved without a chance for contra
diction that a black sheep has worKed
his way into the newspaper world. After
he left this city he made his way north
and thence East, and during his trip has
more than made his expenses in a ques

According to complaints made from
various sources, Lodtmann is at present

The Call, and In a plausible way relates
a tale of financial embarrassment for the

story and produces letters and papers
which seem to bear out his explanations.
Money is asked for, a draft griven on the
cashier of the paper and the trick is done.
The last victim heard from is the firm of
Brown, Page and Hillman Company of
Peoria, 111., who arc losers to the extent

The goods have since been returned to

STREET RAILWAY SUED.
A Wagon Damaged and a Transfer
Befused Are the Causes. .
Two suits were begun in the Justice
Court yesterday against the Market
street Railway Company. Willie Davis
asks for $299 damages for a broken wagon
wheel, caused by collision with a car of
the company at the crossing of Sixth and
Mission streets on March 22.
William O'Banion claims to have been
damaged to the amount of $200 by the re
fusal of a conductor of the line running
to the ferry to accept a transfer given
out at the corner of Kearny and Broad
way.
EDNA CAN NOW
MARRY AGAIN
Judge Hebbard Returns Mrs.
Hopper to Single Bless
edness.
Rumor Has It That Tod SloÂ«n la to
Be Accepted to Fill the
Blank.
Judge Hebbard granted a divorce yes
terday to Edna Wallace Hopper from her
husband, William DeWolf Hopper, on the
ground of desertion. With this decree
comes a revival of the story that Kdna
will soon become the wife of the famous
jockey, Tod Sloan. It is given out on
the authority of no 1-ss a personage than
Sloan's valet that the hurried departure
of the jockey to tht; East was for thu
purpose of being with Mrs. Hopper wnen
the courts decided in her favor.
The following telegram, received by Tha
Call last night, would indicate that Edna
was sure of her c;. -
NEW YORK. May s.â Edna Wallaca
Hopper denies that she seeks a reconcili
ation with hor husband, DeWolf Hopper,
the comedian.
"The fact is," said Mrs. Hopper last
night, "I expect and hope to secure my
divorce within the next two weeks. I
trust that he and I will always be good
friends, simply because 1 dislike being
an enemy to anyone. But our relations in
future will never go friendship,
believe me."
When asked what she thought of the
possibility of her husband making Mlsa
Bergen his wife, she answered: "1 should
not be surprised. At the same time, I
do not care to pass upon the advisability
of any of Mr. Hopper's actions. If he
and Miss Bergen are to be happy, well
and good. Mr. Hopper deserves some
domestic bliss anyhow. His courage in
taking unto himself three wives merits
reward."
Mrs. Hopper denied that she had named
Miss Bergen as co-respondent in her di
vorce case. "I don't want to talk about
Miss Bergen," she said. "The laws of
the State of California permit me to ob
tain a divorce on the ground of desertion.
I am taking advantage of that fact,"
A Thieving Chinese.
Tee Kee, a Chinese lottery ticket agent,
was arrested yesterday by Detectives
Gibson and Wren on a charge of grand
larceny. On April 12 he called at the res
idence of Mrs. M. A. Sherwood, 845 Tina
street, and wanted to sell lottery tickets.
He got into the dining room and after he
left Mrs. Sherwood missed a gold watch
studded with diamonds and a gold pin.
The police were notified and Gibson and
Wren recovered the watch and arrested
the Chinese. When searched a pawn
ticket for the watch waa found in his
pocket.
