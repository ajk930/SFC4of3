MANILA, June 13, via Hong
kong, June 17. â The rebels are
gradually closing in around Man
ila. Yesterday they took Mala
bona, and are now in Tondo, a
northwest suburb, where a great
fire is now raging. The native
carabineros killed their officers
and deserted last night. A part
of a native regiment at Caloocan
also deserted, killing their Spanish
officers. A fierce attack on the
powder magazine at Malate was
made early this morning, but the
Spaniards kept the rebels out.
The insurgents are daily increas
ing in numbers. All the Span
iards, their sons and grandsons are
obliged to serve as volunteers. A
few of the garrisohs in the prov
inces still hold out.
The rebels are wearing out
Manila garrison, but 1 believe they
will delay the grand assault until
the arrival of the American troops.
When the rebels captured Gua
delupe they sent the patients in
the hospital into Manila. They
are treating the Spanish prisoners
well.
There was severe fighting in
the southern suburb to-day. The
Spaniards attach importance to
the arrival of the German flagship.
The relations between General
August! and the German Consul
are intimate. Nearly all the Eng
lish families will leave to-morrow
by the Yung Sang' for Hongkong.
AGREEMENT BETWEEN
DEWEY AND AGUINALDO.
By It the Insurgent Leader Promises
to Co-operate With American
Forces.
The San Francisco Call
correspondent of the Times gives the
text of a Berlin letter dated June 4. and
read in the Cortes on Thursday, pur
porting to be the text of an agreement
signed April 24 at Singapore between
Aguinaldo, the insurgent leader, and
SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY, JUNE 18, 1898.
MANILA, June 13, via Hongkong, June 17.â At a large con-
Gourse of rebel chiefs, held yesterday in Old Cavite, General
Aguinaldo proclaimed the Independence of the Philippines.

SIGNIFICANT THREAT
BY GERMAN OFFICERS
"Americans Will Never Annex the Phil
ippines While William Remains
Emperor."
MANILA, June 6 (via Hongkong, June 17). â There is a story current here this evening to the effect that the
captain and officers of the German warship Irene went to a picnic on horseback to the further outpost of San
Juan, accompanied by the highest Spanish staff officers.
They had a champagne luncheon, and the captain of the Irene is said to have made a speech,
during which he declared the Americans " Will never annex the Philippine Islands while William
remains Emperor.*'
The Germans, it is further said, with their Spanish hosts, might have been killed by the insurgents, who had
the road to San Juan strongly ambushed, but it is further asserted the insurgents had orders to avoid giving a pre
text for German intervention.
Finally, it is said, the Germans proposed to remove the wounded Spanish soldiers to a hospital sh'p under
the German flag, but Admiral Dewey is reported to have replied that hitherto mediation had always been British,
and it must remain so.

HAVANA. June 17.â The German
Vice-Consul at Cienfuegos gave a ban

tel in that city to the commander and
other officers of the German cruiser
Gieir. Colonel Rios of the Spanish ar
tillery, who was brought up in Ger

was great cordiality during the ban

iards. While the feasting was going on
the band of the Alfonso XIII played at
the door of the hotel. Several of the
Gieir's crew received special attention
from the Spaniards and were treated to
beer and cigars, which pleased them
greatly. The Germans and Spaniards
understood each other perfectly, all
speaking French. The Gieir's comman

the latter returned the call. The cruiser
is expected to-day at Havana.

ADMITS DISTRESS.
MADRID, June 17. â The follj^ving dispatch from Manila signed
by Captain General Augiisti and dated June I' is published officially:
. "The grave situation set forth in my dispatch of June 8 continues.
The troops are fighting on the line of blockhouses which stops the
enemy's advance. The enemy has been strengthened by desertions of the
native troops, which diminish our means of resistance and ma^ compel
me to take refuge within the walled city.
"Communication with the provinces is still cut off. and I do not know
whether the detachments there will be able to hold out against a lack of
resources. I hope to receive assistance from the peninsula before our
means of defense are exhausted."

DE CUBA, June 16, via Port Antonio.
Jamaica, June 17.â The operations by
the Spaniards in the way of strength
ening fortification: indicate that they
expect the American forces to effect a
landing to the eastward of Santiago
de Cuba.
They will probably be disappointed.
The indications are that the landing:
will be made to the westward. There
are good approaches in that direction,
and with a north wind the disembarka
tion of the troops would not be difficult.
The landing will not be delayed long
after the arrival of the transports.2
TOWNS AND
PRISONERS TAKEN

BY JOSEPH L. STICKNEY.
MANILA, June 11 (via Hongkong, June 17).
The rebel troops, who, as I mentioned In my
last dispatch, were besieging the old Cavite
church, kept the Spanish garrisons closely
surrounded, but could make little impression
on the solid stone walls. The insurgent bat
tery across the bay had no fuses for the
shells and their powder was bad, conse
quently the Spaniards had not much fear of
their guns. â¦
Not till the Krupp field pieces were so
placed as to make sure of breaching the
walls did the lieutenant colonel commanding
surrender on June 9, after having held out
nine days. The rebels captured here 250
men and 270 Mauser rifles. This closed the
campaign in the Cavite province, there being
no more Spaniards left at large.
The whole insurgent force then
moved north to attack the Span
insh positions outside of Manila
City.
Continuous fighting has
been going on ever since, re
sulting in the rebels taking
the towns of Parneque and
Pasay on the coast.
Several towns on the north
east of Manila are now surround
ed by the insurgents, who press
the Spaniards hard, notwith
standing the latter's superiority
in artillery.
One day's lighting illustrates
all. Having taken Pasay, the
rebels debouched from the
swampy into the rolling country,
containing woods, a few modern
houses and an occasional stream.
Near the beach was a large pow
der magazine close to a well-built
stone batter}-.
The rebels made a rush at this
magazine at night, capturing
several prisoners, rifles and some
powder before the Spaniards
could rally to protect their posi
tion. In the morning the rebels
deployed in the woods south of
the magazine, opened a hot fire
on the Spaniards, using the same
tactics as they had done in all
previous actions I have wit
nessed. From my position in
the rear I could see the rebel ad
vance line crouching behind
cover while the Spaniards poured
a continuous fire of small arms at
them.
The insurgents replied with
carefully aimed shots; then a
group of twenty or thirty would
make a rapid rush toward the
front, dropping under cover with
in fifty paces of their starting
point. The Spaniards soon be
gan firing shells from the field
guns, in the fort, but not much
damage was done.
When the rebels had massed
about 3000 men within easy
range of the magazine they lay
quiet, intending to make an as
sault that night, but fortunately
they discovered in time that the
Spaniards had mined a bruise
over which they must charge and
the assault was countermanded.
Aguinaldosays hedoes not
expect to make much more
progress until the United
States troops arrive. The
Spaniards have such great
superiority in artillery that
the insurgents cannot suc
ceed in an attack on the
walled fort in the city.
To guard against assault by
the rebels the small gunboat
Cebu has been placed so as to
command Puente de Espana,
across the river Pasig, which di
vides the city. A large number
of field guns has also been placed
around the city walls.
Aguinaldo says the Spaniards
have 35,000 troops in Manila.
My own information, obtained
from men in the field, who have
the best opportunity of observing
the enemy, places the number
under the Spanish flag at 7000,
of whom 2000 are volunteers,
who are useless as a fighting
force.
From very trustworthy sources
I have received the following
facts about the situation in Man
ila: Of the three principal bat
teries commanding the bay one
contains four 6-inch Krupp,
breech-loading rifles, thirty-four
muzzle loading guns, mostly use
less, and three rapid-fire rifles,
which are probably of 4.7
inches; the second battery con
tains three large muzzle loading
field guns, and the third battery
contains several old style
muzzle loaders and two machine
guns.
Nearly all the foreigners
have leFt Manila and are
quartered aboard the dozen
merchant steamers which
were caught in the passage
when the American squad
ron arrived.
Dewey allowed these vessels
to come out of anchorage and
anchor in the bay as a refuge for
the foreigner population. These
steameFs are ajl Spanish and will
be prizes when Dewey is ready
to take possession of Manila.
In the early part of the week
| the small steamer Vulcan, about
j 200 tons, and to-day a similar
steamer, the Toaleno, came into
the bay from one of the other
1 islands flying the insurgent flag.
The latter brought about 300
', Spanish prisoners.
General Aguinaldo made ar
; rangements to hold a meeting of
native leaders yesterday to pre
pare a constitution for the pro
posed republic and organize a
government. Owing to the ab
sence of some persons who had
been expected at the conference
it did not take place.
The rebels are reported to
have captured the wife and
five children of Governor-
General Augusti. They will
not be held as prisoners, but
will be broughtto Manila and
allowed to join General Au
gusti.
The British gunboat Linnet
arrived from Iloilo yesterday. She
will take dispatches and mail to
Hongkong to-night.
The German flagship Kaiserin
Augusta arrived from Kiaochau
yesterday, so that now three Ger
man warships are here.
Two large fires broke out in
Manila this afternoon, apparently
in warehouses near the docks,
which have been burning two
hours. The rebels have control
of the city's water supply, but are
not going to cut it off for fear of a
general conflagration and disease
if the city should be deprived of
water.

MANILA, June 8 (via Hongkong,
June 17). â General Aguinaldo has ad
vanced steadily. Sunday, June 5, he
took Capote, Las Pinas and Paraneque,
all strong Spanish positions.
The rebels* even arrived within 100
yards of the powder magazine at Mal
ate.
The Spanish retreat from Paraneque
was disorderly, and in their flight only
just escaped being cut off by a flank
movement of the rebels. The Spanish
garrison at Capote surrendered, and the
garrisons throughout the province of
Cavite gave up the fight. t
The rebels have taken nearly 3000
prisoners, who are guarded in Cavite.
The city of Manila is quite surrounded
by rebels, and an attack is expected
hourly. The province is in the hands
of the rebels. It is renorted that Maca
bele, where the wife and family of the
Captain-General were guarded by na
tive volunteers and Spanish troops, has
surrendered. It is also reported that

WASHINGTON, June 17.â The State
Department received the following dis
patch from its agent at Gibraltar:
'â The Charles V.. Pelayo, Rapldo, Pa
triot, Audaz, Osada, Prosperina, Giral
da, Prelejo, Colon, with the Minister on
board; Alfonso Doce, Canadong, Anto
nio Lopez, Isla Panos, Buenos Ayres
and San Francisco left Cadiz yester
day. The first eleven passed the rock
bound for Carthagena for orders. The
last three have troops on board."
This is Admiral Camara's Cadiz
squadron, and appears to be in the
Mediterranean, bound for African
shores.
GIBRALTAR, June 17.â The Cadiz
fleet, which was sighted off Ceuta last
evening, passed here to-day, going
eastward. It consists of two battle^
ships, four cruisers and four torpedo
boat destroyers.
MADRID, June 17.â Admiral Cama
ra's fleet, said here to consist of over
twenty vessels, is reported to have
been divided at sea and to have pro
ceeded to different destinations.
There Js a feeling of great optimism
in official circles here and in the lob
bies of the Cortes, owing to the depar
ture of Admiral Camara's fleet. It is
said that :t has an enormous quantity
of war material on board, including a
mysterious new explosive.
There are a number of rumors in cir
culation here as to the destination of
the fleet. One has it that the Spanish
warships are now heading for Boston,
Mass., with the intention of bombafd
ing New England towns, and another
report sets fuTth that the Spanish re
serve fleet is going to the Philippine
Islands.
The Spanish newspapers say that
work is being actively continued on
fortifications in the Canary and Ba
learic Islands. The Liberal reiterates
the declaration that "if Spain has
nothing to hope for from the powers
ehe is able to defend herself."
the military party has obliged General
Augusti to resign and transfer the com
mand to Jandene, who was second in
command. The panic in Manila is Ken
eral. The Spanish families are entering
inside the walled city.
The Spanish troops who retired from
Paraneque are in bad condition, starving
and exhausted. All seems to be con-
fusion owing to bad management. No
American troops have arrived here.

VIZCAYA ISLANDS.
If Obliged to Capitulate at Manila
Augusti Intends to Remain

MADRID, June 17.â One of the high
Spanish Ministers in an interview to
day said :
"Aguinaldo, after breaking faith with
the Spaniards, Induced the uprising in
aid of the Americans by swearing that
the latter only came to liberate the
Philippine Islands and would support a
native republic. But when the natives
see through the trickery and Span
ish warships appear with re-enforce
ments there will be a reaction in favor
of Spain, because the natives, although
fickle, are still influenced by tht> friars,
who are only hated by the members of
the secret societies and not by the mass
of the natives.
"If Manila is obliged to capitulate the
seat of government will be transferred
to the Vizcaya Islands, General Au
gust! capitulating as* commanded o'
Manila and not as Governor -General of
the Philippines."
The Minister also denied that the
Spanish Government had any intention
pf ceding territory to Germany in ex
changed for any undefin Â»d assistance.
VERY CHUMMY WITH

LONDON, June 18.â The Hongkong
correspondent of the Daily Mail says:
The Archbishop at Manila, Monsignor
Nozaleda, announces that he has had
a communication from God, who has
promised him that the "Yankee pigs"
will be driven out of the island, and
that "Spain will be triumphant in the
end."
There is an idea in Manila that the
Germans have something up their
sleeve. On this point my correspondent
writes: "The Germans are disposed to
ADMIRAL DEWEY'S
LATEST REPORT.
WASHINGTON, June 17.â The Navy Department has received the
following from Admiral Dewey:
"Cavite, June 12, via Hongkong, June 17.â There is little change in
the situation since my telegram of June 3. JThe insurgents continue
hostilities and have practically surrounded Manila. They have taken
2500 Spanish prisoners, whom they treat most humanely. They do not
intend to take the city at the present time. Twelve merchant vessels
are anchored in the bay with refugees under guard of neutral men-of
war; this with my permission. The health of the squadron continues
excellent. The German comnaander-in-chief arrived to-day. Three Ger
man, two British, one French and one Japanese men-of-war are now
in port. Another German man-of-war is expected. The following is a
correct list of the Spanish vessels captured and destroyed:
"Destroyedâ Two- protected cruisers, five unprotected cruisers, one
transport and one serving vessel, both armed.
"The following were captured: The transport Manila and the gun
boat Callao."
Before the departure of the Spanish
warships a flag of honor, embroidered
by the ladies of Cadiz, was afesented
to the officers of the cruiser Carlos V.
It was a solemn ceremony.
Captain Aunon subsequently held a
council of war with the commanders of
all the ships of the squadron on board
the Pelayo. Captain Aunon, after the
departure of Admiral Camara, wired
the Premier the following:
"The reserve squadron and the troops
of the expeditionary corps, on leaving
Spanish waters, send greetings to the
Government and the fatherland and
affirm their desire to fight for them."
The Minister of Marine also tele
graphed to the Queen Regent enthusi
astic greetings from the squadron and
their determination to fight to the last
for the national honor.
It is announced that Captain Aunon,
after inspecting the arsenal at Car
thagena, will return to this city and or
ganize a third squadron of warships.
He sent a message to the Premier that
he was much satisfied with the condi
tion of the squadron of Admiral Ca
mara.
Premier Sagasta, it is said, hopes to
prorogue the Chamber of Deputies next
week.
Fresh contingents of troops are being
constantly called to the colors and
there is great activity In the War and
Navy departments. Work on the fort
ifications at the different ports of Spain
is being pushed and it is asserted a
third squadron of warships is to be
formed immediately, to be composed of
the Cardinal Clsneros, Lepanto, Al
fonso XIII and other cruisers. Cadiz
is to be the rendezvous of this squad
ron.
It Is the general opinion here that a
protracted war is ahead, and it Is semi
officially announced that the Govern
ment does not count upon the support
of any power, and that even Germany,
in spite of her great interests in the
Philippine Islands, will do nothing to
favor Spain.
be meddlesome here. Germans and
Spaniards axe very chummy, entertain
ing erne another at dinner parties and
walking arm In arm everywhere. There
Is no question about how the BrU sh
feel. They are watching the Germans
closely."
The Hongkong correspondent to the
Times says. According to Manilla ad
vices dutcu June 13 and broight here
by Her Majesty's ship Linnet, the reb
els have captured the family of Cap-
tain-General Augusti. In most cases
the desertions of the naval regiments
have been accompanied by a massacre
of the officers. It is reported from
Shanghai that the Spanish Archbishuo
from Mani.'a has arrived there with the
German Uuopship Darmstadt.
MANILA MAY HAVE
FALLEN BY THIS TIME.
It Is Believed Dewey Has Beached
an Understanding With the
Insurgent Leader.
WASHINGTON, June 17.â Dewey's
report of June 12 from Cavite was food
for a good deal of discussion to-day at
the Navy Department. Taken in con
nection with the press reports ft would
seem to indicate that Manila probably
has rWlen by this time. One phrase
used by the admiral, "that they do not
intend to take the city at the present
time," warrants the belief that he has
reached a perfect understanding with
the insurgent leader, and that the town
is not to be attacked until the Ameri
can troops arrive. For some reasons it
is extremely desirable that such should
be the case, and that Dewey should
receive the surrender of the town in
person rather than force the Spaniards
to surrender to insurgents and thereby
afford a possible pretext for the inter
ference of some of the European pow
ers, whose ships are gathering in sus
piciously large numbers in Manila Bay.
SPANISH ARTILLERYMEN
STAMPEDED FROM MALATE
Immense Consternation Caused, It
Being Believed the Insurgents
Were Attacking.
MANILA, June 6, via Hongkong, June
17.â During last night, owing to a mis-
understanding, a squad of Spanish ar
tillerymen stampeded from MaJate into
Manila, causing immense consternation,
it being believed that the insurgents
were storming the city.
A Spanish officer commanding an
outpost at San Juan left his men in
charge of a sergeant, earnÂ© to town and
was found helplessly drunk. It is re
ported that he was sentenced to death.
A six-Inch gun at Malate, while being
fired Into the wood* over the Span
iard*' heads, flred a shot which struck
a tree and killed several Spaniards.
AUGUST! RESIGNS
HIS MILITARY COMMAND.
Council of War Made Furious by the
General's Proposal to
Surrender.
MANILA, June 5 (via Hongkong,
June 17).â The captain general held a
council of war, at which it was pro
posed to surrender because " resistance
was clearly useless and a deplorable ex
penditure of blood and heroic* 1 efforts
were rendered futile by lack of train
ing. Insufficient supplies and the small
ness of the force."
The council was furious at this sug
gested "humiliation by mere natives,"
and Captain Genera! Augusti resigned
his military command, being succeeded
by his second in command, who coun
termanded the order for the withdrawal
of the troops from the field.
NO HARM DONE,
SAYS MADRID
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MADRID, June 17.â Advices received
here from Havana from official sources
characterize the fighting at Guanta
narao Bay as "mere skirmishing," with
the "net result that the Americans
have been able to ho 1 1 the place where
they landed." Continuing, the Havana
dispatch says:
"They have suffered greatly, both
from the fusillade and the heat. The
Spaniards are In possession of several
wells, none of which has been in
jured. The stories that the fortifica
tions at Caimanera and Morro have
been damaged are false."
The following official note has been
issued here: "The charges of Spanish
cruelty to the wounded and mutilation
of the dead are false. These accusa
tions have caused the liveliest indigna
tion among all classes in Spain, espe
cially among the troops, who are in
dignant at the calumnies. The Spanish
army is conducting itself in this war
with the nobility it has always shown,
as proved by the evidence of the Amer
ican prisoners who were released, and
its discipline is so strict that any mis
conduct would have been relentlessly
punished."
The following is a Spanish report
of the bombardment of Santiago dt>
Cuba:
"On June 16, at 5 a. m., fire was
opened on the coast batteries of San
tiago de Cuba by four American battle
ships, two ironclad cruisers and a pro
tected cjwiiser, while one yacnt opened
fire opposite Aguadores beach. The
cannonade was violent and fearful and
lasted one hour and a half. The Amer
icans fired over 1000 projectiles and
temporarily disabled the Hontoria can
non at La Socapa, covering them with
earth. The parapet was destroyed by
a shell. One cannon of Morro Castle
was damaged by the American projec
tiles. All the damages were repaired
to-day.
"The Americans suffered severe dam
age. Shells from the Spanish batteries
were clearly seen to fall on the Ameri
can ships, which were approximately
two miles off.
"The Spanish losses at Morro were
one artillery corporal killed and one
second lieutenant, Juan Arbela; also
eight soldiers and two sailors of the
watch service wounded. At the El So
capa battery two artillery sailors were
killed and Second Lieutenant Rikard
Brulsquita of the navy and two soldiers
wounded. The Spanish soldiers were
unharmed.
"General Linares eulogizes the be
havior of the troops and captain Gen
eral Blanco will reward several officers
and soldiers wounded to-day and in the
engagement of June 6. He will also
recommend for special reward Colonel
Ordonez of the artillery."
The Governor of oantiago de Cuba
has sent a cable dispatch to the Gov
ernment, describing the bombardment
of yesterday, in which he said:
"The Americans fired 1000 shots. Sev
eral Spanish shells hit the enemy's ves
sels. Our losses are three killed and
twenty-one wounded, including two
officers. The Spanish squadron was not.
damaged."

HAVANA, June 17.â Captain-General
Blanco has refused to entertain the
.proposition to exchange the Merrimac

Conflicting Rumors as to
the Destination of
the Fleet.
Oi}e Report Declares It Is Coming
to flttacK AtlaQtic Coast
Cities.
The cablegram received at the State Department
From its Consular agent at Gibraltar stating that
Spain's reserve squadron, consisting oF Fourteen war
vessels, had passed through the Straits of Gibraltar,
bound For Carthagena, was the subject oF much spec
ulation in naval circles this aFternoon. The state
ment made by the Consular agent that the Minister
oF Marine was aboard one oF the vessels and that
the squadron would stop at Carthagena For orders
created the impression here that this Fleet might not
be bound Further east than that city, although the re
port that Manila was the destination of Admiral
Camara was seriously considered by the war board.
The belieF seems to be general to-night that the dis
patch of the Spanish Fleet From Cadiz to Carthagena
is intended only to deceive the Spanish masses, who
are very much wrought up over the latest news From
Manila.
It was announced in a cablegram
from Madrid yesterday that upon re
of the news from Hongkong Pre
mier Sagasta was very much agitated
and endeavored to conceal the bad tid
ings even from his associates until after
he had imparted it to the Queen Re
gent and the Minister of Marine. It is
â¢â¢â ted that the fleet was immediately
through Gibraltar Straits to
create the impression among Spanish
people that an effort would be made to
regain the Philippines and thus avert a
crisis in the internal affairs of Spain.
But whether it is a ruse on the part of
the Spanish Ministry or not. no con
cern is felt by the administration, for
before the Spaniards can reach the
- Manila will be in possession
c American and insurgent troops,
the harbor mined and defended by a
war vessels vastly superior to
Spain's squadron.
It is understood that at the
Cabinet meeting to-day the re
ported sale of the Philippines
to Germany by Spain was
considered at some length.
An administration official who
is in a position to know says that
for several days the State De
partment has been In possession
of information to the effect that
Spain was actively engaged In
negotiating a transfer of the
Philippines.
"If it be true that Spain has sold the
islands," said a Cabinet official to-day,
"new and perhaps graver complications
will arise. I do not think there is any
reason to be especially apprehensive of
trouble, and yet how such a transaction
would operate on the present situation
in the Philippines is extremely pro
blematical."
At to-day's Cabinet meeting the Sec
retary of War was instructed to hurry
the third Philippine expedition. The
Porto Rico invasion was discussed at
some length. Tire President expressed
his disapproval of the delay in getting
the Santiago expedition off, more es
pecially in the light of recent events
which show that the delay caused Samp
son to make a premature landing of his
marines, with results that narrowly es
caped being disastrous. The President
urged the adoption of every measure
that might be expected to expedite the
Porto Rican expedition.
Four transports are now anchored
at Fefnandina, twenty-five miles from
Jacksonville, Fla., ready to take the
Porto Rican invasion army. They
have already been loaded with immense
quantities of supplies and munitions of
war. It is believed the President and
his Cabinet hope to see the Porto Rico
invasion set sail within ten days. It is
further believed, and on good authority,
that the convoy of the Santiago expe
dition has orders to return at once to
Fernandina to escort the second inva
sion army to Porto Rico.
There Is no doubt steps are
now being taken by the Navy
Department to organize a fleet
to attack Spanish commerce in
European waters and make a
demonstration against the Cana
ries and the coast of Spain.
The design is to organize a swift and
powerful fleet for this purpose. Thede
partment is canvassing the question of
the selection of vessels to compose this
fleet, and it is expected it will be com
posed of the New York, the Brooklyn,
the Columbia, the Minneapolis, the Cin
cinnati, the San Francisco, the Yale,
the Harvard and the Newark, all fast
cruisers, supported by the Oregon and
the lowa, speedy and powerful battle
ships. The Oregon and lowa are in
cluded on account of the possibility of
their meeting with the Pelayo.
This expedition will not start until

therefore there is abundance of time for
the organization of the fleet.

SPLENDID
BODY OF
MEN SENT
General Miles Praises the
Troops Now on the
Way to Cuba.
Delay in the Departure Gave the
Cubans a Good Opportunity
to Co-operate.
WASHINGTON, June 17. â Major
General Miles, general In chief of the
army, accompanied by Colonel ilaus,
Major Davis and Colonel Greenleaf of
his staff, arrived In Washington to-day
after having directed the departure of
the first army of invasion of Cuba.
General Miles looked hale and hearty,
despite the three weeks Incessant work
of bringing order out of chaos in the
hurriedly concentrated army. He con
ferred with Secretary Alger for half an
hour before the Cabinet meeting and
then had a long talk with General Lud
lnpton, quartermaster general, on the
condition of the quartermaster's sup
plies. Speaking in a general way, of
his observations, General Miles said:
"Having spent some time witfc the
troops during a trying period of hur
rled preparations, I am glad to say that
they are a splendid body of men, which
the country may well be proud of. As
to the regulars, they are the finest
corps in the world without any excep
tion, in physical development, efficien
cy, experience, discipline, marksman
ship, equipment and all that goes to
make up first-class soldiers. Of course,
the volunteer army is not so well equip
ped. Some of the States sent men into
the field in very good condition, notably
Massachusetts and New York. Others
sent their quotas without arms, equip
ment or clothing. They were not sol
diers at all, only employed men. It
takes time to make soldiers of these
men. There must be uniforms, arms,
ammunition, equipment, camp equip
page, tentage, transportation and hos
pital supplies. Th^n, in addition, they
have to have ordnance, artillery, siege
trains, entrenching tools, horse equip
ment, engineering appliances of all
kinds, balloon appliances, etc.
"After that comes the moving of an
army across the sea, with all the dan
gers' and vicissitudes of an ocean voy
age. T"he work, with Its infinite detail,
has been carried out, I am glad to say,
with a fair degree of success and the
command of 15,000 men under General
Shafter moved away with an outburst
of patriotic enthusiasm which over
came the trials they had passed
through."
General Miles' attention was directed
to the reports coming from Tampa of
great confusion and delay in prepar
ing the expedition and getting it off for
Cuba.
"Yes," said he, "there were causes
contributing to this delay. In the first
place, the postoffice service at these
points of army concentration is very
deficient. They have the same facilities
and no more, as the local towns have
when normal conditions exist. When
20,000 to 50,000 man are added to the
population of the small towns, and all
the men are sending end receiving let
SILENCING A SPANISH FORT IN GUANTANAMO.
ters from their friends and relatives at
home, besides the large amount of oftl
ciaJ business carried on, the local post
office facilities are entirely Inadequate.
That has been one of the troubles at
Tampa. Chickamauga and other places,
and as a result the official communica
tion to and from the War Department
on which depend the regularity of
movement of many kind of stores, has
been seriously delayed. Then, in gath
ering tlie munitions of war for an
army, it was necessary to have the ser
vice of a great number of trains loaded
with stores, crowding the meager rail
road lines far beyond their usual capac
ity. However, this is being straighten
ed out now and nearly all of it has
been oven-ome.
'The troops at Tampa are In very
good health, both those who went for
ward with General Shafter and those
still remaining. The sick list is less
than 1 per cent, which is an exception
ally goo.l record. The spirit of the men
also is of the best, and this was shown
In a most marked manner when the
transports started for Cuba last Tues
day. They were all anxious to go and
there wire wild scenes of enthusiasm
and cheering as the men marched
aboard anil the ships got under way.
Whenever a band played the national
air, every head was uncovered. The
men seemed to realize the Importance
of their enterprise, as well as the pa
triotic responsibility it involved.
"There have been many very splen
did acts of heroism, even in the brief
time the troops have been employed,"
continued General Miles. "Lieutenant
Rowan, now lieutenant colonel, and
Lieutenant Wilcox, now captain, in
making their journey to Eastern Cuba
and Porto Rico, gave splendid illus
trations of the courage, fortitude and
resources of the American soldier.
Three expeditions which carried arms
to the Cubans have developed the fin
est kind of courage. Captain Connell
and Lieutenant Crawford, who partici
pated In these expeditions, were with
the Cubans during a sharp engagement
with the enemy. Captain Dorst's sev
eral expeditions have been of great
service to the Government, his last one
in particular being important in re
sults. He started from Key West, but
Instead of going direct to Cuba he went
north and east of Nassau, then turned
south and landed in Cuba at a port
called Banes.
"It has been hold by the Cubans and
is a good harbor, with about twenty
feet of water. Protected by a small
gunboat Captain Dorst landed a steam
er's load of supplies for the Cuban
army, including: 7500 rifles, over a mil
lion cartridges and a great quantity of
stores. A thousand Cubans came to
him while there.
"The special Importance of this trip,
however, was In opening direct com
munication between General Garcia

in New York an artist followed the description from square to square and

and myself. Two of Garcia's staff of
ficers had returned from Cuba with
Rowan and came to Washington to see
me. One of these I sent to Banes with
the supplies of arms, with instructions
to General Garcia, saying I wanted him
to move all his forces to Santiago de
Cuba. He had by that time been fully
equipped by Colonel Dorst. The mes
sage to General Garcia was sent June
2, reaching him June 6, and I got his
reply by cable from Mole St. Nicholas
Juno 9. He had about 8000 armed
Cubans before he received the muni
tions of war by Captain Dorst. The
supplies sent him will enable Garcia to
adequately equip over 15,000 Cubans."
General Miles was asked for the com
munications between him and General
Garcia, and, glancing over them, he
gave their general purport. He said:
"In my communication to him, I ask
ed him to move as large a force as pos
sible to the vicinity of the harbor of
Santiago de Cuba, and to co-operate
with our army and navy on their arri
val, which I hoped would be within
a few days. He was to drive in and
harrass any Spanish troops near San
tiago de Cuba, threatening and attack
ing them at all points and preventing
any reinforcements from reaching that
point. Pending the arrival of our
troops he was to seize any positions
east or west of Santiago or both, which
could be used to advantage by our ar
tillery. He replied that he would re
gard my wishes and suggestions as or
ders and would immediately adopt
measures to concentrate his forces as
directed.
"All his subordinates are ordered to
assist in the disembarking of the
United States troops and to place
themselves under orders. General Gar
cia said he believed it possible for the
artillery positions to be taken as I had
suggested. He sent a force at once to
prevent aid and reinforcements going
to Santiago. The energy of his course
is shown by the reports of the last few
days, for I see that General Rabi and
his men have taken a strong position
just west of Santiago. While there
were unavoidable delays at Tampa,
very annoying to myself and others, I,
at least, had the consolation of know
ing that every day enabled the Cu
bans to make their march across the
country and get possession of positions
which would be of the greatest value
to our troops when they landed."
General Miles does not apprehend
any lonsrer serious delays in disembark
ing the troops on Cuban soil. The
transports have a large number of
small boats to assist in this work. The
engineering corps has large barges and
a pontoon train by which they can put
together a floating pier, so that, un
less there Is a very rough sea or the
men are compelled to disembark in the
surf, which is not anticipated, the dis
embarkation is expected to proceed
rapidly. When General Miles was
askf-f] if he expected an early fight he
answered laconically: "That's what
they've gone for."

But Now It Is Believed She Willi

Favor of Isabella.
Copyrighted. IS9B. by James Gordon Bennett
MADRID, June 17. â The news con
cerning the abdication of the Queen
Regent of Spain, which was given by
the Temps without details, was very
half-heartedly denied In the Madrid
press to-day.
The Queen Regent, much depressed
by the sad condition of the country and
the Spanish people's lack of sympathy
for her, made up her mind a fortnight
ago to renounce her rights and title as
regent in favor of the Infanta Isabella,
a sister of th late King Alfonso XII.
This Princess, who is Spanish in heart
and mind, is much beloved throughout
the kingdom. The Queen Regent
thoueht that by fielding the regency to
her she would disarm the adversaries
of the existing reerime and rally all the
sympathies around the little King.
She even formed the resolution of quit
ting Spain for a lime after her abdica
tion with her two daughters, leaving
the young sovereign to reign and the
new regent.
She summoned Premier Sagasta and
eloquently laid her plan before him.
This occurred on Wednesday last. A

The call was issued this evening as

Queen Regent to beg her to give tin th"Â«
scheme for the present. They told her ,
that under the present circumstances
her abdication -would seem like flight
and would be very badly construed by,
the country.
Premier Sagasta was so persuastvaf
that he obtained the following replyj!
from the Queen Regent:
"I admit you are right, str; but I do^l
not altogether give up my plan. I only};
postpone it."
I have also been informed this after< 1
noon of a very significant fact. Gen*i
eral Sachls, the young King's military,'
tutor, who occupies apartments in tha:
palace, has also private apartments inÂ»!
the Calle de la Caiz. These apart
merits have been ffhut up for two years*
and a half, but on Monday upholster
ers were at work making the place
habitable. Neighbors conclude from;
this that the King's tutor is about to
leave the palace and resume possession
of his private apartments, and see inj
the incident the prelude to radical i
changes at the royal palace.
What is going on or what will hap*
pen is what every one anxiously asks,
especially as the Republicans and Car
lists are beginning to bestir them-
selves in a way which is very disquiets
ing for the future of Alfonzo's crown.
the conference of the Populist National^
Committee adjourned without day. The
final outcome was the practical rout of
the "middle-of-the-road" crowd under'
the leadership of Milton Parke, although
the liberal wing made some concessions.,
The last conference held last night
was on the admission of J. R. Sover
eign as a proxy delegate from lowa.
This was final]/ dropped, and the com
mittee got down to work on the main,
report of the conference committee.
This was modified in some of its mala
points and adopted.
There will be no convention in 1899
to outline the policy of the party, but
in 1900 there will be an early conven
tion to nominate a national ticket, the
same to be held prior to the Demo
cratic Convention. No overture look
ing to fusion will emanate from the
National Committee and none will be
received and entertained by It. The Na
tional Committee is required to keep
hands off in State campaigns; or, if its
assistance be invited it may interfere
only on behalf of the Populist ticket
and not to assist in fusion. In sending
out the call for the convention the
chairman and the secretary must make
clear the terms as laid down in this
compromise.
The effort to force Chairman Butler
to resign proved futile, and he will con
tinue to act until the next national con
vention in 1900.

SUPPORTS THE
QUARRY POOL
Stockton's Council Bars
Folsom Rock.
ITS ACTION NOT IN FAVOR
COST OF STREET BUILDING IS
INCREASED.
Citizens Complain Because They Are
Compelled to Put Money Into
the Pockets of tha
Combine.
tpÂ»ctal PlFrateh to The Call.
STOCKTON, June 17.â Pronounced
dissatisfaction <xists among a major
ity "f the property owners of this city
over the action of the City Council in
striking out Folsom rock in street
work, against the opinion of the City
Engineer and those officials beat In
formed upon the subject of street build
ing.
During the year ISP6 and the earlier
months of last year Stockton built four
miles of beautiful and substantial
streets, and the burden fell lightly
upon property owners, thanks to the
extremely low figure at which the prod
uct of the State plant at Folsom was
delivered to contractors. The power
of the quarry monopoly was efCectually
broken and this . iiy was the first to
reap the benefits. After the defeat of
the quarrymen's lobby in the last Leg
islature, the efforts to discredit the rock
were continued, but so long as the for
mer City Council, consisting of Messrs.
Qulnn, Koch, I^ang. Martin and Bur
ton, remained in office the efforts to'
change the specifications on street work
were of no avail.
A new Council, consisting of Messrs.
Wagner, Neumlller, Harrison, Williams
and Qulnn, came into office last July,
pledged to the most rigorous economy.
The fact that the four former mem
bers are responsible for an attempt to
discredit the Folsom rock is a Joke
which property owners can hardly ap
preciate.
The majority of the Council began
the attack on the rock and played into
the hands of the quarrymen shortly af
ter assuming the municipal reins. On
October SO a local paper, which, before
that time, was friendly to the Coun
cil, made the following announcement:
The amended speculations for the im
provement of American street, between
"Veber avenue and Main street, were
adopted at the meeting held last evening.
â¢ â¢ * This work will make an opening
for the hungry quarrymen who have tried
for two years to break down the State
ruck crushing plant at Folsom, but failed
because resolute State officers stood
against them and thwarted their efforts
to change the laws to their ends.
The provision In the specification which
openly declared that Folsom rock should
not be used wus stricken out, but the new
requirement just as effectually prevents
the use of the State rook. Councilman
Quinn, who, at the previous meeting, had
opposed the change and upheld the State
Industry, wbm absent last evening.
Councilman Quinn, who is beyond
doubt the b^st acquainted with the va
rious qualities of rock, says the main
objection urged ag-ainst the Folsom
product is that upon thoroughfares
traveled to any considerable extent the
rock grinds and eventually blows away
or leaves depressions In the crown of
the etreet which permit of ax-cumula
tions of water, and this in time under
mines the entire base. Mr. Quinn con
siders this no argument against Fol
som rock, and contends with City En
gineer Compton that the fault lies in
the manner in which the rock is put
down. This was done in the follow
ing manner: First, a layer of heavy
rock was spread and rolled. This was
followed by a layer of smaller rock,
perhaps averaging an inch and a half
screen. Upon this came a layer of
fine rock, almost dust. Under the
heavy rolling it became dust and, al
though assuming a hard surface under
the roller it ground under heavy traffic,
just as any other rock would do, and
the surface contemplated by the speci
fications was not in every Instance ob
tained.
It is eontpn'led that this third qual
ity has do place on the street, and in
Its place the rock used In the middle
layer should be allowed to fill up the
required depth and It would have suf
ficient resistance to allow the packing
process to become complete.
City Engineer Compton Is a firm j
friend of Folsnm rock, but It would |
seem there is an influence stronger than :
his professional opinion at work in the |
Council.
The Council has not been content to
strike a blow In favor of the rock mo
nopoly. ThÂ«^ cost has been saddled !
upon the people by increasing the cost]
Of street building about $210 a block.
Reference has been made to the
American street job. The street is
finished and at present It appears
neither better nor worse than the Fol
som-rock streets.
As "figures talk," a comparative
statement will best phnw the injustice;
the "reform" Council is doing the peo- i
pie of Stockton. Illustrative of the
coat of Folsoin rock one may take
Park, between Harrison and Madison
streets, which was done with Folsom j
rock. This cost $1.1512 per front foot.
A lot of fifty feet, accordingly, about
5.Y7 56. The straight rock work here
was 39.39 feet wide, and the cost of the
block, of double :<OO feet, without Inter
sections, etc., was $690 72.
Now take the str.eet and make the
width 55.56 feet, bo as to make the com
parison With Amrrican street true. This
â width would hnve cost $1,623 a foot,
$S1 15 a lot and $973 SO for the block.
Now take the American street block
where the Benlcla quarry rock was
used. This cost $1.96 a foot, or 34 cents
more than Park street. The cost was
$17 more on the front of a fifty-foot lot
and something over $Â°04 on the block,
not counting Intersections.
All of the contracts let this year, with
the pxoeptinn of some work on San
Joaquln street, has called for rock other
than that obtainable at the State
quarry, this, too, in face of the fact
that this rock can be laid down here
at 79 cents per yard. Center street,
from Mormon Channel to South street,
Is being done by Clark & Henery with
the Cordelia rock; Madison, from Oak
to Flora, by W. J. Comfort with Be
nicia rock.
It Is alleged thepo contractors are the
sole agents for the rock they are us
ing, and that some understanding ex
ists among the quarrymen whereby
only favored ones can find the rock re
quisite for the work under the new
specifications. George W. Bldwell put
in a bid upon some work recently 'and
made arrangements to got the Laundry
Farm rock, but somehow the owners
found it impossible to supply the rock.
Every advantage has been taken by the
rock dealers of the action of the City
Council. It has been valuable to them
as an entering wedge and the libel on
Folsom rock Is being circulated in other
places with a view of discouraging the
use of th* 3 Folsom product.
The people here have not repudiated
the ruck. The private quarrymen
would be charging double prices now.
them down. The firÃt "kick" was made
in the Council, not by the people, but
by certain members and contractors.
The objections made were weak, indeed.
The people are moving to find out why
they are being thus taxed for the ben
efit of private companies, while the
State maintains a plant to obviate this
injustice, and encourage the building at
a small expense of public thorough
fares, __^__^___^_

MOB LYNCHES
FOUR NEGROES
Triple Murder . Avenged
in Alabama.
TROOPS ARRIVE TOD LATE
ONE OF THE CULPRITS MAKES
CONFESSION.
He and His Companions Hanged to
a Tree and Their Bodies
Riddled With
Bullets.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MONTGOMERY, Ala., June 17.â Four
of the five negroes taken from the jail
at Wetumpka last night were hanged
this morning at a point ten miles from
Wetumpka and thirty-two miles from
the scene of their crime. The four were
Sol Jackson, Lewis Shier, Jesse Thomp
son and Camp Reese. The troops from
here did not succeed in locating the
prisoners, as the country is hilly,
rough and wooded. The most of the
night and this morning were spent by
the mob in a sort of trial, investigat
ing the crime and getting at the guilty
ones.
The four negroes who were hanged
confessed to having participated in the
murder of Mr. and Mrs. Carden and
Carlo, and one of them told where he
had hidden the money. He was com
pelled to find it, and, in a few minutes,
near the scene of the crime, all four
were swung up and their bodies rid
dled with bullets.
The militia was unable to follow the
mob last night, as its members were all
well mounted and no means of con
veyance were at hand to take the sol
diers after them. This morning when
efforts to find the negroes were re
newed news came over the telephone
from Wetumpka that they had been dis
covered swinging from a limb.
FATAL RIOTS IN
AUSTRIAN GALICIA
There Has Also Been an Outbreak of
Albanians Near the Frontier
of Montenegro.
CRACOW, Austrian Galicia, June 17.â
The situation in Gorlice, in connection
with the anti-Semitic excesses, is one
of the most serious character. Bands of
men from other districts have re-enforced
the petroleum workers and peasants of
Gorlice and are attacking, plundering and
burning public buildings. They have at
tacked the towns of Biecz and Gordice,
which had to be defended by troops.
LEMBERG, Austrian Galicia, June 17.â
Gangs of peasants yesterday attacked
and plundered the Jewish shops atFenyz
tak, near Rzossow, and wounded several
Jev.% The police fired on the mob, kill-
Ing six of the rioters and wounding five
more.
CONSTANTINOPLE, June 17.â The out
break of the Albanians at Berane, near
the frontier of Montenegro, the gravity
of which is comparable to the troubles
preceding the Servia-Montenegro war
against Turkey In 1876, is duo to revenge
taken by some of the Christians upon the
Albanian murderers of a Christian notable
last autumn. The Albanians in remote
districts participated in the recent out
rages.
In consequence of the renewed repre
sentations of Montenegro, supported by
Russia, the Sultan has dispatched troops
to the disturbed districts from Uskub.
There was fighting all day Thursday and
many were killed or wounded on both
sides. According to the- Cettinje advices
many women and children who were flee
ing toward Montenegro have been killed
by Albanians.
CETTINJE, Montenegro, June 17.â The
earlier reports that the Turks had re
sumed the work of burning villages are
fully confirmed. In the Berano district
of Albania 700 houses belonging to Ser
vian Christians have been burned.
The Turks are committing horrible
atrocities, and two Servian women have
T>een barbarously murdered.
JULIETTE ATKINSON
THE TENNIS QUEEN.
Defeats Marian Jones of Nevada
in a Brilliant Contest at
Philadelphia.
PIIIL,ADEI,PHIA, June 17.â Miss Juli
ette Atkinson of New York to-day at the
Philadelphia cricket grounds again won
the ladies' national tennis championship,
defeating Miss Marian Jones of Nevada
in a brilliant and close contest, Câ 3, 5â7,
6âi, 2â6, 7â5.
The contestants were evenly matched,
but experience and endurance told. Miss
Atkinson was much the stronger at the
end of the three hours' fast playing-. Both
played a base line game throughout, sel
dom coming up to the net. Miss Jones'
defeat is largely due to her physical weak
ness after the second set.
The third set was very faat, and the
pace began to tell upon the stocky little
girl from the first. IHirlng the final set
Miss Jones was only one point from the
match and the championship, but Miss
Atkinson tied her and beat her out each
time. In the ninth game of the set a
brilliant play took place which was
spoiled by the ball In play hitting a ball
lying In Miss Jones' court. At that time
Miss Jones needed but one point to win,
and her supporters groaned as the chance
faded away. Miss Atkinson then won the
next four games and the match by fast
playing.
In the mixed doubles, championship
round Miss C. B. Neely of Chicago and E.
P. Fischer of New York beat Miss Helen
Chapman and J. B. Hill of Philadelphia,
6-2, 6-4.

GAINS DELAY
Annexation Talk in the
Senate Held Back.
POSTPONED UNTIL MONDAY
SPEECHES TO BE MADE AGAINST
THE RESOLUTION.
The Discussion to Be Opened by
Senator White, Who Will Be
Followed by Petti
grew.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, June 17.â Only about
fifteen minutes' time was consumed
by the Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee to-day in reaching a conclu
sion to report the resolutions for the
acquisition of the Hawaiian Islands by
the United States. Only two of the
Democratic members, Turpie and Mills,
were present at the meeting and they
contented themselves by recording their
votes in opposition to a motion to re
port favorably, showing no disposition
to delay action by the committee. The
Republicans voted in the negative and
Senator Davis stated he was author
ized to cast the vote of Senator Mor
gan (D.) In the affirmative. The fact
developed that while the resolution first
received the sanction of the House, it
was prepared by Senator Davis, and
no disposition was manifested to
change it in any respect.
It is already becoming evident that
the reported understanding among the
members of the finance committee
reached during the pendency of the
war revenue bill to the effect that the
Hawaiian resolution should not come
up for consideration during the pres
ent Congress, will cut an important
figure in the consideration of the ques
tion in the Senate. This matter was in
formally presented to the Republican
members of the committee in behalf of
the Democrats after the adjournment
of the committee meeting to-day and
they were informed that the Demo
cratic members of the finance commit
tee were generally disposed to contend
that the agreement was explicit to the
effect that the Hawaiian question
should not be revived in the Senate
during the present session. Pome of the
Republican members of thy Foreign
Relations Committee stated that they
had never before heard of the agree
ment, but all manifested a disposition
to investigate the matter.
In the executive session of the Sen
ate, held late in the day, an agreement
was reached to adjourn over until Mon
day, thus postponing the taking up of
the annexation question until that time.
The action was taken on motion of
Senator Jones of Arkansas, who stated
that the opponents of the annexation
resolution desired the extra time in
which to prepare themselves for the
Hawaiian debate. He stated that they
had supposed that the debate would be
initiated by the advocates of the reso
lutions, but that having heard that they
intended to make no speeches he
though the opposing party should not
be expected to begin so abruptly.
Senator Morgan at first opposed the
motion, contending for the necessity of
a session to-morrow, but he afterward
yielded and the motion prevailed.
Senator Davis said that under the cir
cumstances he would Insist upon a Sat
urday session, but that he hoped that
when the resolution should be taken
up Monday the matter would be pro
ceeded with expeditiously. The inci
dent served to bring out the fact that
it is the purpose of the friends of the
resolution not to debate it at all.
The discussion will bo opend Mon
day by Senator White, who will be fol
lowed by Senator Pettigrew.
NEWLANDS' RESOLUTION
REPORTED TO SENATE
White Gives a Hint of His Opposition
to the Annexation of
Hawaii.
WASHINGTON, Juno 17.â The Foreign
Relations Committee, through Davis, the
chairman, to-day reported favorably to
the Senate the Newlands resolution for
the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands.
Davis announced his purpose of calling up
the resolution to-morrow for considera
tion, but as the Senate decided later to
adjourn until Monday, the debate upon
the resolution will not begin until tiia.t
time.
White indicated that he would lead the
opposition to annexation by requesting
Davis to* repeat his statement, the Cali
fornia Senator not having heard it. After
Davis hod repeated his announcement
Whits resumed his seat, evidently satis
fied.
The bill to incorporate the International
American Bank, in accordance with the
recommendation of the Pan-Ajnerican
Congress, which has occupied a greater
part of the Senate's time this week, was
passed this afternoon by a vote of 26 to
23. The design of the measure is to fur
nish such banking and exchange facilities
as will promote trade between the United
States and the countries of Central and
South America. The bill provides that the
bank shall have a capital stock of $5,000,
000, and that the capital stock may be
increased to $2"). 000, 000. The institution,
in accordance with the terms of the bill,
shall be under the supervision of the
Comptroller of the Currency, .and in the
charter of the corporation, which the bill
grants, certain privileges are accorded to
the incorporators in view of advantages
which are expected to accrue to those In
terested in trade with Southern countries.
An amendment to the bill provides that
any coteries of citizens who comply with
the requirements of this charter may or
ganize and establish an international
bank.
WOLF'S COMET SEEN.
Observed Through the Big Telescope
on Mount Hamilton.
LICK OBSERVATORY, June 17.â Wolfs
periodic comet was found at 3 o'clock this
morning by Professor W. J. Huffey with
the 3G-inch telescope. It was close to its
predicted pl&co, and wag found instantly.
No attempt has been made here to ob
serve it. The measurement of Its position
was obtained." The comet was seen with
out difficulty with the 36-inch refractor,
but it would probably be quite faint with
small telescopes. It : has a ; central con
densation and a short tail not more than
1% minutes long . The comet wis first dis
covered by Max Wolf of Heidelberg in
1884, and was rediscovered by Spitaler of
Vienna in IS9I. Its period is about seven

TRANSPORTS
NEARLY READY
Nero and Monadnock
Taking on Stores.
APPRENTICES IN REVOLT
DID NOT CARE TO SERVE ON
THE GRANT AND RUSH.
Navy Yard Officials Consider the
Brutus and Nero Good In
vestments for the Gov
ernment.
ISLAND NAVY YARD, June
1~. â Repairs on the transport Nero and
monitor Monadnoek are fast nearing
completion. The engines on both ships
have undergone a thorough overhaul
ing, the boilers on the Nero have been
tested and repaired, and new ventila
tors put in. She will be towed to San
Francisco by the Unadilla when her
stores are aboard. Nearly 4000 tons of
coal will be taken aboard and a ship
load now lying out in the stream will
also be towed to San Francisco.
On the Monadnock everybody is busy
putting aboard stores, and giving the
finishing touches to the engines. Very
little repair was necessary to the main
engines, but the air pumps and evapor
ators have undergone extensive
changes and the steam engineering
department with a corps of copper
smiths, have been working day and
night to have everything ready on time.
A week ago, according to orders, the
apprentice boys were transferred from
"the Pensacola to the former revenue
cutters Grant and Rush. The boys did
not like the idea of serving on such
small boats, and after a few days got
together and delegated a number to
interview the commandant with the
hope of securing their transfer back to
the Pensacola or some other ship. The
committee interviewed Admiral Kirk
land, who, after listening to the ar
gument of the lads to the effect that
they had enlisted for service in first
class naval ships and not in makeshift
gunboats, granted the request and sent
them jubilantly back to the Pensacola,
Steam was got up on the Nero
this morning and on a dock trial her
engines worked in a satisfactory man
ner. She will be towed to San Fran
cisco to-morrow and her cargo of coal,
nearly 4000 tons, placed aboard as soon
as possible. Both the Brutus and the
Nero have been good investments for
the Government. They are virtually
new ships, with large displacements,
economical with fuel, and require but
i few men to run them. The coal con
! sumption at nine to ten knots an hour
lis not over twenty tons per day. The
boilers are exceedingly large for the
! amount of power required, and were
I found to be in excellent condition.
The cruiser Philadedlphia will be
placed on the dock next Thursday for
the third time.
The sailing ship Kahne, which has
lain at anchor for a couple of weeks,
was towed to the city this afternoon
by the Unadilla, The Nero will prob
ably follow nf-xt Thursday and load
her cargo of coal.

LOS ANGELES
WATER TANGLE
City Council Has Let Its
Hands Be Tied.
WARNINGS LEFT UNHEEDED
THERE NOW SEEMS LITTLE
HOPE FOR THE CITIZENS.
In the Height of the Melee Mayor
Snyder Has Mysteriously
Left the City.
LOS ANGELES, June 17.â There is a
difference of just $1,700,000 between
what the City Council wants to pay
and what the Los Angeles Water Com
pany is willing to accept for its plant.
The Council to-day agreed by a unani
mous vote to tender the water company
$1,300,000 for its improvements to the
city's plant. This was in response to
the company's offer to sell for $3,000,
000. This difference of over a $1,500,000
did not come as a surprise. It was ex
pected. When the Council met the
committee on water Bupp-.y it was re
ported that the City Engineer had
made a thorough examination of the
additions the company had made to the
plant since the date of his last valua
tion, July 20, 1897. These additions he
reported had a valuation of about $110,
000. and added to the total of his pre
vious valuation, made a grand total of
$1,300,000, which was offered the com
pany.
As soon as the water committee made
Its report to this effect it was unani
mously adopted. The City Clerk was
then instructed to notify the water
company of the offer and request a re
ply not later than Monday next.
At that time the water company will
respond and decline the offer. The city
will then invite the water company to
arbitrate under the terms of its con
tract. The water company will agree
to arbitration, but will demand that be
fore any steps are taken that the city
indicate where and how it will secure
the funds necessary to pay the amount
of award and what assurance the com
pany can be given that the award will
be binding. Neither the city nor any
of its officers can give any such as
surances such as are desired. It can
only raise money to buy improvements
by voting 1 bonds. These bonds cannot
be voted until the amount of money de
sired is known and specified, which it
will be impossible to ascertain until af
ter the arbitrators have fixed a price.
Then, if this price so fixed is too large
in the opinion of voters bonds will be
defeated and the city will have no
money with which to make good the
award of the arbitrators.
This is the unfortunate and compli
cated condition the water problem is in.
It is just exactly what The Call out
lined and warned the people of Lo3
Angeles against months ago.
No steps were taken to unravel the
snarl, however, until now, when but
little over thirty days remain of the life
of the '"water company's contract with
the city.
Mayor Snyder has mysteriously left
the city and no one knows whence he
has gone. Those who do know will not
tell. Only one thing is known, he is
absent from the city on water busi
ness, but just what point he is trying
to make cannot be discovered.
The water company has played its
cards very cleverly. It has within the
last thirty days stood strictly to its
contract and is complying with it
strictly. The scheme of the company is
to place the city in default on the con
tract, which will prevent Mayor Snyder
and the police force from taking- forci
ble possession of the works at midnight
of July 22.
The water imbroglio will soon be at
its height and some anomalous and
stirring scenes and situations are prom
ised before a final settlement is made.
TRANSPORTING REINDEER.
Steamer Del Norte Will Carry a Load
From Siberia to Alaska,
SEATTLE, June 17.â The steamer Del
Norte was to-day chartered by the United
States Government through Dr. Sheldon
Jackson, to transport reindeer from Si
beria to Alaska as well as 10 carry Gov
ernment supplies north. It is expected

kins and Siberia for the reindeer.
As many reindeer as possible will be
purchased by Dr. Jackson, who will be
a passenger on the Del Norte to Siberia.
Dr. Jackson will take passage on Sunday

tle to St. Michael, wh#re he will go aboard
the Del Norte. The Louise J. Kenney
will carry eighty Laplanders from
Port Townsemi to the various missions
In Alaska, and some of thorn may go
to Siberia to lend their assistance in tak
ing the reindeer to Alaska.

THE NEXT FLEET OF TRANSPORTS.
Will Sail for Manila in flbout a Wee^ With Troops
and Munitions of War for Dewey.
The fleet of transports now being fitted out will be ready for the troops inside of a week. The Ohio,
at Lombard street wharf, was being coaled from scow schooners and ligrhters yesterday, while the Morgan
City was taking coal out of the steamer Centennial at Folsom Btreet wharf. The Indiana is at Pacific street
wharf, but except for painting and cleaning nothing is being done to her. She has 2000 tons of coal in her hold
and is ready to receive freight at an hour's notice. At the Mail dock the City of Para is taking coal out of
lighters, while carpenters are at work fixing up bunks in the 'tween decks.
The Xero is expected down from Mare Island to-day. She will go alongside the British ship Rahane and
take in that vessel's cargo of coal. The job will occupy a few days and as soon as it is accomplished the Mo
nadnock will come down from the navy-yard and both vessels will start for Manila. The chances are that the
coast defense steamer, collier and transports will all get away together.
WILL PASS THEIR
LIVES IN PRISON
TWO YOUNG ROBBERS MEET A
JUST FATE.
George Barker and Joseph Theron
Sentenced to Folsom Peniten
tiary â Mother's Plea.
Two hardened young criminals, George
Barker and Joseph Theron. <yen, sen
tenced to pass the remainder of their lives
in Folsom Prison by Judge Wallace yes
terday. The crime for which the two con
victs "were sentenced was a most atrocious
one. On the night of April 14 last three
young men entered the store of Edward
Leibschau at Mason and Pacific streets
and covered the proprietor with their re
volvers. He resisted and they beat him
into insensibility with their weapons and
took all the money he had and Jewelry
valued at about $I.V). While the young
criminals were looting the establishment
Leibschau regained consciousness and
raised such a disturbance that the atten
tion of the police was attracted and the
robbers were captured. Barker and The
ron were two of them and when their
cases came up for trial the last-nameg
criminal pleaded guilty, but Barker stood
trial He was convicted promptly, and as
both had prior convictions recorded
against them the court did not feel
posed to ''temper justice with mercy.
When tho prisoners appeared in court
for sentence Barker was a*ked if he had
anything to say. The prisoner replied In
the negative and thereupon Judge \\ al
lace imposed sentence M life imprison
ment at Folsom. When Theron's turn
came his counsel, Eueene N. Deuprey,
put the lad's mother on the stand to tes
tify as to his good character. The wit
ness was aged and worn, and told her
story in a voice trembling with emotion.
She said that she had two sons, one a sea
man on the Charleston, the other the pris
oner at the bar. Both were good boys,
she said, and she asked the Judge if for
her sake be would not be merciful.
His Honor said that he did not doubt
the mother's faith in her son, but he
feared that she was mistaken as his rec
ord showed that he was past reformation
and that he must suffer the punishment
meted out to his accomplice, imprison
ment for life.
Henry Etauh was next called up for
sentence upon a convjetion of burglary in
the second degree. When asked If he had
anything to say he made a dramatic
speech, protesting his Innocence, but as
.-. jury had henrd the evidence against
him and declared him guilty, his effort
had but little effect and he was sentenced
to five years in Folsom.
ST. ROSE ACADEMY.
Interesting Commencement Exer
cises and an Exhibition of
Art Work.
The commencement exercises of St.
Rope Academy were held at Native Sons'
Hall yesterday afternoon. The audience
w:ip large and appreciative and the pre
sentation of a long programme was man
aged in a manner to do credit to profes
sionals. Notwithstanding the large num
ber of children to be controlled, there
was -no delay and a thoroughly enter
taining exhibition of the capabilities of
the pupils was given. Among the more
striking features of the entertainment
were fifty little girls who sane and acted
"Dolly's Mamma"; national songs by
thirty young Americans dressed ay Jack
tars and following Old Glory; a very tak
ing group of little girls as sunflowers in
a song in which they dis?- -reared after
the fashion of the "Ten Little Injuns';
-i pretty dance to waltz and march; The
Colors "of Our Nation." as illustrated by
thirty-six young misses dressed in red,
whit."- and* blue, twelve 0.. each color.
Their drill was very cleverly executed.
Miss Alm:i Mrc'ormick, one of the gradu
ates surprised her auditors with the
sweetness and culture of h^r voice, and
the pupils ;is a school did full credit to
those who instructed them.
The graduates were Misses Alma Mc-
Cormlck, Eleanor Kiely and Louise Cre-
An interesting part of the affair was
the art exhibit in the parlor of the hall,
where the work of pupils who have ais
tii â¢i.shed themselves in the last term
was shown. The exhibits were in cera
mics art embroidery and crayon draw

ORATED ON THE HOUSETOP.
Burning Words of Patriotism Ac
company a Flag Raising in
the Wholesale District.
It is seldom that an orator mounts to
the housetops to give voice to thoughts
that are uppermost in his mind, but this
has happened, and the man to earn dis
tinction on that score Is no other than
genial Harry Tapkin of the grocery nrm
of Tillmann & Bendel. There may be
some virtue in his course, as . a man
speaking on the roof has the satisfaction
of knowing that his voice Is being car
ried by the four winds to all quarters of
1 Vfut for the fact that the employes of
Tillmann & Bendel were without a flag to
fly from their staff this incident would
not have happened. While one young man
was engaged In the happy task of meaa
iirine out sugar It occurred to him that a
flair was an Important adjunct to the
business, and he dropped his scoop and
consulted his fellow employes. The re
sult was that money was quickly sub
scribed und a handsome new banner was
purchased. It was thought proper by
the committee that a day should be set
apart for flag raising and that appropri
ate functions should accompany the cere
mony. Bombs were bo-'ght. an orator, se

pear at 7:30 o'clock Thursday morning. A
circle was formed round the flagstaff on
the roof, and while Tapkin delivered
some burning thoughts on love of coun
try, etc.. interspersed by the firing of a
21-gun salute and the enthusiastic shouts
of fellow employes, the stars and stripes
were given to the breeeze. Every one de
scended to his daily work with a feeling
of contentment.

REGULATIONS FOR
MEN WHO BREW
DECISIONS WHICH WILL INTER
EST ALL MALSTERS.
Instructions as to the Class Who Will
Be Obliged to Pay the Special
Tax as Revenue.
Internal Revenue Collector Lynch re
ceived yesterday a letter from the Com
missioner of Internal Revenue at Wash
ington setting forth decisions to guide him
in certain cases in collecting the taxes on
malt liquors. They are as follows:
A brewer holding a special tax stamp of the
smaller class 1b not required to pay special tax
as a brewer of the larger class until the entire
quantity of beer produced by him within the
special tax year amounts to COO barrels.
As soon as the quantities produced month
by month within that period amount In the
aggregate to 500 barrels he must pay the spe
cial tax of a brewer of the larger class for the
entire year ($100). He may then send In his
stamp of the smaller class for redemption.
Brewers who establish places of storage for
bottled beer and complete sales by deliveries
therefrom to purchasers in wholesale quanti
ties are required to nay special tax as whole
sale dealers in malt liquors at every such place.
A compound of medicinal roots and distilled
spirits, if held out not merely as a remedy for
diseases, but also as "bitters for mixed
drinks," Is not to be regarded as made in good
faith for medicinal use only, and. therefore,
the manufacturer who sells it under such a
label is not entitled to the exemption provided
by section 3246. revised statutes, and is re
quired to pay special tax as a rectifier and
liyÂ»Rf^dealer.
Rtttun.s made by brewers of the amount of
l<.-r manufactured and sold by them are made
under compulsion of law for but one purpose,
namely, the collection of revenue for the
United States, and copies thereof are not per
mitted to be furnished to any persons for any
purpose. '
BOY BURGLARS CAUGHT.
Broke Into a Warehouse and Stole
Valuable Property.
Three boys, named John Morrlssey,
John McShea and Aleck Kenney, were
arrested last evening by Detectives Ry
an and ODea and Policeman Orr and
charged with burglary. A short time ago
they broke Into the warehouse of the Pa
cific Bridge Company, on Townsend
street, and stole about $400 worth of brass
bearings. They sold part of the stolen
property to A. Simon, a Junk-dealer, for
$11. The detectives have recovered all
the booty.
The youthful prisoners are well known
to the "police, Morrlssey and McShea hav
ing recently graduated from the lone
Training School. Konney was formerly
an inmate of the Boys' and Girls' Aid
Society.
The Weather

will be open to all. The resort is being
handled with so careful discrimination

THE COAL CASES
ARE DISMISSED
ATTORNEY FOOTE ENTERS A
NOLLE PROS.
Most of the Defendants Are Poor and
Did Not Believe They Were
Violating the Law.
The criminal Indictments against Charles
R. Allen and 411 other wholesale and re
tall coal dealers for entering into an un
lawful agreement in restraint of trade
were dismissed yesterday by United
States Attorney Foote, who entered a
nolle prosequi in the cases.
The United States District Court was
crowded yesterday morning with coal
dealers under indictment ready to listen
to the argument of their counsel â T. C.
Coogan, Thomas I). Riordan, W. D. Fi
fleld, Milton AndroÃ, James T. Boyd,
George W. Towle Jr. and William Craig.
When the case was called United States
Attorney Foote arose and read the fol
lowing to the court:
"Being of the opinion that In the
United States Circuit Court on the civil
side of the docket the alleged trust and
monopoly in coal Involved m this indict
ment has been broken up, and being fur
ther of the opinion that on the facts it
appears that many, if not all, of the de
fendants believed In good faith that they
were not violating any criminal law. I
deem that the interests of public justice
require me to ask that a nolle prosequi
be entered as to all the defendants, which
I now accordingly do."
Judge de Haven remarked that the
court had no discretion In the matter and
that It lay wholly within the province of
the United States Attorney. He accord
ingly instructed Clerk Manley to enter
up the dismissal and to exonerate the
bondsmen of the defendants.
United States Attorney Foote was In
terviewed after adjournment of court and
declined to make any statement as to his
reasons for dismissing the cases other
than as specified in the statement read
by him to the court.
Most of the defendants are poor men
and they were very much relieved when
the cases were dismissed, the litigation
having already cost them much time,
money and anxiety.
THE NEW WAR BONDS.
Important Instructions Sent Yester
day to Assistant Treasurer
Jacobs.
The subscriptions for the new 3 per cent
war bonds have passed the two million
dollar mark at the First National Bank
in this city. According to advices from
Washington the smaller subscriptions
will have the preference over the larger.
Had the opportunity been presented the
entire issue would have been taken up by
syndicates and capitalists, but the desire
was to make It a popular loan and this is
why the subscriptions under $500 arc pre
ferred. When the smaller purchasers are
provided for then the larger subscribers
will be taken up in their order. Cashier
Lynch of the First National Bank says
that since the books were opened the de
mand for these popular bonds has been
very steady, and this is shown by the fact
that the $2,000,000 has been taken up by
about 750 people.
Of these at least 50 per cent have called
for bonds under $1000. The subscription
list will close on July 14. Before that date
the bank will send out notices to the sub
scribers that they must come forward and
make their deposits. This done, the sub
scription list and the amount of the de
posits will be turned over to the Assistant
Treasurer of the Sub-Treasury on Com
mercial street. Until yesterday Julius
Jacobs, the new Assistant Treasurer, had
received no instructions in the matter of
bonds. At noon th.c following dispatch
made clear his duties in the premises:

A"JOKER" IN
STREET ORDERS
Over a Million Dollars
Uncollectible.
EIGHT EXTENSIONS VOID
NO SALARY OR EXPENSES FOR
COMMISSIONERS.
They Will Be Responsible Them
selves for Any Bills Contracted.
Their Own Lawyers Drew
the Orders.
There are no less than eight street ex
tensions, with their acompanying assess
ment districts and their commissions,
which will be affected by the paragraph
in the orders of the Supervisors which
has just been the cause of the annulling
of the Potrero-street extension, according
to the opinion of the City and County
Attorney.
The street extensions were all commend
ed under an act of the Legislature of 18S9.
This was in booming times in real estate,
and the holders of large blocks of outside
lands were responsible for the passage of
the act. Times did not continue to boom,
however, and so, in 1593, there was an
other act passed which annulled the
former act and discharged all the com
missioners appointed under it. In the
meantime work on Mission street, Seven
teenth street and the I^aguna Survey had
been completed. Work on eight other ex
tensions was stopped, and the money that
had been paid in on some of the assess
ments was refunded. Then the act of
March, 1593, was brought into court, and,
by a decision of Judge Slack, It was de
clared unconstitutional. This decision was
never appealed from, and so it became i
unchangeable, and the street extensions
were restored to the standing they had
before the passage of the act of 1893. It
was this restoration to legality, or ap
parent legality, which resulted in the
finding of the joker in the orders.
As the assessments had been restored,
they became a Hen on the property on
which they were levied, and the property
owners of the Mission League of Improve
ment Clubs petitioned the Supervisors to
collect what assessments were due and
so clear their titles. In examining into
the matter, to see what proceeding could
be taken. City and County Attorney Cres
well found that the order had the" objec
tionable words which hud once been de
clared improper by the Supreme Court,
and for which the order before the court
at that time had been declared void. Mr. i
Creswell also found that the other street
extensions were being done under similar
orders, and it is only a Question of time
when they will all follow each other to
ward annullment.
The street extensions were already tied
up under all kinds of litigation, and there
were some property-owners who had en-
Joined the commissions from collecting
their assessments, but the defective or
ders not only free the property-owners,
but effectually prevent the payment of
any claims for services or salaries based
on them. The assessments affected are for j
work on Sixteenth street. $,'M4,614 30; How- i
ard street. (83.560; Post street, $101,750 15;
Nineteenth street, $12n.<M4 45; Mar&ei
street, $402,0W; Twenty-fifth avenue.
Twenty-seventh avenue and New street,
$34,022 67; Potrero avenue, $241,202 63: Po
trero avenue to Army street, $11,000 69;
total, $1,338384 S3.
All these assessments are now void, and
if there has been any money paid in on
them It can be demanded by the property- I
owners who paid it. and the city will !
have to return it. The engineers who
assisted the commissions will get no pay,
tho Commisioners will get no pay. arid i
they will be responsible for any bills for |
labor, stationery or anything else, for the
city is practically released from all lia
bility. And it was the lawyers for the
various commissions who drew up tho
orders that have been their undoing.
GRAFTERS ARE BARRED.
Disreputable Attorneys Not Allowed
to Enter the City Prison.
Captain of Police Seymour Is deter
mined to check the outrages which have
beeji perpetrated on the unfortunate In
mates of the City Prison by disreputable
attorneys. Yesterday, on learning that
an old man had been robbed of $125 by
one of the gang of human vultures, he
promptly issued an order forbidding
them from entering the prison.
Shortly before 5 o'clock yesterday aft
ernoon the gang surrounded the prison
gnte awaiting an opportunity to get in
side to ply their "graft." They were met
by Acting Sergeant Shaw, who, in a few
words, informed them of the order is-
Bued by Captain Seymour.
"This Is tough," lugubriously remarked
the chief rustler of the gang, as he re
traced his steps to a McAllister-street
saloon. "No more cold bots and warm
"Beer and sandwiches will have to do,"
piped "Long-Shot" Rattigan, the driver
of the patrol wagon. "Youse fellers have
had a regular Klondike around here."
"You are the cause of it," answered one
of them. "If you hadn't shot off your
mouth when you and Willie Rose came
together Captain Seymour would not
have Interfered."
"You're on the wrong horse," retaliated
Rattigan. "What are you going to do,
now that the tax on beer has been in
creased?"
Without further replying the chief
rustler walked away to join the gang in
n neighboring saloon.

A prominent vocal instructor, living in one of the prosperous cities of
Connecticut, relates a curious experience: "In learning," she says, "to
properly place and sustain the tone, pupils sometimes feel a faintness and diz-
ziness arising from the peculiar action of the diaphragm and the effort of con-
trolling of the breath. I have known a girl to actually have to sit down for
fear of fainting. I became convinced that the difficulty came from a weak
stomach and talked with my physician about it. He was inclined to think
that I had the right solution of the trouble. Some time after that I, from
time to time, gave a Ripans Tabule to a pnpil. suggesting that it be taken
before coming to the next lesÃon. The effect was precisely what I had hoped.
The pupils were relieved of the difficulty and able to take the full half hour of
vocal exercise without any of the old trouble. It seems a queer use to makÂ» .

FALSE IN ONE, FALSE IN ALL.
UNDER its present management The Call was in
tended to be made a newspaper second to none
in the metropolitan cities of the world. That
end has been attained. We have given news and not
inventions, and have treated our readers in good faith
and fairness. In combination with the Herald, The
Call commands a news service that has never been ex
celled. That service, belting the globe as it does, and
alert in every news center and at every point of interest
as it is, may occasionally be in error, but only through
reliance upon faulty authority and never by intention
nor invention. As we have before pointed out, the
existence of a rumor is in itself news, though the fact
rumored may prove non-existent. A rumor is, in a
Lir^e sense, indicative of the state of mind in the com
munity in which it rises and runs. It is often the ex
pression of widespread public expectation, and there
fore the reasons for regarding the currency of a ru
mor as news are perfectly legitimate. In respectable
journalism the line between the report of an existing
rumor and facts accomplished as news is never diffi
cult to discern and readers are never deceived.
Journalism that is yellow, indecent and deceptive
not only omits discrimination between nimor and
news, but it persistently invents both.
It is no pleasure to us to frequently refer to the
Hearst papers, the Examiner and Journal, as examples
of yellow, indecent and deceptive journalism. Hearst's
invented interviews with the Pope, the Queen Regent
of Spain and Mrs. McKinley, into whose presence no
representative of his papers ever penetrated, illustrate
the deceptive and invented quality of the news which
he boasts of giving to his readers.
Let no one fancy that we refer to this in the spirit
of business rivalry, for we do not. The advance in
circulation and business which The Call has made is
sufficient proof that the reading public turns in dis
gust from a faking pretender to a newspaper which
treats them in good faith. Our object in calling at
tention repeatedly to the Examiner's lies and swagger
i? to protect the public against adulterated news, just
as we would in its interest expose swill milk and adul
terated food.
The time should come soon when the law will
punish severely the publication of invented news or
invented rumors of news. Pepper adulterated with
ground cocoanut shell, ginger stretched with corn
meal, coffee sophisticated with chicory and chicory
with carrots, are harmless frauds compared with the
injury that may follow a public opinion based on the
invented and lying news of which Mr. Hearst is a per
sistent purveyor.
The Call told its readers that its account of Dewey's
battle in Manila Bay was by an eye-witness. Imme
diately Hearst pretended to publish an account by his
eye-witness. He was promptly exposed as a liar by
the Chicago Record.
By contrast with this act of bad faith and deception
of its readers The Call is able to prove the extent and
reliability of its news service and its wide distribution
out of Dewey's official report of the battle of Manila
Bay in which the rear-admiral says that, being short
of officers, the Herald-Call correspondent, Mr. Stick
ney. a retired officer of the navy, being on the flag
ship in the interest of the papers he represents, volun
teered as aid and rendered efficient service.
The Call told the truth, as usual, and Hearst lied, as
usual, and now tries to cover the deficiencies of his
news service by brag and swagger.
The rule, false in one, false in all, holds good, es
pecially as to newspapers. Hearst has been caught
lying and inventing news so often that nothing which
appears in his papers is credible unless verified by
some decent authority.
Judge Wallace is to be commended for having
sent up for life some more of the murderous criminals
who make a business of robbery and do not draw the
line at killing. At times there may have been a ten
dency to criticize this jurist for the sererity of his sen
tences, but thoughtful people have noticed that he
has managed to seriously cripple the footpad in
dustry.
Once more comes the cheerful information that the
Cadiz fleet has sailed. Also that it will divide and go
in two different directions. No details are given as
to the direction of either section, but it is safe to as
sume that it will not be one having a tendency to lead
toward any American guns.
Officials at Washington are said to be resting se
cure in the belief that our marines in Cuba are safe.
However, it is not the condition of the officials which
particularly concerns the people of this country. Their
anxiety is still for the marines.
Admiral Camara is reported to be "acting
strangely" â a delicate intimation that he is getting
daft. To be a Spanish admiral in these times is
enough to drive a tolerably strong mind to collapse.
Rumor that the Spanish contemplate experiment
ing with a poisonous shell is probably v..true. All
the deadly gas that country is able tc generate is
consumed in the making of speeches.
GERMANY AND ThjE PHILIPPINES.
I I ERR YON HOLLENBEN, German Embas
j j sador at Washington, has with due formality
* assured the Secretary of State there is no truth
in the rumors that Germany intends to interfere with
the American Government in the Philippines. The
Einbassador is quoted as having stated, further, that
hi? Government is fully determined to maintain an at
titude of strictest neutrality toward both belligerents
during the war.
While the rumors of a possible interference on the
j/art of any nation in Europe with the conduct of the
war have never seriously disturbed the American
people, it is just as well to have them effectually dis
posed of by denial from the highest official sources.
The rumors with respect to Germany had their origin
in the tone of certain German newspapers, and so long
as they go unrefined they have a tendency to irritate
the pubiic mind and to create in the United States a
feeling of suspicion toward the Germans which is
unjust and unwarranted. There are a few people in
that country made sore by the competition of Ameri
can products in German markets who would like to
fight us, but they are but a small minority.
When the war with Spain began Bismarck declared
the German Government should be careful to main
tain a policy of action which would keep Germany in
touch with the sympathies of Germans in America
in order that the natural affections of the emigrants
for the fatherland might not be alienated and their
trade lost. Now the Germans in the United States
are as loyal as any other class, and certainly would
not regard with favor any action tending to hamper
us in the conduct of the war or to interfere with our
enjoyment of all the fruits of victory we may choose
to seize and hold.
As a matter of fact since the first effort made to or
ganize a European concert for the purpose of pre
venting the war there has never been a sdrious inten
tion on the part of any statesman in Europe to inter
fere with it. The reception given by our Government
to the very suggestion of interference showed clearly
it would not be permitted. If anything more had been
needed than the action of our own Government to put
an end to schemes of that kind it would have been
furnished by the attitude taken by the British Govern
ment and the utterances of the British people. In
terference has never been imminent at any stage of the
contest.
A concert of European powers successfully inter
fered to dictate terms of peace between Japan and
China and between Turkey and Greece. There is a
vast and mighty difference, however, between any
of those nations and the United States. What may
have been wisdom in the one case would be folly in
the other. The American eagle is now in the full
career of his fierce swoop upon the foe, and it will
fare ill with any one who may undertake to stop him
in the middle of his course.
PROMOTIONS IN THE NAVY.
AS a recognition and reward for their gallant
service at the battle of Manila President Mc-
Kinley has given the line officers such pro
motion as lay in his power. In our navy each officer
is assigned a number in the naval register, and pro
motion from the lower to higher grades of rank
usually proceeds in regular rotation. The reward be
stowed on the Manila heroes therefore has been that
of giving them a higher rating on the list than they
had before.
The order of the President runs thus: "For ad-
vancement for conspicuous conduct in battle, Captain
Frank Wildes to be advanced five numbers, Captain
Joseph B. Coghlan to be advanced six numbers, Cap
'â  tain Charles V. Gridley to be advanced six numbers,
' Captain Nehemiah M. Dye - to be advanced seven
numbers, Captrfin Benjamin P. Lamberton to be ad
vanced seven numbers, Commander Asa Walker to
be advanced nine numbers, Commander Edward P.
Wood to be advanced ten numbers."
This advancement on the list of the officers who
were at Manila entails of course a corresponding re
duction on the list of those who were not there.
Officers who before the change were in a position to
receive the next promotions have now been super
seded. This is, of course, the fortune of war. Had
they been at Manila they would have gone up higher,
but not having been there they lose the comparative
rank they had, and are to some extent punished for
their absence.
In the course of a few days, however, the officers
of the fleet in the West Indies will have the glory of
destroying the Spanish ships of war at Santiago, and
then it will be their turn to get advancement on the
list. They will be promoted in due order; some five,
some seven, some ten numbers, and thus be put ahead
of Dewey's men. The line officers of both fleets will
then have received promotion in turn, and the next
naval register will show the names of all in just about
the same order of succession they held before the war
broke out. It is a beautiful system and permits of
unlimited promotions without straining.
In the meantime it is notable that no promotion or
advance has been given to the engineer officers of
either fleet. Those who were at Manila have not even
received honorable mention by name. Such pra-se
as has gone to them has been in the nature of com
mendation for the engineer staff generally, and con
fers no distinction on the individuals who managed
the engines of the big ships while Dewey and his
men were fighting.
Hobson, the staff hero of the war, is still at Morro,
and the Government at Washington is still in doubt
what to do for him. If Congress cannot find time to
enact the navy personnel bill and thus settle the Hob
son difficulty, it would seem an easy thing for the
Department of the Navy to adopt for the staff some
such numbered register system as they now have fou
the line. By doing so they could at once promote Hob
son by putting him first on the list for promotion, and
then when some other staff officer does an equal feat
he in his turn could be advanced numbers enough to
put him at the head for a while. There is no unfair
ness in this to anybody. It simply provides promo
tion for the fellows who happen to be there when any
thing is done and stimulates our naval officers to get
there every time.
No German troops will land at Manila. In the
first place nobody has the slightest notion of ordering
them to do so, and in the second place tl ire would
not be room for German soldiers and Americans, too,
and the Americans got there first.
According to ex-Minister Taylor, Spain is "not
ripe for a republic." Spain, it might be added, has
passed the stage of mere ripeness.
Certain of the Spanish soldiers are beginning to ap
preciate the pangs experienced by the condition of
being a reconcentrado.
In the East regulars and volunteers have been fight
ing each other. While this is not brotherly the prac
tice may be valuable.
In the respect of being good only when dead there
is another point of resemblance between the Apache
and the Spaniard.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 18, 1898.
A POLITICAL PARAPHRASE.
ARE the Democratic voters of this city going
to have any voice in their local organization
in the coming campaign? That is a question
which seems to have no answer. The outlook is cer
tainly calculated to discourage an even more desperate
man than the average unwashed voter. There is no
legal machinery by which the people can get control
of the organization. Martin Kelly's beneficent pri
mary election law has been declared unconstitutional
by the Supreme Court, and the band of political pi
rates who have grabbed the Democratic reins are not
of the sort who yield to arguments of justice.
The local Democratic organization is in the hands
of such choice spirits as "Whispering" Gavin Mc-
Nab, "Slough City" Gould and "Tenderfoot" Alford,
with Chris Buckley as patron and adviser. To ap
proach these men with a suggestion that the rank and
file of the party be let into its counsels would elicit a
horse laugh. Everybody knows what a horse laugh
is. It resembles the titter of a donkey, though
somewhat milder and more genteel.
There is some talk that the dissent from the auto
cratic rule of these political brigands will result in an
"open primary," at which the rank and file will be
permitted to choose their rulers, but this is mostly a
phantom. Boss McNab will never let the people in
on his combination. The "whispering" schemer knows
a good thing when he sees it. Having the Dem
ocracy of San Francisco under his thumb, he will keep
it there.
Besides, an "open primary," under the auspices of
the manipulators who, through the Democratic State
Committee, have wrenched the local organization
from its proud position of a popular party, would be
in the nature of an insult. What sort of an "open
primary" would they hold? How could the people
hope to overcome Boss McNab's heelers and get in
their votes? On the whole, we are not certain but the
"trustees" of the local Democracy are conferring a
favor upon the public by refraining from an "open
primary." If they should put their toughs against the
toughs of Major Harney and Colonel Rainey there
would certainly be carnage and bloodshed. Perhaps
they ought to be commended for their forbearance.
Their methods are raw and uncultured, it is true, but
a subverted and bamboozled Democratic party is
better than a bloody "open primary." which could
result in nothing but the triumph of Bosses McNab,
Gould and Alford.
But how is the rank and file of the Democratic
party going to get a hearing in this city this year?
How is the majority to make its wishes respected?
Must the local party continue to be ruled by three
usurping bosses, whose reputations, if condensed into
one, would bring less in the open market than $i â
the value placed upon Martin Kelly's in Judge Dain
gerfield's court the other day? In other words, how
can the Democracy be wrested from the grasp of
these political garroters and restored to the people?
That is the fuming question of the hour.
The Republicans are going to hold an open primary
for the election of delegates to State and municipal
conventions, at which their people will be allowed to
The outlook indicates that the Democrats will
have to wait until these conventions make their nomi
nations and then vote the entire Republican ticket.
There will probably be no other way to dislodge the
"whispering" boss and his gang.
WHEN with the news of Dewey's victory there
came the announcement that not an American
ship had been seriously injured and not a man
in the fleet had been killed there was a feeling of
some surprise. It had not been expected the Span
iards would show themselves as expert as the Ameri
cans, but it was thought they could fire with sufficient
accuracy to hit a ship steaming within comparatively
close distance of their land batteries.
Further experience with Spanish artillerists in the
West Indies has made us altogether contemptuous
of their fire. With the exception of the Winslow no
American ship has suffered in the least from either
their shot or their shells. With this evidence of in
accuracy before us it was still believed, however, that
the Spaniards would prove themselves to be danger
ous foes when the battles became a question of rifle
shooting. The aiming of a big gun to hit a target
more than a mile away is a matter of mathematical
calculation rather than of clear eyes and steady hands.
The Spaniards are not eminent in science, or in the
handling of complex mechanism, and their failure to
use their modern artillery with success is therefore
readily explained. Rifle-shooting within ordinary
range, however, is a matter of hand and eye, and it
is not easy to understand why the Spaniards have
failed with that weapon almost as completely as with
the bigger gun.
For days past Spanish bushwhackers have sur
rounded the American marines landed at Guantanamo
Bay. Their attacks from the underbrush were car
ried on almost continuously, but the number of Amer
icans killed has been comparatively few. The mo
ment our troops advanced the enemy scattered and
ran away. Their shooting was utterly ineffective, and
it looks as if any American killed in the campaign
might just as well have his death recorded as the re
sult of an accident as a fatality of the battle-field.
Clearly the Spaniards are not up to the needs of
modern war. They have as good rifles as any in the
world. In fact some authorities consider their
weapons better than our own. They cannot use
them, however, half as well as some semi-barbarous
tribes. The American Indian is a better shot than
the Spaniard, and the Pathan of the mountains of
Hindostan is so far superior to him as to make the
comparison ridiculous. The Spanish race, in fact,
seems to be as degenerate as the Government. When
a people lose the power to shoot straight with a rifle
they are out of the race for supremacy in any part of
the world.
So far, Alfred Overend Esq. has hanging over him
fines aggregating $1500, because he refuses to talk
in court. While this appears to be a fair start to
ward the accumulation of an interesting set of lia
bilities there is no telling what he may yet accom
plish by persistence. The world is full of contra
dictions anyhow. Within a few days a man has
been fined in court for having talked too much.
The Montana soldier wh. smote an individual for
presuming to shout for Spain was not fined when he
reached the Police Court, and he did not deserve to
be. Of course anybody who desires has a right to
shout for Spain, but the propriety of going to Spain
to do it is too evident to need pointing out.
Perhaps the Vizcaya was not hit by any American
shell, but if she was there is no use telling anybody
that no damage was done. Spanish optimism is
giving us more things to believe than an ordinary
faith can accept.
General Miles is again in Washington, and a short
hand report of the remarks which pass between the
President and himself would be read with great in
terest.

BEFOKh enlisting for the war I sat me
down and thought
Of all the dreadful things with which
the service might be fraught.
And weighed with most exacting care
the dangers I would face.
And thought that I could meet them all
with uncomplaining grace.
I thought that when I'd reach the front and
checked the lengthy list.
Not one soul-trylni? hardship from the sched
ule would be missed.
But here In these Pacific sands, anear the Bob

I find one I had overlooked, the California
flea.
We never kneel to pay our "Now-I-lay-me
aown" at night
Without the nuisance Joining with an aggra
vating bile.
And while our thoughts we try to fix upon
the throne of grace.
They're rare to drift In sinful way toward the
other place.
We scratch and r>ray and pray and scratch In
alternating wry.
And ask forgiveness for the things we're
tempted sore to say,
Ami often feel like asking the good Lord above
why he
Created such a creature as the California flea.

GIVE HONOR TO GRIDLEY.
Editor of the San Francisco Call: While
much has been said of the heroic achieve
ment of Admiral Dewey at Manila and
honors have been paid the living hero,
would it not be well to pay a tribute to
a dead hero as well? Captain Charles V.
Grldley fought through that battle while
in a dying condition, and a? earthly praise
can no more affect him we can at least
honor his memory. 1 suggest, and be
lieve all patriotic citizens wal join me in
the suggestion, that Point Lobos avenue
be renamed Gridley avenue, as a slight
testimonial of the people of this city to
the bravery of one who considered his
country more than his life.

A QUESTION FOR DEMOCRATS.
Editor San Francisco Call: On July 31.
1789, Congress passed the first revenue
law. The act was strongly recommended
by Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of State,
on the ground that the same would fur
nish money for the support of the Gov
ernment and furnish protection to Ameri
can labor against foreign competition.
Now what connection is there oetween
Thomas Jefferson, the father of American
protection, and Thomas Jefferson whom
the free trade Democrats claim as the
father of their party?
S. ROSENBATJM.
San Francisco, June 17, 1898.
WE HAVE CONQUERED.
As a historian has said, the collective
intelligence of troops appears ln # the sus
tained accuracy of their fire. Accuracy
in gunnery is an intellectual accomplish
ment. An army may have bravery, dis
cipline and endurance, but it falls short
of the supreme point of efficiency if it
cannot reach and maintain this sus
tained accuracy. Especially is the rule
apparent in these days of rapid-fire
weapons, when a successful charge of
mere bravery is almost impossible
against well-armed troops; and when
certainty of long-distance fire is the ele
ment which will determine battles and
campaigns. In the American army and
navy Is by far the highest proportion of
first-ciass marksmen that can be found in
the world. Our regular army, almost to
a man, is composed of what abroad would
be called good military marksmen; and
more than half of the total force repre
sents what even in Germany would be
graded as sharpshooters.
The invitation of the Czar of Russia to
the Cramps and to Mr. Scott of San
Francisco is nothing less than an admis
sion that in the art and mechanics of
naval construction America has passed
ahead of European countries.
Whether we hold Cuba, Porto Rico and
the Philippines is a great question in the
world's diplomacy. A far greater ques
tion has been settled in lull sight of a
watching world â America is a nation to

will have a new respect for himself and

FUTURE OF THE PACIFIC.
The prediction that the coming century
will see the bulk of the world's commerce
on the Pacific Ocean may not be realized.
There are facts connected with the race
and climate and disposition that seem to
mark the shores of the North Atlantic
as the abiding seat of supreme empire.
For two thousand years they have been
so, and there are as yet no symptoms of
decay. On the contrary, the strongest
vitality and most triumphant energy are
still centered there, with a promise of
long remaining. Nevertheless, the com
merce of the Pacific is increasing enor
mously and bids fair to continue ho 10
do, and there is no room for doubt that
the mercantile nad political importance
of that ocean and its shores will hence
forth be incomparably greater than ever
before in the known history of the world.
There is on all hands a steady pushing
thither. Great Britain has built a railroad
across the North American continent for
the express purpose of promoting Pacific
trade. Russia is building one across Si
beria for the same purpose. The chief ef
forts of European powers for months
have been to open new ports and gain
new points of vantage on the Pacific
coast of Asia. Germany has entered the
competition. France is making all possi
ble efforts for the upbuilding of her em
pire on the Pacific. The wonderland of
Japan is advancing by leaps and bounds.
To-day more than half of the world's
population is dwelling in the lands which
look upon the Pacific Ocean. What pos
sibilities of commercial development are
there!
And of all nations directly bordering
upon the Pacific this is by far the great
est. Other great nations have colonies
there; we have our own home domain.
Great Britain has vast colonies upon its
shores and islands, but she herself Is
thousands of miles from Pacific waters.
So is France. So is Germany. Russia is
connected with that ocean only by thou
sands of miles of half-settled and half
inhabitable country. But we abut direct
ly upon it with some of our richest home
territory. There is nature's warrant for
declaring that this should be the fore
most of all Pacific Ocean powers.â New
York Tribune.

'â  carrying United States mail may receive
letters just prior to the sailing of the ves
sel, but such letters must be inclosed In
government stamped enrelopes. Letters
I upon which stamps are affixed will not be

FATHER MARQUETTEâ O. A. 8.. Gil
roy, Cal. Father Jacques Marquette, born
1637, died 1675. was one of the most noted
of the pioneers of France In the New
World. He was born in Laon, France,
where he entered the Jesuit order. In
1666 he emigrated to Canada. In the
course of his missionary work among the
Indians in the Great Lakes region he
made various explorations. He founded a
mission at Sault Sainte Marie and one at
Mackinaw. Marquette and Joliet in 1673
made a long journey by canoe by way of
the Illinois river to the Mississippi and
down that stream to Arkansas. Of this
voyage Marquette left a journal. The nert
year he built a log hut on the present site
of Chicago. He then moved to Kaskaskia
and while laboring among the Illinois In
dians he was taken sick and died. His ex
plorations and notes thereon were of great
value. He has been honored by reason of
his discoveries. This department is un

men as rapidly as possible, under the
direction of Major Long, the depot
quartermester, who is rushing the
coal and supplies on board in the ex
pectation of having this work com
pleted by next Wednesday. The ex
act date of sailing has not yet been
fixed, but it will probably be not
later than the end of next week.
The commissary officers of the va
rious commands have been instructed
to report to Colonel Baldwin, chief
commissary, what supplies are neces
sary to be taken on rboard the trans
ports. When the news of the assign
ment of the troops for this expedition
became known in Camp Merritt there
was general rejoicing, both among the
officers and men. Everybody bright
ened up at once, and Intense enthu
(jlaem jprevalled, even among tnose wi"Â»
were not named, as the latter knew
that with the departure of the third
fleet their turn is not far distant.
General Merritt and his staff may
sail with this expedition. He has had
the matter under consideration for
some little time, and as he is very anx
ious to depart he is making every ef
fort to so arrange his affairs that he
can go. He will probably make public
his decision to-day. At least all the
expeditionary officers at army head
quarters are expecting it, and are ac
cordingly getting everything in readi
ness for embarkation.
Mnjor R. E. Thompson, chief signal
officer of the expeditionary forces, will
sail with General Merritt, and is now
preparing to take his departure at an
hour's notice. The signal corps is yet
lacking in its required quota of expert
telegraph operators, who will perform
an important part in the conquest and
government of the Philippines. Fif
teen are coming from St. Paul, to be
followed by others from other Eastern
cities. Major Thompson will leave an
officer in San Francisco to enlist men
for the corps and forward them, to
gether with necessary supplies, to Ma
nila.
Mnjor General Otis will arrange the
details of the fourth expedition, and
will probably remain here until all the
troops are embarked. It Is hoped to
accomplish this on or before July 1.
SAN FRANCISCO FALLS
TO TENNESSEE'S TROOPS
The Soldiers From the South Cap
ture the Glty Without a
Struggle.
To the strains of "Dixie" the First
Tennessee Volunteer Infantry, carrying
proudly aloft "Old Glory," marched
off the ferryboat at the foot of Market
street yesterday morning amid the
wildest enthusiasm .s that haa greeted
any body ;of troops yet. ;It was > the

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 18, 1898.
the Intrepid Southern legion answered
cheer for cheer tears dimmed many an
eye at the uniooked for demonstration
of brotherly love.
It was more than a mere greeting to
an incoming regiment. It was a tribute
of affection from a liberty loving peo
ple for their brave brothers of a distant
State. Commuters forgot their business
affairs and lingered at the depot to
join in the demonstration; women and
children found their fluttering hand
kerchiefs such a feeble means of ex
pressing their feelings that they joined
in the hurrahing with all the vim of
their lungs.
The magnificent band of the Fifty
first lowaâ the finest at Camp Merrittâ
offered its services to the ladies of the
Red Cross Society for the occasion, a"
compliment the officers and men from
Tennessee keenly appreciated and ex
pressed their appreciation by heartily
cheering e\ ry selection played.
The regiment crossed the bay by bat
talions, the first arriving at 6:45 a. m.
and the other two following at inter
vals of half an hour. The regular pas
sengers were permitted to pass off the
boat first and as the guns of the troops
appeared the lowa band struck up
"Dixie." The cheer that went up from
civilians and soldiers has seldom been
equaled. The boys in blue had heard
of the noble work at the Red Cross So
ciety and were anticipating some sort
of a reception upon their arrival in San
Francisco, but the greeting they re
ceived was beyond anything they had
dreamed of. Proudly they marched out
to the pier where arms were stacked
and accoutrements unslung and before
they had time to cease wondering what
it was all about the band struck up
"Marching Through Georgia" and the
men entered the dining-room, the
guests of San Francisco's band of
heroic women. While they ate the band
played several selections for their en
tertainment and the ladiesâ after the
men had fairly mutinied against being
forced to eat any moreâ decorated the
brave fellows with garlands of flowers.
While they were yet in the dining
hall "Dixie" rang out again followed
by another ~reat cheer and the second
battalion marched into the depot. Then
there was more cheering, in which the
Tennesseeans were the principal per
formers. T*.e first battalion cheered the
ladies of the Red Cross and then rushed
out to cheer their comrades and tell
them what was in store for them. The
second battalion answered with cheers
loud and piercing. They were escorted
into the dining hall and were at once
taken In hand by their hostesses.
Colonel Smith and his field and staff
officers, who came over with the sec
ond battalion, were made captives by a
score of pretty girls who hardly gave
them a chance to satisfy their appe
tites so eager were they to transform
the warriors into animated flower gar
dens. Finally a detachment of (Jrand
Army men charged and effected the
rescue of the gallant old colonel and
stood guard around him until he was
called forth by his subordinates to ex
press the thanks of his command to
its entertainers. This he did in an ad
dress brimming with patriotism and the
crowd In the dining hall and the greater
throng outside cheered him to the echo.
For the third time "Dixie" started the
crowd toward the ferry slip and soon
the third battalion marched up and
stacked arms. Their reception was a
repetition of that accorded the others,
Bwhen the last man had been fed
adorned J. B. Stetson mounted a
S and called en the men from Ten
ee to give three cheers for Presi
dent McKinley. Twelve hundred throats
sent up a shout, the like ot which has
never before been heard in the Golden
State. As it rose clear and ear-splitting
men who wore the blue a third of cen
tury ago started involuntarily, for
again they heard the cry that often
they had heard on the battle fields of
years gone by, the cry that warned
them of the coming of the foe with re
sistless force and fury.
Calls for vocal volleys for Dewey, for
Sampson, for Hobson and the other
heroes brought forth that same thrilling
whoop and then Colonel Smith took
Mr. Stetson's place and called upon his
men to give three cheers for the ladies
of the Rod Cross Society. The call w.-:s
responded to with a shout, better
likened to a scream, louder more thril
ling, more piening than all that had
preceded it. That yellâ the famous old
rebel yellâ has made many a Saxon
foeman quail in the past; if it ever
rings out over the forests and glades of
the distant Philippines it will rout the
Spanish hosts without firing a shot.
San Francisco's door swings wide to
the sons of Tennessee.
There was one member of the regi
ment who made a greater hit with thÂ«
people than even Colonel Smith. That
was "Zeke," the mascot. "Zeke" is a
diminutive warrior of 13 years, who
has been formally adopted by the com
mand. His home is in Nashville,
where his parents reside. "Zeke,"
whose other name is Carsey, has been
a camp follower of the First Trnnes
see for three years, and is a general
favorite with officers and men, mainly
because of his ready wit and his su
perior musical abilities. As a piccolo
player "Zeke's" superior, even among
professionals, would be hard to find.
He is an expert drummer and picks the
banjo and thrums, drums or blows a
half dozen other instruments. "Zeke"
traveled across the continent in the
colonel's car and was a constant source
of entertainment to the officers. His
mother gave her consent to his accom
panying the regiment and "Zeke" will
go through to Manila with it, for he is
only happy when with "the boys."
When the Third Battalion landed at
the ferry one of the companies brought
over a prisoner in the person of the col
ored porter of one of the Pullman cars
in the section. The regiment drew
two months' pay the day it loft Nash
ville and the men were hurried on
board theÂ» cars without being given an
opportunity to spend a cent of the (38,.
000 they had burning holes in their
pockets. Some of the boys developed
a thirst as arid as the desert they
crossed in Nevada, but as they were
under strict military discipline they
had no chance to get past the guards
when the train stopped and soak up
their throats. . In their distress the oc
cupants of the car pressed the porter
into service and at Reno he loaded up
with several pocket flasks. He was
caught in attempting to smuggle the
supplips into the car and was kept in
close confinement all the rest of the
trip. It was intended to take him out
to camp and court-martial him, but
word was telegraphed to the superin
tendent of the Fuilman Company in
this city, who met Colonel Smith at the
ferry and finally secured the porter's
release, much to that dusky individ
ual's happiness.
The regiment formed in lines soon af
ter 9 o'clock and, preceded by the I.,wa
band, started out to camp. Market
street was alive with people who cheer
ed the troops to thf> echo. Factory
whistles were turned loose, firecrackers
popped all along the line, while the
cannon in the Claus Spreckela
building boomed out a thunder
ous welcome. Camp was reached
shortly before nohn and the Ten
nesseeans were given another rous
ing reception by their comrades in
arms as they marched to the lot for
merly occupied by the First Colorado.
Tents were pitched and by night the
command was comfortably settled.
All the requisitions for quartermaster
stores and ordnance were turned into
the Government a month ago, and the
redment eXDects to be eauiDDed. in time
to go out on the fourth expedition.
Every member is anxious to get to the
front at the earliest possible moment
and all it needs is its equipment to
make it one of the most effective regi
ments in the whole volunteer service.
It is a finely drilled command and has
seen some hard service, having sup
pressed the Cold Creek strikes in the
East Tennessee Mountains in 1592, a
campaign that lasted for many weeks,
during which time the men were often
under heavy fire.
GENERAL MERRiTT'S PLAN
The Commanding Officer De-
cides to Sail With the Next
Expedition.
Something has happened to cause a rush
of preparation for the third Manila expe
dition. The activity at headquarters of
the Department of the Pacific is such that
non-combatants notice that the staff of
ficers have their hands full of business.
The- announcement may be made officially
to-day that Major General Merritt will
sail for the Philippines along with the
next expeditionary force. It was under
stood at headquarters yesterday that he
bad made up his mind to go with the next
fleet. Officer* of his staff begin to take
account of their personal affairs, so that
they may be able to leave at an hour's
notice.
The latest dispatches from Admiral
Dewey report that the native troops sur
round Manila and that the surrender of
the city may take place at any time. The
news comes from Spain that the Spanish
admiral' has sailed for the east. A fleet
leaving San Franc' Sco within the next
ten days would, under fair steaming
speed, be able to reach Manila before the
Spanish squadron now sailing from- Cadiz
get to t lie entrance of Manila har
bor. The commander of the Cadiz fleet
may make i great talk about going up
against Dewey at Cavite, but, judging
future Spanish tactics by the past, it is
Bafe to predict that the Spanish fleet will
seek shelter In Borne island harbor and
threaten the United States transports.
No om In San Francisco or anywhere
else in the country wants to hasten Gen
eral Merriu's departure from our shores,
but the fact is obvious, nevertheless, that
delay in starting will increase the perils
of his voyage. The Monterey, the Charles
ton and the troops under General Ander
son will Kivi* Admiral Dewey a re-enforce
nient. that will enable him to stand off the
Cadiz fleet, but he might not be able to
preveni Spanish cruisers from prowling
around near the entrance of Manila Bay.
General Merritt, in his capacity of Gov
ernor General of the Philippine Islands,
mi^ht l" 1 som#what embarrassed if he
should land ihe better part of his army at
Manila and noi be able to go there himself
tn direct operations in person. The cruiser
i â ;. idelphla, leaving San Francisco with
in the next few weeks, should be abje, un
der pressure, to get to Manila ahead of
the Spanish fleet. T'nder fair conditions,
the Monadnock, leaving here within three
Â;â  -Âiir days, should be able to join the
United States fleet at Cavite before the
Spanish squadron arrives off Manila Bay.
Should the Spanish admiral, after pars
ing through the Suez canal, be able to de
tach from the fleet two or three fast
cruisers and colliers he might be able to
Intercept the fourth expedition from San
Francisi o. Ships of the third expedition
leaving here ;>: ; early as June 25 should
reach Manila before any hostile cruisers
n.'\v passing Gibraltar could intercept
them.

AT FORT POINT.
Sixth Infantry Battalion Placed
on Duty at the High-
Power-Guns.
Commencing with last Thursday night
the guards of the Third United States Ar
tillery at Fort olnt were withdrawn and
their places taken by those from the four
companies of the Sixth California. Majors
Gus G. Grant and R.K. Whitmore are
with tho companies, but the former being
the senior officer is in command;-
The volunteers are all um-er Major Kin
zie of the Third United States Artillery,
who is exceedingly well liked by all the
officers and men of the Sixth.
The health of the volunteers is good,
and they like their new â â¢; location ? much
better than the old camp pround at the
terminus of the Union .street cable line.
The air is much purer and exhilarating,
and the boys have more of a get-up about
them as a result.
Although the boys of. the Sixth are be
ginning to feel that there is no probabil
ity of their being rent to the front, still
they are making the best of the situa
tion and are behaving themselves ad
mirably.
Majors. Grant and Whitmore are pains
taking in seeing that the men under them
are well treated in every respect; and
this feeling for the welfare of the soldiers
is reciprocated by: the latter in a hlgn de

The Third Artillery band is used by the

at Fort Point parade and guard mount
daily. The battalion mounts 35 men at
guard, and the sentry line extends clear
around the fortifications. Ball cartridges
have been issued, and the sentries are in

DR. POTTER HONORED.
The Physician Presented With
a Sword and Pistol by
College Students.
In the presence of nearly 300 students of
the medical department of the University
of California, Dr. Samuel O. L. Potter
was presented with a beautiful sword and
serviceable Colt's revolver for service in
Manila. The presentation of these ar
ticles was a great surprise to the recipi
ent, and was made still greater by the
presence of the faculty of the college.
Dr. Potter some weeks ago severed his
connection with the college to accept a
billet of surgeon in the volunteer army.
That his action was viewed with approval
by his fellow members was shown yes
terday. He was invited to appear at the
college yesterday morning, and on his
arrival, he was escorted to the classroom
by Dr, Winslow Anderson, and followed
by other well-known physicians. As soon
as the door leading to the classroom was
thrown open the students arose in a body
and cheered lustily. Dr. Potter was sur
prised with the reception, but was non
plused when Dr. Hodgehead stepped for
ward and in a speech filled with patriotic
sentiment and encomium, he presented
the weapons to the doctor. In a voice
quivering with emotion and joy Dr. Pot
ter neatly responded, causing more en
thusiasm to fill the hall.
Dr. Potter is well known to people in
this city as superintendent of the Home
for Inebriates, but he is widely celebrated
throughout the United States and Eng
land as the author of several splendid
medical works. He is entitled to the de
grees of A. M., M. D., and is a member
of the Royal College of Physicians of
London. This is not the first time he has
been in the army. When 16 years of age
he enlisted and participated in many bat
tles of the civil war.
WILL DO GUARD DUTY.
The Washington Volunteers
Preparing to Take Charge
of the Bay Posts.
The Washington Volunteers, who have
been ordered elsewhere from Fontana
Barracks, will not move for three or four
days. The Second Battalion, under Lieu-

tenant Colonel Fife, will be the first to
leave, having been assigned to duty at
Angel Island. The First Battalion, under
Major Weisenberger, will take Its depart
ure a day or two later and go into camp
at the Presidio. Notwithstanding this as
signment to guard duty, the Washington
Volunteers still entertain hopes of being
sent to Manila. They are all very anx
ious to go to the front, and should they be
kept here they will be greatly disap
pointed.
The regiment is to be recruited to its
full strength as rapidly as possible, two
recruiting details having been sent to
Washlrgton to visit the most important
towns in that State.
The officers of the two battalions of the
Washington Volunteers spent yesterday
morning in visiting the Union Iron Works
and viewing the ships in course of con
struction there.
PATRIOTIC HELPERS .
Ciaus Spreckels Sends a Hand
some Check to the
Society.
Work with the Society of the Patriotic
Home Helpers is progressing rapidly and
most encouragingly; meetings are held
daily at the headquarters in the Occident
al Hotel and numerous applications for
assistance are received by the ladies of
the society, showing the urgent necessity
of helping those whose only support has
been taken away by the departure of hus
bands and brothers to Manila.
Yesterday the promoters of the society
were delighted to receive the following
letter from Claus Spreckels:

ORDERED TO EMBARK.
Batteries G and L, Third U. S.
Artillery, Preparing to Go
Aboard the Para.
Batteries G and L of the Third United
States Artillery, having been assigned to
duty in the Philippines, have been ordered
to be in readiness to embark on the City
of Para by next Wednesday.
An interesting event in the way of mili
tary attraction will be the guard mount
music at the Presidio this morning at
11:30 by the mounted band of the Fourth
United States Cavalry Regiment.
The Friday afternoon concert near the
rpÂ«*irlpnce of" the Presidio post command
ant Lieutenant Colonel Morris, attracted
quite a large audience.
It is now believed that the troops of the
Fourth Cavalry, which have been ordered
to Join the Philippine expeditionary
forces will not move from the Presidio
until they go on board ship.
Troop G of the Fourth Cavalry arrived
in San Francisco from Walla Walla at a
late hour last night.
War Incidents.
Twenty-five members of the First Ten
nessee Infantry had to be sent out to
camp in an ambulance. The majority are
convalescing from measles.
Colonel Smith of the First Tennessee
received a telegram yesterday stating
that the detail left behind to recruit the
.regiment up to the maximum had started
for San Francisco with all the recruits
needed.
The patriotic letter carriers of Station
F, Sacramento and Fillmore streets, yes
terday morning flung a handsome new
flag to the breeze over their quarters and
accompanied the ceremony with appro
priate and cleverly conceived exercises,
after the fashion of letter-carriers. The
flag was bought by general subscription
through the efforts of Superintendent Ty
ler's clerk, Ed Sawyer and Carriers Fee
ney, Locke and Hodnel. After the reci
tation of a patriotic selection by Super
intendent Tyler, the colors were raised
midst a burst of cheers and fire crackers,
and the carriers of Station F returned to
their sacks and daily rounds with the
happy consciousness of having about the
handsomest stand of colors that graces
any station in the city.
THE NATIONAL CELEBRATION.
The Executive Committee Is Deter
mined to Live Within the
Appropriation.
The executive committee of the Fourth
of July committee met last night and dis
cussed matters of finance for over two
hours. It is the determination of the
committee to remain within the $3000 ap
propriation of the Supervisors and not
solicit outside subscript-ions..
The committee decided to allow $500 for
a pyrotechnic display on the prounds op
posite the Chutes. The managers of the
Chutes and the railroad officials will, in
addition, contribute $300 to the fund.
The regatta committee was voted $320
to be spent in the purchase of medals.
Estimates of the expenses to be in
curred by the several sub-committees
were received and it is believed that the
celebration can be conducted in a proper
manner with the money appropriated by
the city. The heaviest expense to be in
curred will be that of music, and on mo
tion of Fred Raabe, chairman of the mu
sic committee, it was decided that none
but union musicians be employed.
A BOUSING CAMPFIRE.
Anniversary of the Battle of Bunker
Hill Observed in an Enthu
siastic Manner.
The anniversary of the battle of Bunker
Hill was celebrated last evening by the
veterans of the war of IS6I-65 of Lincoln
Post No. 1 and Garfleld Post No. 34, De
partment of California and Nevada, Grand
Army of the Republic. The celebration
was in the form of a campnre tendered
to the young volunteers of 1898, and was
held in B'nai B'rith Hall, 121 Eddy street.
Th? chairman of the committee was C.
Tennessee Volunteers Pitching Tents at
Camp Merritt,
Mason Kinne, who presided over the as
sembly in a very happy manner. There
was quite a large attendance and much
enthusiasm and merriment was caused
by the very enjoyable programme, which
was made up of a pleasing variety of
songs, stories and addresses, all of a
patriotic character, by General W. H. L.
Barnes, General N. P. Chipman, General
E. S. Salomon, Judge H. C. Dibble, Colo
nel W. R. Smedberg and others, among
whom were several officers and enlisted
men from Camp Merritt. Eight long ta
bles were filled with an abundance of
edibles of all kinds donated by the gener
ous merchants of San Francisco. It was
a very inviting spread and was appre
ciated by the guests. The Firemen's band
was in attendance and discoursed patri
otic music at frequent intervals through
out the evening.
JjABOB COUNCIL WAKING UP.
It Is Considering Plans to Materially
Increase Its Usefulness.
The Labor Council is at present dis
cussing ways and means to increase its
income and decrease its expenses. As
things stand at present the average
monthly income Is about $40, which is
eaten up regularly by the expense roll,
leaving nothing for the proverbial rainy
day. and interfering with any new work
which tly; council desires taking up, but
which may require an expenditure. At
present there is nothing in the treasury.
Several propositions were considered,
among which was that of increasing the
membership roll. There are several un
affiliated unions in the city, and while
the council has an organizing committee
it has done very little toward bringing
them in. The organizing committee will
be thoroughly stirred up and a little new
blood introduced.
A committee from the Building Trades
Council was admitted and brought up the
subject of the celebration of Labor day.
Mr. McCartney outlined a plan of the two
bodies holding a joint picnic at Schuet
zen Park during the day and suitable ex
ercises in some public hall at nlghi. A
committee consisting of J. Hill. E. Ro
senberg, W. Mac Arthur M. Davis, Carle
ton H. Johnson, E. L. Clapp and J. Wal
ter was appointed to act in conjunction
with the Building Trades committee in
making arrangements for the celebra
tion.
The executive committee reported that
a imion of photo-engravers has been or-
ganized, and that it will probably afflliata
with the council.
The Musicians' Union reports that it
has been unable to induce the Danish
societies to cancel the contract with the
non-union band engaged to play at their
coming picnic.
LAWLER'S RIFLE
MEANT MISCHIEF
A. DESPERATE MAN IN THE MIS
SION HOLDS A POSSE AT BAY.
He Was Finally Cowed and Tamely
Submitted to Ar
rest.
What came near being another Mission
tragedy was fortunately averted yester
day afternoon by the courage of a posse
of police officers from the Seventeenth
street station. In this case the antagonist
of the police was as well if not better
armed than was Murderer Hines, who
6hot the late Lieutenant Burke.
The trouble, which had Its origin
in the domestic quarrels of a family
named Lawler, came near ending in
bloodshed at the residence of the
family at 2545 Seventeenth street, near
Potrero avenue, yesterday afternoon, when
Police Officer George Farreli was sent by
Lieutenant Price to serve on Lawrence
Lawler a warrant which had been sworn
out by his brother Joseph for disturbing
the peace.
When Farrell arrived at the house and
made his business known he was met by
the man for whom he had the warrant
armed with a 44-caliber rifle and a belt
about his waist with 100 cartridges se
curely In their places ready for use.
Armed in this way, he stationed himself
at the head of the stairway and notified,
the officer that he would "kill the first
man that attempted to lay a hand on.
him.
Not desirous of being- made an angel,
Farrell retired to the nearest police alarm
box and notified Lieutenant Price of the
situation. Price called Sorgeant Blank
and Officers Feeny and Riehl. and with
the patrol-wagon dispatched them to the.
scene. A hurried consultation was held
by the invading force, and it was decided
to storm the house and bring Lawler in
dead or alive. After the officers got in
side they pulled their pistols and dashed
in, regardless of danger. The armed man
still stood his ground at the head of the
stairs, with his rifle pointed at the ap
proaching officers, and renewed his threat
of making work for the Coroner if any of
the men approached him. In the mean
time his sisters came upon the scene and
implored the officers not to shoot. This
to a certain extent pacified their brother
and gave the officers a chance to slip past
him on the stairway and disarm him.
Afterward he was handcuffed and thrown
into the wagon and locked up on the
charge of an attempt to commit murder
and disturbing the peace.
When questioned regarding his resisting
arrest he said that his brother had
threatened to have him thrown out by
the police, and he was determined to re
sist until his rights were adjusted.
Since the death of the father of this
family of ten children there has been con
siderable bickering and quarreling over
the property left them by the old man, as
he made no will. The eidest brother,
Joseph, was appointed executor of the
estate, and his brother claims that he has
made no attempt to sell or dispose of it
for the purpose of dividing it between the
heirs. Lawrence holds a note from his
brother Joseph for $ISS, which sum he
wanted for the purpose of going to the
Klondike, so as to be away from his un
pleasant surroundings.
WATEB FOR YOUNTVILLE.
The Hand Pump and Windmill Will
Soon Be Things of the Past.
The handpump and windmills in Yount*
ville will soon be things of the past, aa
that neat little township will have an.
abundant water supply before many
months. The Supervisors of Napa County
have Just granted a franchise to J. K.
Prior of this city for the purpose of run
ning mains along the county road and
through the streets of Yountville from hia
40,000-gallon reservoir which stands about
5000 yards from the site of the town. In
addition to this, the Supervisors have en
tered into contracts with ten parties to
sprinkle the county road from Napa to
Calistoga. the distance being snbdivided
into ten sections. Prior obtained one of
the sectionsâ that near Yountville, where
he has an abundant water supply to fur
nish the entire road sprinkling, besides
the supplying of the township with what
may be necessary.

Union Coursing Park is rapidly advanc
ing to the front in popularity, and doubt
less it will soon be. recognised as the
great Inclosed coursing demesne of Amer
ica. To-day the much looked for cham
pionship stHÂ«\.e will be contested, and
apart from this popular event a 72-dog
stake will afford pleasure seekers no end
of enjoyment.
A year ago to-uay 32 dogs were deemed a
largo number to run In any one week.
To-day 132 are not unusual. At Union
Park a non-winner stake and a champion
event Is being run off. The sport at both
parks will open at the usual hour and
continue through to-morrow.
The champion stake at Union Park
looks to be another for For Freedom.
Massey's Eastern dogs should be heard
from at Ingleside again this week. Mas
bey land>d second and fourth last week.
The two parks appear to have changed
many dogs Ui.b week. Non-winners at
ooch have figured as stake dogs at the
other.

THE FIELD OF SPORT.
OARSMEN HARD
AT WORK
FOR EL CAMPO.
All lovers of oarsmanship are looking
forward with interest to the special cham
pionship match race between William Me-
Causland of the Ariel Rowing Club and
Alex Pape of the Dolphin Boat Club
on Sunday, June 26. The race should be
an interesting one.
The match in barges between the senior
and the German crews of the Ariel Row
ing Club at the regatta last Sunday was
so unsatisfactory in its results that the
two crews will have another race.
In general comment upon the crews in
all the harpes last Sunday it may be
said that they lack uniformity of style:
the men do not swing evenly and stralgrht
ly back and forth; they are slow in get-
ting out their hands, and there is little
or no "catch" at the beginning of the
stroke. The lack of 'catch," however,
is, doubtless, to be attributed to the
weight of the barges, which do not re
spond quickly to the oarsmen's efforts, and
so lack "life." All the men seem to have
been put on slides before they had learned
to row on fixed seats, and the lack of
uniformity of style is attributable to in
sufficient and imperfect coaching. If one
of the barge crews, with its lack of even
swing and watermanship, were put into
a racing four-oar, the boat would roll
to such an extent that the men would
never feel sure of getting their oars out
of the water at the end of the stroke,
and would be liable to feather under
water. Yet the senior crews of the Ariels
and South Endw, by dint of hard work
and good time, undoubtedly make their
boat travel. These criticisms are made
from the point of view of a man accus
tomed to the perfect nwu g and rhyth
mical uniformity of the Lest eights at
Oxford University and Henley, rowing in
smooth water in the lightest boats. Such
craft could not be used in the rough
waters of the bay, and the comparatively
heavy barge calls for no special degree
of watermanship in the oarsmen. But no
excuse can be offered for the ungainly
action of the outer elbow seen in some
of the rowers; no matter what kind of
craft he is sitting in, the oarsman's el
bows should come close past his sides.
If the regatta committee, of which the
well-known pioneer oarsman J. T. Sulli
van is chairman, can secure a good ap
propriation from the Fourth of July
committee, it is proposed to hold an open
interclub regatta on the Fourth.
Last Sunday the Senior four of the
South End Rowing Clubâ R. McArthur,
stroke; Tom Lynch, afterwaist; Walter
Duplissea, forward waist; Tom Lynch,
bow, and Charles Skelly, coxswainâ w<Â»nt
out for practice; also the Junior barge crew,
consisting of C. Jenkins, stroke; C.
Crc-ighton, afterwaist; I. Williams, for
wardwalst. and W. Fox, bow. J. Pallas
and Mat Breen were out in skiffs, and
\V. Thomas in a shell. W. Fox, of the
champion intermediate crew, is still in
San Jose, convalescent, but not able to
row. Another member of the intermediate
crew. Alec McGeorge, is sick. Walter
DupHssea, of the "Irish" barge crew, has
Joined Battery G, Third Artillery and is
now at the Presidio; the two Lynches
have aleo intimated their intention of en
listing in the regular army. It will be
necessary for the South End Club to or
ganize new senior, intermediate and jun
ior crews; G. Carson and F. Duplissea
will be the nucleus of the senior crew.
The sculler. Dr. C. C. Dennis, is not
seen round the boathouse now at all;
and J. 8. Foley, last year's junior skiff
champion, may enter the senior skift race
at the El Campo regatta. The South
End Club has received several applica
tion for membership: T. Grennan, W. F.
Murphy, William Otts, the boxer, Frank
Dougherty and F. C. Raymond will be
Initiated at the next meeting. The club
has ordered a new set of barge oars from
the East, and expects to receive tbem
in time for the next regatta.
The Alameda Boat Club needs a new
oarsman to take the place of George
Willis in the junior barge crew. At a
general meeting of the club on Tuesday,
June 14. arrangements were made for get
tine the boats to El Camcu; they, as
well as the oarsmen, will be transported
free.

ALL ABOUT DOGS
AND KENNEL CLUBS
At last the Pacific Coast will place be
fore the American Kertinl Club a proposi
tion to substitute satisfactory rules in
place of the present ones. For the first
time since the objectionable new classi
fication has been in force the opposing
sentiment has crystallized into a definite
plan. At an informal meeting of a few
representative fanciers, convened by the
Verona kennels at Pleasanton on Sunday
last, the following gentlemen were pres
ent: Dr. Fred W. cV Evelyn, J. E. de
Ruyter, J. G. Barker and H. H. Carlton of
San Francisco; C. IX. Harker of San Jose
and Norman J. Stewart of Armona.
It was decided to call a convention for
the first Saturday in July of delegates
from all the kennel clubs on the coast,
each club holding bench shows to send
two delegates and each specialty club one
delegate.
It is proposed to submit to the clubs for
consideration a new classification, to con
sist of:
â Puppy class as at present.
Secondâ Novice class optional at dis
cretion of club holding show, or to be
determined by number of entries in the
breed.
Thirdâ class open to all dogs ex
cept champions.
Fourthâ Premier class, open to dogs
having scored four wins In open class.
Fiftnâ Champion class,, open to dogs
having won three times in premier claaÂ«.'
If these rules meet the approbation of
the convention they are to be submitted
to the A. K. C., with the Indorsement of
all the clubs participating.
In the latter event the rules will be
sent to every club in the United States
that is a member of the A. K. C, and
these will be requested, if they approve
of the rules, to instruct their delegates
to vote for them at the September meet
ing of the A. K. C.
There can be little doubt that the
American Kennel Club will adopt , these
rules, at least for the Pacinc Coast, for it
Is almost a foregone conclusion that if
the proposition be rejected oy. the govern
ing body the coast will carry out its
repeated threat of secession, and this time
It will not be a "house divided against
itself," for the coast is, mirabile dictu, for
the llrst time in its kennel hiÃtory, a
unit on the question.
It will be noticed that under the pro
posed classification a dog will have to
place seven wins to his credit before he
becomes entitled to the championship, but
then he will be exempt from competition
except by his peers.
John 11. Sammi has filed charges with
the A. K. C. against the San Francisco
Kennel Club, In his affidavit he alleges
that his dog Scaldy Mike was wrongfully
entered in the class of bull-terriers" under
35 pounds and that his dog was weighed,
found to be over the limit and was con
sequently thrown out. He avers that the
entry was made by him correctly in the
first place and that the mistake was made
by an official of the show. The misunder
standing arose from an error in the pre
mium list, placing the limit of lightweight
bull terriers at 25 instead of H5 pounds.
Sammi alleges further that John G. Bar
ker, one of the directors of the club, of
fered to award Scaldy Mike the first prize
in the class, but that he (Sammi) refused.
In consequence, Sammi asks the A. K. C.
to cancel the bull-terrier wins and to give
Scaldy Mike first and winners' prizes in
the heavy-weight class.
H. H. Carlton, secretary of the San
Francisco Kennel Club, gives a different
version of the matter. He acknowledges
the error made by the clerk, but claims
that Mr. Sammi should have made his
complaint in writing to the secretary in
stead of to one of the directors. verbally.
I Mr. Carlton says that as soon as the ob
jection was brought to his notice he had
! the judge go over the class as they were
on the benches. The judge, Mr. Bell, saw
no reason for altering his decision in the
slightest, and declared, moreover, that
Scaldy Mike was absolutely dlsqualifled,
having a black patch behind the ear,
while the standard for bull-terriers em
phatically insists that they shall be abso
lutely pure white. -â â¢â¢â â .

BURGEES WILL
FLUTTER
AT McNEAR'S.
On Saturday evening, June 25, the San
Francisco Yacht Club will hold a jinks at
its Sausalito clubhouse, to which all
yachtsmen are invited.
At a meeting of the San Francisco
Yacht Club held on Thursday, June 16, at
the Merchants* Exchange, the following
directors were present: Commodore Dr.
T. L. Hill. Secretary Charles B. Hill. Fi
nancial Secretary W. B. Morrow, Treas
urer R. B. Hogue and Measurer J. M.
Punnett. The secretary was instructed to
write to the secretary of the Pacific In
tcrclub Yacht Association, informing him
that the San Francisco Yacht Club is
prepared to send delegates to the associa
tion. The name of Charles Rieveley was
proposed for memberphlp. The commo
dore stated that the submarine mine area
extends from the Sausalito ferry slip to
a green buoy placed by the United States
engineers, thence to Shag Rock and
thence to Point Cavallo.
Arthur D. Kaylor's sloop Twilight
started from Sausalito at 10:30 a. m. on
Friday, June lv, and reached Napa City
at 5 p. m. the same day. On the 12th she
sailed down to Napa, where Arthur
Inkersloy, who had left her at Napa City,
rejoined her. She reached Collinsvllle on
the 13th, Walnut Grove on the 14th and
came down the river to Rio Vista on the
15th.
The San FranclFoo Yacht Club will hold
a regatta at Sausalito on Sunday, June
26 V open to boats belonging to any of the
clubs in the Pacific Interclub Yacht As
sociation. The course will depend upon
instructions received from the United
States engineers charged with the laying
of submarine mines in the harbor, and
will be pointed out to yacht-owners on
the day of the race. Yachts will be divid
ed into four classes; there will be no time
allowances and the first boat to cross the
finishing line will take the first prize.
Entry cards should be filled out and sent
to Secretary C. B. Hill, Merchants' Ex
change, not later than June 21.
The class flags won at the Corinthian
regatta were presented last Sunday. The
sloops Clara and iruant went out cruis
ing last Saturday evening. The yawl
Arcturus is out on a two weeks' trip and
E. F. Sager'a sloop Edna is in sailing
trim again.
Andrew Thome, vice-president of the
Corinthians, not having put the yawl
Seven Bells into commission this season,
has sent in his resignation, but the di
rectors will not act upon it until next
month. The sloop Cisne, with W. C.
Howe and L. E. Hart, starts to-day on a
two weeks' cruise.
i.ast Sunday Commodore J. S. Hanley
of the Encinals cruised to Baden in the
sloop Spray, having on board Mr. and
Mrs. John Phelps, Mr. and Mrs. Meredith,
Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Clark, Messrs.
Thomas O'Connor, A. Dayton, Ray Ham
ilton and C. C. Hanley. The sloop Spray,
R. Mitchell's sloop Fawn and C. Thorn's
schooner Fearless will cruise to McNear's
Landing to-day. The sloop Iris left on
the 13th for an up-river cruise. E. K.
Taylor's yawl Emerald, after being reno
vated and overhauled, is now in commis
sion.
T. L. Taylor's sloop Occident now has
her mast and bowsprit in place; when
she is ready to sail a crew will be picked
from the members of the club and a chal
lenge sent in for the Perpetual Trophy,
now held by the Corinthians. B. TV. Rob
son's sloop Volante, formerly of the En
cinals, is now at her moorings near the
California club house and will make her
first cruise of the season to McNear's to
morrow. Allen M. Clay's sloop Sea Fox
recently cmlsed as far as Rio Vista with
J. Ruggles and two friends; she encoun
tered very rough weather and a high sea
In Suisun Bay on her return, coming
down under double reefs. She will cruise
up to Vallejo to-day and come back to
morrow. Thelma has not been out since
the day of the California regatta. Secre
tary O. F. Gaither's \j & I has been
hauled out on the spit and has had her
bottom scraped and painted; she will
start about the middle of July for a two
or three weeks' cruise up the Sacramento
River. Frank Moffltt's launch Augusta
is laid up at Petersen's. W. H. Gould's
sloop Corinne, Carl A. Tarnberg's sloop
Mist, Harry W. Brydges' sloop Hope, A.
R. Wilson's yawl Pilgrim, and W. L.
Prather's launch El Casador were out
last Sunday. The California fleet will
cruise to McNear's this afternoon under
command of Vice-Commodoro G. B. Ed
?ar. The following yachts will probably
ollow the flagship Sappho; Harry w.
Brydges' sloop Hope, E. F. Sager's sloop
Edna. Henry Franklin's yawl Bachelor,
W. H. Gould's sloop Corinne, G. turn Su
den's sloop Regina, A. R. Wilson's yawl

S. Sherman's sloop Royal, and the
launches Ariel and El Casador.
The sloop Surprise is lying off Point
Pinole, A. C. Lee having taken her moor-
Ings out of the creek and dropped them
there; he will probably join to-morrow's
cruise. Port Captain J. J. Sherry's yawl
Gypsle Is off the ways; her spars "will
soon be in, and she will be sailing about
the middle of July.
WHERE TROUT-FISHING
IS NOW ENJOYED
The angling season Is now in full blast
and lovers of the pastime who can afford
a trip to the mountains can count upon
some nice catches of large trout. Latest
reports from the Truckee River are very
good. Messrs Woodford and Williamson
returned from Verdi a few day 6 ago very
well satisfied with four days' sport. They
say that fly fishing from Verdi down is
excellent, but above Verdi and especially
in the vicinity of Boca, the professional
tlshermen have angled bo persistently
that the trout are wary of fly or spoon.
The most killing flies at present are the
March Brown, Gray Hackle, Governor
and Professor.
Of the many lakes in the Sierras the
only lake that is affording first-class fly
fishing is Webber. Anglers who are rus
ticating on this beautiful sheet of water
are having gala sport and the outlook is
very good for large creels of Hsh for sev
eral weeks to come. A big rush to Web
ber Lake is expected during the holidays.
Salmon fishing on the McCloud Is now
first class, but anglers must be rigged
with heavy-weight tackle for this ldnd
of sport, as an hour's battle with a 35
pounder is not uncommon.
Several local anglers are contemplating
a trip to Russian River In July. Good
bass fishing is hoped for.
Mr. La Motte, the manager of the
Uklah trout hatchery, will stock all the
streams on the line of the San Francisco
and North Pacific Coast Railroad this
summer. Excellent fishing is now report
ed from the headquarters of the Big Sul
phur Creek.
It Is hoped that the Fish Commission
ers will teach the Frenchmen who are
cleaning out the small trout of Paper Mill
Creek by means of small nets, a lesson.
The foreigners, under the pretense of
catching frogs, capture everything ani
mate that happens into their alleged frog
nets. A camp composed of idlers Is lo
cated at Libertys, which Is the head
waters of Lapunltas Creek, and illegal
fishing is the dally routine.
BOXING CONTESTS
NEAR AT HAND
In boxing circles the next entertainment
of note will be held by the Excelsior Ath
letic Club In its new hall, 1322 Howard
street, on Monday evening. The athletic
bill of fare consists of limited round con
tests between "Kid" McFadden and Billy
Hogan, Pat Lynch and Joe Kane, "Big:
Joe" Kennedy and Tom Lynch. The
striking features of the evening will be
the eight-round contests between Charles
Reno and J. Riley at 128 pounds, and John
Lahey and Charles Tye at 140 pounds.
A few hours of good sport is assured
all by the orator and president, J. Ken
nedy.
On Tuesday evening the National Club
wilt give its entertainment at Woodward's
Pavilion. McConnell and McKeever are
said to be in fine condition for their
twenty-round contest but the same can
not be said of "Young" Peter Jackson
who has been attending all of the small
fry scrapping matches recently held in
divers parts of this city. Young Peter
is matched to fight Purcell ten rounds
which contest will be decided prior to
the event of the evening. The white man
is training with McKeever near the Cllft
House.
A number of men Interested In athletic*
assembled in Central Park a few even
inga ago and organized a club which they
called the "Mechanics' Athletic Union of
the United States." The officers chosen
are: Oeorge, Miller, vice-president; O
W. Paterson, secretary; D. R. McNeil'
treasurer; Amos G. Allen, financial sec
retary; Thomas D. Carroll, superintend
ent; George Dupllssea, director of aquat
ics. The officers aim to give all kinds of
athletic sports "and mechanical" con
tests, and to establish branches In all of
the large cities of the country. The In

BASKET BALL
EXPERTS
WILL CONTEST.
The basket-ball enthusiasts of San
Francisco and vicinity will have an op
portunity of witnessing local strength
against the crack team from Minnesota.
In Company G of the Minnesota volun
teers the champion basket-ball players
of the State have enlisted in a body, and
are anxious to meet our local teams in
the battle on the slippery floor. The lo
cal Rusher team of the Young Men's
Christian Association will meet the
crark basket-ball players from Minne
sota next Tuesday, June 21, in the asso
ciation's gymnasium, corner of Mason
and Ellis streets. The soldiers have been
utilizing their spare time by constant
practice in the Ellis-street building,
which has been thrown open to their use.
They bear an excellent record, and are
all men of athletic appearance.
During the past season they have met
and defeated the following teams: The
Y. M. C. A. of Minneapolis, which held
the Northwestern championship for five
years; the Minneapolis Agricultural Col
lege; the Minnesota University, and nu
merous smaller teams from athletic clubs
and Y. M. C. A. branches.
The Rushers have also a record which
entitles them to respect. During the
past three years they have played many
games with the best teams in and about
San Francisco. I^st spring they distin
guished themselves by defeating the
Athens team of Oakland after the latter
had administered a bitter defeat to the
crack Business Men's team of San Fran
cisco. This was the first defeat for the
Athens aggregation up to that time and
caused quite a stir in basket-ball circles.
Shaw, Spacher and Keys are a set of
forwards w..0 for quickness of action
and sureness of goal-throwing stand well
in the front of the champions. Fleischer,
center for the Rushers, is well known as
an all-round athlete and gymnast. His
goal-throwing from the center of the
field is something extraordinary, and is
usually productive of one or more sensa
tions in an even display.
Hanrahan, Mitchell and Johnson are
guards of several years' experience, and
they seldom fall to secure the ball from
an opponent at the proper time and then
pass it to the forwards on their own side
by a succession of short and quick
throws.
A great game may be expected on
Tuesday night. The line-up will be as
follows:
Co. G, 13th Minn. Positions. Rushers.
C. Ahlers Forward F. L. Shaw
E. Kappel Forward... E. L. Spacher
Theodore Ek Forward C. Keys
Carl Reckner... Center E. Fleischer

Cnarles Fisher. Guard C. Johnson
Sergeant Charles Burnson will act as
referee. Lieutenant Ed Mellinger as man
ager, H. P. Ritchie as trainer.
TENNIS ROW IS
STILL UNABATED
The war Is on In earnest betweeen the
two factions of tennis playersâ the Whit
neys and their followers and the Oakland
ers under the command of the Hardys
and the antagonistic element in the v-ali
fornia Club of this city, which has of late
opposed the Whitneys in their tennis as
pirations.
Unless something Is done to chansre the
present conditions it looks very much as
if there would be no successful tourna
ment at San Rafael this summer. At
present Bob Whitnc- claims that he is
the only bona-flde president of the Pa
cific Lawn Tennis Association, and Sam
Hardy also claims the same by virtue of
an election held by representatives of the
various clubs on May 31 of this, year
Whitney was the president of the asso
ciation at that time and his contention is
that the election was illegal. Both par
ties have applied for a sanction from the
National Lawn Tennis Association for
the championship tournament In singles
at San Rafael on the Fourth. Time will
alone settle the difficulties of the two
contending factions.
The present week has been productive

CRACK MARKSMEN
WILL MEET
NEXT SUNDAY.
Two of our local marksmen have arÂ»
ranged for a match for next Sunday at
Schuetzen Park. They are D. W. Mc-
Laughlin and A. Strecker. They will
compete for a sociable dinner. The
match Is to be twenty shots at rest, Mc-
Laughlln giving Strecker one point a
shot, on the German 25-ring target. Both,
men have excellent records, but Strecker
astonished the shooters recently by mak
ing 459 out of a possible 500 rings, off
hand. He uses a Winchester through,
which thousands of shots have been fired.
McLaughlin now sports a new barrel
with the Pope rifling, warranted to shoot
center. This match will be of great in
terest to many, as it should show the rel
ative merits of a wril-worn barrel anÂ£
one of the most modern system of rifling.
If Strieker's old standby made 459 off
hand it should crowd 500 at rest. Look
ing at it from this standpoint McLaugh
lin must have great confidence in the new*
rifle barrel when he gives Strecker ona
point a shot in a match of this length.
As stated in these columns last week,
there is great interest in the coming
shooting festival that will begin in New
York on July 3 and last until the 11th.
Every effort will be made to have the
Bund meet in this city at its next festi
val in 1901. There are plenty of men here
who would like to go East, and but few
who will gratify that desire. The ex
pense is great. It is safe to say that of
those who will atttend are J. D. Heiso
and A. Stettin of the San Francisco
Schuetzen Verein. William Ehrenpfort
would go but for the fact that his son
has gone to help Dewey in Manila and
the business would suffer much if both
should leave the city. There is some talk
that a couple of tickets for the trip to
the East, to be competed for, are to be
given by some one who wishes to see
California marksmen at the head of the
list in the world's competition, but this
is not certain yet. There would be some
hot competition in a match for a trip to
the great gathering of riflemen.
There will be considerable rifle shooting
to-morrow at Scheutzen Park, several ol
the large clubs being booked for their
bullseye and monthly medal contests.
At the Shell Mound range a number ol;
clubs will hold forth.
M. J. WH.rJL.fci. ,
TRAP-SHOOTING AT
HOME AND ABROAD
The lovers of animate and inanimata
target shooting will assemble to-day in;
strong force at their respective shooting
grounds. The California Wing Club will
send pellets after live birds at the Ingle
side grounds; the Lincoln Club will misa
and hit blue rocks at Alameda Point,
and the Suisun Gun Club, which is com
posed principally of wild duck stoppers,
will have a live bird shoot "at home."
"Bogie" ODonnell, the mascot of the
club, leaves to-morrow for the scene of
action, and if heavy charges (mixed)
backed up by game bird oratory will win
the day, "Bogie 11 will return crowded
with the laurels of victory.
"If I happen to be successful on Sun
day. -> remarked "Bogie" to a coterie of
friends who listened attentively to his
talks on duck shooting. "I will certainly;
invite the boys of Suisun to a 'tea' lni
the near future."
Dove shooters must remember that ac-Â»
cording to the State law the season fop
killing these birds will not arrive until
July 15, and that some of the counties
have not altered the dates when doves
may be shot. The Supervisors of the dif
ferent counties have the power to shorten
the seasonsâ that is for killing gameâ but
they cannot lengthen them. The season
for shooting deer will also open July 15
according to State law. â

The above table gives tho standing of
the various teams up to date. It will be
noticed that the Gilt Edges lead by no
BniaJl margin and that the other clubs are
bunched together, barring, of course, the
last three, which teams are good teams
and. no doubt, will be with the others'
when ret going properly. The
irprise of all, naturally, is the
standing of the Sand Crabs. They have
won imes out of eight played,
and in &\v. :v Instance were de
ry small margin. It is to
be h. ; they turn around and
get in the race, as the bottom of the list
;''>r them.
Stockton and Fresno will also have to
better ball; Fresnos especially, as
a fast game and should be
right in the race. Their playing while
here was very yellow, much more so J
than their uniforms; yet it was apparent '<
that they were not playing in form, and
this fact must not be overlooked. If this |
chap Earley would refrain from making
a monkey of himself by continually put
ting one h all.l am of theoplnion
that aji Immediate change for the better
would follow. This Btyle of play, coming
from such a good man, tends more to j
demoralize a team I spire it on j
to nobler deeds. If Earley were fined & j
or HO every time he 1 the rules â 
pertaining to tl way to catch a j
baJl it, no doubt, would have the de^irrd
effect. He, however, is not the only of
fender in this line, H. Krug of tl.
Franciscos being a wry close second. To
be more exact, I would say that Earley
and Krug are about on a par when it
comes to being fancy. One-handed catches
are fascinating in the extreme when ac
complished under circumstances that call
for such work; but one-handed catches i
when there is really no occasion for them
are about as disgusting tv? they are in
the other case fascinating. I cannot recall ;
one instance while playing fn tne National i
League where a player put one hand to a '
ball when he could have put two. If he j
should so far forget himself there is no !
doubt in the world but what the crowd i
would hiss him off the field. Some day, in
a close and critical play, Mr.-sr?. Earley
and Krug will fail in the>ir attempts to
be pretty. A game will be lost, and no
pn*> knows wh&i bearing that game might
'â .'. the team's championship chances,
for every game counts, be it at the begin
rfiifi: or end <>f the season. What strikes
me so poruiiarly is the fact that Earley
the only players doing this |
9>.n of work. I cannot account for It;
time I see them promenading ;
visions similar in every detail to those I
â¢ i confront me when gaz
ing â¢: â¢ â¢'blue ribbon darlings"
pass In rapid r-\dew before my very eyes.
r!;irÂ«-ly the bora have not become im
bued with the idea that they are in a
class by tl Jf so there is a sad I
mistake somewhere, for the league con- i
tains m;irty good players and delights in:
Bing of those who have no control i
surroundings. This â 
c of Mr. Pyne, j
who, by the way, has not been heard of I
oing of Bert, Kauer and]
IL Fr>ni the turn affairs have!
I jruess that Pyne is congratulat- :
Ing himself on being; suspended before
irtaln rose, disclosing the secret i
workings of that b - What a
trap they did set for those numer- I
ous r.
I wonder which one of them engineered
the s should be complimented,
I scheme work so beauti- j
fully. The end, i is to r<>me. No
doubt at the next meeting a general mix
up wi md 1 would advise Raver

TROTTING AND PACING.
The Harness Brigade to Meet June 25
at Oakland.
Trotting and pacing races on the run- \
ning plan is the programme of the Pa- i
clfic Coast Trotting-horse Breeders 1 Asso- '
ciation's departure from the old lines. At
a meeting of the association ,held yester- .
day bookmaking privileges were let, and ;
Messrs. Hurlick. Humphreys, Cook and
other well known layers of odds decided
to cut In the first week and make books
on the harness events. Henry Schwartz i
& Co. wjjie awarded the auction pool i
privilege. The Oakland race track, where '
the meeting will open Saturday, June 25, j
is already in possession of the harness '
brigade, and railbirds are in attendance,
getting a line on the green ones, of which
there are many, and the old campaigners, I
of which there are mure.
For the two weeks' racing with which
the association will open its meeting 434
entries have been made, or an average of
about eight entries to each event. There
are BO many applications for stalls that
it is a case of lirst come first served al
ready.
The track is in pi-rfect condition, thanks
to the supervision of William Fleldwick,
and it is already prophesied that records
will be broken tho first week. Azute
(2:04)4), the champion gelding of the
world, is entered in all the free-for-alls.
There will be five dashes and one two-in
thn*e race each day during the meeting,
and in addition a purse will be offered
each week for tne horses owned by mem
bers of the Golden Gate rark Driving
Association of this city.
A professional starter will wield the
flag, and all the arrangements will be
strictly up to date in every particular.
No other harness horse association in
America has announced such a radical
departure from old time methods, and
the prediction is freely made among
horsemen that this will be the most suc
il harness meeting of the year in
America,

and the money so collected will be turned
over to the society as the contribution of
those who appreciate the noble work
they are doing.
It is suggested by the committee that
no money t>e paid ever to any one but an
authorized person or persons showing thÂ«
proper credentials of the Red Cross So
ciety.
The following pentlemen who compose
the committee have been srraclously re
ceived by every one with whom they havo
come in contact, and all give assurances

Resolution of Thanks
by Congress.
TO BE TRANSFERRED TO LINE
AND PROMOTED TO LIEUTEN
ANT COMMANDER.
Captain Ludlow Will Be Sent to
Havana to Negotiate an Ex
change of the Merriniac
Prisoners.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, June 17.â 1n the Sen
ate to-day Morgan of Alabama offered
a resolution, which was referred to
the Naval Affairs Committee, extend
ing the thanks of Congress to Naval
Constructor Hobson and the heroic
crew of the Merrimac, and authorizing
the transfer of Hobson from the con
struction corps to the line.
Representative Underwood, in whose
district Hobson's home is situated, has
introduced a resolution in the House
extending the thanks of Congress to
Hobson and his crew, authorizing Hob
son's transfer to the line and promotion
to lieutenant commander. He con
ferred with the President and Secretary
Long before offering it.
NEW YORK, June 17.â A special to
the Herald from Washington says: In
structions have been sent by the Navy
Department to Commodore Watson,
commander-ln-chief of the blockading
squadron, directing him to send Cap
tain Nicol Ludlow, commanding the
monitor Terror, to Havana to negoti
ate for the exchange of the Merrimac
prisoners.
Captain Ludlow does not go in his
own ship. One of the smaller vessels
attached to the blockading squadron,
flying a flag of truce, was ordered to
convey the officer to a point in front
of Havana, where the authorities un
derstand he will communicate with an
other vessel sent by Captain General
Blanco. Captain Ludlow has author
ity to accept any proposal regarding
prisoners which Captain General Blan
co may make. The authorities are
anxious to secure Hobson and the men
with him without delay, in order that
they may be removed from Santiago de
Cuba before the battle fur the posses
sion of the city occurs.
In sending Captain Ludlow to Ha
vana the authorities were guided by in
formation received confirmatory of tha
press dispatches, announcing that the
Madrid Government had authorized
Blanco to treat with this Government
for the exchange of prisoners.
It Is understood In naval circles that
Rear Admiral Sampson's negotiations
with Admiral Cervera resulted In fall-
ure because the Spanish commander
did not feel authorized to negotiate the
exchange without consultation with
Blanco and Madrid. It Is untrue that
any prisoners have been taken by the
army expedition now en route to San
tiago de Cuba, who are to be exchanged
for the Merrimac crew.
WASHINGTON, June 17.â The fol
lowing telepram has been received from
Commodore Watson:
"On the 14th I sent Captain Ludlow,
on the Maple, under flag of truce, with
full power to negotiate exchange of
Hobson and the seven petty of
ficers. Chief of staff answered by let
ter that after reference to Madrid the
captain general will communicate by
flag of truce. Captain Ludlow will. If
possible, have exchange made as de
sired, and soon. WATSON."
Simply Means Delay.
WASHINGTON, June â  17.â naval
officials are somewhat puzzled at . the
failure of the effort to exchange Hob
son and his crew. Just announced from
Havana. Of course, tnis is not perma
nent, but simply, means that the Ha
vana authorities as yet have not been
authorized" to exchange prisoners. The
report that came from < Madrid was
that the exchange * had been . author
ized, so it is surmised that the Spanish
Government - has ; not yet found : means
of communicating its decision ', to ; Gen
eral .Blanco at Havana. - 'J

THE REICHSTAG.
Prince Bismarck's Organ Declares
the Secret Ballot Must Be
Abolished in the
Empire.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BERLIN, June 17.â Results from 339
districts show that 165 second ballots
will be necessary. Returns thus far
assure the election of 34 Conservatives
6 Imperialists, 71 Centrists, 44 Reform
ists, 6 National Liberals, 2 candidates
of the Radical Union, 32 Socialist Dem
ocrats, 11 Poles, 1 Dane and 7 Inde
pendents.
It is impossible as yet to predict the
composition of the new- Reichstag. The
crisis of the elections will occur over
the second ballots.
A few facts, however, stand out
plainly. The first is that the Cen
trists will, as heretofore, with probably
diminished strength, hold the balance
of power with 100 seats, enabling them
to sway the Reichstag in either direc
tion. The second is that a cartel ma
jority will be next to impossible and
the third Is that the Socialists will
?hL?r ii n Â°\.. u nly , lar * cl >' increase
their poll, which it is estimated will
reach 2,000,000 votes, as against 1 OSfi
000 in 1693, but will also increase their
representation by 10 or 12 eeatÃ In 1892
Â£?i yy t Wer Â£ lnvolv * d J n only 52 second
ballots. Now probably they will be In
volved in no fewer than 100.
The increase in the socialist vote Is
most marked at Wurtemburg. Already
it is causing alarm among the Ham
burgers, who are especially furious that
the first commercial city of the empire
should be represented in the Reichstag
by three spciallsts, who, their oppon
ents say, h&ve no understanding of the
city's vital interests.
Among the prominent persons re
elected are Count yon Kanltz Prince
Hohenlohe, Prince yon Arenberg aÂ»d
Herren Bachen and Bueb. The DukÂ»
of Ratibon was defeated. Herr Bebel
who was elected at Hamburg, was de
feated at Strasburg, which returned a
socialist at tho last election. Count
Llmburg Ftirum was re-elected.
The Hamburger Naohrichten (Bis

Bunker Hill Day Duly
Celebrated.
ENTHUSIASM AT LOG GATOS
A LARGE CBOWD ATTENDED
FROM THIS CITY.
Patriotic German Citizens Express
Their Readiness to Stand by
the Flag Even Against the
Fatherlana.
j The 123 d anniversary of the battle of
Bunker Hill was fittingly celebrated yes
terday at Los Gatos by the Bunker Hill
Association and the Sons of Vermont, i
At least 2000 people went down to the '
Bunker Hill Park at Los Gatos to Join j
in patriotic unison in memory of the day
which marked the beginning of our self '
government on a national basis. Patriotic
ardor and a fervid enthusiasm character- !
i ized the celebration yesterday. The I
speakers carried the audience back to the I
first beginnings of the American nation
; and told of the great deeds of the prede-
I cesaors of those warriors who are now |
stamping their names on the book of '
fame with indelible and ineffaceable lines. '
The vocalists also worked in the channels
Of patriotism until the very air was alive
with color and the glories of our coun-
The large crowds that attended the
celebration were prepared for the hot
weather of the Santa Clara valley. The
two special trains that left Third and '
: Townsend streets yesterday morning had
on board a distinctively summery band of
women. Even the men cast aside their
city clothes and were thus saved from
the awful fate of roasting. The ther
mometers refused to do any more work
in Los Gatos yesterday during the after
noon. The mercury then lost its expan
: sive force and went on a strike. During ;
; the morning the heat was endurable, but
after midday the visitors reveled in the :
i pastimes of lemonade drinking and a
mopping of the brow. But with all this
superabundance of heat the passion for
dancing among the enthusiastic followers !
or Terpsichore conquered ail atmospheric â 
discomforts and, as soon as the platform
Oh which the literary exercises were held
was cleared, the dancing began.
The San Franciscans who attended the
celebration arrived in two train sections.
A procession was immediately formed
and the march made to the grounds Witu
the band in the lead. The platform, i
shaded with the overgrowing branches of j
large oaks, was soon tilled without an/
delay, and the literary programme was
Started. William G. Badger was the
president of the day, and in a fow re- ;
marks paid a glowing tribute to the ]
fathers of the revolutionary period. The
"Star-Spangled Banner," rendered by j
Talie Salinger, which followed, was a i
musical expression of the sentiments
enunciated by President Badger.
A feature of the literary exercises was
the singing of F. K. Tobin, whoso ren
dition of "The Sword of Bunker Hill"
was so well received that several en
cores were necessary. Judge Edward A.
Belcher was next introduced, and he j
paved the way for the orator of the day, '
Samuel M. Shortridge. Judge Belcher
compared the flower of the nation at the
time of the revolution and the rebellion
with that of the present day, and showed
how the same spirit of liberty pervaded
them all. Samuel M. Shortridge spoke i
with seeming effect of the intrinsic mean- !
ing of Bunker Hill day. He said: "On !
that day the people of this country shook
off the trammels of tyranny and estab
lished the first principles of self-govern
ment. From that day to this the princi
ple of liberty has been pre-eminent in the
American mind. It Js exemplified in our
present war, and w* will not rest until
we stamp the same spirit upon the down
trodden people of Cuba and Manila."
Orator Shortridge then apologized for
being there and addressing even a pa
triotic people on a patriotic subject when
duty kept calling to the front, but he
pledged himself to his nation's cause
when his services should be needed.
Games and races, in which the young
men of the town and some of the* visi
tors indulged, completed the outing. The
one hundred and twenty-third celebra- j
tion of the association will be remem- I
bered as the most successful held so far. I
PATRIOTIC GERMANS.
Appropriate and Highly In
teresting Services at St.
Markus Church.
Memorial services were held in St.
Mark's German Lutheran Church on
O'Farrell street, between Franklin and
Gough, yesterday evening, in honor of
the adoption of the United States flag
and the day of Bunker Hill. The cere
monies were so appropriate, interesting
and patriotic that it is to be regretted
that there was not a larnr attendance,
for the sentiments expressed were such
I as should have been "heard of all men."
I There was quite a number of soldiers
I from Camp Werritt and members of a
German military organization present,
aside from the general public.
Following appropriate music Pastor
Fuendeling delivered an address in Ger
man, setting forth the high virtues of
patriotism, as shown by the American
people since the days of the Rebellion,
and the necessity for Its perpetuation in
the same spirit in order that the republic
may go forward on a great and uninter
rupted career. He also told of the many
advantages of being a Christian soldier,
and said that in a contest like the one
now in progress we have not only the
right but the Almighty on our side. The
Bpeaker exhort&d his hearers to be true
to their God, their flag and themselves.
.LÂ»r. M. Magnus delivered the English
oration, in which he sketched in a brief
and interesting manner the incidents that
led up to the revolution. His description
of the battle of Bunker Hill was vtiy
vivid, particularly where he expatiated
on the great bravery with which the
poorly armed, raw American troops with
stood the repeated assaults or the best
soldiers of the English Army. He said
we were not celebrating the fact that in
that conflict some 1600 men were lost on
the two sides, but the fact that with that
battle began that dawn of American
freedom which has made England a dif
ferent country than it would otherwise
have been. Not only that, but it has ex
ercised a mighty influence upon English
colonies, as well as upon the govern
ments of Germany and France. In the
war with Spain America is taking a
stand never taken beforeâ that of ending i
the brutal oppression of the helpless by -
the power or sword and valor. The mil- i
liona of Germans who have made this j
country their home have learned to love j
it better than the Fatherland, and with i
these men standing for the flag we need j
no other allies. The speaker declared
that no matter what kind of an alliance j
America might make she would be giv
ing more than she could possibly receive, j
"Let hf.r depend upon her own match- ;
less resources in fighting men and i
money," said Dr. Magnus, "and no mat
ter what country may turn its guns and !
soldiers against our beloved land, be it
France, England or Germany, the Ger
man citizens will Ptand by the flag that
guards their homes and symbolizes the
liberties of the greatest nation on earth.
We hope the day may never come that
will require us to raise the sword against
the Futherland, but if it does we are
ready."
The exercises closed with appropriate
remarks from Chaplain Clark of the
Seventh Regiment Volunteers and the
uinglng of the "Star-spangled Banner"
by Miss Groenlnger.

KINGSTON. Jamaica, June 17.
i American naval officers now here say
\ that they have explored the Cuban
coast for miles in both directions from
Santiago, and that everywhere are pre
cipitous hills and bluffs facing the sea.
They say there is no place where troops
j could be propely landed within reach
ing distance of the city except in the
i harbor. The opinion is expressed that
j only enough troops are needed to sus
! tain the position of the marines now at
j Guantanamo and the rest may be sent
I back, leaving the navy to aid the insur
i gents in taking Santiago.
MOLE ST. NICHOLAS, Hayti, "June
i 17. â The Yosemite has been ordered to
| leave Kingston, Jamaica, immediately.
; She goes to Guantanamo to prepare a
i landing for the army. Guantanamo has
been decided to be the only available
landing place.
WASHINGTON, June 17.â N0 news is
expected from the fleet at Santiago be
fore Sunday. That statement was
made at the Navy Department to-day
and was based upon accurate knowl
edge of the cowse taken and the speed
the vessels are traveling. The na
val officials are still confident that the
vessels have taken the easterly course
by way of Cape Maysi. They should
have rounded that point by this time.
The fixing of Sunday as the day
upon which news might be expected is
supposed to have been brought about
by the fact that it will take some time,
probably as much as two days, to land
the troops and their heavy equipments.
Seeing that several days were required
to effect the embarkation of troops at
Tampa, it is not to be expected that I
much better time can be made in get- j
ting them ashore on a hostile coast \
without any of the facilities afforded
at Tampa for the work.
The War Department has been work
ing strenuously to establish cable com
munication over the French cable be
tween Hayti and the point near San
tiago where the marines are now
camped. The Mancel was yesterday at !
Cape Haytien with everything pre
pared for the start, when trouble was
found with her clearance papers. As
soon as the fact was reported here Gen
eral Greely induced the State Depart
ment to send instructions to United
States Minister Powell at Port au
Prince to use his good offices with the j
Haytien Government to facilitate the j
departure of the ship. It is believed j
that this has now been accomplished j
and the Mancel Is now either In Guan- i
tanamo Bay or very close to that place.
As soon as cable communication is re
stored it will be operated by the French
Cable Company itself, the only restric
tion imposed by the United States be
ing the establishment of a censorship
at Camp McCalla.
For the same reason that they de
clined to make public any information
respecting the sending of the Santiago
expedition until the transports had
started, the War Department officials
decline to say whether they are about
to send reinforcements to General Shaf
ter immediately. But without reference
to reinforcements the department will
establish a line of almost daily steamers
with General Shafter to keep his troops
supplied amply with food, munitions of
war and whatever else may be needed, i
It may be necessary also for the Gov
eminent to undertake by means of this ,
express service to supply in large part '
with food and ammunition the Cuban !
Insurgents already under Garcia and
Rabl, who are reported to have come to
the support of Lieutenant Colonel
Huntingdon's marines at Camp Mc-
Calla. v
If the Government should find it
necessary to reinforce General .Shafter
with a few thousand additional soldiers
they can be very conveniently and at
short notice transported on some of
these supply ships.

Itobars. >>r solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; isotherms, or dotted linos, equal
temperature. The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and is usually accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres~
cure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy Wi-ather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure. Is high in the interior and lovr
along the coast, and the isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain Is probable;
but when the "low" is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is ltn
} r t.at'le. With a "high" in the vicinity of

fornia coast, warmer weather mey be expected

reverse of these conditions will produce aa
opposite result.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW Y"KK. June 17.â The unsettled and
waiting temper of Fpeculatlon wo* fhown no
lese to-day by the stagnation In railroad stocks
than by the disposition to take up different
members of the group known as specialties.
ingrH in the railroad list were few and
far between, and the only movement of prices
was the saving: tendency almost Inevitable In
a lifeless market. Infinite Information as to
the conditions of the corning crops Is what
speculators would most like to have, â¦he
markets wore full of rumors to-day of damage
and deterioration to the. crops. The failure of
thewheat market to reflect any crop damage
was attributed to large selling of the accumu
lations of the Loiter deal. But coupled with
tin? reports of crop damage, It served to con
fuse the speculative mind and discourage opera
tions. Money also showed a slowly hardening
tendency and sterling exchange advanced on
demand for remittance of dividends and Inter
est due to foreign holders on July 1. The vio
lent movement Of several of the specialities
reflected no Henura.l condition and was without
information on the stocks Immediately dealt in.

FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK. June 17â Bradstreet's Finan
cial Review to-morrow will say: A reaction
in values occurred early in the week, result
ing In more or less liquidation and bear sell
ing and somewhat lower prices throughout
the share list. The declines, except in a few
instances, were not severe, considering the ex
tent of the previous bull movement, and the
market soon became steady and later In the
wH.'k gave symptoms of renewed advance.
This was, however, mainly on short covering,
and one of the effects of the check to the
markets rising tendency way the decrease of
public participation, professional manipulation
being once more very apparent. London was
a purchaser of stocks to a limited extent on
the decline, but the active interest in Ameri
cans there is small and the London market
generally Is sluggish and narrow. At the end
of the week industrials aiul specialties were
the principal objects of the trading.
The bond Issue and the war news have, of
course, been factors, but the principal Influ
ence In the market this week was the collapse
of Leiter's grain operation at Chicago. It Is
new recognized that this was hanging over
the markf-t for a little time, and wae the
probable cause for the change of leading opera
tors from the bu'l side of stocks. The actual
news of the development at Chicago last Tues-
Jay was. however, a surprise, and a disagree
able mo, to the street at large. The Western
contingent was a very heavy Heller of stocks,
and there was a general fear that banks or
other large Interests might be involved, which
were promptly reflected In the course of prices
for railroad securities. Indeed, the feeling of
apprehension on this score was not thoroughly
relieved until the close of the week, when It
was apparently established that the losses
would fall mainly, if not entirely, on the
chief actor In the episode and his backing.
In this connection it may also be noted that
the reports of the continued ralne at the West
and the dainace to the croi>s have been In
fluential to the bears, while the continuance of
rate-cutting, both East and West, has also
been held up us an unfavorable element In the
situation.
LONDON MARKETS.
NEW YORK. June 17.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
1 markets here were very dull to-day. The
I only feature was the flatness of Brazils. Amer
i leans were fiat but closed better. Grand Trunk
was flat nominally on trafrice reports, but
really because of a weak speculative account.
An ultimate rally is expected. The money
I market Is slightly lower. Fewer American
: loans are offering.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAOO. June 17.â Weak foreign markets
and brilliant weather In the winter wheat belt
presented an opportunity for short sellers of
wheat, which they hastened to avail themselvee
of at the start. September, which closed yes
terday at 70% c, started to-day at from 70c down
to 69\0. and after touching 70Vic for a moment
it began to poll down bill, and did not cease
Its descent for two hours, except to gather force
for a further fall. In that time it had de
clined to 68\40. December In the same time
had sunk from 70Mtc and 70% c around the open
ing to 6\)\LÂ®t&%<:. July had sold off from 78S4e
to 7s\4c. Everybody sold wheat and evinced no
disposition to buy It back even on such a
break as that shown above. There was noth
ing in their minds apparently but the com
ing of a great crop of new wheat here and In
Europe, and the hastening of the advent of the
home crop by the cessation of rain and the
fair warm weather that has been generally
succeeding It. The market refused to respond
for more than a few mlnutee at a time and
then only for a small fraction and grew weak
er as the close of the session approached. Liv
erpool was 3%d lower In July and l%d in Sep
tember. The Paris market vu heavy also
and Antwerp weak. July closed with a loss
of 3Vt@'3%c and September 3H@**c.
The reappearance of the sun In the Western
country' had a depressing lnfiuenoe In corn.
It thawed out a good deal of long corn that
holders had frozen to for some time, and It all
dropped into the pit. July closed l%&iy,c
lower.
The weakness In oats was mainly in sym
pathy with the other grains, although the
weather waa to some extent a bearish factor
July closed %c lower.
The decline in grain affected provisions un
favorably. There was a desultory commission
house selling. Pork closed 12>4c lower, lard 5

BRADSTREHTS REVIEW.
NEW YORK, June 17.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say: Unprecedented foreign trades
totals. Involving heavily Increased shipments
of breadstuff*, provisions, raw cotton and
manufactured products; flattering 'crop pros
pects, pointing to a very large yield of wheat
and most other cereals, as well as cotton;
profitable railway operations, as reflected In
relatively higher gains In net than In grons
receipts; activity In nearly all lines of manu
facturing, except some textile branches; prices
for most staples showing heavy advances over
the preceding year; bank clearings exceeding
all previous records at this date; a volume of
new demand limited In the East and South to
midsummer dullness, but In the West and
Northwest comparing favorably with records of
previous years and a low rate of business
mortality, are all features of the general busi
ness situation at the present time. The col
lapse of LeitÂ«r and his deal In wheat, with the
demoralization In prices which was a con
comitant, has been followed by a quieter feel-
Ingr â  in cereal â¢ markets, but -:' export ' demand
partly on early placed orders has Improved, and
more is doing by flour millers. It la true that
the continued wot weather in sections west of
the Mississippi Is affecting wheat harvesting,
but the trade opinion leads to a crop of 700
000,000 ' bushels of wheat and large ' yields of
most other cereate, with corn promising | least
favorable. .... .'. â  . â :'. % ,
' The cotton yield may be slightly smaller than
last year, but â  this i might . easily be compen
sated for by an advance . In ~ values, which are

shown .In the , Iron - situation < this â¢ week rela
tively most activity \ being exhibited :â  at 'â  the

the banking of furnaces Ib looked for to give
tone to quotations of the raw products. Cot
ton goods. If anything, are slightly Improved,
but raw wool Is still under restricted demand,
because manufacturer? find new business 6low.
The price situation for the week reflects steadi-
Bess, the only important decreases being in
Southern plglron. wheat and f.our, while hogt
are higher at the West, a number of metals
have been advanced and nats, tforn, lard and
cotton note fractional advances.
The West and Northwest continue the scene
of relatively most activity alike In demand
and movement of merchandise. The excellent
crop prospects In the Northwest are reflected
In a satisfactory trade in seasonable goods and
a relatively larger volume of orders for fall
trade, with the aggregate sales at most cities
heavily in excess of the corresponding week
In recent years.
Wheat exports for the week aggregate 4.280,
757 bushels, against 4,830,982 bushels last week,
2,047,319 bushels in this week a year ago. 3,020,
317 bushels in 1898, 2,837,307 bushels in 1595 and
1.927.000 bushels in 1594.
Corn exports are also slightly smaller than
last week, amounting to 4,106,000 bushels, as
compared with 4,774,303 bushels In the preceding
week. 1.924,313 bushels fn this week a year ago,
1,510,000 bushels in IS')6 and 858,000 bushels In
1595.
Business mortality Is at a low point, the fail

only 12 larger than in this week of 1594, when
restriction of credits and uull business was
most ninrlced.

total in this week a year ago, 16 from lbtitf and
of 11 from 1895.
DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NFTW YORK, June 17.â R. G. Dun * Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade will say In to-mor
row's Issue: The passing of the war tax bill,
th* offerings of bonds and the collapae of
Lelter and cash wheat have made the week
somewhat exciting. In spite of some features
which cannot be justified, the tax bill was ap
proved as probably the best that could be ob
tained from Congress this year and gave as
surance of needed revenue for the emergency.
Its bond provision has already called out offers
for more than three times the amount desired,
and it will probably prove the most successful
loan ever Invited by the United States. A
groat victory in ihe field could hardly be more
Important, and especially in its Influence on
foreign opinion. Not less significant was the
excess oi exports over imports In May by $'16,
950.359. making a mercantile balance In favor
oi tne I nited States of $;.71.559,037 in eleiren
months of the fiscal year, while the Imports of
gold wore <102,026, JÂ»8f!, though in no previous
ttscal year have {he net Imports of gold ex
cee.ied $:i7,4t>>,]27, which occurred in 1882.
No lens important is the official showing that
this nation has supplied to others 10,608,208
bushels of wheat ami 201,000,000 bushels of corn !
In eleven and a halt" months without checking j
receipts fri>m farmers, and sees wheat fall 2o !
cents in a week because a crop is promised j
greater than the last by I<*).iy"i,oflo bushel*. This
decline would have conn- sooner hud not Leiter
looked for larger gains, but the benefit to this I
country by tlit average advance of nearly j
cents for the crop year on wheat exported has I
been about 148,600,000, and to producers much
greater. In corn, on the other har.d, the cash |
price has declined only 1 cent, and the de
mand continues extraordinary. Western re
ceipts amounting to 4, 87:), 202 bushels, against
3.818.194 last year, and exports amounting to
5,6'J2.600 bushels, against 1,323.448 last year.
The cotton movement continues large for the j
season, although the price has advanced a six- !
teenth in spite of favorable crop prospects. '
Xhe manufacturing demand abroad Is good and
Controls the output, fin'! at this late season
America lets Liverpool muke prices. Here the
manufacturing demand is a little better,
though with a decline in prices of bleached
shirtings, but the mills have kwge stocks of
materials. There is also a stronger market for I
wool abroad, which, with Western excitement, |
makes quotations of 100 qualities by Coates i
Bros, of 1 cent higher thnn June 1, but there j
is scarcely any buying by manufacturers, who
are in doubt about the coming season nnd
have few new orders except In army lines. The
break In the price of 16-ounce clay worsted to !
Jl 20 has somewhat discouraged what promised !
to be a healthy market. Sales of wool were
made extremely narrow by the wide differ- |
ences between excited Western holders and
manufacturers, who Jiave an uncertain coming i
season to face.
Plglron is extremely dull, though Bessemer i
holds last week's advance and other grades are I
not quotably lower. No decline in consumpt
ion appears, nnd while bars are weak, with
short time the rule in Eastern mills, they ad
vanced 2Vi cents at Pltmlmrg. while Chicago re
ports heavy aeaaou contracts still coming from j
wagon, cor and other manufacturers. Heavy j
sheets are better at the Bast, but thin are not â 
better anywhere. Structural works are full for !
the summer a.id have hnj two remarkably i
good weeks at Chicago with building and .
bridge orders. Plate mills are well employed,
and at Chicago the demand for pipe is better, I
especially from the i'acilic ("nost. Shipments !
from there of rails In May included some to j
Sweden, Belgium. South Africa, Siberia and i
three other countries, while orders from Cal- J
cutta have Just been taken. The anthracite :
coal output In May exceeded the allotment by I
19.9 per cent. j
Failures Ji.r the week have been 223 in the
United Stat'-s, against 234 last year, and 20 In

HAT AND FEEDSTUFFS.
An Interesting game of freeze out Is now go-
Ing on between the country holders of Hay and
the city buyers. The latter have always seen
a break In prlcr-s at this time of the ear, and
are waiting for tt to come along aa usual before
buying. The former know that Hay is scarce
this season and -â¢â - quietly holding it until
later on. Dealers say that when the buyerÃ
do take hold there will probably be lively times
for a while. Meanwhile the market Is dull and
rather weak than otherwise, with a very lim
ited assortment for buyers to choose from.

WORKING ON
A NEW PLAN
State Delegates From
Assembly Districts.
UPSETS ALL CALCULATIONS
NO SUMMER VACATIONS FOR AN
ARMY OF OFFICE-SEEKERS.
Candidates for Governor Cannot Now
Hope for a Solid Delega
tion by the Unit
System.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 17.
Somehow or other Alameda County poli- '
ticians have become impressed with the
Idea that the Republican State Central
Committee will call for the election of
delegates to the State Convention from J
Assembly districts. This has somewhat
upset local, plans, and whether or not the
Information be true, it is being acted
upon. Coming at this time It will help to
make interesting the period that must
elapse between the primaries, because
candidates and managers will have to
I'Uild their fences, lay their wires and
perfect their plans for the new conditions.
For several montns it has been thought
that it would be left to the discretion of
the county central committee whether or
not to authorize a county convention to
elect State delegates. As the county com
niittee in such an event would call for
delegates from wards and townships,
plans were laid to that end. Now that
the Assembly district plan is considered
as certain to be used, it haa sp:u up ail
tne wards and townships and presented a
new problem upon which to calculate.
Dr. Pardee says, "1 want a solid delega
tion from this county. It 1 get a majority
of the delegates 1 want them all. if Mr.
Davis gets a majority he should have
them all and I win work for his nomina
tion. "That is how 1 feel."
Mr. Davis say 8, "No matter what the :
State committee authorizes, we shall be
pleased to accept and obey. It has long
been our habit to follow the instructions
of recognized Republican authority, and
we shall not depart from our precedent.
"Whether the delegates comÂ« from wards
or townships or trom Assembly districts
ye are satisfied."
Although the warm weather is making
official routine life less pleasant than whe:i
it is cool, and although every inducement
is being offered to camp away from the
scenes of political craze, still It is not
likely that many politicians will take a
vacation this summer.
They cannot afford to, because there Is
a fight for every office and the man who
Is not on the scene considers he is out of
the fight. The breaking up of the ward
and township plan has largely complicat
ed the campaigns of county candidates.
The Assembly districts so divide the
â wards and townships that opposing inter
ests are found in every one of them, and
every candidate for county office is anx
ious to be certain that his support of a
candidate for Governor from his own dis
trict will be such that in the county fight
which succeeds the State nomination he
â¢will be able to command in return the
support of the successful gubernatorial
candidates.
For ev< ry office there are several can.li
dates, and although it is a recognized fact
"that one or more places on the ticket
must go away from ihe bay, tbere seems
to be no provision being made for the in
terior of the county. Oakland has some
body for every office. Alameda has can
didates for sheriff and tax collector.
Berkeley ha? two candidates for recorder,
while every wnship has a choice for
Â£Ã¼blic administrator. Arthur FHdler of
Livermore wants to be treasurer, and
Mi. Bessie Wood will get into the fight
for Coroner. Dr. Baldwin, the Incumbent,
does not want to succeed himself, and Dr.
Mehrmann, Dr. Taylor and Dr. Bradley
would each like to be his successor. '
There are no judges to be elected this
year, but for district attorney there are
five candidates so far, and probably more
to follow. As Mr. Soook retires the field
is open..
J. P. Garllck, superintendent of schools,
has no desire to succeed himself, and P
M. Fisher, H. W. Lynch of Washington,
and George Frick of Lorin would like to
succeed him. At present the offices of
sheriff and treasurer are filled by Popu
lists, and as there is not the least chanc<Â«
of their succeeding themselves, Republi
cans are appearing from all directions.
Occasionally mention is made of Demo
crats. Populists and Fusionists, but so
many of the last-named have come Into
the Republican camp, while the old De
mocracy Is fighting within itself, that the
prospect is more than ever encouraging
lot Republicans.

A MUCH INFLATED
PRINTING BILL
OVERCHARGE OF $1000 ON THE
DELINQUENT TAX LIST.
C. E. Newman Finds Pages Rat
at $24 When They Should Have
Been Bated at $8 24.
There Is likely to be trouble over the
bill for the printing of the delinquent tax
Hat. It was submitted to the board and
â was referred to C. E. Newman for veri
fication. His report was made to the
Finance Committee yesterday, and In It
he said he had found an overcharge of
$1009 66, reducing the bill from $3495 14 to
$2485 38. â  ;:" ,
In explanation the expert stated that the
contractor had charged for notes and de
scriptions 7 cents a line, the same as he
charged for a name, while the law dis
tinctly says he may charge only so much
as the type makes in thousands of ems
In the type generally used in the publica
tion, which in this case Is agate. At tht.
rate of 7 cents a line this brings up the
cost of a page to about $24. while at tho
rate by the thousand ems the page would
coet <yn\y $8 24. He accordingly rectified
the account throughout and presented It
to the Finance Committee. The matter
was laid over until the next meeting in
order to give the proprietors of the Jour
nal of Commerce, who had the contract,
a chance to expl*in their inflated bill.
Much of the time of the committee was
taken up in the investigation of the re
counts of Alfred Fuhrman, collector of
delinquent taxes. It was charged that
Fuhrman had collected as his commission
40 per cent of his total collections, while
the law allowed him but 25 per cent. He
presented to the committee all his bills,
and showed that they had been verified
by Cyril Williams, the expert of the
Finance Committee. Upon the showing
of the bills and the verifications of the
expert, the case was allowed to drop.

WILL OPPOSE THE
PETITION FOR POOLS
EMERYVILLE TRUSTEES TO ACT
NEXT MONDAY NIGHT.
The Jockey Club Representative Says
There Is No Chance for the
Permission to Be Granted.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
9f>B Broadway, June 17.
Next Monday evening the Emeryville
Trustees will consider a petition from an
Oakland saloon-keeper for permission to
conduct poolrooms nnd make books on
Eastern races. Emeryville is the only
place in Alameda County where there is
any hopo of conducting poolrooms, and
until Monday it will not be known how
great Is the foundation for the hope.
There is much oppositiou to the scheme
and a counter petition will be presented
at the meeting praying that poolrooms be
forbidden, as they would attract a dis
reputable element. Mr. Lissak, who rep
resents Thomas Williams Jr.. at present
in Japan, said to-day that the California
Jockey Club was very much opposed to
licensing bookmakers on Eastern races.
"After we have made an investment of
$300,0Â«>." eaid Mr. Lissak. "we will be apt
to protect our own interests. It is ab
surd to suppose that persons who might
put up a shed and sell pools on Eastern
r.n es should be permitted to come in and
Interfere with their business. If we want
ed to kill it we could run pool-selling con
stantly, but we have our regular season
and pools are sold only on the events
which take place on our own track. It
is easy to petition the Trustees but it will
stand no show of being passed."

DENIED THE
HALL STEPS
J. Aubrey Jones Wants
to Talk of Bryan.
ADVISED TO HIRE A HALL
CHIEF FLETCHER REFUSES TO
GIVE PERMISSION.
Mayor Thomas Says the People Have
Passed on Bryan ana the
War SpeaKs for
Itself.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 17.
John Aubrey Jones, a well-known real
estate dealer, who has figured in several
political campaigns, gave notice a few
days ago that he would lecture on Satur
day evening from the City Hall steps on
"William J. Bryan and the War." It Is
necessary' to secure a permit from the
Mayor and Chief of Police before such
lectures can be given, and Mr. Jones can
not procure the consent of either.
Mayor Thomas was first asked for the
permit, but he referred Jones to Chief
Fletcher. How the Chief received Mr.
Jones is told in a letter written to the
Mayor by Mr. Jones and which he says:
"Officer Fletcher peremptorily refused to
grant my request, saying with an air of
disgusting pomposity, 'No, sir; I (with
emphasis on the pronoun) am opposed to
your speaking or any one else speaking
from the City Hall steps or on the street
anywhere. and while I am in authority
will prevent it." "
Mr. Jones asserts that this is an abridg
ment of his rights and declares that the
Chief of Police has exceeded his author-
ity.
Mayor Thomas has sent Mr. Jones the
following letter:
MAYOR'S OFFICK.
OAKLAND, Cal., June 17. ISSB.
Mr. John Aubrey Jonesâ My Dear Pir:
In reply to your open letter of the 15th
inst.. 1 beg leave to state that In my
discretion your request must be denied,
and I suggest that, If you desire to de
liver an address on the subject stated,
you hire a hall.
Your subject Is of such magnitude
that 1 would suggest a division of it
and that you break It in sections. The
first section has been pretty thoroughly
treated upon in the past and a general
expression of the people given. The
â¢econd section, the war, is now being
considered, and it seems there is little
room for discussion upon that subject.
and such as Is required will be par
ticipated in by our army ar.d navy to
the entire ?atisractlon of the people.
Yours respectfully,
W. R. THOMAS. Mayor.

Accident.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 17.
Several well-known Oaklanders are ly
ing In beds and bandages at Yosemlte as
the result of a serious accident that oc
curred two days ago. The mishap was
due to a runaway on an embankment,
and half a dozen people are wondering
how their lives were preserved.
The story of the miraculous escape
which caused Senator Mofflt "to pray
as he never prayed before" is told in ad
vices received to-day. A party, consist-
Ing of Senator and Mrs. F. J. Mofflt,
Miss Pratt, Mr. and Mrs. George Roed
ing of Fresno, Will Dargie Jr., Mr. Heus
ton (a retired banker of New York), Hon.
J. S. Zevely (a Government agent), and
Jefferson Mofflt left the Sentinel Hotel
for a drive up the valley. Tom Gordon,
who has navigated in the Yosemite for
a quarter of a century, was the driver,
and all went well until a point eleven
miles from Wawona was reached, when
the horses were changed. Three were
gentle, but Gordon told the party not to
speak a word, for the fourth horse would
kick at the sound of a voice. At Inspira
tion Point the vicious leader suddenly
commenced kicking, and an instant later
he was on a mad run, dragging and ex
citing the other three horses. The brake
and all the weight the driver put on the
reins exerted no inlluence over the wild
runaways. It was the steepest down
grade on the route. Every 200 feet there
was a sharp curve, and the tendency oÂ£
the coach to swing toward the bank was
all that prevented an upset for a quarter
of a mile.
The driver finally turned to the party
and said, "We are gone, nothing cansav*
us." Senator Mofflt shouted. "We have a
better chance by not Jumping," and
everybody sat still. In rcundlng two
curves close together one of the horses
went over the embankment. At exactly
that point on the other edge of the rwd
"divine Providence" had placed a tree
fully five feet in circumference. The
front wheel of the coach struck this tree
and rent in it a gash the size of the hufc.
Gordon says that the team at that time
was going fully eighteen miles an hour.
When the front wheel struck the tree the
hind wheel was already over the em
bankment. The coach remained straight
for a small portion of a second from the
impact, until the hind hub was embedded
in the sarae tree.
The concussion from the first bump
sent Miss Pratt and the driver flying
to the right, Mr. and Mrs. Mofflt to the
left. Young Mofflt landed in the middle
of the road. Three of the horses
scrambled away, dragging the driver,
while the rest of the passengers, with
the exception of Will Dargie Jr., were
Jolted in the coach and severely and
painfully wounded. Mrs. Mofflt clambered
up the bank unaided, while the Senator
remained unconscious on the rocks for
nearly an hour. Miss Pratt received
probably twenty-five gashes. This is the j
first accident that has ever happened to
the veteran driver, Gordon. An investi
gation of the scene later showed that
had the tree been one foot to the right
or left from where it was the whole party
would have gone down the embankment
500 feet on to the rocks in the Merced
River. The maimed passengers are now
recovering at the hotel, but it will be
several days before they can pursue their
pleasure trip. Young Dargie was the
only one in the group that was not in
jured in the least, and on the return of
the Oaklanders they are going to ask ;
Yosemite Commissioner Foote to name ;
the tree that saved their lives "Salvation j
Tree."

RED CROSS FAIR
WILL RECEIVE
POPULAR AID
Some Details of the Plan to Enter
tain the Public and Help
the Soldiers.
Well-Known Citizens Say the Fair Would Prove
a Practical Means of Increasing the
Fund for Humanity's Cause.
There are many evidences that The
Call's proposal that the Red Cross peo
ple be encouraged to start a fair for
the benefit of the great movement in
which they are conspicuous is popu
lar.
Men foremost in business affairs,
prominent lawyers. Federal and mu
nicipal officers, as well as the great
rank and file of every-day American
citizens, indorse the movement for a
fair. They say it is at once a practi
cal and pleasant way for the masses to
enow their patriotism.
It is part of the purpose of the Red
Cross people to appear before the
Chamber of Commerce and set forth
their plans In detail, with a view of re
ceiving aid and encouragement from
that representative business body,
whose patriotic utterances have re
cently been appiauded all over the
United States.
The main features of the proposed ex
hibition, as set forth by David Lubin,
give a thorough idea of the plans now
under consideration. It will be seen
by a review of the plan that all mat
ters contemplated are within the range
of practicability and that there are
many features that will prove highiy
entertaining as well as instructive to
the public.
The following opinions of well-known
citizens, in addition to those already
expressed and published in these col
umns, will give a general id(.-a of the
plans:
CHEMIST A. M'BOTLEâ It is a good
THE FAIR PLAN IN DETAIL.
How the Red Cross Could Entertain
and Raise Funds.
A proposition of a grand exhibition with special features for the pur
uf raising a large fund for the Red Cross to be under the auspices of
the Chamber of Commerce of San Franrjpro.
Firstâ The grand exhibition might be divided into two main sections, the
first to be known as the historical section, the second as the art loan sec
tion. The historic section could represent: The history of the State grouped
by counties and municipalities, and consist of the objects of history from
the earliest time to the present. This should embrace the important pub
lic archives and private documents of the various governments under which
California was ruled, and tho historic ecclesiastical objects from the vari
ous missions of the State. The interesting objects illustrating the history
connected with gold and silver mining could be shown; the historic me
mentos of the Statp militia, volunteer fire departments, the civic and secret
orders and miscellaneous objects of State history would be interesting.
Tin- art loan section might consist of marble and other statuary, paint
ings, objects of art, etc., to be 'loaned free of charge by citizens generally.
At stau-d tini'-s during the exhibition the following special . features
are BUggested: Sham battle, athletic contests, Roman arena contests, school
children's exercises, choral societies, drill of infantry, cavalry and artillery,
bombarding of a port, competitive patriotic songs and music (new), tableaux
of the wars from the time of the revolution to the present day. These
tableaux could be in pantomime, some after the fashion of humorous car
- ptbera severely historic; dress relu-arsal by men and women in copies
of American traditionally historic costumes.
There should be no expense incurred for rent, light, transportation,
transmission <>f telegraph or telephone messages or for labor, but great
efforts should be made to have them contributed free.
The following organizations could be interested in the work: Organizations
of women, county and municipal officers, Native Daughters, Native Sons,
Pioner-rs, secret orders, labor unions, commercial bodies, State militia,
churches, colleges, trade organizations.
thing for the people to do all In thoir
power to aid the Red Cross. It is dif
ficult for those who remain at home to
realize the extent of the benefits con
ferred by this deservedly popular so
ciety. I think The Call's plan for a
fair is all right, though I doubt whether
anything will be >lune unless some one
gets at the holm and works without in
terruption to that end.
ASSISTANT UNITED STATES DIS
TRICT ATTORNEY BERT BCHLES
INGER â I am sure that there has never
been a more popular movement than
this one by the Red Cross people. It
â will be a fine way to raise money for
the soldiers' benefit and I am with it
hÂ»art and soul. It seems hard to be
lieve that any one can seriously op
pose the movement.
T'NITED STATES COMMISSIONER
HEACOi'K-A movement like this at
once unites all the people. You cannot
do enough along this line. The Call's
plan is as good a one as I have heard
of and it will surely succeed if it is
properly managed. The good folk <>f
the Red Cross deserve all the moral and
financial support that the people can
give.
W. W. KAUFMAN, of Stratton &
Kaufman, attorneys â The idea of a fair
for the benefit of the Red Cross So
ciety is a grand one. Every one' is
willing to contribute toward such a no
ble cause. - Let us have a fair on the
lines suggested by The Call and it will
prove a financial success.
EX-ASSEMBLYMAN H. C. DIBBLE
Let us have a fair on the lines sug
gested by The Call and it will, beyond
doubt, prove a great financial success.
These are war times and every one is
willing and anxious to contribute to
ward the success of Old Glory. The
men who have gone from our shore to
fight for the flag of our country may be
in real need within the next few
months, and it is our duty to see that
everything looking toward their com
fort Is supplied.
P. J. THOMASâ I am willing and
anxious to contribute toward the suc
cess of a fnir that will brine: funds
to the Red Cross Society. The so
ciety is working in a noble cause and
should receive the hearty Buppdrt and
co-operation of every one. That it will
receive such support is beyond ques
tion. We are nil Americans and will
ever be f..und supporting the flag of
our country and the men fighting un
der it.
JULIUS KAHNâ We are involved in
war and it is the djity of those who
remain at home to see that those who
have gone to the front shall receive
every enre and attention. The work
of the Red Cross Society cannot be
too fully appreciated. The noble wo
men who have given up their time to
lessen the burdens of those who have
answered the call of the President for
volunteers to support the flag and our
country should be shown n p.oper ap
preciation of their efforts. By all means
let us have a fair and allow the Red
Cross Society to dispose of the funds
where they will do the most good.

NEW RITUAL ADOPTED, WITH
AMENDMENTS.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WOODLAND, June 17.â The Grand
Parlor, Native Daughters of the Golden
West, to-day adopted Mrs. Guzendorf
er's new ritual, with minor amend
ments. The .hanks of the Native
Daughters' Red Cross Society for a do
nation of $100 from the Grand Lodge
were received. ... resolution thanking
the local and metropolitan press for its
reports of the proceedings and the peo
ple of Woodland for their hearty hos
pitality was passed. An ode written
by Mrs. Lillian Curlie was adopted
and a prize awarded the author.
The grand officers were installed. Re
tiring Grand Piesident Conrad was pre
sented with a diamond ring by Clara
K. Wittenmeyer on behalf of the Grand
Parlor. There was a farewell speech
by the retiring grand president and a
greeting by Grand President Mills and
the session of the Grand Parlor was at
an end.
Last 1 M the new ritual was under I
discussion until nearly midnight. Every
delegate prsent was requested to ex
press her views. They were practically
unanimous in the opinion that the new
ritual was faultless in construction and
beautiful in sentiment. The only ob
jection urged was the great length of
the charges. The fear seemed to be
uppermost in the minds of most of the
delegates that the effect of its adoption !
in its original form would be to dis- |
courage small country par'ors. To-day
the discussion was resumed and after
the ritual had been shortened and
slightly amended it was adopted.
The old ritual was exemplified this j
morning by tl Â» members of v\*oodland
Parlo.-, Native Daughters of the Golden
West. Ti.e exemplification was beauti
fully done cnO upon its conclusion the
members of tl. Grand Parlor, particu
larly the grand officers, paid many high
and deserved compliments o the mem
bers of Woodland Parlor for their fine
appearance and to the officers especially
for their letter-perfect work. The new
ritual .8 then again exemplified by
the same officer'- as officiate! in the
first exemplification.
The Native Sons gave a complimen
tary ball this evening in honor of the
Gra. 1 Parlor. It was one of the grand
est social events ever held in Wood
land. The company was brilliant and
as large as could be accommodated in
the spacious hall. The decorations were
magnificent and - keeping with other
appointments of the splendid function.
The Native Daughters leave Wood
land well pleased with tl.elr reception
and entertainment here. They are lav
ish in their praise of the hospitality of
the Yolo metropolis.
THE PASSING OF
JOSEPH M. WOOD.
HIS END CAME AFTER A VERY
SHORT ILLNESS.
Deceased Was a Pioneer on the Coast
and One of the Prominc t Law
yers of the State.
The funeral of the late Joseph M. Wood,
who died Thursday afternoon from an at
tack of acute peritonitis, will be held from
St. 'Stephen's Episcopal Church at 12:30
to-day.
Mr. Wood was a pioneer and one of the
best-known lawyers In the State. In '49,
when but a boy of 16. he made the journey
around the Horn with his father. Colonel
William <J. Wood of New York, who took
the journey mainly for his health, and
brought the boy with him aa a compan
ion. When a young: man he took up tho
study of law and his success has amply
attested his ability. From time to time
he has been engaged in many important
cases, and at one time acted as attorney
for the Street Commissioners. Although
always prominent in politics, he has
neither sought nor held public office at
any time. He was a prominent member
of tho Kar Association and the Society
of Pioneers.
The deceased leaves a widow and a
family of grown children, as well as two
sisters in this cityâ Mrs. John F. Swift
and Mrs. Oorge A. Norrls. He has a
brother .a captain in the regular army,
who was recently stationed at Tampa,
but has since moved with the troops. Up
to the time of his death Mr. Wood was In
good health, and the news of his demise
came as a shock to the many who knew
and loved him.
DEFICIENCY BILL
DULY DEBATED
Interesting Talk in the House Over
the Free Delivery
Service.
WASHINGTON, June 17.â The peneral
deficiency bill occupied the attention of
the House to-day. It will probably not
pass the House Vie fore Monday, the ses
sion after 2 o'clock beinp set apart for
eulogies upon the late Senator Harris ot
Tennessee.
Debate was resumed upon the para
graph appropriating $1fi3,000 to supply a
deficiency in the free delivery service of
the Postofflce Department.
Love (D.) of Mississippi criticized the
department for having Incurred expenses
In excess of the appropriations made by
the last bill.
(D.) of New York and Brad
ley (D.) of New York advocated in
creased free delivery, and argrued for
granting the postal authorities discretion
in providing for public needs.
Cannon explained that should the ap
propriation not be made carriers would
be discharged to economize and limit the
expense to the former appropriation.
The paragraph was passed.
During the reading of the bill a rliÂ«*_
cussion arose over a paragraph of minor
interest, incidental to which Ray (R.) of
New York, chairman of the Committee
on Pensions, asserted that more private
pension bills had been passed by the
present Congress than were ever passed
by any preceding Congress within the
same time, and more than the total num
ber passed by the Fifty-second and Fifty
third Congresses combined.
At 5 o'clock the House recessed for the
evening pension session.

IN ARGUMENT
Mrs. Gordon Accused

NO VALID CLAIM.
Her Attorneys, However, State That
She Will Establish Her Case
Without Difficulty.
The atino6phere surrounding the con

of the riches loft by John B. Wilson, an
Oakland capitalist, is getting extremely
tropical, and the bailiff in Judge Troutt's
where a motion in the ea.se was

expects that before the trial Is ended he
will have the pleasure of separating com

Augusta Gordon, which asks for the re

admitting the last will of the de
ce.u-ed capitalist to probate.
lira. Gordon, on behalf of her children,
who, she claims, are those of John B.
Wilson, seeks to break the will. She. says
often acknowledged that he was
their father and provided for them until

neglect them in hts will. She was raar

consult him regarding her claims against
the Wilson estate. He did not send for

visited him prior to the death of Captain j
Wilson, but be did not inform her, as she !

of the child, and did not state that he
would compromise the case for her. Mrs.
Gordon never told him that she was will

leged, nor did she state to him that "for

this meeting Mrs. Gordon again called
and informed him thai Robert F. Simp-

Wright was persistent in his ur- !
:it that wicked and criminal influ- I
were back of the action of the con- I
at, but it vr.is evident from yester
day's proceedings that the court did not
hold the same view of the case. All the ]
morning Colonel Kowalsky argued in be
half of his client, putting forth points ]
In her favor exceot when he would drift \
.â¢".way In order to thrust sarcastic remarks i
;it Wright, opposing counsel. When At- j
Kowalsky had concluded hta ar
gument on b<-half of his client and I
was about to address the court on I
the letter referred to by oppos
ing counsel as a blackmailing letter he
was interrupted by Judge Troutt, who
â aid :
I have carefully examined the record, Mr. |
Kowalsky, and have oonsiderad the letter writ- j
ten by you In this matter, and It Is my opinion
that you have done rmthlnK wrong. It Is my
Opinion that the lettei Is a proper one and
that counsel was not justified In the Interpre- i
tation which he attempted to give It.
Mr. KowaJaky bowed his appreciation â 
of the view the court took, of the matter â 
and took his seat. He was followed in the i
argument by Attorney T. J. Crowley, who
hotly denounced the "methods employed
by oposing counsel in an attempt to preju- ;
dice the case of Mrs. Gordon." He said
that the only ef.ock in trade In a lawyer's
possession with which he could make his i
livlag was his honor, and that whoever !
accused him of blackmail told a deliber
ate falsehood, and that a deliberate false
hood was a lie. He had not been accused
of blackmail, he continued, but associate
counsel and his client had, and he took it
upon himself to believe that he had been
bo accused by inference. He did not wish
to'use the direct words he would like in
order to vent' his opinion of opposl-.g
counsel's conduct, but if that gentleman
would meet him outside the court room i
he would do so in a manner not soon to be
forgotten. The challenge was not ac
cepted and the bailiff was not called upon
to stop a battle Of fists In the corridors.
The case will be submitted to-day, and in
event the court refuses to grant the mo

tried in the near future.

contestant haa no valid claim and that
the filing of the contest was barred by the
Btatute of limitations and that other Ir
regularities exist. This, however, is dis

MINNESOTA VOLUNTEERS AT DRILL
The Red Cross Benefit Draws Thousands
to Mechanics' Pavilion.
Mechanics' Pavilion was crowded with patriotic soldiers and citizens last night, the occasion being a
reception to the Thirteenth Minnesota Volunteers for the benefit of the local Red Cross Society.
The volunteers were enthusiastically cheered from the moment they entered the pavilion until the ex
ecution of the last order. The concluding number of the programme was a review by â  ieneral Merritt of
the United States army.
The Minnesotans are a fine looking body of men and they showed that they have been well drilled. The
setting up exercises, bayonet exercises and various physical exercises with arms showed that they have
much skill. The company drill and guard mounting were loudly applauded and the following programme
was rendered:
Entrance of Thirteenth Minnesota Volunteers, U. S. A., in heavy marching order; setting up exercises.
Company I. Lieutenant Byrnes commanding; bayonet exercise, Company E, Captain Spear; physical exercise
with arms, Company D, Captain Metz; company drill, Company A, Captain McWade; guard mounting, de
tachments from all companies; old officer of the day. Captain Bjornstad; new officer of the day, Captain
Masterman: officer of the guard. Lieutenant C. A. Clark; supernumerary, Lieutenant Mellinger; review by
Major General Merritt, U. S. A.
The receipts of the evening amounted to $627 at the door, though a number of tickets were sold outside
and it is thought these will add considerably to the result.
The pavilion was beautifully decorated, the work being done by F. E. Pratt from purely patriotic mo
tives.
The spectators dispersed shortly after 10 o'clock, feeling that they had beheld a splendid object lesson
of soldierly discipline and that their money had been spent in aid of a noble and patriotic cause.
claimed by the contestant, and in proof of
her claim she points to the issuance of the
citation to the proponents by Judge Slack
on 'March 14 of last year.
Attorney J. A. Wright, for the propo
nents, made a long argument. He was
emphatic in denouncing the claim brought
by Mrs. Gordon and said that it bore the
"ear marks of blackmail."

DASTARDLY
CRIME OF AN
EX-CONVICT
Paddy Shea Charged
With Assault.
ELIZA GODECKE HIS VICTIM
CHOKED AND BEATEN BECAUSE
SHE RAISED AN OUTCRY.
Her Assailant Taken by Surprise at
His Mother's Ranch in San
Mateo County and Ar
rested.
"Paddy" Shea, an ex-convict and all
around crook. is again in trouble. This
time he is charged with criminal assault
on Eliza Godecke, aged 19 years, who lives
with her mother at 47 Homer street.
Last Thursday afternoon Shea jumped
over the rear fence of the Godecke resi
dence and entering the kitchen found his
helpless victim engaged in washing
dishes. Seizing her arm he attempted to
drag her into an adjoining room. Her
screams attracted the attention of her
mother, who rushed to her assistance.
As she entered the kitchen she was met
by Shea, who threatened to kill her if she
interfered. He then dragged the unfor
tunate girl into the adjoining room and
executed his cowardly purpose.
Yesterday morning Shea's victim, ac
companied by her mother, visited police
headquarters and swore out a warrant for
his arrest, charging him with criminal
assault. Policemen O'Connor and J. F.
Murphy, who are acquainted with Shea,
were given the warrant to serve. They
flrst visited his home, but not finding him
there concluded that he was in hiding. By
dint of inquiry they learned that he had
gone to San Mateo, where his mother has
a ranch. The officers took the first train
for that place and on arriving at the
ranch they espied Shea reading a news
paper. Stealthily approaching him, they
grabbed him before he knew of their
presence.
He was then handcuffed and broug-ht to
this city. Last night he was positively
identified by the girl as the man who had
assaulted her.
The prisoner belongs to the notorious
Shea family, which has given the police
an endless amount of trouble. "Paddy"
was first arrested February 11. 18S1, for
petty larceny, and on a conviction was
sent to the House of Correction for six
months. Shortly after being discharged
he induced an old man named Barney
Carter to accompany him to the dumps
at the foot of Sixth street, where he
knocked him down and robbed him of $45.
He was arrested by Detectives Dillon and
Crockett a short time after the robbery
and formally charged with the crime. On
September 17, ISSI, he was convicted by a
Jury in the Superior Court and sentenced
to twelve years in Folsom.
He was discharged on May 19, 1889, and
shortly afterward was arrested for petty
larceny. On a conviction he was sen
tenced to three months in the County
Jail. In 1892 he was again arrested for
robbery and sent to San Quentin for four
years.
Shea's brother some years ago was shot
and killed by a policeman while resisting
arrest. .

ESCAPED STATE'S PRISON.
S. Stencel Allowed to Plead to a Mis-
demeanor After Conviction oi
a Felony.
S. Stencel, who suffered conviction last
Thursday on a charge of feloniously ob
taining goods under false pretenses, will
not go to the penitentiary for his offense,
and all owing to the fact that the firm
of Murphy, & Co.. which he
swindled, did not wish to see his wife and
babies suffer through his wrongdoings.
Stencel, who conducted a little store at
42 Third street, made a false statement
to Murphy, Grant & Co. of his financial
condition not long ago, and thereby ob
tained unlimited credit. It was but a
short time after he obtained a large bill
of goods thnt he became a bankrupt and
filed a petition in insolvency. He was ar
rested at the Instance of Murphy. Grant
& Co. and vigorously nrosecuted, with the
result that he was convicted of the felony
with which he was charged.
Yesterday morning, when Stencel ap
peared for sentence, a motion for a new
trial was made by his counsel, and Henry
Ach. special prosecuting attorney for
Murphy, Grant & Co., consented. He
stated that sufficient punishment had
been inflicted upon the prisoner in his
conviction alone, and he did not wish to
oppose the motion. At the end of the
argument of counsel Stencel was allowed
to plead guilty to a charge of obtaining
goods under false pretenses under the
value of $10. The charge to which Stencel
pleaded guilty is a misdemeanor, and in
al! probability he will only suffer a few
days' imprisonment instead of years, as
would have been the case had the orig
inal conviction been allowed to stand
against him. The prisoner waived time
as to the passing of sentence, but Judge
Cook was not ready to proceeed. and ad
mitted him to bail in the sum of $20. Bten
cel was ordered to appear in court Mon
day, when sentence will be passed.
The "Sayonara."
The passengers on board the Belglc on
its last trip from China to this port
passed away the time by getting out a
newspaper which they named the Sayon
ara, and which contained interesting
stories by the passengers. Dr. C. P.
Kindleberger, J. C. Evans and Colonel
Loud, who were participants in the battle
of Manila Bay, penned vivid descriptions
of Dewey's great victory. Poetry and
clever stories were contributed and all in
all the paper proved an attractive one.
James L. Flood, the well-known million
aire, was on board and assumed the po
sition of proprietor and publisher. He was
assisted by the following editors: Mrs.
Denby, Mrs. A. Q. Dlckcnson, Mrs. S. S.
Roblson, Miss M. C, Clark, Colonel A. G.
Dickenson, Ralph Phelps Jr., E. J. Bates
and W. R. Sewell.

Arrested at Worship.
Harris Becker has sued Daniel Eisner
and Jule C. Gamage to recover $10,000
damages for false imprisonment. The
plaintiff alleges that on October 6. 1897,
while the defendant was in a place of
worship at 943 Mission street, the defend
ants entered and took him away on a
charge of obtaining money under false
pretenses. The charge was dismissed in
the Police Court and the suit for damages
is the sequel.
Retained the Rents.
Mra. Louise Abrams. 1716 Pacific avenue,
swore to a complaint in Judge Conlan's
court yesterday for the arrest of Wil
liam Healy, a real estate agent, on the
charge of embezzlement. Mrs. Abrams
alleges that Healy collected $37 BO rents
for her and now she cannot find him.
R. A. GRAHAM
ACCUSED OF
EMBEZZLEMENT
Said to Have Taken a
Large Amount.
A SHORTAGE OF $200,000
BEAVER HILL COAL COMPANY
IS THE COMPLAINANT.
It Asks That the Court in Render
ing Its Judgment Direct That
the Defendant Be
Arrested.
An Interesting sequel to a suit filed a
few days ago by J. D. Spreckels Bros. &
Co. against R. A. Graham, iate manager
of the Weaver Hill Coal Company, devel
oped yesterday, wuen a second action
was brought against Graham by the cor
poration he represented. In the suit filed
by J. D. Spreckels Bros. & Co. the plain
tiff seeks to recover $523,162 52 on a prom
issory note dated November 1, 1897, issued '
by Graham and secured by 10,001 shares j
of the capital stock of the Coos Bay, j
Roseburg and Eastern Railroad and Nay- !
igation Company; 620 bonds of various de- j
nominations of that corporation, and j
many lots In the Railroad addition to \
Marshfleld, Or.
The suit Is purely of a civil nature, but
has a bearing on the action instigated
yesterday by the Beaver Hill Coal Com
pany, which directly charges the defend
ant with embezzlement, and after recit
ing its prayer asking for judgment in the
sum of $200,000 with interest, it asks that
the judgment declare that the amount
was embezzled, fraudulently misappro
priated and converted by the defendant
to his own use while the general manager
and agent of the plaintiff; and that the
judgment further direct that the defend
ant be arrested and that execution issue
against his person.
It is asserted in the complaint that Gra
ham became the â¢ company's iigent at
Murshfield, Or., in May, 1895, which posi
tion of trust he held "until December 15,
1897. He conducted the business of the
corporation at that city, and among Us
duties it was required of him to obtain
from J. D. Spreckels Bros. & Co. each
month sufficient funds to carry on the
business and development work of the
coal company under an arrangement en
tered into between the two corporations.
Through requisitions, it is alleged, Gra
ham drew from J. D. Spreckels Bros. &
Co. up to last March (467,029 20. and
through other sources received money ag
gregating about $100,f>00.
In December, when Graham'^ connec
tions with the coal company were severed,
he was ordered to turn over the property
and money in his charge, but contrary to
expectations he only surrendered JI4S6 14.
The books of the corporation he kept
until January 22 last, when he turned
them over to the company's agents. They
showed that all the money received had
been expended excepting the sum he gave
up when he ceased to be the corporation's
agent. These books, however, the com
plaint filed yesterday alleges do not truth
fully state the transactions of the plaint
iff's business: that they have been tam
pered with; that Graham has appropriat
ed to his own use moneys to the^ amount
of $200,000 and has willfully falsified the
accounts to cover up his peculations.
In support of these allegations many en
tries on the books are quoted as sums
purporting to have been paid out by Gra
ham in conducting the company's busi
ness, but which entries are known to be
fraudulent. One of the largest entries
claimed to be false is one for $30,000. It
was made on the books October 31, 1597,
and credited Graham with that amount
for logs sold by him to the plaintiff.
False entries for labor and material, it
is averred, have also been discovered by
the experts of the company retained to
investigate the books turned over by
Graham, and it is alleged that he is re
sponsible for them all and in consequence i
has become criminally the creditor of the
Beaver Hill Coal Company in the sum ',
j stated, $200,000.

SUES FOR A PERMIT.
Case of the Mutual Electric Light
Company Against the Super
visors.
Whether or not the Board of Super
visors Illegally refused the Mutual Elec
tric Light Company permission to erect
poles for hanging lights outside certain
limits will be decided in a few days by
Judge Seawell.
Some time ago the plaintiff corporation
applied to the city fathers for permission
to erect the poles, but it was refused.
The corporation did not ask for a fran
chise, simply a permit, and was at a loss
to understand the -refusal of its request.
Mandamus proceedings were commenced
in consequence to compel the board to is
sue the permit. The case was argued yes
terday before Judge Seawell and submit
ted for the consideration of the court.
Wanted for Betrayal.
Sybil Murphy, 911 Valencia street,
swore to a complaint in Judge Low's
court yesterday for the arrest of Ed
ward J. Chase, a pugilist, on the charge
of betrayal under promise of marriage.
He refuses to marry her.
