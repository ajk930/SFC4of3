ALGER LAYS ALL
BLAME ON THE
CAMP OFFICERS
Says They Alone Were F^espoQsible
for the Mortality in the
Arroy.
General Waites Accuses Quartermasters Lee
and Ludington Point BlanK of Gross
Neglect.
KNOXVILLE, Tenn.. Sept. 21.â The
Secretary of War, who to-day in
spected Camp Poland and reviewed the
enlisted men encamped, made a speech
to the commanding officers at General
McKee's headquarters during the
morning. In which he flexed the blame
for the sickness in the camps through
out the country on the commanding
officers.
General Alger congratulated General
McKee on the splendid condition of the
camp and the troops. He expressed
satisfaction at the location of the
camp and the showing made by the
men.
After the review .of the troops In
camp General Alger asked the com
manding officers to assemble at Gen
eral McKee's headquarters, and at the
latter's tent the Secretary was sur
rounded by the officers and the Knox
vilte citizens' committee. He removed
his hat and in a delicate and carefully
worded speech said:
I came here to visit this camp for tho
purpose of acquainting myself . with the
conditions and to see for myself just how
the troops are faring and to hear from
the officers any recommendation which
they think may benefit the camp.
I want to hear what the commanders
have to say about division hospitals and
regimental hospitals more especially.
There has been a great deal of talk about
the conditions of the camp hospitals.
I want to say that had the "War De
partment been acquainted with j the con
ditions said to , have existed at Chicka
mauga, the troops there would have been
moved long before they were.
We received only good reports at Wash
ington from the commanding officers and
It was supposed that the outside reports
were exaggerated.

Is no reason why conditions other than i
the best possible should exist.
LEXINGTON, Ky., Sept. 21.â A
prominent gentleman close to the na
tional administration as well as to the
officers here at Camp Hamilton says
the tour of inspection of the Southern
camps by Secretary Alger, XJuarter
master General Ludington and Surgeon
General Sternberg will develop nuraer-i
ous charges from regimental and gen
eral field officers against both the med
ical and the quartermaster's depart
ments, â  and especially against some
commissaries. The talking was begun
here to-day by General Waites against
the quartermasters, and other officers
â will add testimony before the tour is
over. Secretary Alger stated that all
of this information and all other evi
dence that he could secure would be
presented to the investigation commit
tee at Washington. .
At the conference last night of Sec
retary Alger with General Breckin-
ridge, the commander of Camp Ham
ilton, and other officers General Sanger
said that the division hospital
might be a "good thing as now con
ducted it had been a disgrace to the
service; that it had deprived the regi
ments of their Burgeons and caused
hardships on the sick, who would have
had better attention at the proper
time. Surgeon General Sternberg in
reply insisted that all requisitions had
been honored in Washington and that
any medical men failing to do their
duty should be reported.
General Waltes told Secretary Alger
that the failure of some quartermasters
to furnish supplies was criminal. While
in Chickamauga he frequently made re
quests which were not honored. An
imperative order had been sent to have
all water boiled. He had made a requi
sition on Quartermaster General Lee
for water boilers. No attention was
paid to his requisition and he repeated
ly urged Quartermaster General Lee
to send the boilers; and, telling him
how the men were contracting typhoid
fever, he met with a reply which read:
BUTLER'S OFFICERS
APPEAL FOR AID
Proof of the Cruelty of the De
mar)d for Duty on the
Comal's Cargo.
HAVANA, Sept. 21.â 50 convinced of the necessity for special re- <
lief here have the officers of General Butler's staff become that they. <
are writing home soliciting friends for contributions, and they have Â»
requested me to do so through The Call and Herald. As result of â¢
trustworthy reports and their own investigations the officers are con- Â»
vinced that the amount of suffering here not only makes the demand i
of $60,000 duty for the Comal's cargo an act of cruelty, but also i
necessitates charitable contributions of fresh milk and other delicacies i
such as the Comal does not carry. The commission has no fund for â¢
euch purposes, and the strain on private purses is already consider- 1
able. i
The San Francisco Call
"The War Department does not fur
nish boilers."
General Waites then purchased the
boilers himself, but the seeds of ty
phoid had been sown and the daily re
port increased the list of deaths and of
cases in the hospitals. Pointing at
Quartermaster Ludington, General
Waites said:
"Those men cannot say it was some
body else's fault. It was the fault of
Quartermaster Lee and it was the fault
of Quartermaster Ludington, who Is
s'tanding right there."
Ludington made no reply to Waites,
as Sternberg had done to Sanger.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 21.â The Quar
termaster's Department of the Army
states that the claim made by certain
officers that boilers were not furnished
for boiling water at*Chickamauga is
not true. On the same date that Chief
Quartermaster Lee telegraphed for the
boilers, 2000 were sent and a little later
500 more. It is also stated that the
soldiers would not drink the boiled
water because it had a flat taste, and
preferred and drank the fresh water.
CHARGES UPON WHICH
M'INTYRE WILL BE TRIED
One Allegation Is "Scandalous Con-
duct Tending to the Destruc
tion of Good Morals."
WASHINGTON, Sept. 21.â The attention
of Judge Advocate General Lemly being
directed to the complaint of Chaplain
Mclntyre that he had not been informed
of tho charges upon which he is to be
tried by court martial at Denver on the
26th inst., the officer very promptly fur
nished the papers in the case for pub
lication. The chaplain is to be tried upon
three charges, all growing out of a lec
ture delivered by him in the Trinity
Methodist Kpiscopal Church, Denver, on
August 8 last, referring td "In* *>attle of
July 3. The first charge is "scaudalous
conduct tending to the destruction of
good morals."
There are three specifications under this
charge, in brief that he referred to Ad
miral Sampson as reporting himself with
in four miles of the Colon, when she
struck her colors, in order to get his
share of the prize money; second, he |
charged that In the chase after the Colon
the Oregon met the lowa going to the |
rear and that "Fighting Bob took the
lowa to the rear and kept her there dur- j
ing the battle"; third, that Eastern-made i
ships failed to come up to expectations
because the builders gut their orders j
through political pull, and "did not care !
how much they cheated the Government." !
The second charge is "conduct to the j
Frejudice of good order and discipline." i
t recites the three specifications of the j
first charge with an additional one based I
on the chaplain's "public and contemptu- |
ous" reference to Captain Evans as t
"Fighting Bob." The third charge is
"conduct unbecoming an officer of the
navy," and recites the same specifica
tions.

j who has been in the city for several days, j
to-day consummated a deal whereby his i
! company has come into the possession of \

MILLPOND MYSTERY
NEARING SOLUTION
Dismembered Corpse Identified as That of Emma
Gill arjd Or>e Arrest for Murder
Made.
BRIDGEPORT, Conn., Sept. 21.â Another development in the yellow millpond mystery was made
known to-day with the announcement of the arrest in Hartford of Walter C. Foster. The police have reached
the conclusion that the young woman whose dismembered corpse was found in the pond last week was Emma
Gill, daughter of Harry Gill, of Southington. Young Foster is accused of being an accomplice in the murder of
Miss Gill.
Miss Gill was 24 years of age and had been employed as a domestic in the family of James H. Pratt
of Southington. Her brother described a mole upon her neck and a similar mark' was found on the corpse.
The brother told how his sister started on a vacation. At tho end of the two weeks she returned home, but
announced to Mr. Pratt that she was ill and was going away again. To her parents she stated that her
suitor, Walter Foster, of Hartford, had a sister living in Stratford, and she had invited her there. Two
letters sent by the parents to the daughter were answered, but a third one, with directions on the outside to
the postmaster to return within three days if not called for, was received to-day unopened.
Mrs. Dr. Nancy Guilford, a midwife, is suspected of complicity in the murde*. She has disappeared.
GARCIA AGAINST
INDEPENDENCE
Latest Report Concerning
the Disgruntled Cuban
Insurgent Leader.
Special cable to The Call and New
York Herald. Copyrighted, 1898,
by James Gordon Bennett.
HAVANA. Sept. 21.â There is
an apparently well-founded re
port, which I cannot confirm
without seeing him, that Calixto
Garcia is in the near future to
head the Cuban anti-independ
ence, pro-annexation party. The
motive attributed is his chagrin
at receiving only twenty-seven
votes when beaten by Bartolome
Masso, the present President,
and his soreness over the slights
cast on him by the Cuban lead
ers after his behavior at Santi
ago. His attitude then is said
to have been due to personal
feelings against General Shatter
and to be no criterion of his
sentiments toward the American
Government.
PAYMASTERS NEEDED
â¢ IN THE PHILIPPINES
WASHINGTON, Sept. 21.â A few days
ago orders were issued directing the re
turn to San Francisco from Manila of
three paymasters, as it was thought they
were not needed in the Philippines longer.
The order was revoked to-day upon the
receipt of a telegram from General Otis
saying that the men could not be spared.
He said that most of the paymasters in
Manila were employed in duties outside of
the regular duties Â»f paymasters. Major
Whipple, chief paymaster, was Auditor
of the corporation of Manila, Major Kel
leher was provost marshal and in charge
of finances. Major Lord was in charge
of the customs of Manila, and Major Kil
bourne was employed in another field
capacity. This made it impossible to send
the three paymasters home, as was de
termined.

INDIVIDUALLY.
Give Hearty Response to All That
Mr. McXinley Has to Say
About the Officers Who
Led Them.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 21.â President
McKinley to-day informally received a
delegation of about a dozen members of
the Roosevelt Rough Rider Regiment.
A majority of the delegation is from
New Mexico, and is en route home. It
was presented by Delegate Ferguson of
that Territory, who- stated that New
Mexico had furnished four of the cap
tains and 440 of the men constituting
the regiment.
Each of the callers was presented in
dividually to the President, who, after
greeting them personally, talked with
them and to them as a body in an in
formal manner. He spoke with earnest
enthusiasm of the work of the regiment
in the Santiago campaign, saying that
he was pleased to have the opportunity
on his own behalf and on behalf of
the country at large to thank the regi
ment, through the presented delegation,
with the work it had done.
"Your record Is one," he said, "of
which' the entire nation is proud. I tell
people who talk with me about the
Rough Riders that you left the boats
in squads of twenty or thirty inquiring
the way to Santiago, and that you
hardly stopped until you arrived there.
"You have not only done well," he
continued, "but I have no doubt you
would all be willing to again serve your
country in an emergency."
The response was that they would to
a man.
"We want our colonel to raise a bri
gade instead of a regiment next time,"
SAILORS FOR
DEWEY'S SHIPS
Navy Department Orders
That 400 Be Sent to
Manila.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 21.â The
Navy Department has ordered
400 sailors sent to Admiral Dew
ey's squadron at Manila. The
men will be sent from San Fran
cisco on a merchant steamer. It
is the purpose of the department
to gather most of the men from
the Pacific coast, but orders
have been given to Lieutenant
Commander Vail, in charge of
the permanent naval recruiting
station in Chicago, to recruit 110
of the sailors there. This detail
does not amount to a reinforce
ment of the forces at Manila, for
the men are to take the places of
sailors whose terms of service
have expired.
said one of the younger members of the
party.
The President also congratulated the
soldiers upon their good fortune in hav
ing competent officers to lead them and
met with a hearty response to all that
he said about Colonel Roosevelt and
General Wood and General Young.
The delegation comprised the follow
ing named members of the regiment:
Captains W. H. Llewellyn, T. Muller,
R. C. Day and M. Lun; Lieutenants W.
F. Danie, J. H. Carr, Thomas H. Rhin

GENERAL AUGUSTI
ARRIVES AT VITTORIA
The Former Captain General of the
Philippines Said to Look
Very ill.
MADRID, Sept. 21.â General August!,
the former captain general of the Philip
pine Islands, has arrived at Vittorla, cap
ital of the Spanish province of Alava,
about thirty miles south of Bilbao. It is
said that he looks ill and is reticent con
cerning the recent hapenings at Manila.
The general, however, admitted that ne
contemplated surrendering before the
capitulation actually took place. He also
praised the army eloquently and ex
pressed the hope that the Supreme Court
would pass Judgment on his conduct.
CORRUPT WORK OF
SAN JOSE'S BOSS
AIRED IN COURT
Sensational Exposures in Jarman's
Slander Suit Against
"Jim" Rea.
How Certain City Officials Were Bulldozed Into
Doing the Bidding of tf)e Political
Ringsters.
SAN JOSE, Sept. 21.â Rea's methods
of doing politics were ventilated in
Judge Kittredge's court to-day during
the proceedings in the Jarman-Rea
$50,000 slander suit. Ex-Councilman
Jarman related how Rea and Macken
zie had interfered with himself and
other Councilmen in the performance
of their official duties. Mayor Paul P.
Austin, he said, also was active-in this
respect. These worthies tried to dic
tate the election of certain policemen
and firemen.
As was expected the case will bring
out many new things in San Jose poli
tics. It establishes beyond doubt that
Rea and Mackenzie have been running
the city government for years and have
had control of all the City Councils.
The courtroom was packed. Jarman
was on the stand all day and had just
completed his testimony at the hour of
adjournment.
At the opening of court this morning
Attorney Burchard questioned Jarman
In regard to the date of his altercation
with Rea, when the slanderous remarks
were made. The witness was then
passed and Attorney Delmas elicited
the following story of the workings of
Rea and Mackenzie in politics:
Jarman said his relations with Rea
were friendly before he became a Coun
cilman. He was elected to the Council
in April, 1895, and about this time Rea
called at his home to discuss such po
litical offices as would come within his
power as Councilman. Said he:
"At Rea's first visit he importuned
me to support John E. Richards for
City Attorney. Mayor Austin also called
and urged me to support Richards.
Rea came to my store two or three
times in relation to the selection of
firemen and policemen. He wanted me
to programme and vote for the slate
he would make up. I told him I had
my own view as to who should serve
as policemen and firemen and would
exercise my own Judgment in selecting
them."
On the Sunday morning before the
annual election of policemen and fire
men Councilmen Jarman, Dittus, Krieg
and Martin met at the office of the
wood yard of Councilman E. P. Main to
go over the names of applicants for po
sitions in the police and fire depart
ments. They had been in session but
a few minutes when a knock was heard
and "Boss" Rea entered. In his usual
blunt manner Rea said:
"You people think you can get along
without me, but I want you to know
I have something to say in the matter."
Rea then went over to where Council
man Richard Martin was standing,
and, slapping him on the shoulder, said:
"What in hâlh â 1 are you doing here?
You know perfectly well you can't vote
with these people. If you do you will
lose your job Tuesday morning. Be
sides, remember that little financial
obligation you are under to me. Come
with me; get out of here."
Rea took Martin with him and thus
broke up the meeting. Martin at that
time was working for R. J. Langford,
Rea's present candidate for Sheriff,
and through Langford Rea intended to
enforce his threat of discharge.
Rea told those in Main's office when
he left if they would come to his home
in the afternoon he would arrange
things satisfactorily. Jarman's testi
mony about the visit to Rea's home fol
lows:
"Councllmen Main, Dittus, Krieg and
myself went to Rea's home. Besides
Rea there were present John D. Mac
kenzie, Major Starck, W. J. Wolcott,
superintendent of the Almshouse; Z.
L. Orcutt, superintendent of the In
firmary; Mayor Austin and Colonel
Bennett, Street Commissioner. Coun
cilman Martin was absent.
"Rea took nencil and paper from his
pocket and began to write down the
names of those firemen and policemen
to whom tr-~-e were no objections. I
was the principal objector. The first
objection I raised was to the removal
CAMP SITES SCARCE
AROUND HONOLULU
Reason Why Uocle Sam Will Seod
Only One Regiment for
Garrison Duty.
NEW YORK, Sept. 21.â The "Washington correspondent of the Her
ald telegraphs: There is no fixed opinion in the War Department
that troops will be kept out of Hawaii on account of a fear of dis
ease. The real objection to sending troops to Hawaii now seems to
be on account of the difficulty of getting a camp ground. It is said
at the department that the nearest available camp ground is 100
miles from Honolulu. Otherwise troops will have to camp either on
rocky sites or tillable rice land will have to be rented at a cost of
$100 per acre per year. This, it is said, is the real reason why the
Government may decide to leave only one regiment there for garrison
duty.

of Chris Shannon from the police force.
I said he was a very efficient and com
petent officer and a sober man. Bea
also wanted to drop Mike Durkln, an
other very efficient and competent offi
cer, from the force. I entered another
objection and said I would not vote for
a ticket that did not contain these two
officers. Mackenzie said some had to
be dropped to make room for others.
When the name of Joe Noltlng was
presented by Rea and Mackenzie for a
place as policeman, I also objected be
cause I knew Nolting to be a drunkard
and not a sober man. Mackenzie said
Nolting had to go on because he was a
brother of Councilman Nolting. Mayor
Austin said he knew Joe Nolting had
been drunk 160 days out of the year, but
he would vote for him in preference to
the *><Â»Bt man in the city on account of
his brother. During the discussion I
said I wanted to name James F. Reed
for policeman If there was a vacancy.
Rea objected. He said Reed had been
a tinhorn gambler and had no political
influence. Rea said years ago Reed
controlled the Spanish vote, but had
lost it and now had no influence.
"Rea had a slate made up for fire
men and this he submitted to Main,
Krieg, Dittus and myself. I objected to
Ed Mangin, because he had been be
fore the council for grossly insulting a
woman. Mackenzie said to me:
" 'You haven't a foot to stand on.
That man is worth fifty votes to us
and has to go into the Fire Depart
ment.' "
Jarman would not agree to these
slates made up by Rea and Mackenzie
and the "boss" got angry and said he
would wash his hands of the whole
business. Rea served some cold meats
and tea and coffee, and Jarman said
this was the hospitality the defendant
accused him of having partaken of and
then been so ungrateful as to refuse to
accept the slate.
Jarman said that on the following
day he, Krieg, Dittus and Main went
to San Francisco so as to delay the
election of policemen and firemen a
week, so that in that time influence
could be brought to bear upon Martin
to vote for a clean set of officials. He
said Councilmen Hogan, Nolting and
Mangrum stood in with Rea.
At this point Delmas asked this
pointed question:
"Mr. Jarman, did you ever receive
any money on the purchase of a steam
roller or any other proposition while a
member of the Common Council?"
"No, sir," answered the witness.
He said he had heard rumors that
Councilmen Fay and Nolting and Mac
kenzie had each received $100 for work
ing for a purchase of a roller.
Jarman said that at the meeting at
Rea's house Krieg wanted John P.
Scully for policeman and Main nomi
nated Buckley. Rea wanted to drop
Officer Prindiville, but Dittus objected.
The "boss" also suggested Eugene
Evans and M. F. Marshall for police
men. He said Wolcott, Starck and
other old soldiers wanted Evans. The
witness said Rea asked him to do sev
eral things, while in the Council. He
wanted him to vote for Richards for
City Attorney and to draw up an or
dinance increasing the Park Commis
sion to twelve. Mackenzie also had
been to see him.
Jarman said that when he announced
himself as a candidate for Supervisor
friends of Rea asked him to call at
the latter's office. C. M. Shortridge also
came to see him several times.
"On one occasion," said the witness,
"Shortridge said he would like me to go
around to Rea's office with him. When
we got to Rea's office Shortridge said:
" 'Jim, I want John to have the nomi
nation for Supervisor, and want you to
stand in with him and not oppose him.'
"Rea said: 'All right, if the old man
(meaning Greeninger) is not a candi
date.'
"Rea sent for me several times and I
went to see him."
Jarman said he never asked Rea to
support him.2

fact that there are some half dozen na

decide it in writing, conformably to the
provisions of this act and to the laws
and customs of Samoa not in conflict
therewith, and the signatory govern
ments will accept and abide by such de
cision."
It is wpII understood In Apia that the
German officials do not wish to see an
other Samoan King appointed. They
prefer rather a state of anarchy, which
would provide them with continual ex
cuses for pressing their claim to the
possession of the group. However,
they cannot override the Berlin treaty,
and by it, as the quotation just given
shows, they are bound in this matter
to abide by the decision of the Amer
ican Chief Justice. If the natives can
manage to elect a King, even by a
small majority, Mr. Chambers will af
firm his sovereignty and things will go
on just as hitherto. There will always,
of course, be a rebel party, but in the
face of European and American men of
war, it will be powerless to do any
harm. The situation makes it impera
tive that the United States should be
represented at Apia by an armed vee
sel, and if the Bennington is not or
dred there, some other ship should be
sent.
CULEBRA ISLAND FOR
A COALING STATION
Considered Better Adapted for a
Naval Base of Supplies Than
Is San Juan.
NEW YORK, Sept. 21.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: If the rec
ommendation of Captain C. M. Chester,
commanding the cruiser Cincinnati, is
adopted, Culebra Island. Instead of San
Juan, will be the site of the coaling sta
tion of the United States in the West
Indies.
The investigation made by Rear-Admi
ral Schley and Captain Chester has
shown the unfitness of San Juan as a site
for a naval station, because of the diffi
culty of entering the harbor, while bat
tleships of great draught would find it
difficult to secure sufficient water there.
Captain Chester examined Culebra Isl
and, one of the former Spanish islands
lying between Porto Rico and St.
Thomas, and found an excellent harbor,
well protected by a coral reef and hav
ing twenty-nine feet of water. It can
be easily dredged to a greater depth if
desirable.
MUNICIPAL WATER
SYSTEM FOR SAUSALITO
Plan of an Expert to Construct Works
at a Cost of Seventy-Five Thou
sand Dollars.
SAUSALTTO, Sept. 21.â 1t will proba
bly be only a short time until tÂ£e citi
zens of Sausalito will have an opportu
nlty to vote on a propostion that means
much for the development of this com
munity. The plan Is to bond the town
and put In a municipal water system at
a cost of $75,000.
About six weeks ago the Board of Town j
Trustees concluded that as the water sup- I
ply of ; the town was lamentably defi
cient the.'Bervieesof.a competent engin
eer t must be secured to 5 investigate. M.
M. O'Shaughnessy,, tho j Midwinter Fair
expert author of the Mill Valley
tera.was engaged to survey the ground
and give an opini6n as to the feasibility
of municipal (ownership.' He has care
fully studied .the situation, made the
proper surveys, and in a few ; days the
report will -be handed to General' Dick
inson, president of the board. Â£ : ;t .
According to Engineer O'Shaughnessy'
plans -about forty acres V of land on the
Gioli ranch, owned by A. Borel, will have
to be purchased and a vast reservoir
built. i From this reservoir,' a : tunnel can ' '
be-<consHruÂ«ted at a cost about $7000
niT'Â°^ a^f .n Ollgh , which the mains
will lead. .This will make. a system sufil- ',
cient for the needs of a town ten times
as large as Sausalito. ..-;â â  â¢ â 
â â¢â¢: O'Shaughnessy. completely -ignores the
propostion of buying, the property of the'
two companies that have failed to fur
â¢nish-the. town 'with; an adequate suunlv
of water. Verbally he has termed the
plant .of* the South Sausalito Bay and I
Land' any "a regular windmiil svs
tem." The Trustees arÂ« enthusiastic over
thÂ» proposition of municipal ownership '.'.

SANTA CRUZ, Sept. 21.-Judge Bahrs

REPORTED BRUTALITY
TO CAPTIVE PRIESTS
Major General Otis Asked to Investi
gate a Story of Outrages by
Filipinos.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 21.â Mgr. Martin
elli, the apostolic delegate in Washing
ton, yesterday received a cablegram from
Cardinal Rampolla informing him that
the Bishop of New Segovia, Philippine
Islands, and several Catholic priests had
been arrested by the insurgents and Â«rere
imprisoned and being cruelly treated by
their captors. Cardinal Rampolla di
rected Mgr. Martinelli to lay the case be
fore the War Department with a request
that some action, if possible, be taken
to protect the prisoners from harm.
Mgr. Martinelli presented the facts as
communicated to him to Secretary Mei
klejohn Rnd urged that the department
communicate with General Otis, in com
mand of the American forces in Manila
with a view .to affording relief to the
captured priests.
In compliance with the request, Sec
retary Melklejohn directed that General
Otis be informed of the situation of the
priests and asked to protect them from
bad treatment if they were in his Juris
diction.
In response to this order General Otis
cabled the department to-day as follows:
"MANILA, Sept. 21.â Adjutant General
Washington: Beueve reports of extent of
brutality to Spanish priests exaggerated
Will send officer to investigate, which will

CLE\ JLAND, 0., Sept. 21.â C. W.
Metcalf of 60 Linwood street, whose
son. Barton Metcalf, diea recently in
San Francisco from typhoid pneumonia,
contracted while at Camp Merritt while
a member of the United States regu
lars, will take steps to have charges
preferred agairmt Major General Otis,
now in command of the American
forces in the Philippines. Metcalf said
to-day:
"I am a .member of an organization
made up of people all over the country
who lost relatives or friends who had
enlisted in the regular army for service
in the Philippines. These men died
through exposure on that pestilential
spot kno vn as Camp Merritt. Each
member of this organization will bring
pressure to bear on his Congressman to
have charges preferred against General
Otis, who located the camp where it
was.
"The organic .tion is a large and in
fluential one, and I believe it will be
able to accomplish the object for which
it was formed. I don't suppose a more
unhealthy spot for the location of a
military camp could have been found
on- the whole Pacific Coast than that
of Camp Merritt. The camp was open
to thi sea and during the moÃt of the
day iog was so dense there that one
could hare aistinguish the form of a
man at a dtstance of thirty or forty
feet. A soldier on picket duty would
be wet to the shin before he had stood
in that fog half an hour."

WOULD ABOLISH
THE EXAMINERS
A Joker in Amendment
No. 3.
HAS SWEEPING PROVISIONS
SECRETARY GORMAN MAKES A
DISCOVERY.
Says That Were the Measure Adopted
the Board Would Be Displaced
by the Proposed Court
of Claims,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 21.â J. C. Gor
man, secretary of the State Board of
Examiners, claimed to-night to have
discovered that the effect of constitu
tional amendment No. 3, to be voted on
in November next, will be to abolish
the Board of Examiners, and throw the
business affairs of the various branches
of government Into chaos.
The amendment provides for the cre
ation of a court of claims, to consist
of any three Judges of the Superior
Court who may be required to hold
court at the regular terms thereof,
which shall be once every four months,
at Los Angeles, San Francisco and
Sacramento. Gorman asserts that the
purpose of the court, as contemplated
by the lawmakers, was to relieve the
Legislature of such ancient claims as
the Jordan bill and thus facilitate leg
islation. But the amendment sweep
ingly provides that the court of
claims "shall have exclusive jurisdic
tion to hear and determine all claims
of every kind and character against the
State," which, of course, means the
claims of all State offices and Institu
tions now passed on by the Board of
Examiners.
Gorman declares that in order to han
dle these claims, which accumulate
with amazing rapidity, the Board of
Examiners is obliged to meet from five
to ten times each month and the claims
often number 1800 a month. He de
clares that if the bills are to wait over
for four months, the court of claims
will be swamped with them and will
find it impossible to scrutinize them
with the care allowable under the ex
isting Bystem. Moreover, Secretary
Gorman asserts that contractors who
furnish supplies to the various State
institutions and offices will figure on
having to wait four and probably eight
months for their money, and they will
charge the State correspondingly
higher prices.
Secretary Gorman asserts that the
far-reaching effect of the proposed
amendment had not before been sus
pected, and he was confident that he
was the only member of the Board of
Examiners who had discovered the im
port of the measure and foreseen the
confusion into which it Is bound to
plunge the business affairs of the State
if adopted.
GOLD STANDARD INDORSED.
Washington Republicans Name a
State Ticket.
TACOMA, Sept. 21.â The Republican
State convention nominated the following
ticket to-day:
Congressmenâ W. T. Jones of Yakima
and Francis W. Cushman of Tacoma.
Judges of the Supreme Courtâ Mark A
Fullerton of Colfax and T. J. Anderson of
Walla Walla (renominated).
The nominations of Jones and Cushman
were by acclamation, and the nomina
tions of the Supreme Judges were made
unanimous before the result of the first
and only ballot was announced.
The platform was adopted just as it
came from the committee. There was
some controversy in the committee on
the financial plank and the subject of
territorial expansion. The Eastern Wash
ington delegates wanted to incorporate
the St. Louis financial plank, but they
were outvoted by those from the west
side, who insisted on a specific declara
tion for the gold standard.

SIMMONS' COUP
HAS SUCCEEDED
Sheriff Not Likely to Be
Brought Back.
SPEEDING ON TO INDIANA
KIDNAPER OF CADWALLADER
UNMOLESTED.
Attorney Levinsky Will Not Ask to
Have Him Punished, and Judge
Hart Is Disposed to
Drop the Affair.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, Sept. 21.-It seems row
that Attorney Levinsky lost his chance
to regain possession of his client, Bank
Wrecker Cadwallader, because an at
torney in one of the mountain towns to
whom he wired to have Sheriff Sim
mons of Indiana slo ned took out a
habeas corpus writ instead of a war
rant. Levinsky was asked to-day
what his next move would be.
"It rests entirely with the Superior
Court of Sacramento," said he. "The
order of the court was legally served
and ignored in a willful, high-handed
manner. It is for Judge Hart to de
termine whether he shall take cogniz
ance of the Insult to the dignity of his
court. lam inclined to think that no
Judge would allow such an indignity
to pass unchecked and unpunished.
Sheriff Simmons is clearly guilty of
contempt and should be made to an
swer for his offense."
"Suppose Judge Hart should decide
to let the affair pass unnoticed, would
you go before him and insist that Sim
mons be made to suffer for his of
fense?"
"I hardly think that I would. It
would be out of place. This is a mat
ter that rests with the people of the
State. The law has been violated, and
Judges do not allow such acts to be
committed with impunity."
"Under what process could Simmons
be brought back?"
"He would first be arrested by tele
graph and then be returned on a requi
sition issued by Governor Budd on the
Governor of Indiana."
There are various opinions as to how
Levinsky could have captured his
client, even after he had left on a spe
cial engine. The one, however, to
which attention is called is section 1497
of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
Had a warrant been obtained from
Judge Jones and indorsed by him It
could have been telegraphed to afty
Sheriff and would have brought the
man back, so the lawyers say. The at
torneys say that it is the very proced
ure made to cover such cases as the
spiriting away of Cadwallader. The
writ of habeas corpus would not stop
the Indiana Sheriff, and it did not.
Mr. Levinsky said that had the person
to whom he had intrusted the work at
Sacramento done the proper thing he
could have 3topped Simmons In his
flight.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 21.â Levinsky,
the Stockton counsel for Cadwallader,
telephoned to the Capitol yesterday
asking the Governor to withdraw thÂ«.
extradition warrant issued to Sheriff
Simmons. The Governor being absent
in San Francisco, Levinsky said he
would carry his request to him there.
It is not believed here that efforts will
be made to overtake Simmons with any
process issuing from Judge Hart's
court because of the contempt.
PINGREE HENOMINATED.

EVACUATION
AND THE COMAL
Replies of the American
Commission Prepared.
STRONG OPPOSITION TO DELAY
HAVANA MUST BE THE PLACE
OF DEBABKATION.
Two Army Officer& Make a Trip to
Matanzas and Find Deplorable
Conditions in That
Province.
Bpecial cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1898, by James Ger
don Bennett.
HAVANA, Sept. 21.â The American
commission held a long session in the
salon of the Trocha this afternoon, at
which replies were prepared to the
Spanish propositions regarding evacua
tion and the Comal. These will be
sent to the Spanish commission to-mor
row morning. The propositions in re
gard to the Comal are not final and
further correspondence is expected, but
the Americans are likely to stick to
the original request that Havana shall
be the place of debarkation.
Regarding evacuation dates for the
beginning and ending of troop move
ments they are far from those sug
gested in the Spanish document, from
which the reply differs in many vital
respects. The tone of the American
communication shows the commission's,
determination to lose as little time as
possible, and insists on prompt action.
Captain Page and Lieutenant Reed
returned from Matanzas last evening,,
havine: gathered much valuable infor
mation during the four or five hours
they spent there, besides having an in
terview with General Molina, comman
der of the Spanish forces in that prov
ince. They found the Spaniards and
Cubans in the city apparently on good
terms. They were told that commerce
was utterly interrupted, the municipal
ity long bankrupt; that there was no
gas; that the surrounding plantations
were idle, many simply from a lack of
oxen and other means of cultivation.
Poverty was manifest on every side,
and the officers had to take refuge at
a hotel from swarms of persons of all
descriptions asking for alms.
MADE A BUSINESS
OF CHEATING WOMEN
Charles Hecking Says a Trolley Car
Would Not Hold All the Wo-
men He Has Married.
NEW YORK, Sept. 21.â "A trolley car
would not hold all the women I have mar
ried," confessed Charles Hecking when
arrested in Newark on a charge of swln- .
dllng a woman under promise of mar
riage.
If his own confeslons are true, he beats
Bates the Chicagoan. He is 65 years of
age, has half a dozen aliases and has
served several terms in prison in this City
and New Jersey for swindling confiding
women after promising to wed or actually
marrying- them. He is wanted in this city
on a .charge^ of having defrauded JVlrÂ».
Marg-aretta Doea of 508 East Eleventh '
street out of $500.
Hecking is a stout, smooth-faced Ger
man, has been rather good looking and
is as well preserved as a man of 45 years.
"Widows have been his especial prey. They
are "easy marks," he said. He advertises
for a wife, as a rule, in a newspaper
"personal," and, after arranging and hav
ing a meeting with one who answers, ne
talks the intended victim into the belief
that he is himself wealthy. In various
ways, particularly by promises of mar
riage and by making preparations for
such an event, he induces the women to
part with money.
To the detectives he laughingly ex
plained that his game works successfully
"because the women want to get married
and I want the women." Asked how many
women he had married, he thought for a
minute, and answered: "A trolley -car
would not hold all the women I have
married."
BREAK IN TXJRLOCK TUNNEL.
Considerable Damage Caused by a
Washout at Tuxpins.
MODESTO. Sept. 21.â Word was re

the canal from the diverting dam at j^a
Grange, and had filled up back of the fill
Suddenly the fill gave way. The cut is
about thirty feet wide and eighteen ieet
deep.
The roar of the water was very gTeat
and the damage was considerable, aside
from the delay caused by t"he mishap. It
is now considered advisable \o flume to a'
point for a much greater distance than
the width of the break.

Reports Cause the Dispatch of

BY SOL N. SHERIDAN.
Bpedal cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett.
MANILA. Sept. 21.â Unless checked
by the American forces In the Philip
pines it seems more than probable that
the rebels under Agulnaldo will soon
have seized all the southern lÃlands of
the group.
The steamship Abbey has arrived off
the west coast. She carries a cargo of
arms and ammunition for A^ruinaldo's
forces. After landing these munitions
of war the Abbey is to proceed to the
southern Islands. She will carry a
large force of rebel troops. These
troops, who are now well armed, pur
pose attacking the Spanish garrisons of
the islands to the south, and unless
there is prompt interference there
seems little doubt that the expedition
will be successful.
Alarming reports of the conditions at
Cebu have been received. These re
ports have resulted in the British gun
boat Rattler being ordered to that
point.
It is also reported that Admiral
Dewey has ordered the Raleigh and
the Baltimore to proceed to Cebu, but
this I have not been able to confirm.
The stories of an attempt to poison
Aguinaldo seem to be without any
foundation, and as on two previous oc
casions similar stories were spread, it
is probable they were gotten up for the
purpose of arousing the natives to
greater enthusiasm.
The report that the last Spanish gar
rison in the island of Luzon had sur
rendered is premature. The Span
lards still hold seven seaports In Al
bay Province, the principal hemp dis
trict. The disturbances have already
resulted in a diminution In the output
of Albay h?mp by 250,000 bales, com
â¢pared with last year's figures. Further
fighting seems imminent and unless
peace is concluded the shortage will be
doubled.

Devils Island, Where Dreyfus Is
Confined, Only a Short Distance
Away From the Scene
of Trouble.
BpÂ«cial Dispatch to The CalL
LONDON. Sept. 21.â A special dis
patch from Paris says the Deputy rep
resenting Fren h Guiana in the Cham
'ber has receiveu a dispatch announcing
[that a mutiny has taken place among
the convicts at Cayenne, the capital of
French Guiana. The mutineers, it ap- j
pears, overpowered and murdered their j
.guards, then stormed the military store
house and seized the arms and am
munition there. They are now, accord
ing to the dispatch, besieging the prin
cipal prison and It Is feared they may
succeed in freeing the 4000 convicts con
fined in the building. Reinforcements
have been telegraphed for to the Island |
of Martinique.
Devils Island, where Alfred Dreyfus,
the former captain In the French artil
lery, Is confined under sentence for hav
ing sold secrets of the War Office to a
foreign Government, is but a short dis
tance from Cayenne. It 1b possible that
the revolt of convicts may be the death
knell of the prisoner, whose condemna
tion has so stirred up the French na
tion, for his guards are under strict
orders to kill him if any attempt Is
made to release him, or if there is any
possibility of his escape.
Monterey's Tax Levy.
SALINAS, Sept. 21.â After long delibera

less than that for the past year. The road

A. B. HOTCHKISS COMES
OUT FOR HENRY T. GAGE.
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 21.â A. B. Hotchkiss, chairman of the First
Ward delegation to the Democratic Convention, has addressed an
open communication to Albert M. Stephens, chairman, and to the
fusion convention which has been In session at Santa Monica. Mr.
Hotchkiss says:
"I respectfully decline to act with you in the proposed abandon
ment of Democratic principles and in the organization as contem
plated by you, In pursuance of the conspiracy made in Washington,
D. C, between Senator S. M. White and Messrs. Magulre and Bar
low, members of Congress from California.
"This programme, as far as the State is concerned, has recently
been consummated by the launching of a State ticket headed by
James G. Maguire, Democrat, followed by a Populist for Lieutenant
Governor, with a distribution of offices to the Silver Republicans in
pursuance of this bargain."
Mr. Hotchkiss alleges that this conspiracy is made to capture the
party machinery of the three parties and regardless of their antago
nistic principles adroitly to blend them for office-holding and spoils.
Mr. Hotchkiss cites many reasons for his withdrawal from the con
vention. In an interview he says:
"I have washed my hands of the whole affair. I am for Henry
T. Gage, and will work and vote for him. I don't like the frame
that thing Is being hung on which they are patching up at Santa
Monica, and believe it best to absent myself, as a Democratic con
vention has no authority to surrender to the Populist or any other
party."

Merry Time.
WAR AMONG DEMOCRATS
CHAIRMAN STEVENS HOOTED IN
CONVENTION.
Populists and Silver Republicans
Disgruntled Because of the
Greed of Their Compan
ions in Error.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. Sept. 21.â The Dem
ocratic, Populist and Silver Republi
can brethren of Los Angeles County
have not been dwelling together in
peace and harmony at Santa Monica.
At noon to-day the Democratic con
vention was the scene of wild and riot
ous confusion.
The harmony committee reported
W. Hutton for District Attorney. A
motion was made to adopt the report.
An attempt was then made to adopt
all of the report except that portion of
It naming Judge Hutton as the nom
i inee. Chs-iiman Stephens refused to
I recognise the amendment, put to a vote
the motion to adopt the reportÂ£and de-
I clared it carried.
Then followed a scene the like of
which has not been seen In any con
vention In this county In a long while.
Delegates arose to their feet, stood on
chairs and tables, howled and yelled
and grave other evidence of disapprov
al of the action of the chairman. So
gTeat was the objection that the chair
man was compelled to reverse him
self. He had declared the report of
the harmony committee adopted. This
declaration he withdrew and the re
port was then adopted as amended,
which left the matter open and in the
position It was In before the conven
tion convened.
All the afternoon the wrangle was
continued. Judge Phillips appeared
before the Democratic convention and
said that If Judge Hutto'n would accept
the nomination he would withdraw In
his favor; but as Hutton had In the
morning papers announced positively
he would not accept, he could not see
his way clear to drop out of the con
test.
In the Populist convention a strong
feeling against fusion developed to
day. Some of the anti-fusion Popu
lists who are supporting Shanahan for
Governor drew up a resolution to the
effect that In the future It be the
avowed aim of the Populist party to
make Its electoral contests single
handed. The resolution was squelched.
The Silver Republicans also are dis
gruntled and they announce that In
the city election, which will occur on
the first Monday In December, they
will have a ticket of their own in the
field, simply to show the Democrats
how strong they are in this city. Many
Democrats speak contemptuously of
the Sliver Republicans and claim that
their strength at the polls is largely
mythical. The Silver Republican lead
ers propose to slyfw those kicking
Democrats that they are mistaken.
The resolution which had for Its ob
ject the placing of Senator White in
the field as a candidate for re-election
was not offered, at the urgent request
of the Senator himself. Nevertheless,
the feeling is strong that if a Demo
cratic Legislature is chosen and White
elected Senator he would accept. To
this proposition Senator White has
never made a direct answer.
With the exception of William Mead,
who was renominated in the Seventy
third District, the fusionists have made
weak nominations for the Legislature.
Mead Is in a Democratic district.
In the Thirty-eighth Senatorial Dis
trict, which is strongly Republican, the
fusionists have nominated a man
named Hudson. It would be Impossi
ble for any man to defeat A. T. Cur
rier, the Republican nominee.
In the Seventy-fourth Assembly Dis
trict the Populists have made a nom
ination that insures the re-election of
L. H. Valentine, and as he is an avow
ed candidate for Speaker it can safely
be stated that he is surely In the con*
test.
MID-ROAD POPULISTS
DENOUNCE FUSIONISTS
Walk Out of a Watsonville Conven
tion and Issued an Address to
Voters.
SANTA CRUZ. Sept. 21.â ThÂ« middle-of
the-road Populists do not take kindly to
the fusion idea of the Populists and
Democrats, and when the report on fu
sion was adopted at the convention at
Watsonville on Thursday, eighteen of
them walked out of the hall. They in
tend to nominate an entire ticket, and
have issued an appeal, which in part
says:
Since the formation of the People's party In
this county It has connlstently adhered to the
principles of Its organisation. From the weak
est of beginning's it holds to-day numerically
the second place among the three political
parties In this county.
Having labored for year* through food re
port and evil, having Â»eÂ«n our party grow
from ita weakly and Insignificant beginnings
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 1898.
to Its present proportions, shall we now tamely
yield up our organization and by fusion with
the Democrats Imperil or jx>sslbly utterly de
stroy at one blow the whole fabric of our party
so laboriously built up? And for what and for
whom? To foist into office a few designing
and self-seeking tricksters, who have vacillated
from party to party, worn all their badges
and professed all their creeds, have been
loyal to none and blinded by lust of place are
finally lost to the sense of their own treachery.
We denounce the action of the Fusion Popu
lists at "VVatÃonvtlle, who, without consulting
the people, entered Into a combination with the
Democratic party In an assignment of the
offices of this county.
We stigmatize the action of that body, which
denied to a respectable minority the chance to
submit the question of fusion to the sense of
the convention.
We therefore call on all true Populists for
their support, believing that In the future, as
In the past, we can lead our party on to the
position It Is designed to occupy aa an edu
cator and a regenerator In politics.
REPUBLICAN RALLY
IN MARIN COUNTY
Plans for a Big Jubilee, at Which
Hon. Henry T. Gage Will De
liver an Address.
SAN RAFAEL, Sept. 21.â Marln County
Republicans have determined to take a
prominent part in the campaign this fall,
a part commensurate with the reputation
the county has always borne as a Re
publican stronghold.
Judge J. H. Pryor of Sausallto, member
of the State Central Committee from
Mnrin, visited Chairman McLaughlin in
San Francisco yesterday, with the object
of having Hon. Henry T. Gage, the Re
publican nominee for Governor, address
a mass meeting In San Rafael. His con
ference with Chairman McLaugh
lin was most satisfactory, and it
is probable that Mr. Gnge will speak here
on the evening of October 4, the date of
the Republican county convention for the
nomination of county officers. The town
will be gayly decorated for the reception
of the candidate, the services of a band
engaged and other suitable arrangements
made.
The railroads will be asked to run ex
cursions from all points along the lines,
including San Francisco and Santa Ros*.
Headquarters have been engaged in the
Peters block, and campaign buttons and
literature will be supplied to the public
in abundance.
Judge Pryor states that the outlook for
the party was never better In the county
than this year. He prophesies a sweep
ing majority for Gage.
Flans of Prohibitionists.
SALINAS, Sept ZLâ The Prohibition
convention whlc.i met here this afternoon
made no choice of candidates, but passed
resolutions stating that it was deemed
inexpedient to make nominations for
county officers, there being no Pro
hibition organization In Monterey County
and recommending that all members of
that party in the county select and
support the very best men from
the other parties who will help the
Prohibition cause in the county. From a
discussion among delegates, the majority
of the candidates they will support are
on the Republican ticket.

RANTA BARBARA. Sept. 21.â As many

COLONEL EDWARDS DEAD.
Sudden Passing of the Well Known
Cleveland Horseman.
CLEVELAND, 0.. Bept. 21.â Colonel
William Edwards, president of the Cleve
land Driving Park Company and the
Gentlemen's Driving Club, and one of the
oldest and most prominent trotting horse
men in the West, died to-night at his resi
dence here. He had not been in good
health for some time, but his condition
was not thought to be serious. He had
Just returned from a drive at about 10
o'clock, when he fell to the floor and died
almost instantly.
Colonel Edwards was one of the most
prominent business men of Cleveland,
having been the head of the wholesale
grocery house of William Edwards Com
pany. He was born in S^rin-field, Mass
on June 6, 1832, and came to Cleveland in
1852. He was president of the Cleveland
Board of Trade for many years. Under
the presidency of Colonel Edwards the
Cleveland Driving Park Association gain
ed a national reputation, and the grand
circuit races heM annually on its track
always attracted wide attention.

MEN OF THE
EIGHTH ARE
DISCONTENTED
Conditions at Benicia
Unsatisfactory.
THEY COMPLAIN OF BAD FOOD
EXPRESS A DESIRE TO BE MUS-
TEBED OUT.
Sigh for the Bountifully Laden Ta
bles Which Prevailed at Camp
Barrett, Across the
Bay.
BENTCIA, Sept. 21.â There is a no
ticeable feeling of discontent abroad
among the men constituting the four
companies of the Eighth Regiment, re
cently detailed for garrison duty at this
post. The underlying cause for com
plaint Is the quality of the food which
has been served to the men.
This grievance has so worked upon
the feelings of the volunteers that they
have developed a marked distaste for
drilling and also for the more menial
duties that are embraced in the policing
of the camp. The officers have taken
heroic measures to subdue the spirits
of the men under their charge. They
put them through an hour's drill by
companies and then an hour and a half
of battalion drill each morning in order
to sharpen their appetites. They
acknowledge its efficiency in this re
spect, but the men affirm that it can
not make bad meat palatable. This
drilling Is done on a breakfast of coffee
and mush.
The men of the various companies
are allowed almost unlimited leave in
the afternoon and evening, besides an
hour and a half at breakfast time. As
a result of this, the majority of the men
who are supplied with money eat three
meals a day in this town, the principal
restaurant in the Union Hotel being
taxed to its utmost capacity. The
men who are earning 50 cents a day
are spending more than that to keep
body and soul together.
The officers do not disclaim that the
spirit of unrest has taken possession of
the men, but they affirm that it is
I chiefly among the members of Com
: pany F. This is the Oakland company
and the regimental officers hint that
while they were camped in Alameda
County they receivea many articles
from their homes that Uncle Sam does
not think necessary to place on the
bill of fare served soldiers in the field.
Inquiry among the men shows that all
are dissatisfied.
To-day the men fared sumptuously at
dinner time. They had steak, potatoes,
real gravy, bread and coffee. They
were jubilant at the change in their
fare, but attributed the marked differ
ence to the fact that the inspector gen
eral was expected and to the additional
fact that the newspapers had been in
formed of the prevailing conditions.
The grievances of the men date back
to the formation of th3 camp, nearly
two weeks ago. At Camp Barrett tne
men had a regular supply of fresh beef
and the company chefs, having accus
tomed themselves to the Buzzecote
or army ovens, were giving good sat
isfaction. At the arsenal here they
had to cook on regular ranges and food
that was not bad originally suffered
much at their hands. The post quar
termaster was hampered from the
start. He has on hand over twelve
hundred pounds of bacon that has been
condemned as unfit for use by two
boards of survey.
This is charged to him and he must
carry it on his books until the officials
in San Francisco relieve him of the
burden. This Is pronounced by both
officers and men as being absolutely
unfit for eating.
This is not the only bad meat against
which the men have rebelled. For
some reason they have on occasions
been served three rations of fresh beef
at one time. At the end of the sec
ond day the ration for the third day
was condemned. This was exchanged
for corned beef and more trouble en
sued. The h#ef was put down to boil
shortly before the midday meal and
without the water being changed was
served to the men. It smelled to high
heaven and the men amused them
selves throwing it at the cookhouse
door. On another occasion the com
pany quartermaster failed to take the
meat to the cooks until shortly before
noon, thus adding to the physical suf
ferings of the men.
Colonel Henshaw spoke unreservedly
of the bacon to-day:
"The bacon we have Is the same that
is supplied to all camps by the Gov
ernment," he said. "It is not good
originally and is. In addition, improp
erly cured. I believe the Government
pays 9 cents a pound for it, when It
could go out in the open market and
purchase an excellent quality of ba
con to-day for a fraction over 8 cents.
If badly cooked the bacon is fat and
greasy. On the other hand, when It
Is cooked to a proper degree there Is
absolutely nothing left to eat. There
Is from six to twelve ounces of waste
material in every pound bought by the
Government."
The men are complaining also about
their sleeping quarters. Until to-day
they have had to use ordinary shelter
tentsâ "dog kennels," they call them.
These are intended for temporary use
of men on guard duty or in the field.
They offer inadequate cover for two
men, but three are crowded In some of
them. The majority of the men sleep
In their clothes owine to the extreme
cold. Two companies moved Into bar
racks to-day and regulation tents that
were brought from Camp Barrett will
soon be put up for the remaining: com*
panles.
The men seem anxious to return to
the industries at which they were en
gaged when their country called for
volunteers. Like hosts of others, they
express their willingness to serve at the
front, but object to settling down to
garrison duty.
HERMIT'S MYSTERIOUS DEATH.
Aged Fisherman Possibly a Victim
of Foul Play.
SAN RAFAEL, Sept. 21.â John Burns,
an old fisherman, living at Black Point,
not far from Novato, was found dead on
a couch in his shanty to-day under cir
cumstances that point to foul play. Some
unknown person informed Constable
Louis Devoto of Novato of Burns' death,
and Coroner Eden was summoned from
this city. Two fishermen who lived in the
vicinity and were supposed to know the
cause of the death could not be found
and a summons was issued for their pres
ence at the Inquest to be held next Fri
day. A superficial examination showed
no signs of violence on the body. It is
thought that as Burns lived a sort of
hermit existence some persons may have
conceived the idea that he had a sum of
money hidden and poisoned the old fellow
In order to make a search.

PICQUART'S
SENSATIONAL
STATEMENT
Declares if Found Dead
II Will Not Be a Case
of Suicide.
HIS TRIAL IS POSTPONED
Accusation of Murder Renew
Interest in the Dreyfus \
Case.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Sept. 21.â The trial of Colonel
Picquart and M. Loolois, a lawyer, on
the charge of revealing documents con
cerning the national defense, was to
have begun to-day before the Correc
tional tribunal. The Public Prosecutor,
however, asked for an adjournment on
the ground that the prosecution of Col
onel Picquart on the charge of forgery
and using forged documents had been
ordered by the Minister of War.
M. Laboirie, who was counsel for M.
Zola during the latter's famous trial,
Indignantly opposed the adjournment,
which he said was an attempt to hand
over Colonel Picquart into the clutches
of the military authorities.
Colonel Picquart then rose and made
a statement which caused a sensation,
lie said:
"This is, perhaps, the last time I shall
speak in public, for I shall sleep, per
haps, in the military prison of Cherche
Midi. Therefore, I wish to declare that
if I find there the strangling cord of Le
Mercier Picard or the razor of Colonel
Henry it will be murder, for I have no
idea of committing suicide."
The audience was intensely moved,
and shouted: "Vive Picquart."
The Judges, however, after a short
deliberation, decided to indefinitely ad
journ the case, and Colonel Picquart
was led away between policemen.
Le Mercier Picard, the man referred
to by Colonel Picquart, was a detective
understood to have been employed in
the Dreyfus affair, who was found
hanged in his lodgings about a year
ago under circumstances which casts a
doubt upon the theory put forward that
he had committed suicide.
The papers here say that the Minister
of "War, Genera i Chanoine, has exam
ined the documents in the Dreyfus cue
and has ordered the prosecution
Colonel Picquart on the charge of forg
ery and using forged documents.
NO RAZOR FOUND IN
COLONEL HENRY'S CELL
Evidence Backing" TJp the Story That
He Did Not Take His Own
Life.
LONDON, Sept. 21.â The Dally News
says It hears from a good source that
the Italian Embassador at Paris, Count
Terniolll Brusali di Vergano, obtained
assurances from the Government In
January that Colonel Henry's forgery
should be withheld from the public, but
the newspapers, getting hold of the
contents of the document, M. Cavaig
nac, the Minister of War, was con
fronted with the choice of either ex
posing Colonel Henry or having the
matter exposed from the outside.
The paper also says it is alleged that
no razor was found in the prison cell
after Colonel Henry was alleged to
have committed suicide and It was sug
gested that he was assassinated.

My mother's headaches were of the sort that people call ste*
headache. They always were in some way the result of a disturbed
stomach. She;would have them sometimes more than once a week,
and then she might go several weeks c without â¢ having one. Generally '
an attack would only spoil one day, but sometimes she would be sick
, for two or three days. When she learned about Ripans Tabules, she "
found that ; they ; always â  relieved her ; decidedly, f and j her attacks are
i now much less frequent than they used to be. She continues to make
nse of the Tabules when occasion arises, but she says that now one or
two will not produce the effect they did in the beginning. She keeps
a supply of them in the houseall the timo, and I believe If she would
take them i according to directions, they would cure her entirely. You r
know her life is that of a farmer's wife. I suppose her experience is
that of thousands \of others who stay pretty closely at : home and de-
pend for '* food mainly f upon those things which the farm produces. -
Under such conditions the stomach '..will get upset now and then uhlejr
precautions are taken to avoid it. Ripans Tabules arc

MARPLOT BEATS LEBERTINE
TAVOBITES FARE WELL AT
SACRAMENTO.
Jtforinga Outfoots Amasa in a Six-
Furlongs Dash, and Bey del
Tierra Captures the
Mile Event.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 21.â After his ex
ercise gallop In the last oven* to-day, a
â¢even furlong run, Rubicon, with his sys
tem thoroughly permeated with Montana
atmosphere, appears to be about the best
horse in training here. Tbe big chestnut
was a prohibitive favorite in the betting,
utterly outclassing his field. He reeled off
the first five furlonps In 1:01&, and fin
ished strong in 1:27%. The â  California
Jockey Club will offer a special purse for
him and Grady to run for on Friday
next, on which day it is Just possible the
majority of the downtown merchants will
â hut up shop for a half-day. In the same
race Nash on Hemera, the' second choice,
gave a glowing exhibition of Incompeten
oy, and should be relegated to the barn
tor exercise purposes only.
Perfect weather for running drew a
â lightly increase*! attendanqe to the park,
and the sport itself shows marked im
provement with wear. Followers of the
favorites again got away with the coin.
Headwater in the opening event proving
the only disappointment.
The mile-and-a-slxteenth handicap drew
out a slim field, but it furnished quite a
betting affair between Marplot, with 98
pounds up, and Libertine, with 112 in the
saddle. At post time it was 4 to 6 and
take your pick. LJbertine was first to
â trike the bend for home but from there
on he was outfooted and beaten out three
lengths by Marplot, piloted by Houck, the
tough kid from Hogan's alley. Red Glenn,
the only other starter, was given a sky
blue ride by Ryan. With some urging the
old gelding could have been closer up at
the wire.
Headwater, racing in the colors of
Bookmaker Hugh Jones, was favorite for
the opening event for two-year-olds at
five furlongs, but after looking a winner
at the head of the stretch he finished
third. He was ridden by Henry Shields,
end should run better next time out. Na
pian, the Burns & Waterhouse entry,
going to the post at odds of 5 and 6 to
I, won cleverly from Ann Page. The
others were a poor lot.
Rey del Tierra was started back again
to-day in the mile selling run, and, a 1 to
3 favorite won all the way. Dolore took
the place from Kruna without much ef
fort. Frawley's weak effort aboard Loch
Ness kept that horse out of the money.
It looks as though Tom Boyle's Morlnga
has the measure of the selling platers
here. The brown gelding ruled a 7 to 10
choice for the third event of the day, a
alx furlong sprint, and, overhauling
Amasa a furlong from the stand, beat
that fast sprinter two lengths In 1:15 flat.
Show honors went to Toribio. The start
ruined the chances of Lady Ashley, the
second choice.

BISHOP HURST'S KIND WORDS
METHODIST CONFERENCE OPENS
AT SANTA BARBARA,
Mayor Burke Welcomes the Dele
gates to the City â Missionary
Society's Anniversary
Observed.
Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
SANTA BARLARA, Sept. 21.â The
annual conference of the Methodist
Episcopal Church for the Southern Cal
ifornia district, which includes all that
territory south of the north lines of
Fresno and San Luis Oblspo counties,
opened at Grace Church this afternoon
at 2 o'clock with the administration of
the Lord's Supper. The church, which
had been beautifully decorated with
live oak moss, was crowded. The roll
call showed that with few exceptions
the 300 delegates were present. The
greater part of them have brought
their families and consequently the city
is crowded.
Bishop John Hurst of Washington, D.
C, presides over the conference. BiÃhop
Hurst ranks high as a scholar and a
thinker. His "History of Rationalism"
has been famous for a generation. His
handbook, "Outlines of Church His
tory," is known throughout the church.
The most important work of his life is
that in which he is now engagedâ the
founding of the American University
at Washington.
Hon. Edmund Burke, Mayor, of this
city, delivered the address of welcome,
to which Bishop Hurst responded. After
thanking the Mayor he gave a brief
history of the expansion of the Metho
dist Episcopal Church. He said that its
history dated with the Union; that it
wa6 but a small body of a few hundred
people at our independence and had
since grown with the countryâ with its
advance and its Western expansion.
This church, he said, was the first to
congratulate the President on the coun
try's entrance to the league of liberty
loving countries. The bishop paid a
high tribute to the great State of Cali
fornia. He considered it the most im
portant factor in our present history.
He said:
"California is the first to hear the
news and the last, to say farewell to
our soldiers. The courtesies, love and
gifts that she has given to our troops
when they set sail for Manila have
turned all eyes toward California. She
is the connecting link betwe^ our na
tion and our new territory in the Pa
cific."
After his address Bishop Hurst called
for nominees for the offices for the en
suing year. E. J. Inwood was elected
secretary; J. M. Rich, statistical sec
retary; F. D. Mather .treasurer; W. F.
Wenk, railroad secretary.
This evening being the anniversary
of the Missionary Society, the Rev. A.
J. Parmer of Lew York, one of its gen
eral secretaries, addressed the confer
ence. He reviewed the work of the so
ciety during the year and spoke of the
future plans of sending workers of the
society > the Philippines.

Ex-Mayor of Santa Barbara Passes
Away Full of Years.
SANTA BARBARA, Sept. 21.â Hon.
George W. Coffln, an old resident of
Santa Barbara, and twice Mayor of this
city, died suddenly at his home on Garden
street to-day. Mr.Coffln was widely known

and took care of his property in this
county for ten years. In 18S3 he moved
into the city and entered the real estate
business, and during the boom was very
successful. He was long interested in the
Commercial Bank, the electric light com
pany and the Cemetery Association of
this city. Mr. Coffln was 82 years old.

LAST APPEAL OF
NATIVE HAWAIIANS
Memorial Addressed to
the Commission.
WOULD RESTORE A MONARCHY
MAKE FINAL PROTEST AGAINST
ANNEXATION.
Robert W. Wilcox of Bevolutionary
Fame Says the Wrong Will Be
Sighted, as It Was Once
Before,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HONOLULU, Sept. 14.â The Congres
sional Commissioners are finishing their
work and expect to leave for Washing
ton on the 23d insL on the Gaelic. The
commissioners are now being deluged
with petitions and memorials from the
native Hawalians. The latter appear
to be divided; one wing desires the res
toration of the Queen; .the other di
vision accepts the new order of affairs
and asks for certain rights under the
new form of government.
The natives who favor restoration
held a mass meeting on the 12th. They
adopted a memorial, which was pre
sented to the commissioners yesterday.
The resolutions set forth Llliuokalani's
protest when yielding to the provis
ional government, January 7, 1893;
President Cleveland's review of the sit
uation in his message to Congress in
December of the same year, allege that
the annexation treaty has failed, the
Joint resolution Is ineffective because
It was not passed by the people 3f the
Hawaiian Islands or their representa
tives In the Legislature, and concludes:
Therefore, be it resolved, That as the
representatives of a large and influential
body of native Hawaiians, we solemnly
pray that the constitutional Government
of the 16th day of January, A. D. 1893, be
restored, under the protection of the
United States of America.
Among fhe speakers at the mass
meeting was Robert W. Wilcox of revo
lutionary fame. While a few weeks
ago he was an ardest annexationist,
and took the oath of allegiance In or
! der to qualify himself for a full pardon
for past misdeeds, he is now convinced
that he was wrong. The natives had
been robbed of their country, first by
the Provisional Government, then by
the republic and now by the United
States.
"It is useless to say that the flag over
there (pointing to the Stars and Stripes
over the Government building) will not
come down again," said the irrepres- I
sible revolutionist. "It was up before j
and came down again. The wrong was
shown then and It can be shown
again. It will be shown that the an
| nexation movement was carried
through by a handful of foreigners,
and I tell you the flag of the United
States will then come down. If Amer
ica loves us, why were not Hawaiians
placed on the commission? We are not
represented there. Next thing we sha'.l
not be able to vote. No benefit to us
can come out of the arrangement.
Speak your minds. No one can hold
your tongues. Persevere. Work for
restoration."
The Hawaiian National League pre
sented its memorial to the commis
sion yea^erday morningr. Following is
the text of the memorial presented:
The Hawaiian National League, by its
committee, duly appointed by the several
delegates of the several branch associa
tions from the several Islands at a meet
ing duly held in Honolulu on the 12th day
of September, 1898, respectfully asks you
to embody in your report as part of your
recomendation to CongTess the following:
The form of government which would
meet the approval and serve the best In
terests of these islands would be in our
humble opinion, that of an organized ter
ritorial form of government, with the
right to administer our own local affairs
in the widest manner possible, not in con
flict with the Interests of the Federal
Government. Our reasons for asking for
this form of government are:
Firstâ That we have been accustomed
for the past fifty years or more to exer
cise the highest prerogatives of a sov
ereign state.
Secondâ That In the exercise of these
sovereign rights we have kept ourselves
free from foreign entanglements and have
given the greatest amount of protection
to life and property, enabling subjects of
other nations to enjoy tRe benefits of a
free and enlightened government.
Third â That under the new order of
things the form of government we pray
for will enable us to qualify ourselves for
statehood, should wealth and population
favor us.
We prey that we be given the right to
vote in all local affairs compatible with a
respective government, without any re
striction except that of an educational
one.
We pray that our Judiciary system shall
be kept in the present form as near mm
possible and that our Supreme Court ba
the last court of resort In all matters
pertaining to our local affairs, '
We pray that no contract laborers be
allowed to come Into the country, but a.sÂ« }
that a transition state be allowed th# J
agricultural interests of the country to
adjust themselves to the new condition off
things.
We pray that the local flag of Hawaii
be the flag that we have been accus
tomed to live under. Such an act ol
courtesy will be most pleasing and agree-"
able to the people of these islands.
We pray that, in the formation of our
local government we be allowed to make
appropriations for ex-Queen Liliuokalanl,
Princess Victoria Kalulanl and Queetfc
Dowager Kapiolanl.
MURDERED MAN'S BODY
IDENTIFIED AT SALEM
PORTLAND. Or., Sept. 21.â The body*
found in the river at Salem yesterday wa*>
probably that of Ray Sink of Wasco,
Circumstances indicate that he was muri
dered for his money. No reward has beett
offered for the arrest of the perpetrator of
the crime, but a person living in Marlon
County is being watched.
C. 8. Tate, a traveling razor hone ven-Â»
dor, to-day identified the remains as those
of a man he met at the Anderson Hotel
in Sllverton a short time ago. Sheriff
Durbin went to Silverton to-day and
found that the man described by Tata
was Ray Sink. He had been at Sllvertoa
several days but was missed about a,
week ago. He had come from his home,
four miles from Wasco, to the valley to
invest in a business or In real estate.
Inquiries were made by him as to tha
price of a livery stable and a confection
ery store at Sllverton, and he had bÂ«Â«i\
shown farms by Matthew 'Brown. Ha
exhibited a roll of greenbacks and was,
warned to not show nis money to every â¢Â«
body.
A story of apparent irrelevancr Is told]
of his having paid attentions to a girl
in the vicinity of Silverton.
Ray Sink was a brother pf E. Sink, and)
the two were owners of a large tract in
Wasco County. E. Sink, accompanied by
Harry Littlefl&ld, was in Salem last
Thursday looking for the missing man.
Sheriff Dubin to-night telegraphed to thÂ«j
brother and he is expected to arrive to
morrow.

HIS FRIEND
Fatal Ending of a
Boating Trip.
ASSISTANCE CAME TOO LATE
JOHN KAVANAUGH DROWNED
OFF FORT MASON.
The Heroic Efforts of John Scannell
to Rescue His Companion
Nearly Cost Him
His Life.
John Kavanaugh. a member of Truck
Company No. 5 of the local flre depart
ment, was drowned off Fort Mason yes
terday afternoon under circumstances
that were thrilling and pathetic: John
Scannell, also of the pome truck company,
who was with him at the time the un
fortunate accident occurred, barely es
caped with his own life in an effort to
bsvp his friend, and is now in bed at the
truck house, IRI9 Post street, suffei^mj
from the shock and exhaustion.
KaviinauÃh was granted a leave of ab
sence of ten days by his chief, and pre
vious to leaving for the country, sug
gested to Scannell that they take a row
on the hay. They went to the foot of
Hyde street and borrowed a flat-bottomed
boat belonging to Walter Cline, a fellow
fireman. The bay was rough and they kept
near shore. The breaking of an oar
while rounding Fort Mason decided them
to make for the landing. They man
aged to propel the boat beneath the
wharf and both tried to climb up the
etringers. Kavanaugh was unable to
keep his hold and yelled to his comrade
that ho was falling. Scannell seeing that
the boat was bring washed away and that
his friend would be drowned. Jumped into
the water and grabbed the boat. He
brought it beneath Kavanaugh and the
latter jumped. The boat was ipset and
Kavnnaugh fell into the water uncon
scious. Sc.innell swam to his friend's as
sistance and held his head above the wa
ter, battling hard- to bring nim In safety
to the landing.
People on the wharf witnessed the
catastrophe and heard the calls for help.
No boat being at hand they ran to the
Dolphin Boat-house and got one. The
heavy tide and choppy sea made Scan
nells task harder and harder each mo
ment, and seeing that he and Kavanaugh
would sink to the bottom before help ar
rived he allowed his friend to slip out of
hi? arms and thr-n struggled to reach
the rocks close inshore. Kavanaugh sunk
like a rock and no trace of him could be
found by the men in the small boat, who
laboriously pulled to the point where he
went down.
Bbldlen aided Scannell to clamber up
the rocks and carried him to their quar
ters, where he was given stimulants to
bring him around. After resting for
some houra he was given a dry suit of
clothing and sent to his truck headquar
ters.
Kavanaugh, the drowned fireman, was
about 27 years old, and lived with his
mother at liosi, }j yf i e street. He had
been a member of the Fire Department
f<.r about throe years. Three months ago
be was transferred from engine 3 to truck
B. He was extermely popular, and his un
timely loss is deeply felt by his fellow
flremen. The fire-house will be draped
to-day in memory oâ¬ him. His body has
not yet been reccrvered.
MODJESKA'S
CLEOPATRA
It Is a matter of dramatic history
that, some thirty and more years ago,
Dumas wrote to Modjeska asking her
to come to Paris and play his Camllle.
I cite this because it seems to give a
definite idea of Modjeska's age. She
was not a child prouigy when Dumas
wrote the letter. In Poland at the time
they considered her art quite adult.
Thirty years and more later â to be
punctual, it was last night â she played
the heroine of Shakespeare's "Antony
and Cleopatra" for the first time In
her life; played it gloriously, ravlsh
ingly. Age cannot wither her nor cus
tom stale her infinite variety â to bor
row some familiar but fine writing from
the play.
The years asked no odds last night
at the Baldwin. The conception of the
part, the detail of execution, the phy
sical and temperamental identity were
sure and consistent. One cannot say
of this as of her Lady Macbeth, that It
is beautiful, poetic and terrible, but
hardly bold 'and obvious enough. And
Ftill it is not the sizzling Cleopatra of
Bernhart-Sardou; it Is more subtle,
more unerringly seductive. It blazes
and rages in the proper season and
never is marred by the absurdities of
over refinement, but to the last thrill It
Is the Cleopatra of Shakespoire, ripe
with beauty, passion, wit, wiles and
mu.sic. Modjeska'i Cleopatra comes
late, but It will rival with the triumphs
of her youth and with Mary Stuart,
Rosalind, Adrienne and Magda live In
the gallery of her master creations.
Ladas Benda, a young nephew of the
actress, who designed the pictorial part
of the production, has been most for
tunate in reflecting the pomp- and
Bpiebdor of the scenes. It Is a Califor
nia production, and as such one of the
Ixst if not the best that we have ever
had. There is hardly one of the more
important scenes that Is not a finished
work of art. Although there are no
instances of individual glorification In
th" work of the supporting company,
the ensemble is capital and the whole
play moves evenly. Mr. Herman could
improve Antony by making him more
romantic and less heroic. But on the
whole the presentation is one of record
nnd will be a success far and beyond
s he few nights left for it at the Bald
win. ASHTOX STEVENS
Morljeska and her company will play
"Antony and Cleopatra" the rest of the

Native Sons Who Are Expected to Pat Dp a Rattling Good
Twenty-Round Contest in Woodward's Pavilion.
The patrons of first-class fistic sport who have concluded to witness
the Green and McConnell fight to-morrow evening from comfortable scats
should be up and doing, as the best seats in Woodward's Pavilion, near the
ring, have been sold.
Green was in this city on Tuesday. He looks exceedingly well and
was never so confident of success as he 16 now, owing to his greatly im
proved health. McConnell is resting at Alameda. He, too. Is in first
class condition and will assuredly give a great account of himself. It
would be no easy task to select from the army of pugilists now looking
for engagements two men who are as clever with "the mitts" as the
light middle-weights who will battle for money and glory Friday evening.
It should bo a contest of great interest to the lovers of clean and scientific
fisticuffs.
Green is a slight favorite in the betting because of the fact that he
got a decision over Tracey, who put McConnell to sleep under the auspices of
the Olympic Club. It is expected, however, that the betting will be even
money before the athletes enter the ring.

LAWYERS PAUSE TO
HUNT FOR PAPERS
TRIAL OF AN ALLEGED PER-
JURER GOES OVER.
Transcript in the Case of Carl von
Tiedemann Cannot Be Found.
Case Will Be Resent.
"When the case of The People vs. Carl
W. von Tiedemann was called for trial
in Judge Wallace's court yesterday morn-
Ing Assistant District Attorney Hinkle
requested a continuance. The defendant,
who was sentenced about a year ago to
fourteen years' imprisonment on a con
viction for perjury, has been tried three
times on the same Indictment. The Jury
disagreed on two occasions, but the third
time found him guilty, and Judge Wallace
Imposed the penalty mentioned.
On appeal to the Supreme Court "Von
Tledemann was granted a new trial be
cause of errors in the lower court's In
structions.
Mr. Hinkle explained that the transcript
of the record of the first trial, an abso
lute necessity to a successful prosecution,
could not bo found. Since the last trial
It has mysteriously disappeared from the
files and it seems Impossible to fix the
responsibility for its loss or to locate it.
An effort to overcome the difficulty will
be made by making use of the stenog
rapher's no'tes from which the missing
transcript wan prepared, and Mr. Hinkle
states tnat he will have the case set lor
trial within the next few weeks.
MADE A GOOD HAUL.
None of the band of youthful burglars
who, on Admission (lay. broke into the
Van Ness avnue home of Julius Krutt
r-chnltt, manager of the Southern Pacific
I Company i have been arrpsted. nor Is it
! likely that they will be unless Mr. Krtitt
schnitt insists upon their prosecution.
Of the thousand dollars' worth of stnff
stolen fully half has been recovered by-
Detectives Egan and "Tom" Gibson. The
property was found distributed all over
the western section of the city and con
sists of everything from a toy sowing nw-
I chino to a $150 clock. Tho latter wns
found in the possession of Jacob Hash, a
Junk dealer at 1416% Pacific street, who
had purchased it of Willie Glover, one of
the gang, for 15 cents.
The KruttschnHt wedding trousers, â¢*
piano cover, bundle of baby clothes and
a quantity of other stuff was uncovered
at the residence of Carl Seerin at 1513
I'ine street. . , â 
Other goods of various description were
found at the homes of Gus Zarr, 1457
Pine- J. E. Collins, 2012 Polk: August Mil
ler and AV. Compagna at 1435 Pine street.
A wagon load of coal scuttles, portiers,
door mats. Jewel boxes and baby clothes
is now awaiting identification at the City
Prison. Â
The names of the boys who were Impli
cated in the burglary, so far as the police
have been able to discover, are: Willie
Glover, Willie Compafina, August Miller.
John Collins, Carl Seerin, Gus Zarr, "81l
He" Galnsberger and F. Reavis.
Young Glover, the leader of the band,
had his arm broken on the night of the
burglary, and was treated at the Re
ceiving Hospital. He was climbing over
the fence of the Kruttschnitt home, when
one of the crowd yelled, "Cheese fer the
cop" In his hurry to get out of sight
Glover fell from the fence and sustained
a serious fracture. His plausible expla
nation, given at the Receiving Hospital,,
was that he "was playin' wld de gang
wen de cop come, and I fell over a
fence."

he had beeh instructed to take him to the
Burke, on being told that Haynes was
a dangerous man, took out his revolver
and secreted it under the lapel of his
coat, evidently intending to use It in case
of emergency. He went to Haynes' cabin
unaccompanied, and, meeting the tinker,
ho asked him what the trouble was. The
next instant a shot rang out, and Burke
fell mortally wounded.
The witness ran to his assistance and as
he reached him Burke said:
"For God's sake, George, get me out of
ere."
Cashel grabbed the dying man around
the waist and started to drag him away.
Two boys appeared shortly afterward and
assisted him in taking the wounded man
to the patrol-wagon.
Marlowe, after learning that his su
perior officer had been fatally wounded,
ran behind the horses attached to the
patrol-wagon, and, as if not regarding
that as a safe place, he started for a hill
some distance away. He then drew nis
revolver and lired four or five shots at
Haynes' cabin.
Ofllcer McKenna testined that he did
not tell Michaelson, the livery stable
keeper, that If Kennedy gave testimony
against Wilkinson that tne latter would
kill him. The witness also denied that
he asked to have his watch changed on
account of fearing that there would
be trouble between Kennedy and Wilkin
son and that he did not want to be a wit
ness In it.
William Michaelson was the next wit
ness. He said that on May 22 McKenna
told him that if Kennedy testified against
Wilkinson, thereby taking the bread and
butter out of his family's mouths, he
would kill him.
Officer Sheehan testified that he feared
that Wilkinson and Kennedy would have
trouble, and not caring to, be a witness to
it. he religiously kept away from them.
The witness admitted that he was not on
friendly terms with Wilkinson.
Policemen Brown and Blackman testi
fied that they knew Wilkinson always
carried an extra round of ammunition In
a chamois bug.
Policeman Merchant, one of the ac
cused, said that after Wilkinson and Ken
nedy had spoken to Haynes, he seemed to
be In an ugly mood, and as they did not
want to have any trouble with him, they
retreated. After consulting with the
other officers they agreed to telephone
for instructions to the Seventeenth-street
station, and were told to wait until Lieu
tenant Burke and posse arrived.
itfter Burke had reached the scene he
told his men to keep away as he thought
he could handle Haynes without their as
sistance. The witness declared that af
ter Burke was shot he emptied his re
volver at Haynes, but failed to wing him.
When asked why he did not attempt to
rescue Burke, the witness replied that it
would have been suicidal, as Haynes was
seemingly anxious to kill somebody else.
At this juncture further hearing was
continued until Friday night.

WILL INVESTIGATE SHRIMPS
STRANGE REPORT ON JAPANESE
BATHHOUSES.
Charges Against Inspector Dockery
Set for Hearing at a Special
Meeting Next Wednes
day Evening.
There was a touch of farce-comedy, ln-
Btead of tragedy, at the meeting of tho
Board of Health last evening. No em
ployes lost their heads under the official
ax, as had been expected, but an Italian
with a shrimp petition and a report on
three Japs in a bath-tub upset the grav
ity of the Mayor and the doctors, the
chemist and the bacteriologist.
The board was not ready to reduce its
force of employes so as to keep within
the $60,000 appropriation allowed by the
Supervisors. The members wanted more
time to think over matters, and it was
therefore agreed to indefinitely postpone
the subject of dismissals. Next Wednes
day evening the board will meet again
in special session and will hear charges
preferred against Food Inspector Dock
ery by Milkman Isaac Leipsic, who makes
accusations of ineompetency, favoritism
and Intoxication ugalnst the inspector.
At the same time the vexed question of a
reduction of the force will receive atten
tion. The members of the board had in
tended to caucus privately over this mat
ter last Tuesday evening at the office of
Dr. Fitzglbbon, but were prevented by
the illness of that gentleman. Dr. Wil
liamson is authority for the statement
that absolutely nothing has been done
toward selecting the victims for dis
missal.
At the meelng last night the Mayor
presided, all members of the board be
ing present except Dr. Fltzgibbon, who is
still confined to his home by illness. The
new member, Dr. Louis Bazet, presented
his credentials and took his seat.
Dr. Gallwey made a report in which he
stated that several hundred sick soldiers
would soon arrive from Manila, and sug
gested that the quarantine officials should
use great vigilance so as to prevent the
possible bringing ashore of any infectious
Asiatic disease. The board ordered a
communication, sent to the quarantine
officials.
Chinaman Tee Coon was present with a
long petition regarding the unsanitary
condition of affairs in Chinatown, and
making numerous references in uncom
plimentary terms to Chinese women. He
wanted some sweeping reforms. His pe
tition not being In readable English ,the
Mayor called on Yee for a speech, which
the latter delivered, pointing out the
numerous evils of life in Chinatown. At
its conclusion the Mayor moved that Yee
Coon's communication be held for future
consideration, and It was so ofdered. The
Chinaman went out distributing cigars
under thÂ« impression that he had scored
a triumph.
Next came an Italian with a complaint
against the newspapers for unjust dis
crimination against Butchertown shrimps.
He stated in his communication that the
daily papers had frightened the people by
stating that Butchertown's shrimps were
all deadly poison aIM the result 'was that
the masses would eat no shrimps except
those of irreproachable character that
came from places other than Butcher
town. The shrimp trade was being ruined
and Mr. Scatallna wanted the Board of
Health to Interfere and order an investi
gation of shrimps in order to determine to
the satisfaction of the public that all
shrimps were not disreputable.
The Mayor moved that the City Chem
ist, Professor Green, be instructed to at
once begin an analytical Investigation of
the shrimps in San Francisco waters, and
the professor was especially instructed to
use great care in catching his shrimps,
so as not to get the Butchertown species
mixed with the shrimps from outlying
districts.
Following the disposition of the shrimp
question, the board was confronted witn
a perplexing health problem as evolved by
Japanese bath-houses In the city. Dr.
Gallwey reported that he had found four
of these institutions inside the corporate
limits and that In one instance the neigh
bors were complaining of the refuse water
flowing from the baths. He had person
ally investigated, and found three Japan
ese in one tub, witn a third sitting on tne
floor, all using the same water, so as to
economize. He knew of no law compel
ling the Japanese to bathe one in a tub,
but he had ordered the baCh-houses placed
in better sanitary shape.
In this connection, a long letter was
read from a Japanese counselor, Masu
Mlyakawa, stating that fraternal rela
tions exist between Japarr^and the United
States, and for that reason it would be
courteous for the authorities to deal
gently with the bath-houses and not in
sist on sudden improvements.
Inspector Dockery presented a report
showing that he had investigated 812
restaurants and hotel kitchens, and had
as a result ordered forty-two of them to
abate nuisances.
Chemist Green stated that he had ex
amined twenty-five samples of butter
brought to him by various inspectors
and had found rone adulterated.
Both the Mayor and Dr. Williamson re
ferred briefly to the fact that the cut in
the appropriation of money for the Healui
Board would make necesary a cutting
down of expenses about $1662 per month
as compared with last year, and stated
that in all probability it meant a reduc
tion of the force of employes.
The August report of fiiÂ« statistician
was presented in printed form, showinpr
that the number of deaths fn the city and
county for the month had been 584, while
the births had only numbered 401.
INDEPENDENT FORESTERS.
Deputy Solomon Tells Them of Im
portant Changes That Have
Been Recently Made.
At the meeting of Court Yerba Buena
of the Independent Order of Foresters,
held last Tuesday night. Chief Deputy
Ben I. Salomon, who was representative
from California to the Supreme Court
session recently held in Toronto, Canada,
gave a very Interesting account of the
proceedings in the grand body and told
of the several changes that had been
made by the representatives in the inter
est of the order. He said the plan of as
sessments had been changed with a view
to equalize them, so that all shall bear an
equal share; that the per capita tax had
been abolished and instead there had
been inaugurated what shall be known as
the extension fund, which is to be main
tained by a monthly tax of 20 cents on
every $1000 of protection to the members.
The reason for the change was to com
pel all to pay alike for the extension
work of the order. It was also shown
that it had been decided to admit ladies
as members of the order, as a separate
organization, but working under the
same rules, it having been made clear
that from a point of risk women are bet
ter than men of the same age.
The deputy stated that he had suc
ceeded in securing a promise from the
supreme chief ranger to meet the depu
ties of San Francisco with a view to im
prove their work.

THEY WON A
HARD AND WELL
FOUGHT GAME
Victory for the Wat
sonvilles.
THE TOWN IS JUBILANT
COVETOUS EYES BEING CAST ON
THE LEAGUE PENNANT.
Martie Murphy Bepents and His
Friends Are Trying to
Make His
.f eace.
By Joe Corbett.
The Watsonvilles, familiarly known as
the "babies," for the first time since their
entrance Into the Pacific Coast League
won a game on Sunday last.
It Is said that they played an excellent
game and Qisplayed superb form all
through the contest.
The people of Watsonville love baseball
and were exceedingly jubilant over the
grand achievement of their "babies."
From all accounts, they have not such a
poor collection of players representing
their town. I have never had the good
fortune to see them perform, and there
fore can give no opinion of their ability.
Yet, I have heard from a great many that
the team Is composed of good material,
and will, In time, take some of the edge
off those clubs who are laboring under
the delusion that they are invincible.
Owing to the manner In which the team
entered the league, it would be unjust to
speak disparagingly of them. True, they
have won but one game in seven, yet It
often takes a month for some clubs to
strike their gait, bo to say, and as this
team emerged victorious last Sunday in
a game replete with steady and at times
brilliant piaying, It Is to be conjectured
that they will from now on win their lit
tle game regularly. At any rate, their
manager thinks so, and he certainly
ought to know Just a little about his
club's chances. In speaking of the team
In general he had this much to'say:
"Our boys received a most discouraging
start, as you. no doubt know, and we
attribute this to their unexpected en
trance into the league.
"Despite the many setbacks received at
the hands o! more experienced opponents,
utter discouragement did not take hold,
for we all helu that time and assiduous
practice would surely bring us victory,
in this we were not disappointed, as on
Sunday last our boys met and defeated
the Oaklands in a hard fought game. It
was the Urst game in which they ap
peared to have played the kind of ball
that they are capable of playiner. and
naturally the town, as well as myself and
the players, secured a new lease of con
fidence, as it were.
"With this confidence and the knowl
edge that it is possible for us to win,
great things may De expected from this
day on.
'â The team entire means business now
that the fates have smiled kindly upon
them, and are determined to win a few
more games before the race is over; and
confidentially, you may not believe it, but
we have a chance to win that pennant."
1 was compelled to disagree with this
enthusiastic manager, who was, despite
this fact, complacency itself, regarding
his chances of securing the pennant and
told him with equal confidence that I
thought his chances great if the other or
ganizations dropped dead or went to war.
He answered me by saying that he hoped
to sign two new men before returning
home, and if he should be successful Wat
sonville will indeed have a team inferior
to none in the league, for the men whom
he is after have only arrived recently
from the Eastern .League ballfields, and
as 1 have often seem them perform, I can
state, with the veracity of a war corre
spondent, that there is nothing in the
State that surpasses them-
It is to be hoped that Watsonville se
cures these men. They will strengthen
the team immensely and can coach the
lesser lights as to the correct manner of
making certain plays. One thing must
not be overlooked. Bunker of the dilapi
dated Frlscos is after them and ne
means husiness. If Anderson had ma
terialised, it might have been different. As
it is, Bunker needs a few good men, if not
a new team.
Wouldn't It be a good joke if. the
"babies" won the pennant?
Martie Murphy regrets exceedingly his
rash act of last Sunday. He does not
know what prompted him to throw that
bat, and he feels keenly the results It
brought upon him. There are scores of
people who are at a loss, like Murphy
himself, regarding the cause of his action.
I have talked with a number of them, and
thev agree that Martie is a very quiet
and gentlemanly fellow and must have
lost his temper entirely to do such a
foolish thing.
That Martie lost his temper strikes
me as being the only solution of this per
plexity, and another thing which strikes
me with peculiar force Is the smallness of
Pace in refusing Murphy permission to
use that bat. It was very unsportsman
like of him. and he should attempt to be
more liberal with his possessions. It was
really the first time I ever saw one
player refuse another a bat.
In the National League nearly all play
ers have their own private bats, and, un
fortunately, I have never seen a player
request the use of one, yet I make no
doubt if one were asked the answer
would be In the affirmative.
Pace is an Idenl player, and all he
needs to perfect himself is a loosening up
in ideas. If he had not been so close in
his methods Murphy never would have
handled that bat so roughly; but of
course his closeness does not in any
sense excuse Murphy's rashness. Noth
ing but repentance can pardon him, and
as he has promised never to do it again
it is hoped the league has compassion â
not only an him. but the entire team,
for what, oh, what will happen to those
Frlscos without Murphy?
The league in such matters is very se
vere, however, and I am afraid that the
thirty day suspension must go. despite
the influence brought to bear requesting
a $25 fine in place of the suspension. The
offense was certainly a cruel one, but as
Murphy lost his better reason and Is, be
sides, a genteel fellow, the league board
would not Injure Its dignity any by a
change of front.
These are the sentiments of many with
whom I have talked, and while they ad
mit the justice of the league's stand
they nevertheless hope that it will be
merciful.
ThÂ« conduct and playing of the San
Frnnciscos last Sunday was about as ter
rible as it could possibly be. Such :i
miserable game of ball I never saw, and
goodness knows I believe no one else at
the game would say differently. What a
show that team did make of itself, and
what a bunch of amateurs they are! I
heard from one who finds himself in a
position to know something that the team
complete is to be thrown out of the
league. Could anything more glorious
come to us?
MERCHANT CJLTTB BOXERS.
Sports Who Witnessed One Knockou
and One Eight-Round Draw.
The Merchant Athletic Club entertained
its members last evening with some hard
slogging. Billy Finn and "Kid" Hilton
opened the evening's sport with a three
round bout. Harry McLaughlln and Jim
O'Toole put up such a poor display that
the master of ceremonies, Billy Jordan,
ordered the would-be scrappers out of the
ring at tne end of the second round.
M. Mallse and Ed Martin were to have
smashed at each other for four rounds,
but Mallse brought the slogging to a sud
den termination in the second round by
sending Martin to the happy dreaming
grounds.
Jim Daly and Charley /ickers boxed
six rounds and Daly was awarded the de-^
cislon.
The event of the evening was an eight
round contest between Eugene Mulligan
and Jack McMahon, which also ended in
a draw. Mulligan scored a lead in each
round up to the eighth, when McMahon
rushed and caught Mulligan a few hard
swings on the jaw which dazed the red
headed lad. As Mulligan was reeling
around the ring McMahon again rushed
and in a mix-up the fighters fell through
the ropes to the floor. The referee con
cluded it was a good time to end the
fracas and did so.
NOT CONSOLIDATION.
The Opposing Parties in the San
Francisco and North Pacific
Board of Directors.
The officers of the San Francisco and
North Pacific Railway Company declare
that business principles alone governed
them in the leasing of their road to the
California Northwestern Railway Com
pany.
According to their point of view the
line which the new corporation will con
struct will be a feeder to the San Fran*
cisco and North Pacific, end that a great
amount of business, chiefly freight, will
be insured to them by the sixty miles
extension. The officials of the broad
gauge line asseverate that no Eastern
capital has been invested In the Califor
nia Northwestern, the new company
which has leased the old. The reasons
for this step are that the new feeder
would not have been possible of forma
tion unless Its incorporators were assured
of a connecting line which would lead
them to an advantageous terminal.
The two directors in the San Fran
cisco and North Pacific who opposed the
extension are Captain A. H. Payson and
J. B. Stetson. In July, 1897, It was unani
mously resolved by the directors to use
their best efforts to Induce capitalists to
form an extension line. Captain Payson
and J. B. Stetson at that time voted with
the others. Now when the corporation
is formed and all the terms agreed upon
it is said that these two directors dis
played a recalcitrancy that would have
accomplished something had there not
been five directors opposed to them.
The California Northwestern leased the
San Francisco and North Pacific, but the
latter road will conduct its own affaira
and enjoy its own profits as formerly.
SITE FOB, A SCHOOL.
Choosing' a Lot for a Proposed Build-
ing West of Castro Street.
The members of the Board of Education
met last night as a committee of tne
whole to consider the sites offered for the
proposed new school west of Castro
street. Real estate agents and property
owners had offered about a dozen differ
ent sites, but only four were considered
suitable. They were close in the vicinity
of Twenty-second and Douglass streets.
No decision was reached by the commit
tee as to which of the four sites would, be
the most suitable, it being proposed to
lay the matter over for a week to give
the directors, an opportunity to nerson
ally inspect the four pieces of property
offered.
The City's Cash Box.
Christian Reis, City and County Treas
urer, filed his annual report with the
Supervisors yesterday. Mr. Reis states
that the cash balance on hand June 30,
1897, was $14,160 22, and that the receipts
from taxes of all kinds swelled the sum
of total assets to $1,897,635 85 at the end of
the fiscal year. The disbursements up
to June 30, 1898, were $1,880J58 28, leaving
a balance on hand of $16. Sn 57.
A Wife Beater Sentenced.
John Lynch, a longshoreman living at
405 Greenwich street, was yesterday sent
to the County Jail for six months by-
Judge Low on a charge of battery upon
his wife. He has for a long time failed
to contribute toward the support of his
two children and took amusement in
beating his better-half.
Suicide in the Bay.

EXTEND MARKET STREET BITUMEN.
WHILE only a portion of the projected bitumen
for Market street has been laid, the improve
ment over the old condition of affairs is al
ready manifest. The thoroughfare had been an array
of cobbles, with sections of basalt, and here and
there a miscellaneous patch. It was painful to the
eye, perilous to the foot, a trap for horses and for
men. To walk across it was painful; to march over
its irregular surface a prolonged agony. It was a
creator of noise and confusion, a reproach to the en
terprise of the city. It was the first thing to strike
the visitor, and certain to give him a bad impression
nothing could overcome.
So pleasing is the change now in progress that a
hope arises that the improvement will not pause at
Sixth. street. It ought at once to be extended to the
junction with Valencia. With a smooth pavement
practically the length of Market, that avenue of
life and traffic would be something in which citizens
could justly take pride. The street is broad and
straight, almost as level as a floor, affording the finest
opportunity for the creation of an example of perfect
paving. So great is the space between walks that
with a double car line in the center there still re
mains room on either side for two driveways of
ample width. Doubtless the Market street company
will soon follow the excellent example of the city
and do its part of the paving. Then will Market
street be indeed a model.
Of course the necessity for keeping the bitumen in
repair is recognized. The time to mend a hole is
when the- hole becomes visible to the naked eye. In
cities where municipal government has been- more
nearly reduced to a science than here holes in the
pavement are not permitted to increase in size nor to
multiply.
For years there has been talk of the transformation
of the roadway in Market street. Now that the trans
formation is actually taking place it ought to be com
plete.
BRYAN'S UNHfIPPINESS.
WILLIAM BRYAN is unhappy
l under his shoulder-straps, and finds no com-
fort in his gorgeous sash. To him the sword
is a thing of no use â not even fit to toast cheese with.'
Military glory has not come to him, military duty
weighs upon him, and he is eager to quit.
In a recent interview with a correspondent of the
Kansas City Star he is quoted as saying: "I re
fuse to discuss any matters connected with politics,
the army or myself. * * * You may say I am
not so enamored of camp life that I would at the
close of the war apply for a commission in the regu
lar army."
After that much by way of preliminary the colonel
went on to give a specific statement of his sorrow
and discontent in his present situation. He made no
complaint that he had no chance to go to the front
and fight, neither did he murmur of the quality of
the food given him, nor suggest any incompetence
on the part of his superior officers. His grievance
arises not from a heart eager for battle, nor a stom
ach longing for better food, nor from a brain de
airing higher wisdom in his commander. The cause
of his grief is that so long as he wears his shoulder
straps, disports his sash and carries his dangling
sword he cannot exercise his tongue.
The colonel's statement as given by the correspon
dent who interviewed him is this: "If you knew what
Jt costs me to keep still when there is so much to
say about things of importance to the people and of
lifelong interest and moment to me, you would ap
preciate the strength of my will." When asked if he
would talk freely after release from military service
he answered in this expressive simile: "The country
knows how it is when a dam breaks; there is no tell
ing when the flood will stop."
Here, then, is Colonel Bryan's claim for recogni
tion as a hero of the war. He has kept his tongue
silent by a mighty exercise of will and the waters of
his oratory are mounting higher and higher against
the dam which that will has imposed upon them.
Every one knows what happens when an ever
flowing stream is restrained. Either the waters flow
over the barrier or the dam bursts. That is what is
troubling the soul of Colonel Bryan just now. How
ever stupendous be the dam of his restraining will, he
Cannot much longer hold back the flood of his words,
impatient for utterance. The quandary is upon him:
Shall he overflow the requirements of his military
office and talk, or shall he hold in and burst?
Johann Most takes the trouble to say that he was
no party to the murder of the Empress of Austria,
The declaration was needless. When there happens
to be the robbery of a hen-roost in Most's neighbor
hood there will be excuse for his assuming the defen
sive, or even trying to establish an alibi.
The Queen Regent of Spain favors universal peace
now. Her country might have enjoyed a larger area
of it if shÂ« had been an advocate of it a little earlier.
Perhap* if Bert Schleslnger had a string tied to
Jib resignation he would be tugging at It right now.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 1898.
THE ONE HUNDRED JOB CHASERS.
1 \ROTESTS from l'emocratic sources against
L^the action of the Committee of One Hundred
have now become so numerous and so forceful,
the more discreet members of the committee have
begun to ask themselves whether they have not gone
too far â whether, in fact, they have not been guilty
of that kind of blunder which in the world of politics
is worse than a crime.
It is impossible to do politics in this country with
out taking the people into account. Even the
stupidest of bygone bosses have known that, and
even the boldest of them never attempted to osten
tatiously force a ticket on the party of whose ma
chinery they had taken possession. The scheme of
the One Hundred is therefore a new departure in our
history. It is, moreover, such a departure as could
have been taken only by persons who9e self-conceit
misleads them into the belief that they are them
selves the people, or who are so contemptuous of
popular intelligence and manhood as to be indiffer
ent to them.
Boldly as the committee set about its work, how
ever, it has now begun to hesitate and consider.
The denunciations from earnest, self-respecting Dem
ocrats are becoming too strong to be any longer ig
nored. It is true the committee succeeded in getting
the Democratic State executive committee to set
aside the protest of Francis J. Heney against its
assumption of the powers of a nominating conven
tion, but the victory was not achieved without a
struggle, nor was it a victory that the committee can
be proud of. It was won over the indignant oppo
sition of Governor Budd, and was attained only after
the offensiveness of the scheme had been fully ex
posed.
It is narrated that a Pullman car porter, after
watching the proceedings of a band of train robbers
in depriving the passengers of their money,
made no other comment than the contemp
tuous one, "How crude." Doubtless Boss
Rainey or Boss Buckley has the same comment
to make on the raw work of this committee of job
chasers. It is crude. It is the feat of a clique of
petty would-be bosses rendered insane by a greed
for office or idiotic by self-conceit. If it achieves any
success at all before the people, then Democracy in
San Francisco will have as completely abdicated its
functions of self-government as the Populist fusion
ists did when they surrendered to the Maguire bosses.
THE CZfiR'S PEACE CONFERENCE.
ALMOST as swiftly as a shooting star blazes
across the sky and vanishes did the rescript
of the Czar calling for a peace conference
come and go across the news of the day. It was
hardly more than the sensation of an hour. Com
ment upon it was exhausted virtually upon the very
day of its publication. The only discernible ripplt
of action it caused anywhere was a slight movement
in New York to have the proposed conference as
semble in that city. To the world at large the re
script is already a dead letter, and affairs go on very
much as if it had never been issued.
It is by no means improbable, however, that this
rescript, so universally derided and so quickly for
gotten by the average man, may yet prove to be one
of the important events of the year. In the first place
it may be regarded as fairly certain the conference
will be held. The Czar is a very august personage
indeed, and his invitations are not to be lightly re
jected by anybody who has pretensions in the world
ot diplomacy. Our own Government has, in fact, al
ready accepted and given a gracious response to the
invitation to send a representative to the conference,
and other powers will surely do likewise.
Even those statesmen and rulers who are most
skeptical of the results of the conference will be glad
to assist in holding it, if for no other reason than that
of a curiosity to hear what the Czar has to propose.
That none of them have any intention of agreeing to
any scheme he may advance may be assumed from
the fact that all the great powers are now increasing
their armaments just as if a peace conference had
never been heard of. Nevertheless, they will attend
the council, they will listen to the proposals made,
and will then discuss them. It is at that point the
subject will become interesting and its possibilities
begin to develop.
The rescript is accounted of little note now because
it is as yet wholly in the hands of diplomatists. When
the conference meets, however, and the Czar's pro
posals are made public, that great body of taxpayers
who are impatient of the cost of heavy and increasing
armaments will begin to assert itself. There will
come a discussion among the people as well as among
the diplomatists. The evils of the existing conditions
in Europe will be made apparent to all. The popular
protests against further expenditures for armies and
navies will grow sharper, stronger and more nu
merous.
Out of it all, therefore, an agitation may come
that will have a potent effect upon the politics of
every Government in Europe, and what is now re
garded as a half-crazy scheme may develop, into a
series of movements of genuine utility to the world.
PORTY LOYALTY AROUSED.
rROM the degree of interest displayed at the or
ganization of the Assembly District Republican
clubs on Tuesday evening an ample demonstra
tion was given of the earnestness which pervades the
ranks of the party and animates the activity of its
workers. The sign is an encouraging one at this
early stage of the campaign and gives promise that
the full Republican vote in all the districts will be
polled on election day.
The evidence thus afforded of zeal in the rank and
file as well as among the leaders of the party is the
more gratifying because the absence in this contest
of great national issues like those of the tariff and
sound money threatened to produce something like
a political apathy in the public mind. It was noted
the voters were slow in registering, and that the
total number registered showed a heavy falling off
from that of two years ago.
Under such circumstances the outlook for a dis
play of Republican vigor in the canvass was some
what gloomy. The situation was the more serious
because the experience of the last twenty-five years
has shown that Republicans have been more or less
indifferent in off years, and particularly so in the
Congressional elections following a great Republican
triumph in a Presidential contest.
It is remembered that after the sweeping triumph
of 1888 that elected Harrison and a Congress that
enacted the McKtnley tariff, the Republicans let the
elections of 1890 go by default through over confi
dence, and fears have been felt in some quarters that
a similar mistake might be committed this year.
From the ardor shown at the Assembly District
clubs, however, all such fears will be dissipated so far
as San Francisco is concerned, and it is hardly to be
doubted that in this respect the city fairly represents
the State. Thisis not to be a year of Republican apathy.
The rank and file of the party are aroused. A genuine
enthusiasm prevails and with confidence, but without
being over sanguine, the party will go forward to
victory in November,
THE HAWAIIAN RAIDS.
A LETTER from Honolulu conveys the infor
mation that a military board of inquiry has
been convened by order of General King for
the purpose of investigating certain lawless acts of
the soldiers and formulating more stringent regula
tions for the garrison. The cause of the investigation
is depredations committed by the soldiers. For
some time past many complaints have been coming
to the commanding general concerning the conduct
of his men which it has become impossible to longer
ignore.
Soon after the arrival of the troops a number of
them broke into the barracks of the Hawaiian Na
tional Guard and helped themselves to the relics of
royalty which had been accumulated by the native
soldiers. When the American bluecoats attempted
to ship these treasures home they were detained and an
investigation followed which has brought great dis
credit on the perpetrators of the outrage. On the 4th
inst. a band of soldiers raided the fruit plantations of
Manoa Valley, destroying much property and fright
ening the natives out of their wits. The latter took
refuge at the residence of Minister Cooper, who lives
in the valley, and that gentleman reported the affair
to General Merriam.
As soon as the able editors in this country who
advocate territorial expansion become acquainted
with these facts undoubtedly they will express con
siderable indignation. Indeed, we should not be sur
prised to hear that some of them had called on Presi
dent McKinley to terminate the "outrages." But the
soldiers will have cause to complain if the President
or his officers shall set on foot measures to put a stop
to raids in Manoa Valley or the housebreaking oper
ations of the military relic hunters. The soldiers
know that the United States Government has stolen
the island from the Hawaiians, and it will necessarily
appear to them the merest splitting of hairs for the
larcenist to object to their stealing relics of royalty,
pineapples and bananas.
Senator Hoar has said that the Hawaiians are
children in intellect and dying out so fast that no
heed need be given to their sentiments, but the logic
of the situation is unchanged for all that. Having
stolen the islands as a whole, why should we object
to the soldiers stealing such small things as the royal
relics of the native militia and the pineapples and
bananas of Manoa Valley? Can it be possible that
to the minds of the territorial expansionists grand
larceny is a lesser offense than petty larceny? Before
the Eastern jingoes become indignant at the Ha
waiian "outrages" they should dilate upon the argu
ment the soldiers will probably level at their heads.
MISS ANTHONY'S VIEW OF ThJE CASE.
ZHJ VERY current that flows in the stream of our
national life is water on the wheel of the mill
â * of Miss Susan B. Anthony, and helps to grind
her grist. It would be a strange event indeed in our
development that did not furnish her with a new
argument for the enfranchisement of woman and af
ford a new evidence in her eyes of the inferiority of
man.
The latest demonstration of her ability to turn to
account whatever comes up is to be found in her re
cent declaration that the results of the Santiago cam
paign prove conclusively that the quartermaster, com
missariat and medical departments of our armies
should hereafter be placed under the control of
women exclusively. Miss Anthony claims that the
housekeeper should be the campkeeper, and that the
sex that cares for the food, clothing and nursing of
men at home should be intrusted with the same care
of men in the field.
Had women been in charge of the supplies for the
troops that made the descent upon Cuba there would
have been no deficiencies anywhere according to Miss
Anthony. The hurry of the movement, the necessity
of hasty preparation, would not have flustered or
flurried housewives who have been taught by long ex
perience how to get dinner ready on washdays or pro
vide for guests arriving unexpectedly. They would
have managed to have everything in the camp around
Santiago homelike and comfortable by the time the
boys had landed from the transports, got their faces
washed and were ready to sit down and eat.
Miss Anthony has so large a following in the coun
try that her views never remain very long confined to
herself. We may therefore expect her conclusions
on this subject to be taken up by the woman suffra
gists generally and urged with great vehemence. A
proposition to turn the whole camp management of
our armies over to the ladies and to use men for the
fighting line only is one of the projects we may have
to consider when army reform comes up for discus
sion. The opponents of the new womanhood had
therefore better get ready for the coming debate and
prepare themselves with arguments against female
quartermistresses and commissariats.
THE VIRGINIA SENATORSMIP.
rITZHUGH LEE is a candidate for the United
States Senatorship from Virginia, and, accord
ingly, the . incumbent of that office, Senator
Martin, is somewhat worried. The General has
contented himself with announcing his candidacy.
The management of his campaign he has left to his
friends. These naturally enough have been extolling
his services to the nation in Cuba as an evidence of
his statesmanlike grasp of great subjects, and as an
inevitable consequence the supporters of Senator
Martin have been compelled to take issue with them.
Ttyis it comes about that General Lee's course as
Consul General is undergoing a political investiga
tion, and he is learning that even a hero cannot es
cape criticism when he becomes a candidate for office.
From the reports that come to us the criticisms
thus far made upon the consular career of the General
are hardly likely to lower his repute among the peo
ple of Virginia or to injure his chances in the Legis
lature. It is stated that his opponents declare that
by reason of his course at Havana Lee was largely
responsible for precipitating the war with Spain when
one might have been avoided. The charge is made
that he is too much of a jingo, and that he did not,
while Consul General, and does not now, rightly
represent the sentiments of the people of Virginia.
From this distance it would appear that such
charges are designed rather to help than to injure the
candidacy of the General. Whatever view may have
been taken in Virginia of the Cuban situation just
before the outbreak of the war, that of an overwhelm
ing majority of the people at large was essentially the
same as that of Lee. The country noted his course
at Havana with confidence and with pride, and, al
though he was a Democrat, there was a general satis
faction when the Republican administration retained
him in his office.
If the contest is continued on the lines laid down
ft is a safe prediction that when the next Congress
meets Senator Martin will have an "ex" before his
title and the General will be known as Senator Lee.
With the opening of the Widber trial comes an
other exhibition of the farce of selecting jurymen.
Any citizen who has read of the case is rejected, and
any who says he has not read of it ought to be re
jected for stupidity if for nothing worsÂ»
CHANGED HIS MIND.
How De Young Condemned in
1886 He Is Doing
in 1898.
>;/\>M.H.de Young has evidently experienced a change of policy since
the campaign of '1686,', when le used the columns of the Chronicle to ac
complish the defeat of all Republican nominees for the Legislature who
declined to announce how they stood on the fight for United States
Senator in the event of party success and there being ' a Republican
majority on joint ballot. Mr. de Young, notwithstanding his half-hearted
denial that ;he is an aspirant for Senatorial honors, is â¢ making what he
; styled 1886 "a still hunt" for the office. He was out in open arms
against the late A. A. Sargent at that time, and the- Republican legislative
nominees throughout the State received a letter from him requesting
them to inform him how they intended voting on the United States -Sen
atorial fight. Those who refused to give him the information he de
sired were attacked by the Chronicle and their political . pathway made
anything but one of roses. â : 'i ,-^.H ' ;
The editorials of the Chronicle in 1886 are applicable to-day by sub
; stituting the name of M. H. .de Young for that of A. A. Sargent. Mr.
de Young insisted upon Sargent making an open â  and above-board
fight, if he wa6 in the Senatorial race. 'That is all The Call asks of Mr.
de Young in this campaign. Let him practice the principle he so
strongly advocated in 1886. In order that his stand in that year may. be
properly put before the voters of the State, the following few excerpts
are taken from : the editorial columns of the Chronicle. What then
thought of an indorsement by the Legislature is best expressed by a
few gems culled from the Chronicle September 15, 1886:
â â¢'â â¢â ....â¢ .If the Republicans elect a majority of the Legislature he
(Sargent) will endeavor to secure the aid of the corporations and the
jobbers g-enerally and then should he prove successful he will claim
that he has been indorsed by the people. Of course he cannot hum
bug the people by making such a claim. . . . An indorsement
by the average Legislature seems more like a seal of condemnation
than a compliment. ' . . . Sargent can help us in this matter if he
wishes to. Let him ask the nominees who are favorable to his elec
tion to openly declare themselves. . . . There must be plain
talk in this campaign. Candidates cannot be allowed to shelter
themselves behind the worn-out excuse that they have not made up
their minds. v*
Mr. de Young was also of the opinion that the people had a right to know
who their candidate for Senator was to be, as Is shown by the following ex
tracts from an editorial published in the Chronicle September 16, ISB6: r ' -- '.
- Why not demand of every man who wants to go to the Legislature
what he intends to do when the time comes to vote for Senator P
Surely the people whom the Senator will represent have a right to
know who he is going to be. To refuse to furnish them with the in
formation will raise such presumption of intended corruption that no
wise candidate will run the risk. tenths of the men who will
shortly be up for election will have to show their hands and in this
way the people of California may have a Senator who is their very
own choice. ;. .
Mr. de Young had during that same campaign a wholesome fear of "Dumb
Candidates," for he expressed himself as follows through the Chronicle on
September 20, 18S6:
Things have come to a pretty pass â have they not? â when a' can
.didate for the Legislature presumes to keep his intentions as to the
Senator a secret from his constituents. Have the people of California
any distinct perception of the fact that they are being disfranchised
by the present practice of. the bosses? . . > .The danger, standing
like a lion in the path of the working of the American system, arises
from the anomalous position of the United States Senate. . .
The Senate instead of representing the interests of States, represents
nothing but the interests of corporations, syndicates and monopolists,
which are not confined to any one State, but are spread over all the
States. Senators owe their seats to boodle and for the interests of
boodle, they keep them.
That r it Is: a very bad idea to attempt to deceive the people was the
opinion of Mr. de Young in 18S6. That ;is just :â  what The Call Is advising
him not to attempt by any half-way denial of his soaring ambition. In the
editorial columns of the Chronicle on October 16, 1886, appeared the follow
ing: good advice: ; : V'*|'>':? ?â ''<'â ' : ' c - â¢
Sargent had better throw off the mask and play a bold game. He
has cast his, fortunes with the corporations and there is no usÂ« of his
trying to make believe that he thinks of the good or ill of the party
that he has unfortunately fastened himself upon. He has nothing to
dp with the party or the people. If he is elected he will owe his suc
cess to corporation money and influence and he will be the corpora
tion representative in the Senate and not the people's.
Again in the editorial columns of the Chronicle on October 21, 18S6, ap
pears the following: -'X-'/'A
'â  The election of Sargent to the Senate would mean the defeat of
the Republicans in this State in 1888. Once before he was willing
to sacrifice the party to his corrupt ambition. He is indifferent to
? itsfate now, provided he can go where he can do more good for the
railroad monopoly than "six new men."
In an editorial published in the Chronicle of October 26, 1886, Mr. de
Young freely expressed his opinion of a candidate who would go off on
"a still hunt." : Among other things ha said:
Is this not worth consideration? No paper has tried to make any
thing like a straightforward advocacy of Sargent for the â  United
States Senate. . . . The reason is easy to fathom. The papers
which really favor Sargent know that they would prejudice his inter
ests if they openly proclaimed their devotion to him, because candi
date and. editor wear the same collar. The order has gone out for a
still hunt to be made. . . . The still hunt dodge is a Â£ood one
when no one is watching, but when me hunters in the shape of vot
' ers stand around with independent ballots in hundreds of precincts
ready to lay out the game, there is really no show for it. ' .
. A few days before the election; in fact, on October 30, 1886, Mr de Younir
In an editorial under the headline "An Elective Farce," gave voice to the
sentiments that are appropriate to-day, by substituting the name of the own
er of the Chronicle for that of Sargent: . ~""7j
The action of Republican legislative candidates who refuse to state
whether they ere for or against Sargent for "the Sennte furnishes one
of the best arguments against our present method of electing a Uni
ted States Senator. It shows that the people have really no voice in
the matter. . ; .. Isn't it a farce that all this elaborate ma
chinery should be put in motion to carry into the United States Sen
ate a man whom the* people, if they could cast a direct vote in the
matter, would retire permanently to private lifeP
From the editorial columns of the Chronicle of October 28 1886 ar o titon
â¢ these. pointed and significant , sentences relative to the duty 'of warnine thÂ«
people against aspirants who want to fight in the dark: . "" s lue
-; 'a v \? Ut n Â°i m^!t r hh Â° W mUCh We may i de lore the fatuity
evinced by the people, if they allowed the corporation to drive them
to voting blindly for men who will do its bidding in the Legislature
by electing Sargent, we would still feel that we had done our dutv
in warning ; them to avoid the path they were treading
We shall never be brought to admit that an election has an v 'sig
nificance unless the issue is clean cut and well defined Let
the voters understand the question. ' Put it before them in this naked
shape: "Do you want a Senator to represent you at Washington or a
Senator to , represent the special interests of the Southern Pacific of
. KentuckyP" The hideous deformity of the idea will then be apparent
to every one.

NIGHT SONG.
See! the summer, my love, comes anew
All that was to review.
And her scarf flung so free o'er the hills
Wakes to laughing the rills.
Oh, the odnr is sweet, and the dew,
By the paths that we knew.
Over fields lighted white by the moon, .
Comes the wind with a tune.
Through the trees gleam the stars, and so
rare
Each caress of the air.
Ah, my love, once so true, can it be
All forgotten of thee?
Know, my lady, the prints of your feet
Bless each woodland retreat,
And where'er you have been, it is there
That I roam in despair.
You may smile and forget If you will,
But with me it is ill.
But to meet for a day once again!
Thus alway I complain.
And of you all the night voices croon
When the world seems aswoon,
Lo, my heart beats in pain unreslgned.
Oh. my lady, be kind.

TO JUSTICE
Judge Cook Opens the
Important Case.
EIGHT JURORS SECURED
ACCUSED WILL MAKE A HARD
FIGHT FOR LIBERTY.
Will Probably Acknowledge Civil but
Deny Criminal Liability for the
Shortage in His
Office.
Augrustus C. Widber. tho defaulting: ex-
Treasurer, Is now on trial before Judge
Cook on a charge of having stolen $117,000
from the city treasury. The morning ses
sion of the court was occupied in the
examination of talesman, and out of
twenty, eight Jurors were secured. The
panel was then exhausted and the case
went over until this morning.
During the examination of â witnesses
the defense was forced to show Its hand
to a certain extent. After the usual for
mal Questions each talesman would be
questioned as to whether he had read
any purported statements of the defend
ant relative to hi? guilt or Innocence. If
ne had his services as a juror were not
required. If the talesman safely passed
tnis question then his knowledge of the
law would occupy the attention of Attor
ney Peixotto, who represents the ac
cused.
"Do you know the difference between a
criminal action for embezzlement and a
civil actfon for the recovery of moneys in
trusted?" Pelxotto would usk. As a rule
those Jurors who were accepted were
aware of the difference, and this lays
bare the fact, the prisoner will contend
that while he may be civilly liable he
cannot be held behind prison bars for
his offense.
â  Widber, accompanied by his mother and
sister, appeared in court looking pale and
â¢worn. Across from the little group sat
District Attorney Hosmer, who is assist
ed in the prosecution by C. H. Wilson, at
torney for the Fidelity and Casualty
Company of Maryland, which Is out Just

THERE MAY BE
ANOTHER MAN
HUNTING FOR MRS. BOTKIN'S
SECOND AFFINITY.
George W. Monteith. Comes to the
Front With an Original
Theory.
Attorneys Knight and Wheeler left yes
terday morning for Eureka on the steam
er Pomona, and Senator Frank McGowan
remains in this city to watch the inter
ests of Mrs. Cordelia Botkin during his
'co-workers' absence.
Despite the fact that the attorneys for
the defense have declined, for obvious
reasons, to skj- what witnesses they will
produce should their client come to trial.
It is known that for three weeks past a
thorough search has been made for a
voung man of this city who is known to
n;ivr>. shared with John P. Dunning for
five months before Dunning left for Cuba
the affections of Mrs. Botkin. By his
testimony it is hoped to mitigate to a
great extent the motive for the murder
of Mrs. Dunning that the prosecution has
Bet up, that is, Mrp. Botkin's affection
for the murdered woman's husband.
â¢ The only trace of the sought-for witness
eo far to be had is the fact that on Sep
tember 2 he purchased a railroad ticket
â¢.to Fresno.
Thero are numerous witnesses. It is
claimed, who have met Mrs. Botkin and
h<=r second affinity at the racetrack and
during their meteoric flights through the
tenderioln since November of last year,
but the actual evidence of the man him
self Is desired by counsel and this they
hi â¢}><â ' to have very shortly.
The extradition phase of the case re
mains unchanged, notwithstanding that
George W. Monteith, who has been re
ferred to as "special counsel for the
â  â¢ution," comes to the front with the
opinion that Mrs. Botkin can be taken
Into Delaware's jurisdiction by habeas
corpus, out of the Federal court.
This solution of the difficulty, however,
Is not considered feasible.
OBSERVED FOUNDERS' DAY.
Lick School of Mechanical Arts Vis-
ited by Thousands Yesterday.
The memory of James Lick waa re
vered by the thousands of* visitors who
went through the halls and class rooms
of the California School of Mechanical
Arts at Sixteenth a~.d Utah streets yes
terday. It waa the fourth anniversary of
the founding of the institution.
At 9 o'clock yesterday morning the trus
tees, with George A. Merrill, principal of
the school, made an inspection of the
premises, and afterward the trustees and
a few invited friends were entertained
at luncheon, the repast having been pre
pared by the cooking class of tho school.
Later on the parents of the pupils and
their numerous friends began to arrive,
and kept coming and going until late In
the afternoon.
In fitting harmony with the character
of the founder of the school, instead of
being a holiday of recreation it was one
of activity with the teachers and pupils.
The 260 young San Franciscans, male and
female pupils, were busy at their studies
in the sewing, cooking, drawing, wood-
Working and forging departments. In the
' r department James Spiers, who is a
master mechanic and one of the proprie
tors of the Fulton foundry, spent the en
tire day with the pupils in the machine
ehop, instructing them in the many mys
teries of iron work.

MILLER WILL
COMMAND THE
THIRD DIVISION
Dispatches Announce
His Appointment.
MAY BE A MAJOR GENERA
ENTITLED TO THIS RANK AS
DIVISION COMMANDER.
A Hospital for the Accommodation of
Three Hundred Soldiers May .
Be Erected on Angel
Island.
Dispatches received here from "Wash
ington yesterday announce the fact that
it has been decided by the War Depart
ment to place General Miller in command
of the troops lately ordered to Manila.
When this became known at the Presidio
It caused tha greatest satlsiaction among
both officers and men. Only yesterday
morning General Miller yielded to the
persuasions of the officers under him, and
wrote a formal letter to the adjutant gen
eral of tjie army requesting that he be
placed in command of the troops ordered
to Manila.
It Ib now positively known that for
some days, in fact ever since the order
came for the troops to go, the officers
that were included in the order have been
quietly at work using their influence to
secure the command for the general. Gen
eral Miller was highly pleased when in
formed of the dispatches from Washing
ton, and he declared that he hoped that
they were true, but added that he had not
as yet received any ollieial notification
that he would be sent to Manila In com
mand of the troops.
No one seems to doubt the authenticity
of the dispatches, and if they be true it
means that the general will in a.ll prob
ability be made a major general of volun
teers. This would follow as a natural
Bequence of his being appointed to com
mand a division.
The most important thing done by Gen
enil Miller yesterday was the considera
tion of the building of a hospital to ac
commodate 3<Xj sick soldiers. He had a
long consultation with Surgeon Colonel
Mlddleton with the result that It was
B radically decided to a.Â«k tho War
epartment to order the erection of such
a hospital. Colonel Middleton has with
drawn his objection to Angel Islanfl, and
the hospital will no doubt be erected
there. It is absolutely necessary that the
brick barracks shall be vacated by the
Division Hospital, as they will be needed
to shelter the troops that remain behind
at tho Presidio during the winter. The
batteries of the Third Artillery, two
troops of the Fourth Cavalry, three com
panies of the Kighth Itegiment. the Al
ger Light Battery and tne Nevada Cav
alry have to be cared for, and the brick
barracks will be needed for them, so
there is little doubt that the hospital
will be granted by the department and
erected in the near future. Orders have
now been issued mat Angel Island shall
be garrisoned by twelve men from Bat
tery I, Third Artillery. un<]er the com
mand of two non-commissioned officers
This detachment will relieve the second
battalion of the First \\ ushington Regi
ment now there.
Police Inspector First Lieutenant Nolan
of the Fourth Cavalry has written a let
ter to the adjutant of the post, complain
ing of the condition of the ground just in
the rear of the convalescent tents of the
division hospital. He reports that a
criminal state of affairs exist* there be
cause the nurses of the hospital have
been permitted to create an intolerable
nuisance that endangers the health of
ti ose in the hospital. The matter will be
brought to the attention of General Mil
ler who will have the evil remedied.
I-Vst Sergeant Gail G. Ferguson, Com
pany F, Seventh California. Regiment,
died at the division hospital yesterday
of typhoid fever. He was one of the
best non-commissioned officers in the
regiment. His home was in Los Angeles.
He was convalescing, but imprudently
tried to get out of bed too soon, and suf
fered a relapse.
Private John D. Sampson, Company H.
Twentieth Kansas Regiment, sentenced
by a general court-martial to be fined $10
and confined for thirty days at hard labor
for larceny, had his .sentence disapproved
by the reviewing authority, who held that
inasmuch as there was reasonable doubt
of the soldier's guilt he should be given

the benefit of it. No soldier guilty of
larceny Is permitted to remain in the
service;, and as the court gave a light sen
tence because it was in doubt as to
Sampson's guilt the sentence was disap-
I proved and the soldier was released from
j confinement.
General Miller and his staff, by the ln
! vitation of General Dickinson, will be
present at the benefit to be given at *he
Mechanics' Pavilion on Saturday night
1 for the family of Captain Riehter of the
First California Regiment.
General Flagler, chief of ordnance, has
, refused General Miller's request that the
| troops here be supplied with the Krag-
Jorgensen rifles. The War Department
I has in a recent order ruled against the
j equipping the troops now using the
| Springfield with the more modern gun.
Private Moore, Company I, Tennessee
Regiment, with some other soldiers, went
into the restaurant of Mrs. Emma Hard,
274i< Greenwich street, on Tuesday night
and ordered something to eat. They then
attempted to leave without paying, and
' Mrs. Hard tried,, to prevent their doing
! so, and In brushing past Mrs. Hard the
j soldiers severely strained her arm. The.
i Tennessee soldier was the only one whom
i she was able to recognize. The case has
j been reported to General Miller and he
: has ordered that a commissioned officer
i shall hereafter be on guard with the pa
j trol. Moore will be punished for his of
fense.
At present there is no definite date set
for the sailing of any of the troops, be
cause none of the transports have
arrived. The quartermaster's department
; is busy at work upon estimates for sup-
I plies of all kinds for the forces, so when
the vessels once get here there will be no
delay in getting them away again. The
men will be furnished with suitable ap
parel for the warm climate to which they
are going.
Owing to the number of application*
that have been made to the department in
Washington by individual soldiers for
discharges the acting adjutant general,
| Major Friend, has isued an order stating
' that only applications forwarded through
the proper military channels will be con
sidered hereafter.
TIRED OF HER
MARRIAGE BONDS
MRS. CAROLINE SIME SUING
FOR A DIVORCE.
She Alleges Extreme Cruelty, Failure
to Provide, Habitual Intem
perance, Neglecc and
Desertion.
Caroline H. Slme declares she is weary
of the brutality of her husband, weary
of his profligate habits, his dissipation
and his neglect, and she has carried her
troubles to the courts, and has asked that
a decree of divorce be gTanted her on
the grounds of extreme cruelty, failure
to provide, habitual intemperance, neg
lect and desertion.
Mrs. Sime, who, as well as her hus
band, is well known in this city and in
Oakland, states that she was married in
May of ISB4, and that almost immediately
her husband commenced his brutal treat
ment. By reason of this treatment she
states that her health has been shattered,
and at one time her life was despaired
of.
As specific instances of cruelty Mrs.
Slme refers to an assault made upon her
by her husband in February of 1593. He
entered their home in Oakland and with
out provocation struck her on the head
with his clenched fist. On other occa
sions, she says, he would come home
maudlin drunk and fall on the floor. She
would be forced to "drag him to bed to
her great shame." On January 9 of the
present year, when she was residing at
111 Tenth street in this city, she alleges
that he called upon her and told her that
If she were not a woman he would kill
her, at the same time violently abusing
her. In March of the present year he
publicly charged heÂ¥ with infidelity,
which, she says, he knew was false. It
estranged many of her friends, she de
clares, and added to her many woes.
Mrs. Sime states that she holds an in
terest in property on Pine street, between
Kearny and Dupont and on Jackson near
Drumm street, in this city, and through
a gift deed from her hUÃband is entitled
to a one-quarter Interest in the 'Poland
ranch in Solano County. Some time ago
she placed the property in the hands of
Mary L. Sime, her husband's mother, to
be held in trust. Yesterday her attor
neys procured a restraining order from
Judge Belcher enjoining the present hold
er or her husband from disposing of or

DRUGGED AND
ROBBED OF HIS
VALUABLES
Bold Crime of a Bad
Woman.
A SOLDIER HER VICTIM
WAS RELIEVED OF HIS MOJtfEY
AND A WATCH.
Annie Murphy, Alias "Lady Wash
ington," Accused of Adminis
tering Ether to James Mc-
Crary of Battery I.
James B. MeOrary, a private In Bat
tery I, Third Artillery, last night caused
the arrest of Annie Murphy, alias "Lady
Washington," on a charge of robbery.
On the night of August 13 McCrary,
while taking in the tenderloin, met the
fair Annie. She claimed she was a re
cent arrival from the East, and she had
"money to burn," as she expressed it.
After having several drinks McCrary
foolishly accompanied her to a room at
SSVfe Stockton street. While he was asleep
on the lounge the woman saturated a
handkerchief with ether and applied it
to his nostrils.
The overpowering fumes of the drug
aroused him to a realization of the dan
ger, and he vainly attempted to get pos
session of tho handkerchief. The woman
held him until the drug had rendered him
unconscious, and she then went through
his pockets, taking all the money he had,
amounting to $42, and a silver watch.
McCrary lay in a semi-conscioua condi
tion until the following day, when his
heavy breathing attracted the attention
of the landlady, who, becoming alarmed,
summoned Police Officer Fennell. The
latter succeeded in resuscitating the sol
dier, and after learning the story started
to find the woman. Failing to locate her
he gave a description of her to Police
man Colen, whose beat is in the tender
loin district. Colen searched the various
dives on Grant avenue, but was unable
to find the woman. After a diligent
search he finally located her yesterday
afternoon in a lodging-house on Grant
avenue. She was at once taken to the
City Prison, where her name was regis
tered on the small book. Last evening
McCrary positively identified her as the
woman who had drugged and robbed
him. When questioned by the police the
fair prisoner admitted that she had met
McCrary, but denied that she ha/3 reliev
ed him of his money.
"He is a liar if he says I touched
him," she indignantly remarked. "You
guys think you can pump me, but you're
on the dead card this time. I'm dead
next, and know a thing or two. I'm no
spring chicken and you can't shake mÂ©
down, see?"
Tho arresting officer is inclined to the
belief that the woman is an Eastern ope
rator, and he intends to make every ef
fort to find out her past history.
L. H. JOSSELYN'S TBOUBLES.
He May Be Prosecuted by the Postal
Authorities on an Old Charge.
Lockwood H. Jonselyn, the soldier who
was arrested Monday night for discharg
ing firearms within the city limits and
was accused by his wife of trying to
chloroform and shoot her, appeared be
fore Judge Mogan yesterday and the case
was? again continued until to-day.
The postal authorities have given no
Intimation of what they Intend doing with
Josselyn in connection with the old
charge against him of opening letters
addressed to Mrs. Howe, a "specialist."
The police have been unable to find hie
wife, and it Is thought that she is pur
posely keeping out of the way so that
the case against him in the Police Court
will have to be dismissed. She is suing
him for a divorce.

THE WINE MEN
MUST PAY THE
WAR IMPOST
A Tax on Methods and
Not on Wine.
QUEER CLAUSE IN THE BILL
BULK DEALERS ESCAPE THE
BUBDEN.
The Secretary of the Treasury Tells
the Bottlers of Vinoua Fluids
Wtxj They Are Made an
Exception.
The wine men of this State who have
been opposing the war tax on bottled
wines on the ground that it was not only
discriminating but unconstitutional have
received a body blow that not only dazea
but amuses them.
The claim Is made by the battlers that
In placing a tax on wine in glass 95 per
cent of the vinous product escapes the
impost, and that tho burden falls on the
few who sell goods in case.
A short time ago the Wetmore-Bowen
Company notified the Government that
they would not pay the tax, justifying
thoir position on the theory above men
tioned.
The firm has received a reply from the
Secretary of the Treasury In which he
makes the confusing statement that the
tax is not placed "upon the wine as a
wine, but upon the method." The con
fusion arises from the fact that the meth
ods of treating and bottling- wines are as
numerous as the .. bottlers thereof. In
other words the wine is not taxed, but
the method of getting it upon the market
Is. Taking this ' theory the bottlers say
that it would be as reasonable to tax
the method of placing bulk wines before
the public. They also say several other
things about the misguided individual
who drew up the â¢ wine section pf the
revenue law and made it . "left-handed."
However, they must pay the tax, as
shown by the following letter from the
Treasury Department to the Wetmore-
Bowen Company:
Sir: Your letter of the 27th lnst., addressed to
the honorable Secretary of the Treasury, pro
testing against payment of the tax on wines
when bottled for sale, on the ground that said
tax Is "discriminative, unjust and unconstitu
tional," has been referred to this office. You
surest that wine should be taxed at the
winery where it is made while Btlll in the
wood, so that an "equitable tax upon every
producer" will be assured, while under th<*
present system many large growers and mer
chants, who soil millions of gallons In wood
annually, escape taxation to the detriment of
those who puu up and sell their product . in
gIaMS. ( â¢" â  â  - .
The act of June 13, . 189S, popularly known aa
the "war revenue law," imposes a stamp tax
on "sparkling or other wines when bottled for
sale.". The function of the executive branch
of the Government Is to carry out or execute
the laws as enacted by Conjrreys and it has no
power to Inquire into the expediency or consti
tutionality of laws so enacted. The Intent and
purpose of the law above referred to wae not
apparently to levy a tax on wine as wine, but
on the usual and customary method of putting
It up po as to be available for sale to the class
of consumers upon whom presumably the extra
burden would ultimately fall with the least
Inconvenience. Respectfully yours. â¢'â 
G. W. WILSON,
Acting Commissioner.
-It Is understood that the protesting
wine house, .. while complying with the
law, will make a test case of its con
stitutionality, and In case of success will
make a . demand for a restitution of the
money paid to the Government.'

THEBE'S MUCH IN A NAME.
So Holds H. E. Beng-uiat and He
Sues His Competitors for
Damages.
H. E. Benguiat, a dealer In Oriental
rugs and antiquities, believes that he has
discovered a conspiracy to ruin his busi
ness, and he has sued Mihram Courian,
Charles Courian and the Turkish Rug
Company to recover $15,000, which sum
he believes will compensate him for the
damage he has sustained.
The plaintiff alleges that by reason of
his great skill, judgment and experience
in the art of collecting rugs and antiqui
ties he has established a large and valu
able business. This the defendants knew,
he avers, and, in order to profit thereby,
conspired to place upon the market a
quantity of cheap and common rugs, al
leged to have once been the property of
one H. E. Benguian, a name strikingly
similar to that of the plaintiff. The rugs,
it was said, passed from Benguiat's
hands through the foreclosure of a chat
tel mortgage executed In favor of A.
Alexander.
There was never In being such a per
son as H. E. Benguian, says the plaintiff,
and the name was placed upon the pur
ported chattel mortgage for the purpose
of leading plaintiff's many customers to
believe that his tfoods were to be dis
posed of at auction. Yesterday was the
date set for the sale of the goods and
Konguiat was of the opinion that if the
court refused to issue an injunction, not
only would he suffer irreparable dam
age, but the public would be victimized
an well. In consequence his attorneys
went before Judge Belcher and presented
the facts of the cape and temporary in
junction was Issued. Complainant's at
torneys then went to Golden Gate Hall,
where preparations for the sale were be
inÂ«r made, and served the injunction no
tice. In consequence the sale did not
come off and in all probability will not
until after the court has passed, upon the
merits of plaintiff's rontention.
SHY OF ANNEXATION.
Cuba and Luzon May Not Be Desir-
able Acquisitions.
Something seems to have worked a
change of sentiment in the minds of the
directors of the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association in the matter of an
nexing the new territory which has been
placed within the power of this country
through the war with Spain. Until re
cently they joined in the popular cry to
"hold everything." To-morrow a meet
ing of the directors will be held to give
the subject a little more thought. In or
der to get the matter properly before the
board J. P. Kerr has prepared a reso
lution setting forth the wishes of the peo
ple as heretofore expressed and conclud
ing in this way:
TVhrreas. The introduction of cheap labor
from these territories or the free Importation
of manufactured RoodÃ (the product of Ameri
can factories established In said territories
whore cheap labor is available) ir.lj?ht seriously
affect the welfare of our people and cripple or
destroy the growing industries of our country;
therefore, be it
Repolvd, That In the opinion of the Board
of Directors of the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association the connection of the
United States with these territories should be
In the form of a protectorate, or in such form
as would leave our people free to protect them
selves and their Industries from the evils re
ferred to.
To Limit Liability.
Warren D. Clark, Oscar T. Sewall and
Edwin Goodall, part owners of the ship
"Willie Rosenfeld, filed an intervention
yesterday In the United States District
Court to limit their liability for damages
in the old case of Emll Grundstrum
against the owners of the Rosenfeld.
Judge de Haven appointed H. Watson,
C. V. S. Gibbs and George E. Plummer
as appraisers to appraise the value of
the vessel on the voyage lust before she
waa wrecked. An Injunction was Issued
on the suit until the final disposition of
the case by the court.
Threatens to Kill His Mother.
Mrs. Llda Burns, 215 Cortland avenue,
Bwore to a complaint In Judge Joachim
sen's court yesterday for the arrest of
Dennis Hagerty, her brother, on a
charge of threatening to kill his mother.
Dennis is said to be a dissolute son, and
has for a long time annoyed his mother
and Eister. Monday night he went to the
house just as they were retiring for the
night. He could not obtain an entrance,
and going to the woodshed procured an
ax and tried to break in the front door.
The two frightened women ran out of
the house in their wrappers and screamed
for help. Dennis ran away, but before,
doing so yelled to his mother that he
would kill her.

DISGUSTED WITH LIFE.
A Blind Mendicant Fires a Bullet
Into His Head.
Patrick Brady, a blind mendicant, last
night shot himself in the right temple
with suicidal intent. He was found ly
ing on the floor of his room apparently
fatally wounded, and removed to the Re
ceiving Hospital. Drs. Wymore and
Graves probed for the bullet, but were
unable to locate It. Despite the serious
nature of the wound the hospital sur
geons believe he will recover.
Brady states that he lost his eyesight

in Sisklyou County about eight years ago.
He has frequently been arrested for in
sulting women who refused to assist him.

unknown to him. to haul a load of Iron,
pipe to the Joshua Hendy Machine
Works. The defendant loaded the pipe
on his truck in a careless manner and
while the plaintiff was superintending the

THE MONEY MARKET.
INDICATIONS POINT TO ' A PERIOD OF
EASY FUNDS.
The circular of Henry . Clewes, under date of
New York. September 17, says: The past week
hae developed a more buoyant feeling in Wall
street clrcle6. The money situation, which had
encouraged the recent selling of stocks, is be
oomlng better understood, and the expectation
of stringency has virtually disappeared. This
obstacle being removed, there was nothing to
prevent a general reaction toward better con
ditions. The "bears" had succeeded In break-
Ing prices to a level of comparative cheapness;
the market was freely oversold, and there were
substantial operators ready to take in Import
ant lines of stocks when they were satisfied
that the bottom of values had been touched.
The general drift of events during the week
has tended to warn the "bears" to cover and
the "bulls" to buy. Sterling exchange has
fallen to the gold-importing point, and some
considerable engagements have already been
made for shipping the metal to this port. There
has also been some easing In the rates for
money, consequent upon offerings from out-of
town sources, and It has â¢ been accepted as a
good symptom that the new bonds are being
taken up more rapidly. On Thursday the
treasury placed ' $6,000,000 of cash on deposit
with city banks, against security of bond allot
ments. Also, the monthly official statement of
foreign trade showed that our excess of ex
ports over Imports continues with but little
abatement from the extraordinary proportions
of several months past. This succession of en
couraging events has changed the tone of husl
ness at the Stock Exchange and encouraged
buying, and at the moment the indications
point to a prolonged continuation .of activity.
Another point favoring an early return to
comparative ease in money, Is the resumption
of imports of gold. The , engagements of that
nature already amount to about $.>.000,000;. >. 000,000; and
as. the August exports of merchandise exceeded
the Imports by $36,000,000 it Is plain that the
trade balance Is likely to keep foreign exchange
clOFe upon the gold-Importing point for some
time to come. Lnder these conditions there Is
nothing in the present condition of the bank
reserves to make even nervous borrowers un
easy. We are plainly on the way toward * a
long period of comfortable ease In money.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Sept. 21.â course of Eugar i
to-day Indicated that the long- bear turn In that
6tock hag come to an end for the present. Deal- |
ings in this stock continued to absorb an Im
portant proportion oÂ£ the ' total transactions.
Efforts to hold the money rate proved unavail
ing in view of the disparity ; between the New
York call money rate and other markets, and
call loans on the board fell to 2 per cent to-day.
As a result of relief- from these Important re
actionary tendencies, . the market was strong
and recovered quite generally from yesterday's i
decltne. JJut the strength was confined largely
to specialties and the market "Is still in the
hands of the professionals and . reflects no out
side Interest. There was still some apprehen
sion that the rally in sugar might simply be I
the cause of manipulation : directed against . a
large bear account. . The sudden plenitude of
money was also looked at somewhat i askance,
and with some remains the fear that a further
flurry in call money might be possible. . The
fact that money has been â  easy to - obtain ! for
several days In almost all â¢ markets, but not
on the Stock Exchange, - encouraged this feel-
Ing. But thÂ« call money market was unable to
withstand the Influence of the various agencies
â which have been at work J for its relief. The
sub-treasury had . another -:-. debit balance of
nearly $2,000,000 at the clearing house to-day, j
reflecting In part the presentation of cheeks for j
thÂ» anticipatory payment of the : October . 1
Interest on Government bonds. -Transfers of
currency from New York to the West through
the sub-treasury fell to $80,000 to-day, and New
York exchange in Chicago advanced ,to only 10
cents â  discount. There were ' further . engage
ments of gold in London for import, resulting
In a sharp rise of Vs per cent to 1 per cent In
the money rate and of H@V4 per cent to 2Vi<Â§'2>4
per cent in the discount â¢ rate ; In that market.
The stiffening of the London money market
begot dullness In the stock market, the heavi
ness extending to the American group and re
sulting In some selling . for â  London account
here. Except In one or two Instances 'the sell
ing- was without much effect. ' A number of
stocks responded sharply to special causes, as,
for instance, : Manhattan on the -return from
Europe of the dominant capitalist, Brooklyn
Transit on talk of â¢ the absorption of â  another
line. General Electric on the belief that It
â¢would benefit from "the recent combination of
electrical Interests, Leather preferred on cover-
Ing . of shorts who misapprehend - the meaning
of the new leather company announced.
The coalers. Cotton Oil, Rubber,- New York
Airbrake and some other specialties showed
conspicuous advances. In the railroad list out-
Blde of Northern -' Pacific.', dealings were not
large, but prices In a number of cases advanced
a point net. Last prices were the best and the
market â  was stronc and most active at the

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Sept. 21â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says:
The stock market here was llfelÂ»ss and heavy
j to-day, the gold movement having demoralized
j the markets here. The close was a trifle better
i owing to the improvement In Americans, which
were stimulated by buying from New York.
Americans were flat during the early hours
on realizations by a few English bulls, hut
New York buying this afternoon revealed the
fact that there Is very little stock about, and
prices closed at the best. Pacific stocks were
chiefly favored. Argentines were flat.
The question of a rise In the Bank of Eng
land discount rate to-morrow Is mud* dis
cussed, with opinions about evenly divided. I
am inclined to think that an increase in the
price of gold is more probable than a rise in
the discount rate. Apparently the bank's policy
Is first to make the present rate effective by
borrowing from the market. The bank to-day
borrowed into October and November.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Sept. 21â Wheat was strong at
the opening. December, which closed yester
day at 63%c, started to-day at C3%i??634c and
advanced in a very few minutes to C3%(g63%c.
A slight reaction then took place, the price !
dropping to 63>4@63%c, but the market almost
Immediately turned strong again and before
selling became heavy enough to affect prices,
December had advanced to 63%c. September,
though Inactive, was also very strong, opening
He higher at 67c, and advanced to C7V4c. The
main feature of the strength was the heavy
buying of a prominent St. Louis speculator,
his purchases during the first hour's trading
being estimated at 1, 600,000 bushels. The char
acter of the news was rather encouraging to
buyers. Minneapolis and Duluth receipts were
912 cars, against 9JS last weÂ»k and 853 a year
ago. Chicago receipts were 212 cars.
Liverpool cables showed strength In that
market and a strong continental' demand for
wheat was reported with prices higher. Duluth
reported cash wheat In good demand and Vfec
higher. After the first hour's trading the mar
ket began to weaken. Offerings became much
heavier and general, nenrly all the local hold
ers who have been buying for several days
putting wheat on the market. Later, Liver
pool cables showed some of the advance they
lost. Atlantic port clearings were moderate,
285,000 bushel*. Compared with yesterdays
heavy clearings, this amount waa not encour
aging. A gradual decline took place, December
getting down to 63%c. Here a buying flurry
developed, sending the price back to 63%c, but
bidders at that price were deluged with offer-
Ings and the price quickly broke to G3Hc. For
some time the market fluctuated rapidly within
a narrow range, under active scalping, but
did not develop any real strength again until
near the close, when the announcement that 70
loads of cash wheat had been worked for ex
port rallied the December price suddenly to
634c. It dropped again to 63^c and closed
rather nervous at that figure.
December cloned He and September %c lower.
Cprn was dull and heavy. The market show
ed strength around the opening, but this was
largely because of sympathy with wheat. Corn
lost only a small fraction.
Receipts were 429 cars. Clearances were
small and cash demand slack. Market became
easier late In the day and closed rather weak.
December ranged from 29% c to 2S%c and closed
a shade lower at 29%@29%c.
Oats were strong, notably so for September,
and th# volume of trade was considerably in
creased. There was large buying by one or two
leading commission houses and offerings were
light. Cash demand was good. Receipts
were 272 cars. The market felt the late wheat
break and best prl- were not maintained.
May ranged from 22%c to 22Hc and closed He
higher at 22H@22Jtc. September closed %c
higher at 21Hc. Provisions were dull, and
with the exception of a slight show of strength
early in the session rather weak. Cash <!â¢-

MURDERERS
TRY TO SAVE
THEIR NECKS
Cheeseman Poses as
a Lunatic.
THE COURT IS IN DOUBT
DEUPREY COOLLY ASKS THAT
MEADORS BE FREED.
(The Durrant Case Attorney Enters a
Host of Objections to the
Evidence Pre
sented.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. Sept. 21.
Frank H. Cheeseman is thought to be
trying: to cheat the hangman by insan
ity, real or feigned. Cheeseman was be
fore Judge Ellsworth this morning to bo
arraigned for the killing: of 11. J. Brooke
a few weeks agro, on which occasion he
also attempted to kill Mrs. Brooke and
her daughter.
When Cheeseman came into court ho
looked and acted IlkÂ© a lunatic. Thero
was not an expression of intelligence in
either his eyes or any other of his feat
ures. Whether this be natural or not ex
perts will probably have to determine.
When his name was called only the
slightest movement of his lips indicated
that he took the least interest in tha
proceedings. When ordered to stand be
fore the court the murderer wandered
aimlessly around, and finally, with the as-
BiÃtance of the bailiff, stood facing Judgo
Ellworih. At his preliminary examina
tion he was defended by Colonel Garrlty.
But he has no funds with which to en
gage counsel for his trial, and the Judge
asked him if he would like an attorney
appointed by the court. Cheeseman
either did not or would not understand
what the Judge meant, and bo his case
went over until Friday.
Opinion is divided as to whether Cheese
man is a lunatic or a knave. If he is
deceiving, he is very clever. He was once
In an Insane asylum, but this fact may
pot help his defense. On that occasion
he killed a man and pleaded Insanity so
effectually that he was sent to an asy
lum.
Etta Payne, the girl whom he tried to
kill, and who was Indirectly the cause of
the tragedy of August 8, will testify that
Cheeseman told her that his going to the
asylum was merely a ruse to save being
convicted. He confided to the girl that
he feigned insanity on that occasion with
perfect success. It will, of course, bo
argued by the prosecution that he is do
ing the same thing again.
Cheeseman has the record of a lunatic,
even if ha be not one. On five differ
ent occasions he has attempted to com
mit suicide. Once he jumped from a win
dow, landing on a dog. which was killeol
by the fall; another time he shot him-
Belf; again he stabbed himself with a
knife, and yet again he Jumped into the
bay. He also made an attempt to end
life by Jumping from a high building, but
his scheme was upset by some telegraph
wires in which he caught.

DEUPREY'S OBJECTIONS.
Opens Meadors' Defense by Asking
That the Case Be Dismissed.
OAKLAND, Sept. 21.â Attorney Eugene
Deuprey commenced a technical fight this
morning for the life of JameÃ Meadors,
the Boldier who stabbed Jonas Ury to
death at Camp Barrett.
Meadors" counsel objected to the prog
ress of the trial on the ground that the
requirements of the statute had not been
conformed to. He objected to the infor
mation, as it was not in writing; objected
to the depositions of the witnesses, which
were not signed and not even presented to
be signed; objected because the questions
and answers of the witnesses had not
been approved and signed by him, which
Is in contravention of Federal and State
statute*. Another objection was on the
ground that in cases of homicide an in
dictment by Grand Jury is necessary.
And Mr. Deuprey further said that to
have the evidence of the preliminary ex
amination properly introduced it Is neces
sary to have the shorthand transcript
written in longhand, signed by the mag
istrate and witnesses. Mr. Deuprey also
objected because the transcript had not
been filed within the ten days required by
law, and after a few more objections Mr.
Deuprey calmly asked that the case be
dismissed.
A little argument followed between
Prosecuting Attorney Melvin and Mr.
Deuprey, and Mr. Deuprey agreed to ac
cept the evidence already given as cor
rect, subject to a change if it be shown
that it was incorrect in any part. He
then argued that since the transcript had
not been filed with the County Clerk it
was too late to do it now.
The court held that while the law might
have been violated by not complying with
the ten days' limit, it was merely an un
performed duty on the part of the Prose
cuting Attorney, and that it was still his
duty to file the notes, and that this ac
tion had not Invalidated them in any way.
Mr. Deuprey'B many objections will be
taken up next Wednesday. The court de
nied his motion for a dismissal of the
case. _____ ___^
FROM VANCOUVER BARRACKS.
Boys of the Eighth Regiment Given
a Cold Welcome at Portland and
Called Names at Vancouver.
ALAMEDA, Sept. 21.â Letters have been
received from members of the battaJion of
the Eighth Regiment that went to Van
couver barracks last week. They say that
the men were given warm welcome all
along the line. Coffee and lunch were
served them at different places, and at
Montague, Sisklyou County, long tables
were spread, and the men ate their fill.
At other places fruit, coffee, etc, were
supplied. But when they arrived at Port
lend on the afternoon of last Friday there
was no one to welcome them and no at
tention whatever was paid to them, al
though th<-lr coming was well known.
This was In marked contrast to the
hearty reception given by the ladies of
the Re'] Cross to the Oregon men wno
came to California. The members of the
Elpnth Hepiinent were naturally sur
prlfipd at their fold treatment.
The battalion went to Vancouver on a
boat from Portland, and on landing were
fTfetftd by a crowd who yelled, "Tinhorn
Californlans! â  at them. From all of
which the California boys gather that tfce
people of that part of the country are
somewhat lacking in hospitality for tno
men in blue.
FOOTPADS FOILED.
A Clergyman Attacked, but Puts His
Two Assailants to Flight.
AL.AMEDA, Sept. 21.-The news of an
attempted case of highway robbery in
this city, in which a clergyman was the
Intended victim, has Jim come to light
Rev. Dr. Ritchie of Oakland came over
here to visit some frienda one evening re
cently, and while passing along a lonely
etreet, lined with trees, a man suddenly
lumped from behind one of them and told
him to put up his hands.
The reverend gentleman was something
of an athlete at college, and Instead of
complying with his assailant's orders he
let his fist drive into the man's face at
the same time Jumping back out of rea.cn
As he Jumped he lighted with both feet
upon the form of a man who had been
crouching in the gutter behind Âim, ap
parently Just on the point of springing
on his back. This disconcerted the foot
pad and his companion to such an extent
that they took to flight, and ware evi
dently glad to escape.
CHOKED HIS CHILD BRIDE.
A Scbool Girl Will Apply to lie Goiirts flir
Divorce, Having Been Desertefl.
OAKLAND, Sept. 21.â Fifteen years of
age, one year a wife, deserted and seek
ing a divorce. Such is the record of An
nie Silva Marclel, a little girl from Hay
wards, whose appearance Is that of a
sixth grade pupil.
Last November, when Joseph Marclel
called at Joe Silva's cottage, the mother
laughed at his absurd proposals of mar
riage to the child, telling him there waa
a good looking boy, a schoolmate of An
nie's, who should have her as his bride
when they were old enough. But Mar
clel was determined, and the burly shep
herd and the little girl, on November 28,
went to Sacramento and became man and
wife. As the honeymoon waned clouds
gathered and their marital life becama
a storm.
"After we were married a few days,"
said Mrs. Marclel to-day, "Joe tried to
kill himself with a big knife, and fright
ened me awfully. Then he choked me
with his big hands and said he would
rather see me dead than living. I do not
know why. I was afraid to live with
him. Then I heard he was going far
away, and I asked him to first give me
a divorce; but he said If I had JSO I
could get a divorce; if not he could not
help me, and oh, he was always so rough
to me," said the child with a shrug ot
SHATTUCK'S WILL
FILED FOR PROBATE
BEQUEATHED ALL HIS PROP-
ERTY TO HIS WIDOW.
Nephews and Nieces Residing in
Oakland, However, All Well
Provided For by the Tes
tator.
OAKLAND, Sept. 21.â The holographic
will of the late F. K. Shattuck, who died
In Berkeley on the 9th inst., was filed for
probate to-day, and the widow, Mrs. Rosa
M. Shattuck, has petitioned for letters
testamentary.
The estate is valued at $115,000, as fol
lows Southwest corner of Broadway and
Eighth street, $50,000: undivided half of a
lot at the corner of Broadway and First,
$2500, and at northeast corner, $2500; about
thirty acres, unimproved lots and blocks
in Berkeley, $40,000; Berkeley dwellllng
and lot $2500; pasture land In Contra
Costa County, $3000. The personal prop
erty consists of Oakland and Berkeley
banks stock, $15,000, and other corpora-
The will is dated November 22,1897, and
all property is bequeathed to the widow
during her lifetime, and at her death one
half of whatever may be left is be
queathed to a nephew, John W. Havens,
after the following bequests have been
paid: To a sister, Elizabeth Havens,
$5000; to the nieces Ethel Havens, Mrs.
Mary Robinson, and nephew, Roscoe H.
Havens, $2000 each, and to Blanche Morse,
another niece, $3000.
The widow is nominated as executrix
without bonds and she is given power to
sell or dispose of the realty.
The instrument consists of two pages of
legal cap and there are no subscribing
witnesses. When testator died he was 73
years of age. The widow is a few years
younger.
OPPOSES THE LAKK
Tax Levy High Enough, but Badly
Distributed.
OAKLAND, Sept. 21.â Trustee Hardy of
the Free Library Board has issued a
statement in which he says:
The rate for library purposes should not be
less than 4 cents on each |100 assessed valua
tionâthis was the rate last year.
This matter ought to be considered In another
respect. If the library Is an adjunct to the
school department, no less are the reading
rooms which meet a demand on the part of the
laborer who cannot afford the time nor ex
pense necessary In visiting the library. About
1500 persons dally visit the reading roomsâ
they are the educational opportunity of the la
boring man and his family â places where they
can. without expense, obtain from magazines,
dally newspapers and illustrated and scientific
weeklies all the current news, and gather the
ben thoughts of men In every domain of in
tellectual research; where public opinion can
be formed that will conduce to good citizenship
and a better development of American lnstl-
tutlons.
Fhall we retrograde as an educational center?
No proposed Improvement of Lake Merritt can
justify the closing:, though partial, of our high
school, library or reading rooms or the lessen
ing of their present efficiency.
If the proposed levy is adopted will not the
people awake to the injustice done them, and
emphasize their disapproval at the ballot box?
Ought not the lake side sewers to be paid
for equally by the city and a sewer district?
The only portion of the lake that Is too shal
low or In an unsanitary condition Is the upper
portion running up the eaÃt and west sides of
Adams Point. Should not a part of these
arms of the lake be filled with mud taken from
the adjacent portions of the lake? By so do
ing would not land be made for a boulevard
and park purposes?
About one-half of the proposed appropria
tion for the dredging of the lake would bt>
sufficient for this purpose. Next year the
lower portion of the lake, which Is In good
sanitary condition and sufficiently deep for
present use, could be dredged Into the estuary
between the Twelfth street dam and the Eighth
street bridge, thereby making additional land
for park purposes.
The suggestions and statements mads by
Mr. Snow and Mr. Miller, ideal officials in their
respective departments, should commend them
selves by their Impartial justice and logic to
the favorable consideration of the Council and
the public spirited citizens.
The Oakland Exposition.
OAKLAND, Sept. 21.â At the meeting of
the Merchants' Exchange last night
Director Gier stated that every commer
cial body in the State would co-operate
in the coming exposition on November 12.
as such assurances had been received.
The exposition committee meets every
Tuesday at 4:30 p. m. in the Board of
Trade rooms, and the general committee
will meet on Saturday morning at 9
o'clock in the same place.
Sunol Hotel Burned.
OAKLAND, Sept. 21. âThe Sunol Hotel
was burned to the ground last night, and
but for the prompt and effective work of
some thirty section hands the little town
might have been wiped out. The flre
started in the rear of the hotel and Is
believed to have been the work of an
Incendiary. The loss Is $5000.

will talk it over Sunday, and then I will

Marclel, who is known about town as
"Joe Mast," Is about 33 years of age.
Since he left he has written to a friend
informing him of his trip to the Azores,
and stating that if his wife wants him
she will find him there.
DIED AFTER EATING
AN IVY LEAF
MYSTERIOUS END OF A TWO
YEAR-OLD CHILD.
A Druggist Refused to Treat Him
and He Died Before a Doctor
Could Be Found.
The 2-year-old son of Louis Geischen of
1342 Sacramento street died yesterday af
ternoon under most peculiar circum
stances.
The child was playing In his Tamer's
yard, when he found an ivy leaf, which he
ate. "Within a few minutes he was taken
sick and grew worse so rapidly that his
mother hurried him to Strong's drug
store on the corner of Leavenworth and
Clay streets.
The druggist found the child in Buch a
condition that he was afraid to treat him.
and the despairing mother with the dying
child in her arms hurried down the street
in search of a doctor.
She was unable to find a doctor and
started for the drug store on the corner
of Leavenworth and Pacific streets, but

TO TRY ANOTHER METER.
Board of Public Works Has Grown
Weary of the Waste of Water.
OAKLAND, Sept. 21.â The Board of
Public Works met this morning and again
discussed the question of the great
amount of water registered by the City
Hall meter, but which flows uninterrupt
edly through some subterranean course
under the City Hall.
Mayor Thomas and a committee have
been conducting a thorough investigation.
Last Sunday all the faucets in the build
ing were turned off and still the meter
registered aj a lively rate. In a few hours
850 gallons passed through. The bills have
reached to over $100 per month of late.
Mayor Thomas facetiously recommend
ed that the City Hall be connected with
the Fifteenth street meter, which is ap
parently slow, as it supplies all the
parks, the kitchen and baths in the Jail,
and does not register over $10 worth a
month. The suggestion was adopted, and
Mr. Dow agreed to defray the plumbing
expense provided the bill does not reach
as high as the water bills have lately.
The rapid meter will In the meantime
be given a rest.
Damages for Lost Toes.
OAKLAND, Sept. 21.â The damage suit
of J. E. Holt against the Southern Pacific
Company for the recovery of $11,000 dam

Fencing in the Lake.
OAKLAND, Sept. 21.â Councilman Gi
rard is of the opinion that some one
is trying to Bteal a portion of Lake Mer
ritt. He introduced a resolution before
the Council last night authorizing the
city engineer to make a survey of cer
tain property north of the lake. When
asked for an explanation he said: "I have
introduced a resolution because at the
northern end of Lake Merritt there are
some people fencing in property that was
once claimed as a part of the lake. It is
now claimed by those doing the fencing.
I want to find out who owns the prop
erty." His resolution was unanimously
passed.

FRESHMEN ARE
EXPELLED FROM
THEIR COLLEGE
Aftermath of a Fracas
on the Campus.
SEVERE MEASURES ADOPTED
THE FACULTY ATTEMPTS TO
ENFORCE ITS HULES,
Students at Berkeley Excited Over
the Punishment Meted Out to
Four Freshmen for
Rushing.
BERKELEY, Sept. 21.â The faculty of
the University of California has at last
decided to put its foot down upon the old
.custom of college rushes. By the action
of Its committee on students' affairs It
has already assumed an attltuue of ex
treme severity toward those who took
part in the tussle of last Friday night.
Four freshmen and several sophomores
have been "called up," and one has been
given notice either to withdraw his name
from the academic roll or to suffer tne
penalty of expulsion.
This determined action on the part of
the professors came as a great surprise ;
to all the students this morning, and as a i
consequence the whole university is in a
state of excitement. -
The general sentiment seems to prevail
that the faculty is right In the stand It
has taken, and the more conservative
among the college men Indorse Its action
as far as the principle of the thing goes.
But many complaints are heard that the
punishment meted out was exercised with
unjust discrimination, and It Is expected
that the Associated Students will take the
matter up and request the committee on
students' affairs to reconsider Its deci
sion.
The four freshmen who have felt the
weight of faculty law so unexpectedly are
T. L. Hamlin, R. S. Springer, W. Dixson
and A. McKeown. Springer, McKeown
and Hamlin entered the university last
August from the Berkeley High School.
Dixson Is the crack sprinter from Oregon
and the man who was expected to carry
off the 100-yard dash in fhe next inter
collegiate flelU day.
These four received notices this morning
worded briefly as follows: "The com
mittee on students' affairs desires to see
you in room 5, North Hail, at 11:16 o'clock
Wednesday. This notice takes precedence
of all other university appointments."
Within the committee-room the men
were told that they had violated the rules
of the college, and bo must consider
themselves debarred from the privileges
of the university, with the option of
withdrawing their names themselves
from the academic roll.
R. S. Springer was able to prove that
he took no part in the rush, and was ac
cordingly excused. A. McKeown's case
has been taken under consideration, but
over the other two the sentence 01 the
committee still remains.
When seen by a Call representative this
afternoon Hamlin gave his version of the
affair very frankly:
"We were hardly through with the
baseball game," he said, "when the rush-
Ing started on the other side of me
campus. I stayed behind on the field,
looking after some of the things and talk-
Ing with the players, and did not get near
the fight till ft was just over. I happened
then to see a sophomore on top of a
freshman, and could not resist going to
the help of one of my own classmates.
A minute or bo after the rush was de
clared over, and I never at any time was
in the midst of it. Why I should have
been singled out from the rest I do not
know, but I could not deny before the
committee this morning that I had noth
ing to do with the affair whatever, al
though I only acted on fhe spur of the
moment while passing by when the tussie
was going on. However, the committee
refuses to be lenient on that account, and
there is the option either of withdrawal
or expulsion. I have decided to underro
the latter, because it seems to me U-: t
Justice was hardly done in my case."
All those who took part in the rush
agree that Hamlin has received a much
greater punishment than he deserves and
that he really was the last who ought to
have come under faculty censure. The
majority of the students thfhk it very un
fair that two or three men should have
been selected to suffer for the actions of
a whole class.
Rumors of indignation meetings have
been floating about the campus all day,
and rash suggestions about the whole
freshman class withdrawing from college,
but as the Associated Students is the
proper body to deal with grievances of
this kind a meeting will doubtless be
called for Friday morning to discusa the
matter. It is probable that some agree
ment will then be reached which will
settle the whole question of rushing for
some time to come.
Meanwhile, those who engaged In trie
rush last Friday night are expecting any
moment to be ''called up," with the same
fate in view as those whose cases have
already been dealt with.

A GLANCE AT
REAL ESTATE
But Little Progress Made
in the Market.
THE CAUSE OF DEPRESSION
ATTRIBUTED TO THE FEAB OF
AN INCREASED TAXATION.
Review of the Records, Now Build
[ Ing Contracts, Recent Sales
and t General Realty
'-Â» Notes.
The real estate' market was charaeter
'lzed by but Hale progress during the
past week. Few sales of more than or
dinary Importance and value were ne
'gotlated, and these could easily. In mora
â  prosperous times, , be narrowed down to
the Importance g-enecally afforded the
,ÃBual random note.
The cause for the depression is attrib
uted to many reasons, among others be
ing the expressed fear of both brokers
and property owners as to the probable
Increase of the tax levy threatened by the
Board of Supervisors in exevss and above
that fixed for IS&7. Now chat the rate
has been determined upon to the general
satisfaction, an immediate progress is ex
pected. Realty, to quote an expression
of one of the promine'nt brokers in the
city, is destined before long to evolve
from that condition and period of stag
nation which has characterized Its pro
gress for the greater part, if not the<
â¢whole, of the current year.
At the close of the summer months bet
ter times were predicted for the "World
of Realty, " and the only preventive to
the fulfilment of this prediction seemed
to lay In the threatened exorbitant tax
levy.
Aside from the few sales mentioned be
low there was little or no business tran
sacted during the past week in the prin
cipal offices througnout the city.
Building showed a slight improvement
during the Â»>ck, the record of contracts
.exceeding; that for the previous week by
nearly hair'. Although the majority of
the contracts let were. In the main, for
small values, still there were a few re
corded exceeding the 15000 limit, which,
owing to the almost total lack of build-
Ing operations in the past month or so.
Is considered generally as an excellent
omen for an immediate increase of pro
gress In this department of realty.
The record for trust deeds and mort
gages was almost on a par with that of
the preceding, the prevailing difference
being that there were fewer large pledges
recorded during the past seven days.
REVIEW OF THE RECORDS.
During the week there were forty-seven
mortgages and trust deeds recorded, amount-
Ing to $IC2,OTS. - For the same period thlrty
'three releases nn<l reconveyances passed to
record In the total sum of fl96,tt&

ROWING OVER CORSON'S KISSES.
Lillian Young and Olive Snider Meet~and Black and Blue
Marks Tell the Tale.
Lillian Toting and Olive Snider, the two society recruits of the Corson Clarke
Company, distinguished themselves tho other evening by engaging In a go-as
you-please fistic contest not down on the bills. Miss Young shows several black
and blue spots as evidence of this encounter, while Miss Snider spends her
spare moments In nursing a soft, round dimpled chin.
As with their more famous sisters In art since time Immemorial, Jealousy
was the cause of the unhappy meeting, and the most unfortunate feature of the
whole affair Is that hostilities have not ceased, but are continued uninterrupt
edly night after night when the necessities of the play bring the ladles together
on the stage.
With a voice quivering with suppressed excitement and eyes that threaten
every moment to overflow and wash their coat of sepia off, Miss Snider con
sented to tell her tale of woe.
"She Is Jealous because I sing," said tho Oakland belle. "It's a touching,
tender song, Mr. Clarke's own composition, 'Darling, Because You Choose Me,'
and she almost expires with envy when she sees me alone in the center of the
stage singing those beautiful words. She stands in the wings, watching and
Imitating until I am almost mad and ready to choke. Why the very recollec
tionâ'" and Miss Snider had to resort to a wild cherry drop to soothe the swell
ing folds of her plump, round throat and the recollections of the melancholy
facts. The cherry drop calmed as the printed slip in the box promised it would.
"Have a lozenge?" said Miss Snider. "No! Well, if I want to tell you all my
suffering I must take another to brace, me up," and to the comforting aid of a
tiny red candy the writer owes this recital of Miss Snider's woes.
"If she were only jealous I would not mention it," Bald the society actress
from Oakland, "but it is the way she emphasizes it. At the end of the first
act, when we go off, I am on Mr. Clarke's arm, and as we exit he kisses me re
peatedly. Now Miss Young has to hang round and try to find a place in Mr.
Clarke's very busy mouth. And that 1h when she does it. She grabs hold of
Clarke and raises her left elbow and digs me right in the chin." As Miss
Snider reached the climax of her woes she took another cherry drop, thought
for a moment, stroked her white, smooth, rounded arm and musingly saidâ "and
her bones are sharp. If you come to see the play you want to" watch out
for them, and you won't need an opera glass, either."
"She's Jealous of me," said Miss Young, "because I have a much better part
than she has. And the treatment I have received at that girl's hands! My arm
is black and blue all over. When I have to put my arm around the Bishop'sâ Mr.
Clarke's neckâ she juat works her face in my way, and it is without exception
the hardest thing I ever bumped against. Then she wears a pin, all points and
ends, and manages to entangle It in the lare of my gown, and she tears it in a
different place each evening. But," continued Miss Young with a resigned
sigh. "1 shall not complain. I'm a soldier's daughter and can bear hardships."
Miss Young is the daughter of Brigadier General Young and shone as a so
ciety belle in army circles previous to adopting the stage. Miss Snider was the
belle of select Oakland gatherings before she decided to devote her time, tal
ent and beauty to the fickle fortunes of the theater. Both young ladles made
their professional debut some two months previous at a production of "Moths"
at the California Theater. Miss Young and Miss Snider have both brought with
them to the stage the tact, the talent and the savolr faire that carried them
safely through various social campaigns. They occupy the same dressing room
at the theater and fling delightful sarcasms at each other while they dress and
make up. In the wings they "take each other In" with that lightning, all-ob
serving glance that only social training can perfect. They have brought their
troubles to the management, who with wonderful tact praise one without blam
ing the other.
Next week the curtain raiser "One Touch of Nature" will be put on before
"What Happened to Jones," and to preserve peace and comfort and maybe life
It has been arranged that Miss Young and Miss Snider will alternate In the
leading role.

AND CARGO
Arrival of the Alameda
on Time.
A FULL PASSENGER LIST
SEATTLE - HONOLULU STEAM
SHIP COMPANY IN XBOUBLB.
The City of Columbia Libeled in
Honolulu and Captain Milner
Sued for Falsa Im
prisonment.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
Alameda arrived promptly on time yes
terday morning from Sydney, N. S. W.,
via Auckland, N. Z., Apia, Samoa, and
Honolulu, H. I. Commenting upon the
splendid service g. ven by this company
the New Zealand Herald says:
The regularity and punctuality of the mail
steamers engaged in the San Francisco service
are proverbial, and the Alameda, on her present
voyage, has maintained the reputation of the
line for rapid transit. During the time that
the Union Steamship Company of New Zea
land and Messrs. J. I). Kpreckels & Co. of
Ban Francisco have had the mall contract, the
Bteamere entjaged in the service have never
been once behind time In landing the mails
at this port, and it la a matter of public com
ment that the steamers now make as (food time
as they did whan they first started running on
the line.
The Alameda brought up a full passen
ger list and all the cargo she could carry.
She also brought up J3.000.000 worth of
English sovereigns, which Purser Smith
â was very glad te turn over to the repre
sentatives of the various banks herÂ©.
Among those who came up on the
Bteamer were the Hon. Robert H. Brand,
eon of the Karl of Hampton. Governor of
New South Wales, and Charles R. Bux
ton, son of Sir Fowell Buxton, Bart., Gov
ernor of South Australia.
Miss Annie Rose of Hllo also camÂ© up
on the steamer. She Is on her way to
Kansas to represent Hawaii in the Car
nival of States and Territories to be held
there shortly. Ex-Governor Hogg of
Texas returned from a visit to Hawaii
and Austin Strong-, grandson of Mrs.
Robert Louis Stevenson, Is on his way to
Join his grandmother after graduating
from the Wellington University in Now
Zealand.
Durward L.ely, the famous Scotch tenor,
and Alfred Astley. manager of the Col
onial Sugar Company, wero also passen
gers.
The Seattle-Honolulu Steamship Com
pany Is In trouble. Its first and only
Bteamer, the City of Columbia, was llbol
ed in Honolulu for $15,000, and as the
bonds were not forthcoming the vessel
could not get away on her sailing day.
Rosa, the star of the American Comedy-
Company, set the ball rolling. She as
serted in -her complaint that Captain
Mllner locked her up in her room and
had a number of lndipnltiea heaped upon
her. Russell and William Colgrove were
also placed undor arrest by the captain,
and as soon as he -gave bonds in one case
the others swore out fresh complaints,
and it looked at one time as though the
City of Columbia would end her days
in Hawaiian waters.
The two Colgroves had a fight with one
of the actors of the American Comedy
Company that led to their confinement,
and as the beautiful Rosa was the dis
turbing element, according to Captain
Milner, she was locked up. It appears
that at one time Russell Colgrove was
manage.r of the Seattle-Honolulu Steam
ship Company and William Colgrove was
to have been the Honolulu agent. Both
were passengers on the City of Colum
bia from Seattle. One of the false im
prisonment cases against Captain Milner
was to have been tried the day the Ala
meda sailed.
J. K. James, who left here as chief
steward of the steamer Scandia, was
taken sick on the way to Manila and
had to be landed at Honolulu. He will
probably be able to come back to San
Franfisoo on the nÂ«xt steamer.
Chief Engineer Little of the Alameda
discovered the remains of his famous cat,
Tom, while the vessel was discharging in
Sydney. Tom disappeared the day the
steamer left San Francisco on her last
trip, and as he was very old it was sur
mised that he had crept away to die. He
was found dead among the cargo. The
chief recovered the handsome collar
which the passengers presented to the
cat several voyages ago, and is going to
have It made into an ornament as a me
mento of his dead pet.
The schooner North Bend arrived yes
terday from Bristol Bay. Captain
Schmehl reports that on the Ist inst., in
TJnamak Pass, his vessel sailed through
a lot of wreckage belonging to some
square-rigger. He thinks the stuff was
probably the remains of an old whaler.
The steamer South Portland arrived
here from Astoria -with wheat yesterday.
She came around the Horn to go into the
Klondike trade, but the rush was over
when she got here, so her owners have
put her into the wheat trade.
The San Francisco Harbor of the
American Association of Masters and
Pilots of Steam Vessels has secured very
handsome quarters in the new ferry de
pot. The rooms open off the grand nave,
and as they have been handsomely fur
nished the members will be better housed
than ever before. Captain Wallace of the
Walla Walla flies the harbor's pennant,
William M. Randall is president and R.
N Pippey secretary. The society is one
of the most flourishing in California.
The steam schooner Aloha was injured
on her last trip to Fort Bragg, and was
put on the marine ways at Oakland a few
days. While being shored" up shÂ© slipped
and was severoly strained. Men had to
work on her night and day in order to
get her ready for her usual trip.

SPELLING ACCUSED
OF BEING A TRAITOR
Exciting Scenes at the Democratic Cen
tral Club When He Was
Suspended.
James H. Barry Denounced Him as a Railroad Tool and!
lor a Time It Was Feared There Would
Be Bloodshed.
T. Carl Spelling went flown the tobog
gan slide before the Democratic Central
Club last night, and, In addition to being
euspended, he received a scathing denun
ciation from James H. Barry, the Popu
list-Democratic nominee for Congress in
the Fourth Congressional District.
It was anticipated that there would be
a lively time when the matter of accept
ing or rejecting the report of the cam
paign committee that Spelling was guilty
'of un-Democratlc conduct in laying claim
;ito being the nominee for Congress in
; place of Barry. The Invitations sent out
(to the members of the club to attend the
> meeting at Pythian Castle concluded
;with: "We propose to make It lively for
â¢ bur opponents. Come and see how we do
i It." In consequence, the hall was crowd
ied to overflowing. The promise of making
It lively was kept, and for a time it was
fenred there would be bloodshed.
The evening's entertainment opened
- when Secretary J. J. Maher read the
! recommendation of the investigating com
; mlttee that Spelling be suspended.
E. J. Reynolds, who was chairman of
, the convention which Spellfhg claims
gave him the Democratic nomination for
Congress in the Fourth District, asked
that action on the report be postponed
until the next meeting.
"There is no time for delay," exclaimed
James Powers. "Spelling ie by his action
injuring the prospects of Barry, and we
might as well deal with Rim now as at
any other time."
Reynolds pleaded for time, as he said
that Spelling was not prepared just then
to produce his law points to show that he
was the regular Democratic nominee.
"Why doesn't he present his points to
the committee?" asked James Neil. "He
was given every opportunity to show that '
he was in the right. Instead of doing so
he defied the committee."
Spoiling then spoke in His own behalf, !
and said that he would be ready to ex
plain his position inside of twenty-four
hours if given that length of time. "This
rush and thlrrn for my suspension." he
added, rather bitterly, "is In keeping with
the rest of the programme. It is not lair.
Give me time to prepare my case, for if
you act in this arbitrary way it will do
you no good nor will it add to the credit
of those participating."
Some of the member? believed that the
matter should be considered at a time
when none but members of the club were
present.
"We have nothing secret here," replied
Chairman Holcomb, "and T believe that
the committee report should be acted on
to-night."
James H. Barry, who had been invited
to address the club, entered the hall at
this Juncture. On learning of the dis
cussion in progress, he said that if the
club had other business to attend to he
would visit It some other time.
"I move that we settle the matter to
night," shouted Nell. "We owe It as a
duty to ourselves and to our party."
"But am ! not going to be given a
hearing." exclaimed Spoiling.
""Why. didn't you make your explana
tion to the committee?" was asked.
"I understood that I would be given
time." replied Spelling.
A motion was trade to adopt the com
mittee report and it was carried by an al
most unanimous vote.
"I have been railroaded through,"
Bhoufed Spelling, who was pale with
anger, "by a crowd of infernal lobbyists
and jobber?. I Bcorn and defy you, and
I give you notice, that at the peril of my
life, I will insist upon my rights as a
member of this club."
Then particular!- addressing the chair
man. Spelling called him several vile
names. Cries of "Throw him out" re
sounded through the halt, as Spelling ad
vanced toward Holcomb.
"You are an infamous scoundrel,"
hiSFed Spewing.
C. T. McCarthy then sprang to his feet
and called the attention of the chairman
to the fact that Spelling had put his hand
to his hip pocket.
"Oh, that don't matter," said Holcomb,
"If he has anything there, he won't do
any harm with it."
I am to remain here," said Spelling
rather Bullenly, as he took his seat at the
command of the chairman.
In response to repeated calls Barry then
ADVEBTISEMENTS.
Disfigured
ForJJfe
Almost Entire Face a Solid Sore
Tried Everything for Weeks
, But Kept Spreading Until
Thought There Was No Cure.
I Tried Cuticura. In Few Days
' Better. In Short Time Cured.
fOur little girl's humor commenced with a
tiny soro on one nostril, but it kept on spread-
ing till we thought sho would never get it
cured. For several weeks we tried every-
thing we could get for the blood, both exter-
nally and internally, but it kept getting larger
all the time, till both nostrils, the upper lip, a 1
part of the lower lip,andup one side to the eye, '
were a solid sore. We thought then was no
cure, and that she would be disfigured for life. ,
Finally, (as a last resort) we tried Ctjticuka
Remedies. We used a part of a bottle of the Â°
Cdticuba Resolyext and nearly a box of
Cdticdra (ointment) , and followed the direo-
tlons minutely. After a few days it began to
look better, and in a short time she was en-
- tlrely well, with no scar or trace of the humor.

"I'm not a lickspittle or a cuspidor,"
angrily exclaimed Spelling, "and I want

TORN FROM A DEN OF REEKING FILTH.
Tke Six Little Daughters of Peter jiarxson Will Be
Ser\t to a fViblic Ir\stitutior\.
IN a dingy, filthy hovel, known as
No. 2 Brannan place, or Tanner's
alley, off the main thoroughfare
of Brannan street, between Sixth
and Seventh, Officer McMurray, of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children, accompanied and assisted
by Officers T. D. Gibbon. Daniel Koe
gel and Lawrence Deeley of the regu
lar police force, unearthed, last night,
one of the most revolting- cases of
want, destitution and depravity in the
history of the city. .
When the officers made the raid on
the premises they found the seven
little children of Peter Hanson hud
dled together in a couple of filthy
rooms in the attic or upper story of
the buHding, lying In sleep, some on
the bare boards of the floor and others
on a mattress spared them by their
parents because of Its uselessness as
an article for sale.
The entire five rooms, which consti
tuted the home of the Hansons, were
devoid of furniture save a bed in one
of the upper rooms and another in the
front or main room, the bed chamber
of Hanson and his wife. When found
the children were almost naked, and
the few clothes in which they after
ward dressed themselves were filthy
and utterly unfit for wear.
When Hanson's wife was made
aware of the officers' mission to care
for her seven little children by plac
ing them in a public Institution, sho
became frantic with rage and cursed
and abused McMurray as the ring
leader and instigator of what she
termed the' crime and persecution of
the American Government. She main

lngly. "It is a job of the Southern Pa
cific, I repeat, but it won't do the railroad
any good. The people thoroughly under
stand the methods of the Southern Pa-
cific of Kentucky and will not be fooled
by any so-called independent candidate."
Spelling made another move toward
Barry, and the cries of "throw him out"
were renewed. He then sat down, and
Barry spoke at considerable length in ad
vocacy of the Populist-Democratic-Silver
Republican ticket.
Spelling vainly endeavored to get a
chance to say a few words in his own
defense, but the chairman called him to
order.
"All I want to say," he started, "Is
that I am not a tool of the Southern Pa
cific, and that any one who says so states
that which is false. I am not a lick
spittleâ" but the noise of the chairman's
gavel drowned his voice.
"Take your seat," angrily exclaimed
the chairman.
"If 1 don"t what will you do about It?"
tauntingly asked Spelling.
"You'll go out of the window," replied
some one in the rear of the hall.
Spelling took his seat after remarking
that he would be heard later In a way
that would hurt.
William Craig, John P. Dunn and M.
Greenblatt followed In brief addresses af
ter quiet had been restored.
"Any man who does not want to be re
garded as a railroad tool," said Dunn,
"had better get out of the way of James
H. Barry."
The crowd hung on until the close of
the meeting, expecting that there would
be a personal encounter between Barry
and Spelling. They were disappointed,
however, for the friends of both men
gathered around them and kept them
from getting within punching reach of
one another.

tained that the children were provided
with sufficient clothes and food and
were as happy and comfortable In
their hard beds above as she was with
her mattress and bed clothes below.
When asked if she was not afraid to
allow the children to go to bed by the
light of the candles which they used
she said they were able, to take care
of themselves; and if they did set fire
to the place she would be willing to
take the consequences of burning to
death with them.
Nellie, a girl of 12 years and a crip
ple, clung to her mother and begged
that she accompany herself and her
Bisters to the City Prison. The moth
er, pointing to the girl, remarked to .
the officers that the little devil (mean
ing the cripple) had cost her $2000
through her Illness and deformity,
and in view of this fact she was not
going to part with her.
Hidden under the covering on the
bed in which Mrs. Hanson lay was
the half-naked form of another child,
which the mother and the children
who surrounded her tried to conceal
from the officers. All tfte children
fought and protested when they were
told they would have to leave their
wretched home. .
Lilian, a girl 14 years of age, jot
down on her knees and invoked a
curse upon the officers and the
strangers present for taking her away
from her mother.
Mrs. Hanson in her rage told one of
the girls to get a rope and hang her
self, as she could do nothing to save
her.

neighbors that the father Is continu
ally drunk. His eldest daughter, Tes
sle, aged 18, was forced to leave the
house two weeks ago because, the
neighbors say, of .her father's drunk
enness and inhuman abuse.
Hanson was not at the house when
the officers arrived, but in all proba
bility will be placed under arrest this
morning.
Six of the childrenâ Lilian, aged 14;
Agnes, aged 8; Nellie, 12; Viola, 6;
Mnmle, 10, and Hazel, a baby 4 years
of ageâ were taken in charge by Offi
cer McMurray and were sent to the
City Prison, where they are now
lodged pending their removal to a
charitable institution. Tessie, the old
est girl, being of age, was allowed to
remain with her mother, the latter
claiming that she had been confined in
bed for the past three days through
illness.
The only means of support the fam
ily had was the money Tessie, Lilian,
Nellie and Charlie, an only brother,
brought home from the different sweat
shops where they worked.
When the officers left the house last
evening Mrs. Hanson and her
daughter threatened to commit sui
cide.
GOING TO KANSAS
TO BE A QUEEN
ANNIE ROSE, THE BEAUTY OF HILO, WILL REIGN OVER TOPEKA
DURING THE CARNIVAL.
MISS ANNIE ROSE, famed through- !
out the Hawaiian Islands for her j
marvelous beauty and bewitching
personality, is going to Topeka, I
Kans., to be their carnival queen. This
is the delicate and charming way the
carnival knights of Kansas chose to com
pliment the new land over which the
stars and stripes now float, and, inciden
tally, to save themselves Irom dissension
and the spilling of good Kansas blood.
There are so many pretty girls in Kan
sas, so many Topekan beauties who
should have been born to the purple, and,
above all, so many girls who possess the
inborn power to rule â a successful acces
sory to the "divine right of kinds''â that I
the annual selection of a sovereign be
came a matter attended with much dan- I
ger. The Kansas knights openly declared
their inability to select one from the many
majestic beauties at home, and so offered
their city's keys and' the many loyal sub
jects to the Hawaiian goddess.
Miss Rose came up on the Alameda, and
was met by Mrs. C. K. Holliday, who
came all the way from her home in the I
cyclone State to chaperone the youthful
sovereign. Miss Rose is the daughter of
L<oke, a wealthy Hilo planter, "he has
enjoyed all the advantages that wealth
and education afford. She converses flu
ently in English, German and French,
and, of course, her native language; is
mistress of the piano, mandolin and gui
tar and the fortunate possessor of a de
lightfully flexible, full, sweet voice. The
fame of the young girl's beauty extends

Continental League Meeting.
The regular"- weekly meeting of the
ContinentrfT'League was held with Frank
D. Worth in the chair at Saratoga- Hall
last night. A letter was received from
Julius Kahn, Republican nominee for
Congress from the Fourth District,
thanking the league for its support in
his behalf. Secretary Ruggles was in
structed to send a dispatch to President
McKinley extending an invitation to
visit California.
The League was addressed by Charles

Sichel entertained the league with some
choice piano selections.
far and near, and the Islanders have
given her the fitting sobriquet, the
"Rose of Hilo."
The "Rose of Hilo" is in appearance
every inch a queen. Tall, of supple, gra
cious yet commanding figure, she carries
herself majestically. Her iace, Hawaiian
in outline, Is lit up by a pair of marvelous
dark eyes, at once roguish, coquetish and
soulful. In her soft, round, creamy cheeks
two dimples play at hide and seek and
make her winsome smile a thing never to
be forgotten. Immediately upon her ar
rival Miss Rose was confronted with the
first of her queenly duties. A modiste
took hold of her and measured the majes
tic figure for the royal robes. In the
afternoon the carnival queen went to the
Presidio, where the Kansas boys were
especial objects of her gracious inspec
tion. Miss Rose will leave on Friday
morning for Sacramento, where she will
be the guest of Mrs. Edward R. Hamil
ton, and on Saturday she will leave the
capital city for Kansas, where i.er loyal
subjects await her. But two stops will
be made on the Journey â one at Hutchin
son, where a reception will be held, and
the other at Emporia, where the beauty
will don the royal robes. Governor J. W.
Leedy of Kansas and Mayor Charles A.
Fellows of Topeka will greet her Majesty
upon her arrival and deliver to her the
keys of the city.
The carnival Wi.l continue from Septem
ber 26 to October 1. After the festivities
Miss Rose will be the guest of honor at
the Omaha Exhibition. To-morrow even-
Ing the beauty 01 Hilo will hold an infor
mal reception at the Colonial, and will
receive the boys of the Twentieth Kansas
and all the officers stationed at the Pre
sidio.

CANDIDATES SPRINGING UP
SILVER REPUBLICAN'S DEMAND
A SLICE.
Fusion Will Be Favored if the Many
Elements Do Not Want Too
Much of the
Spoils. '
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Sept. 21.
Democrats. Populists, Silver Republi
cans and any other stray political organ
izations that have ideas which they want
to exploit through a place hunter or two
will meet next Saturday to nominate a
county ticket. The Democrats will meet
in Germanla Hall, while the Populists
will hold forth in Grand Army Hall. A
fusion committee will pass from one to
the other until a ticket has been fixed up.
At last night's Democratic primaries
there were two tickets in some of the
Assembly districts, but in each instance
the fusion element won out. There is,
however, much to be done before har
mony can be expected, for Chairman
Brosnahan of the county committee is not
in favor of fusion, while the Populists,
who are already split up, are clamoring
for a larger share of tfie offices than the
Democrats are willing to accord them.
The Silver Republicans also demand rec
ognition, and have appointed a commit
tee on conference which will demand to
be heard.
Candidates are now beginning to ap
pear, and It is certain that ex-Congress
man Glascock will try to beat Supervisor

The Populists at thefr primaries last
night also elected delegates favorable to
fusion, "if it can be brought about on
such terms as the delegates may deem
fair to the Populist party." The Populists
are now proclaiming from the housetops
that four years ago they won all tne
county offices w.th any patronage without
fusion, while the Democrats have not a
man in office. On this showing the Pop
ulists declare they are entitled to about
three-quarters of the whole cake, and as
. ,_A? enio . crats woul Â«l Hke abouf seven
eiphths of it somebody will have to give
way. Candidates in both parties have be
come painfully numerous during the past
twenty-four hours, and there Is no
that each party would like to put up a
complete slate to prevent friction at the
convention but for the fact that fusion
would necessitate two complete slates, so
many place-hunters are demanding rec
ognition.
