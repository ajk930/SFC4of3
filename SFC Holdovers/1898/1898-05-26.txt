SAILED TO MEET THE SPANISH FOE
flmid Noisy Demonstrations of Farewell
the Three Troopships Passed Out
Through th;e Golden
Gate.
BY HENRY JAMES.
AT last our soldiers are away on I
the broad Pacific. They went
from among people who loved
them and the fl;ig they have taken oath ,
to defend. They went as guns were
booming, whistles shrilling an adieu,
flags waving, colors dipping, women
weeping. They went amid the pray
ers of the people and a shower of bless- |
Ings. Their hist sight of San Fran
cisco showed them the hills black with
unwonted life, the wharves Jammed and
on the roofs of houses the silhouettes
against the evening sky of those who
Â»ent them forth to victory or to find
graves on a distant shore. Joy and
sorrow mingled in the farewell.
How shall the scene of their go- <
Ing be described? What pen shall !
portray the glorious sight, the beauty j
of It, and the pathos? It was long j
after noon. A rumor had flashed
across the city that the ships which
had been swinging in the stream were
to Ball. The people had watched the
soldiers go aboard. They had crowded
about the sons of California and Ore- !
gron and the faithful regulars to say a
final word as they passed through the i
streets, to give a handclasp, perhaps a
flower. They had withheld no tribute
of tear nor benediction. But now the
boys were going out the Golden GatÂ»,
dreary days and miles, and the hearts
of the people were touched anew. They
thronged to the water front by hun
dreds and by thousands. They car- i
ried the stars and stripes. With one i
accord they sought to make the last
moments of their boys a time of cheer
and laughter. What of the horrors of
â war and the bray I lives going to bat- â 
tie? War was over sea. Here was
youth and buoyancy. Here was the
good blood of the nation going to up
hold the honor of us all, going willing
ly and gladly. Did the eyes grow :
misty the tears came all unbidden and f
were hastily brushed away. Did a
lump come into the throat the sob was i
changed to a shout, and from the laden :
ships â¢would come a shout in answer, a
very jubilation.
Out in the bay were the City of Pc- j
king, the Australia and the City of
Bydney. From every mast waved the
flag. Into the rigging and upon the !
yard arms swarmed the soldiers. They i
leaned over the railing, hailed their
friends, Jested with girls who laughed
and cried. There was no sign of re- i
gret. Some, indeed, did look toward
the hills of the city and their faces
grew wistful, but only for an instant. ;
They would come back; of course the}'
would come back, and again there
would be music and the flutter of flags.
They would come back as hf-roes. They
did not seem to know that they wont
as heroes, and that the blare of thÂ»
hour, the tumult was for them as much
as for the cause for which they take up
arms. The undercurrent of sorrow I
was hid depp.
Never in recent years has the bay
\\ppti so animated. About the three
ships there circled various craft, al!
full, all dressed as for a gala day.
There were bands which played pa
triotic airs, and one played "Annie \
Laurie." As the old sweet melody struck J
across the dancing waters, "I'd lay m*
doon and dee," It touched a chord so
tender and subtile that for a space si
lence fell. Brave, bonny lads. They :
THE TROOPSHIPS, OFF ALCATRAZ, HEADING FOR THE SEA.
The San Francisco Call
too, would "lay them doon and dee."
And to such as may hap to give thÂ»
lives they offer so freely may there
come to brighten the bitter hour a
thought of the afternoon when San
Francisco bade them good-by and sem
them from her rich in an affection
which shall abide.
Every boat -which came near received
from the boys the order "Blow your
whistle," and the whistle blew. Then
from the crowded deck and the rigging
where they clung would come a series
of hurrahs, to which spontaneous re
ply was certain, and the clamor hardly
knew pause. There were cheers for
the Governor and the State officials
steaming alongside in the show of gold
braid. There were cheers for the
meanest boat afloat if only it displayed
the red, white and blue, and just as
hearty as if for the ocean-going
steamer moving with slow dignity up
and down. There were Whitehall boats
of the crudest type. One contained a
boy and two girls. They had some flags
and flowers. "Blow your whistle," de
manded the soldiers. The girls waved
the flags and tried to cast the blossoms
aboard the Peking. "They'd have
blowed a whistle if they had it," said
a Jolly young soldier. "Three cheers for
the Whitehall." Only one craft was
cheered more mightily.
The tug Monarch drew near. At the
fore was a flag upon which was the em
blem of the Red Cross. Then the sol
diers burst into a shout. Again and
again they expressed the rratitud'- for
the kindness and nobility that emblem
represents. They threw kisses to the
ladies â not after the manner of gallants
seeking conquest â but a* to mothers
and sisters, and I doubt not could they
have reached the deck of the Monarch
they would have saluted the women on
the lips with kisses as pure as they had
bestowed when saying farewell to those
of their own blood. And the salutes
would have been returned. The Man
arch came to the side of the Peking and
was made fast. On the forward deck
a woman who had been active in
Red Cross work, and she wore a pin of
the ord^r. A boyish soldier spied it.
He tipped his hat. "I would like to have
that pin," he said. She took it from her
bosom, thrust it into a handkerchief
and sÂ»nt it up in a basket that had been
lowered. Then there was a scramble
for the token, but the one who had
asked for it got it and smiled back his
sense of gratitude and triumph. Per
haps he will find in the token some day
a comfort. It may carry his mind back
to a knowledge that he has a place in
the common affection. Keep well the
pin, young soldier. She who gave it is
one of many whose prayers will follow
you wherever fate may call.
Sometimes for several minutes the
noise would bp so de-afoning that the
bands seemed to he playing in panto
mime. Whistle vied with whistle, and
from every throat there would issue all
the sound of which it was capable. One
could be conscious that he himself was
cheering, but his neighbors' cheers he
â would have to take on faith. Then
there would be a lull, and into jt would
break the faint boom of a cannon. All
the while the men were laughing as
blithely -is if they were hound for a
pleading excursion, and through nil the
noise there proceeded the work of put
ting supplies on board. The Cty of
Sydney was ready, as those versed in
signal lore affirmed they could read.
SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY, MAY 26, 1898.
The Australia seemed impatient at the
galling anchor chain, and the last barge
load at the side of the City of Peking
was rapidly disappearing within. The
tugs alongside were ordered to cast off.
There were a few blasts from the
steamer's whistle, a rattle of
steel, and the great ship began
to move. Then began a spec
tacle magnificent, profoundly touching,
stirring to their depths the emotions of
reverence and sorrow ,-md pride.
At first the ship moved so slowly that
scarce a ripple shimmered at her prow;
then faster and faster, until, "with a
bone in her teeth," she sped in the
golden pathway made by the sinking
sun, out toward the gate which guards
the Pacific, and away, away, farther
and more far from the tugs and
launches which hurried after. Smoke
poured in great volumes from her
stacks; hr>r towering spars grew dim in
the distance. Then the Australia
straightened herself out and came in
the wake of the Peking, and a little
behind was the City of Sydney.
Xo procession more stately ever
plowed the Western seas than that
which passed into history when our
boys began their long journey. As it
went the redouts of Alcatraz thundered
and Black Point and Fort Point ac
knowledged the event with their brav
est guns. The three ships drew close
to each other and so vanished.
Over the decks of the tugs dashed a
storm of spray, but it could drive none
to seek shelter. Every eye was upon
the trio of ships, and yet it was a sat
isfaction to look ashore and see the
hills alive with people and catch a
glimpse of flags and waving white. A
fog began to roll in, a cloud lowered.
It swallowed up the masts and then not
even the smoke could be seen.
Our boys had gone. The tugs
turned back. The wind died down.
The flags drooped. Voices were no
lonper raised. The ships fading
into the twilight horizon seemed almost
a tragedy. There was a sense of deso
lation and chill.
California has been distinguished.
From here went the first soldiers to
fight a battle during the present war.
From here have gone the first regiments
which in all the years the country has
sent to other lands to uphold its flag.
They were our friends. We glory in
them. May honor be theirs and victory.
THE GOVERNOR AND
STAFF SAY FAREWELL.
A Salute of Twenty-One Guns Fired
From the State Flagship and
the Transports Pass
Out to Sea.
Word was passed around the Inner
circles of National Guard field and staff
officers that the fleet for th-> Philippines
would sail at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.
With little delay Adjutant General Bar
rett, General Dickinson. General War
field and others boarded the Harbor
t 'onimissioners' boat, the Governor
Markham, and put off to th^ Manila
fl< â¢ t in the stream. The tug was beau
tifully dressed for the event and with
the Stars and Stripes displayed the
Governor's flag. The band that has
been on duty f several days escorting
regiments from the depot along Market
street was aboard the boat and dis
coursed patriotic airs to tho delight of
the cheering soldiers on the big ships.
The first visit was paid to the City
of Peking. The tug ran close along
side the mammoth : amship and the
men of the First California crowded to
catch the news and talk to their visi
tors from the shore. <. neers were given
for Colonel Smith, Lieutenant Colonel
Duboce and the n Jors of the respective
battalions.
Th^ next call made was on the steam
ship Australia, where men of the Four
teenth T T ..ited States Infantry and Ore
gon Volunteers responded to the greet
ings of the officers on board the Mark
ham. Lieutenant Cloman, U. S. A.,
commissary of subsistence, was singled
out for an ovation. He ca:..e to the rail
and received three cheers from his fel
low soldiers on the tug. Cheers were
likewise given for the Oregon boys, for
the regulars and Captain Geary. The
tug then steamed alongside the City of
Sydney and cheered the brave men
aboard of that ship. The band played
the "Star Spangled Banner," "Ameri
ca," "Auld Lang Syne" and "Red,
White and Blue."
Meanwhile the fleet of visiting tugs
and steamers was constantly increas
ing in number until the ships preparing
to sail for the Orient were surrounded
by saluting craft. The music of count
less bands, the noise of numerous
whistles, the shouting and cheering, to
gether with the responsive voices from
the ships, made such a volume of sound
that individual greetings could not be
distinguished from the chorus of salu
tation.
The man at the wheel on the Mark
ham had his eye on the anchor of the
Peking and exclaimed to his companion
holding the whistle cord:
"When you see the ring of the an
chor blow the whistle for all that's
out." Presently some one remarked,
"There goes the blue peter," and short
ly the anchor ring came^ above the
water. This was the signal for turn
ing loose all the whistles on the waters
of the bay and the land of the penin
sula. Instantly tugs made haste to get
in line for the start toward the Golden
Gate. The Peking, released from her
moorings, drifted a half ship's length,
and then the stately vessel set her
course for the sea and soon acquired
speedy headway.
The superb steamship Australia gave
the flagship a chance to get a fair
start before giving an exhibition of her
own speed. The^style and go displayed
by the Australia, before the salutes of
Alcatraz had been counted convinced
the spectators that she could easily
l^ad the fleet to Manila, The City of
Sydney came along in good form, hut
did not give an exhibition of fast run
ning for the pleasure of onlookers.
Thf State tug Governor Merkham in
tended to sail close to the flagship and
fire a salute in honor of thf> flag at
close quarters, but the excursion steam
er Ukiah cut in, and the salute had to
be fired at longer distance than th-*
adjutant-general had estimated. The
volunteers aboard the Peking respond
ed to- the salute with prolonged f-hoers.
Hardly had the smoke of the Mark
ha.m's guns vanished when Alcatraz
paid a booming compliment of eleven
guns to the outgoing fleet. <~"heer after
chr-er from the men aboard the Peking
acknowledged the compliment from the
picturesque island battery.
When Fort Point was reached the
escorting tugs and steamers, finding
the pace of the fleet too fast f<rr small
craft, came about and sailed for the
nearest home port.
And so, as the sun was declining on a
beautiful day in May, the first column
of American soldiers for war in the
Orient sailed through the Golden Gate.

CHEERED THE TROOPS
FROM THE SHORE
Crowds Gathered on the Wharves
and Hilltops and Waved a Fare
well to the Soldiers.
All day long people waited on the
docks to see the three big transports
start on their voyage to the Orient. By

Home Shores on a Foreign
Invasion.
noon the wharves commanding a view
of Mission Bay, where the ships were
riding at anchor, were crowded with
men, women and children, each armed
with an American flag and a super
abundance of enthusiasm.
Rumors were freely circulated that
the trwp ships would not sail until this
morning, but still the crowds waited,
their numbers being steadily augment
ed. At length the news spread that the
time of departure had been definitely
fixed for 3 o'clock and there was a rush
from all parts of the city. The docks
at the north end of the front were soon
filled and the entire length erf the sea
wall was lined with spectators.
< >ut in the bay gaily bedecked craft
of every description, from the bobbing
Whitehall to launches, tugs and steam
boats, were circling about the three big
liners, each crowded to its utmost ca
pacity with noisy passengers.
A few minutes after 3 o'clock the
"blue peter" was hoisted on the Aus
tralia, General Anderson's ship, and
when the seafaring men explained to
the land-lubbers that it was the signal
to get under way a shout went up, roll
ing along the entire front like a great
billow.
The Sydney, which was lying furth
est up the bay, was the first to get her
anchor up, the Peking following less
than a minute later, while the Australia
did not begin to move until the others
were well under way. The Peking first
swept along well in to the docks, her
decks swarming with the boys of the
gallant First taking their final leave of
hr-me. while in the bow was gathered
the detachment of seventy-five sailors
going out to join Dewey's fleet. The
cheers of the men could be plainly
heard even through the frightful din
caused by the whistles of shops, mills
and factories on shore and every steam
craft on the bay, all of which opened
up the minute thp ships began to move.
Further out the Australia skimmed
along, the Oregon boys vicing with
thfMr California comrades in answering
the parting shouts of the multitudes on
shore.
Hardly a mile behind came the Syd
ney, her passengers also answering
cheer with cheer. All three ships were
under full headway long before they
trot to Alcatraz, and they rushed
through the gate at a clip that will
land the slowest erf them in Honolulu
well within seven days. The opinion
was freely expressed along the front
that the Australia would arrive at
Honolulu at least ten hours ahead of
the others.. They will all make the run
at top speed and should be in sight of
each other for the next four days.
Perhaps the prettiest scene <m the
bay, as viewed from shore, were the
revenue cutters Corwin. Rush and
Grant. They were anchored off Folsorn
street, clad in their war paint, and trim
and light as ducks. When the trans
ports began to move the foreyards of
all three cutters swarmed with sea
men, each one waving a huge Amer
ican flag. The whistles of the little
warships joined in the grand chorus,
the salute being returned by each of
the transports.
Not until the Sydney was well out of
sight did the people abandon their
coigns of advantage on the wharves
and return to their homes.
THE NAVAL RESERVE
CALLED TO DUTY
Will Man the Mosquito Fleet and
Fill Up the Mohican's
Crew.
The call has come to the naval mi
litia at last, and the men of the re
serve will have a chance to see ser
vice. At half past 11 yesterday morn
ing Adjutant-General Barrett was
asked to furnish to the Government
men and officers to man the tugs Iro
quois, Vigilant and Active, and three
officers and fifty men for the sloop-of
war Mohican. By half past 2 o'clock
General Barrett was able to answer
that he had the men and officers ready
and that they would be mustered for
duty in the time it took to bring them
to the city. The call was for fifteen
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
officers and 135 men, and within three
hours they had been selected and had
reported ready.
The order for men came from Ad
miral John A. Miller, commander of the
Pacific station. In his letter to the ad
jutant-general he stated that the offi
cers required would be asked to pass
only the physical examination and
would have to secure a leave of ab
sence from the Governor for one year
before they would be accepted. Slight
disabilities would be waived, he wrote,
but would have to be noted on the ap
pointment, and under no circumstances
would a commission be granted of a
higher grade than that of a lieutenant.
In the request for men and in the
service which they are to be assigned
to the California Naval Militia has
been paid a compliment not accorded
that of any other State. The three tuga
will be manned and officered from alow
to aloft by naval reserves; they will
man the decks, the guns, the firerooms
and the bunkers, and there will not be
a regular man or officer on board. So
far the Government has contented it
self with putting the reserves on board
vessels partly manned by regular sea
men, or at least with the higher offi
cers drawn from the regulars, but the
patrol fleet of this coast will have the
unique distinction of being a militia
fleet, so far as the three tugs, so well
known in this bay, are concerned. They
will be attached to Admiral Miller's
fleet.
The draft of officers for the various
vessels is as follows:
For the Iroqunisâ l,. H. Turner for captain,
rank lieutenant; T. A. N'erney for lieutenant,
junior grade; A 11. Elliott for ensign . H. P.
Gray for passed assistant ensign, relative rank
lieutenant.
For the Vigilantâ W. H. Gunn for captain,
rank lieutenant; J. M. Squier for lieutenant.
Junior grade; o. R. Hammerer for ensign: Mr.
Kills for assistant engineer, relative rank en-
sign.
For the Active â T. M. Shaw for captain, rank
lieutenant: A. E. Morgan for lieutenant. Junior
grade; T. E. Armstrong for ensign; A. E.
Williams for assistant engineer.
For the Mohicanâ William F. Burke, lieu
tenant: J. J. Delaney, ensign; W. G. Morrison,
ensign.
L. H. Turner, assigned to the Iro
quois, is the commander of the naval2

to a colonel in the army. In taking
command of the Iroquola he sacrifices
three grades. T. A. Nerney is the ex
executive officer of the reserve, and he

Nine of the officers are located in San
Francisco, and these are available at
any time; the others are from the out

cers from San Diego will start for this
city to-day.
The enlisted men for the Mohican
hrive already been placed under the or
ders of the Government, and the petty
officers and men for the tu^s will be
furnished as fast as the Government
calls for them. The Governor has in
formed the (Jovernrnent that he will
furnish any uniforms or equipments
thi* Government may call for, as those
in the hands of the reserve are all in
good condition.
PENNSYLVANIA'S
REGIMENT IN CAMP.
The Crack Troops of the Keystone
State Greeted and Feasted
on Their Arrival.
F the Tenth Penn
sylvania fall cap
tive to the Spaniards
as easily as it did
to the Red Cross
Society yesterday
the enviable record
they have gained
will be for naught.
But such a thing Is
not to be considered
as possible, for their
bravery has been
put to the test too
â  ften for any sane
person to think for
an instant that they
would yield to any
body of men on
earth.
Rut with women
they are as helpless
as babe , especially
when the women
happen to wear the
magic insignia of
the Red Cross.
The Tenth landed
at the foot of Market street at 7 a. m.
yesterday, and. as all who had come
before, they were at once marched into
the Red Cross headquarters and given
a breakfast ; h as they have not
tasted since they left home, and f.tr
better than any they hoped to get while
on the campaign. Hot bread and but
ter, fresh fruits in abundance and pies
and cakes of every description were
Berved, and the men ate until they
could scarcely raise their voices in a
>f acknowledgment.
Then came the brief skirmish and the
Ignominious surrender of gallant old
Colonel Hawkins. Flowers had been
provided as abundantly as food and the
ladies asked permission to distribute
them among the officers and men.
The colonel said "No," and he meant
it. Who ever heard of a regiment of
soldiers going to war decked out like a
lot of picnicking school children? Such
a thing was at.: aid and most unmili
tary. He was deeply touched by the
lavish treatment of himself and his
command, but h" would have to draw
the line .it (lowers.
Then Judge Hunt and J. B. Stetson
pleaded on behalf of the ladies. All the
others had been allowed to wear flowers
nut to camp, ami really the ladies would
feel hurt If his men were i I permitted
to be similarly favored.
Colonel Hawkins wavered an Instant,
then atti mpted to maintain his former
position, but it was too late. The ladles
saw the slight opening and stormed him
In a body. They backed him into a cor
ner and pelted him with roses until he
was glad to capitulate. A gTeat shout
vent up at the bloodless victory and
soon every man in the regiment had a
bunch of posies pinned, onto his breast,
another tucked In his belt, while a great
calla lilly burst out from the muzzle
of every rifle.
As for Colonel Hawkins, when he
mounted his horse half an hour later
and started up Mc-'-et street at the
head of the column he looked like an
Easter bonnet.
Those Pennsylvanians are a fne look-
Ing lot Â°* feUows and comprise the flow
er of the w.stern part of the Keystone
State. In Company I, for instance, there
are more than twenty lawyers and sev
eral bankers serving in the ranks, while
company Q boasts of numbering the
entire football team of the Washington
and Jefferson University, as well as
many more prominent college and ama
teur athletes. The other companies are
of equally Rood standing.
Colonel Hawkins is every inch a sol
dier and has been in command of the
Tenth for nineteen years, during which
long term he has seen much hard ser
vice among strikers.
The members were astonished at their
reception by the Hod Cross Society, and
a group of men asked a Call reporter if
the other troops had fared any where
near as royally. When told they had
been all treated alike they were inclined
to doubt it and thought former Penn
syivanians must tULVS made special ar
rangements for the Tenth.
When, however, they started out to
camp and witnessed the enthusiastic
demonstration In their honor by all
classes of Oitlsena they realized that
San Francisco's reputation for hospital
ity has not been tXMfger&ted. All along
the line of march the streets were
crowded with cheering thouMtnda, who
â waved Oaf*. im<i ihouted thetnMlTea
hoarse at the nun who had Hped across
the continent Â»t their country's call.
Carrf â vvae not reached uutil ufter 11
o'clock, but the baggage had all arrived
so there was no delay in pitching camp,
which is located on the west of. the
Colorado regiment.
The Pennsylvanlans, upon reaching
Third and Market streets, were greeted
with an artillery salute from the top of
the Claus Spreckels building, and as
round after round was fired the men
from the Quaker State were Inspired
witli unbounded enthusiasm. Even
their mascot, a large black and white
dog, named Dewey, looked up at the
curling smoke that followed each dis
charge of The Call's cannon and re
sponded to each report with a canine
'rah. The Pennsylvanians, who had
much difficulty in pushing through the
dense crowd, were greatly pleased at
their enthusiastic reception.
CALIFORNIA'S QUOTA
OF ADDITIONAL TROOPS
Governor Budd Ready to Respond
Promptly to the President's
Second Call.
The news from Washington that the
President had called for 75,000 more
men and that California's quota under
the call would be equal to two regi
ments created joy in the ranks of the
National Guard. The following tele
gram was received by The Call at a
late hour last night:
WASHINGTON, l>. C. May 25, 1898
The War Department has not yet de
cided upon the character of troops to be
furnished by each State under to-uay a
call.
Governor Budd had not been advised
up to a late hour last night whether
infantry alone would be required or
troops fur other arms of the service be
demanded- The Governor remarked:
"California's quota under the second
call can be supplied within twenty-four
hours. In infantry regiments of the
National Guard are desired they can
be mustered into the United States ser
vice at once. If mounted men are
wanted three troops of cavalry seeking
admission to the service of the United
States may be mustered in without de-
California can supply additional
batteries of heavy artillery or place in
the field effective batteries of light ar
tillery." , ,
Last evening Governor Budd and Ad
jutant General Barrett discussed sub
jects pertaining 'to the transfer of
troops under the second call. W mle
the details of the conference were not
given to the public it was ascertained
that there was an expression of views
to the- effect that the Fifth Infantry
Regiment of the National Guard should
Rave an opportunity to go to the front
us United States volunteers from Cali
fornia. The opportunity may be af
forded for companies of the National
Guard in the Sacramento Valley to get
to the front. It is believed that another
battalion will be added to the Sixth
Infantry, which will make that organi
zation a twelve-company regiment.
THE SIGNAL CORPS.
Duty in Sight for the Signal
men of California.
Captain Thompson, signal onicer,
United States army, yesterday re
quested Adjutant-General Barrett
to submit the names of ten elec
tricians, twenty telegraphers and
twenty-five expert flagmen, as a
preliminary steps to the formation
of a signal corps.
TROOPS AT THE PRESIDIO.
The Eight Companies of the
Sixth California Expect to
Occupy the Barracks.
The <!â¢ parture of the First Regiment of
California Volunteers, the Second Oregon
Volunteers an* t lit- companies of the
Fourteenth Regular Infantry for Manila
baa left the Presidio almost deserted. The
soldiers remainiiig there are four troops
of the Fourth Regular Cavalry Regiment
and eight companies <>f the Sixth Califor
nia, which are designated as the First
and Second Battalions <>f California \ â¢!
unteers. it is expected that these two
battalions will in the near future iÂ»- con
solidated into an eight-company regiment,
and General Merriam is quoted as saying
that th.y will be retained here for coast
defense duty, together with the Third
Battalion <>f the First Regiment of Wash
ington Volunteers and two batteries of ar
tillery. The eight companies of the Sixth
California, numbering 6SO men, are under
command of Lieutenant-Colonel \\ . R.
Johnson. They have been camped in
tents for two weeks, but are expected to
receive orders to occupy the barracks at
the Presidio. They are in need of cloth
ine especially 6hoe6, and hope to be soon
completely equipped in this respect. The
men have been overwhelmed with contri
butions of delicacies, which are not con
ducive to their health, and Lieutenant -
Colonel Johnson, while admiring the sen
timent that prompts these- gifts, says it is
about time to call a halt, as soldiers can
not be physically hardened for military
duty on a dirt of dessert. It is therefore
likely that he will see at om-e that his
men "consume more substantial food than
cake, j>ie and other delicacies.

SEVEN THOUSAND MEN.
Strength . of the Army Now
Encamped in the Richmond
District.
The main thing of interest yesterday In
Camp Richmond were the arrivals of the
Seventh California and Tenth Pennsylva
nia Regiments of Volunteers. Both of
these commands received a rousing wel
come from their new comrades, who lined
the sides of their respective camps to
| cheer the newcomers. Colonel Berry's
regiment reached Camp Richmond from
the Presidio about 10 o'clock and was fol
lowed an hour later by the boys from the

The soldiers of the various regiments
are loud in their praise of the Red Cross
Society and the hospitality and kindness
of the people generally. Yesterday near

brought some kind of donation. Many
brought edibles, such as sandwiches and
pies, and others clothing and shoes. The
men are well supplied with provisions
and the various commanders are in
hopes that two weeks will see their men

far reported. Private Smith, E Com

of the day's work for the soldiers, and

The officers of the Seventh were the
guests of the two light Idaho batteries
yesterday. Mayor Phelan s^nt an entire

Adjutant de Ford of the Twentieth
Kansas denies the report that Governor
Leedy of Kansas was burned in effigy by
the men of his regiment because he did
not properly equip the regiment before
its departure. On the contrary, he de
clares tho men of the Twentieth idolize
the Governor, who did everything possi
ble for them. The fact Is Kansas has
only 1200 soldiers in the National Guard,
and these were very poorly equipped with
a scant supply of State property. There
was no appropriation in the State treas
ury to provide for the troops, but de
spite this Governor Leedy did the best he
could for the regiment, and even assisted
it out of his own pocket.
There are now TOftii soldiers at Camp
Richmond, including enlisted men and
commissioned officers. Their respective
Strength by command is as follows:
Seventh California Regiment 1026
Tenth Pennsylvania Regiment... 640
First Battalion, Wyoming 338
Batteries A and B, Utah 250
First Colorado Regiment 1008
First Nebraska Regiment 1022
Twentieth Kansas Regiment 1016
Thirtieth Minnesota Regiment.. 1030
First Battalion, Idaho 680
Company G, 14th U. S. Infantry 86
Grand Total 7096
In a week's time this force will prob
; ably be augmented by 4501 additional
troops. This is an approximate estimate
on the strength of the cavalry from Utah,
the Eighteenth and Twenty-third Regi
ments. I'nited States Infantry, and the
Dakota Infantry, which should arrive by
i Sunday. This will be the nucleus of the
30,000 troops to be mobilized here by the
Government, and from this will be taken
Th.- expeditionary forces that will form
the second column for Manila.
SEVENTH CALIFORNIA.
The Regiment Leaves the Pre
sidio and Joins the Camp
at Richmond.
The Seventh California Regiment moved
! its camp yesterday from the Prexidio over
to ("amp Richmond, where General Otis
! will establish his headquarters. Colonel
Berry had a talk with General Otis on
Monday In reference to Joining the other
forces that are now being concentrated
at Camp Richmond, and General Otis in
formed him that he would be ordered to
move if wagons to transfer his property
could be secured, but at 7 o'clock yester
day morning Colonel Berry had received
no order to move, and the llrst intimation
that he had of it was when he read In
The Call the announcement that orders
had been Issued for him to move. He Im
mediately gave the necessary orders to
his company commanders for the striking
i of the camp, and at 7:46 o'clock, at the
; sound of the bugle, every tent fell to
gether. The work of packing the camp
j equipments and baggage was accom
plished in short order, and at a few niln
utes past fc o'clock the Seventh fell Into
line and began its inarch to the new
camp. The soldiers of the Sixth cheered
their departing comrades loudly, while
from the Fourteenth Infantry a farewell
was blown by the chief bugler.
Camp Richmond was reached after a
* WASH PAY IN THE UTAH tfiM^
march of an hour and a half, and Lieu
tenant Noal assigned the Seventh to the
extreme northwestern end of the camp.
Colonel Berry's new homo in bounded by
A and 1< streets and by Fourth and Fifth
avenues. It is on a direct line with the
camp square, upon which General Otis
will establish his headquarters. In an
hour after their arrival the men had up
their tents and were working like beavers
to get everything in shape. The new camp
in some ra>pectfl is ahead of the Presidio,
but it also lacks some of the conveniences
th:it the soldiers had become accustomed
to at their first camp. Colonel Berry said
thai it would take :i day at Mast to get
his command settled down into their new
quarters and in working shape. Owing to
the limited space of the camp guard
mounting will have to be done in the
streets, while for drill ground the soldiers
will have to take a long march before
they can secure room enough to man
euver.
Death of Another Volunteer.
Henry Pruyett. a private in Company E
of the Seventh Regiment, from Southern
California, died yesterdsy in the hospital
at the Presidio. He contracted a cold af
ter arriving here, and despite the atten
tion of the physicians it developed into a
case oÂ£ pneumonia. Pruyett, who was
about 25 years of age, has relatives living
in San Bernardino County.

KANSAS VOLUNTEERS.
Loyal Ladies of California Pro-
vide Shoes and Clothes
for the Troops.
Tne Kansas volunteers now camped on
the old Bay District track have been
shamefully treated by the Government.
When they left their homes they believed
that they would be outfitted on reaching
this city. Through the red-tape measures
in vogue they found tv their disappoint
ment and discomfort on reaching here
that no provisions had been made for
them. Many of the men are now without
Bhlrts and shoes, and no one seems to
know when they will receive them from
Uncle Sam.
Mrs. F. A. Robbins of this city, Mrs. R.
Hickmott of Oakland. Miss Mabel Wat
kins, Miss Calla Hail, Miss Qeorgle Hick
mott and Miss Ella Garretson of Hay
wards visited the Kansas camp yesterday
morning, and to their surprise learned
that the men who save up their homes
and friends to fight for theirountry were
being treated with less consideration than
the average tramp. After leaving the
camp grounds they decided to appoint
themselves a committee to relieve the
moHt pressing needs of the volunteers.
They went direct to Koenlg'S shoe.store at
122 Kearny street and told of tho shoeless
men in camp. Six dozen pairs of shoes of
assorted siz-s were at once given them to
distribute among the men. This act of
kindness on the part of the Koenig Btaoe
store will be long remembered, noi alone
by the men directly benefited, but a
the ladles, v ho were so graciously treat
ed by the firm. The ladies then dn-w
upon their [private purses and purchased
a lot of woolen shirts and socks for the
men.
School Director Phil Hammond sent a
load <>r provisions to Camp Richmond
rday for the Kansas volunteers. Pi
rector Hammond will not forge: tie Kan
sas troops, as he was born in that State.
Tt is his Intention to send them some
thing to prove that, while he is now a
Callfornlan, lie has not forgotten his
birthplace.
The Nebraska volunteers received their
tirst pay yesterday since they have be* n
in the Bervice. They went into camp on
April 27 and were sworn in by the United
States Government on the 4th inst. The
officers and volunteers received eight
days' pay from the State.

i merce. Ban Franciscoâ telegram sent to
I Senator Perkins furnished me. The Subsist

I the markets in San Francisco had been en
tirely cleaned up, even borrowing- what the
I Alaska Commercial Company have loaned,
I through the kindness of Mr. Slow. This course
will be continued. EOAN.
-Commissary General. |
In speaking 'of this discrimination
i against Son Francisco by the Eastern
i merchants Oscar Lewis said:
The local factories have thus far been shut
out In the purchasing of these supplies. The
reason assign. ii was that the samples sub
mitted were screwed. It Is not supposed that
shoe manufacturers keep army shoes in stock
in large quantities for immediate delivery, as
demanded by the officials here. The complaint
in this matter is that since contracts have
been made the Eastern firms were allowed
time for manufacture of the goods, and local
bidders were shut out from competing for
these supplies. Considering that we have four
large factories here, fully equipped with the
most modern improved machinery and with
plenty of workmen ready to carry out con
tracts of any siae that the Government may
require, and guaranteed to he done as quickly
and of as good quality as they can be pur
chased anywhere in the United States, con
sidering the above facts. Is it not a little un
just, to Bay the least, that our coast manu
facturers should be discriminated against be
cause they seem to be so far removed from
the ear of the purchasing power of the Gov
ernment?
It is the Intention of this association to
solicit the co-operation of the Chamber
of Commerce, the Board of Trade and the
Merchants' Association in this matter and
control the Manila trade for this city and
coast, and especially that of supplying the
Government troops with everything neces
sary for their use. <â¢* â¢

WASHINGTON SOLDIERS.
Company D Receives a Silk
Flag From Admirers
in Seattle.
The volunteers from Washington, who
' are encamped In Fontana's warehouse,
at the foot of Van Ness avenue, are now
beginning to disbelieve in the old adage
that "patience is a virtue." Not a few
of them have exhausted their stock of
patience, and are beginning to grumble.
They have cause for complaint. When
they left their homes to come here they
were told that they would be fully
equipped upon their arrival. That promise
lias not been kept. Not a few of them
are now without shoes, and in conse
quence they arc unable to drill. They do

around in their stocking feet. The officers
in command believe, however, that the

CHANGE HEADQUARTERS.
Mejor-General Otis and Staff
Are Preparing to Move Out
to Camp Richmond.
General Otis, who since his arrival in
San Francisco, has had his office in the
Phelan building, will probably, establish
his headquarters to-day at Camp Rich
mond. The tents of himself and staff
will be located at the southwest corner
of the camp, close to the McAllister street
railway and within a short distance of
the park. As soon as it can be arranged
the headquarters of General Otis will
have not only telephone communication,
but also telegraphic connection. General
Otis has been very anxious from the very
first to have his headquarters in the field,
and now that he has got the first expedi
tion to the Philippines started he will be
able to make the move without much
further delay.
Regulars Wanted.

HONORS FOR THE FIRST.
A Graceful No*e of Thanks
From Colonel Smith to the
Governor.
The following letter was sent by Colonel
Smith to Governor Budd:
Headquarters First Regiment California
United States Volunteer Infantry, on board
City of Peking, May 24, 189 S.
James H. Budd, Governor State of Califor
nia: Permit me. by means of this, to acknowl
edge receipt of my commission as colonel of
the United States forces, which I have had the
honor to receive at your hands. To Bay that I
feel deeply grateful to you for the commission
which has ushered me into the United States
volunteer service hardly expresses my senti
ments, because in addition to the honor which
you have conferred upon me, you have conferred
which you have conferred, you have conferred
a very great honor upon the regiment which
I have the honor to command In the State serv
ice. Speaking for the entire regiment, both
officers and men, I tender you our sincere
thanks and heartfelt gratitude for the oppor
tunity which you have given us. The magnifi
cent manner in which yourself and the Ad
jutant-General of the State have devoted your
selves to the mobilization of the State forces
and the mustering of them into the service of
thÂ« United States ought to be and is a matter
of congratulation to all Callfornians.
With the disadvantage of receiving your or
ders and instructions from Washington by
mall, and the delay incident thereto, it could
hardly be expected that California would be the
first to mobilize and muster its forces. That
it did succeed Is due to your untiring efforts,
aided and assisted by your staff. Had you not
worked night and day, wo would probably not
have had the honor to be the first state in
the Union to send a regiment to a foreign
land to plant the flag of our common country.
Neither the regiment nor myself will ever
forget your earnest efforts in our behalf, nor
the labor which you have unselfishly shown for
the honor and credit of the State. I have the
honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient
servant *.:';â¢? JAMES F. SMITH.

Senor Sagasta has admitted, in the

scholastic differences, which in peace

"At this period of storm and stress,"
continued Senor Sagasta, "both are too

In reply to a question respecting the

NEW YORK, May 25.â Key West
dispatches assert that the Spanish spy
arrested there under the name of Jlm

attache of the Spanish legation at
Washington. He hud sixty maps and
plans of forts and mine fields on his
person. He will probably be shot.
KEY WEST, May 25.â The investiga
tion of the case of the suspected Span
ish spy, Komigro Seapatero Jiminez, a
passenger on the steamer Panama, was
continued to-day by tyhe Federal au
thorities, and brought out some new
facts. A search of Jiminez's effects re
vealed a cipher letter, which turned out
to he the key to fifty-nine charts of the
Atlantic Coast from Maine to Florida,
particular minuteness being shown as
to tho vicinity of Norfolk, New York,
Boston and Providence harbors and
the inlets around Tampa. All the Flor
ida keys and the Tortugas are also ex
plained in detail. A rigorous search
failed to locate the charts.
Jiminez swears that he was an en
gineer in the Spanish navy in Cuban
waters, but ran away in IS9O, since
which time he has lived in New York
at 77 Fourth avenue. An old sword
and a pair of new epaulets found in
his trunk, he said, were a part of his
equipment. Passengers on the Panama
say they recognize him as a lieutenant
of the Spanish navy.

MANILA BAY (via Hongkong),
May 25. â Arriving here yesterday on the
McCulloch, I found the American
squadron anchored off Cavite, except
one ship, which was patrolling out
side the bay. Foreign warshlpa
the Immortalite (English), the Bruix
(French), the Irene and Koermoran
(French)' the Irene and Koermoran
(German), and the Japanese Naniwa
and Akitsmshima, were anchored off the
city of Manila. The Naniwa had ar
rived the night before and at noon sa
luted the port with twenty-one guns,
which salute was returned by the shore
battery. This is the first salute the
Spanish flag has received from any
warships since the blockade was estab
lished. One Japanese vessel leaves to
morrow for Hongkong.
General Aguinaldo and twelve other
insurgents who came from Hongkong:
on the McCulloch were landed at Cavite
yesterday. They tell me the rebels have
taken possession of Sibig and have 30,
000 men ready to fight against the
Spaniards as soon as they can get arms.
A report was brought to the flagship
last night that the rebels had attacked
the Spanish outposts of Manila. The
Spaniards were found to have turned
the guns of their shore batteries land
ward for action against the Insurgents,
and the rebels made nothing more than
a roconnoissanoe in force.
It is reported that the lieutenant who
commanded the Callao, recently cap
tured, has been shot after a trial by
summary court-martial, and that Ad
miral Montijo has also been sentenced
by court-martial. These rumors come
through the crews of merchant vessels
still here, but I do not have much con
fidence in the accuracy of the reports.

LOCKED UP
No Fear Felt Over the Possible
Coming of Spanish Naval
Re=enf orcements.
Preparations to Soon Throw Immense
Bodies of Troops Into Cuba, Porto
Rico and the Philippines.
Call Office, Rigga House,
Washington, May 26.
Although the Navy Department still
refuses t<. make, public its advices from
the West Indies, bright faces and a
â¢ v air of buoyancy and exultation
at the 'lopan.iii.-nr tÂ«-il the story better
than words. Although Secretary IÂ»>nn
has Impi Bed a strict injunction i I
crecy upon his subordinates which
amounts to a censorship, th>- head of
the American n t quite able to
hide the whole truth himself, strive as
hard .-us h>- will. H<- Imparted to the
l< nt to-day two pieces of welcome
Intelligence:
First, that Admiral Cervera was. in
his opinion, bottled up in Santiago har
bor by "ur Iron-dads; and, second, that
the hig battle-ship Oregon has arrived
at Jupiter Inlet, Florida. In alluding to
tic- Spanish admiral's predicament the
tary fell easily Into newspaper
parlance and used the now hackneyed
expression, "bottled up."
To tin- pi â  gpondents Secretary
Long will not admit that he has any
official or definite knowledge of c<-r
vcra's w hereabouts, but expresses his
opinion as "based upon a general
knowledge of the situation in the West
Indies." As Secretary Long is not in
the habit of freely expressing his
opinion unreservedly and with such em
phasis, it cannot be doubted that he
la possessed of information showing
that we have the hostile fleet securely
locked up in Santiago harbor, where It
can do no harm.
With Th<* M;iriila fleet annihilated and
Cervera'a squadron imprisoned, two
thlrrls of Spain's navy is effectually
done away with. Hut what if Spain
should send over her reserve fleet, the
remnant of her boasted navy? If this
fleet should threaten our North Atlantic
<-<>ast cities would not our blockading
squadrons at Santiago or Havana have
to be withdrawn? These are questions
that many ask.
The best answer to them is- a state
ment made by a naval expert to The
Call '-orr^spondent to-high t:
"Two or three of our vessels are all
that Is needed to guard the Santiago
channel. I believâ¬ that the Oregon
could do It alone. The channel is ho
narrow that the vessels of Spain's
fleet must of necessity emerge one at
a time. The foremost could only bring
her bow guns into action, while the
mighty Oregon could pour a broadside
volley of solid shot and shell from her
Immense ten, twelve and thirteen inch
guns. The Spanish vessels could be
Bunk one by one, but it would only be
necessary to sink the first one that
showed herself. The channel is only
about thirty feet in depth at its mouth,
and one sunken vessel would block it
and prevent the egress of the others.
We need not fear Spain's reserve fleet.
Our flying squadron will still be a free
lance on the ocean, and can take care
of the Spaniards wherever they may
appear, and at the same time there
will be a powerful squadron left under
Sampson's command for the bombard
ment of Havana."
This Is the situation briefly expressed.
The President and Cabinet, being well
satisfied with the naval Situation, have
now turned their attention to the pro
ADVERTISEMENTS.

posed Cuban and Philippine mllitary

The President's determination to Is
sue another call for volunteers was
reached at yesterday's Cabinet meet
ing. In a few weeks our available mll

General Miles has finally been
sustained by the President and Cabi
net, and it is now believed that fully
ope hundred thousand men will be'sent
to < - 'jba, if necessary, twenty-five or
thirty-five thousand to the Philippines,
and at least twenty thousand to Porto
Rico.
It is certain that Porto Rico will be
invaded, the only question being
whether it will occur before, after or
simultaneously with the Cuban inva
sion. It is the general opinion here
that at least 2i.,000 troops will Immedi
ately be sent to Cuba, to be rapidly fol
lowed by other expeditions. Cuba will
probably be attended to first, for it is
well known by close friends of the
I'n-sident that since the discouraging
news received from Havana about the
deplorable condition of the surviving
reconcentrados he has been extremely
anxious to end this suffering by estab
lishing a base of operations and a sup
ply depot. He realizes that a landing
cannot be effected by a few soldiers,
and It Is quite likely that Instead of
sending to Porto Itico any of the troops
now mobilized at gulf points he will
dispatch them all to Cuba within a
very few days.
The thirty troop ships now at Tampa
have a carrying capacity of from twen
ty to twenty-five thousand men.
News that the Havana batteries are
being bombarded Is expected dally now,
for besides immediate relief to the
starving reconcentrados, if any now
survive, it 1b believed that the Havana
fortifications will be reduced before
Spain's reserve fleet can cross the At
lantic.
No credence !s given the reiterated
Madrid reports that Spain's reserve
fleet is destined for the Philippines.
The Increase of troops to be sent to
the Islands by this Government was
not actuated by a fear or this, or of
Spain's threat to send military rfin
forcements to the Governor-General.
But, as In the case of General Miles,
General Merritt's advice has been heed
ed. He is not willing to endanger the
lives of an inadequate force. Besides
our soldiers may have trouble In re
straining the rapacious natives, who
are, in truth, as much to be feared as
the Spanish soldiery. It is believed
that the Philippine expedition will fin
ally comprise .'ij.OOO men.
That the Cuban and the Philippine
forces are to be greatly Increased is
best indicated by to-day's call for 75.
000 more volunteers, when our availa
ble military force already comprises
203,000 soldiers.
California is to furnish 1942 more
men, under the call issued by the Pres
ident to-day, but whether they are to
bp assigned to the infantry, artillery or
cavalry arm of the service will be de
termined later, probably to-morrow, by
the War Department.

lest the fix turn and dash out of Pan
tiago, around the east end of Cuba,
up through the Windward Passage,
and north to attack the cities of the
Atlantic <\rast of the fritted States. In
all likelihood Commodore Rchley will be
able to spring the trap and then Rear
Admiral Sampson may hasten to San
tiago.
A great game Is being played and
the situation is one of extreme sus
pense. After Admiral Cervera Is sealed
in Santiago harboT, the problem will
be, as in the case of a "varmint" caught
in a trap, whether to shoot or starve
him. In any event, Admiral Cervera,
It is believed, cannot r..ach Havana.
Two powerful fleets, each having fast
vessels, as well as heavy ones, each
able to destroy him, are closing In upon
him.
SANTIAGO CUT OFF
FROM THE INTERIOR
Insurgents Surround the City and
Cervera Cables That Supplies
Are Scarce.
LONIIpN, May 26.â A special dis
patch from Madrid via Biarritz says:
There has. been an active exchange of
dispatches between the Government
and the authorities at Havana and
San Juan de Porto Rico on the subject
of sending coal and provisions to San
tiago de Cuba. It Is alleged that Ad
miral Cervera has wired confirming the
report that Santiago de Cuba Is cut off
from communication with the interior
by strong bands of Insurgents and that
in consequence coal and provisions are
getting scarce and dear.
PRESIDENT JORDAN AND
THE NEW CHARTER
XASMIN HOUSE,
Stanford University.
I believe that the chief
cause of the failure of mu
nicipal government in the
United States lies in the
conversion of the public
service into patronage to
be distributed among per
sonal favorites and parti
san workers. The pro
posed charter of San Fran
cisco perpetuates this con
dition of the distribution
of patronage by individuals
and cliques. It therefore
offers mighty little prom
ise of reform, either in ef
fectiveness or in economy.

SANTIAGO'S
WELCOME TO

Joyous Demonstration When Cer
vera's Warships Sailed Into
the H arDOr -
MADRID, May 25. â A dispatch has just been published giv
ing the details of the arrival of Admiral Cervera's squadron at
Santiago de Cuba. It says:
"At 8 o'clock on the morning of May 19, the Infanta Maria
Teresa entered the port of Santiago de Cuba, flying the flag of
Admiral Cervera. She was followed almost immediately by
the Vizcaya, the Almirante Oquendo, the Cristobal Colon and
the torpedo-boat destroyer Pluton. Shortly afterward the tor
pedo-boat destroyer Furor, which had been reconnoitering,
arrived.
"The inhabitants swarmed to the shores of the bay dis
playing the utmost joy and enthusiasm. All the vessels in the
port were dressed in gala array.
"On Sunday night there was an imposing demonstration
in honor of the officers and crews. The bands of the city
played patriotic airs; there were brilliant illuminations and
the people paraded the streets, singing patriotic songs.
"Admiral Cervera and his officers were given a banquet
at the Casino, where loyal toasts were honored. The principal
speeches were made by Admiral Cervera and Monsignor
Crespo, Archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, the latter of whom
exclaimed :
"'lt is not sufficient to be victorious on the seas; the
Spanish flag must float on the Capitol.'
"The squadron has re-victualed. Five vessels were in
front of the fort yesterday.
"It is believed that the American vessel Eagle has been
charged to cut the cables."
The dispatch is not dated.

City.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, May 25.â One of the pas
sengers on the Boston Fruit Company's
steamer Brookllne, that arrived In Bos
ton this morning from Port Antonio,
Jamaica, was Dr. Pulaaki F. Hyatt,
United States Consul at Santiago de
Cuba, Dr. Hyatt left Santiago de
Cuba on April 7. when the United States
Consuls were ordered out of Cuba by
the State Department and went to
Kingston, Jamaica. He has been on
the Island of Jamaica since.
Dr. Hyatt is the best posted man now
in this country on the g-eneral conditions
prevailing in Santiago and the char
acter of the place as a haven for the
Spanish fleet. He sums up his opinion
by saying that If the fleet Is really
there it Is in a "very tight jug."
"It will not take long to Btarve them
out," said Dr. Hyatt, "and they may
easily be destroyed if they try to come
out. Although the entrance of the har
bor of Santiago is narrow, the hills
high and the channel crooked, I am of
the opinion that great damage could
be done the Spanish ships by shells
from our fleet. The range from the
mouth of the harbor to the anchorage
the Spanish ships will take is about
four miles. The basin where they niu?t
lie is about two miles long, and the
whole harbor from the entrance to the
head is six miles long. The town is
five miles from the entrance of the
channel, on the right of the harbor,
and the anchorage is off the town.
"The channel leading to the Inner
harbor is so narrow that in places two
ships cannot pass abreast. This chan
nel was mined when I left there. I
Saw seven torpedoes at the mouth of
the channel off Morro. Others have
probably been placed there since. The
fortifications at the mouth of the har
bor could easily be knocked to pieces,
in my judgment. The Morro is old, and
built of masonry. I have never learned
that the guns were formidable. None
of the fortifications there mount heavy
guns."
Consul Hyatt has already forwarded
information concerning the fortifica
tions and other military defenses of
Santiago to the Government. The only
battery at the entrance of the channel
having any special elevation is the
Morro. This Is about 300 feet above the
water. The other batteries are near
the water's edge, and the two inside
Morro can get a range if the fleet keeps
to the right of Morro. There Is a new
battery opposite Morro, but not for
midable. A Bignal corps planted on the
hill could get the exact range of the
town and basin, and could direct the
fire from the fleet.
"I think there would be no trouble
In getting an elevation on the guns of
the ships sufficient to drop the shells
right on the decks of the Spanish fleet,"
eaid Mr. Hyatt.

"The war boys then seized the party.
Including Misses Hntfield, Archer and
Kent (Schenck), stripped them of their
clothing, dragged them back to the
mission house, in front of which the
war boys cut down Rev. Mr. Cain and
hacked him to death and then treated
Miss Archer and Miss Kent (Schenck)
in the same way.
"Miss Hatfleld, who was very 111, was
thrown on a barbed wire netting and
finally her throat was cut. Mrs. Cain
escaped to the bush with a native girl,
but the war boys went out seeking for
them and they were afterward killed."

TO NAVAL
SITUATION
Schley Has Locked Up
Spanish Squadron
at Santiago.
Will Reduce the Fortifica
tions, While Sampson
Bombards Havana.
NEW YORK, May 25.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
senda the following: Commodore Schley
still holds the key to the naval situa
tion in the West Indies. He has lock
ed up the Spanish squadron in the har
bor of Santiago de Cuba, and 1b under
orders to make as impossible as cir
cumstances will permit the escape of
any of the enemy's fleet by destroying
the enemy's fortifications, so that the
blockade may be sustained.
The examination of Santiago de
Cuba, which has been made by the Na
val War Board, has convinced it that
it Is absolutely necessary for Commo
dore Schley to destroy the batteries
protecting the channel so that he may
institute and maintain a thorough
blockade. It is not forgotten by the
authorities that besides the four arm
ored cruisers. Admiral Cervera has un
der his command two torpedo-boat de
stroyers. It is the peculiar work of
such craft to sneak out at night under
the cover of shore batteries and dis
charge a torpedo at an enemy's man
of-war. Fi r the protection of the
American ships it is necessary, there
fore, for Commodore Schley to destroy
the fortifications of Morro Castle and
Cimom-s Point, situated on the oppo
site shores of the channel. These for
tifications are on plateaus, whose sea
sides slope rapidly to the sea. Reports
show that Santiago is defended only by
half a dozen modern guns, the re
mainder being old smooth bores mount
ed on masonry fortifications. Pome
officers with whom I talked to-day sug
gested that the Spaniards had masked
batteries near the mouth of the chan
nel, but did not care to expose their
location by firing upon the St. Loufs.
Rear Admiral Sampson, with a strong
naval force, is lying off the north
coast of Cuba, prepared to bombard
Havana the moment the military in
vasion is commenced. Voluminous in
structions have been sent to Admiral
Sampson in care ot Commodore Remey
at Key West, but their purport is a
secret which the Xaval War Board de
clines to share with any other than the
President and Secretary Long.
As the Herald has stated. Secretary
I^ong has distributed the naval ships
which will be employed to convoy
troop ships to Cuba, and upon their.,
arrival at the point selected, they will
assist the vessels equipped with heav
ier guns to pave the way for the disem
barkation of the troops.
All that can be said with definiteness
concerning the point selected as the
landing place of the army is that it is
in the immediate vicinity of Havana.
General Blanco's military activity has
caused him to stretch telegraph wires
all along the coast, and this signal sys
tem if expected to notify him at once of
any attempt to land troops. It is there- i
fore expected that if General Blanco I
learns the destination of the American â 
army of invasion he will concentrate
his troops at that point. The authori
ties have not neglected the perfection
of their programme, which co-ntem
plates the drawing of General Blanco i
off on a false scent, and Admiral I
Sampson will be entrusted with the '
duty of carrying this into effect. He
will, of course, be charged with the pro- j
tection of troops while going ashore,
and furthermore, will be required to
commence the bombardment of Havana
as soon as the forward movement
against that city by American troops
commences.
ARTIFICIAL EYES WHICH

The event of the flay in the war situ
ation was the issuance of a proclama
tion by the President (jailing for 76,000
more volunteers. It added a new and
stirring phase to the lethargic condi
tions which have prevailed of late and
came with almost startling unexpected
ness, even to many of the high offi
cials in the army.
The proclamation means not only the j
assembling of a large force of troops,
but also the appointment of a number
of major-generals, brigadier-generals,
colonels, majors, staff and field offi
cers, for the organization of this addi
tional force of 75,000 men into army :
corps, divisions, brigades and regi- '
ments. The reasons leading up to the \
call naturally were sources of much i
conjecture, as it was at first felt that
the possibility of foreign complications
was a factor in bringing about this
new move. It speedily developed, how
ever, that the call was not due to any
latent or serious emergency, but was
rather in the line of getting together
a large body of men, to be drilled and
seasoned, and to constitute a second

MARTIAL LAW
BADLY NEEDED
State of Terror Exists
at Key West.
MANY CRIMES COMMITTED
TOWN OVERRUN BY TOUGH
CHARACTERS.
TJncle Sam Called Upon to Check the
Reign of Murder, Robbery
and General Law
lessness.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
KEY WEST, Fla., May 25, 10 a. m.â
Key West is suffering from a reign of
terror. Two murders were committed
during the night, and the best citizens
feel that unless the town is promptly
put uncirr martial law a state of riot
may prevail at any moment. The po
lice force consists of three men, and
â with streets and grog shops Infested
with turbulent jackies, negroes and
roughs of many classes, the danger to
the respectable classes is no mean one.
In consequence of last night's blood
shed Commander Forsythe has already
asked for a guard of twenty-five ma
rines to protect the naval station and
Government dock, and strong efforts
are being made by citizens to have
martial law declared.
While William Came, a seaman on
the auxiliary gunboat Morrlll, and I
Vladimir Ichnitski, a sailor of another
gunboat, were sitting in a Cuban eof- )
fee shop last night Charles Kitchen, a
local negro, approached, bearing a rifle
on his shoulder, and without a word
of warning he aimed it at the sailors
and fired. One shot struck the Russian
on the back of the neck, inflicting a
wound from which he died at the hospi
tal a few hours later. A second shot
grazed Carne's forehead, and as the
latter leaped to his feet the negro clos
(ed in on him and beat him on the head
vith the butt of his rifle until the stock
of the weapon broke, and the sailor lay
senseless. The people that witnessed
the affair made no attempt to Inter
fere and Kitchen escaped.
Sheriff Knight organized a posse and
â pent the night In pursuit of Kitchen, 1
reserve to be drawn upon later when
the campaigns were fully under way.
Secretary Alger stated that the deter
mination to Issue the call had not been
reached until late yesterday. The merits
of it have been canvassed more or less
for some weeks, but it was not until a
few hours before the call itself ap
peared that the move was finally de
cided upon.
Coining thus unexpectedly the "War
Department had made no preparations j
for executing the call and it will be
some days before the details are worked
out as to the quotas from each State,
the calls to the respective Governors
of States, the mustering points and the
general points of concentration. All
that is settled thus far Is that the en
listments are to be thrown open, much
as they were at the outbreak of the
Civil War, and are not to be restricted |
to the militia and National Guard or- I
ganizatlons of the several States. It
will be an encouragement to the organ- j
ization of Independent volunteer com- j
panics and regiment?. These will re
tain their identity to a certain extent j
as State troops, as the Governors will |
have the appointment of all company i
and regimental officers, while only the j
brigade, division, corps and staff offl- ,
cers will be- appointed by the Presi- j
dent.
He was found in a lot early this morn
inp, but dashed into a doorway, es
caped through the house and had not
been captured up to 10 o'clock. The di
rect cause of the shooting is uncertain,
but it is said to have been Kitchen's
jealously of his wife.
The victim of the second crime was
John J. Doraey, a reputable machinist,
of Manatee, Fla~, about 55 years of age.
He was fi/und dead early this morning
in a vacant lot near the Key West Ho
teL There were blood stains on his
iip;id and bruises on his face and neck.
Dorsey was a man of family and owned
an orange grove at Manatee. He re
cently came here and secured a Gov
ernment job. He was paid off yester
day, and, after paying his board bill,
hud seven or eight dollars in his posses
sion. After a lively drinking bout in a
tavern a fvvv yards from the lot where
his body was found Dorsey left the
place and was followed by C. Wallace,
and was followed by Charles Wallace,
a coachman, and leader of the "Bottle
Gang, " an organization of Key West
toughs. Nothing was seen of the two
men until the body was found this
morning with the money gone. Wal
lace was soon afterward arrested. The
employes of the hotel say that they
heard a shot, and a revolver with one
empty chamber was found on Wallace.
He denies any knowledge of the killing,
but he said to the Sheriff: "You need
not be afraid the old man was shot. He
was choked to death." An examination
of the body showed that this was prob
ably correct.
The municipal conditions here would
be classed as grotesque normally, to
say nothing of wartimes. How long
they have existed is a puzzle, but they
first became manifest soon after the ar
rival here of the troops of the colored
Twenty-fifth Infantry. One of the so-1
diers became involved in a shooting
affair on the street and was lodged in
the county Jail. Half an hour later a
body of companions, with rifles,
marched on the jail and forcibly liber
ated him, the Sheriff bf-ing powerless to
prevent them. Since then this harbor
has become the base of operations for
a number of free-and-<-asy saloons,
crowded night after night with "jack
ies" and rowdies of all classes. One
night this week a general fight occurred
in one of the taverns and no less than
four sailors suffered broken heads. The
impotent police force of three men saw
the whole affair, but of course could do
nothing. Within the past month three
so-called "peace guardians" have re
signed their office, complaining that
they have long been paid in city scrip
at the rate of $50 per month, which is
discounted one-half. A new trio of po
licemen were obtained and these now
show signs of rebellion, declaring they
will resign. Long before the war broke
out there had been much talk of mar
tial law for the town, but no steps to
this effect were taken. There is little
doubt now, however, that martial law
will soon be a fact.

DONE IN CALIFORNIA.
Pacific Coast Representatives Unable
to Restrain Their Enthusiasm
Over the Vessel's Per
formance,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, May 25.
Rather reluctantly the Navy Depart
: ment confirmed the report of the pres
ence of the Oregon at Jupiter Inlet,
Fla,, where she arrived last night. The
! reluctance is shown because the de
partment has decided it is a good pol
icy to keep the enemy in ignorance of
the whereabouts of our vessels. While
declining to give any details of the trip
at this time, the officials admit that the
ship swung clear to the eastward of both
the Lesser and Greater Antilles after
leaving Barbadoes, until she arrived at
, a point opposite the Bahamas, where
she turned sharply in and made for the
Florida coast.
The Oregon left Mare Island, Cal.,
13,000 miles away from Jupiter, on
March 19. so she has averaged 200 milea
a day for sixty-five days. As a matter
of fact, the vessel had a better speed,
for a good many days were lost in tak
ing coal at the South American ports.
The Pacific Coast contingent in
Washington cannot restrain their en
thusiasm over the remarkable per
formance of this creation of the slope
workshops. Representative Hilborn
called at the Navy Department to ver
ify the news of the ship's arrival, and
he found the officials were fully dis
posed to agree with him in all he had
to say as to the Oregon's great record.
He says that by this performance the
ship has silenced forever those Con
gressional critics of battle-ships who
declared that no battle-ship had
crossed or ever would cross the At
lantic, for the Oregon's run was fraught
with peril and involved "straightaway"
PROCLAMATION FOR
MORE VOLUNTEERS
WASHINGTON, May 25.â The President to-day
issued the following proclamation:
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
A PROCLAMATION.
WHEREAS, An act oF Congress was approved
on the 25th day of April, 1898, entitled "An act de
claring that war exists between the United States
oF America and the kingdom of Soain," and
Whereas, By an act oF Congress entitled "An
act to provide For temporarily increasing the mili
tary establishment oF the United States in time of
war, and For other purposes," approved April 22,
1898, the President isauthorized, in order to raise a
volunteerarmy, to issue his proclamation calling For
volunteers to serve in the army oF the United States.
Now, thereFore, I, William McKinley, President
oF the United States, by virtue oF the power vested
In me by the constitution and the laws, and deem
ing suFFicent occasion to exist, have thought Fit to
call Forth, and hereby do call Forth, volunteers to
the aggregate number oF 75,000 in addition to the
volunteers called Forth by my proclamation oF the
25th day oF April in the present year; the same to
be apportioned, as Far as practicable, among the

lantic passages in any season.
The location of the Oregon came
about in a.peculir way by means of the
beach watchers, who are on the alert
for the approach of hostile ships. These
beach patrols continue on duty night
and day, and last night the patrol .vas
rewarded by sighting the big American
battle-ship. Signaling was begun by
the use of torches, and in thU way
messages to and from the battle-ship
were exchanged through the night. In
turn these messages were sent to the
Navy Department, which is connected
by wire with the signal station near
Jupiter Inlet. The Oregon has not yet
sent the usual notice of her arrival. It
is the first time the new patrol system
has had an opportunity to show its
efficiency, not only in guarding against
the approach of hostile ships, but also
in reporting to the Navy Department
the movements of our own ships.

PRESIDENT JORDAN AND
THE NEW CHARTER
XASMIN HOUSE,

I believe that the chief
cause of the failure of mu
nicipal government in the
.United States lies in the
conversion of the public
service into patronage to
be distributed among per
sonal favorites and parti
san workers. The pro
posed charter of San Fran
cisco perpetuates this con
dition of the distribution
of patronage by individuals
and cliques. It therefore
offers mighty little prom
ise of reform, either in ef
fectiveness or in economy.

LEES PINES FOR MUSIC.
CHIEF OF POLICE LEES is a jewel after his
kind. On parade he glitters like a sunset. He
moves with the stately ponderousness of a
band-wagon. The braid upon him outvies the splen
dor of dawn. His horse steps high, and against the
flanks of the charger flaps and clatters the sword
which the Chief has benignly refrained from draw
ing. And yet, with all his grandeur, the Chief is not
happy. Being moved by concord of sweet sounds,
he pines for a drum and fife. The military spirit has
seized him. He would pass along the thoroughfare
not merely as a pleasing spectacle, but to the beat
and shrill of a Conquering Hero corps.
When this impulse first gat hold upon the Chief
he called to him his henchmen, Wittman and Spillane,
and bade them find who among their cohorts had
skill of melody, who could pelt the sheepskin or blow
the stuffing from the fife. Alas and alas! there was
none. Some could wield the club right well, and
others could sprint merrily from the place of peril,
but not a mother's son of the lot could be any part
of a drum corps. The Chief was in a state of despair,
wherein it is sard of him that he plucked his beard
and sputtered mightily. But he is welcome to any
suggestion embodied in these few remarks.
A drum corps is a necessity. Without it the Chief
may decline to be a joy forever. Therefore get a
drum corps. Let the Chief dismiss certain of his
minions, preferably such as run away when their ser
vice? are needed, and fill their place 9 with students
of the sounding drum and masters of the fife. Hav
ing dr>r,e thi>. he could continue to constitute himself
a thing <M beauty, and astride a steed trained to sniff
the battle from afr\r do a little sniffing himself. What
would be a parade without the Chief? Nothing.
Business should be suspended and the war stopped
until the Chief shall have a corps to summon the pop
ulace as he goes by. Denied the boon, he might re
sign, and such an act would be a menace to public
safety and health. Happiness has been known to kill.
(\ TREMENDOUS CHARTER BUG.
SECTION 14 of chapter 1. article VI of the pro
posed new charter, says: "All public work
authorized by the Supervisors to be done under
the supervision of the Board of Public Works shall,
unless otherwise determined by the Board of Public
Works, be done under written contract."
What does this mean? Do the words "unless other
wise determined" confer upon the board the legal
right to pave streets, build sewers and construct pub
lic buildings without competition? If they do they
constitute a charter joker of such enormous propor
tions as to actually paralyze the imagination. If
this Board of Public Works which is appointed by
the Mayor and which may be removed at pleasure,
and which is to consist of one Republican, one Dem
ocrat and one Populist, has been invested with the
power to order public work without letting contracts,
a vista of Tweedism is opened up before the people
of this city at once overwhelming in its possibilities.
Can it be possible that the Freeholders intended
this provision to be taken in its ordinary sense? If
they did they have certainly gone over to the cor
ruptionists body, bag and breeches. It was under a
similar discretionary power that Boss Tweed fleeced
the taxpayers of New York, and wherever discretion
to dispense with competition in prosecuting public
works has been conferred it has immediately led to
corruption and stealing.
If there were no other objectionable features in
ihe charter this one ought to defeat it. Taxpayers,
who are always made the victims of such careless
legislation as this, should go to the polls to-day and
vote solidly acainst the charter.
Marysville volunteers have dropped a traitor from
the rolls with such a thud as must ha\-e jarred his sys
tem. It is a bad season to be boasting of Spanish
blood as the only fighting kind, and the Marysville
person had been guilty of this error.
Once more there is a report that Alger may resign,
but he is naturally opposed to doing this, as he ex
presses it, "under fire." More than likely the report
is merely an indication that some correspondent
ought to resign.
Perhaps instead of ordering the police to procure
a different pattern of revolver it would be wise for the
Chief to compel them to learn to shoot with the style
they have.
Oregon has every reason to be proud of the boys
she sent on their way to Manila. A finer lot of men
never shouldered rifles.
If you want to see the Examiner's circulation go up
watch the smokestack of the crematory.
SPAIN AS AN ENEMY.
I"" HE tendency of some newspapers to underesti
mate Spain as a military enemy is unwise. We
are not making all this fues over whipping a
non-resistant cripple. Spain's navy is of considerable
force and her ships, if coaled and supplied with ammu
nition, can put up a stiff right. That her sailors can
! be depended on for desperate courage was proved at
I Manila. Dewey's victory was over men, not cowards.
j It detracts from his deserved credit and the glory of
I our arms to forget the brave fellows on the Spanish
; decks who fought to the last and went down with their
ships. Dewey himself recognized their fighting merit
! when he sent word to the Spanish admiral, Montijo,
i that he hoped to meet him some day as a brother sol
i dier and compliment him in person for his brave de
| fense of his fleet and flag.
Disparagement of an enemy is not found among
i the men who fight. It is a civilian vagary, and is a
; special form of expression adopted by the ink-valiant
fakers of the yellow press.
Circumstances and situations make this war one of
! the most formidable military undertakings since Na
poleon's march to Moscow. We can easily strip
Spain of her colonial possessions. They are lusterless
. jewels in her crown. But when that is done she will
i not make peace. An insolvent nation with the desper
i ation of her people for capital makes a formidable
! fight against the invader, and that we must end the
. war by invading the Spanish peninsula is among the
j high probabilities.
Occupation of the Philippines, Carolines. Ladrones.
j Cuba and Porto Rico, and probably the Canaries, will
call for an army of 150.000 men. They will have fought
their way to possession of these colonies. They will
! be seasoned soldiers, ready to be massed into an army
of invasion to enter Spain and treat the world to the
novel sensation of invasion of the oldest kingdom in
Europe by a force from the New World. The places
i of these trained veterans in garrison in the colonies
will be taken by an equal force of recruits.
In view of all this it will be seen that our enemy is
i not contemptible in resources or courage, and our
; honors will be hard won glory.
If the situation were reversed and Spain were the
I invader her weakness would be apparent. But we are
I the invaders and the Spanish are the invaded. The
' history of all military invasions is that the people who
' are defending their own soil have the advantage. Two
invading soldiers are required to match one who is
defending his country.
A little serious reflection will cure the errors that
have been spread by bumptious boasting by the fakers
and will justify the profound feeling that spreri-te
among the people as our volunteers go forth to battle.
THE POOT^ BOODLER.
THE Third Street Boodler (late of Mission
street) pathetically wonders who is paying for
the campaign that is being prosecuted against
the proposed new charter. The other day Dr. Stal
lard sent out a pamphlet. Who paid the postage on
it? excitedly asks the Boodler. John T. Doyle and
Garret McEnerney have written 'letters opposing the
adoption of the proposed charter. Who pays them?
yells the Boodler. Evidently the Boodler thinks
Colonel Mazuma has opened a "sack" without giving
it a call. If this is true it is quite sad.
But suppose somebody is paying for the arguments
being published against the charter? Its advocates
are doing the same thing. The prodigality which has
characterized the campaign of the latter has long
attracted our attention. We have refrained from men
tioning it because we think the Merchants' Associa
tion, the Freeholders and those who support the
charter have a right, equally shared by their fellow
citizens, to spend their money in any way they please.
The charter advocates have expended ten dollars to
every one so far expended by the opponents of the
instrument. An examination of the facts will show
this. Not only have they printed posters and posted
them upon election booths, but they have flooded the
city with circulars, distributed copies of the charter
and employed men to write for the papers. They
have even induced the Southern Pacific organ, the
Evening Post, to support the charter. Who paid for
that?
If the corporations have opened a sack it is too bad
that the Boodler has been overlooked. No such
tremors as now agitate it were suffered while it was
drawing $1000 a month from the Southern Pacific
under its "silence" contract. Nor did it then burn
up papers to increase its circulation. But the Boodler
should remember that all is not milk and honey in
this toilsome world. When the corporations used to
"see" it, it had a character. Since it became a bood
ling drab â a seeker after the dirty money of the slums
and an associate of thieves and blacklegs â the corpor
ations have no need of its service. Without either
character or influence â a yellow liar for coin and
with a declining circulation â there are none so poor
as to do it reverence.
' Last Monday while cur brave boys were marching
down Market street on their way to embark on the
Peking for Manila and their relatives and friends were
bidding them godspeed a vehicle resembling a scav
enger cart, filled to its utmost capacity with Exam
iners, forced its way along the crowded thorough
fare. It was the only incident that occurred during
the march that marred the patriotic scene. Half an
hour later the tall chimney on the crematory emitted
a huge volume of yellow smoke. The Examiner's
circulation was going up.
Upon reading that the Kansas regiment was in need
of underwear, an enterprising firm sent out yesterday
a lot of drummers, who tried to sell to the soldiers
articles the public would be glad and proud to have
the opportunity of furnishing. The success of these
peddlers was not learned, but they were not kicked
from the grounds, a circumstance showing that they
got along better than they deserved.
"A Glance at Real Estate" is the title over a local
article. Since the wim* has been blowing there 13 no

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL., THURSDAY, MAY 26, 1898.
ME SHOULD REFORM.
| ;OR the purpose of throwing dust in the eyes of
j the people the boodling Examiner declares that
the local corporations oppose the adoption of
the proposed charter. It says that Garret Mc-
Enerney, attorney for the Southern Pacific and
"shifty eight," has written a letter in which he gives
a number of reasons why the document should not
be carried at to-day's election. It does not contro
\ert these reasons nor attempt to answer them. It
places its demand for votes solely on the ground that
Mr. McEnerney is a corporation lawyer, and in
opposing the charter is commingling his civic with
his legal duties.
Perhaps it is true that Mr. McEnerney is a cor
poration attorney. It is his business to practice law
and he sometimes goes into court to maintain the
rights of corporations. Perhaps he did foil the at
tempt of the Phelan combination to get possession
of the government by ousting the "shifty eight" His
skill and ability may have been utilized by the Market
Street Railway Company or the Southern Pacific
in saving the property of these corporations from
loot and blackmail. So long a3 he works honestly
for those who employ him probably the corporations
will continue to avail themselves of his services.
But the public can forgive and forget all this in
Mr. McEnerney. There are, however, other things
he has done for which he can never be pardoned.
On two occasions he has saved the managing editor
of the Examiner from a just term of imprisonment in
jail. On several occasions he has employed his learn
ing and ability in preventing the owner of the yel
low sheet from being called to account for his libels.
For his work in making it safe to publish the Ex
aminer in this town and in keeping its staff of black
mailers out of jail the public will never forgive him.
All the rest may be forgotten and excused but this â
never.
As the dirty sheet, in order to subserve its black
mailing purposes, is now assailing the motives and
integrity of its own counsel, we trust that Mr. Mc-
Enerney will conclude to reform. Should he refuse
to defend it, in time perhaps Hearst could be brought
to book for his libels and the crew of blackmailers he
employs could be broken up. If the charter cam
paign accomplishes nothing more than to break the
liqk which attaches Mr. McEnerney to the business
interests of the Examiner it will have been well worth
all the trouble and expense it has caused.
THE WOR REVENUES.
WHEN the financial legislation of 1862 was
under discussion and after its adoption until
1868 the Democracy opyosed greenbacks with
the utmost bitterness. They made campaigns against
the "rag money" which the Government was com
pelled to issue because its credit fell below par and
the treasury ran dry in the last year of Buchanan's
administration. No Republican statesman of that day
contended that resort to greenbacks was justified, ex
cept by the discredit and Civil War which Lincoln's
administration inherited from its predecessor. Secre
tary Chase drew the legislation of 1862, but when he
became Chief Justice decided that it was not war
ranted by the constitution and had its sole excuse as
a war measure and the only means of financiering the
struggle to restore the Union.
Nothing can exceed the bitterness with which the
Democrats attacked the scheme. To them a green
back was a badge of discredit and dishonor. It was
'"Republican money," and it bore every epithet from
"rag baby" to "Lincoln scabs" in the mouths and the
press of that party. But when specie resumption was
prepared for the party suddenly turned its coat and
cry and came out for greenbacks. It ran Seymour
and Blair on a greenback platform in 1868, and ranted
and sang as loudly for that kind of currency as it had
formerly raved against it. In 1876 Tiiden succeeded
in pulling the party off this new scent and it kept
tolerably straight on finance until 1806, when free
silver and Populism set it crying again for "a more
and fittener currency," ami now it stands in Congress
for what it denounced in 1862, though the credit of
the country and the condition of the treasury require
no resort to doubtful measures.
In several Parliaments of Continental nations is a
party known as the Opportunists, whose member*
stand ready to take advantage of the mistakes and
weakness of other parties which profess principles
and go up and down with them.
The Democracy were against greenbacks in the
Civil War. when they had to be accepted as the al
ternative to a dissolution of the Union, and are for
greenbacks now wtfien the credit of the country does
not require their issue and when it would be a capital
and costly mistake.
The Democracy may be called "the Misopportun
ists." They are alway? loading their gun with spent
cartridges, hatching on last year's birdsnests, draw
ing water after the well is dry, sitting on the fence
and looking at the road after the procession has
passed, opposing Republican measures when they are
vital and necessary and favoring them when they are
obsolete. Tiiden and Cleveland compelled the party
to abstain from idiocy, to cease chewing its tongue
and having fits all over the floor, but it has cursed
and quit them and their works and '.s now dressing it
self for the next campaign in the cast-off gaments of
Republicanism, which it made fun of when they were
rew.
Some of the regular soldiers seem inclined to think
that in the present attention paid the volunteers they
are being overlooked, but this is not the case. The
finest compliment paid to the volunteers is when peo
ple say, "They march just like regulars." The only
reason for the apparent partiality is the knowledge
that Uncle Sam takes good care of his standing
army, while the new soldiers have been short on ra
tions, shelter and raiment. Once they are equipped
the distinction will vanish. Under the flag in foreign
lands they will all be "our boys."
If Jt is true that the captain of the Callao, who sur
rendered to the overwhelming force of Dewey, has
been shot by the Spaniards, one more task will be
added to that already cut out for the Americans. It
will be their duty to find what official ordered the
murder committed, and, backing him against a stone
wall before a file of marines, inculcate into his sys
tem better manners and plenty of lead.
Probably the rumor that Admiral Monti jo is to be
court-martialed is wholly baseless. It should not be
regarded as a crime for a soldier to fight. There are
times when to follow the Spanish fashion of running
away is not practicable.
Over at Sausalito a baker was rash enough to hur
rah for Spain and revile the stars arid stripes. It
will be some time now before he will be able to dis
tinguish the colors of one country from those of the
ether.
The Kansas boys have had every reason to com
plain and Lave not made a murmur. They are made
of the right stuff for soldiers.
AMERICA, THE NEW WORLD POWER.
We are identified with the civilized, interested in its problems, concerned in
its progress, injured in its disasters, helped by its prosperities. The time has
therefore passed when the United States can say, "We are sufficient unto our
selves; we will go our way; the rest of the world can go its way.' Tlve ques
tion is not, "Shall we avoid" entangling alliances?" We are entangled with all the
nations of the globe; by commerce, by manufactures, by race and religious affilia
tion? by popular and political sympa.aiee. The question for us to determine is
not whether we shall live and work in fellowship with European nations, but
wether we shall choose our fellowship with wise judgment and definite purpose,
or whether we shall allow ourselves to drift into such fellowships as political ac
cident or the changing incidents of human history may direct. I believe that
the time has come when we ought, as a nation, to recognize the fact that we are
not Merely an American nation but a world nation; when we ought to taKo oui
place, with clear and definite understanding that we arf doing so, among the na
tions of the wVld; when we ought to form clearly to ourselves our national pur
pose, and seek such affiliations as will promote that purpose. It is for this reason
I urge the establishment of a good understanding between the I nued States and
England, in the hope that in time It will grow to a more formal allianceâ civic,
commercial and industrial, rather than naval or militaryâ and yet an alliance
that will make us, for the purposes of our international life, one people, thouen
not politically one nation. ThÂ«Â»re are reasons which suggest the wisdoiri of tt.e
establishment and maintenance of nuch good understanding and the hope or
such possibly more formal alliance with our kin beyond the sea.â Rev. Lyman
Abbott, D.D., in the North American Review.
ANGLO-SAXON PARTNERS.
No sane person would propose that either of the English-speaking powers
should abate its genera! freedom of action, or should alter its internal govern
ment. The materials are ready tn hand for a perfectly simple and yet perfectly
effective entente. All that is required is that the responsible statesmen of Eng
land and America should arrive nt and should formulate a policy on which they
are agreed in those matters in which it concerns them to act together. â¢ â¢ â¢
This would mean, in plain language, that each partner of the Anglo-Saxon com
bination would safeguard the othor against the risk of being wiped out by a com
bination of the continental military powers.â "Politicus," in the Contemporary
Review, London.
AN IMPERIAL NATION.
The old Idea that the United States was esentla'ly pacific and could afford to
refrain from participating hi the haute politlque of the world must be abandoned
and a vigorous effort made to revive commerce which has been neglected under
the narrowing influences of the home market clubs, those nurseries of pettiness
in trade and politics. To be able to find sailors to man warships there must be a
great mercantile marine, and this Implies lower tariffs and more liberal trade
regulations. The oncc-gTeat ocean-carrying trade of the Union has to be re
created. President McKlnley stands at the parting of the ways; elected on a
narrow issue, that of the currency, and committed to the ultra conservative
classes, events have seized on him and have led him out to where, as from alofty
promontory overlooking the seas, he may discern the rising cloud of a European
coalition against the great republic whose astounding growth and multiplying
wealth have excited the bitter and undisguised hatred of the old world. Europe
Is menaced on one side by huge and youthful Russia advancing eastward to the
coveted Oriental field of trade, and on the other by the American Union, which
bt came a great and imperial nation when Jefferson, in a moment of patriotic in
spiration, threw his constitutional scruples to the winds and bought the Louisiana
Territory of Napoleon. McKlnley .can emerge from this borrasca a statr-sman or
a i>olitical pigmy. The President who conducts successfully a foreign war, who
creates a great navy and lays the foundation for a strong army, and is something
of a Caesar, appealing to the masses over the heads of the politicians, can in
augurate a new and splendid American policy and rale* his country' to the highest
place in international affairs. Will Mr. McKlnley do this or will he remain the
representative of the trusts and of narrowing commercial interests generally?â
Mexican Herald (City of Mexico.)
If the United States triumphs over Spain there w!ll have sounded for us the
knell of our autonomy. Masters of the Gulf, of Hawaii (feloniously appropri
ated), and of our own Alsace-Lorraine (Texas), her ambition and aspirations will
know no end. Passing the canal which divides the island of Cuba and Yucatan
she will there install herself through a spirit of conquest thinly masked by all
the hyprocrisles of diplomacy. Already by infiltration has she occupied large sec
tions of our northern frontier. We see the Americans, like phylloxera, appear
ing in every section of our capital. They have acquired such control over our
commerce and industrial interests that financially they have us bound both hands
and feet. Their politicians, even when defeated in their aspirations, are received
here like princes. They are adulated by provincial orators who tell them that
neither Cicero, Mlraheau nor Castelar, in his orations from the people's tribunal,
reached so high a place in the fire and energy of public speech, nough of this
sort of adulation: The Yankees have shown us what they are. Their vandalism
in California, their deceptions in Alaska, all show that they are affected with
the lunacy of King Midasâ gold, always gold! Their demoeracv is only a shame
less market, measured by the Dlngley tariff. Their International politics, docile
to so much per cent, shows all the Carthaginian malice and felony. Washington
advised and begged them, almost in his will, to be true and just in their rela
tions with other people, but they, subject to the laws of heredity, intercept and
practice in British style the rights of man. It should not be forgotten that John
Bull is the grandfather of Uncle Sam.â Vox de Mexico.
THE MISSION OF AMERICA.
Over and over again a new race (or a race born anew as it seems) has a "mls
rton," or Is aware of a "destiny," to overrun, to subdue, to destroy and replace;
and sets out to do so aa If by uncontrollable Impulse. Historians noted these
movements long ago, finding: them "mysterious." Mysterious or not, we do not
come to the end of them. If we want to know why the world is so mightily dis
turbed at this hour and why we are thrown back so unexpectedly upon the
regime of force, all we have to do is to mark with a confessing eye that one
su'-h movement is in full progress, and that another, and perhaps yet another in a
somewhat different guise, has begun. Unless all the signs deceive the American
republic breaks from her old moorings and sails ont to be a "world-power."
Whether the start has been well made, with .sagacity, with dignity, with due cir
cumspection and preparedness against internal disturbance, for example, is for
the Americana to consider. For our part we must acknowledge that the move
ment is perfectly natural. If not "mysteriously" Imperative, and also entirely their
affair. And then, taking account of another illustration of the way in which
history repeats itÃelf, with so little modification by "moral forces." we must
Bhape our conduct accordingly.â "The Looker On" in Blackwood's, Edinburgh.
COMPLICATIONS MAY ARISE
Conquests are sometimes embarrassing, and there are already signs that the
people of the United States hardly know what to do with the Philippines. In
numerable solutions of this grave problem are put forward. A very small party
is for holding them; others, again, are for selling them to a friendly power;
while many go further, and name the friendly power â England. The Philippines
are to be offered to England to cement the Anglo-Saxon alliance; and in exchange
we are to give the Americans a base at Manila or else certain of our West In
dies colonies. We cannot but feel /attered as a nation by this fresh proof of
friendship from the people of the United States. The mere suggestion shows that
they trust us implicitly. But the trouble is that we do not want tho Philippines.
In view of our daily increasing empire in Africa and of our obligations in China,
we shall do well to avoid unduly stretching the bow. Under these circumstances
there are three solutions which suggest themselves. Either the United States
should continue to hold these islands or should sell them to Japan â a state
friendiy both to the United States and to ourselvesâ or again they should be re
stored to Spain in exchange for Cuba. We could not with equanimity see one of
the great military powers of Europeâ Russia or Germanyâ established there. We
are an Australasian as well as an Asiatic state, and we are therefore most deeply
interested in the future of Malaysia. But the Philippines are likely to prove a
new apple of discord; and there are possibilities of European intervention which
British and American statesmen will do well to consider and prepare to meet.â

AS SPAIN SEES US.
Some Highly Interesting and Enter
taining Extracts From Madrid
Newspapers.
(From the Mexican Herald.)
Spain has some yellow journals
which could give New York papers
odds and then win. Here is an ex
tract from El Diario de Madrid intend-
Ed to fire the Iberian heart:
The scene in the plaza was one of
frightful slaughter. The brave Spaniards,
to the number of about 200, with their
beautiful wives and children, made a
stand in the public square near the ca
thedral fountain. On every side the
Yankee devils closed in. Cannons were
brought forward, and soldiers aimed their
muskets. At the signal the guns explod
ed, and the valiant victims fell writhing
in death agony. The soldiers then bay
oneted the wounded until they died. The
square ran with Spain's best blood.
This is hair-raising indeed, and think
what an idea the Spanish people must
be receiving of their foe!
A few pointers on the physical geog
raphy of the United States from El
Pais make interesting reading:
The country is not flt to live In. The
climate is execrable. When it is not sleet
ing or snowing the heat is almost un
bearable. Avalanches are frequent at all
times, and these threaten the principal
ctties. As for the people, besides the few
whites engaged In business along the
Eastern coast, the remainder of the coun
try is one vast plain, covered with In
dians, called cowboys, and great herds of
roaming cattle.
One asks himself if It is quite worth
â¢while to teach people to read if they
are to be intellectually fed on such
awful rubbish.
More "Geografia" from the leading
paper, El Heraldo:
All the troops of the Yankees are in the
far Western part of the country, many
thousand miles from the Atlantic Coast.
There are only a few thousand men, all
told, and they are ill paid and ill fed, and
not willing to flirht. To utilize this force
it will be necessary to bring it to the
Eastern sea.board. There is but one rail
way by which it can be transported, and
that is an old and poorly constructed af
fair. At onÂ« place this railroad passes
over Niagara Falls, a cataract 1000 feet
high, near Labrador. At last accounts
the bridge at this place was in a very
dangerous condition. It need surprise no
one to learn that some agency his made
it still more so. It would serve the hate
ful pigs of Yankees right if their miser
able army was thus drowned.
The Imparcial, a little four-page pa
per which compares itself to the Lon
don Times, drops into history and
shows how Fitxhugh Lee is the "mismo
Lee" who surrendered after the Civil
War to ""General Lincoln."
An Havana telegram to the Impar
cial imparts this precious Information:
Word has just been received here that
the Indians are rising against the Yan
kees in Illinois, Ohio and other places.
The fanners are petitioning the Govern
ment to protect them from the blood
thirsty savÂ»gÂ«Â». who are burning houses
and killing on every side. Troops are
asked for at Colorado, in the State of
Denver, and at St. Louis, in Missipa.
That the Americans are vegetarians
ALARM IN MEXICO.
and therefore physically weak Is al
leged by El Diario, which says:
The average height among the Ameri
icans is five feet two, axid they have
never produced an athlete. This is due
to their living almost entirely upon vege
tables, as they ship all their beef out of
the country, so eager are they to make
money. There is no doubt that one full
grown Spaniard can defeat any three
men in America.

WATER SUPPLYâ M. K. T., City.
Then Is no record of who originated the
idea of water supply or water works. In
the earliest records of civilization are ac
counts of the digging 1 of wells and of
quarrels about the possession of them.
The "Pools of Solomon," near Bethlehem,
which remain now almost as perfect as
when built, were connected with a
scheme for supplying Jerusalem with
water. In Assyria and Persia, from the
earliest times water has been conveyed
to towns from gTeat distances In open
channels or canals and In subterranean
tunnels or kanats. In Egypt also, and
In China, gigantic works for conveying
water both for domestic use and for irri
gation havo been in existence from re
mote antiquity.
CRIMEAN WARâ M. R. and others,
City. Without an examination of the offi
cial records of the Beveral countries en
gaged in the Crimean war of 1554 and 1855
it is impossible to answer the question
"How many men were engaged in the Cri
mean war; that is, how many men were
furnished by the Russians, FrÂ«nch, Sar
dinians, the German division in the Eng
lish array, and the number of English,
Irish and Scotch engaged in the war?"'
Published statistics as to the number
furnished by each nation are not only
incomplete, but very unsatisfactory, as
with the exception of France It is not
possible to prepare an aggregate. The
French contingent was 309,268. The losses
by the allies in round numbers were:
France 80,000, England 22,000. Italy 2200 and
Turkey 30.000. Russian loss from all
causes, 90,000.
GENERAL AND LIEUTENANTâ G. F.
W., City. The highest rank in the army
of the United States was general. It was
created for George Washington March 3,
1799, and it was abolished in 18u2- It was
revived in 1866 for U. S. Grant. He was
succeeded in that position by \V. T. Sher
man. On the retirement of Sherman No
vember 1, ISS3, the rank again became ex
tinct. It was revived for a short time â
from June to August, 1888 â for Lieutenant-
General Phil Sheridan, and since his death
in that year it had been vacant.
The office of lieutenant-general was first
created for Washington in 1798, and was
abolished the folowing year. It was re
vivt-i in 1555 for Winfleld Scott. Ir.
Grant was appointed to that grade, and
when he was appointed general the rank
went to Sherman. In 1881 Sheridan was
appointed to that rank, and it has not
been filled since Sheridan was appointed
general in 18S8.
THE ARMYâ H. L. H., City. Before
the present war the strength of the regu
lar army of the United States was. aa
per reports of the 30th of June. 1897, 10
repiments of cavalry, 447 officers. 6010
enlisted men; 5 regiments of artilier;
officers. 3934 enlisted men: 25 regiments
of infantry, 910 officers, UJTI enlisted
men; engineer battalion, recruiting par
ties, ordnance department, hospital serv-.
ice, Indian scouts, signal and general
â¢ â¢ ::.J officers ana 25^ enlisted men;
making an aggregate of 2179 ofilct-rs and
â¢â nlisted men, making a grand total
i 532. Since the war there has been
added two regiments of artillery. Tho
I'nited States are divided into eight mili
tary departments: Th*Â» East, Missouri,
California and N'erada. Dakota.Texas. the
Colorado and the Columbia. The
rank in the army is major-general, briga

Venezuela's Proclamation of Impor
tance Because of the Opera
tions of Cervera's
Fleet.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Rlggs House,
Washington, May 25.
Tne consular reports give notice of
the declaration of neutrality by (ivo
countriesâ Russia, Greece, Venezuela,
th^ Netherlands and Canada. Particu
lar importance attaches to the declara
tion by Venezuela, beoauee her ports
would be of great value to the Spanish
as places of refuge and ;:s possible coal
supplies in the event that the declara
tion of neutrality was withheld. The
notice is dated Caracas, April 29. The
Minister of Foreign Affairs took action
on the day upon which he was notified
by Minister Loomis that the United
States had declared war. The notifica
tion does not go into details ;;s to the
rules of neutrality to be applied by
Venezuela, nor deal with tho question
as to whether coal is to be a contra
band or not. It expresses Venezuela's
position in the one sentence:
"The republic win preserve the strict
est neutrality during the contest."
The Dutch proclamation of neutral
ity, in addition to the usual forms, cau- i
tlotis all citizens of rhe Netherlands ;
from becoming in any way involved in i
privateering, and they are also en- i
Joined to respect the blockades. Touch- I
Ing the coal supply, the Dutch regula- :
ti.->n is that this shall be supplemented
only to the extent necessary to permit
the ship to reach the nearest port of j
the country to which it belongs, or that '
of one of its allies in the war. Being- ;
erents are forbidden to bring prizes into
the Netherlands waters.
The Canadian piSclamation is in the '
same terms as that of Great Britain ;
except as to the preamble.
The Russian declaration has one im- i
portant statement not usual in such i
cases, as follows:
"The disagreements which have re
cently arisen between Spain and the
United States of America have induced
the Imperial Government to seek, in
concert with the other powers, some
means which might prevent an armed
conflict between those two countries.
Unhappily, our friendly measures are
without results and a state of war now
exists between Spain and the United
States. It is with ko>-n regret that the
Imperial Government witnesses an
armed conflict between two states to
which it is united by old friendship and
deep sympathy. It Is firmly resolved
to observe with regard to the two bel
ligerents a firm and impartial neutral-
ity."
The Grecian declaration is contained
in a line stating that the strictest neu
trality will be maintained.
Taxpayers, do not be
deceived by the cry that
the charter is being op
posed by the corporations.
That- is a campaign lie, in
vented by the men who are
trying to fasten a Czar
Mayor upon the city in or
der that they may rule it.
Read the charter and vote
against it.

How Mayor Phelan Ignored the
Small Property-Holders.
It is apparent that in the selection
of the Committee of One Hundred
Mayor Phelan took advantage of his
authority to select such men as were
not antagonistic to the idea of framing
;i fundamental law that would be to
the advantage of the wealthier classes
ami to the detriment of the small land
owner. The charter as it now stands
has for its dominant feature the grant-
Ing of authority to issue bonds that will
be a perpetual tax on the land owner
of moderate means whose fortune does
n<<\ permit him to derive the benefits
That will accrue to the aristocratic
bondholder.

The majority of the property holders
in these districts are opposed to an
aristocratic government such as Is con
templated by the proposed charter, and
it may be that it was a knowledge of
this fact that actuated the Mayor in
refusing to give the district proper rep
resentation.
TWO PUGILISTIC
CONTESTS ARRANGED

NEW YORK, May 25. â Tom
O'Rourke, manager and match-maker
of the Lenox Athletic Club of Uiis city,
succeeded to-day in obtaining two first
class boxing contests for his club. He
expected to match "Kid" McCoy and
Ji>e Goddard, but instead he has ob

Choynski for a twenty-five round bout,
the incentive being a purse of $10,000.
The contest will take place at the
Lenox Athletic Club on Monday, June
27, and the men will begin training im
mediately.
In addition to this O'Rourke has ar
ranged a twenty-five round contest be
tween Joe Goddard and Peter Maher

ON THE WAR
Says America Should
Not Hold Cuba.
IT WOULD BE COWARDLY
OURS A WAR OF MERCY, NOT
OF CONQUEST.
National Policy Discussed in His
Annual Address to the Grad
uates of Stanford Uni
versity.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERS: iT.May 25.â
With the conferring of degrees to
day the exercises of commencement
week came to a clor \ The degree of
bachelor of arts was conferred on 161
students. Ten degrees of master of arts
and two of dcct-- of philosophy were
given.
The feature of the day was the an
nual address by President Jordan, in
which he dwelt upon the war with
; Spain and held that this nation should
! not hold conquered territory. Dr. Jor
dan sa-id:
With you and such as you lies the so
| lution of the problems in the century to
j come. This is my Justification in speak-
I ing to you of the problems of the day.
For this year of IS9B marks one great
crisis in out national life. Its stern de
mands are on us, though we be yet un
conscious. Before wo realize the Im
portance of the choice, the hour for
choosing shall have passed. Twice before
in the history of our republic has a great
crisis come to us, and each time In the
past has our choice been a wise one.
The first crisis followed the War of the
Revolution. Its question was this:
! What relation shall the emancipated
I colonies bear to one another? The answer
was the American constitution, the fed
eration <U self-government and united
states. The second crisis came through
the growth of slavery. The union of the
States could not endure, half slave, half
! free.
The third great crisis is on us now
The war with Spain is only a part of it
|an Incident in the great movement. The
question is not, Can we capture Manila ,
Havana, I'orto Rico or the Canaries? It
is not what we take or what we hold.
j The American navy and the American
, army can accomplish all we ask of them
j with time and patience.
Hattles are foug-ht to-day through en
| gineering and technical skill, not through I
I personal fearlessness and dash. The
great cannon speaks the language of ;
science and individual courage is help
less before it. The standing of our navai j
officers In matters of engineering is be- j
join: question. They are all abreast of the !
times. There are a hundred nameless
lieutenants in our warships alone who. if
opportunity offered, could write their
names beside those of Grenville and
Nelson and Farragut arid Dewey. The!
glory of Manila is not dim before that
of Mobile eriU. Trafalgar.
The cool strength and soberness of
lankee courage added to the power of
naval engineering could meet any foe on
earth on equal terms, and here the terms
are not equal. Personal fearlessness our
adversaries possess, and that is all they
have. That we have in like measure.
Everything else is on our side. We train
our guns against the empty shell of a I
medieval monarchy, broken, corrupt
\\ nether we are right or wrong in our
main contention we cannot fail to win.
It is too late now to ask how we got
into the war. Was it Inevitable? Was it
wise? Was it righteous? No need to iisk
these questions, because the answers will
not help us. We have our doubts as to
one or all of these, but all doubts we
must keep to ourselves. We are in the
midst of battle and must fight to the end.
ThÂ« crisis comes when fhe war is over, i
What then? Our question is not "What
will we do with Cuba, Porto Rico and the I
Philippines?" It is, "What will these
prizes do to us?" Can we let go of th*m
in honor or in safety? If not, what if we
hold them? What will be the reflex effect
of great victories, suddenly realized
strength, the patronizing applause, the
ill-concealed envy of great nations, the
conquest of strange territory', the raising '
of our flag beyond the seas? All this is
new to us. It is un-American; It is con
trary to our traditions; it is delicious; it
is intoxicating.
After speaking on the minor results
! of the war Dr. Jordan referred to the
| retention of the territory which we
! will capture and in answer to the ques
; tion: 'Why shall we not hold Cuba If
i she becomes ours by conquest Â°" he
| said:
Because that would be a cowardly thing
1 to do. The Justification of her capture
is that we do not want her. It we want
I Cuba, common decency says we must let
her .tlone. Ourq is a war of mercy, not
'of conquest. This we have plainly de
clared to all nationÃ, and we meant what
we said. If we retire with clean hands It
: must be because our hands are empty. To
I keep Cuba would be to do as nations have
j done in the p;ust â perhaps, a.s England
would do If she were in our place.
Dr. Jordan spoke of the changing
policy of the Government since "Wash
ington's message and said:
The America of which Washington
! dreamed should grow strong within her
; Belf, should avoid entangling alliances
with foreign nations, should keep out of
i all fights and all friendships that are not
her own. If a different policy 1r pursued
our Government must be changed for our
changing needs. We must give up the
i checks and balances in our constitution.
'â  If we are to deal with the crises in for
! elgn affairs we must meet them not as
jwe have met the Cuban question. We
! cannot move accurately and quickly un
; der the joint leadership of a conservative
; and level-headed President, a hysterical
I or venal Senate and a House Intent on
: its own re-election.
Professor Walter Miller delivered the
i commencement address, entitled "The
i Old and the New." He said In part:
The land in which we live is called "the
i New World," and our individual lot Is
i cast In the newest part of it. The prob
:.- 1 , i r-- â educational as well as politicalâ
which our country has had to face are,
many of them, new. We have grown up
as far as we have grown, under the stim
i ulus of conditions all our own. We have
i been bound by no distant past nor ham
| pered by the traditions of the land from
which our fathers came. Most of our
i short national life has so far been an ex
! poriment. What the experiment will prove
I will be known when our young Western ]
I world has grown to age. In tne mean- i
I time all the civilized world is watching !
I with eager eyes each new stage of our ex- ,
! perimenting.
In our present state wÂ© are generally ,
j accused of being a nation of mediocrity,
except in bulk. One century has seen us
suddenly transformed from 3,000,000 sub
ject colonists on the Atlantic seaboard
into a nation of 60,000,000 sovereign citl
sens, whose dominion reaches from ocean
to ocean. Similarly, our culture is full ,
grown but Immature, like a boy of sixteen
six feet tall.
The like of our system (or want of sys- '
tern) of education was never seen nor I
dreamed of before. Our grammar school
may find its counterpart in the Old
World; but our American high school is
neither the English grammar school nor |
the German gymnasium nor the French
lycee. Our American college may be tne !
outgrowth of the Oxford and Cambridge I
idea further developed, but the American i
university is not the English university
nor the German university. It is a mixed i
product grown under new conditions on J
new soil.
Professor Miller called our present
system with its 481 colleges and uni
versities a development with the vari
ous additions and other changes that
come with growth out of the education i
of past ages. Our whole r..odern civili
zation he spoke of as but a gTaft, and .
said that the ster- 1 when followed down
would show the roots deep In the sacred j
soil of Greece and Lome. In reference
to the former he said:
The art of Greece has been the Inspira
tion, the wonder and the despair of all ar
tists since the day when the lofty spirit of
Hellenic greatness began to flag. Teat
age saw, in at. least some stratum of so
ciety, man at his highest and best since
his creation, both mentally and physical
ly. And so it is our right and duty to ask
how that condition was realized, and why
we, with the exnmple of their successes
and their failures, and with the addition
of the spirit that was Introduced by way
of Bethlehem and Calvary, cannot attain
that, and better than that, by the addi
tion of the moral and spiritual strength
that is ours from on high.
He said the . roblems that the young
Athenians of brains and power had to
face were not so vei-- different from
those which confront t*Â« : oung Ameri
can. Their polity, he asserted, was as
ours is called, a democracy â a govern
ment of the people by the people. Their
youth must therefore have been fitted
(and so must oura) not only for good
citizenship, but for the highest duties
of citizens, who are also rulers. He
presented the main features of the
Athenian education, emphasizing their
love of the beautiful and showing that
a broad foundation was the only one
on which one could build well. In con
clusion he remarked:
You have yor.r life problems to face
not alone these literary, intellectual and
educational problems, the proper solution
of which will raise us above the present
hopeful level of Philistine vulgarity â¢which
we are accused of occupying, and make
us leaders of the world In things of pure
intellect as well as in lines of mechanical
application of scientific principles. This is
yours to bring about; but you have also
.iupt as serious social, economic and polit
ical problems, and the world looks to you
to solve thorn. The question of finance
must bo answered by college men; the re
lation of capita! to labor, the question of
trusts, of marriage nnd divorce, and of
the reform of municipal government, the
annihilation of that worst enemy of edu
cation and morals, that legalized destroyer
of men and property â the saloon. These
are grave problems which call for the ap
plication of the best minds and strongest
characters our colleges can develop.
PRESIDENT JORDAN AND
THE NEW CHARTER
XASMiN HOUSE,
Stanford University.
I believe that the chief
cause of the failure of mu
nicipal government in the
United States lies in the
conversion of the public
service into patronage to
be distributed among per
sonal favorites and parti
san workers. The pro
posed charter of San Fran
cisco perpetuates this con
dition of the distribution
of patronage by individuals
and cliques. It therefore
offers mighty little prom
ise of reform, either in ef
fectiveness or in economy.

COMPANY G VICTORIOUS.
Recognized as the Most Efficient in the League of the Cross
Will Retain the Montgomery Trophy.
Before an enthusiastic and wildly cheering crowd in Mechanics' Pavi
lion the Montgomery trophy was Tuesday night presented to Company G,
I-eague of the Cross Cadets, "to have and to hold." This medal has al
ready been awarded twice to Company G, and the company winning- three
successive times is privileged to keep it.
The exercises opened with an overture by the L,eagne of the Cross band,
which has improved wonderfully since its organization. This was follower,
by several other selections, amonp which wns a descriptive piece, entitled
"The Cavalry Charge." At the close of this the band struck up a lively
inarch and the regiment made Its entry, when it was reviewed by Generals
Merrh'm and YVarficlrt, who complimented the boys warmly on their fine ap
jk.nance. The colors of the regiment were draped in black, and each offi
cer wore a bunch of black crape on his saber in memory of Sergeant McCar
thy, formerly lieutenant of Company O, who died at the Presidio Sunday.
Colonel Sullivan announced that the companies to take part in the drill
would be G, D, A and H in the order named.
Company G, resplendent in new uniforms, appeared first. The boys loolrod
a little nervous, but on their facÂ°s was the stamp of energy and determina
tion, which in all probability accounts for their success. The work was
clean cut, without a flaw or a break, and from the start thÂ»>re was little
doubt that they would be the winners. Captain E. J. Powers gave his
orders in clear tones, and the company obeyed as one man. The other
companies followed in order, and while there were no bad "breaks" tha ap
pearance was poorer, owing to a numher of petty flaws. Company A made
a first-class appearance and pushed G very hard. The judges were Cap
tains George H. Gale of the Fourth United States Cavalry and T. J. Hay of
the United States Volunteers.
The hospital corps under Major J. G. Morrissey grave an exhibition drill
which showed it to be well up in its work. The entire regiment then ap
peared on parade under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas F. Ryan
and formed in a cordon two deep around the building aa the announcement
of the winning company was made, and Archbishop Riordan presented the
medal.

Citizen of Sheep Camp
Shot Down.

ATTACKED FOR DENOUNCING
GAMBLERS.
Declared That Government Officials
Were in League With Knights

Cloth.
Special Dispatch to Tha CaJl.
DTEA, May 20 (viu Nanalmn, May 25).
â On Saturday W. F. Gregg, an auc
tioneer of Sheep Camp came down to
Dyea as a delegate from that town to
the Dyea Chamber of Commerce to in
sist upon police protection. He boldly
stated that three shell men and gamb
lers were having everything their own
way and charged that a United States
Commissioner and a United States
Deputy Marshal had been standing In
with them. For this he was waylaid
here and mortally wounded and he will
probably die before morning.
Mr. Gregg has several times boldly
spoken his mind about these gentlemen
who toll not. On Tuesday he had a
tent to move. Some men lounging- about
a saloon asked him what he would pay.
He offered 50 cents an hour and they
Jeered at him. He got other men to
move the tent and when coming back
with it they rushed at him and took
his revolver from him and also hla tent.
He went after another revolver and the
ijroup of gamblers scattered.
At 5 o'clock this morning one of the
gang, Patrick Malone, brandished a re
volver In f-ont of Gregg's cabin and as
Gregrg did not come out he fired through
the door. Gregg fired back and when
five shots had been exchanged Malone's
friends took him away. Gregg was
found to be mortally wounded. There
Is now no Marshal at Dyea and Ma
lone, offering to give himself up, one
had to be sworn in by telephone from
Skagruay.
The sun yesterday uncovered two
more bodies in the great snow slide at
the Scales. They were found just as a
Mr. Patterson of Tacoma, friend of the
two victims, reached there to search
for them. They were the bodies of A.
H. Coming and R. B. I.aughlin of Ta
coma. Their outfits have been un
claimed on the summit since the slide,
which led to a belief that they were
among the missing. When Mr. Pat- j
terson reached the Scales the snow had .
melted, showin n tent covering. Un- I
der this was found the bodies. The men
had evidently been asTeep at the time
of the slide and their faces were as
placid as if they were still asleep.
There is a rumor that last week two
men setting out in a boat down Lake
Tagish wpre accosted by three Indians,
who asked for a ride. This being re
fused the Indians fired on the men,
killing one and dangerously wounding
the other. The Indians were arrested I
by the mounted pol > tried, and, it Is
said, condemned to be hanged to-mor
row morninr.
Vote against tf)Â« new char

amount would be insuffi
cient to eroplcy tfoe neces

FOREIGN
COMMENT
CHANGED
Press of France and Ger=
many Entirely Changes
Its Attitude.
Newspapers of Paris Are Hedg=
ing and Reflect the Nervous
Feeling.
Copj-rlKhted, 189S, by James Gordon Bennett. !
PARIS, May 25.â There 1b nothing
more remarkable in Paris â and one
may say in France â to-day than the
Bplrit of nervousness existing with re
gard to what is America's real senti
ment toward France. It is manifest i
that the press realizes that it took a .
false step at the outbreak of hostilities
between Spain and the United States, j
and now the papers have come to a ;
confused halt. There is a noticeable
change in the papers day by day. The
Gualois is nervous. The Figaro is
hedging. The Temps is dignified and
courteous. The Debats, evidently look-
Ing into the future, fears complications,
and. in fart, sees danger ahead.
The news that the Queen's birthday
had been celebrated in America is
printed in all the papers without com- !
ment. which is an ominous sign. It is
Impossible to deny that a re- |
approachement between England and
America Is viewed here as a threaten- j
ing indication of the future. It brings j
no comfort to any one to realize that ,
the position of the press has been re
sponsible for this state of affairs. This
stretching out of England's hand to
ward America, with a responsive ges
ture on the part of the American pub- ;
lie, is felt to be full of menace for
France. Not only is a loyal and profit
able customer lost, but at once ends the
long - standing sympathy between
France and the United States. Of
course there is absolutely no truth in
the rumor that Americans are probably
more coldly looked upon here. On the
contrary, the people individually arr
trying by every means in their power
to" show that they have bepn misrepre
sented by their papers. Americans are
receiving all the courtesy to which they
have always been accustomed from
the French. At the same time the sit
uation may be summed up in one j

Eighth.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
KPSOM. England, May 25.â The two
hundred and eighteenth renewal of the
Derby stakes (the classic Derby) of
6000 sovereigns was run at Epsom
Downs to-day and was won by J. W.
Larnach's chestnut colt Jeddah, by
Janlssary. out of Pilgrimage. The race
Is for three-year-old colts, by sub
scription of fifty sovereigns each, half
forfeit; the nominator of the win
ner to receive 500 sovereigns, the
owner of the second horse to re
ceive 300 sovereigns and the owner
of the third horse to receive 200 sov
ereigns of the stake. The course is
about a mile and a half.
Derby day opened fine and pleasantly
cool. There were the usual scenes on
the road and rail and immense crowds
gathered on the Downs. The remark
able number of runners (eighteen), un
equaled in the last twenty-three years,
coupled with the openness of the re
sult, added greatly to their interest in
the event. The result in detail was as
follows:
J. W. Larnach's eh. colt Jeddah, by
Janissary, out of Pilgrimage, won;
Duke of Westminster's br. c. Batt, by
Rheen, out of Vampire, second; Prince
of Wales' bay colt Dunlor out of Ayre-
Bhire. out of Fortuna, third.
Sir Tatton Sykas' bay colt Disraeli,
the favorite, led until passing Sher
wood's, when Elfin drew to the front
and led until descending the hill. Then
Batt assumed the lead, but was joined
by the Duke of Portland's bay colt
Wantage and Jeddah. a quarter of a
mile from home, Jeddah winning by
three-quarters of a length. A length
and a half separated second and third
horses. The Duke of Devonshire's
chestnut colt Diudonne . was fourth.
The time was 2 minutes 37 seconds. The
betting previous to the start was 100 to
1 against Jeddah, 100 to 1 against Dun
lop and 10 to 1 against Batt.
Previous to the race the chief inter
est appeared to center in J. W. Foger's
American bay colt Archduke 11. by
Luke Blackburn, out of Duchess (by
Kingfisher), a half-brother of Clifford,
a horse of which the public knew little
except reports of trials including a
supposed phenomenal performance
against History, the winner of the
great Metropolitan stakes. The Amer
icans were said to be supporting Arch
duke II heavily, and it was recalled
that it is Just a century ago that Arch
duke I won the Derby. The other
American horses were the Lorillard-
Beresford stable's entry Elfin, a bay
colt, by Sensation, out of Equality, and
August Belrnont's chestnut colt Bride
groom 11. Archduke II was eighth,
Bridegroom II was eleventh and Elfin
was fourteenth.

BERLIN. May 25.â 1t has always
been a matter of calculation what the
majority of German newspapers would
do for their foreign news without the
Paris edition of the Herald, but no one
would have prophesied that the Ger
man press would be brought back into
the right path of foreign politics by it.
Yet this is what is being indirectly ac
complished, as any one who has noticed
the more temperate and just tone of
such important papers as the Cologne
Gazette and noted the justice in them
to the Herald may see for himself that
where the excellent and progressive
Frankfurter Zeitung and monarchlal
Deutsch^wort were alone in their
championship of the American cause
two weeks ago now even the blindly
prejudiced Berlin Tageblatt is begin
ning to coo like a dove in comparison
at least with its late outbursts.
It is fortunate that most of the Ger
man newspapers are strongly influ
enced in their opinions by such leading
organs as the Cologne Gazette and
Frankfurter Zeitung as opposite as
these two are in party. The Cologne
Gazette receives "straight tips" from
the Foreign Office, and is in a way
semi-official, so that its columns must
be studied with care and respect. The
unjust Gazette hints that English
tourists in Berlin are responsible for
the alleged unjust German hostility to
America and that nothing can be more
Incorrect. The principal point is that
the insistence of the HeraJd that the
German Emperor and his Government
are in no waÂ» hostile to Americans
finally persuaded the German press
that it is time to change its tone.

HAWAII AN OPEN
ALLY TO UNCLE SAM
Islands to Be T/sed as a Coaling Sta
tion and a Military and Naval
Base.
NEW YORK, May 25.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Hawaii has actually assumed the atti
tude of an open ally of the United
States in the war with Spain. Not only
are the islands being used as a coaling
base and a base of supplit-s for military
and naval expeditions to the Philip
pines, but they will probably be made
a depot for troops. Owing to the diffi
culty of obtaining a sufficient number
of troop ships on the Pacific Coast it
will probably be necessary for the
Peking and the Sydney and Australia
after landing the first installment of
troops at Manila, to return for a sec
end load. There are a large number of
coastwise steamers on the Pacific Coast
which would not be capable of making
the run from San Francisco to Manila,
but which could easily be used for car
rying troops to the islands. A plan is
now under consideration to take these
troops to Honolulu by these steamers
and land them there to await the re
turn of the three vessels carrying the
first detachment to Manila. This plan
could only be carried out with the con
sent of the Hawaiian Government, but
the administration has assurances of
this consent. Hawaii, in fact, is ready
to p>> further, and actively wage war
against Spain by raising and equipping
a force to join the expedition to the
Philippines. The Hawaiian Govern
ment has assumed this attitude on the
supposition that her annexation to the
United States is to soon follow.
SAYS CALIFORNIA HAS
NOT BEEN OVERLOOKED
Quartermaster General Declares That
Army Supplies Are Being Pur
chased Here.
WASHINGTON, May 25.â Senator
Perkins called to-day on the quarter
master general and presented the pro
tests of the Board of Trade and Prod
uce Exchange of San Francisco declar
ing that the War Department has not
been purchasing the greater part of its
supplies in San Francisco. The quar
termaster general denied this and said
the only articles not purchased there
were shoes, and that the only shoe fit
for army purposes to be had in Califor
nia had a screw heel, and the depart
ment rejected it.
Senator Perkins called on the Com
missary Department and was told the

LOS ANGELES, May 25.
Found finger marks on third step of
ba.ggn.ge car; somewhat blurred, but looks
like blood. JOHN BURR, Sheriff.
This would support the theory of
some of the officers that the men, after
committing the robbery, rode away on
the blind baggage of the passenger
train which reached here at about 12
o'clock last night. It is kncrvvn at least
one of the men was wounded in the en
counter, for on one of the posts sup
porting the porch at the rear of
Krohn's office, where the men emerged
from the building, a bloody hand print
is discernible.
Krohn first regained consciousness
at about 10 o'clock this morning, and
his physicians now believe he will re
cover from the terrible beating he re
ceived at the hands of the two men
who looted his office. An examination
of his wounds makes it apparent that
he must have been beaten over the
head with some blunt instrument, per
haps a sandbag or slungshot. It was
these blows that rendered the Tax Col
lector unconscious.
When he came out of his stupor he
threw some light on the manner in
which the robbery was perpetrated,
but was unable to give the officers a
definite description of his assailants, as
they had taken the precaution to cover
their faces with masks. He described
the men as being large and of powerful
build.
Krohn said he had been engaged for
several days past in preparing the de
linquent tax list of the county, and
this work compelled him to remain un
til a late hour in his office last night.
Quite a considerable sum of money was
in the vault, as Krohn was awaiting
the return of the Auditor from San
Francisco to audit his accounts, it be
ing his purpose to deposit the funds in
the Commercial Bank. Krohn had oc
casion to go onto the back porch ad
joining his office at about 11 o'clock,
and it must have been when he
returned to his writing at the table
that the men effected an entrance.
He had scarcely sat down at his desk
when he felt the muzzle of a pis
tol against his temple, and an accom
panying request, "Get that sack." Both
robbers had their revolvers leveled at
him. Krohn was unarmed and' could
not reach anything to defend himself
with, so he tried a strategic move with
his desperate visitor, and offered them
a tray containing $400 or $500 in silver,
with a email amount of gold.
This the robbers accepted, but at the
same time cursed the Tax Collector
roundly, commanding him to "get the
sack in the safe." This sack contained
between $7000 and JSOOO. The Tax Col
lector told them there was a time lock
on the safe and it was impossible ti
open it before the time the clock was
set for. This did not satisfy the men.
They told him if he did not open the
â afe Immediately they would kill him.
Then Krohn, with the muzzles of their
revolvers pressing against hi* head,
proceeded to open the safe, and handed
them the main coin bag. Having ob
tained this they commanded him to tf<>
to the front doer and lock it. They
seemed to reconsider this request al
most as s<mhi as it was made, for fear,
it is presumed, that if he got near the
door he would rush outside and give
the alarm. They called him back and
then tried to l>ut him in the vault.
Then ensued the battle between the
brave Tax Collector and his assailants
that nearly resulted in the former's
death. In the melee Kr< .n seized a
miners' drill that lay in the office and
threw it in the direction of one of the
men. It went crashing through one of
the glass partitions. One of the men
tried to stab him, but fortunately the
knife inflicted only a slight flesh wound
about two or three inches long in the
right breast. Krohn seized the blade of
the knife with his left hand and that
member was badly gashed. One of the
men struck him .er the head with a
revolver, and immediately the other
robber felled him with a .stunning blow
on the head with a sand bag or slung
shot. This blow rendered Krohn un
conscious. It is supposed the robbers
believed him dead when they left.
Night Watchman Tooker heard the
crashing glass whei .rohn threw the
drill through the partition, but he was
some distance away and could not lo
cate the sound. Later, In company
with the Collector's wife, the night
watchman found Krohn lying in his
blood on the floor near the front door,
whither he had crawled after the rob
bers left. The floor showed plainly
where Krohn had crawled, the track
being marked by bloody hand prints
for a space of about fifteen feet.

Special r.ispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO, May 25.â Whisky, pov
erty and jealousy were the combined
causes of a double tragedy in this city
last night. Alfred L,ambla, a French
man, aged 60, lived in the eastern part
of the city for the past eight years with
his wife and two boys, George, aged 13.
and Donat, aged 11. The wife worked
at housecleaning and supported the
family.
Last night the couple, who were ap
parently under the influence of liquor,
quarreled, but the boys and the mother
retired at about 7 o'clock. At 7:30 the
boys heard a shot in their mother's
room. They rushed In and found her
dead in bed, with the top of her head
almost blown off. While they were
there another shot came from the fath
er's room, and running in they found
him lying dead on the floor with a
shotgun at his side. He had placed the
muzzle at his chin and pulled the trig
ger.
The little boys opened the window of
their father's room, went to bed and
slept all night. This morning they
got up, prepared and ate breakfast and
lifted the father's body on to the bed.
They washed the floor clean and
hitched up the horse, drove to the po
lice station and reported the crime.
The dead man left a long, rambling
i letter, asking God to forgive the act,
j accusing his > wife of infidelity and
drunkenness and saying he could stand
her actions no longer. Her name was
Winifred. He married her twenty-two
years ago at New London, Conn. An
: elder son and daughter are living, the
former being a printer in Los Angeles.
Vote against the new char
ter because It provides that
officers charged with the
collection of public money
shall settle with the Treas
urer at the close of each
business day. Business days
in all municipal offices close
at 5 P. M. The charter

HAWAIIAN
ANNEXATION
DROPPED
No Chance to Rush the
Scheme in Congress
This Session.
All Attempts to "Jump Through"
the Plan as a War Measure
Will Fail.
Call Office, Rlggs House,
Washington, May 25.
The active opponents of Hawaiian
annexation In the Senate, it is learned,
agreed to the arrangement for daily
sessions of the Senate beginning at 11
i o'clock only after an understanding
with a number of Republican Senators
that the Hawaiian question should not
! be earnestly pressed in the Senate in
! any form this session. The Senators
! were appealed to to expedite the consider
ation of the revenue measure, and as a
counter-proposition asked that Ha
i waiian annexation be dropped. No
party arrangement resulted from these
propositions, the Republicans being
disinclined as a party to leave the Ha
waiian issue go over, but a number of
Republican Senators gave assurances.
; that Hawaiian legislation should not be
seriously pressed at this session. These
assurances, the Senators hostile to an
nexation say, are sufficiently numerous
to warrant them in believing an ad
journment of Congress will be taken
without action.
The advocates of Hawaiian annexa
tion say a Republican caucus of the
House on that issue will be held im
mediately after the adjournment to
morrow. They were active to-day, and
a sufficient number of members for a
calling of a caucus have subscribed to
a paper now in the hands of Repre
sentative Grosvenor of Ohio, chairman
of the caucus committee, but the call
has not yet been issued.

LOS ANC .LES, May 25.â For some
years past the city of Los Angeles has
I been compelled to bear an extraordi
nary burden In paying for lighting
i streets. For something like 450 lights
: It has paid the Los Angeles Lighting
Company over $50,000 per annum. Such
a thing as competition for this service
was an impossibility, as none of the
electric companies save the Los Ange
; les Lighting Company had proper
! equipment In the way of poles and

A proposition now is advanced for the
! city to construct its own lighting plant,
in so far as po.es, wires, etc., are con
' cerned, and then to advertise for bids
'â  to furnish ie power requisite to run
about double the number of lights now
In service. If the city were to have
such a plant it could obtain twice as
many lamps as it now has and the cx

rushing madly into a blunder which it
can never retrieve.
That seems to be the situation with
the Hawaiian annexation scheme. ThÂ«
House is undoubtedly favorable to a
considerable majority, but it is the in
fatuation of madness, not the calm re
sult of reasoning. The Speaker has
stood out single handed so often against
this class of jobs that he will probably
try to do it again if there is the faintest
hope of success. At any rate his party
will not get past him with its annexa
tion nonsense, and he has read it a
lesson and. a prophecy. The annexation
bill means a long session, and a long
session is the worst menace which now
confronts the Republican party on the
way to the polls. The idea that a long
session is inevitable if the Hawaiian
scheme gets well under way is gradu
ally working itself into a good many
minds disposed to reject it a while ago.
Whatever the House may do, the pre
paration in the Senate for a game of
try-out is unmistakable. It is as true
as a historical fact that the plan upon
which a majority of th^ Senators agree
always carries, regardless of the Senate
rules' or lack of them. But the mistake
is made in many quarters in supposing
that because under ordinary conditions
a majority <>f the Senate favor annexa
tion, therefore the same majority
would favor a resort to "jumping
through" the annexation bill as a war
measure. The weakness of an appar
ent majority in Congress always rests
in the element which, though unwilling
to be counted flatly against a party
measure, recognizes the inexpediency of
time or manner or some other condition
of its introduction a*d play a lukewarm
policy. Not a few Ttepublioans in the
Senate are believed to stand on pre
cisely that attitude toward the Ha
waiian bill, and their tacit disapproval
will be one of the adverse influences
against which the friends of the bill
must be prepared to struggle â an In
fluence as serious in effect and vastly
more subtle than outright opposition.
There is no telling when the session
will end If the House passes the Ha
waiian bill and sends it to the Senate.
If the debate be cut in two by recesa
annexation is dead for the present Con
gress.

fThe Efficiency of the School System Will
Surely Be Badly
Crippled,
A full realization of the fact that the
proposed charter strikes a blow at the
present school system has caused wide
spread alarm among those who believe
that the schools are the standard by
which this or any other community
must be judered.
A critical inspection of the new char
ter has disclosed the fact that its
fra.mers, either because of stupidity or
a sense of false economy, have made
inadequate provision for the support of
the schools as they now exist, and have
left entirely out of their calculations
any provision for the natural increase
in th" student population from year to
year. There is also no provision for the
building of new schwolhouses, nor is
there an adequate sum provided for
the maintenance of those that now ex

OGDEN, Utah, May 25.â General
Wee ey .M^rritt. the new Governor Gen
tf the Philippine Islands, arrived
in Ogden at noon to-day. Hr was
Ing when the train arrived, but
was met by v large crowd of enthusi
i â pie, among whom were Gov
ernor Wells, his staff and all the State
rs. His conversation was not of a
very happy nature, and he seemed ill
Lse with himself and at outs with
.â¢â  m rid, including the adminis
:i. Since his denial of an in
terview recently published in a
New York paper in Which he was re
have criticised the War De
tent nr.d refused to go to the Phil
tes the general has dodged news
â¢ reporters, but to-day he seemed
i that they were his friends. Dur
, conversation with a newspaper
representative the general said in ref
â¢ to his proposed Philippine inva
that "the President gave me to
undei â¢ at I was to use no undue
haste, to take my time; this war-mak
ii a Is a Blow and tedious business.
"Then you don't know when you will
leave for the front."
"No, sir."
"Will it be two weeks?"
longer, I do not know."
The 'general stated that he had been
called away from Chicago a day sooner
than he expected and would rush
through. To a question about the war
Jd: "I don't want to talk about
it; don't suit me."
He said he knew nothing about the
Philippines or Cuba. "They told me in
Washington that it was no hotter in
Manila than there, and I know It Is
more disagreeable," he said, ap
parently referring to his relations to
the War Department.
Finally the reporter asked him anout
the Interview which was published and
i:i which he criticised harshly the work
..f the administration and the War
rtm-iit. He admitted that the in
terview was correct, but denied that
he had been interviewed. His most
concise statement was: "The Interview
was not with me. A gentleman with
whom I bad a private conversation was
viewed and he talked more than
he ought to."
The train Was then started on its way
to Han Francisco and General Merritt
went on to his labors as Governor-
General of the Philippines.

â¢ CHICKAMAUGA NATIONAL PARK.
May â¢;- -_The sham battle at Chi'ka
mauga Park this morning, in which
three brigades of General Wilson's first
army corps participated, was one of the
most thrilling military spectacles that
has been witnessed since the Civil War.
jfcTter seven hours of n'rnost continuous
â Xneuvering, In which was exempli
flfti almost every phaso of military tac
tics, General A. 8. Hurt, commanding
the First Brigade, was outclassed by
the Second and Third Brigades, which
were pitted against him.
At 4 o'clock this morning the call to
necessary for the support of the schools
is obtained by a tax of 35 cents on each
$100 valuation of the taxable real and
personal property in the city and coun
ty. To this is added the money drawn
from the State school fund. By this
moans it is possible to raise a maxi
mum sum of $1,845,500. Even under
these conditions there is a deficit in the
school fund for the present year of
over $150,000.
Under the provisions of the proposed
charter the maximum sum that can
be raised for the support of the schools
is $1,085,7~>0. The present needs of the
School Department demand a larger
sum than this for actual support with
out taking into account any emergen
cies, such as the construction of new
buildmgs or the needs that follow the
natural increase in the student popula
tion. Should money be required for
I arm? was made. The First Brigade,
i General Burt commanding, composed
j Of the First Ohio, Fifth Illinois and the
j Third Wisconsin, was posted at McFar
| land's Gap, under orders to hold the
Gap if possible and if impossible to re
treat In good order. Against the First
Brigade were the Second and Third.
The Second was commanded by Gen
eral Compton, composed of the* Fourth
Ohio. Third Illinois and Fourth Penn
sylvania, and the Third, commanded by
! General Hulings and composed of the
; Sixteenth Pennsylvania, One Hundred
and Fifty-seventh Indiana and Second
Wisconsin.
The maneuvering was determined
from the start and during the progress
of the maneuvers portions of the com
mands were scattered to various parts
<'f the field. Here a company wouM
charge and put to retreat a detached
squad of the opposing command, else
where skirmish lines were thrown out
and at times drivon back. As timbered
sections Were reached skilled move
ments were made to gain the shelter of
the trees. Repeated charges were made
against General Burt's front, only to be
gallantly repulsed. The doughty com
mander had lost none of the spirit that
characterized him upon the same field
when it ran with the carnage of actual
battle a third of a century ago. At last
Generals Compton and Hulings de
cided upon a combined front and flank
ick.
The Second Brigade attacked the
| front, while the Third was thrown to
General Burt's right flank. Right gal
lantly was the new movement met by
the First; but at last the Third suc
ceeded in outflanking the First, and
i gained the rear, cutting off General
Burt's retreat. At 11:01 o'clock the
"battle" was declared to have been won
by Generals Compton and Hulings.
A serious casualty occurred in the
progress of the battle. Lieutenant
j Batty of the Sixteenth Pennsylvania,
I in command of a squad, was surround
i ed by Company C of the First Ohio
Regiment, and was ordered to surren
i der. Instead of surrendering, Lieu
tenant Batty ordered a bayonet charge.
While at close range a member of the
Ohio command shot directly at Lieu
tenant Batty, the charge striking him
I In the face and neck, inflicting painful
i and serious injuries. Both eyes were
badly injured, and the vision may be
destroyed. Bad blond was engendered
by the incident, and the men rushed
together. It was only liy the coolness
and presence of mind of the officers
that bloodshed was averted.
The volunteer army at Chickamauga
Park now numbers ?,'>, 914 men, and this
will be increased by 10.000 by the close
|of the week. The Eighth New York
I Infantry arrived thl.s morning. The
regiment is composed of twelve com-
I panles, with a roster of 1026 men and
officers, and is commanded by Colonel
Henry Chauncey Jr.
The Eighth was turned over to Gen

such purposes the only manner in
which it could be raised would be by a
bond issue. One section of the charter
provides for the holding of a special
election when it becomes necessary to
issue bonds to secure funds for the con
struction of new municipal buildings.
At such elections the question of
whether or not bonds shall be issued
for the purpose specified is submitted
to the voters. Even should it be held,
which is doubtful, that a schoolhouse
is a municipal building, it would still
be necessary to hold a special election
before funds could be obtained for its
construction. As it is estimated that
such an election will cost not less than
$180,000 it will be seen that under the
charter the school system is doomed
unless its proper support is undertaken
at a cost that in a few years would
bankrupt the city.
Since 1895 the average annual ap
propriation for the support of the
schools has been $1,133,360. In
spite of this the department is
at present confronted with a
deficit of over $150,000, and the amount
of money for the completion and fur
nishing of the Mission High School has
yet to be provided. In the face of these
facts it must be apparent to every one
that $1,088,750, the maximum amount
allowed by the charter for the annual
support of the schools, is insufficient.
The result of the adoption of the char
ter will be the crippling of the school
system in a most serious manner.
If further proof were needed it would
only be necessary to quote the amounts
that have been expended for the sup
port of the schools in the years 1890-91,
1891-92, 1592-93 and 1593-94. The aver
age annual appropriation for the three
years was $1,075,713, aji amount that is
but $13,037 less thaji the maximum
amount provided for by the charter.
That was six years ago. The increase
in the number of children of school age

vides that the Board of
Public Works shall consist
of one Republican, one

shows that the charter

The Kansas Congressman to Organize

TOPEKA, Kan., May 25. â Congress
man Jerry Simpson wants to go to war
as colonel of a Kansas regiment. Im
mediately afer the publication of Presi
dent McKinley's call for additional vol
unteers Congressman Simpson tele
graphed to' Governor Leedy for author
ity to raise a regiment and asking for a
commission as its colonel. Governor
Leedy is out of town, and what his an
swer will be is not known. It is prob
able that Congressman Simpson's re
quest will be granted. Simpson was re
nominated for Congress last week by
the Populists of his district.
Vote against the new
charter because it pro
vides for levying taxes for
city and county purposes
on or before the last Mon
day in June. At that time
the tax rolls are not made
up. How can the levy be
made?

was organized here this afternoon.
Over fifty women were present. A
movement is on foot to increase the

become a member of the society. The
following officers were chosen: Mrs.
E. S. Churchill, president; Mrs. F. W.
Bush, vice-president; Miss Louise
Churchill, secretary; Mrs. Owen Moran,
treasurer.

His Last "Heft" for the Charter.
Mayor Phelan addressed the Demo
BUCKLEY ADMITS HE IS
WORKING FOR THE CHARTER.
Farmer C. A. Buckley is in politics again, and, naturally, he is pursuing the same tactics that for years
made him a power in the city and State.
The ex - boss has made frequent trips to San Francisco since the beginning of the charter cam
paign, and among his friends it has been an open secret that "Chris" is backing the charter with all the
strength at his command.
That this strength is considerable is shown by a statement he made to his friend Treacy, the well
known contractor, no longer ago than last Tuesday night. Buckley had journeyed down from hia Livermore
home that day, and hunting up his friend Treacy they talked over the prospects for the charter.
"I have three thousand men right now on the register to vote for the charter," Buckley said to his
friend, "and I don't see how we can lose."
Three thousand votes colonized by Buckley for the charter, according to hi 3 own admission. Of course
the ex-boss is for the charter. When the instrument was framed one of the first comments made was, "What a
splendid opportunity for Buckley." Chris has always been a firm believer in the one-man power. He was the
one-man power himself for many years, but his sway under the present conditions drew too much attention to
himself and finally he was overthrown.
With the new charter in operation it would be different. Buckley would only have to control the Mayor
and reap the reward. It is a difficult matter to elect all the men a successful boss finds it necessary to control
now, but under the proposed law he could concentrate his energies on one man â the Mayor â and make a win
ning fight every time.
Buckley is shrewd â his bitterest enemy has always been ready to admit that â and he is keeping well
in the background now, merely adding to the three thousand voters he boasted of controlling as opportunity
offers. After to-day, though, if the charter carries, Chris may be expected to move his headquarters down
here and assume charge of the local campaign for Mayor.
Buckley failed to state -where his three thousand voters were coming from, but Buck has an intimate
knowledge of all the cheap lodging houses in town. There have been many ugly rumors for some time that
the voters of the First Regiment who are now on their way to Manila will put in an appearance at the polls
to-day. It is not improbable that part of Buck's three thousand are to come from these, and that he has
provided substitutes to vote the names of the absent heroes who registered before they had any intimation
that on election day they would be speeding to war.
ARMED CLASH
IS IMMINENT
Bolinas Feud Growing
More Serious.
YOUNG PIERSON WARNED
ORDERED TO LEAVE BEFORE
SATURDAY NIGHT.
Citizens Talk of Instituting White
cap Methods Because of the
Recent Crown Mine
Episode.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, May 26.â The trouble
In Bolinas between the Golden Crown
Milling and Mining Company has
reached a point where the inhabitants
expect an armed clash. As a result of
the action of J. W. Plerson Jr. in mak
ing a bold sortie upo-n the property of
the company, which Constable McCoy
had taken away, and bringing it back
with a number of armed employes, the
citizens of the town have declared that
Pierson must leave before Saturday
night, intimating that he will be garbed
with a coat of tar and feathers if he
fails to comply.
A citizen of Bolinas reached here this
evening with the statement that young
Pierson has been formally notified to
that effect this morning, and had re
plied that he would stay and light it
out to the death. He Is known to go
armed constantly, and is known as a
man who will "shoot at the drop of the
hat" when he believes he is being un
fairly dealt with. The fact that the
populace is aflame over what has taken
place recently makes it quite certain
that the citizens will attempt to carry
out their threat. As Pierscm has num
erous employes at the mine, all well
armed, a desperate fight may be ex
pected.
Late to-night, Frank Depe-w, who
drives the stage between Ureenbra>>
and San Quentin, hearing of th^ inten
tion of the citizens to tar and feather
yotlng Pierson, came to this city with
a friend and started immediately for
Bolinas.
"We are going with our revolvers
oiled and a good supply of cartridges,"
said Depew, "and we are going to help
Emerson. If the town attempts to tar
and feather him somebody is going to
get hurt."
A communication was sent to one of
the local weekly papers for publication
to-day, bearing the inscription, "A
Lively Time in Bolinas Next Saturday
Night." It recounts the causes leading
up to the present imbroglio. The arti
cle states that Pierson must pay his
bills without any legal trouble, evident
ly meaning that he will be given time
to do this before next Saturday night.
In conclusion, the communication
states that the mining company "must
pull in its horns or have them knocked
off close to the head."
Affairs have reached such a state
that Sheriff Harrison will probably
leave for Bolinas before Saturday.
Voters, do not be de
ceived by the cry that cor
porations are fighting the
charter. The Southern
Pacific Company's paper,
the Post, is for it.

Coast.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, May 25.â The Washington
volunteers and their friends are greatly
displeased over the present arrange
ments for their disposition. They are
understood to have been selected, to
gether with the Third Artillery and
Fourth Cavalry, to garrison coast
States, all other coast troops having
been transferred to General Otis' com
mand for service in the Philippines.
The Third Battalion of the First
W.-tshington Regiment, which left to
day for Vancouver, has been looking
for several days for the man or men
responsible for its detention for garri
son duty, when every member wants to
see active service.
As nearly as can be learned, some
body telegraphed to Washington that
the regiment was anxious to remain at
home. "Who it was is not yet known,
for everybody who might have had in
fluence with the War Department de
nies having taken such action. At any
rate the members of the Third Bat
talion are "hot" about it, and before
leaving requested their friends to use
every influence to have them sent to
the Philippines. Both the soldiers and
people throughout the State consider
it something of a disgrace for them to
be thus excepted while volunteers from
every other coast State are going to
the front.
Governor Rogers is keeping the wires i
hot between Olympia and Washing
ton, D. C, and, backed by the Wash
ington delegation, is working to have
Secretary Alger or General Merriam
send a Washington regiment to Manila.

AMENDMENTS
ARE A SNARE.
The People Will Have No Pow-
er to Change the Charter.
It seems to have been the purpose of
the framers of the proposed charter
to prevent the people from changing It
should it once be adopted.
Much has been said regarding the
possibility that is secured to the people
of amending the charter provided any
section of it should prove objectiona
ble. There is, indeed, such a possi
bility, but it can only be attained at
such a great cost that it is practically
out of the consideration of possibili
ties.
Auditor Broderick, who has given
much time to the study of the charter,
has this to say on the subject of amend
ments:
â¢â¢I think that the charter can !
only be amended by a, special !
election ordered by the Elec- {
tion Commissioners. As the :
Election Commissioners arc
the creatures ol* the Mayor it
follows that any proposed !
amendments that are not in j
accordance with the -views of
the Mayor can never be made.
The wishes of the people will
go for nothing;. Under the
provisions of the charter an
election must be held each year
at a cost of about SISO,OOO. It
is not likely that except in
cases of great necessity the
public will care to spend a like
sum for a special election,
should the Mayor Spaciously
give his consent. The charter,
makers want the instrument
as it was framed to stand as
long as possible, hence the '
trick of the amendment clause :
which it was hoped would
throw dust in the eyes of the
voting public."
Vote against the new charter
because the tax levy is required
to be fixed before the assess
ment roll is completed.

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
â¢ XKW YORK. May 25.â 1t was a day of ma
neuvering for position between the opposing
elements among the trailers on the stock ex
change. The complete discrediting of yester
day's flood of rumors made the market seem
very vulnerable this morning. Declines for
Americans Into London added to this appear
ance and there was selling for London ac
count In the early dealings In place of the
rather urgent buying, which was a feature of
yesterday's market. The completion of the
settlement on she I^ondon Exchange appar- ,
ently ended the demand, which was attributed
to a large outstanding short Interest. But the
early reaction did not go far and was checked
by the vigorous support and stimulated rise
of a number of the leading specialties. Includ
ing Manhattan and Metropolitan Street Rail
way, on revived rumors of consolidation. '
Third Avenue Jumped 6 points. Most of the
Vanderbilt stocks developed strength after
buying of New York Central had lifted Its price
to $1 17%. A number of trunk lines and coal
ers shared in this strength. But the railroad
list as a whole continued very sluggish and
did not respond readily to the Impetus which
it was sought to Impart by this lifting of spe
cial stocks. The demand proved very light
and prices dropped. The bears were thus en
couraged to more vigorous measures to bring
about a decline. Their attack was directed
against the specialties with a view to uncov
ering stop loss orders. This thov succeeded
in doing in Metropolitan Street Railway, To
bacco and one or two nther special ties. 1 â¢ â â¢
clines In these stocks ranged from 1 to 4 points
and In some railways extended to a point. N"
general liquidation was induced, however, and
.there was some covering at the decline, so that
the market rallied and closed dull and firm.
Manhattan and some of the Vanderbilts and
.the coalers closed higher and Third Avenue and
Great Northern preferred continued to show
conspicuous strength. Otherwise net losses
.were the rule. From the speculative point
of view the bottling up of the Spanish fleet
in Santiago seems to be considered the next
best thing to the defeat of the fleet in battle.
The Issuance of the President's call for 75,
000 more volunteers was made some use of by
the bears In their afternoon raid.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, May 25.â There was some recovery
in Wheat to-day from the depression and weak
i ness which ruled yesterday. The Liverpool j
' cables came hieher, which was quite unex- ,
I pected in view of our recent weakness, and
i suggested the Idea of manipulation, especially
as the continental markets were all lower. '
i Trade was dull, but the late bearish news and i
the bearish statistics seemed to have been
partly forgotten, and there was a good deal of !
profit taking. Another reason for strength
was the nervous feeling over May and the gen
eral expectation that Loiter was sure to put ]
i the price of that month materially higher. The
inference was that all the futures would be '
i bulllshly affected by the exictement and high
prices In May, and this, with the higher prices
abroad, started shorts to cover and added
somewhat to the advancement. There was an
effort to put more vigor and strength into
I July, and the effort was In a measure success
' ful, being aided by the general expectation of
! hull manipulation by the party in control of
May and June. The weather was much cooler,
but quite favorable for growing wheat. Liver
pool cables, are %d higher. July opened %{j)3o
higher at $1 10@l 12%, sold oft to $1 o!i%, then
rallied to $1 12% at the close. September closed
at SS%@BB%c, a gain of l%c. May ranged be- j
tween $1 57 and $1 70, the latter the closing ;
figure. â â >. ',''â 'â â â  ' ...â -,
Corn was firm at the opening. â¢ Realizing j

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON, May 25.â American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow: The Im
proved character of the market becomes more
obvious each week. Where a few weeks ago
scarcely anybody was selling any wool, now
everybody 16 selling some. While the demand
has continued to run to medium washed wools,
such as are suitable for army supplies, then*
has been quite a marked improvement in tht
Inquiries for territory. In fact, the latter, in
stead of figuring in conspicuously In the week
ly sales of late, this week has once more as
sumed the leading position.
Prices display a hardening tendency. That
Is. asking prices are somewhat firmer than
heretofore and In some lines actual selling
prices are fully up to the holders quotation*.
The outlook is regarded as very encouraging.
The pales of the week amount to 1,760.000
pounds domestic and 580,400 pounds foreign,
making a total of 2,340.000. against a total of
1,402.000 pounds for the previous week, and
a total of 4,300,000 pounds for the corresponding
week last year.

THE STOCK MARKET.
Mining stocks continued to Improve, though
the Improvement was slight.
The Challenge assessment falls delinquent In
i board to-day.
On the Bond Exchange Oceanic Steamship
made a further advance to $60 25 under free
i transactions, owing to the brilliant condition
of the company's affairs.
The following ore shipments were made over
the Eureka and Palisade railroad from the
mines of Eureka district, Nevada, for the
week ending May 20: Eureka Sampling Works.
63.500 pounds; Jackson, 66,100; Williamsburg.
31,420; Rocco-Hamilton, 30.790.
In the Crown Point mine the past week has
J been occupied in getting to and repairing
! the cave at the 1000 foot level, which is found
to be confined chiefly to the fourth, or pump,
compartment. Bulkheads will be put in to sus
! tain it. They are engaged also in repairing
i the shaft at the 160,, 500 and 800 foot levels
! at points requiring attention.
! The official letter from the Justice mine for
, the past week says: "We have been en
; gaged in stoping ore In the south drift from
I the station at the top of the winze and from
I the north drift on the 80 foot level, and have
hoisted 13 tons and 200 pounds of ore. The
| car samples averaged, gold. $55 48; silver. $45 25;
i total, $100 T3 per ton. On the 22d instant we got
i up steam at the Woodvllle hoisting worka and
: sent the cage down to the 822 foot level. The
[ shaft was found to be in good condition, ex
j eept a few pieces of timber, which can easily
! be replaced. The station at the 370 foot level,
| where it Is proposed to start the new west
, drift to connect with our present workings at
! a greater depth, is caved, and will have to be
' retlmbered. The machinery Is In good condl
l Uon and worked all right."
The yield of the Overman mine for the past
week amounted to 6 car loads of ore, of the
average car sample assay of $45 03 per ton.
| The ore came from the workings in the north
i drift on the 900 foot level. There is no change
In the condition of the mine.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
â _ 908 Broadway, May 25.
The Red Cross day at the race track
caused a discussion at the meeting of the
lied Cross League of Oakland to-day.
Mrs. Alice Bunnell, who was acting as
president, called the attention of the la
dles to the fact of which they were pre
viously ignorant, that there is to be a
Red Cross day at the Emeryville track
next Friday. Six hundred tickets have
been sent to the Oakland ladies with a re
quest that they dispose of them.
After stating the facts Mrs. Bunneil
asked the ladies what was their pleasure
In the matter. Silence followed. Then
the chairman held up one of the cards,
on^ which was printed a red cross.
"I think It does not look well for the
emblem of this society to be used for ad

"It Is contrary to the national rules and

California Red Cross Society.' "
"It probably refers to the San Fran

OAKLAND, May 25.â The commence
yneneement exercises of Mills College !
took place to-day at that institution amid
a profuse decoration of the stars and i

THE LIBRARY TRUSTEES.
Will Take No Action in the Har
boume Defalcation Matter.
ALAMEDA, May 25.â At the meeting of
the board of library trustees last even
ing the Harbourne defalcation was dis
cussed, and it was agreed by the mem
bers that if there were any suits to be
brought, it was the province of the city
officials to bring them and not the library
board. That board is merely the agent of
the city government, and its members cud
not believe they had the right to bring
such suit. Furthermore, they have re
ceived no official notice that any such ac
tion had been taken by the City Trustees
as granting them permission to use the
name of thp city to hring suit.
The matter of having a new catalogue
printed for the library was taken up and
discussed, and it was agreed to circulate
a subscription list pledging patrons of the
library to purchase copies of such cata
logue at actual cost. In this way it was
thought the work could be done' without
expense to the library.

The Burial of Williams.
ALAMEDA, May 26.â The body of Wil

still lies at the Morgue in this city un
â¢l. One of his fellow-workmen in
the wire works in San Francisco came
over to-day and requested that it be held
for a little time to enable communication
to be made with Williams' people in Eng
land, who are said to be wealthy. Deputy
( nrorer Fowler will do this, but if no re
ply is received within a short time the
body will be buried in the potters' field
by the county.
Traffic Delayed.
ALAMEDA, May 25.â Complaint is made
of the mariner in which traffic is obstruct- j
ed by the Webster-street drawbridge !
being opened needlessly and for extended >
periods. Last Sunday before and after
the accident on the narrow-gauge line the i
draw was opened for nearly two hours to
allow an old scow to be windlassed
through an inch at a time against wind !
and tide. After it got through it had to
tie up, as it could go no further. Fully a
thousand people wen delayed by this ac- i
tion. To add to the grievance is the fact i
that the men who run the scow are a â 
couple of foreigner.*, who apparently took ;
this opportunity to show their contempt j
for Americans in general.

Students Eager for the War.
BERKELEY, May 25.â Among the
Berkeleyana who went to San Francisco
to-day to enlist was Edward McCleavo, a
junior at the State university and a son
of Captain McCleave of North Berkeley,
who fought in the Civil War. McCleave.
whose elder brother. Lieutenant Robert
McCleave. U. S. A., h;is recently been as
signed for duty in Cuba, had been offered
a good position in Alaska before the call
for volunteers was made. His ticket was
already bought and he was to have sailed
next Sunday, but the call to arms proved
Irresistible. His parents reluctantly gave I
their consent to his enlistment, as he
lacked several months of having attained 'â¢
his majority, and to-day he went with a
number of fellow-students to enter the
Fourteenth Regiment of the regulars
Among the other Berkeley men who also
went over to enlist were Football Coach
Garrett Cochran and "Kid" Vassar of
Princeton, I. C. Boss of the University of
California, Payson Riggs, Fred Berger. R.
Masters and Earl Nutting of the Berke
ley High School.
Vote against the new charter
because section 5 of article llj
chapter 1, abolishes precinct
registration and wipes out the
registration act of 1878. By
thus establishing central office ;
registration a great inconven- I
ience is placed upon the labor
ing classes who usually register
in their precincts.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAJ^L, THURSDAY, MAY 26, 1898.
COURT NAMES
THE EXPERTS
Novel Point Decided by
Judge Greene.
WILL EXPEDITE TRIALS
ANNIE McCANN IS SUING FOR
HEAVY DAMAGES.
Will Be Examined by Doctors Who
Have Been Selected for the
Purpose by the .
Bench.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 26.
Judge Greene passed upon a point never
before decided in the courts of this State
this morning when he granted defen
dant's motion for the appointment by the
court of medical experts to examine into
the alleged injuries of the plaintiff In the
case of Annie C. McCann against the
Piedmont and Mountain View Railway
Company for $50,000 damages.
The motion was argued on Monday last,
when Attornes- Bell, appearing for the de
fendant, cited extensively from the
authorities and argued that in cases of
this nature, where complicated injuries
are alleged and heavy damages sought, It
is necessary that the court appoint disin
terested experts to examine plaintiff, to
the end that full and complete justice may
be done to all parties. Mr. Hell contended
that experts brought into court by either
party are too prone to be prejudiced or
biased in favor of the party calling them.
There has been ample justification for
the arguments of Mr. Bell in cases tried
within the past few years in Alameda
County. One of the most noted is un
doubtedly that of Colonel Wettstein
against the railroad company, in which
medical experts were found who testified
to all sorts and conditions of physical
wreckage and flatly contradicted each
I'thr-r on all points.
Messrs. Fitzgerald and Abbot, who ap
pearVor the Piedmont and Mountain View
Railway, deny the defendant's right to
such an examination of the plaintiff, and
stated that they had already agreed that
she should be examined by the defen
dant's physician. The matter was argued
at length and submitted to Judge Greene,
who rendered his decision this morning.
The court held that under the law and
the rules of the court the defendant is
entitled to the appointment of experts by
the court, and Judge Greene named Drs.
J. S. Adams, J. M. Solfridge and H. M.
Rucker of Oakland and Dr. ..lartin of San
Francisco, a specialist in nervous dis
eases, to make the examination asked for.
The plaintiff alleges in her complaint
that she is suffering from spinal mening
itis and complicated nervous troubles as
a result of the defendant's negligence in
prematurely starting a car which she was
attempting to board in June of last year.
TRAINING FOR BUSINESS.
Organization of the College of Com
merce of the University of
California.
BERKELEY, May 25.â The* '"olleg-> of

of the faculty, consisting of President
Kellogg and Professors Davidson, Slate,
Plehn, Hllgard, Bacon and Moses, had

Secretary E. W. Davis of the University

A barn at Seventh and Delaware streets.
West Berkeley, valued at $400, and belong
ing to Jerry Doran, was destroyed by fire
early this morning. Tramps are sup
posed to have caused the fire.
The funeral of the late R. R. Swain
took place to-day from his late residence,
2'XW Charming way. Rev. J. M. Thompson
and Rev. H. Hillard officiated. The inter
ment was in Mountain View Cemetery.
West Horkdoy Lodge No. 21, Order of

The Berkeley volunteers, who now num
ber fifty, will meet next Friday evening
In Odd Fellows' Hall. An effort will be
made to recruit the company to Its full
quota of eighty men.
Vote against the new
charter because section 2
of chapter 2, article VII, of
thecharter, says: "Adults
shall be entitled to free
instruction in the even
ing schools, but no child
under 14 years of age
shall be admitted to such
schools." This is a direct
blow at the children of the
poor.
NO PAY, NO BOXING.
The Occidental Handball Club's First
Fistic Show Ended in a Fizzle.
The Occidental Handball and Athletic
CluÃ gave its first and doubtless its last
entertainment on Tuesday at 120 Grove
Btreet.
The hall or handball court was well
filled with people, who paid an admission
fee to see the sport, but when the master
of ceremonies announced that the event
of the evening would not take place there
were howls and vigorous protests from
the spectators, many of whom demanded
the return of their money.
The main event was to have been an
eight-round contest between Eugene Mul
ligan and J. Granfleld, but the boxers re
fused to" spar unless the managers of the
club fulfilled their promise, which was
the presentation of a 550 trophy to the
winner.
It appears that the club would not give
the lads more than $7 50 with which to
purchase a trophy, and they declined the
offer with thanks.
Previous to the so-called event of the
evening there were some tiresome boxing
contests, which did not', by any means,
enthuse the crowd.
This was the first and possibly will be
the last boxing show that will be given
under the auspices of the Occidental
HandbaJl and Athletic Club In this city.
COAL FROM NEWCASTLE.
Fifty Thousand Tons Outside of the
Ordinary Contracted For.
Coal from Newcastle, N. 8. W.. will
pour into San Francisco for the next two
or three months. Outside of ordinary
business 50,000 tons has been contracted
for, and It has all to be delivered on
schedule time. There are at the present
time twenty-four vessels in Newcastle,
N. S. W., either loading or under charter
to come te this port with coal. Their
carrying capacity is about 60,000 tons, and
as it is coming here in the ordinary course
of business it docs not count. These
vessels will also get here inside of the
ninety days, so that in less than three
months 110.000 tons of coal will have en
tered the Golden Gate.
The Zealandia went to the Sugar Re
finery yesterday. She had in her hold
17.754 backs of sugar, but as a double gang
of men was taken along it is expected
that she will be discharged at noon to
day. From the refinery the steamer will
go" to the Hunters Point drydock, and if
all goes well she will be back at Pacific
street wharf Saturday morning. The
work of fitting her out for troops will be
done as quickly as possible. .Captain
Howard will have her ready to take away
troops a couple of days before she Is
wanted by the Government.
Among those who went away on the
Peking yesterday was George Stephens
Jr. He is only a lad and was not a mem
ber of the National Guard, but as soon
as the trump of war was sounded he
sought out Captain McCreagh of Com
pany D, First Regiment, and enlisted. His
brother, who is an inspector in the Cus
toms service, and a host of his friends
and relatives, were out on a tug to bid
him a last farewell.
WATER RATES ARE
FOR THE COURTS
JUDGE MORROW DECIDES A DE
MURRER OF IMPORTANCE.
.
They Must Be Reasonable nnd That
Fact Must Be Established by
the Evidence.
United States Circuit Judge Morrow yes
terday handed down a decision to the ef
fect that the fixing by a board of county
supervisors of rates to be charged by an ;
irrigation company was a Federal ques- -
tion. The opinion was given in the matter
of the demurrer of the defendants In the
case of the San Joaquin and Kings River
Irrigation Company and others against
the Board of Supervisors of Stanislaus
County.
The proceeding was In the form of a bill '
I in equity to enjoin the defendants from
attempting to enforce an order fixing rates
which complainants should charge for
water. Judge Morrow said In his opin
ion:
'As a quasi-public corporation the com
plainant is undoubtedly subject to reason- '
able regulations as to rates which it
should charge for the distribution of
Water. It must be held to have accepted
its franchise rights and privileges sub
ject to the condition that the government
creating It, or the government within
whose limits it conducts its business may
by legislation protect the people against :
unreasonable charges for the service ren
dered it, and. on the other hand, it is not
subject to such unreasonable regulations
as would deprive it from earning a rea

ENOUGH FOUND
FOR A FIGHT
Alameda's Democracy Is
Being Resurrected.
ENGLISH FOR GOVERNOR
HIS FRIENDS DISTURB THE
MAGUIRE CAMP.
The Stalwarts Do Not Appear to Be
Working Together With Old-
Time Harmony These
Days.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, May 25.
At last enough Democrats or ex-fusion
ista have been found In Alameda County
to disagree. It has been thought for sev
eral months that Congressman Maguire
could not command much support on this
side of the bay, and slnre the Populists
have shown their opposition to any more
fusion, Alameda Democrats, or a certain
section of them, have been looking about
for some other man. It has now trans
pired that the friends of ex-Congressman
barren B. English are quietly canvassing
among the various factions with the view
of securing the unanimous indorsement
of the delegates to further his aspirations
for the Democratic nomination for Gov-
ernor.
It Is given out that Mr. English has re
ceived much encouragement, and the more
enthusiastic of his friends announce that
;he is in the fight to a finish. They con
tend that as the Supervisor of Contra
Costa he made an enviable record; that as
i State Senator he was always on the pop
! ular side, and that In his various contests
' for Congress he has always run far ahead
1 of his ticket, and developed a quality as a
I vote-catcher. These things his friends de
clare are necessary in a candidate in this
year of apparent Democratic disaster.
Mr. English's friends vow and declare
that there are in this banner Republican
; county several Democratic factions whom
lie only can unite and thus secure to his
party a less emphatic defeat than any
' other candidate. The fact that an effort is
i being made on behalf of Warren B. Eng
lish has caused general surprise, for the
idea has been fostered by many Demo
crats that Congressman Maguire would
â  have the delegation in spite of all oposi
tion, the Moffitt-I.aymance element being
believed to be advocates of the single
taxer, with the Fitzgerald-Brosnahan co
! norts acquiescing.
Ex-Senutor Muffin has been saying that
' he would not tako a hand in politics at
\ any time this year, and M. J. Laymance,
the ez-chalrtnan of the Democratic coun
ty central committee, hat- announced his
lntentlqn*of going to the Klondike. Chair
man Bfosnahan of the county committee
;is supposed td bo a personal friend of
Warren English, and Mr. Fitzgerald will
undoubtedly be on whichever side of the
iocal controversy Governor Budd favors.
I Mr. Laymance has stated that if English
'â â  gets Into the fight he might not go to the
Klondike until after the ronvention. Mr.
Moffltt adheres to his avowal to keep out
altogether, and Mr. Bfosnahan, as a good
Democrat, would, 'â :' court â . favor any
Alameda County man who had a good
show of being elected.
These Stalwarts have generally run
Di mocratic affairs in this county, but
there are others. \V. W. Foote may have.
t" be consulted. He has never b^en a
partisan of the English family, having
opposed W. D, English for Governor eight
years ago and warren It. English tor
Congressman more recently. Foote lias
many admirers in this county who would
like to see him make a fight for the Dem
ocratic nomination for Governor. But
; their desire is not likely t*> be gratified.
Another factor In Aiameds Democratic
! politics is the Silver party leaders. George
I \V. Baker, the head and front of the
1 party, is a resident of Oakland, and as
there is some likelihood that the Df-mo
1 crats may seek fusion this fall with any
1 thing that will strengthen them, Mr.
I Baker becomes a character of no small
Importance In the general situation.
Baker, it is said, would favor either
Foote or English, notwithstanding the
fact that English s brother, William D.,
w.is a pronounced gold bug In 1896.
"I can truthfully say." exclaimed Mr.
Baker recently, "that there are Englishes
and Englishes, and Warren English Is a
good enough silver man for William J.
Bryan, and that satisfies me."
There is still another element in the
Democracy to be considered: It is the
farmer element in the lower end of the
county. But it is said that they will not
Stand In the way of a home candidate. !
After all its defeats nnd its chagrin over
the fusion part of ICPO.1 C PO. it now looks as if
the Alameda Democracy is not to remain
dormant in 1898.
SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLD
VICTIM OF GAS
SAD DEATH OF PRETTY GRACE
PEARSON.
She Retired as a Happy Child, but
Left the Gas Burning, and She
Never Awoke Again.
Pretty Grace Pearson. 16 years old. was
found dead In her bed yesterday morning,
a victim to the deadly fumes of Illuminat
ing gas.
The deceased was a domestic in the
family of B. Getz, at 119 Frederick street.
Last Tuesday night she visited her moth
er at the lodging house kept by the latter
at 119 Fifth street, a curious coincidence
In numbers, by the way. The young girl
Beemed to be happy and In the best of
spirits and chatted merrily and played the
piano. Before she left for the home of
her employer she made an engagement to
spend next Sunday with her mother.
At a quarter of 6 o'clock yesterday
morning Mr. Getz called her, but receiv
ing no reply called In a neighbor and
forced the door. They found the girl dead
and the room full of the fumes of Illumi
nating gas.
Dr. J. C. Williamson was called In, and

after an examination of the body gave It
as his opinion that life had been extinct
for several hours. There was no indica
tion whatever that the girl had committed
suicide, everything in the room being in
its accustomed condition, and the win
dows not having been stopped up, which
would- have been the case if the girl had
taken her own life. The gas burner in the
room was turned Â«cm at full force, from
which fact the inference is drawn that the
deceased went to sleep with the gas burn
ing and that the pressure decreased suf
ficiently during the night to extinguish
the 'flame and then resumed its normal
pressure, filling the room with the poison
ous fumes. She was the only child of
Mrs. Pearson.
An Inquest will be held.
Vote against the r>ew char

RAILROAD COMMISSION
POSTPONES ACTION
Contempt Proceedings Against Hunt
ington and Pillsbury to Be Heard
Next Month.
The State Board of Railroad Commis
sioners will take no action in the con
tempt proceedings against Collis P. Hunt
lngton and his attorney, E. S. Pillsbury,
until after the question of the board's
Jurisdiction and the right of a Superior
Court Judge to enjoin the commission
has been decided. At the meeting of the
commission held yesterday morning it
â was decided to postpone further action In
the matter until June 27, at which time
Attorney Pillsbury will have completed
his business In the East and will be able
to appear before the commission in the
contempt matter. In the meantime the
Commissioners will seek the counsel of
the Attorney-General concerning the
power of the Superior Court to interfere
with the acts of the board.
Â» m â 
Vote against the new charter
because it provides that amend
ments must be voted on at spe
cial elections. (Article 3, sec
tion 22, chapter I.) This
causes unnecessary expense
and deprives the masses of a
chance to vote. Experience
shows that only persons per
sonally interested vote at spe
cial elections.
ing a base. The Oaklands then declared
that the ball touched Held after leaving
the bat, and was, therefore, a 'dead ball,'
in -which case the base-runners would not
be permitted to advance a base. Umpire
Ferguson, however. ruled differently,
maintaining that it was a fair ball." Now,
if it was a fair ball and Held interfered
with it, he should have been called out
and both runners compelled to remain
where they were.
Not knowing how the play really oc
curred it is rather difficult to decide who
was in the wrong. Both sides, however,
admit that the ball touched Held, and
if such be the case Ferguson's ruling was
wrong.
Judging from the many complaints en
tered against .the umpiring received at
Fresno it would be well for President
Bert to look into the matter. The players
especially assort that it is terrible and
nothing will kill the sport Quicker than
a "home" or unfair umpire. In bun
day's game at San Jose the umpire, was
put out of the game. Some of his de
cisions were awful, so the players stato,
and it seems to be the same cry all
through the league. It is certainly very
evident that home umpiring is the craze,
and the sooner the league board takes a
hand in the matter the better Umpire*
should be changed about. Send the Frisco
one to Fresno and vice versa. In this
way umpires will be in strange cities and
Will have to be fair, or take a chance in
losing their lives. This idea of permit
ting an urepire to remain in one place
most of the time is a very bad one. He
can afford to see that his favorite club
gets a little the better of It, and it is a tri
ne difficult to beat the combined forcea or
"team and umpirs." Give us good um
piring and good baseball is bound to rol-
Pitcher Hughes is being touched up a
bit lately and it is no wonder. Here Han
lon has put the brunt of the work on his
shoulders, and I'll wager It is beginning
to tell on the boy. If they are not care
ful Mr. Hughes, in his anxiety to keep
up his great work, will Injure his arm,
and it does'nt take much overwork to ac
complish this feat. Young pitchers, crazy
to do well, are continually hurting them
selves beyond recovery. Hughes is just
at that stage where a little experience
would do him a world of good. But he
lacks this experience, and Hanlon would
not dare give him a rest, with Cincinnati
so far in the lead. Being young and am
bitious he, of course, would not think of
asking to be excused, and unless his arm
is very strong the time will come when a
rest will have to be given him. The simple
fact of his being touched up a bit Is Ol
very little consequence. Every good
pitcher in the league is batted out of the
box once in a while. That is baseball.
In Tuesday's game against Chicago
Hughes was batted out of the box. I
hear people say "Hughes has collapsed.
Not a bit of it. Clark Griffith, one of the
very best pitchers in the world, was also
batted out in the same game. It does not
follow that he has exploded, and the same
holds good for Hughes. Nobody can ever
convince me that he is not a great
pitcher. He will be hit hard occasionally,
like every other pitcher, and he will in
turn win' many games like the rest, but
he is being worked too hard for a young
ster, and there is a possibility of his be
ing unable to stand it
From all accounts. Chance, who recent
ly joined the Chieagos, is not doing as
well as was expected. There is a great

Mr. Russell has made good, and is now ,
considered one of the best pitchers in i
the league. He has the honor of partici
pating in one of the greatest games ever <
held in California, and it was his work
in the box that prevented the "crack
Fresno team from winning last Sunday s
game without a dispute. In fourteen in- ;
nings they connected with his shoots but
seven times, and such work is bordering
on the phenomenal. A great many people
think his pitching as good if not better
than Harney's. aim wnen they meet IE
ought to be a great battle.
Sykes had eighteen put-outs in faun
day's game, and is playing- the first bag !

The Santa Cruz team Is having the ;
hardest kind of luck. Sunday s defeat
at the hands of the Gilt Edges makes
four successive knockdowns, the last two
games beinjf lost by one run. Had they
played ball in Saturday's game at Kecre

no doubt that they would have won
On two different occasions, with a man
on third base, did a runner steal second
without even an attempt to score by tne

to permit a catcher to throw clear to
second base in the hope of catching *

make an attempt to score. If the pla>
was to catch him, of course, it is always
proper to remain there, but when it is

the only way to play, their chances of ,
winning out were excellent In endeav
oring to steal home from third on a throw |
to second players should bear in mind
that on account of the closeness of the ;
play the throw to second and return
must be perfect. The play being a roped
one, the chances are in favor of a poor
throw, and for such a reason it is al
ways best to take the chance. The same
holds good on a throw from the outfield.
If a runner is on there he should remem
ber that the chances of a poor throw
are always in his favor, especially from
the outfield, and should try more often
to score on fly hits to the outfield. L>on t

BUTCHERS
MAKE MERRY
Annual Picnic at Shell
Mound Park.
HUNDREDS IN ATTENDANCE
RACING A FEATURE OF THE
AFTERNOON PROGRAMME.
The Outing Is Characterized by En
joyment, Festivity and a Sur
prising Lack of an Un
ruly Element.
OnÂ© of the most successful picnics ever
held by the butchers of the city was that
given under the auspices of their board
of trade yesterday at Shell Mound Park.
At least 15,000 people were In attendance
and the park, and the race track oppo
site presented a combined scene of fes
tivity and enjoyment. There was not
even an Indication of an unruly element
to disturb the pleasure of the day and
everything progressed smoothly and ter
minated with the general impression that
it was an enjoyable success.
Preparatory to departure for the picnic
grounds an immense parade of hundreds
of butchers, clad in the uniform of their
profession, formed on this side of the bay
and marched down the principal streets
Of the city to the ferry. The line of
march extended :': un the place of forma
tion on O'Farrell and Stockton streets to
Market street, thence to Sixth, with a
counter march to Kearny to California
and then direct to the depot. As column
alter column of the white bedecked wield
ers of the cleaver and the saw passed
through the business portion of the city,
the momentary impression was that
Uncle Sain had again called for aid and
was sending off his volunteers in a new
ly devised uniform and martial equip
mentâthe sword and musket being su
perseded by the cleaver ami the meat ax.
One of the features of the parade was a
Bhip's bell fittingly decorated with the na
tional colors, li was inscribed: " Admiral
Dewey. Tins bell was first rung at the
Pacific Mall dock on the departure of the
first California United States Volunteer
Infantry Regiment, which left San Fran
cisco on board the City of ivkiny for the
Philippine Islands, May 23, 1898. Remem
ber the Maine." The patriotic emblem,
xhibition of N. C. Whyte and L.
Derome, attracted much attention and
heart) cheering rlo;.k the line.
At the front of the parade ar.u. in ract.
leading It, were a number of mammoth
bi -. decorated with red, white and
blue ribbons and looking almost as pa
triotic as the sturay vaqueros who were
seated on their barks and directing them
with guiding lin
Following in the wake of the proces
sion were hundreds of people laden with
hampers, telescope baskets and every
-.abb- contrivance for carrying theirs
picnic lunches. â¢
The boat carrying the picnickers left
the ferry at 9:30 o'clock In the morning
and when it arrived with its merry
freighi on the opposite Bide It was found
ssary to charter two additional train*
i ommodate the hundreds of un
looked-for guests who were unable to ob
tain standing room cither in the regular
picnic train or the local to Berkeley.
Once at the park formality, if any ex
aside and as the thou
- of pleasure-seekers passed through
the old portal of Shell Mound it was
with the understanding that for once ltÂ»
the year grim care was to be brushed
and in substitution the god of mer
riment and jollity was to hold sway.
In th" dance hall, which afforded as
usual the main attraction, both for the :
rising and falling generation, was one
continual and uninterrupted scene of color
ar.d lolly good humor. Those who were
nol well versed enough in the terpsicho
rean art did the best they could and
adapted their own conception of the light
fantastic to the tune of the "Hot Time"
and other popular melodies, which were
handed down with a surprising liberality
and profusion by the specially engaged or
chestra.
One of the surprising features of the
outing was a total lack of the pugnacious
element, and the few altercations and
hand to hand conflicts that did rise un
bidden to disturb the serenity of the gen
eral scene were fought and decided gener
ally by the wielders of the scrubbing
brushes.
The canteen, although patronized, was
not done so to excess, there consequently
being no prevailing indication that Bac
chus was an unusual favorite.
One of the chief enjoyments of the day
â¢was afforded by the racing at the Oak
land trotting track, immediately opposite
the picnic grounds. There, from 1 o'clock
until nearly 7, at least 15.000 people wit
nessed the rendition ,of a well-arranged
programme of bicycle, horse and steer
racingâ many of the horse races being run
by blood horses.
In the ninth race, called the vaqueros'
running race, there whs entered one of
Hobart s pedigreed "bobtails," shipped to
the city for the purpose of winning the
stake, and incidentally showing the cat
tle-herders that their horses were degen
erate, nags incapable of assuming even a
Blight claim to speed on a well beaten ',
track. Although bets were cast freely on ;
the Palo Alto production the "noble Ro- |
man" came in on the tail end of the pack,
and barely saved his reputation by beat
ing the last horse by a nose. The races
run were as follows:

Raw Sore From Finger to Palm.
Physicians and Medicines No
Avail. Cured by Cuticura.
When my little boy was two years of ago,
dry spots commenced to appear on different
parts of his body. Last winter it seemed to go
to his hands, and I was obliged to keep his
first three fingers done up all the time, as It
was a raw sore, beginning to extend down to-
ward the palm of the hand. "We consulted three
different physicians, each a certain length of
"time, to see a benefit of their medicines. I
think now, after using Cdticura, that some
of the salves that I used did more injury than
good. A gentleman (who sat next to me In
church) asked me the matter with my boy's
hand. I took off one of the cloths and showed
him, he told me he had been in a hospital in
Boston, where for all skin diseases they used
Coticcba Remedies. I immediately pur-
chased Cdticcra Soap, Citicura (oint-
ment) and Cutiouba Resolvent, put aside
what I bad been using, and began with them.
"Well ! they aired that hand. 1 was afraid that
this winter it would break out again, but no,
it is all cured, and I have not bad to have a
dJth on it this winter. Mrs. DIAMOND,

PRESIDENT JORDAN AND
THE NEW CHARTER
XASMIN HOUSE,
Stanford University.
I believe that the chief
cause of the failure of mu
nicipal government in the
United States lies in the
conversion of the public
service into patronage to
be distributed among per
sonal favorites and parti
san workers. The pro
posed charter of San Fran
cisco perpetuates this con
dition of the distribution
of patronage by individuals
and cliques. It therefore
offers mighty little prom
ise of reform, either in ef
fectiveness or in economy.

Accidentally Drowned.
John Klllackey, who was employed In a
saloon at the corner of Pacific and East
streets, fell into the bay at the Pacific
dock last evening and was drowned before
aid could reach him. He had taken some
sawdust down to the wharf to dump it
into the water, and it is supposed that he
lost his balance and fell in accidentally.
The man was taken from the bay by C. B.
Moore, a watchman at the dock, and Sam
Edgar, and was alive when pulled from
the water, but he died a few moments af
ter he was placed on the wharf. Killackey
was a Frenchman, 58 years old, and had
no family. >â ' _
Christopher A. Buck
ley has arrived in San
Francisco and is actively
engaged in working for

TELEGRAPH EXTENSIONS.
Western Union Connects Seattle With
Victoria, B. C, by Cable and
Overland Lines.
The Western Union Telegraph Company
ban made some extensive and Important
additions to its Northwestern service, and
has conno^t^d Seattle with Victoria, B. C,
via Port Townsend and Port Angeles in
Washington, by means of overland lines
and a submarine cable crossing Puget
Sound. The cables have all been laid
and offices have been opened at the places
mentioned.
The cable, which Is of the single armoi
type, with three conductors, crosses the
Sound from Seattle, across Elliott Bay to
West Seattle and from thence to Port
Blakely. Several land lines have been
established on the intermediate islands.
The cable across the Sound is eight miles
In length and the overland line then runs
along the shore from Port Blakely to
Port Townsend, connecting at Port Madi
son, Port Gamble, Port Ludlow and Haa
lock. The distance from Seattle to Port
Townsend by this line is fifty-seven miles.
The line, still running overland, runs
along forty-seven miles to Pt>rt Angeles
at which point another cable has been
laid a distance of sixteen and a half
miles across the Straits of Juan de Fuca
to Albert Head, on Vancouver Island.
From that point there are thirteen milea
of land line to Victoria City, thus mak
ing the extension in all nearly 134 miles
in length, which has cost over $60,000 to
build. The Importance of the improve
ment can be readily seen, as it gives di
rect telegraphic communication with the
British possessions, and the results will
be invaluable.

THE SAT* FBA^CISCO CALX., THTJBSDAY, MAT 26, 1898.
Police Lieutenant Burke on Bernal
Heights two months ago, is progressing
rapidly. The jury was completed yester
day during the morning session arid in
the afternoon testimony was taken. After
maps and photographs had been identified
Alfred Hopkinson, the most important
witness for the prosecution, was placed
on the stand. H>- proved an interesting
witness. Ife reiterated the story of the
killing and the subsequent difficulty be
tween himself and the murderer. Ac
cording to his testimony the witness was
running most of the time and did not see
Lieutenant Burk<- snot. After he had
concluded his testimony the case went
over until this morning.
PREFERRED TO BE HANGED.
Convict H. W. Daggett Did Not Want
a Life Sentence.
H. W. Daggett, who on April 1 last took
Rachel Costley, a girl 13 years of age,
from this city to Stockton on the pre
tense that he had secured her a position,
and assaulted her on the Way, was found
guilty by a jury in Judge Cook's court
yesterday. After the verdict of the jury
had been read, Daggett, through his at
lorney, waived time, and was sentenced
to forty years in Folsom Prison.
Prior to passing sentence, Judge Cook
remarked that the minimum sentence the
law permitted for the crime of which
Daggett was convicted was twenty-five
years, and as the case of the prisoner at
bar appeared from the evidence to be a
[particularly brutal one he was not dis
posed to be as lenient as the law.
Here the prisoner asked permission to
say a few words, and the request was
granted. The. trembling convict rose
from his seat and, addressing the court,
said: "Your Honor, if you intend to sen
tence me to prison for life I would prefer
that you pass the death sentence on me.
I would rather he. hanged than spend my
last days in prison." Here he faltered,
and then sat down. Judge Cook then
sentenced him to forty years in Folsom
Prison. As the convict is now past 3rt
years of a ere. it is not likely that he will
escape the fate he so dreads, as forty

Alvin Schroeder, Who Has Plaued With the Kneisel
Quartet for Thirteen Years.
Alvln Schroeder is pronounced by the best music lovers In America and
Europe one of the most wonderful cellists who ever handled the bow. He
has played with the Kneisel Quartet for thirteen years, and Is regularly con
nected with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He and Franz Kneisel, Otto
Roth and L. Svencski comprise the cfne quartet that plays with an en
semble such as has never been heard before on the Pacific Coast. In London
they were welcomed every summer season, and it is only this year that they
dared to tackle the "wild and woolly W>st." The Kneisels will play ihis
afternoon at the Sherman-Clay Hall and the programme will include Dit
tersdorf'B quartet in E fiat major, Beethoven's variations in his quartet in A
major, op. 18. and Dvorak's quartet, op. 96, in F major. Schroeder's 80103
will be the "Waldearuho" by Dvorak and Klengel's "Capprlcio."
j years of his life, working in the guarded
j quarries on the banks of the American
| River, is as much if not more than the
| ordinary mortal can stand.

Vote against the new charter
because section 1 of article 7,
chapter 1, empowers the Board
iof Education to discontinue
public schools. This provides
a way for dismissing teachers
and recreating their places.

OLYMPIC CLUB OUT
FOR RETRENCHMENT
PROFESSORS WATSON AND BEH
LOW RETIRED.
Rumors Afloat That the Changes Are
Only the Opening Weds^e for
a Big Revolt Among
Members.
Members of the Olympic Club will be
greatly surprised to learn that Professor
Walter "Watson, who has, during the past
thirteen years, taught the art of boxing
to such clever exponents as Corbett and j
Green, and Professor Hugo Behlew, the
popular teacher in gymnastics, have been
asked for their resignations.
This move on the part of the board of
managers is said to be for purposes of
retrenchment, but many are of the opin- j
ion that when it tries to retrench by dis- I
charging two of its best teachers it will
prove costly in the end.
Their resignations do not go into effect
until the latter part of this month, but
already prominent business and profes
sional men are appealing to the board in
the hope that the professors will be kept I
in their present positions.
While the prominent members are work-
Ing, the less prominent are murmuring \
In disapprobation of the course being pur- I
sued by the managers. It is the younger j
element that makes up the bone and
sinew of the organization, and they feel ,
that the managers have not consulted
their wishes when they discharge such !
good men. They have trained under the i
watchful eyes of both, been taught the
rudiments of self-defense and turning and ,
having profited by such teachings are
very much opposed to their being let out. i
As yet the murmuring of discontent is i
mild, but when the day comes for leave
taking It is thought that it will give way
to unstinted criticisms.
