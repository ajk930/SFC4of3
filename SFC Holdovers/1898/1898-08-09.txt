VOLUME L.XXXIV.-NO 70.
PICKING THE FAVORITES
Opinions From Vari
ous Parts of the
State.
Wishing to secure for the benefit of the public a comprehensive
consensus of opinion as to the sentiment in the State regarding
the popularity of the several Bepublicans who have been promi
nently mentioned in connection with the gubernatorial nomination,
The Call addressed the following telegram to the editors of the vari
ous Republican and independent newspapers throughout the State:
"Following are the names most prominently mentioned for Gov
ernor:
"Henry T. Gage. George C. Pardee, L. R. Ellert, L. H. Brown,
Thomas Flint Jr., W. R. Davis, J. H. Dickinson, Charles N. Felton
and George A. Knight.
"In order to ascertain Republican sentiment throughout the State
we ask you to telegraph us your unbiased opinion as to which of
these candidates is strongest in your locality.
"Which, in your opinion, would be the strongest In the State P
"Also express second choice of your locality."
In reply to this request 115 replies were received. They are given
here in full, and they furnish the first and only obtainable indica
tion from which to draw a conclusion as to the popularity of the va
rious aspirants to gubernatorial honors.
A careful study of the replies made
to The Call's query reveals a condition
of things that will no doubt prove to
mething of a surprise to those who
.'have watched the trend of events in
the race for gubernatorial honors. The
list will also furnish an object lesson
that cannot fail to be of value to those
wrfto are actively interested In the con
â  test.
: -Gage of Los Angeles heads the list
first choice candidate, with Secre
tary of State Brown a close second in
t mp list. A glance at the accom
rn-nying table will show the number of

. A comparison of the returns so far
as they apply to Gage and
v&rawn show that Brown is
by . far the strongest candidate. The
editors who have given Gage their
â¢preference are for the greater part res
idents of the southern portion of the
This may account for their
preference for a southern man. The
fact that he has only been mentioned
five times as second choice also seems
â¢Xo' indicate that he is not considered
â¢ even as a compromise candidate by
' more than two-thirds of those who have
Vent in replies.
â¢Twenty-two editors have signified
their preference for Brown as first
choice and fifteen others name him as
their- second choice for Governor. It
â 'm:I11 also he seen that his popularity
.is not .confined to one section of the
frUate. The same can be said of Flint
and Ellert, both of whom show great
strength in almost every portion of the
. State.
The list of replies shows, if it shows
anything, that the candidacy of Gage
is not popular with more than one
thirV! of the Republican vrrters of the
State. It iilso shows that his popularity
js ' 'jitined to a portion of the State

of th" Republican party is in the north

at the polls in November a northern
man must be selected to head the

thus far in this section of the State. In

tion for Governor, Senator Thomas Flint Jr. is the strongest in this sec
tion, and should be equally as strong throughout the State, owing to the
fact that his public career has been a clean and honorable one. As this
will be California's Jubilee year it is fit and proper that her executive of
ficer for the first time in her history should be a native of the Golden State,
apparently there is no second choice for Governor in this section.

Call: No decided preference for a Re

Brown, who has proven so efficient as
Secretary of State, a position which fits
him for the higher place on the ticket.

the candidate loyal support.

REPUBLICAN SUCCESS ASSURED.
VALLEJO, Aug. B.â Editor Call: Re
publican sentiment in Solano County
is for A. J. Buckles for Supreme bench.
Same sentiment recognizes great
strength in each and all of prominent
candidates mentioned for Governor and
further fact that any one of them can
lead Republican party to success in this
year of Republican achievement. That
party principle from which comes good
government, that gave us a McKinley
for President, will give California a
Republican Governor and from the list
of honorable gentlemen named no mis
take can be made in securing a leader
who will bring to us Republican vio
tory. Polano is ready to fall in linÂ«

â  Court he resided in this section pÂ»nd is
. known to many of our people, arj in
.fact, is looked upon as a Soljffioite.
For a second choice any of the gentle

FROM SONOMA COUNTY.
HEALDSBURG, Aug. B.â Editor Call:
The undoubted choice of this locality
for Governor is W. R. Davis. He was
raised in Sonoma County and the rec
ord of his later years of life passed in
Alameda County is such that without
question the Republicans of Sonoma
County and her voters generally irre
spective of party would rally to his
Bupport if he is chosen as the standard
bearer of the party. As to second
choice there is a wide difference and no
definite ideas have been formed. L. H.
Brown or L. R. Ellert would probably
be second choice. F. W. COOK,

Call: It is hard to determine the sen
timent of this locality as to which of
the numerous candidates you mention
for Governor is strongest here as there
has been but little expression of opin
ion favoring any particular candidate.
I believe I voice the sentiment of Sierra
County Republicans by saying that we
favor the nomination of a man for Gov

who has marked ability and is con

publican principles has never been
questioned.

RED BLUFF, Aug. B.â Editor Call:
Opinion here has not concentrated upon
any one of the candidates for Gover
nor who has yet been proposed. None
of those mentioned can claim any fol
lowing to speak of in Tehama County.
L. R. Ellert is looked upon here as a
strong man and as an able man and
should the delegates from this county
vote disinterestedly he would probably
get the preference. Dr. Pardee is fre
quently spoken of in connection with
the Governorship and has some sup
port here. In the list of names that
has been presented these two men
seem to be strongest In this section.

Call: The delegation to the Republi

probably go unpledged and unbiased,

here, but there is no fixed sentiment
for either of pronounced partisanship.

SAN DIEGO WANTS THE SENATOR
SAN DIEGO, Aug. B.â Editor Call:
Henry T. Gage at present seems to be
the choice of the Republicans here for
Governor, with George A. Knight a
strong second. Knight In my opinion
is the strongest Republican in the
State for Governor. The Republicans
of San Diego are unanimously in favor
of I*. S. Grant for United States Sena
tor and W. R. Guy f^r Attorney Gene
ral. The Grant element is in favor of
giving the nomination for Governor to
the north. D. O. MCCARTHY,
Editor San Diego Vidette (Ind.).
ADMIRE BROWN'S RECORD.
YUBA CITY, Aug. B.â Editor Call:
General sentiment here is in favor of
L. H. Brown for Governor on account
of his good record in public office, his
unexcelled capabilities for that posi
tion and being clear of combinations,
cliques and bosses. Think him by far
the strongest candidate mentioned
both in this county and State as direct
people's choice. Second choice rather
hard to estimate, but probably would
be W. R. Davis.

SENTIMENT IN LOS GATOS.
LOS GATOS, Aug. B.â Editor Call:
Not much talk here about Governor

MARIN COUNTY HAS A MAX.
SAUSALITO, Aug. B.â Editor Call:
Marin County strongly favors the can
didacy of General John H. Dickinson
for Governor. In the first place, his
services to this section as a legislator
have been numerous and important and
have earned a grateful remembrance.
In the second place, apart from all local
considerations, we consider him head
and shoulders superior to the other
competitors on the Republican side of
the house. In experience, capacity,
thorough knowledge of government and
of the needs of the State, he is equipped
as no one else is who has been men
tioned in connection with the high ->f
fice. Besides, the people of Marin think
it about time that Northern California,
and especially the section around the
bay of San Francisco, was being" con
sidered. It is twenty years since we
have had a Governor in touch wiLh us.
Los Angeles furnished three Governor:}
in succession â Stoneman, Waterman
and Markham. Budd is closer to the
south than he is to the north. Noth
ing but plenty of nerve could inouce
the statesmen below Tehachapi to ask
for another turn at the wheel. North
ern California wants a chance this time
and Dickinson is the man of Alarm
County's choice. No candidate other
than the general is mentioned here. In
fact, it is Dickinson first, last and all
the time. J. H. PRYOR,

AN INSANE GIRLS
ATTEMPT AT SUICIPE
Harriet St. John, a young girl whose
mind in deranged, sat on a doorstep at
2230 Mission street last evening and tried
to end her existence by swallowing forty
grains of phenacetlne. A passing police
man found her in a semi-conscious con
dition. He hurriedly rang in for a pa
trol wagon, and while it was en route
the unfortunate girl was removed to a
photograph gallery, where she was re
lieved of her overdose of headache dow
der by Dr. Griffiths.
Shortly after .she regained conscious

for the Insane, adjoining the Receiving
Hospital, where she will be detained un
til her mental condition can be inquired

Some years ago Miss St. John was an
Inmate of a private institution at Liver

some time was discharged as cured. Im
agining that her old trouble was return

the agonies of an insane asylum.

himself at Jena as a private tutor for the
Egyptian language and antiquities, and
in {m he was called as professor to Lelp-

from his scientific services, his thesis on
obtaining the decree of doctor "On the
Twenty-sixth Egyptian Dynasty." and
his larger work ..''n-'EKypt.-In.l the Books

in discovering the Papyrus E, which was

ALL DEPENDS ON
MADRID'S REPLY
Special Dlppatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Augr. B.â The Wash ing
ton correspondent telegraphs to the
Herald: If Spain's reply when pre
sented be not satisfactory orders will
be given Admiral Sampson directing
the departure of his squadron <>n its
mission to the coast of Spain. Simul
taneously with its departure from
Guantanamo an auxiliary fleet consist
ing of colliers and supply ships con
voyed by the auxiliary cruiser Yosemlte
will leave Hampton Roads for a ren
dezvous which has been designated.
The Minneapolis, which has been un
dergoing repairs at Newport News, has
not been assigned to the Eastern
squadron up to this time and unless
the department should further reinforce
Admiral Sampson's command she will
not proceed to the east. Whether or
not orders have been given the Minne
apolis the authorities decline to state,
but it is probable that any further ser
vice she will perform in the present
war will be confined to the Cuban and
Porto Rlcan waters.
After the destruction of Admiral
Camara's command, if that should be
found necessary, a portion of the fleet
will continue on its way to Manila. In
administration circles it is believed
that before it passes through the Suez
canal Spain will have come to her
senses and a thorough appreciation of
the situation and will accept the terms
which the President will dictate. In
any event, as the Herald has stated,
reinforcements will be sent to Admiral
Dewey and the number of ships that
will be assigned to his squadron will
depend to a great extent upon the situ
ation as it exists after the destruction
of Camara's command.
SPAIN NOT DISPOSED

LONDON, Aug. 9.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Times says: The

Speculation as to Day's
Successor.
MANY NAMES ARE DISCUSSED

TO HAVE FIRST CHOICE.
The President Has a High Opinion
of the Diplomat and Will
Probably Give Him the
Portfolio.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. B.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Secretary Day's coming retirement
from the Cabinet which was announced
this morning has been the source of
much discussion here to-day and the
Secretary and other members of the
administration have been much ques
tioned about It. Secretary Day had
nothing to say about it, but other mem
bers of the Cabinet have confirmed all
that was published. The question of
his successor divides interest with the
question of the commission to treat
with Spain for the final treaty of peace.
Many names are under discussion, but
the President has not yet indicated
even to the members of his Cabinet
that he has decided who will succeed
to the head of the Cabinet. Erabassa
dor Hay is one of the men most freely
mentioned, and his selection is con
sidered in well-informed circles to be
quite probable. He is from Ohio, the
State which has held the State De
partment portfolio in President Mc-
Kinley's Cabinet up to this time, and
he has ample means, a desirable quali
fication in a man who must on account
of his official position entertain freely
during the social season.
The President, too, has a high opin
ion of his ability and accomplishments.
Secretary Day is to serve on the com
mission to negotiate a treaty of peace.
Affer that he may go back to Canton
to practice law. He may, however, be
given a judicial position by the Presi
dent, being appointed either to the
Circuit bench or to the Supreme Court
should a vacancy occur.
GREAT DESTITUTION
UP AT ST. MICHAEL
Many Men Who Started During the
Bush for Gold Are Now Beg

VICTORIA. B. a, Aug. B.â The
steamer Nordenskjold arrived this
evening from St. Michael without pas
sengers, some trouble which the cap
tain and officers refuse to talk of hav
ing caused them to refuse passengers.
She brings news that the Progreso is
about to start back and was expected
to sail two days after the Nordenskjold
sailed with the majority of the passen
gers who went up on her. They are
starving, and many of them are going
around begging for food from other
steamers. There is much sickness on
board.
A meeting was held on July "23, when
some talk was made among the pas
sengers of seizing the steamer, but
finally arrangements were made where
by the cargo was landed and an agree
ment made to bring the unfortunates
back.
The National City passengers have
settled their difficulties and have been
landed.
The purser of the Nordenskjold re
ports that on July 13 his ship, while In
Bering Sea, passed a large quantity of
wreckage with oil cases, salmon and
whisky cases and heavy timbers. Most
of the wreckage was apparently from
a whaler. While in Resurrection Bay
on July 16 he found fifteen shipwrecked
men who had lost their schooner. They
w<^re destitute, but he says he could
not take them. About twenty miles
from this point he says about 200 men
were working a quartz mine and get
ting pood results. A San Francisco
schooner was lying In the harbor with
supplies for them.

SPAIN'S REPLY
OF ACCEPTANCE
AT WASHINGTON
Prospect That the Dogs HÂ°pe to
GaiQ Some Minor Coo
cessions.
But if There Is Unnecessary Delay the United
States Will Increase ttye Vigor of
the War.
NEW YORK, Aug. B.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: Spain's reply to the peace
propositions of the United States was
received at the French Embassy this
afternoon, and President McKinley ex
pects it will be presented to him by
Embassador Cambon to-morrow. Pres
ident McKinley and Secretary Day be
lieve this reply Is an acceptance of the
terms proposed by the American gov
ernment as the basis of peace negotia
tions, and the war is accordingly prac
tically at an end.
Though believing that peace is as
sured, the administration is fully pre
pared to carry on the war should
Spain's reply be the rejection of the
terms proposed, or should it insist upon
substantial modifications of those
terms the President will break off ne
gotiations, the Eastern squadron will
be dispatched to Spanish waters under
command of Admiral Sampson, the war
will be prosecuted with the greatest
vigor in Porto Rico and the Philip
pines, and the organization of a gTeat
army of invasion for the Havana cam
paign will be puehed forward.
So thoroughly convinced is the Presi
dent, however, that the Spanish reply
will be an acceptance of the terms pro
posed in all their essential details th.-.t
he is giving a great deal of attention
to the composition of the commission
which will represent the United Suues
in the final negotiations for peace. The
President has already decided that
there shall be five representatives of
each country on the joint commission.
He realizes that Spain will put forward
her ablest men to negotiate with the
Americans and endeavor to save some
remnants of the wreck of the Spanish
colonies and he is anxious to have the
United States represented by the best
men he can select. The men most
seriously discussed have practically all
been mentioned. Two men as to whose
selection there seems little if any
doubt are Secretary Day and Senator
Allison. There will, it is now under
stood, be at least one member of the
Supreme Court on the commission and
Justices Harlan and Brown are being
considered. Another name that is be
ing discussed in administration circles
to-day is that of Senator Gorman of
Maryland.
WASHINGTON, Aug. B.â The reply
of the Spanish Government to the
peace conditions laio down by the
United States was received by the
French Embassador, M. Cambon,
shortly before 3 o'clock this afternoon.
The reply came in sections, the dis
patch first received giving only the
opening passages of the Spanish reply.
A few minutes later came a second sec
| tion.and they kept coming uninterputedly
by a procession of messengers until
seven sections of the Spanish reply had
been received at ten minutes to 4, when
the last part was scheduled to arrive.
In the meantime the cipher experts
were at work, and by 4:30 o'clock they
were abreast of all portions of the re
ply received up to that time, and there
was a lull of some time pending the ar
rival of the concluding portions. It
was thought a terrific rainstorm which
swept over Washington about 4 o'clock
might have occasioned delay to the re
mainder.
Pending the receipt of the complete
reply no steps were taken to fix a
time foi a conference with the Presi
dent, as the time for that depended
largely upon some of the features of
the reply, and also upon the explicit
instructions concerning the delivery of
the answer which usually accompanies
a document of this solemn character.
The concluding portion of the Span
ish reply was received during the
evening, but it was not until a late
hour that it was deciphered as a whole
and gone over by the Embassador. No
effort was made to communicate it to
the United States Government to-night
beyond a note to Secretary Day, ad
vising him that the document had been
received, but not disclosing Its con
tents. It is probable that the reply
will be delivered to the President be
fore the Cabinet meeting to-morrow,
although no hour has been fixed. There
is complete reticence in all quarters as !
to the text of the reply, but there is
reason to believe it is not an unquali
fied acceptance of the American terms,
but is framed on the theory of accept- j
ing the essentials and trusting to n ,
hoped-for conciliatory spirit on the
part of this Government to moderate
to some extent features which the j
Spanish Government seems to regard j
as unessential.
Pending the official delivery of the \
answer, speculation was rife as to its j
contents. There was little or no fur- I
ther doubt that the length of the reply
meant that Spain had not given a sim
ple and direct affirmative to the Amer
ican conditions. It was evident that
if the reply was an acceptance it was
accompanied by extended discussion
and probably by conditions. This
caused considerable apprehension in of- i
ficial circles here, for while it was felt i
last week that Spain would surely yield
in every particular, it began to be felt
that possibly there might be another ]
period of discussion and possibly an In- i
direct attempt to open up a diplomatic j
exchange on the nature of the terms, j
The prevailing view, however, was that '
the reply was'on Its face an acceptance,
although not such a one as precluded
all possibility of further discussion. All
vital points were believed to be con- !
cededâ the abandonment of Cuba. Porto â 
Rico and the Lndrones, and the estab
lishment of a commission to pass upon
questions relating to the Philippines.
In the carrying out of this pro- |
gramme It was believed that Spain
would seek to secure an understanding ;
on many Incidental points involved, ;
some of them of considerable lmport
! ance. For instance, some doubt waa
! raised as to whether Spain's accept
] ance would be operative until referred
I to and ratified by the Spanish Cortes,
1 and it was understood that the repljr
j might call attention to this condition.
The same condition, it was pointed out,
exists as to the United States, for a
peace treaty requires t>,e ratification of
the Senate to become operative. In
case Spain'? answer discussed these
incidental points there promised to be
wide latitude for controversy and de
lay unless the President and Cabinet
declined to enter the field of discussion.
Late in the afternoon the President
received an indirect intimation that the
Spanish reply would come to the
French Embassy. A Cabinet officer
who was with him at this time said on
leaving:
"The information that has come
from Madrid about the action of the
Spanish Cabinet indicates that the
Spanish have accepted our terms in a
general way, but leaves several ques
tions open that we did not include in
the terms submitted. The communi
cation offering those terms was ex
plicit, specifically stating such points
as would be left open to further nego
tiations. We wiil stand on these
terms."
The administration has not yet given
serious consideration to the personnel
of the peace commission, but it can be
stated that no one not in accord with
I the President's present views as to the
j disposition of the Philippines will be
appointed, and Mr. McKinley favors
j keeping at least Manila harbor and bay
I and sufficient territory around It for its
| support and protection, if not the whole
jof Luzon Island. As to members of
the Cabinet as members of the com-.
mission, there are precedents for their
appointment, notably the treaty of
j Ghent.
Senor Sapasta. when asked to-day by
the correspondent of the Associated
! Press whether there was any truth in the
statement cabled to the United #States
that he had cabled direct to Washington
on the subject of Spain's acceptance of

The offer was favorably regarded, but

AMERICA REGARDED AS
SPAIN'S BENEFACTOR
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted. IS9S, by James Gor
don Bennett.
PARIS, Aug. B.â Le Gaulois places
America in the position of a benefac
tor. It virtually says Spain ought to
be grateful to the Americans; that
when peace has boen made the Span
iards will perceive the piece of good
fortune that has happened them; that
they never would abandon Cuba, and
that America has therefore rendered
them great service in taking it from
them. Le Gaulois hopes "Americana
will not have cause to regret their vic
tories, and that the taste for warlike
enterprises and distant conquests may
not turn them out of the wise path
which has led them along and which
has insured for them fortune, prosper
ity and liberty."
SPAIN'S REPLY MAY
RAISE NEW OBSTACLES
MADRID, Aug. B.â The Liberal this
morning says: "The Government ac
cepts the United States' conditions and
referendum, believing that It is not au
thorized to cede territory without the
vote of the Cortes. If McKinley ob
jects, the Cortes will be convoked this
month. A fresh note from President
McKinley, replying to Spain's reply, is
expected during the course of this
week."
Continuing, the Liberal expresses the
opinion that "certain passages of
Spain's reply may lead to an exchange
of cable messages of a critical nature,
possibly creating fresh difficulties."
HOPES AMERICA WILL
BE MERCIFUL TO SPAIN
PARIS, Aug. B.â The Temps says It
is to be hoped that the noble resigna
tion of Spain will touch the heart of
President McKinley and that he will
consider it honorable to show that the
United States is great and magnani
mous enough to spare the vanquished
enemy, not to abuse its victory and to
desire by the generosity of its acts to
make the treaty with the people they
have learned to respect on the battle
fields a veritable pact of friendship-
It is certain, the Temps adds, that
Spain will be rewarded for her wisdom.
Freed from the Cuban incubus she
will regain energy and vitality and
march with joyful steps toward a
calm and prosperous future.

WASHINGTON, Aug. B.â Surgeon
General Sternberg has received the
following report concerning the con
ditions existing at Santiago. The re
port explains what has been done by
the Medical Department and givÂ«s the
dlsad - under which the de
jiarti:, m Cuba:
TAMPA HEIGHTS. Fla., July 20, ISSB.
âTo the surgeon-general, U. S. a., Wash
ingtonâSir: In view of the recent
charges made affecting the efficient army
medical department at Santiago, and es
pecially with reference to the conditions
prevailing on the hospital transports
Bent north with wounded, 1 have the
honor to submit wic following facts, be
lieving that my position as adjutant to
the chief surgeon of the Fifth Corps and
as the officer in charge of the outfitting
of the hospital transports Iroquois, Cher
okee and Breakwater may possibly give
value to such report.
Drugs, medicines, dressings, instru
ments, tentage and supplies
were loaded on the transports at Tampa
In quantities sufficient to meet the needs
of the Santiago expedition: These sup
plies wore divided upon the various ves
sels, each organization having its own
equipment. While the bulk of the sup
plies was with the organized hospitals,
the regimental equipment was largely
in excess of its needs and was intended
to be called in to supplement, if necessary,
the equipment of these hospitals. The
landing on Cuban soil was made as rap
idly as possible, each organization ac
companied by the medical attendance as
signed to it, and troops were pushed for
ward with no other equipment and sup
plies than could be carried by the sol
diers. Having no means of transporta
tion for even their Held chests, the regi
mental medical officers had absolutely no
resources at their command except such
as were provided by the orderly and hos
pital corps pouches and the first aid
packets carried by the soldiers. Having
onco left their ships the latter were
promptly ordered out of the small bays
.at Siboney and Baiquiri to permit the
unloading of other ships. These par
tially unloaded ships, in obedience to
their orders, then proceeded to sea from
five to fifteen miles, where they remained
hove "to indefinitely.
Such orders were given the transports
carrying the reserve and the first divi
sional hospitals. The one carrying the
reserve hospital, in obedience to its or
â  ders, proceeded to join the naval block
ading squadron off Morro Castle, where
It remained five days and nights, the
other transport disappearing, if I was
'correctly informed, for an entire week.
During this time the fight at Las Guasinas
had occurred and large numbers of sick
and wounded were requiring treatment.
In the meantime a report of the condi
tions prevailing on shore was made to
the chief surgeon, who promptly laid the
case before the commanding general, re
questing that a launch be placed under
the control of the medical department for
the collection of medical supplies from
the various transports. It was also re
quested that a pack train be organized,
in the proportion of one pack mule to
each regiment, to transport suppliesâ
especially the field chestsâ to the front
' for proper distribution; and I was sug
gested by the chief surgeon, as available
for the performance of these duties. The
exigency of the situation did not appar
â  entry appeal to the commanding general,
and "for two days the medical department
v... unable to get transportation of any
kind to the other ships or to the shore,
although there were a large number of
naval launches and boats employed on
various other duties. On the third day,
by order of the adjutant general, one
rowboat was turned over to the medical
department for the purposes above
named, and at the same time an order
â was Issued for land transportation to
carry medical supplies to the front, "not
to exceed one six-mule team." On get
ting into this boat with supplies from the
headquarters transport I was directed by
sundry staff officers to take them on va
rious errands. On my refusal to recog
nize their authority their commanding
general, who had appeared on the scene.
personally revoked the previous order, and
directed, after the landing of the Supplies
already in the boat, that it should return
â¢without delay. Presenting the order for
land transportation to the quartermaster
on shore I was informed that only pack
mules had as yet been landed, that nei
ther wagon nor harness had been brought
ashore, and. finally, that the road was
impassable for wagons. After this boat
had been taken away the chief surgeon
was without any means of communica
tion with the medical officers on shore or
still on transports, of finding out their
wants, or remedying the many already
known to them.
This condition of things remained until
after the fight at L.as Guasinas, at which
time there were absolutely no dressings.
hospital tentage or supplies of any, kind
on shore within reach of the surgeons al
ready landed. The news of the Guasinas
fight being reported to the chief surgeon,
he was finally able to get on board the
Olivette and send her to Siboney, where
she received the wounded. Within the fol
lowing day or so, the transports carrying
the reserve and first divisional hospitals
were found and unloaded of their hospital
contents, the latter hospitals finally ob
taining limited transportation ; to the
front. After ft couple of days' duty on
board the Olivette I was directed to put
the Iroquois in condition to receive pa
tients and to take the full capacity of the
ship on board. While doing this I was
able to set ashore considerable hospital
tentage and supplies found aboard of , her,
and, having control â  of her boats, 'l. was
able to visit other transports in the har
bor and land medical supplies from them.
While subsequently outfitting: the Chero
kee and Breakwater this wurk was con
tinued as well as opportunity and limited
facilities permitted; sotting supplies from
perhaps a third of the transi>urt.s com
posing the fleet. Outside of this it is
believed thai no (Sther regimental medical
property was ever unloaded up to the
time ot my departure with wounded on
July 10.
Appealing on several occasions for the
us,, of a lighter or small steamer to col
lect and land medical supplies, 1 was in
formed "by the Quartermaster's depart
ment that they could render no assistance
in that way, and the medical department
was compelled U> rely entirely upon its
own energies and Improvise it* own
transportation. I feel Justified in saying
that at the time of my departure large
quantities of medical supplies urgently
needed on shore remained on transports,
a number of which were under orders to
return to the United States. Had the
medical department carried along double
the amount of supplies, it is difficult to
see how, with the totally inadequate land
and water transportation provided by the
quartermaster's department, the lament
able condition on shore could have been
in any way Improved) The outfitting of
transports for the reception nf sick and
wounded Is a duty demanding thought and
experience, and should never l".- entrusted
to any one except a regular medical offi
cer. It includes the proper policing of
the portions of the ship to be used by
the wounded, the removal of bunks and
partitions to give space and air, the utili
zation of the ship's blankets, door mats, ,
rugs and carpets to render the bunks
more comfortable, the securing of extra
supplies, such as canned coups., lime Juice
and oatmeal, the establishment of a mess
and laundry and the assignment of con- j
valescents to specific light duties which
materially relieve the overworked hospital \
corps. Usually it is necessary to overcome
passive resistance and opposition on the
part of the crews and a tendency on the j
part of the captains to disregard or modi- j
fy orders.
In several Instances in my own experi
ence this action of the crew amounted al
most to mutiny, and was only to be dealt
with by threats, a show of force, and in j
once instance, by the use of the Irons.
While exclusive officer at the general hos
pital, Fort Monroe, I learned officially i
that the captain of the steamship Seneca
positively refused to obey the orders em- ;
mating- from your office, given him by the i
contract surgeon in charge, to proceed to ;
New York, he remaining- nearly an addi
tional day at Hampton Roads with sick
md wounded and asserting that ip would
jbey no orders given by the medical de
partment. A similar experience of my
â¢wn at Baiquiri, which had to be settled â 
â¢ y force, emphasised the fa ft that no one
should be placed in charge of such a ship !
who is not accustomed to command men
md enforce obedience.
With regard to the Red Cross Society,
It would seem as if the lofty purposes of
this organisation were, on the Santiago
expedition, subverted to individual inter
ests. While at Tampa the Red Cross ship
State of Texas was formally placed under
the control of the chief surgeon. Fifth
Corps, by Dr. Egan, the representative
of the society, he acting under telegraphic
Instructions to that effect. <'olonel Pope
accepted this offer and directed that the '
State >>f Texas accompany the expedition
of General Shafter to its destination. Al
though this order was fully -understood by â¢
Dr. Egan the State of Texas did not ac- :
company the expedition, nor did it arrive
at Sibom-y until the forces had been land- '
cm], a battle fought and our hospitals es
tablished and in working order. The lirst
offers made by this society dealt largely
In generalities and manifested reluctance
to subordinate the organization to the
medical department. Too much praise
cannot be given to the individual efforts
of Dr. L^saerand the Red Cross nurses.
Their work was untiring and unselfish |
and the assistance rendered by them was
of great value.
In conclusion it is desired to emphasize
the fact that the lamentable conditions
prevailing In the army before Santlngo j
were due to th<-> military necessity which
threw troops on shore and away from the
possibility of supply without medicines, ,
instruments, dressings or hospital stores j
of any kind. Yew reÃoeetfullv.

This evening General Shafter supple
mented his first dispatch with a second
one on tho same subject, as follows:
SANTIAGO DE CT'BA, Aug. B.âAdju
tant General of the Army: In connection
With my ti'l'fram of the 3d hist., and the
letter of general officers to me of the
same date. I have the honor to say th;it
since then I have talked with the (..vision
commanders and they join me in saying
that the first report was made so strong
because of the weakened and exhausted
condition of the command, more than 75
per cent of which have been ill with the
very weakening malarial fever, lasting
from four to six days, and whl'h leaves
every man too much broken down to i><>
of any service, and in no condition to
withstand an epidemic of yellow fever. For
strong and healthy regiments oomiiur

cover them and not subject to
hardships and with plenty of nourishing
f<>o<i. the danger. Id my opinion, and that
of the division commanders, would be re
duced to a minimum.
SHAFTER, Major General.
General Shafter speaks in high terms
of Dr. Lagardie, and says he has
worked under the "most disadvan
tageous circumstances." From the day
the forces left Tampa until the present
time ho says that there "have never
been sufficient medical attendants or
medicine for the dally wants of the
command. Three times since reaching
Cuba has the command," he says,
"been almoÃt entirely without medi
cines."
This statement, he says, is made to
him by the medical directors, and on
ono occasion they suggested taking
medicines away from the Spanish hos
pital. , . _
SHAFTEFTS TELEGRAM ON
THE FEVER "ROUND ROBIN"
WASHINGTON, Aug. B.â General Shaf
ter has telegraphed the President regard
ing the publication of the "round robin,"
signed by' the general officers of his com
mand.. 8s follows:
"I can very readily see what intense ex
citement the publication must have occa
sioned; a great deal more than the situa
tion warranted. The situation is greatly
aggravated, from the fact that before any
of the men were taken ill they were thor
oughly exhausted. At least 75 per cent of
the command has been down with mala
rial fever, from which the men recover
very slowly, and are then in no condition
to stand an attack of yellow fever or dys
entery. Placed here now in the condition
in which they were when they came, I do
not believe they would be in any particu
lar danger. The regiment of immunes
that recently arrived is not suffering at
all, and I do not believe it will. The men
can keep out of the sun, are well
clothed and well fed. What put my com
mand in its present condition was the
twenty days of the campaign, when they
had nothing but meat, bread and coffee,
without change of clothes, without any
shelter whatever, and during a period
twice as stormy as it has been since the
surrender. Fresh troops reaching here in
| the middle of August, with good camps,
good water, abundance of tentage â which
they will find here â need not apprehend se
rious danger. I thank you for the high
regard in which you hold my command
and the value of the service they have
rendered. It pays for all the suffering we
have endured. I have referred this to

AN APPEAL TO AID
SICK SPANISH SOLDIERS
LONDON, Aug. S.â Countess Decassa
Valencia, wife of the former Spanish
Embassador to Great Britain, appeals
through the London papers for contri
butions to her fund for the Spanish
sick and wounded. She says:
"An official dispatch from Madrid,
received this evening, gives details of
the alarming increase in Buffering
caused by the war. There are many
thousands lying in hospitals at San Se
bastian, Las Palmas, Santiago de
Cuba and Guantanamo without band
ages or lint or even beds to sleep upon,
owing to Inadequate funds. And there
are many widows and orphans who are
in must urgent need of relief."

SAMPSON GIVEN
CREDIT BY LONG
Secretary Scores the
Critics.
DEFENSE OF THE ADMIRAL
SAYS HIS ORDERS WON THE
SANTIAGO VICTORY.
Deprecates Attacks on the Naval
Commander-in-Chief, Who Has
Simply Discharged His
' Duty.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. B.â The Secre
tary of the Navy has received several
letters violently attacking Admiral
Sampson. To at least one of these
Secretary Long has replied* and a
copy of his reply was furnished for
publication to-night. He does not,
however, make known the name of the
person to whom his reply is addressed.
Secretary Long stoutly defends the
entire course of the admiral since his
appointment to the command of the
North Atlantic squadron. The Secre
tary states that Sampson wan selected
for the command because it was be
lieved that he was especially fitted for
the place.
"He never pushes himself forward,"
says the Secretary to the admiral's
critic, "and when you accuse him of
anything of that sort you do most cruel
injustice to a man who has never
sought favor or applause in any other
way than by the simple discharge of
his duty."
Discussing, evidently, a complaint be
cause the Meet did not capture the har
bor of Porto Rico. Secretary Long says:
"The department, which has very
rarely interfered with the movements
of admirals commanding squadrons,
did, however, make one express order,
and that was that our battle-ships
should not be exposed to the risk of
serious injury from the fire of any
fort."
This order, he adds, was made while
the strong Spanish fleet was in exist
ence, and th<' movement to Porto
Rico was to meet, if possible, the Cer
vera fleet. There was no intention of
taking Porto Rico at that time, with
out the co-operation of the army.
As to the sending of the lleet into the
harbor of Santiago, the Secretary states
that Admiral Sampson was acting un
der explicit orders not to expose his
armored ships to the risk of sinking
by mines.
Secretary Long writes at length of
the arduous duties which have de
volved upon Admiral Sampson as com
mander of the squadron, calling atten
tion to the elaborate instructions which
the admiral had given for the attack
upon the Spanish fleet, should it ap
pear, and he adds that the battle with
Cervera was fought under these or
ders, and that the victory was the con
summation of the admiral's thorough
preparation.
Secretary Long says he can well un
derstand why the friends of other offi
cers should be so enthusiastic and
earnest in their behalf â for he says
every one of them richly deserves the
credit for his glorious work â but he
says he "cannot understand why such
a bitter feeling Is manifested in many
quarters toward Admiral Sampson,
when all these subordinate officers to
him, in their reports, clearly and cor
dially recognized the fact that, although
nt the beginning he was, by orders
from Washington, going to confer with
General Shafter, yet the battle was
fought under his orders and was the
consummation of such thorough prep-
arations."
ThfÂ» Secretary adds: "I can think of
nothing more cruel than the depreca
tion of the merit of the faithful, devot
ed, patriotic commander-in-chlef, phy
sically frail, worn with sleepless vigi
lance, weighed with measureless re
sponsibilities and details, letting no
duty go undone; for weeks with cease
less precautions blocking the Spanish
squadron; at last, by the unerring ful
fillment of his plans, crushing it under
the fleet which executed his command;
yet now compelled in dignified silence
to be assailed as vindictively as if he
were fin enemy to his country. I am
sure that no one more deprecates such
an attack than the officers of the fleet,
commodore, captains and all."

GOLD YET COMES
OUT FROM THE
RICH KLONDIKE
But Conditions at Dawson Are
Now Becoming Most
Alarming.
Deadly Ravages of the Dysentery Among the
Many Thousands of Idle
Men.
JTJNEAU, Alaska, Aug. 4 (by steam
ship Rosalie to Port Townsend, Wash.,
Aug B).â Still the gold continues to
pour out of Dawson. Between sixty
and seventy men have arrived at Dyea
and Skaguay onfy nine days from
Dawson. Only a few sailed for Puget
Sound and home on the Rosalie, the
majority preferring to remain here
and at the Lynn canal towns for a few
clays' rest. The amount of gold dust
brought out by this party is estimated
at about SiriO.OOO, while the drafts in
the side pockets of the fortunate ones
will reach a sum not to exceed $200,
000. It is impossible at this time to give
a complete list of the names, as those
who have come he^e cannot recall
them. The estimate of the amount of
treasure is a conservative one, and
only about twenty in the party have
any treasure. The others are miners
who failed to make a good location and
gold-hunters disgusted and returning
home.
When the crowd comes down from
the pas3es it will be possible to give
a list of the names and more particular
information as to the amount of treas
ure owned individually. Several heavy
sacks are in the Rosalie's safe. The
steamer stayed here only just long
enough to allow some of the old timers
an opportunity to rrreet old friends,
being in, haste to catch high tide at
Wrangei Narrows.
Dysentery is spreading rapidly at
Dawson, and there is almost a panic
: there. Scores are taken down with the
' complaint daily. The hospital is full
to overflowing, and many are aying
down the river or coming out this way
on account of the disease. The cause
is ascribed to the drinking water and
the bad sanitary conditions of Dawson
and the camps. About fifty men have
died in the last thirty days.
No new strikes nre reported. The
country is staked for nearly 100 miles
around Dawson in every direction.
One hundred and fifteen men left
Dawson on the little steamer Ora July
26, about sixty-five got off at the wood
camps along the Yukon and Lewis
rivers. The fact that so many got off
to be employed at the wood camps is
significant for two reasons. It indi
cates that many men who have gone to
Dawson are hard up and are taking
any kind of work they can get. also
that the time from Dawson to Juneau,
with the increase In wood camps and
fuel for the small steamers running
between Lake Bennett and Dawson,
will have a day or two knocked off it.
It is quite possible that one may be able
to go from Dawson to Puget Sound in
ten days and from the Sound to Daw
son in seven days, being favored with
sharp connections between steamers,
before the river freezes next winter.
Under the conditions of a year ago
Dawson wae not nearer than thirty
days either by way of St. Michael or
Juneau. A letter of date of July 25 of
which the following is an extract has
been received in Juneau from George E.
Pilz, an experienced miner. It states
the real situation in Dawson and vicin
ity:
"I was in a boat, and the crowd In it
would not stop anywhere. They were
in too big a hurry to get here, and now
they curse themselves, as there are
nearly 30,000 people in this district. I
send these few lines by one of the boys
coming out, as the Canadian mail is
very poor. There are several thousand
men each on Stewart, Indian, Pelly,
White, Big and Little Salmon and the
Hootalinqua river, and the Lord only
knows how many are below here. I
went out to the diggings and spent a
week. Everything is staked and thou
sands and thousands of claims are lo
cated without a color in them. One has
to lay low and watch his chances. All

Rea Wants to Become a

SATED WITH LOCAL POWER
HAS A CANDIDATE TO SUCCEED
SECRETARY BROWN.
Supervisor Paul P. Austin of Santa
Clara County ' the Â San , : Jose
1 Czar's Choice for a State
Office.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Aug. B.â Supervisor Paul
P. Austin for Secretary of State.
This is "Jim" Rea's wish, and if he
controls the Santa Clara delegates to
the State convention they will be in
structed. Trades will be made to this
end at Sacramento, and those who get
back of Austin for the positio-n on the
State ticket will have a call on the
Santa Clara County delegation in other
matters. For some time Rea has been
figuring on this advancement for Aus
tin, and in the election of the latter he
expects to obtain in State politics the
prestige of more than a mere local boss.
Austin is not a general favorite with
the people of the county and in the
election would probably run behind the
ticket. He is a devout attendant on
Rea, however, and during his terms in
office here has always done the gang's
bidding. He was elected Mayor of the
city and is now a member of the Board
of Supervisors. He was a member of
the appointing board under the new
charter.
Austin is secretary of the Security
Savings Bank and previous this was in
the real estate business. As a monu
ment to his business ability there is
now a pile of unsatisfied judgments re
corded against him in the County
Clerk's office amounting to nearly $30,
000. The unfortunate holders are:
J big claim owners have gone below, as
; water gut short very early. There is no
I work in the mines and but little assess
i ment work and little benoh mining, and
| there are many tenderfeot and hay
! seeders anxious to work for S3 or $4 per
tlv.y. Wages last winter were $15 per
. day. Provisions are very cbeap, lots
j cheaper than <me "an bring them in
for. At White Horse Rapids the mount
j ed police wanted to compel me to take
a pilot at s_'i per day and portage the
j freight. The boat's number was 14,619
at the custom house at Tagish, so that
many have passed there since January
1 last, and lots more have built boats
lower down. I believe none of these
boats average less than two tons of
freight. That is why things are cheap.-
I Everybody who can is getting out and
I they ought to go back to their ranches

Special cable to The rail and the New York

PONCE, Porto Rico, Aug. 7 (by Call-
Herald dispatch-boat to St. Thomas,
D. "W. 1., Aug. 8).â Major-General
Miles' invasion of the island of Porto
Rico is progressing in a highly satis
factory manner. Nothing has taken
place to interfere with the plans finally
decided upon by General Miles, and the
American troops are gaining advanced
ground every clay. This plan of hav
ing the army march upon San Juan
from four directions is regarded here
â¢ as one of General Miles' shrewdest
movements. He has the Spaniards In
complete doubt, and has assigned a
. large enough force under each general
to secure successful resistance against
Spanish attacks. At the same time by
. this plan General Miles speedily will
...have several thousand Spanish troops
shut up in the vicinity of Aibonito un
. ].-=.-: the enemy suddenly changes its
'.' plans and hastens to San Juan over
iht* military road.
. There will be a formidable American
force ready to advance upon the Porto
Hican capital when the troops under
General Henry form a Junction with
those under General Schwan at Are
cfbo. It is probable that much of the
artillery to be used in the siege of San
Juan will be sent to Areclbo by trans
port and taken from there to San Juan
by rail. This will be work easy of ac
complishment, and General Henry and
General Schwan undoubtedly will be
able to form a Junction with other
trodpa as soon as they can march to
the capital.
No opposition is expected by the
American troops in the execution of
this plan. All our men are light
hearted and there is plenty of food for
all. The forage for the horses is ex
cellent.
Genera] Miles Is giving his personal
attention to the management of the
details of the campaign. He intends
to press forward to San Juan regard
TRADE VIEWED
BY A CONSUL
Improvement Shown in
1896 and 1897.
THE IMPORTS AND EXPORTS
SUGAR BEET CULTURE NOW AN
IMPORTANT INDUSTRY.
San Francisco's Shipping and Com
mercial Interests Benefited by
the Klondike Gold Dis
coveries.
Fp<Â«.-Inl Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Aug. B.â The Bureau
of Statistics of the Treasury Depart-
ment has received a single copy of the
report of the British Consul General at
San Francisco and presented to both
houses of Parliament, in which he dis
cusses at considerable length the trade
' and agriculture of California for the
year 1897. From the report The Call
â¢ representative has had an opportunity
to make the following excerpts:
"The year 1597 showed a considerable
Improvement over that of 1896, which in
turn was better than its predecessor.
Bank clearances show an increase of
over $13,000,000, and many of our lead-
Ing products were shipped to Eastern
States in increasing quantity. Exports
of merchandise show a slight gain,
.which would have been materially
augmented had the shipments of wheat
been up to the average. Imports have
increased substantially, demonstrating
the capacity of the people to buy, and
prices obtained* for most of our
products were , satisfactory. The wine
crop of 1897 was the largest in the his
tory of the State, but prices fell to a
point that is unremunerative to the
producer. Sugar beet culture is increas
â¢ ing in California and is llkel 1 "- to be
come a leading industry of the State in
the near future.
' "The Klondike gold discoveries have
proved Of considerable benefit to the
shipping and commercial interests or
San Francisco. The outlook for 1898
was exceedingly bright, but unfor-
t unately California suffered from se
vere drought during last winter, and
in place of the average rainfall of 18 to
20 inches in this city, less than 9
â¢ inches have fallen. The season has
been the driest recorded in twenty-one
years. Â»
â¢ "The establishment of a steamship line
between Valparaiso and San Francisco
is being discussed, and the names of
companies interested are said to be the
' Compania Sud America de Vapor of
Chile and the Pacific Steam Navigation
Company of Liverpool, which at pres
.'ent operate only to the south of Pan
ama. The opportunity for invading
the Northern Pacific la afforded by the
expiration of the agreement with the
Pacific Mail Steamship Company by
which the business north and south of
Panama was divided. One of the ad
vantages to accrue to San Francisco
. if this line is established will be the
opening' of a market for mining ma
â¢ chinery, a trade which has been almost
exclusively enjoyed by Eastern manu
facturers through shipments to South
America via Panama.
'.Shipments of timber show a heavy
decrease as compared with 1896. Great
Britain was the best customer, taking
10,202,496 feet out of a total shipment
of 25,838,155 feet. Prices ruled low dur
lnw the entire year, the supply exceed-
less of the peace negotiations, unless
he receives orders from Washington
for hostilities to cease.
CONSTRUCTING DEFENSES
AT PORTO RICO'S CAPITAL
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett.
SAN JUAN, Porto Rico, Aug. B.â
Troops are busily engaged in construct
ing defenses, although local papers
largely publish rumors of peace. The
greater part of the population of the
city has left for the country, fearing
bombardment. I am unable to obtain
reliable information concerning the
supply of provisions, but there is no
apparent scarcity of food in the city.
In the country districts there is some
distress. The English Consul on his
country estate is feeding 200 persons.
A new Consul will replace Crawford
next week. The Captain General de
clines to grant an interview because of
his important position and his delicate
mission, which prevents him from mak
ing any kind of declaration.
FREEMAN HALSTED.
GENERALS BROOKE AND
MILES IN CONFERENCE
POXCE, Porto Rico, Aug. B.â General
Brooke is here in conference with
Major General Miles. His force is still
at Guayama. A force of about 400 regu
lar Spanish troops are stationed about
eight miles away. The United States
cruiser Montgomery and the hospital
ship Relief have arrived at the port of
Ponce.
TRANSPORT GUSSIE
ARRIVES AT PONCE
WASHINGTON, Aug. B.â The War
Department has received a telegram i
from General Gilmore, of General
Miles' staff, reporting the safe arrival !
at Ponce of the transport Gussie, load- i
ed with ordnance supplies.
Ing the demand, which was very lim
ited on account of the dullness in the
building: trades. The exports of hops
shrank to less than half those of 1896,
but the shipments by rail increased in
a very satisfactory manner. The
amount which left the State was con
sequently considerably greater than in
the year preceding. Prices were emi
nently satisfactory to growers. Brandy
exports were only one-fifth of those of
1896, but overland shipments show a
substantial increase. The prices sym
pathized with those of wine and were
unremunerative. Imports of merchan
dise show a substantial increase of
886,386 pounds as compared with 1896,
and imports of treasure an Increase of
383,575 pounds. The increase in the im
( ports of merchandise was largely owing
Ito the improved trade relations with
Japan and China, and the increase in
treasure is accounted for by the large
amount shipped to this port from Aus
tralia.
"The new tariff, which put a duty
on anthracite coal, is likely to see the
duty interfere with the trade of ship
ping Welsh anthracite to this market.
The total imports of coke in 1897 were
30,320 tons, being 5812 tons less than
in 1896. Of this 257.3 tons came from
British Columbia and 1894 tons from
Australia. These are two new sources
of supply for this market. I under
stand that the plant in British Co
lumbia where some of the above men
tioned coke was manufactured is being
enlarged to double its present capacity,
and it is likely that the imports from
England and Belgium will be affected
by this enterprise as soon as it gets
into running order. The imports of tin
plates show a heavy decline as com
pared with 1896 â 65,418 boxes less than
that year having been received. These
articles are being manufactured in
Eastern States in Increasing quanti
ties and in as heavy consignments are
shipped to this market: they are rapid
ly superseding the imported plates. It
is said they can be laid down here for
$1 per box less than the foreign ones,
and it is only a question of time when
they will entirely displace them. I
understand that the imported article
is now principally used in packing
goods intended for export. In which
case a drawback on the duty is al
lowed."
The British Consul General devotes
much space in the report to the modern
methods of acquiring mining property.
The misfortunes that have befallen the
British mininer investments in Califor
nia are attributed to unbusinesslike
methods in acquiring or working
property, investing in mines that are
fully developed, neglecting to have
them thoroughly examined, sending
out men to manage mines who have
had no practical experience in business,
and the greatest cause of disaster is
the capitalization of such concerns by
London promoters.

ADMIRAL'S REPORT ON THE
SANTIAGO ATTACK.

Special Dispatch Â».o The Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. B.â A good deal
of light Is thrown upon the relations
between the army and navy during
that critical period just preceding the
surrender of Santiago by the following
extracts from Admiral Sampson's re
port, dated July 15, which is now made
public by the Navy Department:
"On July 1 a demonstration was
made by a Michigan volunteer regi
ment at Aguadores under command of
General Duffleld. The New York, Glou
cester and Suwanee moved up, at the
request of the army, to assist in an at
tack, which was to begin at daylight,
Jaut the troops, which came by rail, did
not arrive until 9:20.
"The small river San Juan cuts
through a deep defile and is spanned
by an iron railroad bridge. There is
an ancient fort near the water and on
the hill are the small rifle pits. Some
sixteen or twenty of the enemy had
been counted while the vessels were
waiting for the troops, but they dis
appeared when the ships began firing.
The troops advanced as far as the
bridge. A corner of the fort was
knocked off by the shells of the navy
and the flagstaff was shot away. De
sultory firing was kept up between our
troops and the Spanish, the troops re
turning to Siboney about half past 10
o'clock.
"On the evening of July 1 the admiral
was advised by General Shafter that
the army would assault at daylight on
the 2d, and the navy was requested to
keep up a fire at the batteries on the
bluff. The squadron, consequently,
closed in early on the morning of the
2d and kept up a vigorous fire for two
hours, but the attack proposed by
General Shafter did not take place on
that date.
"On the night of July 10 the Reina
Mercedes was sunk by the Spaniards so
as to obstruct tie ships. Extensive
shore batteries existed and if smaller
vessels had been sunk by the mines or
batteries the harbor would have been
effectually closed against us.
"It was essential to the new scheme
of attack by the combined forces that
the position occupied by the eastern
and western batteries should be car
ried, and this was the scheme of action
first proposed by General Shafter on
the day of his first arrival. It was at
that time explained to him that it was
of primary importance that these
points should first be carried, as their
possession insured the destruction of
the mines, the entrance of heavy ships
into the harbor and the assault on Cer
vera's fleet. This was heartily con
sented to by General Shafter, who
stated that tne entrance to the harbor
was the key to the situation. This was
repeated in his interview with General
Garcia at Aserradero. It had been
the admiral's desire to do everything
possible to co-operate with General
Shafter, and such an attack as that
proposed by the general was in com
plete accord with the views held by the
admiral and discussed with his staff.
It was proposed to bring up the ma
rines from Guantanamo and add them
to the marines of the squadron, thus
making a force of nearly 1000 men
which must be landed either at the
foot of the Morro in Estrella Cove, to
assault the Morro or to the westward
for the purpose of assaulting the west
battery. At the same time a detach
ment of 2000 or 3000 men from the army
would proceed by Aguadores, occupy
the ground between the Morro and just
to the northward of it. A visit to Gen
eral Shafter was arranged, but the ad
miral being ill his chief of staff went
instead.
"The following arrangement was
made:
CAMP NEAR SAN .THAN RTVER,
Cuha, July 6, 189S.â Mlnutos of conversa
tion between Captain Chadwlck of the
navy, representing Admiral Sampson, and
General Shafter:
That a long-continued bombardment be
made of Santiago from the sea with the
heavier guns of the fleet, the fleet firing
slnwlv and continually say during twenty
four hours, at the rate of one shell every
five minutes, excepting one hotir at the
rate of one every two minutes. This re
fers to the 8-inch to 13-inch shells. If this
be not sufficient to bring the enemy to
terms, that an assault be arranged on the
Socapa battery, using marines and the
Cuban forces under General Cebreco, and
an effort be made to enter the harbor
with some of the smaller ships of the
squadron. This attack to be made upon
knowing the result of a second demand
made upon the commanding officer of the
Spanish forces for the surrender of the
place, stating to him the conditions that
surround him, destruction of the Spanish
fleet, etc., and the number of forces op
posed to him. To give him time to con
sider the matter, the date of the bom
bardment is fixed at noon of the 9th, un
less he positively refuses to consider it at
all. when it will begin at such time as is
convenient to ourselves.
General Shafter will furnish the ad
miral with correct maps, showing where
his lines will be surrounding the city,
and also open telegraphic communication
by the way of Slboney down to near
Aguadorea to give information as to the
fall of the first shots.
This was followed by the correspond
ence between General Shafter and the
Spanish commander at Santiago, in
which General Shafter demanded the
surrender of the Spanish forces. Copies
of this correspondence were forwarded
by General Shafter to Admiral Samp
son, who was also advised of the terms
of the truce agreed upon.
On July 10 General Shafter notified
the admiral that the bombardment of
the city would be resumed by the army
on the following morning. He inclosed
charts showing the position of the
American and Spanish lines and re
questing that the fleet begin the bom
bardment at 4 o'clock p. m. on the 10th.
General Shafter added that it would be
very disastrous to the morale of his
men to have any of the shells fall near
them and he consequently requested
that the navy throw its shells into the
westward part of the city, near the
bay, promising that the falling of the
first shell would be observed and the
results communicated to the fleet by
signal.
The bombardment was begun as re
quested and there were several ex
changes of notes between the general
and the admiral as to the result of the
firing. The following correspondence
then took place:
Headquarters Fifth Army Corps, July 11.
Commander In Chief North Atlantic
Squadron: My lines are now complete to
the bay north of Santiago. Your shots
can be observed from there perfectlyâ at
least, those that fall in the town. Flames
followed several shots fired to-day, but
seemed to be quickly extinguished. A
number of shots fell in the bay cloaq to
a small gunboat lying near the shore.
At present they are considering a de
mand for unconditional surrender. I will
notify you of the result. I think it ad
visable "to put in some heavy shots â say,
ten to thirteen inchesâ to-morrow, and
see if we cannot start a fire. Be careful
not to shoot beyond the town, as my
troops are within one and a half miles
of it, and you will be firing directly to
ward us. SHAFTER,
Major General.
Admiral Sampson notified General
Shafter on the 12th that he proposed
to begin the bombardment next morn
ing with 13-inch shells. The Oregon,
Massachusetts and Indiana were
promptly on hand on the morning of
the 13th prepared to fire, but a tele
gram from General Rhafter brought no
tice of a truce, pending negotiations for
the surrender of the city. On July 12
and 13 several notes were passed, Gen
eral Shafter advising the admiral of
the progress of the negotiations for
surrender and Admiral Sampson ex
pressing his readiness to render any
assistance desired. In one of these
notes, on July 14, Admiral Sampson in
formed General Shafter that he desired
to be represented in the negotiations
for surrender, as it was the result of
the combined forces.
At noon on the 14th General Shafter
telegraphed to the admiral that there
was apparently every prospect of an
evacuation and at 2:30 o'clock on the
same day General Miles telegraphed
Admiral Sampson that the enemy had
surrendered.
WRECKAGE FOUND ON THE
WASHINGTON COAST
Belief That the Overdue Schooner
Signal Has Met Disaster at
Sea.
SEATTLE, Aug. B.â To-day wreckage
was picked up on the shore between
Grays Harbor and Willapa, southern
coast of Washington. Boxes of gro
ceries and a memorandum book have
been found. They are supposed to

As that vessel is eleven days out from
San Francisco to Grays Harbor there
are fears that she has met with some
mishap.
HIRED A NEGRO TO
KILL HER HUSBAND
Three Persons, Including the Vic
tim's Wife, in Danger of
Lynching.
MEMPHIS, Term.Aug. B.â On the night
of July 30 J. T. Orr, a prominent hard
ware merchant of Clarendon, Term., was
! murdered, being shot through the win
i dow of his home. The search for the
j guilty parties was fruitless until Satur
| day, when the Sheriff learned of a state
j ment made by a young woman that Mrs.
j Orr knew something of the^ assassination.
It was charged that she hired a negro
i named Rennis Record to kill Mr. Orr. A
negro named Manse Castle, however, vol
] unteered to do the work for the same
; amount, so it was stated.
Record. Castle and Mrs. Orr were Im
mediately placed under arrest. Yester
1 day Castle said that he killed Orr, and
charged that Mrs. Orr had hired him to
Ido the work. Last night a great crowd
! gathered In the public square and it
j looked for a time as if there would be a
lynching. Judge Thomas made a speech
, and an urgent appeal to ihe crowd nut
to moli the prisoners. lie announced that
be would at once adjourn court at Lo
noke and try the prisoners, 'lne crowd
dispersed, and Mrs. Orr, who had been
kÂ«-i>t in the courthouse since her arrest,
was conducted to the jail.
Orr's life was insured for $5000 In the
Knights of Pythias and Maccabees. His
wife is the beneficiary. Some COnserva-
I tlve citizens lielleve that Mrs. < )rr is
guiltless and that a trial will clear her.
â  There will be an examining trial Tues

NEW YORK, Aug. S.-An Annapolis
special to the Herald says: Rear Admiral
McNair and Lieutenant Hobson ex
pressed the conviction to-day that the
courteous, generous treatment extended
the Spanish officers will have a splendid
international effect.
"It will be a precedent," said Hobson.
"which will undoubtedly be followed by
warring nations of the future."
While the Spaniards have apparently
every liberty at the academy, Rear Ad

POLITICS SOUTH
OF TEHACHAPI
Bulla and Gage Racing
for a Nomination.
FRIENDS OF BOTH CONFIDENT
ONE WOULD BE SENATOR, THE
OTHER GOVERNOR.
Gage Forces Control Los Angeles, but
Outside That County the
Issue Is in
Doubt.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Aug. B.â That the
City of Angels has at least two candi
dates for Republican honors is made
manifest by the contention of the
friends of Henry T. Gage, the candi
date for Governor, and R. N. Bulla,
candidate for United States Senator.
Each claims the power to control the
delegates from this end of the State.
The friends of Gage contend that the
fight for Governor should take preced
ence over that for Senator, while the
Bulla forces insist that a United States
Senatorship is of greater importance
to the people of the southern part of
the State than is the Governorship.
The Gage fight is being made by W.
!E. Dunn, W. W. Parker, George L.
i Arnold, Thorn and others, all pro
i nounced railroad men, and, so far as
Los Angeles County is concerned, they
have control of the works. The flurry
at Gage's headquarters in the Hollen
| beck for the past two days assumed
; the proportions of a boom and that he
i will secure the delegation from this
j county to the State convention is gen
erally conceded.
As to adjoining counties there is con
siderable difference of opinion as to
! who will control the delegates, and
, Bulla's friends insist that they will
; have strength enough in the conven
! tion to convince the delegates that a
; United States Senator should come
; from the south, which means the sele.T
! tion of a Governor from the northern
part of the State.
Bulla is making a dignified fight. He
is doing nothing to antagonize the
friends of any of the other aspirants,
: and the part taken in the selection of
'â â  delegates by him is merely with a view
to protecting the interests of himself
â  and friends. No complaint is being
i made by the Gage forces that Bulla has
been guilty of unfair means. On the
contrary, they admit that while he has
I been making a strong fight, it has been
: dignified and fair.
R. J. Waters, Republican candidate
! for Congress in the Sixth District, has
i been slated for the nomination by the
! Gage element, and his fight is managed
by W. W. Parker directly. His can
didacy is being pushed so vigorously
that it is conceded he will secure the
i nomination at the hands of delegates
! slated for the Congressional conven
tion. â¢
Democratic primaries were held this
evening in various precincts through
out the city and county to elect dele
gates to the county convention which
will meet on Wednesday to name
eighty-one delegates to the State con
i vention. Despite the fact that there
I was a contest between two factions of
I the party a very light vote was polled.
! In the Seventh and Eighth wards local
i leaders had a struggle and in those pre
cincts the largest vote was polled. To
judge from the returns received what
is known as the "anti-push" element of
! the party will organize the convention.
The delegates to the State convention
' will be for the Maguire and fusion pro
! gramme. The only trouble will arise
j over the renomlnation of Congressman
C. A. Barlow.
Ex-Congressman James McLachlan,
who has been a candidate for the re
j nomination, will to-morrow announce
' his withdrawal from the race. This
I leaves the field clear to R. J. Waters
; and he will probably be nominated by
i acclamation.
IN FAVOR OF EXPANSION.
Democratic Leaders of Missouri in
Accord as to Policy.
ST. LOUIS, Aug. B.â A special to the
Post-Dispatch from Springfield, Mo.,
says: It is declared here that when the
State Democratic convention meets on
Wednesday the leaders will be found in
perfect accord on the plank of the plat
form referring to the acquisition of terri
tory by the United States. Editor James
Bradshaw, a brother-in-law of Speaker
Farris candidate for Governor, who
joined Congressman Richard Bland last
week in a letter of apparent opposition to
tpp acquirement of territory, says to-day:
â¢'There will be no trouble about the plat
form. All that Bland desired from the
start was to prevent a declaration against
the annexation of territory. His position
Is just this: We will have Porto Rico in
a short time. When peace is declared
Americans will pour Into Cuba and devel
op Its industries. Before a year perhaps
formal applications will be made for it to
be annexed to the United States, and
Cuba will inevitably pass into our hands.
Why should the Democratic party of Mis
souri declare itself against a procedure
which will be shortly consummated? As
to the Philippines, we have no business
with territory on the other side of the
world, except to secure sufficient land to
answer for a coaling station or naval har
bor. Therefore, I say that Bland and
Stone are in perfect accord on this sub
ject. Democratic State Commltteeman
"Virgil M. Conklin of Carroll voiced the
Missouri sentiment in its extreme to-day
when he said:
"I am in favor of acquiring all the ter
ritory favored by every other Democrat,
and "in addition a coaling station at Ca
diz."
PROTESTS AGAINST A
FREE SILVER PLANK
Senator Hanna Opposes the Proposed
Action of the Utah Re
publicans.
SALT LAKE. Aug. B.â A movement hav
ing been recently inaugurated to incorpor
ate the Democratic financial plank in the
platform of the State Republican, party of
Utah. Senator M. A. Hanna, chairman of
the National Republican Committee, has
addressed a letter to United States Mar
shal Glen Miller of this city in which he
says:
"I have been informed that it has been
suggested that the Republican party of
Utah at the next State convention indorse
in its platform the free coinage of silver.
As chairman of the national committee,
charged with the duties of the position. I
protest against the Republicans of any
State taking such action. It would be
clearly in opposition to the prineip.'es of
the party as declared In the platform at
the national convention at St. Louis, and
I trust you will use your influence and
efforts to the end that that declaration
may be sustained."
CERVERA PUTS THE
BLAME ON BLANCO
Latter Responsible for the Blockad
ing and for the Destruction of
the Spanish Ships.
NEW YORK, Aug. B.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Captain
General Blanco is held responsible by
Admiral Cervera for the destruction of
the Spanish fleet. In his official report
to Madrid, which has been translated
to Spain through the French Embas
sador, Admiral Cervera calls attention
to the orders issued by Captain General
Blanco for his entrance into the harbor
of Santiago and for his departure
therefrom.
Admiral Cervera states that upon
his arrival at Curacoa he received in
structions to proceed to Santiago.
Against his judgment he carried out
his instructions, well knowing in ad
vance that his fleet would certainly be
blockaded. He received orders July 1
to leave the harbor, and notwithstand
ing his telegram to Captain General
Blanco, showing the result of a sortie
of the kind, he was ordered to obey
instructions. The report of the com
manding officer of the Colon, I am told,
shows that he really surrendered to
the battle-ship Oregon. Had it not
been for the bursting of a steam pipe
which caused the revolutions of the
Colon's engines to drop from 86 to 54
per minute, the Colon would not have
been caught so easily.
SIGSBEE TO COMMAND
THE BATTLESHIP TEXAS
Captain Goodrich Transferred From
the St. Louis to the Cruiser
Newark.
NEW YORK, Aug. B.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Secretary
Long informed me to-night that orders
had been given assigning Captain C. F.
Goodrich to the command of the protected
cruiser Newark, and that Captain C. D.
Sigsbee will relieve Captain J. W. Philip,
in command of the battle-ship Texas. In
making these selections Secretary Long
was guided by his desire to give the offi
cers named an opportunity to complete
their tour of duty at sea.
Captain Goodrich is now in command
of the auxiliary cruiser St. Louis, and
Captain Sigsbee is commanding officer of
the St. Paul. Captain Goodrich has not
been quite four months at sea. Captain
Sigpbee's tour of sea duty In his present
grade has not covered quite a year.
The St. Louis and St. Paul have been
ordered to Cramp's shipyard, and imme
diately upon their arrival they will be
placed out of commission and be returned
to the American line in practically the
same condition as they were before their
conversion.
It is regarded by the naval authorities
as particularly fitting that Captain Slgs
bee should be given command of the
Texas. The Maine and the Texas were
the first battleships of the new American
navy, both having been provided for by
Congress in the same appropriation bill.
For years the Texas was looked upon a3
the most unfortunate vessel in the navy.
Her fine work in Cuban waters, especially
during the engagement which ended in
the destruction of Admiral Cervera's
squadron, has dispelled this feeling.
DANGEROUS FAD TAKEN
UP BY PARIS BEAUTIES
Hypodermic Injections of Perfume
Becoming Popular in the
French Capital.
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted. IS9B. by James Gor
don Bennett.
PARIS. Aug. Â«.â According to the Fig
aro a new fad is looming up here. This
is a hypodermic Injection of perfume.
The idea is said to have been discovered
by a popular French actress, whose name
is not given, who noticed after taking an
overdose <>f morphine that the odor of
the drug exhaled from her body. She
developed this idea by using different per
fuÃH-s the same way. As a consequence
on Monday she is perfumed with violet,
on Tuesday with white rose, on Wednes
day with chlpre, on Thursday with
chefry blossom, etc.
The Figaro says that a doctor friend
of the nrtlst pointed out to her that this
idea was dangerous, as. unless the per
fume was absolutely pure, it might cause
blood poisoning. This may give a check
to the devotees of subcutaneous injections
of perfume.

OF THOUSANDS.
Firemen Powerless to Check the
Bavag:s of the Flames â Many
People Rendered
Homeless.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BISMARCK, N. D., Aug. B.â Fire
destroyed the best portion of the city
of Bismarck this evening, licking up
hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth.
of property. The flames originated In
the agent's office of the Northern Pa
cific depot. Almost before they were
discovered the entire building and the
immense warehouse of the company
were in flames.
Oils and powder contributed fuel and
before the names could be checked
they had spread to the block of brick
buildings across the alley, destroying
the Tribune office. Hare's hardware
store and an entire row of buildings.
The flames then leaped the street to
the magnificent First National Bank
building, which melted away in a few
minutes. The Central Block followed
and the flames spread to the postoffice,
sweeping over the entire block and
carrying down the postoffice, Mer
chants' Bank block, Griffin block and
all the intermediate frame and brick
structures. The fire crossed the street
and devoured Kupitz's store and the
greater part of the block. The flames
also advanced north into a residence
block and completely destroyed it. The
firemen were powerless to check the in
roads of the fire, which spread to scores
of buildings, licking them up as so
much waste paper.
The origin of the fire is unknown, as
no one was in the freight office when it
started. It is impossible to estimate
the loss to-night. All the wires are
burned, the Western Union office be
ing one of the first to go. The railroad
office was also destroyed. A temporary
cut-in was made to handle imperative
business.
The following buildings were de
stroyed: Penwarden's confectionery
store, Morris' shoe store. Hare's hard
ware store, the Tribune Publishing
Company. B. Raithwaite's shoe store.
First National Bank. Bardsley's drug

ADOLPH SUTRO'S DEATH-
NOTWITHSTANDING the long illness of ex-
Mayor Sutro the announcement of his death
reached the public as a surprise. Ever since he
' -had been stricken the effort to hedge his condition
labout with secrecy had tended to create some wrong
ijznpressions concerning the seriousness of it.
' That the death of Mr. Sutro is a distinct loss to
Â£?an Francisco must be an accepted fact. He was one
of the foremost citizens, and that the material de
velopment in which he was the potent factor made
him a millionaire was evidence of the soundness of
his judgment. Tireless in effort, no effort was per
mitted to go to waste. A man of splendid energy,
he directed all so as to subserve the double purpose
â¢of benefiting himself and the public. In most of his
enterprises the people had a share. The beautiful
Heights bearing his name were open to all. His build
ing of an electric line to the beach gave the five-cent
fare, for which there had long been a vain demand.
The baths he constructed near the Cliff House are
the most elaborate in the world; enough in them
selves to make San Francisco famous.
What he had intended to do not in a business way,
but purely from philanthropic motives, had been
hinted, but before the plans could be carried out a
shadow had fallen upon him. and perhaps when he
died the visions faded for all time.
The one characteristic of Adolph Sutro was his in
domitable will. No obstacle appalled it nor diverted
ir from its aim. His construction of the Sutro tun
nel was an achievement which no other man could
' have perfected. He fought prejudice, jealousy and
capital, but this triumvirate went down before him,
and he triumphed. From that time his success was
assured.
That he made enemies is true, for the activities of
commercial life and of politics do not permit other
wise, but he left none so bitter as to say an unkind
word of the dead, resting on the Heights, which had
been his well-beloved home.
AN ENEMY TO BE PROUD OF-
\A AJOR GENERAL SHAFTER, so far as may
/ \ be judged by official and private reports, has
* * made an excellent record at Santiago. As to
the sickness among his men, this was considered in
advance to be inevitable, and the attempt to blame
the commander for it is nothing less than ridiculous.
We regret to note that the general has the enmity
of the Examiner, but the regret is not on his account,
â¢ for the enmity of that sheet is to be desired. It is on
'account of the paper itself, which by its action is mak
ing a pitiful display of the qualities which cause it to
be despised. When it turns its assaults against any
man, that man, if aroused to anything above indiffer
ence, has reason to be grateful. A certificate of char
acter from the Examiner would, if it had effect, damn
a citizen of fair repute.
If the attacks keep up people will be forced to the
conclusion that the Examiner is angry over the cir
cumstance that its representatives, bent as they were
on creating mischief, prolix in the propagation of
falsehood, were sent out of Cuba in disgrace. They
will have to think that the Examiner, instead of being
grateful for the expulsion of a tribe of malign and dis
loyal, scribes who constituted a reproach to journal
ism 'arid a menace to the public welfare, is hurt. It
will be noticed that no statement directly concerning
this affair has been made in the anti-Shafter organ.
It is content to express resentment after the fashion
of the* guerrillas it loves so well.
Meantime the picture of Shafter remains above the
entrance to the Hearstling den. The laurel encircling
it is' fading, but there is no apparent tendency to re
place it with a fresh wreath.
There is a gentleman at Portland who has an
nounced himself as a candidate for the Presidency.
While not posing as a prophet this paper predicts that
he will be disappointed. But he might organize a
Coxey army and have a fair show of being at the
head of something.
There will be worldwide hope that England and
Russia can manage to get along without fighting. If
Russia may manage to get along without fighting. If
they were to come together the nations of the earth
would feel the jar.
Provided Spain cannot give up any territory with
out the consent of the Cortes the wisdom of getting
that body into session without delay must be apparent
to thoughtful Spanish statesmen.
One trouble with Massachusetts is that the good
old State believes it had the only good National Guard
to. send to the front. New York has had a similar
dtlusion.

With all respect for Admiral Sampson it must be

WORDS OF WARNING.
AN incredulous reader writes us to say that, with
all due respect to The Call, he does not believe
the figures .published in these columns on
Sunday morning, which, he says, "purported" to give
the vote returned for McKinley south of Tehachapi
at the election of 1896, were reliable. He demands to
know whence we obtained the figures, and he adds,
defiantly, that he is under the impression not only that
the region south of Tehachapi is "solidly Republi
can," but that it is Republican by a majority of six
or eight thousand.
We have no wish to conceal the source of our
authority for the statement that Mr. Gage'-s country
returned a beggarly plurality of 1000 for McKinley in
1806. In fact, had we dreamed there was a man in
the State unfamiliar with the truth, we should have
cited our authority at the time.
The figures in question were taken from Mr. de
Young's almanac. Under the circumstances no one
can question their reliability. Mr. de Young is sup
porting Gage for Governor in his paper, and, since
his own Senatorial aspirations depend upon the
gubernatorial nomination going south, naturally he
would be the last man in the world to make a. bad
showing for his candidate. But, lest our incredulous
correspondent should still think we have taken
liberties in figuring out totals, we append the entire
vote and recommend him to compute results himself:
1894 1896.
Eatee. Budd. McKinley. Bryan.
Los Angeles 11,255 7,619 16,891 16.043
Orange - 1,469 949 1.932 1,712
Santa Barbara 1,534 1,191 2.004 1.916
San Bernardino... 2,323 1,360 2.S18 2,740
Ventura 1,270 962 1.552 1,465
San Diego 2,848 1,897 3,631 3.90S
20,699 13,978 2S.829 27,784
Majority 6,721 1,045
The question which these statistics ask in sten
torian tones is this: How can Mr. Gage be elected
Governor of California with a Republican majority of
1000 south of Tehachapi? Is he stronger in that re
gion than McKinley? What issue does he represent
that is calculated to bring more votes to the Republi
can ticket than honest money and a safe and con
servative national administration?
Mr. Gage's opponent in this campaign, should he
be nominated, will be James G. Maguire. This gen
tleman carried the Fourth Congressional District of
this city in 1896 by a plurality of 8134, or a majority
over all candidates of 6867. At the same election Mc-
Kinley carried the city by 400. The Fourth District
comprises a little more than half of San Francisco
and casts about half its vote. To be exact, the Fourth
District polled at the Presidential election of 1896
31,277 votes, and the portion of the Fifth in this city
is 26,034. Here, then, upon the face of the figures, is
a majority of at least 10,000 for Maguire.
What has Mr. Gage to offer as an offset to this? A
beggarly plurality south of Tehachapi of 1045 and an
idea that this is a "Republican year" and that a "yel
low dog" can easily win.
If our incredulous correspondent can see nothing
ominous in these figures we are sorry for him. If he
does not take warning he is one of those fatuous in
dividuals who thinks that God, being on the side of
the Republican party, the heavy battalions of the
enemy need not be considered. But we disagree with
him. This is no time to talk about "yellow dogs,"
war sentiment or "Republican years."
If the Ilepuhlicnns who meet at Sacra.
meitto on the '-i'Atl lnnt. do not nominate a
man for Governor who can cut down
IVlas;iiii*c*N vote In San Franclwco, their
candidate, and perhap* their ticket, will
be defeated.
A FRENCH SCHEME OF TAXATION.
A STRIKING illustration of the wide divergence
of views among radical tax reformers is afford
ed by the scheme of taxation proposed for
France by the Brisson Ministry when contrasted with
the single tax system advocated by that class of men
in this country, and supported in Oregon by Mr.
Maguire, the Populist candidate for Governor in Cali
fornia,
According to reports that have come to us the
French Premier has announced that his Government
will ask the immediate adoption of two social reform
bills of an economic nature. The first bill is to repeal
all existing taxes on real estate and personal property
and replace them by a graduated income tax. The
second bill proposes to establish a means by which all
working people after they reach a certain age in life
shall receive from the Government a pension suffi
cient for their support.
The workingman's pension bill is a development of
the workingman's state insurance system, now in
operation in Germany, and therefore is not a French
idea. The taxation proposition, however, is peculiar
to France. Like that proposed by Henry George, it
is a single tax system, but, instead of placing all taxes
on land values as he proposes, it is designed to relieve
land of all taxes whatever. A proposition of that kind
is enough to make the author of "Progress and
Poverty" turn in his grave; and on the other hand it
would probably make a French radical shiver to be
told that in the United States there are men who wish
to remove all taxes from capital and place the whole
burden of the state upon the land-owner.
The Brisson Ministry, being in office and having a
working majority, though a small one. behind them,
may possibly succeed in getting their single tax sys
tem adopted, and then we shall have an experiment
on a large scale of the feasibility of such systems. The
chances are that it cannot be successfully operated.
There is an inherent injustice in all schemes of in
come taxation. If two men have an equal amount of
property and capital, and one of them works indus
triously and the other does not, the first will have a
much larger income than the second. He will there
fore have to pay more than the other. Thus a tax
is imposed upon industry and enterprise while idleness
and thriftlessness are given a bounty in the form of
exemption from taxation.
This injustice, which cannot be separated from in
come taxation of any kind, will be immensely in
creased by the Brisson policy of imposing the whole
taxation scheme of the nation upon incomes. It will
be further increased by the effort to raise in that way
a sum sufficient not only for the expenses of the Gov
ernment itself, but for pensioning workingmen. The
proposition is therefore one of the most radical that
has been advanced by a statesman for years. Now that
it has been advanced, however, we may expect some
of our Populist reformers to take it up. In fact, as
Mr. Maguire has been busily informing the Califor
nian farmers that the single tax on land is not an is
sue in this campaign, he may find it expedient to make
his fight on a Brisson programme and advocate a sin
gle tax on incomes.
Of course the Sultan scoffs at American demands.
He is a scoffer from away back, and so hardened that
he has been known to snigger at the European con
cert.
Dr. Pardee is getting unduly excited. Really, his
chances do not seem worth making a fuss about.
Gomez and Garcia both show an inclination to bolt
the convention.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 9, 1898.
THE COOLIES OF HflWflll.
IT is evident that an attempt will be made to placate
public opinion and pacify imperiled interests in
California by canonizing forcibly against the Chi
| nese in the scheme of government to be prepared for
' Hawaii. We do not propose to be blinded or cajoled
by any such subterfuge. The issue, common to white
labor and to employers in California, is against
Asiatic coolie labor in Hawaii. That labor competes
with white labor at white wages in California, and
we cannot stand the competition. We want all Asiatic
coolie labor deported from the islands and perma
nently excluded therefrom. The Labor Commissioner
of California, who investigated conditions in Hawaii
a year ago, says in his report: "The most interesting
phase of the labor question in the islands is the
Asiatic hordes that now infest them and predominate
on the plantations. I have seen four or five hundred
Japanese walk ten miles to back up the position of
one man when only a few days' work was involved.
I have seen murder and riot on the plantations. I
have heard the Japanese say that their people have
brought the sugar industry to the position it now oc
cupies, and that they propose to hold controlling in
fluence upon the islands at any hazard. I have seen
them demanding that white men be discharged and
Japanese taken in their places. 1 have seen one of our
men-of-war anchored in the harbor to defend the
planter against his own labor, and I have seen a Jap
anese warship there to encourage the Japanese in their
arrogant and insolent behavior, and to further de
mand that more shall be added to the already over
' burdened conditions. It needs no words to picture the
future of these islands when once the Japanese be
| come the moneyed power, the employers of labor and
' the labor itself."
It will be noticed that the objection runs not to
Chinese alone, but. to Asiatic coolies, and that while
the Chinese are hardly mentioned in the report, its
exposition of conditions relates to the Japanese alone.
If Hawaii is to be governed in the genius of our con
stitution, it must be by extending thereto the equal
ity which the constitution is intended to establish, and
does establish, between the States of this Union.
The Immigration Commissioner at this port is
mostly engaged in turning back Japanese coolie
laborers who come here to compete with white labor
in California. Why keep on fooling with the San
Francisco spigot and leave the Hawaiian bung open?
All of the press which favored annexation is put
ting forward the Chinese question as if their expul
sion and exclusion from the islands would satisfy
white labor and its employers here. The defeated
treaty and the annexation resolutions mention only
the Chinese, while the report of the Labor Commis
sioner shows twice as many Japanese in the islands as
Chinese. To the Japanese are attributed all the
truculence and acts of disorder. Their method is. bold
and defiant. No one hears of Chinese banding to
gether and demanding the discharge of white men
and the filling of their places by Chinese. But this is
done boldly by the Japanese, and we are left to infer
that it is successful.
For these reasons we demand the deportation of
Asiatic coolies from Hawaii: the nullification of con
tract labor laws; the extension to the islands of the
labor laws of the United States, eight-hour day and
all; and the establishment of exact equality of con
ditions A-ith the rest of the country.
WILLIAM L. STONE, a scholar of some re
pute in the East, has writtei to the New York
Sun a letter, in which he s;iys:
"All the newsp&pers except the Sun have, within
late years, given the title of our 'Stars and Stripes'
as 'Old Glory,' a name which the English, for 200
years, have given, par excellence, to' their own flag;
but even as far back as ten years our flag was known
by no such title; only by that of 'the Stars and
Stripes.' Hence, I ask, why import into the nomen
clature of our flag the same name which England has
used for so many generations, namely, "Old Glory'?
Jt would certainly seem as if we had a paucity of
names when this one is adopted from England."
To the great majority of the American people this
statement will come as news, and strange news at
that. Throughout the length and breadth of the land
the appellation "Old Glory" applied to the national
banner has become one of our popular phrases, as
familiar and as dear as household words. It his be
come accepted as something peculiar to our land and
to our time; a title won for the flag in our civil wars;
a name of honor bestowed upon it by the love and
loyalty of an exuberant patriotism. It is something
of a shock, therefore, to be told that after all we have
but borrowed the phrase from the British, and that
calling our banner "old glory" is like adopting as a
national anthem a song set to the music of "God Save
the Queen."
Mr. Stone's reputation for accuracy and general
scholarship gives weight to his statement concerning
the origin of the phrase, and yet if it be true that the
British have preceded us in the use of the term it is
certain they have never employed it enough to make
it familiar to the general public. Even dictionaries
of phrase and fable and other reference books of the
kind do not record it as of British origin or use.
There has long been a discussion in this country as
to the authorship of the term, and considerable study
has been devoted to the subject, but Mr. Stone is the
first to our knowledge to trace it back to the English.
The question is one of literary curiosity merely, and
yet it is of interest to all Americans. As the case
stands to-day the phrase is American and not British,
by general use and common consent. We have made
it the name of the starry banner by adopting it as a
familiar phrase in common conversation and embody
ing it in our oratory, poetry and general literature.
It requires a special and curious scholarship to know
that the term has ever been applied to the standard of
St. George, St. Andrew and St. Patrick, but all the
world knows it as a name for the beautiful banner of
the stars and stripes.
It must be remembered, however, that the term has
been adopted by us more for the sake of brevity than
for anything else. "Old Glory" is not so beautiful a
phrase as the "star-spangled banner." and, moreover,
it is not in any way descriptive of the flag. For the
higher uses of oratory and poetry, therefore, it will
never usurp the true and genuine name of our stand
ard. It is short and terse and telling; has a good
mouth-filling sound that suits well for cheering and
hurrahs, but it lacks the beauty of an exact descrip
tiveness and the suggestion of eternal splendor which
are compact in the rightful name of the banner of the
stars.
The strange fact develops that a woman who re
cently killed herself in this city had inherited a sui
cidal mania, most of her family having voluntarily
quit this world of woe. It seems a pity that she was
married. Such a mania ought to be allowed a chance
to become extinct.
Shafter has not yet been accused of sowing the
germs of yellow fever among his men; but then the
war upon him has only started.
One beneficent effect of the war has been that it
has awakened within Blanco the power to think.
"OLD GLORY."
"SUNSET" INDULGES IN EXTORTION.
Editor the San Francisco Call: Your stand on the war tax ques
tion in regard to "Wells, Fargo & Co. is right and should be kept up;
but you have overlooked the Sunset Telephone Company, who of
fend in a greater measure than the other corporation, for instead of
holding their patrons up for the Government tax of 1 cent they exact
5 cents every time and keep the 4 cents, which, on a year's business
over their lines, must make a sweet little dividend for the share
holders. I have not heard a single complaint from a private citizen
about paying his just share of the war tax, but it is not exactly
right to make them pay added taxes for the benefit of corporations
who evade paying any themselves. INIS STURGEON.

There was a time when I, unthinking,
sighed
To muse by Arno's stream, to watch the
sun
Rise o'er the Alps, or, when the day
was done,
In moonlit Venice on her waters glide.
Then Egypt, Greece and Rome were mag

And now I know that there is only one
Sweet spot to love, and more than worlds
beside,
Not that my soul to beauty has grown
cold.
Not that I would not see her varied
store,
But that I know In all her chambers old,
Than here at home, she cannot show me
more
Of peace, content and inward happiness â
And these are all a mortal need possess.

That this was Pompey's, that was Tra

Here Tully thundered his philippics bold.
And here, alas! was Nero's house of

Let me not think upon them while at

I yet may wander where the brooklet

A SOUTH AMEBICAN VIEW.
The old proverb says that no man ap
preciates his happiness until he has lost
it. If the Latin-American republics fancy
that their form of government is suf
licit-ntly guaranteed by international law,
by the respect which they compel In
Europe, they tire indulging- themselves in
a delusion which the foreign intervention
in thi; case of Mexico ought to have dis
pelled years ago. The indisputable truth
is, although it hurts to confess it, that the
Independence of these republics continues
unmolested simply and solely on account
of the powerful Monroe doctrine, which
has been their true redemption; which has
been like the vast shadow of the great
nation of the north cast benevolently over
the peoples of the south.
What force reduced to silence the char
latanism of the Holy Alliance when it pro
posed to send its fleets to this hemisphere
to attack its yet insecure independence
and to give back into the power of Spain
her fugitive children? It was this famous
principle, the more powerful because it
was not then nor is it yet a law. Who
prevented Central America half a century
ago from becoming an English colony?
The American Government, with its Clay
ton-Bulwer and Dallas-Clarendon treaties.
Who prevented the establishment of an
exotic monarchy in Mexico? The Ameri
can Government, with an "Enough" from
Mr. Seward. Who prevented Spain from
treating of the reeonquest of the republics
of the Pacific Coast when she sent them a
royal commission and talked of reclaiming
them? The same American Government,
with a sign from the same Mr. Seward.
Who prevented England from taking all i
the spoils she desired in Venezuela? The j
American Government, wltb a plain "No"
from Mr. Cleveland. Who prevented
Europe scarcely live years ago from re
storing the monarchy in Brazil? The
American Government, with Us opportune
invocation of the Monroe doctrine. Who
prevented the American isthmus from
passing in 1885 into the possession of the
United States? The same American Gov
ernment, which did not desire dominion
there, but preferred rather to be loyal to
Colombia.
The power of the United States once
broken, this will be the fate of our re
publics: Our children must resign them
selves to loitering about the palaces of
Princes, watching the proud processions
of the coaches of European dignitaries on
the days of court festivities, and there
will be renewed, from the Rio Grande to
Patagonia, atrocious wars of conquest, to
last for who can tell how many years or
with what final result?
From these days of court festivities and
from these wars we are spared by the
American Union.â El Reportorio Colombi

THE POSITION OF GERMANY.
The confederation of States composing I
what is known as the German empire is
twenty-seven years old. Nowhere in the
world, except In the United States, has
there been industrial and commercial
progress so rapid as in Germany since on
April 16, 1871, its component States formed |
"an eternal union for the protection of j
the realm and the care of the welfare of j
the German people." The total foreign j
trade of the empire, which was $1,396,- j
665,000 in 1872, reached $1,952,505,000 in 1896â
an increase of 40 per cent. The exports
of articles of domestic production, which
in 1572 were valued at $580,165,000, had in
creased by 1898 to $^64,327.000â an increase
of about 49 per cent, in presence of such
a fall in the price of all the products of
manufacture as to require an addition of
j fully one-half to the quantities of 1896 in
j order to present a fair comparison with
.tlmso of 1872. About three-fourths of all
j the export trade of Germany is in articles
i other than the crude products of field or
! mine. They are sufficiently varied to in
| dicate the existence of a highly developed
i industrial system, and among the coun
! tries which "furnish the chief markets for
them are to be found Germany's most
formidable commercial rivals. The British
empire and the United States take be
tween them more than one-third of all
the German exports of manufactures, and
even with its friend and ally, Italy, the
â  trade of Germany is less than one-half of
i that with France, its secular foe.
German Industry and commerce have
I between them made notable progress in
these twenty-seven years toward the
conquest of the world. Meanwhile the
40,000,000 of Germans who emerged from
i the war with France had become 52.000.000
| in 1895, and are probably 54,000,000 to-day.
â¢ Some 17,000,000 of them are directly de
! pendent on industrial pursuits, and be
tween 4,500,000 and 5,000,000 on trade and
commerce. Not even in Great Britain are
! the conditions of national prosperity more
closely bound up with the free expan
sion of trade; equality of opportunity is
all that Germany needs to hold its own
beside its rivals. Nothing would seem to
be more obvious than that the interest
of Germany is to stand for the "open
door" in China, in Africa, and anywhere
else that commercial ambition is apt to
assume the form of carving out spheres
of exclusive influence.â New York Times.

CLEANING WOOLâ T. M., City. The
cleaning of wool from sheep is called
scouring. It consists of immersing the
wool in an alkaline lye, which forms a
soap with the natural grease of the
fleece. This acts as detergent and cleans
the wool thoroughly, when it is washed
in running water. Then it undergoes a
process called willying; that iC it is
passed through a machine, which deans
it of dust and other impurities, after
which it has to be passed through a ma
chine called a teaser to tear open the
matted portions and render it lit for use.
An amateur who had "a small quantity
of wool, sufficient to make up two mat
tresses" might try the scouring process,
but would find that it would be more
trouble than the wool would be worth.
The easiest way is to take it to a pro
fessional, who will do the work for a
comparatively small sum.
BRITISH INDIA MONETARY SYS
TEMâA. D. R., San Rafael, Cal. The
present monetary system of British India
was established September 1, 1835, on the
single silver standard. The rupee and half
rupee are unlimited legal tender, but
smaller silver coins only for sums of less
than a rupee. Gold coins are not legal
tender. There is no limit to coinage, but
the mint charge, is 1 per cent. The debts
of India to Great Britain require the an
nual export of more than $80,300,000. The
price of silver, however, dropped so low
in 1892 that this amount was increased
by over $51,100,000 in payment of gold
premiums. This fall in silver led to the
closing of the mints to silver on June
26, 1893, and the avowed policy to return
to the gold standard. The law of July,
1861,. prohibited bank issues of currency-.
The Government issues currency upon
Gavernment securities, receivable for all
debts, public and private. On the day
that the mints were closed to silver coin
age they were, by an act passed that day,
authorize to issue rupees at the value
of Is 4d in exchange for gold bullion or
British gold coins, the rate being 15 ru
pees to the sovereign. Although not gen
eral legal tender in India. English sover
eigns and half sovereigns were accepted
in 1893 at the public treasuries m pajmtni
of Government dues. That was a modi
fied plan of the Government s own pro
posal to prevent a further tall rather
than to raise the gold standard of the
rupee. In 1*94 the experimental attempt
of the British India Council to prevent
further decline in the value of the ru
pee and to dominate the rate of exchange
between Calcutta and London was given
up In January of that year the mini
mum rate of 15V4, pence per rupee was no
longer insisted upon, but all tenders for
bids were to be considered on their mer
its.

BE GOVERNOR
OF HAWAII
Admiral Miller Carried Him His
Commission From the
President.
Professor Pritchett of the Coast and Geodetic
Survey to Prepare Charts of the
Island Waters.
"The first Governor of Hawaii will be
fex-President Dole ard not Mr. Sewell,
as recently reported."
; : This interesting statement was made
by United States Senator Morgan yester
day at the Occidental Hotel to a repre
sentative of The Call.
â¢â " "Furthermore," remarked the Senator,
"I have the best of reasons for believing
that Admiral Miller is now carrying Mr.
Pole's commission to him in Honolulu."
. 'When pressed to give a statement of his
reasons for thinking that Dole would be
â¢ . the first Governor, the Senator simply
. Kmarked that "the President knows
..what Is best."
, The Impression given by the tone of Mr.
â  Morgan's remarks was that he possessed
... Borae late information, as a member of
the commission, regarding the .President's
1 -action in rriation to the Governorship.
As a member of the Hawaiian Com
: mission the Senator intends to make a
â¢complete tour of the eight islands of the
group. Speaking of this,, project ne said,
'.'While the principal business of the
..Commissioners will be transacted in
' Honolulu, it will be Incumbent upon us to
thoroughly investigate all existing condi
; tions in the islands, and this can only be
â  accomplished by a general visitation of
â  the various towns and the interi-ir dis
tricts. There are so many perplexing
' -questions to be decided that it is at pres
ent impossible to forecast our action on
any important points.
' . "One element of the population Is Por
: tugu.ese, but," continued the Senator,
with a smile, "they are much better peo
ple than the Spaniards, although they
â  come from the same peninsula. '
â .."Will Prof, psor Pritchett of the T'nited
States Coast and Qeodetic Survey ac
company the commission to Honolulu?"
: was asked,
VHe will probably sail on the same boat,
but will have no connection with the work
.of the Commissioners." replied the Sen
. ator. "Hp goes, I understand, to make a
tninary investigation for the coast
'survey office, in fact, to see what work
Is to be done there. The Hawaiian Gov-
; ernm-nt had a survey office and consid
â¢e*ab;Â»> charting, no doubt, was done. Pro- j
fessor Alexander, a capable man, was in !
â charge. The Washington office will take i
hold where the Hawaiian survey left off.
It Is very important to have complete and '
-Tellable charts of the waters around the j
I Islands, as they will be far more used i
henceforth by ships seeking port. Trade i
â with the islands will improve. In fact j
trade between our seaports on the Pa
cific Coast and all of the islands and coun- !
â tries of the Orient will make rapid pro- !

PORTLAND MAN WEDS A BELLE
Nuptials of Miss Alice G. Friedlander and
Emanuel Hiran) Lauer.
Last evening at the home t>f the bride's father, S. H. Friedlander,
2C03 Steiner street. Miss Alice G. Friedlander and Emanuel Hiram Lauer
spoke the binding words that made them man and wife.
The ceremony was celebrated by the Rev. IÂ»r. Voorsanger.
Owing to the recent death of the groom's father, only the immediate
relatives and most intimate friends of the contracting parties witnessed
the nuptials.
The bride was led to the alter by her father. S. IT. Friedlander, the
well-known theatrical manager. In the bridal procession were Mr.
Friedlander's brother, who came from Washington to attend the wed
ding, and Mrs. Friedlander. the bride's grandmother.
The time was beautifully decorated for the occasion with rare exotica
and choke blossoms, In the midst of which gleamed countless incandes
cent lights.
The bride wore an elegant gown of white satin. The jupe was made
en train* and the corsage was trimmed with pearls.
Miss Krledlander has been a great social favorite in San Francisco for
sev< ra _i years, she is beautiful, talented and charming, and fa a well
known figure among literary women. For several years she has been
active in educational and club work. She "won her spurs" by writing pa
pers for the Press Conventions of Washington and Oregon. One of them,
"Women's Rights in Journalism," was much noticed for Its maturity of,
thought and force of expression, remarkable In so young a writer. Her
other work has been a paper on "The History of the Drama," which was
read before the Pacific Coast Woman's Press Association, of which she
was the secretary. Although much of her matter found its way into the
local papers, her name has seldom appeared.
Mr. Lautr is a member of the large wholesale drug house of Blu
mauer, FranK & Co. of Portland, and is a graduate of the University of
Oregon and the Philadelphia Pharmacy. He is recognized as one of the
most expert (hemists in the country.
The couple will make a tour of the southern cities and then go north,
and Portland, Oregon, will be their future home.
Among the guests â who attended the wedding were Hon. S. H. Friend
ly and wife, Mrs. Charles Lauer, the Misses Carrie. Barbara and i
Henrietta* Lauer. Mips Carrie Friendly of Eugem Oregon, Mrs. Ed i

and all cities along the coast will have
their hands full in attending to the In
creased trade that will come their way.
An epoch of development and prosperity
is at hand. The building of the Nicara
guan Canal will add to the trade impetus
along this coast. There is no doubt but
that Congress will authorize the building
of the canal at the next session."
"Are there any sigjis of mineral on the
Hawaiian Islands?"
"Not a sign," replied the Senator. "I
never discovered a trace of gold, or of any
other metal, during the course of my In
vestigations there. The volcanic charac
ter of the islands will account for that
fact. No, there will be no rush of gold
:-< ekera to Honolulu, even If there should
be to the Philippines. Not a particle of
metal can b<> found in the soil.
"One other thing," concluded the Sen
ator.- "'The missions of the various de
nomlnatons are well established. The
Episcopalians, Presbyterians and Congre
gationalists are at work. The Catholics
nave their churches, and so have other
! sects. There is a Chinese Christian
Church and another attended by non
residents who visit the islands. I do not
know its tenets. I believe that the Bap
tists also have a church, but am not cer
tain on this point."
Professor Henry S. Prltchett spent sev
eral hours on the survey steamer Gedney
yesterday afternoon. In consultation with
Captain Westdahl. Subsequently, in
speaking of his probable work on the Ha
waiian charts, he said: "We are abso
lutely without data concerning the sur
vey office at Honolulu. After I reach the
field of operations then I will be able to
form some conclusions as to what lies
ahead. Probably the Coast Survey
steamer Patterson will be detailed for
Hawaiian . operations. After my return
from Honolulu I shall be engaged upon
Coast Survey work on the coast north of
Mendocino. We will keep at it until the
charts of American waters are complete
up to the British boundary. At present
the Coast Survey office has a great deal
of labor on its hands. As you know, our
parties are doing a great deal in the way
of charting Alaskan -waters. One of our
steamers is now busy at the delta of the
Yukon, hunting for its true mouth. We
believe that the deep water channel Into
this river will be found before winter. So
far we have no party up at Fort Yukon
flats, being Intent first upon finding the
true mouth of the stream for ocean-going
vessels."
It is understood that United States Sen
ator Perkins will make a trip to Alcatraz
to-day, in company with Professor
Prltchett. with a view to locating there
a tidal-gauge, for which an appropriation
was made by the last Congress. The pro
fessor is authorized to select a suitable
site for the gauge, which will accurately
register the rise and fall of the tides.

THEATRICAL
ATTRACTIONS
"His Absent Son" at the
Columbia.
"FAUST" CROWDS THE TIVOLI
CAMILLE" IS WELL PBESENTED
AT THE ALCAZAR.
"The Cherry Pickers" MaUas a Hit
at Morosco's â Fun at the
Chutes â The Orphe
um Attractions.
The initial performance of "Faust" at
the Tivoli last evening went off very
Btnootbly and was characterised by con
scientious attention to detail and by elab
orate and picturesque staging, melodious
singing and the excellent handlnig of the
famous orchestra.
In a word, the nerfomance was enjoya
ble and meritorious, and accordantly ex
cited the enthusiasm of the large audi
ence. Seldom has the garden scene been
done so well in this city. Throughout, the
soloists and the chorus were in fine
form. The. voicp of Miss Anna Lirhter Is
peculiarly adapted to the role of Mar
guerite. Ph<- sang with tenderness. gay
ety and pathos and her acting was good.
Slg. Edgardo Zerni was an acceptable
Faust, and William Pruettp as Valen
tine, and Sig. G. S. Wanrell, as Mephisto,
received well-earned applause. Miss Elvia
Crox sanp and acted the part of Siebol
with much success. She was very effec
tive in the third act. A stronger Valen
tine than Pruette has not been seen or
heard here In a long time. The "Faust"
presentations have every promise of be
ing among the most popular of the sea
son. The tuneful opera never wears out,
nor does the story ever get old.
The Columbia.
"His Absent Son," as presented by the
Frawley Company at the Columbia last
j night is the most laughable and enjoyable
thing in the comedy line they have of
fered this Reason. It is a German adapta
tion with French characteristics through
out, the dialogue being bright and catchy
and the telling situations numerous and
exceedingly amusing. The first act ap
pears to be slow and does not indicate
the bewildering complications that fol
low in rapid succession in the succeeding
scenes. In fact the startling changes of
the paternity and maternity of the mythi
cal "absent son," and the troubles grow
ing out of the efforts of his fictitious fath
er to avoid exposure, kept the house in a
continuous laugh and sent the audience
home in a very satisfactory frame of
1 mind.
The part of Mr. Pennle, the deceitful
! husband, who invented the absent son
in order to secure $100 a month from the
rich Mrs. Pennie. to squander in "busi
ness" trips to New York, is the center
around which all the trouble Â« revolves.
In this, Harry Corson Clarke Was very
j happily cast, for he not only appreciated
the value of the lines and situations, but
delineated a character in which no part
of the fun was lost. In fact he made
a decided hit. Edward Hell, who gets
mixed up in the personality of the son
who is not, fits his part well, particularly
in his interview with his prospective
mother-in-law, Mrs. Pennie, where he
succeeds in floundering out of the quick
sands of supposed relationship that sur
round him. He keeps the fun moving in
a manner much to his credit.
Fanchon Campbell, as the determined
young lady in love, was very pretty and
improved greatly on her previous work.
The difficult part of Mrs. Pennie was por
trayed by Eleanor Carey quite commend
ably. Mr. Payne is an ideal henpecked
husband, and has his opposite in Evelyn
Andrews as his wife. Theodore Roberts
is excellent as the fire-eating, satisfaction
peeking Kentuckian, and in a short part
ably helps to bring the relationship riddle
to a Jolly solution.
"His Absent Son" deserves full houses
during its run of a week.
Grand Opera House.
The military drama of "The Cherry
Pickers" was presented for the first time
on the Pacific Coast at the Grand Opera
House last night to a thoroughly appre
ciative audience. The play takes its
title from the Eleventh Hussars, an Eng
lish regiment, and the scene is laid in
India during the Afghan war of 1879-80.
It is full of exciting climaxes that roused
the audience to the wildest enthusiasm.
The plot hinges upon the unholy love
of Colonel Brough of the Hussars for
Nourmalee. a half caste, the daughter of
a rich merchant, who is betrothed to
John Nazare, a half caste and aide-de
camp to Colonel Brough. The part of
Nazare was portrayed by James M. Rro
phy in his usual manly and effective
style. Landers Stevens excelled himself
as the villainous colonel, and was roundly
hissed by the audience. The par,t was
played in a thoroughly realistic manner
and gave full scope to his ability. Lo
rena Atwood, as the heroine Nourmalee,
showed that she 1b possessed of force and
pathos that surprised even her admirers.
She scored a pronounced success, :md
was enthusiastically applauded several
times. Julia Blanc was quite at home
as Mrs. O'Donnell-Duleep, the warm
hearted and Impulsive widow, and Jes
sie Shirley was pleasing as her half
caste daughter Rada. Maurice Stewart
as Hrown, the valet and co-conspirator
of the colonel; Max yon Mltzel. as Lieu
tenant York of the Hussars; Leslie Mn
rosco as Corporal Jones; Fred Butler
as the Afghan spy; James Corrigan as
Mr. Guest, a rich merchant, and Bert
Morrison as the Kansahma, played their
parts well. The play Is one of the best
that has been seen at the Grand for a
long time.
The Alcazar.
Lewis Morrison, supported by Florence
Roberts and the Alcazar Theater stock
company, gave an unusually clever per
formance of Dumas' "Camllle" last even-
Ing to a packed house. The play has sel
dom been presented here in such a thor
ough-going: and finished manner. Mr.
Morrison's Armand Duval was a power
ful and consistent piece of acting. In
the love scenes he was thrilling mil im
passioned, and at the close of the fourth
act when he denounces the apparently
heartless Camille he reached a dramatic
height that well merited the hearty ap
plause that rewarded his efforts. Miss
Roberta easily eclipsed her former efforts
during the present season. Her Camille
was worthy to be placed beside the por
tr'iiting of far more famous actresses
who have become identified with the
character. Howard Scott was a good
Count de Varville. The remaining char
acters were well sustained, and the
Ft age settings and costumes far above
the average.
Orpheum.
The Orpheum has an aerial act that Is
the talk of San Francisco. When it was
announced that the Hegelmanns would
do some acts that excelled anything ever
seen in this city many may have regard
ed the statement as overdrawn, but the
Hegelmanns fully verified it by their
work last night, after they had made
one of their thrilling swings. The first
and second attempt at pirouetting in mid
air failed and the artist landed in the net
amid oh's! but the third attempt was a
success and brought forth cheers.
Miss Lillian Burkhart comes to us with
something so out of the ordinary run of
vaudeville sketches that her act seems
positively n freshing. She is a dainty ,it
tle actrets, and uer sketch, quiet and un
assuming In tone, affords her opportunity
for clever bits of work. She assumes the
lÂ»irt of the coy young girl who tries to
suggest to her lover that it is time to
propose, and she even offers to make the
lines easy for him. Miss Burkhart car
rl?s the part well, while her support, Cy
ril Wilber. is an excellent foil in the part
of the young man who guesses at every
thing but the right meaning to the hints
thrown out to him.
O'Brein and Buckley excited laughter
by their musical comedy act and scored a
success.
James Thornton hns new songs and is
still a feature notwithstanding the strong
card that ho has to play against.

The New Acquisition Enjoys an En

Handicapped Will Try
to Get to the Front.
BY JOE CORBETT.
The Fresno Baseball Club was last night
dropped from the ranks of the Pacific
Coast League, ond In Its place was listed
the Watsonville dub.
Ever since the unjust treatment of Um
pire Sweeney by the Fresno management
this move has been in contemplation, and
was not completed at the last meeting of
the league board, held a week since,
owing to the fact that Sweeney was com
pelled to return for trial, and It was
feared the expelling of the club before
this Incident came to pass would necessi
tate the management giving Sweeney an
unusually warm reception on his return
to their midst.
The idea did not work to perfection, as
Sweeney returned and, instead of being
acquitted, was fined $20 and costs, which
amount was paid by the league managers,
at the suggestion of Mr. Bunker.
The consensus of professional opinion,
and I may add the prevailing belief. Is
that the move of taking in close-by Wat
sonville Is deserving of commendation.
It Is claimed by every manager and play
er who ever appeared in the town of
Fresno that It is almost Impossible to
meet with fair play there, and when one
takes Into consideration that no less than
five clubs have left the field this season
owing to unfair treatment, It Is not diffi
cult to surmise that there Is much verac
ity attached to the statement.
Outside of this it Is claimed that base
ball does not draw well in Fresno, and
the expense and inconvenience of going
such a distance do not warrant such a
long trip. At any rate, grievances go for
naught, as the club has been disposed of,
so tar as the Pacific Coast League Is
concerned, and all eyes will naturally be
turned on Its successor.
Little is known regarding the club's
ability. They have achieved by assidu
ous work an enviable reputation among
the crack amateur towns of the State,
and one feature which stamps them as
being competent enough to maintain
their present standing In the baseball
world Is that they have in their ranks
a pitcher known as Mr. Danlin, who has
more than held its own while twirling
for the San Joses. They accepted, with
out a protest, the Fresno club's stand-
Ing in the championship race, which, by
the way. Is not a laudable one â this be
cause of their desire to enter the league.
In this one respect they are greatly
handlcapped, but It is said they intend
overcoming it. Of course, it would have
been much better had they been accorded
the privilege of an equal start, but' as
this was impossible owing to the number
of games already played. It Is hoped they
will prove themselves equal to the emer
gency. Outside of Danlin It is impossi
ble to figure on the team at present, as
I have never had the good fortune and
pleasure of seeing them. One thing,
however, I will vouch forâ lf the men
composing the tfcam are as Interested and
as confident as their rather good-looking
managers, the pennant Is already theirs:
that Is, if confidence can outshine good
baÃeball.

HOW OAKLAND
KEEPS OP HER
HARBOR WORK
The Senate Delegation
Got the Money.
ON A CONTINUOUS CONTRACT
SUMS ALLOWED ON ESTIMATES
OF THE ENGINEER.
Historical Review of How Senators
Perkins and White Accom
plished So Much for the Im
portant Improvement,
A brief history given by United
States Senator George Q. Perkins of the
manner in which the appropriations for
the improvement of Oakland harbor
were placed on the continued contract
basis is especially interesting.
More than twenty years ago a board
of engineers, of which Colonel George
Mendell, U. S. A., was chairman, pre
pared plans for the improvement of
the harbor. The engineers estimated
that the sum of $800,000 would be re
quired to carry out the scheme of im
provement according to the plans sub
mitted. After the adoption of the
plans the Government proceeded with
the work.
The chief obstacle to the progress of
the improvement was the failure of
Congress to make annual allowances
of money. One year a sufficient sum
would be obtained, but the following
year nothing would be allowed. In or
der to facilitate the work, Senators
White and Perkins employed their en
ergies in the direction of having the
amount estimated by the engineers
placed on the continuous contract basis
in the appropriation system.
Two years ago the Senators succeed
ed in their purpose, and the appropria
tion, amounting to $500,000, the unex
pended balance of the original estimate
of $800,000, is now being disbursed un
der the continuous contract system.
The definite appropriation for the im
provement was thus secured by the en
terprise and sagacity of the Senate del
egation, and the amounts annually dis
bursed now conform to the estimates
rendered by the engineers. In this di
rection, Senator Perkins being a mem
ber of the Committee on Appropria
tions was able to contribute much to
the success of the cause.
In an interview yesterday Senator
Perkins said: "I do not want The Call
to give me exclusive credit for this
result, but you can say that the credit
belongs to the Senate delegation. The
appropriations will continue from year
to year until the balance of the $800,000
originally estimated by Colonel Mendell
is expended. Looking back over the
records since 1875 you will find that our
representatives in Congress failed at
times to secure any appropriation of
money to carry out the improvement.
But this will not occur again. The
Oakland harbor improvement is now in
the system of continuc-us work along
with the improvement of the Columbia
River and Humboldt Bay. My posi
tion on the Appropriation Committee
enabled me to accomplish much in this
direction. Now, at the last sessic-n for
example, I had the words 'under exist
ing project' inserted so the item now
reads: 'Improving harbor, Oakland,
California: For continuing improve
ments under existing project, one hun
dred and thirty-five thousand dollars.'
I secured an appropriation of $4000 for
the Yosemite National Park, the first
ever obtained. General Grant and
Sequoia parks were included in the bill
as it came from the committee, but the
Items were not allowed."
REGISTRATION IS
ABOUT TO CLOSE
ONLY SIX DAYS MORE LEFT
FOR TARDY CITIZENS.
Registrar Biggy Declines to Register
the Volunteer Soldiers From
Other Counties.
The Election Commissioners held a short
session yesterday morning and then ad
journed out of respect to the memory of
the late Mayor Sutro. Outside of mak
ing a few changes In precincts where It
was found that substitution of officers
was necessary no business of moment
was transacted. A set of resolutions reg
ulating the precinct boards of registration
was unanimously adopted. The rules pro
vide that summary dismissal shall follow
any misconduct on the part of any offi
cer; that at no time shall there be less
than two officers on duty, and that under
no circumstances shall liquor be allowed
in any registration place.
Registration closes at the New City
Hall vo-night. and it. is expected that
there will be a big rush. The indications
are that not 50 per cent of the vote will
be registered before then and that the
precinct registration officers will, during
their five days of service, be called upon
to register from 32.000 to 35,000 citizens.
Two representatives from the Los An
geles company of volunteer soldiers sta
tioned here called at the Registrar's of
fice yesterday to ascertain if they and
theirassoelates could lypgister. Registrar
Blggy replied in tht> negative. He said
that they were under the control and
supervision of the I'nited States Govern
ment; that this city and county was not
their place of residence as they were
liable to be called away at any moment.
There are many c;ises cited by Registrar
Biggy to sustain him in the stand he
took. In the case of Devlin vs. Ander
son, 38 California Reports, the court held
that "mere presence as a soldier of the
United States in obedience to military
orders does not make residence in the
sense of the constitution and laws rela
tive to the elective franchise." In the
Fifteenth California is another decision
to the effect that the "mere fact that a
man is a. soldier In the I'nited States
army does' not disqualify him from vot
ing in this State. But he cannot vote un
less he has been a citizen of the State
and of the county in which he votes, to*
the constitutional period."

MINERS TALK
OF LYNCH LAW
Desperate Klondikers at
St. Michael.
Lynch law Is talked of in St. Michael.
The stranded miners are having a hard
time of it, and if they do not get up the
river to Dawson there will be trouble.
The following extracts from a couple of
letters contain a lot of interesting in
formation:
ST. MICHAEL, July 22.â Owing to the
number of river steamers lost on the
way, the majority of the ocean steamers
here are In serious trouble. There are
not over eight or ten river steamers in
the. bay, outside of those owned by the
â¦ North American Transportation and
Trading Company and the Alaska Com
mercial Company, and of these at least
two-thirds are English. Up to date none
of the much talked of Moran fleet have
arrived, nor are they likely to.
Captain Daniels brought the dredger
| Lavelle Young through in good shape,
though she 1 was two days' outside of the
inland passage on June "3 and . 84, on
which days so many river steamers were
lost.
There are at least 508 passengers here
on these, ocean steamers who were
booked through to Dawson and other
river points, and who are In pretty bad
shape, owing to the companies who
booked them having no means of getting
them -up the river. Consequently there is
much trouble and rumors of trouble in
the air. The National City, Albion and
Rufus E. Wood passengers, together with
I some twenty odd from the Humboldt,
that were sent up by the Alaska-Yukon
Transportation Company, brought suit
against the company ami. attached the
coal and lumber aboard the Kufus E.
Wood. The agent in charge of the com- â 
pany's affairs, Captain Hatfleld, made an
assignment for the benefit of the passen
gers, and it remains to be seen Just what
they will get out of it. The assets here
amount to very little, according to re
ports.
The Brinham was forced to give a
bottomry bond to the North American
Transportation and Trading Company to
secure provisions enough for their pas
sengers. The Progresio's passengers are
In equally as bad shape, and it is hard to
tell what the end will be. Any quantity
of passengers who had the means gave
up expecting the companies who booked
them to do anything, so left them
and paid their passage up the river In, I
some of the few outside steamers that got j
through.
The minute the two big companies
heard of the losses of river steamers
they lamped their tare to Dawson from
$150 to $250. and limited the passengers
to Â£50 pounds of freight each. Conse
quently, any one with four or live tons
'jf an outfit was shut out. The com
mander in charse of the island will not
allow passengers to be landed against
their will, so the probabilities are that
those who cannot make other arrange
ments will have to be taken back to their
starting point.
Those parties of from four to ten who :
came up this far with knocked down ;
boats or lumber and material to build '
boats, appear tO be the best off, and
there are at least twenty-five of them,
all of whom will get off within the com
ing month. Should any more river steam
era and barges get through from the coast
or even should some of those that went ,
up th* river early get back for a second
trip affairs here may brighten, otherwise
we may Bee. trouble, for there are some
passengers who threaten even lynching i
if they are not taken care of.
We hear conflicting stories from up the
river, but on the whole there is lots of I
gold there, judging from reports. The
discontented ones are usually men who
couldn't even do a day's work at home,
let alone In such a climate as Alaska's,
consequently they become discouraged and
sell out their provisions for enough to get
out on and came back. I have talked
with several who went in over the trail
and who stayed In and around Dawson
for from one day to two weeks and then
took the first steamer for home.
It is reported that there are about seven !
or eight river steamers high and dry on
bars in the Yukon, some with no pros
pects of getting off. Others are more fav
orably situated as the river is Improving,
though the water was extremely low at
the start. The channel changes every

ing quite a boom, while the.Tananna is
attracting much attention. Provisions are
still high and will be higher after the
numerous outfits thrown upon the mar
ket by disgruntled parties are consumed,
and there are more parties of this caliber
than you could Imagine. However, it is
not thought that prices will be as. high
as last year, for there will be no such
scarcity. Both the big companies are
straining every nerve to. get tho lr stocks
up the river, and owing to the small
limit put upon their passengers' freight
they have succeeded pretty well. Of
course, this will force people to buy from
them when they get up there, but that
is a business proposition.
The steamer Herman is expected here
any time, and the sidewheel steamer
Sadie (hence Juno 23) arrived July 19 in
good shape. She is a valuable addition
to the fleet and la towing on the harbor.
The custom house has been shifted to
new quarters in a building erected by the
Alaska Commercial Company, and the
United States inspectors of hulls and boil
ers will follow them in a few days. The
Inspectors have had their hands full since
their arrival and have been compelled to
do all their work in their sleeping room,
so the change, will be appreciated.

a purse and a great time is expected. The
place of battle will be on the canal, about
four miles up the bay. Nobody says a
word about the affair, as it is the "first

are afraid of its being stopped. Every
thing, however, is arranged for and the

I fight with skin gloves.
Prom one of the officers of the steamer
Leelanaw that arrived last Saturday it
| has been learned that the fight did not
: take place. The commander at St. BU
; ohael put his foot down so the "scientific
exhibition" was postponed to another and
store favorable occasion. L. R. Fulda, the
I one time president of the California Ath
1. tic Club, was at St. Michael when the
i flght was arranged and it was he who
was instrumental in bringing the men to
gether. Fulda followed the ica down the
liver from Dawson in an open boat and
when the fight was postponed he went
1 back to I lawson on the steamer Linda. He

bought up all the firewood on the river
for nis company.

!. ,i\<- for Dawson to-night. Nothing
grand has so far been reported in tho
Shape of mining strikes. The Kuikuk
rives is much more prospected and some
good claims have hÂ£en located high up on
the tributaries. It is hard to got up there.
as many rapids and riffles have to be
passed and a swift current makes naviga
tion very slow.
The steamer Mary West leaves for
Dawson oa July 24. She has over a hun
dn d passengers. About twenty small
craft have pone up the river and about
twenty more are getting ready. Several
era are detained, not being able to
procure masters or pilots. The ware
houses and every available place are full
of freight. No more places can go up as
no more lumber is procurable. The last
lut of tongued and grooved stuff was sold
yesterday at $100 per thousand."

Wife of a Man in Hia
Debt.
Special Dispatch to Tho CalL
SAN JOSE, Aug. B.â Another of Rea's
school trustees has disgraced himself
and dishonored the voters who were
hoodwinked into supporting him on the
plea that he was a "good fellow." This
time it Is Byron Furinton, trustee of
Gardner School District, adjoining the
â¢city. His offense is a serious one
against the morals of the community,
and he is said to be making prepara
tions to leave the county.
This matter, coming so close upon the
expose of Trustee Graham's connection
with the Cottage Grove Kindergarten,
and other irregularities of the City
School Board, is likely to have an ill
effect upon the city. Such doings as
these will keep away many people who
otherwise would bring their children to
San Jose to be educated in the local
schools.
The story of Purinton's trouble is an
old one â that of a harsh and crabbed
old money lender making love to his
mortgagor's wife, â¢who refuses his at
tentions and is then threatened with
eviction. This is the substance of the
tale, the opening chapter of which be
gan about a year ago, when John San
ders and his wife borrowed $600 from
Purinton. This was to enable Sanders
to go into the hay and wuod business
on ihe corner of the Alameda and Wil
son avenue. Sanders gave a mortgage
to secure this sum on his little home
near the Gardner School. He lived
next door to the money lender and had
the most implicit faith in him.
A couple of weeks ago Purinton
proved himself a scoundrel, and now
the little district of Gardner is up in
arms over his actions. The sentiment
is so strong again Pur^ton that should
he fail to leave the neighborhood he
may be driven from it.
Early last month Sanders* mortgage
fell due. He went to Purinton and
asked him if he wanted the money, and
the latter replied in the negative, say
ing that it could run so long as San
ders wanted it to, as all ha wanted was
the interest.
A week later Purinton invited Mrs.
Sanders and her baby to take a ride
to Los Gatos with him. The woman
consented, thinking Purinton was an
honorable man. On the trip he made
improper advances to her, finally
threatening to rutn her home. Purin
ton told her he was a man of great in
fluence with "Boss" Rea and if she
told her husband he would ruin him
financially. Not only this, but he
would make it so hot for the Sanders
that they would be compelled to leave
town.
Mrs. Sanders, in order to stop his in
sulting remarks, consented to meet him
the following day. She said nothing
to her husband, as she thought the mat
ter would end with her nut keeping the
appointment.
Not BO with Purinton. When he saw
the woman had deceived him he went
to Sanders and demanded immediate
satisfaction of his mortgage. Sanders
told his wile that evening of Purin
ton's action, and then the woman re
luted her experiences with the money
lender. Sanders at once started out to
look for Purinton. He called at the
latter's home, and when Purinton saw
him he hid. Sanders sent word to him
to come out into the street and settle
things like a man, but Purinton re
fused.
For several days Sanders repeated his
calls at the Purinton home, with
threats of vengeance. This frightened
the trustee to such an extent that he
sought safety in San Francisco. Sev
eral days ago he returned to his homo,
but has remained in hiding since his
arrival.
Now the neighbors have taken the
matter up and are determined to rid
themselves of the man. Purinton was
interested in a mortgage sale on Sat
urday, but he was so frightened he
failed to appear at the place. This has
not satisfied Sanders and when the two
men meet there bids fair to be trou
ble.
Mrs. Sanders is a pretty and petite
woman of about 28 years, while Purin
ton is CO.
Purinton served several terms as
school trustee in Gardner District some
years ago. In 1896 he was re-elected as
a Rea candidate, and he has openly
boasted that he was close enough to
the "boss" to run things to suit him
self in the district. At the last elec
tion he succeeded in making his daugh
ter, Beulah Purinton, a burden on the
Gardner taxpayers by creating for her
a position in the school.
A few days ago Purinton tendered his
resignation as trustee. He did this to
save himself the humiliation of being
ousted, and from preparations he is
making it is presumed he is going to
leave the city to save the people of
Gardner the trouble of running him
out.

"If We Were One In Aims and Ob

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW 'YORK, Aug. B.â Hiram S.
Maxim, inventor of the Maxim gun and
a staunch American, has received a
letter from Lord Wolseley, oommander
of the British army, who expresses the
warmest advocacy of a close union be
tween the United States and Great
Britain.
Mr. Maxim arrived from England last
Saturday. He says everywhere he
found the greatest enthusiasm when
the project of a union of the branches
of the Anglo-Saxon race was men
tioned. The inventor has begun a
campaign for a unity of the race on
his own account. It was in reply to a
communication from him advocating
his cherished plan that Lord Wolseley
wrote this letter, a copy of which, with
the permission of the English com
mander, Mr. Maxim has given to The
Call. The letter is as follows:
"War Office, London, S. W.â Dear Mr.
Maxim: Your letter of the 13th inst. is
intensely interesting to me, and I fully
Indorse all you say about the absolute
necessity of the closest possible union
between all sections of the Anglo-
Saxon race. If we two nations â Great
Britain and the United Statesâ were
one in their alms and objects and de
manded that peace on earth which in
sures good will among men, no foreign
nation would dare fire a shot without
our leave.
"I am sending on your letter to be
read by others, for I think your pro
posed campaign would be worth to us
far more than a dozen Wei-Hai-Weisor
Soudans, and to you more than Cuba,
Manila and the whole kingdom of
Ferdinand and Isabella thrown in. I
will let you know by and by. With
very kind regards to you and Mrs.
Maxim believe me to be yours,
"WOLSELEY.

AN INCBEASED COMMEBCE.
Pacific Ports Make the Best Becord
of Any Group.
NEW YORK, Aug. B.â A special to the
Times from Washington says: Represen
tatives of the great ports of the United
States will be interested in some of the
figures which the Bureau of Statistics of
the Treasury Department has Just com
piled regarding the import and export
trade of. the various ports of the country
and comparing the year's business with
that of preceding years. ..... ,
Our increased commerce with Asia and
Oceanica has materially and advantage
ously affected the bu-sipcs3 of the ports on
the Pacific Coast. â¢ ...
The Pacific ports made the most satis
factory record of any group, their gain in
exports being 23.7 per cent, while they ac
tually gained in Imports 16. 4 -par cent.
Pacific Coast ports, as already indicated,
show a gain both in imports and exports.
San Francisco exported in 1893 3.34 per cent
of the total exports of the 'â  country,
against 3.08 per cent in 1895. 2.79 per cent
in lv.'l, %M per cent in 1892 and 4.24 per
cent in ISM). Her percentage of the im
ports was in IS9S, C.98 per cent; in 1897, 1..".
per cent; in 1895, 4.95 per cent, and in ISM,
18 per cent. The Puget Sound customs
district gained materially in its share of
the commerce of the country, its exports
in 1593 being 1.45 per cent of the total,
against 1.13 per cent in 1597, .78 in 18%, .55
in 1?93 and .39 in 1890, while the imports of

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAUSALITO, Aug. B.â "Thank God
we are safe! A million dollars would
not tempt me to undergo the experi
ence again."
It was Miss .<Jlce Hagerman, a well
known metropolitan belle, who breathed
this fervent prayer of gratitude. She
stood on the wharf of the San Francis
co Yacht Club house In company with
two companions â Arthur D. Naylor, a
bank clerk, and Miss Sullivan. All
were dripping wet from an involuntary
bath in the waters of the bay, for theirs
was as narrow an escape from death
as ever was recorded.
The two ladles have been passing: a
few days In Sausalito. Yesterday they
took a long sail on the yacht Twilight,
owned by Nay lor. They returned and
anchored their craft early in the even-
Ing. About 8 o'clock one of the young
ladies remembered an article left on
board and -xaylor rowed them out to
get it. As they were about to return
Miss Hagerman, who was the last to
leave the yacht, stepped on the gun
wale of the skiff. The frail craft cap
sized and plunged all three into the
water.
A strong tide was running and Nay
lor was unable to catch hold of the
skiff. With great presence of mind he
instructed the terror-stricken girls to
hold on to his shoulders and started to
swim for the yacht "Will-o'-the-Wisp.
He had nearly covered the distance,
fully one hundred yards, when Miss
Sullivan's fright caused her to grasp
him around the neck, nearly strangling
the athletic swimmer. He managed to
release her hold and catching the girl
by an arm covered the remaining dis
tance, swimming with one arm. Secur
ing a grip on the stern of the yacht
Naylor yelled for help.
Mathias Lang, steward at the San
Francisco Yacht Club house, heard the
cries and set out to the rescue. It was
so dark as almost to render objects un
discernlble and as Naylor'3 cries grew
fainter through exhaustion Lang had
a hard task to discover the unfortunate
party. The rescue was accomplished
just as Naylor's fingers were slipping
from their hold through sheer exhaus
tion.

Large Band Condemned
at Hanford.

TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND IN j
THE BUNCH.
Government Inspector Refuses to Al
low Stock to Be Sent Out
of the State From
That Section.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, Aug. B.â The Government
has refused to allow stock from this
part of the State to be shipped out of
California on account of the prevalence
of Texas fever among the herds.
To-day Carey Brothers, Omaha buy
ers of cattle, had 25,000 head of stock
condemned at Hanford by Dr. C. H.
Blemer, chief Government inspector for
California. Not all the animals were
affected nor even a small part of the
band, but the disease was found in a
number of them and hence the whole
band was condemned. The inspector
would not allow apparently well ones
to be segregated from feverish cattle
and shipped on, for the reason that
they had been exposed to the disease
and he feared they might develop it
en route.
Had Carey Brothers bought the stock
unconditionally they would have lost
between $25,000 and $50,000 on the deal,
but they purchased it on condition that
it would pass inspection by the Govern
ment authorities. The large band is
now at Hanford, whither It had been
shipped to board cars for Omaha, but
it will have to be taken now by its
former owners.

the request: M _ ,_
"Resolved, That the corporation of Dub
lin is strongly of the opinion that no
statues should be erected in Dublin in
honor of any Englishman until the Irish
people have erected a fitting one In mem
ory of Charles Stewart Parnell."
After several speeches, among them one
by Councilor Thornton, who said It could
not be forgotten that Gladstone "laid a
heavy hand upon the Nationalists," ' the
resolution was adopted unanimously amid
cheering.

There was a clergyman in a Long Island village who suf*. 1
fered from dyspepsia to such an extent that it positively seemed
sometimes as though his doctrine was not sound. It was, however,
only a stomach trouble, and had nothing to do with the mind.
Being convinced of this, one of his parishioners, a lady, presented
him with a small quantity of Ripans Tabules and the relief he ex-
perienced was such that all the congregation noticed an improve-
ment, and now, although his salary is small, this clergyman and
his wife devote a portion of it to keeping the medicine closet
stocked with a suitable supply of Ripans Tabules. Doubtless
there are many cases where what has been thought heresy was in
fact nothing more nor less than dyspepsia, and Ripans Tabules cure
dyspepsia. One gives relief. ' /

EASTERN MARKETS.
XEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Aug. S.â The stock market to
day was under one of the halting pro*
which is usual in a strong advance,
â when the general trend nf prices Is upward for
a long period, the movement i.s very rarely
uninterrupted. Halts and reactions are n<>rr:i;il
processes even In a strong mark. t. and are to
be looked for even In the continuance of favor
able conditions. There was such a halt for a
time to-day, and it looked as though the re
actionists had gained the upper hand,
taking began from the start In some of, the
recent favorites and held them back while the
re?t of the market was rising buoyantly on the
outside orders which had come Into
houses during the Sunday Interval. The volume
of these orders was large and indicated a
growth of confidence by the outside power In
the value of securities. But the disposition to
take profits on the strength of this out.
mand caused a feeling of doubt In the minds
of room traders and the rumor got Into circu
lation that the large m which
bought stocks last week were celling out. The
proresslonal bears thereupon rushed to sell
about the time when accumulated eorm:.
house orders had been executed. The bears
were also inclined to take a skeptical view of
the reported acceptance by Spain of the terms
of peace. Earlier gains were wiped out in
practically all cases, the market falling below
Saturday's level. At this p.jint very large
blocks of stocks began to be taken again, and
before the close them was almost a complete
recovery, a number of the Industrials, notably
Tobacco, leather preferred, the malting stocks
and stocks of some of the iron and su-el com
panies, showed conspicuous advances. The late
movement of the market is likely to create the
suspicion that the reaction was looked ujen
complacently by the moneyed men who have
assumed the leadership oi the market.
The pressure of funds for investment In se
curities paying a fair rate of interest and
reasonably safe gave continued strength to
bonds to-day. Total sale-.
The new Government 2s. when Issued, showed
a decline of 't> in the bid price. Otherwise
there was no 'â hanse in Government bonds.

NEW YORK, Aug. The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here opened good to-day on the pros
pects of peace between the United States and
Spain, and consequently Americans led In the
upward movement. But the buying was prin
cipally from New York. Here Interest Is
aroused," but nothing more. The New York
buying of bonds Is still heavy.
Spanish securities were strong, but closed
under the best.
The feature to-day was the sharp fall In
DeÃeers diamond shares. They were heavily
sold here and from the Cape. The fall was
accompanied by rumors of difficulty In renew
ing the next contracts, a falling off in the
quality of the stones and that the next Cape
Government may place an especial tax on dia

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Aug. Higher cables and small
receipts started September wheat %c above
the price it closed Saturday. Sellers at the ad
vance were so numerous, however, that the
buying orders in the market at that time were
Immediately filled. Offerings still continued In
such heavy volume after this demand was sat
isfied that a quick decline set in, knocking lc
a bushel oft the opening figures. The change
from so much strength at the opening to its
succeeding weakness was due to selling of
long wheat by heavy trailers, who anticipated
a freer movement in the near future from first
hands. They knew that If they waited for Its
realization It would probably be impossible to
dispose of their holdings at any such prices.
Among the reasons for continued weakness
were heavy estimated receipts for to-morrow
and some crop reports of a bearish char
acter. The shipping demand here was even
more urgent than at any time during the pre
vious week's advancing market. As high as
7 cents premium over September price was
paid for one lot of No. 2 red. and plenty more
could have been disposed of at the same pre
mium but for holders advancing their views
to 7-V". September closed lViSl%e lower and
December lift He lower.
Ample rains Saturday and Sunday started
corn easy to-day. The decline was only tem
porary, however, as reports of crop prospects
were far from giving assurance of a satisfac
tory yield. The close was He higher than
Saturday.
Reports of rust and blight had a brilliant
effect In oats for a time, but this feeling wore
off as wheat continued to grow lower. Sep
tember .closed %c lower.
Prov!Tions, Hke wheat, declined In spite of.
bullish suggestions. Receipts of hogs were
small and prices at the yards were higher.
Owing to a lack of demand, however, prices
sagged oft readily on some scattered selling.

â  These historians had already provided

â  "maiehipe-"' politicians.
â¢;. : â¢ F-or -.weeks there has hardly been a
â  gatiieFi;:g- of the doctor's sympathizers
. : but "some, speakerâ either Pardee himself
â¢.or. one of his lieutenantsâ has solemnly
assured his auditors that Dr. Pardee wad

' very respectable vote polled, for almost
without exception the Democrats are de
termined to take this means of voicing
their protest against the garroting of the
party by McNab, Alford, Gould, et al. In
â  the Third Ward there may be a little
rumpus between the Foote and Fitzgerald
I factions. That ward has been allotted
three delegates. Foote has already been
I chosen as delegate-at-large and his fac
tion, headed by Frank Moffltt, thinks it
I would be the proper thing for each crowd
â¢ to take one of the two remaining places.
I Fitzgerald's forces arc inclined to make a
j struggle for both places, but even of they
i do it will merely signify that the old fac
â  tional feud is still on and will have little
I or nothting to do with the overwhelming
j sentiment against gag rule. Maguire has
â¢ a strong following among thÂ« Alameda
! Democrats: then is no gainsaying that,
j but even they are disposed to question the
I arbitrary manner in which fusion with
) the Populists was effected as un-Demo
j cratic. while as for the methods of Whis
i pering McNab and his allies, they de-
I nounee thorn in characteristically plain
I Democratic language.
The Federal brigade, aided and abetted
! by the county and municipal crowd, has
' been cut loose to bolster up Tlilborn's
j Congressional fight. Last Saturday night
â  there was a meeting of the Army and
! Navy Republican League, the largest and i
! most influential political organization in
| the county, having a membership of up
â¢ ward of 900. Every member of the club
j employed in the Mint, Custom House
j and other Federal departments, including
Joe Standeford, W. H. Adams, R. C. J.
! Adney. Cyrus Ellis. G. "W. Harbinger
[ and others, together with William C.
I Barnes, of the Sixth street fire company,
i and other members if the Fire and Street
i Departments were present.
This crowd was mustered for the sole
; purpose of capturing the club for Hil-
I born, and made a detennnit â  effort to
i carry out its purpose. President George
I W. Hoguet anil other Metcalf men, how- I
j ever, stood off the gang and prevented
! the raid. There will be another meeting
j of the club next Saturday night when the
J gang will moke another onslaught, but j
i the friends of Metcalf, having full knowl- !
] edge of what has been planned will be j
I able to again defeat them. But there will
j be a lively time at the meeting just the
same.
The situation in the Forty-eighth As
! sembly District Is of much genera] inter
est. This district was represented in the
i last Legislature by Assemblyman Frank
!M. Leavitt, who is now making appar
j ently a winning fight to succeed the late
: Ell Denlson in the State Senate. The
| district consists of <'â â â  Fourth. Sixth and
i two precincts of the Fifth Ward. Super
' visor Church will be the nominee to sue-
I ceed himself from the Fourth Ward. As
! semblyroan L^avitt has the Sixth well in
! hand, and It is considered to be good pol
i (tics to take the Assemblyman from the
section of the Fifth W"rd. So far the
I candidates are W. Nat Friend, surer
| of the Young Mien's Republican League,
j and Paul Goldsmith, who was beaten by
Hart North at the last county conven
tion for the nomination from the Forty
ninth District. It Is generally conceded
i that it would be folly to give the nomina
! tion to Goldsmith, because he is no
strontrer now than when he n*>vrd out of
the district where he was defeated, and
since that time he has met with" two
other political reversals, one when he |
tried to secure a Yosemlte commissioner- '.
) ship from 'he present Democratic Gov
j ernor. and another when he attempted to
be named as the successor from the Fifth
Ward to Tom Robinson on the Republi
can county central committee.
It has been reported that there is yet
: another candidate for the nomination,
but thf gentleman named positively de
clares that under no conditions would he
sf>ek an office, and therefor* II looks as
though W. Nat Friend would capture the
i nomination.
STILL REFUSE TO PAVE.
Haywards Electric Railway Officials
May Have Criminal Proceed
ings to Answer.
OAKLAND, Aug. B.â President Meeks. Super
intendent Oustafsnn and Secretary McLenegen
of the Haywards electric road have been noti
fied by Street Superintendent Miller to begin
work on that portion of Twelfth street occu
pied by its tracks and two feet each side
thereof; the pavement of âooden blocks to con
form with that of the balance of the street. If
the company falls within five days to comply
with this order criminal proceedings will be
begrun against the officer.".
Prudent Meeks if the Oakland, San Leandro
and Hay-wards electric railway, commenting
on the matter to-day said:
"I have been advised by our attorneys that
one story of stone work and three of
structural iron rise in a confused mass
above the face of the earth, forming a
nesting place for vermin, a home for
spiders and an unsightly blotch on the
landscape. Indignant property owners
I look askance at the unsightly pile and
curse a city government that allows such
j things to be, but aside from this nobody
seems to care.
The contractors don't care, for all they
have to do is to go up to the Board of
Supervisors with any kind of a story, and
a further extension of time is granted.
The architects don't care, because the
longer it takes to finish the building the
longer their jobs will last. The superin
tendents of construction don't care for
the same reason, and the workmen live in
hopes of seeing their grandchildren cheer
fully carrying the hod up to the second
story.
From time to time the property own
ers have held indignation meetings and
laid their cases before the proper au
thorities, but their answer has practi
cally been, "We know It's so, and what
are you going to do about it?" â l> V^
An enterprising Grand Jury took the
matter up, and after making the custo
mary Investigation made the discovery
that Bateman Bros, had been unable to
make a favorable deal in terra cotta, and
"had just got a plant of their own in
working order near Stockton." What has
become of this plant has not "been ex
plained but Bateman Bros, have let the
contract to a firm which has been in busi
ness for many years They also claim
that they keep a full force of men on the
building continually, but if this is the
rase they must have brought a cargo
from splritland, as a half-dozen men,
working in a leisurely manner, has been
th The origina rr i C contract called for the com
pletion or" the building on October 1. .1897.
Cut owing to some delay in clearing away
debris from the foundation an extension
of time was granted. It was soon . seen,
however that it would be impossible for
?h<T contractors to complete it in the fur
ther time allowed and another howl was
raised With an air of injured Innocence
the favored contractors again came for
ward with a fairy tale; it was delay In
â¦ i,'i thlnment of the structural iron work
and tnaf terrible difficulty in finding a
firm capable of turning out terra cotta of
thThigh grade required: of course they
would never accept anything that was not

Si- has strained every* nerve, but he has
had troubles-and people have been bo un

He really wanted that building completed
on October 1 1897. and now after all his
toil and trouble he admits that it cannot
be finished by October 1, 1898, but. and
here he brightens- visibly, perhaps a fux-

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 9, 1898.
the city cannot compel us to pave the street
with wooden blocks. "We are willing to keep
the street In flrst-class condition by macadam
izing it. I submitted two propositions to the
Street Superintendent last week. One was that,
as the Council had decided Twelfth street to be
a public highway having extraordinary use
and had agreed to pay half the cost to prop
erty-owners for the improvements, that the
Council treat our company the same way. In
that event we would improve the street at
once.
"The second preposition was for us to Im
mediately macadamize the street between the
rails and then have a friendly suit to test the
liability of the company in the matter. If the
present plan Is carried out we might be com

FIRE DEMOLISHES
THREE DWELLINGS
COAL OIL STOVE EXPLODES IN
A EAYWABDS HOME.
As There Was Hardly Any Water the
Firemen Did Good Work Sav

Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway. Aug 8.
The explosion of a coai oil stove and
the Lack of water caused a serious flre at
rardfl this morning. Three houses
were destroyed and "William Zambresky
was overcome by the heat.
Shortly before noon a coal oil stove in
the home of George A. Toyne, the well
known Pi'puli.st politician, exploded and
at once set fire to the furniture. The
alarm was given and the flre department
to get a stream of water on
uildlng, but with littlÂ« success. The
houses in the vicinity have been rendered
so inflammable by the heat of the past
tew days that a few sparks quickly set

the â¢. x plosion three buildings were in
Seeing that they could do but
lilt!.- toward extinguishing the fire, the
;<r< â¢!â â¢ :i directed all their energy to sav
ing the property and nearly everything
was carried out of the burning houses
with the exception of some of the house
hold furniture of George Toyne.
The three dwellings were burned to the
ground. Toyne owned two of the houses,
ami J. Bjorhelm was the owner of the
ays that his losses repre
sent the s;t\ings of his lifetime as a
hard-working carpenter.
There is only a two-inch main on R
. â¢ where the fire occurred, and as
the houses were more than three blocks
from a hydrant, the supply of water ob
tainable was very small and practioally
useless, although the department made
tiie best use of the little stream at their
disposal.
William Zambreskey was carrying out
i furniture when the heat became so great
i that he swooned and had to be taken from
the blazing building. An aged lady, Mrs.
J. Rose, also met with a broken arm. She
- was going to the fire, and owing to the
I crowd she was pushed in front of a cy
clist who knocked her down, causing the
! fracture.
There have been several large fires in
; Haywards during the past three years,
! and on each occasion there has been a
; demand for larger mains, and it is now
said that the property owners will at once
improve the water system of the town.
Is Now a Galley Cook.
OAKLAND, Aug. B.â Charlie Longfellow
Clark, once prosperous and moving about In
the upper circles of society, 19 now an assist
ant cook on the tramp steamer NinK Chow,
which Is lying in the estuary. His old home
was in Louisiana and his folks were Influen
tial and cultured people. Charlie was a stu
dent .'it Yale and graduated with high honors
and finally put out a shingle as an M. D. He
v.as thriving when suddenly stricken down
with paralysis. After he partially recovered
he concluded that he had no more home and
disappeared. He finally became stranded In
IVparture Hay. British Columbia, and at a loss
of any other way to get out. he shipped as as
sistant cof'k on the King Chow, which leaves
again for China to-morrow. Clark's memory
seems to have deserted him and he has no
recollection of many incidents that happened
before his sickness. He seems happy that his
folks have been- unable to locate him.
Power From Blue Lakes.
OAKLAND, Aug. B.â T. B. Bullock was
granted a franchiHe by the Board of Supervis
on this afternoon to erect pole's on one side
of the count}- road to the County Infirmary for
the purpose of conducting electric light and
power into Oakland from the Butter Creek
I hint at Blue Lakes. Mr. Bullock represents
the Standard Electric Company. The franchise
la for fifty > ears and In return the company
agrees to furnish light at the County Infirmary
free of charge. The company already has fran
chises through Amador, (""alttveras, San Joaquln
and Contra / ~"o?ta counties and private fran
chises from 1 ere to the Infirmary.
Disgusted With a Client.
OAKLAND. Aug. B.â The divorce suit of Car
oline Madsen agaT.nst Ole Madsen came up be
fore JudÂ«e Greene to-day, but Attorney Gib
son, who represented defendant In a previous
property right rase, failed to materialize and
It was ascertained that he had become dis
gusted with his client, refusing to try the
case. Mr. U Isen afterward declared that he,
had not a dollar; that his wife had taken -It
all away from him and left him a poor crip
ple without a penny. He agreed to let his wife
have a divorce If she would not press for ali
mony, but this her attorney refused to con
cede.
Protest Against Rebuilding.
OAKLAND. Aug. B.â The petition of resi
dents of Fruitvale and Brooklyn Township
asking the Hoard of Supervisors to pass an or
dinance prohibiting the rebuilding of the fuse
works and powder storehouses at ICetroM win
be heard at a special meeting of the board as
a committee of the whole, next Thursday morn
ing at 10 o'clock. E. H. Marwedel and V. W.
Judson, chairman and secretary respectively of
the petitioners, will be so notified. It Is ex
pected also that representatives of the powder
and fuse works will be present.
Ah, here was a happy thought. On sec
ond consideration he was almost certain
that more time would be given. He has
mor>- reasons for this than there are
bricks in the building, and every one a
winner. He also hints at the possibility
of being ;ii>l<- to force his claim for more
time in the courts if necessary. What
are the reasons?
Well, the chief one seems to be that the
all mighty head of the Police Department
wants changes made in the plans. He
doesn't want the whole building, but he.
does want all of one floor, and Mr. Bate
inan Is considerately delaying the work of
putting in partitions on this floor until
he flndp out just what will be done, as
he "wants to save the city the expense
of putting in the partitions and then hav
ing them torn down and rearranged."
He al?o figures rhat he will be able to
make a good showing by that date; that
r>in*-t*>nths of the work will be done.
"The terra r-otta will be here in two
weeks; the lathing will be here in two
weeks: the iron for the partitions will be
here in two weeks; the flooring will bo
here in two weeks, and a big force of
men will be on the ground," perhaps to
complete the cabalistic chain and flniÃh
the building in two w^eks more.
And still the property owners will com
plain!

ADVOCATING A
PEACE JUBILEE
State Celebration May.
Be Held in Oakland.
A HINT FROM CHICAGO
UNDER CONSIDERATION BY THE
BOARD OF TRADE.
Vice President Keller Sees Many Rea
sons Why the Signing of a
Treaty Should Be a
Great Occasion.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 8.
The Board of Trade has received a
communication from the National Busi
ness League of Chicago asking co-opera
tion in the matter of arranging a great
national peace jubilee. The programme
outlined by the league consists largely
of pageantry typical of the progress of
America from the landing of the Pil
grim Fathers up to the present time. It
is proposed by the Chicagoans to keep the
celebration up for a whole week.
"This project of a great peace jubilee,"
said M. J. Keller, vice-president of the
Board of Trade, to-day, "is a good one,
but it is absurd to think that Chicago
Should have the benefit of it all. We
want just such a jubilee right here in
Oakland. The birth of the idea in Chi
cago is typical of that city. It Is the
first to "disseminate nearly everything
that is original and popular and that
must of necessity bo successful. In this
respect it Is far ahead ot New York and
the older Eastern cities. Now there is
HO reason why Oakland should not take
the lead in this matter on the coast. This
city If altogether too modest, and in such
affairs as this is not as lively as Los
Angeles. it was proved on the last
Fourth of July that we could give a bet
ter celebration than San Francisco, and
crowds of people crossed the bay to wit
ness it. As a matter of fact, San Fran
cisco cannot advance a site "n which a
great demonstration can be held, and aa
to a parade, let those who have paraded
in the big city answer.
"The matter is now being considered
by the directors of the Board of Trade.
By the time peace Is assured and its ar
ticles have been Signed by both nations
everybody will have returned from tnelr
summer vacations, and the time will be
ripe for a great Jubilee. It should be hold
here" and if tho proper steps are taken
I have no doubt a truly representative
jubilee could be arranged."

JUDGE BELCHER DISMISSES THE
IMPORTANT SUIT.
All Parties Interested in the Action
Agree Upon a Compromise and
Judgment Is Entered
Accordingly.
Litigation for a settlement of conflict
ing interests in the co-partnership of Mil

of the estate of George Lux, deceased,
and as administrator of the estate of
Dorothea Roehrig, deceased. Marguerite
Lux and Henry Lux and Tflarguerite Lux,

of Henry Miller, surviving partner of the
co-partnership of Miller & i.ux and ac
cepting all purchases of property made
by him and approving the accounts and
books kept by him as surviving partner,
decreeing that the books were correct
and that in all respects Henry Miller had
accounted fully for all moneys, property
and assets of the co-partnership. In ad
dition the court was requested to adjudge
that there was, on September 30. 1596 due
from the co-partnership to Henry Miller
the sum of $125,027 75. that, in addU.on to
the sum. Henry Miller was the owner of

NEW PRECINCT BOUNDARIES.
Changes Necessitated by the Annex
ation of Claremont, Peralta and
Piedmont Districts.
OAKLAND. Aug. The Supervisors this
afternoon changed "certain boundaries of ~ the
election precincts on account of the annexa
tion territory of Claremont, Piedmont and Per

to Peralta precinct so that It now includes a
strip along Clement avenue and Temescal
Creek. Piedmont District No. 1. Piedmont
No. 2; and Claremont Precinct Is also changed
to meet the exigencies of the case.
These changes also necessitated a change in
the boundary line of the Fourth and Fifth Su
pervisorial districts, and this was accomplished
by placing a strip of about 150 bySOO, that was
left out of the city of Oakland, into the Fourth
Supervisorial District.

MEMENTOES OF
HER LIFE WORK
Sister Russell's Hopes
Not Fulfilled.
WANTED A LARGE HOME
MASSIVE FOUNDATIONS WERE
LAID AT mUITVALE.
Upon Them Will Yfet Be Raised a
Monument Which Will Bear
Witness to Her Energy
and Beneficence.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 8.
On Bray avenue is a remembrance of
the great work outlined by the late Sister
Russell of San Francisco but which she
was in htr lifetime unable to carry out.
Nearly four years a^o Sister Russell was
convinced that the work of the Old
Ladies' Home in San Francisco had far
outgrown the quarters in which it was lo
cated. Bbc <juiiuuived tne idea of erecting
a vast structure in the diocese which
would be able to accommodate for many
years all the aged women who were
worthy of assistance.
Sister Russell obtained the sum of about
$3U,000, and had plans made which called
for a very handsome and imposing brick
structure. In discussing the matter at the
time Sister Russell N stated that there
would be no difficulty in obtaining trie
money for the remainder of the building
should the foundations be laid. Contracts
were let for the foundation of this great
building, and a site was prucured near the
foothills at the north end of Bray avenue,
Fruitvale. The excavation work and the
concrete foundations were laid and cover j
a great amount of ground. Then the :
work ceased. The great financial panic |
which swept over the coun'ry booh after
the accession of Mr. Cleveland was felt
most keenly by charitable institutions and
Sister Russell was disappointed in not re
ceiving the help which under other cir
cumstances would have been extended to
the home.
The foundations are still awaiting the
superstructure. The cement work is of
such a nature, however, that the ravagi U
of a century could have no effect upon it.

Until the 15th Inst.
OAKLAND, Aug. The registration of
voters will close August 15 and not to-morrow,
as has been implied from the published notices
which distinctly state that it closes on the 9th.
County Clerk Jordan advises those who can
to register at the earliest possible moment,
however, in order to avoid the great rush that

It was not finite 11 o'clock when the

â¢when they beheld their new quarters,
' .-which is a grassy glade, surrounded by
â  hills. It is the l^st camp upon the res

Another Meeting "Will Be Necessary
to Select the Remaining Pro
gramme Names for the
Coming Convention.
The Alford-Gould-McNab Democrats
â¢who have without warrant assumed the
risht of appointing delegates to the
Democratic State convention at Sacra
. mento to Indorse the Populist nomination
of James <J. Magruire for Governor, m.-t
last night to continue the work of putting
up the slate. The meeting was called for
the purpose of "electiag" 53 delegates to
fill up the required batch of 153, the com
mittee of 100 having previously selected a
man apiece.
A call of the mil showed a quorum pres
ent, and Chairman J. Placehunter Dunn
announced that it would be first iv order
to till any vacancies in the "personal" ap
pointments.
Secretary Welsh announced that Ru
dolph Herold had sent in the name of T.
E. Tracey from the Thirty-first District.
The point was raised that Herold lived
in the Thirty-eighth District, and conse
quently was not entitled to a delegate in
the Thirty-first District.
]t was finally decided to allow Herold
until to-morrow noun to name a man from
his own district.
E. P. Feigel, William H. Metson and J.
T. Stanley were nexi added to the list of
"personal appointments.
An examination of the list showed that
several members of the committee of one
hundred had failed to avail themselves
of the privilege of making a personal
appointment.
The announcement was then made that
th^ delinquent members had declared
th;it they would not make the appoint
â  mr-nts giv.-n th.-m. Among those who
declined to appoint were E. A. Denicke
and T.ix Collector Block.
In the hope that these gentlemen
might afterward decide to change their
views relative to making appointments
â  they were given until Wednesday noon
to make known th.'ir choices, if they
have any. In ih<- event of their remain
ing si caii fast, in tin-ir refusal, the entire
committee, at a meeting to-morrow
â¢ niKlit. will proceed to fill the vacancies.
Âh C. Oormaa of the Thirty-first
District refused to longer work with the
.committee and his resignation was ac
cepted.
â¢ The manner of "electing" the flfty
three delegates was then taken up for
consideration. Some of the commlttee
n:--n believed thai they should be voted
. ciistri't at a time.
â  Francis J. Hfney said that the district
. plan was the only safeguard against a
"I do not Bay that there is a slate."
said he, "and I hope there is none. If
we are to vote for the fift\ - -three at one
time a slate could be easily put through."
The discussion over the district plan
was protracted and tiresome. The only
thing to enliven the debate was a dis
covery made by Braunhart, who said that
on the printed list of nominees handed
him he discovered that there were two
. names from the Twenty-ninth District
that had not been legally nominated. "If
any member of this committee nominated
either of the- men," said he, "let him
stand up. A joker has evidently been
run in. We don't want any Buckley or
Ralney methods here."
VI think that in all fairness" said Dr.
Clinton, "we Bhould refer to the minutes
of thf last meeting. The member who
nominated them may not be here to-
Secretary Welsh said that the list had
been printed by him. from lists handed In
at his desk at the meeting before. "Some
of the UstS," said he. "did not contain
the signature of the member presenting
them so the minutes would not give
â¢the Information desired by Dr. Clinton."
â Braunhart moved then that the names
â be Btricken from the list.
"I object to any *ui'h procedure," said
â  Joseph Leggett. "It would be unjust to
take any such action. In order to put
an end to this discussion. I now formally
place the names in nomination."
A recess of fifteen minutes was taken to
allow the members of the committee time
to prepare their ballots. The friends of
James H. Barry and W. P. Lawlor, who
dens made complaint yesterday to Gen
eral Miller against soldiers bathing in
the bay in front of the gardens without
any bathing suits on. The necessary or
ders to prevent this were immediately is
sued by General Miller.
Major Moseley, U. S. A., yesterday
afternoon convened the board of sun
geons, of which he is president, for the
purpose of passing upon certificates of
disability forwarded by the various regi
mental surgeons. When, after examina
tion, any of the certificates are ap
proved, the soldier will be at once given
his discharge fmm the service.
The First Tennessee, Twentieth Kansas
and Fifty-first lowa regiments, compos
ing the Second Brigade, will ho re
viewed by General King upon the golf
grounds at the Presidio this morning, and
there will also be a brigade drill by the
regiments.
There were no deaths at the division
hospital yesterday Major Morris Issued
n furloughs lo convalescent soldiers
to go to their homes for a month. There
wen- over 880 cases in the hospital yester
day. Of these there are a number of
cases of pneumonia, and some of the men
are critically ill.
DESTINED FOR HAWAII.
A Detachment of the First New
York Ordered to Embark
on the Mariposa.
After the usual Sunday lull in military
affairs the Presidio presented yesterday
a radically different scene. To start the
spirit of animation, the remaining com
panies of the First New York Regiment
were early in the morning thrown into a
state of excitement by the announcement
that orders had been received by Lieu
tenant Colonel Stacpole for another de
tachment of the regiment to sail for
Honolulu on Wednesday, on the Mari
posa. Speculation as to what companies
bad been selected was soon in order, and
guesses and wagers were quickly made.
Company E proved to be the lucky let
ter, with D a close second. At 11 o'clock
Colonel Stacpole published the following
orders:

containing the names of their choice for
delegates and urged the committeemen to

THE DEWEY CLUB
IS PROGRESSING
Headquarters to Be Procured
and a Branch Club to Organ-
ize in the Potrero.
The executive committee of the Dewey
Republican Central Club met at rtrom 28,
Columbia building, last night and heard
reports from the sub-committees, which
indicated progress in the matters of se
lecting a hall and purchasing uniforms,
though no definite action had been taken
In either. The committee on hall was di
rected to procure suitable club headquar
ters in a down-town location.
The following-named committee of five,
Captain C. A. Douglass, P. B. Gallagher,
P J Joyce. R. E. Murray. Dr. D. W. Mc-
Neil, was appointed by the chairman. H.
D. Mitchell, to prepare preamble and reso
lutions voicing the sentiments of the club
upon the subject of civil service now In
operation by the Government.
The committee will meet again on
Thursday night, and when the club head
quarters' has been procured the regular
club meetings will be resumed.
Branch No. 1 of this club will be organ
ized this week at the Potrero, the enroll
ing of men desirous of becoming members
to be begun this evening. The club in
tends extending its work throughout the
county, which is widely represented in the
executive committee membership.
OFFICERS FOR
THE PRIMARIES
Republican Central Committee
to Select Them Thurs
day Night.
The secretary of the Republican County
Central Committee sent out notices by
mail yesterday calling an executive ses
sion of the committee to be heldon Thurs
day night at 8 o'clock in the committee
rooms.
The prime purpose of the meeting Is the
selecting of judges, Inspectors and clerks
of thf> primaries. There will come up for
discussion also several matters of Import
ance to the committee and pertaining to
the primaries. A full attendance of the
members Is urged.
There Is a numerous visitation of Re
publicans at the club rooms continuously
until 10 or 11 o'clock at night and a great
deal of interest Is manifest in the matter
of the primaries and the general affairs
of the committee's work.
STILL IN THE RACE.
Thomas Flint Jr. Denies That
He Is Out of the Guber
natorial Contest.
The statement which has been made
that Thomas Flint Jr. has given up hia
gubernatorial aspirations Is emphatically
denied by that gentleman, who Is now in
the city.
"Far from being out of the race," said
Mr. Flint, "I am in It harder than ever.
I never for a moment have thought of
withdrawing from the contest, and con
sider the suggestion of such an Idea ab
surd, in the face of the fact that my
chances for the nomination were never
better.
"From assurances of friends and from
personal observation I cannot see how I
can help winning the contest. I feel con
fident that my nomination is assured, ao,
naturally, I am still In the fight, and will
be in it until I am defeated or receive the
nomination for Governor."
WOULD REVISE THE
NEW PRIMARY LAWS
SEVEBAL IMPORTANT AMEND
MENTS SUGGESTED.
Proposed Constitutional Amendment
No. 2 Declared Inoperative.
McNab Opposed to Re
form.
The cub-committee of the joint com
mittee recently appointed by the Union
League, the Iroquols Club, the Harney
Democrats and the committee of 100
Democrats met last evening In the office
of M. M. Estee to discuss the methods of
securing the needed amendments to the
present law regulating primaries.
The sub-committee was appointed a
week ago at the conference held at tne
Union League, and la composed of the
following well-known lawyers: M. M.
Estee and A. G. Booth, representing the
Tnion League; T. Carl Snelllng, repre
senting the Iroquois and the Central
Democratic Clubs; A. Ruef, representing
the Citizens' Republican committee; ex-
Assemblyman Ed J. Reynolds, represent
ing the Harney faction of the Democrats,
and E. A. Bridgford, . representing the
committee of 100, generally known as the
Gould-Alford-McNab combine. All the
committeemen: were present last evening
except Mr. Bridgford. M. M. Estee was
elected chairman and E. J. Reynolds was
elected secretary.
The committee came at once to the con
clusion that the proposed constitutional
amendment 2 Is not self-operative,
even If adopted, and would be but little
aid. to future legislation. . A second and
Important- objection Is that It would take
four years to put it in operation. A third
objection is that after all the legislation
authorized by the amendment had been
enacted, such legislation would In no way
be of a general characterâ applying to the
State at largeâ but would only have local
application.
Numerous and ample grounds sustain
ing the Supreme Court's decision on the
Stratton law were conceded by all the
members of the committee, and that act
was also found to be of no aid in re
forming the primaries as they are now
conducted.' But the committee was unan
imous in the opinion that a constitutional
and satisfactory act could be drafted and
passed, the main features of which are:
A separate election day for each po
litical party for the choice of delegates
to their various conventions. V" i.
The voting at the primaries to be by
ballot, and in all essentials conduced un
der the rule which applies to State,
county and local elections. â¢
The committee considered this plan
more economical than to have all the pri
maries held the same day, as has been
suggested by several theorists.
Another change agreed . upon by the
committee is that there should be fewer
election precincts than at present.
The number of delegates to which each
party will be entitled will be in propor
tion to the numerical voting strength
at the preceding election. full and
The sub-committee will mane a i
complete report on the constitutional
phases, the condition of, and recommend
amendments to the existing pr mary laws
at the next meeting of the joint confer
ence, which will be held Friday night at
the T'nlon League Club. of the confer-
Since the appointment of the confer
ence the Gould-Alford-McNab combine
has withdrawn from the movement to
purify the primaries, and the self-consti
tuted bosses are now opposed to amend
ing the law. On the other hand, the Ilar
neyites are in favor of electing delegates
at primaries and have entered into the
effort to bring about the necessary reform
with apparent sincerity. One of the com
mittee at the meeting last night remarked
the absence of the representatives of i
"Whispering Gavin" and his fellow-con
spirators, and said: ..
"It does not run in the blood of the
bosses of the committee of 100 to give the
Democratic voters a fair chance, and for
that reason they want a wide-open
primary law or no primaries at all â
they like the latter plan."
The Harney delegates to the conference j
are: E. J. Reynolds, W. I. Brobeck and
Alex Vogelsang.
DINED ON THE WATER.
Engineer Crew of the Cutter Bush

the berth deck, and after discussing a

some excellent instrumental music.
STEWART THE ONLY ONE.
The Senator Talks a Bit on Nevada
Politics.
Senator William M. Stewart of Nevada
arrived In this city late Sunday night
and Is resting from the war session of
Congress. He said last night: "I cer
tainly am In the fight for the Senator
ship from my State, but really there is
no fight. Every once in a while a candi
date crops up, but before the time comes
he drops out. No, I am the only man
who has a chance at all for the Senate
In the cumlng election of the Legisla
ture."
In regard to the acquisition of terri
tory by this Government the Senator
said: "Get nil we can and hold alPwo
get. If we want to give it up after that
why we can do it, but first let us possess
It."

MURDERS IN
JEALOUS RAGE

Frank Cheeseman a
Homicidal Lover.
HENRY BROOKE HIS VICTIM
PLANNED TO SLAY A WHOLE
FAMILY.
Killed One and Put a Bullet In the
Thigh of Miss Payne, Then
Shot at Her
Mother.
OAKLAND, Aug. B.â Frank Cheeseman,
a painter, who has been several times In
an asylum and whose residence is in
' Berkeley, murdered Henry Brooke this
"evening, and jumping over the dying body
' " of the old man he rushed into the kichen
â and shot his victim's stepdaughter
â¢ through the thigh. He then discharged
a shot at her mother, which passed harm
lessly through her dress.
'. ' The cause of the trouble was the break-
COMMITS MURDER IN A JEALOUS RAGE.
Ing off of an engagement between the
: murderer and Etta Payne, the pretty
stepdaughter of the murdered man.
Shortly before 9 o'clock to-night Frank
Cheeseman called at the home of Brooke,
at 16 Seventh street. The call was an
swered by Henry Brooke, and as soon aa
the door was opened Cheeseman fired right
into his heart. Not a word was said by
' either of the two men so far as known.
The neighborhood is a dark one, and
Brooke could not see that (he visitor had
a gun, so Cheeseman had everything In
his favor to aid him in carrying out his
murderous intentions.
Mrs. Brooke and her stepdaughter, Etta
were in the rear room of the cottage and
â  heard the shot. It was followed by the
â  noise made by the murderer running
through the hall, and they at once sought
â  shelter. Etta was first seen by the mur
â  derer and he approached with his gun
pointed at her head and she hit it and
.knocked it down so that when he fired
the bullet wont into her thigh. The fiend
then saw Mrs. Brooke, who was partly
hidden by a closet door, and he fired at
her at random, the ball making a hole
â  In her skirt.
:The murderer then ran out of the back
.of the house, jumped over the fence and
was last seen In the neighbor's yard,
â¢whence he made his escape. Two
hours later he was in the City Prison.

Back of the tragedy is a romance. Some |
months ago the Brookes lived at Elm- j
hurst. Cheeseman was then engaged to ,
do pome carpentering. lie worked for a
contractor named Batten, and when they !
had their meals it was necessary for ;
them to go for fresh water to the home i
of the Brookes. In this manner Cheese- !
man became acquainted with Etta Payne, ;
who is the daughter of Mrs. Brooke by a
former husband. The acquaintance was
kept up for a few months and Cheeseman
I frequently brought the young lady into ;
; Oakland and took her to the theater. The ;
acquaintance deepened and it was under- j
stood that an engagement existed between
them. j
Finally, news came to the mother and
stepfather that Cheeseman was not the
kind of man they desired for their daugh- i
ter. They heard he had been in an asy
lum on more than one occasion, and they j
advised their daughter to cease accepting
her lover's attentions.
Recently the Brookes moved to the cot- j
tage on Seventh street, and Etta, at the j
suggestion of her mother, wrote to
Cheeseman and told him that she wanted .
no more to do with him.
"Etta first met Frank Cheeseman," said
Mrs. Brooke to-night at the Receiving
Hospital, "when we were living at Elm- '
hurst. At that time Frank was working
i as a carpenter upon a building on a lot ;
adjoining ours. As there was no water in
I the vicinity of the building upon which
1 he was working he used to visit our well.
It was while on a trip to the well that
he first met Etta. His conduct toward
her at that time was. from all appear
ances, gentlemanly, and they seemed to ,
take quite a liking to each other. Upon
Beveral occasions they visited the theater .
FRANK CHEESEMAN.
in Oakland together. We soon moved to
Oakland, as business Interests called my
husband there, and it was soon after
moving to Oakland that we learned of the
character of Mr. Cheeseman. We heard
that upon several occasions he had been
! arrested, and was as a whole not a per
] son for my daughter to associate with.
'â â  Etta, upon learning of his dissolute char
i acter, wrote him a very polite note, say
i ing that she did not care for his company
I any longer. A few days after receiving
the note he met Etta and told ncr that
if he ever saw her in the future In the
; company of any other fellow he would
kill her. This statement he made only
last Saturday night, at which time I ad
vised Etta to have him arrested to pro
tect herself. Thinking he was not in
earnest about his threats to kill, we both
finally let the mater drop."
Miss Etta Payne, the indirect cause of
the tragedy, is only slightly wounded.
She is a very attractive girl, about 20
years of age, with a wealth of black hair
and nicely turned features.
"I met Frank last May," she paid, "and
thought he was a very nice fellow at
first. We went out a few times, and in
return to his repeated desire I consented
that our friendship should take the na
ture of an engagement. This continued
some time, and then we commenced to
hear little stories that did not please us.
Then we learned that he had been in an
asylum and that he had made over half
a dozen attempts to commit suicide, and
I decided that he was not the kind of
man I should like for a husband. Last
Saturday I wrote to him and told him I
was anxious that our acquaintance
Bhould cease. I asked him not to call on
me any more. He did call at the house
and told me that if ever he saw me on
the street with another man he would kill
me. I told him he would do nothing so
silly, but he persisted, and I was making
fun of his threat wnen he went away."
"To-night we were sitting at dinner
when the doorbell rang. Father and I
both went, but he was a little ahead of
me. As soon as the door was opened, and
before I had time to see who it was there
was a shot and my father fell. I then
saw Cheeseman enter. I thought of hla
threat and at once ran back. Cheeseman
followed with the gun in his hand, xie
forced me into a corner of the kitchen
and pointed the revolver at my head. I
struggled with him and knocked it down
and the shot entered my thigh. He then
turned toward my mother and fired at
her, as he ran out of the back door. He
spoke but a few words all the time and
acted more like a drunken man than a
mad man. He seemed to be very deter
mined, and when I struggled with him he
did not show any such strength as might
be expected from a maniac. He came to
the house, I firmly believe, intending to
kill us all. After I was shot and Cheese
man had run off, I went with my mother
to the hall and we found my father still
breathing, but he died In a few minutes."
About two hours after the murder
Cheeseman was found in the bar at the
Newlands House. Seventh and Washing
ton streets, by Sergeant Greene in the
act of taking a drink. The officer ap
proached him and placed him under ar
rest. Cheeseman made but little re-
Fistance, though he talked like a drunken
man. The patrol wagon was waiting out
side and the prisoner was hurried to the
City Prison. Being handcuffed, the
prisoner begged to be relieved of these,
threatening if this was refused he would
commit suicide.
"I am not as crazy as you guys think."
leeringly remarked Cheeseman, "and you
just wait and see if I am."
On being searched the 44-caliber re
volver was found on him. Every pocket
contained cigarettes and tobacco, and on
the inside coat pocket the officers found
a bunch of letters and a faked marriage
certificate. One of the letters had evident
ly been written by Etta Payne. It was in
a girl's handwriting, dated "Oakland,
Cal., 163 Seventh street, July 25, 1898," and
ran as follows:
THE SAN FRAKCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 9, 1898.
Pear Prank: Tour letter was Just received
this eve, so I will endeavor to ans It at once.
I was pained very .much to learn what you
had concluded to do, but I cannot blame you
much whatever you do. Frank, I am very
sorry I disappointed you so badly yesterday,
but I guess you will not believe this.
AVords fail me to express how badly I feel
after promising you so much, but you say
yourself that I am easily led; perhaps I am by
those I love. Frank, I have told you a great
deal about myself because I trusted you, and
new if it will help you to betray that trust go
ahead, but it will not do you any good. A3
for Mr. G., I haven't seen him since that even
ing you met us. and do not know or care when
I see him again.
Frank, I want to be honest with you, for you
have been good to me and helped me lots of
times and your kindness will never be forgot
ten. What I wish to tell you, dear, is this.
I cannot ever marry you, as I never intend
to marry any man. I will be your friend, al
ways help you if you come to me. When you
are downhearted or reel badly I will do
all I ran for you. You do not trust me and
think 1 am always deceiving you, but you are
mistaken, or was, dear.
Let the past be forgotten; you will run across
some girl some day that will make you happy.
I am sure I never could. I cannot forget you,
but If you wish to come to me sometimes and
be friends after you have thought of all this
all right, and we can be happy that way,
Frank.
â ell, I must close, hoping you will foridve
all the heartaches ami pain I have caused
I forgive you everything:; I hold nothing
acalnst you. Please answer if you wish. Well,
good by. ETTA.
Another letter among the bunch was
tfrom Clara B. Payne, daU'd "Sams
ey, July 25, '98," asking how he and
. are getting along, and concludes, "I
your loving sister-in-law, Clara B.
ne. I send love and kisses."
another pocket was found a mar
e certiilcate of Frank H. Cheeseman
and Eva .Lambert, recorded September
30, 1891. Judge Low Is supposed to ha% r e
officiated, and the marriage took place In
San Francisco. Cheeseman's age is given
as 24 and the girl's as 19 years. In this
certificate the consent of the girl's mother
is expressed. The witnesses were-Eliza
Lambert of San Francisco and R. G.
Kier of Lorin. The name Eva Lam
had been obliterated and the name
tta Payne Inserted in its stead, but
Cheeseman had forgotten to tamper with
the sentence "the mother of Eva Lam
bert gives her consent." The date had
also been changed In a bungling manner
to May Â«9, 1898.
Cheeseman was placed in cell No. 1 and
two guards were placed over mm. "When
a Call reporter approached him and asked
"Cheeseman, what did you kill the old
man for?" the prisoner said:
"Is he dead? Ho is, eh? Well, lam
of it! Is the girl dead. She
ain't! Well, lam - â sorry she
ain't. The old man had a grudge against
me, and they think I'm crazy. "Well,
you wait and see. I'll show them if I'm
"I am glad I killed him and I am only
sorry she is not dead," and then he ut
tered vile oaths betraying hatred and the
lowest contempt for his victims.
"Give me a cigarette and I'll tell you
all about it," continued the wretch. "You j
fellows had me written up several times j
before; said I Jumped from a building; j
that's a lie. What did the Brookes ever
do to me? Why nothing. Oh, that's all
right. You just wait and they'll see how j
crazy I am. They'll get tooled. Did I
mean to kill the old man? Why, of course, i
and I am glad of it."
While thus rambling In his talk tbe j
prisoner moved about much after the !
fashion of a drunken tough. Finally he :
said: "Oh, I'll hang for this, and I ex- i
pect to hang, but I am glad I've killed j
him.
"I sent a letter and my picture to the
Chief of Police telling him tnat I had
killed them. I sent the letter before I
did it."
There seemed to be little doubt but that
Cheeseman was drunk.
Neighbors of the Brooke family say that
Cheeseman has been hanging about the
house for the past month, and that he has
been on a spree the past four days. He
had just come from the Time Card saloon.
Seventh and Webster streets, and went
almost directly to the house of Etta
Payne.
Brooke formerly resided at Elmhurst
and while there was disgusted with the
attentions shown by Cheoseman to his
Ftepdaughter, and on one occasion about
six months ago he had Choeseman ar
rested for disturbing his peace. Brooke
had ordered him away time and again
and told him not to call at his home.
About a year ago Etta Payne and an
other girl disappeared for several days,
claiming on their return that they had
feme to the country looking for work,
he girls worked at Hickman's cannery.
Aside from this the girl has never
shown a wayward disposition.
After Etta Payne had been wounded she
ran from the house and was about to fall
on the sidewalk when Thomas Dolan, C.
Isaacs and Will Stoltz caught her and
carried the wounded girl across the street
to Thomas Dolan's house, whence sh<-> was
removed to the Receiving Hospital. While
being carried over she murmured, between
her groans of pain: "Oh, go and get
Frank Morgan, quick, quick, I am shot."
Morgan is a young man working at the
Piedmont Bakery, and he has, of late
been keeping company with the girl. It
is believed ny some that Cheeseman's
jealousy of Morgan was the cause of to
night's tragedy.
Cheeseman was married to Eva Lam
bert In September, 1891, at Berkeley. Prior
to their marriage. Cheeseman had fre
quently threatened to kill Eva if she did
not marry him. His threats resulted in
their marriage, but tht-y did not
live happily together, and Cheeseman
frequently threatened to kill her and has
himself tried to end his unsavory career
some eight times.
It is very evident that the murder was
premeditated from the fact that about
three-quarters of an hour before the
shooting occurred Anthony Salvador, a
member of the Eighth Regiment, met
Frank Cheeseman In a saloon at Seventh
and Webster streets, upon which occa
sion Cheeseman made threats to kill the
whole Brooke family.
"I was standing in the saloon engaged
In conversation with a friend," said Sal
vador, "when Cheeseman entered and
slapped me on the back, saying, 'I sup
pose you know the Brookes.' Having
known them for years I said yes, they
were friends of .mine, and also told him
that I was about to call upon them thi
evening. When Cheeseman learned of m
intentions to call he seemed excited an
told me that it was useless to call as the
were not at home, having all gone v
town to Broadway for a walk. He the
became profane, cursing the girl, he
father and her mother, and said tha
some day he would kill the whole crow<
"Soon after he left the saloon, but I re
mained with friends. It was not lon
after he left that I heard a pistol sho
followed by others. In an instant 1
flashed through my mind that Cheeseman
had carried out this threat. '
The victim of Cheeseman's wild desir
for revenge was a native of Englam
aged about 45 years. He was of sllgh
frame and rather of a nervous disposl
tion. He was a painter and paper-hanger
by occupation, and had resided at 163
Seventh street about two months, but in
that time he and his family made a fa
vorable Impression on the neighborhood.
Dropped Dead in the Hospital..
While the doctors were extracting the
bullet from Miss Etta Payne's â  thigh, an
old man named Charles Gaunt was

DEATH CLAIMS
ADOLPH SUTRO,
PHILANTHROPIST
There Was but a Gradual Tran
sition From Sleep to the
Great Beyond.
At 2:30 o'clock yesterday morning the
life of Adolph Sutro, millionaire, builder
of the Sutro tunnel and ex-Mayor of
San Francisco, ended. Standing by his
bedside when the last spark flickered out
were his children and the nurses and
physician who have cared for him during
the many weeks he has been helpless and
oblivious t*rhis surroundings. From sleep
to death was only a slight transition,
there was no resistance to the call of the
errim reaper, no regrets for work left un
done. The dying man had been uncon
scious for many days and his children
knew the end was approaching.
Adolph Sutro's death was immeasurably
more peaceful than his life. For over
forty years his life was a constant tur
moil and struggleâ lirst against poverty
and latterly against his commercial and
political enemies. Ills active life ended
with his term as Mayor of San Francisco,
and it may be said that he was practic
ally a dead man when his tenure of of
fice expired. Worn out by the strife and
annoyances of public life, together w r ith
the burden of husbanding his immense
properties, his mind weakened long before
his marvelous physical .powers decayed.
His children saw the mental collapse ap
proaching a year ago, but he was in
dulged and permitted to manage his af
fairs until his mind became a hopeless
blank. Then, by order of the court, his
daughter, Dr. Emma Merritt, was ap
pointed his guardian.
The unfortunate episode of his removal
from his beautiful home on the cliff over-
PASSING OF A PUBLIC BENEFACTOR,
EX-MAYOR ADOLPH SUTRO Died Earlu Yesterday
Morning at His Daughter's Home on Van Ness
Avenue,
I looking the entrance to the Golden Gate,
which he loved so dearly, is still fresh
in the minds of the public. Dr. Mertltt,
exercising her prerogative as guardian,
decided to remove her father, who was
helpless, to her home on Van Ness avenue,
that she might give him more constant
care and not be put to the Inconvenience
of traveling to the Cliff House. In this
' she was opposed by her brothers and sis
ter, particularly Miss Clara Sutro, who
thought that the father's wish that ho
might die at his home by the sea ought
to be respected. Dr. Merritt had made
up her mind, however, and one evening
she went with an ambulance to the house
on the cliff to remove her father. Clara
Sutro protested in vain, and falling to
move her sister she rushed out of the
house seized the ambulance driver's whip
and lashed the horses causing them to
run away. But the team was caught just
outside the Sutro grounds and taken
back. Dr. Merritt's plaji was carried out
and Adolph Sutro breathed his last in her
For' over two score years Adolph Sutro
has been identified with and he is in fact
a part of the history of Snn Francisco.
His deeds of beneficence are only equaled
by those of James Lick. His fame,
however, like many other pioneers who
have gone before, is builded on his
achievements In the mining industry. Rut
there is a difference in the life stories
of Sutro and his mining contemporaries.
What they acquired by luck or schemes
he accomplished by Indefatigable Indus
try and tenacity of purpose. Opposition
did not daunt him. The great Sutro tun
nelâthe most stupendous engineering pro
ject ever successfully completed In the
worldâ demonstrates the man's character
and energy. For twenty years he fought
a bitter, unrelenting flght against terrific
odds but he won, and with his success
came wealth and friends. But he never
forgot the men who opposed him, and his
hatred toward them never lessened.
His interest in the progress and wel
fare of San Francisco are too w r ell known
to require mention. The maintenance of
Sutro Heights as a public park has
been the delight and pleasure of count
less thousands, and the erection of the
Sutro Baths-the finest in the worldâ are
two noteworthy examples of his public
spirit Then the Sutro library of over
half a million volumes of valuable works
which he intended to give to the city is
another monument to his generosity.
The friendless German boy who began
life as a peddler. on the streets of this
city has spent rtlillions for his fellow
men.
Adolph Heinrich Joseph Sutro was born
April 29. IR3O, at Aix-la-Chapelle. Rhen
ish Prussia, and was the eldest of eleven
childrenâ seven boys and four girls. The
days of his boyhood were divided be
tween his father's cloth factory and the
polytechnic school. Hit mind was versa
tile and retentive, and he was practical
far beyond his years. At the age of id
his school days were over and he went
to work in the mill. His father dying
a year later, the management of the
family estate, including the mills, fell
upon the shoulders of the stripling. But
he was equal to the emergency, though
only a boy. He conducted the cloth mill
successfully, and established another at
Memel, and but for the upheaval of Euro
pean business, which followed the break
ing out of the Prussian rebellion in 1848,
I the great financier might never have set
foot in America.
When the clash ,of arms resounded
| throughout his country, manufacturing
I ceased, th<e millhands went to the war
! and the Sutro family was ruined. In ISSO
I the mother and eleven children came to
! America and settled in Baltimore. Young
! Adolph contracted the gold craze and
! started for California in a sailing vessel,
arriving here November 21, 1851. Almost
; penniless and without acquaintances or
! friends the young man began a desperate
battle against long odds, which continued
for a decade before he conquered fate and
secured a firm foothold on the ladder to
success. Sutro began life in San Fran
! Cisco as a peddler of cigars and trinkets
i along the water front, But he was en
i dowed with indomitable fortitude and
j tireless energy, and these with his prac
tical mind insured him against failure
and enabled him to amass a large fortune.
About this time stories of the wonder
i ful mineral wealth of Nevada filled the
| air. Sutro had more than an ordinary or
superficial knowledge of mtneralop-v, and
he sold out his merchandise business,
mounted a mule, went to Washoe and lo
cated at Virginia City. He became a
i mining broker and dealt in merchandise
! and soon was one of the substantial men
i of the camp.
The story of his tunnel is the typical
story of his life.
In 1803 the great bonanzas in the Corn
stock lode were being exploited and the
rage for deeper workings was maddening.
* The only man who had a practical plan
j for deep" mining was Sutro. He proposed
I to drive a tunnel from a point In the flank
of Mount Davidson, 20.455 feet from the
Savage shaft, s?o as to strike that shaft
at a point 1645 feet below the surface of
the earth. The plan wa-s loudly applauded
by RalKton, Sharon, Mills end the Bank
of California. A tunnel company was
formed in 1564. an act of incorporation ob
talned from the Legislature of Nevada in
18f>5, and a bargain closed with the min
ing companies for the payment of a roy
alty to the tunnel company of $2 a ton on
all the ore extracted after the opening of
the tunnel.
How he solved the problem In the face
of apparently insuperable obstacles is a
familiar tale. The expense of the under
taking had reached nearly $5,000,000 Once
more Sutro was the man of the hour.
After the completion of the great tun
nel Sutro's inherent shrewdness and far
sightedness were again manifested He
sold out his stock and disposed of nearly
all his Nevada property and returned to
ban Francisco. He invested the proceeds
of his "clean-up"â estimated at $5,000,000â
In real estate, buying thousands of acres
of sand dunes on the northern end of the
peninsula. With the growth of the city
his wealth Increased and he improved his
lands without hesitating at expense The
changes he has wrought in the vicinity
of the Cliff House are his best and most
enduring- monuments, and as long as the
tides brat against the rocks of the Golden
Gate the seas will chant his requiem.
The Cliff House, the Sutro Baths and
the magnificent Sutro library are ever
lasting testimonials to his public spirit
and generosity. His last gift to the pub
lic was a site for the Affiliated Colleges
of the University of California, consisting
of twenty-six acres at the entrance to
Golden Gate Park.
The two greatest misfortunes in the life
of the dead millionaire were his estrange
ment from his wife and his election to the
Mayoralty of this city. He married in
1556, when he 1 was struggling against pov
erty, and during all those bitter, disap
pointing days and nights his faithful wife
was his only friend. She encouraged
when others reproached and derided him.
When she died, in 1893, he said In a public
address:
"But for her I should have lost heart
altogether. My wife never repined, never
reproached me for the poverty with which
we struggled, and she never wavered in
her devotion."
Shortly before her death Mrs. Sutro and
her husband were reconciled.
The deceased leaves six children to
share his millions. They are: Dr. Emma
Merritt, Mrs. Morbid, Mrs. Neusbaum,
Clara, Edgar and Charles Sutro.
A short time ago Mrs. Clara Kluge of
this city declared that she was the wife
of the ex-Mayor, but the status of her
claim Is not known. Whether or not
there will be a contest over the estate
will not be known until the provisions of
the will, if the deceased made one, are
known to the interested heirs.
Yesterday morning the body of the de
ceased was taken to his beloved home on
the heights which bear his name. The
family wish It understood that the funeral
will be private.

TELEPHONE WAR
TAX SHIRKED
BY A TRICK
Tenderfoot Patrons Compelled
by Soapy Smith Tactics to
Pay for All.
Perhaps the shade of the lamented
"Soapy" Smith has not assumed the di
rection of the Telephone Company. Yet
were "Soapy" In the flesh and at the
head of the concern he probably would
lend to its present tactics his warmest
approval. The Telephone Company is
running a quiet confidence layout, the
tenderfoot being the chosen victim. Of
course the war tax is at the bottom
of it, for nothing but a war tax in
spires a corporation to such thrifty
trickery.
To go back a few days, the Telephone
Company announced with great eclat
that it would pay its share of the bur
den imposed. It did this with a strange
air of saying: "Look at us. Aren't we
virtuous and patriotic?" People looked,
but espied neither virtue nor patriot
ism, because the fact leaked out just
in time to spoil the play that the tele
phone crowd had not made the conces
sion until the fact had become ap
parent that there was no escape. They
had to come down and thought it
wise to toot a horn as they came. But
there has been some thinking done and
a new way to beat the intent of the law
by beating the patron has been devised.
This is about the style of it:
When a person who is a regular cus
tomer sends a message to an out-of
town point nothing is said about the
necessary revenue stamp, nor is the
regular rate raised. But let a stranger,
a transient, come in, and he is charged
5 or 10 cents more than the regular
rate. He doesn't know the difference,
unconsciously makes good the tax on
his own message and that upon the
message of the man who was too foxy
to be taken in, besides leaving a neat
balance for the corporation. It is a
great scheme and is understood to have
the hearty indorsement of President
Sabin and a majority of the directors.
At least they have not been observed in
any endeavor to put a stop to it.
But while the telephone concern has
been making hay the Wells-Fargo out
fit has been equally shrewd. From the
first President Valentine has considered
the war tax a punishment great than
he could bear. What! Contribute to
ward sharing the burden of war. Oh,
dear, no. The thought was actuaJly re
pellant. So he gave out the informa
tion that the stamp which the Govern
ment intended Wells-Fargo to pay for
must be paid for by the patron, where
at the patron, having troubles of his
own, made ado which caused Valentine
pain and seemed to him unreasonable.
Now Wells-Fargo has also gone into
the bunko business on a scale as dig
nified and deliberate as the telephone
scheme. Here it is:
A man goes into the express office
with a package which he desires sent
away. The clerk receives it, but " re
marks affably: 'The revenue stamp
will cost you a cent."
"Not on your life," responds the man,
not having been born yesterday. "The
company must put the otamp on."
Then the clerk sizes him up, and if I
he is a well-known citizen whose good j
will is worth cultivating, responds with
the air of a martyr: "Well, rather
than have any trouble with you, I'll
put on the stamp myself, but the cost
comes out of my own pocket."
"Rats!" (or something equivalent) re
torts the man, and goes his way, know- I
ing the package will be duly forward
ed, and that the clerk, who may be a
very decent fellow, won't be out a cent.
If the shipment comes from a busi
ness house the programme is the same,
except that the clerk says he will sup
ply the stamps, and send around a bill
for them. The interesting part of the
transaction will be when there is an at
tempt to collect such bill, provided the
bluff go so far.
Now the question is as to which of
these wealthy corporations is running
the more effective skin game.
WENT TO THE BOTTOM
WITH THEIR STEAMER
GOLD HUNTERS DROWNED IH
AN ALASKA STORM.
Twelve Members of the Columbia
Exploring Company Lost in
the Kuskokvin Biver.
The members of the Columbia Explor
ing Company, twelve in number, and the
Rev. E. Weber, wife and child, are sup
posed to hayÂ« been drowned In the Kus
kokvin River. The following is an extract
from a letter to the Alaska Commercial
Company, dated Unalaska, July 2N:
"We wish to call your special attention
to the following: Rev. E. Weber, one of
the Moravian missionaries bound for
Kuskokvin, was asked by some prospect-
Ing parties on board the steamer Lakrae,
alsitound for the Kuskokvin River, to
go along with them, acting as pilot and
interpreter with the Indians, which he
agreed to do, taking his wife and child
along. The Lakme went into Goodhews
Bay, off the mouth of Kuskokvin, on
June 22. It seems that the party he was
with had a fifty-foot steamer and two
barges. On June 27, bo the natives say,
the steamer, with the two barges in tow,
left Goodnews Bay to proceed up the
riv^r. Soon after their departure the
wind increased in violence and was blow
ing a gale for two days from the south
east, making a nasty sea for the mouth
of the river. Nothing has been seen of
the party since, neither along the coast
nor the river, although communications
were kept up all around. A few days
later the natives reported a stranded
barge ashore on one of the bars on the
north side of Kuskokvin River, loaded
with liour, canned goods and also cloth
ing, all of which was appropriated by the
natives. Later on a craft of lumber was
seen drifting, also having some other ar
ticles on the top. It is now safe to sup
pose that the whole party, consisting of
twelve prospectors, Weber, wife and
child and two native pilots, were lost.
The party called themselves the Columbia
Exploring Company."
