a hjorrible Death.
COHOES, N. V., Sept. s.â An ap
palling disaster occurred in this city
to-night. Shortly before 8 o'clock a
trolley car of the Troy City Railway
Company was struck by the night
special of the Delaware and Hudson
at a crossing at the west end of the
Hudson River bridge, whicn connects
the city with Lansingburg, and its
load of human freight was hurled
into the air. Eighteen of the thirty
five passengers are dead and at least
ten of the remainder will die.
The cars entering the city from Lan-
Blngburg were crowded with passengers
returning from a labor day picnic at
Rensselaer's Park, a pleasure resort
near Troy. It was car No. 119 of the
Troy City Railway that met with dis
aster. It came over the bridge about
7:30 o'clock laden with a merry party
of people, fresh from the enjoyment cf
the day.
The crossing where the accident oc
curred is at a grade. Four tracki of
the Delaware and Hudson Railroad,
which runs north and south at this
point, cross the two tracks of the trol
ley road. It was the hour when the
night boat special, a train which runs
south and connects with the New York
boat at Albany, was due to pass that
point.
Tracks of the street lines run at a
grade from the brL'-"e to the point
where the disaster took place. In con
sequence of this fact and a frequent
passing of trains, it h**s been the rule
for each motor car conductor to stop
his car and go 'irv.ard to observe the
rr, Hr~nd tracks and signal his car to
proceed, if no trains are in sleut. It
cannot be ascertained whether that
rule was complied with on this occa
sion, for all events prior to the crash
are forgotten by those who were in
volved.
TV" motor car was struck directly in
the center by the engine of the train
which was going at a high rate of
speed. The accident came without the
slightest warning. The car was up< :i
the tracks before the train loomed in
sight, and no power on earth could
have saved it. ' motorman evidently
saw the train approaching as he reach
ed the track, and opened his control
ler, but in vain.
"With a crash that was heard for
blocks the engine struck into the light
er vehicle. The effect was horrible.
The motor car parted in two, both sec
tions being hurled into the air In
splinters. The mass of humanity, for
the car was crowded to overflowing,
was torn and mangled. Those in the
front of th<=> car met with the worst
fate. The force of the collision was
there experienced to the greatest de
gree, and every human being in that
section was killed. The sceDe was hor
rible. Bodies had been hurled into the
air and their headless and limbless
AGUINALDO YET
PLANS RESISTANCE
Refuses to Disarm Insurgents Un
til the United States Guaran
tees Permanent Protection.
Special Cable to The Call and the Herr York Herald. Copyrighted, 1808
by James Gordon Bennett.
MANILA, Sept. 5. â General A^uinaldo is recruiting
troops, and his men are busily emp -yed in building
trenches. In explanation of this war! : .ke attitude, the in
surgent leader says he is preparing for resistance in case the
island should be returned to Spanish rule. The general
says he is willing to disarm the insurgent army if the Unit
ed States guarantees permanent protection.
The rebels will hold a conference this week, delegates
from each evince having been appointed.
At G^- eral Aguinaldo's new headquarters at Malolos
the repor s confirmed that the rebel leader has consolidated
divers i irrectionary parties in the northeast provinces,
thus giving him an additional force of 5000 men and control
over the entire northern end of Luzon. The insurgents con
tinue building intrenchments on the north side of the city.
They also hold the water works in their possession, which
fact carries with it a serious menace to the Americans, in
view of the approaching dry season.
The insurgents have captured every Spanish position on
the bay, with one exception, and are strengthening them
selves everywhere in the interior. Aguinaldo desires to make
a strong case before the meeting of the Peace Commission
in Paris, and will hold his party together if possible. The
task is fraught with difficulty, while each small leader has
set himself up as a rival power.
The San Francisco Call
trunks were found, in some cases, fifty
feet from the crossing.
The pilot of the engine was smashed,
and amid its wreckage were the maim
ed corpses of two women. The pas
sengers of the train suffered no injury
except a shock. The majority of the
passengers on the trolley were young
people. They included many women.
Within ten minutes after the colli
sion fully a half of the population of
the city was surging about the vicinity
in an endeavor to ascertain if relatives
were among the unfortunates.
The injured were taken to the City
Hospital and to the Continental Knit
ting Mill, the former not having sultt
cient ambulance service to care for
them all.
The corpses were placed in boxes
and taken to a neighboring mill shed.
Many of them were unrecognizable.
The crash was frightful in its results.

dresses bathed ! n their own and the

I that he did no* see the car un
was upon it. He tried to pre
his train from striking the car,
s efforts were fruitless. His train
was going at a very high rate of speed
at the time. He was some minutes late
and was trying to make up lost time.
Ronsequence of the caution taken by
trolley road to ascertain if the
ks were clear at this crossing, the
neers of trains have always felt
in running by at a high rate of
speed.
The engineer says that the first he
knew that the car was coming' was
when it hove in sight at the corner of
the street at which the crossing is situ
ated. He was but a short distance
from the car at the time. It was ut
terly impossible for him to bring his
train to a standstill. He thinks that
the motorman, when he saw the train
was upon him. tried to get beyond the
danger line. The grade of this cross
ing and the speed at which his car was
going also made it impossible for him
to- stop before he reached the tracks.
It was the front end of his car that
was caught and crushed, and he was
killed outright.

WILHELMINA, WHO WILL BE CROWNED QUEEN OF THE NETHERLANDS TO-DAY.
LOVING SUBJECTS
GREET WILHELMINA
THE HAGUE. Sept. s.â Queen "Wilhelmina and the Queen's mother started from this city to-day for Am
sterdam, where the enthronement will take place. Her Majesty was attired In a white satin gown, over
which she wore a white cashmere shawl.
AMSTERDAM, Sept. s.â Beginning at early dawn to-day vast crowds of people gathered in the streets,
which were lavishly decorated in anticipation of the entry of Queen Wilhelmina. The weather was bright
and trains from the provinces brought thousands of visitors to the city. The stands which had been erected
along the route of the procession were packed early, as was also the Damplatz. The route to the royal pal
ace was lined by thirty-five workingmen's unions and eleven military associations.
The Damplatz, the high bridge over the Amstel, the principal canals and the streets through which the
Queen was to pass were adorned with festoons and triumphal arches. All the houses surrounding the Dam
platz were literally enshrouded with gay draperies and natural flowers.
Queen Wilhelmina arrived at the railway depot in Amsterdam at 2 o'clock and was enthusiastically re
ceived. The Burgomaster delivered an address of welcome, to which her Majesty replied: "For a long time
past I have been looking forward to this moment, which is the most solemn of my life."
The Queen briefly addressed the various crowds assembled to welcome her. The Burgomaster's daughter
presented her Majest*- with bouiuets of orange flowers tied with mauve ribbons. The entire court, in car
riages, participated in the procession to the palace. A guard of honor composed of generals escorted the
royal coach. Six hours before the Queen arrived 200,000 people- had assembled in the streets and around
the palace.
Her Majesty ap

ARMORCLADS COMING
TO PACIFIC COAST
The lowa and Oregon Will Soon Be
Detached From the North
Atlantic Fleet.
NEW YORK, Sept. 6.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the fol
lowing: I learn to-day that two of the
armorelads attached to the North Atlan
tic fleet will leave within the next ten
days for the Pacific Coast. These vessels
will in all probability be the battleships
lowa and Oregon, which are now being
put in the best possible condition at the
Brooklyn navy yard.
The President will finally decide upon
his return to Washington. Reports in cir
culation here to-day indicated that the
vessels had been ordered to Manila, but
I am in a position to state they are un
true, and that It Is Intended to attach the
vessels to the Pacific station. There they
will be in such a position they will be
able to defend the Pacific Coast In case
of an attack by a foreign power or hasten
to the Philippines to give support to Rear
Admiral Dewey.
POISONED WHISKY SENT

Mysterious Attempt to Murder That
Is Similar to the Dunning
Case.
NEW YORK. Sept. s.â John Hills, an
ice-dealer of 84 Second street, his wife
and sister-in-law, Miss Mary Conley, have
been poisoned by whisky which had been
sent through the mail to the house. The
case in many respects is similar to the
poisoning of Mrs. Dunning and Mrs.
Deane by means of a box ef candy for

Mr. Hills, whose powerul frame with

the opinion that they were suffering from
a powerful poison, either atroplne or bel

FUSION IN WASHINGTON.
Democrats, Populists and Silver Be-

SEATTLE, Sept. s.â The conventions of
the Populists, Democratic and Silver Re
publican parties to meet at Ellensburg
on September 7 will attempt to nominate
a fusion ticket, as was done two years
ago. The offices to be filled at the fall
elections are two Congressmen and two
members of the Supreme Court.
Takes an Overdose of Morphine.
FRESNO, Sept. s.â Van Savage of Reed
ley died this forenoon at Reedley from
an overdose of morphine. He bought
fifteen grains of the drug yesterday and
took all but four grains. The Coroner's
jury found no evidence of suicide. Savage
had been addicted to the use of the drug.
He was a native of Indiana, aged 41 years
and unmarried.
Grave Charges Are Lodged
flgainst Government
Officials.
F^. S. Browne and C. M. Brune Ac
cused of Negotiating Stocl^
Ttyat Was Valueless.
Startling charges have been pre
ferred by D. P. Tarpey of this city
against two brothers in the employ of
the Government. One :is Robert S.
Browne, the Secret Service Agent of
this district, and the'other is known as
Clarence M. Brune, at present occupy
ing a position of responsibility in the
bond department. A letter was mailed
last evening to Hon. Lyman :D. Â« Gage,
Secretary of the Treasury, in which
Mr. Tarpey charges the brothers with
having financiered a bank to its ruin
and then used the worthless stock as a
means by which to defraud unsuspect
ing capitalists. Besides the charges
the letter contains a brief history of
the doings of the brothersâ brothers,
although their names fail to indicate
the family tieâ while together they
manipulated the machinery of the
Moscow National Bank at Moscow,
Idaho. The letter is interesting, and he
who makes the charges states that he
can prove them one and all, and has
unswerving _ intentions of so doing.
Here is the letter, charges and all:

Directors.
This last statement you will notice waa
signed, by both Brune and Browne, and
was sworn to by Browne as president, on
the 19th of December, 1596, about seven
weeks before the bank failed. This state
ment, if correct, would show the stock to
be worth about $145 per share.
The question that naturally suggests
itself here is, thnt the president and cash
ier must have known of the condition of
the bank all along, and how did they suc
ceed in getting the National Bank Exam
iner to make reports favorable enough to
allow them to continue business and swin
dle innocent people? YcflT'are the presi

exacts from officers of national banks. If

BROWNE'S STATEMENT.
When Mr. Browne was confronted with the charges he was much taken
h backâ first feieming surprise, then indignation. After he had recovered
his self-possession he made the following statement:
* So far as tho charges are concerned I will say nothing until J have con
sulted my attorney, as I have not had an opportunity to file an answer.
I do not know this man Tarpey, but admitting that his charges are true,
they have nothing to do with me whatever in my present capacity, as none
of them bear in the least on my official acts since my appointment as
Secret Service Agent.
shares of the value of $100 each. R. S.
Browne was one of the original incor
porators, and shortly after the bank
was placed in running order he sent
East and summoned Brur . Browne
t> ok the elevated position of president
of the bank and also appeared as a di
rector. Brune was cashier and direct
or as well. These positions they occu
pied until the bank, its affairs rotten
to the core, failed, and its business
was put in the charge of a receiver.
"Prior tn the failure of the bank an
ev<.-nt looked back to by the residents
of Moscow with a feeling akin to that
which makes the sons of Erin t-emble
when reference is made to 'tht )>;^
wind,' Brune left Moscow with his and
Browne' 8 stock. It was in the summer
of 1896 when the cashier of the institu
tion departed on his pilgrimage, and
the stock he carried he determined to
n.i le off or sell to whom he could, no
ter in how distant lands he dwelt.
Five hundred shares or thereabouts
were in his possession, and in hopes of
immediately negotiating it he came to
the metropolis of the coast, San Fran
cisco. Arriving her^ he immediately
opened up negotiations with several
capitalists, among whom were Edward
Byrne of Salt Lake and Mr. de Lash
mutt of Portland, Or.
"As a basis to carry on the traces he
proposed he had prepared the state

!;iy mind. The restllt was, that through
the skillful misrepresentations of
Brune, De Lashmutt parted with prop
erty valued at $15,000, and in return -e
\ 140 shares of bank stock that
later proved to be worth just $100 a
share less than nothing, a minus re
sult hardly desirable. A trade was

In return for shares of the bank stock
Brune received deeds to property
valued somewhere between $25,000 and
$.r>o,ooo.. r >o,ooo. The deeds were not delivered
directly to Brune, but were placed in
escrow in the Moscow Bank, pending
lhe arrival of a transcript of title from
Mexico, in which republic the lands
are situated.
' Tri'.r to the arrival of this tran-
Bcript the Bank <>f Moscow collapsed.
It? financial condition was a tangled
wreck, and an effort was made by
Byrne to recover the deeds left in es
crow in the bank, although it was un
derstood that the deeds were not to be
taken from escrow until the arrival of
the transcript from Mexico. Investiga
tion showed that the-- no longer re
mained in the vaults of the hank. They
had been taken Illegally. The stock ac
cepted in trade for the property was
sent to the Anglo-Californian Bank of
this city, and "was to be ta,ken from
escrow at the same time as the deeds,
but the wreck of the bank reached
Byrne's ears and he refused to accept
the worthless naper. The stock as far
as is known is still in the possession of
the Anglo-Californian Bank, where it
will, doubtless remain unless it is re
moved to be returned to Brune in the
event of a suit for the recovery of prop
erty is carried to a successful issue by
Byrne.
"Shortly after the failure of the
bank, as a natural sequence, a receiver
was appointed, in the person of W. H.
Stufttebaum. The affairs of the bank
were found by Comptroller Kckels to
be in such a rotten condition that it
was necessary to levy an assessment
Of $100 a share. This assessment the
receiver of the bank endeavored to col
lect by suit. The first suit was insti
tuted against De Lashmutt. He held
150 shares, and the assessment on them
aggregated $15,000. De Lashmutt an
swered, setting up the facts of the
fraud which had been perpetrated
upon him. The Government filed a de
murrer to the answer and the case
went to trial before Judge Bellinger of
the Circuit Court of Oregon. The Gov
ernment's demurrer was overruled by
the court, and the opinion overruling
the demurrer excoriated the perpetra
tors of the fraud. The court said, in
the introductory paragraph: 'One who
is induced by fraud to purchase stock
of an insolvent national bank, and
have it transferred to him on the books
of the bank, and who, upon discovery
of the fraud, takes prompt action to
rescind the contract, is not liable to as
sessment on such stock, except on be
half of persons who extended credit to
the bank, after the transfer, without
knowledge of the fraud.'
"In the closing parajyraph the court
held that in the case at bar the facts,
as disclosed by the separate defense,
show that De Lashmutt acted with
promptness upon discovering the fraud
that had been perpetrated on him, in
proceedings to disaffirm the contract
under which he took the stock, and he
brought suit to cancel that contract
and recover back the consideration
paid by him before this assessment was
! made; and It is not claimed that any
1 debt of the corporation was created be
tween the time of the transfer and the
, levying of the assesr-: .ent, so that, so
| far as the creditors of the bank are
; concerned, they have not been affected
iby the transfer to the defendant. No
i one has been prejudiced by what has
I been done. The rights of all persons in
j terested in the assessment made are
I precisely what they would have been
i had there been no transfer of stock by
Brows to the defendant. Under these
circumstances upon what principle of
justice, or of law, which is the em
bodiment of Justice, can De Lashmutt
be held to a liability on account of the
fraud by which he was induced to give
up a valuable property for certificates
Ol stock, which were not only worth
less at the time, but which carried with
them a large liability in favor of exist
ing creditors? The case is not differ
| ent from those cases where the action
i has been brought to recover the con
sideration agreed to be paid by the
transferee for the stock taken by him.
lln those cases the action has been
j brought either by the corporation itself
or by the receiver acting for the credi
tors of the corporation. In this case
the receiver has no greater right than
the corporation would have, suing in
its own right. The demurrer is over
! ruled.
"This decision settled the matter as
I far as the efforts of the receiver went
to collect the assessment from defraud- i
ed stockholders, and when the points In |

Browne and Brune appeared as defend- !

"In December, 1896, pending the con
] summation of the trade between Brune j
j and Byrne, Brune returned to this city '
j from Santa Uosa. A few days later he .
went to Moscow by the way of Port
i land, and I believe that it was at that â 
j time that he succeeded in completing \
, neeotiations between himself and Do I

property we were having troubles of

dure. 1 have placed the facts of the
swindle before United States District
Attorney Foote, Postal Inspector Mun
ro and Assistant United States Dis
trict Attorney Bert Schlesinger and
have been informed by them that the
offense committed by Brune is indict
able. The prosecution will be conduct
ed under the sections of the code pro
hibiting the use of the United States
mails for illegal purposes. Brune sent
several letters, copies of which I have
in my possession and the originals of
which I can easily procure, written for
the purpose of consummating the
swindle he perpetrated.
"Mr. Sehlesinger informed me that it
Is not necessary that a letter to be used
as a basis for such prosecution need
contain incriminating statements, but
if such a letter could, in any way, be
connected with such a swindle the of
fense of writing it and sending it
through the mails is indictable.
"Owing to this opinion of Mr.
Pchlesinger we have determined to
proceed, and have placed in the hands
of the authorities statements of the
facts, which we can prove. This state
ment will be reviewed by the Federal
Grand Jury this week, and in the
event an Indictment is found, and it is
safe to say that one will be, Mr. Brune
will be extradited from Wash
ington and placed on trial here for his
offense. The statement I have compiled
is, in part, as follows:
On August 20, 1896. Edward Byrne of
Salt Lake City, Utah, was the owner of
certain real property, situated in the State
of Durango, in the Republic of Mexico,
comprising some 83,000 acres, and known
as the Ranchos La Ciudad. El Jarro and
El Borbollon. The value of said property
was about $25,000 in United States gold
coin.
Being desirous of disposing: of this prop
erty, said Edward Byrne appointed D. P.
Tarpey and H. S. Krigbaum as his agents
to sell the same, and on the 20th day of
August, 1596. said Krigbaum, acting as
such agent, inserted in a dally newspaper
published in the City and County or San
Francisco, the following advertisement:
To Exchangeâ One of the best stock ranches
in the Republic of Mexico, consisting of 80,000
acres, well watered an<l timbered; no better
climate in the world; free ol incumbrances and
perfect title: value $20,000. â¢ > T.," box 4967, Ex
aminer office.
In answer to this advertisement Clar
ence M. Brune sent a letter, addressed
"T.." to box 4957. Examiner office, in
which letter he requested the person in
serting said advertisement in said paper
to let him know where they could meet
and discuss the exchange of said prop
erty, and giving his address as 1206 Mar
ket street. Said Krigbaum thereupon
sent a messenger to the above address,
requesting Mr. Brune to meet him at
room 07. Chronicle building, and there dis
cuss the matter with him.
On the following day Brune called at
room 07, Chronicle building, where he met
Tarpey and Krigbaum. He thereupon
proposed to trade some other property
he claimed to own in Santa Rosa for
Byrne's Mexican property. He also
i that he owned some stock in the
Moscow National Bank, of Moscow, Ida
ho, which stock he claimed was worth
$140 per share, and was paying dividends
of 6 per cent per annum; he claimed that
t lie stock mentioned was gilt-edged stock,
and that the bank was in a solvent and
prosperous condition, and stated that if
Byrne was not willing to trade his' Mexi
can property for tho land in Santa Rosa
he (Brune) was willing to trade some or
his stock for said property.
Brune also stated that he was the
cashier and a director of said bank, and
that he would not think of trading any
of his stock were it not for the fact
that his wife was sick and had to leave
M iscow. He showed Krigbaum and Tar
p< > a printed statement of the condition
of said bank, issued by the bank in July,
which statement he said was the
last which had been issued by said bank.
Krigbaum told him that they would
consider his proposition and look up the
Banta Rosa property. Several days
thereafter Brune called at room 67, Chron
icle building, while Krigbaum was not
there and left the following note:
Mr. Krigbaum: Have you looked up my
Santa Koea property or bank stuck yet for
that Mexican deal? 1206 Market street.
Within a week after their first meeting
Brune again met Krigbaum by appoint
ment at room G7, Chronicle building, Tar
pey also being present for a part of the
time. Krigbaum told Brune that they did
not desire to trade for the Santa Hosa
property, but that if the bank stock was
as Brune had represented they wore will
ing to trade for that; that the Mexican
property was worth $20,000, at least, and
that they would take $20,000 worth of
good bank stock for it. Brune thereupon
repeated the representations he had for
merly made as to the quality of the stock j
and the condition of the bank, claimed
that he owned a couple of hundred shares,
and said that he was willing to give 140
sharps for the Mexican property. Krig
baum told him that they would not take
any less than 200 shares for the prop
erty, but Brune said that the most he
would give was H~> shares, and he left
before any conclusion was reached.
Tarpey and Krigbaum thereafter decid
ed not to accept hrune's offer, and Krig
baum Font the latter a letter, stating that
they had concluded not to accept the
stock. Nothing further was done until
November 25. 1896. On that day Krig
baum wrote a letter to Brune at Santa
Rosa, asking him if he still had his bank
stock, and stating that if he had, Krig
baum had a new proposition, which lie
w< uld like to discuss with him when ho
(Brune) returned to San Francisco.
Brune then came down to the city and
had a conversation with Krigbaum, in
which he said that the value of the stock
was much increased since their last in
terview, and that he would not consider
the proposition contained in Krigbaum's
letter of November 30, but that he would
give 150 shares of said stock for Byrne's
Mexican property. Krigbaum told him ho
would consider this proposition, and
Brune returned to Santa Rosa.
Upon Brune's return to the city, on De
cember 9, the proposition to trade the
Mexican property for 160 shares of the
capital stock of the Moscow National
Bank was agreed to by Krigbaum, Brune
agreeing to pay the expenses of the trans
fer of the property, not to exceed the
sum of $150. Brune at this meeting stated
that the bank owned the property on
which it stood, which property he said
was worth $30,000. The parties agreed to
meet on Saturday morning. December 12.
is?r,. to complete the transaction, and
Brune requested that the papers be got
ten ready by that time.
Brune called at room G7, Chronicle build
ing, at 2 o'clock, according to agreement,
but as the deed to the property was not
ready it was decided to postpone the
transfer until the following Monday.
Brune requested that a power of attorney
be secured from the Mexican Consul,
which he (Brune) would send to some
person In Mexico for the purpose of per
fecting of record his title to said property.
He also requested that an abstract of title
be prepared, and said that the title papers
and deed to the property as well
as the certificate of stock might remain
in some bank In San Francisco, until the
abntract should arrive, when the deal
could be completed.
Krigbaum and Tarpey then ordered a
power of attorney to be prepared by the
Mexican Consul, and Tarpey wrote to J.
S. McGaughan, Durango, Mexico, to pre
pare and forward him an abstract of
title to the Mexican property.
Brune did not keep his appointment to
meet Tarpey and Krigbaum on Monday,
ON TRAIN, December 15. 1896.
H. S. Krigbaum Esq., room 67, Chronicle
building, San Francisco â Penr Sir: I am sorry
that I was unable to see you before I left, but
1 only received word to go to Moscow at once,
as my testimony was Imperative In some case,
Just before train time. My leaving will, how
ever, not, I hope, seriously Interfere with our
deal farther than a few days' delay. I shall
take this matter up at once, hy putting a
srarchrr c,n the records down there, and mid-
Ing papers with InFtructlons to some Pan
Francisco bank, which I shall advise you. I
may have time in Portland to do so, but
hardly think I shall, as I only have a short
time there. Will take it up Immediately on
my arrival at Moscow. I don't think time will
be any longer, as I would have to be advised
of the title anyway.
Hoping that you will not be seriously Incon
venienced, I am, yours truly. C. M. BRUNE.
Address until January, Moscow.
"This was the first letter of many re
ceived by Krigbaum from Brune through
which the deeds to the Mexican property
were placed In escrow in the Bank of
Mosecw. only to bo illegally removed,"
Kakl Mr. Tarpey, "in January of 1897."
The following letter, closing the series,
was received:
MOSCOW. Idaho. January 27, 1597.
H. S. Krljrbaum Esq., San Franciscoâ Dear
Sir: I will have to hurry this to get It In the
mail to-day. Will say that I have arranged
with the bank here to take care of our deal
and an attorney to look over the abstract when
it comes, which I hope will soon rench here.
I start In a day or so for the Pierce mines to
look over some properties, and will be gone
about ten days. I will return here and then
go East, so will be unable to go via San Pran
cluco. I might consider trading 100 to 150 more
shares, If you have some Al property. If you
will send me a full and complete description,
with definite proportion for clear property ud

*-> ISO shares, I will make investigation by
telegraph through a friend of mine there and
give you a definite answer before I leave for
the East. Yours in haste.
C. M. BRUNE.
This was the last letter received from
Brune. On February 1, 1597, four days
after it was written, the Moscow National
Bank failed and closed its doors and sus
pended business and payment, and a re
ceiver was placed in charge thereof, under
the Federal laws. Said receiver found tho
bank In an Insolvent condition and the
stock worthless, and on June 14, 1897, an
assessment of JluO per share was levied
on said stock by the Comptroller of the
Currency of the United States.
The last letter is believed to be, even
though others had not been written, suffi
cient grounds for the prosecution of
Brune. and It will be used as evidence
against him in event he, as a defendant,
appears before the courts.
HOW BROWNE AND
BRUNE ARE BROTHERS
A Loving Mother-in-Law Accounts
for the Difference in Their
Names.
That Robert S. Browne and Clarence
M. Brune are brothers, and brothers who
love one another very dearly, was ac
knowledged last night by Mrs. Tuttle,
who is proud of the fact that she is the
mother-in-law of Clarence.
"I do not know much about either of
the boys," she said, "nor do I know much
of Clarence's past history. I am his moth
er-in-law, but I have tried to be a good
mother-in-law, so 1 never asked any
questions. I know that he is the dearest
boy on earth, and has always been a very
loving and devoted husband.
"How is it that he and his brother go
under different names? Why, that is the
simplest thing in the world to explain.
When he graduated from Harvard he had
a longing for histrionic glory, and under
the name of Brune went on the stage. Of
course, he 'was a success on the stage,
and it was while playing in Montana that
he met my youngest daughter, who was
then with the Fronmans. They fell madly
in love with each other, and on their mar
riage both decided to quit the stage, al
though they had been very successful.
"Through friends at court he received
an appointment in service of the Govern
ment, where he has been very success
ful. T am as proud as proud can be over
my handsome son-in-law, and don't you
think I have a right to be?
"About Robert I do not know so much.
I know that his work has always been
very satisfactory. I hear that through
my daughters, but as I believe in attend-.
Ing strictly to my own affairs I know
very little about him. He calls to see me
frequently, but never talks about his past
life or affairs, and 1 have n<'ver taken the
trouble to ask him. I am sure if I did he
would tell me unreservedly, as both boys
are so frank and honest. He is deeply at
tached to Clarence, whom he speaks of as
his 'baby brother.' because he is the
younger of the two. I don't think the
Government has two agents in its service
Who are more honest, efficient and con
scientious than 'my two sons' as I always
rail them, and I am fondly looking for
the day when they will rise to positions
even higher than those they now hold and
worthy of their ability."
"Did either of the boys ever live in
Idaho?" was asked.
"Well, now really, that is something I
don't know, strange as it may seem. As
I said before, I attend strictly to things
which immediately concern me, and I
don't even know where their home was.
"As to the difference in their names,
that is an everyday occurrence. The greal
majority of the people who go on the
stage chanpr- their names, and Clarence
just thought it would be too much
trouble and too confusing to his friends
to go back to the original Browne, so
he Kept it Brune. Browne is awfully
commonplace, anyway, and Brune is a
little more distinguished."
Mrs. Tuttle is well known in this city,
as she has lived here over thirty years,
and considers herself a pioneer. She is
the owner of old Tuttle Hall on Bush
street, where the Society of Old Friends
was organized many years ago. She is
the mother of three daughters, all of
whom went on the stage, but are now
married and living in the East.
HOW THEY WORKED
A PORTLAND MAN
Ernest de Lashmutt Tells How He
Traded Valuable Land for
Worthless Stock.
PORTLAND, Sept. 6.â Ernest de Lash
mutt of Portland, when seen to-night,
says he has made no charges against
Browne, but does not deny that he may
do so at some future time. De Lashmutt
charges that in 1896 Browne and Brune
looted the First National Bank of Moscow
by disposing of all the securities for lands
in California and Mexico and then offered
him its management if he would take $15,
000 of the bank stock.
The investment appeared all right, as a
representative of the Treasury Depart
ment pronounced the bank in good condi
tion and De Lashmutt took the stock,
trading for it 360 acres of valuable land in
Washington County, Oregon. Shortly af
ter his arrival in Moscow the condition of
affairs became apparent and Immediately
following was an assessment ordered by
the Hank Examiner of 100 per cent on the
stock. The assessment was not paid
either by De Lashmutt or any other stock
1 holder, and the doors of the institution
i were closed.
De Lashmutt returned to Portland, and
â  shortly after began suit, first in the
; Washington County and afterward in the
! United States Federal Court, for the re
j covery of his Washington County land,
! on the ground that the deed was given
I under false representations. The case is
1 still pending, all decisions thus far having
i been in De Lashmutt' s favor and the evl-
I dence indicating that he was victimized.
De Lashmut is the son of Van B. de
Lashmutt, formerly Mayor of Portland
and known all over the Northwest as a
racehorse and mining man.

TO INVADE
SAN JOSE
Features of Admission
Day Parade.
THE LADIES TO THE FORE
NATIVE DAUGHTERS PROMISE
TO CAPTURE ALL HONORS.
Hundreds of Girls in Fetching Attire
Will Be the Center of Attrac
tion in the Big Pro
cession.
There Is going to be something doing;
down San Jose way the latter part of the
week in which the Native Sons will figure
to a considerable extent. They expect to
be the center of attraction, but they will
not, for several hundred Native Daugh
ters are going along, and naturally the
boys will be in the discard when the girls
break into the game.
Every one of the twenty-two parlors in
San Francisco and the six across the bay
are making the most elaborate prepara
tions for the Admission day celebration.
This has come to be known as Native
Sone' day, but in truth ought to be called
Native Daughters' day, for the ladies
have become the most attractive part of
these annual celebrations of the State's
birthday.
This year they are going to outdue even
themselves, and those who witness the
big parade in the Garden City next Fri
day will be astonished at the original and
beautiful effects prepared by their daugh
ters, wives, sisters and sweethearts. Now
there is L<a Estrella Parlor No. 89. for in
stance. The members of this parlor have
already participated in two celebrations,
on both occasions carrying off the honors
of the parade. They have arranged a
masterpiece for this year with which they
expect to retain their enviable reputa
tion. In accordance with their name the
starv.always plays a conspicuous part in
their designs, and this year they have
been peculiarly happy in selecting an em
blem appropriate to the occasion.
"The Star of Peace" will be represented
by twenty young ladies comprising the
drill corps of the parlor. It is safe to say
that nothing more beautiful and original
has ever been displayed anywhere. First
of all there will be a cr stalllzed star fif
teen feet from point o point borne by
five of the girls, the othe~ fifteen radiat
ing from thp star at the ends of long
white satin streamers. In the center of
the star, which is being constructed at
San Jose by E. H. Pratt, will be a large
crystallized cannon, from the mouth of
which radiates a sunburst of doves. One
is perched on the stilled dog of war, an
other is nestling just inside its mouth,
while five' more are taking flight, each
bearing a letter In its beak forming the
word "Peace."
The girls will be dressed alike in white
organdie, white ties, stockings and
gloves, and wearing on their heads pure

Then there are Minerva No. 2 and To

not to make any special feature with their
drill corps. They will all be attired in
white Swiss (In sses, stockings and ties,

Sequoia No. 160, Native Sons, has stolen
a march on its rivals by securing til? co
operation of Fremont No. 59, Native ;
Daughters, and with the aid of the ladies 1
hopes to carry off such honors as will be
bestowed upon the men. Sequoia has
chartered a Pullman car, which will be
attached to the special train leaving this
city for San Jose at 9 o'clock on the even
ing of the Bth, immediately after the
night parade. At the jubilee celebration
prizes were offered to the parlor parading
the largest number of members and the
largest percentage of its membership. Se
quoia captured both prizes, but was only
awarded the latter, the committee decid
ing that it was not intended that one par
lor should have both. That year it turned
out 160 men, but it expect! to have a
greater number in line Friday. The par
| lor has secured Belloli Hall for its head
1 quarters at San Jose, and there its mem
bers, assisted by the daughters of Fre
mont Parlor, will keep open house all day.
In the evening they will give a dance in
their hall independently of the grand ball
of the joint celebration. In the parade the
twn parlors, headed by Sequoia's band of
sixteen pieces, all being members of the
parlor, will march in column of fours,
I two ladies and their escorts in each rank.
The plrls will be dressed in white duck
dresses, white ties and white straw hats.
The men will wear white duck trousers,
blue flannel coats, neglige shirts and
white yachting caps. All will carry Jap
anese parasols.
Golden Gate Parlor No. 29 has com
pleted its arrangements for the celebra
tion. Preceded by a drum major and
band of twenty-five pieces in the parade
in this city, as well as in San Jose, and
led by Marshal F. S. Craumer. the parlor
will undoubtedly be one of the most con
spicuous in the parade, especially as their
banners and regalias are the finest in the
order. This parJor won the prize for the
largest, number of members in line at the
jubilee/celebration, and will make a gal
lant effort to hold its station in the com
ing Admission day parades. For head
quarters in San Jose the parlor has se
cured A. O. U. W. Hall, 152 South First
street, together with the elegant ladies'
parlor and banquet room. A collation

ZURLINDEN ACCEPTS
THE MINISTRY OF WAR
PARIS, Sept. 5. â General Zurlinden,
Military Governor of Paris, has ac

sion to M. Cavaignac, resigned.
General Zurlinden was a member of
the Hibot Cabinet, which went out of
office In 1895. His decision to accept
the war portfolio was communicated to
President Faure.
After long: conferences with the Min
ister of the Interior, M. Brisson, and
Minister of Justice, M. Sarrien, Gen
eral Zurlinden was interviewed by a
newspaper representative. The Min
ister of Justice, the general said, asked
for the Dreyfus dossier. When these
were given him he added he would
study the documents carefully and in
form himself thoroughly regarding the
case before discussing it with the
Cabinet.

Special Correspondence of The Call.
DAWSON, Aug. 11. via Seattle,
Wash., Sept. s.â After an interval that
was growing painfully long three boats
have within two days arrived here
from down the river. They bring alto
gether not a dozen through passengers,
but are all of them loaded with freight,
a large part of which is provisions.
The Alaska Commercial Company's big
new steamer Susie arrived Monday
evening with Louis Sloss, of th 2 com
pany, on board, direct from San Fran
cisco. She brought up but four
through passengers, but quite a list
from points along the river,
Mr. Sloss reports the beach at St.
Michael covered with the tents of un
happy people dumped there by irre
sponsible transportation companies,
which companies will be for the most
part unable to bring them up the river
as they contracted to do. There are
thousands of people there, he says, and
many of the river boats upon which
they were dependent for coming to
Dawson have been wrecked while being
towed on the ocean, or are still on the
ways under construction. He was be
sieged by these people for passage on
the Susie at excursion rates, but re
fused to amend his schedule. The Su
sie is now the queen of the Yukon
fleet her pre-eminence being beyond
dispute. She is 225 feet long by 40.
and she landed 400 tons of freight here,
to say nothing of that which she
dropped at stations along the way, all
the while drawing but four feet of
water. She came up the river In six
teen days. Three times she struck the
bars but easily backed off. She is
equipped in modern style. Her big
stern wheel stands almost to the height
of her upper deck, and coming up the
river Monday night, flashing her
searchlight over the city, she created a
sensation. ,
The following day the Portus B.
Weare, the old liner of the North
American Trading Company, came in
with 300 tons of freight. She had made
the trip to St. Michael and return. The
John Cudahy, the latest addition to the
North American Trading Company's
fleet arrived last night. She is of the
pattern of the old boats, but fitted in
fine style and with great power. She
came from St. Michael in twelve and a
half days, which makes a record. The
Weare brought nn passengers from St.
Michael and the Cudahy brought three.
The passengers on the Cudahy say
that the big crowd at St. Michael, hear
ing the dismal reports of unfortunates
going out by the boat load from here,
far outnumbering those wro carried
heavy sacks, are turning homeward and
that provisions are cheaper at St.
Michael than at San Francisco, flour
being literally given away.
Advices come up from Lieutenant
Richardson, who distinguished himself
at Fort Yukon last winter with Captain
Ray and who is now in command at
St. Michael, to the effect that the con
ditions there are much similar to those
he had to meet at Fort Yukon: that
trouble is belner brewed by certain ele
ments among the discontented and mis
led people who threaten the capture of
boats and destruction of goods to ex
tricate themselves from a dilemma or
to "get even" for supposed wrongs. The
difference is that he now has men at
his command, which means power to
effectively meet the situation.
The Susie started down the river yes
terday afternoon taking a shipment of
two millions in gold, a large part of
which was from the Canadian Bank of
Commerce. A number of heavy gold
sacks were taken out by individuals.
Perhaps the heaviest was carried by-
Charley Anderson, who cleaned up
$320,000 last winter from No. 28 El Do
rado, while John Lee from a lay of 100
feet square on the same claim took out
$125,000. Anderson is said to be the only
man on El Dorado or on any of the
creeks for that matter, who is still pay
ing $15 a day wages, or $1 50 an hour.
There is no longer any resistance on the
part of the miners to the wage rate of
$1 an hour, the fear being now that a
greater reduction will be made this
winter.
The mass or miners' meeting is still
the vogue, and the Dominion Creek af
fair is still the frequent occasion of fE
A meeting was held a few nights ago
at which a radical protest was made
against the action of the Gold Commis
sioner in canceling the original filings
on the creek and throwing it open for
relocation. It was determined by those
who had suffered from this cancellation
to carry the protest to Ottawa An
other mass-meeting is called for to
night to take steps toward the organi
zation of a miners 1 association, the pur
pose being to secure some sort of rep
resentation at Ottawa and the enact
ment of more equitable laws for this
The news of the reduction of royal
ties on the output of the mines from
10 to 2 per cent was received here last
week, and created a new atmosphere
in the camp. Another impetus is given
to mining, and the work of the coming
winter will, I am confident, distance
the records of all mining camps.
Great preparations are being made
for the season, a constant procession of
miners, with pick, shovel and provis
ion pack on their backs, passes out the
Bonanza trail, and pack trains move
out almost every hour. Great activity
is reported on Bonanza and El Dorado
especially in the neighborhood of
French Hill, that rises at and creates
French Gulch, notable for several
stampedes last winter. Bench claims
qover the hill and stretch the whole
length of El Dorado Creek and far
up and down Bonanza from the mouth
of El Dorado, where the old river bed
that made Skookum Hill and Skookum
Gulches so rich by its deposits can be
traced.
Jim Wardner came to town yesterday
after spending two weeks in the min
ing area. He pronounces the country
a wonder, and he says the old river
channel can be traced for fifteen miles
along the ridges of El Dorado and Bo
naza, and that the bench claims upon
it, 100 feet square, will prove as rich
as any ground on the creek level At
the mouth of El Dorado, on Bonanza
is the famous Skookum Hill that was
such a puzzle to miners last winter by
discovering wonderfully rich diggings
on its very crown. The bench or hill
diggings on Bonanza and El Dorado
and on French Hill are now known to
be a continuation of this deposit. The
representing work that compels a cer
tain amount of development on every
claim each year under pain of forfeit
ure has brought to light a good deal of
pay dirt that heretofore has only been
guessed at. On Bonanza previous to
this fall almost no work was done on
any of the claims above 58, because of
the difficulty experienced thereabouts
in locating the pay. Work is now be
ing done as high as 120 above, and good
pay has been found on No. 80 and No
89. Workers in several gulches leading
into the creek away up have discov
ered coarse gold also, and bench claims
are being located in the nineties. Very
many of these claims will be worked
all winter, employing very many more
men than were at work last winter. AH
the famous old claims will also be
worked, but few of them having been
exhausted. On Dominion, Sulphur,
TO SELECT A SITE
FOR GOAT ISLAND
TRAINING STATION.
Call Office, Rlggs House, Washington, Sept. 5.
Captain F. W. Dickins, acting chief of the Bureau of Navigation
in the absence of Captain A. S. Crowninshield, will proceed to the
Pacific Coast immediately upon the return of his chief for the pur
pose of selecting sites for the proposed buildings to be erected on
the island of Yerba Buena, which will comprise the training station of
the Pacific slope.
Hunker, Bear and other creeks, the
same is true, and a great deal more
work will be done this winter than was
done last.
All this means that the city of Daw
son is established to last indefinitely.
That far-sighted business men have
known this for some time is witnessed
by a substantial growth that almost
eclipses anything in the history of city
building. Since my second arrival
here, less than two months ago, I have
seen a "new city rise on the swamp
where I found a long and busy row of
unsubstantial shacks and tents. With
lumber at $200 a thousand and timber
more costly in proportion, three and
four story buildings have simply
walked up toward the sky, log has been
piled on log and dressed lumber fronts
have formed in line upon the main
streets with astonishing rapidity. The
town now has half a dozen theaters
and dance halls, admission to which is
gained by simply patronizing the bar
at 50 cents a drink; there is a telephone
that extends to El Dorado Creek and
encompasses the city; many of the sa
loons are brilliantly lighted with gas.
An electric light plant is here and
about to be set up. There are two
weekly newspapers. The programmes
of the shows at the competing dance
halls are emblazed in colored printing
on the dead walls. All the so-called
theaters have private boxes, where
men and women drink liquors and
watch the performances. After the
show at most of the theaters the floors
are cleared and public dancing goes on
for the balance of the night, the dance*
being each accompanied by more par
ronage of the bar, that being a re
quisite. The saloons nearly all em
ploy musicians, running the gauntlet
from harp to hurdygurdy. ' Some few
also of the restaurants entice patrons
with music. Two large and well fitted
hotels, where clean beds and good
cooking may be had, were recently
opened, both events being celebrated
by banquets and dances. With all this
Dawson stands ready to reap the full
advantage of any big development of
the mines and of new, rich discoveries
such as are daily expected. It is now
and will continue to be a very warm
mining camp. Gambling is at full
flood, the streets are full of people and
there is every sign of great activity,
and yet the large majority of the peo
ple who crowd the streets and impact
this busy air are without money and
without employment, and most of them
would refuse the kind of employment
that the country offers. They are
homesick and disgusted. Many of them
lack the means to get out and are hop
ing for some miracle that will cheapen
rates or place the means within their
reach.
The weather has been very warm for
several days and this has aggravated
conditions that have caused much nick
ness here and up the creeks. Typhoid
fever, malaria and dysentery have been
very prevalent and a number of deaths
have resulted. John D. Rainey, brother
of Sam Rainey of San Francisco, died
last Monday of dysentery and heart
failure. He had been ill but eight days.
The remains were taken charge of by
brother Masons and interred in the
cemetery here with fitting ceremony,
there being a number of handsome
floral tokens and the funeral was at
tended by a large number of friends,
among them several ladies. Mr. Rainey
was for ten years chief of the fire de
partment of Tacnma. His wife and
daughter are visiting relatives In San
Francisco.
John D. Debow died at the Catholic
Hospital and was buried last Sunday.
Eugene Solage died and was burled on
the 6th inst. The hospital, even to the
halls, is crowded with patients and an
other hospital recently opened is al
ready full. A large addition to the
Catholic Hospital is being built. The
type ot fever developed here is much
severer than was that of last year.
The little steamer Cossett was
wrecked while coming through Miles
Canyon on the 2d. S. M. Taylor has
arrived here from Copper River, having
crossed over from the Tanana to Forty
Mile River. He reports only suffering
and disappointment for the many who
went into that country.
INTERNATIONAL SQUABBLE
OVER A THIEF'S ARREST
VICTORIA, B. C, Sept. 5.-Klondikers
who arrived on the steamer Amur this
afternoon tell an interesting story of a
clash among Canadian and American offi
cials in the gold fields, involving what
promises to be a serious international
problem. The whole affair was brought
about by the attempt of the mounted
police to arrest a miner charged with the
larceny of $15,500 who had escaped to
American soil. Arthur Perry of Seattle
went into the gold fields last winter and
worked a claim on French Gulch on a lay
for Alex McDonald. When the wash-up
came this spring McDonald went to get
his returns. Perry then told the big mine
owner that he had shipped the gold down
to his office at Dawson. McDonald went
back .to Dawson, but found no trace of
the gold. He immediately dispatched of
ficers to his claim to secure Perry, but
he had flown. By dint of inquiry along
the water front it was found that Perry
and the gold had gone down the river in
a small boat. The mounted police were
appealed to. and Constable McPhail start
ed in pursuit accompanied by B. W.
Chisholm, who went to identify the thief.
The fact that the accused was then in
American territory did not stop the pur
suit, for on the Yukon extradition has
been waived right along, as the difficul
ties in the way of getting extradition
papers are so great after leaving Dawson.
Perry joined his wife at Circle City and
together they drifted down the Yukon
until they met the steamer Stoneham,
on which they took passage to St.
Michael. The mounted policeman went
down the river on the Monarch and over
took the Stoneham somewhere between
the Koyakuk and Tanana rivers. Perry
was found on board with his sacks of ill
gotten gold, and he was at once made
prisoner and transferred to the steamer
Columbian, which was met bound up.
Coming up the river the Columbian
stopped to help the Rock Island off a bar,
and in doing so got on herself. In the
meantime Mrs. Perry had reached Circle
City and worked up much sympathy for
the accused on the ground that he was
an American arrested by a Canadian of
ficer on American soil. Collector Ivey
boarded the boat at Circle, and when
nearlng Eagle City he declared himself
and demanded McPhail to release the
prisoner. The constable and captain pro
tested, but Ivey, saying he was prepared
to use force, drew a revolver, and point
ing It at the officer, pushed him aside and
took his prisoner. McPhail asked that
the man be held until extradition papers
could be obtained, but Ivey refused and
took both Perry and the gold, giving Mc-
Phail a receipt, which, however, did not
mention the amount of money taken.
Ivey and Perry got off at Eagle City.
McPhail went on to Dawson and reported
to the captain, and officers of the Colum
bian made affidavits. In the meantime
Crown Prosecutor Wade, Constable Mc-
Phail and several other officers of the
police have left Dawson in pursuit of the
prisoner. , _________________

PURSUIT OF THE KHALIFA
CAMEL SQUADS CHASE THE
FLYING DERVISHES.
Gallant Charge of the Twenty-First
Lancers Against a Force Out
numbering Them Four
to One.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Sept. s.â The War Office
received this evening the following dis
patch dated at Omdurman yesterday,
from General Sir Herbert Kitchener:
"This morning the British and Egyp
tian flags were hoisted with due cere
mony upon the walls of the palace in
Khartoum.
"All the British wounded have left
for Abadia In barges towed by steam
ers. I saw them before leaving. They
were all doing well and were comfort
able.
"The cavalry sent in pursuit of the
Khalifa were compelled to abandon the
attempt, owing to the exhaustion of
the horses, but I have ordered camel
squads to continue the pursuit."
Dispatches from Omdurman relate
that the newspaper correspondent,
Howard, -who was afterward killed,
participated in the gallant charge of
the Twenty-first Lancers. These troops
were scouting when they saw in the
basin between 600 and 700 Dervishes.
The Lancers charged the enemy and
suddenly found themselves face to face
with 2000 swordsmen, thus being out
numbered at least four to one. The
Dervishes were hidden from view in a
hollow. The Lancers charged through
them, re-formed and charged back to
recover their wounded, who were being
savagely slaughtered.
The official list gives the number of
British officers killed in the capture of
Omdurman as two, while thirteen were
wounded. Of the men twenty-three
were killed and ninety-nine wounded.
The loss sustained by the Egyptians
was: Officers, one killed, eight wound
ed; men, twenty killed, 221 wounded.
Colonel Rhodes, a brother of Cecil
Rhodes and correspondent of the Lon
don Times, was severely wounded a
bullet having struck him in the shoul
der.
FEATS OF BRAVERY
BEFORE KHARTOUM
LONDON, Sept. 6.â The latest ac
counts of the capture of Omdurman
adds but little to those received yes
terday. All agree to the brilliancy of
the cavalry charge of the Twenty-first
Lancers. This was the great feature
of the battle. Every man who fell in
the charge was immediately hacked to
pieces by the fanatics, yet the Lancers
re-formed as coolly as if on parade.
One corporal, covered with blood and
reeling in his saddle, was ordered to
fall out. He vvaved his Dent lance and
shouted: "Never."
When Lieutenant Grenfell was
missed Lieutenant Montmorency, with
a few comrades, made a most gallant
attempt to recover the body and hold
the enemy at bay with revolvers. They
secured the body and then lost it again
as the horse on which it was placed
shied.
There was another memorable inci
dent while McDonald's Black Brigade
was cautiously crossing the field, after
the Dervishes had broken, to dispatch
the wounded Baggarasâ an imperative
duty, owing to the custom of the Bag
garas to feign death and then deal a
fatal blow to the unwary enemy. The
Dervishes re-formed and made a des
perate rush upon an isolated camel
corps, believing they had it at thc-ir
mercy. The corps retired steadily with
out confusion.
McDonald's brigade, assisted by the
gunboats, came to the rescue and cov
ered the retirement of the camel corps
by pouring volley after volley into the
advancing Dervishes, who, although
their ranks were terribly thinned, con
tinued their desperate advance.
More Dervishes swept down, the en
gagement became swift and general
and the enemy was soon completely
routed.

FILLY OTJTFOOTS HER FIELD IN
STRAIGHT HEATS.
Belle W, at Long Odds In the Set
ting and Driven by an Ama
teur, Proves the Surprise
of the Day,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. s.â The Golden
State's greatest show, her State fair, was
opened to the usual first day crowd this
afternoon under most favorable auspices.
The weather was of the sort that turf
men say best suits the racing horse. It
was what Sacramentans would call
"nice," but the temperature makes a
San Franciscan yearn for the cool breezes
which boom off the bosom of the broad
Pacific. The track was perfection, and
the order in which the horsemen found It
can be better judged when it is stated
that a trotter in the 2:17 class (Prince
Gift) went the circuit of the mile course
in 2:12 flatâ and it was his first race this
season, too.
The win of the amateur driver, Wempe,
with his Belle W, was the sensation of
the afternoon, and the cheers that rent
the air showed that there is lots of true
sporting blood coursing through the veina
of California horse-lovers after all.
Dolly D. a daughter of Sidney Dillon,
from the Santa Rosa stock farm, cap
tured the Occident stake in straight heats
for the Messrs. Pierce. The winner's
share was $1660. Ed Lafferty drove the
good looking bay filly, and he never left
the issue in doubt. Prince Ansel, how
ever, made the favorite go the last heat
much faster than she did the previous
ones.
After Dolly D had proved her supe
riority In the first event carded, not a
favorite finished In front. Five books
were on, the elates reading J. C. Hum
phrey, H. Schwartz & Co., Phil Archi
bald & Co., the Brooklyn Club and the
Buffalo Club. The judges were J. W.
Wilson, who acted as starter; Dr. Mat
thews and Adjutant General J. W. Bar
rett, the timers; ex-Senator Frank do
Long and Al Leach. C. A. Neal's band
of soloists discoursed some very appro
priate and clever pieces of music, . and
the opening was voted to be ahead of
that of most years. To-morrow the gal
lopers will have their Inning, and a large
crowd is expected to be on hand.
Among those present to-day were:
"Plunger" McManus of San Francisco;
Directors Fox and Chase, the latter look-
Ing anything but well.
\V. M. Murry's Raclo pulled up lame
yesterday after a fast workout, but it
Is thought the lameness will not be per
manent.
Dolly D was whispered about as a "sho'
thing for the Occident stakes and before
the first heat the quotations on the five
boards of the bookies were: Dolly D, 2
to 5; Lynhood, 3 to 1; Maud Washington
and Prince Ansel. 4 to 1 eacn; George
Buckman. 5 to 1.
Maud Murry had been scratched and
Dr. Frasse excused on account of lame
ness.. After three scores they got away
to a fair start, Lynhood leading Dolly D
by a length as starter Wilson said "go."
and by two lengths passing the quarter.
Dolly D got on even terms with the Lyn
rnont colt when they : had gone a trifle
over three furlongs, and was never there
after approached, winning with ease by

passed Lynhood about a sixteenth from
home and under the whip beat him out
two good lengths for the place. Maud
Washington waa a distant fourth and
George Buckman an awful last. Time,
They went away on the third score In
the second heat and it was a good send
off for all but George Buckman. Dolly D
passed Lynhood when they had gone
about a furlong. Prince Ansel breaking on
the first turn and Maud Washington go
ing up at the quarter pola. Here Dolly D
was first by good two lengths. She was
eight lengths to the good at the half,
twenty at the three-quarters and won
with ease by ten lengths. Prince Ansel
trotted rings around all the others after
he had straightened out his tangle, and,
passing Lynhood once they were in the
homestretch, was second at the finish by
ten lengths. Lynhood third, ten from
Maud Washington, who broke again
three furlongs from home. Time, 2:26.
Before the third and final heat the odds
were: Dolly D, 1 to 7; Prince Ansel, 3 to 1;Â»
Lynhood and Maud Washington, 25 to 1;
George Buckman, 50 to 1. They were off
on the second score to a fine start and
Dolly D was closely pressed by Prince
Ansel past the quarter. The favorite then
dVew away until at the half she was two
lengths to the good. Prince Ansel second
by the block from Market to Mission
street. Lynhood third. Dolly increased
her lead to four lengths and when Prince
Ansel danced a short Jig on the last turn
she went on and won the race, jogging,
by twenty lengths. Prince Ansel secona,
more than three times as far from Maud
Washington, who did not beat Lynhood
much. Time, 2:21.
The winner showed her ability to go
close to 2:16 if Prince Ansel had had a few
speed lilies left. The entire stake (the
Occident) was worth $2525, of which the
owners of the Santa Rosa Stock Farm
(In whose colors Dolly D trotted) received
The three minute class trot, mile dash,
had seven starters, and the closing prices
were Bonsaline, even money: Phoebe Chil
ders, 3 to 2; Mamie Riley, 3 to 1; Bertha
R and Sibyl S, 6 to 1 each; Aggregate and
Joe Selby, 10 to 1 each. To a fair start,
after a few scores had been indulged in,
Joe Selby, who had the pole, went to
the front, leading past the quarter and
half by three lenprths. Bertha R and
Phoebe Childers close up at the quarter.
Bonsaline trotted very fast going from
the quarter to the half, taking second
place three furlongrs from home. She
led Into the homestretch by a small mar
gin, Jc-e Selby having made a bobble.
Coming around the last turn Mamie Rlley
came very fafit and improved her posi
tion in the homestretch. When Bonsa
line broke a furlong from home Mamie
Riley shot to the front, and though the
favorite was making up ground at a great
rate when she got straightened away,
Mamie Riley won the ra.ce by a length,
Bonsaline second by three lengths, Ber
tha R (driven by ''Dick" Havey) third,
Phoebe Childers fourth. Time. 2:18. This
was a very pretty race, and while per-
I haps the best horse did not win, there
were tÃrills of excitement in plenty of
it.

which Our Jack was at evens. Prince Gift
at 2 to 1; others from 4 to 8 and 10. Rect

he received several days ago. They got
away nicely after scoring a few times and
May B led Prince Gift by over a length
at the quarter and by a scant length at
the half. Nearing the three-quarter polo
the Salinas gelding. Prince Gift, passed
to the fore. In the homestretch Dona
than set sail with Lou, but she could
never get up, Prince Gift winning by not
quite a length in game fashion, Lou sec
ond eight lengths before May B. Dexter
D was distanced. Our Jack was pocketed
and his driver evidently came to the con
clusion that there were other heats and
other days. The time, 2:12, first half In
1:05, marks a fast heat.
Before the second heat was trotted Lou
sot to be an even favorite with Prince

to 1. others 12 to 25 to 1. To an excellent
send off Prince Gift led all the way
around by from one to three lengths and
won handily by two lengths in 2:l4>Â£, Lou
second, two and a half lengths before Our

from the half-mile ground. May B was

Lou second, May B third, Our Jack
fourth. Â»
There was Incitement, amusement and

facturer of paper boxes in San Francisco.
Lady Margaret and Mia Louise alternat

Mia Louise, three or four lengths to the
good, gave an Imitation of a clog dancer,
and got very tired in so doing. Wempe'd
mare came like a shot from a Mauser
rifle, and amid great enthusiam she won
by three lengths from Lady Margaret,
who beat Mia Louise by a longer dis
tance. Time, 2:16; first half in 1:06.
Topsy J danced a couple of disastrous
jigs, which accounts for her bad showing.
The last race was a mile dash for 2:18
pacers, and eleven came up for the word.
There was a fair "go," and Diawood

first easily by four lengths, Dictatress

MIDDLE-OF-RDAD
POPULISTS MEET
Many Differences Exist
Among Them.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CINCINNATI, Sept. s.â ln calling the
National Convention of the Middle-of
the Road Populists to order, J. A.
Parker of Louisville, secretary of the
Reform Association, strongly advocat
ed Independent action by the Populists,
whether at this convention or at some
future time.
Ignatius Donnelly was chosen tem
porary chairman and made a most rad
ical speech. He referred to Grover
Cleveland as a traitor to the Demo
cratic party and Senator Butler as a
traitor to the Populist party. Mr. Don
nelly advocated the reorganization of
the Populist party on the line of the
Middle-of-the-Roaders, as indicated in
their conference at Omaha last June
and again at Nashville, Term., last
July.
The usual committees on credentials,
resolutions, rules, order of business and
permanent organization were appoint
ed, after which a recess was taken un
til 3 p. m.
The afternoon session disclosed many
differences between the middle-of-the
roaders, wbo were denouncing fusion
ists as demoralizing. They were united
on the subject of such a permanent re
organization as to prevent fusion or
desertion hereafter and an independent
ticket for 1900, but there were wide dif
ferences as to how to prevent "fusion
desertions" and how to name the can
didates.
The question of proxies is one on
which control of the (convention hinges
and it was pending when the conven
tion adjourned till to-morrow.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Sept. s.â Amid song
and music the forty-fifth annual State
Fair opened to-night under most au
spicious circumstances. A large crowd
was present and listened with rapt at
tention to the varied programme.
Never before did the pavilion present
such a gala appearance. From the
rafters hung the flaps of the nation,
while the walls were decorated with
bunting and shields bearing the arms
of the United States.
The programme was opened by the
band, which is under the direction of
Charles A. Neale, playing "Hail Colum
bia." Then followed an overture,
Bergmann'B "Traum" by C. Keresen.
Robert Schumann sang with consider
able effect the "Cradle Song," and
was followed by the O'Malley
Sisters in their clever dance. The next
number was the Fest march from
"Tannhauser" by the band. Messrs.
Keller and Lindemeyer played a cor
net, duet, which was enj^usiastically
received. The singing of "America"
by the spectators concluded the even
ing programme.
There are already in position a num
ber of fine exhibits. It is expected that
all the exhibits will be completed by
Wednesday. The Union Iron Works of
San Francisco has about completed its
exhibit of models of cruisers and bat
tleships which were built at the works.
The models are complete in every de
tail, and will no doubt excite consid
erable interest.
One of the leading attractions ie the
art exhibit. Deputy Superintendent
Stanton, who is in charge of the gal
lery, has exercised considerable Judg
ment in arranging the exhibits. There
are more pictures this year than there
were last year. The absence of several
well known artists will be severely felt
by the art-loving public, which ex
pected to see their work on exhibition.
Among the familiar exhibitors, how
ever, are Yelland, Raschen, Cadenasso,
Partington, Cucuel, Chittenden, Mer
ton. Heath, Bloomer, Hubacek, Ku
neth, Latimer, Gamble, Best, Latz and
others.
Raschen exhibits a - number of very ;
fine pictures which he has recently
painted. One of these is the figure -of
a woman standing by a window in an
old-fashioned kitchen. On the window
sill are some vases hoMing cut flowers,
and the woman is . pouring ' water into
one from a pitcher. ; The background
of the picture as seen through the win
dow shows a building with quaint-tiled
roof, surrounded by trees. â ; The pic
ture was painted from sketches 1 made
in Munich, and the artist's wife is said
to have stood as a model for the figure.
Another excellent ' thing by Raschen
is a nude figure of Eve, done in pastel
and exquisitely framed. The figure
lies upon : its back, the'long hair form
ing protection to the body from the cool
green sward. ~. One knee ;is drawn -up
and one hand extended holds a luscious
apple. The attitude is one of abandon.
The : figure lis about ? two-thirds size.
The frame of this picture was designed
by the artist. The prevailing , colors are
green and gold. In one corner a model
of the apple stands out of â¢ the ' frame,
and in another corner a model of a ser
pent. .â â â 'â - ;.. â¢ ; .' ;. â¢â¢â¢:.%â¢-. .;.

SECRET WORK OF
THE COMMISSION
Planning for the Future
of Hawaii.
FIRST SESSION AT HONOLULU
TOTTB OF ALL xHE ISLANDS
COMMENCED.
Policy of the Government Outlined
in Speeches at a Mustering Out
Banquet of the Sharp
shooters,
BY HORACE WRIGHT.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, H. t. Aug. 22.-The
congressional Commissioners have
already commenced their secret
sessions in the Hall of Representatives.
All connected with them are pledged to
nviolable secrecy, but none the less
they are affable gentlemen, and in their
outside converse permit people to be
come impressed with the assumption
that all will be well with Hawaiiâ now
under a much more liberal form of gov
ernment than some of the newspapers
of the mainland led us to hope for. The
commissioners are accessible to all, ir
respective of previous conditions or pol
itics, and are evidently desirous of be
ing individually informed as to the true
condition of the' country, socially, in
dustrially and politically before calling
for public expressions of opinion or
settling down to the chamber work of
drafting the laws. This afternoon they
leave by the steamship Claudine to
visit the islands of Maui, Hawaii and
possibly Kauai. Commissioner and
Chief Executive Dole will not accom
pany them, but the Attorney General
and Mr. Thurston probably will. Col
onel John Richardson and J. M. Kan
eakua have been selected by the Ha
waiian Patriotic Leagues (male and
female) to travel with the party and
to cause all Hawaiians, members of
the affiliation, to pass in mass meeting
resolutions accepting annexation and
asking the Commissioners to grant to
all former Hawaiian citizens, whether
by birth or adoption, equal rights as to
the most favored citizens; in other
words that no special legislation
against Hawaiians shall be enacted,
and that in the event of the privilege
of the franchise being given to any cit
izen they shall be equally entitled to
the same privilege.
On Saturday evening Harold M. Sew
all, ex-United States Minister, and
Mrs. Sewall gave a public reception to
the Commissioners at their beautiful
seaside residence at Waikikl. r
At the tabli of honor, among the 120
Invited guests and members, sat Cap
tain Dodge, supported on his rigl.t by
Chic' Executive Dole and on his left
by ex-Minister Sewall. With them were
ex-Hawaii . Ministers Hatch and
Ihurston, Colonel Fisher, Major Lang
fltt, the Attorney General; United
States Consul General Haywood,
Colonel Frober, N. G. H., all of
whom, with Senators McCandless and
Waterhouse, ex-Hawaiian Charge d'Af
faires Castle, Captain Kidwell, Cap
tain McStocker of the Citizens' Guards,
Representative A. N. Gear and others,
spoke well and eloquently. The en
thusiasm was naturally frantically in
tense, but not indiscreetly or bragging
ly so. There waÃ still aloha left for the
old Hawaiian flag and the spokesmen
were all nobly generous to their de
feated foes. .
At the conclusion of this memorable
banquet I requested President Dole to
be good enough to inform me whether
I might with propriety and correctness
assert in The Call that the policy of his
Cabinet, his friends and himself before
the Congressional Commissioners would
be based upon the lines of "equal rights
for all," as enunciated by Ex-Minister
Thurston, and he gave me full permis
sion to so state, adding, however, that
much would necessarily depend upon
the attitude assumed by the Hawaii
ans and anti-i.nnexatlonists them
selves. If they would come in and act
friendly all would, he thought, be well,
but if they stood aloof and acted an
tagonistically they would have only
themselves to blame if the-*' did not ob
tain all that thei true friends wished
to give them.
The Tacoma, with horses and mules
for General Merritt's army, arrived
yesterday evening. The animals ar
rived in good condition and with but
very few losses. The animals will be
turned out for a week's pasture.
Ex-Minister Sewall's new title, as of
ficially announced, is Special Agent of
the United States.

CHARLES EDGAR MILL 9,
Commissioner for California In New York.EMMA HERBER'S STARTLING
STORY TOLD TO THE POLICE
DESCRIBES
HER STRANGE
CUSTOMER
Woman of Mrs. Botkin's
Appearance Bought
Candy July 31.
CAUTION TO SALESWOMAN.
State Chemist of Delaware and
Physicians Become Witnesses
for the Defense.
Another fact of strange cir
cumstantial import has been
added by the police to the evi
dence that they are collecting In
their effort to prove Mrs. Corde
lia Botkin the murderess of Mrs.
Dunning: and Mrs. Deane. When
Miss Emma Herber. the pretty
clerk of George Haas, first told of
the mysterious woman who bought
a box of candy the young lady did
not tell the whole story. The mem
ory of Miss Herber is better than
she knew, and last night she added
a new and startling chapter to her
recital. She was summoned be
fore the Chief of Police and to him
made a sworn statement that
sooner or later will find Its way
into a court of justice.
BClsa Herber declares that on
Sunday afternoon, July 31, between
3:30 o'clock and 4:30 o'clock, a
short, stout, full-faced woman en
tered the Market-street candy
store and asked for a box of candy.
The woman said she was In a
hurry and acted so. Miss Herber
noticed that the customer spoke
with an English accent. The cus
tomer said she wanted a special
box of candy or unmarked box that
she wished to send to some friends.
She was particular to ask that only
chocolate candies be placed in the
box and asked Miss Herber not to
fill it, as she intended to place in
it another present.
The woman's wishes were ob
served. Miss Herber took a spe
cial, unmarked box and filled it as
Instructed. The young lady was
shown the box of poisoned candy
that was sent to Dover. She looked,
at it a moment and then said that
it was similar to the one she had
sold to her customer on me after
noon of July 31. Then the Chief
of Police asked her to describe the
paper in which the box was wrap
ped. Miss Herber did so and iden
tified the wrapper on the death
dealing candies as similar to that
which she had used.
Beyond this Miss Herber knew
nothing and after swearing to her
statement she was excused.
Her description of the box of
candy and the wrapper are dan
gerously close to the box of poi
soned candies. Her characteriza
tion of the mysterious woman who
made the purchase is in a general
way that of Mrs. Cordelia Botkin.
Her explanation of the purpose of
the purchase fits that which sub
sequent events proved was the plan
and subterfuge of the murderess.
Yet Miss Herber has never seen
the strange woman that bought the
candy since the incident of the af
ternoon of July 31. She says she
does not know Mrs. Botkin. and is
not in a position to say that she
will be able to Identify her as the
purchaser of the box of candy. The
young lady will be given an oppor
tunity to do so, however, perhaps
to-day, as the, accused woman will
appear In court before Judge Cook
this morning.
Another vital and perhaps the most
critical piece of evidence that will be
used in the trial of Mrs. Cordelia Botkin
has been discovered. It is revealed in the
testimony regarding the character of the
poison used in the death-laden confec
tions that were sent to the unfortunate
women of Dover.
The Tall received last night from Dela
ware the first definite and authentic
report of the official analyses of the poi
soned candy, made after the. death of
Mrs. Dunning and Mrs. iJeane. This tes
timony is given by the State Chemist
of Delaware and by the two physicians
who attended the unfortunate women in
their illnoss and death. The importance
of this evidence cannot be underestima
ted, as it is probable that every issue
of the trial of Mrs. Botkin will revolve
around it. It will matter little whether
the woman be tried in this State or in
Delaware. ShÂ«' will have to explain sat
isfactorily her purchase of arsenic, and to
defend herself against the natural suspi
cion that arises from that purchase.
It is not imiu-obablo that the life or
death of Mrs. Botkin will depend upon
the testimony of the expert witnesses. It
should be remembered that the only direct
incriminating evidence against the woman
is her purchase of two ounces of arsenic
at the Owl Drug Store on June 1. She
frankly admits that .she bought the poi
son and tells why. She was not alone
when she bought the drug and others,
she insists, saw her use it for the pur
pose she had designated to the clejk.
Two months after, and a few days before
the poisoned candy was sent on its mis
sion of death, Mrs. Botkin talked earnest
ly, eagerly and mysteriously about the
use and effrct of arsenic as an agent of
death. These facts of apparent guilt are
of great circumstantial importance and
the defense admits must be answered,
particularly when they are viewed In
conjunction with the woman's relations
to Dunning.
The detectives of this city have, it
seems, fortunately for Mrs. Botkin, es
tablished too much. Had they rested
when they discovered the fact that the
woman had bought arsenic the conclu
sion would be a crushing one to the de
fense. But th<> police also proved the fact
that the arsenic sold to Mrs. Botkin was
powdered and not crystallized, a most
vital distinction in the case.
There can be no mistake in the matter
as Frank S. Grey, the clerk who sold the
poison, is positive. The arsenic bought
Jiy Mrs. Botkin was the commercial,
adulterated powder. The State Chemist
of Delaware and the two physicians who
attended Mrs. Dunning and Mrs. Deane
i.re equally positive that the poison
which brought death to the two vomen
was crystallized and not powdeicd or
pulverised arsenic.
These experts could not have intro
duced a more vital piece of evidence had
they declared that the poison was not
arsenic. The difference between pow
dered Jirsenlc and crystallized arsenic is
antipodal. One cannot be transformed
Into the other without agents that are
not common to people who have no prac
tical knowledge of chemistry. In giving
this important testimony the Delaware
witnesses nre particular to explain their
reasons. They tell their results of the
analysis of the candy and show with a
clearness satisfactory to themselves that
crystals and not powders were used. The
candy has not since been analyzed and
the statements of the Delaware experts
must be accepted as final.
This new revelation in the case, made
practically by the prosecution Itself, will
THE POLICE THEORY OF A HORRIFYING CRIME.
have a bearing that cannot be overshad
owed by any other feature of the case.
The authorities are now forced, It would
seem, to show how a most unusual trans
formation in a poison may be made, or to
show where Mrs. Botkin bought crystal-
Used arsenic.
The question of extradition is daily be
coming more complicated. The defense,
as a matter of course, will fight to the end
any attempt to send Mrs. Botkin to Dela
ware. The prosecution has given a new
reason why the woman should not be
triod in this State. The complications
that have arisen In the case have never
been determined in California, and the au
thorities are concerned for future con
tingencies as well as the present. Chief
of Police I^ees declared yesterday that if
it were possible he would ask the defense
to agree to the extradition of the woman
by the Governor and then contest her re
moval from the State In any tribunal of
justice that might be chosen. Unless this
is done the Chief insists that Mrs. Botkin
cannot be tried for the crime of which she
is accused.
The argument by which this conclusion
is reached is interesting. If Governor
Budd refuses to extradite Mrs. Botkin,
two courses of action remain for the au
thorities. There is a possibility that the
action of the chief executive may be re
viewed by the courts. State or Federal.
No one is willing at present to say that
such a review would be legal, but there
is a disposition on the part of the au
thorities to test the question. If this
avenue out of the legal maze Is closed
and tho woman must be tried for murder
in this State another difficulty will pre
sent itself. If the woman were acquitted
the question would never become of prac
tical interest.
If she were convicted the defense would
appeal to the State Supreme Court, and,
falling there, to the Federal courts. One
of the grounds for appeal would un
questionably be that California had no
jurisdiction and could not legally try the
woman for murder, as the effective ele
ment of the crime was in Delaware and
not in California. If the appellate court
should decide in favor of the defense on
this point Mrs. Botkin could never again
be tried for murder. The California
courts, having no jurisdiction, could not
act and. it is claimed, that the tribunals
of Delaware would be powerless to move,
since Mrs. Botkin had been once in
jeopardy of her life. The point is cer
tainly an interesting one, and will be fully
argued before Governor Budd when the
matter is presented to him.
The police expect to be ready on Wed
nesday or Thursday to present the entire
case, as they have it, to the Chief Ex
ecutive. The Chief of Police and his sub
ordinates were busy yesterday preparing
the affidavits that represent the Califor
THE CALL GIVES THE NEWS FIRST.
The Call gave another illustration yesterday of the superiority
of its news service over that of other morning papers. In the tragic
story in which Mrs. Cordelia Botkin is now the central figure the
overshadowing element of news was contained in Mrs. Botkin's ad
mission that on June 1 she had purchased arsenic at a local drug
store. The Call published this vital fact while its contemporaries
concerned themselves with speculation to determine whether or not
the drug clerk would bz able to identify j.a.rs. Botkin as Mrs.
Bothin. The developments of yesterday make the admission of Mrs.
Botkin the most important testimony in the mysterious murders of
which she is accused and for which she will be tried for her life.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, 1898.
CRYSTALLIZED ARSENIC WAS IN THE CANDIES.
DOVER. Del.. Sept. s.â So far as is known the arsenic :in the candy
which poisoned Mrs. Deane and Urs. Dunning was in lumps, although . it
may have contained poison in crystallized form. State Chemist L. R.
Wolfe, who made the ofiicial analysis, states that he found lumps as large
as peas, which have been preserved. He is of the opinion that some of the
candy was contaminated throughout by arsenic.
Dr. Bishop, who attended both women and also examined the candy,
found lumps and believes that the poison was put in the candy in that
form. Dr. Downes ti who was the consulting physician, agrees with Dr.
Bishop. ' "... .*
Miss Josephine Baleman, who ate some' of the candy, afterward picked
lumps of arsenic from her teeth and extracted one good-sized lump which
had become imbedded In her mouth.
Those who are familiar with the candy believe arsenic in lump form
was used, although a local authority on the subject says the drug may
have been crystallized first, and afterward mixed with some chemical to
make it solid and convenient to handle..
There is no question that the arsenic discovered In the candy was crys
tallized and not pulverized. " Â»

nia phase of the prosecution. Mrs. Rauof,
Frank S. <Jrey and the others who have
supplied shreds and patches of evidence
were sumjnoned to police headquarters
and made sworn statements. This testi
mony will be presented with that sent
from Delaware with the application for
extradition.
In the meantime two legal proceedings
must be considered in court. The appli
cation of the defense for a writ of ha
beas corpus will be called this morning
by Superior Judge Carroll Cook and will
be continued. It would obviously be a
waste of energy to argue the case
at present, as the woman would be im
mediately rearrested even if Judge Cook
rendered a decision favorable to the de
fense. The matter will be postponed,
therefore, until after the extradition pro
ceedings take place before Judge Cook.
The Police Court investigation has been
set for to-morrow morning before Judge
Joachimsen. It also will be evaded as
far as any definite Issue is con
cerned. Neither the District Attorney nor
the Chief of Police wishes to commit him
self to a position of prosecutor in this
proceeding. Under the theory of the pro
secution the authorities are simply hold
ing Mrs. Botkin in custody until the is
sue of extradition has been determined.
The charge of murder has been made at
the request of the Delaware officers and
not with a purpose of committing this
State to a prosecution of the woman
Delay will consequently mark the policy
of Chief of Police Lees and the District
Attorney. If. however, Judge Joachim
sen should decide, as it is claimed he has
power to do, that this State has jurisdic
tion in the case, a new and dangerous
complication would be interjected. The
police and not Mrs. Botkin's attorneys
would then be on the defensive. These
conflicting legal possibilities have excited
a national interest, as they are novelties
in the history of American crime. Every
effort will be made therefore to define the
law of jurisdiction of California, even if
the fight must be carried to the Supreme
Court of the United States.
The local authorities are acting now
with a very clear realization that their
hasty action of last week has caused
them a great deal of trouble and almost
involved them in the commission of fatal
blunders. When the tragic case was
brought to the attention of the local
Grand Jury. Chief of Police Lees had no
other purpose than to use the official in
quisition as a drag net to force reluctant
witnesses to appear and tell under oath
all they knew. It was Impossible osten
sibly to use the Grand Jury for this pur
pose, and the authorities were willing
at what they believed to be a minor sacri
fice, to accept an indictment for sending
poisoned confections through the mails.
Even such an indictment, however, would
commit Mrs. Botkin to a trial in this
State, the very result the police do not
want. The proceedings before the Grand
Jury, therefore, will be dropped and the
drag net will be cast in other waters.
TAKING AFFIDAVITS
OF THE WITNESSES
Chief Lees is, as rapidly as possible,
reducing to affidavits the testimony of the
California witnesses in the case against
Mrs. Cordelia Botkln so that the requisi
tion papers may soon be presented to
Governor Budd with the necessary evi
dence to support the request they con
tain.
From noon yesterday until late last
evening Assistant District Attorney Hos
mer plied his numerous witnesses, and
by noon to-day it is expected that all of
the evidence so far adduced by the prose
cution will be la presentable shape.
Chief Lees expects to have his case be
fore Governor Build by the time - the
executive will have finished the business
which brings him to town.
Of the witnesses Mrs. Rauof, Mrs. Bot
kin's one-time friend and nurse, was the
first to arrive. She was Immediately
ushered into room 6, the official conning
tower, and the reduction of her evidence
to script consumed a full two hours.
Frank S. Grey of the Owl Drug Com
pany followed, and he was closely ques
tioned not alone as to the circumstances
surrounding Mrs. Botkin's purchase of
powdered arsenic, but also with regard
to his previous acquaintance with the ac
cused woman.
George Haas, the confectioner, to whose
store the fatal box has been traced, was
brought in, but his only testimony was
regarding his recognition of both box and
candy as the output of his establishment.
The depositions of Mrs. Seeley, Miss
Lizzie Livernash, Detectives Gibson and
McVey, the employes of the City of Paris
and the shopping companions of Mrs.
Botkin remain to be taken.
It is expected that W. A. Botkin, the
husband of the defendant, will be called
upon by the prosecution to tell of the
alleged sickness of .his wife, during her
stay in Stockton previous to arrest.
M>. Botkin spent the morning with his
wife. Miss Dora Brown and Detective
Gibson were also morning visitors. In the
evening Attorney and Mrs. Frank Mc-
Gowan came in for an hour upon unoffi
cial business.
Grey Sees Mrs. Botkin.
After 1 o'clock this morning Frank S.
Grey, the clerk in the Owl Drug Store
who sold arsenic to Mrs. Botkin, was
taken to the City Prison to identify the
accused woman. The proceeding was
purely a formality in connection with the
extradition application. It was unneces
sary, as The Call published exclusively
yesterday the fact that Mrs. Botkin ad
mitted the purchase. The clerk was able
to identify the woman.
MONSTER BAND WILL
PLAY AT THE FAIR
The Irish Fair has entered upon its last
week, and the management is satisfied
that it will be a financial as well as a
social success. Since it opened manager
L. "W. Buckley and Assistant Manager
Charles B. Tldball have been unremitting
in their attention to the various interests
of the big exposition.
As the end draws near special efforts
are being made to present as many and
as varied forms of entertainment as pos
sible, and there is no doubt that they
will succeed. For several days Band
master George W. Bennett, who has done
such excellent work with his musicians,
has had in preparation one of the most
unique musical treats that has ever been
presented in this city. He has completed
arrangements with the leaders of the

Yesterday was designated as "Labor
Day" and "Leinster Province Day," and
the attendance was as good as at any
time. There were extra dancing features
by the pupils of several of the dancing
teachers, which was highly appreciated.
The St. Vincent's Convent Guards came
down from Vallejo on one of the early
boats and spent the afternoon among the
various attractions. About GdG children
of St. Patrick's School, and their teachers
were also present.
FATHER YORKE GOING TO IRELAND.
His Health Failing and He Leaves for a Long
and Much Needed Rest,
As soon as he can finish up the work he is at present engaged In
Rev. Peter C. Torke, chancellor of the diocese, will leave this country for
a long and much-needed rest.
During the past few years Father
pltal and at once picked up the
thread of his work, even trying to do a little more than usual, If possible,
to make up for lost time. His physician advised him to leave off a little,
but he laughingly called attention to his robust frame and scouted the very
Idea of taking a holiday.
His physician, seeing that neither threats nor coaxing had any effect,
gained the ear of friends of the young priest, who finally persuaded him
to take a trip to Ireland. It has not been decided when he will start but
preparations are already being made.
BRINGS A LOAD
OF GOLD DUST
Steamer Portland Ar
rives From Alaska.
The steamer Portland from St.
Michael reached port late last night
with nearly two tons of gold belonging
to the Bank of Commerce at Davvson,
the Alaska Commercial Company and
twelve of the 240 passengers who came
down on the vessel.
Charles Anderson, - pioneer of the
gold fields, who is perhaps the most
wealthy miner in Dawson City, brings
with him dust and nuggets valued at
from $60,000 to $90,000. Anderson was
the virtual discoverer of El Dorado
Creek, but did only fairly well until
recently, when he met with a wonder
ful piece of good fortune.
During a spree he was induced to
buy No. 29 on El Dorado for $800. When
he awoke in the morning after his good
time and discovered a bill of sale for
the claim he felt that he had been vir
tually robbed and attempted to secure
his money from the men who had sold
him the property, which he thoueht
valueless. His efforts to recover his
$800 proving of no avail he began pros
pecting to see Just how badly he had
been bunkoed.
To his surprise he panned out gold
by the bucketful and it is estimated
that nearly $300,000 has been taken out
of the despised claim. The original
owners learned of the value of the
property which they had been so ready
to dispose of at a low figure and sought
to get it back from Anderson, but re
ceived the laugh which they had given
the lucky Anderson at the time he had
beien induced to purchase the claim.
A partner of Anderson, John Lee, also
came down on the steamer. He owns a
goodly share of the treasure aboard.
Just before the two men left Dawson
they purchased a half interest in claim
No. 30 on the El Dorado. For this in
terest they are said to have paid $208,
000.
Ed Nelson, William Young and
Charles Lamb are three other success
ful miners from the Minook and El
Dorado districts. They, with Ander
son and Lee, are about the only ones
on the vessel having much gold, but
besides them six or seven other pas
sengers have perhaps $60,000 divided
among them. About one hundred of
the passengers are laborers and car
penters who have been working in
Alaska.
It is claimed by the miners that there
are about forty good claims around
Dawson, and the others hardly pay the
working. Minook, El Dorado and
nearly all the creeks are overrated.
Circle City works steadily and good
strikes are being made near. there. The
great rush at present is to Kowukuk.
which is about 150 miles from Fort
Hamlin.
The river boats are not very likely
to get up even as far as Circle City.
The miners say that of the thirty
which have started up at least twenty
are already frozen in, and it is doubt
ful if the remaining ten will be able
to get farther than the rapids.
Edward O'Brien, watchman on the
Leah, was washed overboard near the
Russian mission and his body was not
recovered. He formerly lived in San
Francisco. Andrew Wilson, a sealer
on the Louisa, fell overboard am? was
drowned while loading coal at the Holy
Cross Mission.

amount of work â his capacity for
work seemed marvelous â and
everything he put his hand to
has prospered, but the long strain

TOOK A SHOT AT
HER BETRAYER
Evelyn Holt Gets Re
venge for Wrongs.
Evelyn Holt, a petite and prepossessing
brunette, revenged herself for numerous
slights and insults last night by shooting
Charles Fecker, a former lover, in the left
shoulder, inflicting a painful but not dan
gerous wound.
The shooting occurred on Jones street
near Ellis, about 8 o'clock last evening.
Fecker, In company with his wife, was
walking along Jones street when thÂ«
young woman came behind him and fired
a .32-caliber bullet into his body. Feckei
attempted to grab her, but only succeeded
in snatching her cape, which she allowed
to slip from her shoulders. The wounded
man left his wife standing and rushed up
the street in search of a physician.
The would-be murderess ran into a near
by lodging-house and into a room where
three men were sitting. She excitedly
told them what she had done and asked
whether there was another exit. On
being told there was none she called for
pencil and paper and calmly wrote a note
to the police, notifying them where she
could be found. One of the men then took
the note and delivered it to Officers J. D.
McLane and G. de Blols, who were at
tracted to the scene by the shot, and they
took her to the City Prison. She was
placed behind Desk Sergeant Brown's
desk until Fecker could be found to
lodge a formal charge against her. At
the request of the officers he charged her
with attempted murder.
Fecker is a tall, smooth shaven man and
his face was naturally pale from the ef
fects of the physician's probe which was
used to locate the bullet.
The first warning he had of her pres
ence last night was a shot and a sudden
sting In the back. He claimed to hava
been on the operating table, for two hours,
during which an attempt was made to
find the bullet with pour success.
The prisoner told a sad story of ill
usage on the part of Fecker and the rea
sons that led to her shooting him, with
great frankness.
"I don't regret shooting him," she said,
"because if ever a man deserved it he did.
I am sorry 1 did sot kill him, because that
was my intention.
"I had written him earlier in the day to
come and see me and return the money
he had swindled me out of. He refused to
do so and treated me so wretchedly that
I went down town to-day and bought a
pistol and went out looking for him. Ha
was walking down Jones street when he
saw me. .He said something to his wife
and they both laughed. Fecker then
turned around and tossed his head in a
way that angered me. He did this a sec
ond time and not being far behind I hur
ried forward and as he turned to his
wife I shot him. He turned and grabbed
my cape. I ran away because I \va3
afraid 1 would be taken to prison in tha
patrol wagon.
"I had been living with him at 406 Geary
street for over a year and a half. He al
ways told me that he wanted to marry a
wealthy woman and get her money and
then go East with me and live happily.
I always wanted him to marry me, but
that was the only reply he would give me.
On June 24 he persuaded me to go to Los
Angeles, and a half-hour after I left ho
got out a license and married Anber Can
non, a woman whom he met at the Pacific
Matrimonial Bureau Agency and whom
he believed to have money. While I wa3
In Los Angeles he wrote me nearly twen
ty letters, telling me that when he got his
wife's money he would take me East.
"On my return from Los Angeles he
hired a room for me at 22S Powell street.
He would visit me and make all kinds of
promises. Knowing his reputation and
not believing him, I demanded that he re
turn my money that I loaned him. He
always put me off and then stopped com
ing. I then called at his office, but he
would never see me. I then told his wife
that he must come and settle with me,
otherwise I would kill him"
Fecker received unenviable notoriety
by his connection with a matrimonial
bureau.

DEGENERATION OF THE POUND.
' I "HE conviction in one of the Police Courts of
a deputy pound keeper for having used vulgar
* language in capturing a dog indicates that the
public pound is rapidly relapsing into its old condi
tion of inefficiency and disgrace. The evidence
given in the case in question showed that this deputy
entered a store on Fifth street in pursuit of a valua
ble dog belonging to the proprietor, and upon being
remonstrated with for attempting to take the animal
replied in language at once indecent and abusive.
A number of ladies were in the place at the time
and all were immeasurably shocked by the conduct
of the official. When arrested and arraigned for the
offense, the deputy not only admitted the use of the
language, but repeated it in open court, on this occa
sion applying it to the Judge himself. A charge of
assault with a deadly weapon is also pending against
this deputy. It is alleged that he drew a pistol upon
the owner of another dog who objected to his
methods.
This is the old story over again. It is the public
pound in the hands of politicians who have no re
spect for the laws, but who are intent only upon
making fees. During all the years in which the
institution was in charge of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals there was not
a single well founded complaint of lawlessness or
violence. But ever since the Board of Supervisors
took the pound out of the hands of this society and
gave it to a political favorite complaints have been
frequent.
The trouble always was with the pound that hood
lums were given authority to scour the city in search
of stray animals. Perhaps it would be difficult to
get easy going, respectable citizens to enga-ge in this
business, but there is no reason on earth for confer
ring the authority to impound animals upon hood
lums and blackguards.
At one time the pound became so disreputable that
it constituted a factor in politics. Boss Buckley
placed it in charge of the late Jake Lindo, whose
cruelty and lawlessness became so conspicuous that
there was a general protest against his management.
The hoodlums whom he employed used to actually
break into corrals and release cattle for the purpose
of impounding them, and almpst every day they stole
dogs or took them out of the arms of their owners.
The political downfall of Boss Buckley was largely
attributable to Lindo's management of the pound.
There ought to be a lesson in this for the politicians
who are at present running the city government.
FOR MR. MAGUIRE'S INFORMATION
/~* ANDIDATE MAGUIRE, naturally desiring to
I reach the people, presented through The Call
of yesterday a long letter. Whatever of in
terest the letter may have contained, or whatever fal
lacy, there is no purpose now of setting forth. But
the letter closed with a question to which answer is
appropriate and easy:
If Mr. Case will look to the columns of the San
Francisco Call of August 24, 1898 (published early on
that morning and long before the convention had con
eldered any candidate for office), he will find the entire
tlrkc-t, as afterward nominated, duly published. 'Where
did The Call gat the ticket?
The Call got that particular information just as it
had obtained the knowledge in advance that Maguire
was to be the nominee of three parties, or at least
of the fractions of three parties; just as it is now
collecting data pointing to the inevitable conclusion
that Maguire will be defeated. For days before the
Democratic convention was held reporters for this
paper were among the delegates and active politi
cintis. They made inquiries and weighed the an
swers. They ascertained the trend of party opinion
and when the declaration was printed that Maguire
would be the selected candidate no Idle guess was
made.
It is true also that the Republican ticket was pub
lished before the convention had dine its work.
There was nothing strange about this either; it indi
cated merely that the young men of The Call were
active in gathering the ideas of the delegates as soon
as they began to arrive at Sacramento. They felt
the public pulse. That was their object in being
there. Men from all parts of the State were in
terviewed. It was possible thus to obtain the senti
ment of every delegation. Then what could be
more simple than the adducing from the aggregate
of expressions so unreservedly given the certain out
come? This The Call did. Mapnire marvels. Still,
in these days, there is no reason why intelligent news
paper enterprise should create wonder.
Sherman's ambition to become Governor of Ohio
will generally be taken as evidence that the charge
Kgainst him of growing childish is founded on more
than political prejudice.
An evening paper wants to know where Pando got
all that money. No matter. He arot all there was.
JUDGE MAGUIRE ON LAND OWNER
SHIP.
IN his speech of February 4, 1898, to which we have
referred in discussing his livery stable railroading.
Judge Maguire dealt with all that he calls monop
oly and special privilege, which it is his mission to
abolish. He put the private ownership of land in the
pillory with the railroads, and pelted it as a monopoly
worse than all others.
He said: "The Government must ever occupy the
position of a general trustee of the common interests
of the people. Those things that of natural right
belong to all the people are held in trust by the
Government, the only institution that represents all
the people, in trust for the whole people, to be pre
served from generation to generation inviolate, their
use being regulated by the trustee, subject to the
power of popular control as the exigencies of the
time may require. These subjects of common right
should be forever kept open to all the people on
terms as nearly equal as it is possible to make them.
The land of every country, for example, is the com
mon heritage of the people of that country and of
all who come to it by birth or immigration. It is
just as truly the common heritage of the people as
the air and sunlight and it is just as inalienable be
cause it is equally with air and sunlight necessary
to the sustenance of human life. To part with the
right to use the land is as fatal to the natural right
of life as would be alienation of the right to breathe
the atmosphere. But, unlike air and sunshine, land
cannot be used in common, and, unlike air and sun
shine, it can be made the subject of aggression and
monopoly by the strong and cunning to the extent
of interfering with the equal rights of the weak and
undesigning. It is therefore the function of demo
cratic government in dealing with this equ 1 natural
right of the whole people to prevent the interfer
ence of the unscrupulously aggressive with the equal
rights of their fellow men, and in the exercise of that
negative power, to determine by just and general
rules, of uniform application to all citizens and to all
lands, the terms and conditions upon 'which the ac
knowledged natural right of each citizen to his share
in the soil shall be exercised."
He then proceeded to work out his idea, using
drained lands and irrigated lands ajid other kinds of
lands in illustration, and said: "True it is the sys
tem now in vogue, and tolerated by the Democratic
party and by Democrats, but it is equally true that
it is not only an undemocratic system, but an anti-
Democratic system."
It will occur to the common mind that his sus
tained analogy between air and sunshine and land
should logically cease at the point where he admits
that they differ. Air and sunshine are the common
elements necessary to life, which man enjoys in com
mon without his own volition. No labor on his
part is necessary or possible to prepare these for his
use or subject them to it. His enjoyment of the
air, his use of it, is involuntary on his part and con
tinues while he sleeps and his consciousness is en
tirely suspended. His sight, hearing, taste, smell
and touch cease on his pillow, but his use of air to
keep his blood in a state necessary to his life con
tinues without voluntary* labor on his part.
In like manner he uses the sunlight and has its
use in the growth of plants and animals necessary
to his sustenance, without labor on his part. He
does not pry up the sun when it rises in the East, nor
does he toil to send it below the horizon when it
sets and by setting throws all nature into that re
pose in the dark hours which is as necessary to life
as the stimulus of light during the day. With the
use of land by civilized man the case is widely dif
ferent. It is only in savage life that the land is
the property of the commune. To get an illustra
tion of the difference in effect between Judge Ma
guire s communistic ownership of land, and its pri
vate ownership, we must go to barbaric man. He
lived on the soil in that perfect equality of right to
it upon which the Judge insists, but never anywhere
did he subject it to its nobler use. He ranged over
it in perfect equality in pursuit of the game which
pastured on its forage and of the nuts and fruits
which it produced without his labor. But nowhere
in history is it recorded that primitive man invented
or progressed in the arts under such commune own
ership of the soil. His life was leveled down to the
plane of what the soil bore without his labor.
The arts arose when the individual man felt wants
that nature did not spontaneously supply. To meet
those wants he resorted to the soil, put upon it his
labor, and to protect that labor and its fruits as
serted private ownership in what had been the prop
erty of the tribe or commune.
Civilization began with the private ownership of
land. From that point the arts arose and multi
plied, industries varied and were differentiated. When
land was the property of the commune, hunting and
gathering the fruits and nuts it produced sponta
neously were the only industries. The investment
of individual labor upon land to increase its produc
tion required that the laborer own it His labor
and the subjection of the land thereby to nobler uses
produced a surplus of its fruits and gave the owner
that surplus to exchange for what his enlarged wants
â¢â¢equired. This was produced by other labor in
other industries and the constantly increasing wants
of man as he rose from the communal ownership of
land stimulated ingenuity in supplying them, and
tools, machinery and invention increased man's pro
ductive capacity in all directions. Now, Judge Ma
guire denounces the private owners of land, to whom
we are indebted for the dawn and rise of civilization,
for the differentiation of labor, for the myriad of
inventions which distinguish civilization from bar
barism, as monopolists and aggressors, as the strong
and cunning robbers who have despoiled the weak
and undesigning. For them he has a rod in pickle
in the form of the single tax, provided in amend
ment No. 2of the State constitution. His appeal
is made to those who either by taste, inclination and
training have not become land owners, and to the
other class whose lack of thrift and industry has pre
vented their owning anything.
He arrays the house of want against the house
of have, and tilts at all the results of thrift and in
dustry. The expectations invested in this campaign
are not easily concealed nor mistaken. Every single
taxer in the State who believes in the confiscation
of land supports him. Among them are many Re
publicans. Their attachment to the general prin
ciples of their party and their pride in its history
would naturally command their loyalty to its ticket.
But they support Maguire because he stands for con
fiscation of land, and yet we rre told that land con
fiscation is not in issue in his candidacy.
Any contractor deliberately selling diseased meat
to soldiers or to any one else deserves the severest
punishment the law can mete out. Unfortunately the

THE SAN FBANCTSCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, 1898.
WITH the opening of the State Fair at Sacra
mento a display is made of what Californian
farmers can do in the way of growing prize
products in a dry year. It is a display that could
not be duplicated in any other State even in the best
of seasons, and affords a striking proof of the wide
variety of our rural industries and the general excel
lence of the crops attained no mntter what the con
ditions of the weather may have been during the
growing season.
The agricultural exhibits, however, do not com
pose the whole display by any means. The State
Fair, in fact, is in many respects an exposition of all
the industries of California, and among the exhibits
can be seen evidences of our productive capability
in all lines of work from machinery to fine art. This
tendency toward making at Sacramento something
like a universal display of the industry, ingenuity and
skill of our home workers is a growing one; and
in quite a number of lines the exhibits this year are
larger in quantity, more diverse in nature and better
in quality than ever beiore.
California having been found to be better fitted
for the breeding of fine horses than any other part
of the United States, and probably of the world, and
the tastes of many of our most enterprising mil
lionaires having run in the direction of horse breed
ing, that industry has become one of the most nota
ble of the State; and, as a consequence, racing is
one of the chief features of all our fairs. At Sacra
mento that feature will be particularly prominent this
year, and the new rules and regulations which have
been adopted for the racing events assure results
that will be more than ever gratifying both to horse
men and to the general public.
All the fairs to be held in California this fall have
a special importance from the fact that the time is
at hand when our people must begin preparations
for making an adequate display of the products of
the State at the Paris Exposition in 1900. It is now
certain that the Eastern States are going to enter
the competition seriously and endeavor to eclipse the
world. It is the intention to make at Paris a dis
play which will show that the United States are the
greatest industrial nation on earth, and in carrying
out that intention California will be expected to do
her share.
As the exhibits must be in place when the expo
sition opens in the spring of 1000, the rural display
must be made up from the crop of next year. Con
sequently the fairs of this year afford something like
a rehearsal from which we can learn where the State
can get its finest articles for the coming competition
with the world. Of all the fairs that at Sacramento
will be the most complete and therefore itÃ exhibits
should be well studied by all who are interested in
our advancing welfare.
A THOROUGHFARE COMPETITION.
ONCE more the capitalists of San Francisco
have united to accomplish a work of great
magnitude, designed to achieve far-reaching
benefits not only for the city, but for the State. The
new movement is an outcome of that which has car
ried the Valley road forward to rapid success, and
will extend the advantages of that road to the people
by connecting it with a great transcontinental system
of railways, thus affording California industries the
benefits of a competing route to all parts of the East.
Rumors of the proposed enterprise have been cur
rent for some time, and reports more or less vague
concerning it have been published in several papers
of the city, but The Call of yesterday was the first
to give an authentic statement of the facts. The
enterprise, which is to consist of the construction of
a line of railway southward from Bakersfield over
the Tejon Pass to a point where it can make con
nection with Eastern lines, has been undertaken by
a company of capitalists and business men, all of this
city. Articles of incorporation are already drawn up
and the work will be pushed forward with as much
energy as that so conspicuously shuwn in the con
struction of the Valley road.
The accomplishment of a competing thoroughfare
across the continent within a time so comparatively
short as that which will have elapsed from the date
when Mr. Claus Spreckels accepted leadership in the
movement for building the Valley road to that which
will mark the completion of the enterprise will be
one of the most notable industrial accomplishments
of the century. It is but a short time ago that the
Southern Pacific monopoly regarded its control of
California as something which could not be shaken
off. The builders of the road down the San Joaquin
showed that this confidence was ill founded, and now
comes a new enterprise which will break the mo
nopoly altogether.
It will be in vain that the Southern Pacific boasts
of the passage of the funding bill for which it has
forght so hard. The competing road will destroy
its power of monopoly, and it will no longer be able
to fix freight rates at all the traffic will bear. The
enterprise of our business men in railroad building
haÂ« emancipated the city and the State far more com
pletely than the politicians could have done, even
had they fulfilled all the pledges they ever made.
The monopoly is dead. Our industries are free and
the prosperity of the State is now better assured than
ever before in its history.
It is not pleasing to read that teamsters and pack
ers, who were as indispensable as soldiers at Santi
ago, have been left there stranded. Uncle Sam
should send for them and pay them for the suffer
ing to which the stupidity of some official has sub
jected them. Also, he should direct a few personal
'â -'marks toward the official in question.
There are indications that if all the French officials
guilty of crime in establishing the guilt of Dreyfus
were to follow the example of Colonel Henry, who
had the grace to commit suicide, the prisoner would
be tried by an entirely new set and have some show
of fair treatment.
It is to be hoped that Colonel Berry will not carry
out his determination to divide the State. California
is willing to do anything reasonable to oblige the
Colonel, but it does not want to be cut in two merely
because he has been hurt in his feelings.
The returned Klondiker who threw gold out of a
window at Seattle for the fun of seeing the crowd
scramble for it was merely illustrating the old adage
that that sort of a Klondiker and his money are soon
parted.
"I done it with my little telegram," remarks the
managing editor of the Examiner, and he swells to
frightful proportions in contemplation of his prowess
as director-general of the War Department.
There is satisfaction in learning that at least part
of the stories of neglect of soldiers are false. But
what awful liars will be exposed before the end of
the investigation!
Trouble is said to be in store for Premier Sagasta.

Regarded as bumptious, but ,
Whenever there's a nut
That others find too hard to crack,
Why . .
Let them pass It around, and I

I prefer to let my actions tellâ
But, still,
I will

That the world may

Notified that from to-day
It will be well to consider me
When
Big things are to be done
With pen.
Or gun!
I am naturally shy;
I don't like to boast,
But I guess most
Folks'll be willing to admit that T
Am not so
Slow!
I wnuldn"t for the world have it thought

RULES OF THE HOUSE.
"How can I learn the rules of the
House?" asked a newly elected Irish
member of the late Mr. Parnell. "By
breaking them," was the prompt reply of
the Irish leader, who, as Is well known,
spoke from experience on the point. But
few members would care to adopt that
heroic method of obtaining the desired
knowledge, and their task in mastering
the rtiles is rendered all the more dif
ficult by the curious fact that many of
these regulations are unwritten.
Some will be found in the standing or
ders, or permanent rules passed from
time to time by the House to regulate
its own procedure, but those that deal
with etiquette and decorum have not
been officially recorded anywhere, save
in a few quaint and obsolete regulations
to be found in the old issues of the jour
nals of the~Hou.se, or in the minutes of
proceedings during the session. For in
stance, a strange rule for the guidance
of the Speaker is set down under the
15th of February, 1620: "The Speaker Is
not to move his hat until the third con
gee." Propriety of carriage in leaving
the chamber is thus enforced: "Those
who go out of the House in Â«a confused
manner before the Speaker to forfeit
10s." This rule Is dated tne 12th of No
vember, 1840. Again we find that on the
23d of March, 1693. it was ordered: "No
member to take tobacco into the gallery,
or to the table, sitting at committees."
CONFEDERATE RATIONS.
General Shafter. in recounting in a re
port to the President the hardships
through which Ins army passed, said:
"What put my command in its present
condition were the twenty days of the |
campaign when they had nothing but i
meat, bread and coffee, without change of '
clothes, without any shelter whatever, j
and during the period twice as stormy as
it has been since the surrender."
Such a statement makes many of the
Confederate veterans of the Civil War
smile. They can recall that, for the
greater part of the last three years of
their service, they bivouacked, winter and
summer, under the sky. They had no i
tents, and met snow and rain with no !
other shelter than could be constructed
with a blanket and a few fence rails. As i
for a change of clothes, that was a lux
ury rarely enjoyed. And how the starv
ing soldiers at Santiago must have suf
fered on a steady diet of meat, bread and
coffee! In comparison with the luxurious
fare of the Confederates, the Santiago
menu makes a poor show. If General
Shafter had only fed his men on narched i
corn and water every few days he would i
have brought them out of their troubles I
But it is mighty rough on soldiers who I
have to live twenty days on meat, bread
and coffee. The mule meat and corn
dodgers fed to the defenders of Vicksburc
for months in 18fi3 make luxurious fare
compared with what Shatter's men had to
subsist on.â N<^w Orleans Picayune
WAS IT A SPECIAL PROVIDENCE?
Probably Dr. Parkhursfs people do
not feel complimented because light
ning struck their steeple, but they
ought to be thankful that they were hit
by lightning rather than Tammany. In
the latter case there wouldn't be a
stone left standing.â Brooklyn Stand

GOLD-SEEKERS SHOULD
AVOID FROZEN ALASKA
Captain John MeCafferty, ex-Collector
of Customs for Alaska, arrived from
Dawson City yesterday, by way of Seat
tle. He sounds a note of warning to gold
seekers contemplating n trip to that ice
bound territory. His profession being that
of mining engineer and his mission thither
being strictly within the line of his busi
ness, he had unusually good opportunities
for observation.
His summing up of his experience Is
that the gold placer diggings of Alaska
are short lived and that there are no true
fissure veins in that territory, because the
country is too much broken up and be
cause the geological indications are such
as to warrant the conviction that there
is no gold-bearing quartz "in place."
Large broken "deposits" of gold or bo
nanzas may be found there, but they will
be of the nature of pockets and will not
last.
The most surprising opinion expressed
by him is that the present diggings are on
the point of being worked out and tnat
many of them have barely paid expenses.
He aasertÃ also that all the stories told
of Klondikers returning with large sums
of money are not true; that in many in
stances men reported to have arrived in
Seattle wealthy had not a dollar to th- r
names and had to be assisted out of Al
aska by friends or charitable miners. The
reason for the false statements circulated
by certain papers in Seattle and this city
is said to be owing to the greed of the
transportation companies for passengers
and freight. In telling- of his experiences,
Mr. MeCafferty said yesterday:
I am direct from Dawson by way of St.
Michael, Dutch Harbor and Seattle. I
sailed from thla port for the Klondike re
gion on the 12th of March last, taking sev
eral tons of freight over the White Pass
trail to Lake Bennett, and ihence in six
cedar scow boats to Dawson, making the
run In nine days, without accident.
Upon arrival I made an examination of
the conditions surrounding the mineral out
look for the Klondike basin or district and
am now In full accord with the published
opinion of Walter de Varila, mining en
gineer and Deputy United Ptates Geological
and Mineral Surveyor. He pointedly asserts
that "the Klondike is a good place from
which to keep away. While a few men
stumble upon the gold, many waste their
energies and exhaust their means in a vain
endeavor to find gold where there is none.
The Klondike, and by the Klondike Is
meant all the auriferous territory on the
Yukon, Is more of a gamble or speculation
than any other placer country in the world,
because it is so uncertain. It is not a true
placer country, and the gold of the Yukon
interior Is the product of erosion, or of ex

should be baited as often as the bait set
has beenexhausted. Hunters on the prem

There are seven capitals to represent the

In the crevices, gulches or depressions found

the Yukon are too great for the average
man to undertake mining up there. Con
sequently a. man can run through a small
fortune in a short time and if he is not
lucky in his first venture he finds himself
a poor man in the must inhospitable coun
try on earth for a poor man."
Such words from so capable a man as
Mr. de Varila should be considered as a
warning to the general public. I know be
yond reasonable doubt that the deliber
ately misleading accounts published by
such newspapers as the Port-Intelligencer
Of Seattle and the Examiner of San Fran
cisco about the rich Klon.llk^rs who have
returned and are to return Induced thou
sands of brave, earnest men all over the
country to go thereâ sÂ»nrehing fnr a golden
ph.mtom! The managing edltoni of these
sensational newspapers knew that these
stampedes were being starte.l merely to en
rich the outfitters and transportation com
panies. It was the most cruel and heart
less confidence game ever workt-d upon a
confiding people.
While the Klondike discovery developed
into an exceedingly rich find, nevertheless
It Is confined to a small area. That this
may be understood, I say that out of the
1700 or ISoO claims worked in the Klondike
district not over forty on El Dorado and
twenty on Bonanza paid one cent beyond
the working expenses. Fancy, therefore, the
vast amount of capital lost in working
claims which neither paid nor turned out a
single color. The Klondike discovery has
cost the general public not less than $?.">,
000,(00, while the gold dust gathered there
from up to date, will scarcely exceed $:>,
000,000. Somebody, therefore, has been hurt
to the extent of J70,C00,000.
Notwithstanding all statements to the
contrary, the eyes have been picked out of
not only the Klondike basin, but also out
of every district in both Alaska and the
Northwest Territory. The country Is far
too broken for quartz veins, and therefore,
as there is neither farming nor grazing
land in the Territory there Is nothing to fall
back upon. When I left Ilawson, wildcat
claims and claims that had been worked out
were selling from 25 cents up.
As one Instance of the notorious misrep
resentation of the Seattle papers I will
mention the case of a man who came from
Dawson to Seattle penniless, yet who
brought with him, according to the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer, J12.000 in gold dust. I
happened t I know the man, and know that
he did not have a cent. With some others
I made up a purse, bought a suit of clothes
for him and paid his fare from Seattle.
Another man of my acquaintance who had
not a dollar was reputed by the same paper
to be worth JfiO.non.
I have sef men crying like babies be
cause they had sold their homes to raise
the ir.euns with which to get to Dawson and
â were stranded there. They were ashamed
and afraid to go home, because they had
no assurance of being employed when they
got there.

A RULE IN EUCHREâ W. F., City.
The law of euchre is that at a four-hand
ed game if a player has a very strong
hand he may play alone â that is, play
single-handed against his two adver
saries. When a player announces that he
will play alone, his partner cannot ob
ject, but must place his cards, however
good they may be, face downward on the
table, and leave himself in the hands of
his partner. A player can play alone
when he or his partner orders up; or when
his partner assists; or, in the case of the
dealer, when he takes up the trump. A
player may also play alone when he
makes the trump, but not when the ad
versary orders up, or assists or makes the
trump. On the subject of scoring the law
Is that if a lone player wins all the tricks
he scores four. If he wins three he scores
one. If he fails to win three tricks the
adversaries score two.
In the case cited in the communication
it appears that the adversary ordered up,
consequently the player could not go it
alone, and further was not entitled to
four points.
ST. SWITHUNâ Mrs. S. A. It, Corn
wall, Cal. There is an old saying to the
effect that if it rains on St. Swithun's (or
Swithin) day there will be rain for forty
days. The 15th of July is given as the
saint's day. St. Swithun was an English
ecclesiastic of the ninth century, who was
chaplain to King Egbert ar ' tutor to his
son Ethelwulf; died 862. When Ethel -
wulf came to the throne Swithun held the
office of Chancellor. In Â£."2 he was creat
ed Bishop of Winchester. Accounts of
him are almost wholly legendary- Ac
cording to William of Malmesbury he was
"a rich treasury of all virtues, and those
in which he took most delight were hu
mility and charity to the poor." He was
buried, according to his own orders, not
in the church, but in the churchyard of
Winchester, that the sweet rain of heaven
might fall upon his grave. A century later
he was canonized, and, according to
legend, the monks who exhumed his re
mains to deposit them in Winchester Cath
edral July 1$ were delayed by violent rains
without intermission for forty days,
whence arose the belief that if it Vains on
St. Swithin's day it will continue for time
stated. A Scotch rhyme says:
St. Swithin's day, git ye do rain, for forty days
it will remain;
St. Swithin'B day, and ye be fair, for forty dayi
will rain nae malr.

UNHAPPY PLIGHT OF THE ERST
WHILE CZAR.
Maguire's Supporters Have Com
bined to Freeze the Whisper
ing Boss Out of Local
Politics.
To-morrow "Whispering" Gavin Mc-
Nab, the erstwhile reformer and politi
cal boss, will make a last despairing
effort to retain control of the local De
mocracy. Having been stripped of
whatever limited power he may have
had in the State organization, he now
finds himself confronted with a situa
tion that bids fair. to reduce him to the
ranks in the party organization of
which he has held himself to be the
dictator.
The scene of the struggle is to be the j
meeting of the Democratic City and
County Committee, otherwise known
as the committee of one hundred. His
opponents will be James G. Maguire, j
the Pinto Populist-Sliver Republican- j
Democratic nominee for Governor; j
Mayor Phelan and the Clan Gallagher.
11" he wins he will have control of the
governing body of the local Democ- j
mid he can then revenge himself
for the slight that was put upon him
when he and his blend Max Popper
were given the glassy eye by Maguire ;
when the selections for the twenty
members at large of the State Central
Committee were being made. If he
loses he will be relegated to the polit- I
ical scrap heap and the scenes that |
knew him once will know him no more
forever.
It is to be the last stand of the whis- j
perlng boss. His leaders, such as |
Mayor Phelan, Schoolboy Alford, Gould
and the Gallaghers, have deserted his
standard and joined the ranks of the
enemy. Of his erstwhile friends and
nantfl there remains but Max
â r and Sammy Braunhart. Some I
assion is felt for those two gen- }
tlemen, for In the event of defeat they j
will be unable to exclaim, "All is lost ,
save honor." i
The issue on which the McNab and
Maguire forces will do battle is that of
a primary election for the selection of
delegates to the municipal convention.
Maguire and the Gallaghers desire that ;
a primary be held in order to concili- ;
ate the Harney-Rainey forces. Me-
Nab objects to a primary because he
has not enough followers among the
rank and file of the party to secure the j
election of his delegates.
After the late Democratic convention
at Sacramento, at which Maguire and
the other nominees of the Populist |
party were ratified, it was pointed out |
to Magulre that his only chance of j
election was to secure a large Demo
eratlc majority in San Francisco. He
studied the situation and then an- j
nounced to the Gallaghers that he be
lieved it would be necessary to make
peace with the HarneyVÃainey Demo- |
crats as the initial step toward the de- ]
sired and necessary majority. To do j
this he would have to turn down the j
McNab people. This was a task that j
required the exercise of considerable
diplomacy, for the reason that the
aforesaid Democratic convention had j
recognized the McNab organization as j
the only true governing body of the
San Francisco Democracy.
The scheme hit upon was to ignore >
McNab and his supporters in the make
up of the State Central Committee and j
thus prevent the Whispering Boss
from practicing his peculiar political j
tactics on that body. Having accom
(l this it was then agreed that the
influence of the Maguire-Gallaghers
and the State Central Committee j
phould be brought to bear on the com
mittee of one hundred to force it if
possible to direct that a primary be ,
hold for the election of delegates to the ;
municipal convention. If such a scheme
could be carried through it would give
the Harney-Rainey Democrats the op
portunity "they have been waiting for,
as there ia little doubt of their ability
to carry a primary election and secure
the election of their delegates as
against those of the Whispering Boss.
The successful conduct of this plan
would result in carrying out the wishes I
of Maguire and his advisers and at the
Fame time would not be antagonistic to
the implied mandate of the State Con
vention.
The first part of the plan was entirely
â within Maguire's hands and it was car
ried out to the letter. In selecting the
twenty members at large of the State
Central Committee Maguire ignored
McNab and his friends and appointed
only such men as he could depend upon
to stand by himself and the Gallaghers.
McNab is still kicking, but his protests
have been ignored and arrangements
have gone steadily forward In the in
terest of the final and most Important
part of the plan.
A meeting of the committee of one
hundred has been called for to-morrow

ANTI-CIVIL SERVICE.
Meeting of the League Having for
Its Purpose the Abolishment
of the Institution.
The executive committee of the Antl-
Clvll Service Republican State League
held a largely attended meeting 1 at the
secretary's office in the Parrott building
yesterday afternoon. It was decided to
send circulars throughout the State in
relation to civil service and to Invite the
candidates to declare their opinions of
the Fame. It was decided to hold the
nominating convention the last week in
September. A resolution was passed re
gretting that the Republican convention
did not insert an anti-civil service clause
in its platform. Short speeches were
made by Messrs. Mueller, Moore, Ramsey
and other members of the league, pre
dicting the success of the principles of the
anti-civil service movement. Several vet
erans of the Civil War and members of
the league complained that they had been
removed without cause under the Demo
cratic administration on account of being
Republicans, but because of the magnani
mous ruling of President MoKinley they
could not be reinstated, and they bitterly
denounced the entire civil service system
as being a political humbug, a fraud, a
delusion and entirely un-American. The
meetings of the league committees will
be held weekly hereafter.

WILL SHE PROVE A PROPHETESS ?
Mary Linck of the Tivoli Company Takes a
Firm Stand for English Opera.
Time will tell If Mary Linok, the talented contralto of thÂ« Tlvoll
Grand Opera Company, is a prophetess or not.
Miss Linck maintains that English is surely and nuiekly superseding:
Italian in grand cpera, and goes
further in declaring that the time
Is not far distant when only Eng
lish singing artists will tread tha
American operatic stage.
Miss Linck is the /lrst artiste to
make a decided stand for her na
tive tongue. Although, like all
other singers, her greatest desire
!b to appear at the Metropolitan
in New York, still she has refused
many splendid and tempting of
fers because the contract for such
engagements demands that the
artiste sing her role In Italian.
Many other prominent artists,
Miss Linck declares, are in sym
pathy with the English move
ment and, like her, affirm that
opera in Italian is an exploded
idea; prominent among the ar
tists is Mme. Melba, who stands
ready to give grand opera in Eng
lish when the time and the peo
ple shall so demand.
Miss Linck has had a wide Eu
ropean experience and speaks
with the authority of one who
has traveled a great deal, seen
much and carefully observed all.
"In France they sing altogether
iti French," said the talented,
stanch American girl, "in Aus
tria and all the German States in
German; in Russia, in Franoh,
the court language, and also in
Russian, and in England in
English. Only in America they
do not appreciate the beauty of
their own tongue and accept their
music In a foreign language.
"When an American goes to Europe to sing, the people demand that
he or she sfng in the language of the country, and go still further and
exact a perfect command and pronunciation of that language. Tet for
eigners come to us every day and do not even make the attempt to under
stand our language, still less to master it."
MIF3 Linck is a typical American girl and has all the "go," self
possession, witchery and determination for which :he American girl is
famous. She made her operatic debut in Edinburgh, and has played
throughout Italy and in all the largo German and English cities. In Lon
don she did considerable "drawing room" work, and in Italy hobnobbed
with royalty. But all the attention of the foreigners could not win the
American heart of the fascinating contralto whose motto is "America
first," and whose banner bears the standard, "English opera,"
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 0, 1898.
NO HOLIDAY
IN POLITICS
Labor Day Came Too
Near the Primaries.
DALTON'S COURSE CLEAR
WILL NOT RISK ANYTHING TO
GET A NOMINATION.
A Desire for Purity at the Primary
Receives the Approval of
the County Com
mittee.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 5.
Although this Is a legal holiday the
county primaries are too close at hand
to admit of a cessation from labor on the
part of the politicians. All the county
and city offices being closed, gave the
Incumbents and candidates an opportu
nity to lay down their pens and "do poll
tics."
"Doing" politics in Oakland Is a com
bination of "jollying" people along, writ-
Ing communications for publication, play-
Ing nlckel-in-the-slot machines with the
crowd and tacking faces on electric light
poles and country fences. These were
the pastimes in which the candidates in
dulged to-day, and along these lines much
politics was "done." Outside of a few
offices the various struggles for places on
the county ticket are narrowing down
fast.
There is little doubt that Assessor Dal
ton will be given a place on the Repub
lican ticket, although it Is not yet quite
clear how such a result will be achieved.
Mr. Dalton is not positive that he can
secure the delegation from his own ward,
although he is very confident as to his
standing before the county at large.
There is one danger which he Is studying
carefully to avoid. Should he receive the
support of his ward and his name be
submitted to the convention, It is Just
possible that a scheme might be hatched
to prevent his nomination, and this would
of course prevent him from running as
an Independent candidate afterward.
There are those who would like to see
such a scheme prevail, and it is this
knowledge that has kept the Assessor
so long hesitating as to the course he will
pursue.
Although four months must elapse be
fore Oakland will nominate her next
Mayor, and although a county and State
campaign must intervene, these circum
stances do not prevent the ambitious
from already laying their wires. It is
hinted that Councilman H. D. Howe of
East Oakland would like to head the
next municipal Republican ticket, and
one of the Inspired has made the state
ment that Justice Fred Wood has sug
gested to himself that to be successor
to Mayor Thomas would be rather pleas
ant Auditor Snow is already forecasted
as usual, and as usual will probably be
able to get anything he wants.
The many suggestive incidents having
some connection with the water com
panies seem to indicate that the old-time
struggle is by no means dead. Three
times during the present municipal ad
ministration the apparent control of the
powers that be has switched around, with
every indication that the sails are even
now being trimmed to catch a new breeze,
the approach of which has evidently been
forecasted.
Political Oakland cannot but be amused
at the suggestion that a desire for purity
at the primaries should come from the
Fourth ward. At some recent primaries
Mayor Thomas stated that he saw one
person vote three times in five minutes in
the Fourth Ward, and one of the officers
of election admitted confidentially that
one man had voted twice, and conse
quently it is interesting to know that
where such practices were tolerated a
few weeks ago reform is now sought. At
the suggestion of District Attorney Snook
the county committee has agreed to havo
two watchers, named by the various fac
tions, to look out for their Interests at the
primaries. This suggestion is more
strange in that the only factions to com
pete at the polls in the Fourth Ward are
those represented by Mr. Snook and Mr.
Church, who have for ten years done very
successful politics together. When Mr.
Snook made the suggestion Committee
man Church Inquired if he made it as
representing the District Attorney's of
fice, to which Snook replied that he mere
ly did it as a citizen. This brought from
Church the reply that he merely asked
Mr. Snook the question "as a citizen."
Evidently wurm times are developing in
the fighting Fourth.
Laguna Democratic Club.
A -well-attended meeting of the Lagima
Democratic Club was held laat night In
Swiss Hall, on the corner of Fell and
Franklin streets. Arrangements were
made for taking part in a general meeting
of the Democrats of the Thirty-seventh
District next Monday night in Mowry'g
Hall.
"A MARRIAGE OF
CONVENIENCE"
Henry Miller Presents a
Delightful Comedy.
"THE FIRST BORN" REVIVED
"LOSTâ HOURS" AT THE
. COLUMBIA.
"Shall We Forgive Her" a Success at
â Alhamhra, Comedy
and Orpheum Playing to
"Good Houses.
"A Marriage of Convenience," a four
act "comedy of manners," was presented
at the Baldwin last night by Henry Miller
and the Frohman company to a very fair
house. It is one of those subdued,
smooth-running plays which pleases
without exciting and accomplishes the ob
ject of the players without the necessity
of hysterical applause. In fact, the audi
ence seems to enter into the manner and
method of these mimics of the people of
another age and appear to be concerned
lest they become too demonstrative in
their appreciation of the art of the au
thor and actor.
The scenes of "A Marriage of Conveni
ence" are laid in Paris in the time of
Louis XV among the most polite and
courtly people of any age, and we are
shown Mr. Miller in the guise of a hus
band (Comte de Candale) who neither
loves nor knows his wife and whose
ideas of the proprieties are in harmony
with that peculiar epoch. A persistent
suitor of the Comtesse and a flery old
uncle of the Comte from the provinces
assist in complicating matters to a point
where a separation is agreed upon three
days after the wedding, and the husband
then discovers that he Ib in love with his
wife and possesses her affection, after
which he fights a duel and happiness
comes into the castle.
The part assumed by Mr. Miller is per
fectly suited to him,- and his portrayal
thereof is something the lovers of high
comedy can thoroughly appreciate. As
the careless, courtly gentleman of many
amours he is all that could be desired.
Miss Mabel Bert as the Comtesse plays
a trying part in a most delightful man
ner, and Miss Margaret Dale presents the
ideal French handmaid. Charles R.
Welles as the Chevalier, hopelessly in
love with the Comtesso, has a part well
suited to his abilities, while Arthur El
liott as the choleric uncle, who finally
brings about a happy solution of the mar
riage puzzle, offers an able, character
istic and highly entertaining study.
The gowning of the Comtesse, the cos
tumes of the gentlemen and the stage
settings were magnificent, everything
combining to make a finished and charm-
Ing production.
Monday night next will see the return
to the Baldwin Theater of Modjeska in
a revival of the successes which have
charmed the public and placed her name
at the head of the list of English-speak
ing actresses. She will also present to
us during her engagement a most elab
orate and characteristic production of
Shakespeare's "Antony and Cleopatra,"
which has been in preparation for a long
time, and owing to its magnitude will
not be ready until her second week. Her
repertoire for the first week is us fol
lows: Monday and Thursday, "Mary Stu
art"; Tuesday, "Magda"; Wednesday and
Saturday nights "Macbeth"; Friday, "Ca
mille," and at the Saturday matinee
"As You Like It." Among the many
prominent members of her supporting
company are Charles D. Herman, Lester
Lonergan, John A. Lane, Mark Fenton,
Wadsworth Harris, Anna Proctor, Mrs.
H. K. Berg-ant and others.
The Alcazar.
The spell of the mascotâ the little child's
shoe that hangs on the dusty wall of the
Alcazar Theaterâ has again cast Its in
fluence over "The First Born," which was
presented last evening after an absence
of many months. Francis Powers' Chi
nese play is well known in this city,
having been produced here one hundred
times, and comment upon the piece Is un
necessary. It is one of those quaint little
tragedies that the people never seem to
grow tired of, and the theater was filled
to the doors last evening. It was preceded
by Nat C. Goodwin's farce "Turned L'p,"
which, true to its name, places the char
acters in the most amusing situations
and keeps the audience In a roar of laugh
ter all of the time. There were over a
dozen people "Turned Up," and each con
tributed his or her share of fun.
But it waa "The First Born" that the.
people went to see, and the manifesta
tion of appreciation showed that it has
lost nothing by a change in some of tne
artists. The character of Loaey Tsing,
the slave girl, was taken by Miss Gert
rude Tldball, who carries her lines in the
same vein as May Buckley, her predeces
sor In that paft. The character of Chan
Wan, the deserted husband and father of
little Chan Toy, the first born, was as
sumed by Ernest Hastings, who entered
as much into the spirit of the piece as the
author, Powers. During the first act
Hastings introduced a small feature not
In the play by cutting his wrist with
his highbinder knife wnile carrying his
murdered boy from the house of his mor
tal enemy, Man Low Yek. The injury
was not serious. For a short part, that
of Cho Pow, the nurse (Miss Marie
Howe), was well rendered. George Os
borne, as Dr. Pow Len. the Chinese phy
sician, portrayed all that is In the char
acter. All or the other artists showed
care and study in their lines. One of the
most striking features of the piece is the
music, produced by Lee Johnson, which,
while not strictly Chinese, is a fair pres
entation of the Oriental conception of the
melodious. It is believed that "The First
Born" will continue to draw well.
At the Columbia.
The closing week of the Frawley Com
pany's engagement at the Columbia The
ater commenced last night with a revi
val of the popular comedy "Lostâ 24
Hours." The audience was not so large
as it ought to have been, and was besides
cold ana unsympathetic. Notwithstand
ing these drawbacks the company gave
an artistic performance. Edward M. Bell
and Louis Payne as the Swift brothers
were particularly good. Sam Edwards
made his reappearance after his illness,
and was cordially received. Miss Lucille
La Verne also made her bow for tho
first time as a regular member of the
company, and played the part of the
sporty Mrs. Dacre admirably.
The Orpheum.
Several scores of people who came late
were obliged to go away from the doors
of the Orpheum last night, for all the
available seats In the house were filled
shortly after the rise of the curtain. There
is a splendid bill this week, the favorites
of last week and the new members mak
ing a strong and harmonious combination.
Slgnor Abramoff and the Pasqualls vere
called before the curtain three times for
their excellent singing of the prison scene
from "Faust." Charles Baron kept the
spectators bubbling with merriment with
his lion dogs. Barney Fagan and Henri
etta Byron were as crisp as ever and
Charles T. Aldrich was as unique and as
side-splitting as he was last week. Irene
Franklin, petite soubrette, has a pleasing
voice and a quiet, graceful manner. Felix
Morris, with his charming comedy "A
Game of Cards," made a hit with one of
the best bits of character acting seen In
thiÃ city for many a day. Favor and Sin
clair, In "The Maguires," were irresist
ibly funny and are at the top of their
class. The seven Tow-Zoo-In Arabs gave
some clever acrobatic feats, and the
American biograph delighted the specta
tors as the wind-up of an evening of first
class entertainment.
Morosco's.
"Shall We Forgive Her?" is the best
thing the Grand Opera-house has given
Its patrons In months. It was well staged
and particularly well played. Every one
of the characters was fittingly portrayed
and toward the end Miss Grace Addlson
did so well that she was hissed off the
stage for her clever acting of the part of
Joanna. As Nellie West, Miss Lillian
Elliot was very entertaining, while Leslie
Morosco as Reggie "Walton made a capital
lover. In fact, tne whole cast Is good, and
"Shall We Forgave Her?" should crowd
the Grand Opera-house nightly.
There will be a special holiday matinee
performance of this play on Friday next
(Admission day).
The Tivoli.
Verdi's immortal "Rigoletto" opened
the sixth week of the grand opera sea
son at the Tivoli last night before a large
and enthusiastic audience.
Sig. Maurice de Vries in the title role
was certainly the drawing card. Mr. de
Vries' Rigoletto has a world-wide repu
tation, and ho is considered one of the
best living translators of this difficult
part. His voice and artistic abilities are
admirably suited to give a character
study of this kind, and he must have felt
proud when he perceived how much his
art was appreciated by the audience.
Miss Lichter wtis charming, as usual,
and she was received very cordially. Mag
dalena was sung by Miss Mary Linck
with great fervor, and her conception of
this part was extremely pleasing. Her
contralto has a very pathetic ring, and
she can rise in some scenes to absolute
greatness.
Miss Merrill sang the small part of Gi
ovanna with good success. She Is a na
tive of this city, and it seems that she
will have a bright future before her aa
an opera singer.
Sig. Wanrell's Sparafueile was sung
ver> creditably, and received due appre
ciation. It is regrettable, however, that
even the polyglots cannot understand
him in his articulation of the Italian lan
guage. Mr. Rhys Thomas, as the Duke
of Mantua, sang with his usual effort
to please and succeeded very well. It was
his best performance in grand opera thus
far.
To-night "iAicretia Borgia" will be giv
en, with Miss Marie Urandis in the title
role, and Mr. William Pruette as the
Duke of Ferrara. Gennaro lies in the
hands of Sig. Zerni.
Comedy Theater.
"The Leading Man," as presented by the
Pacheco Ideal Comic Opera Company, at
the Comedy Theater, is a very enjoyable
affair. It is much improved from the
first night's production, and is receiving
Its share of patronage. Matinees Wednes
day and Saturday.
The Alhambra.
The bill at the Alhambra appears to
have caught the public fancy. There were
crowded houses on Sunday and last night.
The presentation of the various acts now
goes smoothly. The same bill holds dur
ing the week.
Chutes Theater.
The reproduction of the Spanish bull
fight in nine pcenes was startlingly realis
tic at the Chutes last evening. From the
driving of the bulls into the inclosure to
the final death of the tortured animal
every phase of the brutal sport was faith
fully depicted and heartily hissed. Noth
ing like it has ever been seen in America.
The new bill was very good, and Pearl
Haight, the "American Anna Held," was
cordially greeted. She has the form and
face of the French milk bather, and imi
tates her in a thoroughly satisfactory
manner. Thomas K. Ryan is a funny ex
temporaneous singer, and Eusapla, fire
dancer, has some novel and pleasing ef
fects. Mac Tunison, soprano, was warmly
received, and the three De Novas, aerial
performers, and Conlon and Ryder, acro
batic comedians, repeated their hits of
last week. In the zoo a "laughing jack
ass" and carpet snakp from Australia are
novelties. The daily matinees in the Free
Theater are always well attended.
Perkins Republican Club.
The Perkins Republican Club of the
Forty-fourth Assembly District met last
evening and elected officers for the com
ing campaign. The Perkins club is the
oldest Republican club in the northern
section of this city, and this is the third
campaign in which the members have
taken active part. The following officers
were elected: President, George Faber'
first vice president, A. Suarez; second
vice president, Charles Bacz; secretary,
Ed WHlman; treasurer, R. Garcia; ser
geant at arms, F. Whalen; executive
committeeâ George Strohl. A. Denegir, H.
fllrich, I. Samuels, F. Martinell: cam
paign committeeâ L. Strohl, H. Nellman,
F. Rodriguez, William Fey, F. Fregualia.

THREE REGIMENTS TO
BE SENT TO HONOLULU
WASHINGTON, Sept. 5.â It was stated at the War Depart
ment to-day that nothing definite had been determined as to the
movement of troops now at San Francisco to Manila, which depended
upon information which was expected to be received from General
Merritt as to the necessity for such troops. Probably three regi
ments would be sent to Honolulu if they did not go to Manila. If
General Merriam, on his return, reported that there was good camp
ing ground at Honolulu, the troops would be sent there if not need
ed at Manila.

Young Ladies.
IN A CONSTABLE'S CHARGE
ACCUSED OF HAVING CAUSED A
FOREST FIRE.
Carelessness of Themselves and a
Gentleman Said to Have Re

of Property.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, Sept. s.â Walter Church,
son of George E. Church, a prominent
attorney, and two of his lady friends-
Miss Albertson and Miss Mollie Jollyâ
who had been camping near Sampson
Flats in Madera County, will have to
answer to a charge of having caused a
forest fire and the destruction of con
siderable property. The trio were ar
rested in this city this morning by
Constable Bigelow of O'Neals, upon
complaint sworn out by a farmer named
McCape, whose property was destroyed.
The young people had been camping,
Miss Albertson's aunt being with them
up to several days ago as chaperon for
the young ladies. The three extended
their stay after her departure, how
ever, and did not return until Saturday
morning. The following day an officer
arrived with a warrant for their arrest
and they were greatly surprised. The
young ladies in particular were loud
!n their protests, which were of no avail
with the constable. This morning they
were taken to O'Neals by the officer.
Just before leaving their camp they
built a fire to cook their breakfast and
It is alleged that they carelessly left it
burning. The adjacent brush cdtbght
and soon the fire was raging in the
timber lands. After a great deal of
hard fighting it was extinguished.
A great many similar fires have been
started this year by the carelessness
of campers and the residents of the
vicinity are determined to make an ex
ample of the trio arrested to-day. The
circumstances are such as give the
young man and his lady friends a great
deal of anxiety and unpleasant promi
nence.
GENERAL STERNBERG
VISITS CAMP WIKOFF
The Head of the Medical Department
Considers the Conditions
There Satisfactory.
CAMP WIKOFF, MONTAUK POINT,
N. V., Sept. s.â Surgeon General Stern
berg arrived here to-day from Washing
ton to see for himself how this camp
looked ar .1 to inquire into the sanitary
arrangements. General Sternberg to
night stated that he had visited the hos
pitals ani that he had found their condi
tion excellent. He considered that the
camp site had been well chosen. He was
gratlfiec b> all he had seen. He paid he
had not tome on a special mission but
shn->ly on an ordinary inspection. When
he returns tr. Washington he win make
a verbal report to Secretary Alger.
General Shafter came out of the deten
tion camp to-day. He is somewhat im
proved in health. He said that Camp
Wlkoft would be continued for some time,
and although many of the troops here
were to be Kent away, the camp would be
f.M.-rl up with barracks lor the accommo
dation of several thousand men during
ihi' inclement weather. Advices from
"Washington to-day say that 42<k) recruits
will lie sent from Southern posts' to join

CHAPLAIN M'INTYRE
TO BE COURT-MARTIALED
For His Talk He Is Charged With
Conduct Unbecoming an
Officer.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 5.-Ever since the
printed reports of the sensational utter
ances of the naval chaplain, Joseph P.
Mclntyre. reached the Navy Department,
the officials have been making a quiet in
quiry into the accuracy of the newspaper
publications. The chaplain, who was at
tached to the Oregon and was on board
when the battle of July 3 was fought,
was accredited with some savage criti
cism of Admiral Sampson, Captain Evans
and various other officers of the Ameri
can fleet, insisting that to the officers and
men of the Oregon alone belonged the
victory achieved over the Spanish squad
ron, lie was particularly severe on Cap
tain Evans, whom he charged with cow
ardice.
Apparently the Navy Department has
now satisfied Itself that the chaplain
really uttered the language ascribed to
him, for it has ordered his trial by court
martial on charges of conduct tending to
the prejudice of good order and discipline
and conduct unbecoming an officer. The
chaplain is now on leave of absence in
Denver.

SYDNEY, N. S. W., Sept. s.â The area
sown to wheat In New South Wales Is
shown by complete reports to be 1,500,000
acres, which Is an Increase o/ 26 per cent

MOBILE, Ala., Sept. s.â The Mobile
Board of Health to-day advised that
the State of Alabama declare a quar
antine against persons and baggage
from New Orleans until the suspicious
cases there are pronounced upon.
State Health Officer Saunders ad
vised Governor Johnson, who is now
lere, to the same' effect, and the Gov-
ernor this afternoon issued a proclama
tion declaring the quarantine as sug
gested. ,
JACKSON, Miss., Sept. s.â The city
of Jackson has established a strict
quarantine on all classes of traffic
against New Orleans. No trains on the
Illinois Central road are allowed to
stop within the city limits. The suspi
cious fever case reported from the Bear
Creek neighborhood, in Copiah County,
has been investigated and found to be
of a malarial type. One suspicious case
is reported at Meridan and is being in
vestigated.
NEW ORLEANS. Sept. s.â There was
a conference held herj between the offi
cials of the Board of Health, attending
physicians and Dr. Carter of the United
States Hospital Service, with respect to
the alleged cases of yellow fever in
New Orleans. The cases were viewed
by the experts. Dr. Carter reserved his
opinion until to-morrow, hence no an
nouncement was made as to whether
the trouble is yellow fever or not.
MR. AND MRS. ALGER
CALL ON MR. SHERMAN
It Is Said That the Secretary of War
Is Trying to Stop the Ex-
Secretary's Talk.
NEW YORK, Sept. s.â The Washington
correspondent of the Herald says: Both
Secretary Alger and former Secretary
Sherman protest that there is no ill feel
ing between .them on account of General
Miles, and they still maintain cordial
Sersonal relations, as was illustrated by
ecretary and Mrs. Alger making a social
call on Mr. Sherman this morning.
The fact that Secretary Alger had
called on Mr. Sherman became generally
known in Washington to-night, and was
the subject of much discussion. It was
Interpreted in some quarters to signify
that Secretary Alger wanted to placate
Mr. Sherman, and visited him for the pur
pose of inducing him to abstain from any
further criticism of the administration
and the War Department. I have good
authority for the statement, however,
that there was little if any discussion of
War Department matters.

schooner W. H. Talbot arrived to-day,
nineteen days from St. Michael. Captain
Benneche reports that up to the day of
his sailing no news of the wreck of the
imprisoned whaling fleet had reached St.
Michael. Boats from Kotzebue Sound
were arriving daily, and news of disaster
to the fl"ot would reach Kotzebue Sound
first; consequently he places no reliabil
ity in the report of the loss of the whal
ers.

Rush for Claims at Los
Angeles..
HUNDREDS OF EAGER MEN
SEEK TO OBTAIN HOMES ON THE
OVERLAP TRACT.
Southern Pacific Believed to Have
Employed Crowds of Laborers
to Take Up Homesteads
for the Company.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Sept. s.â The Gov
ernment Land Office here is besieged by
a large crowd of people who desire to
file on land recently lapsed to the
United States under a decision of the
Federal court in this city. This land,
which comprises over 1,000,000 acres, a
great portion of which is heavily cov
ered by timber, extends for five miles
on each side of the branch line of the
Southern Pacific Railroad, paralleling
it for a distance of thirty miles and
running from a point on the Los Ange
les County line into Riverside County.
The land is designated as the "South
ern Pacific overlapped branch line
land." The railway's title thereto was
found to conflict with a prior grant to
the Atlantic an Pacific. It is expected
that a great many conflicts will arise
between rival claimants. The pur
chaser from the Southern Pacific Rail
road will, however, receive protection
at the hands of the United States under
the act of March 3, 1887.
Late this evening over 200 men were
in line waiting to file their applications
for land upon the opening of the office
at 9 o'clock to-morrow morning, and it
is expected that the number will be in
creased to at least 500 before that hour.
It is strongly suspected that the rail
road company has employed a large
number of men to take up a great por
tion of the most desirable land. Many
of the men in line are being relieved in
relays every four or five hours by
others who come, apparently, in charge
of parties known to be identified with
the railroad interests. The officers of
the land ol^ce will, they say, use every
effort on their part to prevent fraud
and -u-e prepared to put each applicant
through a searching examination before
filing his papers.
SNUG LITTLE SUMS FOR
DEWEY AND SAMPSON
What They and Their Subordinates
Will Get for Destroying the
Spanish Fleets.
NEW YORK, Sept. 5.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: From the
official report of Admiral Montejo,
commanding the Spanish fleet sunk at
Manila, there were 1875 persons on
board the ships under his command.
The Spanish fleet was of inferior force
to the American squadron, and Rear
Admiral Dewey's men will therefore
only get $100 for each person.
It is estimated that the aggregate
amount due the Asiatic fleet as a result
of the destruction of the Spanish force
amounts to #87,500, which Congress will
be asked to appropriate during the
coming session. One-twentieth of this
sum belongs to Rear Admiral Dewey,
as commander-in-chief, and he will
therefore be $9375 richer than he was
before the war.
Rear Admiral Sampson has realized
a snug little fortune as a result of the
war. . As commander-in-chief of the
North Atlantic fleet he will get one
twentieth of every prize taken in North
Atlantic waters and one-twentieth of
the head money allowed for vessels de
stroyed off Santiago and In Cuban
ports. It is estimated that he will
finally receive about $4000 as his , share
of the prize money.
In determining the amount of head
money due the officers and men it will
be necessary for the department to de
cide whether the vessels destroyed were
inferior or .-.; superior to their antago
nists. If the latter, the Americans will
be entitled to $200 for each person on
board the enemy's vessels. Of course,
this will swell the amount of prize
money due the rear admiral. â 
It is estimated that, including the
Mercedes, sunk by the Massachusetts
at the mouth of the harbor of Sant
tiago, there were 2492 persons on board
the Spanish fleet destroyed by Rear
Admiral Sampson's command, which
was superior to > the enemy, and the
amount of head money due the fleet will
consequently aggregate $249,200.

SPANISH STATESMEN
DISCUSS PEACE TREATY
Secret Session of the Chambers to
Draft a Law to Renounce Sov
ereignty Over Colonies.
MADRID. Sept. s.â The Chambers aa
sembled here to-day. At the opening 1 of
the Senate the Secretary read a letter
from Senor Rodriguez, Senator from
Porto Rico, refusing to obey the summons
to attend.
The Premier, Senor Sagasta, arrayed in
the insignia of his office, ascended the
tribune and read a decree authorizing
the Government to present to the Cham
ber a draft of a law empowering the
Ministers to renounce sovereignty over
the colonies, in conformity with the stip
ulations of the peace preliminaries be
tween the United States and Spain. The
President of the Senate proposed a secret
discussion of the decree, and, despite the
protests of some Senators, ordered that
the galleries be cleared. This was done,
amid loud murmurs of disapproval.
Those who had expected sensational
scenes on the reopeninp of the Chambers
were disappointed. The general public
seems indifferent. The people at large are
apparently convinced that Spain must ac
cede to whatever the United States de
mands.
DEMANDS THAT HE
BE TRIED FOR MURDER
Unusual Request of a Negro Whom
the Officials of Napa Re
fuse to Arrest.
NAPA, Sept. s.â John Clemens, the ne
gro accused of murder by A. F. Allen on
the latter* deathbed, is at large. The
officers refused to arrest him, because
they could not get sufficient corrobora
tion to Allen's statement. Clemens now
demands to be arrested and tried for
murder. He says he is innocent and can
prove it, but unless he is given the op
portunity to do so people will always be
lieve he was guilty. He saya he is going
to call on Judge Ham of the Superior
Court to-morrow and have him order his
arrest. He will also demand of the Dis
trict Attorney that he be prosecuted.
The officers have apparently abandoned
the search for the murdererâ for that Al
len was murdered almost every one be
lieves, relying principally upon the con
clusions of the doctors.
Eag-an Elected Sword-Bearer.
DUBLIN, Sept. s.â The Corporation of
Dublin has elected as swordbearer James

SCORES OF LIVES
IMPERILED BY THE
WORK OF A FIEND
fluger Holes Bored io the Bow of
tf)e AlasKa BarK Northern
Light.
Tfye Notorious Mrs. Herman a Stowaway on a
Vessel Which; Barely Escapes Being
SunK at Sea.
BERING STRAIT, June 27.â The
bark Northern Light, Captain Joseph
Whiteside, from San Francisco for Kot
zebue Sound, is safe in port at last, and
her crew and 162 passengers are con
gratulating each other upon having es
caped death at sea through the fiendish
crime of some person or persons in
San Francisco. After the Northern
Light had put to sea her hold began to
fill with water. Despite the efforts of
the crew and passengers at the pumps
the encroaching element gained head
way until it threatened to sink the ves
sel. Â«v r hen at last even the captain and
begun to despair the discovery was
made that the bow of the Northern
Light was honeycombed with auger
holes which had been drilled by some
fiend in human form intent on sinking
the vessel and sending 170 souls to
death in the bosom of the Pacific.
Soon after leaving port the ship was
discovered to be leading badly, and all
hands were called to the pumps. She
was kept afloat by constant pumping
day and night. The anxiety of the
152 passengers aboard can well be im
agined. The passengers were com
pelled to work in relays to relieve the
exhausted crew. The source of the
leak was finally discovered by Chief
Officer George Tilton, the officer who
won fame by his perilous journey to
civilization from the ice-bound whalers
at Point Barrow to seek relief for the
starving sailors. Tilton searched the
hold from stem to stern listening for
the sound of running water. After two
days he was rewarded by locating the
leak in the bow. It was the work of
hours to cut through the massive tim
bers and reach the bow. There a start
ling discovery was made. The bow was
punctured by four auger holes seven
eighths of an inch In dimensions, and
through them the water was rushing in
Streams. Three of these openings were
plugged, but one could not be reached
without cutting away the 'tween deck?,
and was left open, the crew pumping
out the water that entered through this
opening 1 .

NILES BRANCH IS
BEING REBUILT
Will Be Practically a
New Line.
SOUTHERN PACIFIC ALARMED
PBEPARING TO MEET VALLEY
ROAD COMPETITION.
Huntington Already Arranging to
Give Improved Passenger Ser
vice Through the San
Joaquin Valley.
Special Dispatch to jjThe Call.
STOCKTON, Sept. s.â The Southern
Pacific is already making preparations
to give an improved passenger service
through the San Joaquin Valley when
the Valley Road becomes a competing
line from this point over the Point
Richmond route to San Francisco. To
this end the Niles line, which has been
neglected for so many years, and
which has been considered the poorest
makeshift in the entire system, is be
ing overhauled and will be practically
a new line when the Valley Road trains
begin to go through to the bay. The
heaviest rails to be had are now re
placing the old ones, and weak por
tions of the roadbed cm either side of
Niles are being strengthened. Wher
ever possible the curves are being
straightened and the grades reduced.
The work is in progress without dis
turbing the running of trains and must
necessarily be slow, but it is going on
steadily, and by the end of the year
this branch of the system will be prac
tically a new line. Everything indi
cates that the route will be the one

DEATH OF COLONEL
ANDREW SHEEHAN
Made a Vast Fortune in Gambling in
Early Days, but Became Com-
paratively Poor.
: NEW YORK, Sept. ; s.â Colonel Andrew
Sheehan, a veteran of the turf and the
green cloth, died to-day, -; 70 years ;of age.
Forty, years ago he combined politics with
his other : pursuits, and ; wielded v power .1 in
influential circles ' In 1849 ' Sheehan ; has
tened to ; the â  mining fields, wiiere ; . for a
time ;he deftly 'converted to his pockets
the virgin gold which â  miners dug . from
the earth. * He â  invested : his '.winnings â % in

AN ELECTION IN ARKANSAS.
As Usual the Democratic Ticket Has
Been Successful.
LITTLE ROCK, Ark.. Sept. s.âArkan
sas to-day elected a full corps of State of
ficers, 100 members of the lower house of
the Legislature, sixteen State Senators,
local officers in each of the seventy-five
counties and voted on the adoption of two
important constitutional amendments, as
well as the question of the liquor license
In the different counties. The Democratic
State ticket, headed by Dan W. Jonea, la
who pernetrated this outrage. The
holes had been bor d by a mechanic
with a ship auger. He must have un
derstood the trade and taken careful
measurements. The lob was one that
must have required at least an entire
night, for he had to drill through a
six-inch Iron and wood shield and then
through four-inch oak plank.
The Northern Light sailed from San
Francisco on May 12, after a delay of
sixteen hours, caused by a discharged
steward who circulated a report that
there were contraband goods aboard.
A search by customs officers proved
the untruth of the report.
After the vessel had proceeded to sea
a series of strange discoveries were
made in addition to that by Chief Of
ficer Tilton. The chief officer ordered
the men to bring up from the hold and
distribute the life preservers. The first
tar who went rumm^ing among them
suddenly gave a yell as though he had
been bitten by a snake, and rushed
upon deck with "his eyes sticking out
so as you could brush them off with
sticks," as the chief officer expressed
it. Nothing cohei nt could be got from
him, so arming himself with a belay
inf pin and taking a lantern the chief
officer approached the life preservers
ai.d found â only a woman stowaway.
She was brought on deck, and it was
found she was Mrs. Herman, the
woman who deserted her husband and
children to follow to the Klondike C.
W. Bowman, one of *he passengers on
the Alaska, Readers of The Call will
remember she made all sorts of false
representations to Captain TVhiteside,
declaring she was a deserted wife.
When a Call reporter discovered her
identity and learned that she herself
was deserti"" a happy home to follow
a man she loved assistance was denied
her. Then Mrs. Herman succeeded in
stowing herself aboard. There being no
fit accommodations for women other
than those of the captain's wife aboard
the Northern Light, Mrs. Whiteslde
was compelled to take the woman un
der her protection and give her a
stateroom in the after cabin.
Another stowaway made his appear
ance from the fore peak the next dny
and was put at work by the mate af
ter having been given a good meal.
undoubtedly elected, the only doubt being
the size of the Democratic plurality.
The vote on the two constitutional
amendments is in doubt. One of these
provides for the creating by the Legisla
ture, of; a railroad commission, and the
other for the levying of a tax of y 3 mills
for road purposes. /,

WHEAT CROP OF THE COUNTRY.
NEW YORK. Sept. s.â The wheat crop of
189S Is not quite up to promise, according to
the report of the American Agriculturist, which
appears In the issue of September 1. This says
that in a few States it now appears the prom
ise of wheat was not fulfilled in actual grain
by what must seem like a large margin, while
in a number of States the rate of yield was
even greater than indicated on July 1. But
with full allowance for all disappointment, the
fact remains that the crop this year is the
largest on record.
The reported rate of yield in winter wheat
is 14.8 Imshels and In spring wheat \j.i bush
els. The final crop result will appear next
month, but the American Agriculturist says
that It must not mi^s to note that If the present
rate of yield Indicated shall be maintained, the
total roductlon of winter wheat will be rather
under 400,000,000 bushels and spring wheat fully
300,000,000 bushels, subject to modification next
month.

on a moving train to catch a runaway
steed. This morning an experiment of
this nature would undoubtedly have end
ed his life had not some friends on the
Alnmeda narrow gauge pulled him into
a car from the steps by which he was

This morning Mr. Hierllhy was out with
a team, and while in a store at Encinal
Park station his horse ran off. Hierllhy
tried to overtake it, but in vain, and just
at that time the narrow-gauge train came
flying along. Hierllhy. who is about 60
years of a&e, conceived the idea of jump
ing on the train, which was moving swift
ly, and catching his horse. He had never
jumped on or off a train in his life, and
the result of his foolishness was that sev
er"al women as the train passed one of
the streets waved their hands frantically
to the trainmen to stop. On looking off
the platform Hierlihy was seen hanging
the steps in the rear of the last car
and being dragged and jolted over the
Some of his friends rushed to the
I the train and succeeded in pulling
him aboard, somewhat bruised, almost
exhausted and very much the worse for

( >n arriving at Morton-street station
the runaway team was caught and Hier
lihy was able to take charge of it. He
assured his rescuors that it was the most
foolish triik of his life, as he had in all
the years he has lived near the trains
never jumped on or off, and he registered
a vow that lie will never again attempt
to use a flying train to catch a runaway
horse. ____^_________

i it is the oldest church in this city. The
original house of worship was a cloth
tent, in which services were conducted by
Key. S. B. Bell.
The church afterward moved to a pub
lic schoolhouse and later to a building,
I which was erected about 1556, at the
corner of Webster and Sixth streets, and
which cost about J6OyO. Later the build
ing was removed to Broadway and Thir
teenth streets and enlarged to meet the
rc-cjuirements of the growing congrega
tion. It now stands on Thirteenth street,
between Broadway and Franklin, ajid is
known as Armory Haft. The present
handsome structure at Fourteenth and
Franklin streets was built twenty-three
years ago at a cost of $52,000, and was i
dedicated in January, 1576.
Yesterday's services were commemora- j
tivAof the First Protestant communion
eerWce ever held in Oakland, and Dr. R.
F. Coyle preached from the same text,
"And they crucified him," as did the Rev.
S. B. Bell forty-five years ago in the little
tc-nt near the water front. On Wednes
day evening several of the older members
will deliver their addresses. They will
Include the Rev. Samuel H. Wilson, D. D.,
Charles E. Bailey, Mrs. Waisworth and

MUST STAND TRIAL.
Samson to Be Vigorously Prosecuted
for Supplying Camp Barrett
With Tainted Meat.
OAKLAND, Sept. s.â Health Officer J.
P. Dunn could not swear out a warrant
to-day for the arrest of M. M. Samson,
who supplied bad beef to the Eighth Regi
ment at Camp Barrett, this being Labor
day. He will do so to-morrow, and the
affair will be the subject of a thorough
official inquiry.
"I consider it a serious matter to sell
such beef," said Dr. Dunn, "and I shall
devote all my energies to the prosecution
of the man who would thus endanger the
lives of our people. It is evident that tne
particular meat condemned did not pass
through the hands of the Government in
spector, nor was it killed by the Western
Meat Company, for had it been it would
have borne the proper stamp."
Dr. Dunn believes that he has enough
evidence on which to convict and is satis
fied that there will be no trouble about
making Samson pay the penalty.
DIED NEAR SAN PABLO.
John Whelan Wandered Into the
Hills and When Caught Expired.
OAKLAND, Sept. s.â John Whelan died
under peculiar circumstances in the hills
near San Pablo last evening. He hod been
visiting his uncle, Patrick Murphy, and
during the day his mind became affected
and he wandered into the hills. Two men
were Bent after him in a buggy. They
found him.
After he was placed in the vehicle he
gaspi-d and died. The remains were
viewed afterward by the Coroner of Con
tra Costa County and a jury, and were
then sent to this city for interment. Dece
dent's family reside in San Francisco. He
was thirty-five years of age and was
known to have been atflicted with heart
trouble for some time.
His Oratory Was Lost.
OAKLAND, Sept. s.â The Kcv. Barton
Perry of San Leandro Is convinced he is
not a politician and that he understands
little or nothing of their ways. He learned
a lesson last Saturday which furnishes
him matter for conversation and will
probably form the theme of sermons in
the future. He spoke for twenty minutes
un the desirability of holding the Repub
lican convention in that town. At the end
of that time he learned that the matter
was settled favorably In an executive ses
sion of the committeemon.
"If I ever felt like collapsing," said the
pastor, "It was at that moment. All my
oratory, all my promises, and about twen
ty minutes or valuable time wasted, be
cause I didn't know that politicians trans
ncted such Important business in execu
tive session with us on the outside."

THE SAN FR AN CISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, 1898.
HER FATE IN
THE BALANCE
Fears for Safety of the
Geo. F. Manson.
GAMBLERS IN REINSURANCE
TAKE CHANCES ON THE SATE
ARRIVAL OF THE BARK.
Return of the Transport Steamer
Lakme From Honolulu â Pat
Galvln's Steamboat Ven
ture a Failure.
The American bark George F. Manson
is now out 125 days from Sydney, N. S.
W., for this port, and fears are enter
tained for her safety. Among shipping men
she is not given up as lost, but still the
underwriters are paying 30 per cent to
reinsure the hull and cargo. While the
Manson is considerably overdue, still,
other vessels that left Australia about
the same time made unusually long pass
ages. The General Pairchild was 116
days coming from Newcastle, N. S. W.,
and many ships of the British fleet have
taken from ninety to a hundred days cov
ering the distance. Sugar boats from the
islands have taken from twenty-five to
thirty days to get here, and the captains
of the coal and sugar fleet all lay the
blame on "light winds and calms."
The Manson was thoroughly overhauled
and recoppered before she left Sydney, bo
her hull and spars give no cause for anx
iety. She was, however, out in the "great
Maltland storm" that caused so much de
struction on the Australian coast, and
that is what makes the underwriters un
easy. The Manson sailed from Sydney
one day before the British ship Crown of j
India left Newcastle, and the latter was
towed into Sydney dismasted, she havlmr
been caught in that storm.
A great deal of interest is taken in the
fate of the George F. Manson, not only
because Captain P. Crack and his son, P.
Crack Jr., the first mate of the bark, are
well known here, but because nearly all
the reinsurance on her was placed In this
city. An "overdue" affords a good chance
for a gamble, and many a man on
'Change has risked 4loo to win $20 that the
Manson would arrive in safety. It can j
readily be understood that underwriters |
who are interested in the "overdues" are
only too willing to get rid of the risk by
paying a premium on the insured rate to
those who are wining to take the chances.
The premium varies with the chances of
the vessel turning up. Thus, on the
French bark Pierre Cornellle, from San
Francisco for Cape Town, South Africa,
90 per cent reinsurance was paid. Tnis
bark was posted at Lloyd's as "missing"
a few days ago, and the gamblers had to
pay up.
Lloyds never posts a vessel as missing
until a committee Is thoroughly satisfied
that her case is hop^ioss and until the
owner is of the same opinion. Before post
ing, a notice is put up, and kept up for
a week, inviting information concerning
the vessel. If this elicits no news the
committee at its next meeting votes the
ship as "missing" and a notice Is posted
accordingly. All insurance and reinsur
ance matters are then settled. Incident
ally "Posted at Lloyds as missing" con
stitutes a legal death certificate for any
one on board the missing ship.
Reinsurance on the Manson will, there
fore, probably be greatly increased be
fore there Is any talk of "posting" her
as "missing." She is an old but stout
vessel. She was built at Bath, Me., in
1875, and is 1418 tons gross burden, 206.1
feet long, 39.2 broad and 23.9 feet deep.
The steamer Lakme arrived from Hono
lulu yesterday. She was a long time mak
ing the run here. Captain Klitgard lay
ing the blame on the strong northeast
winds encountered during the passage.
She brought up a few passengers and 100
tons of sugar and -too bunches of
bananas. The work or removing the
standees used by the soldiers was begun
as soon as the vessel chirked. The deck
house will remain, however, as it will
be useful in the coast trade into which
the Lakme will be put. Captain Klitgard
of the Lakme was a great favorite with
the volunteers he took to Honolulu, and
he brought back with him a very hand
some testimonial signed by the officers.
There was a concert and a couple of
four round settos on the upper deck every
night and that helped to pass the long
evenings in the tropics. Crossing the
tropic old Neptune paid the Lakme a visit
and ten of the soldier bcJ's who had
never been to sea befrtr^ were bathed
and shaved much to the delight of their
companions.
Captain Klitgard of the Lakme -was for
merly master of the schooner Eva. When
in that vessel he made the round trip
to Mahukona and return in twenty-six
days, and a round trip to Puget Sound
and back with lumber in twenty-one
days. These were both record breakerÃ.
He will not make- many fast voyages in
his present command, however, as the
Lakme was not built for speed. The ves
sel Is a splendid carrier, a magnificent
sea boat and as well appointed a steamer
as goes out of this port, but she Is not
an "ocean greyhound."
The river steamer Mary Ellen Galvin
is still tied up at Fremont street wharf,
and the chances are that she will never
see the Yukon River. For weeks Pat Gal
vin kept the steamer Cleveland and her
load of merchandise tied up at Harrison
street wharf In the hopes that his river
steamer could be fixed up so that he |
would have something to take him from I
I St. Michael to Dawson, but the Mary !
i Ellen Galvin was a failure, and he had
to go without her. As the Mary Ellen
Galvin cost him in the neighborhood of
$35,000, Galvin's venture into steamboat
ing cannot be called a success. He fully
expects to find a quarter of a million .
awaiting him, as his share of the prod
ucts of his mines, on his arrival at Daw
son so the loss of $40,000 or $50,000 in a
steamboat venture does not worry him
very much.
George Hibbetts, a machinist, 69 years
old, was sent from the~_Harbor Receiv
ing Hospital to the City and County Hos
pital yesterday. While working at the
W J. Thomson Mill Company on Mission
street he was taken seriously ill and was
hurried to the Harbor Hospital. On his
arrival there he was taken violently PI
with hemorrhage of the stomach.

from the Slough City have started to
climb into first place, and, judging by the
playing the team is putting up, it will
coon arrive at that much-sought-for posi
tion.
The Athletics were a sad and morose
lot of youngsters when they left Recrea
tion Park yesterday. By dint of hard
work and well-placed hits they managed
to tie their rivals' score, but try as they
would, not another run could they hand.
Borchers bowled them over like tenpins,
and when the strikeouts were counted at
the end of hostilities, the "Chief" had
thirteen to his credit. This in itself was
a great victory, but Borchers took It upon
hlmsHf to send in the necessary run that
broke the spell with a well-placed two
bapger to the center-field fence.
These incidents occurred in one of the
fastest and closest games seen on the
home grounds this season, last season or
past seasons. In fact, it was a reminder
of olden days.
For eight innings the score remained
2 to 2, and at no stag** of the c^'-tr-st n-ns
victory assured either team. Both Fitz
patrick and Borchers pltuiu-ii sieauy ua.i,
and were well backed up by their teams.
Throughout the nine innings excitement
held sway. Borchers began his wonderful
pitching In the first inning. Beaton fanned
nnd Reilly gained first on a scratch hit,
but expired at third owing to McLaughlln
and Collins striking out.
In Stockton's half of the first inning,
with two men out, Smith singled, stole
second and romped home on "Cootsy"
Billings' smash to the center -garden. In
the second inning Mulier added another
by ripping out a two-bagger, stealing
third and coming home on White's short
drive.
In the third tne local team scored their
only runs. Johnson ran for Fitzpatrick,
who gained first on a pitched ball and was
advanced to second on Beaton's sacrifice.
Reilly struck out. but Pace dropped the
sphere. As the batter raced down the
line to first base Johnson threatened to
take third, and Pace, in trying to watc*.
both runners, became rattled and threw
the ball wide to Selna. Johnson scored.
Reilly later scored on Collins' short drive.
Rice prevented still another run by mak
ing a brilliant running capture of Scott's
fly to deep center.
Neither side scored until the lust of the
eighth, when Pace, who worked hard to
retrieve his misplay. rapped out a single
and took second on a sacrifice hit by Bill
ings. Borchers then made his long hit
and scored his helpmate. Reilly 's error
nf Muller's sharp grounder let in another
run.
The Athletics could do nothing in their
half, although twn men. reached first. The
defeated team did some poor base run
ning, and this In a measure caused its
defeat. Umpire McConnell's eyes were at
fault at times, but as he erred ou both
teams no great harm was done.

Placer Gravel Found by Prospectors
Near White Hills.
KINGMAX, Ariz., Sept. 5.â W. A.
Walker and G. W. Allen are both in this
cltv from the White Hills mining dis
trict, fifty miles north, bringing a sack
containing several ounces of placer gold
which they lately discovered and separat
ed from the dirt and gravel with a dry
washer. The point of discovery is about
eight miles from V.-.te Hills and not far
from the Senator mine. In one day they
carried their dry washer from gulch to
gulch prospecting the new ground and
obtained $10 bÂ«fore night. The field is an
extensive one, they say. and some of the
quartz broken off from the surface hangs
together with gold. Several parties have
left here and other points for the new dis
covery, and the opinion prevails that It
will make a new and valuable mining dis
trict.

SHERIFF AND DISTRICT
ATTORNEY AT OUTS
Controversy in Marin County Over
the Granting of Liquor
Licenses.
SAN RAFAEL. Sept. s.â One of the
merriest rows that ever disturbed the
Marin County government is about to
arise between the Sheriff's and the Dis
trict Attorney's offices. Tfie cause Is an
alleged juggling with the liquor license
laws on the part of District Attorney E.
B. Martlnelli in a way that tends to
throw Sheriff Harrison's office into dis
repute.
The trouble is over the renewing of a
liquor license for A. H. Mclnnes of Mill
Valley, and has some bearing on the suit
brought by the Tamalpais Land and
Ferry Company against that individual.
About four years ago Mclnnes was
granted a license to sell liquor, which was
renewed annually until May 25, 1897. At
that time a controversy arose over a
claim that In Mclnnes 1 " original petition
lor a permit for a license, filed with the
Board of Supervisors, an error had been
made. Inasmuch as the application had
not specified the building in which the
liquor was to be sold.
Sheriff Harrison was in a quandary, and
asked District Attorney Martinelli's ad
vice. The District Attorney stated that
in his opinion the application was faulty
and the license could not be renewed. On
being asked for his opinion in writing,
IWartinelli gave his opinion in black and
white, the letter being now preserved
among the Sheriff's archives.
r rom May 5, 1897, to the present time
Mclnnes has conducted the sale of liquor
without a license, and no action was
taken against him by the District Attor
ney, nor did that official present the
matter to the late Grand Jury. Last
\\ ednesday Mclnnes walked into Harri
son s office and asked for a renewal of
his license.
"I have seen Martlnelli," ho asserted.
and he said for me to certify that my
license has not been violated before the
County Clerk. In case you do not 'kick'
he says he will make no objection to my
getting the license."
Both Sheriff Harrison and Under Sheriff
Cottingham, while afterward In conversa
tion with Martinelli. were informed by
him that Mclnnes had told the truth.
Nevertheless, the license has not yet been
issued.
The strangest part of the affair is that
the District Attorney's office is not by
law supposed to have anything at all to
do with liquor licenses except to prosecute
violations.

GLADSTONE'S WILL
HAS BEEN PROBATED
It Is a Remarkable Document Writ
ten by the Grand Old Man in
a Memorandum Book.
LONDON, Sept. s.â The will of the late
Right Hon. W. E. Gladstone has been
probated. It shows that his personal
estate is valued at Â£59,50 G.
Mr. Gladstone's will was written by
himself in an ordinary memorandum
book. It is a document of about 2000
words and is a remarkable specimen of
penmanship. The second clause of the
will has reference to the funeral arrange
ments, and says:
"Commending myself to the Infinite
mercies of God In the Incarnate Son as
my only and sufficient hope. I leave the
particulars of my burial to my executors,
specifying only that they be very simple
and private, unless there be conclusive
reasons to the contrary. And I desire to
be buried where my wife may also He.
On no account shall a laudatory Inscrip
tion be placed over me."
After appointing his sons as executors,
the will charges the future possessor of
Hawarden to remember that, as the head
of the family, it will be his duty to extend
good offices to other members thereof, ac
cording to his ability and their manifest
needs and merits. The rest of the docu
ment leaves souvenirs to servants and be
queaths to hlsl grandson. William, as
heirlooms all patents of crown offices held
by the testator and books and prints pre
sented to him by the Queen, letters from
the Queen, etc.
The will bears date November 26, 1596.

DRAWN FROM A
SLOUGH BY AID
OF A RIATA
Thos. Grant Saved by
Officer McKenna.
HE TRIED TO END HIS LIFE
STABBED HIMSELF AND JUMPED
INTO ISLAIS CREEK.
Was Despondent Over Business Re
verses â He Will Be Examined
by the Insanity Com
missioners.
Driven temporarily insane by despond
ency and the excessive use of stimulants,
Thomas Grant made a desperate attempt
yesterday afternoon to commit suicide.
He stabbed himself and then jumped into
Islais Creek to make doubly sure of the
Job.
Mounted Policeman P. McKenna /was
notified about 1 o'clock that a man had
jumped Into Islais Creek. South San
Francisco. When McKenna reached the
place indicated he found Grant flounder
ing in the mud. Grant refused to come i
ashore, and McKenna did not relish the
idea of wading In the mud â¢ after him. I
He hit upon the scheme of lassoing him,
and after several attempts, made Inef
fectual by Grant's dodging, he succeed
ed In getting the riata over his shoul
ders and dragging him ashore.
â¢ Grant was sent to the Receiving Hos
pital in the patrol wagon, and when his
muddy clothes were removed it was
found that he had stabbed himself sev- |
eral times with a penknife. There were
two deep cuts over the heart, but not
of sufficient depth to cause serious in- â 
Jury. There were also a number of small
er cuts in the region of the heart, in the
abdomen and on the neck.
After his wounds were dressed Grant
was taken to the insane ward of the hos- I
pital, as it was apparent that his mind !
was deranged. He declared that he was
tired of life, and would t; 're the first op
portunity of bringing it to a close.
Grant is about 50 years of age. He was
born in Aberdeen, Scotland, coming to
this country with his parents when a
boy. He is a newspaper man, and until i
about two weeks ago was editor of the i
California Architect and Building News.
Since then he has been on a debauch,
wandering around without any settled
Idea. " 1
"I had trouble with the other fellow
on the paper," he said in speaking of
severing his connection with the Build
ing News. "He tried to get control and
so did I, but he beat me and I had to ]
quit. I have no home and no friends, I
and what is the use of living? My wife !
left me about fifteen years ago and I do
not know where she is. I was once a de
cent man, but whisky has been too much
for me, and it has lost me all the friends
I once had. I had been in the creek
about two hours before the policeman !
dragged me out. I wish he had let me i
alone."
Grant will be taken before the Insanity !
Commissioners this morning, and it is
probable that he will be sent to some
asylum for a time.
DRAGGED TO PRISON.
An Indignity Offered a Respectable
Citizen by a Deputy Pound-
Keeper.
'i ap overbearing actions of another
deputy poundkoop^r will be called to the
attention of Judge Mogan this morning,
and several citizens will testify against
him.
"W. J. Foster, a barber at 11215 Market
street, owns three fox terrier pups, and
yesterday afternoon he was playing w|th
them in front of his shop when William
Robling. a deputy poundkeeper, lassoed
the pups. Foster objected, and taking
hold of the net, released the pups and
threw them into his shop.
Robling and another deputy seized
Foster. Rot. ling in the presence of a
number of people produced a pair of hand
cuffs and fastened them on Foster's
wrist. He was then driven in the pound
wagon to the City Prison, where a charge
of interfering with an officer was booked
against him by Robling. He was released
shortly after on $20 cash bail.
Foster attributes the enmity of the
deputies to him from the fact that about
a month ago he swore out a warrant for
the arrest of one of their number for
using vulgar language toward him in the
presence of several ladles. The warrant
was a "John Doe" one, as he did not
know the name of the deputy, but he has
learned that Tyrrell, who was so heavily
fined by Judge Mogan Saturday for a
similar offense, was the man.
Looking for an Heiress.
Chief Lees yesterday received a letter
from Yankton, South Dakota, asking him
to locate Ella Evenson, a young woman
who left her home there about two years
ago and came to this city. She was last
heard of performing" In a variety theater
In Tacoma. She has been left valuable
property.

THE Joint celebration of Labor day
by the San Francisco Coun

proved a groat success. Many hun
dreds of families, armed with well
filled luncheon baskets, took the early
mornlng trains for the park, prepared
to spend a pleasant holiday. Every

turned home in the evening feeling the
benefits of an enjoyable outing.

A NEW LINE
ACROSS THE
CONTINENT
Possible Valley Road
Connection.
IT MAY BE THE SALT LAKE
JjOS ANGELES SPOKEN OF AS A
POINT OF CONTACT.
The Ne-w Corporation Already
Formed Expects to File Its
Papers in a Few
"Weeks.
The reticence that enveloped the office |
of the San Franci sen and San Joaquln [
Railway has been dispelled, and now the !
Mnvials of that road are willing to ac
knowledge that a private corporation
which will build the road over the moun
tains and connect with an Eastern line
Is in process of formation.
Robert Watt, the first vice president of !
the Valley road, said yesterday: "Yes, in J
a few weeks we hope to see the forma
tion of a company which will be composed |
of local capitalists with the purpose of j
constructing a line from Bakersfield to j
some point connecting with a railroad j
which will enable us to have a transcon
tinental continuance. This project seems i
to be the logical outcome of the buildin? ;
of the Valley road. Whether the Eastern ;
connections will be the Santa Fe line or â¢
not, I am not ready to say. There is a I
strong likelihood that it will be some j
other line. The Salt Lake line whicli ',
runs from Salt Lake City to Pioche it, â 
distant from Los Angeles about *00 miles, j
This road may be continued, as in all j
probability it will, so that a. junction may
be made with it by the Valley road at k
Los AngelfÃ.
"The new corporation formed for the j
purpose of building this road over the j
mountains will be composed entirely of j
local capitalists, some of whom have |
large interests in the Valley road. The j
expense of construction of a line over
the pass will amount to at least $4,000,
000; what it would be to Los Angeles L
cannot say. The new corporation will !
not make use of the survey of the Santa
Fe road, but will send its corps of sur
veyors out aa coon as the plans are ma
tured. The construction of this road will
be very expensive on account of the nat
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, 1898.
Davis, C. Hussey, W. M. Beggs, Ed Rosen
berp, W. H. Woodd.
The forenoon and early hours of the
afternoon were devoted to dancing and
tasting of tlie good things In the picnic
baskets. The children romped over the
park, enjoyed themselves on the
swings, took a ride on the merry-go
rour.d and feasted on popcorn. The
literary exorcises were held in the
dancing pavilion in the afternoon. J.
Hill of the Pattern-makers" Union,
president of the day. was to have
made the opening address. He was
called East a few days ago, and John
McCartney, chairman of the commit
tee of arrangements, acted in bis
stead. McCartney, in a few eulogistic
remarks, introduced J. E. McDougald
of the Marble-cutters' Union, who
spoke at considerable length of Labor
day and its celebration. He reviewed
the history of the Labor day move
ment from the first cerebration hold in
New York by the labor organizations
on September 5, ISS2, up to r years
ago, when Congress passed . bill de
claring Labor day a Federal holiday.
McDougald said that Labor day stood
next to the Fourth of July as a na
tional holiday.
"Tlie organization of labor." said he
in conclusion, "is more important than
any other issue now before the pub
lic By organization labor will receive
the full fruits of the wageworker.
Let us work in harmony; each for all
and all for each. Then poverty and
ural difficulties which will stand in the
way of the builders.
"The Santa Fe officials have been ap
proached by our people several tirm'S, but
we cou'.d not induce them to act. Finally
men of capital came together and they re
solved to build the road, and unless so.ne
hitch intervenes everything will be in a
fair way toward the consummation of the
plans for the connecting link of another
transcontinental pystem.
"The Santa Fe is not the only line with
which we may iorm a. junction. From
Salt Lake there is a road in process cf
construction with a terminus at Pioohe,
Nov. I have every reason to believe that
this road will he extended to Loa An
geles if we build a line over the pass to
that city. We may make connections
with both the Santa Fe and the Salt Lake
line. Parties representing the Salt Lake
Railroad Company have come to us and
Signified their willingness to make a junc
tion with t*he Valley road at Los Angeles
if we would build a road over the pass."
The new corporation which will apply
to the Secretary of State for a charter
will ank for a franchise to Los Angeles.
The significance of this is that the Santa
Fe may not be the line with which the
Eastern connections will be made. At
any rate it gives the Valley road an op
tion of one or two Eastern connections
or both, for there is hardly a doubt but
that the San Francisco and San Joaquin
Valley Railway may form a junction with
the Santa Fe if it so wishes. A dissatis
faction has been expressed by the Santa
Fe officials concerning their relations with
the Southern Pacific, and It is thought
that the former company will accept the
terms of the Valley road only too will
ingly. But the strongest probability in
regard to Eastern connections looks
toward the junction of the Salt Lake line,
which is a partYf the Oregon Short Line
system. At Salt Lake City it joins the
Union Pacific.
THE BURGLAR IDENTIFIED
Gus Winters, alias Gus Miller,
Booked on Two Charges, Is an
Ex-Convict.
Gus Winters, the desperado who was
arrested Sunday night by Detectives
Ryan and Dinan, was identified yesterday
by S. Abrahams and G. Gluckfield, sec
ond hand dealers, as a man who tried to
sell them a quantity of carpenters' tools
which were stolen from the building at
Third and Stevenson streets a week ago.
The carpenters later identified the tools
as their property, and two charges of
burglary were booked against Winters.
Winters was recognized by Detective
Bainbrldge, as Gus. Miller who was sent
to Folsom from Santa Clara County in
June, 1896. for burglary. He was released
from the penitentiary in February last.
The detectives expect to lodge more
charges against him.

salil that If the wagearners had more

IS TO MOVE
Four Companies to Go

ASSIGNMENT OF THE OTHERS
MUSTERING OUT OF THE SIXTH
AND SEVENTH.
Quite a Number of Men of These
Organizations Want to Be
Transferred to Other
Regiments.
A dispatch was received at military
headquarters yesterday from the War
Department designating four companies
of the Eighth California Regiment
for garrison duty at Fort Vancouver,
Washington. Assistant Adjutant Gen
eral Field at once wired the department
asking that the number of companies for
Vancouver be Increased to six, as it would
be inconvenient to properly assign eight
companies for duty In and around San
Francisco. An answer Is expected to
day, and in all probability the request
will be granted. Colonel Henshaw and
Lieutenant Colonel Carrington will go
to Vancouver with the battalion assigned
to that post. In the event that six com
panies are sent to Vancouver, the other
six will be assigned as follows: One to
Alcatraz. two to Benicia, and three to
Fort Point.
The mustering out of the Sixth and
Seventh California regiments, which task
Is in the hands of Captains Pratt and
Danes, will require considerable labor
and time. The men are to be granted
a furlough of thirty days after their ar
rival at the State rendezvous, and they
must report fit the expiration of their
furlough, unless they have a physician's
certificate of sickness; otherwise they
will be considered as deserters. During
the period of furlough the records must
be inspected and corrected, property in
spected and transt â ed, property returns
compared, c*Â»rtifica.ies of non-indebted
ness made out, return of absentees re
ported, and all mustering out returns and
papers prepared, and August pay rolls
made out and sent to the department
paymaster to pay.
The companies of the Sixth now doing
duty at Benicia, Alcatraz and Santa Cruz
have been ordered here, and Will arrive
on Thursday. They will Join tiie bat-j

tallon now at Fort Point and go Into
camp there preparatory to being mus
tered out. General Miller stated yester
day that he thought that it would take
about two weeks, perhaps less, for the
mustering officers to prepare everything,
and that then the Seventh would go to
Los Angeles, and the Sixth to Stockton
for the final steps connected with leav
ing the service. The Sixth does not like
the idea of going to Stockton, as the offi
cers declare that the armory there Is
only large enough for two companies,
so that General Miller Is Inclined to
think that It will remain here and be
mustered out. as Major Field, assistant
adjutant general, has telegraphed to
Washington asking for that permission.
Orders have been issued for the Eighth
to come over to Camp Merriam on Thurs
day.
SIXTH WASHINGTON.
Complaint That the Men Desir-
ing to Go Home Are Denied
the s Right of Petition.
The following letter was addressed to
The Call by a member of the Sixth Wash
ington Volunteers complaining that the
men were not allowed to circulate a peti
tion asking to be mustered out of the
service:
PRESIDIO, September 3.
To the Editor of The Call: The efforts of
The Call on behalf of the volunteer troops In
this city are fully appreciated by the majority
of the rank and file of the Washington regi
ment.
We are not disposed to be childish in our
endeavors to get back home, yet we think that
the Government should recognize that we are
men of affairs and that our need to be at our
homes and business is second only to that of
the country for our services, and we think that
we have a right to expect to be dealt with
now, as the war Is over, in the same spirit in
which we came forth in response to the Na
tion's call.
While we have some of the irresponsible ele
ment, as all regiments seem to have, our men
In the main are full-grown American citizens
and responsible members of the communities
from which they came, but are here treated
as convicts sent up for two years for being
unable to take care of themselves, and are
even denied that sacred right of petition, as
can be attested by four of our men who served
eight days in the guard house for signing and
circulating a petition to our Representative In
Congress to use his influence to have us re
leased as soon as consistent with the services.
If we are needed longer by our Government
in the cause of humanity there is hardly a man
of us who would ask to be released, and would
not only continue to cheerfully sacrifice per
sonal interests and family companionship, but
lay down his life for the cause.
Our officers, who draw better pay than they
ever did before or ever will again, and who
can have their families with them, are per
sistent in stating that we are content to do
garrison duty, and brand about SOO men who
signed the aforesaid petition as a few discon
tented and irresponsible persons. We are glad
that the free preys did not Join the army, and
will appreciate as long as we live anything
that you may be able to do to voice the senti
ment of the men whose mouths are sealed by
special orders. Respectfully,
A PRIVATE.

pines, are burled the remains of Captain
Reinhold Richter of the First Regi
ment of California, who fell in battle for
his country's cause, and upon a bed of
sorrow in a little cottage at 6 Chatta
nooga street, in this city, lies his wife,
overcome with grief.
The announcement of Captain Richter's
death in yesterday morning's Call, with
the touching tribute to the gallant sol
dier and the pathetic description of the
funeral by Sol N. Sheridan, was the first
positive information that Mrs. Richter
had received of her husband's fate. Up
to this time she had hopes that the
wound which he had received at the bat
tle near Manila would not prove fatal,
but she heard nothing as to his condi
tion. To relieve her anxiety a telegram
of inquiry was sent to Washington on
Saturday and the answer came back
from the adjutant general of the United
States army that "General Merritt had
telegraphed on August 23 a full list of
officers and men wounded at Manila up
to that date, and Captain Richter's name
was not among them."
This naturally raised Mrs. Richter's
hopes that her husband was alive, but
her hopes were cruelly blasted in the
news which came yesterday morning. The
blow to Mrs. Richter was a crushing one
and completely prostrated her. AH day
yesterday she refused to see any one or
to be comforted in her great grief. The
only persons admitted to the house were
a few intimate friends.
