SAMPSON MAY ATTACK
SPAIN'S ARMADA TO-MORROW
VIEW OF SAN JUAN, PORTO RICO, WHICH WAS REDUCED BY THE FLEET OF ADMIRAL SAMPSON.
SAN JUAN HAS BEEN REDUCED.
CAPE HAYTIEN, via Hayti, May 12.- -News has just been received here that Admiral Samp
son with his entire fleet bombarded San Juan this morning. I learn that Morro fort was entirely
destroyed.
RORT AU PRINCE, May 12.- -The American fleet, under Admiral Sampson, bombarded San
Juan de Porto Rico to-day. The following are the details of the bombardment thus far received:
The bombardment began this morning. Rear-Admiral Sampson with nine warships arrived
before San Juan just before sunrise. At a signal the battle ship lowa fired the first shot, which took
effect. Then the battle ship Indiana opened fire. In a few minutes Morro fort was reduced to a heap
of ruins. The fort made little effort to respond, and was silenced almost instantly,
The Spanish steamer .Rita was captured by the United States auxiliary cruiser Yale, which
took her crew on board.
Thousands of the population and the foreign consuls sought refuge in the interior of the island.
NEW YORK, May 12.â A special cable to a morning paper from St. Thomas, via Port de
France, Martinique, says: Sampson's fleet arrived off San Juan just before daylight. Word had been
sent ahead that the fortifications were to be bombarded, a notice to women and children, aliens and
others to leave the city and seek safety elsewhere. A shot from the battle-ship lowa began the bom
bardment. Then the Indiana opened from its forward turret with a 13-inch projectile. The walls of
Morro seemed to go into vapor, and ruined masonry and mangled corpses told of the inadequacy of
the scarps and bastions of the older days to withstand the assaults of modern armaments.
The castle soon made reply, but the firing indicated a panic within the fortifications. The first
shot flew far to leeward, bursting harmlessly. The heavy guns on the lowa and Indiana spoke again.
The monitors Puritan and Terror crept closer inshore, their low freeboard presenting a small target
for the forts, and their 10 and 12 inch guns doing tremendous execution against the fortifications.
Morro fired but three shots from her heavy guns. There were but seven shots fired from the
guns of the American ships, and these left Morro Castle a crumbled ruin. The Spaniards pluckily
served their guns as long as there was any hope, but their fire was slow and wild.
Not a single American ship was harmed; not an American seaman was killed or injured; but
at the last accounts the city had not surrendered, though it was completely at Admiral Sampson's
mercy. It had been deserted by the merchants and non-combatants. The foreign Consuls had fol
lowed the refugees into the country, and the troops were reported panic-stricken. The volunteers
had fled.
After the bombardment Sampson withdrew. Two of his vessels are now in St. Thomas, and
they may take with them the schooner Ida Southard, now here with 1000 tons of coal for the fleet.
During the bombardment the torpedo boat Porter, the collier Niagara and an armed tug remained
outside the line of fire observing the contest through glasses. They report seeing a dreadful panic
in San Juan, though no shots were sent into the town.
HAVANA, May 12.â Governor-General Blanco received a cable message to-day from the Cap
tain-General of Porto Rico which says that this morning an American fleet of eleven vessels opened
fire upon the forts, which answered vigorously. The dispatch says that at the time it was sent, 9
A. M., no personal losses had been sustained and little material damage done.

ST. PIERRE, Martinique, via Hayti, May 12.
The Spanish torpedo-destroyer Furor arrived at
this port late last night, but immediately put to
sea. Her arrival caused tremendous excitement.
About 5 o'clock this afternoon the Spanish de
stroyer Terror arrived. As I send this dispatch
five Spanish war vessels are in sight, bound
northward, apparently in the direction of Cuba.
They are the Spanish Cape Verde Fleet.
The United States scouting vessel Harvard is
in port. She came in here to send dispatches to
the Government in Washington. As a Spanish
vessel was in port and left after the Harvard ar
rived the port authorities served notice on Cap
tain Cotton that he would not be allowed to leave
until twenty-four hours after the departure of the
Spanish vessel. AMADEE TESTART.
NEW YORK, May 12.â
The above dispatch was
received from the Herald-
Call's special correspondent
at Martinique. It is believed
to be reliable and trustworthy
as he is indorsed by the United
States Consul at that place.
At the outbreak of hostili
ties the Herald and Call, in
order to prepare for just such
emergencies as the present,
communicated with all their
correspondents in the smaller
islands of the Antilles and in
structed them to be particu
larly watchful for the move
ments of the enemy's ships.
The former resident corre
spondent at St. Pierre had re
moved, and a cable dispatch
was sent to the United States
Consul asking him to suggest
the best man on the island
for the place. He promptly
replied, giv ing the name of
Mr. Testart.
This information is the sen
sational sequel to the Herald
and Call publication on May
i that its special dispatch
steamer Avery Hill had fol
lowed the Cape Verde fleet to
sea, and when they disap
peared on the horizon on April
29 they were steaming in a
westerly direction. The fleet
that left Cape Verde consisted
of the first -class cruisers Viz
caya, AlmiranteOquendo, In
fanta Maria Teresa and Cris
tobal Colon, and the three
torpedo destroyers Terror,
Furor and Pluton.
The distance from Cape
Verde to Porto Rico is ap

proximately 2486 miles, and
according to the above dis
patch it would seem that the
Spanish squadron proceeded
at the rate of about fourteen
knots an hour. This also
verifies the statement of the
Herald-Call correspondent on
the Avery Hill that the fleet
was steaming at a fast rate of
speed.
The Herald-Call corre
spondents have also
succeeded in definitely
locating Admiral Samp
son's fleet. It is off the
north coast of San Do
mingo, between Monte
Christi and Puerto Plata.
This information was ca
bled to the Herald and Call by
correspondents on the Danish
steamer Tyr, whose presence
in the Danish harbor of St
Thomas caused a diplomatic
protest from the Spanish
Government The Tyr ar
rived yesterday afternoon at
Puerto Plata, San Domingo.
They report that the Span
ish gunboats are cruising off
Hayti in search of the Amer
ican vessels. Upon arriving
the correspondents sent the
following dispatch to the
Herald:
" Puerto Plata, Thurs
day â The Tyr succeeded
in passing the Spanish
gunboats watching the
coast of Porto Rico and
reaching this harbor.
The Spanish Consul at
St. Thomas had our
steamer watched con
stantly and cabled the2
Governor - General of
Porto Rico the news of
ourdeparture. We avoid
ed anything that looked
like a warship and our
voyage was without in
cident.
"A German steamer
that arrived here yes
terday afternoon report
ed five American war
ships off Monte Christi,
followed by three news
paper dispatch boats.
They are undoubtedly
the vessels of Admiral
Sampson's squadron."
NEW YORK, May 12.â
The Washington correspond
ent to the Herald sends the
following:
It was pointed out by the
naval expert with whom 1
taiked to-night that the Span
ish fleet occupied thirteen
days in making the voyage
from St. Vincent to Marti
nique. At this rate its speed
was only seven knots an
hour, and he thought that
this low rate was maintained
because of the saving of coal
that would naturally result
therefrom. St. Pierre, Mar
tinique, from which point the
Herald-Call dispatch iÂ§ dated,
is 42^ miies from San Juan.
At the rate of seven miles an
hour the distance will be
covered within a little more
thai two days, so that by
Saturday evening Rear Ad
miral Sampson's force and
the enemy should be engaged
in battle.
Notwithstanding the inabil
ity of the department to cable
the Herald-Call's information
to Rear Admiral Sampson, it is
the confident expectation of
the authorities that ha will
be advised of the coming of
the Spanish fleet by the Am
erican scouts which are cruis-
ing in the waters of the
Windward Islands.
This means that the scene
of the prospective tattle will
be in the vicinity of San Juan.
Rear Admiral Sampson is
clo'hed with the most liberal
authority as to the manner in
which he shall give battle.
To the minds of naval ex
perts, however, it is evident
ly his purpose to permit the
Spanish fleet to enter the har
bor of San Juan. With his
monitors, which are incapa
ble of making a â¢ speed of
more than twelve knots an
hour, it wouid be impossible
for h'm to pursue the enemy
at sea as the Spanish men-of
war are all swift armored
cruisers, credited with having
a speed of twenty knots an
hour.
It will, therefore, probably
be his policy to* permit the
Spanish fleet to sail into San
Juan harbor and then to block
ade the harbor so as to pre
vent their exit.
LONDON, May 13.â The
Madrid correspondent of the
Daily News, telegraphing
Thursday night, says:
There are signs of manifest
anxiety at the Government
offices. One high personage
is convinced that the hostile
squadrons are in sight of
each other .and that an en
counter is probable within a
few hours.
The Government has re
ceived information that Ad
miral Cererva's voyage to
Martinique was uneventful.
The route to be taken to
Porto Rico is not known
here, but it was embodied in
Admiral Cererva's secret in
structions. He was instructed
to coal at a neutral point and
probably selected Port de
France for that purpose.
SITUATION
DESPERATE
AT MANILA
Dewey Awaits Orders Be
fore Attacking the Span
iards Ashore.
Famine Threatens the CityâAd
miral Montijo Blames His
Own Government.
Copyrighted, ISDB. by James Gordon Bennett.
HONGKONG, May 12.â The British
g-unboat Linnet arrived this afternoon
from Manila after a stay of one week
following the battle in Manila Bay.
She brought three passengers from
Manila City, but no mail from the
American fleet, as there had been no
communication on account of a case <â¢Â£
plague aboard the Linnet.
I learn that no change in the situa
tion has taken place since I left our
squadron a week ago. Rear-Admiral
Dewey is evidently waiting orders be
fore moving against the Spaniards
ashore.
The condition of the city is rapidly
growing worse. Most of the popula
tion immediately after our victory be
lieved that Rear-Admiral Dewey would
bombard the place, and therefore
moved into the suburbs, taking with
them only the necessaries of life. Food
is very scarce. Only the commonest
quality is obtainable. It is said that
only a few tons of flour remained
when the Linnet sailed, and no sup
plies were coming in from the interior.
It is supposed that there are about
10,000 troops in and near the city. The
insurgents have not yet made an at
tack in force, but their presence in
proximity was well known. The
Spaniards are said to be making wild
efforts to induce the native population
to remain loyal to the Spanish crown.
An insurgent leader is reported as
having been conferring with the Gov
ernment, but no one believes the na
tives can be prevented from seizing the
present opportunity to throw off the
Spanish yoke. The foreign warships
now in Manila Bay are the British
cruiser Immortalite, the French cruiser
Bruix, the German cruisers Kormoran
and Irene and the Japanese cruiser
Akitsushima. It is feared by all for
eigners that the insurgents will loot the
city if the Spaniards are defeated
or forced to evacuate.
Thousands of people are anxious to
get away, but there is no means of con
veying them. The steamer Esmeralda,
which arrived during the battle on
May 1, could take 1200 refugees at $10w
each, if permitted to do so.
Admiral Montijo, when asked the
cause of the Spanish squadron's de
feat, said the blame all belonged to his
Government. He had made requisi
tions for more ships, guns and torpe
does, but all were ignored. He claimed
that beside^ the gunboat Velasco, the
cruiser Antonio de (Jlloa was not in
fighting condition. According to our
view of the battle from the Olympia
the Ulloa was the last Spanish vessel
to cease firing.
Admiral Montijo said that Captain
Cardarzo, commanding the Reina Cris
tina, was alive when he (Montijo) gave
the order to abandon the ship,' which
had been set on fire by American
shells both forward and aft, but Cap
tain Cardarzo is said to have beon
killed by a fragment a moment later.
Admiral Montijo also confirmed the
news that the chaplain was killed, as
well as the boatswarn, gunner and
more than sixty men on the Christina.
He thought about 150 were wounded.
He estimated the total casualties at 400
killeu and sixty wounded aboard tht
ships, and twenty-four killed and 150
wounded ashore, but said the losses
ashore might be much greater.
The admiral confirmed the report that
he would have preferred to make his
fight at Subig Bay, and even went up
Subig Bay a week before the battle
with his squadron to see what coulo
be done there, but the forts were tot>
weak and guns could not be installed
there from the Cavite batteries in less
than a month. He said he felt sure ol
annihilation before the battle began,
but had done the best he could. He
said Rear-Admiral Dewey'had sent him
word that when the war was over h*
would be glad to shake his hand ana
congratulate him on the brave fight he
had made.
Admiral Montijo said he had not
tried to come out from the protection
of the batteries because the American
ships were so much superior to his
own. His flagship had been hit sev
enty times, and was afire at both ends
when he called the Juan de Austria
alongside and transferred his flag to
the latter. The Reina Cristina's steer
ing gear was disabled by a shell that
cut the steam pine heading to the con
dfnsor. Another shell wrecked the
bridge. As Boon as his flag had been
hoisted on the Juan de Austria the lat
ter ship became a target for the Ameri
can guns with deadly effect. Then, see
ing that further fighting was useless,
he signaled his captains to scuttle
their ships and go ashore.
Among the persons brought to Hong
kong by the Linnet was Chief En
gineer McKinley of the transport Isla
de Mlndanoa, one of the vessels de
stroyed. When the battle began the
Isla de Mindanoa steamed away from
the other Spanish ships and was backed
about two miles away. About noon
Admiral Dewey, not wishing to have
his eighteen guns loaded, turned them
on the stranded transport, thinking her
wholly abandoned. Her crew were at
dinner, but did not stay for dessert.
She was burned by the Concord, and
the crew spent several very unhappy
nights before they reached Manila.
For the following information I am
indebted to Mr. Wildman. American
Consul here, who tells me that accord
ing to his dispatches a flag of truce is
flying over Manila, and the people are
allowed to proceed freely to and from
the ships in the harbor.
The Americans are on duty night and
day on the lookout for boats which en
deavor to run the blockade with food
supplies. The hospital Is supported by
Americans. Spaniards are boasting
that their bis battle-ship Pelayo is
coming and will demolish t he Ameri
cans in ten minutes.
The Diario de Manila of May 4, the
first time of its publication after the
battle, says: "When the enemy's
squadron was sighted in perfect line of
battle through the clouds of misty
dawn on the morning of May 1 gloom
and surprise were general among the
people at Manila. The inequality of
our batteries compared with those of
the American squadron, which alarmed
the inhabitants of Manila at 6 o'clock
in the morning, was enough to tranÃ

form the tranquil character of our
tropical temperaments.
While the ladies and children in car
riages or on foot fled in fright to seek
refuge in the outlying suburbs and ad
jacent villages around the capital from
dangers multiplied by their imagina
tions, every man, from the most stately
personage to the most humble work
man, merchants, mechanics, Spaniards,
natives, soldiers, civilians, all we re
peat, sought their stations and put on
their arms, confident that never should
the enemy land at Manila unless he
i passed over their corpses. Although
i from the first moment the strength of
the enemy's armor and power of his
guns demonstrated that his ships were
invulnerable to our energies and our
armaments, the hostile squadron would
never have entered our bay had not
i its safety been guaranteed by its man
j if<Â»st superiority. The city walls, church
i towers, roofs of high buildings and all
! high places convenient for observation
| were occupied by those who were not

I in the walls, on bridges or at advanced

The slightest details of the enemy's
; ships were eagerly noted as they ad
i vanced toward Cavite, in a line paral
! lei with the beaches of Manila, as
! though they had just come out of the
j Pasig River. There were no gaps in

I realized the disparity between their

I seemed to devour with their eyes these

called upon to show their courage,
since the range of their guns and the
i weakness of our batteries enabled
'â  them to preserve immunity, while do

WASHINGTON. May 12.â The United
i States will establish a temporary gov
ernment over the Philippine Islands.
Orders have been issued for Major-
I General Merritt, now commanding the
j Department of the East at New York,
;to proceed to Manila with the least
! possible delay for the purpor.e of as
i suming the office of military Governor.
:of the Philippines. Similar orders to
proceed to the Philippines were sent to
Major-General E. S. Otis, commanding
the Department of the Colorado, at
Denver, who has recently been released
I from duty as president of the court
i martial which tried Captain O. M. Car
ter of the engineer corps.
Orders to General Otis direct him to
report to General Merritt for duty un
! der his direction in the Philippine Isl-
I ands. General Otis will be second in
I command ai.d will act as military Gov
ernor of the islands in case of the ab
! sence o* disability of General Merritt.
Orders were also issued for an army
! corps of about 12.000 men for immedi
ate duty in the Philippines. This corps
will be made up of regulars and volun
teer organizations stationed on the Pa
cific Coast and in the far Western
j States. General Merritt was at the
j War Department to-day in consultation
with the Secretary of War, General
Mll^p and the bureau chiefs with re
j gard to the organization of the expedi
tion.
Prompt action will be hod in the
matter with a view to having the
troops make an early start on their
long voyage across the Pacific. Gen
eral Merritt will leave this afternoon
for New YoTk to arrange his private
affairs preparatory to departure for
San Francisco as soon as possible.
Complete arrangements have been
made for the equipment, transporta
tion and subsistence of the troops and
they will be able to start for Manila
shortly after the arrival at San Fran-
cisco.
PROCLAIMING THE BLOCKADE.
President McXinley to Formally No
tify the Powers To-Day.
NEW YORK, May 12.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
President McKlnley will formally pro
claim to-morrow the institution and
maintenance of the blockade of Manila,
the capital of the Philippines.
Such a proclamation is in course of
preparation at the State Department,
and it will be presented to the Presi
dent for his signature to-morrow
morning. Likewise a notification will
be sent to the representatives of the
powers of the world, notably Great
Britain, Germany, Russia, France,
Netherlands, Japan and China, inform
ing them of the action of this Govern
ment. Such a notification will be in
terpreted to extend to the citizens of
the respective countries once it has
been communicated to the govern
ments, and neutral vessels will accord
ingly be subject to seizure, provided
they sail after warning has been given.
The preparation of the proclamations
was the result of a dispatch received by
Secretary Long this afternoon from
Rear Admiral Dewey announcing the
maintenance of "a strict blockade." It
developed to-day that the institution of
the blockade was in accordance with
the plans prepared by the Naval War
Board and Rear Admiral Dewey before
the attack on the Philippines was be
gun.
The blockade now being enforced by
Rear Admiral Dewey's squadron is
known in international law as a simple
or de facto blockade. There is a great
distinction between the blockade he has
instituted and that being maintained
by the North Atlantic squadron. In
case of capture the rules of evidence
which are applicable to one kind of
blockade are entirely inapplicable to
the other, and what a neutral vessel
might lawfully do in the case of a sim
ple blockade would be sufficient cause
for condemnation in case of a govern
mental blockade. A simple blockade
is constituted merely by the fact of an
investment and without the necessity
of public notification. This kind of
blockade which is being maintained by
Deweys' ships will end to-morrow when
the President's proclamation will mark
the beginning of the governmental
blockade.
It is expected that the President's
proclamation will permit the neutral
vessels in the harbor of Manila suffi
cient time to leave as was cone in the
case of the blockade of Havana and
other Cuban ports. It will state that
an efficient force will be posted so as
to prevent the'entrance or exit of ves
sels, and announce that any neutral
vessels approachin- Manila without
notice or knowledge of the tstabllsh
ment of the blockade will be duly
warned by the commander of the block
ading force, who will note such warn
ing on her log and if the same vessel
should again attempt to enter the
blockaded port she would be seized.
It will be an easy matter for Rear-
Admiral Dewey to blockade Manila.
All that will be necessary will be the
stationing of the McCulloch and an
other gunboat, like the Petrel, at the
entrance to the two channels leading
into the harbor. As he is in possession
of Cavite arsenal, etc., and has the city
under his guns, it will be impossible for
a blockade runner to pass his guns and
attempt to land supplies for the Span
iards. Satisfactory results are ex
pected from the maintenance of the
blockade. An important eff ct will be
to prevent supplies from reaching the
Spanish troops from the sea.
The insurgents can be depended upon
to capture all the supplies coming over
land. The Spaniards in the Philippines
are In the same situation as those in
Havana, and their condition wll! make
them a much easier prey for Uncle
Sam when the troops reach Manila,
thirty days hence.
CHARGED WITH
INCOMPETENCY
Allegations Against the
School Principal of
San Rafael.
Board of Education Meeting
To-Night Promises a
Sensation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, May 12.â T0-morrow
night this city will be treated to a
genuine sensation. At that time the
Board of Education will meet, and be
fore it will come charges against George
H. Boke, principal of the local gram
mar and high schools.
The charges in the main are Profes
sor Boke'a incapacity for the position
he now occupies, and are preferred by
Professor A. C. Abshire, the vice-prin
cipal. It is now known that these al
legations were made some time ago and
were to have been acted on at the last
meeting of the board, but for reasons
known only to the members of that
body the hearing of the charges was
postponed until the session to-morrow
evening.
The document prepared by Professor
Abshire comprises two closely type
written pages. It is alleged in these
written charges that Professor Boke is
in no wise fitted to hold the position of
principal for either the grammar or the
high school, that he has entirely failed
to lay out a proper course of study for
the pupils, and, lastly â this being the
most serious allegation of all â that the
principal has shown decided favoritism
in the grnwtat'ion of pupils.
That these charges, made as they
are by the vice principal, a man who is
known throughout the entire State as
an educator of note, will make a tre
mendous sensation in educational cir
cles is not to be doubted for a moment.
Professor Abshire was 6ne of the two
instructors chosen by the Sonoma
Board of Education to prepare a list of
questions to be answered by appli
cants for a cadetship at West Point in
1894. The 'ther was Professor Bull of
Healdsburpr.
The written charges are now In the
hands of Secretary Hanson of the
Board of Education. All the parties to
the affair nfuse to be Interviewed. It Is
asserted in some quarters that a quiet
move tending toward "whitewashing"
is on foot. But. there are others who
are dissatisfied with Principal Boko,
among them being Attorney Henry
Eiekhoff, president of the Board of
Town Tru^f.es, and Professor Abshire
will not Ja''k support.
THE ATTITUDE CF
AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.
Baron Banffy Explains That There Is
No Necessity for a Proclama
tion of Neutrality.
BUDAPEST, May 12.â Baron Banffy,
replying to an interpellation in the
lower house of the Diet to-day, said:
"The Government has not thought it
necessary to issue a formal declara
tion of neutrality in the present war.
Although it is unfortunate that the
war could not be prevented, it does not
follow that Austria-Hungary is called
upon to adopt a special attitude in the
matter. The friendly relations of Aus
tria-Hungary with both powers imply
an unconditional neutrality, without a
formal declaration. Moreover, an offi
cial declaration of neutrality would not
correspond with Austria-Hungary's
practice in similar cases, as she has
only thrice done so during the present
century, and then when the belliger
ents were Austria-Hungary's imme
ate neighbors."
The Premier added: "The Govern
ment is of the opinion that there is no
occasion to take special measures for
the security of the Hungarians in the
j United States, as it is quite out of the
question that they will experience an
noyance or unfavorable treatment.
Also, in view of the belligerents' repu
diation of privateering, there is no rea
son to fear Austria-Hungarian ship
ping will suffer from restrictive or il
legal treatment. The statement pub
lished to the effect that the American
Government has demanded of Austria-
Hungary an unconditional declaration
of neutrality is totally untrue."
GERMANY'S NEUTRALITY
NOT TO BE DOUBTED.
Hint to the English, French and
Austrian Newspapers on the
Nation's Stand.
BERLIN, May 12.â The semi-official
North German Gazette this afternoon,
in denying a reported interview be
tween Emperor William and United
States Embassador White relative to
the German Government's attitude to
ward the United States, says: "The
Americans cannot doubt the character
of our strict and perfectly loyal neu
trality after the repeated official dec
larations."
The North German Gazette adds:
"Let this also be a hint to the English,
French and Austrian newspapers,
which are so anxious to represent the
Government and public opinion of Ger
many as hostile to the President and
people of the United States. The im
perial policy has a right to feel conn
dent that its more than a century of
friendship to a state in which millions
of Germans have found a second home
will not be disturbed without argent
reasons."

NOW ASSURED
Success Finally Crowns
Persistent Efforts of
The Call.
Saeramentans to Be Protected
Against the Sewage From
Folsom Prison.
State Officials Join the Chamber of
Commerce Committee in the
Good Work.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, May 12.â The Call's
victory for the people of Sacramento is
now assured. Yesterday afternoon a
committee from the Chamber of Com
merce consisting of President D. A.
Lindley, Secretary J. O. Coleman and
Legal Adviser Alvin jr Bruner took
hold of the matter of the prison sewage
at Folsom, and it can be said with cer
tainty that their efforts will bring
about the desired result.
Armed with a copy of The Call con
taining the interview of Dr. Matthews,
the committee visited the Capitol for
the purpose of first seeing the doctor, in
order to secure his co-operation in their
plan to present the urgency of the sit
uation to the State Board of Examiners.
The committee next visited the Secre
tary of State, Hon. L. H. Brown, and,
much to their satisfaction, not only
found Mr. Brown in perfect sympathy
with them, but before they left he had
telephoned to Folsom regarding the
matter and prmised to do everything
in his power to the end sought.
In an Interview this morning with
The Call correspondent the Secretary of
State said: "Delays are dangerous,
particularly when the health of the
people is at stake. When the gentle
men from the Chamber of Commerce
visited me yesterday I congratulated
them on the evident interest they were
taking in this all absorbing question of
pure drinking water for our people.
Two of our men in the building are
now confined to their beds with typhoid
fever, and I am firmly of the belief that
much more sickness will come early in
the fall unless something is done with
the sewage which is now dumped into
the American Rif er."
When asked what course he advised
the committee to pursue Mr. Brown re
plied:
'"They should first go to the Board of
Prison Directors and have them lay the
facts before the Board of Examiners,
who have the authority to provide the
means whereby Warden Aull can con
struct a sewage plant similar to the
one contemplated in the Ennis Assem
bly bill, which passed the House but
was defeated in the Senate last session.
I have committed myself to a favorable
vote on the proposition, and believe I
am entirely Justified in the premises.
This is an unusual year, one hardly
contemplated, and as a State offlctal I
believe it my duty to provide the means
by which the State at least will be ab
solved from the awful responsibility
which must rest somewhere in the
event of a deadly epidemic."
So encouraged did the committee feel
after their interview with Mr. Brown
that they immediately decided upon a
systematic and aggressive campaign
against the threatening evil.
D A. Lindley, in company with an
engineer, left for the prison at Folsom
this morning with a view of ascertain
ing the exact cost of the proposed
plant. The purpose of such action was
to fortify themselves with facts which
would serve a practicable purpose in
their petition to both the Board of Pris
on Directors and the Board of Exam
iners.
The Prison Board meets next Satur
day at San Quentin. At that meeting
the committee from the Chamber of
Commerce will present the question and
ask for a favorable consideration at the
hands of the board. If successful they
will then present the recommendation
to the Board of Examiners, and it is
hoped that before the month of May
has passed the people of Sacramento
will have an opportunity of rejoicing
at a deliverance long prayed for.
The action of the Chamber of Com
merce dispensed with the necessity ot
proceeding criminally against Warden
Aull. consequently Trustee Paine has
not insisted upon the issuance of the
warrant. On the other hand, the pres
ent course will no doubt result much
more satisfactorily, as no one wants to
see the Warden subjected to a prose
cution, when It is known that no one
has been more emphatic in condemn
ing the present practice than the War
den himself. While Trustee Paine has
been relieved of an unpleasant duty,
his action in declaring his intention of
swearing to the complaint no doubt flid
much toward stimulating a more con
servative and effectual proceeding.
D. A. Lindley. president of the Cham
ber of Commerce, returned this even
ing from Folsom, where he had gone
for the purpose of consulting with the
Warden on the question of the prison
sewage. Mr. Lindley, in an interview
wiht The Call correspondent this even-
ing, said:
"My trip to Polsom was a most satis
factory one, and the result of my meet
ing with the Warden will be an Imme
diate step toward the end of our pur
pose. Warden Aull is in hearty accord
with the proposition to construct a
sewage plant at the prison, as the pres
ent practice is not only an injustice to
the people of Sacramento but the health
of the prisoners is in constant danger.
The Warden expressed a desire to have
the matter brouerht up at the meeting
which will be held in Folsom, and I am
in favor of complying with the re
quest.
"Consequently we may not appear be
fore the board at San Quentin Satur
day, IÂ»ut wait until they have their
meeting at Folsom the following week."
TO UTILIZE THE SEWAGE.
Governor Budd's Practical Sugges-
tions on the Subject.
A sewage plant at Folsom State
Prison may be constructed if the State
Board of Examiners authorizes the cre
ation of a deficiency in the appropria
tion for the support of the prison.
In regard to this subject Governor
Budd was interviewed yesterday. He
remarked: "No deficiency can be cre
ated by the State Board of Examiners
unless application for its allowance is
made by the State Board of Prison
Directors. Should the directors make
the application the Attorney-General
and myself would vote in favor of cre
ating a deficiency to provide a sewage*
plant at Folso..i.
"I do not believe in draining the sew
age of the prison Into the American
River. The sewage should be secured
and utilized as a fertilizing agent. Med
ical experts are familiar with such
methods of disposing of sewage. I have
not the time now to go into details
on the proposition to creat a deficiency.
I can say that the State Board of Ex
aminers might meet in San Francisco
or Sacramento without delay to con
sider an application from the Board of
Prison Directors."
SPANISH
CRISIS MAY
MEAN PEACE
Remodeling of the Cabinet
With Sagasta Still at
the Head.
Four Warlike Ministers Give Way
to Less Belligerent
Successors.
Copyrighted, IS9B. by James Gordon Bennett.
MADRID. May 12.â Though a Cabi
net crisis is not yet officially announced
there is no longer a shadow of a doubt
that it exists and is very acute, for
the Government is and has been for
several days one in name only. It is
in the position of a retiring partnership
being brought into order and plans for
future financial operations of the firm
perfected. This will occupy a very
little time longer.
Within probably a couple of days the
guidance of Spain's destinies will be
turned over, if not entirely to fresh
hands, at any rate to a Ministry that
will contain at least three new mem
bers. That is to cay, every one is
convinced that nothing is to be gained
by the retirement of Senor Sagasta
from the position of president of the,
council, while it is of vital importance
that Senors Moret, Gullon and Bermejo
be replaced in the portfolios of the colo
nies, foreign affairs and marine.
Who will succeed them in their re
spective posts is still an open ques
tion. It is, however, almost certain
that the Colonial Minister will be tak
en from among Senor Gamazo's imme
diate followers, with the object of con
solidating the Liberal party and gain
ing for the Government the most uni
ted support possible that it can obtain
In the country, where there are well
nigh as many political parties as Sen
ators and Deputies..
Whoever may be selected to fill the
sixteen vacancies that already virtually
exist, the Government's strength will
be materially greater that it could
possibly have been had Senor Sagasta
succeeded in avoiding a crisis. In
deed, changes in the Cabinet, if not al
together of the Government, were a ne
cessity in the present state of Span
ish affairs.
No Ministry that included Senors
Moret and Gullon could possibly enter
upon negotiations for peace with
America on the basis of the cession of
Cuba and Porto Rico, which, I have
the best authority for saying, the new
Cabinet will do immediately after it is
formed. The importance, therefore, to
America of the political situation here
is manifest and no secret.
Senor Gullon was one of the stumb
ling blocks in the way or a peaceful so
lution of the question at issue between
America and Spain even before war
was declared. His removal became im
perative from the moment the Manila
disaster made it clear that to carry on
a warlike policy any further meant the
ruin of Spain.
As a man closely identified with the
scheme of an autonomist Cabinet
Senor Moret could not possibly retain
office after the failure of his scheme
to secure that peace which he
claimed it would be the only
means of obtaining. It will be
a long time before his countrymen
forgive his phrase, "Autonomy means
peace." His retirement, therefore,
also a necessity.
Admiral Bermejo is held too muc
responsible in the public mind for h
lack of foresight which led to the d
feat at Manila for his retention in a r
modeled Cabinet to be even considere
These three changes, therefore, a
logically certain to be made. I can al
state that it is actually determined
make them. My authority is one of t
most prominent statesmen at the pre
ent juncture. In the course of a co
versation with him yesterday, in whi
he gave me a lucid exposition of th
present situation, he said: "It wou
be idle to deny that the Governmen
no matter from which party It
drawn, must devote its energies to r
establishing peaceful relations with t
United States. War cannot be pr
longed. Even should Spain win a nava
engagement in Antlllian waters,
would only make matters more de
perate by wounding the America
amour propre, while should she lose
the terms the United States would a
as the price of concluding peace wou
be only more severe.
"This all parties! â no matter of what
political colorâ are agreed upon. The
only thin* therefore, left for Spain to
do is to try to secure peace upon the
most favorable terms possible now. As
every declaration of President McKin
ley has been dictated with the avowed
object of securing the Independence of
Cuba and Porto Rico, the most respon
sible men here are convinced that to
fight any longer would be folly, wh;
peace might be secured and the Phill
pines retained by giving up the Spa
ish possessions in the Antilles.
"I may add that it Is pretty gene
ally known that Senor Moret advise
this step as long ago as April 20, upo
the very eve of the virtual declaratio
of war, when Spain broke off dipl
matic relations with the United State
Much progress has been made sine
then in realization of the grave dang
Spain is in. At that time it is probab
that not a single member of Sagasta
Cabinet, with the exception of Seno
Moret himself, would have even dis
cussed such a solution of the problem
Now, and only three weeks later, tl
Ministry Is said to be looking upon
as the only satisfactory one possible.
"Of course," my informant contlnue(
"such a step necessitated the removal
of Senor Moret. This will be done when
the crisis is officially made public. With
his disappearance the Government finds
itself in a position to secure peace un
embarrassed by former pledges ana
declarations.
"At the same time the responsibility
for satisfactorily settling the difficulty
naturally devolves upon the Liberals.
All parties, therefore, are at once con
sidering that Sagasta be retained at
the head of the remodeled Cabinet.
"This means, to put it briefly, that
Admiral Bermejo and Senor Gullon are
to resign their portfolios when the Min
istry is reconstructed, and the Govern
ment will try to secure peace by every
means in its power, even should it call
for giving up Porto Rico and Cuba, so
long as the Philippines are retained
by Spain."
This decision of the Government
seems confirmed by the unaccountable
delay In the meeting of the fleets on
the other side of the Atlantic. There
seems every reason to believe that the
Ministry realizes how serious a de
cisive engagement must be for Spain,
no matter w nether the result be vio-i
tory or defeat.
If this reasoning: is sound the pros
j pects for early peace are not at all
black. Senor Gullon's removal, too,
heightens the chances in its favor. He
was certainly General Woorlford's bete
noir, and with him and Senor Mo ret Â§

At the patriotic bull fight to raise funds

all the receipts being devoted to th&

requisitioned and thousands on foot
formed a long procession waiting- ad

their breasts, the men displaying the
colors at their buttonholes or in their
cravats, while the trappings of the

colors. The stores were closed and the

Nobody dared speak of peace.

POWER.
The fee/ing of power is as splendid a one
as there is in the world. When you know*
that you are equal to any task that may 6Â»>
placed before you, you cannot but feel proud.
But how few men there are in the different
stations of life who are full of it. Much
fewer than you would imagine. Loss of
strength is caused in men from causes too
numerous to mention. Over-exertion is on*
of the commonest. An individual, instead of
exercising all of his functions in equal pro-
portion, uses some to excess. And as a mat-
ter of consequence he begins to get weak.
But there is at least one way in which ha
may recover his strength. It is by using
the "Hudyan" treatment. If he does ha wilt
pass through the following stages:
The power is going fast.
Prcmatureness always.
Loss stopped.
Confidence returns.
Health and full vigor aÂ»ain.
But beware. "Hudyan" fan be had only
from Hudsonian doctors, and it is the one
thing that will restore to you your full and
perfect health. If you have abused your
rights granted you by nature do not be dis-
couraged. "Hudyan" will give you your
power back. Send for free circulars and
testimonials showing what it has done for
20,000 other sufferers. You can have med-
ical advice free, too, if you will but ask for
it And then, again, if there is any blood
taint in your body ask for "30-day blood
cure" circulars. They are free, too. That
remarkable cure expels all traces of the
poison from your system and makes you as
clean as a new-born babe. It is as certain
to cure all such cases as "Hudyan" is to
restore

ca's first dead fell yesterday in a fierce

blown to pieces and five were wounded
on the torpedo boat Winslow. The
dead are:

The battle lasted thirty-five minutes.
THE FIGHT IN CARDENAS BAYâ THE HUDSON TRYING TO TOW THE WINSLOW OUT OF THE ZONE OF FIRE
It wfis between the torpedo-boat Wins
low, the auxiliary tug Hudson and the
gunboat Wilmington on the one side
and the Cardenas batteries and four
Spanish gunboats on the other. The
Wlnslow was the main target of the
enemy, and was put? out of service.
The other American vessels were not
damaged, except that the Hudson's two
ventilators were slightly scratched by
flying shrapnel.
The enemy's loss is largely conjec
tural. One of their gunboats caught
fire and the men of the Hudson think
It sank. The fire spread to the bar
recks and swept away several small
warehouses, and for a time the whole
water front seemed to be ablaze. The
Hudson's crew also believe that two
at destroyers were
disabled, but they admit that their esti
mates of the damage is largely guess
work, as the action whs too sharp for
outside observations to be made.
The Winslow wius within 2500 yards
of the shore when the shells struck
her. How she carme to be so close was
told by her commander. Lieutenant
John Bernadou. He said: "We were
making observations when the enemy
opened fire on us. The Wilmington or
dered us to go in and attack the gun
boats. We went in under full steam,
and there's the result." He was on the
Hudson when he said this, and with
the final words he pointed to a huddle
of American flags on the deck near by.
Under the stars and stripes were out
lined five rigid forms.
The engagement took place inside the
harbor of Cardenas. The gunboat Wil
mington, the torpedo boat Winslow
at:d the gunboat Hudson were tl>S only
vessels engaged. They entered the har
bor for the purpose of attacking some
Spanish gunboats which were known to
be there. These latter, however, were
not seen by the American force
until the Spaniards opened fire. The
land batceries of Cardenas supported
the fire of the Spanish gunboats.
The engagement commenced at 2:05
p. m. and lasted for about an hour. The
wounded are: B. E. Cox, gunners'
mate; D. McKeon, quartermaster; J.
Patterson, fireman; F. Gray; Lieuten
ant J. B. Bernadou. All are slightly
wounded except Patterson, whose con
dition is serious.
The battle, while it lasted, was ter
rific. The Wilmington and the Hud-
Bon fired on the Spanish boats, which
were lying at the dock. The firing be
gan at a rantro of 3500 yards. A few min
utes later the Winslow came up and
also opened fire. In an instant the en
tire attention of the Spanish gunboats
and land batteries was directed upon
her
I From all sides shot and shell poured
on the little torpedo boat. The Wil
ington and the Hudson still kept up
leir fire, but tjjey could not turn aside
le terrible stArm' of fire and death
juring in upon the torpedo boat.
The crew of the Winslow, however,
ever faltered for a second. At 2:30
Bolid shot crashed into the hull of
ie Winslow and knocked out her
Mer. In an instant she began to roll
id rock helplessly. Then there was a I
loment of awful suspense. A cheer
' triumph went up from the Spaniards
i the gunboats and in the batteries
id again a storm of fire was opened
p on the helpless boat.
The gunboat Hudson, which was ly
ing near by, started to the assistance
of the Winslow. She ran alongside the
torpedo-boat and tried to throw a line
to the imperiled crew. Up to this
ftime, with the exception of one shot,
which disabled the boiler of the Wins
low. the firing of the Spanish gunboats
had been wild, but as the Winslow lay
rolling in the water the range grew i
closer and shells begrn to explode all I
about her. It was difficult for the I
Hudson to set near enough to throw a I
line to the Winslow's crew, so terrible
was the fire all about her.
Finally, after about twenty minutes,
the Hudson approached near enough to
. throw a Tine.
Ensign Bagley and six men were
standing in a group on the deck of the
Winslow.
"Heave her, heave her," shouted Bag
ley as he looked toward the comman
der of the Hudson and called for a
line.
"Don't miss it," shouted an officer
from the Hudson, and with a smile
Bagley called back, "Let her come. It's
getting too hot here for comfort."
The line was thrown and about the
same instant a shell burst in the very
midst of the group of men on board the
Winslow.
Ragley was instantly killed and a
few others dropped about him. Half
a dozen more fell groaning on the
blood-stained deck. One of the dead
men pitched headlong over the side of
the boat, but his feet caught in the
iron rail and he was hauled back.
Bagley's body was stretched on the
deck with his face completely torn
away and the upper part of his body
shattered.
It, was a terrible moment. The tor
pedo-boat, disabled and helpless, rolled
and swayed under the fury of the fire
from the Spanish gunboats.
When the shell burst in the group on
board the Winslow another wild shout
of triumph went un *-nm the Spanish
boats and batteries and again a heavy
fire was opened on the torpedo-boat.
Finally the Hudson succeeded in get
ting a line on board the Winslow and
was towing her in the deadly range
when the line parted again and both
boats were at the mercy of the Spanish
fire.
At 3:05 p. m. the Hudson managed to
get another line on the deck of the
Winslow, but there were only three
men left at that time to make it fast.
The line was finally secured and the

WASHINGTON. D. C, May 11.â Sad news came to the
Navy Department this morning of the blockading fleet of
the Cuban fleet telling of the killing of five American
sailors, the first to shed their life blood for the country
since the outbreak of the war.
The press telegrams had already announced that the
Hudson had arrived at Key West bringing In the body of
Ensign Worth Bagley, but as no other names were given
at first the officials were very anxious to learn who the
other victims were. At half-past 10 a brief telegram came
addressed to the Secretary of hhe Navy. It read as follows:
"KEY WEST. Fla.. May 12.â Secretary of the Navy:
In an action off Cardenas yesterday with Spanish gun
boats and batteries and the blockading vessels the follow
ing men were killed on the torpedo boat Winslow:
"WORTH BAGLEY. Ensign, U. S. N.

day. REMEY."
THE SA^ FRAXCISCO CALL, FKIDAY, MAY 13, 1898.
Winslow was towed up to Pedras Isl
and, where she was anchored with her
dead and wounded on deck. There
some men from the Hudson went on
board the Winslow and took the most
seriously wounded men off. Three who
were taken on board the Machias died
shortly afterward.
At 9:15 p. m. yesterday the Hudson
with the dead bodies and some of the
wounded started for Key West, arriv
ing here at 8 o'clock this morning.
Commander Bernadou of the Winslow
was wounded on the left leg, but not
seriously.
Lieutenant Bernadou, with the sur
geon bending over him, told the story
of the battle to a correspondent as
calmly as if talking of the weather. He
began :
I ""We went under full speed to attack
I the Spanish boats in the harbor, and
'â  you know the result. We went under
' orders from the commander of the Wil
: mington. Our boat is badly damaged,
| but she will be brought here for re
! pairs, and I think she will be ready for
service again in two weeks.
Continuing:, the lieutenant said: "The
Winslow was the worst Injured and had
five of her men killed, and I don't know
haw many injured. We were ordered
to attack the Spanish gunboats at Car
denas. We steamed in under full head,
and were fired upon as soon as we were
in rangre. The Spanish boats were tied
up at the docks and had a fair range
on us. The batteries on shore also
opened on us, and I think we received
most of the fire. I don't know whether
any one was hurt on the Wilmington
or the Hudson, but I think not.
"I have no fault to find with the Win
slow's crew. They acted nobly all the
; way through. The men who were killed
fell at the same time. We were stand
ing in a group and the aim of the Span
ish was perfect. A shell burst in our

boats to the Government docks. This
was the first news of the engagement
to reach Key West.
No time was lost in ministering to the
i wounded. A quick call was sent to the
marine hospital and an ambulance
came clattering down to the dock. In
the meantime the news had spread
j and crowds gathered about the dock,
j but there was no demonstration. The
! success of the American ships in every
! action thus far has been so overwhelm
- ing that it was hard to realize that
I death had at last come to some of our
I men. Ensign Bagley was about 26
i years old, and while the fleet was sta
: tioned here he was one of the most pop
; ular men in the service. The news of
â  his death came as a terrible shook to
: all who knew him. It has always been
â¢ a foregone conclusion that the torpedo
i boat was among the first to fall, as the
I work is most dangerous, but in spite of
; this, when the fleet was stationed here
i and changes in assignments were fre
| quently made, all the young men of the
! service were eager for torpedo boat
; duty.
The Hudson shows the effect of the
fight. Her smo-kestack is punctured
i with bullet holes and her cabin and
decks are smashed and splintered.
The Winslow's dead are now lying
at an undertaking establishment. They
were taken there in a rough wagon,
still covered by the stars and stripes.
The rude conveyance was followed by
! a large crowd, and all day long the
: doors of the shop have been surround
ed by a large gathering. Naval offi
cers, marines and sailors went there
to look upon the faces of their dead
comrades.
Some of the bodies show fearful
wounds. Ensign Bagley was literally
torn to pieces. His body will be em
balmed and shipped home.
Oiler Varveres had his throat cut
open by a sharp piece of shell, which
apparently severed his windpipe as if
slashed with a razor.
Fireman Daniels had his left shoul
der ripped up and the right side of his
head torn open.
The body of Tunnell, the colored
cook, shows no wounds.
Fireman Meek was hit in the groin.
No orders for the disposition of the
bodies have yet been issued.

Secretary Long promptly wired to
i Commodore Remey at Key West for
details of the affair.
Ensign Bagley was a native of North
Carolina. His mother Mrs. W. H. Bag
! ley, resides at 125 South street, Raleigh,
;N. C. Bagley was appointed to the Na
! val Academy in September, 1891, from
I the Fourth District of North Carolina.
i He graduated June 30 last year, and
was appointed an ensign on the day
j following. While a cadet attached to
i the academy he was assigned to make
! cruises in the Texas, Montgomery, In
j diana and Maine. Upon being appoint
! Ed an ensign last June he was assigned
to duty on the Indiana, but in the fol
i lowing month was transferred to the
! Maine. He served in that ship until
j November 23 last, when he was or
i dered to the Columbian Iron Works for
j duty in connection with the Winslow,
which was under construction at that
time. W r hen she was completed and
put in commission last December he
was attached to her and remained so
until the moment of his death.
The disposition of the remains of the
young officer await an expression from
his mother, but it is believed they will
be taken from Key West with a de
tail of naval officers.
Lieutenant John Baptist Bernadou,
who was reported as being wounded,
is one of the most dashing and venture
some young officers in the naval ser
vice. It was because of this very qual
! ity that he was selected for the com
mand of the Winslow, as it was known
that the service required would be of
the most hazardous character. Lieu
| tenant Bernadou is really an expert in
i torpedo 'work. He watched the build
| ing of the Winslow almost from the
I time the keel was laid to her trial trip
I as inspector In charge, and took com
| mand of her immediately upon her ac
ceptance by the Government. He was
born in November, 1858, In Philadel
j phia. and was appointed to the Naval
1 Academy by President Grant in 187 G.
He was a midshipman in 1882, and an
ensign, junior grade, in March, 1883. In
June of the following year he received
his appointment as a full ensign. In
1392 he became a lieutenant. Junior
grade, and attained his full lieutenancy
in 1896.
The Navy Department has received
a dispatch from Commodore Remey at
Key West as follows: "Winslow badly
damaged. Will be s^nt here as soon as
temporarily repaired."
DID GREAT DAMAGE
TO HARBOR AND TOWN
The Little American Boats Caused
Much Havoc Among the Span
ish Forces.
KEY " EST, Fla., May 12.â 1t Is now
known that the American boats made
f v.rious hay >c with Cardenas harbor
and town. The captain of the Hudson
said:
"I know we destroyed a large part of
their town near the wharves, burned
one of their gunboats, and I think de
stroyed two other torpedo destroyers.
We were in a vortex of shot, shell and
smoke, etc., and could not tell accu
rately, but we saw one of their boats
on fire and sinking soon after the ac
tion began. Then a large building near
the wharf, 1 think the barracks, took
fire, and many other buildings were
soon burning. The Spanish had mask
ed batteries on all sides of us. As soon
as we got within range of their batteries
they would move them. I think their
guns were 8-*-" pieces . Our large boats
could not pet into the harbor to help us

Cardenas and Exaggerate
Their Victory.
MADRID. May 12.â A report from
Captain-General Blanco on the Car
denas battle says: "Cardenas does
not possess defenses of any kind, and
only the little gunboats Ligeria and
Antonio Lopez were in port. They re
plied to the attack. The Antonio Lo
pez was disabled, but 300 volunteers de
fended the town, prevented the landing
and compelled the American ships to
retire with considerable loss. A Span
ish sergeant and seven soldiers were
wounded. Captain-General Blanco has
congratulated the authorities at Car
denas."

the Transports With

There Is a Prospect of General
Graham and Staff Accompa

Call Office, Riggs House.
Washington, May 12.
It was stated at the Navy Depart
ment to-night that the cruiser Charles
ton would not leave San Francisco for
Majiila until Saturday, owing to a de
lay in securing the necessary provis
ions and munitions of war. The
Charleston will be closely followed by
the troop transports, under command
of MajoT-General Merritt, who will he
Military Governor of the Philippines,
and General Otis. It is reported in re
liable quarters that General Graham
and staff will also accompany the ex
pedition, but some doubt is expressed
as to the accuracy of this statement
In view of the fact that General Gra
ham will retire in September, and un
der the terms of the bill recently
passed by Congress the services of re
tired army officers cannot be utilized
In the present war. It is quite possi
ble, however, that General Graham
may be selected foT this service with
the understanding that he will be re
called before the date of his retire
ment. . â¢
Indeed, the administration hopes the
â war will be over before September.
General Miles, who has planned to
leave Washington to-night for Tampa,
will not go before to-morrow after
noon. In the meantime, the troops will
be rapidly mobilized at gulf ports and
concentrated at Tampa with a view to
Invading Cuba next Monday. The War
Department plans embrace the em
barkation of a large portion of the in
vading force early Monday morning,
and their landing on Cuban soil before
night of the same day. The depart
ment naturally declines to make pub
lic the landing place, further than to
Bay that it will be somewhere on that
portion of the island lying west of
Havana. It would not be surprising if
Commodore Schley's flying squadron
should receive immediate orders to
start for Cuban waters to co-operate
with the blockading squadron in de

SALINAS, May 12.â Dr. , Henry Edward
Stafford, the leading physician of this
city and county, died at his home ; here
thin evening from the result of an opera
â¢ tion for appendicitis. He was taken ill
on Friday and the disease progressed
with such alarming rapidity that on Mon
day Dr. Huntlngton of Sacramento was
.'summoned by telegraph. He arrived by
special train and immediately decided
â upon the operation, was performed
in the presence of all the local physi
cians. The patient never rallied, but sank
Slowly until the end came this evening.
At the time of his death Dr. Stafford
â¢was pension examining surgeon and also
the Southern Pacific Company's physi
cian. He was a past master , in the Ma

Arch Chapter, past noble grand :of the
Independent Order of Odd Fellows, past
chief ranger of the Foresters and held
high offices in other fraternal and social
organizations. He was formerly a school

at the time of his death he was a mem
ber of the Board of Education. He leaves
a wife and three children in comfortable
circumstances.
Dr. Stafford was 47 years old and a na

FIRES IN CHICAGO.
Xarge Grain Elevator Destroyed and
a Fatal Blaze in a Boarding
House.
CHICAGO, May 12.â Grain elevator
D, belonging to the Chicago, Burlington
and Quincy Elevator Company, was de
stroyed by fire this afternoon. The
losses on building and contents will ag
gregate about $1,200,000. The elevator
contained 1,115,000 bushels of grain,
valued at $890,000, the property of P. D.
Armour. The grain was fully insured.
One person burned to death, one fa

fending the military base established
by the invading army until the arrival
of Sampson, when the big rifles of his
battle-ships axe expected to be turned
upon the defenses of Havana.
A message from Admiral Dewey was
received by the Navy Department this
evening that greatly cheered Secretary
Lone, for it showed that the doughty
American commander was not only
master of the situation, but had evi
dently driven every SDanish soldier
from the batteries about Manila, for
the cablegram told of the busy work of
the American fleet in dismantling the
captured Spanish vessels, raising guns
from the bottom of the harbor and
making salvage of all naval property
worthy the effort. In the face of the
disquieting rumors received from Brit
ish sources of indiscriminate rioting in
the Philippines, Admiral Dewey's dis
patch was most reassuring.
A gallant ensign and four brave
sailors of the United States navy were
killed yesterday by a Spanish shell that
pierced the boiler of the torpedo-boat
Winslow in an assault upon the Span
ish gunboats and the shore batteries in
Cardenas harbor. These are the first
casualties on the American side in the
war with Spain, and while they have
a depressing effect upon the adminis
tration, they have only served to
strengthen th 2 determination of th 3
President and his advisers to press the
campaign relentlessly to a speedy close.
A grave feature of the disaster of the
Winslow is the fact that the most ex
perienced officers in the Navy Depart
ment unite in the opinion that it was
a serious error of judgment to send her
into Cardenas Bay. Torpedo-boats of
her class are but thin steel shells with
little power of resistance, and the duty
of such vessels is merely to launch tor
pedoes under cover of the protecting
guns of the cruisers and battle-ships.
Lieutenant Bernadou, the Winslow's
commander, was wounded in the en
counter, and it is not probable that
any action will be taken by the depart
ment until he has entirely recovered,
but there is a strong disposition in the
highest naval quarters to institute a
rigid investigation as to the source of
the orders under which this little vessel
was exposed to the heavy fire of shore
batteries, mounting eight-inch guns.

POPULISTS OF TULARE
COUNTY OPPOSE FUSION.
State Convention Delegates Instruct
ed to Keep to the Middle of the
Boad.
VISALIA, May 11.â The Populists of Tu

Everything did not run smoothly in the
convention. One delegate noticed that a
few favorites already in office were nomi
nated by acclamation, and he Indignantly
declared that the whole ticket had been
"cut and dried" and refused to sit in the
convention. He at once unpinned hit
badge, took his hat and left the hall.
In the evening there was a gathering
of the party and speeches were made by
prominent Populists.
The convention resolved to oppose
fusion with any other party and pledged
its delegates to the State Convention to
refuse to sit in the convention if any
fusion proposition carried.
VERDICT FOB DR,. SEIFERT.
Outcome of a San Jose Case That Has
Attracted Great Interest.
SAN JOSE, May 12.â The suit of Grace
L. Burke vs. Dr. G. W. Seifert to recover
$25,000 damages for alleged surgical mal
practice, which has been on trial in Judge
Lorigan'a- court for eight days, went to
the jury this afternoon. After a short
deliberation a verdict was returned in
favor of the defendant. The case has at
tracted a great deal of interest among
members of the medical profession both
here and in San Francisco. The medi
cal witnesses for the plaintiff were all
homeopaths, those for the defendant reg
ulars, or allopaths. The plaintiff, a girl
of 9 years, broke her arm by a fall. There
was both fracture and dislocation, and as
dislocation was not reduced the claim
was made that Dr. Seifert, who attended
the patient, failed to make a proper diag
nosis, and was grossly negligent and care
less.

MAJOR-GENERAL WESLEY MERRITT.
WILL RUSH
REGIMENTS
SOUTHWARD
Bids Sought for Transpor
tation by Quartermas
ter Kimball.
Twenty-Seven Thousand Volun
teers Will Join the Regulars
for Invasion of Cuba.
NEW YORK, May 12.â Acting under
hurried instructions from the War De
partment, Colonel Amos S. Kimball,
quartermaster of the department of the
East, sent out to the various railroad
and transportation companies a call for
bids for the immediate transportation
to four Southern points of mobilization
of 27,000 troops. The bids will be opened
in the office of the quartermaster of the
army about noon Saturday.
The men will be ready to start the
following day and will reach their des
tination, leaving the military camps In
New York, New Jersey, New Hamp
shire, Vermont, Connecticut, Massachu
setts and Maine.
This will be the greatest move of
troops since the Civil War. In all there
will be twenty-five full regiments of
infantry, four batteries of artillery and
two troops of cavalry. The only regu
lars in the list of troops from this de
partment are the regiment quartered at
Fort Ethan Allen, Vermont. This sud
den change in the plans of the War De
partment may have some effect on the
contracts for the vessels of the Old Do
minion, Clyde and Morgan lines, for
which arrangements wece made by
Colonel Rimstall on Tuesday.
Railroad men estimate that It will
take at least 1000 cars and ninety en
gines to make up the trains to trans
port the troops.
TAMPA, May 12.â The cavalry regi
ments from Chickamauga, the first
train of which arrived in Tampa late
this afternoon, will be encamped in
Tampa. A location for the infantry
regiments baa not yet been definitely
decided upon, although it is quite
probable they will encamp near the
cavalry. The place selected is con
venient to the railroad and is fully
three miles nearer the port Tampa
docks than the camping grounds of
the infantry already here.
The Orizaba, the big Ward line
steamer that has been at the quaran
tine station down the bay for several
days, passed into the slip near the coal
docks last night and to-day took on a
full supply of coal. The work of fit
ting her for transport duty will be
rushed to a conclusion, including the
Olivette and Gussie, both of which
boats are expected here by to-morrow
night. A fleet of eleven transports will
be gathered at Port Tampa ready for
embarkation. These boats can easily
carry a force of from 7000 to 8000 men,
with about 2000 horses and mules.
The Salvation Army may furnish a
corps of nurses for the army in Cuba.
A delegation of Salvation Army leaders
from New York, including Mrs. Cap
tain Sam, sent here by Commander
Booth-Tucker, has asked General
Shafter for permission to send fifteen
or twenty nurses, all of whom are said
to be trained, with the expedition.
Permission was refused, it is said, al
though it is intimated that after the
troops get into Cuba there would be no
objection to Salvation Army nurses,
should nurses be required.
CHATTANOOGA, Term., May 12.â
The Second. Regiment of Infantry
marched from Camp Thomas to lioss
ville station this morning and there
boarded the Southern Railway trains
for Tampa. The Seventh and Sixteenth
Infantry regiments marched nine miles
to Ringold, Ga., where the Western
and Atlantic trains were taken for AU
lanta. The First and Tenth Regiments
of Cavalry, originally ordered to New
Orleans, but later to Tampa, will get
out to-morrow.
The work of removal is progressing
more slowly than expected and it is
now doubtful if the entire army will be
off before Saturday night. Twenty
carloads of provisions for the volun
teers are arriving daily. Almost every
vacant building in the city is being
used for storage purposes.
The Soddy Coal Company of this city
has received an order for twenty-five
cars of coal daily until further orders.
The coal is shipped to Tampa and put
aboard the war vessels there.
Recruits continue to come in rapidly.
They are assigned to the various regi
ments and sent on to the front.
Colonel Lee, quartermaster on Gen
eral Brooke's staff, speaking unofncial
, ly, said that the Second Cavalry, which

The indications are that all available
cargoes will be put into Cuba without
delay.
WASHINGTON, May 12.â Reports re
ceived at Adjutant-General Corbin's of

KESWICK PARTIALLY
DESTROYED BY FIRE
Half the Business Portion of the
Mining Camp in Ashes â The
Principal Losers.
KESWICK, Cal., May 12.â The east sld^
of Main street, from Shasta to Nortr
was razed to the ground this morning b
fire. It originated In a lodging hous
known as Our House, and is supposed t<
have been due to the carelessness of au
inebriated lodger. The same premises
had a narrow escape from fire last week
through tho explosion of a lamp. Half
the busipess buildings in Keswick were
destroyed. Nothing could be dune to stay
the flames, for the town has no fire com
pany or water works. The total loss is
$25,000 and the insurance is light. The
buildings were all frame structures. The
property destroyed included five saloons,
two restaurants, two lodging houses, a
barber shop and three stores. The Kes
wick Hotel, the largest and finest build
ing in the village, escaped with slight
damage to the front. It was thought a
piano player named Smythe had been
burned, but after the ruins had been
searched for three hours Smythe turned
up.
Keswick has been a town of phenom
enal growth. In two years it has grown
from nothing to a town of 1200 population.
The buildings destroyed were of the char
acter usually erected in new mining
towns.
The following are the principal losers:
Moore & Marx, saloon building, $SOO, in
surance $400; McCarthy & Gillespie, two

RAILROADS AND
THEIR EMPLOYES.
WASHINGTON, May 12.â After a pro
longed discussion the Senate this even
ing passed the bill "concerning carriers
engaged in interstate commerce, and
their employes," popularly known as the
railway arbitration bill. The most im
portant amendment to the measure was
that offered by Hoar of Massachusetts,
which provides that courts shall Issue no
injunction against railway employes
which shall compel them to give their
personal service to a company against
their will. On the final vote only three
Senatorsâ Money of Mississippi, Rawlins
of Utah and Tlllman of South Carolina
were recorded against the bill.
A bill was passed removing all disabili
ties imposed by the fourteenth amend
ment to the constitution on persons who
were at one time engaged in rebellion
against the United States.
The war revenue measure was reported
to the Senate, and notice was given that
it would be taken up next Monday for
consideration.
OF COAST INTEREST.
WASHINGTON, May 12.â The Senate
proposition to decrease the number of
mail deliveries in the larger cities (in
cluding San Francisco) to four has been

BRIGADIER-GENERAL ELWELL S. OTIS.
TAXES FOR THE
WAR REVENUE
Finance Committee Re
ports the Bill to the
Senate.
All House Provisions for Bonds
and Certificates Are
Stricken Out.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, May 12.
The Senate Committee on Finance
to-day finished its consideration of the
war revenue bill, after a two weeks'
sitting, and Senator Allison reported it
to the Senate at 4 o'clock. The bill
shows that all the provisions in the
House bill for the issuance of bonds
and certificates of indebtedness were
stricken out, and Allison, in reporting
the measure, made a minority report
giving authority for the bond issue.
The amendment inserted at the in
stance of the Democrats for the issu
ance of greenbacks is as follows:
That the Secretary of the Treasury is
hereby authorized and directed, for the
purpose of meeting and defraying the ex
penditures made necessary by reason of
the existing war against Spain, to pre
pare and issue on the credit of the united
States of America, from time to time, as
the same may be needed, during the next
iiecal year, United States legal tender
notes to the amount of $150,000,000, which
notes shall be of like denominations and
of the same legal tender quality and shall
be payable and redeemable and re-tasu
able in the same manner as the $346,000,000
of such notes now outstanding as de
scribed and mentioned in the act of Con
gress of May 1, 1878, said notes when nrst
issued to be expended only upon the war
account aforesaid, and said notes shall
be exempt from taxation by or under
State or municipal authority.
The provision for the coinage of the
silver seigniorage is as follows:
That the Secretary of the Treasury
shall immediately cause to be coined as
fast and as soon as possible into standard
silver dollars, which shall be of like
weight and fineness and of like legal ten
der quality as those provided for under
existing law, the silver bullion now held
in the Treasury being the amount of he
sain or seigniorage derived from the pur
chases of silver bullion by the Treasury
under the act of July 14, IS9O, amounting
to the sum of $42,000,000; said moneys so
coined to be imemidately available for
payment of expenditures on account of
the present war with Spain. The Secre
tary of the Treasury is hereby further au
thorized to immediately issue. In advance
of the coinage of said seigniorage afore
said silver certificates of similar design
and denominations and of the same quan
tity payable and redeemable in like man
ner as those authorized by law, in such
sums as may be from time to time need
ed for public expenditures, not exceeding
in the total amount of said seigniorage
so held in the Treasury.
The provision inserted at the in
stknee of the Democratic members of
the committee, and which has been
known as the corporation tax, is much
broader in its scope than this descrip
tion would lead- one to believe. The
first paragraph of this provision is as
follows:
Every person, firm, company or cor
poration, owning or possessing, or hav
ing the care or management of any rail
road, street railroad, sleeping car, canal,
steamboat, ship, barge, canalboat or other
vessel, stage coach or any other vehicle,
except hacks or carriages not running on
continuous routes, engaged or employed
in the business of transporting passengers
or freight for hire, or in transporting the
mails of the United States, shall be sub
ject and pay a special annual excise tax
equivalent to one-fourth of one per cent
um of the gross receipts from passengers,
mails, shippers or freighters of any such
railroad, street railway, sleeping car,
canal, steamboat, ship, barge, canalboat,
or other vessel, or such stage coach, or
other vehicle; provided that the assess
ment hereby made shall not include any
amount for the receipts of the trans
portation of persons, freight or mails be
tween the United States and any foreign
port; but such taxes shall be rated for
the transportation of persons, freight or
mails from a port within the United
States through a foreign territory to a
port within the United States and shall
be assessed upon and collected from per
sons, firms, companies or corporations
within the United States receiving hire or
pay for such transportation of persons,
freight or mails.
A like tax of one-fourth of 1 per
cent of the gross receipts is imposed on
"any person, firm, company or corpor
ation carrying on or doing an express
business"; also on any person, etc.,

A Practical Drill of Two
Battalions.
Plans for concentrating 15.000 troops
on the Presidio reservation have been
formed by the War Department. The
pre?s dispatches regarding the move
ment of Western regiments give a
pretty clear indication that the mili
tary authorities in Washington design
to mass that number of men in San
Francisco. Orders providing for sub-
sistence and transportation tend to ver
ify the statement that 15,000 soldiers at
least will be sent here to join the ex
pedition to the Philippine Islands.
When a million men were in the field
in 1864 a force of fifteen thousand did
not attract much attention, but now,
after a long period of profound peace,
men seem to be quite an
army of soldiers. A large fleet of ocean
transports will be required to convey
the men to Manila, and many ships
laden with supplies for the troops
must accompany or follow the expedi-
Camping places must be found on the
reservation for the volunteers from
Minnesota, Kansas, Nebraska, Colo
rado, South Dakota, Wyoming, Wash
ington and Oregon. Major Edward
Field, department adjutant-general,
Colonel Louis T. Morris, post comman
der, and Lieutenant Neall, Fourth
United States Cavalry, chief quarter
master of the volunteers, were on the
lookout yesterday for suitable camping
ground for the incoming regiments.
Consultation has been had with Her
man Schussler, chief engineer of the
Spring Valley Water Works, concern
ing the water supply of the troops.
Lieutenant J. E. Nolan, Fourth Cav
alry, commissary officer of the Presidio,
is prepared to supply an army of 15,000
men with rations. The great rush now
is to provide the volunteers with cloth
ing and camp equipage. Minnesota
has for many years maintained an ef
fective National Guard, and it is prob-
Eble that the Thirteenth Regiment from
that State may arrive here fully
equipped for field service.
The advance guard of the volunteers
from Oregon and Washington may ar
rive by steamship to-day. .Space be
tween the Fourteenth Infantry and the
Sixth California Volunteers has been
reserved for the next troops to arrive at
the Presidio. ; '= â¢; '.' >
Telegraphic orders "were received
yesterday announcing ! that Captain
George Ruhlen, U. S. A., who was re
cently on duty with the Alaskan Relief
Expedition, has been appointed chief
quartermaster of the Department of
California, with headquarters in San
Francisco.
The announcement was also made
yesterday that Major Robert H. White,
surgeon, U. S. A., stationed at the
Presidio, had been appointed chief sur
geon of the proposed expedition to the
Philippines.
Brigadier-General O. D. Greene, U.
S. A., retired, formerly adjutant-gen
eraJ of this department and one of the
ablest men in the army, visited the
camp at the Presidio a few days ago.
To a fellow-officer he remarked that
the California volunteers were as fine
a body of men in appearance on the
field as he ever saw, and he could
hardly believe, while watching them
on drill, that they were not regular
soldiers. This is a high compliment to
the State troops, and coming as it does
from a veteran officer, is sincere.
So far as the military and naval au
thorities can judge, there is not a
cruiser or privateer of the Spanish
navy within 2000 miles of this port, but
nevertheless a vigilant lookout Is
maintained at Fort Point. The fact is
considered that it is the unexpected
that happens, hence measures have
been taken to guard against surprise.
As stated In The Call several days ago.
Major Heuer and his assistants of the
f engineer corps have completed the
work on the mine field of this harbor,
and the mines are protected by rapid
fire guns. The torpedoes, together with
the breech-loading rifles at Lime Point
and Fort Point, and the mortar bat
teries and dynamite guns, to say noth
ing of the powerful Monterey, can take
care that no hostile craft gets into this
bay.
The artillery defenses of San Fran
cisco are under the direction of Col
onel M. P. Miller, Third Artillery, one
of the most capable and active officers
in the army. There is one battery: of
the Third Artillery at Lime Point, one
at Alcatraz and five batteries taking
care of the big rifles, mortars and dy
namite guns in the region of Fort
Point.
Yesterday Colonel Mosby sent the
following explanation to Richmond:
SAN FRANCISCO, May 12, 1898.
The Times. Richmond, Va.: The criti
cisms of General. Miles uo him great in
justice for his friendly suggestion to get
political influence to bear in my behalf
on the appointing power to induce the
aceptance of the offer of my services as a
soldier. He is not the appointing power.
He can only recommend me, which he did.
I made no condition about rank; in fact,
am as indifferent about rank now as I
was in our late war. I cannot go as a
private, as I did then, because both m
age and the loss of an eye exclude me
from enlistment. I would as soon be -a
lieutenant as a brigadier general; pro
vided I go in front of our army and In
rear of the enemy. As my military record
was indorsed during the war by General
Robert E. Lee. and by General Grant aft
er the "war, I do not think a Congress
roan's Indorsement would add to its credit,
and shall not L ask it. I do not think that
Grant and Lee need any Congressional
Indorsement. JOHN S. MOSBY

ACTIVITY AT THE CAMP.
California Battalions Engage in
Mimic and Bloodless
Warfare.
Acting under instructions from the War
Department. Dre. Gassoway and Perry
of the United States Marino Hospital, on
the Presidio reservation, called upon the
Burgeons commanding the volunteer hos
pital corps and tendered to them in be
half of the Government the Marine Hos
pital for all serious and surgical ca^es.
The many friends of Company M of the
Seventh Regiment are determined that
the boys of Riverside shall not be lacking
in funds while here in camp, and conse
quently thÂ» citizens of Riverside oy pri
vate subscription have raised a purse of
1600, which will be presented to the cap
tain of the company to-day to be used
for the comfort of the commissioned
and non-commissioned officers and men
of Company M. The Sheriff of Riverside
County will arrive to-day ard present the
purse to the company.
The Fourteenth Infantry gave a Dai
ta.ion drill in the afternoon, which was
witnessed by many hund' eas of tne vlslt :
ors. Major Koue pu: his command
through the various maneuvers with per
fect military grace and precision.
Major McCarthy had taken the precau
tion to see that "all of the men in the
First California Regiment shall be vac
cinated. This will t>e done at once, so
that the boys msy have no sore arms
when they arrive at Manila-
Lieutenant v^nt, who 7? the recruiting
officer of the Fourteenth Infantry, naa
a number of applications yesterday from
men desiring to join the regulars.
The hospital corps of the Sixth **\&
roent will have its tent erected and the
corps in shape to-day. . . t
In the camp of the Fourteenth Infanto
Major Robe has everything running upon
a basis of strict military discipline. J.ne
clock-like order of the camp routine ana
the perfect harmony prevailing among
the men and officers at once impress tne
visitors. Major Robe has made many
friends since his arrival here. His com
mand is composed of men recruited trora
along the coast, and a more magnificent
looking body of men it was never the
good luck of an officer to command, tie
is as proud of his command as Napoleon
was of the OW Guard. Major Robe ex
pects to have his battalion augmented by
the 20th of this month by the two com
panies that have been ordered here irom
>'lajor McCarthy, surgeon First Cali
fornia Volunteer Infantry, was kept ex
ceedingly busy yesterday unpacking his
medical "supplies, which have arrived. The
hospital corps is now entirely supplied
with everything that is necessary for the
trip to Manila.
The Second and Third Battalions, under
the command of Majors Sime and Tilden,
engaged in a mimic battle yesterday
morning while they were drilling and
both battalions came out of the blood
less fray with colors Hying and honors
even. Both majors executed flank move
ments and performed deeds of great
valor, while the behavior of the men
who were supposed to be under an ex
ceedingly heavy lire was gallant in the
extreme. The tight was of an impromptu
nature as neither of the majors nor tnelr
men had any idea that it was pending.
It occurred to Colonel Smith, when he
saw the two battalions drilling, to order
them to engage each other, and they
obeyed orders with gratifying results.
Captain Carrlngton was at the camp in
the morning swearing in the necessary
men to complete the company comple
ments of the Sixth Regiment. These two
battalions are now practically in shape
to move, as their requisitions have been
about completed.
Lieutenant Hammond of the Seventh
has been appointed by Colonel Berry |
I nance officer and acting commissary
subsistence. Colonel Smith also Issued
order yesterday morning changing the
ill of several of the non-commissioned
â ers, who have been employed in the
luctrtermaster's department and around
headquarters. The requisitions of the
First have been completed by the com
pany officers, and the command will soon
be entirely outfitted.
Lieutenant-Colonel Johnson, the com
mander of the two battalions of the Sixth
Infantry, celebrated the thirty-fifth anni
versary of the day his father led Troop X,
California Cavalry Volunteers, from this
State to the Civil War by buckling on
his sword and taking command of his di
vision at the call of the President in the
present emergency.
Sergeant J. Alexander of the Sacra
mento company of the Sixth Infantry was
yesterday promoted to be regimental ser
geant-major.
The citizens of Stockton have raised $300
by popular subscription to purchase
horses and present them to Lieutenant-
Colonel Johnson and Major G. Grant.
When the Sacramento company left the
Capital City last Sunday the boys of the
corps were given a grand ovation by the
citizens. Captain J. F. Lucey will send an
appropriate letter expressing the gratifi
cation of the officers and men to Mayor
Land.
The work of making out and signing
commissions for the officers of the Cali
fornia volunteers was completed at Cali
fornia State military headquarters yester
day by Governor Budd. Adjutant-General
Barrett and Colonel Burgln of the Gov
ernor's staff. Altogether 252 commissions
have been made out. These will be taken
to Sacramento to-day, where the great
seal of the State of California will be af
fixed, after which they will be presented
to the respective officers entitled to them.
The post commissary at the Presidio re
ceived telegraphic instructions from
Washington yesterday to issue ten days'
field rations to the volunteers now sta
! on the reservation, which instruc
tions will be carried out to-day. As It
will require the delivery of over 30.000 ra
tions at one day's notice, the magnitude
of the undertaking will Be easily appre
':. The commissary, however, says
he is equal to the emergency, and, in fact,
;y to meet any demand that may be
made upon him at the shortest notice. .
The headquarters of Captain F. de L.
rarrington at the California Hotel were
crowded yesterday with men who failed
to pass trie required physical examination
to admit of their being accepted as re
cruits in the volunteer service of the
United States army. Altogether, Lieuten
ant Cloman, acting quartermaster of the
recruits, furnished transportation to 348
men, who presented certificates from the
captains of their respective companies
certifying that the men had come to San
Francisco in good faith with the Intention
to enlist. There are still about fifty men
entitled to return home, to whom, trans
portation will be furnished to-day.
A Sword for Tobin.
The members of the Board of Health,
together with all the employes of the de
partment, assembled in the secretary's
office yesterday morning to bid farewell
to Chief Laundry Inspector William F.
Tobin who will depart for Manila in a
ff-w days, being a member of Colonel
Smith's staff of the First California Vol
unteers.
Liieu tenant Tobin had been requested to
come in from the Presidio, and when he
appeared Dr. John C. Spencer, on behalf
ot his associates and the employes, pre
sented the young officer with a beautiful
gold-mounted sword. On the seaboard
was the following inscription:
Presented to Lieutenant William F. Tobin,
Lieutenant First California Infantry, United
States Volunteers, by Mb friends In the Health
Office, Ran Francisco, May 12, UK.
Lieutenant Tobin could only stammer
his thanks and shake the hands of his
associates.
GRAND LARCENY CHARGED.
Mrs. Annie Carroll Wants Her
Nephew, William Ensbury, Ar
rested.
Mrs. Annie Carroll, 1210 Folsom street,
swore to a complaint in Judge Joachim
son's court yesterday for the arrest of her
nephew, William Ensbury, a saloon-keep
er at 312 Second avenue, on a charge of
grand larceny.
In her statement she alleges that her
husband died in September, 1895, and part
of his estate was a deposit of $1700 in the
German Savings Bank. As she cannot

THE SA!N" FRAKCISCO CALX,, FRIDAY, MAY 13, 1898.
HAD TO LEARN HOW TO SMOKE.
Miss Minnie Young Discovers It Is a Pro
fessional Necessity, and Succumbs.
Miss Minnie Young, daughter of Brigadier-General Young, U. S. A., Is
learning to smoke. The lady took her first lesson yesterday, at rehearsal
at the California Theater, and while she is still diffluent in expressing her
opinion as to the soothing influences or the health-disturbing qualities of
the weed, she made unusual progress and hopes soon to be able to distin
guish between an "Egyptian Princess" and a "Nestor."
Miss Young and Miss Olive Snider, a young society belle of Oakland,
are to make their professional debut on Monday evening at the California
Theater in a dramatization of Oulda's popular novel "Moths." Miss Young
Is to play the fetching American girl Fuschia I.each and Miss Snider the
wicked Duchesse de Sonnaz. Miss Snider, though at first greatly appalled
by the designing features of the titled lady's character, is working bravely,
and hopes to score a success.
Miss Young is sure to make an Ideal Fuschla. She is all life and merri
ment and has a deliciously frank way about her. She knows her lines, and
if she conquers the pernicious weed Is sure to nil the hearts of her friends
with pride.
Miss Young has about concluded that smoking is an accessory to the
dramatic art that requires both time and attention. Her first attempt was
not a brilliant success, but It could scarcely be culled a disastrous failure.
A chalky palor and deep rings under the eyes were the only visible effects
of the death-dealing cigarette. Sympathetic friends have assured Miss
Young that the cigarette may be conquered In two lessons, and so by
Monday evening the debutante hopes to be able to not only master the
weed, but gracefully expel the smoke through her nostrils.
Monday evening will be a gala night at the California. All that Is left
of the army and the entire 400 have arranged to be present and lend Miss
Young a hand. Oakland representatives will be over to testify their appre
ciation of Miss Snider. Theater parties will flourish like roses in June, and
the house Is sure to present a magificent spectacle with its wealth of beauti
fully gowned women and handsome men.

The Preliminary Examination on the
First Case Postponed Until To-

When the cases were called, ex-Judge
Ferral, for the defendants, answered

by Ferral. Graham replied that as Prose

"I think Ripans Tabules about the best thfng
there is," said the Colonel; "I guess they are THE
best ! I was sitting the other evening smoking and drink-
ing a little whisky and water ; there were four of us there
and one complained of being very uncomfortable. When
he had told us about it I said to him, - all that ails you is
indigestion,' and I gave him a Ripans Tabule from a little
vial I had in my pocket. We each of us took one, and
since then I have learned that every one of the three has
bought the TABULES and thinks them the greatest
things there are a going."
to conduct the prosecution himself, but as
Private Detective Curtin had not taken
the trouble to make him conversant with
the facts in the case he was unable to
proceed, and, therefore, he would insist
upon a continuance as asked.
The Judge thought that under the cir
cumstances it would be no injustice to
the defendants to grant the continuance,
but it must be understood that the cases
would go on to-morrow.
Ferral then asked that the bonds of
each of the defendants should be reduced
to $20u0. The Judge said he would have
no objection if reliable sureties were of
fered and approved by Bond Inspector
Newman. The defendants were then taken
back to the Cfty Prison, where another
warrant was served upon them upon an
other charge of extortion. In this in
stance they are charged with obtaining
from Nevills $500 on February 27 by a
similar threat of accusing Nevills of being
; false to his marriage vows. This was two
I days after the alleged extortion of the
$2000. The complaint, like the previous
one. was drawn up in the District Attor
j ney's office.

POSTAL INVESTIGATION.
r~^ ONGRESSMAN LOUD took a step which will
I be gratifying to the whole country when he
moved for the appointment of a Congressional
Commission to make an exhaustive examination into
the postal service. Such an examination has long
been needed. The postal deficit has been a scandal
for years past, and since there is so much disagree
ment as to the real cause of the evil and the best
remedy to provide for it, the importance of the work
to be expected of the proposed commission will be
eevrywhere recognized.
The subject is one with which the general public
is by this time fairly familiar. While the postal ser
vices of Great Britain, France and Germany yield
handsome surplus revenues to those countries, ours
is a burden upon the national treasury instead of a
help. Two theories are advocated in reference to the
issue. According to one the deficit is due mainly to
abuses of the clause of the law providing for second
class mail matter, and according to the other it is due
to excessive rates paid to railroads for transporting
the mails.
Each of these theories has a foundation in fact. Oa
all classes of mail except second class there is a sur
plus revenue, and it is known that hundreds of tons
of matter is carried as second class that is not justly
entitled to that privilege. If this abuse were pre
vented there would be no deficit. On the other hand
there is a large amount of evidence to support the
assertion that the transportation rates are excessive
and that if they were reduced to rightful figures the
Government could continue .to carry as second class
matter all that it is now carrying without having a de
ficit at the end of the year.
The discussion on the subject has been widespread
and prolonged. The commission proposed by Con
gressman Loud is therefore one called for by public
demand. It is time that all evidence on the subject
should be gathered, digested and reported so that
some steps may be taken to put an end to a condition
of affairs which is not only wasteful of public money,
but a discredit to the business methods of the Govern
ment
An evening paper notable for stupidity not unsav
ored of malice claims that the Cubans have the Span
ish virtually conquered now, the intimation being the
United States troops are being sent to the island
simply to win glory for the commanders. Of course
the assertion is arrant foolishness and but for its
tincture of meanness would not be worth noticing.
Certainly to reply to it would be a waste of space.
Doubtless the Kaiser will "have something to say
about the final disposition of the Philippines." He
has full liberty to make remarks concerning that or
anything else. In fact there is no reason for discour
aging his tendency to talk himself black in the face.
But he must not get the idea that Uncle Sam is to be
influenced by his chatter.
At the risk of offending two large and muscular
persons the fact is worth mentioning that nobody be
lieves either Corbett or Fitzsimmons intends to fight,
nobody cares whether they do or do not enter the
ring. Only the vague hope that one might kill the
other and go to jail for it arouses a passing interest.
The pang of having to go on the witness-stand
day after day and evade the truth L not the only one
to which Mr. Huntington i^ being subjected. There
has sprung up a habit, which must cause him pain,
of making the Southern Pacific pay for the privilege
of killing people, a privilege once free.
People on this coast have done all in their power
to sustain the administration. They have found no
fault and they have offered more sen-ice than could
be utilized. But they do feel like saying now that
they wish the Oregon had not been taken away.
Reports that Spanish spies have attempted to
poison the water used by the troops in the South may
be unfounded. However, the fact that they are gen
erally believed shows the sort of people civilization
thinks the Spanish are.
It is too bad some of the troops coming from the
Middle West cannot stop off in Arizona long enough
to practice on the Indians threatening to uprise. The
troops need actual experience and the Indians need
to be made good.
Attempts to make the climate of Manila appear fatal
to white men are worse than idle. In the first place
they are not founded on fact, and in the second place
they may add to the distress of those whose brave
boys are going there.
There is a chance for the police to win approbation
by arresting a few of the bunko men who are making
Hfe a burden to the greenhorn. In many instances
the greenhorn should also be detained in some insti
tution for the feeble-minded.
OUR PROSPECTIVE CITIZEN, 0H Ct\\.
AS is known, the Hawaiian Legislature was
elected by the annexation party, and is unani
mous for that policy. It has passed and re
passed, ratified and reratified annexation, and has
threatened to offer the islands in the markets of the
world if a taker is not found in the United States.
Only recently we were assured of the intense anti-
Chinese sentiment of this Legislature and its con
suming desire to welcome the Anglo-Saxon as a
laborer and a citizen.
The Labor Commissioner of California, who made
an official pilgrimage to this shrine of anti-Chinese
opinion, returned reporting the Legislature looking
and longing for white hands in the cane fields and
burning with a desire to send the pigtails back to the
Flowery Kingdom. One would have thought bil
liards taboo in Honolulu because the game is played
with a cue, which might be confused with the Celes
tial queue. All this was profession, but it fixed public
attention in this country and has permitted the oppo
site practice to go on riotously and profitably.
Under the constitution of the Hawaiian oligarchy
there is provided "a Council of State," the analogue
of the Privy Council of the Queen of Great Britain
and Empress of India. These councilors are the ad
visers of President Dole, who seems frequently in
need of advice. These councilors of state are elected
by the Legislature. There recently occurred in this
Council of State five vacancies; why is not explained.
Perhaps they had grown weary advising the President
to keep up a republican pretense in a government
based upon the consent of only 2 per cent of the gov
erned. Anyway, there were five vacant chairs in the
great Council of State, and under the constitution the
annexation Legislature had to fill them. For the
first vacancy Mr. George R. Carter was a candidate.
He is a brother of Mr. Charles Carter, who went out
with the Dole forces against the native revolution in
1895, and was the only one killed. Being the brother
of the only martyr of the oligarchy, Mr. Carter ex
pected to win hands down in the Legislature, but he
didn't. Mr. Ah Chi, a Chinese gentleman, Celestial
from top to toe, smell of punk and nut oil and all,
was presented as a candidate and elected over Mr.
Carter. Ah Chi sits now in Mr. Dole's Council of
State and advises the President. If Hawaii be an
nexed as a county of California we may have him as a
member of our Legislature, or if the State of Hawaii
come into the Union why may not Senator Ah Chi be
sent to Washington?
Whether there is a new heaven or not, annexation
seems to open up a new earth to this country in which
there are great spectacular possibilities, and not the
least among them is our prospective fellow citizen,
Ah Chi.
HARD TIMES AND REVOLUTIONS.
j\A ODERN students of the philosophy of his
/ \ tory are virtually agreed that all revolutions,
* whether political or moral, have been due to
bad economic conditions more than to any dissatis
faction with the politics or the morals whi h they
overthrew. When crops are good, wages abundant
and the means of obtaining a livelihood are within
easy reach of all, the average man will endure almost
anything rather than take the risk of revolt against
the powers that be; but when hungry and homeless
i he is ready to listen to the voice of the agitator and
follow any leader who promises to overthrow the
established order of things and make a new deal.
We had an illustration of the truth of this
philosophy in 1896, when the hard times of the three
previous years produced so much discontent among
! the people that the professional calamity howler had
I an audience in every city, town and village, and when
j the desire of the people for a change was so great
j that large numbers of them voted for what would
I have been a financial and commercial revolution.
j From such an example of what tendencies to revolt are
brought out by hard times even in a country so pros
perous as the United States and among a people so
intelligent, it is easy to estimate how extreme is the
danger to European nations when a season of bad
crops and no wages happen to coincide with the dis
cussion of some political or moral issue which di
vides men into parties or classes.
Europe is just now going through such a crisis.
Bread riots have occurred in Spain and in Italy, and
in both countries the professional agitators and revo
lutionists have taken advantage of them to incite the
people to revolt. The situation is bad in Spain, but
even worse in Italy. Although there is reason to be
lieve that the censorship of the press at Rome has
suppressed as much as possible the truth of the ex
tent and degree of the riots in that country, enough
has been published to make it certain that insurrec
tions amounting almost to the dignity of civil war
have broken out and the very integrity of th^ king
dom is threatened.
The situation is the more serious because there is
every prospect that economic conditions throughout
Europe will grow worse before they become better.
The wheat crop is scarce in all parts of the Continent
To prevent a further rise in the price of bread the
French Government has suspended the duty on the
import of wheat. Germany ' not better off than
France, and according to recent reports the crop in
Russia is so small that trie Government of that coun
try proposes to prohibit the export of wheat in order
that it may retain enough for its own reople.
With such conditions prevailing and such prospects
before workingmen the calamity howlers of Europe
are having a season of triumph except where the
strong hand of Government chokes them off. All
manner of attacks are now being made against ex
isting social institutions. No nation in Continental
Europe is free from them, and in all lands where the
social fabric is not founded deeply on the abiding
sympathies of the people the danger of revolt and
civil disturbance is menacing in the extreme.
Probably had Policeman Murphy discovered any
body on his beat so rich in the symptoms of inebria
tion as he himself the unfortunate would have been
arrested as drunk. Without desiring to prejudice the
case of Murphy, it may fairly be said that San Fran
cisco prefers its guardians to be sober.
The first and best use to make of General Nunez
when San Juan has been taken will be to hang him to
a tree. Such a course would fittingly rebuke Nunez
and render him serviceable as a horrible example.
It is unfair to charge Spanish soldiers with coward
ice because they fled before a mob of women who
were armed with axes and clubs. Perhaps they were
influenced by a feeling of gallantry.
Senator Elkins thinks the Government should sell
the Philippines. Elkins has apparently been even
more prompt than usual in the organization of a syn
dicate.
Italy's riots might almost be dignified by the title
of civil war. So far they have been more fatal than
any actual war now in progress.
THE SA]^ FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 13, 1898.
PATRONAGE OF THE CHARTER.
PROFESSOR JORDAN of Stanford University
on beirtg asked a few days ago what he thought
of the charter soon to be voted on by the people
of this city said:
"I believe that the chief cause of the failure of
municipal government in the United States lies in the
conversion of the public service into patronage to be
distributed among personal favorites and partisan
workers. The proposed charter of San Francisco per
petuates this condition of the distribution of patron
age by individuals and cliques. It, therefore, offers
mighty little promise of reform either in effectiveness
or in economy."
Professor Jordan might have added to this a
further fact. Not only does the proposed charter
perpetuate the spoils system of administering the
municipal government, but it concentrates in the
hands of one official (the Mayor) upward of 80 per
cent of all the spoils. Every vestige of authority has
been taken from the people. The patronage of every
elective office has been reduced to the lowest possible
point, and the patronage of every board or commis
sion appointed by the Mayor increased. All political
power has been centralized in a Board of Public
Works, the Fire and Police commissions. These
three bodies will expend nearly half the annual appro
priations.
Those who intend to vote for the adoption of the
charter on the 26th instant should be advised of their
responsibility. It is for the purpose of bringing home
to the people a realization of the danger of fastening
upon the city a form of government which will re
sult in greater abuses than prevail under the con
solidation act that we urge all intending voters to
thoroughly consider the instrument. In the nature
of things it can make very little difference to The
Call whether the proposed charter is adopted or not.
This journal can exist under any charter, but the peo
ple as a mass are vitally interested. If a great politi
cal boss is created here with unchecked powers the
common people will suffer most. The corporations
and millionaires will be able to take care of them-
Eelves. They are always the last to feel the oppression
of corrupt politics and maladministration.
The proposed charter is the embodiment of cen
tralization. Under a centralized government it is
always easy to put up jobs to rob the public. The
check of diverse interest is absent in an organization
where one-man power prevails. In order to rule San
Francisco completely, should the new charter be
adopted, it will only be necessary for the corporations,
bosses, millionaires and associated villainies gener
ally to combine on a candidate for Mayor whom they
have stripped of his powers in advance. That men
of character can be found to head such combina
tions cannot be doubted. Vide, the blue-blooded Van
Wyck of New York, the willing tool of Boss Croker.
A ShJARP FINISH-
T UST before General Fitzhugh Lee and the
pi American colony left Havana a correspondent
asked a British officer whom he met in that city
for an estimate of the probable duration of the im
pending war. To this question the officer is reported
to have replied, "In my judgment it will take the
United States thirty days to catch the Spaniards, and
then the war will be finished in thirty minutes."
From present prospects it looks as if this off-hand
prediction would be fulfilled almost to the letter.
We have already destroyed the power of Spain in the
Pacific and frightened her Atlantic fleet from the
seas. Our troops are ready for the descent upon
Cuba. Before thirty days from the date of the de
claration of war we shall have caught the Spanish
forces in that island and then the war will be virtually
over.
The stars in their courses have fought against
Spain. Economic distress has been more deadly to
her than American guns, though handled by the
bravest and most accurate gunners that ever went
with a modern battle-ship into action.. The Spanish
people, already dissatisfied with the existing Govern
ment, have been roused to deeper discontent by the
increase in the price of food, and bread riots have dis
turbed the Government as much as the dread of
Carlist insurrection or republican revolts. With no
chance of winning victories to rouse the military
pride of the people, the Queen and her Ministers can
hardly venture to risk a battle on land or sea, and
will be glad to surrender every colony of Spain if
only by so doing they can save the monarchy from
overthrow and the country from a civil strife that will
be very near a war of extermination.
Under such circumstances it is reasonable to ex
pect that the end of the war is near. When it is over
we shall have to engage in the arduous and perplex
ing task of bringing order out of disorder in the
former possessions of Spain which will then be in our
hands. That task will require much more time than
the war. I^i Cuba and in the Philippines everything
is in such confusion that if we should withdraw our
forces at once the result would be anarchy. We can
not in justice so far shirk our responsibilities to the
people of those islands as to permit such an outcome
of our destruction of Spanish power, and to that ex
tent we shall have some problems of the war con
fronting us for a long time to come.
Such affairs, however, are for the future and will
be dealt with as each newly arising emergency re
quires. For the present the one issue is to settle with
Spain as speedily as possible and put an end to war.
This is evidently the administration aims at.
There is to be no delay. The finish will be short and
sharp. The chances are we shall celebrate the com
ing Fourth of July with rejoicings over a war which
has been fought out and won, leaving the people free
to resume the industries and enjoy the benefits of
peace.
According to a Spanish Cabinet officer that coun
try wants peace, but nobody has the courage to ask
for it. As any one making the venture would prob
ably be lynched by the chivalrous populace, this diffi
dence is not strange. It is easier to be a martyr at
the cannon's mouth than at the hands of a mob.
With priests and preachers resigning their charges
so as to enlist, "the peace at any price" people are
losing ground. The pulpit was the last leg, so to
speak, they had to stand on, and, happily, it is
wobbly.
If the Government shall accept as authentic any
news sent by correspondents such as Creelman it will
not only be showing a lack of judgment, but courting
trouble, of which it seems already to have enough.
If Premier Sagasta really declared in favor of
"open, manly and honorable warfare" that grim
looking old man must be even a greater joker than
statesman.
Evidently Blanco when he took the reins of office
got Weyler's typewriter as" part of the necessary
equipment.
Spain's flying squadron seems to be rightly named.
But whither does it fly?

Palace, when the subject of conversation
turned upon the many peculiar charac
ters there are in the world. Mr. Frank
said: "I think we had a notable one of
that class in the person of a man named
Paul Davis up our way. His pecularity
lay in his gift of repartee, and hardly
a day passed but Paul gave expression
to some new phrase that was soon on
the lips of every inhabitant in our local
ity. His* broken English probably served
to add zest to his sayings, and to us he
was as good as some theatrical comedian,
at least.
"One day a member of the tonsorial
fraternity came into Paul's place, and
thinking to 'jolly' the old fellow, patron
izingly said: 'Well, Paul, business seems
to be pretty good with you. How much
money are you banking the*Â» days?'
Paul looked up at his fresh friend and
answered Quietly: 'How is peezness in
der barber shop?' The manuipulator of
whiskers replied: 'Oh pretty fair.' 'Veil,'
said Paul, 'dats all you need to know.'
And this method was effectually used
thereafter to squelch any one of an in
quisitive turn of. mind in Butte.
"When Tom Carter first decided to
make the campaign for United States
Senator, Paul thought it foolish of him
to oppose several millionaire candidates
for the same honor, saying that he had
no show. However some one told Paul
that Carter was going to put $100,000 in
the fight,, and the old man said: 'Ah!
Dat is de reason dey 'choiced' him.'
"But the best joke of all, probably be
cause it was on me, occurred at the time

He was a tenant of mine and was pay
ing me $300 a month rent. I went into
his store one day, and thinking to please
him and at the same time help him out
in his difficulties, I said: 'Well, Paul, I
guess I'll make your rent $250 from now
on.' He did not even give me an answer-
Ing nod, and supposing that ha had si
lently acquiesced I took my departure.
Or. the first of the next month he handed
my collector a check for $200. The lat
ter said: 'Paul, I guess you misunder
stood Mr. Frank. You know he told
you that your rent would be $250.' Paul
replied: 'I didn't misunderstood him. Ha
retooced der rent $50 und I retooced It

OUR WOMEN PATRIOTS.
Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir:
The spirit of patriotism so rife among the
wome ; . of our land, evidenced by their
wearing on their breasts the national
colors in miniature form, is one of the
most hopeful auguries for the future of
the nation. They cannot do the fighting,
but the stamina and courage they impart
to the sterner sex go far toward consti
tuting the latter in the field and on the
sea invincible. It is not enough to say,
on the part of the cynical, that the wear
ing of badges, so much in vogue to-day
among the women, old, middle-aged and
young, of California and all other States
of the Union, is due to their love of dis
play and mania for adornment so inherent
in their nature. No. the cause of it lies
deeper, and has its source in a much more
noble and ennobling passion. They "re
member the Maine," and they also remem
ber how inoffensive women and children
in Cuba have been persecuted, tortured
and ruthlessly butchered by Spain, and
now that Unc\e Sam has torn off the
shackles that bound him and has entered
the arena to battle for the cause of hu
manity and to avenge the dastardly deed
of treachery by the dons in assassinating
266 loyal, brave and unoffending American
citizens while they peacefully slept in
their bunks aboard the Maine as she rode
at anchor in Havana harbor, the humane,
tender-hearted, sympathetic matrons and
.maidens of the land rejoice that American
manhood is at last asserting itself to in
flict righteous punishment upon the cruel
Spa-niards for all their latter-day barbar
ism, and to liberate from thraldom to
Spanish tyranny the courageous, liberty
seeking Cubans.
This gladdens the hearts of our loyal
mothers, wives and daughters, and they
give outward expression to their feeling
by wearing the badge of patriotism. All
honor to them! and may the day speedily
come when they shall be allowed to ex
ercise the highest right of American citi
zenshipâthe right of suffrage.

PRESIDENT JORDAN AND THE
NEW CHARTER.
Kdltor of The Callâ Sir: As gome persons
have misinterpreted â  r. Jordan's written opin
ion on the prospects of the New Charter you
will oblige me by explaining that his letter la
strictly limited to the terms expressed, and
that he was not prepared to give his opinion on
any other point. His letter is aa follows and
speaks clearly for Itself:
J. H. STAX.LARD.
XASMIN HOUSE, Stanford University.
I believe that the chief cause of the failure
of municipal government in the United States
lies In the conversion of the public service into
patronage to be distributed among personal fa
vorites and partisan workers. The proposed
charter of San Francisco perpetuates this con
dition of the distribution of patronage by in
dividuals and cliques. It therefore offers
mightly little l promise of reform, either in
effectiveness or in economy.

THE WAR AND THE EDITORS
The victory won in Philippine waters
will endear the navy more than ever to
the American people, give It a stronger
claim for liberal treatment and insure its
writing another glorious page in Ameri
can history.â Philadelphia Press.
"I can scarcely restrain my joyous
emotions," shouted the Spanish Minister
of Marine when the first misleading
dispatch was received from Manila. And
then Madrid was placed under martial
law. Funny fellows, those Spaniards.â
Chicago Times-Herald.
Not having found it convenient in sev
eral years to say a good word for any
body, the Hon. John James Ingalls is
moved by the Manila battle to acknowl
edge that "Admiral Dewey is worthy of
a place in history." Probably John James
is getting lonesome. â Chicago Record.
"I see by the papers," said the Splendid
Specimen of Western Manhood from Ne
braska, "that one F. Lee has been ap
pointed to a major generalship, but I
can't recall the man. There used to be a
Hung Lee in Lincoln, but they say this
person conies from "Virginia. I will have
to make inquiries." â Chicago Inter Ocean.
In time of war the President is the
United States in person, and accusations
against him are treason. Treason, be
cause every word spoken which will
weaken him personally will make obedi
ence to his orders more difficult to those
who believe that word, and will thus
weaken the power of the United Statesâ
for it is the very keynote of our Govern
ment that it derives its power from the
willing service of free men.â Syracuse
Herald-
What particular objection tho European
continental powers can have to our tak
ing the Philippine Islands is difficult to
understand. We must have a coaling sta
tion in Asiatic waters, and we are entitled
to seize Spanish territory to hold by way
of indemnity. Russia, England and all
the rest of our neighbors know well
enough that we do not desire to annex
islands off the Chinese coast, and there
should not be any question of our bona
fides in the matter.â Washington Times.
To speak of the United States as an un
warlike nation is nonsense, unless it is
meant that we do not make a business of
war or maintain great armies and arma
ments at all times. But we have repeat
edly demonstrated that our citizen s^i
diery can be recruited and mobilized in
times to make it interesting for nations
that have large standing armies. We do
not keep vast standing armies, but our
people spring to arms when there is need
with an alacrity that shows a .strong and
virile character that aspires with good
reason to the hegemony of the world. â

Expert Cyril Williams, Under Direction of
the Board of Supervisors, Exposes
New Charter Finances.
)wing to a Reduction in Salaries in the City
Schools, a Heavy Burden Will Fall
on the Teachers.
On Monday last The Call published a financial statement prepared by
Auditor Broderick showing the probable amount of money which will be re
quired to conduct the municipal government under the proposed new char
ter. This statement, as was said on behalf of the Auditor at the time, was
the result of a careful examination of the books and accounts of his office
and a thorough comparison of the charter's provisions with them.
The Auditor's estimates showed that under the new charter there will be
an annual deficit of $1,121,188. This was predicted upon the fact that the
charter provides a limit on taxation of $1 on each $100 valuation. The Aud
itor estimated the revenue from sources other than taxation upon the fig
ures of the present year, and reached^a total by adding the money yielded
by the dollar limit and that derived from other sources together.
In this way he demonstrated beyond the possibility of a rfoubt that, with
out an annual suspension, by unanimous vote of the Mayor and Supervis
ors, of the dollar limit, the new charter would impose upon the city a finan
cial system of deficits.
Under the direction of John A. Russell, clerk of the Board of Supervis
ors, and Dr. Rottanzi, chairman of the Finance Committe, Cyril Williams,
expert of the Finance Committee, has prepared a similar, though more ex
tensive, statement. Mr. Williams is thoroughly familiar with the finances
of the city, it being his business to expert its books constantly. He has pro
duced, without consultation with the Auditor, almost a similar financial ex
hibit.
The only difference, practically, between the two statements, as will be
seen later <>n. consists in Mr. Williams giving the appropriations for this
yoar credit for Jl:'2,000 expended in back salaries. He thus reduces the an
nual deficit foreshadowed by Auditor Broderick by about $200,000.
The striking fact in connection with these two statements is that they
have been prepared by financial experts who are thoroughly familiar with
the business of the municipality, who, without consultation with each other,
have practically i"ached the same result. The only difference between the
Auditor's statement and Mr. Williams' statement is "that the latter is a trifle
more thorough and exhaustive.
The following is a brief synopsis of Mr. Williams' exhibit, showing in
creases and decreases in the various departments under the proposed
charter:
Increase. Decrease.
Salaries of Supervisors and clerks $7,200
Supervisors' stationery department, two clerks 2,400
License Collector's department (abolished) $35,400
Rewards for criminals (estimated) 5,000
Street sweeping (estimated increase by Contractor
M' -Donald) 60,000
Mayor's contingent fund 1,800
Special fund to be used in constructing new sewer
system 50,000
Appropriation for public grounds and squares 40,000
Salaries and expenses (Mayor's office) 2,580
Salaries and expenses (Treasurer's office) 750
Salaries and expenses (Assessor's office) 11,100
Tax Collector's office ". IS,IQO
Salaries of Coroner's office and deputies 1,200
Salaries of Recorder and deputies 4,300
Reduction in fees of copyists in Recorder's office 12,000
Salaries of court interpreters 1,500
Salaries and expenses of City Attorneys 300
Salaries In District Attorney's office 2,100
Salaries and expenses of County Clerk 20,425
Salaries and expenses of Sheriff 13,680
Jail No. 2 3,400
Jail No. 3 1 1,860
Expenses of Justices' Courts 2,2*0
Salaries and expenses of Police Courts 11,500
Cost of Board of Public Works 30,000
Expenses of Law Library 4,200
School Department 110,000
Salaries and expenses of Police Department 355,696
Police contingent fund 2,800
Expenses of registration office (other than for elec
tions) 5.000
Expenses of Civil Service Commission 7,000
Park Commisisoners 40,000
Salaries and equipment of Fire Department 238,500
The exhibit made by Mr. Williams of the affairs of the School Depart
ment will be interesting to the school teachers. He figures that the aver
age daily attendance of children during the year ending June 30, 1898, was
33,531, which at $2S per pupil â the amount allowed by the charter for sal
ariesâwill yield $938, 865. The amount now paid for salaries of school
teachers is $1,054,920. Subtracting from the charter salaries $27,400 now paid
out of the general fund, leaves the total amount allowed for salaries under
the charter $911,468.
There is therefore a reduction of $173,452 in school teachers' salaries
mforced by the proposed charter. Thus it is seen that the entire reduc
:ion and more made in the expenses of the School Department by the
tharter will fall upon school teachers who will have to be discharged
\o meet the reduction.
The result of Mr. Williams' investigations are condensed in the follow
ing table, which is self-explanatory:
INCOME UNDER NEW CHARTER.
Assessment roll $345,000,000, at $1 on the $100 $3,450,000

THE SAN" FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAX 13, 1898.
LAUGHED FOR THE SAKE OF HUMANITY
PATRIOTISM, enthusiasm and gen
erosity were the shining features of
the benefit performance of the Red
Cross Society at the Orpheum yes
terday afternoon. Although threat
ening weather kept many away,
those who did attend swelled the funds of
the worthy cause by their presence to the
extent of many hundred dollars.
The management labored hard to make
things pass off smoothly and their efforts
were crowned with success. Every artist
and employee of the well-known play
house aided the good work of the society
by gratuitously volunteering their services
and rewarding those present with an ex
cellent entertainment.
Many society ladies and local florists
generously contributed cut flowers, and
a neat sum was realized by their sale
THEY PLAYED AND DANCED AND SANG FOR THE SOLDIERS.
Pretty girls with pleading eyes passed
through the audience disposing of their
wares, netting quite a harvest. There
was an abundance of the sweet-scented
blooms and blossoms, and at the end of
the performance Mr. Kerner successfully
auctioned them off to good advantage.
Owing to the length of the programme
the entertainment was opened promptly
at 2 o'clock by Director Rosner's Hun- j
garian band. The sweet strains of the '
latest patriotic march, entitled "U. 5.," ;
written by Levi, was a pleasing appetizer
for the specialities that followed.
Hayes and. Candy, resplendent in fawn- j
colored vests. "Willie boy" coats and silk
bats, engaged the attention of everybody
by their wonderful dancing. Then came i
W. J. Phillips, who in a Btrong and
musical voice sang "The Stars and

MARSHALL LAW AND
HIS GRIEVANCE
He Missed Three Elections and
Then Said the Ballots
Were Juggled.
Spirited Answers From the Accused
Ministers Wind Up the Episco
pal Conference.
But for the Rev. Marshall Law the
Episcopal Convention would have broken
up with every one on the best of terms;
but Mr. Law had a grievance, and at once
there was trouble.
Bishop Nichols asked if any minister
had anything to say before the conference
adjourned sine die, and, availing himself
of the opportunity. Mr. Law rose and said
he had a complaint to make. He said he
had been appointed one of the tellers and
that while attending to his duties he
missed the elections of three committees,
and so lost his vote. He said, too, that he
did not like the way the names were
printed on the ballots, and Intimated that
there was a "job" in It and that the men
who had that work in charge had buen do
ing politics.
"The committee," he said, "soon learns
to be shrewd, and puts the names of
those men it wants elected at the head of
the list, so the ministers present who do
not happen to be personally acquainted
with the candidates simply mark the
names at the head of the list, and those at
the end have no chance. The ballots
should be printed and distributed
at least a day before the election. This
would, no doubt, make a great deal of
wire pulling, but some of it would be wire
pulling of the right sort. Another thing,
all the names of the candidates should be
put on one sheet of paper, instead of sep
arate sheets, as is now the case, and the
names should be put alphabetically."
These remarks brought W. A. M. Van
Bokkelen to his feet in denial of Law's
charges. To question of privilege, he said:
"I wish to deny the open charge made
by Rev. Marshall Law last evening at the
Bishop's reception. I alone am responsible
for the order of names on the ballot, and
I wish to say that neither Rev. M. D.
Wilson nor Mr. Hooke had anything to
do with It. I tirst put down on the list the
names of the old board that was nominat
ed then the names of the candidates in
the order that they were nominated. I
was charged last evening by this gentle
man with arranging the names and with
being in a clique, and having a prear
ranged decision about which way a favor
ite candidate's name should go. To my
knowledge there has been no manipulation
In the case of a single nominee, and if I
have no knowledge of such work it cannot
be "
Rev Mr. Wilson and Mr. Hooke both
got up in their defense, and also to expiain
how the tickets were arranged.
A motion was made so that in the future
no such accusations might arise, that the
names be arranged alphabetically. This
was adopted by the convention.
Bishop Nichols appointed Rev. J. A.
Emery archdeacon of the diocese, and the
appointment was confirmed by the confer
ence. Most of the day was given over to
the elections, which resulted In the follow
ing men being elected for the year:

Dr. Voorsanger was , then Introduced
and received a glowing reception. In the

thanks for the cordial co-operation in the
work we are now undertaking. It is a
pleasant duty to reward you for your
sympathy by informing you what is

The speaker then went on and told of
the work done by the society in years
past, and what efforts would be used to
save the brave fellows In the army and

Building Trades' Council.
The meeting of the Building Trades'
Council last night was rather quiet, there
being little outside the routine business
transacted. A communication was re
ceived from Iron Moulders' Union No. 286
of Sheboygan, thanking the council for
its assistance in a fight against a bath
tub manufactory in that place, which has
been satisfactorily settled. A resolution
was passed thanking the storekeepers
who have united in the early-closing
movement and promising that labor

with which he performs. It has been
quite a while since the theater-going pub
lic has witnessed such finished work in
his line. Balls, plates, bottles, and in
fact articles of every description were
handled with great dexterity. Needless
to say he was repeatedly encored. Gruet,
Beers and Gruet gave a daring exhibition
of eccentric and grotesque tumbling, and
the Venetian Ladies' Orchestra played na
tional airs on mandolins. Mile. Bartho
made a hit in her toe and fancy dancing,
but won great approval when dressed in
the American flag, with her pretty head
covered with a liberty cap, she gracefully
kept time to a national air.
That old-time favorite, Lizzie B. Ray
mond, sang her sweetest, and warmed to
the hearte of every one with sweet smiles
and touching ballads. A bouquet of
magnificent red roses was handed her at
the end of a song, and she, appreciating
the work of the musicians who accom-
panied her, gave each a bloom as a token
of appreciation of their work. Her im
pulsive action won her another burst of
applause.
Marion Kemer's visions of art were of
fered as dessert to the delicious dishes
that had already been served, and a more
fitting close to a repast could not have
been catered. "An Innocent Victim."
"Plantation Courtship," "Urania," "The
Spring," "The Captive." "Spirit of the

As the curtain was thrown aside disclos

J. F. Moore Assaulted by. Sam Ryan,
His Stepson.
J. F. Moore, living at 44 Russ street, was
taken to the Receiving Hospital last night
Buffering from an ugly wound in the fore
head. Some time ago Moore separated
from his wife. Last night he went to his
home at 762 Howard street, in the hope of
effecting a reconciliation. He was met by
his stepson, Sam Ryan. Trie latter, after
failing to eject him, picked up a lighted
coal oil lamp and threw it at him. The
lamp struck Moore on the forehead, cut
ting a deep gash.
After the wound was dressed by Dr.
Fitzgibbon of the Receiving Hospital staff
he was taken to the City Prison, where he
was charged with being drunk. After
hearing his story, Captain Spillane sent
two of his men to arrest Ryan, but up to
a late hour last night they had not suc
ceeded in locating him. Moore says he
will swear out a warrant for his arrest to
day charging him with an assault with a
deadly weapon.

enshrined on its records, and dedicated to
its work.
It has work now and strenuously
every nerve is strained and every heart
is turned to Its accomplishment. It has
set Itself to this taskâ that before next
Monday it will raise $2000. A portion of
this will be expended in bandagesâ of the
kind which the medical department of
the Government will accept and use, i. c.,
sterilized bandages wound by machinery.
The most of this money to be raised
in Oakland at present is to be sent along
with the boys going to Manila. It is to
be placed in the hands of trusted agents
and members of the Red Cross to whose
care and discretion the responsibility will
be left of alleviating and supplying the
wounded and sick with other comforts
than those furnished by the Govern
ment.
A supply committee has been appointed
; that will receive certain supplies named
; such as wines, brandies, cocoas, etc.; but
; while it is recognized that it may be easier
to furnish supplies than money, it has
i been made clear that with money we can
I surely strike home to the necessity of the
I case, and, therefore, an earnest appeal is
made for money.
The following subscriptions are hereby
: acknowledged: D. A. R. of Oakland, $20;
; Ebell Society, $20; Good Will Kindergar
ten. $2; Mrs. Vernon Jones, $1; M. W. J.,
i $1; C. F. School, $1; Miss Mary Alexander,
i $15; Mrs. William de Fremery, $1; Mrs.
Stoddard, $5; Mrs. Henry Wadsworth. $1;
! Mrs. E. E. Morrison, $1; Miss May Ben
\ ton, $1 70; Miss Louise Hedstrom, $2 50;
Mrs. Albert Miller, $20; Mrs. It. E. Gorrill,
n.
Besides this good beginning, the gentle
men of Oakland are taking a hand in the
matter, and the first to enroll himself to
day is F. M. Smith, with a pledge of $150;
and another, who wishes to be nameless,
has handed the society $100.
The financial committee of gentlemen â
John A. Britton (chairman), I. L.. Requa,
"W. G. Henshaw. P. E. Bowles. H. O.

EXPLANATION.
The arrow files with the wind. The top fig
ures at station indicate minimum temperature
for the days: those underneath It. if any. the
amount of rainfall or of melted snow in inches
and hundredth:- during the last twelve hours.
Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
a!r pressure; isotherms, Of dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high" means high '
barometric pressure and Is usually accompanied
by fair weather: "low" refers to low pres
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure Is high In the Interior and low
nlong the coast, and the isobars extend north j
and south along the coast, rain Is probable; j
but when the "low" Is inclosed with Isobars of |
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is im- ;
probable. With a "high" in the vicinity of i
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected I
in summer and colder weather in winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. May 12.â The natural reaction
from yesterday's buoyant tendency in Wall
street was supplement p<] to-day by some posi
tive elements of depression, and as a conse
quence prices generally ruled below yester
day's level all day. The speculative world ap
parently took a swious view of the affair at
Cardenas. In spite of all assurance that the
]osÂ« incurred was trivia! from a military stand
point the shedding of the first American blood
had a c!f propping influence which no amount
of reasoning could destroy. There was also a
conviction that the Spanish Cape Verde fleet
had certainly returned to home waters. A re
action in Spanish 4's in London and Paris also
dissipated some of the Impression that the re
cent advance foreshadowed a move toward
peace by Spain. The absence of authoritative
reports from Admiral Samppon and his fleet
Induced some hesitation among dealers in
stocks. There was in addition a depressed mar
ket for Americans In London before the open-
Ing- here, and there was free selling of the in
ternational stocks for London account during
the early trading. It was not surprising, in
view of all these conditions, that some of the
recent buyers of stocks should have been In
clined to take profit, and that the bears should
be encouraged to attack the market. Cover-
Ing by shorts In the late dealings overcame a
portion of the losses, but net declines are a
point or over in many of the prominent stocks.
The bond market was less active than yes
terday. Total sales, $3,550,000.
United States new 4's advanced % and Â£he
old 4'b registered % in the bid price. Others
were unchanged.

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, May 12.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram say?: The stock
markets here were fairly good to-day, but less
active and confident. The settlement has been
satisfactorily concluded. Americans were sold
for good offers, but New York appears to ab
sorb all the stock offered.
Spain Is buying:, however, hence the rise. I
understand that the Bank of Paris, which ad
vanced the money for the Spanish July cou
pons, is financing the silver operation. I must
emphasize yesterday's dispatch about the view
of bankers "here relative to the French political
situation in Wept Africa.
The firmness of the London money market is

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, May 12.â Cable advices from
Liverpool available at the opening in the wheat
pit were encouraging to the bulls. Near
futures in the English market showed only a
trifling decline and advances of lV^d in dis
tant futures. In spite of the 4 cent decline here
yesterday. On this news first trades in July
here were at $1 \Z<Q\ 12%, an Improvement of
IViftic. Continental cables and fine growing
weather at the Southwest, combined with a
, continuation of heavy primary receipts, created
i a bearish feeling among the few who ventured
I Into the pit. These bearish features of the
i situation which were lost sight of In the re
i cent excitement supplied the bears with the
ecu: age to oppose the opening upward trend
of prices. The strong party that had for two
or three weelcs played on the fears of the
shorts so adroitly had evidently made their
turn and were well satisfied In leaving the
i market to the "tailers." July shortly after
touching $1 11 and rushing up to $1 12Vi, eased
| off. July declined steadily after the first hour
j to $1 07Ht which was the prevailing price at 12
! o'clock. Then the nervousness of shorts was
clearly illustrated. News of the destruction of
an Ai.mcur elevator by fire caused the bears
to rush July up to *1 10 in their efforts at
covering. M hen it became known that only
lOfl.ooo bushels of wheat was destroyed, the
market Mumped again to $1 08, with %i 08',, the
prevailing quotation at the close. May was
dull and neglected throughout. It opened 14c
lower at $1 65, rallied to $i 70, declined to $1 60,
and closed with sellers $1 65. a net loss of 14c.

GOLD-HUNTERS
Party Which Came Here
on the H. I. Phillips
Disrupted.
Vessel Sold for a Grub Stake
and Some Members Re
turn Home.
Collector of tho Port Jackson and
Lieutenant Buits Once More
Good Friends.
The party of gold-hunters that came all
the way from Gloucester, Mass., on the
er llattie I. Phillips has, after a
of bickering and quarreling.
Its vessel fur a grubstake valued at
11900 and lost its leader. Everything start
;. and would have ended well
had Captain H. Blackburn been allowed
to retain control of affairs; but there were
others in the party who thought they
knew more about the business than he
did, and the result has been as stated.
In miking about the matter yesterday,
I Â11 IMackburn said: "The Idea of
getting up a party in Gloucester to go to
Tiie Klondike originated last October. I
got together a party of twenty, and each
of us put up $300. "With that we pur
chased the schooner Hattie I. Phillips, a
steam-launch and five dories. When we
arrived here 1 found we would have a
long: time to wait before the breaking up
of the ice would allow us to go north, so
â¢we accepted a charter and went to As
toria and brought down a load of lumber.
On our return here we found that three
of our party had come overland, and they
Joined the ship. Among them was W. N.
Grant, and he was a. disturbing element
from the first.
"As the weeks dragged on, some of our
party changed their minds and decided
not to go to Alaska. Then a few others,
headed by Grant, tried to get control of
the vessel; but they failed. Then five
experienced miners from Riverside offered
to join the party, and I suggested that
â we let them in on the same basis as our-
Belves. "fliie majority declined, saying
that the Riverside men ought to pay $100
extra, as it cost that much to bring the
vessel around from Gloucester to San
Francisco. The miners at once declined
to have anything to do with the party.
"As we would have no use for the
schooner after reaching St. Michael, we
had been trying to sell her, to be deliv
ered, after we reached our destination;
a there were no vessels going out
Beaming â and that was alfl.he Phillips was
suitable for. there was nÂ»demand for her.
The North American Company did want a
vessel, and would have paTd at least $4000
for the Phillips, but the majority of our
people held out for $6000. I knew we
could not get any such money as that
for her, so I made arrangements with ;
Cassidy and Snow to trade the vessel for !
a grubstake if the worst came to the :
worst.
"When everything: appeared to be
pretty well straightened out one of the
men refused to let his share go for a
grubstake, and entered his protest at the
Custom-house. That matter was straight
ened out, and then two more protests
were filed by members of the crew. They
were finally persuaded to turn over their
Interest in the vessel, and yesterday I was
at last able to give Cassidy & Snow a
clean bill of sale."
Mr. Cassidy of Cassidy <Sr Snow says
that whate\ er he has done for the gold
hunters has been done because of his
friendship for Captain Blackburn and
that he depended on him wholly and sole
ly for the proper transfer of the vessel.
Many of the party are much opposed to
the new leaders and several of them have
cold out, while others are trying to do so.
3n consequence, if the Hattle Phillips
gets away it will not be a very happy
party which will gro north on her.
The friction between the Collector of
the Port and Lieutenant Butts of the
revenue cutter Golden Gate has been
smoothed over. When Boarding Officer
Shepman and Quarantine Officer Rose
nau had a clash on board one of the
China steamers. Lieutenant Butts sided
In v>-ith the doctor and declined to put
the customs officers on board incoming
vessels until after they had been passed
by the quarantine officers. About ten
days ago he put his edict into effect and
the Custom House officers Immediately
hired a Whitehall boat and went out to
the German bark H. Hackfeld. When
Collector Jackson heard of this he was
very indignant and at once placed the
revenue cutter Hartley in commission.
Captain Montell, who was formerly cap
tain of the Hartley, but who some time
ago passed hl3 examination and has since
been acting as inspector of customs, was
placed in command of the little cutter
and two crews were hired to assist him.
For over a week the Hartley carried the
Custom House officers out to all incoming
chips and put them on board whenever
the captain of the watch said so. During
that time the Golden Gate lay at the
wharf with steam up night and day, but
not once was she called upon. The mat
ter was finally adjusted yesterday in an
amicable manner and the Hartley was
put out of commission and the Golden
Gate was again doing duty at the old
Btand.
The schooner Charles Hansen, which
Started for Alaska last Wednesday, was
compelled to put back to port. She had
tho stern wheel steamer Agnes Boyd on
her deck, but when the schooner got out
Into the heavy weather the steamer broke
away from her lashings and the captain
thought it better to put back. The deck
load will be restored and the little steam
er more securely fastened and the Han
een will then make another start.
Sergeant Jack Hayes, who for the last
four years has made a most efficient
head of the State harbor police, has
resigned, his term of office having ex
pired. Henry Petersen, late purchasing
agent for the Harbor Commissioners, has
been appointed to fill the vacancy.
The gilding of the ball on the top of the
ferry depot flag staff attracted a great
deal of attention on the water front yes
terday. The pole, is 2SO feet above the
street, and at that elevation the daring
painter looked like a puppet. He hauled
himself to the top of the pole by means
of the flag halyards, and while doing the
jrtb was the most unconcerned man on the
The United States training ship Mohi
can arrived from Honolulu yesterday. She
left here two months ago for a cruise in
the southern seas, and under steam and
eail Bhe took thirteen days to come back.
All the youngsters on the Mohican are
very anxious to be sent to the front.
When they obtained files of the papers
containing accounts of the war it was
with difficulty that discipline could be
maintained, as the boys were more than
anxious to read the accounts of what was
going on. The training ship is anchored
off Folsom street, but the chances are
that she will go to the navy yard to-day,
and that the able seamen on her will be
transferred to the Charleston.
TO PROTECT THE FORESTS.
A Move to Make the Mount Lassen
District a Reservation.
The subject of forest preservation was
discussed at the meeting of the State
Board of Trade on Tuesday, and as a result
President Chipman was directed to pre
pare a petition to the General Land Office
at Washington asking the Government to
set aside as a forest reservation a large
portion of the country adjacent to Mount
Lassen, or the Lassen Buttes, in Tehama
County. The memorial will recite that
the country in question, or much of it, is
within and near the snow line and cov
ered with dense forests. While these re
main as reservoirs of moisture the many
stieams that have their sources in that
pait of the mountain range will be kept
supplied. In future years these streams
will be the source of many valuable Irri
gation canals to water the lower country.
At the present time the sheep and lum
ber men are causing the forests to dlsap
and great damage will result to the
Slate in the future.
The board decided that the manager of
the Alaska Trade Committee branch of
'he body should not list any vessels on Its
bulletin boards for Alaska unless the j
BAY CITY WHEELMEN'S RELAY TEAM.
The team of the Bay City Wheelmen that won the 100-mile relay race on Sunday has already disbanded. Fur
man has gone to Los Angeles, Peck to Tuba City and Noonan to Santa Rosa. Before they separated the above
picture was taken by Bushnell.
In the photograph Harry Fowler, rider of the first relay, is seen in the upper row in the white suit on the
left. Next comes W. J. Black, eighth relay; Frank G. Peck, fifth; W. G. Furman, tenth, who practically won the
race defeating Wing and Smith in the sprint. Next is John L. Davidson, seventh relay; R- J. Black, ninth
relay and George Felix, second relay. On the lower row from the left are Ben J. Raynaud, fourth relay; Ben
Noonan, third; Harry Larkin, captain of the club and team, and Walter J. Davidson, sixth relay. "Mike," the
club's bulldog mascot, and the trophy won by the team are In the foreground.
same had been favorably passed by tho
: underwriters. The president was In
: Mructed to appoint five delegates to the
International Mining Congress that will
meet in Salt Lake on July 6. 7 and 8.
A request was made that the board send
i's entire local exhibit to the Omaha Ex
position but the directors decided that
owing to the lack of money the project
was not advisable. George T. Trobridge
of Sonoma reported that the grain crop
of that county will not be more than
two-thirds of the usual yield. The in
< reased acreage of cereals, however, will
make up the average output. The fruit
crop will be as good as in ordinary years
and the orehardists expect to make at
least one million dollars out of the crop.
I H. Thomas of Tulare County reported
that the entire grain crop Is a failure
there. The fruit yield will not be more
than one-twentieth of the average, except

REVIEWING THE CHAETER.
Speakers for and Against the Pro
posed Fundamental Law.
The Mission League of Improvement
Clubs held a special meeting last night at
Mannerbund Hall, on Twenty-fourth
street and Bryant avenue, for the pur
pose of discussing the charter. Presi
dent T. B. Slevin of the league stated
that the debate on the merits of the char
ter would be confined to two speakers
on each side, with a limit of twenty mir
utes to each speaker. M. C. Hassett and
Max Popper argued for the charter and
James E. Field and H. Meyers opposed
them.
Mr. Hassett began with a general
resume of the many ills under which the
people of this city are suffering in conse
quence of the workings of the too oft
amended consolidation act. By adopting
the charter, he said, all of these ills
would disappear and the body politic
would become thoroughly purified.
James E. Field responded in a telling
argument, showing the many absurdities
of the proposed charter. The taking
away of the people's rights and concen
trating them in one man, he said, was
both un-American and contrary to pub
lic policy and good government. It gave
' the "Lord Mayor" the right to Impeach
elected officers and have them tried by
a court of his own. the Supervisors, thus
supplanting the real courts of their ju
dicial authority by removing men from
office without due process of law. Again,
it made life members of all "Lord May
ors," of the Board of Supervisors, and
j placed them In a position where they
; could lobby bills and schemes without be
i ing responsible to the people for their
acts.
H. Meyers followed Mr. Field and
punched as many holes through the work
of the fifteen Freeholders as his prede
cessor had done. He denounced the civil
service section as building up a privileged
class against the masses.
Max Popper followed, supplementing
Mr. Hassett's exposition of the evils to
be removed with a recital of the benefits
he said would follow the charter's adop-
tion.
The people listened to the debate good
naturedly without giving any expression
of opinion as to how they shall vote when
the time comes.

FRIENDSHIP SEVERED.
Troubles of Dancing Master Colvin
and Mrs. Alma Wallin.
The charge of threats against life pre
ferred by Mrs. Alma Wallin, 506 Jones
street, against Fred H. Colvin, a dancing
master in the Mission, was partly heard
by Judge Low yesterday.
Mrs. Wallin testified that she contrib
uted money to start Colvin in the danc
ing business and she was to share in the
profits. After ?ix months he quit calling
on her. and when she went to his dancing
academy to demand her share of the re
ceipts he threatened to shoot her. She
had altogether advanced him about $400.
The defendant testified that he had
plenty of money when he met the widow.
They were good friends for awhile, a^a
then he came to the conclusion that she
was not a proper person to have around
the academy, so he discharged her. He
had been paying her $1 per night. He
denied owing her a cent or threatening to
shoot her.
Several other witnesses were examined,
and some of them testified that Mrs.
Wallin had threatened to kill Colvin.
On motion of the prosecution the case
was continued until Tuesday to enable
witnesses in rebuttal to be produced.
Fan Tan Games Raided.
The new Chinatown squad under Ser
! geant McManus raided two merchants'
I clubs last evening and captured forty

1 sion to the clubs, caught the gamblers at

FLORAL BEAUTIES
ON EXHIBITION
Magnificent Display of Roses
and Carnations at the
Show.
Some Choice and Bare Specimens
Contributed by Out-of-Town
Amateurs.
The frost and the drought have not
killed the roses. They bloom In all their
glory at the rose show, making Golden
Gate Hall a bower of beauty and scent-
Ing the May air with their sweet, clinging
perfume.
Like its predecessors, the fifteenth semi
! annual exhibition and rose show of the
California State Floral Society is a mag
nificent success. Professionals and well-
I known amateurs, both local and out-of
i town, have added to the exquisite and*
wonderful ensemble. ' "^- V.^j.
Sievers' display is a thing of surpassing
I beauty. It occupies the entire rostrum,
and easily ranks first even in comparison
with the many other handsome exhibits.
In the display are roses, carnations
eluding the new burnt orange and curious
i deep lavender bloomsâ and a. multitude of
exquisitely tinted pelargoniums. Â:
Another pretty professional display is
that of Demota Bros., the Japanese grow
ers across the bay. Their exhibit re
sembles a tiny bit of forest, potted plants,
palms and ferns being principally shown.
i A Japanese magnolia and Japanese maple
are among the curiosities of their exhibit.
The conservatories of Golden Gate Park
have added to the beauty of the show,
contributing some flowering shrubs and
brightly colored calardiums.
A remarkable display of long-stemmed
i American Beauties is made by Pellicano.
The exhibition made by amateurs testi
fies to the success of the object of the
Floral Society, which is to promote ama
j teur culture. Mrs. George C. Ross of Bel
mont has an unusually fine display of pel
argoniums and panstes. Mrs. Tricon
shows fifty varieties of cacti, and Mrs.
Llewelling of Haywards has a fine exhibit
of peonies, clematis and azaleas. Both

CURT AILMENT NOT DESIRED.
Merchants Do Not Want the Letter
Delivery System Interfered
With.
The regular meeting of the board of
directors of the Merchants' association
was held yesterday. Wilfrid B. Chap
man, C. M. Foster & Co., M. S. Grinbaum
& Co., Limited, and George Marcus &
Co. were elected to membership. A tele
gram was received from the Merchants'
Association of New York calling atten
tion to the Senate amendment of the post
office bill limiting free deliveries in all
cities to four times daiiy. As this amend
ment would also curtail the postal service
In San Francisco and cripple its facilities,
the board of directors adopted resolu
tions against the proposed reduction.
The board decided to advocate strongly
the sprinkling of the streets and flushing
of the sewers with salt water. Directors
Grant, Keil and Sherwood were appointed
a special committee to investigate this
subject further and report to the board
what action should be taken. It was de
cided to investigate the cost of lighting
public buildings; also to recommend to
the Board of Supervisors that the con
tract for furnishing light to the city be
made for one year instead of two years,
as heretofore. Rapid progress was re-
Eorted upon the repaVement of cobbled
locks. A number of blocks on Post
and Stockton streets, together with cross
ings, have been repaved and are now â¢-â
good condition. Contracts for the re
pavement of blocks on Fourth, Sutter
California and Pine streets, Grant avenue!
Montgomery and Sixth streets have near
ly been completed and will be let as soon
as the funds of the city are available for
that purpose.

HONOR BALBOA AND DEWEY_
Pacific Parlor Wants One of the More
Important Streets Named
After the Admiral.
The following self explanatory commu
nication has been sent to the Board of
Supervisors by Pacific Parlor, N. S.
G. W.:
Gentlemen: The proposed action of your
honorable board to change the name of Balboa
avenue to Dewey avenue, as a tribute to the
great admiral, coming to the knowledge of Pa
cific Parlor No. 10, Native Sons of the Golden
West, the parlor heartily endorses the patriotic
sentiment that prompts your body in befltting
ly recognizing the marvelous achievement of
the distinguished hero of Manila, but at the
same time deplores blotting out the name of
one hero for another, and respectively suggests
that while we honor Dewey let us continue our
reverence for Balboa, and to this end the par
lor adopted the following resolution:
Resolved, By the members of Pacific Parlor
No. 10, N. S. G. W., in meeting assembled,
in conformity with the principles of its organ
ization, that we request the Board of Supervis
ors to preserve the nanje o* Balboa avenue as a
tribute to the brave navigator of a past genera
tion who discovered the mighty ocean whose
name our parlor bears, and on whose shores
our great city is located: and be it further
Resolved, That the name of the Illustrious
Dewey be given to one of our more conspicu
ous streets, so that his achievement in up
holding American arms and protecting our
coast from foreign invasion may be fittingly
honored by a grateful people.
With high respect, I am. yours irvly.
DANIEL A. RrAN.
President Pacific Parlor No. 10, N. S. G. W.
PURE FOOD MOVEMENT.
Senator Perkins Co-operates With the
Manufacturers and Producers.
On May 4 President Sbarboro, of the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Associa
tion, forwarded a tek-gram to Senator
Perkins suggesting that in amending the
revenue laws in compliance with the
necessities of the present war, that a
light tax be placed upon pure products
and a heavier tax upon those that were
mixtures or substitutes for the genuine
article. The following letter from Wash
ington was received yesterday:
I am In receipt of your telegram giving reso
lution sufccestlng a lighter tax on pure food
I products than on adulterations, and have sent
! copies to members of the delegation, as re
i quested, and also to the Senate Finance Com
mittee that are now considering the bill.
Yours very truly, GEORGE C. PERKINS.
The prompt attention given to this mat
ter by Senator Perkins is very gratify
ing to the friends of the pure food move-
I ment, and it is to be hoped that some
plan be devised by which the manufac
turers and producers of honest goods
may be protected by the National Gov
ernment.
TILTON'S BIG FEE.
The Street Committee Recommends
Its Payment Despite Mayor
Phelan's Veto.

The claim is for preparing pians of a
Bewer system south of the park and is in
addition to $9000 already paid Tilton for

PRAYS GOD TO
BLESS FABIOLA
Rabbi Levy Writes of the
Virtues of the
Ladies.
Was Pained When He Read of
the Criticism of Rev. Dr.
Dille.
Society Will Turn Out and Will
Use Nothing but Ribbons for
Decorations.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 12.
Rabbi M. S. Levy of San Francisco,
who was a few years ago in charge of the
First Hebrew Congregation of this city,
has written a letter to the Tribune de
fending the ladies of. the Fablola Hos
pital Association against the criticism of
Rev. Dr. E. R. Dille. Rabbi Levy says:
I was somewhat surprised and pained to read
the prelude of the Rev. Dr. Dille to his sermon
Sunday evening wherein he made, to my mina.
a most unwarrantable attack upon the man
agers of the Famola Hospital because they pro
posed to accept the receipts of Derby or Poly
clinic day at the Oakland race track.
I think that the manner of condemning the
act, which is a charitable one, is very un-
ChriÃtianlike and very ungenerous. If sucn
places aud such games deserve the poignant
criticism of the pulpit, then they must be taken
alone and apart from any charitable motive
such as the noble women of Oakland intended
this to be. , ..
For the past few seasons the leading ladles
of Oakland conceived the idea of Increasing
the funds of the hospital by having a Derby
<i a y_ an d personally I have the highest regard
and respect for each and all of them, and can
find only words of commendation for their
efforts and zeal in the humanitarian cause they
give both of their time and substance.
I have known these women long and well,
and had often cause to learn of their good
works, and to feel that my own people have at
times been benefited because of the kindly and
sympathetic love they bestow upon the sick
and needy.
The Fabiola Hospital has, since Its incep
tion, been sustained and superintended only
by those of unassailable character, and I can
recall now members of my own faith who
found it a pleasure as well as a duty to re
member the hospital substantiai-v in recogni
tion of the good work. A work so nobly con
ceived and so honorably executed should not
be censured for adopting Derby day.
Although not residing in Oakland at present,
I was for too many years among her people
so soon to forget them and their good work,
and I cannot help but retain that loving kind
ness in my heart for all her people, but espe
cially for those good, unselfish women who
have worked hand in hand with me, and who
have exerted every fiber of their soul to sus
tain that beautiful charity that they do, the
emblem of which is Fabiola.
It is therefore to be deeply regretted that
anything should have been said for the purpose
of decrying the method employed for replenish
ing the depleted treasury of the Fablola Hos
pital : equally as pernicious and quite aa de
moralizing are church fairs and the numerous
games of chance they encourage. I wish the
ladies of Fablola every success, and pray that
the blessing of God may rest upon their un
selfish labors. Respectfully yours,
M. S. LEV?.
The ladies have decided that there shall
be no flowers in the decorations for
Fablola Derby, the ornament being con
fined to ribbons of different colors as fol-
lows:
Fabiola colors, white and blue; Derby
day, red; racing association, orange and
black. The following ladles have ex
pressed their intention of turning out at
the track: Mesdames I. L. Bequa, F. M.

FOUR MINISTERS RESIGN.
Sagasta's Plea for Them to Remain
Temporarily of No Avail.
MADRID, May 12.â 11 p. m.â lt Is
said that Senor Moret, Secretary for the
Colonies, and Senor Gullon, Foreign
Minister, have resigned. Admiral Ber
mejo, Minister of Marine, and Count
Xiquena, Minister of Public Works, are
also said to have resigned.
The retiring Ministers offered various
excuses, such as illness and weariness,
for their withdrawals. Senor Sagasta
begged them to remain until the in
demnity bill had been passed, but It is
believed at to-night's Cabinet council
the resignations became definite,
though it is impossible to verify the
exact situation at this hour.
11:30 p. m. â It turns out that Admiral
Bermejo, on learning of the Cavite dis
aster, told Senor Sagasta that he must
resign, owing to the delicacy of his po
sition, though he felt that he was not
responsible for the state of the defenses
of Manila. Senor Moret pleaded wear
iness and Count Xiquena illness.
According to the last forecast the
new Ministry will consist of Senor Sa
gasta as President, Senor Croissard,
Minister of Justice of the dissolving
Cabinet, as Minister of Foreign Affairs;
Senor Aunon as Minister of Marine;
Senor Romero Giron as Minister of
Justice, and the Duke of Veragua, the
descendant of Columbus, as Alinister of
Public Works.
The new Cabinet will probably be
constituted Saturday. The general
opinion is that it will endure until the
budget is passed and collapse with the
first opportunity afterward. The
changes, however, are pacific in ten
dency, Senor Gullon having been the
most warlike element in the dissolving
Cabinet.
The whereabouts of the Atlantic
squadron still remains undivulged, the
Ministers refusing to give any informa
tion on the subject.
Official dispatches from Havana con
firm the reports of an American repulse
at Cienfuegos. They assert that the
firing lasted eight hours, and that the
American losses were heavy. Accord
ing to these dispatches great enthusi
asm prevails in Cuba.
Owiner to the increased price of food
there have been serious disturbances at
the Rio Tinto mines, Province of Hu
elva. The rioters wrecked the octroi
office and sacked a number of tobacco
stores. The military now occupy the
whole mining: district.
At the Cabinet Council this afternoon,
the Queen Regent presiding, Senor Sa
gasta, the Premier, reviewed the situa
tion and the latest war news. A second
council was held to-night.
ANOTHER TRANSPORT
FOR THE PHILIPPINES.
Steamer Pakshan Will Carry Troops
to the Islands on Her Return
From Alaska.
VANCOUVER, B. C, May 12.â The
United States Government has all the
week been negotiating with the Wash
ington and Alaska Steamship Company
with a view to chartering their steamer
Pakshan, en route here for the north,
to carry American troops to the Phil
ippines. The matter was kept very
quiet, as the Pakshan, which got here
last Monday, has aboard quite a num
ber of passengers and 109 head of pack
horses and mulee. Day after day the
passengers, who began complaining
about the unusual delay, were put oft
with various excuses, and finally
threatened suit against the company. A
notice was stuck up that the vessel
would sail at 9 o'clock to-night
Frank Burnett, associated with the
local manager here, then gave out that
while the vessel would make the trip
north, she had been chartered by the
United States Government to carry
troops to the Philippines. She is a
splendid steel steamer of about 3000
tons and will carry 500 or 600 people.
Her record is fourteen knots. When
the passengers, many of whom are Ca
nadians, learned that they had been
delayed at Uncle Sam's pleasure, they
raised a big row and several threat
ened damage suits against the com
pany. The Pakshan leaves to-night
and will return in about twelve days.
REORGANIZATION OF THE
PERSONNEL OF THE NAVY.
The House Committee on Naval Af- ;
fairs Has at Last Completed
the Bill.
WASHINGTON, May 12.â The Com
mittee on Naval Affairs of the House
to-day completed the bill for reorgani
zation of the personnel of the navy.
The personnel bill has been quite as
vexatious .-.s the appropriation bill it
3elf on account of the strife of the dif
ferent corps of the navy to promote
their interests.
Hilborn, who has been present at
every meeting of the committee and
has presided much of the time ex
presses himself as fairly well satis
fied with the bill. For several sessions
he had measures before Congress to
give the enMsted men the right of re
enlistment after + hlrty years' service, a
privilege long since given to the en
listed men of the army and marine
corps. He has also steadily advocated
giving commissions to warrant officers
after ten years' continuous service.
In the framing of the personnel bill
he has been the champion of the sailors
and warrant officers. He succeeded in
engrafting his bill for re-enlisting the
sailors without amendment. Under the
! bill as reported, warrant officers will
I get commissions after ten years' ser
vi,e, but are subject to examination
upon promotion.
FOR COAST DEFENSE
VESSELS AND CREWS.
Two Important Emergency War
Measures Are Passed by the
House.
WASHINGTON, May 12.â The House
to-day effected but little legislation. An
Important measure providing for the
organization of a special line of coast
defense vessels and the enlistment of
men adequate to man them was passed.
The Senate bill to establish a volunteer
signal corps was passed without
amendment.
These two emergency war measures
were the features of the session. The
House adjourned at 4:18 p. m.

LONG SHOTS
UNDER COVER
Still Coming the Favorites'
Way Over at Oakland
Traok.
Wheel of Fortune Beaten
Easily by Acrobatic
Argentina.
A Bad Start Caused the Defeat of
CanÂ«oo-Toluca Has Lost None
of Her Speed.
One or two of the races at Oakland
yesterday wore . a cut-and-dried look
noticeably those taken by Argentina and
Rose Maid. However, the season is draw-
In" to a close and these pantomimic re
hearsals will have to be digested. The
favorites again shared most of the hon
ors short-priced ones in the betting es
caping with four "long ends." _
According to recent "dope" the Baldwin
mare Argentina II looked a "moral" for
the mile-aml-a-quarter selling run, for in
her previous essays she finished last on
two separate occasions. No doubt that
was the reason the mare was played
down from 6 to 4 to 1 to beat Wheel of
Fortune. The latter opened at even
money and receded to 8 to 5. The out-
Eider, Devil's Dream, led the bunch to the
stretch, where Argentina assumed the
front position and won easily in -:09.
Piggott came with a very tardy and ill
timed rush with the favorite, taking the
place from Devil's Dream. :
The sturdy Polish was pounds the best
of the eleven starters in the opening
seven-furlong run or he would never have
secured the long end of the purse. Sent
to the post a 2-to-l choice, Frawley got
him pocketed half a dozen times, but
finally extricated his mount in the run
home and won ridden out, a head before
the 10-to-l chance Hermanita, which must
have passed an evening at home, judg
ing by her improvement In speed. Peix
otto, heavily backed, was a good third.
A band of cheap ones lined up in the
five-and-a-half-furlong scramble, second
on the card. Rose Maid, with Thorpe in
the saddle, ruled a pronounced choice in
the betting and won all the way. En
trata took the place from Brown Prince.
Nick Hall's fast and game piece of rac
ing machinery, Canace, was a strong fa
vorite for the four-and-a-half-furlong
spin for two-year-olds, but was beaten
by the start. Ferguson permitted oods,
on the Burns & Waterhouse entry. Bane
wor, to beat the gate fully three lengths,
nnd the advantage thus gained allowed
her to beat the first choice a head.
The second four - and-a-half - furlong
sprint for members of the two-year-old
division proved an easy thing for Toluca.
The filly appeared for the first time in
the colors of Sam Hildreth. and. going
to the post a 7-to-10 favorite, caught Mag
dalenes in the stretch and downed the
flying daughter of Emperor of Norfolk as
feho pleasod. Bonibel finished a fair third.
In the final mile selling run Soscol closed
a slight favorite over Octuruck. After a
very tempestuous voyage McDonald, on
the first choice, managed to get out of
the numerous pockets he found himself
In and, in a mild drive at the end, led
Charlotte M out a neck.
TRACK NOTES.
The early run of "lobsters" has caused quite
a. boom In the bookmaklng market. Fifteen
dealers staked out prices yesterday, and a man
who never saw a horse race before in his life
marveled at the lack of speed shown by to
short a priced horse as OJai.
The win of Rose Maid furnished an oppor
tunity for Covington & Kent to draw down
their first purse of the season.
Any time that Dan Honlg wishes to dispo*'?
of the services of Jockey Miller the talent in
general will offer no objection. The bey's
handling of Caspar was a rare piece oi
stupidity.
If some Eastern man could get tin recipe
used on the Baldwin horses and a case or two

OPENED UP WITH
BOXING BOUTS
Inauguration of a New-
California Athletic
Club.
Gore and Grit and Howls of
Appreciation Aid in the
Success.
Hayes, Carroll and O'Meara Olvon
Decisionsâ Mulligan Gets Â»
DrMW.
"Hayes Is der winner," the referee said,
and howls of glee greeted the just de
cision.
It was at the California Athletic and
Swimming Club's flstic entertainment
that Mr. Hayes was crowned victor over
a stocky-built young lad named Meyers
after he had laid him low with v stiff left
on the point. There were other fights,
but Hayes' victory aroused the most en
thusiasm.
The Callfornlas celebrated their open
ing with four six-round contests, and 700
representatives from every portion of the
city traveled to the clubrooms at 1106
Golden Gate avenue and helped fill the
badly ventilated arena with cigarette
smoke and lusty shouts. The gathering
was an orderly one and was there to see
gore, and it was not disappointed.
Master of Ceremonies Johnson intro
duced Meyer and Hayes as the first con
testants in the first bout, and it proved a
"Corker" while it lasted. Meyer opened
up fast, and in the first halt of the round
had Hayes dizzy. The latter gained a
little time by long-distance sparring, and
then, seeing a good opening, sprang in
with a straight left, which he used to ad
vantage, completely turning the tables. In
the second round Meyer tried to even
things by fast work, but the deadly left
was again put in operation, and he was
knocked to the floor. He arose, and
pluckily hammered his man, but was
hammered in turn. Exhaustion got the
better of the two, and they stayed off to
"mend bellows." Hayes started the ball
rolling with a left swing on Meyer's jaw,
and, following up his advantage, got the
decision by knocking his man to the
canvas.
JJahl and Carroll furnished entertain
ment in the next bout. The boys were
willing and for six rounds spilled each
other's gore, made wild swings, clinched,
had each other groggy in turn and in fart
put up a gritty exhibition. Carroll was
awarded the decision, having done the
most leading. More howls.
McGinniss was a chopping block for
O'Meara, and at the end of the fifth round
the latter was awarded the decision.
"Me," although having one eye closed
and suffering other contusions, disgusted
ly kicked at the untimely interruption.
O'Meara proved a stiff puncher and Mc-
Ginniss a gritty recipient. O'Meara was
Justly declared the winner.
The last bout of the evening furnished
food for reflection and some warm fight
ing. Charley Kochette was slated to
meet "Kid" Carson, but the latter did not
appear to carry out the programme. Some
were unkind enough to say that he had
cold feet, but his substitute was a worthy
one. He was red-headed and his name was
Mulligan. Besides possessing red hair,
Mr. Mulligan had a shifty left and right
which Rochette found to his sorrow be
fore many rounds. Rochette looked big
ger and was more experienced, but the
lad from the Mission showed grit and
punching powers. He not only stayed
with Rochette the whole distance, but
gained a draw after six rounds of hard
pummeling. The decision gave universal
satisf action. Rochette gained no friends
during the bout, as he resorted to foul
tactics in his anger.
Other friendly bouts were furnished by
Schuler and Perry, Sullivan and O'Con
nor, Schroeder and O'Brien, Toy and An
derson, and Flynn and little. Mr. Kelly
sang and Professor Richard Walsh played
a few musical instruments.
The club has lately been organized, with
the following officers:

MORE MONEY FOR THE MASONS' COFFERS.
THOSE unfortunates left fatherless
or husbandless who know not the
comforts of life will soon be pro
vided with a cheerful home. The
tide of prosperity still flows on at the
Mechanics' Festival, and each day and
night sees thousands of friends of the
poor congregated within the walls of
the festal hall. Last evening the
largest crowd that has visited the fete
â¢w-aa present and an excellent pro
gramme was rendered.
The booths that are now attracting
the most attention are those of Ivy
Chapter, California Commandery No. 1
and the Postomce. California Com
mandery's contains a handsomely dec-
orated refreshment parlor and a gay
little theater. The booth is in charge
of Mrs. Logan, Mrs. Dorn and Mrs.
Batkin, and in an energetic way they
are piling uf> the coin for the home
fund. The Postofflce is one of the most
handsome booths in the Pavilion.
Ladies robed in white, bearing white
doves on their heads, go forth from this
booth and reap a harvest of coin that
will go far toward comforting the poor.
The booth is a true representation of a
postofflce. A street lamp and mail box
are the most prominent features in the
foreground, and behind this is the
office. A train of cars apparently run
ning at full speed and a ship in the dis
tance plowing the sea-s complete a
handsome picture. A handsome organ
presented by Kohler & Chase is the
attraction at Ivy Chapter. All of the
ladles are anxious to obtain the organ,
and a rushing business in raffle tickets
Is in consequence being done.
King Solomon's booth is also one of
the most popular spots in the pavilion.
There the wheels of fortune turn mer
rily away on their mission of mercy,
each turn bringing in its gold, and on
the east side many attractions are
clustered which will be raffled at the
close of the fair. Among the most strik
ing is a hat valued at $50, which was
placed at the disposal of the manage
ment of the festival by Mrs. Alma
Keith. The hat takes the eye of the la
dies and is bringing in its full share of
the fund.

NOT JURORS
NOW, BUT
ANGRY MEN
Judge Belcher Issues
a Terse Order of
Dismissal.
Consigns the Members of
the Grand Jury to Pri
vate Life.
They Hold an Indignation
Meeting in Their Old
Rooms.
CHARGES AGAINST DUNNE.
BÂ«rnea and His Assistant Accused of
Impeding thÂ« School
Investigation.
The Grand Jury, of which the public
had been led to expect so much, no longer
exists.
In response to the citation issued by
Superior Judge Belcher, the members as
sembled in his courtroom at 2:30 o'clock
yesterday afternoon, and Judge Belcher
asked Foreman Gerberding if he had any
report to make. Upon the latter reply
ing that he had none, the Judge read the
following terse order of dismissal:
In the Superior Court of the State of Cali
fornia, in and for the City and County of San
Francleco â In re Grand Jury.
Gentlemen of the Grand Jury: The law re
quires that two Grand Juries be impaneled In
this city and county in each year, and the rule
of the court la to impanel the first Grand Jury
of the year at about this time and the second
Grand Jury some time In the latter part of the
year, according to exigencies. You were Im
panpled In the month of I>f-cembÂ»r, 1897, and the
time has now arrived to draw and impanel a
new Grand Jury. For these reasons, and for
other reasons satisfactory to the court, you are
now discharged without day.
EDW. A. BELCHER, Presiding Judge.
May 12, 1895.
As soon as the Judge had concluded,
James O'Brien, a member of the late
Grand Jury, arose:
"If your Honor please," be began, but
got no further, for the Judge interrupted
sharply:
"I do not carÂ© to hear anything from
you, sir."
That ended the court proceedings. The
members filed out and went to their old
rooms, where they held an indignation
meeting, at which Judge Belcher, Dis
trict Attorney Barnes and his assistant,
Joseph Dunne, came in for a round of
abuse. O'Brien was accorded the privi
lege of first addressing his associates.
O'Brien was chairman of the Harbor In
vestigating Committee, and he took oc
casion to pay that the ferry depot scan
dal had never been placed before him
for investigation. He wanted to ask
Judge Belcher If certain statements at
tributed to him in an evening paper were
true, but the Judge had seen fit to de
cline to listen to him. O'Brien denied the
assertions and was backed up by his as
sociates.
A. B. Truman made a hot speech, dis
tributing his attention equally between
Judge Belcher, District Attorney Barnes
and Assistant Dunne. He said Barnes
and ever, the Judge had failed to furnish
certain information the Grand Jury asked
for, and the District Attorney "was rep
resented by a drunkard." Witnesses had
been frightoned by misrepresentations
ami had been given to understand that
they would not be protected. Every time
tho school case had been taken up some
trivial affair had been crowded in to block
the investigation.
"WÂ« know that influence has been
brought to bear on every member of this
body to stop this investigation," he said.
"Why is it we could not carry it on? Be
cause we were discouraged by the obsta
cles placed in our way by the'Dlstrict At
torney's office, which tried to prevent it
by every means. The member of this
Grand Jury was called a blackguard by
a politician of this town, and it was
Judge Belcher's duty to punish the of
fender, but he failed to do so. We de
layed action on the ferry scandal in order
to have Barnes assist us personally, but
he refused to do so."
John Daly said: "The members of this
Grand Jury have worked hard and ear
nestly, but they were handicapped, first,
by the foreman, who was anxious not
to serve and always In a hurry to get
away, and, second, by the District Attor
ney's office. Barnes has disappointed
us repeatedly, while the Board of Educa
tion nas had an attorney present at our
meetings from start to finish in the per

afternoon and evening was exception

tracted the audience; but the feature
went to Judge Belcher and said: 'The
boys are in a hole and we must get them
out. The push is up against it hard.
Dunne has not been honest and never will
be. I don't know how honest Belcher has
been in this matter.
"During the investigation into the
school scandal a gentlemanâ good as
any In San Francisco â came to me and
asked what we were going to do with
Inspectors O'Brien and Swift. I told him
I did not know, but it would probably go
pretty hard with them both. Then this
man said: 'Don't be too hard on O'Brien.
He is a good fellow and is only acting
under instructions. He has a family and
has to do as -he is told to hold his posi
tion.' 1 replied that the best way for
O'Brien to save himself would be to go
before the Grand Jury and tell everything
he knew, giving the names of the guilty
parties and everything else in connection
with the affair.
"O'Brien's friend agreed with me, and
said he would urge O'Brien to do as I
suggested. I firmly believe O'Brien would
have come forward with a full confession
had we been allowed to go on."
Speeches in a similar vein were made
by Messrs. Warfleld. Minnie, Bauer,
Thornley, Meyer, Spear and others, after
which the meeting broke up.
Last evening H. A. Hedger, a member
of the deposed Grand Jury and chairman
of the Street Department Committee,
gave the result of his investigation into
the affairs of that office. With the aid
of an expert he had gone over the work
of reconstructing the 16-inch iron-stone
pipe sewer in Baker street, from Fran
cisco to the bay, a distance of five blocks.
The work was begun last January and
completed in April. The material used
cost $326 16 and the labor $4181, not includ
ing the wages of an expert for four
months at $4 a day. The sewer cost the
city $5 a foot, which would have been suf
ficient to build a brick sewer 3x5 feet,
complete.
â¢What puzzled Mr. Hedger most was the
large number of bricklayers and hod
carriers employed in constructing a pipe
sewer. For instance, in February the pay
roll shows that three, four and five brick
layers worked a total of forty-eight days
at $5 a day, and about the same number
of hodcarriers at $3 a day were on the
roll.
Many other jobs of a similar nature
were investigated, and Mr. Hedger was
preparing a report to the full Jury when
it was dismissed. ,

LINDA DI CHAMOUNIX.
Grand Italian Opera Sung by the
Ziliani Musical Society.
The Bush Street Theater waked from its
long slumber last nfeht to listen to Doni
zetti's "Linda di Chamounix." The the
ater was filled with people fond of Italian
opera and proud of the Ziliani Musical So
ciety. There were flowers for the favor
ites and liberal rounds of applause.
Mrs. Evolyn Winant Dickey, who played
the title role, has a very true, sweet
soprano. Miss Lillian "Wilson's voice is
unusually full and strong, and musical,
and she sang the famous contralto role
charmingly. Alfred Borlini has ability
as an actor. His Antonio was particular
ly pleasing.
The celebrated soprano aria in the first
act, the duet between Antonio and tho
prefect, and the prayer finale were among
the best numbers of the opera. The
chorus of fifty voices is well trained and
effective, and is unique among operatk 1
choruses for its fresh, pretty faces and
unhackneyed interest in and enthusiasm
for things musical and histrionic. There
is good material in Professor Ziliani's
society, which does credit to his train
ing. There are some members of the
"Linda dl Chamounix" cast who are al
most strong enough artistically to quit
the amateur's chrysalis. Persistent study
and serious devotion to music would
transform these, in time, into free
winged, professional butterflies.
SHORT ON GRAIN BAGS.
Limited Demand at San Quentin by
the Farmers.
James H. Wllkins, of the State Board
of Prison Directors, has made some in
teresting calculations regarding the loss
to California by reason of the present
dry season. Speaking on this topic: yes
terday he. remarked: "At .this season of
the year in ordinary ' times orders are
lodged at the. San Quentin jute .mills for.
35,000,000" grain bags, but the, orders re
ceived up to the present do not call for
more than 3,000,000 bags. This shows a
falling off of 32,000,000 bags. Calculating
that each sack holds grain to the value
of $2. it may be figured readily that is a
prospective decline â¢amounting to $64,000,

losses in other ' than' the wheat crop, and
mentions a falling off in the orchard

BONDSMEN MUST PAT.
Judgment by Default Against the
Sureties on the Bonds of Coun
terfeiter Curverson.
T T nlted States District Judge de Haven
yesterday ordered judgment by default in
the case of the United States vs. W. A.
Dawes. A. W. Robinson and A. W. Cur
verson for $2500, being the bonds on which
Curverson was released from custody
after his indictment by the United States
Grand Jury for passing counterfeit half
dollars in Eureka. Humboldt County. An
execution will be levied at once on the
property of the bondsmen.
This is the case in which the bondsmen
filed a demurrer, alleging that Alexander
Campbell Jr., an attorney, had by means
of false representations induced them to
go on Curverson's bonds, he being a
stranger to them. The demurrer was
overruled and they will be called upon
to pay.

"Explaining" to Leg
islators.
Reasons for Charging Vast
Sums to the Contingent
Fund.
HOW TO REACH THE TIMID
A Profitable Deal in Fuol That Was
Not in Accordanoo With
Law.
C. P. Huntington Is a firm believer In
the efficiency of long and continued la
bor. He thinks vacations are the in
ventions of lazy men, and should have
no place in the lives of men of affairs.
While waiting for the beginning of
his examination before Commissioner
Heacock yesterday Uncle Collis was
moved to refer to the subject of vaca
tions. He delivered himself in this
wise:
"One of our men came into my office
to-day and asked for a vacation. He
said he had been working steadily for
seven years and had not had so much
as two weeks' vacation during that pe
riod. I told him I had been hard at
work for sixty-three years and had
never had a fortnight's vacation dur
ing that time. I could not see that he
had any cause for complaint."
What the other man thought Is not of
record.
During the afternoon Judge Hayne
secured some valuable information
from the witness regarding the manner
in which great corporations influence
legislative bodies, the cost of this deli
cate work being charged to contingent
expenses. Other matters having par
ticular reference to the manner in
which the affairs of the Central Pa
cific Railroad Company have been con
ducted at the expense of the public and
the great profit of the witness and his
associates were touched upon, but
Huntington's faulty memory prevented
him from going into details.
"Is it not a fact," asked Judge Hayne,
"that in the original contract between
the Central Pacific Railroad and Wells,
Fargo & Co.'s Express Company there
was a clause in which the railroad
agreed not to engage in the express
business and not to employ any other
express company for a period of ten
years?"
"I believe there was some such agree
ment. We promised to protect them
against other companies engaged in the
same line of business whenever we
could do so legally. We never under
took to do anything illegal."
Judge Hayne then attempted to get
some information regarding the
finances of the Contract and Finance
Company.
"The late Senator Stanford testified
before the Pacific Railroad Commission
that at the time of the completion of
the Central Pacific Railroad the Con
tract and Finance Company owed sev
eral millions of dollars. Is that true?"
"That is very indefinite. It is my im
pression that the company owed some
thing more than seven million. I am
not sure about the amount, but that is
my impression. I kept the memoran
dum in my hat, and the exact figures
have slipped my mind now."
"I suppose the books of the Contract
and Finance Company would have con
tained the information if they had not
been destroyed, would they not?"
"Possibly they would. I am not sure
as to that. As to the books be
ing destroyed, I know nothing
about that. I never saw them. The
nearest I ever came to seeing them was
several years after the business of the
company had been closed. We wanted
to clear out the room where the books
were kept and Hopkins suggested that

THE IROQTJOIS HONORED.
The Name of the Patrol-Boat Fearless
Changed at the Bequest of
the Club.
The name of the tug Fearless, that was
purchased by the Navy Department a
few weeks ago to be converted into a
patrol-boat, has been changed to Iroquois.
The change was made at the request of
the Iroquois Club, and In acknowledg
ment of the honor given that organiza
tion the members of the club propose to
present the vessel with a silver service.
The managers of the Tivoli Opera House

among them will be a naval battle scene
between American and Spanish vessels.

the Lane lectures for the year this even
ing at Cooper Medical College. "What the
X Ray Has Done for Medicine in the Past
Year" will be his subject. The lecture
will be illustrated.
the easiest method of petting rid of
the books would be to burn them. But
'I do not know whether his suggestion
was carried into effect. As far as I am
concerned I wish they were still in ex
istence. I should like to see them and
I should like for you to have a look at
them."
"Don't you think those books are still
In existence?"
"I don't know, I'm sure. If they are,
I have been unable to locate them. I
wish I were sure about it."
Huntington admitted that the Con
tract and Finance Company received
for the work of building the Central
Pacific all of the Government subsidy
and all of the bonds and stock of the
road, and at the time of the comple
tion of the work the road owed the con
struction company pnmethingmore than
$6,000,000. The latter debt was liqui
dated, he Baid, by the issuance to the
construction company of bonds on the
land grant to the amount of $7,000,000.
He also said that the work of building
the road was hurried to completion be
cause o-f a desire to accommodate the
people of California and secure a great
er volume of trade for San Francisco,
and not for the purpose of getting
hands on as much of the Government
subsidy as possible.
"Does the Rocky Mountain Coal Com
pany supply the CentraJ Pacific and
Southern Pacific roads with coal?"
"It supplies the Central Pacific and
occasionally the Southern Pacific."
"What is your connection with the
coal company?"
"I am one of the stockholders in the
company."
"You are also a director of the Cen
tral Pacific road and president of the
Southern Pacific, are you not?"
"Yes."
"Then how do you reconcile your acts
with that section of the constitution of
the State of California which says
'No president, director, officer, agent or
employe of any railroad or canal com
pany shall be Interested, directly or In
directly, In the furnishing of material
or supplies to such company' "?
"Well, that don't seem to be very
definite, and I never paid much atten
tion to it. At any rate, I did sell fuel
to the roads, and if there was anything
to be made out of it I made it."
Huntingdon related at some length
how it was necessary to spend consid
erable sums of money each year in or
der to properly "explain" things to
members of legislative bodies. He said
it was frequently neeesary to hire the
constituents of Congressmen and Sen
ators to do such "explaining," because
it was Impossible for strangers to ap
proach sufficiently near to allow of con
fidential Intercourse.
"Some men," he said, "are very care
ful of their reputations, and that is per
fectly right. Tt may be that their repu
tations are somewhat tender and will
not stand much bruising. A great deal
of money used to be paid out here for
this purpose, but I put a stop to that
some years ago."
This admission regarding the use of
money in San Francisco and California
afforded an excellent opportunity for a
line of examination that would "be pro
ductive of some Information of real local
Interest. Had he been asked to tell, the
witness would no doubt have given the
inside history of how thousands of dollars
of hush money had been transferred from
the treasury of the railroad company to
the coffers of a certain San Francisco
newspaper that makes a specialty of pa
rading its virtues before the eyes of the
public. The witness would also have re
lated, no doubt, how this same newspaper
had for years levied blackmail on the cor
poration. It is quite possible that some
Information might have been gained re
garding the sums that have In the past
been expended in corrupting courts and
the State Legislature. But Judge Hayne
allowed the opportunity to pass, whether
intentionally or otherwise did not appear.
At any rate the opportunity was one of
a hundred similar ones that have come up
during the present examination without,
apparently attracting the attention of the
able gentlemen who are conducting the
inquiry.
The examination wtll be continued
to-day.
LOVE'S DREAM SHATTERED.
Mrs. O. E. Hubbard Wants J. E. Tib

RED MEN ARE
TO CELEBRATE
Will Turn Out in the Fourth of
July Parade One Thou
sand Strong.
To Honor the Fiftieth Anniversary
of the Founding of the
Order.
The Improved Order of Red Men of San
Francisco and Alameda and their aux
iliary, the ladies' branch, known as the
Daughters of Pocahontas, are making ar
rangements for a grand celebration on
the Fourth of July in honor of this being
the jubilee year of the order, it having
been in existence fifty years.
A short time since, at the instance of
Montezuma Tribe No. 77 of this city, a
call was issued for a convention of dele
gates from the tribes and councils of
this city and those of Alameda County
for the purpose of making arrangements
for the celebration, and there was a good
attendance at the meeting. A number
of committees, each to perform certain
functions in order to bring about the
general result, were appointed, the fol
lowing named composing the general
committee: C. F.Burgman, Mrs. Annie E.
Bishop, H. T. Hutt, W. J. Robinson,
Frederick Brandt.
At a subsequent meeting it was decided
that the celebration should be a division
of the Fourth of July parade and to be
composed entirely of members. of the or
der. From present indications, based
on promises made in tribes and councils,
it is expected that the division will have
in It 1000 Red Men. There will be floats
on which will be presented historical
scenes of the history of the North Amer
[ ican Indians. There will be a company
[of about one hundred members in Indian
costumes, representing warriors and
chiefs, and in addition the members of
the order will parade wearing the attrac
tive regalia. The members of the coun
cils will not only add to the attractiveness
of the parade by their presence, but they
will make a grand display at the ball to
be given in the evening in Native Sons'
Hall.
F. A. Whlpple of Fort Bragg, the great
sachem of the reservation of California,
has invited Robert T. Daniel of Griffin,
Ga. , the great incohonee of the order, to
visit California in time to take part in the
celebration.
BOAT SIGHTED BOTTOM UP.
Bark S. C. Allen Sees a Derelict
Thirty-six Miles West of
Point Reyes.
The bark S. C. Allen, which arrived at
this port yesterday sugar laden from
Honolulu, reports sighting a boat bottom
up about thirty-six miles west of Point
Reyes. It was 2 o'clock Thursday morn
ing when the lookout discerned the boat
drifting close to the bark. A3 near as
he could make out the derelict was be
tween twenty and thirty feet long, about
eight feet beam and was painted either
black or brown.
The description fits one of the many
fishing smacks that ply their trade in
these waters, and although the fishermen
have not as yet reported any of their
number as missing it is highly probable
that another accident has befallen one
or more of them and the poor unfortu
nates have gone the way of many of
their companions.
No further information was obtainable
from the Allen, as she kept her course
and the upturned boat passed on and
finally disappeared from view.
Benefits of 8.-ing a Pauper.
Lee Wong, a Chinese convicted a few
days ago of selling a box of unstamped
cigars, was sentenced yesterday by
United States District Judge de Haven.
Malvern M. Foote made a plea for mercy
on behalf of the Mongol, who, he said,
was a poor man without money to pay his
counsel, and who was ignorant of tho
complicated system of American internal
revenue laws. The court remarked that
there was no minimum punishment In
such cases. The statute prescribed a
maximum penalty only, a fine of JoO or
imprisonment until paid. This sentence
would make of the prisoner an inmate of
the City Prison for life were It not that
the law allows a defendant in such cases
to take the oath of a pauper, which will
set him at liberty after thirty days' im
prisonment.
