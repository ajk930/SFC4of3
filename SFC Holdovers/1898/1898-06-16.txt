A Noisy Demonstration as the
Soldier-Laden Vessels Start
for Manila.
BY ALICE RIX.
THE second Manila expedition Is
gone to the front. The China,
Colon, Zealandla and Senator ride
the high seas to-day. Utah, Colo
â¢rado and Nebraska have followed
California to the Spanish port. Five
thousand more of our men are out to
help Dewey, to help defend the flag, to
help remember the Maine.
â¢ â¢ At half-past one o'clock yesterday
' afternoon the transports sailed. The
'.rnorning was sultry. The sun burned
behind a milky haze. The bay, in vast.
soft Ehadow, looked like a smoked
pearl. Over It rleamed the colors of
' the mosquito fleet. The big ships
' evung at anchor waiting on orders de
â '" laved. Tugs rocked sleepily at th'-!r
. docks waiting on the same. The small
fry flitted over the water waiting for
â¢nothing. The crowd gathered on the
piers waiting for anything. Riggings
fluttered with national and signal col
. ore. Men and women wore little flags
â¢ pinned to their breasts. Children
â¢waved the stars and stripes. The
bands on the water played "Dixiej'
and rt The Star-r-pangrled Banner."
"Yankee Doodle" and "When We V\ ore
Marching Through Georgia."
A girl's voice picked up the chorus
on the water.
-^ "Htirrah! Hurrah!
We sinK the jubilee."
The men on the China heard and
answered.
"Hurrah! Hurrah!
The flag that made us free!"
The sound floated back faint and sad
to the shore.
The China lay off Howard street, the
Zealandia by the Potrero. the Colon

The last of her supplies lingered until
this morning and she was loading up to
noon. At the eleventh hour, before
departure, the cork helmets, for which
her troops had waited, looked and
lonped, arrived in packing boxes three
feet square, and with a cargo bulging
over the hatches, she could not take
them aboard. It was plain that if cork
helmets went to Manila they must go
on the heads of the men. There was
a quirk smashing of cases on shore, a
distribution of helmets aboard and the |
Senator's men came up under them like |
a crop of mushrooms on her decks.

Barton and the Herald carried the j

"Good-by. Three cheers for the Red

The Ukiah, laden to the water's edge, j
plodded heavily up and down the
stream. Smart little private launches
slipped across her bows, light skiffs and
wherries shot along her sides. Tugs
cast their lines and fussed out into the
stream. The bay took on a frivolous
regatta gayety which belied the heart
beating beneath. A band played on
everything afloat. There were songs,
shouts, cheers, the hiss of steam, the
! scream of whistles, the rush of waters

Under Sentiments o f Hate and Terror for Spain on tbe Part of Residents

States.
CARACAS, Venezuela, June 15.â Cuban and Porto Rican residents of
Caracas are very active and very numerous. They publish a strong paper
here in the interests of "Cuba Libre" and have been very useful in the way oi
giving information to the American Minister, F. B. Loomis. The? brought the
news that certain Spaniards here are planning to attack the American lega
tion, which caused the Venezuelan Government to set a strong guard there.
Yesterday the Cubans sent a committee to the United States legation to
tell the Minister they desired to present him with an engrossed memorial for
President McKinley and a handsome silk flag for the legation. Mr. Loomis
declined a public presentation of the flag, on the ground that such an incident
would tend to unduly inflame the Spaniards and make more onerous the task
of the Venezuelan Government in preserving order. The memorial will be pre
sented privately to-night and forwarded to the Washington Minister.
The natives of Porto Rico have sent a petition to Washington through
the legation of the United States here which is very important. The leader of
the Junta said to me this evenings . .
*Â»We want the Government d! the United States to realize fully that it it
desires the island of Porto Rico it will find the people of Porto Rico more than
willing to be under the protection of the great republic. I have recently come
from Porto Rico; I know that under the sentiments of hate and terror, in
spired by Spanish rule, there exists everywhere outside Spanish circles warm
friendship for the United States and the hope that the island will be
annexed."

were pitched besiclo the Western water

inclined tenderly even to strangers.
They cut the buttons from their coats,

As Royal a Farewell as the
California Boys in Blue
Received.
Gayly Dressed Bay Craft Escorted
the Big Troopships Out
to Sea.
BY HENRY JAMES.
A FEW weeks ago Ban Francisco
sent forth upon the Pacific her
own soldier boys. It was my
privilege to see them go, and to
pay perhaps some measure of
tribute to them and to an occasion so
august. Their farewell had been mag
nificent, nobody expected there would
ever be another like it. There were
tears then as well as cheers, and it
seemed that the heart of the city had
been profoundly moved not alone by
patriotic ardor, but by the sorrow of
sundered ties.
Yesterday there was another time of
good-by. Â«Once more the bay was alive
with darting craft, with the well-be
loved colors; whistles shrilled an adieu,
flags dipped gracefully, over the still
waters of the bay there floated the
sound of music, the voices of women;
again there were flowers, the exchange
of tokens, and after it all four great
ships sailed through the Golden Gate,
and the second expedition for Manila
was on the sea.
There was only one difference. Peo
ple have become accustomed to the
thought of war. Yesterday there was
as marked a heartiness" tn the greeting
and the parting, but the tone of sad
ness was not to be observed. The sol
diers laughed gaily and their visitors
laughed back. They tossed compliments
and bouquets, but none was seen to
weep. The common bond was the flag
and its honor. These men, going to dis
tant lands, were strangers but a brief
span ago. Now each has become a
friend. They*foregathered from Colo
rado, from Pennsylvania, from Nebras
ka, but since their feet first pressed
California soil it has been a delight to
honor them, and to the last, until the
smoke of the bearing them away
had changed to a cloud in the west, and
iPRICE FITE CENTS.
a fog had barred the Golden Gate be
hind them, this was the spirit which
ministered to them. The; appreciated
it. Did they not shout their gratitude?
Did not they hurrah for the Red Cross?
Who missed a view of the scene can
learn little of its majesty and Its sweet
ness by any written description. As a
whole it was impressive. In detail it
was full of little incidents, each one a
story. I was glad to observe the re
gard in which The Call seemed to be
held by the soldiers, and that their de
votion to Alice Rix was almost worship.
Whenever the staff tug drew near to
one of the liners there would be a very
shower of good will, taking the material
form of cards decorated with national
emblems, buttons, badges, anything 1
that could be adapted to the sudden
emergency. One boy froi- Colorado â I
wish I knew his name â could not find a
moderate way in which to show his
sentiments. Perhaps his supply of but
tons had been exhausted. He took from
his vest a gold watch, and saying it
was for Alice Rix, dropped it into the
tug. There could have been no refusal,
as just then the tug was cast off. For
the remainder of the trip Mrs. Rix wore
suspended in plain view one certain
hunting case watch, distinctly mascu
line as to size, and her pride in it was
considered justifiable. I wish to thank
the soldier for her and to tell him that
his gift shall be treasured until such
happy day as he may call for it.
Through the night and thÂ» morning
the ships had rested in the stream, all
of them but the Senator. The last was
at the doclc until a few moments before
starting on its long voyage. From 10
o'clock the "Blue Peter" had been fly
ing at the prow of the China. The flag
ship was ready to haul up anchor. Far
up the bay the Zealandia waited, the
smokestacks showing that it was ready2
for the signal. The Colon was also
prepared to steam away. But during
the period of waiting the bay was a
living picture. Every wharf was
crowded. Tugs and launches, ferry
boats and Whitehalls scurried about,
every one gay with color, and from
each coming a chorus of good-bys, a
strain of melody, while handkerchiefs
and flags wore waving and nodding as
might the flowers in a garden when
swept by a breeze. And fairer than
the Hags were the women who Haunted
them.
As the moment of starting ap
proached the clamor grew. Bands
could be seen playing. As well might
the instruments have been dumb. A
naphtha launch, decked to the peak
with banners, raced by, devoting much
of its power to the production o-f noise,
and every craft sought to imitate it.
The trim little Transit appeared with
its decks jammed, each man with a hat
on high, each woman with the red,
white and blue displayed. The Ukiah,
unwieldy but speedy, fairly black with
people, circled about, and each time it
got near a transport drowned all but
its own tumult. So it was everywhere.
The boys of the other States go-t a
parting salute as ringing and sincere
as fell upon the ears of California's
sons.
Up near the Union Iron Works the
noise was a marvel for volume. The
great whistle there dhi its best to sub
due and humiliate all the others.
Imagine a lost soul doing its wailing
by steam and you have a fair idea of
this whistle. But for all the uproar,
the nicety of dodging, the close shaves,
there was no accident worth mention
ing. One schooner did drift almost
down against the China, and while the
spectacle served to divert and make a
pretty scheme for the artist there was
neither danger nor alarm. On the^yards
of all the transports, dizzily high above
the decks, tin* sailers were ranged, and
they stood there silhouetted. â¢ While
the decks wore so crowded that it
seemed none could be below, faces
peered from each portholeâ smiling,
happy faces- -and shouted messages
â¢ bounding across: "Don't forget
Colorado!" "Three cheers for Ne
braska!" "Just tell them that you saw
a boy from Pennsylvania!" And it's
hurrah fur all of you, and we won't
forget any of you, and may God keep
you.
But the Senator gives three warning
toots and slips from the dock. The
Nebraskans fill her to the rail. No
jollier lot ever set out on the fission
of war. They wear cork hats, which
make them look like animate mush
rooms, and swing them in the air until
One thinks a trip to an alien shore
must be a thing of joy. Far above a
balloon sails almost motionless. The
boys catch sight of It and cheer. They
â would cheer two balloons. They have
cheers to spare.
The moving of the Senator was the
signal for a movement all along the
line. There was a rattle of anchor
chains, a renewed storm of sound from
uncounted whistles. Far uptown the
BignaJ was repeated and echoed back
from the hills. From the tall and dis
tant building where The Call cannon
Bays hail and farewell a puff of smoke
Issued out on the haz^. Those who
happened to see it and listen could
single out the report. The majestic
march to the open sea had begun. The
China led, followed by the Zealandia,
with the Senator next and far in the
rear the Colon. From every funnel
poured a cloud of smoke black as night,
and the ships seemed to. cleave the wat
ers with a conscious pride. The scene
had been one of life; it changed to one
of actual grandeur.
Imagine a land-locked bay over
which pass and repass countless craft,
on one side a great city crowning the
hills, the wharves at its water front
crowded by cheering thousands. Im
agine th^se little craft, each decorated
to the top by Sag and streamer, cluster-
Ing about four black-hulled ships filled
with Boldiers. Then think of the four
getting in motion, straightening out for
th<- Pacific, which can be seen through
a rift guarded on either Bide by forts
or giant guna on the heights, and the
brood which has been hovering about
starting after them and trying to keep
the pace of the vast machines. Bear in
mind that as the parade starts the
throng gesticulates and shuuts, that
the flag is dipped in salute. Bear in
mind that the spray is flying, the
fog lowering, th^ wind from the ocean
beating each, riag until it quivers
on the JJole. Think what the event
means to the soldiers, to those who fol
low, to the multitude straining their
from every eminence. Remember
the cannon at Alcatraz and at the out
posts are speaking their mightiest
tones, and that the smoke of the guns
mingles with that of the ships' glowing
furnaces until with the shifting
clouds it forms a banner draping the
bky. and leaves lj.-hind a trail of ebon,
while the foamy wake of the quartet
tosses the boats which hurry after so
they plunge and lunge and seem to
trifle with threatened destruction.
Trace the picture so far that the little
boats turn back from the fierceness of
the ocean swell and the transports car
rying the armed men of the republic
vanish in the mist and the distance,
for a space, four points of somber dark
against the horizon, and then gone and
away. Such was yesterday's moving
picture and its setting.
It happened that I was on the Reli
ance, a swift :nd powerful tug. It has
a facility for getting where there
seems necessity for it, and so those
aboard were able to > be close to the
transports. Indeed, we made fast to
both the China and Zoalandia, and it
was in the former instance that there
was a rain of tokens, including a gold
COLONEL HAWKINS TO THE CALL
The Commander of the Tenth Pennsylvania Expresses His Apprecia
tion of the Hospitality of the Golden State,
watch. Many letters were thrown to
us to be mailed, telegrams to put on
the wire, words of mouth to convey.
The tug kept with the China almost to
the Heads, and then taking an officer
from the flagship, went back to see
what ailed the Colon, lagging behind.
Before we reached the Colon the trou
ble was over. But in the interval the
China had stood out to sea, so the offi
cer had to be nut on the Zealandia, and
the chances of his getting access to his
own toothbrush this side of Honolulu
are not promising.
Al the Reliance came in some looked
back toward the Pacific. Over its face
a veil had been drawn. Not even a
shadowy suggestion of the four ships
met the eye.
FAREWELL SALUTES
FROM BAY AND SHORE
Multitudes Assemble to Bid God

It was not yet 6 o'clock when a gen
erally dilapidated individual ambled
along the docks to the Folsom street
bulkhead. Picking out a spot on the
stringer he adjusted his back to the
side of a Whitehall boat on the dock
and hauled out of his pocket a piece
of paper containing two crackers â evi
dently rescued from the gutter â a piece
of offensively odorous cheese and a pic
kle; the last two surreptitiously ob
tained from a lunch counter.
He was not ravenous, at least he did
not attack the morsels with the haste
one might expect, but instead he nib
bled daintily and slowly, being care
ful, though, not to waste a crumb. Be
fore his breakfast was concluded the
dilapidated individual was joined by
another of his species, who seemed

somewhat disappointed at finding -the
choicest seat on the bulkhead occu
pied, but contented himself with growl
ing out some remark about hoping his
neighbor had not camped there all
night. The second arrival was not
equipped with breakfast, but this lack
of oversight did not cause him any un
easiness, and soon the two were dis
cussing the war in general and partic
ularly the marine spectacle that had
routed them out of their nests in the
hay at such an early hour.
Though these two had passed years
on ihe water front and had witnessed
every event of importance on the bay
they were keenly alive to the unusual
event that was scheduled for the day
and were determined not to miss an
incident attending the departure of
troops for the Philippines.
There were many more, not of the
same station as these outcasts, but as
eager to witness the display, and an
hour after the first comer had settled
himself for the day the docks in the
vicinity of Mission Bay, where three of

i the transports were anchored, were
lined with people of all ages and 'both
Soon the launch of the naval reserve
Bhip Marion darted around the end of
j Folsom street pier and bumped against
I the float at Peterson's boathouse. One
i of General Greene's aids, who had re
i mained ashore all night, and two priv
i ates, who had gone astray when their
troop ship dropped into the stream,
boarded the launch and off it puffed to
the China, swinging at anchor in the
stream.
From that time on the scene was of
steadily increasing interest, while the
crowds grew in proportion. Other
docks not so favorably located now
held their contingent of sightseers,
among whom the blue uniforms of sol
diers compelled to remain yet a time
longer at Camp Merritt were plenti
ful iy sprinkled.
" V 7 hen the Marion's launch returned
it Drought ashore several officers who
skurried off uptown the moment their
feet touched the dock. People bearing
packages of every shape and deserip
tion besieged the office of the Spreck
els Towboat Company, anxiously in
quiring if there was any means by
which they could send parting gifts to
friends among the soldiers on board.
These packages were placed on board
The Call's launch Amy, which made a
tour of the transports at 9 o'clock,
leaving on each ship a supply of Calls
for the soldiers and those who had pre
ceded them on the first expedition.
When the Amy returned she brought
several officers and a great pile of let
ters sent ashore by the men on the
transports to their friends at home
last messages for months.
The Marion's launch was as busy as
a bee dancing back and forth between
the ships and the dock. On one of her
early trips she brought Brigadier Gen
eral Greene, the commander of the
forces, who proceeded to General Mer
ritt's headquarters to receive his final
orders. Officers and orderlies hurried
between the headquarters and the
landing place, and everything indicated
the early departure of the fleet.
Over at Broadway dock the Senator,
with the First Nebraska Regiment on
board, still lingered, while an immense
crowd gathered on the neighboring
docks and bulkheads. Afar off on Tele
graph and Russian hills other crowds
were hurrying to points of vantage,
while out in the bay small craft of
every description and gay with bunting
paraded before the envious eyes of
those on shore.
The shipping in the stream and
alongside the docks "dressed ship" In
their brightest colors, and it was sig
nificant that the great still vessels fly
ing the crimson of St. George vied
with the American hulls in decorating
for the occasion.
General Greene and his adjutant
drove down to the Senator and ascer
taining that she was ready to proceed
instructed her commander to remain at
the dock until the China hoisted the
"blue peter" and then to drop into the
stream and take her position in line.
The general then boarded the launch
and made a tour of the three ships in
the stream, after which he went on
board the China.
At Folsom street The Call's tug, Re
liance, bedecked fore and aft and over
head with signal flags, awaited the ar
rival of its corps of writers and artists
and invited guests and when finally the
lines were cast off and the Reliance
backed away from the dock a mighty
cheer went up for The Call. The Re
liance, like the Amy, carried many
packages and missives to men on the
different ships, and a stop was made ai
each transport to deliver the token?
collect the last letters and receive fare
well messages from the commanding
officers.
All eyes on shore were trained on the
China, and when suddenly a flutter ai
the fore, the signal for the ships to get
under way, was observed it seemed as
though Bedlam had broken loose.
Thousands of people howled like de
mons, while every steam whistle in the
town as well as on the bay sent up a
piercing salute.
The Senator at the signal pushed out
from the dock and steaming ma
jestically along the harbor front cir
cled around astern the China, which,
by that time, was under way, followed
by the Zealandia. There was some de
lay in getting the Colon under way and
signals were run up which the China
answered, but finally her mud hook
bobbed above water and the last of the
troopships headed for the Golden Gate.
All along the seawall, Meiggs wharf
and the hills in the background were
alive with people, whose cheers swept
faintly over the water and were ans
wered â cheer for cheer â by the boys in
blue.
Fort Mason saluted with eleven guns
and as the fleet approached the gate the
big guns at Fort Point boomed out their
farewell. The fog was fast settling
down, the hills on the Marin shore be
ing almost hidden, while out beyond the
heads only a leaden bank of mist could
be seen. Into this the four big troop
ships plunged and were soon shut out
from view. The next land our lads
feast their eyes upon will be the tropi
cal isles of distant Hawaii.

DELAYED IN THE START.
A Scow Schooner in Collision
With the Big Transport
China.
Orders had been issued for the four
steamerS to sail promptly at 11:30 a. m.,
but owing to delay in getting the Senator
ready th,e fleet did not get away until 1
p. m. On Tuesday night it was discovered
that there was not room on the Senator
for all the stores that had to be carried
to Manila, so 100 tons of coal had to be
taken out of the ship and dumped on the
dock in order to make room. Then all the
cargo had to be restowed, ajid it was not
until 12:30 p. m. that the Senator was able
to leave her berth at Broadway wharf.
Early in the day the schooner John F.
Miller sailed too close to the China, and
becoming becalmed drifted down on the
big troopship. In order to get clear, Cap
tain Seabury had to heave up his anchor
and drift down with the tide for a short
distance. Later the tug Elizabeth came
along and towed the Miller to- a place of
safety.
In honor of the occasion, the bark An
drew Welch, the steamers of the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company and the Pacific
Mail Steamship Company were all
dressed, and presented a very pretty ap
pearance. Of the smaller craft, the yacht
Lucero, the tugs Reliance and Governor
Markham were far and away the best
dressed in the bay, and they presented a
very pretty appearance as they moved In
and out among the fleet.
The battery on the Marion and those at
Fort Mason and Fort Point boomed out a
farewell salute as the transports passed
out to sea. while the cannon on the top of
The Call building could be heard distinctly
in the bay off Alcatraz.
At 1:45 p. m. the China. Zealandia and
Senator were abreast of Aicatra.z, but
something had happened to the
Colon, and she was away behind.
Lieutenant Schieffelin from the China
was transferred to the Reliance and
started back to find out what was the
matter, but when Lombard-street wharf
was reached the Colon was seen coming
along under a full head of steam, so an
attempt was made to get back to the
China and put Lieutenant Schieffeun
aboard. That vessel had been forging
ahead all the time, however, and was a
mile past the fort When the Reliance was
only off that landmark. Captain Brokaw
refused to go any further, so the Zealan
dia was signaled, and Captain Dowdell
â¢cry kindly stopped his vessel and took
Jie officer aboard.
nJEBRASKA BOYS
ARE GRATIFIED
Through Their Chaplain They Give
Thanks to the Ladles of the

Editor The Call: In behalf of the
First Regiment, Nebraska Volun
teers, I wish to express through
your columns to the ladies of the
Red Cross Society our appreciation
of and gratitude for the countless
favors conferred by them upon us
during our encampment here. So
great is the task of raising and
equipping an army, especially to
send to a foreign country, that it
is impossible for the Government to
provide at once for many of the
most "urgent needs of the men.
These needs have been supplied
through the heroic devotion of this
band of women who count no cost
of time or comfort in their efforts
to care for the boys in blue. The
memory of their generosity we
shall carry with us, not only
through this war, but through life.

A PRESIDIO SALUTE.
Thirteen Guns Were Fired
From Fort Point as the Fleet
Passed Out to Sea.
As the Manila transport fleet passed
through the Golden Gate it ran into a
dense fog, and was soon lost to view. By
command of General Merriam, a briga
dier's salute of thirteen guns in honor ot
Brigadier General Greene, commanding
the outgoing soldiers, was fired from Fon
Point while the flagship China was pass
ing out. The fog became so thick that it
was with difficulty that the three other
transports could be seen from either Fort
Point or the Presidio.
The funeral of Private John A. Stevens,
of Troop L, Fourth Cavalry, who died
Tuesday evening of pneumonia after an
illness of only four days, will take place
this morning at the Presidio at 10 o'clock.
Private Stevens came here about ten
days ago with his troop from Walla
Walla. He was a good and faithful sol
dier, and had been in the service five
years.
Troop G, of the Fourth United States
Cavalry, will arrive at the Presidio to
morrow morning: from Walla Walla, in
command of First Lieutenant R. A.
Brown.
Lieutenant Parker, of the Fourth Cav
alry, who has been on recruiting duty at
Seattle, has been ordered to report at the
Presidio.

When asked if the date had been set for
the sailing of the third expedition Major-
General Otis replied emphatically: "No,
sir; nor does any one know when it is
likely to leave. I do not think General
Merritt himself knows. If he does he has
said nothing of it either officially or other
wise. The expedition will sail just as soon
as necessary transports are secured and
made ready. That is not yet done. We
do not contemplate moving the rest of the
camp with the next expedition. There are
not enough available transports on the
coast to effect such an exodus. No inti
mation of the troops to leave with the
next expedition has been given, and there
is absolutely no significance in the detail

four transports now ready. We selected
the men for their efficiency and for no
other reason."

ON BOARD THE HERALD-CALL DIS
PATCH BOAT SOIYIMERS N. SMITH. OFF
GUANTANAMO, Tuesday, June 14, vie Mole
St. Nicholas, Hayti, Wednesday, June 15.â
In a bold dash against the Spanish guerillas
and regulars who have harrassed them
since last Friday the American forces en
camped on Crest Heights gained a notable
victory this morning, having a band of
Cubans as allies. They drove the Span
iards from their position, four miles from
Camp McCalla, killed nearly half a hun
dred of the enemy and took eighteen pris
oners.
On our side the only losses were two
Cubans killed. Four other insurgents were
wounded, as were two American marines.
Twenty-three marines were overcome by
heat during the engagement.
Splendid advantages have been
gained by the American forces in
Cuba during the last twelve
hours. For the first time since
the}- landed they were free from
attack last night. This gave
them a welcome opportunity to
rest after almost continuous
fighting for three days and
nights. It also put the men in
good condition for a movement
against the enemy.
During this lull in activity the
Americans greatly strengthened
their position, throwing up addi
tional fortifications and improv
ing those already had. A force
of Cubans with three platoons of
marines commanded by Lieuten
ants Moses, Hall and McLemore,
were sent to establish strong out
posts a mile inland from the
American camp. This plan was
carried out successfully and re
sulted in giving the overworked
battalion much needed rest.
When it was found this morn
ing that the men were so much
refreshed the commanding offi
cers decided to carry out at once
plans which had been formulated
for an attack on the Spaniards.
The enemy was encamped at a
point four miles inland, where
were the only wells within many
miles. If the United States force
could drive them from that posi
ti< m it would be necessary for the
Spaniards to retreat almost to
the city of Guantanamo in order
to get a supply of water.
Half the marine battalion, with
a company of Cubans, began the
advance against the enemy short
ly before noon. Captain Elliott
and Lieutenants Nevill and Ma
hony commanded the marines,
while the Cubans were under
Colonels Laborde and Tomas.
Our skirmish line discov
ered the enemy in the un
derbrush half a mile from
Fort McCalla. Orders to at
tack were given immediate
ly, and the Americans and
Cubans rushed in splendid
form.
They charged against the
enemy with great boldness. The
action was sharp and spirited.
For a time the onslaught of the
marines was strongly resisted, but
the enemy was finally forced to
retreat.
Our men pressed on after the
fleeing Spaniards, and did not
give up the pursuit until they had
put the enemy completely to rout
and captured and made useless
its only water supply.
In the vicinity of the block
house, about which the en
emy made a Final stand, the
bodies of forty Spaniards
killed in the engagement
were found. In preceding
engagements the Spaniards
had managed to take their
dead with them, but to-day
their defeat was so com-:
plete that those who lived
escaped only with the great- \
est difficulty. Their dead
doubtless were left on other
parts of the battlefield
also, so the total Spanish;
loss is believed to have
been much heavier.
All the American marines who
were overcome by heat were
found by their comrades, brought
back to camp and have entirely
recovered. Lieutenant Francis
Batista, one corporal and sixteen
privates were taken prisoners by
the Americans, and have been
placed on board warships in the
harbor.
From the prisoners it has been
learned that the Spanish forces
consisted of six companies of
regulars and two companies of
guerrillas. They were armed
with Mauser and new Reming
tons. The prisoners say 600
Spanish guerrillas are arranging
to make an attack on Camp Mc-
Calla with machetes. Our men
say they are eager to have them
try.
At sunset Lieutenant Colonel
Huntington asked for reinforce
ments from Captain McCalla, ap
prehending a vigorous night at
tack. Four armed companies
were sent ashore and the Marble
head and Dolphin took positions
where they could best defend the
camp. No attack has been made
up to 11 o'clock to-night, the
hour at which I left the scene to
send this dispatch.

evening. Captain McCalla is
anxious to care for the wounded
here, and requested the Herald-
Call boat to go to Admiral Samp
son and ask to have the Solace
sent back here. The Smith left
immediately on the errand.
An American vessel, the Glou
cester, came here from the fleet
this evening and proceeded to
Mole St. Nicholas with dis
patches for the Navy Department
from Admiral Sampson. Orders
have come from Washington to
hurry the work of splicing cables,
and direct communication be
tween the American rivet and
Washington is expected to-mor
row.
Three hundred Cubans are ex
pected within a few hours to re
enforce the American marines.
They will be brought across the
bay in boats from the Marble
head. All the Americans
woUnded in the engagement at
Crest Heights are doing ex
tremely well, while the health of
the marines is excellent. I am
able to report also the conduct of
the Cubans as- fine.
Later particulars of the previous
fighting about Camp McCalla indicate
the marines were taken by surprise
when the Spaniards attacked the camp
at midnight Friday. One of the di
visions most exposed to the enemy's
lire was Company D, Captain Slicer's
command. These men were doing
picket duty. Three were killed. All
but sixteen members of Company D
were on outpost duty. When the fir
ing became heavy Lieutenant Hunting
ton sent forward his entire force of 550
marines. Harrington's battery of ar
tillery took the advanced position on
the minor crest of the ridge. Present
ly the firing slackened and continued
an hour only in a desultory manner.
The report then came that Captain
Slicer's skirmishers had engaged the
enemy and had established strong out
posts across the peninsula. At 11 o'clock
Saturday night the firing of the enemy
increased at the outskirts of the camp.
It seemed as if several pickets must
have been cut off or killed. An order
then rang over the crest to fall In.
Darkness was intense without and the
armed men formed into companies and
took a more exposed position than as
signed them originally In the plans for
defending the camp.
As it was expected that the Spanish
would attempt to take the American
position by storm word was passed to
the outer pickets to fall back. The
Spaniards advanced steadily, firing ?s
they came, but their aim generally was
too high. It is doubtful if new troops
ever had such trying experiences as
those of the American marines. For
hours they crept over the rough ground,
beating their way through an almost
endless lot of cactus plants. They were
at a great disadvantage at night, and,
also because the attacking guerrillas
were trained bushwhackers and were
familiar with the ground on which the I
fighting took place. The enemy crept
dose upon the Americans before mid- ;
night of the first day and poured a tre
mendous fire into the camp. This fire
was returned with full measure by the :
Americans, and the air about the main
position was filled with singing lead.
Our men became steadier in their fire
as the fighting continued and did much
execution before the engagement end- !
cd. It was more difficult for the Amer- j
leans to resist the Spanish attack be- i
cause the enemy approached from the !
right center and left simultaneously. |
Our men were free from fire only un
the side of the camp faring the bay.
HOW THE MARINES
CAPTURED THE CAMP
Cnder the Bold Attack and Steady
Fire the Spaniards Suffer a
Deadly Rout.
UNITED STATES CAMP, East, side ;
5f Guantanamo Hay. Tuesday, June 14,
5 p. m. (by the Associated Press Dis
patch Boat Wanda, via Kingston, Ja
maica, Wednesday, June 15. 12:30
p. m.).â The United States marines un
3er Lieutenant Colonel Robert W.
Eluntlngton made their first aggressive
movement against the Spanish guerril
las to-day and completely routed the i
?nemy. The force of marines was un- .
3er Captair Elliott, and the co-operat
ing Cubans were under Colonel La
borda. The combined forces razed a
Spanish camp about five miles from ,
the American position, .destroying the |
only veil in the vicinity and killing
more than forty Spaniards. One Amer- j
lean marine was slightly wounded. S
Two of the Cubans were killed and
[our wounded.
It is impossible to estimate the num- i
ber of Spaniard** engaged, owing to the ,
guerrilla methods of lighting, but it is
believed there were at least 400. The ;
marines behaved splendidly, their ,
marksmanship being excellent, even j
under the severe fire of the enemy.
The captured camp lies about five
miles southeast of the riile pits of the
marines, and was an important base
for the enemy, as it contained the only j
well within six or seven miles. Lieu
tenant Colonel Huntington decided on
the attack early in the day, and about
8 o'clock the force started across the i
mountain. The march up and down
the steep hillsides under the glaring
tropical sun was a severe test of en
durance for the marines, and before
the battle ground was reached twenty
two men had received medical atten
tion. All were able, however, to reach
the position before the fighting ceased.
The marines were compelled to march
in single file, following the mountain
trail. Meanwhile the Cubans darted
backward and forward, to right and
left, on the scout.
It was noon when, from a hilltop, the
Americans caught sight of the Span
ish camp on a ridge below them. It
consisted of one large house, the offi
cers' squarters, surrounded by numer
ous "shacks" and houses, all clustering
about the precious -well.
The Americans began a cautious ad
vance aDd were within 200 yards of the
enemy before the crack of a rifle from
the Spanish lines announced that the
Spaniards had discovered them. The
troops quickly moved into line of bat
tle, with the Cubans on the left flank.
The enemy's bullets were whistling vi
ciously over the Americans, but the
marines settled down to their work ns
unconcernedly as though at target
practice.
Very few Spaniards were in sight.
They were lying behind the huts and
the brush, but the puffs of smoke re
vealed their positions and enabled the
Americans to do offective work. For
twenty minutes both sides maintained.
a terrific flre. The Spanish shots were
generally wild and spasmodic, while
the Americans fired away, aiming care
fully and shooting to kill. For the
most part the American firing was done
individually, but at times the officers
would direct firing by squads, always
with telling effect. It was beginning
to look as though a bayonet charge
down the slope would be necessary to
dislodge the enemy, when suddenly the
latter began to break for a thicket a
hundred yards farther on. Little groups
could be seen fleeing from the camp,
separating, darting through the brush
and zigzagging to escape the shots.
It was then the American fire be
came most deadly. Man after man
was seen to fall in a vain rush for shel
ter, and the fire from the Spanish be
came scattered and almost ceased.
Two Cubans lay dead and four
wounded, and Private Walker of Com
pany D had to limp to the rear with a
slight wound in his ankle.
The easy victory put the command In
high spirits. The little black Cuban
warriors waved their ' machetes and
howled curses at the Spaniards in a
savage fashion. Their firing had b^en
wild throughout, but they all displayed
the utmost contempt for the Spanish
'. bullets, appa: mtly being absolutely
without fear.
As the enemy began breaking camp
the Dolphin, which lay out at sea, was
signaled and began pitching shells
toward the thicket for which the Span
iards were making.
Meanwhile lieutenant Magill was
seen coming with forty men as re-en
forcements, and Captain Mahoney was
on the way with a hundred more, but
i before either could reach the scene the
| trouble was over.
As the Spanish retreated the Ameri
cans moved slowly forward, firing as
! they went, and by the time the camp
; was reached the enemy had all gone
away, taking their wounded and prob
ably many of iieir dead. Forty bodies
' were found scattered through the
brush, but the Americans were unabfe
to examine the spot where their firing
had been most deadly. No time was
! lost in burning the buildings and filling
; the well with earth and stones.
The Dolphin landed water and am
munition, as an attack was expected
on the return march, but none was
made. Evidently the Spaniards were
too thoroughly beaten to attempt
further fighting. The marines did not
reach the American camp until after
I nightfall, and a? they had been without
food since the early morning they were
thoroughly exhausted.
Colonel Huntington believes the de
struction of their camp and well will
seriously cripple the bushwhacking
operations of the enemy.

DYNAMITE
HURLED AT
SPANIARDS
Vesuvius Proves Itself a
Dread Engine of De
struction
! Does Terrible Execution in the
BombardmeQt of a San
tiago Battery.
ON BOARD HERALD-CALL DISPATCH
BOAT OFF SANTIAGO, June 14. via Mole St.
Nicholas, Hayti, June 15.â Historical will be
come the work of destruction by the United
States dynamite cruiser Vesuvius shortly
before 12 o'clock last night. Under orders
from Admiral Sampson, the Vesuvius let fly
three dynamite shells at the forts standing
on the headland on the western side of
the entrance of Santiago harbor, and each
projectile did frightful execution.
This was the first test of a dyna
mite cruiser in actual warfare,
and naval officers are highly
gratified with the results. In ac
quiring dynamite cruisers the
United States Government estab
lished a precedent, and naval ex
perts in all parts of the world have
been keenly interested in it. For
eign governments watched close
ly the tests of the Vesuvius when
the vessel first went into the
water, and no vessel in either the
American or the Spanish navy
has been the object of such
studied attention since the pres
ent war began. Naval experts
have been eager to know how a
dynamite cruiser would behave
in actual warfare and whether it
would prove capable of doing the
destructive work its defenders
predicted.
All doubt as to these points
was dispelled within a few min
utes last night. Admiral Samp
son has been apprehensive about
the strength of the fort situated
on the point high above the sea
to the west of the entrance of
Santiago harbor. This fort, the
American admiral thought, was
one of two not entirely disabled
by the bombardment on June 6.
To settle that point and also give
the dynamite cruiser a fair oppor
tunity to prove its usefulness Ad
miral Sampson issued orders for
the Vesuvius to shell the fort.
It was 11 o'clock when the
Vesuvius stole up close to
the entrance of the harbor
34
and sent three dynamite
shells one after another in
the direction of the fort.
Terrific exDlosions followed,
each shell bursting on the
impact and playing havoc
where it struck.
The fort attacked was the most
powerful of any guarding the
harbor, mounting 1 several modern
guns. In the darkness the Ameri
cans could not distinguish the
point at which the shells struck,
but they are certain the projec
tiles exploded very near the fort,
if they did not actually hit it.
This effective work by the Ve
suvius was followed a few hours
later by equally good work by the
New Orleans. Captain Folger of
the New Orleans reported to Ad
miral Sampson early last night
that the Spaniards were emplac
ing new guns to the eastward of
Morro Castle, and he was or
dered to make an attack on the
new defenses at daylight this
morning.
When dawn came the New
Orleans took a position with
in three-quarters of a mile
of the new fortifications and
gave the Spaniards the hot
test ten minutes they have
experienced since the war
began.
The range was found at the
first .shot and in a minute the
crest of the hill was being swept
by a hurricane of shells. In a
few seconds the Spanish position
was obscured by the smoke from
bursting missiles, but the work
of the Xew ( Means' gunners was
magnificent. Every shell struck
the top of the parapet, bursting
over its defenders.
The battery was silenced in
three minutes, but the firing was
continued until the signal of re
call was hoisted on the flagship.
The Xew Orleans was uninjured.

cruiser Vesuvius joined the fleet
yesterday ami was put at work
immediately. Ensign Palmer of
the Xew York went <>v the Ve
suvius with Lieutenant-Com
mander Pillsbury to explain the
location of the batteries. A few
minutes before midnight the Ve
suvius was within a half mile of
the beach west of Morro. The
Oregon's searchlight played on
the westward battery while the
black iK^e of the cruiser pointed
at it.
I .ieirtenant-Commander Pins
bury gave the word to fire and
Lieutenant Quimby opened the
air vent. There was a slight hiss
ing, a sort of coughing noise, but
no flame, no report, no warning
to the Spaniards who were hiding
in the darkness. Thirty seconds
later a dull roar broke the silence
of the night. Two hundred
pounds of guncotton had ex
ploded on the hillside below the
batten.
The ships on the blockading
lines two miles away shook with
the explosion. The firing of a
thirteen-inch shell is a mere rifle
crack compared to the deep and
mighty roar. Clouds of earth
thrown up from the hills seemed
to stand out against the sky.
Another package of guncotton
was dropped on the other side of
the battery, and may possibly
have struck the torpedo boats
anchored below.
Before the echoes of the sec
ond shot died away the Vesuvius
sent a third charge hissing out. It
fell right on the brow of the hill
where the battery seemed to b.c.
Into the air flew tons of etirth,
and the smoke covered the land
for a half mile.
The Vesuvius retired at a six
teen-knot rate. Two flashes from
the hill and two Spanish shells
flew beyond the cruiser.
The test was regarded as high
ly satisfactory and there is in
tense interest in the fleet over
this first trial in war of a dyna
mite cruiser.

RESOLUTIONS

Against annexation â77 Democrats,

Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, June 15.
As expected by every one the New
lands resolutions for the annexation of
Hawaii passed the House by a big ma
jority, the vo-te being 209 to 91. Speaker
Reed was absent on account of su lv
ness, but the occupant of .the chair
(Dalzell) announced on behalf of Reed
that if he had been present he would
have voted against annexation.
Of the California delegation Barham,
IlilLtorn and Loud voted for the resolu
tion. Barlow and Castle refrained from
recording themselves and Magulre cast
the only California vote against it. The
resolution will now be taken up in the
Senate, but the general opinion here
is that it will not reach a vote at this
session, as it will be impossible to hold
Senators at the capital during the hot
weather. Some of them are already
leaving and others are impatient to
leave before the weather becomes in
tolerable.
The chief organ of the annexation
ists. the Evening Star, realizes full
well that Congress cannot be kept here
much longer and in an editorial to
night urges them to remain, saying:
"A disposition on the part of some of
the political leaders In the two bouses
"L Congress to secure an early adjourn
ment Is to be noted with surprise. The
nation is at war with foreign foe.
Conditions of unquestioned gravity and
novelty are constantly arising. It
is particularly surprising that there
should be any thought of adjournment
without acting upon the annexation of
Hawaii."
This coming from the annexationists
sho-ws the apprehension they feel that
Congress will adjourn without taking
action. The letter of Samuel Gompers,
president of the American Federation
of Labor, written to Speaker Reed,
protesting against annexation in the
name of over a million members of that

The debate on annexation, which has
been continued without interruption in
the House since Saturday, has been
one of the most notable of this Con
gress, the proposed annexation being
considered of commercial and strategic
importance by its advocates and being
looked .upon by Its opponents as in
volving a radical departure from the
long-established policy of the country,
and likely to be followed by the in
auguration of a pronounced policy of
colonization, the abandonment of the
Monroe doctrine and participation In
international wrangles. More than half
a hundred members participated in the
debate. From a party standpoint the
result was awaited with the keenest In
terest. The Republicans presented
practically a unanimous support to th^
resolutions, but three Republicans vot
ing in opposition. In the Democratic
ranks the division upon the question
was more marked, eighteen Demo
cratic members voting for annexation.
The vote in support of the resolu
tions to-day was made up of 179 Re
publicans. 18 Democrats, 8 Populists
and 4 fusionists; the vote against an
nexation comprised 7T Democrats, 3
Republicans, 7 Populists and 4 fusion
ists.
To-day's session began at 10 o'clock
and debate continued seven hours. Few
members were upon the floor until late
in the afternoon and the galleries had
few occupants. As the hour for voting
drew near, however, members began
taking their places and there were few
more than a score of absentees when
the first rollcall was taken. The an-
nouncement of the vote upon the pas
sage of the resolutions was cheered
upon the iioor and applauded by the
spectators. The resolutions adopted
to-day in a preamble relate to the offer
of the Hawaiian republic to cede all of
its sovereignty and absolute title to
the Government and crown lands, and
then by resolution accepts the cession
and declares the islands annexed. The
resolutions provide for a commission of
five, at least two of whom shall be resi
dent Hawailans, to recommend to Con
gress such legislation as they may
deem advisable. The public debt of
Hawaii, not to exceed $4,000,000, is as
sumed. Chinese immigration is pro
hibited, all treaties with other powers
are declared null, and it is provided
that, until Congress shall provide for
the government of the islands all
civil, Judicial and military powers now
exercised by the officers of the existing
Government shall be exercised in such
manner as the President Bhall direct,
and he is given power to appoint per

sons to put Into effect provisional gov
ernment for the islands.
Soon after the House met the Hawaiian
debate was resumed. The Senate bills
granting American register to the ships
Specialist and Unionist were passed.
Fitzgerald CD.) of Massachusetts spoke
against the N,wland.s resolution. In the
course of his speech ho emphasized the
failure of the majority of Huwaiians to
express their desirps relative to annexa
i!' n " , , insis? tfd that every people had
the right to the government of its choice
Woodland's Gay Decorations In Honor of the Native Daughters
Speaking further, Fitzgerald opposed an
nexation on the ground that an injurious
labor element would be brought Into com
petition with American laborers.
Supporting the resolution, Berry (D.) of
Kentucky devoted much of his time to
show that annexation was In line with
Democratic policy. He reviewed the ter
ritorial additions to the original States to
show that practically all had been made
by Democrats. He quoted Jefferson.
Plorce, Marcy, Buchanan, Bayard and
other Democrats to support his conten
tion that Democratic history -warranted
i present Democratic Bupport of annexa
tion.
Parker (R.I of New Jersey advocated
the resolutions and Meyer (D.I of Louisi
ana followed in opposition, paying- special
attention to the Injury which he claimed
i would be inflicted upon the 000.000 people
engaged in Louisiana in the sugar in
dustry.
During Meyer's speech he was inter
rupted by Suizer, who asserted the agent
of the sugar trust was at the capital
â working against annexation.
"By what authority do you say that?"
I qiierled Golnes (D.) of Tennessee.
"By the newspaper now in your hand,
which says Oxnard, representing the
trust, is here, and asserts the resolutions
will pass the House but the Senate will
I adjourn before they can get through
i there."
"He ought to be kicked out of town,"
| declared the Tennesseean.
"That's right," replied the New Yorker.
"And if he comes talking around I'll
; kick him out," asserted the member from
! Tennessee, with rising Indignation.
Williams (D. > of Mississippi concluded
the debate for the opposition. He devoted
much of his time to an attack upon the
< method of annexation embodied in the
resolutions. He insisted upon its uncon
' stitutlonality.
Hepburn (R.) of lowa was recognized
I to conclude in support of the resolutions.
' Answering the claim that annexation
would mean launching upon colonization,
i he disavowed any such understanding. He
' said he hoped to see every Spanish pos
session fall Into the possession of this
i country In order to contribute to the
! enemy's Injury and that being accom
! plished the question of their disposition
; would ari^e and be met when the war
should end.
At the conclusion of Hepburn's speech,
; it being 5 o'clock, voting began. The first
â  roll call was upon the minority substitute,
I which proposed resolutions as follows:
Iâ That the Tnlted States will view
i as an act of hostility any attempt upon
t the part of any Government of Europe or
i Asia to take or hold possession of the
: Hawaiian Islands or to exercise upon any
pretext or under any conditions sovereign
authority therein.
i 2â The United States hereby announce
j to the people of those islands and to the
i world their guarantee of the Independ
ence of the people of the Hawaiian Islands
and their firm determination to maintain
i the same.
The roll call resulted In the rejection of
the substitute. Yeas. t>4; nays, 205.
The announcement of the vote was ap
plauded. The majority resolution was
then put upon passage and the roll call
proceeded. It was followed with great in
terest, there being a general curiosity
to hear the vote of many members con
sidered doubtful.
Prior to announcing the v%te, Dalzell,
who, In the absence of Mr. Reed, was
â¢ presiding, said: "The Speaker of the
! House Is absent on account of Illness and
I am requested by him to say that were
he present, on this proposition he would
vote no."
The announcement was applauded by
the opposition to annexation. Dalzell then
announced the vote: Yeas, 209; nays, 91;
not present, 6.

Project of California's
Daughters."
HOME FOR SICK MEMBERS
HOW THE RELIEF FUND WILL
BE UTILIZED.
Grand Parlor in Session at Woodland
Decides to Hold Its Next
Annual Meeting at
Stockton.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WOODLAND, June 15.â One feature
of this session of the Grand Parlor of
Native Daughters that has a vital in r
terest for. every member of the order
will be the consideration of a new line
of work which the board of relief will
formulate. The board of relief is an
incorporate body and was organized in
accordance with a recommendation
adopted by the Grand Parlor at its
sixth annual session, held at Sacra
mento in 1892. It consists of fifteen
members, appointed from that Grand j
Parlor body, and its financial start in i
life was a bequest of $600, received I
from the estate of S. P. Rodgers for
charitable purposes. The main objects
of the board are to relieve sick, dis
tressed and worthy members of the or
der. Its support is derived from an
annual tax on, the subordinate parlors,
and as the calls for relief have been
very few and the tax has been regu- !
larly paid the fund has gradually j
grown until there is now on hand about '
$13,000.
The business affairs of the board are ;
under the direction of nine directors,
whose first officers were: President, i
Mrs. Tina L. Kane; vice president, Miss
Mac B. Wilkln: secretary, Miss M. B.
Johnson; treasurer, Mrs. Carrie R.
Durham; and the same officers still fill
the chairs, with the exception of Miss :
Johnson, who has been succeeded by
Miss C. K. Wittenmeyer.
The nctivo, energetic native daugh
ters who compose this board of relief
are apparently not satisfied with the
small amount of good they have been
able to do with the funds intrusted to
their care, and each annual meeting has
been enlivened by discussion on the
subject. "The greatest good to the
greatest number" seems to be their
aim, and last year, when Miss C. K.
Wittenmeyer suggested a Native
Daughters' Home, where the sick of the
order could receive the best medical at
tendance, the Idea was hailed with de
light.
During the year a committee was ap
pointed with Mrs. W. S. Leake as chair
man to outline a plan of work that
would accomplish the object, and to
have It ready for this session. The
plan has been discussed by members
of the committee in many of the sub
ordinate parlors, and the enthusiastic
reception it received has encouraged
them in the belief they are working out
the right idea for making the more sub
stantial the foundation on which their
order rests.
It is evidently not the Intention of
these rustling Native Daughters to plan
to build their home frrr a time when
their days of usefulness are gone; it is
for the infirm of to-day they are work
ing and they intend to begin at once,
even though it be In a small way â start
the bag a-rollinpr. as it were, believing
it will grow as it goes; and they even
look forward to a building: of their
own, well built and well planned, vir
tually a "home of their own." An un
dertaking of some proportions, they
realize, but what these Native Daugh
ters undertake to do, they do, and in
this they intend to be successful.
The work of the Grand Parlor at this
morning's cession was prefaced with
prayer and the usual song service. In
her report the grand president recom
mended the adoption of a ritual pre
pared by Mrs. Gunzendorfer of San
Francisco. The morning session was
almost wholly devoted to the exempli
fication of this ritual. For that pur
pose the grand president appointed the
following officers: Miss Clara Witten
meyer, senior past president; Eliza D.
Keith, past president; Mrs. Theodore
Lunstedt, president; Miss M. Bertola,
first vice president; Mrs. L. Carlie, sec
ond vice president; Mrs. L. H. Mills,
third vice president; Mrs. L. B. Mills,
marshal; Mrs. Callie Shields, outside
sentinel.
Dr. Mary Cage Campbell officiated as
the mock candidate for initiation. The
| exemplification was watched with a
j great deal of interest and at the close
of the ceremony the delegates were
very enthusiastic in commending and
praising Mrs. Gunzendorfer's work.
A communication was read from Joa
quin Parlor of Stockton, offering to en
tertain the Grand Parlor in 1899. A
motion to hold the next Grand Parlor
at that place was adopted unanimously.
At the afternoon session the report
I of the committee on printing and sup-
I plies and that of the committee on ap
i peals and grievances were read and re
ferred. An original poem written by
[Miss Irene H. Musick of Crescent City
Parlor was recited. A telegram from
Grand President Conly of the Native
Sons to Grand President Conrad of the
Native Daughters was read, it con
gratulating the delegates and express
ing the hope that the twelfth session
would be a success.
Under the head of good of the order
the proposition to change the time of
meeting of the Grand Parlor was dis
cussed at considerable length. It was
not settled, and will come up on Thurs
day. A dispatch from Joaquin Parlor
was read, extending a hearty welcome
to the Grand Parlor for 1899. At 4
o'clock an adjournment was ordered,
the Grand Parlor having accepted an
invitation to attend a meeting of the
Red Cross Society.
This evening between the hours of 6
and 8:30 the members of the Grand
Parlor were taken for a drive. Every
point of interest in Woodland and the
great Yolo orchard at Cacheville were
visited. All the conditions for the ex
cursion were favorable. The roads were
in splendid condition and the weather
perfect. The delegates expressed them
selves as delighted with the experience.
Beginning at 9 o'clock an open-air
concert was given on the court yard
plaza.
The weather clerk has been very gra
cious so far this week, and the indica
tions are that we shall have pleasant
weather during the entire session of the
Grand Parlor. The delegates are agree
ably surprised, as many of them came
here under the impression that the heat
would be sweltering. Instead they have
found a climate as genial and recuper
ating as a seaside resort, and some of
them did not come prepared for it.
Politics is taking up some of the at
tention of the delegates, and there is
friendly rivalry for several of the of
fices. Miss Lizzie Douglass of Alta
Parlor, present treasurer, is a candidate
for re-election. Mrs. W. A. Gett of Sac
ramento will be presented by Califia
Parlor for vice-president. Mrs. Cora B.
Sifford of Buena Ventura Parlor is a
candidate for first vice-president. Miss
Eliza D. Keith of San Francisco is a
candidate for grand trustee. Alta Par
lor is anxious to put her in the line of
succession for the grand presidency.

Later. M. Moline handed President Faure
the resignations of the whole Cabinet,
which the President accepted, while re

SAUSALITO, June 15.â A Mttle squad
of poolroom soldiers came over from
San Francisco in an electric launch to
night, confident that when they return
ed it would be in Joyful mood at the
downfall of rival cohorts. There were
six men in the party â John P. Glynn,
Alfred Broyer, Henry Schwartz, John
Humphrey and two friends. On this
side they were welcomed by Attorney
Hepburn Wilkins of San Rafael and a
number of friends. Soon the streets
were alive with people keenly inter
ested in the outcome of their visit. It
would soon be known whether Har
rison and Harvey were to enjoy a mo
nopoly In the poolroom business.
The town hall was crowded at 9
o'clock, and there was a buzz of ex
citement when Trustees Crumpton,
Sylva and Thomas marched sedately
in and took their seats.
"I move," said Sylva, "that this
board adjourn to meet next Monday
evening."
Thomas seconded the motion and the
gTeat event was over.
A party of six went back to the
metropolis in an electric launch to the
tune of "Chevy Chase." The fact is
now divulged that the reason why the
San Mateo forces did not witness their
own funeral was that the board saw
fit to postpone the obsequies. For the
firm of Glynn, Broyer. Schwartz &
Humphrey will get no license to run a
poolroom in Sausalito. Early in the
evening three members of the board
met and held a caucus In secret. It
was decided to refuse a license to
Schwartz and hie combine, and the
members solemnly pledged themselves
to stand by each other when it comes
to a vote in open meeting next Mon
day evening.

Cables to Madrid That the Situ

Critical.
MADRID, June 15.â A dispatch received here from Captain General
Augusti, dated Manila, June 6, says:
"The situation continues critical. The enemy surround the town. I
have had our lines drawn closer around the city and strengthened at
Intervals by trochas. Communication is still cut. I expect General
Monet, with re-enforcements, but I have no news from him. The white
population of the suburbs, fearing they will be massacred by the rebels
and preferring the risk of bombardment, have entered the fortified part
of the town and will assist in its defense. I do not know when the
bombardment will commence."

VANCOUVER. June 15. â Trouble
seems to have followed the old filibus
tering steamship Laurada to the West,
for after getting into disfavor with the
customs officers here by refusing to un
dergo Canadian inspection she early
THE ILL-FATED STEAMER LAURADA.
this morning struck o-n the rocks and
gravel in the Narows when leaving
the harbor.
The Laurada took on 200 tons of
freight here for the Dominion Govern
ment forces on the Yukon and left with
a Seattle pilot named Hanson aboard
shortly after midnight last night. An
hour afterward she was ashore in the
Narrows, having in some unaccountable
manner mistaken the channel. A Call
representative, accompanied by a cus
toms officer, rowed out to the steamer
this morning. She was then high out
c-f the water, with her stern almost
submerged. Her 240 passengers were
grouped disconsolately around the
deck. J. Henshaw of Al-Ki, Ind., who
was bound northward to represent the
Seattle-Yukon Gold Dredging Company,
gave this story of the disaster:
"All our trouble is due to having a
Seattle pilot named Hanson on board,
who did not know these waters. All
of our 240 passengers were asleep when
a crashing, grinding noise told us some
thing was wrong. The twenty women
on board were the first on deck, scream
ing and crying for life preservers. Then
the men piled nut and terrible confusion
ensued. In the dim light we saw we
were almost on land and this quieted
us.
"All night we remained on deck,
afraid to sleep, and in the gray morn
ing we were high and dry on shore, for
the tide was out."
The passengers were in an excited
state and wanted to leave the steamer.
During the afternoon efforts were
made by two tugs to get the vessel
off, and at 6 o'clock they were success
ful. The passengers expected to be
taken ba<:k to Vancouver, as they
thought the vessel was unsafe. To es
cape libel proceedings by the city for
damages to the water pipes the cap
tain went right on to Seattle. When
The Call correspondent left the boat
the passengers were holding an indig
nation meeting and said all would leave
the steamer at Seattle if she ever get
there.
The Laurada has been unfortunate
since coming here. When Captain
Scott refused Canadian inspection he
had to take oath that no passengers
would be taken on here. This aroused
the suspicions of passengers, who said
the boat must be unsafe, and they com
plained to the customs officers. Things
went from bad to worse and now there
is rebellion on board.
Among the passengers Is Mrs. Wall,
wife of Sam W. Wall of The Call, who
is going to Dawson with a newspaper
plant. She was the only self-possessed
person on board when the vessel struck.
Owing to the breaking of the two
principal water mains by the Laurada
a water famine is expected here. Cana
dian officials will follow the boat to
Seattle to libel her.
SEATTLE, June 15.â The steamer
Laurada is expected In this port early
to-morrow morning and complications
are likely to arise. After running
aground in the narrow entrance to Van
couver harbor and breaking the city's
water pipe mains Bhe floated off at high
tide to-night before papers in a $15,000
libel cult could be Berved. It Is main
tained here by maritime men that a
libel will not hold while the vessel is In
an American port.
The Canadian authorities were severe
in their criticism of the Laurada's cap
tain. Although Vancouver Is a com
pulsory pilotage Dort Captain Scott,
who was a mate with Captain Hart on
his now famous filibustering expedition
to Cuba, refused to take a pilot out,
against a full t^de, contenting himself
with a local pilot who did not know
the channel, called The Narrows, at the
entrance of the harbor. As a conse
quence he left the straight and narrow
path to avoid a tide rip and ran onto
the pipes lying at the bottom of the
channel. â¢
ARMOUR GOES TO
LEITER'S RELIEF.
The Packer May Prevent a Heavy
Loss by the Young Napoleon
of Wheat.
CHICAGO, June 15.â Arrangements for
the closing of the Leiter deal have been
completed. Final papers were placed be
fore Joseph Leiter to-day, and 7,000,000'
bushels of choice cash wheat were con
signed to P. D. Armour, who will hence
forth control all the Leiter holdings. Ar
mour has already begun to dispose of the
wheat, and unless the coining crop is har
vested sooner than anticipated it seems
likely that the immense line of wheat m
the Northwest will be consumed here.
It is stated that Leiter will not lose as
much as was generally believed. Armour's
assumption of the burden is said to have
meant at least $2,000,000 for Leiter. That
much loss would have been incurred if
the immense line of wheat had to be mer
chandised by trustees, with the probabil
ity of a declining market. The loans made
to Leiter by the local banks aggregate
nearly $7.000",000. Each bank was careful
to protect itself with wide margins that
would insure against loss. Interviews
with a number of bankers interested show
that they are all satisfied with the trans
fer of the deal to Armour.
NEW YORK. June 15.â The Sheriff has

ance Company for $$1,915. The attachment

Department this afternoon that the lit

defending it" night and day against
heavy odds were not only safe but were
strongly re-enforced by 1500 Cubans
from the commands of Garcia and Rabi
and w6re now strong enough to more
than hold their own.
It was disclosed in a dispatch from
Admiral Sampson, and brought much
relief to naval officials. The early re
ports had indicated that the marines
\>. ore surrounded and it was feared
that they ir.i^ht be compelled to return
to the ships before General Shafter's
invading army reached there on Fri-
The coming of the Cuban forces
a to have been in the nick of time,
and naval officers give the fullest credit
to the timeliness of this Cuban co-op
n. The admiral's dispatch stated
the condition of the marines was
satisfactory," which assur
although brief, was enough to re
here of the fears they had
tamed.
But probably the most signifi
cant fealureof theadmiral's dis
patch was the statement that
the Cuban General Rabi had oc
cupied Aserradero, only ei&ht
miles from Santiago and practi
cally a suburb of that Spanish
stronghold.
It was the execution of a plan ar
il in Washington some weeks ago
when two of the stall officers of General
i tame here to confer with Gen

Admiral Sampson's dispatch shows

upon as a ;ry stroke, for Aser
â o is the port whose wharf will
afford facilities for unloading the heavy
artillery carried by General Shafter's
Invading expedition.
The news also indicated to the au
thorities here that the Spanish garrison
at Santiago has practically retreated
inside the city proj er, giving up the
lying towns.
Admiral Sampson also states that
ral Garcia is co-operating with the
American forcca. Whether this means
that Garcia has himself arrived from
Bayamo is not quite clear, but if he
has the joint forces of Garcia and Rabi
v.ill make 3000 to 5000 seasoned Cubans,
recently armed with Springfield rifles,
as a bushwhacking guerilla force to
aid the American troops. From sources
other than the dispatch of Admiral
Fampson the Navy Department has
informed that 500 Cubans were
rendering efficient aid "to the marines
at Crest Hill. Now that Rabi and Gar

out the Hopkins board was to prepare
a camp not for Immediate occupation
! but for the Instant reception of troops
who might necessarily be removed from
; other camps where contagious diseases
appear.
Although Tampa dispatches say that
the transport fleet which sailed yester
day was going to double Cape Antonio,
: the western extremity of Cuba, in pro
i ceeding to Santiago, the naval officials
do not believe that this is the case, for
the reason that the western route is
fully 200 miles longer than the route by
way of Cape Maysi, and the transports
would have to fight the gulf stream
until they got clear around Cape An
j tonio. On the eastern course the ships
j would have the full benefit of the' fa
i vorable current until they reached Cape
: Maysi, about two-thirds of the distance
to be traveled. It is believed here that
the idea that the ships were westward
bound grew out of the circumstances
; that they headed for the Tortugas, the
point selected for the fleet of transports
to pick up the heavier vessels of the
convoy squadron, such as the Indiana,
which has not been able to get within
ten miles of Key West because of lack
of water. The officials see no reason
to correct their original estimate that
the troops will be off Santiago Friday.
Some of the Congressional visitors at
the War Department have questioned
the officials as to the exact purpose of
the military expedition to Santiago.
The idea has got abroad that San
tiago was to be made the base of oper
ations against Havana. It is learned,
however, that the Department's plans
do not contemplate this. The sole pur
pose of landing troops at Santiago and
capturing the town is to destroy or
capture the Spanish fleet.
Therefore, it is said, that as soon as
Santiago is reduced and the Spanish
fleet disposed of the United States
troops will be dispatched to some other
point, either Porto Rico or Havana,
leaving the insurgents in Eastern Cuba
to prevent the Spaniards from re-oc
cupyfng Santiago. . If the insurgents
cannot be depended upon to do this
pome of the United States troops, per
| haps f.OOO, will be left in the vicinity of
Santiago under the protection of some
of tHe American cruisers which by that
time will have effected an entrance into
i Santiago Bay.
KINGSTON A MECCA FOR
BLOCKADE-RUNNERS
Has Become a Rendezvous for Vessels
Carrying Supplies for Span
iards in Cuba.
NEW YORK. June 15.â A special
from Kingston, Jamaica, quotes an of
ficer of the British cruiser Talbot as
: having said that supplies in small
quantities were reaching Havana
across the island from Batabano, and,
apparently, from Jamaica,
The Persima Concepcion changed on
Saturday to the English flag and com
pleted her cargo of 8000 packages of
flour, rice and corn. She will sail for
Cuba. She endeavored to obtain an
English captain. Consul Dent formal
ly protested, the ultimate destination of
the cargo being a blockaded port. He
maintained it was a direct violation of
neutrality and that the American Gov
ernment would set up this claim prob
ably with the evidence now in the pos-
Bession of the Government. The Benito
Estanger has also succeeded In chang
ing her flag and will load a cargo for
Manzanlllo.
The Spanish steamer Manuel Raoul
arrived at Montegro Bay on Friday, en
deavoring to obtain a cargo of sup
pliea for Manzanillo. A Spanish com
missariat officer was on board and
probably the supplies are destined for
the Spanish army.
Unless immediate action is taken by
the American Government, the Kings
ton dispatch says, the blockade will be
practically nullified by supplies reach
ing the blockaded towns from Jamaica.
Merchants here are looking for Span
ish purchasers at tancy prices and are
speculating heavily in foodstuffs.
Much suspicion has been aroused at
Kingston, the correspondent says, by
the character of the cargo of the City
of Kingston, which has arrived from
Nov.- York. The cargo consists of 400
cases Of pork. 125 bags n{ corn, ."7 bales
of tobacco, 1000 bags of rice, 1200 bar
rels and 1800 bags of flour. The cargo
seems much too large for a single firm
to handle in ordinary trade, and it is
believed to be destined for trans-ship
ment to Cuba for the Spanish troops.

General Brooke Ordered to Organize an

sion of Porto I^ico.
WASHINGTON, June 15.â The Navy Department
to-day posted the following bulletin :
"Admiral Sampson reports that he has been re
enforced by several hundred Cubans, and that our force
at Guantanamo is in a very satisfactory condition. The
town of Aserradero has been occupied by the troops
under General Rabi. The men under General Garcia
are co-operating with the American forces/
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, June 15.
General Brooke, "commanding
Fort Thomas, Chickamauga, has
been ordered to select the twelve
best drilled and equipped regi
ments encamped there for service
in Porto Rico. The War Depart
ment is awakening to the fact
that the army has some desperate
righting before it and that thous
ands of men will be needed
where it was thought hundreds
would be sufficient.
It would not be sur
prising if President Mc-
Kinley issued a third
call for troops within a
few days. In fact, Rep
resentative Hull of lowa,
chairman of the Mili
tary Affairs Committee
of the House, stated in
positive terms to-day
that the President
would soon issue a call
for 50,000 more volun
teers.
The latest plans for the expe
dition to Porto Rico contemplate
having the expedition ready for
service in two weeks, but those
who know something of army
methods say it will not be ready
in that time, as there are many
details yet to be arranged. More
transports may have to be char
tered, as it is said only eleven
steamships are now available for
this expedition. It will take prob
ably fifteen more to accommo
date the force of 20,000 men
which it is now proposed to send.
In the meantime it appears
probable that the camp at Jack
sonville will be abandoned in
favor of another point along the
coast, where the water is deeper
and which will be made the port
of departure. The departure of

The young. man is now in Washington.
In January last he took the regular
naval examination, which is as rigid
as a regular civil service examination.
Out of a class of forty he stood number
fourteen on the list. Consequently
when his name was reached in the reg

cured the position on merit after com

GERMANY'S ATTITUDE
IN THE PHILIPPINES
The Berlin Press Asserts it Is Solely
One of Surveillance of
German Interests.
IX)NDON, June 16.â The Berlin cor
respondent of the Daily Mail says: The
Berlin press is unanimous in asserting
that Germany's attitude in the Philip
pines is solely one of surveillance of
German interests, and that ths pres
ence of the German fleet at Manila is
a guarantee that, if the Philippines are
lost to Spain, they will not come into
the possession of any single power in
terested in East Asia.
The Berliner Post eaya that It the
the Shafter force ' from Tampa
left there under General Cop
pinger a force of 15,000 men,
mostly volunteers, probably 3000
of the total strength being regu
lars. General Coppinger is said
to favor Jacksonville as a port of
departure, where General Lee
soon will be in command of 8000
men.
While Admiral Samp
son's telegram to-day
temporarily relieved the
anxiety felt for the ma
rines at Guantanamo,
it is by no means reas
suring, and, despite his
confidence that with the
re - enforcements they
will be able to maintain
their position until Gen
eral Shafter arrives,
grave fear for their
safety is yet felt.
Naval officers are inclined to
lay all the blame on the army for
its slowness, while army officers
declare that a great blunder was
committed by the naval force at
Santiago in landing a handful of
marines and exposing them to
the merciless fire of a big force of
guerrilla Spaniards.
The belief in official circles is
that some European power is
Striving covertly to incite ill will

MYSTERIOUS MOVES
OF SPANISH CRAFT
Copyrighted, 1898, bynames Gordon Bennett.
CADIZ, June 15.â A squadron consist
ing of two Ironclads, one torpedo boat,
one cruiser and two destroyers sailed at
dawn yesterday from Cadiz, but returned
in the evening. These mysterious move
ments are doubtless Intended to mislead.
Any alleged sailing of the fleet should be
received with the greatest caution. Gen
eral Valdez has arrived with more ammu
nition Two trans-Atlantic steamers
have arrived and are being transformed
into armored cruisers. It has been de
cided to send further reinforcements to
the Balearies, Canaries and Ceuta.
There Is great excitement throughout
the country owing to the fear that the
American fleet may be coming toward
Spain.

German Government of
its steadfast determin

jto the observance of
neutrality in the pres
ent war, and there is no
reason to look for any

i policy in that respect.
Officers of the administration
regard the recent statement of
Emperor William on that subject
as final and conclusive.
War Department officials were
much pleased to-day when Gen
eral Merritt telegraphed that the
second Philippine expedition had
sailed. They say that if Manila
is not already in Admiral Dew-,
ey's possession it will be before
many days. The capture of the
other ports in the Philippine
Islands is merely a work of send
ing a vessel and taking posession.
That will be the case with the La
drone and Caroline Islands also.
As things now look all
the Spanish possessions
of the Pacific and all of
those in the West Indies,
with the exception of a
part of Cuba, will be in
the possession of the
United States within six
weeks.
Private advices received here
from trustworthy foreign sources
lead to the belief that Spain will
keep up the war as long as she
possibly can. If the United
States refuses to allow her to re
tain Porto Rico and the Philip
pine Islands there will be no
peace until it is "forced down the
throat of Spain," as a State De
partment official remarked to
day.
MANY APPLICATIONS
FOR ARMY COMMISSIONS
Ex-Congressman Caminetti and Dr.
George A. Shiels May Go to
the Philippines.
WASHINGTON, June 15.â Members
of the California delegation are fairly
besieged by applications from all parts
of California. Hundreds of telegrams
from candidates are dally received, and
the Senators and Representatives are
kept constantly running to the depart
ments in quest of office for friends.
The delegation is united in its recom
mendation of ex-Congressman Camin
etti, who is anxious to serve on the
staff of some general and accompany
the Philippine expedition. It seems al
together likely that Dr. George A.
Shiels will be appointed a surgeon to
serve on the staff of Brigadier General
H. G. Otis, in the Philippine campaign,
as he is highly recommended by the
California delegation and by the medi
cal profession and prominent citizens of
San Francisco.

Wanda, via Kingston, Jamaica, June

modore Schley, with their combined
forces, are slowly but surely placing a
network about Santiago de Cuba, and
are cutting off so effectually every

short time starvation's tapping will
give way to death's solid knock for ad

Within three days three separate

and ridiculous."
Germany, the Daily Mail suggests,
probably has designs on the Sulu Isl

acquire in 1885.
The Daily Chronicle, referring to the
report that the United States will send
a fleet against Cadiz and Barcelona,
says: "That could not fail to ex

United States would do better to let

at anything of that kind when Santiago

have fallen."
SAMPSON'S SHIPS WILL
BOMBARD GUANTANAMO
Navy Department Hourly Expecting
News That the City Has
Been Shelled.
NEW YORK, June 15.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
The authorities are hourly expecting a
dispatch from Rear-Admiral Sampson
announcing the shelling of Guanta
namo. This expectation is due to a
report which has reached them that
the channel has been dredged to locate
or countermine any mines that may
have been planted there, and the ab
sence of these explosives has led the
officials to believe there will be no de
lay in destroying the Spanish base of
supplies. Its destruction will make
more difficult the operations of the
Spaniards against the American force
and cause them to- stay nearer Santiago
de Cuba.
In official circles the opinion Is ex
pressed that the force of Santiago has
been drawn upon to drive the American
marines from Cuban sftil, on account of
the belief of the Spaniards that the
object of the "^ar-admiral In taking
possession of that point was to estab
lish a landing place for the army now
on the way.
The authorities have reason to be
lieve the Spaniards of Santiago have
been re-enforced by troops from thÂ«
adjoining province, and they believe,
the American army will find it has a
harder nut to crack than would have
been the case had it reached Cuba Im
mediately after it was definitely known
that Cervera's fleet was locked up In
Santiago.

HOBSON'S CHOICE.
SECRETARY LONG has formally and substan
tially recognized and honored the gallantry of
the men who, under command of Naval Con
structor Hobson, sunk the Merrimac in the mouth
oi the harbor at Santiago. No action, however, has
been taken with respect to Hobson himself, for the
assigned reason that the department has not yet had
an opportunity of communicating with him to learn
what he desires.
Under ordinary circumstances a government would
not have to ask an officer who had distinguished
himself for eminent service in battle what form of
honor he would accept* Dewey was not asked
whether he would like promotion to fne rank of rear
admiral. Nor were any of his captains asked
whether they would like advancement on the roll of
those who are to be promoted next The difference
in Hobson's case is due to the peculiar system of the
naval se-vice. Hobson is not a line officer. He
is not a naval fighter, but a naval constructor. There
fore he is not in line of promotion. He cannot be
advanced until he has been consulted and it has been
found out where he wishes to go.
The question moreover may not be an easy one for
the hero himself to determine. The "Hobson's
choice" of the old proverb was no choice at all, and
therefore not a mattet for consideration or debate.
The new Hobson's choice, however, is going to be
quite a perplexing affair, if Congress does not enact
the navy personnel bill before he is called upon to
make it.
Two courses are open to Hobson, but each is be
pet with drawbacks. He can accept promotion in
his present line of work to the position of naval con
ftructor, but to do so would be to set back his com
rades in the service, for in a corps where the num
bers are so few and promotion so slow the advance
ment of one out of turn pushes others down the list
and works a serious hardship for them. Moreover
the construction corps does not offer a very brilliant
future for the hero, even if he accepts promotion in
it at the expense of his comrades.
The other course open to him is to leave the staff
and become a line officer. This would mean the
abandonment of the department of work which he
has chosen and for which he is so well fitted. It
would also be a surrender in some respects of the
claims for which the staff has been fighting for years.
Hobson is now in a- position where he can compel
public attention to the evil and unfairness of the ex
isting system of officering the navy. When it is
feen that a brave and gallant officer who has rendered
an important and daring service to his country can
not be suitably promoted or rewarded without re
quiring him to leave the work for which he is best
suited and undertake some other, it will be every
where admitted it is time for a change.
Hobson, being confined in Morro at the mouth of
Santiago Bay, and retired from war's alarms, has am
ple time to meditate upon the choice before him.
Meantime Congress should not waste time in medi
tation. The enactment of the navy personnel bill
will determine Hobson's choice simply and satisfac
torily. There should be no longer any discrimina
tion against the engineer branch of the naval service.
Hobson is as good a fighter as any man in the line,
not excepting Fighting Bob Evans, and deserves as
good a chance to command a ship or a fleet.
A city paper states a Cabinet officer to have de

If there existed the slightest necessity for a private

the act is something else. It might, for instance, be
termed a cheap way for yellow journalism to adver

THE GEARY-STREET FRANCHISE.
IN its eagerness to be restored to the Southern Pa

Third street Boodler (late of Mission street)
throws sense, reason, veracity and the amenities of
journalistic debate to the winds. We do not com
plain of this, for probably the. necessities of the
Boodler are pressing and must soon be satisfied.
That sheet cannot continue to increase its circulation
at the Potrero Garbage Crematory without outside
assistance, and its attempts to again break into the
treasury of the railroad monopoly via tlie Geary street
franchise may be and probably are justified by its
financial condition.
But when the yellow boodler debates the renewal
of the Geary street franchise on its merits it ought, for
the benefit of the few sanr readers it has left, to
stick to reason and facts. It accuses The Call of a
desire to aid the Market Street Company in getting
another franchise on Geary street, and attributes to
us corrupt motives, thus entirely missing the point
of our remarks and misapprehending their purpose.
But this is not at all surprising. Since the Bood
ler's circulation became so extensive at the Gar
bage Crematory the sheet has manifested many signs
of paresis. That its understanding is growing weak
and its powers of expression muddled has long been
apparent to observing people.
The purpose of our remarks anent the Geary stfeet
franchise was benevolent. They were intended to
show the Boodler that its efforts to break into
the Southern Pacific treasury via Geary street are
vain, for the reason that the present owners of the
franchise on that thoroughfare need only to surrender
in order to make a renewal perfectly legal. The
Boodler admits this and yet- it persists in its
"fight" to preserve the Geary street franchise for the
people. As a matter of fact, the Boodler does
not want to preserve this franchise for the people or
anybody else. What it wants is to make the Geary
Street Company so much trouble that it will restore
it to the pay roll â purchase its silence, as was done
in the other case, at the exorbitant rate of $1000 a
month.
In making a disturbance over the Geary street
franchise the Boodler is simply barking up a tree
in which there is no game. All the railroad monop
oly need do is to surrender its present privilege and
ask for a new one. In this way it could bring on a
legal sale, and, as it is in a position to bid more than
any other corporation, it would naturally get away
with the plunder. This surrender might be made
to take effect a year hence, and if anything went
wrong it could, with the consent of the Supervisors,
be withdrawn. In other words, the Geary Street
Company is master of the situation and the Boodler
is shut out.
It pains us to think that the Boodler should
misapprehend our benevolent motives in this mat
ter. Still, any person deterred from well doing by
ingratitude has not the genuine divine spirit in him.
So we take pleasure again in advising the Bood
ler to confine its attention to the Railroad Commis
sion.. That body is friendly. That was sufficiently
shown by the fact that it refused to investigate the
$30,000 "advertising" contract. If there is any
chance to disturb the Southern Pacific the commis
sion will discover it and the Boodler can then
sell its silence for a good round sum.
A NEEDED SUPERVISION.
BY the adoption of a resolution requesting our
delegation at Washington to urge Congress to
enact such laws as will give the proper United
States officers full control of all sailing vessels carry
ing passengers out of our ports, the Chamber of Com
merce has aligned itself on the side of a much needed
reform in our maritime regulations.
The object of the proposed Federal supervision is
to protect sea voyagers in sailing vessels against the
danger of being betrayed into emiferking upon craft
so unseaworthy as to be but little more than death
traps. It appears that at the present time there is
no law, either State or National, designed to provide
such protection. Any kind of an old hulk can be
patched and painted up so as to deceive the unwary
and sent out upon the ocean to the imminent danger
of all on board, but with utter impunity to the men
whose unscrupulous greed is responsible for the
fraud.
We have had many fearful illustrations of the ur
gent need of some supervision over all sailing vessels
that leave our ports. The Chamber of Commerce
in their resolutions name two of them of recent oc
currence: The wrecks of the Helen W. Almy and
the Jane Gray. More. might have been added to the
list, but these two are enough. It should not re
quire a multitude of such dreadful and unnecessary
disasters to convince Congress of the imperative need
ot legislation to guard against them.
While the cause in which the Chamber of Com
merce has directed the attention of our Representa
tives and Senators in Congress is a good one, it will
not be easily won. To bring about in Great Britain
a supervision similar to that asked for from our Gov
ernment required the most tireless and unflagging
work of one of the most earnest and noted reformers
of our time, Mr. Plimsoll. We are not likely to find
in Congress a man to do the work which he did in
Parliament, for he devoted himself to that object
solely, regardless of all other political affairs.
As we are not to have such a zealot to make the
fight at Washington, we must make up for the lack
by greater zeal among the people. Every associa
tion, and, indeed, every individual, who aids the cam
paign of education on the subject will be hailed as
a welcome ally. The Chamber of Commerce having
engaged in the movement should now maintain it
with unceasing energy. Worthless hulks and
painted death traps should no longer be permitted to
sail out of an American port to carry crews and pas
sengers to ocean graves.
WHAT NEXT?
THE various arguments accompanying the re
ports of the Committees on Foreign Affairs, in
Congress, and the message of the President, put
the war with Spain on humanitarian grounds, en
tirely. In no sentence nor phrase is there a sug
gestion of territorial aggrandizement, annexation, or
abandonment of the Monroe doctrine and our tradi
tional policy.
It is true that Morgan of Alabama, Money of Mis
sissippi, Foraker and a few others, for motives per
sonal or political, have made a show of hands in
favor of conquest and colonization. But the matter
has not been discussed broadly or put before the
.country. That we can strip Spain of all her external
possessions is a fact. But we can keep them only
by the strong hand with which we take them. We
must immediately prepare to support a standing army
of not less than 200,000 men and a navy equal to the
united fleets of Continental Europe. These colonies
which we wrest from the feeble hand of Spain have
in the aggregate* nearly 20.000.000 of people, who are
alien to us in blood and language. They cannot as
similate with us. Their location is tropical and
our race cannot 7**>Â»Mt in the tropics. These col

onies cannot be admitted to our body politic, and
their pebple cannot become our fellow citizens. In
the Philippines are three millions of Chinese and
seven millions of mongrel Asiatics, unfit for self
government. Their scoundrelly leader, Aguinaldo,
sold himself once to Spain for $800,000, and now de
sires us to aid in setting him up as dictator of the
Philippines. .
All of these island mongrels and bandits from the
Philippines to the Canaries must be held in subjec
tion, under military domination, if this is a war of
conquest, as the shipping of these great armies of
occupation would indicate. The increase in our mil
itary and naval strength necessary to hold them
against their own will and against the world will mul
tiply the cost of our Federal Government by three.
These countries are all Catholic, and have been
guarded by Spain against religious interference by
other sects. As our colonies, the Protestant mis
sionary will follow the army. Parson and priest will
compete for the soul-saving monopoly under the
stars and stripes. This will supply spark and tinder
for constant conflagration and interference by the
state with the church. '.
It is said now that in addition to these colonies we
must demand a war indemnity of $500,000,000.
Whether history can commend us for beginning an
altruistic and humane war and taking the cost out of
another people is for history to settle.
A strong party is rising in. favor of conquest and
colonization and indemnity.
But there runs through the country the whisper of
a still, small voice. May be it Is the expression of
the. American conscience, which declares that the
United States cannot be so greatened by conquest
nor by imperial colonies, as by saying at the end as
we said in t-he beginning that we made war for hu
manity, in a spirit of self-sacrifice, and when it is
over, beyond the cession of some coaling stations, we
will pay the bill and come home.
A FOOLISH DOCUMENT.
r\ SHORT time ago the directors of the Oakland
/ \ Board of Trade, being moved thereto by
causes unknown, took it upon themselves to
urge Congress to annex the Hawaiian Islands. Not
content with a simple resolution in favor of annexa
tion the inconsiderate directors undertook to furnish
an argument for it. The result was a blunder, dis
playing such ignorance as will convince Congress
that what the Oakland Board of Trade does not know
about commercial routes would fill a book.
Our readers will learn with surprise that the Oak
land men actually urged annexation on the ground
that the islands are needed as a coaling station, be
cause of their proximity to the nearest route to the
Philippines. Lest we may be suspected of misrep
resentation we quote the language of the resolution
on that point. It runs thus:
"Through its central location. North and South
Hawaii lies on the most direct and safest route of
travel between our shores and other countries of the
East, the distance between Manila and San Fran
cisco via Honolulu being approximately iooo miles
shorter than by Unalaska, the only other obtainable
coaling station, which lies away to the north and out
of direct lines of travel."
The directors, having thus made themselves con
spicuous before Congress as advocates of annexa
tion, have doubtless felt enough interest in the sub
ject to read the debates on it. If so, the speech of
Congressman Grosvenor, reported yesterday, must
have awakened in them what are known as "conflict
ing emotions." Grosvenor is the foremost champion
of annexation in the House, and hii speech in some
respects must have been pleasing to them. It must
have been with pain, however, they read that portion
of his argument in which he not only conceded that
"Unalaska, on the Aleutians, now an American pos
session, is 800 miles shorter than the Honolulu route,"
but quoted Commodore Melville to confirm the
fact.
Mr. Grosvenor's argument was quite different from
that of the directors of the Oakland Board of Trade.
Perhaps on the whole it was not more valid, but that
is another question. The point at issue is that cer
tain men, posing as the representatives of the trade
and commerce of Oakland, have sent to Congress a
set of resolutions which show a complete ignorance
of the routes of commerce across the Pacific. The
effect of the resolution will be to discredit Califor
nian commercial bodies in the eyes of Eastern men.
It will be said that if our boards of trade do not know
the comparative merits of various routes for steamers
across the North Pacific, into wliich our port.; open
and along which so much of our foreign â¢ trade is
carried, we are hardly capable of talking intelligently
of commerce much less of carrying it on.
The next time the directors of the Oakland board
undertake to instruct Congress they should first
learn the facts of the subject they propose to deal
with. They will then not have to submit to the mor
tification of having their arguments refuted in Con
gress by the very men they were fondly designed to
help.
THE AUSTRALIAN SENATE.
1 \UBLIC dissatisfaction with the present method
L_y of selecting Senators in the United States as
disclosed by the recent overwhelming vote in
the House of Representatives in favor of their elec
tion by direct vote of the people renders interesting
the plan proposed for that purpose in the constitu
tion recently drawn up for the federation of the Aus
tralian colonies. The plan moreover Is worthy of no
little study and consideration as the latest expression
of Anglo-Saxon sentiment on the subject of the com
position of an upper legislative chamber.
While united Australia, like our own union, is to
be made up of several States, and the Senators are to
be chosen like ours to represent those States, they are
not to be elected by the State Parliaments or Legisla
tures, but by thcpeople. Each original State in the
commonwealth is to have six Senators, and new
States are to have such a number as Parliament
grants at the time of their admission. Senators are to
hold office for. six years, and as they are to be divided
into two classes three from each State will be elected
every third year.
Each elector is to be allowed to vote for but one
Senator, so that minorities will have a chance to ob
tain representation in the Senate whenever they con
trol suffrages enough to poll a vote sufficient to make
their candidate third on the list when the ballots are
counted. Thus the Australian system not only pro
vides for election by direct vote of the people, but
gives minority representation as well, and therefore
differs from our method in two important particulars.
There is no doubt, apparently, that Cervera's ships
are all at Santiago, and that some of them will soon
shift their positions from the top to the bottom of
the bay.
In refusing to give up Hobson, Blanco is creating
more trouble for himself than he really seems to
need.

EDUCATING A
TORPEDO
I WAS shipmate with the Howell torpedo before it had grown to the full
fledged destroying proportions of the present day. As it was then a small,
harmless and imperfect piece of mechanism, I cultivated its acquaintance
â¢without fear and trembling and even grew to treat it with considerable
familiarity, if not with absolute indifference.
This was on board the United States steamer Adams, then stationed on
the western coast of South America, when Commodore Howellâ then captain
was in command of that vessel, and I was his clerk, or writer, as that very
useful though humble personage is called in the navy. The
regulation place of my office was down on the berthdeck,
but owing to the exceptional kindliness of Captain Howell
I managed to move all my books and papers into his after
cabin, where I did a little work and much loafing on the
sofas, easy chairs and other comfortable furniture of that
apartment. I can even now see the tall,- fine-looking officer
walking fore and aft through the cabin dictating. a letter
to the department, his hands clasped behind his back, his
mind half on his invention and half on the communication
destined for Washington. He was a very religious man \
and as our ship was not large enough, or, In naval lingo, did ;
not "carry enough guns" to rate a chaplain Captain Howell
would hold divine service himself every Sunday. "We had
a church choir, led by Johnson, the bugler, a mighty man
of swear words on board and whisky drinking on shore.
When Johnson was sleeping off a wild and woolly "liberty" j
spree down on the berthdeck the marine firer would lead !

the choir. He diun t like the job and used to grumble for
ward about not shipping for "sky work," but knowing that
tne choir stood well with the commander-chaplain on the
shore-leave question he sacrificed % his feelings and would
shrill his pipe to heaven in unison* with our vocal chords.
One Sunday morning the solemnity of the occasion was
wrecked by the appearance of Johnson on the quarterdeck
with his cornet in his hand, a "beautiful" black eye adorn
ing the starboard side of his figurehead and insisting that
the singers should tackle "Pull for the Shore, Sailor," and
no other piece. The earthly sentiment of the song appealed
to him as he wanted another drink with all his soul, but
the peculiar trend of his musical desires pulled him into the
"brig." When he was released from confinement, sober and
penitent, he swore off and took the pledge, all of which
vows he faithfully kept until he went on liberty again. Our
singing became a sort of sacred jcla among the scoffers
forward, but we were solid with the chaplain and that
meant many privileges to which they were not eligible. But
I started in tt> tell about the education of that torpedo.
Captain Howell passed much of his time in the "bath '
room of the aftercabin, from which little apartment I could
hear him talking to himself. Often in moments of ab
straction he would talk through the open door to me. From
the intelligence shown in my replies I might have been in
abstraction also. He was working over a model of his tor
pedo and his conversation was mere thinking "out loud."
He would grow tired of talking to the little machine and
for a change would "think out loud" to me.
Occasionally he would call me from my desk to the bath
room door and I would find him leaning over the tub with
his arms thrust deeply down in the water monkeying with
the model. In his preoccupation he had forgotten to roll up
his sleeves or even remove his coat or cuffs. Consequently
he would be dripping wet from neck to knees. The affair
was about the size of a full-grown salmon and resembled
that fish to a great extent and when its clockwork was
OLD SALT AMUSED.
wound up it would slash and splash around in the tub not
unlike the struggles of that creature. During his handling
of the frantic thing the captain would explain in detail the.
peculiar wayÂ«ln which it was destined to shoot ahead on its
deadly submarine mission. As I didn't understand one jot
or tittle of the matter my observations were about as wise
as the creaking: of a topsail sheet block. But the inventor,
wrapped in the maneuvers of his model, failed to weigh my
words or even hear them. Possibly our discussions were
highly entertaining to each other and may be in some way
he drew inspiration from my answers.
After the torpedo had grown to more completeness, and
consequently out of the bath tub, he would give it an outing,
or rather inning, on the bay. The steam launch would be
called away and a bit of shallow water selected for the sea
trials. Many little mishaps occurred during those torpedo
testa that summer very amusing to the launch's crew and
very expensive to the captain.
In its divings below the surface it would occasionally
fail to come up again, and Shermanâ Sherman was the
skipper's chief assistant and torpedo expert in these trials
would be sent in pursuit. He was a leather-hued man from the land of the
kanaka, and was more at home in the water than was the torpedo. Sherman
would follow i,t overboard like a brown seal and would convoy it along quite
fraternally. Whenever it settled down in the mud to rest he would haul it
up to action again. I believe that torpedo fairly hated Sherman and not
only tried to break off the aquatic association with him by hiding away in
the darkest and deepest places of the bay, but it even tried to do him an
injury. Of course it was only a pqwderless model and an earnest of Â»'.anger
to come, but it had a sharp nose which it used on Sherman's naked body
several times. One day in particular, while on its under-surface flight with
Sherman swimming some distance in its wake, the rudder got flung hard-a
port by the dash of a wave and the torpedo took a short circle, coming back
toward Sherman. He was paddling leisurely along watching for the bubbles
ahead, which, arising from the machine, would indicate its whereabouts,
when, smash: came a sharp point in his starboard ribs. That malicious
miniature torpedo had stolen a march on him and had rammed him with all
its small strength.
Sherman, thinking that a swordflsh had struck him and that he had been
stabbed to death, was almost paralyzed with terror. He floundered around
and kicked the torpedo away from him, which, still being pointed in his
direction with its tiny propeller buzzing busily away, returned to the attack
jammng its nose into the pit of his stomach.
Then Sherman found his voice and the use of his strong limbs and yell
ing like a mad man for help he dug out for the steam launch as fast as* his
sweeping arms and kicking legs could drive him. He wae hauled aboard the
boat, bleeding from several vicious scratches, half dead with fright, while the
torpedo arose to the surface, as if looking around for more kanakas to lick
in fair, open fight.
It was some time before Captain Howell could persuade Sherman to take
another swim with that torpedo, and only by convincing the timid islander
that it was a swordfish and not the machine that had assaulted him could
he be induced to take part in any more torpedo trial trips. But the tempta
tion of five dollar gold pieces, which the captain was liberal with, made Sher
man willing to dare the monsters of the deep and he passed the summer
herding that torpedo at sea and drinking whisky on shore. When Sherman
was too drunk foe deep-sea diving the captain used the bath tub.

PENSION BILLS PASS
IN VERY SHORT ORDER
During the Senate's Session Thirty-
Two Go Through in Thirty-
Three Minutes.
WASHINGTON, June 15.â After passing
a number of pension bills and listening
to a carefully prepared report on the ad
vantages of Republican tariff legislation
by Pritchard of North Carolina the Sen
ate to-day resumed consideration of the
lnternationpl bank bill. An amendment
was accepted by the committee extending
the privileges of the measure to all citi
zens of the United States instead of re
stricting them to those mentioned in
the bill. When the Senate adjourned con
sideration of the bill was not concluded.
During the consideration of the pension
calendar thirty-two bills were passed in
thirty-three minutes. Among the bills
passed was one increasing the pension of
Sirs. Margaret Love Skerritt, widow of
Rear Admiral SKerritt, from $30 to $50 a
month.
Cockrell of Missouri reported from the
Military Affairs Committee a bill to pro
mote the administration of Justice in the
army and asked for its immediate con
sideration. ' The bill provides for the ad
ministration of justice by a summary
court. It was passed.
At 4:35 the bank bill was laid aside, the
Senate went into executive session and
soon afterward adjourned.

PRITCHARD ON
PROSPERITY
Benefits of Republican
Rule Set Forth.
GREAT CHANGE IN CONDITIONS
PREDICTIONS OF GOOD TIMES
ARE FULFILLED.
Vast Increase in Commercial Trans
actions Owing to the Wiee Policy
of the Party of Lincoln
and McKinley.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, June 15.â 1n the
course of an â¢ extended speech in the
Senate to-day upon "the benefits of
Republican rule," Pritchard (R.) of
North Carolina said:
The great change which has taken place
in the financial, commercial and economic
conditions of our country since the in
auguration of a Republican President and
the enactment of a Republican tariff law,
directs attention again to the benefits
which have invariably flowed from the
administration of the Government by the
great party of Lincoln, Grant and McKin
ley. Not in many years, if ever, have
the material prospects of the United
States been as bright as they are to-day;
and for this the wise and patriotic legis
lation formed and passed by the Repub
lican party is responsible.
A prediction made public by the Bureau
of Statistics recently might well have
been received with amazement and in
credulity by Uiose who have not followed
carefully the trend of our national trade
during the year. To suggest that the
balance of trade in favor of the United
States for one year could, much less
would reach the prodigious sum of $600,
000,000 seemed like idle folly. Never before
in the histury of the nation has the favor
able trade balance been half that much.
And yet the prediction was well founded
and unless the law of probabilities fail,
the trade balance, which for the ten
months ending April 30 was $514 .245. 49."),
will be over six hundred millions by June
30. The nearest approach to this extraor
dinary record was last year, when the
balance in our favor was $286,263,144.
It is estimated that for the full fiscal
year the net amount of coin received in
partial settlement of our huge merchan
dise balance will be at least $100,000,000.
This is more than double any previous
cash balance for one year, the largest
having been $4,053,200 for the year 1579.
After describing agricultural and
commercial trials through which the
South has passed, Pritchard said:
P.ut a brighter day has dawned. Out of
the wreck of scheme and ill-founded hopes
has arisen a new generation, who, work
ing with head, hand and heart, are rais
ing the Southern States to a pha.ee where
prosperity, plenty and happiness shall be
the familiar portion of their people. In
the front rank of States that are working
out a splendid destiny stands North Caro
lina. No State has greater possibilities;
none greater need of the fostering care
that flows from the Republican control of
the Government.
The citizens of my State have not been
backward in entering upon the develop
ment of her industries and the whirr of
spindle and the click of the loom in hun
dreds of cotton mills are dally teaching
her people the groat lesson of industrial
expansion. Prosperity has come to North
Carolina to stay. This year there is a
boom. Farm products are from 15 to 40
per cent advanced. Horses are 75 per cent
higher than in 1*97 and few to be had
Poultry is 150 per cent above last year!
The lumber industry that was prostrated
in 1896-fi" is active and prosperous. To
bacco is higher than in four years.
Such is the news that comes to our ears
not oniy from North Carolina, but from
every part of this great country. The
song of an ever-widening, ever-deepening
prosperity is in every ear and this after
less than a year of protective tariff legis
lation.

SUCCESS OF
WAR LOANS
To Be Taken by Popu
lar Subscriptions.
MADE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN
TWO PROPOSITIONS, EACH COV
ERING THE FULL AMOUNT.
J. Pierpont Morgan at the Head of a
Syndicate That Is Ready and
Will Take All of the Two
Hundred Million Issue.
WASHINGTON, June 15.â 1f there
was ever any question about the suc
cess of the new 3 per cent war loans it
has been set at rest by the way in
which subscriptions are already coming
in at the Treasury Department. The
I assurance of the success of the loan
has, however, been made absolutely
certain by two propositions, each cov
| ering the entire present issue of $200,
; 000,000. The subscription of the Na
tional City Bank, the Central Trust
Company and Vermyea & Co., made
the day the loan was opened, was for
any part of the total issue that should
not be taken by the public. Another
proposal was formulated the same day
covering the entire amount. It came
; from J. Pierpont Morgan and a number
i of associates.
The Treasury Department regards
j the spirit shown in the proposition as
\ particularly praiseworthy. It is set
I forth in a preamble to the proposition
I and, says:
"Whereas, It is the opinion of the un
dersigned, that, although the amount ot
fered will be largely over-subscribed, it
is essential that the secretary should be
assured of the absolutely unqualified suc
cess of the issue by an advance subscrip
tion of the entire amount, and
Whereas, In the opinion of the under
signed, for the purpose of carrying out
these ends, a syndicate should be formed
who shall agree In advance to subscribe
at par for the whole amount of such issuo
of $2<X),000,000 or such thereof as may not
be subscribed for by the general public;
Therefore, now. we the undersigned,
agree to accept firm participation in any
such syndicate to the extent of the
amounts set against our names:
By this preamble the subscribers ex
press the opinion that the loan will be
subscribed for independently of this
action on their part, and besides they
have no wish to interfere in any way
with the popular character of the loan
as desired by Congress and the ad
ministration. Their only desire is that
without delay whatever the Govern
ment should be assured of the full
amount asked for. The subscribers to
the syndicate are as follows:
J. P. Morgan & Co. of New York, $20 -
000,000.
Harvey Flsk and Sons of New York
$20,0(X>,000.
First National Bank of New York $20 -

ous Opposition.
Special DUcatch to The C&H.
Call Office, Rlggs House,
Washington, June 15.
The Pacific Railroads seem to bÂ«
again in full control of the fcouse Com
mittee. The resolution of Representa
tive Magruire calling upon the Presi
dent for information concerning thÂ«
Kansas and Central Pacific foreclosure
sales was taken up in the House Pa
cific Railroads Committee to-day, and
by a vote of 4 to 1 was tabled.
Those voting against the resolutions
were: Powers, Hepburn, Faris and
Codding. Maguire cast the only vote
In favor of his resolution. Hepburn of
lowa took occasion to remark that the
resolutions were introduced at this
time for political effect, and Maguire
retorted:
"Then why should you table the reso
lutions? Is not your action a confes
sion of fear that the President's an
swer will not be satisfactory to the
people? If, as you say, my resolutions
are for political effect, why don't you
report them favorably to the House
and thus secure a political advantage
for your own party?"
Hepburn replied that his party was
not attempting to legislate for the ad
vantage of either one or the other po
litical party.
It transpired to-day that when the
deficiency appropriation bill reached
the Senate for action Gear of lowa,
chairman of the Committee on Pacific
Roads, would make an attempt to at
tach to It a rider providing for the ap
pointment of a commission to settle
the Pacific roads debt. This, in the
opinion of Senators White and Perkins,
Representative Maguiro and other Cal
ifornia Congressmen, would be equiva
lent to a refunding bill, and the Cali
fornia Senators will vigorously oppose
it. They believe that it ought to be
ruled out on a point of order, for, be
ing "new legislation," it is clearly not
germane to a regular appropriation
bill.

Conttnued from I ; Pag*.
nlla. General Merriam was on board the

It seams to be the general Impression
at military headquarters that instead of
waiting to gret reads eight or nine ves
sels for th.' third Philippine expedition
ihe next fleet will be composed of only
four or five steamers, which can be put
in condition for Bailing early next week.
It is intimated that tho military authori
ties here urged by the War
Department to push the troops to the
front with tho quickest dispatch possible
and not to wait fur the assembling of a
large lieot. This plan will necessitate the
oending of Beveral small ilotillus In rapid
succession.
By command of Major General Merriam

CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR.
Progress of the Good Work at
Camp Merritt.
General W. H. I* Barnes addressed the

The Christian Endeavorcrs have secured

Meetings at the headquarters continue
to grow in Interest. On Saturday evening
between 600 and 700 soldiers were present.
The fine i>r^K'r;i.mme was greatly enjoyed.
Mrs. Harrington. State president of the
Red Cross, and Mrs. Merrill were on the
platform, and were enthusiastically re

THE THIRD CONTINGENT WILL SOON SAIL
Three Full Regiments Selected to Make a Part of
the Next Expedition.
â¢It can be positively stated that the third expedition to Manila, which will
here In about seven days, will consist of three full regiments and
nl. .. ut 1000 other soldiers drawn from the different troops now at Camp Mer-
The next transports to sail will be the Morgan City, Indiana, City of
Para and Ohio, and the loading of those vessels has begun.
is no doubt but that Brigadier General Charles King will be in
command of the third expedition. This is an open secret among the officers
at (â¢;,),,;, Merritt. Jhe next expedition will consist of the Seventh California,
ThirtiÂ» nth Minnesota and one of the Dakotas or First Montana Rfgim<-nt.
The two Idaho battalions also will go, and in all probability the remainder of
the Corps of Engineers, with the. three companies of the Fourteenth In
tantry that hp.ve been recently recruit> d.
Orders were Issued yesterday to the commanding: officers of the Seventh
California, Thirteenth Minnesota and Idaho battalions, instructing them to
. a detail with five days' rations to guard the boats. The Seventh
California will guard the Indiana; the Thirteenth Minnesota, the City of
Para, and the Idaho battalions the Horgan city. From this it would seem
â  .. troops are to go on the vessels named, as heretofore it has been
the custom for regiments to furnish guards for *he transports upon which
they sailed.
Private Harris will take the double stripe
abandoned by Corporal James.
Private Goddard. Company E, and Pri
vate Hoburg, Company M, who were left
sick with measles in Sioux â  Falls when
the South Dakota troops came West, re
ported for duty to Colonel Frost yester
day.
The health and general moral tone of
Colonel Frost's command la remarkably
above the average, possibly because of the
rule that Colonel Frost has followed in
allowing only 10 per cent of his men out
at night, and then only until 1 o'clock.
They also get six good hours of drilling
every day, and that practice on the part
of the two Dakotaa and the lowas Is win
ning commendation frpm every regular
officer In camp.
The three battalions of the First Mon
tanas varied the monotony of drill Tues
day with a mild sham battle. ''Che Third
Battalion intrenched itself near the line
Of the woods on the Presidio hills and
succeeded in holding off the bloodthirsty
hosts of the First and Second battalions
for nearly two hours. Every officer in
camp turned out excepting Colonel Kess
ler and the officer of the day. They had
hoped to be in at the death, but the war
riors in the trenches' bravely sustained
a series of heavy onslaughts until time
was called.
NEVADA CAVALRY.

Notes of the CamÃ.
The commanders of the regular troops !
at Camp Merritt have Issued an order pro- j
hibiting all recruits from having posses- j
sion of ball cartridges until they have j
been thoroughly familiarized with the use ',
of the new Krag-Jorgensen rifles.
Brigadier General Mac Arthur took din
ner yesterday with Colonel Loper and his
; officers of the Fifty-first lowa, and took
| advantage of the opportunity to announce
, that lie had come to stay. The general's
; headquarters are established, and L.ieu
tenant F. J. Kernan of the Twenty-first
i Infantry has been detailed as adjutant of
i the brig-ado.
The First South Dakota have become
quite prolicient In the "monkey" or physi-
S eal exercise drill that has of late years
| become popular with the jackles of the
navy. It 1h now a -feature of regular
(â trap practice.
The Endeavor headquarters Is now fit
i ted up with chairs, so that all who attend
| can be seated. The large rooms are now
very tastily decorated with flags and dif
.ferent colored banners representing ketch
county In the State. The C. E. societies
of the city are deeply interested in the
work being done for the soldiers, and

CALIFORNIA BIDS
FAREWELL TO
THE TROOPS
Continued from First Paga.
dozen cards fluttered down at a time.
All the fine, young courage of the
words upon them, all the tender long
ing for sympathy in the glow of it, all
the pathos of this parting of stranger
from stranger will come back â¢to a
quieter hour when these boys are
across seas face to face with the foe,
when the lists come in from the wars
with the names of the wounded and
the dead.
A young lad with a sensitive face
stood a little apart from his comrades
and looked out over the rail of the
China with big, lonely eyes. A little
child on a tug fuming alongside stu
died him doubtfully. Then a sweet soul
spoke out of her little six years or so
of worldly experience:
"Good-by, soldier," she called softly.
He did not hear and her face fell. She
waited a moment and then she called
again:
"Soldier, good-by; good-by, soldier."
The boy heard this time and saw. He
colored with surprise and a Bort of
grladnoss came into his face, but he
looked to see if there was another to
dispute the honor with him. The little
girl's eyes never wandered. When his
own came back to her they were full of
tears.
"Good-by, little girt," he said, put
ting out his arms to her, "Good-by, lit
tle girl."
â¢ At one o'clock the China hoisted the
blue Peter and a thrill swept along the
water front. The Senator had cast her
breast lines and slid out into the
stream. The small fry on the bay put
excitedly toward Meiggs wharf, the
tugs and ferry steamers waited for the
flagship to take the lead. The Colon
and Zealandia followed her and the
Senator fell in after them. The whistles
sounded along shore and screamed
across .the water. The crowd rushed
to the edge of the piers, cheering and
waving hats and hands. Heads came
out of the windows on Telegraph Hill,
a line of men topped it stiffly, like a
row of firs. At Meigrga .wharf the
crowd ran shouting along the pier.
From Black Point, to Fort Point the
soldiers on shore cheered the soldiers
going to sea. The men on the trans
ports were mad with the excitement of
the Btart. They crushed the decks,
swarmed the rigging, climbed to the
topsail yard, waved and shouted,
cheered and cried.
They left the chasing tugs behind
Just this side of the Fort The wind
at the Heads caught their voices and
carried them out to sea. Beyond the
Golden Gate the fog waited and they
slipped into the mist like ships that
pass in dreams.
SERIOUS BLUNDER OF

Twenty-fifth streets on the way home
they noticed- the policemen chasing a j
crowd of boys. Schmidt and Hanley
stood on the corner interested spectators
of the chase. Failing to catch the boys
whom they were after the officious po-
Ucemen. espying Hanley and Schmidt,
approached them and without attempting
to ask them for an explanation placed
them under arrest despite their protes
tations. They were taken to the Seven
teenth-street station and charged with
obstructing the sidewalk.
Their parents on being informed of
their arrest visited the station and put up
the necessary cash bail for their appear
ance in- court.
The following: day, when their cases
were called In Judge Low's court, the
boys were, adjudged guilty without the
formality of a trial.
Policeman King, shortly after court con
vened, whispered to Judge Low that he
was anxious to secure a conviction, as he
realized he had made a mistake and the
boys parents would prefer charges
against him with the Police Commission

their innocence but for some unexpla!:-* â â '

TIGHTS WORN
AT WELLESLEY
Classic Shades Caused
to Blush.
FAIR GRADUATES IN A PLAY
APPEAR IN SHAKESPEAREAN
ROLES IN COSTUME.
However Much Classic Boston May
Be Shocked, the Performanca
Was Pleasing to Spec
tators.
Special Dispatch "to The Call.
BOSTON, June 15.â The shades of
classic Wellesley blushed to-night as
they never did before. For the first
time in the history of the famous
strait-laced old Puritanical institu
tion the young lady students appeared
to-night before a mixed audience in
tights, real, unadulterated tights, the
self-same wicked garments in which
the naughty chorus girls do their high
kicking in the ballet. It is a shocking
comparison, but a truthful one, al
though, of course, the Wellesley girls
didn't kick.
The occasion of this was the startling
but charming exhibition of the graces
of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" by
the Shakespearean society of the col
lege. Not only was this method of cos
tuming an astonishing innovation at
Wellesley, but it is absolutely unprece
dented in the history of the high-class
female .seminaries ofthe entire country.
Never before have any of the fair pu
pils of any of the famous colleges dis
played their charms in tights to an au
dience composed of both sexes.
The play was out of dc-ors to-night,
and as it was quite chilly and damp the
young actresses shivered in their scant
attire. The use of tights to-night is
defended by those in charge on the
ground that to costume male charac
ters In any other than the masculine
dress serves but to accentuate the
prudish modesty of the actress and to
exhibit, in fact, a false modesty unnec
essary. But however shocked "the Bos
ton bluestockings will be and whatever
amazement the critics may voice, the
fact cannot be contradicted that the
spectacle was a must beautiful one, and
that the young women turned the
greensward into a veritable fairy bower
ami presented a most charming and ac
ceptable rendition-of the play to an au
dience whose ardor was not in the least
dampened by the fact that the girls
wore tights.
Under Police Protection.
Fred Smith, Street, swore to a
complaint in Judge I^ow's court yester
day for the arrest of Martin Racxett
poolroom proprietor, on the charge of
battery. Smith alleged that Raggett met
him Tuesday and, after accusing him of
giving information to the detectivos by
whom he was protected, knocked him
down and thrashed him.

President Recommends That the Offi
cer Be Advanced Ten Numbers
for His Extraordinary
Bravery.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MADRID, June 15. â ihe Government
has authorized Governor General
Blanco to entertain proposals for an
exchange of Lieutenant Hobson and the
other prisoners taken when the Ameri
can collier Merrimac was sunk off the
entrance to the harbor of Santiago de
Cuba.
NEW YORK, June 15.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Presi
dent McKinley will to-morrow send to
the Senate the nomination of Rich
mond Hobson to be advanced ten num
bers for extraordinary heroism.
This will be the reward which the
young assistant naval constructor Is to
receive. Its immediate effect -will be
to advance him to the grade of naval
constructor with the relative rank of
full lieutenant and place him in a po
sition where two years hence he will be
promoted to the relative rank of com
mander, a rank which he could not
have obtained had it not been for his
display of heroism, until 1922. His pay
will at once be increased 51000 a year.
What Hobson will probably regard as
the highest reward, however, will be
the fact that he will become a senior
officer of the corns in 1904, and hold the
position until 1932, when he will go on
the retired list.

A PLAY BY GENERAL KING,
The Author-Soldier's "Fort Fraune" Will Be
Presented bu the Frawleys.
On June 27 the Frawley company will produce "Fort Frayne," a new
military play from the pen of Brigadier General Charles King, who is now
In this city under General Merritt. "Fort Frayne" has appeared on the
boards in one other Instance, an engagement In Chicago last year, when It
ran for four consecutive weeks and was withdrawn only to make room for
other contracted plays on which a time for production had been set. The
story. "Fort Frayne," was written from the play, contrary to the usual
custom, and it is but an amplification of it with the necessary addition of
Incidents that a novel demands.
"Yes, 1 first wrote the play," said General King yesterday in dis
rupting the forthcoming presentation at the hands of the Frawleys. "It
seemed to tnke so well when played in Chicago that I determined to write a
novel, using the plot and action of the play. 'Fort Frayne' ran four weeks
in Chicago during the very hottest weather, and all we intended for it was
a two weeks" presentation. The scene is laid In Wyoming, and tue back
ground is the barrack life on the frontier. It Is romance, a tale of love,
heroism and villainy. Though it is a military play It is one without a fight.
My characters are pretty well classified into three groups. In the play
there is one bad man, and he is bad, seven good men and five women, all of
whom are angels. I think the play furnishes some very stirring incidents
and I hope it will please the San Francisco public."
An elaborate production will be given by the Frawley company, both in
the staging and the accessories. "Fort Frayne" is replete with rousing
situations and in som* cases is melodrama of a high order. The story is one
of the hairbreadth adventures of field and flood and escapes in the deadly
imminent breach and all thereto pertaining. There Is a scene where an
officer stems the current to reach his bride's side like Troilus and Cressida
of old. Excitement there is in abundance, but no battle of any description
other than the fierce meetings of the villain and the hero. The villain is
of high degree and the only blot on a proud escutcheon. For four acts he
makes life miserable fur the young captain, the hero, and the heroine, who
is one of the five angelic women the play contains.
It is very doubtful whether General King will be in this city when the
piny Is produced. On the first night the author-soldier may be riding the
salty deep with the reality of war about him, and not in a box watching
his creations moving about on a stage set with a military dressing.
CORONER HAD
A BUSY DAY
Three Suicides Engage
His Attention.
I. DANGLADA SHOT HIMSELF.
SAMUEL CLINE ENDS HIS LIFE
WITH PRUSSIC ACID.
Physicians Try to Resuscitate an
Unknown Drowned Man at
the Harbor Hos
pital.
Three suicides engaged the attention of
the Coroner's office yesterday. The most
prominent of the trio was IgnaHo Dang
lada, a well-known customs broker who
shot himself through the heart at his resi
dence, 2021 Broderick street. Nervous
prostration brought on by overwork is
attributed by his family as a cause for
ending his existence.
J. L. Tierney. his son-in-law, stated that
he spoke to the dec-eased five minutes bo
fore the fatal shot was fired. When he
heard the report he ran to his father-in
law's room and found him dead.
The deceased was 52 years of age and
well known in business circles. He was a
member of the firm of Mattoon & Dang
lada, custom brokers, doing business at
506 Battery street. During the past week
he has been under the care of hla
daughter and has been slightly out of his
mind. No thought was given to the pos
sibility of his taking his life, and the act
has shocked the family. He leaves a son,
Arthur F., and a daughter, Mrs. J. L.
Tierney.
Samuel Cllne, a retired tailor, living at
Sacramento street, was found on
Btrawberry Hill yesterday with a bottle
of prussic acid at his side and a card fas
tened to his coat and bearing the follow
ing inscription: "My name is Samuel Cline
and I live at 1002 Sacramento Btreet."
His body was removed to the morgue
and his family notitled.
They can assign no reason whatever for
the deed. He left the house early in the
morning apparently in good spirits and
gave no sign of what he intended doing.
It is thought, however, that he became
discouraged at the continued illness of h|s
daughter and took his life to ease his
mind. Cllne was well-to-do, owning his
home and having other property. He
leaves two sons and three daughters.
The body of an unknown man was found
yesterday morning floating off Mission
street wharf, and was tied to a pile while
awaiting the arrival of the Coroner's dep
uty with the Morgue wagon. When the
body was taken out of the water Deputy
Coroner O'Brien noticed that there was a
pulsation in the neck of the supposed
corpse and at once removed the body to
the Harbor Emergency Hospital where
the physician worked for fifteen mirfutes
in the effort to resusticate the man, but
he was too far gone, and was taken to thu
morgue and placed on the "unidentified"
slab. The body is that of a man about
40 or 45 years of age, fair romnlexinn.
sandy hair and mustache and light blue
eyes. He appeared to be a Sctt-farmg
man.
NORMAL CLASS GRADUATES.
Interesting Commencement Exercises
at the Girls' High School.
There was a large audience at the Girls'
High School last night to witness and
hear the graduating exercises of the San
Francisco Normal School. Nearly a hun
dred young ladies completed their studies
creditably and received their diplomas
last night. The exercises were interest
ing throughout and had the merit of be
ing brief enough to preserve the good
humor of the audience. The essays were
quite Interesting and the musical pro
gramme was often encored. Superintend
ant Webster had general charge of the
exercises of the evening.
A Decision on State Bonds.
Samuel Davis held a number of Cali
fornia State securities known as "Indian
War Bonds," to which several coupons
were attached. These bonds had reached
their maturity. The Board of Examiners
refused to allow the interest on the
coupons since maturity and Davis sued
the State for the same. In the lower court
he was allowed judgment for the face
value of the coupons, but the court de
nied him relief as to the interest proposi
tion. From this he appealed and yester
day the Supreme Court affirmed the judg
ment of the lower court.

Trouble Over Raisins.
The Supreme Court has affirmed the de
cision and Judgment of the Superior Court
of Fresno County in the case of H. Ava
kian against George B. Noble & Bro.,
raisin packers. It was an action to re
cover damages for trespass committed by
the Nobles in seizing a quantity of raisins
owned by the plaintiff. Avaklan's grow
ing crop of grapes had been sold to the
Nobles, secured by a chattel mortgage.
An agent of the packers while on the
plaintiff's premises discovered a lot of
raisins which be seized by force, despite
THE SAEf FRAK CISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE 16, 1898.
the protest of Avakian that they were not
uf the lot upon which- the Nobles had a
claim. It was necessary to use force in
making the seizure and in the lower court
the aggrieved one sued for $2300 damages,
although the value of the raisins seized
waa only $300. He received judgment for
$525 and from this the Nobles appealed.
The higher court held that the punitive
damages were not excessive.; that the
Nobles were responsible for the acts of
their agent, and the judgment was af
iirmed.
PHARMACEUTICAL GRADUATES.

Thirty-seven bright young men received
the title of graduate in pharmacy at the
California College of Pharmacy last

FAKE SUICIDE
AT THE PALACE
Walter D. Humiston Says
He Took Poison.
BUT COULD NOT HOLD IT
SENT A CHECK TO PAY FOB HIS
CREMATION.
Kept Two Ounces of Laudanum in
His System Until Morning and
Was Roasted by the Coroner
for Being an Ass.
When Coroner Hawkins opened his
morning mail yesterday he found a letter
reading as follows:
Palace Hotel, San Francisco, Cal., June 14,
1888.
The Coroner, San Francisco, Cal.â Dear Sir:
Tou will find my remains in room 766 of the
Palace Hotel if there is any virtue in a cou
ple of ounces of laudanum.
Enclosed you will (md ny- check on the First
National Bank for *7R, with which I want you
to have my body cremated. The ashes you
may hold for inet ructions from my mother,
Mrs. Hattie A. Humtston, 809 East Fifteenth
street. Minneapolis. Minn. I want no services
of any kind.
If you find jroa have more funds than you
need, please forward the money to my mother.
I have been in California about a year and
HE FLIRTED WITH DEATH.
WALTER D. HUMISTON, Whose Arranged Suicide
Did Not Come Off According to Programme.
have always been a good deal of a wanderer.
The ptust two months I have spent in Stockton.
Now, for one reason and another. I am tired
of it all and want a restâ only that.
I am not actuated by disappointment, love or
financial embarrassment, nor have I a past
which I am trying to escape that would make
interestiiiK reudlng.
My life has been quite the ordinary one, ex
cept, perhaps, that 1 have hnd too much hap
piness, which I have not appreciated. Just
a case, my dear sir, ot one very tired and
perhapÃ a little cynical.
Insane, you will say. Perhaps; why not
let it rest that way. sinct? people must have an
explanation of some kind?
By to-morrow friends will be aware of what
I have done and may want to look at me
again, therefore I would ask that you hold
me for a day or two before cremating me.
I deprecate your trouble and thank you In
advance. Cordially youre,
WALTER D. HUMISTON.
Deputy Coroner McCormlck at once set
out for the Palace Hotel and made in
quiry' for Humiston at the clerk's desk.
He was informed that a man of that name
had taken a room on the evening before
and was still there. The deputy and his
clerk went upstairs and entered the room,
where they found Humison on the bed
waiting for cremation. Ho was dressed,
but was in his stocking feet, in accord
ance with the California prejudice against
the act of dying with boots on. The
corpse looked perfectly fresh and natural,
and when Mr. McCormlck approached the
bed the dead man slowly raised a wan
and tearful face, expressive of great fa
tigue and disgust, and gave vent to a
sickly groan.
"You're a nice fellow," remarked Mc-
Cormick, in a tone that expressed much
disgust, as the expression of the face of
the fake suicide. "What are you up to?"
A groan was the reply.
The fake corpse saw that an apology
was necessary, and he therefore sat up
in bed and explained that at 11 o'clock on
the evening before he had swallowed the
contents of a bottle of laudanum, but that
his stomach had rejected the poison. He
had done all he couid to carry out the in
tention expresed In his letter, but, while
his spirit was willing, his stomach was
weak, and greatly to his dlsgu6t and dis
appointment he had remained alive.
Humiston is a young man of about 22 or
23 years of age. He professed to be tired
of life and was evidently desirous of
notoriety. After putting on his shoes he
called a coupe and drove to the Coroner's
office to recover a check which he had en
closed in the letter to the Coroner. The
check was on a blank form of the First
National Bank.
To the reporters Humiston said that he
was tired of life, and that he was dis
pleased that the drug had not had the de
sired effect. It was not believed at the
Coroner's office that Humiston took the
poison at all, but that he had thrown the
contents of the bottle away. It was sus
pected that his queer actions were de
signed for the purpose of melting the
heart of Borne obdurate woman who had
declined to love him. He said that while
he did not desire to live he had changed
his nllnd for the present and would leave
for Stockton on the afternoon boat.
During the afternoon Humiston walked
into the Coroner's office and introducing
himself asked for the return of his check.
The Coroner declined to recognize him as
Humiston. He reminded the visitor that
Humiston was legally dead and that
therefore he could not be the rightful
owner of the check. Then the. alleged
suicide was put through a rigorous cross
examination. He told the Coroner that he
went to the Tivoli last Tuesday evening
and that after he went to room 766 in the
hotel, wrote the letter he sent to the
Coroner and then took the poison.
The upshot of the examination was that
the check remained at the Morgue office
for want of proper identification of the
owner of it.
STOCKTON, June 15.â Humister is a
consumptive, who came to this coast a
year and a half ago from his home in
Minneapolis. He was in Stockton for a
few days on a visit to a friend, and left
for San Francisco yesterday. Little is
known of him here.

THE COUNTRY MALIGNED
HOW JUSTICE IS DISPENSED
AND WELCOMED.
W. F. Berry, Who Has Just Returned
From tiie Northwest Territory,
Gives Observations of
His Trip.
W. F. Berry, an observing and progres
sive business man of San Francisco, re
turned yesterday morning from a trip to
Alaska and the Northwest Territory- He
pictures the Territory as prosperous, and
does not corroborate the stories of law
lessness and disaster which frequently
come from the north.
Speaking of his journey yesterday, Mr.
Berry remarked:
"I think it is due to the people of Cali
fornia to know the truth concerning af
fairs in that region of country. I left
San Francisco the first week in April, and
went to Seattle. From the sound I went
to Skaguay on the Queen, touching at
the regular ports. Affairs at Skaguay
have been misrepresented. I believe the
town has a promising future. There are
merchants in the place who transact
business on business principles. They
have good credit, as I know from Eastern
â  houses. There are stores in Skaguay that
| would be creditable to any city in Cali
fornia outside of San Francisco and Oak
land. One going there for business and
attending to business is as safe in Skag
uay as in Oakland. The rough side is
very rough indeed, but one is not bound
to run against it."
In regard to the progress of Skaguay,
Mr. Berry observed: "Water mains have
been put in, connecting the town with a
lake supply of excellent water. House
connections have not been put in, but the
pure water is delivered in carts and sold
at 5 cents a bucket. A railway is in
course of construction from the town to
Whie Pass. Three miles have been con
structed, and 300 men are now at work.
| The company is advertising for 6000 men.
It is announced that the line will be com
pleted to Lake Bennett early next Novem
ber. The construction parties can work
twenty hours a day through the summer. ,
"I went over the White Pass on foot,"
j said Mr. Berry, "and there is more than
' a trail from Skaguay to the summitâ it
is a road over which one may travel
without much inconvenience. It is an
easy walk as life on the frontier goes
from Skaguay to the White Pass Hotel.
I saw rough men, 'sure thing' gamblers
and bad characters on the road, but if one
lets them alone they are not inclined to
interfere. 1 went into the Northwest Ter
ritory about fourteen miles from the head
of Lake Bennett, and I do want to cay
for the Northwest mounted police under
the authority of the Canadian Govern
ment that they administer justice im
partially, and under their influence a
man's life is safe and his property is pro
| tected. . I am a loyal American and have
] as high a regard for American institu
j tlons as any other one, but I must say
that the administration of affairs by the
Canadian authorities is superior to that
in Alaska where the United States Gov
ernment and the Territorial officers ex
ercise authority. The Canadian officer in
command has absolute. authority. He ad
ministers Justice, extends help to the
weak and gives protection to all with
out regard to nationality. If a man is
cheated or defrauded the one who per
petrates the fraud is brought before
Major Steele to answer for the wrong
doing. For example, a carrier may con
tract with a principal agent of a party
for carrying goods from the summit to
the lake. The carrier goes to the place
appointed according to the contract, but
does not find the principal. When the
two meet some days later the carrier
says: 'I was there at the appointed time
to receive your goods, but you were not
there as per agreement- The principal
replies: 'I found a man who tooK in the
goods for a lower rate.' The carrier then
submits the facts to Major Steele. A de
tail of police waits on the principal and
says to him: "Major Steele would like to
see you.' The principal responds, 'I have
no business with Major Steele and do not
know why I should call on him.' Later
on the principal is told firmly but cour
teously that he must see Major Steele,
and the interview soon follows. Major
Steele asks questions about the carrier's
version of the contract, and if it is
shown by all the facts elicited from both
parties that the carrier was wronged in
the transaction. Major Steele renders a
decision in this style, saying to the prin
cipal: 'Pay this man for his time and
trouble or we will confiscate your outfit,
giving one-half to the Government and
one-half to the carrier. You cannot make
a contract in this country and not live
up to it.' "
Mr. Berry, in commenting on the ad
ministration 01 justice said: "The high
est and lowest a'lkc respect the system."
According to a rough estimate made by
Mr. Berry the number of people on the
ground from the head of Linderman to
Tagish is somewhere between 27,000 and
, 30,000. The forward movement to Daw
son began May 27. Some of the parties
rushing in too soon came to grief in the
Ice half way down Lake Bennett. Not.
one man in a hundred of the whole num
ber knowF what he is going to do when
he gets to Dawson. The main purpose is
to reach the Yukon as early as possible.
Some casualties have occurred, but many
of the stories concerning the loss of life
are without foundation in fact. The re
cent report of the loss of twenty-two
lives on the Dy.ea trail is pronounced
false. The stories about a large percent
age of death from spinal meningitis are
pronounced untrue by Mr. Berry. Some
deaths have occurred from spotted fever,
but the proportion 1b not alarming. It is
estimated by parties from Dawson that
the early steamers this summer will
bring out gold to the value of $7,000,000 or
$8,000,000.
HE IS NOT A SOLDIER.
The Boy Burtan in the County Hos
pital Does Not Belong to
the Nebrabkas.
The statement that the Nebraska regi
ment left one of itÂ§ members behind In
the City and County Hospital is not quite
correct. The young man alluded to is
known as Roy Harry Burtan of Omaha,
a druggist by profession, and who came
out to this city with the Nebraska regi
ment as a prospective recruit, but he did
not belong to the military in any way.
Shortly after his arrival here he joined
Company C of the California Rangers,
an embryo military organization, which
has not yet been accepted by either the
Federal or State authorities as an at
tachment to the army. The headquar
ters of this organization are located at
328 O'Farrell street, where Burtan lodged
last Friday in a deserted hayloft, where
he had been for three days without any
thing to eat or drink. His companions
on finding him notified the police, who
had him taken to the City and County
Hospital, where Dr. Sussdorff, the su
perintendent, finding him almost at the
brink of death, suffering from pneumo
nia, placed two nurses to wait on him and
besides telegraphed to his parents in
Omaba, who are said to be very respect
able and well to do.
The chances of his recovery yesterday
were favorable and he may yet have a
fighting chance with the Spanish in Ma
nila.
ROUNDING UP BUNKO MEN.
Six Have Promised the Police to
Leave the City Saturday.
Complaints having reached police head
quarters that bunko men were operating
on the water front and other places Cap
tain Bohen detailed Detective Graham to
hunt them up and warn them that unless
they left the city they would be arrested
and sent to jail.
Graham reported to the captain yes
terday that the following had promised
to leave the city on Saturday by the
steamer Dirigo, which sails that day for
Alaska: John O'Brien, "Kid" Roy, alias
Collins; "Swede" Nelson, alias "Big
Swede;" John King, alias "Dummy"
Kingf John "Worley and John Daley.
"SVorley and Daley are strangers here to
the police, but the others are old hands.
If they do not leave Saturday as prom
ised they will be promptly arrested.
Still Counting Cars.
Upon resuming the taking of testimony
in the injunction suit of the Southern Pa
cific Company vs. the Railroad Commis
sioners yesterday, Attorney General Fitz
gerald objected to the tedious methods of
plaintiff's attorneys in the matter of put
ting in evidence. He thought there must
be some way for the witness to call the
totals of serial numbers without naming
each car and stated that if the examina- j
tion proceeded on the present lines, he
would oppose any future application 6f
the plaintiff for extension of time when
the case goes to trial. The State's work
was then turned over to Deputy Carter.
The counting of box-cars owned by the
Central Pacific Railroad Company was
quickly concluded by the adoption of the ;
suggestion, the total announced being 3193
cars. The "gondolas," or coal cars, num
bered 290 and at the time of adjournment
978 flat-cars had been counted out of 1500.
The case will go on at 10 o'clock this
morning.
Counting Uncle's Money.
Julius Jacobs, the new assistant treas
urer of the sub-treasury on Commercial
street, was installed in his position yes
terday. The oath of office was adminis
tered by United States Treasurer Ellis H.
Roberts. C. P. Berry, who has held this
office for several years, ha-nded over the
keys and books to his successor, and re
tired to private life. Mr. Roberts and his
assistants from the Treasury Department
at Washington have commenced to count
the money in the vaults. According to the
figures of Mr. Berry there should be $40,
000,000 on hand. Since the war has been
on considerable money has been taken out
to pay the army and navy debts of Uncle
Sam. 'requisitions for the same being sent
on from Washington. It will take three
or four weeks to count all the money in
the vaults.
Hospital Expenses.
The estimates of expanses of the City
and County Hospital for the coming fiscal
year is $122.1fi0. The biggrest items are as
follows: Subsistence, $46,000; coal, $500u:
dispensary, $11,600; salaries. $33,000; new
buildings and repairs, $10, l. r >o.

tit this stage of the year would I<>- apt to be
conducive to realizing and some reaction in
pries". But present conditions are -not en
tirely ordinary. The 'bull' feeling still runs
high, the market is fundamentally strong and
it is sustained by an 'expectation of a series
of successes by our army and navy that will
brini; the nrr-ut boon of peace at a compara
tively early day. There Is no disguising the
fact that many of the large operators through
whose efforts prices have recently been a.l
vanced have stMd out. and are now more ln
terested in making lower prices than higher
ones, to â  ible them to load up 'again. The
Incentive for selling was mainly the revival of
the silver lestlon. It Is regarded as a menace
to the business situation, and is being used
as a pretext to mark down the prices of stocks.

The Increase of silver money or its equivalent
to the extent of $42,000,000 at a time when
money is being required to so great an extent
for war purposes is a matter in Itself of no
very serious moment, excepting for the ridlcu
lous feature In connection therewith â the idea
of calling it so much profit for the Treasury,
when â as a tter of fact the Government
Etands as having made a loes of over J50.000.000

which the silver was bought and the present

EXPLANATION.
Th arrow nies with the wind. The top fig
ures ai station indicate minimum temperature
for the days; those underneath It, if any. the
amount of rainfall or of melted snow In inches
and hundredths during the last twelve hours.
Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; Isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and is usually accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres
pure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
llrs.t appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure Is high in the Interior and low
al'inK the coast, and the isobars extend north
and 'south along the coast, rain Is- probable;
but when the "low" is lnclnsed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is lm
probable. With a "high" in the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather mey be expected
In summer and colder weather In winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produco an
opposite result. .-v

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
KKW YORK. June 15.â Speculative observers
vlio argued that the two days' reaction on the
stock market has been due to the appre.ien
slon of the effects of liquidation consequent
upon the collapse of the wheat deal were dis
appointed to-day. The pressure upon the mar
ket from that source was practically removed
by the announcement that the enormous hold
lng< of cash wheat owned by the defeated
wheat speculators had been taken over by pow
erful financial interests, who had been able to
save It from being sacrificed at forced sale.
The course of the wheat market very plainly
Indicated the termination of the crisis, but
there was no movement to advance prices of
stocks. Apparently the . leaders . o f . /poculaton
have arrived at mutual consent f> let- th.3 irar
ket take ndvaiitage of the further manipula
tion for a rise. The course of prices was con
sequently downward In a rather i\Â«ll maiket.
K\trc-rr.f- gains of a point or over were reÂ«iÂ«
tered in most of the active mocks during :he
day. fuji:.T.r was the center of interest and
dropped persistently to the last, closing only
% point above the lowest at a net decline of
over four points. The (expectation of a favor
able vote on the Hawaiian annexation bill was
the motive assigned for the selling. The stock
was traded in ex-dlv!dend. The embarkation
of the army for Cuba added to the possibili
! ties of s setback In the campaign which would
; nlso hurt the <t.-> -k market if it were to oocur.
This and the approach of the critical period for
! the crops served to emphasise the wnltlng" dis
[tositlon of â peculation. Pears of tighter money
as I result of the bond issue were also ad-
I voncr<i by the bears. But it Is probable that
the banks and lur;;*< financiers would have in
hand th- funds which they expect to put into
the new bon'ls. It is evident that the banks
and cnpltnllats are preparing to take all of
those bonds rney can get; that is. all that are
left Â»er the small subscriptions are allotted.
If they net what they expect the bonds they
secure will tie used for circulation and thus
supply the money market. If the popular sub
scrlptionÃ are larger than expected the funds
accumulated by bankers and capitalists to buy
the bonds will be released to the money mar
ket.
Kailrond bonds were heavy In sympathy with
BtOCka Total sales, $1,900,000.

and do re-istered *i. In the bid price. There
were sules of the new fours coupon at an ad

POPULISTS IN A TANGLE
MIDDLE-OF-THE-ROAD FORCES
RALLY FOR THE FRAY.
In Kansas There Are Indications <X
Compact Fusion of the
Free Silver
Forces.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OMAHA, June 15.â The regular Na
tional Committee of the People's party
met here to-day, and has a fight on
its hands to keep out the middle-of-the
roaders who last year organized the
separate Milton Park National Com
mittee. Many of the Park Anti-Fusion
Committee are members of Senator Ma
rion Butler's regular committee, and all
summer, through Martin Burkes of
Philadelphia, they have been working
hard to secure promises. The regular
committee, to offset the schemes of the
"middle-of-the-roaders," have secured
a large number of proxies also.
When the committee's roll was called
Jt was discovered that between 75 and
100 proxies were held. George P. Wash
turn of Boston has twenty-seven. Con
tests in Illinois, lowa, Ohio, Pennsyl
vania and several other States are to ,
be settled, and Chairman Butler ap- i
pointed a credential committee favnra- {
ble to his side of the question, consist
ing of Senator Allen of Nebraska, ex- ,
Governor Buchanan of Tennessee, Eit- |
weet Pomeroy of New Jersey, A. H. j
Carden of Kentucky and Congressman
C. A. Barlow of California, every one j
a fusionist. This committee is now I
considering the contests. The Park
Committee has not yet obtained any
material concessions from the Butler
Committee.
At midnight the conference had done
no business, the members waiting for
the report of the committee on cre
vrhlch has been in cession
â¢ noon. There is a tight on over
the representations of Ohio and Illi
nois, which has consumed all the time.
At the hall where the n.nference is
to be held the middle of the road forces
are gathered and have voted down
many motions to take a recess until
rrow. They say the delay is to
tire them out and they do not propose
to be tired.
TOPEKA; Kan., June 15.â There is
. indication to-night that the plans
for the compact fusion-of th" free sil
ver forces of Kansas in the coming
State election will go through with a
hurrah. Three State conventions are
sitting, the Populists and Free Silver
Republicans in this city and the Demo
crats at Atchison. After adopting
platforms and appointing conference
committees to meet with committees
from the other conventions the Demo
crats and the Free Silver Republican
conventions adjourned until to-morrow
morning.
, The Populists fell Into a bitter
wraJigJe over State issues and were un
to agree on their platform. The
n lasted until very late at night,
adjournment was taken until 9
k to-morrow morning. It is hoped ,
â¢tie the differences by that time.
There is very little doubt of the ulti- j
result of the three conventions, j
: r it is as good as settled that all of
the present Populist State officers, with
cue exception, will be re-nominated by
Of the three conventions. The ex
ception is in the case of Laeutenant
rnor Harvey, who has gone to war ;
and it is probable that his place on the
ticket will be given to a Democrat.
The Free Silver Republicans ask for
nothing but fusion. Their convention
is attended by but forty-three delegates
and the sentiment among them simply
favors indorsing the action of the other ,
conventions. The platform which was
adopted to-day reaffirms the free silver j
declarations made by the Republican !
State Convention on September 4, 1890. j
The Populist Convention was in ses- j
Eion until a very late hour owing to j
radical differences on State issues.
MINNEAPOLIS, June 15.â The State
ontion of the Democratic-Populist
.party and Silver Republicans was held
here to-day arid fusion was accom
plished by a compromise. The middle
of-the-road element of the Populist
party to-day, led by Ignatius Donnelly,
nearly accomplished the bolt they had
planned. The middle-of-the-roaders
showed unexpected strength and at
tempted to control the Populist Con
vention, though they were finally out
voted. A committee of seven from each
convention to act in joint conference
â¢was appointed without trouble by both
the Democrats and Silver Republicans,
but with the Populists the friction was
bo gTeat that the entire day was con
sumed in discussion of fusion, the anti
fusionists threatening to leave the hall.
During this discussion Sidney M.
Owen administered to Ignatius Don
nelly one of the most scathing arraign
ments that was ever given to man in
public life. He accused him of being
a traitor to the People's Party for a
money consideration and called him a
villain, a monster and. a vile thing. Th^
wildest excitement prevailed.
Both the Democrats and the Silver
Republicans endorsed the Chicago plat
form and the candidacy of TV. J. Bryan
for the Presidency. The Silver Repub
licans also endorsed the initiative and
referendum. The Joint conference com
mittee had a lively session and it was
agreed to divide the offices to the three
p.-irtie?, allowing the convention to
make the nominations. John Lynn, the
Filver Republican, who has been a
candidate for Governor twice, was in
dorsed for Governor. The Populists
were allowed, the offices of lleutenant
governor, auditor, attorney general,
clerk of the Supreme Court.
The Democrats were given the nomi
nations of the secretary of state, state
treasurer and one of the judges of the
Supreme Court. The joint conference
< >mrnittee recommended that Judges
BuÂ«k and Canty, at present pitting, he
named by the three parties. John Lynn
was nominated by the three conven
tions for governor. J. M. Bowlps was
nominated for lieutenant-governor~tiy
the. Populists and endorsed by the
others; J. J. Heinrich for secretary of
*tate; Alex McKlnnon, state treasurer;
Justices Mitchell, Canty and Buck for
the Supreme Court bench.
At a late hour the Populists hadÂ«Biot
filled the remaining offices allotted to
them.
FRESNO, Juno In.â Tho Populist and
Democratic conventions held in this
cftjr yesterday and to-day have prac
tically completed their labors. Fusion
has been indorsed unqualifiedly, and
the best of understanding exists be
tween the two parties. Resolutions
have been adopted by both conven
tions, condemning the extravagance in
officers of the present Board of Super
visors, Democratic, Populist and Re
publican alike. Supervisor Ward (D.)
Is made an honorable exception to the
other members of the board. The
nominations made are as follov.-s:

STRANGE INSECT THAT
FEEDS ON SUGA* BEETS
Professor Duncan Stirling Makes an
Unwelcome Discovery at
Salinas.
â¢ MONTEREY, June 15.â News cornea
from Salinas of thediscovery of a hitherto
entirely unknown beet pest, and beet
growers in that section are considerably
disturbed over its appearance. Professor
Duncan Stirling, an enthusiastic student
of entomology, is the discoverer of the
insi ct. He was examining' the vegetables
in his garden about a week ago, when he
Bait upon one of his beet plants a pe
culiar Insect. The stranger seemed vigor
ous and was enjoying himself. Professor
Stirling found upon investigation several
more like him.
Obtaining a specimen, he at once for
warded it to the agricultural department
of the University of California. Professor
Hilgard was unable to identify the insect,
so he passed it over to the entomological
department. Professor C. W. Wood worth,
head of that department, arrived in Sa
linas yesterday to make a thorough ex
amination and careful study of the pest.
So far. Professor Woodworth is undecid
ed as to whether it is native in California
Âr has been brought from Europe, where
i; [a common, and does great damage to
sugar-beets.
A Hy, much like an ordinary house fly,
lays a minute white egg upon a leaf of a
beet plant. From this a small *orm is
hatched, which burrows between the lay
ers of the leaf. After eating all the sub
stance out of the leaf, the worm forms a
chrysalis and falls to the ground, where
it remains until ..he fly emerges from it.
The various stages of evolution are passed
in a short space of time.
If the insect is not native. Professor
Woodworth thinks it must have been
brought to California in the beet seed im
ported yearly in large quantities from
ny.
The beet fields in both the Salinas and
Watsonvllle sections are to undergo a
thorough investigation before Professor
WiM-xlworth comes to a positive decision
regarding the nature of the pest and the
means to exterminate it.
DYING WOMAN
TAKES REVENGE
Triple Tragedy in a Ta-
coma Cafe.
JEALOUSY INCITES MURDER
TWO LIVES TAKEN BY A MAN
FROM DYEA.
He Is in Turn Shot and Killed With
His Own Revolver by One
of His Expiring
Victims.
TACOMA,, June 15.â James D. Bart
lett of Dyea entered a stall of Chil
berg's restaurant in this city this
morning, drew a revolver, and
shot Clarence D. Emery and Mrs.
Lilly Chandler. He was in turn shot
twice and killed by the- woman with
his own revolver. All three parties to
the tragedy are dead.
The woman formerly lived with Bart
lett in Dyea. Two weeks ago she came
to Seattle. Yesterday she met Clar
ence Emery, who was a bartender on
the steamer City of Seattle, and who
brought her down from Dyea. Bartlett
came here to-day and traced the wo
man and his rival to the restaurant.
Emery and the woman were seated at
the table eating when Bartlett entered
with the waiter.
As soon as the latter made his exit
from the stall Bartlett drew a revol
ver and shot Emery through the right
breast, the latter staggering to his feet
and going out into the adjoining stall,
where he fell dead. Another shot struck
the woman in the left shoulder. The
murderer dropped the revolver and,
picking up a case knife, stabbed her in
the cheek. Mrs. Chandler obtained the
revolver and fired two shots, killing
Bartlett almost instantly. The woman
was removed to a room, where she died
in a half hour.
WASHINGTON MASONS
RECOGNIZE NEGRO LODGES
Colored Men Permitted to Fraternize
With White Members of
the Order.
SEATTLE, June 15.â The Grand Lodge
of Free and Accepted Masons of the State
of Washington, how in session in this city,
took action to-day that will be of uni
versal interest. For the first time in the
history of Masonry in America negro
lodges are recognized as legitimate and
their members privileged to fraternise
with white nvmhers of the order.
It was in 1755 that the Grand I>odge of
England substituted the word "freemen"
for "freeborn" In their rltunl. and that
year issued a charter to Prince Hall
Lodge of Massachusetts, which was com
posed of colored men. Subsequently
Prince. Hall Lodge issued charters to
negro lodges throughout the United
States, but no regular subordinate or
Grand Lodge has affiliated with these
colored brethren. The question of recag
nition has been the subject of much bitter
controversy in various States. Washing
ton takes precedence in extending greet
ing, anil her lodges may be visited by all
freemen who are members of any regular
Masonic lodge.
NEW COMET OBSERVED
BY PROFESSOR PERRINE
The Lick Astronomer Adds Another

UNKNOWN WHEELMAN
FATALLY INJURED
Strange Bicyclist Found Unconscious
at a Roadside Not Far From
Monterey.
MONTEREY, June 15.â An unknown
wheelman was picked up In an uncon
scious condition near the foot of the long
Carmel HUI yesterday r by a teamster,
who was driving Into Monterey and who
had found a bicycle with several blood
stains on it before coming upon the man.
The teamster brought the' man to Mon
terey, where medical attendance was pro
cured and an effort made to identify him.
All that could be learned was that he
was from San Jose and was staying at
Pacific Grove. The attending physician
believes his chances fpr recovery are
very slight, as his head .Is very badly in
jured, and up to this time he had not re
gained consciousness.
It is supposed the wheelman attempted
to coast down the hill, and, losing control
of his machine, was thrown. Carmel Hill
is not steep, but being very long and the
road being serpentine, it is an exceedingly
dangerous one for wheelmen, and many
accidents have occurred upon It.

Los Angeles City Council Urged to
Establish One in the
City Hall.
LOS ANGELES, June 15.â A petition
was filed with the City Clerk to-day ad

; tablishment of a municipal printing plant.
= The petition sets forth that for the sum
; of $1500 a printing plant could be placed
! In the basement of the City Hall and that
| It could be operated by the city, and that
| all job printing required by the city, for
I which thousands of dollars is annually

NO LIGHT ON THE MYSTERY
UNEXPECTED DANGER IN THE
HEART OF OAKLAND.
Railroad Detectives and Police Are
Not Able to Find a Clew
to the Inci
dent.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 15.
i ive shots that were fired into the nar
row-gauge train at Eleventh and Webster
streets this morning have given the police
and a couple of railroad detectives a
lively hunt to-day with no result.
The 10:46 narrow-gauge had only gone a
couple of blocks from the depot when a
charge of shot shattered one of the win
dows and sent the fragments of glass all
over the opposite seat, where a lady was
sitting. The shots had such great im
petus that they went clean through the
window, and each made a little hole about
the size of a pea. There was some excite
ment, but no one was seriously hurt, al
though one lady was cut on the forehead.
In the car were Dr. Ernest B. Boyes,
Mrs. J. B. Melvin, sister-in-law of Deputy
District Attorney Melvin, J. Byers, a
photographer, and others. Dr. Boyes was
occupying two seats, with his feet di
rectly under the window through which
the shot crashed. Mrs. Melvin was sit
ting opposite to him on the other side of
the tar, and the flying splinters struck
her forehead and made a few slight cuts,
but fortunauly did not touch her eyes.
Mr. Byers was seated in front of Dr.
Boyes, and was looking out of the win
dow. The shots passed close to his face,
and he . was considerably agitated, not
knowing what might follow. The con
ductor took the names of the passengers
in the var. and later the detectives and
Officer Amert were working on the case.
"The shots seemed to come from a
large cypress tree, at the corner of
E.eventh and "Webster streets," said Dr.
Boyes to-night, "They were probably
fired by some- lad, but it was very dan
gerous sport. They passed right over my
feet, and the glass splinters etruck a
lady sitting across the aisle. r ihe shots
had considerable force, as they went clean
through the window. There are two
email houses near the corner, and the
shots seemed to come from between them.
The -iain was making too much noise for
one to hear the report of a gun. Such
work should not be permitted in the cen
ter of a city."
Inquiry in the houses in the neighbor
hood failed to produce any information,
as there is no boy known to have a gun.
No light was thrown on the affair by the
investigations of the detectives or police,
and it has caused much interest, as it oc
curred in the heart of the city.
A Chinese laundry is near the scene of
the shooting on Eleventh street, but those
employed there claim to know nothing of
the affair.

LIVELY BOXING BOUTS.
Dahl and Carroll Fought Six Hot
Bounds in the Alpine Club.
The Alpine Athletic Club gave a very
successful Rnd interesting boxing enter
tainment on Tuesday in its gymnasium,
28 Golden Gate avenue.
The first event was a Blx-round contest
between Ed Wiley and Young McDonald,
which was won by McDonald, although
Wiley stood out well against solid shot.
Pat Lynch won a decision over Joe
Kane The boxers smashed each other in
the customary give-and-take style for
eight rounds; the soft smashes of the
gloves on the body could have been heard
a block away, but where hard and sting
ing blows are administered very little
sound follows..
What, really should have been the ev<>nt
of the evening was a six-round bout be
tween the light-weights Emll Dahl of the
California Athletic and Swimming Uu'.>
and Dick Carroll of the Han Francisco
Athletic Club. Jim Ryan was selected ro
referee the match. Carroll, who is a
rangy fellow with extraordinary reach of
arms, looked very determined when he
faced his stocky but well-built opponent.
During the first round Dahl brought tne
claret from Carroll's left ear by a well
directed right swing, but shortly after
ward Carroll, with a savage upper-cut,
rattled Dahl's teeth. Dahl at close rnnge
landed several times and finished the
round with points in his favor.
In the second round Dahl sent Carroll
to the floor with a right swing in the neck.
but came very near committing a foul by
striking Carroll while the last-named
boxer was on his knees watching a chance
to regain his pins. Dahl had the better
of this round.
The third round was hotly contested. It
was give and take, but Carroll score! a
lead by well directed uppercuts.
The fourth was tolerably even. 0ut"I1
suited out well but in the last half of the
round Dahl went in for short-range fight
ins? und had the best of the finish. This
round was an even thing.
In the fifth round Dahl held his fire back
too lone and allowed Carroll to score too
many points, which gave Carroll the lead
in points at the finish.
Both men went at the game hammer
and tongs in the last round, but Carroll
was growing weak and Dahl had won a
decided advantage when the gong sounded
th-Â» finish of the contest. The referee
awarded the fight to Dahl, much to The
surprise of Carroll's friends.
â¢'With Dewey at Manila," and pic
tures taken from photographs of the
great naval battle, by Joseph L.
Stickney, the special war correspond
ent of The Call, who stood on the
bridge of the flagship Olympia dur
ing the fight.â ln next Sunday's Call.
R. P. SCHWERIN
CALLED DOWN
Must Admit Reporters to
the Mail Dock.
A BITTER PILL FOR HIM
HE HAS TO SWALLOW IT AND
MAKE NO FACES.
The Call's Expose of the Peking's
Pig Pen Besulted in First-Class
Quarters for Soldiers in
the China and Colon.
The person whom Collis P. Huntington
saved from court-martial and dismissal
from the navy, one R. P. Schwerin, has
come dovin from his high horse.
His descent was sudden, and every bone
in his siuggy anatomy was jarred in con
sequence.
Reginald Picayune dreamed that he
owned the water front, just as Col
lis P. once dreamed that he owned tne
Oakland water front. Reginald awoke
only to find that the State Board of Har
bor Commissioners has considerable to
say in regard to matters pertaining to thÂ«
harbor and wharves, and the awakening
was a iude one. Like the indolent Turk,
he dreamed that all and sundry trembled '
at his power, and, like the Oriental, awoke ,
to find his dream was oniy a dream.
When the first fleet of transports was I
being fitted out to go to Manila with i
troop 3 The Call pointed out that the
bertha and accommodations being put in
the City of Peking were not as good as â¢
weri furnished the Chinese coolies who ;
travel year in and year out on the boat.
At this Mr. Schwerin got very angry, and
issued orders that no Call reporter should
be allowed on the Mail Company's wharf.
On different occasions various members |
o f The Call's staff tried to get down to
thf; transports, but were invariably re
fused admittance.
Things came to a head, however, when
the steamer Belgic of the Occidental and \
Oriental Company's line arrived from I
Hongkong with news from Dewey's
fleet. Representatives from every paper
in town flocked down to the wharf and
every one of them gained admittance save
three representatives of The Call. One
of the latter tried to force his way down,
and was forcibly ejected "by Mr. j
Schwerin's orders." The matter was laid
before the Harbor Commissioners, and
that body at once informed the autocrat
of the Mail dock that he must admit The
Call representatives to the wharf or else
exclude every newspaper man in the city.
Mr. Schwerin swallowed the bitter pill
and now The Call men come and go at
pleasure.
The publication of the manner in which j
the Peking was fitted out has done a |
great deal of good, and the boys in blue
who sailed on the China and Colon yes
terday have The Call to thank for having
first-class quarters. When the work of
fitting out these two vessels was first ;
begun, Schwerin out of pure cussedness i
was going to put in the same, kind of i
bunks that had been put in the Peking, j
The Call heard of this and informed the i
public and the army officers of the fact, i
The result was that such fixtures as had
been put in the China and Colon were
torn down and quarters equal to any
thing put in any of the troopships were
fitted up. The fight is now over and i
Reginald Picayune can go back to his '
dreams, but in future he will confine his
efforts after absolute power to his own !
quarterdeck. Even there he has to be j
careful, because when a lieutenant on the
quarterdeck of a sloop-of-warâ but then
that story has already been told. '

SAND CRABS'
WEAKNESSES
Base-Running and Bat
ting Prime Causes.
CHANCES IN BASEBALL
PLAYEES MUST TAKE THEM ON
BASES.
A Team Fielding Perfectly, Yet TJn
able to Run Bases or Bat, in
Reality Is Not a
Team.
BY JOE CORBETT.
I have watched very closely the play-
Ing of the Beachcombers since thÂ© con
solidation and I must say that out6lde
of the Gilt Edges there Is not a team
that I have seen play as good a game of '
ball In the field as this team. That they
should meet with so many, reverses Is
bothering a great many of the fans,' the I
majority of whom have pinned their
hopes on ttieir being near the top when i
the season la finished. To do this, how- !
ever, the Sand' Crabs must change theii j
Btyle of play, especially at critical stages, \
and they must also devote a great amount i
df their spare time to batting. This lat- j
ter weak: ra to lie their groat
fault, yet they are by no means whirl
winds on the bases, and it would not be j
a bad idea for them to study up on this ;
very necessary qualification. In fielding
could hardly do better work. In
they have given the best exhibition:
ady playing I have seen this s.-ason, ;
bo in That respect I will say that there is
hardly any room for improvement. Hut
how Is it that these Beachcombers, hav
ing as good a fielding team us apy In the
league, barring Sacramento, should lose ,
.any games?
The question is a trifle puzzling, and
while I have not had an opportunity to
witness their defeats away from San
Francisco, still, from what I have seen
i lr work, it is very evident to me :
that, inability to hit, combined with poor .
running and an occasional stupid
as Balsz's sacrifice last tracur
day with a man on third, art the prime
as why they are so often defeated.
igh playing a superb tame in the
field.
It is possible that they have not had an
â¢ luck (and luck, by the
way la a factor in baseball not to be des
.. but this scarcity i | entlal
good will would not, 1 am afraid, Oil up ,
lumn. The boys will haye 1
â¢ the ball and bit it when hits are
absolutely necessary, If they expect to be
race at a.l. Then, again, it is most
essential to the team's success that base
running be encouraged among the play
era. outside of one or two who do not ;
get on the bases enough to display their i
ability In tins particular line there is a:
icking of this art. True, baae-Bteal
â¢ these 'lays of advanced baseball is
a very difficult matter, yet the player
er that in plays where two
distinct throws must be made the chance
for one of them being wild is always in
his favor and he -should figure on this
chance when attempting to steal.
In one game the Sand Crabs lost by the
almost usual margin of one run. Three
rtunities to Bcore were offered them,
but they failed to take the chance. In
Instance the play was identical:
A man on :irst base and one on third.
The one on first attempted to steal, and
r threw clear to second in the
itching him. Here was a chance
at man on third to score. It w.is
v.i baseball is largely a
.if chance, and players must try if
they expect to accomplish things. That
er vii tliii': have been pre
pared for just such a play. He could have
bis bj securing a fair lead, and on
g the l>a!! go to second, dasheu for
the home plate. His chances of Bcoring
were very good. To catch him the back
- throw to second had to be perfect
and likewise the return throw to the plate.
The play being so close and rapid and the
ball handled so quickly., there is no time
for aim, and the chances of the throw
from second to the plate being wild are
never better.
This is just an instance of where
chances for runs have been thrown away
because a player Is either afraid to take
a chance or does not know how to run !
I nice again I say players to be ;
Bsful must take chances, especially
when on the bases.
The Beachcombers are not the only
players deficient in this line. There are
any number of them visible at Recreation
Park on Saturdays and Sundays, and I
would suggest that they, too, learn to
appreciate what it is to take a chance In
baseball.
Another point the Sand Crabs are ap
parently very weak in is the proper thing
to do when the situation is critical. In
last Saturday's game Mr. Balsz made a
play in the last inning with a man on
third and one out, which should have lost.
Instead of winning the contest. He sac- ;
riflced with the Infield playing close, and >
Ite the fact that he disclosed his in
tention quite a time before the ball was
pitched, the play proved successful, sim
ply through the inability of a player to I
move or throw rapidly. Because this play
turned out according to calculations, it
does not necessarily follow that it was
the correct one to make under the cir
cumstances. It was not. and very far
from it. If Schultz. who received the ball,
had not lost so much time pulling himself
together the runner would never have
â  '.. and the chances are that the game
would have been lost, or at any rate
should have been lost, when a chance to
win was not properly taken care of. Bear
in mind, ye unfortunate Saul ("raits, when
the infield is playing in, the chances for
a hit are never better. Do not sacrifice
under such circumstances, as the proper
and only play is to hit the ball.
Outside of base-running and batting
they, as far as I can see, axe a great
team. Their fielding has been much ad
mired by all lovers of the game in this
city, but fielding alone cannot win games.
Runs are the little points that count and
it takes batting and base-running to
score them. Really a team that does not
bat and run bases in one sense of the
word Is not a team. The Sand Crabs.
however, must not be looked upon in such
a light, for they have the material and
the making o-f a championship dub, pro
viding they improve in the two depart
ments I refer to. I understand that last
year nothing In the Bhape of a baseball
team could touch these* Sand Crabs.
One might infer from this that their slide,
down the toboggan this season is due to
hard .luck. They certainly are having
their share of it yet they are not play
ing the game at bat h:i<l on the base's.
Until they improve their batting optics,
run bases daringly and do the proper
thing when the game depends on that
particular play, I cannot see how they
can hope to be near the top unless some
of the hard-hitting dubs drop dead.
I have overlooked Mr. Balsz. How such
. a mistake could have been made I am at
a loss to know, for Mr. Bate* is thr>
greatest throwing pitcher I ever saw. and
I have se<n some good ones. I do not
wish to speak disparagingly of this gen
tleman's ability np a pitcher, for I believe
him to be second to none on the coast
that is, when he refrains from going up
in the air. It is very bad form, this as
cension business, especially so when '.here
is really no occasion for it, and Lou
ehould endeavor to work up some fooling
for mother earth. A good way to <io this
would be to throw all balls to ba?es un
derhand. In this manner wll-1 throws
over the bleachers may be don<: away
with and the ascension postpone*. l Indef
initely. Thly wild-throw arc of Lous is
beautiful â â¢vren the score is tie. a m-.in on
third ar.d me run needol to wii> the
' game. It Is then that Lou breaks all
long-distance records and scapes Manager
Tuttle out of a year's growth. Cut out
those wild, unnecessary throws, Lou, Is
the prayer that majestically wends its
way "Friscoward," emanating, no doubt,
from the baseball headquarters of the
Sand Crabs.

LUMBER
DEALERS IN
A QUANDARY
Many Would Like to
Sell, but Hold Back.
THE MARKET IS DEMORALIZED
EFFORTS BEING MADE TO UP
HOLD THE TARIFF.
Jobbers Trying to Prevent Firms
From Following the E. K.
Wood Company's
Example.
Strenuous efforts are being put forth
by the men who compose the Retail
Lumber Dealers' Association to induce
the E. K. Wood Company and two or
three other firms to return to the fold
and uphold the price of lumber. As was
stated exclusively In The Call a week ago
the E. K. Wood Company broke away
from a prearranged agreement of the
combine by placing a bid before the
Board of State Harbor Commissioners
agreeing to furnish lumber at $11.50 per
thousand feet instead of the agreed rate
of $14.50, virtually demoralizing the lum
ber market.
Since the firm's action was made pub
lic meetings have been frequently held
: by the association with a view to bring
ing the deserting firm in line again. Com
mittees have been appointed to visit the
members of the E. K. Wood Company
for the purpose of pointing out to them
the error of their ways, but have al
â  ways reported back a lack of success.
Other members have gone to other firms
to induce them to join the association
\ and thus add greater strength by their
: co-operation.
While there are signs of harmony
among the lumber men who compose the
i association, yet it is thought that others
will follow the example of the Wood
company and bid for the plum held out
for them by the Harbor Commissioners.
Fur this reason the jobbers are working
hard to hold such dealers that appear
shaky within bounds. Their task may
prove a hard one, owing to the present
condition of the market, mainly caused
.by the dry season experienced in the
State. Throughout the San Joaquin Val
: ley yards have been closed, for the time
being, as farmers have not . realized
money enough to make extensive im
provements. This has caused such firms
as Simpson & Co. and the Pacific Pine
Lumber Company to curtail their output
i by running their mills either on half time
, ur stopping 1 them entirely.
As was stated by a prominent lumber
man yesterday, "the market has become
glutted and such firms that have large
quantities of the commodity on hand are
w'ilini; to dispose at a less figure. This
Is bound to happen once in a great while
and hts a demoralizing effect on the mar
ket. About a year ago lumber was sold
at J7 GO. which is a little below cost, but
it gradually raised until $14 50 was
reached." The association held to this
price for quite & while, until the Hum
boldt Lumber and Milling Company cre
ated a stampede by offering to supply the
School Department at a price much lower
than the understood tariff and which was
followed by the E. K. Wood Company re
ducing their price to the Harbor Commis
sioners to a low figure.
Although trade has been falling off dur
ing the last three months nearly 25 per
cent, yet every effort will be made by the
big dealers to prevent others in following
the example of the above mentioned firms.
It is believed, however, that the tempta
tion to dispose of material to the Harbor
Commissioners during the next six months
at less than the E. K. Wood Company
bid is too great, as the profit to be gained
by doing so will be worth the trying. It
is therefore predicted thiu fifteen min
utes before the bids are opened on the
21st of this month other firms will break
away as did the E. K. Wood Company.
As to the latter company, they say:
"We furnished the Commissioners for a
long time at $8, and I guess we can stand
it at $11 50."
MIDWEEK THEATER NOTES.
Good Business the Rule at the Va-
rious Houses.
The double bill at the Columbia, "Po'
White Trash" and the farcical comedy
"Number Nine," will be continued by the
Frawley Company until next Sunday
evening, Inclusive. The company Im
proves with acquaintance, but next week
in the comedy drama "Aristocracy" they
have a better opportunity â to display
their abilities in high class work. "Num
ber Nine" Is drawing well and the sale of
seats for the remaLnder of the week has
been, large.
At the California beginning next Sun
day night a familiar acquaintance, the
"Prodigal Father," will be produced by
a company including Lynn Welcher, Rose
Melville, Bert Swan, Logan Williams and
others. Bright, clean specialties,, excel
lent music and clever comedy are prom
ised. The play is highly amusing and at
popular prices, 15, 25 and 50 cents, should
be well patronized. ' â  â¢
The "Passion Play" at the Baldwin,
with its vivid pictures of the famous pro
duction and - appropriate music, Is quite
entertaining and is enjoying an increas
ing attendance. It is given at 3 and 8:30
p. m. "and well repays a visit.
The Orpheum with its long list of ar
tistic specialties maintains its standard
of excellence and as a consequence
crowded houses are the invariable rule.
This is the last week in which Kendall
and several other of the clever special
ists may bo seen. ..â¢
Louis Morrison as Count de Mornay, In
"A Celebrated Case." at the Alcazar, is
playing to a very satisfactory business,
which promises to continue during the
week.
"I'nder the Polar Star" at Morosco's,
with its fine scenic effects and strong
dramatic situations, is having a deserv
edly successful run, notwithstanding it
is in its third week.
Theso are the last nights of thÂ» Tlvoli's
fine production of "An American Hero."
It is elegantly- presented and deserves the
patronage that is being accorded It. This
is a good place to buy a laugh and get
your moneys worth.
Cannon, "the fattest man on earth," is
proving a bonanza at the Chutes, and
with the many other attractions helps
to make a very enjoyable entertainment.
OVEREND DID NOT ANSWER,
Complaining Witness in a Criminal
Trial Adjudged Guilty of
Contempt.
Alfred Overend of 10 Franklin street
was adjudged guilty of contempt of court
by Judge Wallace yesterday afternoon,
fined $500 and sentenced to be imprisoned
In the County Jail until 10 o'clock this
morning. Overend is the man who a
short time ago manifested his confidence
in Minnie Campbell, a woman of the ten
derloin district, by loaning her $2200 to be
used as bail money for the release of her
father, who, she said, was charged with
murder in Ixis Angeles. Investigation
proved that her story was false, and in
consequence Overend caused the arrest of
tlie woman and her accomplice, William
Lewis.
Overend relented later and when the
case came up for trial before the Superior
Court he'refused to testify on the ground
that he might incriminate himself. Prose
cutor Black interrogated the prisoner at
length, but he refused to respond to any
question. The court was appealed to and
Overend was ordered to answer the ques
tions. He refused and Judge Wallace ad
judged him guilty of contempt. When
court convenes this morning he will be
again questioned, and in the event of a
refusal on his part to answer he will in
all probability be sent back to the cell be
ocpupied last night

UNFIT FOR USE
AS A HOG PEN
A Roast for the Rickety
Old Pesthouse.
PLAN TO REMOVE IT
A SITE ON ANGEL ISLAND MAY
BE SEC UK ED.
Estimates of the Expenses of the
Health Department for the
Coming Fiscal
Year.
The Pesthouse received another roast
at the meeting of the Board of Health
yesterday, but this time something la
likely to be done in consequence. Dr.
Hereford, the City Physician, denounced
the place as unfit for habitation, and
James Keating, the steward, added his
testimony as to the generally broken
down condition of the old institution.
In Dr. Hereford's report the place is
termed a disgrace to the city, but the
steward comes down to more specific
terms. In his report to Dr. Hereford he
says :
Dr. William S. Hereford. City Physician: I
wish to call attention to the condition of this
Institution (the Pesthouse). It has been allowed
to go to decay for so many years without any
attempt at repairs of any kind that it has be
come rotten everywhere. The buildings are rot
ten, the foundations rotten, the Bfwers, water
closets, plumbing, all rutten. The roof leaks
like a sieve, and in case of rain the patients
have to move their beds from one j>!aee to
another to get out of the wet, for if their bed
ding gets wet they have no chance to dry it, as
tlu-re is no way of having stoves and iires in
the wards. Consequently after a ra.in the place
is cold, wet and damp, and nut a lit place to
keep animals, much less human brings. It does
seem a shame to compel these poor unfortunate
people to suffer for the want oi a decent build
ing to end their days in. They do not complain
at being isolated from the rest of the world,
but feel that they are entitled to a comfortable
building. To attempt to rt-pair these rotten
buildings would be folly and money thrown
away. They wÂ»re built twenty or thirty yean
ago and were put up in the cheapest manner
possible, as they were only intended as tempor
ary, and they have been rotting away ever
since. I have been expecting them to blow
down every storm that we had. Reppe. tfully
submitted, JAMES P. KEATING.
â¢ Sfward.
The two communications were read to
the board, and it was decided to try to
secure a site for the hospital on Angel
Island. To that end, Mayor Phelan and
Dr. Fitzgibbcin were appointed a com
mittee to correspond with the United
States authorities for the purpose of se
curing such a concession. Should the
committee be successful In Its negotia
tions the Pesthouse problem may De
solved by the erection of a substantial
building on Angel Island.
Drs. Victor F. Luchetti, Oscar Tobrlner,
William Bell and Henry Abrahm were
recommended by the medical department
of the State University for appointment
as internes at the City and County Hos
pital. The appointments were confirmed
by the board.
"The monthly financial statement showed
an expenditure of $i 3.241 21 tor this month,
most of which is for salaries.
It was announced that the Mayor had
offered to donate a library and a building
for the same for the use of the inmates
of the Almshouse. The offer was accepted
and a vote of thanks to the Mayor was
passed.
The nomination of Dr. P. S. Bruguiere
as interne for the polyclinic ward at the
city and County Hospital was approved.
Dr. Gallwey reported that as a result
of a communication from the Health De
partment all deaths and infectious dis
eases at Camp Merritt will be reported
to the Health Office.
It was decided to request the Supervis
ors to make terms with the Olympic Salt
Water Company for salt water for flush-
Ing the sewers. â¢
The application of the California Un
dertaking Company to exhume the body
of a child who died of diphtheria and
remove it to Oakland for reinterment
brought up the subject of compulsory
cremation for all who die of infectious or
contagious diseases. The Health Officer
had refused a permit for the disinterment
on the ground of danger from the disease.

FOOTE GUILTY OF CONTEMPT.
Fined for Calling Opposing Counsel a
Liar in Open Court.
Altogether the Examiner and counsel
representing its proprietor In the action
Instituted by Martin Kelly to recover
damages for libel is out $11. One dollar
of this vast sum must be paid to Kelly
to recompense him for the "great dam
age" his reputation suffered by reason
of the libelous article complained of, and
$10 represents the sum of a fine imposed
upon W. W. Foote for contempt of court.
Foote. who represented the Examiner,
was adjudged guilty of contempt, and
purged himself thereof during the morn
ing .session yesterday. The attorney was
objecting to certain statements being
made by a witness called In rebuttal by
Judge Hates, who presented the inter
ests of Martin Kelly, and Judge Bates
was insisting that testimony had been in
troduced by Foote which called for the
testimony of the witness on the stand in
rebuttal. Foote denied that testimony
had been Introduced on the part of the
defendant in the action calling for the
testimony opposing counsel wished to in
troduce In rebuttal and undertook to state
the testimony actually introduced In cvi-
dence.
He was interrupted by Bates, however,
who said: "Mr. Foote, you're misleading
the Jury* You are not stating the facts
correctly. You are purposely misstating
the facts in order to get what you want
before the jury."
Foote was angry in an instant, and in
a voice that echoed up and down the cor
ridors of the hall said, "That's false."
"What?" queried Bates.
"You lie!" answered Foote, who was
trembling with rage.
Here the court interposed and mildly
inquired, "DM I understand you, Mr.
Foote, to say that counsel lied?"
"Yes, your Honor," replied Foote, "and
I'll stand by my statement."
"Mr. Foote." said Judge Daingerfield,
"I adjudge you guilty of "contempt. I fine
you $10. Foote produced the required
amount without delay and the trial was
resumed.
The case was argued in the afternoon
and then submitted to the jury, which re
tired to deliberate on a verdict. In half
an hour it returned and entered judgment
in favor of the plaintiff. Martin Kelly, for
the sum of $1. He evidently considered
it a victory, as he r/omplimented his coun
sel with smiling face and then left the
courtroom.
Suing an Employment Agent.
"W. A. Shepard, the employment agent
â¢whose license was revoked by the Super
visors at their last meeting, Is being sued
by one of his clients, Benjamin Wein
zopflen, for $299 99 damages for fraud.
The plaintiff alleges that he was told
there was a job for himself and wife and
he could secure it by paying a fee of $3.
He paid the fee and was told that the
man who wanted him would be in the
next day to talk to him, but the next day
no one came around. Shepard said he
would be in the next day, but tho same
disappointment occurred and so it went
on for nearly a month.
Then, the complaint alleges, Shepard
told the plaintiff he would be wanted to
start for the country the next day to
where the place was awaiting him and
his wife, and in order to be ready Wein
zopflen says he sold his household goods
and sent his children up to Cloverdale,
where his wife's mother resides, but when
he reported himself ready to go he was
told the place was not open. He alleges
that he was defrauded of his $3 and that
the stories of places waiting were toli
only for the purpose of defrauding him.
He has therefore brought suit tor dam
ages.
KEELER ADDRESSES REGENTS.
The New Director of the Lick Ob
. servatory Makes a Few Timely
Suggestions.
Professor Keeler, the new head of the
Lick Observatory, addressed the Regents
of the University of California at their
monthly meeting on Tuesday and gave a
brief outline of the work he purposed
during the summer months. He began by
complimenting Professor Schaberle on
the splendid condition of the institution
v hen It was turned over to him on June
1 Alter paying hla respects to a local
editorial writer who accused the Observ
atory of obtaining barren results he dis
missed It by saying that that was the
general belief of the people, but
among the world-famed astronomers the
observatory enjoyed a high reputation
for efficiency. He . declared it his 'nten
tlon to devote this summer to a study of
the Crossly reflector, which, he said,
would, with, a few changes, prove a val
uable aid to research. Professor Keeler
closed by discussing the Btudents who are
engaged in astronomical work. His sug
gestions were listened to with interest by
the board and It is probable they will aid
him In his duties.
Previous to his remarks the board ap
pointed W. S. Morley analytical assistant
in the mining department and R. S. Mor
ris assistant in the chemistry depart
ment..
A letter sent by Regent Relnsteln was
then read tnanklng the Alaska Commer
i clal Company for its generous gift to the
college.
1 ue medical department of the univer
sity sent a communication petitioning
to be set on the same footing as the uni
versity. This brought up a warm dis
cussion, but as the matter was an impor
tant one action was deferred to the next
meeting, when a larger attendance might
I be present.
Regent Houghton reported tha^ the col
| lege buildings at Berkeley were fully pro
, tected against loss by fire by pipes lead
ing from the newly erected reservoir.
Regent Arthur Rodgers moved that a
committee of three be appointed to con
sider the advisability of establishing a
| professorship In national relationship.
; Regents P-.elan, Wallace and Rodgers
; were appointed.
The Regents will meet at .11 a. m. In
i future and hold a continuous session.
President Kellogg was directed to con
fer with the new dlrect6r of the Lick
University and report a plan for such
lectures to be given to the students of the
university by the staff at the Lick as
they may think best for the university.
Instruction in the Cantonese languages
is to be given to students at the opening
of the term. A well-known interpreter
in the Federal service may be asked to
accept the office.

A GRAND FAIR
IN AID OF THE
LOCAL RED CROSS
Many Citizens Indorse The Call's
Suggestion of a Practical Way
to Raise Funds.
A Permanent Place of Amusement Would Enter
tain the Public and Greatly Help the
Cause of Patriots.
There is a great deal of interest Just
now in the local work of the Red Cross.
The Call has suggested that a gxx>d
way to raise funds for those who have
volunteered to give their time to the
movement is to establish a fair where
there will be entertainments for the
public.
form of this entertainment might
be the display of special acts of Ameri
can heroism by :i system of pyrotech
nics. Such a fair, with many attractive
features, \\>>uld prove a popular way of
raising funds for the cause of soldiers
and for the welfare of their families.
Th- 1 following expressions of public
opinion will show the way some of San
Francisco's representative citizens
view the mntto.r:
EX-JUDGE JULIUS REIMERâ It is
a grand idea for the people to do all in
their power to aid the Red Cross move

READY TO AID THE FAIR I
Assessor John D. Siebe â I am not only in favor of the idea suggested
by The Call but I stand ready to do my share to make it a success. I
do not want to be pounced down upon by a band of grafters, yet I am
willing to stand my share of theexpense of the movement suggested by
ill. People cannot spend their money in a more patriotic way.
When we think of the justice of the cause it should make us all feel
like rendering aid.
be given something for their money
.' uld feel sure that the money
would go to a noble cause. The idea of
illustrating recent history by pyrotech
nica is a good one, also, and there
seems to be nothing in the way of car
rying it out.
AUDITOR BRODERICKâ It is not
scheme suggested for raising
money (or tnich purposes that sue
3, but this one will go if it is put
in the hands of people with executive
ability, though it will require work to
get it on a good footing. It would be a
line idea to have a permanent fair for
the benefit of the Red Cross, for the
ciiu^f is a noble one.
CHARLES ZINKANDâ The Red
Cross movement is a good thing in
every land. It stands for humane
methods on the battlefield and for all
that we love in this country. I am,
therefore, heartily in favor of any en
tertainment of fair that will bring
munev to the <ause.
TAIN BEN BOHEN, Chief of
Detectives â The Call's movement for
the R( 1 <'ross is all rip;ht. I favor any
thing that will raise money for the sol
dlera who may bo. in need or who may
Lv wounded on the field of battle.
ATTORNEY GENERAL W. F.
FITZGERALDâ You may quote me aa
beinK heartily in favor of any move
ment that will be of benefit to the men
who are now offering their lives to the
country. I see much good in The Calls
suggestion of a fair for the aid of the
Red Cross. It could be so conducted
as to be a means of raising a great
deal of money for thÂ° cause. I hope it
will be devised and carried out as out
lined by the paper.
ASSISTANT UNITED STATES AT
TORNEY SAMUEL KXIGHTâ The
movement is a good one, and I hope to
ccc it succeed. It is one of the most
practicable as well as one of the pleas
antest ways that money can be raised
for. tlie cause that is now dear to all
! American hearts.

lij baby was about six weeks old when the

did not do any good. A friend spoke of Cv-

her head in warm water and Cuticura Soaf
and gently combed the scales off. They did

amusement for' the people as well as a
source of funds for the soldiers.
HUGH CRAIG, president of the
Chamber of Commerce â Up to the pres
ent time the noble women who are
managing the affairs of the Red t'r'>ss
Society have been largely dependent
on the efforts of the business commun
ity to secure the success that has
crowned their efforts. The business
]n<>n have contributed to the fund quite
generously and they are willing to
again contribute. They are in hearty
accord with the purposes of the Red
Cross Society and will be found at all
times only too happy to assist in the
good work being so effectually per
formed.
The idea of holding a fair for the ben
efit of the Red Cross Society is a grand
one and it will receive the support <>f
every man, woman and child in our
Golden State. We, who are home, are
only too pleased to be able to assist in
every way to make the lot of those who
have sailed away under the stars and
stripes to fight for Old Glory and hu-
manity more comfortable.
I believe that a fair would net many
thousands of dollars to the Red Cross
Society. Let every county in the State
take an active part in making it a
grand success. There should be ath
letic events during the day and at
night we could give pyrotechnic pic
tures of what has been accomplished
and what is being accomplished by our
heroes in Manila Bay.
Each county should, and I know will,
leave nothing undone that might con
tribute to the success of the fair. The
historic records of each county should
be sent to the fair. We should also
have tableaux representing the pro
gress of the State from the time of the
early padres until the discovery of gold,
when thousands crossed the plains. We
should also have exhibitions of feats at
arms. The troops in our midst could
also give mimic pictures of war.
EVERYBODY WILLING TO HELP.
Arthur Rodgers, Regent of the State Universityâ The idea of the
Red Cross Fair is a noble one, and there cannot be any doubt as to the
success of the project. The fair will receive the enthusiastic support
of the people of the State of California, Every one is willing and anx
ious to contribute his mite to a fund that is to be devoted solely to aid
ing those who have left their homes and families to fight under the
Hag of our country.
Every one Is willing to help and there
should not be any difficulty in making
the fair a success. A general commit
tee of, say 100, should be appointed and
each county in the State invited to
take an active interest in the matter.
I feel satisfied that the railroad com
pany will, under the circumstances,
grant free transportation to accredited
representatives from the interior and
also bring here and safely return all ex
hibits.
By all means let us have the fair, for
I know that it will be a grand success,
both financially and otherwise.
I. "W. HELLMAN JR.â The idea of
having a fair In this city, to be par
ticipated in by all the counties in the
State, the proceeds to go to the l'Â«-d
Cross League, is an excellent one. Too
much cannot be done for such a worthy
object. This fair would give an oppor
tunity to those not yet called on to help
the soldiers now fighting in the defense
of this country.
It would undoubtedly attract im
mense crowds and would net a large
amount without taxing any one indi
vidually.
The plan proposed would make It an
object of interest for every one, and I
do not doubt that besides the attend
ance of citizens of this city excursions
would come from all the surrounding
counties.
WEDDED AMID PINK
AND WHITE BLOSSOMS
NUPTIALS OF MISS KELLY AND
X J. DOLLARD.
Elaborate Church Ceremony at St.
Dominic's, Followed by a
Brilliant Reception.
St. Dominic's Church was crowded to
the doors last evening with a fashionable
audience that had assembled to witness
the nuptials of Miss Mary Theresa Kelly
and Edward J. Dollard.
Pink and white fragrant blossoms, ar
tlsticUlly arrang-od by the loving hands of
the bride's friends, made the church beau
tiful and furnished the color tone of the
functions.
Long before the hour announced for the
ceremony, 8:30 o'clock, the invited guests
began to arrive, but so efficiently had the
ushers performed their duties that when
the bridal march announced the arrival
of the wedding party, all were comfort
ably seated.
The ushers, Messrs. Hugh McQlnnlss,
Fred Farmar, William Humphreys and
John Mahony, followed by the brides
maids, Miss Annie Kelly, Miss Daisy
Keane, Miss Laura Kelly and Miss Doro

honor. Miss Lizzie Mahony, at the church
door and proceeded up the center aisle
to the sanctuary where the groom and his
best man, Arthur W. Dollard, awaited
their coming. Here, standing in the midst
of delicate blossoms, Father Riley pro
nounced the holy binding words.
Although several thousand invitations
were issued for the ceremony, invitations
to the brilliant reception at the Kolly
home on California street were limited
to 250, The entire lower floor of the ele

THE MAYOR
IS NOT A
CANDIDATE
Declines to Enter Into
State Politics.
MAKES A FINAL STATEMENT.
HIS WITHDRAWAL INJURES
MAGUIRE'S CHANCES.
Becent Events That Are Considered
Favorable to the Candidacy
Lieutenant Governor
Jeter.
Mayor Phelan is not seeking nor does
he desire the nomination for Governor
on the Democratic ticket. This is
final and authoritative and may be con
sidered as one of the few certainties
that are to be drawn from the whirl
pool of Democratic dissension.
"You may say that I am not a can
didate for the gubernatorial nomina
tion," said the Mayor yesterday, "and
I trust that the statement will set at
rest any conclusions that may have
been drawn concerning my position as
regards State politics."
The fact that Phelan Is no longer a
factor in the race for the place at the
head of the Democratic ticket will not
prove to be welcome news to the friends
of Congressman Maguire. These friends
have contended that with Phelan in
the race for Governor the support of
other candidates would be so weakened
by his candidacy that Maguire would
stand an excellent chance of carrying
off the plum. Now that the Mayor is
no longer a factor, the candidacy of at
least, one other aspirant becomes so for
midable that the probability that Ma
guire will not secure the nomination
becomes almost a certainty.
Now that Phelan has dropped out of
the rate for the nomination the list of
those who will put in claims for the
place at the head of the ticket is re
duced to Maguire, J. H. Seawell, H.
M. LaÃue and Lieutenant Governor
Jeter. Frank H. Goulds recent state
ment that he is not a candidate is ta
ken as the true definition of his posi
tion.
As the candidacy of Seawell and L.a
| Rue is not considered to be formidable
i in any sense of the word, the fight ap
; pears to have narrowed down to Ma
guire and Jeter. This brings the ques
i tion back to the point of the signifl
1 cance of Phelan's withdrawal from the
race. The recent alliance between
Governor Budd and Mayor Phelan is
well known and may now be as well
understood. The part taken by the
: Governor in the appointment of the un
| popular City and County Committee
was the first visible evidence that the
two executives had come to an under
; standing. This understanding appears
to have been made on the basis of the
proposition that "You scratch my back
, and I'll scratch yours." In other words,
if the Governor will aid Phelan to
again become Mayor of San Francisco
the Mayor will assist Budd to defeat
Maguire-. Budd's enmity to Maguire is
well known and of long standing, and
it has long been an open secret that
Jeter is the administration candidate
for the Democratic nomination for Gov
ernor. With Phelan in the race for the
nomination the candidacy of Jeter
would be irreparably weakened. With
Phelan out of the race and pledged to
throw his support to the administra
tion candidate Jeter's chances of suc
cess become so bright that Magulre's
candidacy is rendered almost hopeless.
Regarding the comparative strength
of the two candidates the following
figures Bhowinj the vote cast in the
Fourth Congressional District in No
vember, 1894, teil their own story:
J. H. Budd W. T. Jeter J. G. Maguire
Governor. Lieut. Gov. Congress.
18,833. 15.164. 14,748.
This was in Magulre's own district,
\ where he is supposed to have more
i strength than in any other district in j
| the State. At that time Jeter was a i
comparative stranger to the voters of
the State while Maguire was at the |
height of his popularity. Even under
those conditions 416 more votes were
cast for Jeter than for Maguire. This is
| an argument that cannot be success
| fully combatted by the sophists who are
I prating of the rreat personal popularity
lof the Congressman. Since the election
of 1891 jKer has gained a hoal of
friends and has made no enemies, while
Maguire, by his utterances concerning
American sailors, as well as by the
manner in which he has promulgated
his single-tax theories to the detriment
of the farmer:? and the working classes
has minimized the popularity ot which |
he may at one time have boasted the j
possession.
Recent reports of Maguire's desire to ]
retire from a contest that- he now be
lieves to be hopeless are given credence !
by men in his own party who are in !
touch with political events. They pro- !
fess to believe that at the proper time
he will publicly announce his determin
ation to retire from the gubernatorial
race and that he will give as a reason
for the step the belief that his duty to
the people and himself demands that
he carry out the work he has begun in
Congress. Acting on this belief he will
a^sk for the Congressional nomination
in the Fourth District.
Mayor Phelan's declination to take I
more than a passive part In State poli- j
tics leads to the conclusion that he has \
finally made up his mind to remain at
the head of municipal affnirs as long as
he is permitted to do so by the citizens
of San Francisco. His friends declare
that 'it is his ambition to be elected
Mayor at the coming election, and that
after serving one year he will ask the
voters of this city to elect him Mayor
under the provisions of the new charter
which goes into effect at the beginning
of the year 1900, provided it is ratified
by the Legislature next winter.
To accomplish this becomingly, mod
est ambition it will be necessary for
him to have control of the political ma
chinery of his party, a condition neces
sary as the first step in the task of se
curing the majority :of votes cast at
two succeeding elections. As a prelim
inary move in this direction the Mayor
has, with the assistance of his friends
and new-found : allies, brought about
the appointment of : the Democratic \
City, and County Committee, an organl- |
zation so unpopular that it is already
threatened with dissolution or some- j
thing worse. The Majsor denies that j
he ever gave voice to the statement ;
that he had turned his aristocratic I
back onÂ»the voters who have a place of j
residence south , of Market street, - but j
the personnel of his committee is suf
ficient proof of - the fact that ,he has
drawn the preater part of his council- I
men 'from the aristocratic precincts of
the "Western : 'Addition and has : given
the "marble heart" .to â  the Democrats

holds. The following table, published
once before in these columns, shows
the manner in which the new City and
County Committee was appointed, and
may be taken as proof of the assertion
that in the selection of the committee
men a direct and intentional slight was
put upon those districts that have al
ways been and are now the strongholds
of the Democratic party of this city:

labor organizations have denounced
the one and the other respectable ele
ments of the community that have ban
ished the other will no doubt join hands
at the coming election for the purpose
of demonstrating to the ambitious
Mayor that the candidate who bids for
the support of such corruptionists is
not to be trusted with the position of
chief executive of the city of San
Francico.
The men who are responsible for the
existence of the new City and County
Committee are becoming badly fright
ened at the position in which they find
themselves and their white elephant,
the committee, and advice is being
sought for in all directions. Senator
White has been apprised of the situa
tion and an urgent plea has been made
to him to come at once to San Fran
cisco and lend his aid and his influence
to stem the tide of insurrection. He
has heeded the call so far as to consent
to view the situation at close range,
and he is due to arrive here within a
week or ten days. What his action will
be when he becomes aware of the true
state of affairs remains to be seen.
PRESSED BY CREDITORS.
Friedlander & Co. Attached to Secure
the Payment of Two Promis
sory Notes.
The hat and cap manufacturing firm of
S. J. Frfedlander & Co., doing business at
21 and 23 Sansome street, is in financial
distress. An attachment was levied on
the concern by S. \V. Levy, a commission
merchant, to secure the payment of two
promissory notes aggregating $19,000. The
first of the notes was executed on April
5 lai<t, and was for $1500, of which sum $500
has been paid. The other note for $IS,OOO
is dated June 1 and payable on demand.
A few hours later another attachment
suit was begun by the Bank of California
to secure $2u,u00, alleged to be due on five
promissory notes. The attorneys for the
bank \\<-re considerably discomfited when
they learned that the firm had been al
ready attached. The attachment papers
were left in the hands of the Sheriff and
a levy will be made to-day if anything re
mains to be attached. Three mortgages
against Frtedlander's property on Pacific
avenue, between Van Ness avenue and
Franklin street, were placed on record
yesterday in the Recorder's office. The
mortgages were given to secure notes exe
cuted on the 7th inst. One of the notes is
for 12100 and is drawn in favor of Anna
More, administratrix of the estate of J. C.
Mere. Another note is for $5100 65 in favor
of Lisette Friedlander, executrix of the
< state of A. J. Friedlander; while the
third note Is executed In favor of Sol
Moses, executor of the estate of Herman
Friedlander to secure the payment of
AN ELECTRIC SWITCH.
Market Street Railway Company In-
troduces a Novel Device.
The Market-street Railway Company is
placing a new electric switch at the junc
tion of Eddy and Fillmore streets. It is
the first one ever used on this coast and
is manufactured in Now Jersey: It is
placed between the rails flush with the
pavement and looks like the cover of a
conduit manhole. This box contains a
magnet with underground wire connec
tions with the track rails at a distance
of sixty feet in each direction. By sim
ply turning a lever under his hand the
motorman throws the switch without
having to slacken the speed of the car.
When the car passes beyond the sixty
foot limit the switch replaces itself auto
matically. These switches are simple in
construction and if they prove satisfac
tory will do away with the delay In the
present method of throwing a switch.

Patriotic Policemen.
Rivalry exists in police circles as well
as in other walks of life. That this is true
was borne out by the latest move on th :
part of the O'Farrell-street squad in buy
ing a beautiful silken flag to flaunt to the
breezes that blow past their station
house. About two weeks agr> the officers
on duty at California and Kearny became
imbued with the same feeling of natriot
lsm that pervades the minds of every one
at the present time and "clubbing" to
gether raised a neat sum, which was de
voted to the purchase of the stars and
stripes. Sergeant Mooney of the O'Far
rell-sireet station called a council of war
yesterday, with the result that a dupli
cate emblem of patriotism occupies a po
sition of prominence in front of the sta
tion. Patrol Driver Pat Corbett has been
appointed color sergeant and he hoists
the banner of liberty daily, and now as
the men pass in they look with pride on
the evidence of their patriotism.
