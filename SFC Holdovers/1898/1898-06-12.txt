MADRID, June 11.â An official dispatch received
here from Havana, dated Friday, June 10, says:
" This morning Admiral Sampson's ships com
menced the bombardment of Santiago de Cuba. At
the same time a number of boats, towed by a steam
er, approached, and attempted to make a landing.
The cannonade lasted three hours. The Spaniards,
skillfully posted, repulsed the attempt at landing,
and the Americans drew off. No damage was caused
by the shells from the warships, which kept at a
distance, evidently afraid to venture within range of
the guns of the forts."

KINGSTON, Jamaica, June 11.â The military
gunboat Vixen has succeeded in landing 400
rifles, five tons of provisions and 60,000 rounds
of ammunition for the insurgents at Asserado.
Spanish cavalry interfered with the work and
the Vixen's shells did great execution among
them.
The Yankee, which arrived at Port Antonio
at 9 o'clock to-night, reports all is quiet at San
tiago de Cuba, and that there has been no re
sumption of the bombardment by Admiral
Sampson. The Spaniards are afraid to fire for
fear of further punishment. The officers of the
Yankee positively deny the statement that the
Spaniards have tampered with the wreck of the
sunken collier Merrimac. Her funnel and masts
were still plainly visible this morning.
The fleet is anxiously awaiting the arrival of
troops. Six hundred refugees have arrived at
Montego Bay from Manzanillo.
Asserado, or Aserradero, where the Vixen
landed arms and supplies for the insurgents, is
a small village on the southeastern coast of
Cuba. It is about as far to the west of Santiago
de Cuba as Guantanamo, where 850 marines
were landed, is to the east.
From the fact that operations are being car
ried on at these places on either side of Santiago
the inference is that Admiral Sampson's fleet is
patrolling the coast in that vicinity for about 100
miles.

Information has been received
here, by way of Port au Prince,
that a large force of Americans
landed yesterday on the shores of
Guantanamo, near Caimanera, and
cut the cable; that the terminus
at that point is in the possession
of the Americans and that every
effort will be made to reopen
communication with New York
via Cape Haytien. A force of

Cape Haytien as soon as a

I them over.
WASHINGTON, June n.â
The Navy Department was in
communication to-day with Ad
miral Sampson off Santiago by
cable and by mail, with the result
that it is" now known officially
that the American flag floats over
Cuba, and that it was raised by
United States marines at the
mouth of Guantanamo Bay.
The marines who have thus
glorified themselves were 800 in
number. They were obliged to
fight for their lives, and in the
course of that fight to burn down
the town chosen as the site of
debarkation. All is ready at
Guantanamo for the landing of
United States regular troops as
soon as they arrive there, the ma
rines holding the ground they
won and being protected by th*
guns of the Marblehead, under
Captain McCalla, who has al
ready during the present war so
distinguished himself by ener
getic and valuable services as to
encourage the belief that he will
regain the numbers he lost some
time ago through an unfortunate
incident. Regarding the fleet of
transports, no statement is ob
tainable at the War Department,
and it is believed that the situa
tion is as it stood yesterday with
respect to the starting of the ex
pedition.

which crouched on the beach under the
hilltop of Guantanamo.
The whol operation of silencing the
guns and landing the forces was as
easy as placing a Sunday school pic
nic. The Marblehead had, backed by
the Vixen and Dolphin, opened on the
earthworks. The shore? t< the light of
the entrance were lined with guns and
rifle pits, but the Spaniards stampeded
after firing a few shots.
The city of Guantanamo lies four
miles up the bay, and a little
gunboat came down to help the shore
batteries. But she stayed just long
enough to turn around. Numerous
shots were fired by ths Spaniards, but
not one landed, and no Americans -were
injured.
The main fort lies within the city
limits and is still to be reduced, but it
is not in a difficult position, and the
American officers say it can be taken
in fifteen minutes when desired.
The Marblehead, Dolphin, Vixen and
two colliers have been off the entrance
of the harbor for several days and yes
terday morning they sailed into the
channel. A mile further up they opened
fire, sending fifty shots at the fortifi
cations on the left. The fulls on the
right of the entrance were deserted.
There are no defenses on the rieht
side of the harbor.
No attempt was made to land until
the Oregon steamed in early this morn
ing. Captain Clark immediately sent
forty marines ashore and twenty from
the Marblehead followed. They found
evidence of a very hasty departure by
the Spaniards. Watches, hammocks
and ammunition were scattered among
the earthworks and a Spanish flag was
found in one of the rifle pits. The little
detachment or marines held the place

TalK of Proposal for Peace, Which

America's Terras.
BERLIN, June 11.â Although the
anti-American feeling continues here
the latest war news, coupled with of
ficial warnings that such comments
were endangering the commercial In
terests of Germany, have compelled the
newspapers to modify their ultra pro-
Spanish sympathies and some of them
aro beginning to admit that Spain is In
a perilous condition.
The Deutsche Zeitung says it thinks
the moment has arrived for diplomatic
intervention in regard to the Philippine
Islands and adds: "We confidently ex
pect the Foreign Office to act speedily
and energetically, as we cannot allow
the islands to pass into the hands of
America."
The Vossische Zeitung says: "In the
Philippines Spain's punishment for cen
turies of misrule Is imminent. The
cruel massacre of the patriot Risal and
thousands of agals find a bloody re
compense." The Vossische Zeiiung is
the first Berlin paper to publish the re
ports of a special correspondent sent to
Tampa.
The Post of this city admits that
Spain's affairs have arrived at a criti
cal stage, and says: "If, in addition
to other misfortunes, the throne is up
set by a civil war, Spain would lose
all sympathy hitherto felt for her by
the Continental powers."
The Kreuz Zeitung says it can con
firm the report that several of the pow
ers are consulting on the subject of
mediation between Spain and the
United States.
LONDON, June 11.â In regard to the
rumored peace propositions of Spain
the Pall Mall Gazette says: "Mr. Bal
four will sum up the case. We should
be delighted to do anything to help,
but we could not think of it unless both
partios seemed likely to welcome it and
mean business, which they do not.
That's just it. America is ready for
peace, but only on the terms she is en
titled to. Spain is ready for peace, but
on 'let us pretend that nothing has hap
pened terms.' Unless Spain sees the
PRICE FIVE CENTS,
childishness of this, there is no hops
for peace. In the meanwhile no power
is likely to invite a well deserved snub
by babbling about uninvited interven
tion or a congress."
MADRID, June 11.â The campaign!
Inaugurated by some of the foreign
newspapers In favor of peace between
Spain and the United States is not ap
proved here. According to the opinions
of several generals, Spain is capable of
continuing the war in Cuba for two
years, even under the most unfavorable
circumstances. Therefore, they add, it
Is useless to talk of peace unless It ap
plies to a return to the statu quo antÂ«
bellum.
The Government, It Is added, has not
received any suggestions of peace from
the powers, and In political circles it is
declared that if such a suggestion were
received the Government would po
litely decline to entertain it on thÂ«
ground that Spain has decided to pur
sue the war to the bitter end.
Dispatches received here from Cuba
announce that yellow fever is ravaging
Rear Admiral Sampson's fleet, the
province of Santiago de Cuba being, it
is claimed, the hotbed of the disease.
In the Chamber of Deputies to-day
the Government was interrogated as to
whether the United States had notified
the powers of the blockade of Cuba and
whether the powers recognized the
blockade as effective.
Duke Almodovar de Rio, the Foreign
Minister, replied that since the Paris
conference conditions had radically
changed, and the powers had not yet
decided whether the blockade is effec-
tive. The Government, he said, was re
solved to uphold Spain's rights, and he
added that he did not believe it was
legitimate for the United States to en
courage the Philippine insurgents as a
belligerent power.
Many of the newspapers advocate the
keeping at home of Admiral Camara'a
fleet for the purpose of defending the
coast.

SETS FORTH
THE BRAVERY
OF HOBSON
Detailed Official Report of
Sampson on the
Heroic Deed.
Sinking of the Merrimac the Most
Daring Act Since Gushing
Blew Up the Albermale.
WASHINGTON, June H.â The Navy Department to-day posted the
following bulletin giving a detailed official report from Admiral Sampson
upon the heroism of Lieutenant Hobson and his men in sinking the Merrimac
in the Santiago channel:
"United States Flagship New York, off Santiago, June 3, 1898. â Permit
me to call your special attention to Assistant Naval Constructor Hobson. As
stated in a special telegram sent me before coming her*, I was ordered to make
the harbor entrance secure against the possibility of egress by Spanish ships
by obstructing the narrow part of the entrance by sinking a collier at that
point. Upon calling upon Mr. Hobson for his professional opinion as to
a sure method of sinking the ship, he manifested the most lively interest in
the problem. After several days' consideration he presented a solution which
he considered would insure the immediate sinking of the ship when she
reached the desired point in the channel. This plan we prepared for execu
tion when we reached Santiago. The plan contemplated a crew of only seven
men and Mr. Hobson, who begged that it might be intrusted to him. The
anchor chains were arranged on deck for both the anchors, forward and aft.
the plan including the anchoring of the ship almost automatically.
"As soon as I reached Santiago and had the collier to work upon, the
details were completed and diligently prosecuted, as we hoped to complete
them in one day. as the moon and tide served best the first night after our
arrival. Notwithstanding, the hour of 4 o'clock in the morning arrived and
preparation was scarcely completed. After a careful inspection of the final
preparations I was forced to relinquish the plan for that morni-g, as dawn
was breaking, though Mr. Hobson begged to try it at all hazards.
"This morning proved more propitious, as a prompt tart was made, and
nothing could have been more gallantly executed. We waited impatiently
after the firing by the Snaniard had ceased. When the men did not reappear
from the harbor I feared that they had all perished. A steam launch which
had been sent in charge of Naval Cadet Powell to rescue the men appeared
at this time coming out under a persistent fire of the batteries, but brought
none of the crew. A careful inspection of the harbor from the ship showed
that the â  essel Merrimac had been sunk in the channel.
"This afternoon the chief of staff of Admiral Cervera came out under a
flag of truce with a letter from the admiral extolling the bravery of the crew
in an unusual manner.
"I cannot myself too earnestly express my appreciation of the con
duct of Mr. Hobson and his gallant crew. I venture to say that a more
brave and daring thing has not been done since Cushing blew up the
Albemarle.
â¢â Referring to the inspiring letter which was addressed to the officers at
the beginning of the war, I am sure you will offer a. suitable professional
reward to Mr. Hobson and his companions.
'"I must add that Commander J. N. Miller relinquished his command
with the very greatest reluctance, believing he should retain his command
under all circumstances. He was, however, finally convinced that the attempt
of another person to carry out the multitude of details which had been in prep
aration by Mr. Hobson might endanger its prosecution. I therefore-took the
liberty to remove him for this reason only. There were hundreds of volun
teers who were anxious to participate; there were isornen in the crew,, nearly
as many from this ship, and large numbers from all tlie other ships, officers
and men alike. W. T. SAMPSON."
LIEUTENANT HOBSON
HAS WON THE REWARD
So He Will Get the Recognition Ac-
corded Cushing and Be
Advanced.
WASHINGTON June 11.â The only
subject for an official bulletin to-day at
the Navy Department was Hobson's
glorious feat In bottling up the Span
ish squadron with the hull of the Mer
rimac. With the frankness and candor
peculiar to the man, Admiral Sampson
withheld no credit from Hobson for
either the execution or projection of a
well-worked out scheme to which the
constructor was entitled, and he has
cleared away the small cloud of dis
satisfaction that had shown itself
among a few of the line officers because
of the selection of a staff officer in the
person of Hobson to conduct the des
perate enterprise.
Reference was made in Sampson's
statement to the "Inspiring letter" of
Secretary Long, as a basis for the re
quest for Hobson's promotion. With
the consent of Secretary Long the par
â¢ the chamber was crowded, Primero de
Rivera, former Governor-General of the
Philippine^, making a long defense of
his administration in the Philippines.
He said that in 1881 he asked that a
p6werful squadron be sent to the Phil
ippines, and that the other defenses of
the islands be increased. He later,
during the critical relations with the
United States, informed his Govern
ment that an American squadron was
about to appear at Manila, and again
asked for several ironclads and other
war vessels.
The Government wired him May 12,
1897, that he need not fear a war with
the United States and that he could
return to Spain, but on March 12, 1898,
he received another telegram announc
ing that war was probable between the
Knited States and Spain, and instruct
ing him to prepare for the defense of
the Philippines, "but," said the speak
er, "what means of defense had I, when
everything I had requested since 1881
had been refused? I know I ought not
to divulge this matter in the interest
of Spain."
At this point a Senator cried: "The
moment has come to say all."
General Rivera, continuing, declared
that the Spanish squadron in the Phil
ippines, owing to lack of means of de
*ense, was foredoomed to perish. Af
-,er declaring that a native army in
'ihe Philippines was absolutely neces
sary, as Epropeans could not survive
the climate and the attendant diseases,
he spoke of the agreement with the
rebels by which the chief, Agulnaldo,
undertook to submit, if the Government
would give a certain sum to the widows
and orphans of the insurgents. A tenth
part of this sum was given to Agui
naldo, who undertook to distribute it.
General Bivera concluded by declar
ing that he would give up the cross
with which hr was decorated if the
chamber did not think him worthy of
it.
Senor Romero Giron, the Minister of
the Colonies, made a reply, praising
General Primero de Rivera's service
and at the same time assuring the
tlcular passage in the letter to which
Admiral Sampson referred is now made
public. It reads:
"Each man engaged in the work of
the inshore squadron should have in
him the stuff of which to make a pos
sible Cushing; and if the man wins the
recognition given him shall be as great
as that given to Cushing, so far as the
department can bring 1 it about.
"JOHN D. LONG, Secretary."
Hobson has won and if he escapes
from his present thraldom the Navy-
Department will redeem Its promise.
A consultation-ftf the records of the
Navy Department shows that the re
cognition accorded Cushing was in his
advancement one full grade, that is,
from the rank of lieutenant, which he
had when he took his little boat up to
the Albermarle, to the rank of lieu
tenant commander. In addition he was
given a vote of thanks by Congress. If
Hobson is rewarded in the same meas
ure he will, if kept in his corps, be
raised to the rank of lieutenant com
mander at least, and made a full con
; structor instead of the assistant con-
I structor he now is.
chamber that the Government was
working incessantly to prevent the
country's woes from increasing, which
was to be feared. The debate then
ended.
RAIN FALLING DAILY
IN THE GULF REGION
Wet Weather Will Now Be the Rule
Until the Coming of
Autumn.

KEY WEST, June 11.â The rainy sea
son seems to have finally set in through
out the gulf region. It has been an
unusually dry season up to now, the
oldest inhabitants and the natives de
clare, but yesterday the spell was
broken by a downpour that turned the
dusty streets of Key West into rivers
and rain has been coming down ever
since, with brief glimpses crt sunshine.
Every day from this time until fall wet
weather will be the rule, with occa
sional squalls and hurricanes that are
features of the West Indian region dur
ing the summer months.
In Cuba the rainy season really be
gan two or three weeks ago. but the
rain did not extend beyond the borders
of the island. Boats cruising along the
Cuban coast have at times been unable
to see the shore because of rain equalls,
although the sun was shining down on
the boats' decks.
Every moraine: and every evening
there has been heavy rain, accompanied
by lightning. The rainy season has
been one of the things most dreaded
in connection with the Cuban invasion,
but for some time it looked as if there
was not going to be much rain all dur
ing the summer, owing to its long delay
in beginning.

from Shanghai that the extension of

THE SA^ FRANCISCO CA^L, SUNDAY, JTmE 12, 1898.
DREGS OF YELLOW JOURNALISM.
The Associated Press Used by the Examiner- Journ a
Management to Foist a Fake Upon trje Press of
Recently this paper printed an item in its war news incidental to the
bombardment of Santiago, not for its intrinsic importance, but because
any information concerning the work of the American fleet is interest
ing.
The item came by Associated Press, an organization serving most of
the newspapers of this country and supposed to be controlled for their
benefit, as it is made up of newspaper proprietors, and is not an inde
pendent agency peddling its wares to who will buy. The papers com
posing the Associated Press insist that the news it carries must be au
thentic. Such the Santiago item was naturally supposed to be. Yet it
was a fake. It had been taken from the New York Journal. Had The
Call been aware of this circumstance the matter would of course have
been instantly discredited and cast aside without investigation.
The same dispatch was received in the office of the Journal's vermi
form appendix, yet the Examiner refrained from publishing it, well
knowing that it had appeared in the Journal, a fact of which others were
uninformed. Being in league with the yellowest of fakers, it was warn
ed of trickery, and its seeming acumen was but due to the fact that it was
party to a piece of contemptible rescality. It was willing, as the Jour
nal had been, that hundreds of papers all over the country should be vic
tims of a deliberate fake, so that it might entrap one rival. Such is the
substance of the Journal's confession. Then, with an almost unspeaka
ble nerve, it boasts of its own degradation.
The feature still to be explained is how the Associated Press was
made party to such an unclean transaction, why it sent Journal "news"
without letting decent papers know what they were getting, or why it
should send Journal "news" at all. Let Journal "news" be branded and
it loses power to deceive.

NEW ORLEANS, June 11.â The
Louisiana State Board of Health has
been informed by Dr. H. R. Carter of
the United States Marine Hospital
service that the Fontainbleau camp,
near Paseagoula. is now open for the
reception of yellow fever patients.
A telegram was received to-night
from Dr. Gill. Health Officer of Missis
sippi, announcing that there was a sus
picious case of fever at Bonds, Miss., a
small station on the Gulf and Ship Is
land road, fifteen miles north of Mc-
Henry. In consequence of this dispatch
the board decided to place inspectors on
the trains, who will stop all passengers
from infected districts.
The town of McHenry is quarantined
in a most rigid manner. A gentleman
and his wife attempted to leave the
place last night. Dr. Haralson, the
State Health Officer in charge, imme
diately disinfected himself, changed
his clofclng and went in pursuit and
brought the refugees back.
WASHINGTON, June 11. â Reports
received to-day by Surgeon-General
Wyman indicate energetic measures
are being resorted to by the representa
tives of the Marine Hospital Service at
McHenry to stamp out yellow fever at
that place and to prevent its spreading.
Surgeon Murray reports that a guard
of twenty-two men has been placed
around the town and Surgeon Carter
States that a house-to-house inspection
is being conducted on the line of the
Gulf and Ship Island Railroad, in or
der to make sure there are no cases
outside of McHenry.
ATLANTA, Ga., June 11.â Sixty-five
sick soldiers arrived here last night
from Tampa, and were taken to the
General Army Hospital at McPherson.
Nearly all are regulars. Many of the
sick are suffering from fever. There
are now about 140 patients at this hos
pital and all are being well taken care
of.
JACKSON, Miss., June 11.â The State
Board of Health has been advised that
two new cases of yellow fever have de
veloped at McHenry within the
past twenty-four hours, but no deaths
have been reported to the board.

both houses that the presiding officers
shall not sign such measures save when
respective houses are in session, the bill
still lacks the signatures necessary be
fore the President affixes his approval.
While the House was in session to-day,
the Senate was not, and it is thought best
to attend to these details together. Ac

FOR SUMMER
CAMPAIGN
Conditions Favorable in
Portions of Cuba.
WHERE THERE IS NO DANGER.
CLIMATE IS MORE FAVORABLE
THAN IN SOUTHERN STATES.
If Pacific Blockade Is Kept Up It
Will Mean the Extermination
of People in Three
Provinces.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 11.â The Medical
News in its issue of to-day will pub
lish a discussion of the advisability of
a summer campaign in Cuba, written
by Dr. D. F. Lame of Philadelphia,
who is a ( Ã¼ban-Amerioan, in which he
says in part: "The unpreparedness of
the military branch of the Government
has become so apparent and from all
accounts the necessity of a much larger
body of troops to invade the island so
evident, that I can well understand the
hesitation on the part of the Washing
ton authorities to land iroops at this
season of the year around Havana and
Matanzas. In fact, I am about con
vinced that unless Havana In the
meanwhile capitulates from lack of
food no troops will be landed in that
province before the month of October
or November.
"Around Santiago the conditions are
different. The country all about is
hilly and much more healthful and by
utilizing the several thousand insur
gents in the neighborhood for the pur
pose of garrisoning the city after its
capitulation, the American troops could
be safely encamped all summer under
decidedly more "advantageous condi
tions than at Chickamauga or Tampa.
"From the point of view of a Cuban,
this pacific blockade, especially if kept
up all summer, means the practical ex
termination of all the people in these
three provincesâ Pinar del Rio, Havana
and Matanzasâ and as the war, we are
told, was undertaken for ,the purpose
of saving these people, why should not
American troops be immediately land
ed on the island, even if they do run
the risk of a high death rate from cli
matic conditions, etc.?
"On the other hand, as Americans, we
are justified in reasoning the matter.
We are certainly unprepared for such
an undertaking. Our soldiers, mostly
men who were only yesterday clerks and
mill hands, are not even supplied with
one of the most essential and vital
things for a summer campaign in the
tropics, and that is suitable clothing.
In such an undertaking we know that
climate does hot influence mortality as
much as deficient preparation and lack
of organization; therefore, let us take
into consideration the lives of 20,000 or
30,000 Americans as against the Cuban
unfortunates, who are, perhaps, al
ready beyond human aid. This pacific
blockade will certainly force Havana
to capitulate long before October, and
by that time we shall have a thorough
ly trained and properly equipped body
of troops."

tiago and Porto Rico Fall.
Call Office, Riggs House,
"Washington, June 11.
As Indicated in these dispatches last
night the probabilities are that a part
of the Cuban expedition Is well on Its
way toward Santiago, where It will co
operate with the marines and insur
gents in Guantanamo Bay.
The main expedition under General
Shafter is believed to be still at Tampa,
although the War Department officials
will not give out a word of news. It
was said to-day that the main expedi
tion might not wait for the re-enforce
ments to be sent from Admiral Samp
son's squadron, but that the transports
would be convoyed by vessels now as
sembled at Key West, where they
would meet the vessels sent by Ad
miral Sampson in the Windward Pas
sage.
Critics of the War Department fail
to see why there should have been any
delay whatever if this plan is now to
be adopted, for if the troopships may
steam as far as the Windward Passage
under convoy of the light vessels they
can make the rest of the voyage with
j out fear of the Spaniards. The only
j danger apprehended was from Spanish
gunboats supposed to be lurking in the
vicinity of Havana harbor.
Waval officials do not credit the re
| ports of the presence of Spanish ships
I in Cuban waters, with the possible ex
ception of several small gunboats
which have been in some of the har
bors for a long time. They maintain that
they have had the coast clear, for the
sailing of transports for three weeks,
and are inclined to place the blame for
the delay in sending troops upon the
shoulders of army officials. Naval of
ficers dd not hesitate to say that the
convoy to be furnished by the Navy
Department is strong enough to afford
ample protection to the transports.
In endeavor to assist the army the
Navy Department has even gone so far
as to offer to send several armor-clads
around Cape Maysi from Santiago to
meet the transport fleet. It was said
to-day that immediately following the
capture of Santiago a fresh force of
volunteer soldiers will be ordered there,
to hold the city, while the regulars,
with a sprinkling of volunteers, wilr
leave for Porto Rico tÂ» complete the
subjugation of that island. The vol
unteers to be used at Santiago will
probably leave upon receipt of news
that the city has been captured.
The President has no desire to go be
yond the limits now fixed', but it is in
his mind to force Spain to terms by

filed up the narrow path, eventually
taking up a position at the top of the
hill. As soon as the American flag was
swung out to the breeze from the flag
staff of the captured Spanish camp, the
Oregon steamed away to rejoin the fleet
off Santiago. The marines will hold the
position until the arrival of the expected
troops, in the meantime scouting in the
vicinity, with the Marblehead, Vixen
and Dolphin lying by to protect them.
Rear Admiral Sampson now has a
harbor and base of supplies on the
south side of the island, and troops can
be landed at will. The troopship Pan
ther reached the fleet off Santiago early
to-day. On her way over the Yosemite
fired a dozen shells into the port of
Daiquiri, but received no response.
Guantanamo is about forty miles east
of Santiago de Cuba, and is a splendid
location for a base of supplies for the
blockading fleet.
It is understood that the island of
Cuba is entirely cut off from cable com
munication with the outside world. Re
port here has it that the cable ship
Adria cut the cable at Santiago on
Monday and that the same day the St.
Louis cut the cable running from Guan
tanamo to Mole St. Nicholas, Hayti.
She was interrupted by shells from the
shore, but the Marblehead sent several
shells at the soldiers and scattered
them.
THE MONTEREY IS
OFF FOR HONOLULU
Finished Coaling Early in the Morn
ing and Left San Diego at
Noon.
SAN DIEGO, June 11.â The Monterey ;
sailed at 12:45 p. m. to-day for Hono
lulu. The Monterey commenced taking
on coal at 4 a. m., the men at the bun- !
kers having worked all night filling the
lighters with the dusky "diamonds
which were carefully Inspected by the
officers as the coal was rapidly stowed
on board.
No men were allowed to go ashore
here except one or two officers and the ;
paymaster, who came off for supplies.
Water and fresh provisions were added
to the 150 tons of coal taken as a deck
load, and all were securely stored at 10
o'clock this morning. Cipher dispacohes j
were received from the Navy Depart
raent and replied to this forenoon. ]
Itfo visitors were allowed to go on the i
Monterey before she left.
At 12:40 the big siren was sounded
and at 12:45 p. m. she got under way
and went rapidly down the harbor. The
Brutus, lying outside, Joined her, and
with the black smoke flying fro-m their
attacking her own ports if she does not
succumb after Santiago and Porto Rico
have been taken. He will not favor a
lingering war, costing hundreds of mil
lions of dollars, when the strife mifht j
be ended by attacking Spain at her own
doors to teach her a lesson. It is known
that embryo plans of this kind are un
dfr consideration, It is not believed
that more than a month will elapse be
fore something will be done in this di
rection, unless Spain shows an inclina
tion to surrender.
It is admitted by officials of the State
Department that the Monterey may
stop at the Caroline Islands en route
to Manila, but they assert positively
that the present policy. of the admin
istration does not contemplate the
seizure of either of these islands by the
Monterey, nor yet of Guajan, the prin- j
cipal island c-f the Ladrone group, by '
the Charleston. The latter ship may j
;Â£ UCh at the L adrone Islands, just as i
the Monterey may do at the Carolines, |
but there is authority for the state
ment that there is no present intention
to informally occupy any of these
islands. It is possible, however, that '
future events may make, it desirable >
to acquire some such islands as coaling I
stations on the long route between San
Francisco and Manila.
o/th^ &", c - Ve< ? that the first expedition !
of the Philippine army of invasion will
reach Manila on June 15 or 16. The un
derstanding is that the force will land '
immediately and proceed to the occu- !
patlon of Manila, under the protection !
of Admiral Dewey's guns. It is honed i
that Aguinaldo and his forces will *co- â 
operate amicably with them under the
American Hag. In the event of Agui
naldo evincing any opposition to thiÂ»
plan it is thought possible that the !
American forces may wait for thÂ« sec- I
ond expedition, though this is not prob- l
able.
The order for Captain Fred Rogers to
command the Philadelphia has been
canceled and he is ordered instead to
command the monitor Puritan with Ad
miral Sampson's fleet to relieve Captain
P. H. Harrington, who has broken down
under th.c heat and strain of the Cuban
campaign. It was said to-day that '
Captain Crowninshield of the "strategy j
board" is anxious for sea duty and i
might be given command of the Phila- .
,d<?]pnia. This is altogether likeiy for it
is well known that both President Mc-
Kfnley and Secretary Long are both
displeased With his work and have been
for some time anxious to get rid of him '
and reorganize the war board.
Lieutenant Robert D. Kerr, Corps of
Engineers, and Major J. M. Starr, ad
ditional paymaster, have been ordered
to Ran Francisco for duty with the
Philippine expeditionary force.

ANNEXATION
OF HAWAII
Advocates Declare the Isl
ands a Military
Necessity.
Opponents Show That This Coun
try Already Has a Good Route
to the Philippines.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, June 11.
The Hawaiian debate in the House
began to-day. Six speeches were made,
covering generally the contention of
th- support and opposition to the reso
lutions providing for annexation.
Hitt (R.) of Illinois and Dinsmore of
Arkansas, the ranking Republican nad
Democratic members respectively of the
Committee of Foreign Affairs, opened
the debate for and against annexation.
Clarke (D.) of Missouri spoke in oppo
sition, and Walker (R.) of Massachu
setts, Alexander (R.) of New York
and Gillette (R.) of Massachusetts in
advocacy of the proposition. There was
a good attendance in the galleries, but
hardly a quorum was at any time upon
the floor. The debate will continue
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, and
probably forty members will make
speeches.
The proceedings began with a mutual
withdrawal by Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio
and Sampson (D.) of Virginia of "un
complimentary and injurious language"
used by them to each other in the heat
of debate Thursday night, when the

revenue conference report was under
consideration.
The Senate amendments to the bill
organizing the naval hosi ital corps
were concurred In, and Hitt (R. )
of Illinois, chairman of the Committee
on Foreign Affairs, then was recog
nized to begin the Hawaiian debate ad
vocating annexation. He reviewed the
provisions of the Newlands resolution
as being practically identical with those
of the treaty before the Senate and
those of the one which was negotiated
five years since.
Thus, he said, the question was an
old one, and annexation met with the
approval of the Hawaiian republic, and
there was nothing of constraint sug
gested by the resolutions. The only
question to be considered was whether
It would be wise for this Government to
take what was offered.
Referring to the strategic importance
of the Islands, he said they constituted
a small territory, but nevertheless
nineteen great powers kept constantly
there their representatives to protect
their interests because of their pecu
liar location. Hitt quoted many naval
authorities in asserting that the pos
session of the islands was of great im
portance, and pointed out that no fleet
c>uld come from Asiatic waters to ope
rate against the western coast without
touching at Hawaii for supplies and
recoaling. The control of the islands
would bo practically an effectual bar
rier to attack upon our Western inter
ests.
As illustrating the value of the isl
ands. Hitt spoke of the recent victory
of Admiral Dewey and the necessity of
sending re-enforcements to him. TJiis
work of re-enforcement could not be
accomplished without the American
ships putting into Hawaii to recoal.
Referring to the present attitude of
Hawaii in Its open friendship and the
aiding of America, involving the viola
tion of all neutrality laws before the
whole world. Hitt contended that Spain
would have a Just and enforceable
claim against the Hawaiian republic
for all damages done to her by Ameri
can forces aided by Hawaii in violation
of neutrality. This country should not
hesitate to relieve Hawaii of the pros
pective burden and to show apprecia
tion of the friendship manifested by
those in control of the Government,
given in defiance of the entire world
and all neutrality laws. In this con
nection Hitt read from a dispatch of
recent date, from Minister Sewall In
which he said: "The strongest in
fluence has been brought to bear upon
the Government tp urge it to declare
neutrality."
Hitt paid a tribute to the character of
the Americans who have established a
republic In place of a monarchy in Ha
waii and who now dare to act inde
pendently of the world in time of the
Spanish-American war.
After reviewing other rovolutionary
movements Hitt said: "They are the
same men who took a worthless Queen
and threw her from her throne when
she attempted to disregard property
rights and ignore the constitution
wrung from her predecessor." Hitt
spoke not quite an hour, much of the
time being occupied with interruptions
by members asking questions.
Dinsmore. the ranking Democrat upon
thf Committee on Foreign Affairs.
. pened the debate in opposition. He
<?A*uared biÂ» belief that no constitu
/â¢Â«â¢Â«Â«-* Â»ower existed to annex by Joint
#*Â«oJutlon as was proposed, and op
posed annexation as being; undesirable. |
It would be, he Insisted, the first step
upon a policy of colonial aggTession, in
antagonism to the established rule of
the Government and he added that the
reaching out into foreign lands and the
establishment thereof of American in
stitutions would necessitate the aban
donment of the Monroe doctrine. Logic
would dictate it and the world would
demand it. America could not inter
fere in other lands and prohibit for
eign interference in affairs of the North
and South America continents.
Dinsmore launched into a long dis
cussion of the illegality of annexation
by reason, reading from many legal
works to show, that no power existed
to thus annex. Replying to those who
contend that Hawaii is a commercial
and naval necessity as a midocean sup
ply station, he declared there was al
ready a route to Yokohama, Hongkong
and to Manila and from San Francisco
by way of the Aleutian Islands, Amer
ican possessions, 800 miles shorter than
the Hawaiian route. me Aleutian
route, said he, is open the entire year,
and the coldest weather on record at
the Aleutians was 7 degrees above
zero. He argued that hostile ships
with the aid of colliers, could operate
against the Western coast. The hold-
ing of Hawaii would necessitate the
keeping of a powerful naval force there
and would not relieve in any sense the
necessity for keeping a great force at
the seaports of the Western coast.
Speaking of the suggestion that Ha
waii would be essential to the control
of the Nicaragua canal, Dinsmore said
San Francisco was 1000 miles nearer the
proposed mouth of the canal than Ha
waii.
Dinsmore argued that annexation
would mean foreign entanglements and
in this connection he protested against
the suggested Anglo-American alliance
as being something much to be desired
by England, but to be avoided by the
United States. Protesting finally
against taking the islands, he said: "If
we take them, God help us."
Gillette (R.) of Massachusetts, In
support of annexation, declared that
conditions had greatly changed since
the days of Washington, when the pol
icy of the new country was reasonably
against territorial extension. Then, he
said, it was farther from Massachus
setts to Pennsylvania than now from
New York to Europe. He argued for
Hawaii as a military and naval neces
sity, a controlling point of trade and
naval operations in the Pacific.
Alexander (R.) of New York said the
victory of Dewey made the annexation
of Hawaii a present necessity and made
it wise to provide for its possession and
control for future emergencies. He ex
pressed the conviction that Hawaii
would be offered by the Hawaiian Gov
ernment to England if this country
should refuse to accept it, and, having
refused, the United States could not
interfere with the Hawaiians disposing
of their own territory.
Clarke (D.) of Missouri, opposing the
resolution, snoke against an enlarged
colonization policy as something
"gorgeous in appearance, but fatal in
experience, or else history is a lie."
As a member of the Committee on
Foreign Affairs he said General Scho
field had testified before the committee
that Pearl harbor was the only harbor
in Hawaii that could be fortified, and
"that," declared Clarke, "is under the
control of this country, and from a
military standpoint we need no
more." The "Jingo bacillus.l' he declar
ed, is indefatigable in its* work, and
proceeding, he said the proposed an
nexation of Hawaii would be the enter
ing wedge to a policy that would not
end until the American territorial en
largement had gone to the extent of
including the earth.
"Mr. Speaker," declared the Mis
souri member in a characteristic
burst, "if this policy is pursued as
the jingoes want it and you are here
presiding over the House twenty
years hence you will be called upon
to recognize the gentleman from Pat
agonia, the gentleman from Cuba, the
gentleman from Porto Rico, the gen
tleman from Greenland, the gentle
man from Fiji, and, with fear and
trembling, the gentleman from the
Cannibal Islands, as he gazes with
gleaming eyes and glistening teeth
upon your imposing and tempting
self."
A great laugh followed this prediction
from the Missourian.
Parker (R-i was presiding, Mr. Reed

occupying temporarily a seat upon the
floor. The laughter was renewed when
Mr. Clarke added, "It is unnecessary to
say that I prepared that for the regular
occupant of the chair."
Concluding his speech, Clarke spoke
of the resulting representation of Ha
waii' in the House and Senate and th.c
attendant danger. He attacked furt
ther the proposition to annex on the
ground that the republic of Hawaii was
the result of a conspiracy upon the part
of the sugar interests of the islands.
That the people of the islands had been
shut out from expressing their desire
was shown, he said, by the decrease of
suffrage, 14,000 under the monarchy, to
2500 under the republic. "Let there be a
blebiscite," declared Mr. Clarke, "and
let the people exercise the right which
Is theirs to say how they shall be gov
erned."
Walker (R.) of Massachusetts spoke
for the resolution, denying that annex
ation would be followed by territorial
expansion. He said Hawaii was a com
mercial, military and naval necessity.
He digressed briefly to advocate the
construction of the Nicaragua canal as
one of the greatest needs of the United
States, and contended that Hawaii
would be essen'-ir,! to complete control
of the canal by America.
At the conclusion - his sneech the
House adjourned at 4:45 p. m.
CAPTAIN RUDGERS TO
COMMAND THE PURITAN.
The Heat of the Tropics Plays Havoc
With the Health of the
Officers.
WASHINGTON, June 11.â Captain
Frederick Rodgers, formerly president
of the Naval Auxiliary Board, has been
ordered to command the big monitor
Puritan, now with Admiral Sampson's
fleet. He relieves Captain P. F. Har
rington, who has been prostrated by
the terrible heat to which he has been
subjected during his long stay in Cu
ban waters. Lieutenant-Commander
W. H. Everett, comamnding the light
house tender Mangrove, has also suc
cumbed to the hardships of the Cuban
blockade. Both officers have been re
moved to the naval hospital at Key
West for treatment.
The assignment of Captain Rodgers
to the Puritan leaves a vacancy In the
command of the cruiser Philadelphia,
now fitting out at San Francisco for
service on the Pacific station, to which
he was originally assigned several
weeks ago. In view of the reported de
sire of Captain Crowninshield, chief of
the Bureau of Navigation, for sea duty,
it is not improbable he may be given
the command of the Philadelphia. It
is expected that she will go into com
mission at the Mare Island Navy Yard
on the Ist proximo.
GENEROUS OFFER OF THE
RED CROSS ACCEPTED
Aid of the National Association Will
Be Welcome at the Army-
Camps.
WASHINGTON, June 11.â Surgeon-
General Sternberg of the army has sent
to the chief surgeons of the army corps
and divisions the following proposition
made by the American National Red
Cross Association:
"We can put any desired amount of
supplies, ice, milk, condensed milk, etc.,
into any of the volunteer camps in a
few hours. Will you be kind enough to
bring this letter to the attention of
Secretary Alger and ask him if there
is any objection to our appointing a
Red Cross representative to report to
the commanding officer and the chief
surgeon in every camp; confer with
them as to their immediate needs and
if anything of any kind is wanting
open there a Red Cross station and
send supplies? We can do this, not in
a few weeks or in a few days, but In a
few hours, and caji furnish any quan
tity of any desired luxury or delicacy
for hospital use. We hereby tender our
selves and put our organization at the
War Department's service for co-ODer
ation in this field."
Secretary Alger has approved of the
propositions, and the surgeons have
been directed to co-operate with the
authorized agents of the association for
the purpose indicated.
TEMERARIO ORDERED
TO LEAVE ASUNCION
Befusing to Disarm the Gunboat, the
Commander Is Told to
Depart.
BUENOS AYRES, June 11.â The Gov
ernment of Paraguay, acting upon the
representations of the United States
Consul at Montevideo, notified the com
mander of the Spanish torpedo gunboat
Temerario, now at Asuncion, that he
must disarm that vessel if he desired
to remajn in port.
The Spanish commander refused to
do so, and thereupon he was informed
that the Temerario must leave Asun
cion as soon as the repairs to her ma
chinery are completed which must be
quickly done.
There Is No Friction.
WASHINGTON, June 11.â The re

roads between Guanyea and San Juan,
as, indeed, everywhere in Porto Rico,
are excellent and troops with supplies
could be moved through the inland
readily; but I would not advise expos
ing men to the sun on long marches.
This, in spite of the fact that the cli
mate of Porto Rico is the healthiest in
the world. The rainy season does not
begin until August and is of short du
ration. Yellow fever is almost un
known. Our men, however, are not
used to the hot weather and would wilt
under it.
"San Juan is where the troops should
be landed. The American fleet should
finish the work that Admiral Sampson
started last month aiid batter down
Morro and Fort San CarK.s. The forts
are not at all impregnable; we can de
stroy them at some expense, but, judg
ing from the previous bombardment,
without loss of life. Then, the troops
can be landed to defeat the Spanish
soldiers and take possession of the city.
The occupation of San Juan would end
the war in Porto Rico, for the Span
lards could not make a stand anywhere
else.
"I do not under estimate the strength
of the forts. New batteries have been
constructed; new and modern guns
mounted and the force of 8000 Spanish
regular soldiers has been doubled. The
3000 volunteers are valueless. There are
garrisons at Ponce and other towns,
but the great mass of troops are at
San Juan.
"After the fleet has silenced the forts
the harbor may be counter-mined and
cleared of obstructions, transports
taken and troops landed. As the in
habitants of Porto Rico are thoroughly
disaffected American troops would not
be required to subdue the country; the
people generally would welcome our
soldiers. Porto Rico has not been
ravaged by a war. Horses, cattle and all
food supplies are abundant and al
though there is no railroad system the
first-class carriage roads render com
munication with all parts of the island
easy. It would be a pity to destroy
San Juan, which is a fine town with
nicely paved streets, wider than those
of old Havana, Steps were recently
taken to bring in good water. Our
Foldiers could obtain good water in all
parts of the Island and there is no
swamp land as 1 Cuba.
"The cheapest, quickest and most hu
mane way of conquering Porto Rico is
by the use of the big guns of our fleet.
A land siege of San Juan would be
slow and expensive both in the matter
of men and money."
THIRD EXAMINATION
OF THE CENTENNIAL
Owners Will Have Another Chance to
Show the Condition of
the Vessel.
WASHINGTON, June 11.â The War
"Department has acceded to the request
of the owner of the steamer Centennial,
now on the Pacific Coast, that another
examination shall be made of her. The
next examination will be made by a
board composed of Rear Admiral Kirk
land, named by the Secretary of the
Navy at the request of Assistant Sec
retary Meiklejohn; a representative of
the owners, and a third person to be
selected by these two. This will be the
third examination made of the vessel
and the decision of the committee will
determine finally, so far as the War
Department is concerned, the question
whether she will be taken as a trans
port or not.

HOSTILITY
IS OPENLY
MAINTAINED
Press of Germany Harps
Upon "Another Defeat
of the Yankees."
The Attempts of Spain to Secure
European Intervention Con
tinue to Be Without Avail.
BERLIN, June 11.â There Is no ma- I
terlal change in the feeling In Germany
in regard to the war between Spain and
the United States. The Government
Ecrupuloualy avoids expressing its
views on the subject and a few of the
German newspapers persist in their at
titude of little short of open hostility
toward the United States. Throughout
the week they have vehemently main
tained that the occurrences at Santiago
amounted to "another defeat of the
Yankees." and have gleefully printed
the lying Madrid dispatches supporting
this contention. These newspapers also
continue to charge the Americans with
cowardice for not attacking the Span
lards "whom until recently the Ameri- '
cans regarded as foes unworthy of their I
steel."
A member of the general staff here,
in an interview with the correspondent
of the Associate 1 Press said: "It is
hard for a trained soldier of the Eu
ropean mold to suppress a sentiment
akin to contempt -when reading the ac
counts of what has thus far been done,
or rather, left undone, by the American
army against the Spanish troops in
Cuba. With no Spanish fleet to worry
them, money and transportation in
abundance, all the men needed at their
command, they have been unable thus
far to even effect a landing of troops.
This fact speaks for itself. And after
the enormous boasting of the American
press and people, who systematically
belittled the Spaniards for months be
fore the outbn-iik. of hostilities, this in
glorious failure is doubly conspicuous,
and if striking proof of the great su
periority of the European system of
standing armies was needed the Ameri
cans have furnished it."
The foregoing sentiments are appar
ently shared by all the German military'
men.
The attempts of Spain to secure Eu
ropean intervention continue, in spite
of the little encouragement held oÂ»ut by
the Cabinets approached. Count de
Villagonzalie, the Spanish Embassador
at St. Petersburg, is now acting in con
cert with his colleague in Paris, Senor
Lton y Castillo, in an effort to obtain
the services of Russia and France,
either immediately or in the near fu
ture. The German Foreign Office is
cognizant of the negotiations, but at
taches no importance to them. A high
official of the Foreign Office positively
assures the correspondent that neither
France nor Russia intends to intervene
at the present juncture.
The feasibility and probability of an
Anglo-American alliance or under
standing is attracting widespread at
tention in the German press, though
the idea is universally scoffed at as
impracticable. The papers here profess
not to believe in the possibility of such
an entente and point out an array of
alleged facts showing why the inter
ests of the two nations cannot travel in
parallel lines, declaring that Great
Britain's anxiety for an alliance is due
to fear, engendered by her present iso
lation. The Cologne Gazette ridicules
the idea and claims if an alliance were
consummated Great Britain would se
cure the advantages and America all
the disadvantages.
The FrankfoTt Zeitung is almost
alone in approving the project. The
Foreign Office does not take the mat
ter seriously.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VALLEJO, June 11. â Mechanics
â¢â¢warm about the collier Nero, formerly
the Whitgift, which is now In the dry
dock at Mare Island. Painters have
given her a coating of war paint, and
her hull hits been thoroughly cleaned
below the water line to permit two
coatings of anti-fouling paint to be put
on. Shipwrights have put in new
chocks and towing bitts and are pre
paring the mounts for two rapid-fire
guns on the forecastle deck. Her en
gine and boilers are in first-class con
dition and need little, if any, attention.
The vessel now fliea the American
flag. Boatswain Francis A. Dran Is in
temporary charge until officers are de
tailed to her. She will leave the dock
in a few days and be ready to start
about Wednesday. It is not proposed to
coal her at Mare Island, but the cargo
will be placed on board at San Fran
cisco, where it can be loaded . from
bunkers at the rate of 1000 tons a day.
The Monadnock will be ready before
the Nero, and there is no doubt that
she will reach Manila ahead of the
Monterey. She will take her coal from
the British ship Raham, now lying in
the stream here.
The rush on the Philadelphia con
tinues, and she will be ready for sea
in a very short time, though officials
will not give any information as to
when she will go into commission. She
lively recently. The statements made
by the Minister of the Interior, Count
Posadowsky-Wehner, on Tuesday last,
in response to a request for an outline
of the official views of the tactics
which should be followed at the coming
elections have caused a sensation
everywhere.
The comments, naturally, vary, as oc
cording to the predictions of the pa
pers. Prince Bismarck's organ, the
Hamburger Nachrichten, and others,
declare Count Posadowsky-Wehner did
not go far enough, and they assert that
what is wanted is special anti-socialist
legislation. The National Zeitung
thinks the Minister in his remarks
ought to have included a declaration
against the excessive demands of the
Agrarians and the Tageblatt and other
Liberal papers express similar views.
The semi-official North German Ga
zette has been unable to conceal its
anxiety lest the statements of Count
Posadowsky-Wehner be interpreted as
a one-sided declaration in favor of the
agriculturalists and middle classes. As
a matter of fact, the only parties thus
far active In the pending elections are
the socialists and Agrarians. The Gov
ernment, while not openly participat
ing, clearly sides with the Agrarians.
A number of cases are reported where
local Government officials have been
strongly pressing the rural voters to
support the Agrarians.
The fact that a bill has been prepared
to curtail the franchise in order to pre
vent an increase in the number of so
cialist representations which is fully
corroborated, is having increasing In
fluence in the campaign.
There has been a split among the
Centrists during the week. The Cen
trists of Westphalia have cut loose
from the party, owing to the latter's
lukewarm support of the Agrarian
Democrats and they have nominated
their own candidates. The Centrists
have also lost a number of districts in
Bavaria through the Independent Agra
rian movement among the Catholics.
The Government proposes to ask the
new Reichstag to increase the credits
of the reorganization of the army and
additions to the field artillery, includ
ing the creation of mortar batteries
and the addition of a corps of mounted
infantry to every army corps, an In
crease of the pioneer regiments by a
battalion each and the formation of
three new army corps.
The fact that the United States Gov
ernment is not participating In thÂ«
Brussels sugar conference is regarded
unfavorably here.
Fifty persons have been made sick by
trichinosis this week in the neighbor
hood of Zewlckau, Saxony, and It Is as
serted that American pork was respon
sible for it-
It is said at St. Petrsburg that Mr.
Cornelius Vanderbilt, fearing capture
by the Spaniards, is to leave his yacht
at Odessa until peace is declared.
A great deal of political Importance
is attached to Emperor William's visit
to Palestine. It is suggested that be
sides ending the pretensions of France
to the right to grant protection to all
Christians in the East, may result in
securing Asia Minor as a field for Ger
man colonization, by the conclusion of
a state treaty with Turkey. It is
pointed out that the Sultan will find
difficulty in refusing such a proposal
from Emperor William, especially as it
is a fact that the Germans are already
invading Asia Minor, as well an Pales
tine, systematically and successfully.

composed of scrap iron, sand and Port
land cement, put aboard. This will
form an immovable ballast and will
greatly improve the stability of the
ship.
The Philadelphia's main battery Is
lying on the dock, ready to* be put
aboard when she replaces the Nero in
the dock. Some of the six-Inch guns
belong to the Yorktown, as the Phila
delphia's six-inch rlfleu were sent to
Washington before the war to be con
verted into rapid-firing guns, and they
have not been completed.
Six hundred men worked until 10
o'clock to-night, and will work to-mor
row to complete the Nero and the
Monadnock as soon as possible.
PROPOSED BOND ISSUE.
An Effort Will Be Made to Bar Out
Corporations.
WASHINGTON', June 11.â Assistant
Secretary Vanderlip, who has had per
sonal charge of the details of the pro
posed bond Issue, said to-day:
"The subscription of $200,000,000 of the
3 per cent bonds just authorized by Con
gress will be opened by the Treasury De
partment as soon as the bill is signed by
the President, and will cloÃe at 3 p. m.
July 14. This gives ample time even for
the most remote sections of the country
to receive complete Information regarding
the details of the issue and to have sub
scriptions from such points reach the
treasury. Every channel will be used to
disseminate in the widest possible manner
information regarding this issue and to
make It in every sense a successful pop
ular loan. A great number of subscrip
tions have been received in advance of
the passage of the act, and there Is every
reason to believe that the issue will be
largely oversubscribed. By the terms of
the law, the allotment will bo peculiar.
The law provides that the smallest sub
scriptions shall be first allotted, and the
allotments be made inversely, in accord
ance with those of the subscriptions.
That will result In a line being sharply
drawn at some point, and all subscrip
tions for an amount exceeding that sum
will receive no allotment whatever.
"The precaution is taken to prevent In
dividuals repeating subscriptions, and
thus getting an undue advantage. The
law provides that all individual subscrip
tions must be allotted first, and, there
fore, subscriptions from corporations
and associations other than individuals
will only receive an allotment in the event
that the Individual subscriptions fall short
of the two hundred million dollars which
is at present offered.
"The treasury will print about four mil
lion subscription blanks and circulars of
information. These will be put in the
hands of every money order postmaster
and in every banking office and express
office at the earliest possible moment."

CHIOKAMAUGA NATIONAL MILI
TARY PARK, June 11.â The event of
to-day at Chickamauga was the execu
tion of General Fred Grant's battle
problem, which comprises a number of
new and difficult maneuvers, and was
watched with great interest by officers
and men. The maneuvers were all well
carried out according to General Grant's
excellently conceived plan, and the fact
was demonstrated that many of them
would be very useful in actual conflict.
The battle began at 7 o'clock and was
concluded before noon.
There were two columns in the for
mation. The first, consisting of the |
First Vermont, the Third Tennessee and j
the Eighth New York regiments, was i
commanded by Colonel Clark of Ver- }
mont, and was formed along the Vine
yard road. The second column, consist
ing of the Fourteenth New York, Sec
ond Nebraska and First Missouri, under
command of Colonel Charles J. Bills of
Nebraska, formed on the Ford road.
On the first hill the two columns met,
when the struggle was begun in earn- I
est. When this was finished General j
Grant threw the two columns together j
to ward off a supposed attack from |
come direction of which he was sup
posed to have knowledge in advance.
General Grant was highly pleased
with the way in which the maneuvers
were executed as were also General
Brooke and all the other officers pres
ent.
Governor Hastings and staff of Penn
sylvania spent the day witnessing the
sham battle, inspecting the Pennsyl- \
vania troops and driving over the field. I
The First Kentucky Infantry, 1300 of
ficers and men, under Colonel John B.
Castleman, arrived this morning. The
number of Kentucky men on the field i
is 3000.
The driveways through the park are
being cut to pieces by thousands of
wagons. The Park Commissioners will
probably put a large force at work on
the roads during the next few days.
A number of recruiting officers left
for home States this morning. Under
the late recruiting order the full com
plement for a company of infantry is
106 men; for a troop of cavalry, 100
men; for a battery of light artillery,
173 men; for a battery of heavy artil
lery, 200 men.
The health of the camp continues to
be good and the authorities are en
couraged to believe that there will be
very little serious sickness. There are
still a large number of regiments par
tially or totally lacking uniforms.
ST. JOSEPH. Mo., June 11.â The first
of the four special trains bearing the
First Tennessee Volunteers en route to

long enough to procure refreshments
and the last train left over the Bur

DENVER, June 11.â Orders have been
received at army headquarters for the
dispatch of the Nevada troop of rough
riders, now at Cheyenne, to San
Francisco, and Colonel Atwood, chief
quartermaster of the department, has
asked for bids from the railroads for
the transportation. This order is taken
as indicating that the entire regiment
is to be sent to the Philippines. The
regiment is not yet fully equipped and
provided with horses, but the several
troops will be forwarded as fast as
they are ready.
CHICAGO, June 11.â Andrew Came- j
gle has sent the following communica
tion to the Scottish Highlanders of Illi
nois in answer to their request asking ]
him to equip a regiment of Highlanders I
for service in the war with Spain, the
regiment to be uniformed in Highland
fashion at the expense of Mr. Carnegie
and to bear his name:
"LANGHAM HOTEL. LONDON, May
80. â I do not believe that the war will
last long, or ever reach the dignity of a
real war. You will see Spain go all
to pieces; much sooner than you could
get the historical Highland garb pro
vided for the regiment proposed. If th*
country were seriously threatened and!
needed stalwart men who could b<Â»
trusted to carry any position they were
ordered upon, then I should consider
the matter. Meanwhile I believe I am
hnnnred by the suggestion that a body
j of my countrymen from the center of
triumphant democracy should think of
connecting my name with this regi
ment. ANDREW CARNEGIE."
An effort will be made to organize
the regiment if prospects point to a
continuance of the war.

CRUISER ALFONSO XIII
A FLOATING COFFIN.
Copyrighted, 1898, br JÂ«neÂ» Gordon Bennett.
LONDON, June 1 1. â Captain Aunon has stated
he would not leave Cadiz until the reserve fleet
started and that he would remain aboard the flagship
Pelayo until out of sight of land. It appears the
cruiser Alfonso XIII is not serviceable, being so de
fective that she has been nicknamed the navy "Sar
cofago Ambulante" (floating coffin). The condition of
the Pelayo is very dubious.
GIBRALTAR, June n.â Captain Aunon, Minis

Dissension in Ranks of
Social Democracy.
COLONIZATION AND A SPLIT.
VOTE AGAINST POLITICAL AC
TION CAUSES A DEFECTION.
Platform of the New Organization
Declares for a Vigorous Use of
the Ballot to Remedy
Labor Troubles.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, June 11.â The Social Dem
ocracy, in convention in this city, de
cided by a vote of 52 to 36 in favor of
the colonization scheme, for which pur
pose it was organized, and against the
plan of political action proposed by
Eugene V. Debs. Prior to taking the
vote there was a warm debate, lasting
from early last evening until 2:30
o'clock this morning.
The result of the balloting was an
nounced amid the utmost enthusiasm,
which was bo overwhelming that the
advocates of the political action pro
gramme very gracefully acknowledged
themselves beaten.
As a result of this action there was
a defection of a large number of the
Debs faction, who formed a new or
ganization. Jesse Cox Is temporary
chairman of the new party, William
Maille secretary, and the â¢ executive
committee is composed of Eugene V.
Debs. Seymour Stedman, Victor Berger,
Jesse Cox and Fred Heath. A. S. Ed
wards is made national organizer, and
the national headquarters will be es
tablished somewhere outside of Chi-
cago.
The platform of the new party de
clares for vigorous use of the ballot to
remedy all labor troubles, public own
ership of all monopolies, railroads, tele
graph lines, mines, Introduction of the
initiative and referendum, abolition of
war, women's rights, nationalization of
farm mortgages, the improvement of
farm lands by use of national credit
and uniform postal rate for transpor
tation of grain.
The main body of the social Democ
racy continued its sessions in Uhlrich's
Hall this afternoon. On account of the
many vacant seats, caused by the se
ceding of the Debs faction, the read^
ing of the reports of officers and audit
ing committee was deferred until some
future time. The plan of the coloniza
tion commission to establish at once a
mining colony at Green Mountain Falls,
Colo., was adopted.
The following were then selected as
members of the executive council:
John F. Lloyd, James Hogan, I. Frank,
J. C. Hlnton. L. Goodwin, L. L. Hop
kins, J. Borlund. C. F. Willard and C.
G. Clemens. The choice of a chairman
was left to the council.
Most of the delegates left for their
homes to-night.

city for the alienation of her husband's
affections. She has brought suit against
Addie B Bell of Buffalo, formerly of
Rochester, for this amount.
Mrs. Craig is the wife of Henry H.
Craig, who was for many years a lum
ber dealer in this city and is a million
aire. He is about 56 years old. The
Craig family consists of a married
daughter, living In New York; a
younger daughter in this city, and two
sons here.
About six years ago Mrs. Bell was
divorced from her husband, Craig be
ing one of the co-respondents in the
action. Since that divorce, Mrs. Craig
declares, her husband has spent a great
deal of his time with Mrs. Bell at her
home in Buffalo and he has given her
sums of money amounting to $60,000.
Besides the allenation-of-affections
suit Mrs. Craig brings another for the
purpose of restraining her husband
from squandering his fortune and asks
that a commission be appointed. Mr.
Craig went West in company with Mrs.
Bell several months ago and stopped
in Fargo, N. D., for the purpose, it is
alleged, of getting a divorce and finally
went on to Salt Lake and then to San
Francisco, where Mrs. Bell was intro
duced as Mr. Craig's daughter. The
two became separated in a crowd and
stories of Craig's disappearance were
scattered broadcast.
In her complaint Mrs. Craig alleges
that during and between the years ISB2
and 1898 Mrs. Bell enticed her husband
away from plaintiff and induced him to
give her large sums of money and much
valuable property. She charges that
the defendant and Mr. Craig, about
March 1. left this State for California
so that Craig could obtain a divorce and
then marry the defendant.

FIGHT ON MOUNT TAMALPAIS.
BOBBER RECEIVES A SEVERE
DRUBBING.
Proprietor Cowley of the Summit
Tavern Wins a Desperate Fight
and Saves His
Gold.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
MILL VALLEY, June 11.â A bold at
tempt at highway robbery occurred
near here last evening. Fred Cowley,
proprietor of the tavern at the sum
mit of Mount Tamalpais, was the in
tended victim. That the attempt was
unsuccessful was due entirely to Cow
ley's bravery and quick action.
He had been in town during the even
ing and about 8 o'clock started for
home. When about half a mile out of
town on the trail leading to the sum
mit, and in the vicinity of an old mill,
near the cascades, he rounded the
bend and was suddenly confronted by
a masked man, who stepped out from
behind a tree, and, presenting a re
volver at Cowley's head, ordered him
to hold up his hands.
Comprehending the situation quickly,
Cowley glanced around and perceived
a large stick lying on the ground. He
made a quick movement and managed

to drop his hat. Stooping as if to pick
the hat up, he instead grasped the club
and brought it down with all his might
on the robber's head. The blow struck
the man on the head and arm, knock
ing the revolver from his hand and
leaving him disarmed.
Cowley proceeded to use the club
with vigorous effect. The robber en
deavored to grapple with him to ward
off the blows. The fellow managed
finally to get hold of Cowley and a
terrific hand to hand struggle ensued.
Cowley tripped the. robber and threw
him to the ground, but the fellow
arose before he could jump upon him.
The robber finally lost heart at the
vigorous defense made by his intend
ed victim. "With the blood from the
wounds on his forehead streaming into
his eyes, he was hardly able to carry
on the combat. He turned and fled
as fast as his heels could carry him.
Cowley pursued him a short distance,
but was tired from his struggle and
gave up the chase.
At the time of the attempt Cowley
had upon his person a large Bum of
money and numerous valuables. It is
probable the would-be robber was ac
quainted with this fact.
The proper authorities have been not
ified of the attempted robbery, but have
as yet no definite clew upon which to
work.

BY CUSTOMS AUTHORITIES.
A Small River Steamer and Eighty
Tons of Coal Will Have to Be
Unloaded Before She Can
Depart.
The all-water route to Dawson may now
be said to be fairly open. Sailing vessels
and etern-wheel steamers have left for

opening of the Yukon and various other
Kind of craft built at DÂ»iich Harbor dur
ing the spring have come out of retire
ment- The first of the regular steamers
pnt away yesterday, and from now on
tk^re will not be a day pass without one
or more vessels starting out for the gold
:ields.
The Alaska Commercial Company's new |
steamer St. Paul was the first to get !
away yesterday. About one hundred j
miners who are going to try their lu.-k on
the Yukon went up on her. and all of
them wert> in the best of spirits as th.>
: steamed away. Louis Slo^s Jr.
went up on the St. Paul and will Inspect
the company's stations on the river be
tore coming home. Captain Erskint-. the
.nown pilot. Is also making a pleas
ure trip on the steamer.
The Alaska Exploration Company's :
steamer Leelanaw got away about 3 p. m.
id a big load of freight for the com
pany'a stores, but she only took away
about sixty passengers. The company's
iera and barges were all built 1
at Dutch Harbor and will be at St. Mi
chael to connect with the Leelanaw on
her arrival. The men who went up on '
the Slntram to put the river steamers j
an<3| bargee together will probably come !
back home on the steamer.
The Tillamook with the stern wheel ;
steamer Ridrout in tow was to have :
sailed early in the afternoon for St. ;
Michael, but she was stopped by the ,
Custom-house authorities. It was de
cided after an inspection that the vessel
was overloaded. an>l the captain and
owners were ordered to remove a small
river boat and S3 tons of coal from the
before the vessel would be allowed :
to seiu Something else will have to
be put off instead of t.ie coal, as it will be
required to replenish the steamer's bunk
ers before she can reach St. Michael.
The steamer Ohio arrived from Seattle
yesterday, and the Indiana Is expected to
day. As soon as their cargoes of coal ,
have been discharged and the vessels
overhauled they will be turned Into trans- i
ports to carry soldiers to Manila.
Captain Kempf and Messrs. "U'inshlp
and Ransome, from the navy yard, sub- i
jected the discarded steamer Centennial
to another Inspection yesterday. Their
report will be made direct to the authori
ties at Washington, and the acceptance
or rejection of the steamer will again
come under consideration.
The crew of the steamer Oregon did
quick work since her arrival. She !
! from Portland last Friday morn- j
,1 they discharged and loaded her'

for the CoUimbia River. Pretty quick
work, considering that she had to be

ANOTHER INDUSTRY
RAISES A PROTEST
THE NEW TARIFF WILL KILL
TARTAR-MAKING.
Thousands Recently Invested in Big
Refineries â A Letter to Senator
George C. Perkins.
The reciprocity treaty that President
McKlnley recently signed wTiereby France
Is to receive certain concessions and prlvl- i
with regard to the duties on her '
tfl is working great injury' to many \
tries of this State, judging by the
Lints madr- by many of the Western '
trers. As has been shown in j
:n;ns. the wine men have raised â 
rotest against the clause in the i
relative to wine, claiming that If j
i^rmitted to go into operation It
means of ruining the win* In
â  ustry of the entire State. A memorial ''
to this effect has been sent to the Pacific
â  delegates in Washington and to the
President himself, coupled with the re- i
quest that the clause complained of at i
be amended.
Another industry has come to the front !
with a protest, Its representatives assert- j
Ing that they will be ruined if the treaty 'â 
is allowed to go into operation. The in- '
dustry la the manufacture of tartar one I '
of the principal components of the many i '
baking powders used in the making of j '
bread. It Is comparatively new to this ' i
coast, but in the short time it has been ,
found to be profitable considerable capital ,
has been Invested therein. The materials '
used come from the product of the win- i '
criesâ refuse that cannot be used by the '
grape growers even as fertilizing mate- | i
rial. The importance of this new Industry ,
may be Judged from a letter that one of ,
those deeply Interested sent to Senator
Perkins. It is only one of several that '
are to be sent, which have been placed |
â¢in the hands of the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association for its indorsement
and support. It is as follows:
BAN FRANCISCO. June 11, 1898.
' Hon. George C. Perkins, United States Sen- I
ate, Washingtonâ Sir: We were very :
' much dlstreaaed to read in the newspapers of
the proposed reduction ..of the duty on crude
tartar, that la argots and lees. Last fall, en
couraged by the duty placed on this raw ma
terial, we were induced to Invest some $25,000
at Matermore. Fresno County, where we col- j
lected the dregs from the wineries and turned '
them into cash, where formerly It was an ex- '
pense to the wine makers to remove It. We !
keep fifteen to twenty teams employed haul-
Ing this to our factory, besides our regular fac
tory hands, and run a night and day shift.
"It has been demonstrated that crude tartar
can only be manufactured profitably on this i
coast by working on a large scale, the profit
being small, therefore the removal of duty ;
might mean the removal of our profit and
eventually the closing: down of our works.
There are. besides our own, four other prude
cream of tartar factories and a large refinery
In San Francisco, which will equally suffer !
with us and the wine makers of this State.
This is a new Industry in this State, employ-
Ing many men, and It deserves protection now
more than in the future. We may mention that
the Eastern cream of tartar refineries import
their raw material principally from Italy
Spain France and other wine countries of
Europe, sending many thousands of dollars i
abroad which we are trying to keep here.
Another point Is this, that the other countries ,
would ship through France to evade the higher ,
rate of duty. With the neoessary protection
thin industry can be further developed and
msdÂ«! one of the prominent Industries of the
St We hope that you will be able to assist us in
this matter, which will guarantee to us suc
cess to our enterprise and benefit those whom
we employ and the wine makers whose material
we buy Any additional information you may
desire will be gladly furnished. Yours very
respectfully. . R. ROMER.
The letter Is signed by R. Romer. the j
manager of the Fresno Tartar Works.
Several letters of similar import are In the i
hands of Manager Lewis of the Manu- I
facturers' and Producers' Association, and i
to-morrow he will bring them before the
association for indorsement, for Senator
Perkins quickly attends to any recommen
dation coming from this body. As nearly
all those who are making the protest are i
members of the association, there is no
doubt that their complaint will receive
immediate attention.^ -. :

THE BOND ISSUE.
A DEMOCRATIC free silver morning contem
porary, which never neglects an opportunity
to attract attention to itself by interfering in
public affairs which do not concern it, has opened a
subscription book for the forthcoming Government
bond issue. This sheet says it desires to see the war
bonds thoroughly distributed among the people of the
United States and stoutly opposes their purchase by
the bloated bondholders. It, therefore, calls upon the
people to visit its office and put their names down
for a subscription. Anything above $25 will be ac
cepted.
"They (the bonds) offer the safest investment for
the savings of the people," says this yellow financier.
"There was never a default on the part of Uncle Sam.
Banks may break, but the Government goes on for
ever and pays its debts whatever happens. The inter
est is 3 per cent, and it is certain."
It is a little over a year since this same journal was
clamoring to have the Government bonds already out
standing paid in silver, worth in the bullion market
less than 50 cents on the dollar. At that time it de
manded the free coinage of silver and declared that
the Government had never agreed to pay any of its
bonds, except the two last issues under Cleveland, in
gold. It did not maintain that silver was worth as
much as gold, but it has an interest in several silver
mine*, and it thought if the free coinage of the metal
could be forced value would be added to its mines
and it could afford to burn up a few more papers and
thus increase its circulation.
We presume that the subscription this yellow
blatherskite has now started will be a gold subscrip
tion. Does it propose to accept subscriptions in sil
ver? If it does, and the Government will take silver,
perhaps it may on the surface of things make out a
case for itself, although the silver will be taken on a
gold basis. But if the transactions which it now pro
poses to close on behalf of its clients are to be con
ducted in gold, what guarantee have we that after the
war is over it will not again demand the free coinage
of silver and the return of the money of the people
In fifty cent dollars?
These questions are important and should be an
swered in advance. If the yellow financier's scheme is
a bunko game the poor people who are asked to pa
tronize h should know it They are requested to sub
scribe for the bonds in gold; will the bonds be re
paid in gold? If not, then the scheme is a swindle
and the bloated capitalists should be allowed to take
the bonds.
Among the reasons for not thinking that China
has sold ships to Spain for gold are the circumstances
that China has no ships and Spain no gold. Besides
this, if the nations in question were bountifully sup
plied with the essential elements for a dicker of this
sort, the transaction would not be permitted. Let's
worry about something else.
There is no reason for believing that Blanco will
pve up Havana upon the simple request of this coun
try. The man is a tremendous liar, but even if also
a coward, something there is no ground for suppos
ing, he might as well fight as go back to Spain and
be executed. â¢
Naturally people are prejudiced against the Cen
tennial. A ship that is sold for such a sum that one
month's service for the Government will pay for her
is not a first-rater, unless the buyer happened to get
an unparalleled bargain.
The way things look at Manila now, the gentlemen
who are anxious to get the head of the insurgent
leader and sell the same for $25,000 would find it
money in their pockets to leave that head right where
it is.
There is an unkind intimation that Bryan is to be
sent to the front much in the spirit that David of old
once dispatched a gentleman to a point where the
scrapping was to be hot.
The fact that Linares and Blanco unite in declaring
that no Spanish torpedo boat has been sunk is the
first tangible evidence that this is exactly what hap
pened to it.
One of the islands on which the United States have
designs is Yap. Having secured it, an excellent plan
would be to make of it a refuge for yellow journalists.
If Spain is really anxious to settle this little affair
by an appeal to some power she can do so. There's
the United States, for instance.
When an item of news is headed "From Spanish
Sources," there is no particular reason for reading it
unless one desires to kill time.
In organizing a new Cabinet Spain would be going
to unnecessary trouble. It could do nothing more
than fall.
Never until the present war did the cutting of a
cable fail to have the effect of delaying messages.
THE MEN WHO DO THE FIGHTING.
VICTORIES in war are associated with the names
of commanders. The great admiral is the sea
fighter who can handle his ships and fight them
to the best advantage and with the least confusion.
The great general is the man who can handle the
most men in battle and so fight them that he gets the
best out of every man in his formations. But neither
admiral nor general can win without fidelity and cour
age and pride in the men whom he mo\es as parts of
a machine.
It is a common error of civilians to believe that men
in the ranks fight from motives of revenge. It is
civilians and historians who laud such battle-cries as
"Remember the Alamo" and "Remember the Maine."
The fighting sailor and soldier has in mind the honor
of his corps, his command, his country. "England
expects every man to do his duty" was a more thrill
ing call to "Tommy Atkins" than any appeal to preju
dice or revenge. "Don't give up the ship," uttered by
the dying Lawrence, is the sentiment that inspires
every man-of-war's-man under Dewey, Sampson and
Schley. These unnamed heroes, unknown to their
countrymen by name except when they fall fighting,
are the dependence of their country. We know them
only when â
"Their hearts can feel no more
The rapture of the fight."
They are the men who held back their shots when
the Spanish admiral, Montijo, driven from his own
ship as she roasted in the flames, carried his flag to
another deck in an open boat within range of their
guns. He was a brother fighter, made of their stuff,
and in admiration of his courage, common with theirs,
they refused the advantage and gave him his life. They
are of the same stuff as Cervera, who, in circumstances
illustrating a common heroism, took aboard Hobson
and his men after the sinking of the Merrimac to his
undoing and sent out of the hot battle in which they
had corked him to their commander his compliments
upon their courage in executing a feat that will gild
the story of devotion to the end of time.
These men in the ranks in our army and navy are
the concrete of our national character, the expression
of its fighting quality, its admiration of courage, its
chivalry to the enemy and its steadfast resolve that
their flag must win, its arms must triumph. Among
them revenge has little place. Their motives are not
rooted in passion. They fight, not like the beasts
that perish, but for a principle, for a country, for the
homes they have left and the flag that leails them on.
In their exaltation of spirit they do daring things.
Life is precious to them only because it is theirs to
give up that their country may not die. Their im
mortality is its permanence, and their blood ce
ments the stones of its foundation that it may never
fail nor fall.
Perhaps but few of them could tell, as philosophers
might, that all government rests finally upon force,
and that force must come in the tearless eye and tire
less arm of fighting men. But they know instinctively
that lacking such men, government, its orders and its
institutions, cannot be in the world. So they are the
patient source of it all. They make possible the free
dom of person and the rights of property, which are
the pri7es man ha? gained through civilization. Their
measured march and the music of their cruns shake the
earth and make whirlwinds in the air to proclaim the
permanence of government and the perpetuation of
civilization.
When we read of victories won and the principles
they establish, let us not forget the men in the ranks
by whose valor these things come.
OUR INTERESTS IN CHINA.
REPORTS recently made to the British Foreign
Office on the commercial dealings of various
nations with China are of considerable interest
to us, inasmuch as they show that our trade with the
country' is in excess of that of either Germany or Rus
sia, is second only to that of Great Britain, and
amounts in the aggregate to upward of one-seventh
of the entire foreign trade of the Chinese empire.
According to the statistics included in the reports
which have been given out, our principal trade with
the Chinese is in cotton goods. It is said that last
year the China trade took from the United States up
ward of $7,480,000 worth of cotton goods, or almost
half of all the American cotton goods shipped abroad.
It is noted that the Chinese as a rule, and particularly
those of Manchuria, prefer American drills and sheet
ings to similar articles of European make, because
they are heavier and of better texture. The expert of
American kerosene oil ranks second in importance to
that of cotton goods. In 1806 China took 33,000,000
gallons of American oil and 28,000,000 gallons of Rus
sian oil, so that in this trade also we lead our Russian
rivals in the Chinese market.
For some years past our trade with China has been
rapidly advancing, and the variety as well as the
quantity of our exports to that country has increased.
We have now a considerable market there for wheat,
canned goods and for manufactured articles of all
kinds, and recently there has been a large demand for
iron and steel and railroad materials. The importance
of this trade is fully appreciated in higher commercial
circles, and earnest efforts are now being made to se
cure what we have and provide for its extension.
Under conditions now prevailing there can be no
question but what the industrial and civilizing move
ment now begun in China would bring about a very
largely increased trade with this country in the
course of a comparatively few years, from which
large benefits would accrue to California and the
whole Pacific Coast. The only cloud upon the pros
pect of such an increase is that caused by the advance
of Russia toward domination in China, which would
mean of course the closing of the markets to our
produce so far as ft competed with that of the Rus
sians themselves.
The United States have taken no part in the game
.now being played by English, French, German and
Russians for advantage in the Orient, and yet as these
statistics show our commercial interests there are su
perior to those of any nation except Great Britain.
Moreover we are gaining upon Great Britain, and a
few years more of uninterrupted development would
undoubtedly give us the first place in the Chinese
markets.
With the enactment of wise legislation to promote
American shipping we would in a short time have a
trade with the Orient which would put San Francisco
into the front rank of commercial cities. It behooves
us. therefore, to guard those interests with wise fore
sight and due energy. We need take no part in the
l?nd grabbing now going on along the Chinese coast,
but we should see to it that our commercial rights
there are not sacrificed to European aggression.
Soldiers who had their clothing burned while on
the way out here may comfort themselves by the re
flection that some of the regiments had reached this
city before they got enough clothes to start a blaze
with.
The Monterey could doubtless take care of herself
in any kind of a fight, but her decks are not adapted
to the carriage of coal.
THE SAIST FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 12, 1898.
THE APPROACHING CAMPAIGN.
PERPLEXED by the confusion in their camp
and divided one against another by bitter jeal
ousies, the Democratic leaders are none the less
vigorous and energetic in their preparations for the
campaign. The very dissensions among them prompt
to this activity, for it is clear that in the Democratic
race this year the maxim, "Devil take the hindmost,"
will be fulfilled to the letter.
One "needs go fast when the devil drives" is an
old saying, and every Democratic candidate for office
and every friend of a candidate is going as fast as he
can. Confusion there is and distrust, and men seeking
the scalps of their neighbors, but there are no lag
gards in the camp. The work of arming and organ
izing goes swiftly on.
In all this there is something of danger to the Re
publican party. Sure of the strength of the organiza
tion, confident of the harmony which prevails in the
ranks, and rendered sanguine of success by reason of
the divisions in the camp of the enemy, the Repub
lican leaders seem to be negligent of the contest be
fore them. While the Detnocrats are active the Re
publicans are waiting. In the Democratic camp prep
arations for the State convention are under way, but in
the Republican camp there is hardly any sign of get
ting ready for the coming conflict
The recent convention of Republican League clubs
in this city is about the only evidence that has been
given of the real energy of the party. That the con
vention did much good is beyond question. It
brought together influential Republicans from all sec
tions of the State and had a potent effect in rousing
the ardor of the rank and file. It will lead to an in
crease in the membership of Republican clubs and go
far toward getting the party ready for the coming
contest, but that is not enough. The clubs do not
represent the party organization. They are auxiliaries
and not commanders. They can and will give help,
but they can neither organize nor lead the battle line.
It is time for some show of activity on the part of
the men entrusted with the control of the Republican
organization in the State. This is a good year for the
Republicans, but it is not going to be a "yellow dog"
year. The great victory in Oregon was not won by
chance. The Oregon Republicans entered the field
early, they put up a strong platform and nominated
a strong ticket and made a strong fight. Republicans
in California to achieve a similar succeess must adopt
similar tactics.
The platform of the party is not a subject of dispute.
All are agreed as to what that will be. The danger
point is the State ticket. A blunder in that may result
in defeat along the whole line. Strong and confident
as the party is, it cannot elect any man known or sus
pected to have affiliations binding him either to
bosses or to corrupt corporations and monopolies.
The nominee for Governor must be a man of in
dependent mind and unassailable integrity. He must
represent true Republicanism and stand for the inter
ests of the people and the welfare of the State. Such
a man will be elected by an overwhelming majority,
but the nominee of a boss, or the tool of a corporation
engaged in politics, will be defeated.
Consideration of the party ticket should not be
much if any longer delayed, and in that consideration
every member of the party should share. The nom
inees of the State ticket should be chosen by the party
as a whole. The campaign will soon be near at hand.
Time passes quickly. Activity on the part of Repub- \
lican leaders is necessary to counteract the incessant
work going on among the Democrats.
FIGHTING AGAINST FOLLY.
AN earnest and vigorous effort is being made by
the conservative Democratic leaders of the
East to draw their party out from the slough
of Bryanism and put it on firm ground in time for the
campaign this fall. Over and over again they utter
words of warning against the folly of free silver
finance, and with urgent insistence exhort to wiser
policies and more patriotic courses.
One of the most notable efforts in this direction
was recently made by Senator Gorman in opposing
his Democratic colleagues in the Senate on the pro
posal for the coinage of the silver seigniorage. Among
other things he said to them:
"In my judgment it would be unwise, It would be
fruitless to attempt to force that question to the front
while the country has the Spanish army and navy to
confront. That is a question we ought to fight out
in time of peace. I have always been a partisan. I
have voted for my party even when some of its can
didates did not quite meet my approval. But in a
crisis like this I do not know my party. I know only
the highest interests of my country. Knowing how
sharp is the political division upon this proposition,
I cannot vote for it at this time, no matter how just
it may be in the abstract, or as a proposition stand
ing alone."
The plea of Gorman was in vain. With but few
exceptions the Democratic Senators held to their
course of Bryanism and folly. They put their party
on record as favoring a measure sure to provoke dis
cord and dissensions among the people at a time
when "the country has the Spanish army and navy to
confront." Thus, as Gorman pointed out, they have
entered upon a policy which, even if it were wise in
time of peace, is not only unstatesmanlike, but un
patriotic at this crisis in the affairs of the nation.
Gorman does not stand alone "in his fight against
the fools and fanatics of his party. Great Democratic
papers like the New York Times and the Philadelphia
Record struggle with him against the heavy odds of
partisaa blindness and stupidity. Up to this time,
however, it is to all appearance a hopeless battle. The
followers of Bailey in the House and of Tillman in
the Senate are as besotted as ever in their devotion to
the false gods that led their party to destruction in
1896.
The campaign of this fall will be largely a repeti
tion of that of two years ago. On the one side will
be the great mass of patriotic people going forward
under the Republican administration to new issues of
war and of peace, and on the other side a demoralized
faction of calamity howlers shouting for free silver,
or greenbacks or any old thing that promises cheap
money for the multitude. The result cannot be con
sidered doubtful. In every Congressional district
there will be thousands of conservative Democrats
who will say with Gorman: "In a crisis like this I
do not know my party. I know only the highest in
terests of my country." They will vote for sound
money, for protection and for patriotism.
If the mere flaunting of Captain Evans' linen after
the wash is to be taken as the signal of surrender, the
captain is advised to keep his shirt on.
Spain would be foolish to send relief ships to Cer
vera without holding in reserve a squadron to relieve
the relief.
Unless the fall of Santiago involve the killing of
Butcher Pando it can never be classed as a complete
success.
Hurrah for the American flag flying in Cuba or
anywhere else!

A writer in the Visalia Delta, under
the caption, "Musings," presents many
bright ideas. The advice he sand
wiches among his paragraphs is often
good and always well intended, yet
when he sayÃ "Don't stir up a polecat
with a short stick" he wanders Into
error. The implication is plain that
he thinks the part of wisdom is to use
a long stick in stirring up the animal.
My view of the case is that he would
far better not be stirred up with a stick
of any length.

There was a day when not to be able
to agree with Arthur McEwen was a
disappointment to me, forcing 1 me to
distrust my own judgment. But the
passing of time demonstrated that
whenever McEwen Took a position in
a public matter he was about as sure
to get the wrong side of it as the sun
to rise in the east. Hence, gradually
I learned to disagree from his conclu
sions and suffer no pang. Neither did
he experience any distress, nor were
friendly relations in the least marred,
so no harm was done. Now McEwen
has been attacking McKinley for the
manner in which the war has been con
j ducted. Far from being sorry to take
issue with him in this instance, to do
so is an actual pleasure. No citizen
wants to think the President "a weak
kneed wobbler," which is the assertion
McEwen makes, and which he pro
ceeds with some elaboration not to
j prove. Of course, had the distinguished
i critic been put at the head of military
affairs, armed with a pen and writing
j his orders at regular space rates, the
! Castilian would now have beenhidingin
the caves of his native land, and the
little misunderstanding which per
sists In enduring have been but the
memory of triumph. It seems to me
i that the war has progressed with reas
| onable dispatch, and that the conduct
of it has been such that the enemy has
had to do most of the dying.
There are several ways of looking at
the act of Cervera in notifying Samp
; son that there were American prison
â¢ ers in Morro Castle. I fail to see the
: culpability of the admiral. It seems to
me that the brave Hobson and his as-
Bociates were treated with every cour
tesy. The mission to which they bent
: such splendid energies as to excite the
admiration of the world was not a mis
sion of peace. If we are correctly in
formed, the heroes of the Merrimac
omitted olive branches from their scant
equipment. They freely offered their
lives in the expectation that their er
rand, if successful, would crush the
Spanish fleet. They were observed,
and the Spanish saw them Jump into
the- water. Cannon had been boom-
Ing at the Merrimac, but at sight of
the valiant Americans swimming away
from the fated ship the gunners ceased
their work. They would not fire. As
prisoners of war the Americans were
kindly received. Naturally they had
to be placed in confinement, but no ob
ligation, save that prompted by chiv
alry, was on the admiral to send word
of their safety. He later sent word
that they were in Morro Castle, and
thereat uproar sounded. Supposing he
had put them there and said nothing
about it? But he made their where
abouts known, and so the chance of
their being killed by their friends was
' reduced to a minimum. It does not
seem to me a crime, although not as
, suming to be versed either in the arts
; or ethics of war, I am willing to accept
i proof to the contrary.

In these times there is peculiar re
spect for the veteran of the Civil War
and a tendency to listen to his opin
ion. So the writing of Ambrose Bierce
on military topics has been read and
approved, for he is an old soldier, and
there is no secret that he was a good
one. Personally I had followed hie
work with much interest. But last
Sunday he spoiled the effect of It all.
There had ariren no occasion for in
sulting the women of the Red Cross,
and yet he insulted them. I do not
think there is decency in characterizing
the type as "the lively female of our
species," or decency in sneering at the
work to which they have devoted so
many days. It is true they have con
trived a quantity of bandages which
the sunny Bierce designates as "belly
bands." While the expression lacks re
finement, it is correct. Where the mil
itary expert shows an ignorance at
once surprising and lamentable is in
insinuating that these bandages will be
useless and the making of them a
waste of time, save as amusement for
the "lively female." When the wo
men asked what they could do to assist
in providing for the soldiers going to a
tropic clime they were told by the of
ficers of the army and by the surgeons
to prepare these cholera bandages.
They are doing so, and the soldiers,
having studied the conditions into
which are army Is about to pass, are
grateful. They will wear the band
ages, and if any object, the wearing
will be enforced by superior authority.
Possibly the generals do not know what
they are doing; perhaps the cholera
belt is no more potent than a red string
tied about the neck, and the men of
the English troops in hot countries are
obliged to wear it Just to satisfy
a whim of the Queen. lam inclined,
however, to think that Bierce is In er
ror, because all the army officers and
all the surgeons cannot be fools.

that he went away. When a man gets

I regret to observe that the college
presidents of the land as a rule seem
to be selfishly unpatriotic. It is, how
ever, cheering to note that the stu
dents do not pay any attention to
them, but cheerfully lay down books
and take up guns. President Gates of
lowa College Is the latest to put him
self on record as a cultured dunder
pate. He is at the head of one of the
best of Middle Western institutions.
Borne of the students who were trained
under him are now on their way to Cu
ban waters, and my heart goes with
them, for I knew them as boys and as
babies, or knew their people, or wan
dered over the campus with which In
later years their feet became familiar.
Tet President Gates declares he can
not see how the conscience of the coun
try can ever escape qualms for the
war with Cuba. What Bort of a con
science does he suppose this country
to possess? He must think it a Presi
dent Eliot conscience or one of the Pro
fessor Norton variety. Speaking as a
plain American citizen, to whom the
honor of this land Is dear, I am glad
to tell him that the conscience of the
country Is clear. If there was ever a
holy war waged It is the present one,
which he deprecates. There is no use
of entering into details. When the
mind of a "college president Is made up

would not Jar it. But I hope some of
the boys who went from under the
Gates tuition with a back-handed bless
ing from their chief instructor will see
and understand. If ever I get rich it
shall be my first joy to endow a chair
of patriotism, not for the students, for
they do not need it, but for the college
presidents, who do need such benefits,
and in honor of the old school days I
will present a scholarship to Gates,
hoping to make a better citizen of him.

There are always people eager to
nose out evil conditions which would
seem to the clean-minded to be devoid
of guile, and my first impression was
that the reports in relation to the
morals of Camp Merritt were due to
people of this unpleasingr variety. How
ever, such is not the fact. The camp
has been too open. Where thousands of
men are gathered and the freedom of
their quarters unrestricted, there is
certain to arise a condition far from
desirable. There has been at Camp
Merritt a lack of military discipline,
and the moral effect is appalling. The
most sedate citizen far from home is
apt to lay aside the austerity that
hedged him about there. The only
remedy is to abolish the camp and put
It back in the Presidio, from which it
should never have been removed. On
the Government reservation it would be
possible to exercise powers of exclu
sion which are impracticable in a place
traversed by open streets, which the
public cannot be forbidden to use. I
am not blaming the soldiers. The fault
lies with a lot of harpies, who always

mothers permit them to swarm with all
the latitude of their abandoned com

It Is not often that there is propriety
in calling down a United States Sena
tor, but if Hon. George C. Perkins has

I do no*t correctly interpret the corres

Commerce. The Senator seemed to be
fearful that in the absence of the
Monterey and Monadnock some long,
low, rakish craft would come In, at

State into the hitherward Pacific.
There does not appear any real danger
of such dire mishap. Undoubtedly
when the Senator returns he will find

The Idea that a woman lacks busi

more businese-like than the action of
Mrs. Merry of the Woman's Exchange.
In her .official capacity she collated a

from sources where no grub less aristo
cratic than angel food was supposed to
be recognized. In preparing the recipes
for publication Mrs. Merry deftly in

certain brand of baking powder. Of
course the contributing ladies were dis

powder have doubtless shown signs of
appreciation.
It seems to me that Fred Lawrence
has a grievance. A few months ago he
was in Cuba for Hearst, prancing along
Weyler's trocha, dodging barb-wire and
machetes. Then he was called home
and honored by having his picture i
printed. The other day Doug White
started off to relieve Dewey and take
charge of the Philippines until General
Merritt shall get there. Necessity arose
for printing the picture of White, and
he was so new to fame that in all the
East no such picture existed. So the
Lawrence cut was dusted off, labeled
"D. White" and made to serve the pur
pose. This was distinctly wrong. Sup

to run across the original and, misled
by the bogus label, clap him in jail as

Poor old Ouida! Once the woman
could write. She always had an absurd
habit of making her heroes impossible
deml-gods, crowned invariably with a
shade of tawn-"- hair not known to na
ture. But through her books were
scattered bits of description which for
strength and vividness no other novel
ist of whose works I have had knowl
edge has equaled. In "Under Two
Flags" she sets forth an account of a
horse race which I regard as far ex
celling any other account of a similar
event. It is wonderful in its beauty.
One seems to see "Forest King." to hear
the beat of his hoofs, and feels a thrill
ing impulse to join in the shouts. Wal
lace's chariot race has been widely ex
tolled, but compared with the race of
"Forest King" it is as glass to diamond.
It has always been a puzzle to me why
this radiant gem of words should have
acquired so limited a fame. But Ouida
has all her life been a disagreeable
freak. She has the tamper of a wildcat,
the manners of a cow, and with years
she has grown meaner. Age does not
deck her with silvered dignity, but
comes upon her bringing with it bitter
ness, and turning the natural sour of
her to an actual venom which runs
from the end of her pen in halting
meter. She has taken to making po
etry, jerky verse, punctuated by drops
of gall. Her latest, and let it be hoped
her last, is a parody on the poet laur
eate's joint tribute to England and
America. Evidently this malign an
tique does not view an alliance with
favor, or ascribe the proposal to lofty
motives, for she says:
So fling 'em out on the breeze,
Bluster and Bully and Brag,
And the standard of spangled shoddy
Shall wave o'er a Sea of Swag,
Wherever the Press shall vapor.
And wherever the Purse shall wag.
For wherever we come, we twain,
The machine gun shall benow of Jesus
And the Bible preach gin and gain,
For our creed and gospel's the same.
And If we've made an end of the Redskin
So have you of his Maori kin.

There is a feeling that Spain may

hope it is groundless. Since the United

this to cease before the Spanish shall
have been driven back to their native

session, would be a calamity to the
world. The presence of their flag
should be no longer tolerated over the
colonies they have for centuries mis
ruled. If they were now to Bue for
peace the terms granted would doubt
less be more advantageous. They would
be left with some foothold close to the
civilization of the west, and bÂ« as they

They should be defeated at every point

Editorial mention lately came under
eye that among some of the Orien
s this country is known as the "Land
the Beautiful Flag." The designa
tion is one appealing to the pride and
tenderer sentiment of Americans. For
they know the United States is the land
of the beautiful flag, and they glory in
the stars and stripes. Once, perhaps,
this feeling was beneath the surface,
but not now; not now, when the streets
echo to the tramp of armed men, and
from far over sea comes word that the
flag is waving where tyranny has ruled,
proving that oceans cannot stay the
march of freedom. Its shadow falls on
Cuban soil, it proudly streams above
the waters of Manila Bay, and perhaps
the distant isles of the Pacific have
learned its colors and acknowledged its
sway. As the benign domain of the
stars and stripes extends there comes
to us a new sense of the potency it rep
resents, a fresh jubilation that it has
never stood for dishonor nor been un
furled save above brave men who are
of our blood. It is fitting, as the ed
itorial suggested, that next Tuesday be
made a special flag day, because then
the emblem will have attained the age
of 121 years, not a great age, as history
goes, but one marked by high achieve
ment and growth unparalleled. And
the coming of this anniversary will find
the common heart touched with pa
triotic fire, and the thought in every
mind that this is the "Land of the
Beautiful Flag"; that It Is our land, and
our flag. Next Tuesday I expect the
city will be decked as never before, not
with gaudy arches and transparencies,
but with the flag. There could be no
finer decoration. Lovely in hue and
in design, upheld by valor, cheered by
affection, the eye fills with tears to see
it, tears of which none is ashamed. So
put the flag out Tuesday; It means so
much Just now.

PICTURES SOLD IN A NOBLE CAUSE.
Scenes at the Big Art Exhibition and Sale in Aid of the Red Cross,
A few more thousands were added to the already large fund of the Red Cross Society yesterday by one of the
most successful benefits held since the society nas been In existence. Never has there been such an outpouring of
culture and fashion as was seen in the cozy rooms' of the Press Club during the art exhibition given by local talent
In aid of the beneficent organization. From the moment the doors of the well-known club were thrown open at 2 in
the afternoon until late In the evening a large, appreciative and generous crowd moved in and out the Jlnksroom in
specting the interesting collection of bluck and white drawings and paintings, choosing from the assortment and pay
ing liberally.
In the afternoon the rooms were crowded by connoisseurs, who took advantage of being first on the scene by
carrying off the gems of the exhibition.
President Wella Drury, assisted by F. S. Myrtle, J. Tyler and T. F. Bonnet, did the honors of the club, while the
constantly increasing gathering was received by Mrs. A. W. Scott and an efficient corps of assistants composed of
Mrs. G. H. Martin, Mrs. W. J. Bryan, Mrs. Joseph Austin, Mrs. Judge C. W. Slack, Mrs. Ernestine Long, Mrs. S. M.
Shortridge, Mrs. C. 11. Blinn, Miss Olive Wheaton, Miss Mabel Blum, N. Clark. Miss Maud Tobin, Miss Maude
Steadman, Miss Mary Davison. Miss C. Cook, Mrs. Bteech, Miss Morse, Miss Letcher, Miss Treat, Annabel
Lee. Miss Helen Hyde. Miss Isabelle Porter, Miss Arnold, Miss Florence Treadwell, Miss Gertrude Walter, Miss Ruth
McCarthy, Miss Edith Westerfield, Miss Louise Bninner, Miss Lucy Croll.
Under the direction of Frank Coffin the following excellent musical programme was rendered in the afternoon:
Piano solo, M. Martinez; duet, Mrs. Parent and Mrs. Wilson; zither solo. Mr. Meyer; bass solo, Signor Watrell; duet,
Signor and Signora Cardenasso, and solos by Miss .lillle Flynn and Frank Coffin.
The crush became so great in tne evening that It was almost impossible to inspect the exhibit. After
Marinom, Wanrell, Henley, the California quartet, the Press Club quartet. Miss Alyce Gates, Miss Eva Tenney, R.
Fletcher Tllton and Clarence Wendell had rendered solos, S. M. Shortridge mounted the stage, and in a masterly
way auctioned off the remaining pictures. Bidding was brisk and drawings and paintings disappeared rapidly.
As the auction sale was not reached until a late hour a great many pictures were not disposed of. The Press
Club generously offered the ladies in charge the use of their rooms on Monday afternoon and evening to complete the
sale, and their offer was thankfully accepted.
Among the distinguished visitors present were General Merritt. General Otis, Governor Richards of Montana, Attor
ney-General Fitzgerald, Judge Van Fleet, Major Phelan, Chief Justice Potter, J. D. Freeborn of Cheyenne and many
other local celebrities.
committee and Dr. Q. C. Baker treas

such articles as must be purchased by

has already been made in this direc
tion.
A few evenings since an entertainment
was got up in Golden Gate. Alameda
County under the direction of Miss Ethel
Langford in aid of the Red Cross Society,
and netted $25. There were a number of
vocal and instrumental numbers, and the

Miss Langford gave burnt cork special

PATRIOTIC RETAIL
LIQUOR-DEALERS
THEY WILL RAISE FUNDS FOR
THE RED CROSS.
An Enthusiastic Committee Will
Begin Soliciting Memberships
To-Morrow.
The retail liquor dealers of the city
have come to the conclusion that it Is a
! part of their duty as patriotic citizens to
! contribute something substantial to the
: support of the work of the Red Cross
Society, and. after considerable specula- j
i tion as to how to accomplish that end, |
j they have devised a plan which they are i
certain will yield golden returns. Several
of the leading members of the trade have
organized a committee for active work,
and Judging from the class of men in
terested the movement should be success
ful.
They have received authorization from
the Red Cross Society not only to act out j
to appoint agents of that organization to
secure subscriptions for membership
thereto. Official lists, numbered consec
utively, have been printed, and it will
be thÂ« business of the members of the I
committee to see that these lists are j
placed in the hands of every responsible
saloon man in the city.
There are nine men in the organization,
namely: H. B. Adler, chairman; Jesse
E. Marks, vice-chairman; Thomas Fer
guson, treasurer; J. E. Krumb, secretary;
also Rudle Fishbach. William F. Roder.
Joseph M. Parker, Edward Osborn and
Charles Green.
This committee has divided the city Into
two sectionsâ north and south of Market
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 12, 1898.
street â Messrs. Parker, Fisher, Roder,
Green and Osborn to take, the former and
the others the latter. These men will de
vote their time every day for a week at
least to the good cause, and the entire
field will be thoroughly covered. Each
subscriber to the list will pay $1, arid not
only become a member, out receive an
official badge of the Red Cross Society.
The committee becomes responsible for
every list given out, and will give an ac
count thereof upon the final settlement.
There are about 4.">00 licensed places in San
Francisco, and the promoters or the plan
say that if they can get 1500 or 2000 retail
ers to take an active interest in the mat
ter they should be able to create a fund
of $10,000 at least, and some are sanguine
that this figure can be doubled. Some of
the large downtown places have as many
as fifty employes, and it is expected that
all will become subscribers to the fund,
and as the average saloon employs three
or more men, it can be seen that it Is pos
sible to run the collections up Into large
figures. The individual ideas of some of
the members of the committee as to their
proposition will be of interest. Said one:
"I have been thinking of some way to
help this good cause since the Red Cross
fund was at the $4000 mark, and I think
we are started in the right direction. We
will begin WOl* in a systematic manner
on Monday and place those lists where
we feel confident they will be correctly
handled. We are properly authorized
to conduct this work by the Red Cross
Society, and we are going to make it win.
I have spoken to many retailers on the
subject, and they all are heart and
hand with the cause. In fact, I find them
enthusiastic and 1 look for very gratify
ing results. I should not be .surprised If
we should raise $15,000. This would cer
tainly be B great help to the Boclety and
would at the same time show that our
sympathies are all right, and that we
are in earnest in our desire to aid this
noble cause. One feature of the scheme
is the fact that many of our patrons who
would probably never think of contribut
ing such a small sum will gladly hand In
their dollar."
"I think we have started on the right
course," remarked J. E. Krumb, " and
that we will be able to raise a lot of
money. 'With Buch a large field to work
on and the well-known fact that the
average saloon man Is as generous as
any class of people that can be named,
there appears to be no reason why we
should not do valuable work for the so
ciety. Every one to whom I mention the
proposition says it\is sure to win, and
if hard earnest work will accomplish
this end the scheme is all right. Take,
for instance, our place. We have forty
four employes, and I know that every
one of them will be glad to contribute,
] and 1 believe the same conditions will be
found all over the city. The point la
that we will cover ground that trie regu
lar Red Cross people cannot handle. It
is safe to say that San Francisco dealers
will be leaders in this work and set a
good example for the trade in Eastern
cities. We expect to put out from 2600 to
3000 lists, and they ought surely to aver
age $5 apiece."
Jesse E. Marks is very enthusiastic over
the proposition, and says that it Is sure
to result In a large sum of money for
the cause. "We have the work system
atized and the right sort of men to carry
It on to success. I believe that the re
tall dealers of this city are anxious to
respond to such a call of duty In behalf
of the soldiers, and this will give them an
easy way of doing so. We will spare no
time or money in promoting this move
ment, and it will not be many days be
fore there will be a couple of thousand
more Red Cross badges on the streets.
We propose to make this fund the largest
donation from any one source, and I be
lieve the public will give it the kindest
and most earnest support."
Thomas Ferguson, the treasurer, stated
that he would make the Columbian Bank,
In the Spreckels building, the depository
of the money received, and that that in
stitution would handle the money in trust
until delivered to the society. "This is
a grand scheme," said he, "and if we do
not get close up to the $30,000 mark I will
be surprised. With hard work I do not
see why we should not raise that cum,
because it is a grand patriotic charity,
and there are few who will decline to
assist it in this manner."
Joseph M. Parker also takes a very
bright view of the movement, and says
that the people in his line of business will
do some effective work of which they
will have just causa to be proud. Wif
11am Roder expressed the same senti
ments, saying that as the committee was
thoroughly united and anxious to suc
ceed -it would certainly accomplish a
great good.

THE GRAIN MARKET.
BAD CHOPS IN EUROPE AND
GOOD REPORTS HERE,
The Argentine Surplus Is at a Low
Ebb, but Home Prices Are Not
Likely to Improve Soon.
The past week has experienced more
depression In wheat values. A continua
tion of large crop reports throughout
the United States set the bear machinery
In working order. Foreigners were not
slow in grasping the situation, and were
less inclined to buy, even though wants
were urgent.
The heavy imports Into the United
Kingdom and the Continent during the
past thirty days have amounted to up
ward up 100,000.000 bushels, about double
as compared with any like period. Not
withstanding these heavy receipts Eng
lish and French stocks are the lowest
ever known. The condition of the grow
ing wheat crop throughout England is
very poor, too much moisture causing se
rious damage. The Corn Trade News, in
its last issue, asks where will English
millers find supplies unless they are will
ing to pay America's price, yet Ameri
cans know these conditions and are daily
hammering prices down for the benefit
of English and French consumers.
Accurate data as regards Russia's crop
cannot be had, but from fairly reliable
sources the condition is exceedingly
poor. The very high prices prevailing of
late having brought out all the available
surplus wheat in that country, it is but
natural that their carry-over will be very
small. The Argentine shipments are fall
ing off rapidly, showing their surplus Is
nearly exhausted. Indian shipments will
no doubt show a heavy falling off. The
Government report issued on Friday
makes the wheat acreage of the United
States 43.000.000. Upon this basis
the yield should be 650,000,000 bushelsâ the
largest crop ever grown. Of course, the
Government figuri-s are based upon con
ditions prevailing June 1. There yet re
mains much time in which damage may
overtake the crop. Winter wheat will
have three weeks further to go before
the crop will be secured, while spring
wheat is barely out of the ground. Con
ditions in June are generally the most
promising. The fact that a new harvest
is nearing makes the trade bearishly In
clined. Sentiment has its sway until ac
tual conditions are discounted too far,
then the short interest finds itself bot
tled up and a general change is the re
sult. Conditions on the Pacific Coast are
not materially changed from last week.
Washington and Oregon have complained
of hot weather, but it is not likely any
damage has thus far resulted. Should
any serious damage overtake the crop
of those States, then the conditions
throughout California would become lo
cal. Millers' wants would guide market
values.
From present indications there Is very
little hope for any improvement in wheat
prices during the present month. July
may see quite a general change. Many
predict $1 25 for December wheat this
month. Barley seems purely a scalpers'
market. There seems no hope for any
advance in prices for the time being.
Considerable spot is arriving, which finds
only a sluggish market to sell on. Un
doubtedly December will drop to par be
fo'-e any improvement may be looked for.

staff officer, who is in close touch with
the commanding general, remarked
last night: "The work is crowding ua
now, as General Merritt seems deter

Major-General Otis expresses the
opinion that the soldiers would go
aboard the ships next Wednesday and
that the sailing of the fleet would not
be delayed.
Brigadier-General Harrison G. Otis,
United States volunteers, resplendent in

before United States District Judge de

FIGHTINC A THREATENED EPIDEMIC OF MEASLES.
Measles threatens to become epidemic among the soldiers at Camp Mer
rltt. and Surgeons Owen, Morris and Page, In charge of the field hospital, are
bending all their energies to preventing the further spread of the malady
Fifty cases are now under their care, and during the past two or three
days six to eight new patients a day have been turned over to them. Fortu
nately the disease is in a mild form and all the patients are doing nicely.
Several of the Eastern regiments had from one to half a dozen of their
men down with measles when they arrived here, and although every pre
caution has been taken to guard against contagion since then, the sufferers
being isolated, most of the troops were unconsciously exposed, and it seems
as though most of those who are susceptible to the disease will have to take
their turn in the hospital.
The wards, though under canvas, are supplied with every convenience for
the Invalids, and a large corps of hospital stewards and assistants is de
tailed to care for them.
All three of the surgeons In charge belong to the medical department of
the United States .army. Major Owen being in charge, while Major Morris
attends to the non-infectious cases, leaving Captain Page to devote his en
tire attention to the measles patients. If the threatened epidemic is checked
in time, the field hospital and staff will be moved to Manila with the third
expedition.
ORDERS TO GO ABOARD
Major General Merritt Gives Verbal In-
stractlons for Embarkation.
Major General Merritt has not yet
Issued regular orders directing the
embarkation of troops for Manila,
but yesterday afternoon he sent
verbal instructions, through Major
General Otis, to colonels command
ing regiments and battalions desig
nated to sail to have finished by
Tuesday afternoon the placing
aboard ship of all camp equipage
and to be ready to embark their
troops by noon on Wednesday.
These orders, though not from
the ofHcral typewriter nor graced by
the official caption, are bona-fide
commands and were actually Issued
by General Merritt yesterday.
As a result, in the camps of all
the regiments that are to sail the
packing has begun of every bit of
camp equipage that can under
pressure be dispensed with.
were to tail on her. These volunteers
will now have to wait for the third
expedition.
The four other steamers of the sec
ond fleet will all finish taking on coal
this morning, and then the work of
loading the equipments of the soldiers
and all necessary supplies will at once
be begun under the direction of Major
Long, the depot quartermaster, who,
notwithstanding the shortness of the
time allowed him and several serious
obstacles. Is confident that he can ac
complish the task by next Wednesday
morning. One serious hindrance to the
rapid loading of the vessels is the lack
of trucks. So far It has not been pos
sible to secure more than thirty-five
trucks, whereas 150 could be used for
the next few days. It requires thirty
trucks alone to move the equipment of
one regiment. Each truck can carry
,a load of 7000 pounds. The heavy goods
will be the first to be put on board ship
this morning.
The quartermaster department ha? an
immense amount of work, and it is be
ing done by the same number of men
employed in time of peace. If the forcÂ°
were six times as large every man
I would be employed steady at work, but
the force cannot be increased on short
notice, as the knowledge of details re

RECRUITS ARRIVE.
The Eighteenth and Twenty-

to the Maximum.
The Eighteenth and Twenty-third Regi
ments of Infantry, U. S. A., are now ap
proximately to their full strength. Eight
hundred and forty-eight recruits from
Fort MoPherson, Georgia, arrived at Oak
land mole during Friday night and came
over to this side at 6:30 o'clock yesterday
morning.
The soldiers traveled arross the conti
nent in three sections, the first being in
command of Major J. W. Bubb, who also
had command of the entire detachment,
and Lieutenant G. H. Steel, Nineteenth
Infantry, who waa detailed as commis

Notwithstanding the early hour of ar

breakfast ready for the hungry men,
which they were not slow In disposing of.
Then they were loaded down with flow

J. B. Stetson addressed them briefly,
railing upon them to defend the stars and
stripes with their last breath. Major
Bubb next took nls turn at speech-mak

eclipse all other demonstrations In honor

his men for three cheers for the Red
Cross ladies,, which were given with such
a vim that the ferry building fairly
shook. , .
The enlisted men were gathered from
all parts of the East, from Illinois -to

MERRITT'S LATEST PLAN.
General Merrltt's latest plan Is to hold all the troops destined for the
Philippines remaining here after the second expedition sails, until sufficient
ships are procured to convey the entire command and send them all out
together. This plan was revealed at headquarters late yesterday afternoon,
and unless the War Department orders the troops sent out as fast aa
transports can be fitted up, it will be carried out.
The first and second expeditions will give Admiral Dewey a land force of
7000 men, which General Merritt believes is sufficient to hold Manila until
he gets there with the others. If his present arrangement Is carried out
the last of the troops are not likely to get away from here much before
the middle of July, for several vessels the Government expects to secure

dlan campaigns. It was In the famous
"Starvation March" and battle of the
"Rosebud" of General Crooks, ten days
prior to the massacre of Cunter and his
heroic command, that Major Bubb won
his captaincy.
From that date up to his trant-fer to
Fort Sheridan, eighteen months ago.
Major Bubb has played a prominent
part in every important Indian uprising
of the great Northwest. , .
All of the officers who came out with

AN ARM\ MYSTERY.
Why the Presidio Is Not Used
as a Camping Ground.
There is something mysterious In the
attitude of leading army officers when
the question of utilizing the Presidio res
ervation for military purposes is intro
duced. Last Thursday a decision -was
reached that the camp at Richmond
should be vacated as soon as practicable
and that troops to arrive here from the
East should be encamped on the reserva
tion. The next day the plans agreed upon
were reconsidered and a suggestion was
adopted that the camp at Richmond
should be gradually dlnlntegratf-d. It
was contended that the dispatch of troops
to the Philippines would soon close up
the camp in that section. It was said
that Camp Merrltt was established as an
emergency camp and that the purpose
which the military authorities had In
view was practically fulfilled.
Objection seems to be raised now
against the encampment of incoming sol-
diers on the Presidio reservation. It is
claimed that no moral advantage would
result from the occupancy of the Pre
sido and that the change would not bet
ter the sanitary conditions. Water is
the main element In which the Presidio
1b said to be lacking, yet It Is a known
fact that at least 0000 troops were en
camped on the reservation just before the
first Manila expedition sailed, and Colo
nel Morris, commanding the podt, had
provided for the accommodation of addi
tional organizations. The water mains
of the Spring Valley on Lombard street
were intersected to supply the camp with
water.
The condition of affairs at Camp Mer
ritt is probably known to Major General
Otis, who commands tho camp. It is not
his fault that forty-eight saloons, some
of them no better than dives, are estab
lished in the immediate vicinity of his
soldiers. Commencing on Point Lobos
avenue at Masonic avenue, thence west
to Seventh avenue, on that avenue south
to Fulton, on Fulton to First avenue
and on First avenue facing the camp,
there are forty-eight places where liquors
are sold. Many of the places have
sprung into existence since the camp was
established. Everywhere is spread the
temptation of the soldier to spend his
money. Some of the dens shelter lewd
women and low-down men whose busi
ness it is to entice the volunteers to
drink and carouse. This is not the fault
of Major <;->!ieral Otis. Ife has no con
trol over the license regulations pf San
Francisco and cannot close the public

CHRISTIAN COMMISSION.
Steps to Organize for Work in
the United States Army.
As has been done in other State.4 of the
country, the United States Army Chris
tian Commission of the Young Men's
Christian Association will probably be in
augurated at the Young Men's Christian
Association building to-morrow afternoon,
at 2 o'clock, when State officers will be
elected. There 1b a national organization
of the Christian Commission, with head
quarters with the International Commit
tee of the Young Men's Christian Asso- 1
elation at New York city. Each State has I
been organized separately to co-operate
with the International Committee, but
each State works separately so far as
raising money and providing men for the
field in concerned. All money an.i work
ers supplied for Christian work in the
United States army will be provided I
through this Christian Commission of thÂ« :
Young Men's Christian Association, and 1
all kindred organizations of the churches
will co-operate with this agency.
The national officers of the Christian
Endeavor movement have officially ad
vised their societies in the Eastern
States to work through this department
of the Young Men's Christian Associa
tion so that there may not be any misun
derstanding or conflict of forces. The as
sociation being a definite organization for
men, and having carried forward this
work exclusively throughout the entire
Civil War, Is considered best fitted to
continue the work. There are many ap
plications for appointments as hejperg in
evangelistic work In the army, and when
this commission is complete all arrange
ments will have to go through this de
partment, as already the army depart
ment is besieged by persons desiring to
go to the front as Christian workers
among the enlisted nren.
When the first volunteers were called
for the International Committee of the
Young Men's Christian Association, at
the suggestion of D. L. Moody, deputized
one of its secretaries, W. B. Millar, who
went immediately to Washington, D. C,
to take up the work with President Me-
Klnley and the War Department. He got
their approval and indorsement, and offi
cial letters were issued authorizing the
organization of the commission. Copies
of these letters will be presented to the
Committee on Organization to-morrow.
An official badge similar to that worn
hv the Red Cross will be adopted by the
Christian Commission when thoroughly

GAVE AN ARM ; OFFERS HIS LIFE.
CAPTAIN WILLIAM P. ROGERS, Seventeenth United States
Infantry.
There arrived In San Francisco yesterday, in command of one section of
the detachment of recruits from Fort McPherson, Ga,, a man who has the
distinction of being the only one-armed officer now in the service-. Cap
tain William P. Rogers is his name, and as he marched up Market street
at tho head of his command his empty coat sleeve excited loud cheers
from the throngs on the street.
Captain Rogers has been in the service constantly for thirty-six years
and In that time has won his way from corporal in the volunteers to his
present rank in the Seventeenth Infantry. He began his military career
with Company H, Seventh Maryland Infantry, in August, 1862, and was with
the Army of the Potomac from that time until the close of the war No
troops in all the Northern forces saw harder service than did the Maryland
brigade, and promotion came to comparatively few of its intrepid members,
but young Rogers had no thought of advancement, or anything else for that
matter, hut to get into the thickest of the trouble whenever there was any
fighting going on.
It was at Spottsylvania Courthouse, in 1864. that a rebel bullet emptied
his left coat sleeve. The loss of an arm. however, did not take any of
the fl.ght out of the youngster, and instead of accepting a discharge he re
mained with his regiment until thn close of the war.
In recognition of his bravery, he was appointed second lieutenant in the
Forty-fourth Infantry in 1866, and when the army was reorganised In 1869
he was transferred to the regiment he now belongs to
For twenty-four years the Seventeenth battled with the Indians on the
Northwestern frontier, and in every campaign, including the Nes Perces and
Blackfoot wars, the Sioux uprisings of 1576. when Custer and his little band
were wiped out, and the ghost dance of 1890-91. Captain Rogers took a con
spicuouÃ part. He was -promoted to first lieutenant in 1872 and given his
present commission in 1884. Four years ago his regiment was transferred to
Columbus, 0., and Captain Rogers had made up his mind that his fighting
days were over. But the present war wills it otherwise; his regiment is
now at Tampa, unless it is on the way to Cuba, and Captain Rogers will
return East at once to Join his command.

VICTORIOUS
Wins in Last Inning on a
Stupid Play.
MANAGER TUTTLE HAS FITS
HE READS THE RIOT ACT WITH
BIG SUCCESS.
Mr. TJp-in-the-Air Baltz Goes in
Search of a Long-Distance Throw
ing Record and Easily Gets
There.
BY JOE CORBETT.
The Santa Cruz comedians, under the
manapomi'iit of a gentleman by the name
of Tuttle, opened up in a nine-act comedy
drama yesterday at Recreation Park, and
delighted the swell audience present by
their "rap-time" playing.
This troupe since the beginning of the
season has not been giving as good a per
formance as the cast would indicate, and
all ports of nn'tin things have been said
and written about the members" inability
to properly render the parts assigned
them. Mr. Devereaux, who is the leading
man of this spectacular group of "sand
crabs." In discussing the probability of
their some day attracting: the attention of
the "dear public." pave out the state
ment that his "bunch of comedes" in
tended turning the tables on Manager
Crowley's collection of ancient bric-a
brac, and lived up to his word only after
the severest test of grit.
You see, it was just this way: Mr.
Devereaux. who looks for all the world
like a large-sized bottle of "Tabasco
sauce," in giving out the above state
ment, neglected to confide the news to
his "master mechanic," Mr. "Up-ln-the-
Air" Baltz, and so this individual, just to
draw forth a few hoots and liven up
things a bit, picked up a ball that he in
coma unforeseen manner got tangled up
â with, and threw it over midst the "dead
heads." In recognition of the delicate
applause â which was spontaneousâ over
this heroic act, he gracefully bowed him
self out, but returned a moment later on
discovering that his time for paying an
extended visit to the upper atmospheric
elements had not really arrived, and that
bis labors were still needed in the drama-
After this unfortunate mistake, Mr.
"Up-in-the-Alr" played his part beauti
fully and did not appear a bit worried
over the fact that his wild throw cost
three run?. It would not, however, be
a bad idea for Mr. Baltz to rehearse that
part which compels him to remain on
"terra flrma." And again, It is a very
bad Idea for a pitcher, when he occu
pies the box, to go in search of long
distance throwing records, especially
when the score 1b close and the ba--Â«es
occupied. Mr. Baltz appears to be af
flicted with a desire to kill some one
when a ball Is hit to him. He certainly
has a grievance against that "Imper
sonator 1 who covers first base. If not,
why did he pick up the ball and endeavor
to knock hiÂ» head off? The runner had
hardly left the plate before ho picked the
Bphere up, and instead of simply tossing
It in the direction of first, he doubles up
as pitchers generally do in preparing for
a sojourn into space â and propels it so
fast that, were it not for the combined
efforts of bleachers and febce, it would
no doubt be going yet. Luckily for the
"impersonator" its course was somewhere
In the vicinity of fifteen feet heavenward.
It struck me that Ualtz mistook the City
Hall dome for the first baseman, ana
a>'ted accordingly. At any rate, Mr. Baltz
has all the other pitchers beat, when, it
comes to long distance throwing, and
should not for a moment think other
wise.
When the excitement caused by his
brief ascension subsided it was noticed
that the score S>. .;i r<i registered "Ath
letics" 4 runs. "Sand Crat>s" 0. Mr. Tut
tle, who graced the press box with his
presence, suddenly disappeared on real
izing the grave situation. He was dis
covered very shortly, however, reading
the "riot act" to his "comedians," and
the. effect his presence and outburst of
eloquence had on them wan astonishing.
In that very inning they commenced to
earn their salaries, and scored one run.
The effort, however, seemed to unnerve
them, as they quieted down for a couple
of Innings, yet responded bravely when
their proprietor took another fit In the
seventh inning, and no doubt to save him
from certain death they scored another
run.
It became apparent to Manager Tuttle,
after witnessing the effect his fits wire
having, that to win the game he must
keep up this bad habit, so in the eighth
Inning ne took a "spasm" and two more
runs were the result. This last rally tied
toe score, and then followed the fatal
ninth. Tuttle was equal to the emer
gency. "Fits" occasioned one run.
spasms two. After the Athletics had
been retired without the semblance of a
tally Tuttle was seen gesticulating In a
wild manner. He was partial to his first
love. "Fits," and it was this last one
which won the game, as Arrolanes crack
ed out a corking three-bagger and scored
the winning run on about as stupid a
play as I have ever seen.
I don't know whether it was Tuttle's
"fit" or nervous prostration which in
spired Baltz to sacrifice, but he did, with
the infield playing almost on a line with
tho pitcher's box. The ball went right
Into the first baseman's hnnds, and it was
pitiful to see the runner score. It
seemed almost a week before Stultz got
the ball away, and at that he almost
caught the runner. If he had simply
tossed the ball, without rising from the
ground and taking a couple of steps,
there was not a chance for the man to
score. He, however, like a good many
other players, does not seem to realize
the Importance of rapid work in plays
that are close, and In consequence a
fame was lost. There was only one play
or Baltz to make when he saw the infield
pulled In. That play was to hit the ball.
The chances for a hit or error are never
better. But to sacrifice at such a critical
stage, with the Infield playing so close. Is
very poor baseball, and Baltz should con
gratulate himself on getting away with

Patriots.
The Call's suggestion that Tuesday be generally celebrated as the one hundred and twenty-first anniversary of the
birth of the American flag has struck a responsive chord In the hearts of the people. Governor Budd, Superintendent of
Schools Webster of this city and other prominent citizens do not hesitate to say that the suggestion is an excellent one and
that every house in the Stato should be decorated on that day.
By a general observance of the day respect for Old Glory will be inculcated in the minds of children, while adults will
enkindle old memories and renew patriotism. Following are some representative opinions:

O GOVERNOR BL'DDâ It is an excellent idea to fitly commemorate the birth of the flag. If all public and private o
O houses are decorated, and if citizens will quite generally wear flags it will do much to show that Americans are not O
O slow to express the patriotism for which the country is celebrated. O
O There need be no elaborate preparation for Buch an expression of patriotism as The Call has suggested. Flags o
O are cheap, and hardly any one is so poor that he cannot buy some 6ort of a flag and wear it or wave it as an em- O
O blem of freedom. It is not necessary to proclaim a legal holiday or to go through any red tape to reach the purpose. O
O I think everybody in the State ought to have a flag in evidence on Tuesday. o
Reginald K. Webster, Superintendent
of Schoolsâ This matter was presented to
me some days ago by a gentleman who
wished me to issue an order directing
every schoolhouse to fly the stars and
stripes on June 14. I stated on that oc
casion that as the flag floated daily over
the schools, there was no necessity for
such an order. Not only should the flag
be displayed on the premises of every
public school In this city and county, but
brief exercises should be observed in the
different classes consisting of an address
by the teacher in which the history of
the creation of the flag and its symbolism
should be developed, and an address by
a pupil, or some appropriate recitation on
the flag; that to be succeeded by patriotic
quotations and a salute of the flag By the
entire class and the pledging of their
allegiance to it.
I will say that the exercises I have
just mentioned are observed in all the
| the play. Luckily for him the ball did
I not go to Reilly. The score is as follows:

To-Day's Game.
The cry of the Beachcombers has been
heard. J. Cal. Ewing and his hairless
wonders, while discussing "Pop" Hardle's
new "hair restorer" discovery, heard the
cry of these "sand crabs" way over in
Oakland after yesterday's victory, and
has had his team out practicing all night.
That the game to-day between these two
teams will be a good one may be gauged
from the fact that Mr. Tuttle says "From
this clay on Santa Cruz will never lose
another game." Cal Ewlng offers each of
his players extra inducements to win, so
the game will be good, not matter how
things go. The line-up is as follows:

HOMELESS AND PENNILESS.
A Starving Family of Three Driven
Out Into the Streets.
Edmund Bedell, a veteran of the late
war, has had a run of hard luck which
has left him, his wife and boy wondering
whore their next meal will come from.
Bedell is a ship carpenter by trade, but
age and sickness have Incapacitated him
for work at this business, and he has
been nhiiged for some time past to de
pend upon such little odd jobs as he
might pick up. In time these, too, gave
out, and last Thursday night found the
little funnily with nothing to eat in the
house and the landlady importuning
them for the rent. There was no money
to pay with, however, and the family
was turned out In the street to seek
shelter from the hands of charity. The
man went out to the City Hall and re
quested that he be allowed to sleep In
the City Prison, but the officers were
kind-hearted and gave him enough
money to pay a couple of days' room
rent. Accommodations were secured In
the Winchester House, at 44 Third street,
but the little supply of money is ex
hausted, and unless assistance of some
kind Is speedily procured the little family
will once again be told to move on.
INTERSTATE COMMERCE LAWS.
W. J. Calhoun, a Member of the Com
mission, Arrives in This City.
The Interstate Commerce Commission,
which recently met in Portland, adjourn
ed on Wednesday last without implicating
those railroad companies which have dis
criminated in favor of certain parties In
regard to freight charges. \V. J. Cal
houn, a member of the commission; Ed
ward A. Motley, secretary, and W. A.
Day, attorney of the commission, arrived
in this city on Friday and will remain
here for some time.
Mr. Calhoun. who was a member of the
Cuban Commission sent by President Mc-
Kinley to investigate the death of Dr.
Rule about a year ago, said last night
that the evidence which the Interstate
Commerce Commission succeeded in col
lecting was not of a conclusive charac
ter though there certainly were Indica
tions which showed violations of the in
terstate commerce law on the part of
several of the railroad companies. Mer
chants were examined, but no striking
admissions were made. That discrimin
ations have been made In favor of certain
individuals the commission is certain.
The commission expects to hold a meet
lne here in the near future, when Investi
gations on these lines will be continued.
New Stage Road Opened.
The old stage road, for a long time In
disuse, betweeen Lower Lake, in Lake
County and Rumsey, In Yolo County, has
been rebuilt and will be reopened for
tniflle in the very near future. By means
of this there will be a continuous line of
travel from this city through the Capay
Valley and Clear Lake, making the sur
rounding country easy of accees.

schools at the present time. Many of
the classes salute the flag twice a week,
and it is recommended in the course of
study that at least once a week the
pupils pledge allegiance to their country.
This programme interspersed with music
fitting to the subject would in my judg
ment constitute the exercises that should
take place in our schools on that occa
sion, and I believe from what I have,
learned from teachers that it will be more
or less observed in the schools. These
are times when patriotism is running
very high, and I wish to bear testimony
to the fact that wherever I have been in
the public schools I have found univer
sal evidence of a strong patriotic senti
ment. It has been stated that the spirit
of patriotism was not sufficiently incul
cated in our public schools, but I am
confident that if any one should enter
them he would be more than pleased with
the manifestation and loyalty to the flag.

â¢ A lengthy discussion followed on the
question as to whether the celebration
proposed by the committee could be car
ried out on the $3000 appropriated by the
Supervisors. The majority of the menj
bers present were of the opinion that the
appropriation would be sufficient, and ex
pressed a decided objection to soliciting
additional funds from downtown mer
chants. This, however, did not preclude
the acceptance of any voluntary contri
butions that may be made to the finance
committee by patriotic citizens.
After debating the matter of allowances
to be made to the sub-committees, for
fully two hours, It was decided to adjourn
until next Tuesday evening, when reports
will be received from the chairmen of the
several committees relative to the amount
of money each of them will require to
make a proper display.
WORDEN'S TIME GROWS SHORT.
His Last Appeal to the Supreme
Court Has Been Denied.
The chances of escape of S.ilter D.
Worden, convicted of murder In wrecking
a railroad train during the big railroad
strike, are growing less every day. The
last set-back he got was at the hands of
the Supreme Court yesterday when his
petition for a writ of error was disposed
of by denial. Ills attorney made an ef
fort to get the case before the United
States Supreme Court on a writ of error,
and the grounds upon which the appeal
was made were that the lower court erred
in giving instruction to the Jury. Also
that the evidence presented by the pros
ecution was not sufficient to warrant the
verdict of murder in .the first degree,
with the punishment of death by hanging.
This case has attracted as much atten
tion ac any ever tried in the courts of this
State. During the railroad strike live
years ago a railroad train carrying troops
to Sacramento to subdue the strikers was
wrecked in Yolo County by the track
having been tampered with. The engine
and tender were tumbled into a ditch,
and the engineer, Clark, was killed. Wor
den and others were arrested and he was
convicted. The case has been appealed
to every court in the land havine" juris
diction, and the convicted man has been
reprieved by the Governor several times.

POLLY WINKED HER EYE.
Policeman Menihan's Hand Badly
Torn by a Parrot in Court.
Policeman Menlhan now detests poll
parrots and declares that he would not
have one of them in his house for love
or money.
Yesterday Menihan was the custodian
of a poll parrot In Judge Mohan's court
room. It had been taken by Menlhan from
Mrs. Otts, E66 Minna street, In virtue of a
search warrant sworn out by Mrs. Mc-
Monomy, 1057 Mission street, for Its re-
covery. Mrs. McMenomy claimed that
she was the owner of the parrot, which
had been twice stolen from her by Mrs.
Otts, the last time on May 15 last.
When the case was called Meninan was
ordered to bring the parrot into court.
Instead of taking hold of the top of thÂ«
cage Menihan Inserted his left hand
through the bars and polly promptly
stuck her bill into the obtruding hand
and tore the flesh open. Menihan gave a
yell that stopped the proceedings in th<i
court for a moment and said some un
complimentary things about the parrot.
It required nil his presence of mind to
prevent him from taking summary ven
geance on polly as he saw the blood
pouring out of the wounds on his hand.
The parrot was turned over to Mrs.
McMenomy, much to Mrs. Otts' dis
gust, and she only stopped her protests
when the Judge threatened to commit
her for petty larceny for stealing the par
rot.
As Menihan handed the parrot to Mrs.
McMenomy he said: "Shure, I wouldn't
have the dirty baste In my house for a
fortune, and I'm mortally glad to get rid
of it."
A SOLDIER IN TROUBLE.
Arthur Jackel Charged With At-
tempted Robbery and Mali
cious Mischief.
Arthur Jackel, a member of the South
Dakota regiment, was arrested early yes
terday morning by Policeman Connor
on charges of malicious mischief and at
tempted robbery.
Jaokel had been taking In the Barbary
Coast, and about 4 o'clock yesterday
morning, while under the influence of
liquor, he entered the coffee parlors or
Louis Juhl, f>37 Broadway. He demanded
liquor, but Juhl informed him that he
did not sell strong drinks. They had
some word? and Jackel, after remarking
that he would get even with Juhl, went
outside and threw a cobblestone through
the window.
Policeman Connor heard the crash and
placed Jackel under arrest. As he waa
taking him to the police station Andrew
Mayer met them, and accused Jackel of
knocking him down on Broadway short
ly before and attempting to rob him.
The cases were called in Judge Mogan's
court yesterday morning and continued
until to-morrow.
The Registration.
The registration office will be kept open
at night after Monday next. This was
decided by the Election Commissioners
yesterday, but the decision was reached
only after a meeting that was not as quiet
as It might have been.
Mr. Biggy asked permission of the board
to keep his office open until 9 o'clock at
night In order to avoid the rush which
always occurs at the close of the time
for registration. Mr. Broderick objected
because he thought it would be an un
necessary expense so early In the cam
paign. Mr. Biggy said it was his purpose
to avoid as much as possible the hurry
which always comes In at the end of
the registration time. Mr. Broderlck
hinted that the expenses of the office were
enough already, and then a passage at
arms between the Registrar and the Au
ditor was only stopped by the gavel of
the chairman of the board.
The registration so far this year
amounts to 2196; yesterday's figures were
134.
Belcher Must Sign.
The case of the Parafflne Paint Com
pany against the Board of Harbor Com
missioners has reached the Supreme
Court. Yesterday Attorney F. A. Strat
ton for the Commissioners applied to that
tribunal for a writ of mandate to compel
Superior Judgre Belcher to order the
plaintiffs to prepare the findings and de
cision In the case, in order that the Judge
may sign the same. In his petition the
attorney sets forth that at the conclu
sion of the trial in the lower court the
Judge announced his decision from the
hencn and directed the plaintiff's attor
neys to prepare the findings and decision
for him. This haÂ» not been done, and a
motion for an order to have the plaintiff's
attorneys carry out the directions of the
Court as stated, was denied by Judge
Belcher. In order to keep the ball roll
ing, so to speak, the defendants presented
the findings In accordance with the de
cision, so Ihey assert, but the Judge haa
refused to sign them. The Supreme Court
has ordered that Judge Belcher see that
the findings are signed, or show cause
before the higher tribunal in bank on
July 11th why he has not done so
His Left Arm Torn.
George Miller, an expert mechanic, liv
ing at 2919 Sacramento street, waa en
gaged yesterday afternoon in examining
the machinery of an elevator at 508 Cali
fornia street, when his left arm aot
caught in a cog wheel and the flesh, mus
cles and nerves were torn off from the
elbow to the shoulder. Ho was taken to
the Receiving Hospital, but refused to be
treated there, and was later taken to a
private hospital on Capp and Sixteenth
streets. He may lose his arm.

A SEWERAGE SYSTEM
FOR FOLSOM PRISON
OFFICIALS ALLOW THE NECES
SARY DEFICIENCY.
The Pollution of the American and
Sacramento Bivers Will Soon
Be Stopped.
Before very long the Board of State
Prison Commissioners will begin the con
struction of a sewerage system for the
prison at Folsom, whereby the refuse and
disease breeding drainage of that institu
tion will be emptied elsewhere than into
the American River. For years past the
drainage of the prison has been into this
river, which flows into the Sacramento,
from which the inhabitants below obtain
their supply for drinking and household
purposes. This was a serious menace to
public health. During the past few years
the Infected waters of the rivers have
caused considerable sickness among the
Inhabitants along their banks. This Bub-
Ject was taken up several weeks ago by
The Call, and the dangers thoroughly ex
posed. The people of Sacramento became
aroused and a great flght was made
against the continuance of the menace to
public health. Indignation meetings were
held, and the. officials of the city and
county demanded that some system be
devised whereby the sewage of the priÃon
be carried into other channels than that
from which the drinking water of thou
sands of people is taken.
The efforts in the cause of more sani
tary measures had their effect, but the
State officers moved slowly, being ham
pered by a certain amount of red tape,
which had to be unwound first. At last
the tape line reached its end and the
State Board of Prison Directors began a
move in the right direction. They de
cided that it was not right that the pol
lution of the rivers in this way should
continue and the health of the public
endangered. In this conclusion they were
supported by the Penal Code of the State,
which declares that the pollution of riv
ers and other streams is a crime. Having
arrived at this conclusion they next con
sulted their finances and found that the
funds at their disposal were a little shy
for so large an undertaking as the con
struction of a sewerage system for the
prison.
Their next move was to consult the
Governor and the Attorney General. Yes
terday Governor Budd and Attorney Gen
eral Fitzgprald decided to allow the Pris
on Directors to create a deficiency for
$15,000. With this sum at their disposal
the Prison Directors will at once begin
operations, so they say. That is, they
will look over the ground and see how
the sewerage of the prison can be carried
away from the prison in a manner that
will "not endanger public health. So far
no plans have been decided upon, but the
directors say they will lose no time in
their preparation.
Accuses an Agent.
The license committee of the Board of
Supervisors has received a communica
tion from I,abor Commissioner Fitzger
ald asking that the license of W. A. Shep
ard, an employment agent, be canceled,
and in the letter is inclosed a copy of a
communication received by the Commis
sioner in which is set forth a list of
grievances. It is charged that Shepard
has been arrested on charges of fraud,
and that he is not a fit person to be al
lowed to conduct such an agency.
Divorce Suits Filed.
The following suits for divorce were
filed In the Superior court yesterday:
"William Rosenberg against Minnie Ro
senberg, on the ground of desertion;
Mary D. Skinner against John B. Skin
ner.'on the ground of failure to provide;
Isabel Duenwald from Charles Duen
wald, on the ground of desertion; Ida M.

on the ground of failure to provide, and
Jessie L. Tooley against George W. Too

MARVELOUS HOME REMEDY
MAILED FREE TO ALL WHO

i Can Be Given in Tea, Coffee or Food, Thus
Absolutely and Seoretly Curing the
Patient in a Short Time With- ,
, out His Knowledge.
There Is a cure for Drunkenness that has
shed a radiance into thousands of hitherto
desolate firesides. It does Its work bo silently
and surely that while the devoted wife, sister
or daughter looks on, the drunkard Is reclaimed
even against his will and without his knowl-
edge or co-operation. The discoverer of this
grand remedy. Dr. Halnes, will send a sample
I of the remedy free to all who will write for it.
I Enough of the remedy Is mailed free to show
how it Is used In tea, coffee or food and that It
will cure the dreaded habit quietly and per-
manently,
Mies May Muse of Liberty, Kan., used this
wonderful : remedy and cured a near and dear
relative and she. writes a most earnest appeal
to all other women to thus spread the work of
saving drunkards.
' Mrs. May Branum, Owens, La., says the
remedy succeeded in completely curing her
husband and he thought it was by hie own
free will, never suspecting the food.
Mrs. B. I. Langdon of Wheatland. Cal., says
she will never hesitate to recommend it as it
cured her husband, who was a hard drinker.
Hundreds of others are reported, even the
worst cases where the habit seems to have
! blotted out the last remaining spark of self-
respect. '
Tears and prayers are of no use. Pleading,
pledges, loss of social or business position are
unavailing to stem the tide of absolute deprav-
ity. This famous remedy, Golden Specific, dis-
covered by Dr. Halnes, has reunited thousands
of scattered families, It haÂ» saved thousands
of men to social and business prominence and
public respect; has guided many a young man
Into the right road to fortune; has saved the
father, the brother, the son ana in many cases
the wife and daughter, too. Such a godsend
to the fireside should be known to everyone.
Dr. Halnes is not a philanthropist In his own
estimation, and yet he is one of the greatest
benefactors to the family we know of. Upon
application to Dr. J. W. Halnes, 868 Glenn
Building, Cincinnati. 0., ho will mall a free
sample of the remedy to you, securely sealed
in a plain wrapper, also full directions how to

FEARS TO
FACE THE
POPULACE
San Jose's School Board
Now Holds Secret
Sessions.
Efficient Educator Deposed to
Mal^e I^oom for a Friend of
"Boss" I^ea.
BAN JOSE, Jane ILâ The City Board
of Education is engaged in conducting
a aeries of Htar-chamber meetings. Thla
clandestine way of conducting business
1b the result of the great wave of public
disapproval of the board's action that
haa Bwept over the city in the past ten
days. Since the Trustees failed to re
elect Professor L. R. Smith to the
faculty of the High School and dls- ;
oharged Mrs. A- B. Clement, the As
sistant City Superintendent, the people
have been possessed of a desire to see
tbe workings of the board. In this they
have been unsuccessful. There was no :
regrular meeting on Monday night and
an adjournment was taken until Thurs
day night, but no session was held at
that time. Yesterday afternoon the '
board held a meeting without any call
or other notification and elected the
kindergarten teachers for the year.
Undoubtedly the reason for holding
unannounced meetings is to avoid hav
ing any one present. At the last public
meeting the High School students
turned out 300 strong and protested
against the dismissal of Professor
Fmith. It is the fear of a repetition of
this outpouring of students, together
with the attendance of a large number
of citizens who are aroused over the
recent actions of the board, that has
caused the School Trustees to hold
these secret sessions.
The San Jose Woman's Club has
risen in arms over the dismissal of Mrs.
Clement, who has served the city faith
fully and efficiently as Assistant City
Superintendent for the past six years.
In that time not one word has been*said
against Mrs. Clement and cnly words
of praise have been mentioned in con
nection with her work. But. notwith
standing this, the Board of Education
has dropped her and placed Miss Irene
Hunkenson of Gilroy In the position.
Miss Hankenson has taught for Beveral
years at Gilroy, but has had no ex
perience in the work she will meet in
the superintendent's office. Her ap
pointment was obtained through
"Boss" Rea.
At the last meeting of the "Woman's
Club resolutions deprecating the action
of the Board in dismissing Mrs. Clem
ent ajid asking that she \e reinstated
were adopted, and yesterday these reso
lutions were presented to the Board of
Education. No action Was taken on
them, and they were ordered filed. The
resolutions are an follows:
Whereas, The Woman's Club of
San Jose was organized for the en
couragement and advancement not
only of educational interests but
of all objects that make ior better
social and Intellectual conditions;
and
Whereas. The Woman's Club is
not a corporation, but is pledged to
stand for rlifht and .iustice and the
best Interests of society, whether
the matters considered may affect
club members or not; and
Whereas, The administration of
our public school affairs in a man
ner consistent with Justice and
right and with the maintenance of
a high standard of efficiency in our
public schools comes properly
within tha scope of the Woman's
Club; and
Whereas. Mrs. A. B. Clement,
wtio has tilled the position of As
sistant City Superintendent for six
year*, has proved herself most em
inently qualified by long experi
ence, faithful and untiring- service
and exceptional natural ability for
the duties of this responsible posi
tion; and
Whereas, The recent action of
the Ban Jose Board of Education
in falling to re-elect Mrs. Clement
to the. position that she has filled
bo acceptably and putting a new
official in the place tends to weak
en the efficiency of our school,
works a cruel injustice to a faith
ful official fuid is In direct violation
of the principle of civil service re
form which Is supposed to govern
public office holding; and
Whereas, While the new ap
pointee may be and doubtless is a
most worthy lady, against whom
wtÂ» are making no complaint, yet
there la no valid reason for sub
jecting the schools to the loss of a
lone tried and capable officer and
lining her place with one who must
acquire experience in this impor
tant department at the expense of
the school department. Therefor*
be it
Resolved, That the San Jose
Woman's Club respectfully and
most earnestly petitions the San
Jose Board of Education that in
the best interests of our schools
as well as In the cause of right
and in justice to a faithful and ef
ficient officer, against whom there
has been no charge wnatever. It
reconsider its action whereby Mrs.
Clement was dropped from tne po
sition she has filled so satisfacto
rily and reappoint her to the oftice
of Assistant City School Superin
tendent.
These resolutions are lndorseu by the
115 members of the Woman's Club, In
cluding the most prominent and in
fluential ladies of the city, et the
board paid no more attt-n* i to the
resolutions than if they were nothing
but a Chinese wash ticket that had in
some unknown manner drifted in\o the
Trustees 1 room.
The officers of the Woman's Club are:
President, Mrs. S. A. Jones; secre* â â â¢Â»Â»
Mrs. L. Callisch; corresponding secre
tary, Mrs. F. L. Poster; treasurer, Mrs.
J. Schoenhelt; auditor, Mrs. A, P. Mur
gotten. Board of directors: Mrs. E.
O. Bmith, Mrs. Mitchell Phillips, Mrs.
J. Schoenhelt, Mrs. S. A. Jones, Mrs. A.
P. Murgotten. Mrs. N. T. Biddle. Mrs.
P. L. Foster and Mrs. L. Callisch.
These and other members are strong
In their denunciation of the board's ac
tion. They say rrierlt should be recog
nized and kept In the School Pepart
! ment when found, as the dismissal of \
such ladles as Mrs. Clement weakens â 
the offlciency of the department. They j
hold Trustees Kenyon, Graham,
O'Brian and Wemple responsible, al- i
though they admit these four were but
doing the bidding of the "gang." The
ladies do not propose to let the matter
drop, and may take other steps to let
the Trustees know they take an interest
in affairs pertaining to home and i
schools.
This morning Miss Irene Hankenson,
accompanied by Rea, appeared be
fore City Superintendent Russell and
took the oath of office of Assistant City
Superintendent.
CHARGES AGAINST
CAPTAIN COOPER.
Members of the Board of Visitors
Claim to Have Been Discour
teously Treated.
WASHINGTON. June 11.â Members
of the board of visitors to the Naval
Academy, who are said to have been
displeased with alleged rude treatment
accorded them by the Superintendent
and other officials during their recent
official visit to the institution, do not
seem willing to discuss the matter.
Representative Hilborn of California,
who acted as the president of the
board and is one of the leading mem
bers of the House Committee on Naval
Affairs, hints that the members of the
buard were not pleased with the recep
tion or treatment by Captain Cooper.
He says that there will probably be
an official investigation of the matter.
It is reported that he himself called the
attention of the Navy Department to
the alleged offenses of Superintendent
Cooper and that if an investigation Is
made it will be at his Instance.
Captain Cooper has heard of the
Congressman's complaint through of
ficial sources. He admits that such
charges have been made.
Lack of courtesy and want of discip
line seem to be the basis of the Rep
resentative's complaint to the Secre
tary of the Navy against the Superin
tendent. Captain Cooper explained his
"conduct" in a letter now in the hands
of the Secretary of the Navy.
WESTLAKE FOUND GUILTY.

SALINAS, June 11.â The trial of ex-
Tax Collector Westlake on the third in
dictment for embezzling $371 license
taxes collected in July, 1897, which has
been in progress befure Judge Dooling
the past three days, was concluded at
4:30 this afternoon and given to the
Jury. Before the commencement of the
trial Westlake's attorney asked for a
dismissal of the indictment on the fol
lowing grounds: That he had been ac
quitted on one indictment, convicted on
another and wac ar;ain placed In
Jeopardy. The Judge gave no decision,
but ordered the trial to proceed.
At 8 o'clock this evening, after hav
ing asked for further instructions, the
Jury returned to the court with a ver
dict of guilty. Westlake now stands
convicted of embezzling $321 license
taxes in June and $371 in July. 1897. He
has several similar ones against him

linquent assessment taxes. His attor
neys will appeal to the Supreme Court,

While Hauling a Cannon.
RAN JOSE, June 11.â Henry Starkey,
who with Horace Moody was Injured
last evening while hauling to the Court
house a cannon with which to fire a sa
lute at the clerks' meeting, died this

WASTE WATER
TO SAVE CROPS
Plan of Los Angeles
Farmers.
TO DEVELOP AN UNDERFLOW
ASK FOR PERMISSION TO TAP
THE RIVER.
Business Men Unite With the Agri
culturists in an Appeal
to the City
Council.
Special Dispatch tÂ» The CiUl.
LOS ANGELES, June 11.â An exten
sively signed petition was filed with the
City Clerk to-day by farmers having
small ranches south of the municipal
ity, asking for permission to use for
a time the waste water of Los An
geles River. This water the agricul
turalists need to save their crops this
year and to be provided against future
drought. The plan is to take water
twenty feet below the surface of the
river to develop the underflow which
now goes on to the ocean and Is of no
benefit to any one. The point where
development is to be made Is in the city
limits. It is expected 600 Inches of
water can be obtained. For one hour
each day the petitioners agree to flush
the city's outfall sewer to the sea with
water, and the balance of It they ex
pect to convey by the Zanja system to
their small ranches below the city. The
petitioners agree that any time the city
desires it can revoke the permission
given and If the city itself ever decides
to develop the underflow water of the
river the permission Is revoked.
A petition was filed by a number of
wholesale and retail merchants, asking
that the Council accede to the request,
as it will save thousands of dollars'
worth of crops this year.
This is a rather novel request and as
the petition was filed very late It is dif
ficult to foretell what the action of
the Council will be. A strong: delega
tion of citizens will be on hand on Mon
day to urge Immediate action, for If
this season's crops are to be affected
the work of placing water on thÂ«
planted lands must commence at once.
FLOATING CORPSE FOUND
WITH PINIONED ARMS
Evidence of a Possible Murder Oast
Up by the Waters of East
River.
NEW YORK, June 11. -The body of a
man with his arms pinioned to his side
by a carefully tied and knotted rope was
found floating in the East River at the
foot of East Sixty-second street to-day.
There are bruises on the head, and the
man may have been stunned and thrown
Into the river. The rope was of the kind
used as a line by a tugboat. This was
wound around the body and shoulders
and below the thighs. Ona arm had
worked loose, but the other was- still
pinioned.
The police believe the man is James S
Abritz Jr., who lived at Popular and
Johnson streets, Brooklyn. He was re
ported missing on June 9 and as having
last been seen at noon on June 1. He was
in the milk business with his father
when he disappeared he had $600 in cash
with him, which he had collected from
customers. He was 23 years of age and
his description tallies with that of the
man found lv tae river to-day.
WOODLAND
TO GREET
OUR GIRLS
Native Daughters Will
Meet There.
PLAN OF THE GRAND PARLOR
LIST OF FAIR DELEGATES UP TO
DATE.
Some of the Prospective Transactions
at the Twelfth Annual Session
of the Queens of the
Golden West.
The twelfth annual session of the Grand
Parlor of the Native Daughters of the
Golden West will be held In the city of
Woodland this year, commencing on Tues
day. The local parlor, Woodland No. 90,
through its several committees and the
citizens of that place, have made all ar
rangements for the proper reception of
the delegates and making their stay there
a most pleasant one.
The grand trustees of the body will hold
their last meeting of the term in Wood
land to-morrow sÂ»o as to have their re
port up to the latest moment ready for
presentation on the following day.
The several reports to bo offered will
show that during the year the order has
done well, that there were instituted three
new parlors, Vendome No. 100 at Ban Jose,
Conrad No. 101 at Volcano and Aleta No.
102 at Salinas; that there has been a
g-atn in membership and that there haa
been an increane in finances. They will
also show that the older parlors are this
year in better condition than they were
the previous year, and that the member
ship generally has been more energetic
than it has been for some years. In many
of the older parlors there has been noticed
a great deal of work to the end that the
membership has shown a marked in
crease.
Mrs. Lena H. Mills of Joaquin Parlor
' No. 6, Stockton, the grand vice-president,
' who is in line of promotion, will be
i chosen grand president for the next term,
! as there is no opposition to her for that
j office. There are quite a number who,
I anxious to become grand president !n
I time, will be candidates for the ofttce of
grand vice-president. For the office
Of grand secretary, Mrs. Georgie ('. Ryan,
i the Incumbent, who for a number of
years has proved a faithful and efficient
officer, will undoubtedly he re-elected, aa
there has been no one named other than
herself for the office.
One of the matters that will be promi
nent before the grand body will be the
presentation for adoption of a new ritual
to supercede the one now in use. It is
probable that one which has been pre
pared by Mrs. Ounzendorfer of San Souci
Parlor of San Francisco, said to be a
gem in the line of secret work, will bÂ«
adopted.
The following are the grand officers or
the existing Grand Parlor:
Past grand president, Mrs. Mary E. Tillman,
Pan Francisco; Rrand president, Mrs. Belle W.
Conrad. Sonora; grand vice-president, Mrs.
Lena H. Mills, Stockton; grand secretary, Mrs.

J. J. Clancy, The Call's Special Corre

Many Recent Events of
Interest.
BY J. J. CLANCY.
*'l BLIX. May 25.-The discussion of
the Irish local government bill in com
mittee, was finished on Tuesday night
by a tremendous effort.. Nearly thirty
clauses, with several schedules and
s..Â«ine new clauses, remained to be con
sidered when the House of Commons
laembled for business on Monday
and it seemed to a good many members
4 : the work of dealing with so many
rtona of importance could never be
mptohed before the Whitsuntide
bb. But by suspending the rules
limiting the length of each sitting, by
vontinuing the Monday sitting till
nearly 4 o'clock on the morning of
Tuesday, and by postponing till the re
port stage of the bill a large proportion
f the unsettled points, the committee
â¢ .-.lings were brought to a close not
Qly in time for the Whitsuntide recess,
in time even for Derby day,
"â sday. the 25th. Not much need
"I of the closing days of the dis
â n in committee. The bill has got
igh that stage without any ma
alteration for the worse and al
fcithout any material alteration
â¢ >r tht> better. The Government simply
up their minds that the bill should
substantially as it was when in
ured, and they carried out their re
to the end. Within the last hour
i of the long debate, however, a
â¢ t was opened up in which many
Americans would no doubt be in
â¢ed. By one of the earlier provi
â  >t~ the bill all municipalities which
â¢ not made county boroughs by the
â  uuld be merged in the counties to
h they respectively belotiged,
. h they would still retain their ex-
S municipal governments. The
effect of the measure would -be
it they would cease to have sheriffs,
a they would no longer have assizes
their own, and that they would, in
matters in which they alone have
control, be under the Jurisdiction
â  their respective county councils. By
subsequent provision six boroughs â
I amely, Dublin, Belfast, Cork. Limer-
k. Berry and Waterfordâ were erect
>i into county boroughs, aJI the rest
V>lng thus left out in the cold. It was,
f course, more a matter of sentiment
ihiiii anything else, but Irishmen are

| pected to do was to keen silent. They,
j accordingly, remained away from the
louse of Commons during the speeches
delivered in eulo-y of Gladstone. This
circumstance has been the subject of
adverse comment in the anti-Parnellite
| I>ress, and that section of the Irish
press has, further, found occasion for
I c<) ntrasting the action of the Parnellite
i of Parliament with that of
the Dublin Corporation, which, though
mainly Parnellite, at a meeting held a
few days ago decided to send a deputa
tion to take part in the funeral cere
monies at Westminster to-day. The
whole controversy, however, is but an
' other phase of that which has gone on
in Ireland for the last seven years. De
spite the action of the Dublin Corpor
ation, which was decided on at a meet
ing hastily summoned and small, to
| boot, the Parnellites are ranged on one
j side in this matter and the anti-Par
| nellites on the other, and there is abun
dant evidence that if John Redmond
and his colleagues had taken any other
, course than that actually adopted by
them, they would have been repudiated
,by their supporters in this country.
j There is no need for me here to argue
j the matter, but at least onÂ« point on
I which Parnellites lay stress may be
j mentioned. It is that when Parnell
K'~l Mr. Gladstone took exactly the line
saying nothing about the greatest
h statesman of the century, while
ly of his followers in England by
no means contented themselves with
being merely silent. Possibly if
he and they had taken another course
analogous to that which the Parnellites
are now blamed for not taking, things
would have been different to-day from
what they are.
The '98 celebrations in Ireland com
i menced during the last week. On Sun
day there were demonstrations in
Rathfernhem (County Dublin) and sev
eral other places which were scenes of
action in the insurrection of 100 years
ago, and on Monday night there was
a torchlight procession through the
streets of Dublin. All the nationalist
parties united on each occasion, and
genuine enthusiasm prevailed. The
speeches delivered at the various meet
ings showed at least one thing, namely,
that the concession of local self-gov
ernment to Ireland, which Is now about
to be made, will not have the effect of
blotting out the past or doing away
with tho desire for a full measure of
Irish freedom. That desire may not find
full expression just now, but that it
exists and will continue to exist is ab
solutely certain. Meanwhile, it is great
ly feared in nationalist circles that the
American-Spanish war will deprive the
* celebrations of what promised to be
most notable feature â the presence
them of representative Irish-Ameri
cans. The advent of deputations from
the States has been looked forward to
for months paÃt with the liveliest sat
isfaction, and the mere mention of the
cirmucstance at popular gatherings,
whether in Dublin or in the provinces,
has invariably aroused a furor of en
thusiasm. It has also, I rather fancy,
greatly exercised the minds of Govern
ment officials who never like to see
Irish-Americans in Ireland, for politi
cal purposes, or even for purposes only
remotely connected with politics.
Tw.-nty-flve or thirty years ago, in the
Fenian times, a broad-leaved felt hat
and a pair of square-toed boots were,
in the eyes of the agents of Dublin
Castle, a reason for reasonable suspi
cion as to the wearer's loyalty, and not
withstanding all the talk of an Anglo-
American alliance, 1 fancy that the
same suspicion would to-day be
aroused in Dublin Castle by the advent
of Irish-Americans in large numbers to
the shores of Ireland. Of course, there
is now no law to enable arrests on sus
picion to be made, and in any case
the rulers of Ireland would to-day hes
itate to interfere in any way with Irish-
Americans on Irish soil; so that In
coming over here this summer, even
though avowedly for the purpose of
taking part in the '98 celebrations,
Irish-Americans will not run any risk
of disagreeable consequences, however
much Dublin Castle may be perturbed
by theif presence.
For the past few years a considerable
part of the business in the Superior
Courts of law in Dublin has been con
nected in one way or another with the
cycle trade. It was a Dublin man named
Dunlop whose invention of the pneu
matic tire may be said to have revolu
tionized the whole cycle industry in
these kingdoms. Mr. Dunlop himself
made, of course, a considerable sum out
of his invention, but others in Dublin
made a great deal more, among whom
the now world-known Messrs. Ducros,
Charles Wisdom Healy and a Dr. Fred
erick McCabe are the most notable.
Harvey Ducros and his son of the same
name, from having occupied a very
humble position, suddenly â that is to
say in the course of a very few years â
developed into men of what would be
considered, even in America, vast
wealth, and began to live in very con
siderable style in the suburbs of Dublin.
Nor were there wanting Instances of
persons like city clerks making smaller
but still respectable fortunes by cycle
share speculations. The result was that
Dublin became smitten, sn to say, with
the cycle share fever. Company after
company was floated here, and not one
of them ever failed to procure enough
money from Dublin alone. The Irish
capital, in fact, became the favorite
hunting ground for the cycle company
promoter.
For a time things went on all right,
but of late the reverse may be said t
be the case. Some few months ag
Mr. Dunlop recovered judgment her
for the sum of Â£14,000, profit which h
ought to have made on a sale of 200(
cycle shares, but of which he alleged
that he had been deprived by the mis
representations of Dr. McCabe, who, i
appears, was acting as the agent o
Mr. Ducros. A few weeks ago another
action was instituted against Mr. Du
cros and one or two others by a person
who alleged that he had been induced,
also by misrepresentation, to speculate
in the shares of one of the smaller com
panies floated by the Ducros group, and
the result was that the defendants were
ordered to refund a very large sum of
money. Finally, eighteen similar ac
tions have just been commenced
against the same defendants and
against the famous E. T. Hooley, all of
which will be tried next month in the
Four Courts, unless in the meantime
full satisfaction is made. Of this there
seems to be some probability, for tho
latest rumor on the subject Is that the
directors of the company, the share
holders in which are looking for their
money Jn this unpleasant way, have of
f< red to buy up all the original holders
of shares at par. But however the mat
ter ends in the law courts Dublin will
have ceased in all probability from
henceforward to be the great market
for cycle chares which it has been for
the last few years. And, surely, it will
have done bo none too soon.

Firemen Burned and Cut by Glass
While Fighting a Blaze.
DETROIT, June 11.â Fire early to-day
destroyed the Case power building ow â 
Congress street west, with all its con

business structures in this city. The total I
loss will be upward of $200 000. It is not I
believed the insurance will exceed two- 'â 
thirds of this. Six firemen were severely
burned and cut by glass.
George G. Case valued his building at
$100,000, and it is insured for over half that
value. The loss <>n machinery and con

about $100,000, the greatest suftVrt r being i

ONE HEYMAN TRACT EXAMPLE
(ONLY ONE OF MANY).
Yesterday a man paid his last Installment
on a home we built for him six years ago.
Just think how much better off. how very
much better off. is this man than any of
you rent payers. The money he used to
throw away in rents has in six short years
given him a modern 5-room and bath cot-
tage and lot. Your money that you are
throwing away in rents and will continue
to throw away as long as you rent, will
never bring you one cent's worth of any-
thing valuable. Our friend of the newly
paid for home can dispose of his property:
you couldn't even find a person who would
have any use for your bundle of receipts
even as a gift To sum it up. this man
whose good example we are advising you
to follow, instead of paying rent for six
years, has paid for a home and finds him-
self able to put away In the bank now the
money he used to pay out to the landlord.
We have the same opportunity to offer to
rent payersâ the fame cozy, modern homes
that may be bought for the rent money
they are now parting with. Take a ride
out to the Heyman Tract and make an in-
spection. Take Mission-St. cars, transfer
to Twenty-second, to Hoffman avenue, and
ask for Mr. James Cotter, resident agent,
who will show you the property. JACOB
HEYMAN, 11 Montgomery st, will give you
all particulars.

MEET TO TRY TO STRAIGHTEN
THINGS.
The Pacifies Drop an Honorary Mem
ber and Retire .a Delegate â Im
portant Decisions and Plans.
The directors of the San Francisco Ken
nel Club mot on Thursday last to deter
mine on their attitude toward the Pacific
Advisory Board as at present constituted.
The P. A. 8., as the board is known fa
miliarly, is under a cloud temporarily, a
petiticfn for its disbandment having been
presented to the American Kennel Club
by the delegate of the Sai. Francisco
Club, Colojiel C. B. Knocker. The only
decision- arrived at by the latter dub was
to continue the status quo until Colonel
Knocker's charges had been adjudicated
by the A. K. I .
The Pacific Advisory Board held a meet
ing the same night, or rather some of the
members did so. for. as usual, a quorum
was lacking. The members present decid
ed, informally and Individually, that they
would ignore Colonel Knocker's charges
altogether.
The Pacific Mastiff Club neld Its
monthly meeting last night, and its
meeting was enlivened by growls. A i"og
belonging to a new member. L. W. Neu
stader's Tiger, was discussed and the
points awarded him according to the club
standard. The judging as tar as accom
plished took in, first, general character
and symmetry (maximum U points); sec
ond, general description of head and gen
eral description of body (maximum 10
points)' third, skull (maximum 10 points).
The judging will be continued at the next
meeting.
Dr. C. A. Longest of Boston. Mass.,
was elected an honorary member.
Erastus Hamilton of New York was de
clared to have forfeited his honorary
membership. It was also resolved that
the office of delegate to the American
Kennel Club was vacant, fcj\ Hamilton
having forfeited the same by reason of
inefficiency.
Dr. F. W. d'Evelyn, the president of the
club, was unanimously elected as a com
mittee of one to select a new delegate
for nomination to the club.

GENERAL BARILLAS LOSES
HIS VAST FORTUNE
SQUANDERS HIS PATRIMONY
ON A FAIR SAN FRANCISCAN.
An Estate of Nearly Five Millions
Seized to Satisfy Claims of
Creditors.
Ex-Presldent Barillas of Guatemala,
whose gay career and spendthrift habits
are familiar to the people of two conti
nents and whose penchant for lavishing
money on his lady-loves was notorious,
is again before the public, notwithstand
ing his retirement from public life to one
of his many estates in his native coun
try.
His reappearance comes through the re
port just made public by the committee
of creditors who took his immense prop
erties in hand last year for the purpose
of protecting his creditors. It is a plain
business statement, but it shows that the
general not only had "money to burn,"
hut that he indulged in that expensive
pastime in an amazing way.
While he is supposed to have had many
friends among the fair sex, his downfall
is attributed largely to the princely fash
ion in which he squandered his fortune
upon Miss May Taber, an attractive and
lively young woman of this city. His
greatest escapade with this damsel was a
pyrotechnic tour of Europe, during which
he literally threw money away in efforts
to please his companion.
Some of his largest creditors, knowing
his reckless conduct and fearing he would
dissipate his entire fortune, took meas
ures to force him into liquidation.
Barillas' entire properties came into
the possession of a committee of three
leading bankers of Guatemala, consisting
of Carlos Sauerberg, G. Mohr and Gustav
Meyer, as trustees for ail the creditors.
While their reports show that the general
is still solvent, it is nevertheless a start
ling exposition of his lack of business
tact and disregard of ordinary business
rules.
On the 20th of May last the appraised
value of hi 6 estate was $5,985,166 68, but
at that time the millionaire had only
$52 05 in cash. He certainly knew how to
borrow money, with or without security,
as shown by the fact that in Guatemala
he. owes $4,7(59,0t50. of which only $3,008,451 62
is secured, leaving an unsecured indebt
edness of $1,700,609 19. All these vast
claims are held by twenty-three credi
tors.
In San Francisco there are several firms
that take a painful interest in the settle
ment of the general's estate, the principal
ones being: Castle Bros., $121,205 50; P.
Vrruela & Co., $1817 92; E. 1... G. Steele &
Co., $16,767 67: aggregating $139,791 09. It
will be seen that the easy-going ex-Presi
dent succeeded in piling up a grand total
debit account of $4,845,851 90.
Barillas, though having nothing to do
with the handling of his estate, is allowed
an annual income of $12,000, American
money. He is still attached to his
charming young lady friend, who shares
his misfortunes in a hacienda a short dis
tance from the home of Mrs. Barillas.
The creditors hope that by proper man
agement the assets will be sufficient to
pay all claims, and there may be a sur
plus to turn over to the ex-President with
which to begin life anew.
THE BOY PIANIST.
Master Hassell Pleases a Large and
Critical Audience.
The Invitation recital given by the
I youthful pianist, Irwin Eveleth Hassell,
at Sherman-Clay Hall yesterday after
â¢ noon was attended by a large and criti
! cal audience, many ot" the most prominent
! professional and amateur musicians of the
I city being present. The young artist made
a very favorable impression, his execution
I being declared remarkable. The feature
1 of his playing which called forth much
I flattering comment was his masterful left
I hand movement. He executed the most
I difficult passages in a long and classical
programme with apparenr ea^e, and re
sponded to the kind reception of his ef
forts with a good imitation of a Pader
i ewski DOW. While delicate in appearance,
i there was no apparent lack of power in
his handling of the instrument. However,
I he pleases more In the lighter and softer
parts, into which he brought considerable
I grace and expression. It must be said,
however, that nis playing has too much
lof the mechanical. Still, maturer years
: and education may obviate this fault. The
; lad certainly possesses a wonderful mem
ory, as he rendered the entire programme
â  without the score. Probably the most
! interested auditor was little Paloma
1 Schramm. the prodigy who made such a
successful debut in this city recently. She
evidently enjoyed the entertainment, and
1 made wnispered comments upon the more
difficult passages. Master Hassell was as
sisted by Miss Alma Berglund, soprano;
I hurl Bettman, concert-meis.ter: Mrs. M.
'â  Cameron Smith and F. L. King, director.
! An orchestra of twenty-one pieces from
! the Symphony Society furnished the ac
i companimetit to the last_ number. Men

THE PRINTERS' STRIKE.
It Will Probably Be Called Off Dur
ing the Coming Week.
A special meeting of the Typographical
Union will he held in the Shiels building
this afternoon, when propositions for ter
minating the strike will be considered.
At the last two meetings of the union
motions to declare the strike off have
been overwhelmingly defeated, but it is
generally expected that some definite
plan of settlement will be arranged to
day. All through the strike the union
has been badly handicapped for want of
sufficient money, although there has al
ways be^n enough to pay the strike bene
fits fn>m week to week. The only direct
source of income has been a 15 per cent
weekly assessment on all earnings, the
balance of the funds having been ob
tained by spasmodic donations from out
side unions.
Very few of the strikers have broken
their obligations and gone back to work.
A % few have procured employment out
side the business, and others have left
the city permanently. The great major
ity, however, have been in camp, where
they could live cjieaply and were out of
the way of temptation to go back to
work.
Many plans for calling the strike off
without breaking the power of the union
in the book and job offices have been sug
gested, the most popular of which is to
declare the ten-hour offices "open" of
fices and give the men the privilege of
working in them on a compromise scale
which will not put the nine-hour offices
into unfair competition, and if an agree
ment can be made with the proprietors
this plan will probably be carried out
during the coming week.
TRYING TO REMOVE HIM.
An Effort to Have Consul Carillo Re
called for Alleged Treasonable
It Is rumored that charges have heen
filed against Miguel Carillo, local Consul
for Guatemala, for utterances which at
the. present time are considered danger
ous. He is accused of having openly
boasted of being a blue-blooded Spaniard
and a descendant of a noble Castilian
family, and, moreover, of being proud
of that distinction. According to the
rumor residents of Guatemala, who are
staying in this city, have filed affidavits
with the home Government with a view
to having him recalled.
The friends of the accused Consul have
placed a different interpretation on the
actions of those who are trying to pro
cure his undoing. They say that Carillo
was a warm friend and earnest supporter
of Barrios, and during the latter's reign
took an active part in the management
of the republic, during which time he
Incurred many enmities: that since the
assassination of President Barrios an
other political party has sprung up. to
which the local Consul is persona non
grata. They have, therefore, falsely
filed these charges of unpatriotic and
undiplomatic utterances with a sole view
to having another appointed in his stead.
Foresters' Relief Society.
At a meeting of the Companions of
the Forest of America In thp Alcazar
the preliminary steps were taken to or
ganize a relief society to be composed of
Companions and of Foresters, which shall
have for its object the furnishing cnm :
forts to soldiers who shall go to the front
and the caring for the dependents of For
esters who have enlisted and who may be
In need. It Is proposed to ask each court
and circle to contribute $5 to a fund and
then ask each Forester to contribute 10
cents a month during the wu. As there
are 6000 Foresters and 1600 Companions in
the State quite a handsome sum will be
realized.

MYSTERY ON THE
EL CAMPO SHORE
A WOMAN'S CLOTHES STREWN
ABOUT THE BEACH.
Discovery of Charles White While
Searching for the Body of His
Friend.
Whilejooking for the body :.f his ("lead
friend. Edward Boyle, who was drowned
last Sunday, Charles White discovered
yesterday afternoon on the beach a mile
and a half from El Campo, a lot of
woman's clothes strewn about the sand.
A careful examination was made of the
surrounding country, but nothing was
found which would in any 'vay give a
clew to the presence of the clothes on the
beach. They consisted of undergarments j
and were of good quality. From their
proximity to the water White is of the
opinion that the washing of tho water on
the beach had carried off other article.,
of dress, and that which he discovered
was but a portion of what was originally
left on the shore.
White started from El Campo In a
Whitehall and rowed down the bay
toward Tiburon. When about a mile and
a half from El Campo landing, his atten
tion was calied to a number of dark-look-
Ing objects on the beach, and he landed
for the purpose of finding out what they
were. To him the soggy clothes seemed
to conceal some mystery, and after a
careful examination he returned to El '
Campo, where a picnic was being held by
tne bt. Francis Church. There he told i
one of his friends of his discovery To- |
gether they rowed back to the scene of !
tn,e mysterious clothing, and another
search was made by the two young men
without results.
Tho clothing is in good condition save
for the damaging effect of the water. No !
tears or stains of any kind were noticed '
by the young men. who are strong in the :
conviction that they are evidence of a
suicide.

After being out sixteen hours the Jury
Jn the case of Samuel W. Elliott against
the Southern Pacific Company was un
able to reach a verdict and was this
n;orning discharged by Judge Greene.
The jury had less legal material upon
which to form a Judgment than any other
railroad case ever tried in this county.
Late last night the Jury was sent for by
the court, but as it was unable to arrive
at any decision it was locked up until this
morning. When court convened Judge
Greene again sent for the Jurors, and as
they were all convinced that they could
not arrive at a unanimous decision they
were discharged.
In the instructions to the Jury and in
the closing arguments of counsel nothing
was brought out that could throw much
light on the purely legal aspect of the
case. No precedent could be found for
it, and consequently a new principle will
have to be laid down for its decision,
shouW the case be tried again.
Elliott sued for damages for being
thrown off the train Dy a conductor. It
was not denied by the company that El
liott was put off the train with necessary
force, but it was alleged by the defend
ant that Elliott's ticket had expired and
that he was given every opportunity to
pet off peaceably before being assisted
by the conductor. Elliott's ticket expired
â¢ Its time limit during the great strike
of 1894. His counsel contended that as
the ticket entitled the holder to a ride to
the point i"'>r which it was issued Elliott
was entitled to the ride, although the
time named on the ticket had passed.
It was shown by the railroad company
that Elliott had not taken the first op
portunity offered to ride from Oakland to
Pleasanton, but that he waited a full
mouth before presenting his ticket. They
also showed that on account of the strike
a certain extension of time was granted
holders of limited tickets. This conces
sion was tak^n hold of by the plaintiff
NEWS OF THE MINES.
A Glance at the Enormous
Mineral Product of
the Country.
The New Mills and Mines That
the State Displays in the
Midst of War.
The Call has within a few days pub
lished the official statement of the min
eral products of California for 1897. Now
comes the similar statement for the
United States for tne year, showing a
gradual but a considerable and mighty
general advance aa compared with IS&6
and all previous years.
The United States mint is the author
ity on the production of the precious met
als, and a department of the United
States Geological Survey promulgates
statements of mineral production, but
probably the highest authority regarding
the entire field of mineral production in
United States territory is currently the
Mineral Industry, published in a large
volume annually by the Engineering and
Mining Journal of New York. The jour
nal mentioned gave out a preliminary es
timate of the product in January. Now
from advance sheets of the Mineral In
dustry, which will be published in a few
weeks, come the iirst reliable statistics
for the past year.
The total mineral product of the United
States in 185*7 was (746,230.982. In 1896 it
was Â»737,!Â»5,7b1. The Increase for the year
is thus a considerable one. These tigures
include only raw products, and is limited
to ores and to metals reduced from ores.
It does not include the enormous values
of manufactured mineral products. The
total also excludes Imports of ores and
metals, chiefly from Canada and Mexico,
refined in the United States, the value of
which is placed at $47,127,174.
In the list of mineral products of the
United States seventy-seven are classed
as non-metallic and twelve as metals.
California, by the way, produces thirty
three of these commercial substances a
far greater variety than is afforded by
any other State. .; v"
It is interesting to note that the pro
duction of aluminum was 4,0u0,000 pounds,
valued at $1,400,000, while in 18% the prod
uct was 1,300,000, valued at $520,000. The
Increase was due to cheaper prices, in
creasing uses and Increased export trade.

to show that the ticket, being a contract,
if the railroad company could extend the
time beyond that for which it was issued,
the inference would be that Elliott would
be at liberty to still further extend the
time to suit convenience.
The case was bitterly fought between
Attorney A. A. Moore, representing the
railroad company, and Attorney Lesssin
sky of San Francisco, representing the
Slain tiff. During the closing argument
lr. Moore made some bitter personal re
marks regarding opposing counsel, which
Mr. l.eszinaky at once branded as lies,
and the court reprimanded Mr. Moore.
The case will probably be tried again.
Leszinsky offered to submit the case on
new trial to Judge Greene on the evi
dence before the jury and take his deci
sion, but Mr. Moore' said he would have
to consider that proposition.
LEFT ALL TO HIS DAUGHTER.
A Large Fortune Left by Joseph
Bassi Goes to Mrs. Emilia
Sigress.
OAKLAND, June 11.â The will of the
late Joseph Bassi was filed for probate
this afternoon by George Roeth and A.
P. Sartori, who are named in it as exec
utors without bonds. The dtceased died
May 2^th. His will bears date nf Febru
ary 5, 1896.
The estate is valued at $80.<K>0 1 and con
sists of real estate and personal property
in about equal proportions. His brother
is left $2000, and each of the nieces and
nephews is remembered in the aggregate
amount of $3000.
The balance of the estate, real and per
sonal, is left to an adopted daughter, Mrs.
Emilia Rassi Sigress. Her husband is a
popular employe of the Telegraph-avenue
electric line. The home place, situated at
Temescal, is in good repair, and occupies
a very picturesque location. -The de
ceased's wife recently died, hence the
daughter secures it nil.
City Contracts Awarded.
OAKLAND. June 11.â The Board of
Public Works met this morning to let the
contracts on bids received last Wednes
day. J. M. Shay secured the job of build
ing the West Oakland engine house for
$9642. While the work is being done the
car barns at Fourteenth and Peralta
streets will be used by the department.
R. W. Merrick will continue to supply
the bread to the city prisoners at 2H cents
per pound. Rice & White secured the
meat contract for ZVt cents per pound.
The Oakland Enquirer secured the public

Lost Her Left Arm.
OAKLAND, June 11.â While feeding a
mangier in the Contra Costa Laundry
this morning. Miss Daisy Johnson, a 15
year-old folder, had her left hand caught
between the rollers and her arm drawn
into the machine. The flnperp, wrist and
arm were torn clean of flesh and mus
cles. She was removed to the Receiv
ing Hospital, where the arm was ampu
tated. Miss Johnson ia the sole support
of a widowed mother, residing on Six
teenth street, near Peralta,
Now a Soldier's Wife.
OAKLAND, June 11.â Private Frank R.
Caldwell, of Harrison, Idaho, called at
the County Clerk's office to-night just
before 5 o'clock and secured a license to
wed Miss Edith Chick of this city. They
immediately went to Rev. R. Richies and
were made husband and wife. The bride
is a native of Maine, aged 19 years. The
husband is 32.
Commission are. of course, too full of '
war duties to even recall now that such
a thing as restraining dame are contem
plated. There will be little use In talking
about those restraining dams while the
war lasts. But meantime a subordinate
and a few men are still at work explor-
Ing possible foundations for dams, and
when the war is over and the Federal
engineers return to the ways of peace
they will have a few more items of data
for their plans and report when they get
around to them.
The Fresno Republican gives this brief
glimpse at one of the latest of those little
local "rushes" that happen here and
there now and then: "The Trimmer
Springs mining excitement ia abating
somewhat in Selma as several prospec
tors have returned home and do not give
glowing reports of the camp. It Is be
lieved that the gold in that section is con
fined to the one pocket that was first dis
covered."
From the current issue of the Amador
i Republican the following notes of lead
â¢ ing mines in Amador County are gained.
It is reported Jhat work will be resumed
jat the Alma under new management
I after the annual meeting in July. The
; South Eureka is now a dividend-p^yer,
' and with enlargement and development
in depth will be one of the great mines of
that region. Some fast sinking has been
done in the Central Eureka â feet in
i one month at a cost of $8 50 a foot. There
is a report of another great strike in the
: Gwin mine. The Argonaut has declared
i Dividend No. 4 of $20,000, making a total
iof $60,000. Besides this, the company has
| a cash surplus of over $SO,OOO in bank, to
; gether with over $20,000 worth of rock on
the dump, and $10,000 worth of sulphur
ets on hand, making their surplus over
i flM),00V; not a bad showing for a mine
I which started its mill only six months
1 ago. The Zella mill will soon close
temporarily while the old shaft is sunk
200 leet deeper.
The latest operations of the Mountain
Copper Company, which increased Cali
fornia's copper product seven fold In IÂ»y7,
are thus described by the Redding
Searchlight:
"The big smelters at Keswick are all in
full blast. Ground is being prepared, ex
: tending the roasting surface, and the fa
; cilities about the big plant are undergo
! ing constant improvement. The large
! pumping plant on the river above the
: mouth of Spring Creek will be in opera
i tion in two weeks, and thereafter no de
; lays will result for a lack of water sup
ply. To protect the works against acci
! dent a duplicate system of pumps and
engines has been placed in position. The
new matte furnace, used to reduce the
matte product of the water Jacket fur
| naces, has Just completed a very sue-
I cessful run. This resmelting of the matte
j increases the percentage of value and re
! duces the freight charges across the con
; tinent to the refineries. At the mine a
â¢ larger force of men is at present em
ployed than ever before. The product of
i the mine has been largely increased to
i supply the smelting capacity. Power
1 drills are being placed in position on the
i Hornet claim."
A. W. and W. J. Dale of Cloverdale,
who were among the Coffee Creek rush
ers of last year, are returning there with
a mill and mining supplies for a property
secured in that region.
Brown & Reeder, who were in Yreka a
week ago with over $2100 from a week's
run of their little mill at Shasta River in

I trie light plant, have taken out $1800 more
i in only a day and a half run of the mill
j since. They have one vof the richest

I the more it is developed the richer it
seems to pay.â Yreka Journal.
The Crescent City Record says a letter
from Orleans Bar. on the Klamalh River,
states that very ; few men are employed in
the mines .thereabouts. tThe scarcity of

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 12, 1898.
SHAM BATTLE
ON THE FOURTH
Oakland Will Celebrate
as Never Before.
BOARD OF TRADE WORKING
MAYOR THOMAS FAVORS THE
MILITARY IDEA.
Chief of Police Fletcher Gives Some
Good Reasons Why All the
Nation Should
Rejoice.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 11.
Efforts are being made by the Oakland
Board of Trade to have a sham battle
in thlÃ city on the Fourth of July. During
the past week public sentiment has been
canvassed, and there is a decided desire
to have a proper celebration of the na
tional holiday. This morning the Board
of Trade held a special meeting and de
cided to take the preliminary steps to
have a military display on Adams Point.
A committee was' appointed to confei
with the authorities on the other side of
the bay for the purpose of arranging to
have two regiments come to this city
and fight a sham battle for the edifica
tion of Alameda County. Should the re
quest be granted Oakland will give the
soldiers a rousing reception and will
banquet them in regal style.
It Is not yet certain that there will not
be a great parade on the Fourth, but the
Board of Trade believes that with so
much military enthusiasm among the peo
ple it will be more appropriate and more
in keeping with current events to have
a purely military display.
Mayor Thomas favors the idea, and is
very emphatic in his opinion that theru
should be a big celebration of some kind.
"If ever there was a time," eaid the
Mayor to-day, "when the Fourth of July
should be fittingly observed, it is surely
now. To my mind, the Fourth succeed
ing the incident at Appomattox Court
house was not more worthy of celebra
tion than tire coming national birthday.
I would like to see all the display possi
ble, and I am sure that every citizeit
must feel as I do. The idea of bringing
troops over is a good one, and if our
local companies should also engage in an>
display that may be decided upon, it
would add greatly to the general inter
est."
Chief of Police Fletcher Is very en
thusiastic on the subject. He believes
that nearly all the population of the
county could be gathered in Oakland this
tablished between Castella and the mine,
and the camp Is in a flourishing condi
tion.âRedding Searchlight.
The organization of a company is an
: nounred, that will begin work on the Ida
i Mitcheil and Gold Bug quartz properties
i In the heart of the town of Placerville.
Both properties have yielded considerable
gold, but were never worked to any great
depth nor with much system.
Kx-Governor 11. H. Markham of Pasa
dena, who is connected with the American
Girl mine in the Golden -'ross district,
San Diego County, expresses himself as
pleased over the prospects of the mine,
says the Los Angeles Record. At pres
ent he Is erecting a new process twenty
stamp mill on the mine, on which a great
deal of development work has been done.
He proposes to crush the ore dry and
treat it with the cyanide process first,
then If hte tailings still carry gold the
plates will be utilized, thus making an
absolute saving of all the gold the ore
carries. In case his first intention does
not pan out the mill can be easily
chang-ed to the wet process.
The Barstow fifty-stamp custom mill is
expected to start this week, but it will
probably be some days before it will be
in regular operation. The mill people have
been buying ore for some time.
A mill for treating ore by the cyanide
process is being erected at Mojftve. It
will have a capacity of twenty tons per
day at first, but will be enlarged as the
mines are developed. The ore to be work
ed will come from tne buttes that rise up
out of the desert a few miles east of Mo
jave. The assay office is now up and
lumber is on the ground for the mill
proper.â Kern County Echo.
On Thursday morning the. Forest Hill
Gold Mining Company started up Its mill
on what was formerly called the Old
Spanish mine. To their mill has lately
been added a cyanide plant to control
rebellious ores. They are working, about
thirty tons a day, that average from $8 to
$10 per ton. The mill is run by water
power, and consequently very cheaply.
It is the intention of the company to en
large its plant to the capacity of the
Mercur mine in Utah. The Mercur com
pany, on a similar process, works SO ore
at a profit of $4. The company's ledge at
Forest Hill is over fifty feet In width, with
gold all the way through it, but it is the
Intention of the owners to work only the
rich chutes and those the most easily
handled.
The value of this property has been
known for thirty years, but owing to the
rebellious character of the ores It can
only be worked by the cyanide process.
I ere are millions of tons of ore in sight, ;
lch, though it may be partially low
ide will now make a good and steady
Id, and the property is destined to be
come one of the best in the State.â Repub-
California Band, published at Jo
hannesburg, Kern County, trpts out an
other one of those California nuggets
which still glitter forth frequently with
out attracting much notice because they
do not come from the Klondike. That pa
per says: Frank Fleming was in town
Sunday and Monday. He showed tho
! boys a big nugget that weighed $315
i which would sell for much more. In
i fact one of our citizens offered him $400
I for It He found this nugget some months
! ago while dry washing near here, and has
had much better luck than the average
! dry washer, as was seen by a big roll of
greenbacks he was carrying.
The Rand also says: The three-stamp
mill at the Little Butte mine began oper
ations yesterday. It Is expected that $3
ore can be handled with considerable
profit to the owners of the mine. A three-
I stnmp mill will be put up at Radamacher,
I nenr Higgins' wells, on Walker's wells,
Ito mill and do custom work. The Rand
j mine Is putting on more men all the
time. Many were laid off when the mills
1 at Garloek were shut down because they
' were not needed. Much building Is going
1 on nt the Rand, the big ore bin looming
;up like a great monument. The changing
! house Is done.

Fourth of July if a proper observance
of the day be arranged. "Of all years,"
paid he, "this is the one to celebrate.
It is not only right to make a demonstra
tion to celebrate the victory of American
arms abroad, but with the eyes of the
world upon us, it is a good time to let
them see that however much we may
differ politically, we are a unit as a na
tion and can rejoice in harmony. I be
lieve that if there should be any falling
off in the observance of this Fourth or
July European nations would con
strue It as indicating a lack of unanimity
regarding the present war. There is
enough patriotism in Oakland to turn the
whole county upside down, and it should
be given a chance to explode itself. I
feel like letting off firecrackers all day
long myself." And as nearly all Oakland
feels the same way, there is no doubt
but there will be a noisy time on the
Fourth.

COWARD SENT
TO STOCKTON
His Mind Deranged With
Religious Subjects.
OPPOSED TO CORPORATIONS
WAS A MEMBER OF ANTI-FTJND
ING COMMITTEE.
Went Insane Suddenly as He Was
Crossing the Bay With His
Wife and Friends ou
the Ferry.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 11.
William P. Coward, the San Francisco
merchant, who became suddenly insane
last night while crossing the bay, was
committed to Stockton to-day. This is
the second time he has been sent to a
State hospital.
The examination of Mr. Coward shows
that his mind is considerably disturbed
over religion and also corporations. He
was one of the committee of fifty that
worked so energetically in San Francisco
about a year ago to secure the defeat of
the funding bill. He told the doctors to
day that he would like to solve several
religious problems and also spoke at
great length of the oppression of corpor
ate interests in California, The fit of
violence which overtook him last night
had disappeared by the time he was
brought to the Receiving Hospital, and he
was quite calm, but the doctors had no
difficulty in arriving at the conclusion
that he was insane.
Mr. Coward is a partner in the firm of
Center & Spader of 11 Montgomery street,
San Francisco, and has been in business
for many years. Last night he left San
Francisco for his Oakland home, having
for companions his wife. Congressman
Caminetti and H. P. Draper, a nephew.
At Thirteenth street and Broadway, Mr.
Coward, who had been very noisy on the
boat and train, ordered all his friends,
except his wife, to leave the car, and
with her he rode to Hay wards. The
matter was reported to the County Jail,
and constables were sent out to arrest
him, as- it was feared he might harm his
wife.
At Stone's ranch, between San Leandro
and Haywards, Coward and his wife left
the car, but later they journeyed on till
they reached the end of the line, which is
the Clubhouse at Haywards. About mid
night he was placed under arrest and
brought In to the Receiving Hospital.
About eight months ago Mr. Coward's
mind first gave way. On that occasion he
left his home and wandered about aim
was a supernumerary, and to him fell the
role of the player who pours the deadly
! fluid in the ear of the King, who was to
! his brother as Hyperion to a satyr. The
, following story Is told by Kierns and cor
roborated by Clement:
It was In the scene where the King and
| Queen are sitting on the throne awaiting
i the entertainment of the players fur-
I nished by Hamlet for the purpose of
i catching the conscience of the King.
Everything had progressed without hitch
or <lelay, the sleeping King of the show
I within a show was resting peacefully,
I when Kierns received the cue to do his
; deadly work. Standing in the wings he
i grabbed the phial supposed to contain the
; poison from the property clerk and rush
i ed on the stage. Over the reclining body
|he began his speech, "Thought's black
hands apt, druga fit and time agreeing."
and then removing the stopper from the
i bottle all colored with black he tilted the
i contents into the ear of the sleeper. To
his horror he discovered that instead of
a painted bottle this one really contained
ink. With a jump and a howl the sleev
ing player cleared the improvised stage
and stood in the center of the group of
characters dumfounded, a stream of
black coursing down his face. Hamlet's
i uncle, a portly man, sitting upon the
! throne could not restrain himself and
I shook with laughter. An economy of
; size had been observed in the construc
1 tion of the throne and there was just
i room enough on it with crowding for the
; chair of the King and Queen. The vibra
tions of laughter caused by the King's
merriment loosened his chair and over it
went. Attempting to save himself the
j Kintf laid hold of the Queen's chair and
! that went, too. For a few minutes every
j thing was in dire confusion. Kierns real
| ized that his cue was to put a distance
I between himself and Clement. This he
did by finding an obscure place in the
"flies," from which he did not descend
until after the performance. Since that
; time Clement and Hamlet have been di
vorced.

THE CITY SUED.
Cohen Family Wants Pay for Trees
Cut Down by Order of the
City Trustees.
ALAMEDA, June 11.â Donald G. Cohen,
for himself and as assignee of the other
Cohen heirs, has sued the city of Ala
meda for $1590, the alleged value of 318
cords of wood, and $600 for compensation
to himself in looking after the same
wood.
Eight or nine years ago It was discov
ered that the eucalyptus trees which were
then plentiful in this city were becoming
a great nuisance, and the Trustees, in
response to public demand, passed an or
dinance that whenever the majority of
property owners on any street along
which such trees were planted petitioned
to have them removed it should be done.
About a year ago the Trustees, under this
ordinance, directed the removal of some
trees on Lincoln avenue and Pearl street,
bordering on the Cohen property. The
Cohens refused to cut the trees down,
and took the matter to the Superior
Court. The ordinance was declared valid,
and then the Cohens were again notified
to remove the trees. As they did not do
so, after due time had elapsed, the Street
Superintendent employed men and had
thorn cut down. While this was being
done Donald Cohen assaulted one of the
men and was arrested for it. He then
carried off all the wood that he could,
and the remainder was stored In the cor
poration yard.
There were seventy-five cords of it, and
it was put up at auction yesterday, after
being advertised for sale. It brought $50â
or about 75 cents a cord. Now the Cohens
want the city to pay them $5 a cord for
the 318 cords, though the authorities had
no such amount.
The Burial of Williams.
ALAMEDA, June 11.â The story that
; there was anything mysterious about the
j burial of Hugh Webster Williams, who
i was killed by the Gregory's, is laughed
i at by Deputy Coroner Fowler, who had
I charge of it. The fact is that an cm
i ploye of the Washburn-Moen Company
jof San Francisco, where deceased
I worked, came over here and ordered a
$C 5 funeral, including $15 for a cemetery
i lot, and paid the money for It. He di
â¢ reeled that the receipt should be sent
i to Mr. (not Sir) Arthur Bellamy, London,
as that address was found in Williams'
â  possession on correspondence which
showed that he was a relative. That is
i all there is to the whole thing.

SACRAMENTO
GETS THE
CONVENTION
Santa Cruz Her Only Com
petitor for the Demo=
cratic Gathering.
Time Not Fixed, Because Fusion
Promoters Have Not Yet Settled
Their Differences.
Racramento has been named as the
place where th>- next Democratic State
convention is to be held. This was de
cided at a meeting of the State Central
Committee held yesterday at the Cali
fornia Hotel.
The date at which the convention is
to bp hold is not fixed, for the
reason that the Democratic party
has not yet surrendered all hope
of fusion with the Populists
and Silver Republican parties, and it
is hoped that delay in fixing the date
of the convention will erive the pro
moters of fusion time In which to come
to some agreement.
The selection of a place for the hold
ing of the convention developed a
strong rivalry between Sacramento and
Santa Cruz, and for more than an hour
the attention of the committee was
taken up by the orators to whom was
delegated the task of setting forth the
various reasons why one place or the
other should be selected. San Francisco
was also placed in the list of contest
ants, but the local delegation in the
committee showed no inclination to
support the claims of the metropolis,
and the name was withdrawn before
the question came to a vote. The Los
Ancreles delegation was prepared to
votp for San Francisco, but when it
became apparent that the convention
was not wanted here they took their
choice between the two remaining can
didates, some voting for Sacramento
and others for Santa Cruz.
As booh as the committee was called
to order and Chairman Alford had
stated that tho object of the meeting
was thf fixing of the time and place for
the holding >>f the State convention, a
motion was made and carried authoriz
ing outsiders who held proxies to take
part in the proceedings. As events
proved this was a move favorable to
the interests of Sacramento, as a ma
jority of the proxies voted were recorded
In favor of the capital city. On motion It
was agreed that the question of fixing
the meeting place of the convention be
first determined.
Nominations were called for, and Isa
dore Alexander placed Sacramento In

nomination. He was followed by
Charles M. Cassin. who placed the name
of Santa Cruz before the committee.
He said that halls, help and committee
rooms would be provided by the citizens
free of charge. He also pointed out the
superior hotel accommodations that
were to be offered, to say nothing of
climatic advantages and a hospitable
population that made the entertain
ment of visitors the business of their
live?.
Nnrval of Merced nominated Sun
Francisco. He said that he expressed
the sentiments of country delegates
when he declared that they wished to
combine with the business of the con
vention some of the pleasures that are
to be found only in the metropolis.
Edward MeCabe, formprly private
secretary to Governor Budd. spoke in
favor of Sacramento, which, he said,
was the only city In the State that pos
sessed all of the facilities to make a
success of a great convention. He was
followed by Kart Burke, who urged the
claims of Santa Cruz.
Governor Budd said he did not appear
as the partisan of either Sacramento or
Santa Cruz, but he was opposed to
holding the convention in San Fran
cisco. He referred to the convention
h^ld here four years ago and said that
at that time the delegates wanted to
enjoy themselves so badly that they
held an adjourned session in the even
ing and made nominations by proxy.
The result was that some of the nomi
nees were bolted by the party and
others were defeated. He thought a
great deal of time and care should be
devoted to the work of selecting nomi
nees, and the last name on the ticket
should carry as much strength as the
name at the head of the ticket. The
Governor declared that he did not be
lieve this to be a Republican year, but
was of onlnion that it would prove to be
bo unless the Democrats went about the
work of selecting candidates with care
and deliberation. As he believed these
conditions could not be developed in
San Francisco, he was unwilling to see
the convention brought here. He said
that harmony nrevailed in the Repub
lican party, and the hope the Democrats
have for success is in careful and har
monious action, first at the convention
and then in the campaign.
Among those who spoke for Sacra
mento were Judge Hinckson, A. Cami
nettl, J. Marion Brooks and Mayor
Land of Sacramento. Santa Cruz found
supporters in Mitchell of Los Angeles,
Gould of San Francisco and Clark of
Santa Cruz. Norval withdrew the
name of San Francisco.
The question was then put to a vote,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 12, 1898.
the result of which was: Sacramento,
66; Santa Cruz, 43. Sacramento was
declared to be the choice of the com
mittee.
Chairman Alford announced that the
next business before the committee
was the fixing of a date for the holding
of the convention. A motion was made
deferring the business of fixing a date
until a special meeting: for the purpose
was called hy the chairman. Lay
mance of Alameda moved to amend by
fixing: August 23 as the date. This was
opposed by J. Marion Brooks, who said
that time should be granted to those
who were trying to bring about a fu
sion between the parties favoring free
silver. Judge Hlnckson pointed out
that the Populist party convention is
to ho held July 13, and he was of the
opinion that it would be advisable to
hold the Democratic convention on the
same date. Hinckson was alone in this
view of the situation, as all are agreed
that the Democratic convention must
not be held earlier than the middle of
August. At the same time a majority
of the members of the committee are
willing to give the Populists an oppor
tunity to recede from the position they
have taken, and this opportunity is to
I>^ furnished hy leaving the date of the
Democratic convention open until the
Populists have had time to think the
matter over and perfect some plan by
which they can proceed with the hold
ing of their convention in July and at
the same time give authority to some
plan of fusion that can he presented to
the Democratic convention in August.
Governor Rudd is the advocate of such
a plan, and at his suggestion LÂ«ay
mance withdrew his amendment, and
the motion to allow the matter to go
over until the next meeting was put
and carried without a dissenting voice.
All of the individual members of the
committee agree in saying that under
no consideration will the Democratic
convention be held earlier than August,
as they believe that to surrender to the
Populists and hold the convention in
July would ent?il a loss of party pres
tige that would overbalance the good
that could be expected to come from
fusion with a party that is notoriously
weak. This being understood, the Popu
lists will either have to surrender their
new-born dignity or there will be no
fusion.

and earnestly for the new charter, we will
also labor to expose to public gaze and

A FEAST AT HIS FUNERAL.
Dicl^ Jaegels Surprised His Mourners.
The day of the funeral feast is not yet entirely of the past. This was
shown by the ceremonies following the burial of the late "Dick" Jaegels,
one of the most noted caterers of liquid refreshments along the water
front. There was nothing out of the ordinary in the burial notice, but
those who attended knew that they were going to have a new experience,
Jaegels, for a number of years, kept a place on Clay near East street.
it was a popular resort for seafaring men, and he did a profitable business.
His generosity, however, kept him from accumulating much of this world's
goods, but he left an established trade and some money.
Dick knew for some time that his days were few, and made his arrange
ments accordingly. Life to him had been one long joke, and he proposed
that the disposition of his remains should be followed by an event that
would be a pleasant instead of a sad memory.
To this end he had an understanding with his old friend Otto Schenkel,
a Bryant street merchant, to provide a banquet with all the accompanl
pnts of good cheer. The Clay street business was turned over to the old
barkeeper as a reward for faithfulness, and Jaegels approached his doom
with entire unconcern, except as to the finale, which he was anxious
should be a success. His practical joking was continued up to the last, and
many of his old friends will now marvel at his peculiar temperament.
The funeral took place at Odd Fellows' Cemetery on Tuesday after
noon, and was conducted with duo solemnity under the auspices of the Nord
deutscher Wrein. After the ceremonies, the friends present, numbering
about fifty, were notified that "Dick" had kept his word and provided a
pleasant surprise for them. They were invited to re-enter their carriages
and were driven to a resort out on Point Lobos avenue, where they found,
to their astonishment, an elaborate banquet spread, with drinkables run
ning the grade from steam beer to champagne. The guests were told that
it was the request of their departed friend that they "eat, drink and be
m^rry," lost on the morrow they follow him.
As their appetites were good and the viands tempting, they faithfully
followed his wishes, and the occasion was so unique that the festivities
were prolongr-d Into the evening.
After the dust had been removed from the arid throats, and the party
was seated at table, the teleph6ne rang.
"Who is that?" was asked.
"Dees is der Odd Fellows' Cemetery. Take another round on Dick. Dot
is me."
This was a startler, hut it was soon found to be a part of the pro
gramme of the deceased "to make der boys have a good time."
And so throughout the feasting the telephone would ring at short inter
vals and the answer would invariably be from "Dick" in various foreign
lands, and finally In the celestial eify, admonishing the "boys" to take
"another round on Dick." The messages were sent by friends of the dead
man. who had been instructed to impersonate him. This they did reli
giously, and the memory of the eccentric German will long be kept green
by those who were present.
lleve that the little privileges allowed are
not abused to any extent, and in oppo
sition, they are benefited, and there is
room enough for all. As to the sanitary
condition of the camp, we believe that the
surgeons in charge of each regiment will
unite with the health officers "of the city
in remedying all evils in that respect.

HARES RAN
LIKE DEMONS
Good Coursing at the
Two Parks.
SOME SURPRISES AT UNION
OLD EMIN PASHA MADE A MON
KEY OF SPEEDY MAGNET.
Two Miles of Hard Running Between
Laurelwood and the Great
Merced Favorite,
Sunolite.
The talent at Union Coursing Park re
ceived some heavy Jars yesterday, but It
la expected. that at the meeting of to-day
the surprises will be many.
The hares, as usual, ran like demons,
and one course in particular was highly
appreciated by the observers as the short-:
tailed hero of Merced plains carried its
pursuers from the slip to the escape at
the extreme end of the field, where it
turned and shot down by the fence on
the east side of the demesne, leaving the
point where the lower fence connects
with the kennels and shooting. in a
straight line immediately fronting the
grand stand, where it received a great
ovation. After a gallant struggle to
reach safety whence it came it was
bowled over by the dogs, who were so
completely exhausted after the grueling
run that the kill was made with difficulty.
The competing hounds were Sunollte and
Laurelwood. and although the last-named
dog gained a decided advantage in the
run up to game, there were not a few
people among the spectators who thought
that Sunollte scored the greater number
of points from the time he passed his op
ponent near the escape until the end of
tiiG course.
mnri''**? c ? ur^- Judge Bell should know
more. about the game than the ordinary
observer, and he decided in favor of Lau
relwood. who saved himself evidently by
a few points he scored to his credit lust
previous to the kill. creau just
The _ course between Mystery and
O Grady was also talked of considerably^
There were some people who thought that
Mystery should have been declared the
winner because of the very excellent work
she accomplished nearing the finish of the
course, scoring several points to he?
One of the grand features of the day
%* 8 the magnificent performance of the
old dog Emm Pasha, who defeated the

AT INGLESIDE.
A Good Day's Sport With Some
Lively Running at Short
Range.
The attendance at Ingleside yesterday
to witness the coursing was good, and
those who placed their money on their
favorite dogs had the pleasure of wit
nessing good sport, even if some of them
lost on their pick.
Judge Grace, whose decisions are never
appealable and seldom if ever dissented
from, was there. One remarkable feature
of the sport at Ingleside is that neither
the proprietor nor any attache of the
grounds Is permitted to own any dog en
tered within the inclosure, or bet upon
the result of any contest on the grounds.
This keeps away any suspicion of foul

"STOOD SIX FEET FOUR OR I'M NO JUDGE OF INCHES."
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, JUNE 12, 1898.
BY ALICE RIX.
ON the morning of the twenty-third
of May four men went out from
the regular Army to serve their
time in Alcatraz Prison.
They were placed under guard
in an open express wagon and
driven from the Presidio guard house
to the Clay-street wharf.
As the wagon passed through the
Reservation gates on~ of them flung
himself Into the bottom of it and
covered his head in his arms.
I think no one noticed these men or
noticing took much account of them in
the hurry and bustle of that day.
It was the day on which the First and
Second Battalions of California Volun
teers broke camp at the Presidio,
marched across the city and took ship
for hostile ports.
In the chill, still dawn which crept
into the field ..om the sea the reveille
woke eighteen hundred men to the ac
tive service of their country. They rose
to it eagerly and stirred the Post with
the business of their going.
Who, seeing it, will forget while the
heart beats in the breast, that first
call to the young West and how her
sons went out to answer it?
There have been wars of ours In
which men fought and bled and
dlod for the cause and the
flag floating over us, and left their
legacy of national courage to its his
tory. We read of them, thrilling to
thÂ«;ir memory, and honor such as live
to tell the tale. But th.t was the
courage of long ago touching the
heart across the years of peace. This
Is the courage of the vivid now, going
from our arms in answer to the trump
of war. Those were our heroes of yes
terday. These are our soldiers of to
day. Those were the wars of our
fathers. This is the war of our sons.
In the little hours of the dawn the
crowd gathered at the Presidio to
look on the orderly confusion of
breaking camp, the figures of men
and horses coming out against
the lightening sky, orders sharply
given, quickly taken, the eager stumb
ling of the raw recruit, the excited cool
ness of drilled militiamen, the frenzied
zeal of company to surpass company in
th<* speed of packing tents, the magnifi
cent triumph of the victorious first, the
splendid disappointment of the defeated
rest, the traps loitering on the drive,
the equipment wagons lumbering on the
field, the close embrace, the sound of
laughter and of sobs, the words that
courage speaks and pain, the assem
bly, the start, the march, the band, the
flag, the boys!
Who, I say, will ever forget It? Who
wants ever to forget it?
Cheers, tears, good-bys, godspeeds all
along the line of march! All the early
wakened world gay and sad at the
siprht of so much young courage and
tender patriotism and innocent hope
going to the war! The city with her
national colors at her breast, pulsing
and throbbing with the spirit of war
after a thirty years' sleep of peace!
California wreathing her roses and lilies
into crowns for untried heroes, sending
them forth to win her laurels! Young
boys chafing, old men mourning the
priory that passed them by! Mothers,
fathers, sisters, sweethearts, wives,
giving bravply their dearest and besi!
The music of fife and drum getting into
men's legs and making them march!
The sight of the old flag getting into
men's brains and making them mad to
go out under it, to fight for it, to die
for it! Scarce one among them, good
or evil, but would sell his rights of
birth, his hopes of heaven for the
change.
And away from the line of march,
away from the flowers and the flaps,
the cheering: and the glory, away from
the transport ships, away from the
wars, away from the Army, going to
the Clay-street wharf, going to the
government tug, going to Alcatraz
Island, going to the military prison,
men who had this chance and put it
And one, face downward, in the
bottom of the wagon.
I went to Alcatraz Island on
Wednesday.
Captain Hobbs, commandant
of the post, stood on the
wharf. Lieutenant England,
officer In charge of the pris
on, stood beside him.
It was a rough day by
land or sea, with a spit
ting fog abroad. The sea
girt short of the grim
mest of our posts
was washed with
soapy water, lta
rooky r-teeps 1 were
BW^pt by a bold,
brisk gale. Men
held to their hats
and women to
th^lr draperies.
that crawls
like a beetle up and down to the top
of Alcatraz and to the bottom shivered
in the draught. The commandant
shouted to me down the wind:
"Ride up. I will join you at the of
fice."
And the beetle crawled where man,
cleverly disposing of what God pro
posed, has hewed and hacked himself a
road from out the nearly solid rock.
Nasturtiums, sea pinks, wandering ivy,
all brave things that root in rock and
bring color to the face of it, are planted
here to cheer the eye, good soil is boxed
and ledged from sliding to the sea, and
garden things set out to grow in ft, the
sturdy marshmallow flings its supple
branches out and swings and nods as
pinkly, greenly gay on Alcatraz as any
where; but the beaten roses droop and
scatter in the deathless wind, tender
clinging vines are swept from the walls,
flowers bloom palely, grass grows
sparsely, trees grow not at all;
Alcatraz. fog-swept, wind-blown, rock
built fortress of the sea, looks what it
is to saint and sinner in the service,
the prison post of the Western Division
of the Army.
In the little office which looks,, like a
lighthouse, on all sides to the sea, I
make my wishes known and hay; them
granted.
They are, tout simple, to go into the
prison, to talk to military convicts, to
know from the eyes, the lips, the voices,
the manners of these men once enlisted,
and now debarred from the service of
their country, how this fact feels to
them in time of war.
It is against military rule for the
civilian, even in petticoats, to hold com
munication with military convicts ex
cept in the presence of an officer. Cap
tain Hobbs and Lieutenant England go
with me to the prison.
It is that long, brown, melancholy
building lying to the water and seen
of every passing craft, with its port
holes, lighting cells, looking to the sea,
the windows and the doors of its free
passages giving inward to the road up
on the hill.
The men were at mess.
In a long, low room, whitewashed,
sanded and scrupulously clean, twenty
four prisoners were gathered to the
midday meal. They sat on benches at
either side the single table running
down the middle and nearly the length
of the room. They were all young men.
They were nearly all good-looking men.
That is to say, they looked out from
their eyes frankly, held up their heads
bravely, had an average of good feat
ures among them and none of the
hang-dog look the civil convict wears
like a brand upon his brow, like the
stripes upon his back.
It occurred to me then in the face of
the contrast as it has occurred to me
many times before in the lack of it,
that the stripes have much to do with
this. The military prisoner wears his
old uniform, or the old uniform of
somebody else, stripped of its honorable
buttons and dyed from its martial blue
to any dark and serviceable shade the
cloth will take. He wears a soft black
hat with a red band about the crown
when he is entered in the second class
of prisoners â as all prisoners are en
tered at the military prison â and he
may earn the w" ite band of the first
class by good behavior, or fall to the
yellow of the third class by evil ways,
and in any case his standing is shown
in contrast to that of his fellow prison
ers and he may not be confused with
something better or worse than he is.
He walks no lock-step; he knows no
chain sang*; he is given a certain
liberty of action under surveillance; he
is treated like a man in disgrace, but
like a man for all that; he is suffered
to take away from prison as much self
respect as he brings into it. And this
is a lesson the law might learn from the
army!
It is the principle of civil prisons to
break down what honest pride may sur
vive the sinning of a deadly sin and the
loss of personal liberty. It is a part of
the -punishment which is supposed to
fit every crime. For this the lock-step,
the chain gang, the ball and chain, the
convict stripes survive their usefulness,
live on in the face of surer, more scien
tific methods of defense against escape
and means of recapture. For this the
man who steals for gain and the man
who steals for bread, the man who
kills In hot blood and the man who
kills in cold, wear the same uniform of
shame and no man, seeing, knows them
apart. And yet It would seem to me
that pride is as good a thing to cherish
in the hearts of bad men as in the
hearts of good, as necessary to men in
prisons as to men out of them. For
it is not until pride is gone that the
candle is out and darkness eternal set
tles on the soul.
"Attention!"
The men at the table dropped their
knives and forks. Their eyes looked
straight away over their noses, their
hands fell to their sides, their meat and
cabbage cooled on their plates. They
were tense, motionless as stone men,
every nerve under the discipline which
makes the strength of the army.
Through the open panels of a sort of
screen wall at the end of the mess
room I could see the kitchen. The cook
had come to halt before his range. The
helper at the sink, the steward half
way from the table to the door. Their
perfect obedience to discipline lent them
dignity, as obedience to discipline, in
form or effect, dignifies all men, even
soldiers disgraced, stripped of their
buttons, dressed in dyed uniforms, do
ing time in a military prison while their
country is at war.
The Captain stepped across the sanded
floor.
"Let the men go on with mess,"
said he.
"At ease!"
The men at the tables picked up their
knives and forks, the cook in the
kitchen fell to his pots and pans, the
scullion stirred his dishes, the steward
moved across the floor.
The table was trimly spread, the fare
was plentiful and inviting of its kind,
the men ate with relish, pushed away
their plates as they finished, rose and
left the room when they liked. Their
hats hung on a row of pegs near the
door. I noticed the bands of red and
â¢white.
â¢'-Artillery and Infantry?" I asked.
"No," said Lieutenant England, "sec
ond class and first." And he explained
the distinctions, including the yellow,
and mentioned that yellow was an in
frequent color in Alcatraz Prison.
"This man has just come over," sai<3
the Sergeant.
This man was the steward, six feet
four or I am no judge of inches, and
never saw twenty-five or I am no judge
of years. He looked a handsome soldier
and, by my faith! a brave one, standing
there in his six feet of disgraced
strength with a napkin on his arm.
He stood well, with his chin up, his
chest out, his shoulders squared, his
heels together and his hands clapped
to his sides. The officers regarded him
thoughtfully. Such men are needed to
day in the field. His eyes met mine
steadily, but his face flushed. It was
a good face, well and squarely boned,
the brow and nose strong and straight
and Greek, the lips firm, the jaw set in
the outward curve with which Greece
corrects the exaggerated beauty of such
brows and noses. He waited like a man
waiting for execution â brave to meethla
fate, but by no means cheerful about it.
And it is not so easy to talk to men In
trouble. I mouthed the Sergeant for a
moment's grace.
"Bo you have just come over?"
"Yes, madam."
"What â " I began and hesitated as to
the putting of it and began again.
"What was it?"
"Fraudulent enlistment, madam."
"What was there against your enlist
ment in the regular way?"
His eyes flickered and his color rose.
He hesitated a moment. Then he said
steadily enough, "I'd deserted."
The answer surprised me. This man
had no look of running away about him.
"What for?" I asked abruptly.
"I'd rather not say," he replied
quietly. *
"I beg your pardon."
"No!" he said, looking distressed. "I
didn't know there was going to be war,"
he added. "It was from the Fourthâ
the Fourth Cavairy â and when I heard
about the fighting, I enlisted again,
right away, in the Fourteenth Infantry.
That was in Oregon."
"You came down with the Oregon
troops?"
"Yes, madam."
"And they took you at the Presidio T*
"Yes, madam."
"How did they find you out?"
"By the description card, I suppose.
It was quite awhile that they didn't
and I hoped that I might get to the
front â " he looked dejectedly away.
"You wanted to fight?"
"Yes, madam."
"I think you ought to let him," I said
to Captain Hobbs, as the man went
back to his table. "Don't you think
he's a brave man?"
"I dare say." The Captain shrugged
his shoulders.
"And there isn't the slightest chance
for him now?"
"Not with us."
"I hope you don't mean with Spain?"
"No," said Captain Hobbs. "But
there is no regulation to prevent the en
listment of a man from here with the
Volunteers. If they knew him for a
military convict very probably they
wouldn't have him. but ir he could get
somebody to give him a certificate of
character that would pass muster at
the recruiting office there is no military
law against his using it. I understand
several non - commissioned officers
among" the Volunteers are discharged
military convicts."
"And then," said I, faithful to my
brave, "if he distinguished himself in
the field and did something particularly
heroic, you'd forgive him, wouldn't you,
and take him back into the army?
Wouldn't you?"
"I?" said Captain Hobbs. "I couldn't.
The President might."
I saw the others in the gallery leading
to the cells. Its bricks are painted white,
its roof is glass. The sun shines here
when it shines at all. The salt breeze
from the sea hurries in and out at the
open portholes past the grated doors
and sweeps the gallery clear. Here is
no foul prison smell, no dank prison
slime. The cells are clean as that waa
which has become a housewife's prov
erb. Each is furnished with an army
cot, painted white, a dresser and a
chair. All are decorated, by their in
mates, In that spirit of home adorn-,
ment so touching In captivity.
The men came singly and stood
against the whitewashed wall and ans
wered questions. Their military man
ners served them well. Some were shy
and some were shamed, but they all
stood rigidly erect and gave their ans
wers promptly. They all wanted to
fight.
One man was there for insubordina
tion; he had struck an officer and he
did not care to talk about it. The rest
were deserters.
"Where were you taken?" I asked an
Irish eye which twinkled even under
conditions such as these.
"Phure, CM nivver was taken at all.
Oi came ay me own accourd."
"That's not quite usual, is It?" I In
quired politely.
" "Faith, thin, it is. There's lots ay
poor divvils come and give themselves
up and that's all the good it is to them.
Ol deserted wanst, but whin Oi hearrud
the war news Oi wint shtraight away
and gave meself up and said Oi'd loika
to foight."
"Andâ?"
The Irish eye winked takingly.
"They thought me country wouldn't
need me for about two year-r-s."
But it is not every man can take a
light Irish heart to prison with him.
The next had given himself up because
he could not believe the Government
would refuse a man who wanted to
fight.
"Didn't they want me for deser
tion?" he said bitterly, ignoring the
presence of the official braid. "Wouldn't
they have held me for that if they'd
taken me? And I went and gave my
self up. I was sick of being what I
was. I wanted to serve again. And
I'm here serving â serving time."
Oh, wise government of the people,

What We Ought to Do to Resume Our
Place Among Maritime Nations.
T* 1 f, cci States ls t0 resume lts P^ce as a great maritime nation
* e ,â¢ u , s have a u n adequate navy. We should have at least eighteen
battleships on the Atlantic Coast and six on the Pacific; we should
have at least two monitors for every large harbor, and we should
JL have thirty cruisers like the New York.
We should have both ships and forts for coast defense. But the most
effective force is that which is mobile. Land batteries and forts are
necessary for the defense of our seaports and seaboard cities- but we
must have a navy to operate against an alert and energetic enemy on
the ocean, to meet, beat him off, destroy or capture him.
It is impossible by fortifications alone to defend our many thousands
of miles of coast line with its numerous bays, reaches and inlets, bo as
to prevent the landing of an invading army. See how many ports there
are vn the New* England coast.
In fact, situated as we are, we must be strong and ready on the sea
for not only defensive but offensive operations. If we had had an ade
quate navy to protect our whole coast line, surround Cuba, crush Cervera's
fleet and smash the fleet at Manila the war would have been all over
by this time.
Sir Walter Raleigh said: "England is a country that can never be
conquered while the sovereigns thereof have the command of the sea;
whosoever commands the sea commands the trade, and whosoever com
mands the trade commands the riches of the world."
If the United States is to resume its place as a great maritime nation
we must have more ships. Before the civil war we built fine ships and
sailed them. But during the war the Confederacy destroyed much of our
shipping; we would not permit any ship which had carried the Confederate
fiver in the war to rfturn under our flag, and so much more of our shipping
changed hands. Then our people began to turn their attention to building
railroads aod developing the enormous internal resources of the country.
They received a greater return from this investment than they could from
ships.
Meantime conditions changed on the sea. Sails gave way to steam,
and wooden bottoms to those of iron and steel. "We had been great build
ers of wooden ships, but of iron sship building we knew little, and
gradually the business drifted away from us. I hope it is to be restored
and that we shall take the place that belongs to us among maritime
nations.
In a very short time the Pacific Ocean is going to see an enormous
development of commerce. With the building of the Nicaragua Canal
it is going to become the pathway for trade with the 400,000,000 people of
China, the 40,000,000 of Japan, the 8,000,000 in Korea and the 10,000,000 in
the Philippine Islands.
Honolulu must be the stopping place for all this commerce and it is
going to became one of the great commercial centers of the world. We
need not admit Hawaii to the Union. We can govern it as a territory,
just as we govern the District of Columbia. As to the natives, there are
only 180,000 of them and they are fast dying off. Besides, with the ac
quisition of the islands by the United States they would be settled by
American families.
We can govern the semi-barbarous population of the Philippines.
How does England govern her colonies? Let us take a lesson from her.
As to Chaunoey Depew's argument that to tax the Philippine Islanders
without representation would be a betrayal of the principles for which
we fought in 1776, I answer let the Philippine Islanders do as we did in
the Revolution and demonstrate their power and capacity for self-govern
ment. The great difficulty in controlling the Philippines or Porto Rico
would be the religious question. In all Spanish countries the Catholic
church ia supreme. Do you know that from the IsthmuÃ of Panama to
Cape Horn no bell can be rung for a Protestant service? Protestants can
worship in a hall if they like, but they cannot hold services in a church.
Why, it is only in England and the United States that there is any re
ligious independence.
Now there would be trouble, I am afraid, If Protestant churches were
opened In any of the Spanish colonies taken by us. The natives have been

BY GEN NELSON A. MILES.
SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVING
OUR STANDING ARMY
I lay the blame for the long delay in preparing for active
operations on the smallness of our regular army.
Our standing army in time of peace should be maintained
in the proportion of one soldier to every 1000 citizens.
Â« GENERAL NELSON A. MILES,
Commanding United States Army.
WE have been a very long time prepar
ing for active operations. I lay the
blame for the delay on the smallness
of our regular army. I propose
when this war is over, with the co
operation of the President and Congress and
of the Secretary of War, to raise the regular
army to a point of efficiency where it will be
ready for any pressing emergency on a day's
notice. Experience in the ranks makes a man
a better citizen in private life than if he had
never understood through practical experience
the meaning of army discipline.
During recent years it has been my privi
lege to visit Germany and other foreign coun
tries, and while upon these journeys I have
studied the effect of military training upon the
citizens. Inasmuch as military service is only
optional in the United States, we jfcive not the
disciplined, material to draw from that exists
in countries where every man over 12 is, to a
certain extent, a soldier. Therefore we ought to ,
have an army of more than seventy thousand
men and the rrmy ought at all times to be kept
up to the ratio of one soldier to every 1000 in
habitants of this country.
Look at tbe aations of Europe. German y.
for example, is a nation of soldiers. Every
able-bodied citizen must serve in the army for a
certain number of years. So must the men
of France.
I was talking with a German officer not
long ago, and he told me that the effects of the
German system were excellent in more than a
military sense. The German Government takes
the raw citizsn and makes of him a man, with
not only a military but a social training. It
makes him bathe. It makes him comb and
brush his hair. It teaches him to keep his
clothing clean.. It requires a certain amount
of athletic exercise and improves his physical |
condition. It requires him to walk erect. But
above all, it teaches him discipline.
The Oerman system makes men â it does
more; it makes gentlemen. It makes good cit

izens, with respect for authority.
Beyond all question military service makes
a better man better fitted for the duties of civil
life than hw would have been without it. it
teaches him to concentrate his mind on what
he is doing. He carries with him into busi
ness and professional life the idea that there is
a right way to do a thing, and that that is
always the way to do it. It does not make the
citizen less original, but it makes him quicker
in his actions, more decisive in his speech. It
polishes him as nothing else on earth could
possibly do.
I do not think the German system of mili
tary service could be successfully introduced
in this country. It is not suited to our peo
ple. And I think it is not necessary to our
safety. We do not need to be prepared as
the nations of Euroj c must be. Still, we must
be ready for conflict at any time. And we are
not ready when our chief reliance must bo
placed in our militia.
See the condition of our army to-day.
Many of the men are without uniforms. Some
of them have guns of one kind, soms of an
other.
The regular army, on the other hand, has
been prepared for active service from the mo
ment war began.
As I stated above, the standing army in
time of peace should be maintained in the pro
portion of one soldier to every 1000 citizens.
Our present population being in round num
bers 70,000,000, that would give us an army
of 70,000. As we increase in numbers so the
size of our army would grow and thus the pro
portion be constantly observed.
If that were 'he case we should be in no
danger of iinding ourselves as at the beginning
of this present war, with an army ridiculously
inferior in point of numbers when its duties
are considered.
We do not need the standing armies of
Europe in the TJnited States, but it will always
be wise to have an army of adequate propor
tions to the size of the country.

National Guard and the volunteers, at the same time I believe that we
ought to have a regular army of a moderate number, which would be
ready to take the field under any and all circumstances at a momfnt'l
notice. The failure to preserve a reasonable organization in proportion
to the population of the country has been demonstrated on two occasions
as extremely costly and inimical to the best interests of the republic.
In the war of the rebellion if we had had a regular army of a reason
able number the result might have been different at the start, and to-day
if our regular army had consisted of 75.000 men, 60,000 thoroughly organ
ized, disciplined troops might have been placed in Cuba without any de
lay. I fully believe we are capable of overcoming even this situation and
that the National Guard and the volunteers will immediately fill and
occupy it.
The military situation changes materially every moment. No one sup
posed that we would be obliged to send troops to the Philippines, and
personally, I have been opposed to it. V :
I would have preferred that Commodore Dewey after his great suc
cess in the destruction of the Spanish fleet, should have left Manila and
assembled his fleet at Honolulu. That is the natural outpost of this
country, which means in the future the construction of the Nicaragua
Canal. But I have no objection to the occupation of the Philippines and
will support the administration in that matter, as I do in everything else,
believing that whatever is determined by the President and his advisers
is the proper thing to do. . W. J. SEWELL,

taught to believe that Protestants are heretics, with no hope of salvation.
To see them permitted to hold services in a church would stir up strife,
and nothing can make more trouble than a question of religion.
It is not true, as E. J. Phelps says, that we must develop a race of
sailors before we can take a place among naval powers.
We inherited an aptitude for the sea. There were never any better
sailors than American seamen before the war. It was the diversion of
interest from our shipping that made them turn to other occupations. By
nature we are bailors. An Englishman said to an American commander
jestingly: "Why do you talk so much of the superiority of Americans?
You were all English not so long ago."
And the American answered: "We are now English a little improved."
When we look at the map and note the fact that our shores are washed
by the Atlantic and Pacific and the waters of the Gulf of Mexico and
Puget Sound, we see that as regards a war with any maritime power we
are quite as open to an attack by an enemy's fleet as are the seagirt
shores of Great Britain.
In attacking an enemy beyond our borders as we are doing to-day a
naval force is a prime necessity: a force to which must be confided the
first operations in a war like that which we are now waging against
Spain.
Cervera.'s action in going Into Santiago harbor looks to me like very
bnd strategy. Of course he could never have hoped to come out. But we
don't know yet what drove him in. Possibly lack of ooal. or the breaking
down of his' machinery compelled him to seek refuge there.

harbor of .Santiago <j. Cuba Is the only
â¢it of Mr. Hobson'a of which the
world has knowledge. But the fact
that the young oflie>;r possessed pluck
and determination far above the av
erage Is well known. In fact, there
are records to show it.
When still only a boy pluck and per
severance were Hobson's ruling char
acteristics. The desire to k^i ahead
in the world and amount to something
was almost a passion before he kj.s in
his teenk
It was this determination that
prompted him, before he was 14 years
oid, to make an effort to enter the Na
val Academy. And how he did work
to do it. â  But he succeeded. in the
course of time all the preliminaries
were gone through with and lie
up for examination, passing with the
highest honors. And so he left his
paternal home in Alabama and became
a cadet at Annapolis oh May 21,
During ;he four years' study that fol
lowed Hobson k>-pt in the front in his
classes and at the final examination
.1 with ail the honors obtainable.
His percentage for the four years'
study was nearly 90 per cent, B
thing unheard of in the annals of the
academy.
In conformity to the system at the
Naval Academy which assigns cadets
to the different branches of the naval
service according to their preference
and proficiency, Hobson and Rock were
selected for the Naval Constructors'
Corps, to which the cream of the school
goes.
And after having dropped Into his
coveted place Hobson still kept up his
determination to get ahead. By show
ing a diligence and perseverance he
tain his reward by being
sent to Paris to study naval construc
tion in the Polytechnic SchooL He re
iroad three years and re
h honors. Since that time
he has held the position of assistant
naval constructor, and in January last
Etood No. 1 on the list for promotion,
urse, now it is bound to come as
a natural sequence of his daring ex
ploit.
iMirinsr the war In the Orient Hobson
was selected by the Secretary of the
Navy, upoij the recommendation of
chief Constructor Hichborn. to repre
sent the United States navy on Japan
ese war vessels, where he could have
an opportunity to pen Â«erve
modern warfare at sea. The Bureau of
Navigation, under Commodore Ram
say, and the entire line corps made
such decided objections to what they
considered an innovation upon their
prerogatives, that the project was re
luctantly abandoned and Assistant
Constructor Hobson was lefl to ini
prove his knowledge in doing duty at
irenu and at the New York Navy
yard up to the time whr-n the man and
the occasion seem to have met and fit
ted.
And when the occasion did come It
was pluck find courage that enabled
him to undertake it, and determination
that enabled him to carry it to a roc
cessful ending.
As Hobeon'B record now strings it is
unprecedented In naval annals. With
out any previous experience in actual
warfare thin young officer ha? success
fully performed one of the most daring
featfs in history.
When it became known that the ed
miral wished the entrance to Santiago
harbor blocked Lieutenant Hobson was
one of the first to apply for the privi
lege of doing the blocking. The plan
was his own, and by his earnestness
and known reliability he convinced his
superior officers of its feasibility.
What must have been the feeling of
the young man, as he stood on the
bridge of the empty and almost desert
ed steamer Merrimac. and guided her
right into the mouths of the Spanish
truns. The cannon roared, and shot and
shell fell like hail ;ill around him. Still
he kept on. although his vessel was
being riddled. The men in the engine
room kept at their posts until the ves
sel was just where h<Â» wished it. Th^n
the little crew assembled on deck, the
torpedo in the bow was exploded and
took to the small boats. Escape to
their own watching fleet in such a hail
of deadly fir" was impossible, so they
rowed straight to Admiral Cervera's
.. The Spanish sailors recognized
their pluck and daring and received
them with cheers.
What was attempted had bÂ«e n ac
complished, and the funken Merrimac
effectually blocked the escape from
Santiago of the Spanish fleet. Negotla

At last reports Lieutenant Hohson
and his mates are in Morro Castle
being treated as honorable prisoners of
war. They escaped the shells of our
own fleet that bombarded the forts a
few days after their capture.
It is the general opinion that Lieu
tenant Hobson's daring act will rank
in American history with the plucky
deeds of Decatur, Cushtng and Paul
Jones.
LIEUT CUSHING'S
Destruction of the
ALBEMARLE.
AMONG the naVal heroes of the
civil war none have achieved
more well-earned fame than
rushing, whose whole career
â¢was conspicuous tor deeds of
daring.
Cashing when in command of a small
steamer on blockade service thought
nothing of pursuing the enemy into his
: own inland watene and destroying ves
sels which the Confederates supposed
to be securely defended by land bat
! teries.
One of his exploits was so extreme in
1 its daring as to savor almost of bur
â¢ lesque. In the winter of 1864, when
blockading the Cape Fear River, Cush-
Ing determined to pay a visit to Smith
ville in a small boat with a crew of
only six men. Fort Caswell, guarding
the mouth of the river, mounted many
heavy guns and Smithvillo, two miles
further up, was well fortified besides
being strongly garrisoned. But Cush
ing, with his invariable good fortune,
pushed safely through and actually
landed in Smithville, close to the bat
tery. He walked calmly across the
street to General Herbert's house and
f<mnd two staff officers there. Drawing
his pistol he requested them to sur
render, and though one officer escaped
he actually managed to carry off Major
j Kelly a prisoner. Cushing, with his
captive, was back in his boat and away
down the river before the alarm could
jbe given. .

the face of the most trying conditions
â was never better demonstrated than at
Newbern. He was in command of a
party of sailors dragging navy how
itzers and when landing on the marsh
lost his shots and hax. Pressing on
bareheaded and barefooted he encoun
tered the servant of Captain Johnson
of the army, who had a spare pair of
boots slung over his shoulder. Cush-
Ing impressed the boots despite the
servant's objections, directing him to
Inform his master that lieutenant
Cushing of the navy was barefooted
and had borrowed them for the day.
Put far the most brilliant exploit of
Cushing, by which his name will always
be i ' rnembered by his country, was the
destruction of the armored Confederate
rani, Albermarle.
The enemy had been forewarned of
his intention to blow the ship up with
a torpedo and had secured the Alber
marle snugly to a wharf at Plymouth.
A cordon of logs surrounded her at a
distance of thirty feet, a company of
soldiers with small arms and howitzers
were on the wharf to defend her and
the crew on board stood ready at their
guns. The enemy was vigilant enough
to detect Cushing's approach in a small
torpedo-boat and at once poured a
shower of shot and shell upon him. But
the little craft stole In unhurt, forced
her way over the boom and thrust her
torpedo against the side of the fated
Albermarle.
At this moment a shell from a heavy
gun completely wrecked the torpedo
bnat and she went down Just as her
torpedo exploded. The work was well
done, for the Albermarle was complete
ly destroyed and a serious blow was
struck at the power of the Confederate
fleet.
Fortunately Cushing's life was Bayed
and for this daring act he was pro
moted to be a lieutenant commander.
LÂ«ike Decatur he came to an untimely
end when his years of service were
over. In 1874 his health failed, then
his mind went, and he died insane at
the early age of 32 years.

in the United States Navy dur-

midshipman In 1797. Two years later

der the guns of the castle. Meanwhile
the crew were taken as slaves and to
the number of some 300 put to hard la
bor.
Now came Decatur's turn, and owing
to his courage and skill the Tripolitans
were despoiled of the fruits of their
victor}-. The gallant young officer took
command of a captured Tripoli tan craft
named the Intrepid and, with a crew
of but seventy-five men, entered the
harbor at night, sailing right under the
heavy guns of the castle.
The cool audacity of the Americans
dismayed the enemy. Decatur ranged
alongside the Philadelphia within half
gunshot of the Pasha's castle, his gal
lant crew boarded, and with an irre
sistible onslaught drove the enemy
overboard at the point of the cutlass.
Then Decatur set the Philadelphia on
fire and remained alongside until the
flames had gained absolute control and
nothing but a smoldering hulk was left
for the Tripolitans to claim.
His work done he retired in safety,
the most remarkable circumstance
about this brave feat being that not a
single American life was lost.
PAUL JONES'
Capture of the
SERAPIS.
THE first and one of the most fas
cinating characters in American
naval history is Paul Jones, the
famous hero of the Revolutionary
War. He held a commission in
the first fleet which the colonies, so
soon to become a great nation, equipped
and his example of cool, undaunted
bravery undoubtedly did much to stim
ulate the sailors of the infant navy.
To give a list of Paul Jones' exploit^
would require a volume, but they were
BO striking that all Europeâ even his
enemiesâ gave full recognition to his
sailor-like skill and courage. All the
famous statesmen of the Revolution
admired him; Washington, Lafayette
and Jefferson were loud in his praise,
and sedate old Benjamin Franklin
summed up his character In the one
historic phrase, "For Captain Paul
Jones ever loved close fighting."
The exploit chiefly associated with
Paul Jones' memory is hia truly mar-
velous capture of the British frigate
Serapis by the old Bon Honime Rich
ard. It was one of the most closely
contested sea duels known to history,
and nothing ever brought Paul Jones'
obstinate, reckless courage into higher
relief, nothingâ though more than a
century has passed â more conclusively
proved the fitness of the American
sailor for naval warfare.
The battle occurred on September 2,
1778, off Flamborough Head, on the east
coast of England. Paul Jones, with
his tiny squadron, consisting, besides
his own ship, of the Pallas, Active and
Vengeance, fell in with a convoy of
British merchantmen, escorted by the
forty-gun frigate, the Serapis, and a
small vessel, the Countess of Scarbor
ough. The other American ships tools
but little part in the action; it was
practically a duel between the Bon
Homme Richard and the Serapis. The
day was drawing to a close when the
fight began, but all through the night
Paul Jones maintained an undaunted
front. Many of his guns, being old
and worthless, burst, his ship was on
fire in a dozen places, water poured into
her from a dozen gaping leaks, and,
worst of all, he had over a hundred
prisoners confined below, who were
ready to mutiny and capture the ship
as soon as they could make their es
cape.
Yet during the lull in the fight, when
the Serapis swung alongside the Bon
Horame Richard and hailed, asking
Paul Jones if he had surrendered, he
replied in firm tones, "We haven't be
gun to fight yet." â ÂÂ«".,
The words were almost prophtic. for
from that moment the tide of battle
turned in favor of the American hero.
The masts of the Serapis were shot
away, her decks were cleared by the
accurate fire of the American muskets,
and last of all her magazine was ex
ploded.
This feat, which practically won the
battle, was performed by a gallant
American sailor, who climbed out on
the mainyard until he was directly over
the main hatchway of tne Serapis.
From this coign of vantage he dropped
lighted hand grenades down her hold.
One of these reached the magazine and
a terrific explosion followed. Finally
the Serapis hauled down her flag to a
i-inking ship and Paul Jones transferred
his crew to the raptured vessel. The
Bon Hnramc Richard was so badly
shatterrd that she foundered soon
afterward.
WITH DEWEY
At
MANILA.
AGAIN and again has the story of
Manila been told, and the very
manner of Its telling is enough
to cause a thrill of American
pride; for the story comes from
the pen or the lips of men who were
there on that grreat day, who steamed
into a harbor where the waters were
supposed to be instinct with death, be
tween hostile forts and straight for the
fleet of the enemy. Yet while they did
this they were as devoid of fear as
though going through a series of friend
ly maneuvers. While cannon thundered,
shells foil on every side, and at times
clouds of smoke obscured the scene,
they watched with eager, straining eye
and some of them took notes as calmly
as though battle was a play. All this
shows a. phase of the courage which
covered with glory the navy of the
United States, made immortal the name
of George Dewey, and set the Stars
and Stripes waving in strange lands.
But for years the. brave tale will still
be related, and Americans will be
thrilled to hear it.
H. J. Walsh of the Olympia had no
time in which to take notes. Stripped
like his comrades, he served his gun,
and only paused to cheer when word
was passed that some shot had struck
home. Walsh has sent to a friend in
this city an account of the engage
ment. It possesses peculiar interest as
being from the standpoint not of an
officer, but of one of the actual fight
ers, the men who took orders and
obeyed them unflinchingly and with
patriotic zeal, their love for the flag
as keen as that of the man who rtood
on the bridge. The letter is as follows:
MANILA, Philippine Islands.
May 4, ISPS.
Dear Friend John: Since I wrote you
that last letter a great change has taken
place on this coast. Where the Spanish
flag flew a short time ago there now files
the white flag of truce, and I can assure
you that the Spanish will never forget it
as long as they live.
I told you in my last letter that I
thought we were going to have a scrap
with the Spanish, and we had it.
We left Mlrs Bayâ twenty miles from
Hongkongâ on the 26th of April at 2p. m.,
and proceeded in the direction of Manila,
and we never stopped until we met and
defeated, the Spanish in one of the most
stubborn contests ever fought in modern
times, and with modern guns on both
sides. It was one of the greatest sights
I have ever witnessed, and one of the
most brilliant victories in the world's
naval history.
I must give them (the Spanish) th<Mr
dues. They fought a hard fight, and died
at their posts like soldiers.
In one ship, the Rclna Crlstina, the
Spanish admiral's flagship, were carried
600 all told, and only sixty are accounted
for. and they are all in the hospital. We
cut that ship all to pieces, and when she
went about to try to get away, a shot
struck her square in the stern, and
went right through her. All at once she
was in a blaze of fire. Those that were
not shot away were cremated in the
burning ship.
We went by the outer forts at 11:40
p. m. in single file in the following rout
ine: Flagship Olympia, Admiral Dewey;
Baltimore, Captain Dyer; Raieigh. Cap
tain Coughlin; Concord, Captain Walker;
Petrel, Captain Woods: revenue cutter
McCulloch. Captain Elliott; transports
Zafaro and Nanshan and the Boston.
Captain Wildes, in the rear. The night
was very dark, and we were all past the
forts but the two transports and the
Boston when they discovered us and
opened fire on us. The blaze from their
guns had not died out when the Boston
answered it. As every man stood by his
gun with his shirt off and a necker
chief tied around his head they looked
like the pictures of old-time fighters.
That one shot from the Boston killed
forty men in the forts. We then proceed
ed up the. bay until we came in sight of
the enemy's fleet. Everything was very
quiet until we came within 10,000 yards
of them, when the Spanish flagship
opened fire on us. We did not answer
them until we were within 6000 yards,
every man standing by his gun with his
lock Btrlng lp his hand.
The word was given to fire, and you
can bet there was no time lost. Their
fleet of fourteen ships, the forts, arsenal
and navy yard (larger than Mare Island)
fired on us all at one time. Their inner
fort has ninety large guns, all told, so
you can see we were kept very busy for
a while. ' We were fighting one hour and
thirty minutes when the Spanish admiral
struck Ms colors. Three hearty cheer*
went up from our boys, but it was only
fur a few minutes, as the Spanish ad
miral hoisted his Hay on another ship,
the Castllla, as his first flagship was all
ablazi . and sinking fast.
We then wi nt at it ag-ain, this time
with more determination to do or die.
In ;i short time we had their whole fleet
on tire and the torpedo boats driven on
the beach. At 8:30 the word came to
Tiring, as there was not a Spanish
fi.ig floating anywhere in sight to shoot
:it.
We then called on th<* Governor General
to sin-render all the forts, which he did.
One dose was enough for him, and now
wo have spiked every gun in this har
bor. ,
John, our forefathers may be dead, but
if you had Been that battle you would
think their spirit as much alive to-day
as ever it was. I tan tell yÂ»u that wa
avenged the deaths of our dead com
rades of the Maine in good old American
style. Before this battle if they knew
you were an American they would spit
in your face. But since the bombard
ment things have changed. When they
meet an American now they saJute him
with both hands.
One man was found with his hand on
the throttle, with a shot through his
body. We found him on one of the small
gunboats that had retreated up the river.
During the engagement one of the maga
zines in the arsenal was struck with an
eight-inch shell and exploded, killing: 800
men.
We expect another fleet out here soon.
and when they do come we will give
them a warm reception. We are lying as
peacefully here now as if nothing had
happened, but we have our weather eyÂ«
open on the Spaniards.
I will give you the full details in my
next letter. No more at present. Re
spectfully, H. J. WAJ-SH,
U. S. S. Olympia.

ANOTHER bc-y who saw the bat
tle of Manila is W. J. Nokas. A
few weeks ago he was living In
this city, but he thought he would
like to see "a little action," so
he joined the Olympia as an apprentic*
and sailed away to where fighting wai
to be had. And beautiful fighting it
was, according to the story he haa Just
sent home to his relatives in this city.
Of course the story of the battle of
Manila has been told as well as it ever
will be told, but there were incident*
connected with it that escaped the
watchful eyes of the correspondents.
Before the battle commenced, say*
young Nokas, there was great conster
nation among the crew of the Olympia
over the fear of flying splinters. ThÂ«
bluejackets did not seem to have any
fear of being shot by the Spaniards,
but in some mysterious manner got it
into their heads that the shells burst
ing near by would cause the air to b*
filled with fragments of chairs and
tables. To obviate this danger the boy*
watched their chances and threw every
movable piece of woodwork overboard.
Of course they did not suffer from
flying splinters during the heat of th*
hard-fought battle, but when breakfast
time came they had to eat standing up*.
And the chances are they have been
eating that way ever since, for the cap
tain did not like the foolish destruction
of Uncle Sam's furniture. However,
after considering the way the boys be
haved during the engagement he mad*
no attempt to punish any of them.
Young Nokas saw the first shot of
the battle fired by the Baltimore. HÂ«
â was right in the thick of the fight,
where shells were bursting all around
and Spaniards were being killed by th*
hundred, and says that he did not feel
the least bit afraid.
The excitement was so great that
none of the boys had time to think of
feeling afraid. But after It was all
over and they saw the exeat destruo
tion that had been caused the Span
iards they fully realized the horrors of
war and were glad they had such a
grand leader as Dewey, who saved
them from a similar or worse fate.

CUT CABLES WITH THE BULLETS RAINING AROUND THEM .
"ALL THIS WHILE THE BULLETS AND SHELLS FELL THICK AND OUR BOATS WERE FULL OF HOLES, BUT WE KEPT SHOOTING AND CUTTING AWAY."
Special War Correspondence of The Call.
KEY WEST, Pja., June 9.â ln
the hospitals of Key West to
day I heard from lips that
twitched with pain, while the
eyes above them flashed with
pride, simple stories told by
the heroes of the war between the Uni
ted States and Spain â the common
sailors who have given of their blood
for their country.
They made no boast of their valor;
they made no complaint of their suf
fering; they grieved that they were
wounded, but only because their com
panions, more fortunate than they
when shot and shell were raining, had
sailed away in search of further glory
and had left them helpless behind.
MoÃt of them are young fellows; all
of them are above the average of In
telligence. They are the victims of
their first experience In action; they
told me it was target practice.
In a stuffy ward at the barracks I
found a â¢fair, curly headed youngster
who wrote his name for me, "H. Kush
meister, of New York," and who, when
I asked him what he was, said: "Oh,
just a marine â one of McCalla's of the
Marblehead."
Men who care for details in history
can well spare adjectives to praise him.
He was one of those brave spirits who,
in launches, protected only by their
rifles and a small rapid firing gun
whose supply of ammunition lasted

only a few minutes, cut the cables at
Cienfuegos in the faces of fifteen hun
dred Spaniards pouring bullets in
streams from the Mausers.
A bullet entered his mouth and tore
a terrible exit through his left cheek.
He is up, however, and cheerful, though
now and again the pain is so great that
tears are forced from his eyes and the
torture of talking is awful.
"Yes," he said, when I asked him to
tell me about his experience, "they had
us in a tough place, and if they had
been any good we never would have
got back to the Marblehead alive. We
left the ship, some of us in a steam
launch and others in a sailing launch.
From the Xashville men were sent in
the same fashion.
"We were picked â that is, we were
volunteers. I got into it because I
have lots of medals as a marksman
and wanted to show that I could hit
Spaniards as well as targets. We went
out to cut those cables under orders,
and we did it â all but one, and that
doesn't amount to anything, because
it only runs to Santiago. Of course
we were under the guns of the cruiser
and the gunboat, but. then, we ran in
about forty feet from the shore, and
could see the whiskers of the Spaniards
once In a while before we got views of
their retreating backs. But I guess
I'll have to give it up now. This mouth
of mine where the Mauser hit me is be
ginning to howl for me to stop.
"How does it feel to be hit by a Mau
ser? I can't just tell you that, be
cause I don't know. I just didn't have
any head at all. You spe, I was kneel
ing in the boat and taking aim. Oh,
I had a beautiful bead on a Spaniard

next thing I knew I had a sore face,
and was on the "Wlndom, being taken to
Key West. Davis, I guess you'd bet- "
ter take up the story now. I'm done
up on talk."
Davis had hobbled into the room on
crutches while I was listening to his
mate. He is known to his shipmates on
the Marbleheod as "Jock," and is a
gunner's mate. His shore home is New
York. He is sturdy, not more than
24 years old, and a splendid type, of
bright-eyed boyish-faced manhood, and
is happy, although a bullet ploughed a
hole clear through his right leg below
the knee.
"Well, you sue," he began, "it was
just like this. Our captain, McCalla,
said he wanted some men to go out in
small boats and cut those cables, and I
was in the bunch that wanted to go
and take a shot or two to help get
square fcr t-.e Maine. Well, the captain
that day he lined us up on deck and he
says:
" 'Now, boys, I want you to know
what you're doing. You ain't going to
no picnic. This isn't a Sunday-school
party, or an excursion, either. Some of
you may come back dead, maybe, so
now's your cha.ice to get out of it.'
"That made us ju^t hurry to get the
boats out, anO. away we started, and
just as we were petting under way poor
Reagan â him that was killedâ says,
'Boys, there ain't a Spanish bullet ma'do
that can kill me.' Poor old boy, they
sent one clean through his head from
the front and he dropped dead in the
boat.

CABLES OF THE WORLD ARE
"MESSENGER CALLS" IN WAR TIME
They are a tremendous advantage over old time methods, and now a naval surprise is almost
an impossibility. The recent maneuvers of the American and Spanish fleets in Cuban waters is a fair
sample of the game which the cable makes it possible to play in naval operations. Below will be
found a comprehensive article on how the big powers use this "world-wide messenger service" in
war time.
ORMERLY when two nations
engaged in a naval war it was
possible for either to so direct
the movements of its fleets as to
keep the enemy constantly guess
ing, uncertain where to expect an at
tack. The cable has changed all this,
he can direct his own game, whether
it be to checkmate his rival or to sweep
him from the board.
The experience of the past few weeks
has proved that a surprise is practical
ly impossible in a naval attack at the
present day. Even in the broad At
lantic a fleet is hardly able to shake
off the newspaper correspondents who
can always reach some cable office in
time to inform the world of its move
ments. On its first approach to land,
whether that land be hostile or neutral,
there are more correspondents and
agents of the enemy's government to
herald its approach. The cablegram
can travel a million times as fast as
the swiftest cruiser and with the pres
ent network of cable lines it can
travel to almost any corner of the
globe.
It was the cable that made it possi
ble in the present war for the Ameri
cans to win theif first victory on the
opposite side of the world within ten
days of the declaration of hostilities.
It is the cable that has permitted the
officials in Washington to follow and
direct the movements of the fleets
under Sampson and Schley and Howell,
and to keep tabs on the Oregon during
her long journey around tne Horn.
As soon as Spain's flotilla left the
Cape Verde Islands the cable made it
known in Washington. In all the isl
ands of the Caribbean men waited to
Ing balls from hell all around us. One
solid shot as big as your head went
between me and Lieutenant Anderson
and just missed sending us to grlory by
dropping in the water a few inches
away. Then the Marblehead and the
Nashville bega . to give it to them hot,
and the Spaniards kept answering with
Mausers and from a battery that we
couldn't make out for a while, vntll we
paw that the sneaks had played a mean
trick.
"You know by International law a
lighthouse is safe in war. Well, what
did those Spaniards do but use the
lighthouse t<> throw us offâ that is, they
put the battery In front of the light
house.
"Well, after a while we got about
forty feet from the shore, and while
some were firing away with their rifles
at the men on shore more of us fished
for eablÂ«s. At last we got one up on
the boat and began to saw. It took
half an hour to do that, and the bullets
were falling worse than a thunder
storm of rain drops.
"I got hit in the right leg. At first I
didn't fed nothing and then when the
bullet spread my leg felt bigger than a
New York sky scraper. A couple of
other fellows got hit, too, but we kept
our mouths .shut, us that didn't faint,
because we didn't want to make the
follows that was working scared. But
I,ord! you couldn't scare them if you
told them a ton of dynamite was under
them.
"And It's a fact, sir, we was over a
lot of mines. We found it out after
wards. We saw a fellow â or it was
poor Ernest Suntzenlcn of Brooklyn,
that died here after his leg was cut
off, that spotted him. I'm getting ahead
announce the fleet's appearance. It ar
rived at Martinique. The news was
flashed to Washington. Washington
flashed its orders back to Sampson.
Sampson moved east. The Spanish
squadron disappeared. In a day a cable
gram from the Dutch island of Cur
acao announced its arrival there. Again
the news was flashed to Sampson and
again Sampson changed his course in
accordance with its import.
This is a fair sample of the game
which the cable will make it possible
to play in any naval operations. Of
course it is a two-bladed weapon. Spain
has been as well informed of the move
ments of the American ships as we
have of the porformances of the Don's
sailors, In some cases perhaps better.
Spain controls more ends of th-? many
stranded line than does the United
States, at least more of the ends that
are of importance in the present con
test. This may lessen the advantage
of the new war factor from our point
of view; it does not lessen ita import
ance.
A perusal of the war news of the past
few weeks may have given thf- reador
a bettor idea of the cable system of the
world than he had before, but at best
it is likely that his conception of its
magnitude is haxy and Incorrect. For
his instruction it may be mentioned
th*t there are in rough numbers 200,000
miles of cable under the nvers, bays'
and oceans of our little round earth,
ana that these are under the control of
some thirty different governments and
as many private companies. This great
stretch of wire weighs probably 8 000,
000 tons and is enough to encircle the
globe eight times.
As a matter of fact, It does not really
encircle the globe. The Pacific has
never been spanned by the cable, but
the Atlantic and Indian Oceans and
nearly all the smaller seaa have been
of the story, but here goes.
"There was a little house where the
cable landed. Suddenly Sunteznlch hol
lers, 'There's a Spaniard with whis
kers!' and sure enough, we saw a fel
low running toward the little house.
'Watch me hit him,* and he did hit
him, too. It was his last shot. A bul
let struck him a minute later and
wounded him so that when his leg was
cut off he died. Well, the fellow with
the whiskers, we found out afterward,
was running to that little house to
touch off the mines there and blow
us up.
"All this, while the bullets and shells
was thick and our boats got almost
full of holes, but only five of us and one
from the Nashville got hurt. By and
by the Spaniards began to feel the heat
and ran away to cool off. There was
about fifteen hundred of them. The
lighthouse battery kept on pumping,
but our boys stuck to their work and
sawed another cable.
"Then we picked up the third cable,
but we were about ready to sink and it
only went to Santiago anyway, so we
went back to the ship."
"What did the captain say to you
when you returned?" I asked.
"Oh, I don't know about that," was
the reply. "When T got back to the
Marblehead my leg began to hurt. But,
Bay, bore's a fellow that ought to be
dead by what the doctors said. Come
on, Hendrlchsen, and tell how you
fooled them."
A young man with timid down on
lip and cheek stopped up to me, drew
back his blouse and showed me a patch
of plaster low down on his right side.
"I wish you'd tell my friends in New
Tork that the Spaniards couldn't kill
crossed by it. The furthest stretch at
present traversed by the line of elec
tric communication is from the West
ern coast of America across the Atlan
tic, Europe, Asia and Australasia, to
the French penal settlement at New
Caledonia, in the Pacific, which is be
tween 4000 and 5000 miles from San
Francisco.

me," ne saia. "I was slated to die, but
here I am and I'll be fighting again if
they don't hurry up and finish this war.
You see this plaster in front of me cov
ers an end of a hole that goes right
through me. The other end is in my
back. See â " and he showed me a sim
ilar plaster, but larger, that covered
the place where the Mauser made its
exit.
While Hendrlchsen was showing his
wonderful wound to me a man in a
neighboring bed sat up. His head was
swathed in bandages and he could not
talk, but at a sign from him "Jack"
Davis briefly told me his story. His
name is Robert Volz, his home San
Francisco and his ship the Nashville.
"He was hit six times," said Davis,
"and two bullets made wicked tracks
in his head. Others grazed his body, a
couple of them just being far enough
out to miss his heart, but they made
their marks just above It. He'll be all
right in a few weeks."
J. J. Doran of Fall River, Mass., a
boatswain's mate on the Marblehead,
was also in the hospital. He was sleep
ing while I was a visitor there. His in
juries are not serious.
From the barracks hospital I went to
the convent, which has been turned
over to the Government, and there I
found battered heroes of the lowa at
San Juan. First was George Merkle of
New York, a private of marines, who
was so badly wounded in the right arm
that the doctors cut it off last Sunday.
Only two of the men there were able
to tell their story. They were John
Engle of Baltimore and John Mitchell
of New York, both able seamen.
Mitchell was wounded by a fragment
of shell that tore to his ribs on the
right side and Engle carried crutches
because of a damaged right foot.
"The bombardment of San Juan,"
said Engle, "was mostly amus<_iiifnt
for the men on the lowa. We didn't
lose a shell we sent toward the bat
teries, because, you see, ever since the
Maine was blown up we have had tar
get practice nearly every day and we
bad no excuse for wasting ammuni
tion.
"I remember that I heard one man

time she was fired, 'I wonder how many
Spaniards that hit?'
twelve of them crossing the Atlantic.
Of these five belong to the Anglo-
American Company, three to the Com
mercial Cable, one to the Direct United
States, one to the French Atlantic, and
two to the American Telegraph and
Cable Company, which is operated in
connection with the Western Union.
The many lines and the resultant
competition have brought the cost or
communication between New York and
London down to a fairly low figure,
25 cents per>word, but when one tries
to r^ach more remote parts of the
"How did we feel under fire? Why,
just full of fun. The boys were sing
ing, and down on the berth deck,
where the batteries were being held in
reserve, they had a series of waltzes
while we were at work in the turrets
and on the spar deck. There was
singing and cheering and some of us
enjoyed good smokes while the firing
was going on.
"Suddenly a shell burst over our
heads and there came a rain of metal.
The doctor rushed up from the sick bay
and asked the chaplain if anybody had
been hurt.
"The chaplain said 'Yes,' and they
took three of us below. That stopped
the gayety for a while, and some of
the boys crowded down to see how bad
ly we were hurt. They went back to
work in a minute, though, and as soon
as they saw the damage done by the
next gun they cheered harder than
ever.
"We didn't fire so many shots at thÂ«
forts. The Spaniards wasted an aw
ful lot on us. We just fooled them.
The ships on which pieces of shells fell
were not the ones they aimed at. Wo
were sailing in column in a circle and
firing when we got in line with our ob
ject. At first we went by at twpnty
one hundred yards. The Spaniards
tried to get that range, and I suppose
they got It, but our next move was to
go in at eighteen hundred yards, and
the shells from the forts went over us.
Of course, some of the ships going
around the circle were at the twenty
one hundred yard distance while we
were farther in. That was how the
New York and lowa happened to be
hit by bursting shells. The Spaniards
aimed at the inside ships, they thought,
and went away over them."
"How did you feel when you were

AT MANILA.
WE fully understand and appreciate the objections of the Fed
eral authorities against using women nurses at the present
time. To send two or even half a dozen women nurses, with
out any general head, or without definite instructions, would
undoubtedly do more harm than good.
But if the time comes when a large corps of nurses must be sent to
Manila we have a plan by which the women nurses can be used, and un
der which systematized and properly conducted course the present ob
jections to women nurses would not hold.
This plan is to buy a ship with large decks suitable to that tropical
climate, and to send a large body of nurses over on this vessel. At
ManilaÂ»this vessel could be used as a hospital and the sick soldiers
moved to it. The nurses could be divided into squads, each squad un
der an efficient head, and a general authority over all. On board the
ship, with the cooling breeze, the sick would be far more likely to re
cover than on shore. Of course, in case of battle, the nurses would land

front, could take care of the sick and wounded who may be invalided

Despite the fact that it has been publicly and semi-officially stated
that women nurses will not be used at Manila, we have had constant and
earnest appeals- from women asking that their services in the camp and
field be accepted.
Considering that the decree has gone forth debarring women from,

HERE IS A MACHINE THAT SHOWS
HOW DRUGS POISON MEN
It is a device Intended to show the action of the pulse- when af
fected by nicotine, morphine, alcoohol and other drugs. It is called a
sphygmograph, or in plain English a "pulse measurer." When ad
justed to the wrist it accurately registers each pulse wave and leaves a
tracing for reading the result of the register.
THE latest toy of the physician Is
a little device Intended to show
the action of the pulse. "Pulse
writing" is * what the name
means In plain English.
Dr. Carleton Simon of New York has
demonstrated by the sphygmograph
how various phases of emotion affect
the heart.
"I believe most thoroughly in the val
ue of the sphygmograph." said Dr. Si
mon. "The tracings representing the
pulse wave obtained by It are of the ut
most value in determining the normal
condition of the heart itself, the circu
lation and the respiratory organs as
weH as the effect of stimulants upon
them."
The doctor then proceeded to prove
tho truth of his words by putting the
Bphygmograpb to the test upon some
subjects provided for the purpose.
First a tramp was ordered up to the
big armchair, and with several sus
picious glances at the queer little in
strument lying on the table beside him
sat down, evidently with an inward
qualm.
"Well, my man," aald the doctor,
"how long is it since you have had a
drink?"
"A week," replied the weary one.

How to Solve the Famous Secret Ciphers
THE Federal cipher codes during
the Civil War were very simple
and yet absolutely secret, arbi
trary words being used to repre
sent proper names, and also
many ordinary words and military
phrases. The words of the entire body
of the dispatch, after being concealed
In this manner, were then arranged In
one of over a thousand possible com
binations, the particular combination
being Indicated by a key word, and as
each combination had several key
words it was not necessary to use the
same one twice In succession. As a
feature of the combination blind words
were interspersed at regular or vary
ing Intervals, which, in translation,
were of course discarded.
When finally prepared for transmis
sion the dispatch was wholly unintel
ligible to the transmitting or receiving
operator, and no case Is recalled of the
enemy having translated a Federal
cipher dispatch. On the other hand,
many of the rebel cipher dispatches
which fell Into our hands by capture
or through our spies were translated
by our cipher operators, and thus im
portant military information was se
cured by our commanding generals.
The rebels, instead of adopting a plajn
similar to ours, which was at once se
cret and speedy, made use of the crude
plan of transposing the letters of the
alphabet In various ways.
In some causes the hieroglyphic pHtn
was adopted by the rebels, and it was
this method which was followed in the
instances referred to below.
A fur bolder plot was being hatched
in New Ymk city, having for its im
mediate object the seizure of two large
ocean steamers, when one or two days
out by rebel agents, who were to ship
as passengers or crew. The scheme
included also the shipment as freight of
crates, packages and hogsheads, osten
sibly containing merchandise, but
which in reality contained guns, small
' arms, ammunition, etc, for the use of
the pirates after they had overpowered
the loyal crew and obtained control of
the ship.
The seizure of two ocean steamers
and their conversion into privateers
would create dismay and consternation
in the North, and would perhaps be
followed by the capture of many small
craft, merchant vessels and Govern
ment transports, and possibly the de
struction of some of our seaport towns.
Meanwhile the rebel government was
actually having a large and varied is
sue of Confederate bonds ongraned and
printed almost within sight of the old
tombstone in Trinity Church Yard, and
communications on the subject of such
bonds were passing to and fro between
the rebel govern inert In Richmond and
Its agents in New York City, the me
dium of these communications being
the very same hieroglyphics which
were carved on that old tombstone
nearly one hundred years before.
These deep-laid plots were fortunate
ly revealed to the Federal authorities in
time to prevent their fulfillment. The
date set for the seizure of the two
ocean steamers was Christmas, 1863,
and only. I qur days previous to tha^
he added, evidently feeling that some
explanation was needed.
"Well, will you have a drink of
whisky now, Just to show how the
stimulant affects your pulse?" asked
Dr. Simon.
The man's eyes glistened and he
drew a deep breath of anticipation as
he remarked emphatically, if lacon
ically:
"Would I? Search me," and he wiped
his mouth with the back of his hand.
"It is much better," said Dr. Simon,
as he carefully measured out four
ounces of whisky in a graduated medi
cine glass, "to take a subject who is
used to hip drinks. There will be less
dang*r of bad results, and the fact that
this man has had no alcohol in his sys
tem for a week will show us a satisfac
tory difference in his pulse wave before
and after taking the stimulant. â¢
"Not yet, my man," he added, as the
thirsty subject reached for the glass.
"First I must see the tracing which
your pulse will give before the drink."
While talking the doctor adjusted the
delicate instrument on the man'? wrist
by means of rubber bands. Next he
held a strip of aluminum about half an
inch wide and six inches long, over the
flame of a candle until the surface was
blackened. Then he moved the machine
with infinite patience until it was di
rectly over the man's pulse.

time the first of the two rebel ciphers
was translated by the trio of War De
partment cipher operators, and the As
sistant Secretary of War, Mr. Charles
A. Dana, started for New York at 7:30
p. m. the same day to confer with Gen
eral Dix, and before the date Bet for
the seizure of the ocean vessels the
rebel plotters and agents had been
spotted, a watch set upon their move
ments, and within a week they had all
been arrested, and millions of rebel
bonds seized and destroyed Instead of
being used in England and France to
help pay for the rebel ships of war then
being built in those countries.
The history of these two rebel ciphers
is as follows:
They were each enclosed in an enve
lope addressed to Alexander Keith Jr.,
Halifax, Nova Scotia, and were mailed
from New York City; the first one be
ing dated December 18, 1863, and the
second one four days later.
United States Consul Jackson at
Halifax had previously reported that
Keith was in frequent communication
with rebel blockade runners and with
rebel agents in the United States. The
mails were therefore being closely
watched, and when Abraham Wake
man, postmaster, discovered the enve
lope bearing Keith's address, which was
dropped in the New York postofflce on
December 18, he promptly sent it to the
Secretary of War, who, on seeing that
the enclosure was in cipher, turned it
over to the War Department clerks,
who vainly puzzled over the mysterious
signs for two days.
On the third day the Important docu
ment was turned ovei to the telegraph
department and placed in the hands of
the trio, who set to work with a de
termination to do what the War De
partment clerks had failed In doing.
In my boyhood days I was for a short
period employed in the store of John
Home & Co.. Pittsburg, and as one of
their cost marks was based upon the
thirteen prime characters taken from
the two geometrical figures shown be

the slight differences between the seve

as follows, the Arabic numerals and
the dollar and cent mark being shown
in their respective places:

said, holding out the glass to the man
In the rebel cipher letter the two
words "before this" are represented by
signs taken from the series last above
shown, and as the letter c occurred
twice, we followed the clew, but only
with limited success.
Meantime my associates had found
other clews, there beln* in fact at
least ten separate and distinct series
of cipher characters used in the Keith
letter. Cammack, however, made the
vital mistake of conflnine himself to
only one series for any given word.
Had he varied the Berles of symbols,
taking the characters from tÂ«vo or more
different series to represent each word
the result of our efforts might have
been far different. Together we la
bored for hours, at first with only a
few detached words being revealed, but
little by little the whole matter was de
ciphered.
The following Is an exact copy, and
is all we had to work from:
After we had translated the above
hieroglyphics, the following Is what ap
peared :

Two days after we had interpreted
the first cipher dispatch another one,
dated December 22, and also enclosed

was nlaccd before us, and was quickly
translated.
This communication proved to be of
almost equal Importance, referring as
It did to the fact that Confederate
notes and bonds were being engraved
and printed in New York City.
The second cipher was prepared In
the same way as the first, and Its
translation Is as follows:

The doctor obtained a very good
tracing of her pulse-wave, then hand
ed her the cigarette. While waiting for
ihe nicotine to take effect Dr. Simon
spoke of the results of chloroform,
ether, nitrous oxide gas and morphine
upon the nervous item aa demon-
Btrated by the pulse-waves.
"The effect is similar in each case,"
he said. "The entire nervous system Is
affected, and the heart is, of course,
stimulated to quicker action."
Most opportunely to the subject In
question, at that moment one of the
doctor's patients was announced, suf
fering from a piece of broken glass
imbedded in the hand. A delicate op
eration seemed necessary and the pa
tient requested an opiate.
When the coincidence of the occur
rence with the line of experiment was
explained the patient of his own ac
cord suggested that a tracing of his
pulse-wave should be taken when he
was under the influence of chloroform.
Long before this the young woman
had finished her cigarette and had ob
tained a successful tracing of her
pulse-beat, which showed the influ
ence of even that small amount of nic
otine in her system.
"The question whether nicotine af
fects the action of the heart is rather
clearly demonstrated, is it not?" re
marked the doctor. "If one cigarette
produces so marked a difference in the
pulse of a healthy woman what must
be the effect of constant smoking upon
women of weaker physique, or with
any heart difficulty? Any artificial
quickening of the heart action is inju
rious." And the doctvrr calmly lighted
a cigarette.
"I have tracings of the pulse waves of
thirty persons taken before and dur
ing natural sleep," he continued. "You
Will notice that during natural sleep the
wave Is slower, fainter and more reg
ular. After sleep, the nervous system
being refreshed and strengthened, the
tracing shows that the pulse is stronger
and quicker.
"During the hypnotic sleep," contin
ued the doctor, his eyes brightening as
he broached his favorite topic, "the
pulse- wave denotes even greater regu
larity of the heart action and more
complete relaxation of the nervous sys
tem than in sleep."
A hypnotic subject was present in the
The "password cipher" is based upon
some keyword or password. Any word
may be chosen for the keyword, and it
may consist of any number of letters.
After the keyboard is fixed upon the ci
pher is made in the same manner as the
one here illustrated. In the cipher here
given the keyword is "prudent ia."
After the letter "p" an alphabet is
written in order commencing with the
next letter after "p" which Is "q." The
next alphabet commences with "s," as
this letter follows "r." Each of the
following alphabets is made in a simi
lar manner. In writing with this cipher
the first word of the message should
be written from the first cipher al
phabet; the second word from the sec
ond alphabet, and so on, repeating if
necessary. Suppose it were necessary
to write the sentence, "Thf spy is in
camp." "The" written from the first
alphabet is JXU; "spy" would be rep
sented (second alphabet) by KHQ. and
the entire sentence would look like this:
JXU KHQ DN MR HFRU.
As in this cipher the same letter is
represented by different characters its
solution without a key is practically
impossible.
I will now illustrate a form of cipher
which, as far as I know, has never been
used. It might be called the "magic
square cipher." The key can be writ
ten from memory in a few minutes, and
it has no complications. Below is an
ordinary magic square based on the
number 5.
There are other magic squares that
can be made with the same set of num
bers, but I have given the one most
easily constructed. The rule for mak
ing magic squares is very simple, and
may bo found in the encyclopedias. For
illustration the following sentence will
be used:
"Communicate with me to-morrow."
In the space in the magic square oc
cupied by the figure 1 is written the
first letter of the sentence, "C," the^sec
ond letter "O," is placed in the space
where 2 is found; the third letter where
3 falls, and the remainder of the letters
are similarly placed. The message ap

Sure enough, the man was asleep. His
breathing and the relaxed condition of
his body showed it.
"You are going still deeper asleep,"
said the hypnotist, speaking In a slow,
monotonous tone.
The man's face became flushed and
he breathed quickly.
"You are a ton of lead. Your arms

The subject was sound asleep.
The doctor occupied himself with ar
ranging the slips for the sphymograph,
speaking to the man at regular inter
vals. "Sleep as soundly, as deeply as
you can," said the doctor. "Sleepier,
drowsier, sleepier!"
Then the subject breathed very quiet
ly. He was in deep Blumber. The doc
tor raised the lids of his eyes. The pu
pils were contracted. All the muscles
showed a complete state of hypnosis.
"Yes. he is In a good condition for the
experiment," said the doctor. First,
however, he made a few tests to prove
that the man was entirely hypnotized.
"The most infallible proof of all, how
ever," said Dr. Simon, "is that of the
sphymograph. The pulse-waves canÂ«
not lie."
The little slip glided quickly under the
needle and showed the most wonderful
tracing of all. The marks were regu

short and the etching seemed merely a

OF CUBAN INVASION.
General William F. Shaffer "rose from the ranks." He
was 25 years old when the Civil War broke out. He entered
the Seventh Michigan Infantry in 186J as first lieutenant
and served through the war. At its close he was breveted
brigadier- generaL For a long time he has been in command
of the Department of California, with headquarters in San
Francisco.
HE! -waa only a farmer's boy,
tough and lean as hickory, fol

It was an old army comrade who was
talking, and he was taiking of General
William F. Shafter, the man who leads
the flrst army of the United States to
Cuba.
When these two comrades stood near
one another in the battle of Nashville
during the civil war there were behind
them. In the shape of hospital corps,

were left on the field by the scythe of

he was walking behind the reapers
through the harvest fields of Michigan.
"He came from what Lincoln called

if there can be such a thing. It were
better to say that he was born a soldier

HAS THE HUMAN BR AIN REACHED ITS HIGHEST DEVELOPMENT?

HAS the human brain reached the highest point
of development of which it Is capable? There
are many who, looking back down the long
vista of the ages, seeing the names proudly
blazoned on the banners of past centuries, and
remembering what made those names world
famous, and that fame woTld-enduring, as it is, will
answer this query affirmatively.
"Where," Bay they, "In modern times can you
find painters and sculptors and musicians and poets â
even artisans â such as those whose day is over?
Can we rival the pictures of the old masters?â the
Btatues which are at once the inspiration and the de
spair of our most gifted sculptors; the music which,
played first on rudely fashioned and imperfect instru
ments, has come down to us a precious heritage, lift-
Ing our souls nearer heaven whenever we hear Its
wondrous strains and perfect harmonies; the poems
which fire our hearts or soothe our passions now as
they did those of their first hearers in years long gone
by? And what of the hands that built the pyramids
and carved the great Sphynx? Surely nothing better
in these several lines has been since given to the world,
and aa surely the brain of humanity in them finds its
limitations."
Others there are, however, who think differently
and augur from the grand accomplishments of the
past even grander things for the future. They be
lieve in progress and evolution in all things, and what
has been gives them infinite faith in what is to be.
It is a question assuredly worth thinking of and
worth discussing and it has been propounded to a
number of our deep thinkers â who, being persons
vitally Interested in different lines of our world's
work, and viewing the whole field of human en
deavor and accomplishment from their individual
standpoints of observation, ha?ve answered it accord

we ourselves cannot answer.

WILLIAM KEITH,
MM
In art there are heights to which a few have climbed
in the past which have, so far, been unattainable to
all others who have tried to follow in their footsteps.
Take, for instance, the architecture of ancient
Greece or the sculptures of Phidias which are the
work of hands that have been dust for over 2800 years
âthere has never been anything done to excel themâ
nothing even to equal them. They are models still as
they have been through all these past centuries. One
would think that having them constantly before us we
would be able to improve upon them, at least that we
could learn from them to do as well, but bo far we
have not. We study them, we admire them, we try
to ccrpy them, but we go no further.
Perhaps, thouph, the human brain working in
other lines does things which are Just as good in their
way. We are too near modern things to see them at
their best or Judge fairly of their artistic valueâ those
who come after us will see from a different stand
point and more clearly. They will see what haa bee-n
accomplished, not what we are trying to accomplish;
the best work is the work which will live, and by that
work the age will be judged.
I do not say that there may not be In the future
men of genius as transcendent as that which distin
guished the masters of old.
Real genius never was and never will be a common
gift witness how few there are who have stood the
test of years, but things in this world work pendulum
fashion, there is a swing forward and a swing back
ward and a swing forward again. Recurrence Is the
rule and we have only to wait long enough to see it
carried out.
â¢ â¢ â¢
I apprehend that the "brain of
mankind," that is, the raw ma
terial, is much the same in all
ares of the world, and that the
"lost arts" are quite counter
balanced by the new discoveries of to-day. The brain
power which was developed by masters of art in an
other age is utilized in invention making in this age,
and the masters of literature in our age may be the
editors of newspapers in another.
If the world "do move" toward the evolution of a
superior race it ie along cycles of time so Infinite in
their duration as to be almost Inconceivable,
lt is still the fact that William R.
Shafter weighs 300 pounds. That that
little lad of Kalamazoo County has not
developed more physically than in the
knowledge and courage to give battle is
a fact of which men must soon know.
Corbln loves Shafter, as brave men
love one another, and so when I asked
the adjutant general why General Shaf
ter was selected as the leader of the
Cuban campaign I was not surprised
at the answer.
"On account of his rank and con
ceded ability," replied General Corbin,
"his vigor and good judgment. He Is
one of the men in the army who has
been able to do what he was ordered to
do; not a man to find out how things
can't be done."
General Shafter has blue eyes under
heavy, shaggy browsâ the blue eye
which is at once kind and shrewd, with
a hard glint, too, at moments. He has
the "fighting hook nose"; more than
that, it is eommandingly Roman. He
has a Fitz Lee chin that is at once
firm and Jolly. A heavy mustache of
gray, and white hair, parted in the mid
dle. Plenty of room for brains between
the ear line of the facial angle and the
top of his headâ and this head rests
with comely poise on big broad should
ers. A man not quite six feetâ great
soldiers have rarely been so highâ with
comparatively short legs and great
length of trunk for breathing and di
gestion, for which most men of en
durance and distinguished action have
been noted.

that it is because we have, to a great degree, lost our
moral force.
A great and fundamental principle of life 1b that
no people can hope to become powerful, prosperous
and happy who are destitute of this. We must have
faith, vital and practical, we must have honest con
victions and carry them out honestly, or we can never

Individuals or as nations.
Without candor, sincerity and directness of pur

attaining the greatest blessings erf life, or of holding
for any length of time even the semblance of the re

as Individuals, so it is with us when segregated into
th<- political divisions of the world; a frivolous king
dom, or empire or republic may apparently flourish f<rr
a time, but it Is doomed to destruction. For example
remember Babylon, Persia, Assyria, Egypt, Carthage,
Rome and Greece, and in our own times Venice and
Franceâ Venice already dead as far as influence or
standing is concerned, and France ready to become
the captive of the first co-untry that will have her.
Another thing to which ran be traced the, In many
ways, apparent degeneracy of this agp, is the growth
of infidelity, the modern estrangement of the human
mind from its Creator. Those who shut out the great
first cause from their thoughts and HveÃ shut them
selves away from the grandest and highest possibili
ties of existence, and cr/ndemn themselves to medi
ocrity of idea and execution In all their ambitions and
attainments.
One of the greatest sources of the troubles of the
present time, and gravest menaces to the future, Is the
position assumed by women during the past few 3'ears.
Woman Is the foundation of the domestic Institution;
without homes we are neither a people nor a nation,
and we can have no homes when women are more
anxious to take the places of men In business and
public life than to perform the ho-ly duties of wives
and mothers.
It is a pitiable fact that maternity is no longer
looked upon as a blessing â the glorious crown of wo
manhood, but instead Is considered by the majority of
the educated women of the day as a disagreeable re
sponsibility to be avoided If possible. Women who are
bo "respectable" that they would shrink from even the
slightest personal contact with a fellow creature who
had erred in lesser ways will burden their souls with
actual crime for the sake of being free from the re
straint and care of a large family, in which they
should find their highest pride and greatest happiness.
Women can make or mar the world, and when the
most highly educated, refined and intellectual of their
sex becomes unwomanly, fonder of public life and
work and the applause of crowds than of home life
and the loving prattle of children, we cannot hope that
the men of the future will equal those of the past in
(he noble qualities of mind and heart that have given
the world in the past those masters In music, litera
ture and art, those giants in eloquence and statesman
ship, and those heroes in times of danger whose
memories we etlll proudly reverence.

I do not believe that the brain
of mankind has by any means
reached its highest develop

"lost" is no reason why we should not find them again,

When a genius is born into an environment which
calls forth the best that is in him humanity will re

The future is even more likely to produce high
types of mentality than was the past because modern

Mi". Crawford's observation may to a certain ex
tent answer your question. I think that arts flourish
the best where isolation and concentration arc the
greatest.
Israel produced her best and wisest men when her
clannishness was preserved In its purest form, and
this greatness has not been repeated ever since she
became a scattered nation.
Greece was greatest when she was either on de
fense or at the end of her career of conquest. Her
arts disappeared with the rising of the Roman power.
Rome was never great in arts, but we observe that
she excelled in them only when she began to cease to
diffuse her energies cibroad.
The Shakespearean age Just antedated the coloni
zation of America and elsewhere, which havt- ever
since engrossed the attention of England and called
heÂ£ intellectual powers into other channels.
Like the small states of Italy that gave birth to
Michael Angelo and Raphael, Germany was the
brightest when she was divided and isolated. Goethe,
Schiller and Heine rose in those days.
France nowadays leads In art. and it Is well known
that, of all the European nations, she sends abroad
the least number of colonists. A republic In the midst
of monarchies she has been for thirty years an ex
ample of isolation and perhaps also of greatest intel
lectual concentration.
It is simply conditions that give birth to great
acres. In art the world is neither progressing, retro
grading nor stationary, and when the requisite con
ditions are repeated, we will likely have great mas
ters again. Those conditions have nothing to do with
the size of the brain.
California is far from the European influence.
She may be the art center of America, because, as
Marion Crawford suggested, she will be the greatest
in Isolation and consequently concentration.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Is art declining? Has
humanity reached its cli
max? To the individual
the present hour Is all of
life. To-morrow never
comes, rsoming in nature m repeated. Two spring's
can never bloom alike. Man forgets that nature
never ends and never waits. That in the ilivlne,
eternal symphony of his hour Is but one note, struck,'
to be. sure, in proper time and place, yet struck but
once, never to be repeated in such relation. He
thinks that what has been must be; but the truth
is, what has been will never be again. He glues hig
eyes to- the past and cries: "That which is beat is gone
never to return."
This is why we quarrel about art, why we worship
the old masters and see no new masters, no art of to
day.
To nature, humanity is one. She takes plenty of
time for its perfecting. What is undone to-day she
finishes to-morrow. There are periods in human life
which appear to be decadent, but which are only
periods of shifting forces, of changing activities or be
liefs of man himself; such as war changes, false poli
tical life, wrong ideals or declining religious standards.
Any or all of these influences may operate to make
a temporary decline in art. But not any or all of
them are enr/ugh to stop the progress of humanity on
ward and upward forever.
It is true that to-day we write no plays like
Shakespeare's; have no players like Rachel and
Booth, no singer to wear Patti's mantle, no second

the East, it was small wonder that the
people of the East sought to know more
of this man of the hour. In these years
General Shafter had not been idle.

Medici. But there must be a seedtime as well as a
visible harvest. All living things are conceived in the
dark, and In the silence; and those who see beneath
the surface believe that this very despised nineteenth
century is the birthtime of a newer and a better art;
that already art begins to show higher Ideals, more
delicate feeling, more honest effort.
"Art for art's sake" has been the cry of the past;
art for good's sake will be the watchword of the future.
If Michael Angelo painted as never man painted be
fore, or since, it is because his faith and sincerity were
greater than man has since felt.
Autokolsky, the Russian sculptor and art critic,
says: "You see in primitive art a pure faith that
touches you. Enter the convent, fast before you
work, toil on your knees, be affected to tears, and you
will reach the beatific heights Michael Angelo
reached. And if you cannot do that, if you cannot
passionately love your God, then love no less the hu
man soul, its joys and sufferings."
A man's art can never rise higher than his soul;
but "a man's reach should exceed his grasp." The
reach of art for art's sake is not as high as heaven;
but art for good's sake is a reach to the very throne of
God.
Tolstoi has been for years the evangelist of the
doctrine of art for good's sake; and a prominent
French critic, Brunetiere, indorses him, and says that
art is only perfect when its motive is pure, elevating,
and above all things, honest.
Man's ideas of right have in the past been obtained
frr/m external authority. To-day the seat of authrrity
is being shifted to his own soul.
Conscience, educated by self-control and the Gold
en Rule, Is the law of living; and art in any form, ex
pressing the good man's innermost life and convictions,
will be honest art.
As man more and morp appreciates his personal
heritage of "likeness to the Father" he will surely
show It in an art that will transcend all past art, even
as the art of the "old masters" transcends the weak
imitations of them.

their place is filled by things new and of present,
practical utility. The progressive inventions enrich
those that are, and the future surely will hold better

more. She's little like me "
"Little like me," murmured the big man, meekly.
"And doesn't wear glassesâ everybody does, you
knowâ has light hair and smiles. When we went to
school together she always smiled. I should know her
Just by that. Now, say your lesson after me."
He repeated It gravely.
"There, now you may go, dear boy. If he only doesn't
get things mixed," she thought, following the big, square
figure across the room with loving eyes. "If he only does
It right! Pom. Pom!"
"At your service, 'm."
"No, don't come back. Are you certain sure you read
the letter all through?"
"Hoper-may-die if 1 didn't, little woman!"
"O, dear," still worried Heartsease softly, "if I'd only
read It! Why did I have that nervous headache just when
it came? And then why did Pom lose it? O, dear!"
Meanwhile Prof. Pomeroy Pettingill Lee was swinging
down the street with painful alertness in every motion of
bis big figure. He was keeping his mind on cousin
Agatha. Wild horses themselves should not drag it away.
The city clock clanged loudly, insistently In his ears
and reminded him of the flight of time. He hailed a pass-
Ing car and settled himself comfortably on one of Its
cushioned seats. Might as well ride and reserve all his
strength for cousin Agatha.
There was a trilling hitch in his complacent self-resigna
tion when the conductor came around for fares. Where
in the world was that change? Confound it, a man had
as many pockets as a centipede had feet! Ah, there it
was, and something else, â cousin Agatha's lost letter.
"I'll review it a bit, now it's turned up again so handy,"
thought the professor, smoothing out the crushed, sweet
scented sheet on his knee.
"My dear cousinâ m-m-m-m-m-mâ and reach you at
about three forty-five in the afternoon (that's all right
side up) â m-m-mâ what!"
The professor straightened himself aghast with horror.
He had never seen that part beforeâ heavens, no! He
didn't read that to Heartsease. Now, why by all that was
mighty must a woman tack on a postscript to everything
she wrote! And this postscriptâ
The poor man groaned aloud in his extremity, and the
meek little man beside him was moved with pity.
"Are you in pain, sir?" he inquired softly In his ear.
"Pain? pain? I'm in the last extremities. I'm nearly
gone!"
And he was obliged, out of sheer gratitude for the lit
tle man's compassion, to accept one of the tiny white
lozenges he proffered with nervous agility.
"P. S.â l shall bring baby with me. Of course I could
not leave him and, besides, I know he will amuse you. He
is so cunning!"
She was going to bring the baby with her! Cousin
Agatha was going to bring the baby! And Heartsease
hadn't known it, to tell him what to do!
He half arose to his feet with a wild idea of going back
to little Heartsease for directions. Then he sank back on
his seat again, for the city clock was clanging half past
3. Too late!
"You have had bad news, sir?" crooned the little meek
man's kind voice again.
"Yes, O, yes, certainly, confounded bad news! Cousin
Agatha's going to bringâ that â erâ l will bid you good
day. sir. Iâ will get out here."
No need of imposing cousin Agatha's baby on everybody
else, but, confound It, the little meek man didn't look as
if a baby would throw him Into a panic. He probably
had plenty of 'em at home. And they hadn't known-
Heartsease and he hadn'tâ that there was any baby In
cousin Agatha's quarter of the world. But of course
they might have imagined well, there was nothing for
it now but to accept the inevitableâ and the baby. One
to make ready, two to start, three toâ go!
The 3:45 express was just steaming into the great station
with grunts of disapproval at being pulled up. Crowds of
out-goers were eddying toward the long chain of cars, to
be presently met ana jostled by the incoming throng.
Cabmen were shouting' with hoarse persistence and bag
gage was being methodically maltreated. Confusion was
rampant.
Prof. Pomerov Pettingill Lee, with great presence of
mind, waited near the entrance of the ladles' room for
cousin Agatha and the baby. They would have to go
in through that door and out through the opposite oneâ
they could not escape him. He felt a wild Impulse to
accost all the women as they approached with: "Are
you cousin Agatha?â you?â you?"
Fort favored him, for In all the steady stream of
travel-stained, weary women filtering through the door
past him, there were only two babies and one of those
was a little shiny affair In ebony. The other one was, of
course, cousin Agatha's baby.
"Here goes!" muttered Prof. Pomeroy Pettingill Lee,
Betting his teeth and brushing past the babyiess women
with a stifled groan, and fortifying himself with the
memory of little Heartsease.
The white baby's mother was "little"â he docked off
the items on his fingers mentallyâ "didn't wear glasses"
(or did cousin Agatha wear 'em?) and "smiled." To be
sure, it was a very faint, tired smile that, it was evident
enough, was entirely for the baby's benefit. But a smile's
a smile, and this one served to identify cousin Agatha.
The little woman sank down on a seat near the door,
and proceeded to rearrange the baby, whose soiled little
clothes were In a tumble.
The professor, waiting to reinforce his courage, heard
her crooning to it in the fashion mothers haveâ "There,
there, it shall be all smoothy-smooth again, yet It shall!
Mother will drive away all the ugly wrinkles â bo."
The baby crowed appreciatively. The little pink, creased
face swayed, and wriggled into its bonnet.
"Let me take the baby," the professor Bald, plunging
In without foolish waste of ceremony. "There's just time
to catch the 4 o'clock car up."
The weary little mother looked up at the towering bulk
of the big, strange man, with a gasp of meek astonish
ment. He was clutching at that babyâ he had him in his
arms! Land of mercy! But his eyes were honest and

kind.
"Are you Tom?" she stammered, eagerly, searching the
resolute, martyr-like face for possible points of resem
blance to her idea of "Cordelia's husband." "She said
he'd meet us at the depot."
"Certainly, certainly, assented the big man briskly,
thinking cousin Agatha familiar with pet names. No one
but Heartsease called him I'oinâ he did not notice the
changed consonant. But what did it matter? It was the
baby that mattered, and the baby was adjusting himself
to the broad shoulder and crowing like a young bantam.
His grimy little fists were pommeling the professor's
cheekbones with impartial thumpsâ the baby was quite
at home.
"Here she goes! Your bag, ma'amâ that's right. I can
/ake it in my other hand. Now, then, we'll have to step
a bit lively."
And they were presently crossing the great room and
making excellent headway toward the 4 o'clock car up.
Pr.>f. Pomeroy Pettingill Lee was conscious of feeling a
modest degree of pride at his own handiness, with the
crumpled, squirming little budget on his armâ it was easy
enough, if you shut your eyes and plunged in. How proud
Heartsease would be! In his mind's eye he saw her pale
little face lighting up approvingly, and In his mind's ear
Heartsease was saying: "Splendid, Pom! You're doing It
like a hero!"
Poor little Heartsease, In his mind's eye he could not see
the wistfulness in her face that crept in always at the
sight of little childrenâ and in the "dear boy's" arms!
Cousin Agatha's baby plunged wildly and was caught
with a neat trick that presented itself for the emergency
out of the mists of olu baseball days. The danger was
over for that time. Julius Caesar, did all babies have the
St. Vitus dance, or was it an affliction monopolized by
cousin Agatha's baby? How often did the fits come on?
Would there be time to get to the car before the next
one?
A group of the professor's students looked up in undis
guised amazement as the little procession swept by them,
and one of them collapsed weakly, into the arms of the
others.
"Hold me! Save me!" he gasped. "The old chap's
picked up somebody's kid In an absent-minded fit and is
making off with it!"
Half way down the long station the baby's mother
made a discovery that filled her with dismay. "I>and ot
mercy, I've left my little handbag," she cried, but in t*ie
din the professor did not hear. "I must have left It rignt
where I was sittingâ l'll hurry barkâ it's got the baby's
best bonnet in it. I won't be pone more'n a minute!" And
the crowd swallowed up her rusty little figure. On the
corner, outside the station, the car was starting and the
professor and cousin Agatha's baby hailed it wildly.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 12, 1898.
The Professor Struggled Across the Floor arjd Placed the Baby In Y\er Lap.
"Hurry up!" shouted the conductor, crossly, his fingers
twitching on the rope.
The professor stood aside for Cousin Agatha to enter,
and then followed the stout, unwieldy rernale down the
aisle, unsuspecting and serene. So far, everything was
going on finelyâ the saints send a prosperous ending to the
enterprise! He settled himself and readjusted the baby
with an air of off-hand ease thai tallied oddly with his
perspiring, anxious face. He got out his watch and jack
knife for playthings,, opening the knife absently and ex
tending it, handle foremost, with a slight courteous in
clination toward the small grasping fists. Fortunately it
dropped to the floor and Cousin Agatha's baby's life was
saved.
The car jolted on block after block, making stops and
jerking into motion again. It was well "up" before Prof.
Pomeroy Pettingill Lee suddenly realized that it was in
cumbent on him to converse a little with Cousin Agatha.
Certainly, certainlyâ what had he been thinking of? The
baby had fallen asleep and the immediate danger of
another fit was overâ he might look away safely for a
moment.
. "Brâ lt's very pleasant weather," he ventured cheer- â¢
fully.
"It's raining." snapped the stout lady beside him, tilting
her nose in palpable scorn.
By all that was mightyâ she wasn't cousin Agatha!
Where was cousin Agatha? He searched the car with
eager eyesâ he even looked out on the platforms. No
body was cousin Agatha. And cousin Agatha's baby
purred in gentle slumber on his arms! He had left cousin
Agatha s baby's mother behindâ shades of mighty Caesar!
A , wild desire to raise the window and drop the baby out
seized another wild idea of rushing back to the
station surged with kindred impulses through his brain.
A cold perspiratfon broke out all over him.

TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE
of the First U. S. Troops Sent
By Sea to California in 1853.
THE steamer San Francisco, own
ed by the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company, and newly built by
William H. Aspinwall at a cost of
$350,000, left New York on De
cember 21, 1853, for San Francisco, by
way of the Straits of Magellan.
She had on board Companies A, B,
D, G, H, I, X and L of the Third Regi
ment of United States Artillery. These
companies with the non-commissioned
staff and regimental band, constituted
a force of over 600 men. Colonel Wil
liam Gates was the commander, and
Lieutenant-Colonel John M. Washing
ton the second In authority. With the
passengers and crew added the steamer
carried out about 800 persons, though
the exact number has never been as
certained.
The vessel sailed at an inopportune
time. For a month the shipping on the
Atlantic side had suffered most severe
ly by hurricanes and storms of unusual
violence, and there had been no moder
ation. The marine reports in New
York record that at the end of Decem
ber about sixty vessels had gone ashore
In the neighborhood of Cape Cod and
the adjacent coast. The Boston clipper
Staffordshire struck on Seal Island on
the morning of the 31st, and 177 human
beings met a watery grave.
The San Francisco sailed at a time to
encounter the full shock of the storms,
and two days after she left New York
the fury of the elments gave presage
of the awful disaster that was to fol
low.
On the night of the 23d the vessel
suddenly encountered a gale, and at 11
o'clock the scene on deck was terrific.
The sea was a complete mass of foam,
boilin- and swelling like a caldron.
The steamer broached to twice and be-
came unmanageable. The whole crew
strenuously but vainly endeavored to
take in the uailÃ, but they were blown
to ribbons. The foremast was twisted
lika a sapling, though It was large
man's misery anywhere? â_, _,__,!,,
But the door opened and the little woman came slowly.
painfully toward him. . . , âÂ»,Â«Â«.- Â«r, Â«Â»
"O, Pom!" and her voice had reproachful echoes In it.
Walt till she knew the worst! . . . t
In the dusk of the little hall tbe baby escaped Instant
n( "(Â£ e pom, she's comeâ she took a carriage and Just got
here a minute or two ago." _ Â _Â«_Â«.Â«â 
"Who's come? Not cousin Agatha? Tell me Q^*/
"Yes. of courseâ cousin Agatha. Did you forget she was
coming to see us?" . . â Â»
The gentle, reproachful voice tried hard to be stern and
cutting, but he did not heed it in the least. He was push
ing by her. holding out a limp bundle at arm s lenfftn.
"The saints be thanked!" he was ejaculating heartily .
"Let me pass, little woman. I've got her babyâit s an
safe."
"You got what?"
"Cousin Agatha's babyâ here it Is. No, you can't lift It.
I'll carry It in. I've got to face it out, and the L/ord help
mo!"
"Pomeroy Pettingill Lee, you stand stock still where you
are. Don't move. Now tell me everythingâ whisper it."
She hovered weakly between him and the door. The
shrill little voice within kept on insistently and helped
thorn out. The professor deposited the drowsy baby care
fully on the floor and laid his watch on top of it with
propitiatory intent. Then he faced the little woman
boldly.
'â¢1 didn't mean to run away with it. I thought she \*,is
there, tooâ honer-may-dle if I didn't think so, little
women! Hut the little chap is safe enough. I took care
of him. Now, 1> t me present arms and get it over with.
I'd rather face the cannon's mouth."
"But Pomâ O. Pomeroy Petttngill Leeâ but she's got it
now. this minute. Of course, she's got it!"
"("lot what?" thundered the professor, regardless of cau
tion.
"The baby. Cousin Agatha's got the baby. O, where did
you get this one? What have you done?"
She sat down on the floor beside the soiled, tumbled
baby, peering into its little puckered face and fingering
the tiny moist hands. It was a baby, anyhow, however
it eot there.
"Cousin Agatha's got the baby? â this isn't cousin
Agatha's baby?" mumbled the pcofessor stupidly. "Then,"
reviving suddenly, "her's was the black one. There wasn't
any other white baby but this. I guess I can count two!
Â£he had this one when I spoke to her â "
"O, Pom, waitâ do wait! You've got it all mixed up.
You didn't speak to herâ you spoke to somebody else.
Cousin Agatha waited and waited for you and then she
took the hack up. Now, wait, let me think â "
Heartsease rocked herself back and forth In a wild at
tempt to unwind the tangle. Suddenly she stopped and
gazed up at the looming figure sternly.
"Which way did it come, Pom â the train? Did it come
from the west?"
"I â It came from the east," stammered the professor,
getting a mental view of the puffing train Into focus. His
hair rose in anguishâ ho hadn't thought of that before.
"And cousin Agatha's train came from the west," the
voice of Heartsease was saying in his ears, like the voice
of fate.
For a minute they gazed in each other's faces in horri
fied silence. Then they laughed. Cousin Agatha's baby,
on the other side of thÂ« partition, laughed too.
The professor came to himself first, and picked up the
disregarded baby stolidly, arranging the little clothes
with a certain proprietary concern.
enough for the mainmast of a 1000-ton
ship.
A passenger In describing the scene
afterward wrote: "The fury of the tem
pest was such that I could not stand
before It a moment; but I seized the
Iron brace connecting the king bolts
and I surveyed the scene for an Instant.
Then I threw myself on my hands and
knees and made for the nearest hatch
to get below. I reached the main deck.
Here a scene of confusion Indescrib
able and confounding presented Itself.
The livestock, of which there was con
siderable, had escaped from their pens
on the same deck, and soldiers, bul
locks, calves, pigs, sheep and poultry
were all mingled together."
The steamer's guards had been car
ried away sometime previously, and the
sea washed over the deck with every
roll of the ship. The lights were ex
tinguished, and during the night the
darkness was almost total. It was on
this terrible night that an accident oc
curred to the machinery that rendered
the engine useless; the vessel was en
tirely at the mercy of the wind and the
waves.
As the chief officer reported: "Theshlp
Is now makingconsiderable water. Steam
pumps kept running and hand pumps
manned, but the water is gaining. The
troops are organized in bailing gangs
to pass up water through the engine
room."
At 9 o'clock on the morning of the
24th a heavy sea struck the vessel
amidship, which stripped the starboard
paddle box and carried away both
smokestacks and all the upper saloon
and staved in all the quarterdeck.
At that one fell swoop nearly 150 hu
man beings were swept Into eternity.
The majority were private soldiers. One
company lost all but ten of its mem
bers. Four officers went with them â
Colonel Washington, jjvho had distin
guished himself in the war with Mexico
at Buena Vista and on other hard
fought fields; Major George Taylor and
his wife; Captain H. B. Field and Lieu
tenant R. H. Smith.
The sea was covered with drowning
men. The roar of the tempest smothered
the "bubbling cry of strong swimmers

Outside In the cool air the baby woke up and walled in
distinct rebellion to existing circumstance^. â¢
"There-the-re!" crooned the professor wildly, tossing
the little bundle of clothes up and down till the baby in
very astonishment stopped crying and eyed him out of
round blue eyes. Instinctively he seemed^to appreciate
the professor's distress of mind, and gurgled sympathetic
little remarks Intended for comfort. He did not cry again

To take a car and go back to the station was the pro

do. He hailed a car and established himself, and the as
tonished baby In it. 'J..
In a corner opposite sat a little woman In evident dis
tress of mind. She was agitated and uneasy, and seemed
to be searching for something, fumbling about her
anxiously. The professor's gaze lighted . upon her, and
his heart gave an exultant leap. It was cousin Agatha
looking for the baby. The baby's mother "was still "cousin.
Agatha" to the professor's dazed, uncertain nalna.
"She's little and anxious, and she's looking for some
thingâby all that's mighty, I've run against her the first
thing'" he thought in inexpressible relief. He staggered
across to the little woman's corner and dropped the baby
into her lap. ' ' â¢ *- " "' â ,

the wondering baby to him.

breathed freely when he and his unwelcome little i
got off the car. .
"The plot thickens." muttered Prof. Pomeroy PettinpiU
Lee. despairingly. "I reckon we're in for It, little chap."
He hovered weakly about the waiting room for a. whila
and then went to the ticket aj-'ent.
"Isn't there a place here where you leaveâ ahâ things
that have been lost, untilâ" he began.
"Certainly, certainly, sir! We have a room where any"
lost articles are kept until called for by the owner. If you
will pass it to meâ"
The professor applied the rumpled baby to the sma'.l
square opening.
"I guess it'll squeeze throughâ it's limp," he said cheer
fully.
"Mighty Caesar, man, it's a baby! We don't keep that
kind of property! Erâ take it back at once, sir. Iâ it's
going to cryâ sharp or you'll drop It."
Drop it? O, no, there was no danger. There wasn't
any placo on the top of the earth to drop it Into. HÂ»Â»
shouldered it again with a muffled groan, and turned
away. The tiny head nestled against his cheek in drowsy
content. A little thrill of wakening tenderness set the
professor's heart-strings to vibrating gently.
"Poor little chap!" he found himself thinking.
The next plan was to parade the streets. In the des
perate hope of running upon the right mother anon?
all the mothers. "She ought to come toward it like v
needle to a magnet," reasoned Prof. Pomeroy Pfeti
Lee, wisely. "By all that's mighty, I'll give her a fair
chance!"
But the mothers who met them and passed them ar.'l
Jostled them were all the wrong mothers. Once he spied
a little woman, in earnest conversation with a taller one.
They were in evident consultation.
"What would you do? I'm at my wit's end. I have
tried everything," the small woman was saying, rather ex
citedly. Her clear-cut, distinct tones reached the pro
fessor's ear intact.
"I'd advertise," the tall woman said, promptly. "That's
the way I found mine."
By all that was mightâ the professor hurried up to them
eagerly. In his one glimpse of the little woman's face he
was sure it was cousin Agatha. Besides, wasn't she just
on the eve of advertising for the baby?
'"There is no need of it, ma'am," he stuttered hastily.
"I've got it right here. I've been looking for you ever
since I â ah â ran away with it accidentally. I assure you,
ma'am â "
He was pressing the baby upon her, regardless of the
fact that the small red face was In inverse ratio to mother
nature's plans for it. The bewildered little woman stared
helplessly down at the back of the baby's head.
"Why," she gasped.
"Of all things!" cried the taller lady. Then they both
laughed. The professor's crestfallen, despairing face was
too much for them.
"Give it back," he said with a groan. "I've hit on the
wrong one apaJn. I've bfcen hunting all over everywhere
to find its mother. I'm not certain now It ever had one.
There isn't anything certain!"
"I'm sorry." the little woman cried heartily. Her swept,
pleasant voice cheered him unconsciously. "But you see,
it isn't my baby. Mine's at home in its cradle. I don't
see what made you thinkâ"
"You spoke of advertising, ma'am."
"O, yes,â was that it? I was going to advertise for a
cook!"
"But really," Interposed the other lady curiously "I
wish you'd tell us how you came by the baby."
"I ran away with it," the professor said, gloomily, "and
with your permission I'll do bo nerain now."
And once more he was continuing his hopeless hunt,
shifting the Bleeping baby from one tired arm to the
other, and peering anxiously Into all the little women's
r found her I shouldn't dare to hand the little chap
over to her." he mused. "It's mierhty risky business!"
But help was at hand. It came from the quarter least
expected. The professor met two of his college boys and
in the frenzy of despair stopped them.
"Boys." he said, "if you had somebody else's baby and
didn't want it, what would you do with it?"
"Drop it." said one of the buys promptly. The other
one's face was suddenly enlightened.
"O. I say, professor, you come along with me. I knn^r
where she is," he cried, and his voice was music in Prof.
Pomeroy Pettfngill Lee's oars.
"I was down at the station, you know. I saw her whea
she got back and you weren't there. Hi! didn't she rave
(hough! Then somebody came along that she called
'Tom. 1 T heard 'em say they were going to the station to
set the police on you."
The boy laughed. He was hurrying the professor alonsr.
"Here. 1,-t me take the little kid. You 1 look all used up
We'll find her all right, professorâ don't you worry Here's
the Btationâ and, here you are, professor* Here's 'the kid's
mother herself."
This time the baby and the ripht mother came together
with perfectly satisfactory results
Prof Pomeroy PettirigiH Lee never remembered what
explanations he made or how he got home. His memory
! a gap there and began again at the front door
where pale, anxious little Heartsease met him
"O. Pom?" Her voice and the upward inflection asked
everything. His voice answered her
â â â¢)â . â -. Heartsease."
She laughed aloud with relief.
"Then come right in, dear boy. and spe cousin Agatha'M

He stopped at the threshold. "Never!" he cried grimly.
"I've seen all of cousin Agatha's baby I want to." y *
succeeded in regaining the steamer.
Up to this time the water in the ves
sel had been kept under control, but
this sea raised it so much that the
soldiers almost gave up \n despair, and
it was only with the greatest exertion
that the ship was kept afloat. But in
the succeeding days the worst leaks
were stopped and the decks patched up
with pieces of sail in the effort to save
the ship.
For a time there was a prospect of
setting the machinery in working order
and of reaching port. A temporary
steering apparatus was erected and an
attempt made to get the ship under
control, but after one or two revolu
tions of the wheel it was pronounced
hopeless and the most that could be ac
complished was to keep the pumps
working.
Then death was encountered in a n*Â»w
form. A very large portion of the
ship's steerage had been filled with
cargo, military stores and provisions,
and it had been expected that the sol
diers would sleep in the berths on I
deck. When the storms were encoun
tered this arrangement was impracti
cable and they were driven below into
confined and unhealthy quarters. Willie
the vessel was abundantly provisioned
it was almost Impossible to prepare it
by cooking; to add to the distress near
ly all of the medicines were washed
overboard or destroyed. A disease broke
out in the form of Asiatic cholera, com
mencing with diarrhoea and terminat
ing in death in a few hours. For sev
eral days the mortality averaged ten
a day and men, women and children
fell indiscriminately. The losses on th?
San Francisco and on the rescuing vs
sels by deaths from disease are esti
mated at about one hundred.
On the 28th the bark Kilby of Boston
was spoken. Her captain signaled
that he would stand by the distressed
steamer, but it was not until the even
ing of the following day that the Konn
so moderated that transfers could be
made of the passengers. The Kilby
took on 108 persons that evening, and
intended to resume the work of rescue
the next morning, but during the night
the vessels were separated and after
a fruitless search for two days for the
steamer the bark sailed for port. Much
of the cargo of the Kilby was thrown,
overboard to make room for the pas
sengers. She was not provisioned for
bo great a number and there was great
Buffering and many deaths before the
port was reached. Had it not been
that a portion of her cargo consisted of
corn and that rain fell in abundance
many .more of those she rescued would
have perished. As Jt was the mortal,
ity from the cholera was frightful
On the 31st the San Francisco en
countered a renewal of the storm, and
all available hands were employed in
throwing overboard the coal and other
I heavy portions of her cargo, and in
working at the pumps. During the
night distress guns were fired.
At 9 o'clock the next morning the
ship Three Bells of Glasgow wa3
spoken and she laid to with the steamer
until the 3d, when she was able to ef
fect a transfer of more of the people.
She rescued 230â a1l that it was possi
ble to be accommodated.
At 8 o'clock the following morning
| another sail was sighted and the colors
i of the Fan Francisco were hoisted un
i ion down. The stranger shortened sail
and proved to be the ship Antarctic,
j bound for Liverpool. She took off 225
personsâ all that remainedâ and the
San Francisco was abandoned to the
fate that she must have met a few
hours afterward.
The news of this disaster was a shock
to the nation, though it is now of al
| most forgotten history. Congress im
mediately directed the President to pro
cure valuable gold medals with suita
ble inscriptions, to be presented to the
i captains of the three vessels that had
j aided the shipwrecked soldiers and pas
j sengrers of the fated San Francisco, as
a testimonial of national gratitude for
their gallant conduct and for a ser-
I vice to humanity that they had per
formed at the risk of their lives and at
a sacrifice of their property.
Congress also immediately appropri
ated JlOO.noo to be distributed as the
President might deem proper to the of
ficers and crews of the vessels.

THE FISH IS TEN FEET IN THE AIRâ TIME OF ASCENT 62 SECONDS.
Sketched from a Snap-Shot Photograph.
BECAUSE only about one out of
every 200 river fish hatched, gets
beyond Its infancy and only
about one ' egg in lr)l r ) hatch,
nature must be helped out or our
supply of fish would soon fail to
meet the demand.
Governor Flower, in an address be
fore an agricultural society in New
York, says that "a trout brook used us
ually only for watering the stock
might be made to yield larger returns
than thirty acres of farm land."
The Germans were the first to experi
ment scientifically in fish raising, and
our Government soon followed. All
over the United States are Government
and private hatcheries for raising fish
to stock the rivers and lakes of the
country.
Ten years ago Mexico asked the
United States Government to send her
a man who would be competent to ex
amine her lakes and rivers and find
out why they were barren of fish. Since
the advent of the Spaniards no fish could
be found and the Mexican savants had
been unable to discover the cause.
Mr. A. V. La Motte was chosen to go
He examined the waters, but they were
all right, and the theory is that earth
quake shocks were responsible for the
death of the fish. The agitation of the
water bottoms destroyed the eggs.
END OF THE MONARCH OF THE POOL.
Mr. La Motte is now nl charge of a
hatchery at Ukiah. He has studied
fish and their habits for forty years.
Last January Mr. La Morte went to
thf upper waters of Eel River ai;<l be
gan his arrangement? for collecting fish
eggs.
A cabin for the trays of eggs and a
fish trap were built. The trap is made
by placing a close picket fence, built
in the shape of a wishbone, having the
two ends about twelve inches short of
Joining and ending in flexible bars over
the opening into the box beyond. The
flsh go through the aperture, but can
not return, and arelifted out of the trap
and transferred to the tanks In tho
cabin.
The eggs are extracted and fertllizpd
in pans. Then they must stand in the
trays for about two weeks until the
black speck, which becomes the eye, ap
pears; they are then ready to be
shipped.
"It was a tedious work, though re
lieved by a great deal of excitement,"
raid Mr. La Motte in describing how
the fish come up. "Milesaway from any
human being, two men and myself
spent four months collecting the eggs.
The scarcity of rain made the creek
very low, so the fish could not come up.
Nature tells them away down in the
ocean that it is time for them to pre
pare for reproducing. When the rains
raise the creeks the fish, which during
most of the year live in salt water,
start on their long voyage to the shal
low, pure water* for spawning. Noth
ing will stop them; they will jump cas
cades and push through strong edddes
in their mad race. No one believes
fish stories, but this photograph speaks
for its own truth. The salmon jumped
the waterfall, which was very swift and
twelve feet high. I have seen trout
do Just as great Jumps, but did not
happen to have the camera with me
at the time.
"The eggs are kept very cold in trays
at the place of taking as the slightest
jar or disturbance of the eggs will kill
them until the eyes have appeared.
"I have sent eggs to New Zealand
which arrived safely and hatched per
fectly. The period of incubation mint
be retarded by keeping the eggs one
degree above freezing. Of course if the
euffu hauh on the road the small fish
will die unlc6Â» properlx cared for."
At the Tkiah hatchery' the eggs in the
trays are placed in troughs through
which water runs after a fall of a few
Inches. This slight fall charges the
water with oxygen for the eggs as well
as the fish.
"It is not true," Mr. La Motte said,
"that trout die after spawning. If they
die it is a sure indication of careless
handling. I always return the fish to
the creeks and after they have rested
they go back down stream. How long
a fish lives we have never been able to
determine, but you have heard of the
carp at Heidelberg which has been a
prisoner for over a hundred years."
After the eyes have set in the eggs
the fish are packed in trays. These
trays arc made by tacking canton flan
nel on frames fitted into a crate and
illy covered with moss.
Exactly like small red currants, half
cooked, with the eye in place of the
blossom, the eggs iie In the wire baskets
for two weeks more. Then with a flirt
of its tall the fish throws off Its shell,
slips through the wire of the basket
â¢â¢Hid swims off down the tanjt with its
yolk sac still attached to its belly to
keep it supplied with food till it is a
little stronger.
Besides the food the egg sac contains
a tiny drop of oil which works up in
the transparent body till it reaches the
glands of its breast. At once the color
and spots appear.
In two weeks more the yolk sack has
been all absorbed and the little fish has
grown its Jaws and can eat the curdled
milk and pulverized liver fed to It three
times a day.
Swimming about in the trough the
little fish are i>erfectly tame, and when
I put my hand Into the water they
flocked to it, trusting, I suppose, that
it was something good to eat.
Another two months and the little
fish, an inch and a half long, are ready
to hunt their own food.
Now it is time to plant them. "With
Ice to keep them cool they are carried
in huge cans like those used for milk to
the very headwaters of some creek.
When they have first been placed in
the stream they will come to the hand
to feed. Two days later the same fish
when approached will scurry away and
hide, so quickly do they harmonize
with their environment. The larger
fish and other enemies of the little ones
do not frequent the very shallow
waters, so the infants have an oppor
tunity to investigate and learn to find
their own food.
On the other side of the stones
where they run to hide are tiny specks,
which are the eggs of the caddies.
You will see the devil's darning
needle hovering over the water. She
drops her eggs, and they attach them
selves to the slimy stones till the time
comes for them to protect themselves
by exuding a sticky gum. They keep
rolling over and over until they are
covered with bits of bark, which pro
tects them from the fish and gives
them their odd chance of living long
enough to grow their wings and get out
of the water and become a devil's
darning-needle or gaddesfly.

THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 12, 1898.
RAISING FISH BY THE MILLION.
Exciting Way They Are Pursued by Eels, Kingfishers and Sportsmen, yet
the Kings Escape to Jump the Falls and Fish Ladders Each Year.
enemies â the lamprey eel. The eel was
very quiet, and, lying on the warm
stones, I had been watching a spider.
Swimming out on the smooth surface
of the water, the spider attacked a
small black Insect which was turning
round and round in the water. This
insect was nearly as large ac the
spider, but after a few seconds of fierce
battle the spider started to back to the
shore, working with all Its strength,
towing its captive to land. About two
feet from the shore, flash, and only a
widening ripple was left of the spider
and bug. Both had become food for
fishes. But they were swiftly revenged
by a long black eel, which came Blowly
among the stones near the shore.
I was almost afraid to breathe. I had
heard tales of the eel, and hoped it
might throw a few stones for my bene
fit as well as Its own. It did. This
eel's head was flat- It had a large
sucker mouth, which it fastened to a
smooth round stone and began to lash
the water with its tail to frighten the
fish out of their hiding places. I heard
a splash and saw a stone, and knew
the eel was feasting on the p<"Â»or little
fish that had been hiding under the
stone.
Snakes and mink, ratÂ» and large fish
feed on the email fish in the water. A
kingfisher will light on a bough over
hanging the water and sit like a leaf
till a fish snaps at a fly or comes near
the surface, when a flash and a bird
scream, and the kingfisher flies away
with its fish.
"We had a large black cat," Mr. La
Motte told me, "who was a persistent
fisher. She would sit on the bank of
the stream, gently tapping the water
with her paw to simulate a fly, and
would wait for hours. A fish would
rise to her fly. With a movement so
quick I could only see a flash she would
dig her claws into the flsh and throw it
a hundred feet or more into the air
behind her. Then she would gently set
tle down again and wait for another
flsh. I never saw her show enough
curiosity about the flsh to so much as
look behind her to see where it had
landed.
"After she had fished as long as she
cared to she would go around and col
lect the fish. She did not stop fishing
when she had all she wanted for food,
but seemed to fish for the sport."
Our "clever statistical chaps" Bay
that 15,000 persons annually leave San
Francisco for the pleasure of fishing.
This means vast quantities of fish
which would soon make a bite a rare
pleasure but for the fish which are
planted every year. Outside of the fish
caught privately for pleasure there
were $9,000,000 worth of fish sold in the
California markets last year.
Trout eggs can be obtained from the
Fish Commission and do not require
more care than chickens In hatching.
In one year's time they are large
enough to eat.
Some years agoa German, A. J.Poppe,
brought carp from Germany, thinking
they would be as fine here as in Ger
many, where they are much esteemed.
They escaped from the lake where he
had confined them and multiplied
rapidly, feeding on the young trout.
The carp deteriorated in our waters; its
flesh became soft and tasteless.
A farmer who had noticed his pigs
wade into the stream an<_ eat the fish
conceived the idea of feeding his hogs
on carp. He caught quantities of the
fish, the hogs devoured them with avid
ity and grew fine and large.
This farmer was very proud of his
pigs and carefully guarded his secret.
When his bacon came on the table he
was prepared for adellclous morsel. But
oh the surprise that awaited him. His
pork was neither flÃh nor pig, but a bad
mixture of both.
At first he resolved not to tell the
Story, tut lie^haa had inj*ny, a laugh
with his neighborsover his "carp-pigs."
The most inveterate enemy of the
carp is the black bass. The bass will
leave any other food when he can find
young carp. He will freely battle to
the death with a carp twice his size.
In the streams the bass will multiply
without the assistance of the hatchery
and requires only to be planted. Un
like the trout, the bass will care for
its own eggs and young fish. The two
mates will rub out a nest, where the
eggs are laid, and will produce the eggs,
stirring them gently with their fins till
the eggs are hatched. Keeping the
young fry in a brood Just as a hen
would, they watch over the young ones
till the egg sac has been absorbed and
the fry must hunt for food. The par
ents then turn on the little ones and
eat those who do not get out of the
way. HELEN GREY.
BIGGEST HSH HATCHERY
IN THE WORLD.
FANCY being in the fish-raising
business and going into your fish
house any bright day and find
ing that your salmon "run" were
laying eggs at the rate of 1.000,
000 an hour. Fish-raising beats poul
try-raising all hollow when it comes to
gathering eggs.
Up in Tphama County they have the
biggest fish hatchery in the world. It's
only one of another line of industries
in which California carries the world's
banner. This particular hatchery is the
Battle Creek hatchery, and on any
good egg day there the men will take
their baskets and buckets and gcr out
and gather you over 2,000,000 salmon
egps while you wait. They have gath
ered as high as 2,220,000 eggs between
sunup and sunset. Of course, this
doesn't include the "bad" eggs which of
course don't count.
The Battle Creek hatchery was start
ed by the State Fish Commissioners to
feed the up Sacramento streams. After
they got the plant well started it devel
oped such magnificent possibilities in
the fish-breeding line that they deemed
it wisest to turn the place over to the
National Fish Commissioners and give
the whole country a chance to reap the
benefits.
The location Is an Ideal one for a fish
hctchery. The waters of the creek nr*
at least four degrees warmer than thosa
of the Sacramento River.
Battle Creek Is the large stream
which divides Shasta and Tchama
counties. It has Its source In the snow
capped peaks of the Lassen Buttes,
and runs rapidly down the canyon to
the Sacramento River, Into which It
empties. It is particularly adapted to
the propagation of salmon, being n, nat
ural spawninj ground for that fish.
A ditch, a quarter of a mile in
length, was constructed to convey wa
ter from Battle Creek to the site
chosen for the hatchery. A frame
building, forty feet wide and ninety
feet long, was erected and fitted with
sixty hatching troughs of a total capa
city of twelve million eggs.. A weir
173 feet in length was constructed
across the creek. It was supported by
five Bulkheads and was designed to
withstand a rise of six feet In the
stream. Later on a building, like the
first, was constructed of wood, but
much larger, being forty feet in width
and 140 feet in length, with 100 hatch
ing troughs and having a total capa
city of 20,000,000 eggs.
The largest catch of salmon eggs
ever recorded In the world was made
at the Battle Creek fishery last sea-
Bon. The season opened October 22 and
closed December 4. During the forty
three days the number of eggs taken
reached the grand total of 48,527,600.
The eggs were distributed to the hatch
eries as follows: Sixteen million to
Sisson, 8,000,000 to* Eel River, 3,000,000
to Baird, 2,000,000 to Olema, 3,000,000 to
Clackamas, Or., and 6,000,000 to the
New England States. The remaining
10,500,000' were hatched at Battle Creek.
Captain G. H. Lambson, superin
tendent of the United States fisheries
in Northern California, with head
quarters at the Baird reservation, di
rects the operation of the Battle Creek
fishery. E. W. Hunt, superintendent
of the Tahoe fishery, is in immediate
charge. He is assisted by W. H. Shel
ley, superintendent of the Sisson
hatchery, these gentlemen being
transferred to the Battle Creek fishery
during; the fishing season. When the
season is at its height forty men are
THE SPAWNING CREW AT WORK.
IN FORTY-THREE DAYS 48.527.500 "EGGS WERE TAKEN AT THE BATTLE CREEK FISH HATCHERY,
employed at the station.
The methods employed n taking the
â¢ eggs are striking. The fish on their
way to their natural spawning grounds
run up the stream as far as the weir.
There they are held from further pro
gress by the racks.
Two seining crews are employed in
catching them One crew works by
day, the other by night. The night
crew pursues its work by the light of
several large headlights. The salmon
taken from the nets are assorted as to
sex. The male fish are placed in a box
by themselves, the "ripe" females,
those ready for spawning, are placed
in a second box. The "green" fish are
returned to the stream. The boxes are
towed to the spawning house and the
fish transferred to the tanks.
The spawning crew begins work. By
means of dip nets the fish are removed
in pairs from the tanks.
The salmon having been stripped of
milt and spawn are tl rown into large
bins, whore they soon die. They are
then given to the public for food. Many
of the poorer class of people in the vi
cinity pack the fish in brine for use
during the winter season.
One day last season 439 ppawn fish
were handled, yielding 2,220,000 eggs. A
record for rapid work was established
upon that day. The crew handled 190
female salmon in one hour and took
over 1,000,000 eggs.
The eggs are removed from the
spawning house to the hatcheries in
buckets, which are hauled in a spring
wagon to the hatchery buildings. They
are placed in small wire baskets, o'o-
long In Bhape and capable of holding
about 35,000 eggs each. The filled bas
kets are suspended in long wooden,
troughs, through which a stream of
water flows very slowly.
Nature is imitated as closely as pos
sible in the care of the eggs. They arÂ»
watched very closely during the pro
cess of hatching. Men go carefully
through the house cv . day and by
means of small tweezers -1 k the dead
eggs out of the baskets. The dead eggs
are easily distinguished by their light
er pink or yellow color.
After a period of one month the eggs
have "eyed"â that is, the eyes of the
fish have formed and can be ?een in the
egg if it is held to the light. The eggs
are now ready for shipment. They are
packed in trays and covered with moss.
The trays are fitted into chests, and
these chests are sent all over the coun
try by express. The eggs from them
are deposited in streams and the hatch
ing continues.
The eggs which are allowed to remain,
In the houses for hatching soon develop
into a very small fish, with a large
sack adhering. This is the remainder
of the egg suspended from the belly.
The small fish derives its nourishment
from this sack till this source of food
supply is entirely absorbed.
The young fish still in the tanks are
then fed upon boiled beef liver and
hard boiled eggs until they have ac
quired sufficient size and strength to
shift for themselves. Then they are
turned loose in the brooks and rivers.
Washington County, New York, pays
a bounty of 50 cents each for dead rat*
tlesnakes, and Warren County, adjoin
ing, pays a dollar. So much money;
has been paid out for the extermina-*
tlon of the reptiles In the latter county
and so little in the former of late that
the authorities have been led to sus
pect double-dealing. It Is believed
that most of the snakes upon which col
lections have been made in Warren
were imported by unscrupulous persona
from the neighboring jurisdiction In or
der that they might secure the higher
rate.
The war with Spain has caused a
scarcity of pineapples, which delicious
fruit comes largely from the Bahama
Islands, and which has hitherto been
brought to our markets principally by
small vessels flying the American flag.
The owners of many of the boats,
fearing the capture of their property
by Spanish ships, have withdrawn them,
from service; and consequently the
supply of pineapples has diminished as
freight rates have Increased.

The nuptials of Miss Lillian Crowell of \
Sacramento and Trvlng Haywood of Chi- j
cago took place in Oakland on Tuesday, i
May 31. The ceremony was performed !
in the elegant parlors of the bride's aunt,
Mrs, Ayres, in that jclty. It was a very
quiet wedding, only relatives being pres- i
ent. Miss Crowell is a native of Sacra- I
mento, a popuiar teacher in our public
schools, and had list been granted a life
diploma by the State Board of Education.
Mr. Haywood is a prominent business

And the next had given himself up,
too. He was "in liquor," he explained,
when he deserted.
"I wouldn't ha' â¢ done it if I'd been
sober," he said, blushing like a big girl;
"any man's liable to be a fool when he's
drunk."
"Where was this?"
"Mexico." â  â¢
"And where did you give yourself
up?" - .' >:
"Washington."
"When?" -
"When I heard there was going to be
war."
A boy of seventeen, the youngest
soldier of the company he deserted; the
youngest convict in Alcatraz Prison,
forgot his miserable . shyness in the
spirit of '98. He , stood on one foot,
hunching one , shoulder, twisting his
fingers into his palms, pink to his hair.
"You're a young soldier!"
"Yes'm." ~<
"And a young prisoner."
"Yes'm."

Silence; blushes; wriggles

"Yes'm."
"Then, if you'd known there was go

I asked â "How try : again 't%
"Volunteers. ;It ain't the regular â "
He choked here â "It ain't the regular,"

taken for fraudulent enlistment What
ever their reasons for running away i
from the army, whatever the reasons j
of their superiors for turning them out !
of it, they all had tried to get back, j
Some had tried one way and some an- j
other, but fair ways were closed to
them all. They traveled far from the!
scene of desertion or dishonorable dis- |
charge; they changed the beards upon !
their faces, the marks upon their bodies,
of which the Government .keeps its
merciless little maps; they look new
names, they took new hearts, they took
new risks t they took new sins upon |
them. And the old one followed and
found them oQt and brought them back j
to pay the penalty for the double crime !
of deserting their country and trying j
afterward to serve her.
Perhaps by that moral law which
known no civil nor military restriction i
they have some rights upon their side '
What better reparation can a man of- i
fer his country deserted in her ease j
than to ask to serve her in her need?
But where would military discipline
be if the moral law should take to in
terfering with it?
These are the men who failed, the
men who lost their chance, the men i
who buried their future in their past, '
the men their comrades left behind i
them.
The reveille that wakes the soldier in !
his tent to glory on the field, calls them !
across prison walls to come and sweep I
the paths of peace. The roll call they '
must daily answer is the list dishonored j
in the service. Before their prison cell I
they pass inglorious review. Their j
Assembly sounds "Inside" to the clang j
of prison doors. Their taps is "All se- i
cure" passed along the prison watch
In the forced peace of military prisons
they lay them down to sleep while their
comrades fljht the cause th-t is their
common cause, under the flag that is
their common flag, for the honor of the
country that is their common country
against the foe that is their common
foe.

Del J*lonte.Modern Dianas and Their Summer Outfits.
HUNTING AND SWIMMING TOGS
FOR THE SUMMER GIRL.
SHE Is not the traditional "sum- '
mer girl." Her quarry does not i
belong to the human species,
though she both fishes and
hunts. Nimrod and Izaak Wal
ton are her chosen saints, and
mere man Is of no importance j
to her In the pastime of pursuit.
Diana may select her costume from two
or three materials â tweed, corduroy or
canvasâ but for a regular field garb the
outfitter -will advise her to have It all of
;roy. He will suggest that she may,
;f she prefers, have a combinationâ a
â 1 or corduroy skirt, with a canvas
shooting jacket, "made just like a
man's"; but his own particular prefer
ence is for corduroy In a pretty brownish
color made with a Norfolk jacket. I'n
:ther coat or jacket must be worn
a sweater of some dark tint. Let nut
Diana be tempted by bright colors.
The wise hunter always selects a tint
for his costume that will be as nearly
â¢he brown of the woods and earth
as possible. The reason is obvious. Thus
U he is less likely to attract or hold
the attention of four-footed rangers of
the forest, and may, to all intents and
purposes, become a part of the landscape
at a moment's notice when warned that
game is near.
It is advisable for Diana to have sweat
ers of two weightsâ medium and heavyâ
for all sorts and conditions of weather,
for ....e location of the hunting grounds
a:;il the season of the year. She is per
mitted to have a bright-colored sweater
or a fancy .shirt waist or two (to wear
â Â\i or wh- a she Is simply posing as,
but is not really, a sportswoman and
wants to look fetching;
The skirt of a field costume, be It tweed
or corduroy, extends far enough below
the knee to meet the tons of her high
outing boots -which wtil have special
mention a little later onâ and is just wide
enougl ctlj free motion in walk-
Ing or climbing, what little fullness there
is being at the center of the back. The
prise feature of this skirt is its pocketsâ
â  p patch* pockets, two of them â
directly on the front, and each closing
at the top with a buttonhole and button.
Fully realising the long suft'ering re
sulting from the pocketless costumes of
â women, this outfitter adds a pocket
when m. and the sportswoman
( f to-day can hunt through quite a
pocket preserve in very manly style be
fore she nnpockets a missing article She
knows !b <?*in one of "em somewhere."
Everybody knows of the pockets galore
on the regular leather-trimmed canvas
shooting jacket Diana is now permitted
c finds, It she chooses the
Norfolk Jacket in its place, that she still
lias pockets, many more than she, in her
new estate, knows what to do with.
Under the short skirt she wears bloom

renient than a "two piece Bult" at un

ihe chooses to do so, but she will
enjoy her lield costume far more if she

more than a deep girdle. Or she may
wear a boned or corded underwriter This i
is a point, however, to be settled by Di
ana herself.
Now for the extremes, "hat and boots."
Said the outfitter: "The regulation head
covering is a deer stalking hat, or fore
and aft cap, of the same material as the
Bklrt. but I Pi i lad
In the way of hats, and some, I must con- ,
fess, are rather uou 1..1. â .:>â -. Bud, . .!â â 
hat doesn't make much difference, and
they wear soft felts, rakishly turned up !
at the back and pitched over the eyes at
the front, or the reverse, or turned up
or down all round. In fact, they seem to
prefer, just as some men do, even with
the Mwellest of costumes, any old feit
hat they can find rather than the actu- 1
ally up-to-date sportsman's hat."
Th^re are outing shoes and "field boots"
for Diana, and she should have a pair of
the former for hunting ovei
c â â¢â  â ; Inp from the bank. Such
shoes are really high bicycle boots made
::iii.i,m-i and perhaps a little higner than .
the regulation wheeling boot, with rub
ber disks on the soles. The field boots !
cro exact counterparts of those for men,
except that they are a little lighter In
weight. They are sixteen inches high, |
have low heels, thick, heavy Scotch welt j
soles, bellows tongues, are made of un- ;
dressed calf, and absolutely waterproof. !
The bellows tongue prevents any water
from entering the boot at that point,
and at the same time permtts the boot
to Blip on easily by spreading out under
the pressure. Once on the tontlue is
laced into place in the ordinary manner.
Such boots will allow the wearer to wade
shallow streams dry-footed.
"Twenty-five dollars a pair!" I ex- ;
claimed as the salesman told me the !
price.
"Why," said he. "that is not much
when you consider that they are made to :
. T'l'-r and will last with occasional new
half soles, for twenty years, yes, even
for a lifetime."
The point was plain, and after all li
didn't seem, as a moment before, us if ;
IMana must be a millionairess in order to â 
be a huntress. There are times and
streams when even the twenty-flve-dollar
;, ild 1 ts are not high enough. Then
the really ardent fisher maiden poaches
on still more masculine preserves and 1
takes to wading boots and stockings of
rubber.
For the benefit of embryo Dianas I will
say that these two integuments are
drawn and fastened around the waist In
bloomer style, and with her skirt raised
securely a woman may wade a trout 1
stream as fearlessly as a man, and come '
forth as dry as when she stepped in. ,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 12, 1898.
waterproofed cloth, low wading shoes
with rubber disks on the soles are worn. I
These are less clumsy fur women than
wading boots, which are of rubber with '
the wading stockings attached to them.
Apropos of the mutter of securely rais- â 
Ing the skirts for wading, the outfitter
fiÂ«t mentioned does not believe In an
Intricate or complicated arrangement of I
buttons, rings and strings; and the hint '
he gave to his swell customers might be !
of use to women who do not flsh or hunt,
but who are compelled to sometimes raise
their skirtsâ unless they are Rainy
Daisies. His plan is very simpleâ lust a !
broad heavy band of rubber slipped over
the head and allowed to rest about the
waist until needed; It is then pushed '
down about the hips, the skirt pulled up i
through it as high as desired, and there
you are. A quick pull of the band up
toward the waist, when on dry territory
again, and the skirt falls Instantly into j
place.
The mail of rods and guns laughed when
I asked him if rods were made specially \
for the use of sportswomen. "Why cer
talnly. but of course the only difference
is in the outward appearances. We simply ;
ornament them in some way, just out or
compliment to the fair sex, you know.
But she really fishes with the same rod as >
we sell her brothersâ a five-ounce steel
rod being about the proper thing for her !
to use, or, if she chooses, a corresponding- I
ly light bamboo rod. I have seen rods I
made of gold and silver and others orna- I
mented with silver fret work and etching i
for presentation to ladies. Just think of j
itâ fishing with rods of silver and gold! !
We have all heard of that kind of bait,
but whoever dreamed of such royal ap
pliances for landing even a patrician trout '
or perchance a plebeian chub.
"Concerning guns," continued the rod
and gun man, "the number of women In
terested in shooting has had a marked
( â¢!':'. >'t on the output. Rifles and revolvers.
While of the orthodox pattern for men,
are, for women's use, quit* decorative in j
many examplesâ a deferential tribute to
Diana's ineradicable desire for attractive!
externalities.
"In the assortment of breech-loading
Shotguns are many beautiful weapons for
women's exclusive use. Many such were
seen at the recent sportsmen's exposition.
But though beautified with inlaid work,
gold and silver ornamentation and artistic
engraving, these weapons are not toys
They shoot to kill and do so as well aa
the best of the guns made for the men.
t rom five to six pounds would be the best
t for l)i;tna's use, and a hammer
l( 88, ejector gnu from sixteen to twenty
gauge, with the proper load of smokeless
POWd< r. will cover her with glory if she
is a good shot."
On the paraphernalia of execution how
ever, the costume outfitter does not dic
tate. He attires her suitably, makes her
f"racUve to the eye and leaves to her
the ' rhntoo ,f her game and the means
of bringing it to her feet.
The Up-to-Date
Swimming Girl.
THE up-to-date summer girl Is taught
to swim scientifically, no matter if
she does choose to pose us a gentle
creature half afraid of the water.
Down deep In her heart she's not a bit
afraid, and ten to one she would dash
boldly to the rescue of an imperiled
swimmer with a coolness and skill that
would do credit to a member of the life
saving corps, for the rescue act Is an Im
portant feature of her natatory curricu
lum.
To really become a mistress of the art
of swimming a girl must take a series
of lessons at a private institution where
she is made to understand the full sig
nificance of the details of every move
ment and position. This done, the result
is a splendid self-confidence ana a cool
head under every circumstance.
The methods employed at the late la
mented natatorium on upper Fifth ave
nue, New York, were novel, and, as one
fair pupil expressed it, "perfectly jolly."
Beginners were first given instructions
In movements on laud; that is, they were
made to stand up with heels placed close
together and then taught to use their
arms. Lan-r they were shown the mo
tion of using one kg and arm together.
After sufficient skill had been acquired
in these matters they were taken to the
tank und a belt placed around the waist,
into which was snapped the hook from a
suspended trolley. This was constructed
of two pulleys, which ran on an auto
matic track above the tankâ that is, it
would run when correct motions were
made by the fair novice, but if the arms
and nether limbs failed to work in har
mony not an inch would the trolley budge.
On occasions such as tnese the in
structor would stand upon the edgp nf
the tank indulging In the most convinc
ing form of gymnastics and bellow forth;
"Move the arms out so, as I told you!
Don't try to stand on your foot!" and
tho like, until, when apparently nearly
ready to pitch himself overboard and
end "it all forever, the cable would yield
a bit to the beseeching- efforts of the
pplashing nymph ami plowly, spasmodic
ally move on toward the opposite side of
the tank.
This degree in the Initiation Is kept up
for a series of turns until the pupil feels
that she is no longer afraid of the water.
It gives one courage, you see, and is a
very safe introduction to briny depths;
Next she is put into a belt fashioned of
cork, cut into flat four-inch squares. Into
the water she plunges and proceeds to
learn how to balance herself and inci
dentally to swim without the staying hand
of the trolley. As she gains in self-con
fidence the squares of cork are removed
one by one from the belt about her waist,
until by and by she finds she has mas
tered the natatory art, and that quite
scientifically, too.
When a girl has learned to swim well
the feat of diving is next in line. This
usually Is from the spectators' gallery,
twenty-five feet above the water. The in
structor first takes the correct position
and dives over and then the pupil does
likewise.
When it comes to the rescue part of
the course excitement runs high. Some
thing of goodly proportions which will
slowly sink is thrown into the water and
the swimmer makes for it at a lively
pace. The art lies in knowing just how to
support a dead weight and swim tellingly
at the same time. It is easy to see that
the pupil who completes the course of in
struction as here illustrated is admirably
equipped for old ocean's billows, though
I have neglected to speak of the electric
wheel so placed In the side of the tank
as to perfectly irritate surf motion.
As exercise for developing the lung pow
er and giving strength to chest and shoul
der muscles tho motions employed in
swimming are the finest. I am told by
an expert that ocean bathing is good for
every man, woman and child over 8 years
of ageâ but that It is also not Rood for
any of them unless indulged in intelligent
ly.
There should be no dallying on the sand
either before the plunge or following it.
nor should a moment be spent in the
water when not in active motion. Robust
persons may remain submerged for twen
ty-five minutes at the longest, while deli
cate ones should not extend the time over
eight minutes.
As a guarantee against taking cold a
shower bath should be arranged in the
bathhouse and turned on sufficient to
drench the skin, both before taking the
plunge and on the return from the surf.
A good rule for both weak and strong
to follow is always to come ovjt of the
water before the delightful feeliiig of ex
hilaration has passed off. for otherwise
there is sure to result a languor and de
bility which sometimes lasts for a day or
two.
Salt water If not good for the hair, In
spite of tho fact that physicians often
order salt shnmvoos for the sealti.
The wise bather will not allow her
tresses to become drenched more than a
couple of times during tho season and
then a good fresh water rinse should fol
low. :-:â !-: .r^-
Working Girl's
Wardrobe,
AN exceedingly pretty and comfort
able gown for summer wear,
k *\ which is both very light and almost
dust proof can be made from serge.
Choose a very firmly woven piece. It is a
certain satisfaction to know your
gown will not fade, which you can be
quite certain of by washing a sample
before buying. The sample should
be well ironed as well as washed, for
it often happens that the iron will
fade the material quite as much as
the washing.
Make the skirt without lining. If
you choose the ruffle bottom pattern
for making the skirt, the ruffle can
be lined with silk and should be
stayed with a narrow band of stif
fening around the hem. Head the
ruffle with velvet the same shade as
the dress.
StriKiog Out Bravely.
Make the jacket to be worn over a
skirt waist wKu a removable velvet col
lar. This can be done by finishing the
neck and front down to the waist line
with a cord. The collar is made with an
Inner cape exactly like the collars worn
by little boys with the sailor suits'.
Make one collar in velvet like the dress
and one in white velvet. Edge the white
one with a narrow quilling at ribbon.
The present fad of wearing military
buttons is easily gratified, as the buttons
can be bought at any store, and are made
up Into cuff buttons, pins, hat pins, buck
les and stick pins, and are both patriotic
and becoming.
Neckties of every description are found
to slip up and get out of place if not prop
erly fastened. To obviate this difficulty
pull the tie Into place and stick a large
headed stick pin through the collar just
above the tie in such a manner that the
head of the pin will hold the collar in
place.
A novel way of utilizing a half worn pair
of bicycle shoes might be interesting to
any one who has a pair of the long cloth
ones with cloth bottoms. Get a pair of
comfortable low shoes In tan or black.
Cut the cloth bottoms off your bicycle
shoes and replace them with the low
shoes. It can be easily done, as the shoe
lining Is soft and can be readily sewn
with stout linen thread to the leggln bot
toms.
A sailor's riding hat Is more comfort
able than any other kind if It can be In
duced to stay In its place. The hair should
be braided closely and put up so the top
of the braid comes just to the hat. An
elastic sewed to the hat will keep It firm
ly with the help of a pin. Do not make
the elastic tight or it will cause head
ache.
To prevent sunburn you must take care
of your face before going out into the sun
rather than after. Wash the face and
neck In warm water to which has been
added a little borax. When dry rub well
into it a lotion made of one half glycerine
and one half witch hazel, four or five
drops of carbolic acid and half a tea
spoonful of borax to a five-ounce bottle of
the lotion.
After the lotion has been -well rubbed
in dust the face with talcum powder to
prevent the dust from sticking.
If you rub this lotion Into the face and
hand's at night it will keep them smooth
in spite of constant out-of-door life.
Mow to Sleep
Correctly.
mY doctor Bays that it isn't what
â¢we do during the day but we
way we sleep at nipht that makes
ub round-shouldered," I heard a
tall, stunning-looking girl say to her com
panion ac they rested after the dumb
bell drill at the gymnasium.
"You know how dreadfully I stooped
when I left school a year ago," she wen
on. "I just thought I would go craz:
with the home folks always saying
'Maud, dear, sit up straight!' and Jacl
said I looked about as frisky as Grandm;
Burke, who is nearly a hundred. I trle<
physical culture and rode horseback am
played tennisâ did everything, in fact
that I was told would straighten mj
shoulders, even to wearing three differen
patent braces, but I could not see th(
least improvement."
"Did the braces do any good?" I hearc
her c mpanion ask. "I am just trying i
pair myself."
She was a slender little thing and noi
as fresh looking as the tall girl.
"No, they didn't," replied the other
"and what's more, they hurt me dread
fully. I had the backache all the time ]
wore them, and they pinched my arms
too. But I want to tell you what mj
doctor said. I went to him one day and I
just sat down in his great big chair anc
cried like a baby. I looked a fright anc
I knew it, but I felt sure that they woult
put me into a plaster cast or something
equally as awful. He didn't, though, bui
just asked the queerest lot of questions
about how I slept."
"How you slept?" exclaimed the slendei
girl, showing a great deal of interest.
"Yes, he wanted to know if I slept on t
downy bed and with a big pillow undei
my head. Of course I did and when ]
told him so he nodded his head and sale
he knew It.
"Then he went on to say that I woulc
lie with my arms up over my head 01
else, when on my side, they would be ir
front of me, with the shoulders throwr
forward, that I often w*'Uld curve my
self up in a little "roll and go to sleep,
These were the common mistakes, hÂ«
said, which most persons made in sleep-
Ing."
"Well, how on earth are we to sleep
and on what sort of beds?" her com
panion asked, with very wide-open eyes
"On a hard bed, the narrower tht
better. He said to lie on my left side
md put my arm behind me. which natur
ally would throw the shoulders back. 1
Sid it, and just see how straight I am!"
she added, standing up and showing her
superb neck and shoulders.
"It wasn't so very hard, either," she
?ontinued. "but I was determined tc
naster the art of sleeping correctly, and
F have. You know Jessie Banks, don't
t'ou? Well, the secret of her fine figure
s that she has for years slept without a
pillow and on a hard mattress scarcely
:hree feet wide. She used to stoop over
frightfully, and her muscles were so
Sabby; but the hard bed makes them
solid, and lying with the head on the
;ame plane with the body keeps the chest
svi-11 thrown out and the shoulders
straight. She looks lovely now in oven
ng dress. There is so much expression in
i pretty bnck and .well-carried chest."
This was all I heard of their interesting
â¢hat. but it gave me so great a curiosity
:o learn more about the theory that I
na.de straight for the office of a physician
vhose opinion comes very near being the
aw in this country to-day.
"It is quite true," he said, "half the
world is in total ignorance of the laws
governing healthful sleep. People lie on
)eds that are soft and pile so many cov
â rs over them that the body gains no yen-
tilation whatever. High pillows throw the
head forward and interfere with healthful
breathing, while all sorts of positions are
taken with regard only to getting easy.
"A luml bed makes the flesh firm. I
have "known patients to apparently reduce
I th>ir weight twenty or thirty pounds after
I sleeping so for several months, but on be
; ing wt-ighed they would find that no flesh
had been lost; it had simply hardened
and lost its fiabbiness.
"Sleeping on the back !s not healthful.
! It results in a gravitation of blood to the
1 spinal cord and the lower part of the
i brain. Persons who dream much and
I have the nightmare usually sleep tnis
way, and, besides. It throws the palate
! back In such a position aa to cause mouth
breathing and its accompanying snore. A
deal of throat trouble Is caused by this,
as the air reaches the lungs without being
purified and moistened by passing through
the nose.
"Lying on the le.t side, with the arm
thrown behind, is the best position both
for giving a fine figure and in promoting
health. All animals sleep upon the chest
as nearly as possible, with the back up,
and they know pretty well what is the
fight thing to do. It will be found that
In taking tho position I have just advised
the throwing of th? arm bohind one brings
the body nearly over the che^t.
"As for sleeping on high pillows," the
doctor continued, "It is the easiest thing
in the world to grow dependent upon
them, as they favor cerebral anaemia,
which Induces sleep, but if one wishes to
have a finely expanded chest she must
dispense with even the smallest pillow.
"A soft bed Is enervating; it embraces
the body and makes Its tissues flabby,
which, together with heavy covering, in
terferes with the circulation and prevents
the body from tnrowing off impurities.
One should have the air temperate and
the room so ventilated as to dispense
with any but light covering.
"It is not generally known, but to
sleep on the back makes one very liable
to take cold, which Is easily understood,
as the chest and throat are exposed, and
I have found tho majority of persons with
weak lungs and sensitive throats to be
addicted to this position in sleeping.
"Well doctor," I questioned, "does trve
sleeping on hard beds without a pillow
tend to give women line figures?"
"I have never considered it trom the
nolnt of beauty," he answered, with great
dignity, "but it must certainly do so, as
it is the healthful way, and that always
means the most beautiful. I have noticed
that tho women of hot climates have nne
figures and I do not doubt that the
sh-eoing on hard beds for coolness sake
has much to do with it. I had a patient
not long ago who was greatly worried

.HINTS FOR THE CJIRE OF THE JMIR
"Fair tresses man's Imperial race ensnare,
And beauty draws us with a single hair."
St. Paul wrote: "If a woman have long
hair, It is a glory to her." Since when
there has been much rhythmic talk about
hair being a woman's crown of glory. Nor
Is It empty talk, for pretty silken tresses,
j well cared for and with a natural wave,
! can excite more real envy in the feminine
j heart than diamond rings or brass but
tons. And there is nothing about a
woman's toilet that gives her that neat
and well-groomed appearance that we all
so covet as well-kept, neatly arranged
locks.
After all, it requires but a little care to
make the scanty locks grow thick and
glossy. It is not the hard brushing once
I in a while and the occasional shampoo
that will keep the hair in good order, but
it is the continuous care and attention.
The scalp, like the rest of the body, must
De kept scrupulously clean.
It should be thoroughly shampooed once
a month, unless very oily, In which case
twice a month is not too often. Use pure
Castile soap and make a good stiff lather.
Don't rub the soap on the hair, for this
makes it sticky and hard to rinse out.
Don't use ammonia on the hair. -
If the water is not soft, a pinch of borax
will soften it.
Rinse thoroughly in hot water several
times, and let the last rinsing be in cold
water. This causes a reaction and stim
ulates the. scalp.
Dry in the sunlight if possible.
Fer some heads afflicted with dandruff
soap is not good. In such cases use the
shampoo:
Yelk cf one egg.
One pint of rain water.
One ounce of rosemary spirit.
Beat until the ingredients are thorough
ly mixed and use it warm, rubbing It well
into the scalp. This is splendid, not only
as a cure for dandruff, but is also cleansx
ing and makes the hair soft and smooth.
For hair that is too oily use the follow-
ing:
Oleum ruscl, oz. ss., equal 15.
Ungt. aquae rosae ad. oz. iv, equal 100.
01. rosae gt. x to tex, equal 1.
Apply to the scalp at night and rub
away with a piece of soft linen In the
morning. Continue until difficulty is re

Keep cheerful and happy and look to the
health if you would have beautiful ana

as anxiety and worry, cause the hair to

There is an old superstition that the moon
influences the growth of the hairâ that, if
cut when the moon is young, it grows

but the hair increases in thickness.

Novel ways in which the American girl students in Paris employ their
social hours and Sundays.
WHEN the American girl goes
to Paris to study art, music
or what-not her fond relatives
en this side of the pond bid
her farewell with many
doubts and misgivings.
All of which, says the returning
American Girl, belongs more properly
to the realism of fiction and the glare
of the footlights than to the usual
routine life of the student in Paris.
What of the hours from S until 12
working in an atelier, a few moments
for luncheon and again until 5 copying
in the galleries or attending an after
noon atelier?
This solicitude for the welfare of our
students in Paris has occasioned some
delightful institutions where the Ameri
cans, be they from the North, Bast,
South or West, meet and in rubbing
elbows forget their tinge of "helm
weh."
The two most popular of these "home
links" are the "American Girls' Home"
and "Hymns and Lemonade."
The American Girls' Home was
founded some years ago by a number
of wealthy New Yorkers. Mrs. White
law Reid takes an active interest in the
"Home" and is one of its most ardent
supporters.
The "Home" is situated In a part of
the quartier most accessible to the
studios. There are about seventy-five
large, comfortably furnished rooms,
which are rented only to the American
students. Meals are served in the
"Home," but one can room in the
"Home" and board elsewhere if it is
found more desirable. The charges are
very moderate. The inmates of the
"Home" are absolutely free and inde
pendent as to their comings and goings.
After trying "pensions" and "house
keeping apartments" most of the stu
dents flnall3 r move to the American
Girls' Home and to a haven of rest.
Four large rooms on the lower floor
of the "Home" are open to all Ameri
can students and their friends. There
are three large reception rooms and a
library where the American papers, and
magazines are kept on file. The girls
drop in here at all hours to chat, read,
to keep appointments. A great many
of the girls who live in apartments not
convenient for receiving people enter
tain all their visitors at the parlors of
the "Home."
Every day at 5 o'clock tea and crack
ers are served in the "salon" of the

growth and nourish the roots of the hair:
Castor oil, one part; oil of sweet almonds,
one part; tannin, one part. Never use a
fine comb. Never use curling irons.
Here is a recipe for a curling fluid: Gum
Tragacanth, lVfe drachms; proof spirit, 3
ounces;. water, 7 ounces, attar of rose, 10
drops.
Give the hair a thorough brushing
every night. This removes dandruff, frees
the hair from dust and dirt collected dur
ing the day, promotes circulation and
keeps the hair soft and glossy.
A word here about hairbrushes.
Don't buy a black brush, for ft is im
possible to tell when it is dirty, and un
less the brush is perfectly clean it will not
cleanse the head.
The best brush for a woman * should
have bristles not more than half an inch
deep, unbleached and stiff enough to
scratch but not Irritate the scalp. After
very few strokes the loose hairs should
be combed from the brush and the loose
scurf and dust removed by rubbing and
beating it on a towel.
The brush should be washed as often as
It needs it. The best way to do this is to
wash it in hot soap and water, to which
a little soda or ammonia has been added,
after which it should be rinsed in clear
water, rubbed on a towel, and put in an
open window, but not in the sunlight, to
dry.
A final rinsing in a little weak alum
water will increase the stiffness of the
bristles.
Combs should never be washed, but
cleaned with a stout thread twisted about
the fingers and run in and out between
the teeth.
There is nothing better for the hair
than a sun bath. Loosen the hair as often
as possible and sit in the sunlight.
But it takes more even than a fine com
plexion and beautiful hair to make a
woman beautiful. She must look to her
hands and nails, that they be soft and
white and polished, her teeth must be
looked after, the body properly exer
ciseu. and she must carry herself grace
fully and walk with her shoulders drawn
back and head well poised, chest out and
chin in, at the same time easily and with
out effort.
Above all no matter how badly tho
world may be treating you, keep the ex
pression of the face cheerful and animat
ed. As the photographer says, "look
pleasant." Really, this is more than half
the battle.
And now. If there are any of you that
would like to ask any questions concern
ing cosmetics or hygiene, I shall be only
too happy to answer them. If there are
any red noses that the owners would liku
to make short work of, any unsightly
spots or other facial blemishes, write to
me and I will tell you what to do for
them. Ask as many questions as you like,
sign any name that you choose, and di
rect your letters to Mme. Ilygeia, The
Call, San Francisco.
I will give you only such recipes as I
have either personally tested or know In
some way to be harmless.
I "Home." Almost all the American Btu-
I dents in Paris are to be found there at
i that hourâ the artists, musicians, stu-
I dents at the universities and acade
i mies. They all find it a pleasant way
jof meeting each other, and it saves
I making calls, a formality which finds
very little place in their busy lives.
The conversation is always animated
' and informal. The chances of "being
i hung," or in other words, having a pic
! ture accepted at the "salon," is a never
i failing theme for discussion. Discuss
i music, art, the latest play, indulge in
| a little small talk, wash it down with
i good tea and crackers and then "au
! revoir" till the next day at the same
| hour. No fee whatsoever is charged
' even to those not living in the "Home"
for the use of the reception rooms at all
hours and for the 5 o'clock teas. It has
proved a most delightful way of bring
ing the students of the different arts
together, and the managers gladly
meet any deficits that may occur in the
accounts. "Hymns and Lemonade" is a
newer innovation than the American
Girls' â¢ Home, and when it was first
broached to the students it was viewed
with distrust. They scented that the
promoters of the idea were trying: to
reform them, and they were unani
mous in the opinion that they liked
themselves as they were.
But the originators of the idea â some
â wealthy New Yorkers â went right
ahead, undismayed by any lac> of en
thusiasm on the part of those they
hoped to benefit by the plan. A stu
dio capable of holding about fifty peo
ple was rented, and it was announced
that non-sectarian services would be
conducted there every Sunday evening
for the benefit of the American stu
dents.
There were very few present the first
I evening. But the excellence and brev
{ ity of the informal sermon, the singing
j of the vocal students who had volun
teered their services, the absence of
passing around the plate, and the de
licious lemonade and cake served at
the close of the services, all combined
to make a good impression on the few
students present.
One of those happened to be a wag.
fortunately for the permanence of the
institution, and in a felicitous moment
he dubbed the services "Hymns and
Lemonade," under which happy sobri
quet it was bound to thrive. For it is
far easier and more alluring to pro
pose to take a fellow student to
"Hymns and Lemonade" than to
church.

THE BOOKSHELVES.
OF the childhood and youth of Al
phnns*Â» Daudet all the world has
rend in his "Le Petit Chose," that
exquisitely pathetic account of the
inner life of a child destined to be
great; and of his suffering as an
ueher in a school in the provinces
when he was only 16. But it is In "Trente
Ans de Paris" that the real Daudet Is
disclosed. The humorous, pathetic, tri
umphant story of his arrival In Paris,
poor, timid, awkward, short-sighted and
too vain to wear glasses, and his gtadilal
conquest of literary Paris, with his own
history and his opinion of his books is
so charmingly Interwoven that a fuller,
more artistic, happier autobiography
could not be wished for.
The Daudet of late yearsâ the French
Dickens, who had all the art Dickens
lacked, a more delicate perception and
delineation of character, and in Tartar
in, at least, a humorous creation that
outshines Pickwick â Leon Daudet tells
about In the "Revue de Paris." To his
son the grtat novelist is a hero and a
saint.
"He of whom T write," he says, "was
not merely an exemplary father and hus
band. He was my teacher, my counselor,
my best friend. My heart overfiowsâ l

â  Daudet was stricken sud

he remained a victim man;.- years. He
endured this terrible affliction with the
.if of a martyr, never permitting
if to become embittered or his In
tellectual activity to be impeded by his
physical infirmities. "But for my mal
ady," his sun quotes from the dying
man's notebook, "I might have been
'mi rely an author.' a prey to the little
nesses <>i the trade, trembling at an ad
verse criticism, excited by praise, duped
by vain satisfaction. Certainly I have
weaknesses enough* Nevertheless I have
been purified."
His death was altogether sudden and
unexpected. The weok before he had at
! an authors' dinner and was the
life o; the party, as Zola has described it.
In their own family. I.eon Daudet writes,

side, and could have Â«aid with the (Treat
philosopher, "Read Montaigne. All wis
dom lies in Montaigne." But the book
that he studied most was the book of
life. He believed that practical expe
rience was the necessary preliminary to
good work and that emotion is the real
source of all that is great in art. His
sensibility was keen; he had a rare ca
pacity for deep feeling and held that what
we tell in song is first learned Id suffer
ing â sympathetic or personal. Napoleon
was one of his heroes.
In speaking of this tumultuous and
restless nlneteer.tn century, he main
tained that it was dominated by two
types, that of Bonaparte and that of
Hamlet; the latter, prince not only of
Denmark but of the Interior life; the for
mer, source of high deeds and daring en
terprises.
Among his contemporaries there were
two whom he regarded as representatives
of their opposite ideals, Stanley, the man
of action, and George Meredith, the
thoughtful and laborious recluse. He de
lighted in Stanley's books, and read them
incessantly. Moreover, when the daring
traveler was attacked, he defended him
with conviction, maintaining that, *â¢ far
from being cruel, he was the most just
and merciful, as well as the most tena
cious of conquerors. His son thus de
scribes their meeting during Alphonse
Daudefs visit to England:
"At last, at the nouse of a mutual
friend in London, he encountered the ob
ject of his admiration. And what a spec
tacle it was to watch these two distin
guished men, who understood each other
so well, in affectionate discourse. It is
impossible that a being for whom my fa
ther felt such a sincere friendship could
have been wicked. He considered him
one of the finest types of the Anglo-Saxon
race, cosmopolitan in his lucidity of mind,
courage, straightforward integrity, and
Found judgment.
Alphonse Daudet could never reconcile
himself to the defeat suffered by France
in the war of IS7O, in which he took part,
and whose terrible history Zola has given
in "Le Debacle." Daudet could not be in
duced to write of it.
"Such a recital would not have inspired
and elevated our people," the novelist an
swered. "A warlike country like ours
needs to hear not me dirges of defeat but
the clarion chant of victory."
"Great successes surprised my father."
Daudet fits writes, "but did not intoxicate
him. 1 have never known any one so in
different to money. Modest in his daily
life, an enemy to luxury and display, sim
ple In his dress, his hounenold arid hla
whole conduct, he considered wealth n
dangerous snare; it was in his eyes an In
fected source that poisoned those wlio
drank of it, the principal cause of the dis
sensions and hatreds of families and soci
eties."
The great author's delight In music, and
the fortunate circumstance that it helped
instead of hindering him at his work,
made Madame Daudet'a ability as a pian
ist another bond between these two, who
were such good companions.
Leon quotes his father as saying:
"Without my wife I should have aban- '
doned mysrlf to my dangerous facility.
It was not until late that I was torment- i
ed by the love of perfection." And again: I
"At present the disproportion between â¢
what my pen transcribes and my spirit
baa received Is bitter to me. I yearn to I
express the inexpressible."
Daudefs life was one of great simplicity i
hibltion in Oakland of the drill work of
the drill team of Ivy Lodge. There was
a large attendance and the work of the
ladles, in the beautiful costumes, was
exceedingly well performed.

heroine. .It 1b then that the generous In
stincts of the sex are further revealed.
She who is called upon to play Fate and
deal out imaginary fame and fortune and
beauty and virtue does it with no miserly
hand. Prom the abundance which she
hathâ the more she gives the more she
has, for. truly, imaginative weaJth is infi
niteâshe bestows with a motherly liber
ality upon her mind's children. Nothing
is too good; nothing is too great for them.
Forâ they are hers.
When Jessie Fothergill wrote the little
story of sentiment and song that Mans
field is now playing in New Yorkâ which
succeeds despite the dramatic critics, just
as the book did in the teeth" of book re
viewsâher devotion to her mental off
spring compelled her to make Eugene a
count. Or was it a shrewd knowledge of
what her sex. the foreordained readers of
the book, would require of her? In the
same spirit M. E. Francis marries off Her
two charming little Hungarian heroines,
one to the greatest pianist in the world,
and the other to an English baronet, who
is "colossally rich, young, not yet 32,
handsome, healthy, and, moreover, hon
estly interested in life and in his fellow
creatures."
But the "Duenna of a Genius" has what
memory denies to "The First Violin"â a
very good drawing of character in the
persons of these two beautiful, talented,
adorable Hungarian heroines: one or two
excellent situations, such as that where
the genius pouts and pretends to be un
able to speak English, and another which
describes their unsuccessful concert; a
sense of humor; a certain degree of ar
tistic taste in the arrangement of the
story; and one chapter, that in which the
genius plays an early morning violin
serenade in the woods, to the great
pianist whom she loves, which is very
pretty and pastoral and Impossible.
This "Duenna of a Genius." with its
musically captloned chapters, is not to be
read with one's critical cap on. Take It
up when you don't feel like reading, when
your brain doesn't crave loftier entertain
ment, when your doubting spirit is dulled
by fatigue or illness, and let it lull your
pessimism to sleep. It's a fairy story for
adults, where there are two lovely
princesses instead of one, and two
knights instead of one, to rescue them
from poverty and obscurity and that still
greater calamity, old maidenhood.
The Love of an Obsolete Woman.
"The Love of an Obsolete Woman,"
chronicled by her anonymous self, is an
immoral story, very well written, which
makes it doubly Immoral. But Its im
morality Is not of the sort that makes
converts to the outraging of convention
ality. For this obsolete woman was as
unhappy as though she were not out of
date, but alive and suffering now with
the rest of the nineteenth century world.
Her wickedness lies in her unrepentance,
wliioh she reiterates to the very last lino
of the stron, artistic autobiography,
which has the vivid keenness of a real
self-portrayal.
"Not long ago," says this obsolete
woman, "I heard a young womanâ a re
fined, cultivated, carefully reared crea
tureâtalking of a man with whom she
had been thrown in contact. 'I could
never have cared for him in the least,'
she said, "but he was so ununually well
off that If he had asked me I should not
have felt justified in refusing him. I am
glad he didn't." It was then that a sense
of my primordial antiquity fell upon me:
in that moment I found the title of this
book."
It's a good title and an interesting
story, and an unusual one, for it gives
the other sideâ the other woman's side â
of the old tragedy of one man and two
women. The story of the obsolete woman
is not the glorification of a Camille. It's
self-analysis is pitiless, frank, not senti
mental, and the telling of it is an example
of direct, forceful brevity.
The Spaniard in History.
James Fernald has written a little
book which In less than a hundred and
fifty pages covers two thousand years of
history. "The Spaniard in History" is a
brief, summarized Impeachment of our
enemies and a recital of their traits,
which the author declares are unchanged
since pre-Roman times.

Yosemlte Lodge has taken steps to

ship.

THE OHIO SOCIETY.
At the monthly meeting of the Ohio So
ciety of California there was on last Fri
day a large attendance of people to wit
ness the initiation of twenty-one mem
bers. Each member wore the badge of the
order, a tricolor ribbon with a genuine
Buckeye State chestnut pendant. The
I following named were elected as members
I of the society: Dr. W. Z. King, Sergeant
I K. K. Colby, F. A. Blocksome, L. E. Stan
ton, E. P. Corman, W. B. Wilshire, Pro
fessor William T. Ross, Karl E. Kneiss,
Matthew Turner, Walter R. Kneiss, D. K.
B. Sellers, A. T. Corbus and Harris H.
Fassett. A report that a regiment of
Ohio troops was expected to arrive In
this city soon caused a flutter of excite
ment, and evoked spirited and patriotic
remarks from H. L. Tickner, D. D.
Stubbs, Eli T. Sheppard, James B. Stev
ens, Theo F. George, Dr. F. H. Titus, E.
W. Currier, N. R. Arter. Louis P. Mc-

Henry Hllp, R. A. Bourne. H. C. Fire
baugh, J. L. Grifnng, G. A. Scheer and
Ben. B. Haskell. It was proposed to give
at an early date an entertainment, at
which Ohio's soldiery, now in this city,
should be the guests of honor, and the
matter was finally referred to the execu
tive committee for action. A vote of
thanks was tendered to The Call for hav
ing given publicity to the arrangements of
the society relating to the troops from
Ohio. _____
KNIGHTS AND LADIES OF HONOR.
Never was the hall of Aurora Lodge so
decorated with California's beautiful
flowers as it was last week on the occa
sion of the reception tendered to the
grand officers recently elected. Not only
wag there a profusion of beautiful flow
ers but they were arranged in an artistic
manner. All the grand OK.cers were
present, and there was a large attendance
of visitors from other lodges. The meet-
Ing was called to order by Mrs. L. J.
Wheelock, the grand protector, who is
also protector of Aurora Lodge, and after
the business had been dispatched with
that promptness for which this lodge is
noted there came the social hour. The
grand protector was at the outset pre
sented dv Deputy Grand Protector Mrs.
Annie Thomson, on behalf of Aurora
Lodge, a floral ple'ce representing the
emblem of the order; also a large
bouquet of sweet peas. After that there
was a programme of entertainment and
the serving of icecream and cakes. Prom
inent among the entertainers were Mr.
and Mrs. Igo, who gave vocal solos and
patriotic selections on the piano. The
grand protector delivered a short ad
dress, in which she declared that the war
spirit had not only affected the citizens at
large but had aroused the knights and
ladies to a desire to capture recruits for
what she designated as the "Queen of all
beneficiary associations." She spoke of
the advantages that the order offers, and
then offered a prize of a large American
flag to the lodge that shall show the
greatest increase in beneficial members
by the Ist of March, 1899, and a fine altar
cloth to the lodge that shall perform the
most perfect ritualistic work. She will
also donate a Jewel to the deputy whose
lodge shall be most perfect in ritualistic
work.

MAGAZINES
The Forum has a very interesting
article on "The Little Kingdom of the
President." as Senator Toe-alls called it.
The faults and good points of the gov
ernment of the District ol Columbia are
pointed out. The author quotes General
Beale, who said: "It is better to trust
the ability of the people to govern them
selves than to retain a form of govern
ment which causes a great and growing
population to lose their self-respect and
engenders a feeling of discontent and
degradation because they are not admit
ted to the equal rights of the citizens of
their country." "Congress hears these
arguments, on the one hand,' says Henry
Litchfleld West, "and then listens, on the
other, to the appeal of the people to be
spared from a repetition of the scenes
which converted Washington on election
day into a veritable "devil's caldron.'
Above all Congress is told that the bal
ance of power would be held by the
negro class. This, indeed, is getting very

WHIST
Whist Matters Under Discussion.
The author of "Whist of the Future." Colonel
B. Lowsley of Southsr-a. England, sends us , a
very Interesting communication:
To the Whist Editor of The San Francisco
Callâ Sir: There are points of Interest, raised in
the whist article of your Issue dated April 24,
1898, regarding which you will perhaps allow
me space for remarks: __ Â
.Firstâ The problem which you give from my
work. , "Whist of the Future," was invented
by W. H. Wltfcld, M. A., of Cambridge Uni
versity. Although the solution In my book is a
correct one, I have since formulated, the follow
ing .which is neater, viz.:
Trick No. Iâ S leads ace of clubs.
Trick No. 2 â S trails acÂ« of hearts and N dis
cards a diamond.
Trick No. 3â S letJs small heart and N ruffs.
Tricks 4, 5 and 6â N leads the three remain-
Ing spedes. and then N and S make the two
last tricks with club/diamond or heart, accoru
ing as W and Â£ have discarded.
Secondâ ln speaking of the lead from king,
queen and small, you say:, "I don't suppose
there Is a whist authority In existence In book
form â  but what tells . you to ; lead ' the king.'
Kindly refer to pages 86 and 87 of "Whist of
the Future," and you: will find that the views
there given coincide with those you have ad
vanced in your article. â¢
Thirdâ As regards lead of a small card from
a suit of ace with four small, the issue in this
case wholly depends on whether you propose to
give your i partner a ruffing chance, or whether
you specially, seek to . make establishment of
the salt and to bring in your small long cards."
If â  you expect to â  give . yoifr . partner chance for
ruff, it Is manifest that ; you should lead your
ace and then follow with a small card so as to
get two rounds promptly: but â¢ if you : rely .on
long suit bringing in, it Is best to lead a small
card first, and. so to retain the ace for the sec
ond I round as ; enabling you to clear the suit
more advantageously and completely. â 
-v Fourth â : proposal '. as ; regards a "Time
Bell" reads strangely. to us on this side of the
Atlantic; no English â  player would keep other
members of the table waiting long enough for
the "Time Bell" â  to.be started. In "Whist of
the Future." at ; pages 49 and 146. I have pro
posed-that.-the limit of delay by any player
should be ten seconds. In the international
whist tournaments, ; which I heartily hope may
be arranged. . It Is possible that the time for
play of a card. may be extended to fifteen sec
onds, but if more than that he allowed the man
who delays ; becomes â¢a .- nuisance ,to : the other
members of the table. : - â  :.".
; Fi thâ You ; mention : that 'â¢ Mr. Barney is en
gaged â In ' inventing . such : a shuffling . and d,eal-
Ing ' machine perhaps . as , that j I have referred
to at page 159 of "Whist of the Future." Cer
tainly â he would thereby confer a great benefit
on ! whist i committees ; of ; all countries. If the
dealing machine might also contain a simple
arrangement 1 for ? stamping each card in order
as it is delivered with the letter N. E. S or \%
on the back of It. there could be.no possibility
of the cards becoming: confused or mixed for
overplay, and they , might â  even be played â ; to
the center of ; the table without detriment to
future â¢ Identification of k the hands. The â¢ pack
would not â¢ thereby 'â  be spoiled ; for future use,
because different types of the letters N E S and
W could be subsequently used for stamping. I
am, sir. yours, etc. .;: B. LOWSLEY.

States should be an object lesson of suc
cessful government by autocratic and
oligarchical methods? Is it not remark
able that 300,000 citizens should rest con
tent under conditions which elsewhera
would be condemned as unamerican and
unrepublican? â¢ â¢ â¢ Here, indeed. W q
find an ideal government. Should we,
however, carry its principles to their log
ical conclusion and adapt them to the en
tire country the result must startla all
thinking men, for the people of thÂ«
United States are fostering, at the very
heart of the republic. Ideas, which, exem
plified in a nation instead of a commu
nity, would lead inevitably to the estab
lishment of a monarch upon the throne."
According to the Atlantic, "Newspapers
conducted by lost souls that make mer
chandise of all things that inflame men'g
worst passions, a Congress with no at
tractive political programme for the next
election, and a spirit of unrest among
those classes of the people who had not
wholly recovered from the riot In falsa
hones that Inspired the motley following
of Mr. Bryan in IS96â these and mora
made their contributions to the rapidly
rising excitement."
But all these together could not hava
driven us to war if we had not been will
ing to be driven. In addition to the war
topics there is an animated, altogether
delightful sketch of Montana life in this
number.

what qualities are necessary to the ar

"The ideal manager must not only

DAILY PERILS AGAINST LIFE
ON A TORPEDO-BOAT
A person who has never made a trip on one of the torpedo-boats
cannot realize the imminent and ever-present risks against life
that continually threaten the brave men that make up the crew.
The following story gives a faint idea of the dangers.
LIFE on a torpedo boat Is with- I
out doubt the most thankless \
task a sailor can have allotted
to him, for It is a life of Intense 'â 
misery, alternating with risk of \
death. In the first place, a torpedo i
boat Is constructed on lines totally dif
ferent to any other seagoing cratt. :
For the sake of Bpeed almost every
other warlike and seagoing essential is ;
suppressed. All the parts are made so i
light that they are marvels of work- \
manship. The frames are as frail as
they dare be made. The skin Is skin,
indeed, of the thinnest steel. The lon
gitudinals are mere strips of metal. So
delicate, in fact, is the construction
that a bump even into a floating 6par ;
will twist the bow back on Itself, and j
to brush against, say, the spile of a I
dock would twist the body out of shape
as easily as one might crumple a piece
of stiff paper in the hand. Not infre
quently the space below is so low that
men under the usual height have to be
chosen. On some a man six feet high
could only stand erect in his quarters
by letting his head go up through the
hatchway!
The first six or eight feet behind the
knife-edged bow is given up to a col
lision bulkhead and is not unlike a
| magnified hollow-ground razor. The
space is much too narrow to be used
for anything. Next comes the torpedo
room, then the men's quarters, and the
eighteen or twenty men are literally
packed like sardines. Next come the
boilers and the engine room, occupying
the entire waist of the vessel and part
.of the afterbody. There Is not an inch
' of waste space and the heat is such that
the men who have to keep the fiery
maws aglow with all the fuel they can
i eat must be able to stand fire with
i nearly as much Immunity as do sala-
I manders. In the engine room the en
gineer and his assistants, like the stok
j ers, are stripped to the waist, rivulets
j of sweat roll down their bodies, and
woe betide them if anything breaks,
I as often happens, or a fireman misses
I his footing, which unfortunately hap-
I pens, too, sometimes. Abaft the engine

the stage In San Francisco. There
would be many larger and more impor
tant cities bidding for his talents. But
he has energy, perseverance and ambi
tion, and although it is unlikely that he
âor any one else, for that matterâ will
reach the ideal standard, San Fran
clbco owes him support and will give it
to him, for the simple reason that in
so doing she benefits herself.
What a San Francisco manager
needs is an independent point of
view, and a conviction that the
West is as well able as the East to
furnish dramatic ability. "A real
stock company is the only school of act
ing worthy of the name." In course of
time the presence of Frawley's com-

ors, who now take Horace Greeley's ad

For San Francisco's sake as well as
' for his own Mr. Frawley should aim
high. He should not be content merely
1 with financial success; which, of course,
; was the first thing to be considered
' when he formed his first company and
â  came down to San Francisco prepared
â â  for a Waterloo, but prepared also to
: battle against theatrical annihilation.

room are two small compartments with
four bunks In each. These form, the
wardroom, cabin, messrc-om and state
room of the officers.
An Imaginative person might per
haps be able to see in his mind's eye
what discomforts attend life on board
a torpedo craft when she Is quiet, but
it is difficult to conceive how much
these restricted surroundings are ag
gravated when the torpedo-boat goes
tearing through the water. Every
thing then is set to vibrating and
trembling, as though a great earth
quake had the boat and her crew at its
mercy. It requires long experience to
become habituated to the rocking and
shaking. Writing is out of the ques
tion. Reading ia almost impossible,
and It 1b not easy even to eat and
drink. Add to this the odor of oil, the
smell of steam, the heat and the wet,
and only the stoutest hearts can en
dure it. Rest and sleep are quite im
possible and the crews have to be
changed every three or four days for
recuperation.
The risks, too, are enormous. To
launch her torpedo with any hope of Its
fulfilling its mission the vessel has to
come within 500 yards of its Intended
victim. She is consequently well with
in the range of the machine guns of
the gunboat for at least 900 yards.
Rushing up at the rate of twenty-four
knots an hour she would cover the 900
yards of danger space in about sixty
six seconds. Then she has to fire, turn
and return once more over the dan
gerous 900 yards. Altogether she is in
imminent danger for about two min
utes and a half. It does not seem
long, but when it la remembered that
the rate of fire of the machine guns is
1000 shots per minute, one sees better
what a thrilling two minutes and a
half It Is. The little torpedo-boat Is
exposed to about 2500 shots, and If only
1 per cent struck their mark she would
be hit twenty-five times.
No range- finders or eplder-web
sights are used to draw a torpedo bead
on a hostile warship from the deck of
a torpedo-boat. The Blghtlng Is done
with the eye of Judgment and exper
ience, gained from practice. It Is an
exaggerated case of wing shooting, for
when the torpedo Is launched the boat
is traveling rapidly, and the ensign,
hanging over the off side of the boat,

At any rate It Is to be hoped that Mr. ;

It is a new Frawley company that
makes Us debut as an organization to
morrow night at the Columbia, though
members of it have been seen here with
various companies. Madeleine Bouton,
who retained her own name when she left
Reno, Nov., to go upon the stage, was
here with A. M. Palmer's company that
Included Julia Arthur, Wilton Lackaye,
and others. She is most favorably known
in the East through her creation of the
title role in "The Tarrytown Widow,"
which will be presented here later by the
Frawley company. She has played all
sorts of roles, from Letty Fletcher in
"Saints and Sinners" to Myra Brimstone in
"The Globe Trotter." Edward M. Bell
was here last with the same Palmer com
pany Miss Bouton played with. During
the last season he has appeared in New
York in a variety of parts, ranging from
Marshal Lefebvre in "Madame Sans
Gene" to Alfred Hastings in "All the
Comforts of Home." Theodore Roberts
played the Indian chief when "The Girl I
Left Behind Me" was here. He was the
villain in "The Heart of Maryland," when
Mrs. Carter produced Belasoo'a very suc
cessful plaY here. Cora Tinnie San Fran
cisco met in Hoyt's "Trip to Chinatown."
Maude Winter, the ingenue, is an Oak
land girt, who made her debut with the
Coghlan-Dix^y-Barrymore combination at
tho Columbia a few years ago. Eleanor
Carey was with Richard Mansfield's com
pany on their last visit to this coast. Fan
cho'n Campbell was out here with Neil
Burgess' "County Fair," and she played
Flavla in the Frohmans' production of
"The Prisoner of Zenda" in the East.
Sam Edwards is comedian in chief, and
Fred Williams, who is the father of his
famous son, and who was Frohman'a
stage manager for many years, will direct
the Frawley performances.
Misses Carey, Bouton, Campbell and
Winter and Messrs. Bell. Frawley, Ed
wards, Roberts. Burke and Conger will
appear to-morrow night in "Number
Nine, or the Lady of Ostend."

When a torpedo-boat goes Into action
everybody Is ordered balow except the
man at the torpedo-tube and the ex
ecutive officer, who "sights" the self
moving missile. The engine Is spin
ning the propeller-wheel around 450
times a minute. Not a light Is seen
on the boat, and It drives straight
through the night toward the black
shape which sweeps the water with
luminous fingers of the electric search
light, feeling for Just such deadly pests
as a torpedo-boat. The little craft
has no puffing steam to betray It, for
every bit of steam goes to the conden
ser, to return as water to the tremb
ling boilers.
An impression Is abroad that a tor
pedo is shot under water. The fact is
the torpedo is ejected from a tube
which is mounted on a standard bolted
to the deck. The tube may be swung
around, and has a vertical motion, so
that the Inclination may be varied. The
torpedo is ejected by a charge of four
ounces of black powder, Just enough to
throw the automobile projectile Into
the water. When once in the sea the
torpedo's own propeller drives It to the
mark at the rate of 20 knotsâ nearly 34
miles â an hour.
While the principal object In "firing"
a torpedo is to blow up a hostile ship,
it Is equally Important to prevent the
torpedo exploding near the torpedo
boat, so the firing mechanism per
forms a double service. It keeps the
torpedo a harmless shell until it is at
least 75 yards from the launching point,
and it explodes the guncotton when the
war nose rubs up against the bottom
of the enemy's ship. The device which
does this Is regulated by a small four
bladed screw fan on the extreme bow
point of the war nose. When the pre
scribed distance is covered the mechan
ism driven by the screw fan sets the
"firing pin" In a position to strike the
detonating cap of the primer case when
the torpedo comes in contact with the
target.
The true value of the torpedo boat In
naval operations has to be yet recog
nized. So far In our present war it has
not played ;in important part, and it is
possible that the future will relegate
its greater usefulness to coast and har
bor defenses. Still, it is even now in
naval warfare a formidable foe. The
blazing searchlights that a threatened
ship turns on the surrounding water
are not sufficient to avert attack; the
netting with which vessels are sur
rounded is easily cut in twain by the
nippers or scissors attached to the tor
pedo, and a vessel assailed by torpedo
boats is pretty certain to succumb, al
though it is certain to Rink several of
its assailants in the struggle.
An example of the efficacy of the tor
pedo boat may be found In the blowing
up about four years ago of the famous

"Under the Polar Star," Clay M.
Greene's spectacular drama of an expe

George P. Webster the star In the char-
acter part of Dr. Rabon, an amusing
and volatile French scientist. Silas Rod
man, a Boston millionaire, has fitted out
an expedition to discover the north pole.
In the far northern latitudes the steamer
Is seen approaching the Icebergs, which
finally crash upon and surround her,
where she remains firmly Imbedded for
two years. Throughout the two preced
ing acts tho romance and Intrigue of the
play have been unfolded. Helen Blame,
fearing danger lor her betrothed, ships
with the expedition, disguised as a col
ored cabin boy.
The third act witnesses the desertion of
the officers by the crew, incited to mutiny
by the villain. A realistic conflagration
scene shows the party perishing amid the
flames of the burning vessel, which Bran
don has fired. The fourth act Is a weird
scenic spectacle. The entire stage is
transformed into a sea of floating ice, the
party being seen upon the moving floes.
Dr. Rabo.n discovers that they are in 90
degrees of latitude, passing directly over
the north pole, and at that point the
weak and famished adventurers fling Old
Glory's folds to the Arctic brcr-zf.
Crunching, grinding sounds are heard, the
floe is rent asunder, and as the party are
rapidly drilling apart, their despair is
transformed to joy by the arrival of a
rescuing party in a steam launch. The
villain, in the face of death, having
signed a confession exonerating the hero,
the story happily ends, Helen confessing
her love for him.
Jhe Orpheum.
Miss Fanny Wentworth, direct from
London, is one of the new features at the
Orpheum for this week. She is a pianist
of renown and will appear at the Orphe
um in an act which she calls "An Up-to-
Date at Home," which is interspersed
with piano recitals, songs and character
Impersonations. She is very clever and
comes with the most flattering English
press notices. Carlin and Clark are the
new comedy features. They are German
! Chilean battle-ship Blanco Encalada,
which was guarded by every known
protection, but was blown to fragments
during the night by the fourth torpedo,
three having missed fire.
Torpedo boat destroyers, however, are
very much more effective than the tor
pedo boats â which, by the way, the
British Government has for six years
ceased to build. For one thing, being
j larger than the torpedo boat, the de
j stroyer can attain a higher speed.
! Then, again, It carries torpedoes and
j does all the work of the torpedo boat;
â  and, In addition, being armed with
! heavy guns, it can overtake and de
i stroy the enemy's torpedo craft.
Skobeleff understood his men and

WAR IS BOOMING CALIFORNIA'S
QUICKSILVER MINES
Since the war was declared the Great Almaden quicksilver mines
of Spain have been gradually closing down. The price of the metal
has jumped, and the famous San Jose mines, next to the.largest in
the world, are reaping the full benefit.
MERCURY, or quicksilver, to
use the more common mercan
tile term, has been rising in
price, not rapidly but steadily,
since the outbreak of hostili-
ties between this country and
Spain, and its rise is due directly to
the war, although in a curious way.
Spain produces more quicksilver than
any other country in the world. Un
til three or four years ago thousands
of pounds were annually imported from
that country into the United States.
The next largest quicksilver yielding
mines are in California, and have been
worked for years, but while the metal
could be brought from Spain free of
duty the California product was not
able to compete largely with the for
eign. Since the Wilson tariff bill of
1894,--ut a duty of 7 cents a pound upon
quicksilver (a rate unchanged by the
Dingley tariff) practically all importa
tion has ceased, and consumers have
bought the California mercury. Hence
the apparent strangeness of the fact
that, although we import no quicksilver
from Spain, but produce our own,
nevertheless the war has sent up the
price of the article here Just as it has
in. Europe.
The fact is that the American prices
are ruled entirely by foreign prices, and
are kept at figures just below the cost l
of Importation. The great Spanish
quicksilver mines at Almaden are con
trolled by the Rothschilds, who are
said to have taken them some time ago
as security for the Spanish bonds which
they hold. Since the beginning of the
war they have raised the prices, be
cause of the riots in Spain and the gen
erally unsettled conditions among the
laboring classes.
Now, the California mines are also
controlled by one firm, the California
Quicksilver Agency â it does not like to
be called a "syndicate !" Immediately
on an advance in foreign prices this
California agency, ruling the American
product, raises its figures, correspond
ingly, and consumers have no choice
but to submit.
It is stated by competent authorities
that one central control of the Cali
fornia mines was made necessary by
the fact that under the old regime the

honor, called La Duse. It contained only

Sydney Rosenfeld writes from Vienna to
the Dramatic Mirror: "I have this day
concluded an agreement with Mark
Twain, who is residing In Vienna, where
by he and I are to work conjointly on a
new comedy. He has to-day given me
the rough draft of the play as It h*3
emerged from his foundry. It will prob
ably be with this play that Mr. Sire and
I will begin operations together in a busi
ness way."
Jean de Reszke vowed when he left New
York that he never would sing purely
sentimental parts again, that he was done
with "Faust and "Rnmfo" for all time.
In his recent tour of Russia he produced
Wagner operas exclusively, none of which
was favored by the Czar's presence. But
when De Reszke's manager waited upon
the "Little Father" with an Invitation tho
Czar accepted, choosing for the first opera
"Faust" and for the second "Romeo and
Juliet."
James Hamilton Howe and Joseph 11.
Wlllard, who was concert master of tne
Philharmonic orchestra, have begun to
organize for next season. The orchestra
will include fifty or sixty Instruments.
A few preliminary rehearsals will be held
during the summer, the regular work be
ginning about August. Classical over
tures, easier symphonies, entr'actes, bal
let music, symphonic poems and pro
gramme music will be taken up for re
hearsal and for public rendition.
Ovide Musin, violinist and director of
the Superior Violin Class at the Royal
Conservatory of Music at Liege, Belgium,
will return to this country about the Ist
of August to open a violin school, which
will be conducted on the same principle
as the Liege Conservatory. This school
will be under the persohal direction of
Mr. Musin; he will be assisted by several
violinists of international reputation, all
graduates of the Liege Conservatory.
The attempt to abolish the "claque" at
the Vienna Opera-house, says the London
Chronicle, has been followed by some
lively times. An Instant result was that
each performer provided a band of pri
vate supporters. Not content with ap
plauding their employers, these hirelings
thought it necessary to hiss all rival
singers, and the auditorium became al
most as lively a place as the Reichsrath.
Accordingly, the administration posted up
a notice forbidding any applause what
ever.
From a preface to a volume of drawings
by Mme. Yvette Quilbert it appears that
she was born January 20, 18b8. but this
point is not insisted upon, the writer add
ing: "This requires investigation. It can
not give Yvette's age. Yvette has no age.
She has eternal youth." Yvette^'s mother
was an embroiderer of great merit. The
daughter was apprenticed to a working
dressmaker, but her natural bent for the
stage asserted itself and overcame man}'
obstacles. The apprentice dressmaker is
now a wealthy woman, with a fine house
in Paris and a chateau In the country,
and an American husband.
competition among the different mine
owners was ruinous, and the business
could not be carried on at a profit to
anybody.
Quicksilver, which is unique among
metals in being fluid at ordinary tem
peratures, is put up and shipped in
flasks, containing seventy-six and a
half pounds each. The price is now
59 cents a pound, or $43 50 a flask, when
in quantities of from twenty-five to a
hundred flasks. In larger lots, of over
a hundred flasks, it is $43 a flask. This
is about $3 higher than at the begin
ning of the war.
The respective quantities produced In
California and in Spain may be ascer
tained from a comparison of the fol
lowing figures: Last year California
produced 26,079 flasks, and in 1896 29,863
flasks.
Since practically all of the Spanish
quicksilver ~oes to London, the figures
of the imports there may be taken as
about the same as the output of the
Spanish mines. In the year which end
ed on October 31. 1897, there had been
sent to London from Spain 46.577 flasks,
and In the corresponding period of 1896,
40,999 flasks.
It will thus be seen that the Spanish
mines produce much more abundantly
than those in California. They are ap
parently Inexhaustible, for they are
supposed to have . been first worked
over two thousanQ five hundred years
ago, and still reveal rich masses of un
touched ore in their depths. They are
situated near the town of Almaden or
Almaden del Azogue (the mines of
quicksilver), in the south central part
of Snain, fif*- -five miles southwest of
the city of Ciudad Real, and about one
hundred and fifty miles northeast of
Cadiz.
According to Pliny, they were worked
in 700 B. C, and â¢â¢n his time sent an
nually 10,000 pounds of cinnabar (the
ore of mercury) to Rome. The mines
have now been excavated to a depth
of nearly a thousand feet below the
surface and the richness of the ore in
creases with each lower level.
The ten successive floors or le-vels
upon *-hich the mines are worked are
nearly a hundred feet apart. Masonry
and pillars of the ore itself are used as
supports for the roofs of the levels.
Forty per cent of the heat of an or
dinary fire goes up the chimney.

ASSOCIATED BANKS' STATEMENT.
NEW YORK, June 11.â Financier says: i
The New York banks, despite the active de- i
mand for funds, expressed In a loan expan- '
sion of $9,144,200 for the week Just ended, can
not find use for all the money they are receiv- !
ing, and the reserve is higher by $1,591,400 than
reported seven days ago. Deposits increased
$14,591,200, making a gain of $57,500,000 within
a month. As the increase on cash account I
was $5,289,200, it will be seen that the greater
part of the deposit growth was obtained by
entering credits on the books against loans.
This haa been going on for some time and re- I
fleets a very satisfactory condition In mer
cantile circles. The season for early redls- :
counting for country banks is at hand and
some business Is being done In this line, but
not enough to count in general results. The !
interior banks are so well supplied with cash '
that they are In a better position than . ever '
to endure over the summer. A detailed analy
; sis of the statement for the week shows that !
[ five of the sixty-five clearing Institutions have
placed the bulk of the loan, while seven insti- '
tutions, most of which have heavy Interior \
' connections, gained three-fourths of the In- '
1 creased deposits. Seven banks hold consider- I
i ably over half the $179,000,000 of specie reported '
i last week.
LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, June 11.â The Evening Post's j
London financial cablegram says: The stock
f markets here were quiet to-day, but firm.
j This was notably the case with Americans, led j
i by Atchlson, which was said to be bought by j
! a bull pool In New , York. The Interest spread
1 to other shares. It Is believed that the United |
; States loan next week may be subscribed many
I times over, . and this may sentimentally affect
the share market. â¢
The t discount market here again shows
! Indications of hardening. More American bins
i are offered for forward delivery than for u>mt
: time past. The decline in New York. exchange
: Is also a factor, while I learn from good sourer-*
1 that a large mass of German bills, created In
1 connection with â¢ the ' remittance fop months
â  hack of Chinese loan fund-, to London, will
I mature next. week and will mostly be renewed.
i Gold was quoted , to-day at 77s 10% d. The

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, June 11.â Considering the extreme- !
ly bearish character of the Government crop j
report, wheat started fairly steady. A slight i
improvement In the weather, however, weak |
foreign markets and growing sense of the sig
nificance of the Immense acreage sown to wheat
this season, together with its generally ex
cellent condition produced a feeling of weak
ness. Longs quickly lost heart and began to j
let- go. -The fright soon became so general ,
that the liquidation rush finally became more
of a matter of finding buyers than of prices.
Short selling led by Cudahy was also general.
There was a slight reaction during the last
hour of the session, due apparently more 10
profit taking In the early short selling than any
real Increase of strength â¢In the general situ- ,
ation. The Indicated world's shipments for the
week are about 12,000,000 bushels, compared
with 5,322,000 bushels last year. July closed
with a loss of l%c, and September closed lV*c
lower. . , ,
The weather conditions were unfavorable for
corn, but the weakness of wheat and provis
ions started corn, prices down hill. July closed :
%@%c lower. ;'â¢â â -. â  Â
Oats followed corn, opened steady and then >
yielded. Shorts gave thÂ« market good support,
however, and prices became better near the
close. July closed He lower.
There was another slump in provisions. Many
outsiders who did not act on the yellow fever
news yesterday let go their long provisions
to-day. There was also some important sell-
Ing by packers. The English concerns who .
are short were the buyers. July. pork declin

TALLOWâ circular of W. B. Sumner &

improving during the past month and values
are now marked at somewhat higher figures.
This. advance has been caused, in a measure,
by more activity in the Chicago market, al
though only moderate sales have been made for
export. .
"The general trade in this city has bought
freely so that the stocks now held are compar
atively small. The dry season of California
has lessened the output of tallow, and there
fore, â ; for some months at least, we may look
for a firm market on tallow." .

WHAT THE GIRLS DID
FOR THEIR NATIVE LAND
â¢ rpHE 3 o'clock gong had sounded.
I Scarcely five minutes had elapsed
I before the pupils of the Jefferson
.1 High School came Hooding
through the broad gateways.
Boys and girls gathered together in
excited groups, discussing the one
theme of the day â
.One group in particular would have
excited the curiosity of a passer-by. It
was composed of about ten boys and
girls going down the highway that led
past the mill. "I say, fellows," said
Jack Summers, one of the merriest of
the group, "wouldn't it be a huge joke
If we all arrayed ourselves in flags and
the trappings of war and made a raid
on the Peraltas' farm? They are Span
ish and I suppose are helping their
countrymen."
â¢ "That's great, Jack," cried Larry
Brently. "Let the girls join in, too;
they can carry broomsticks and wear
fantastic dresses, while we can bring
our rifles. What do you say, girls?"
All the girls voted the plan a good
one and said that they would join in
if no harm was done.
"I think it is a fine plan," -said Del
phine Graham, "and I am sure we will
all join in if you boys promise to do
nothing wild. But what is the mat
ter, Mercedes? You have not said a
â word. Do you not consider Jack's plan
a novel one?"
The girl she addressed was on the
outside of the group. She was tall and
thin. Her face was striking. The
features were irregular, but every line
seemed to indicate a strong and noble
nature.
Her blue-gray eyes were now flash-
Ing in angry scorn. She had been look
ing directly ahead, but when her com
panions addressed her she turned and
facing them, she said, angrily:
â¢"I consider the whole affair infa
mous, and I am surprised that you
F girls should echo the sentiments of
Jack Sommers. what have the Per
altas got to do with the treachery of
Spain? Are not the Peralta boys as
much American as we are? It is true
their parents were born in Spain, but
they have reared their children to be
patriotic men and women. Why, it
ivas only last night that father told me
that Juan, Jose and Rudolph Peralta
have enlisted in the First Company of
Volunteers."
A suppressed murmur rose' as she
paused to draw breath. She began
again presently, her voice trembling
with emotion.
"Futhermore, my father said that he
met old Arguella Peralta yesterday and
he asked him if the report about his
sons was true."
"Yes," answered the old man, "my
boys have enlisted in the American
army and I am proud of it. I would
sooner see my three boys laid in
the old churchyard on the hill than
have them prove unpatriotic cowards.
They were born Americans and as
such I have reared them. lam a Span
lard, but I am proud of niy American
sons-."
There was silence tor a few minutes
after this vehement outburst. Jack
Bommers smothered a lump in his throat
and, turning a shame-faced counte
nance to Mercedes, he said:
R"I am sorry I spoke so hastily, Mer
cedes. Believe me, I did not look at the
matter in a rational light. Moreover, I
thank you for telling us that now, in
stead of making war upon them, I
think it would be a good idea to sere
nade them some night before the boys
leave."
This plan was unanimously agreed
to, Mercedes volunteering her services
as violinist.'
"It i:- too bad you are not a boy, Mer
cedes. You would m.ike a fine general
in the war with all that fire and spirit.
It is distressing to see such martial
THE BUMPKINS LISTEN TO THE DUDE AND DRUM THE LANDLADY AND HER BILL OUT OF CAMP AS A WAR MEASURE.
spirit wasted," said Larry Brently,
with sarcastic intonation.
"I do not see that my martial spirit,
as you term it, is wasted," said Mer
cedes, haughtily. "If I were a man my
highest ambition would be to defend
my flag from ignominious insult, but
since I have the misfortune, as you
seem to consider it, to be a girl, I will
do my share with my father's permis
sion. I will go to the war as a nurse."
Shouts of applause greeted this vehe
ment outburst, but Larry, not In the

"Does it!" exclaimed Edwina Dalton
in tones of angry denunciation, "well,
then, La/ry Brently. we will prove to
you that girls can do more than talk."
ter this the group separated, the
boys ijuite elated at Larry's fine speech,
as they considered it. the girl?, fuming
inwardly at the ungallant remarks.
A few days after Mercedes Clinton
called her girl friends together at recess
and ' devulged to them the following
plan:
"Girls," she began, "it is only six
days ago since Larry Brently dared to
say that prir'.s were good for gossip
only. I was deeply pained at his words,
a' d since then I have been planning to
prove that girls are not martial in
words only, but in spirits also.
"You al! know that the President has
said that no women shall go to the
front as nurses, s*o that cuts us off
there, but what do you say to forming
a club of girls only; we will call it the
Maine Club. We will then secure tal
ent for an entertainment, charging 50
cents for admission, for the benefit "f
r supply fund. We will work in
r, only the talent we secure 'and a
few of the leading citizens who will
help us will know who we are.
"Of course the entertainment will be
composed of a farce, "patriotic anthems,
tableaux and address*-?. Attached to
the tickets we will have subscription
blanks, and after the show is over we
will ask people to subscribe according
to the value they set upon the per
formance."
fries of delight greeted this proposi
tion. Mercedes was chosen president
of the Maine Club, which was com
posed of twelve girls "who could keep a
secret.
THE SAN FBANOISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 12, 1898.
Soon the tickets were printed an(J for
sale In all the stores.
People's curiosity was aroused. They
wondered who the members of the
Maine Club were. They bought tickets
out of mere curiosity.
One day Mr. Wesley, principal of the
Jefferson High School, who was also
in the secret, ordered all the to
appear in the assembly hall, when they
were seated and he rose and said: "I
have here a communication from the
president of the Maine Club, who de
sires me to read It to the whole school."
Mr. Wesleyâ Dear Sir: I, as president
of the Maine Club, write to ask you if
you will kindly distribute this bundle of
tickets among the pupils of your school.
It is for a noble cause, and I trust that
the pupils will respond accordingly. We
do not wish to be k*awn at present. Hop
ing to receive a favorable answer, I re
main yours truly,
PRESIDENT OF MAINE CLUB.
Enthusiasm ran high after the read
ing of this letter, and not one pupil
took less than five tickets to sell. The
members of the Maine Club smiled
knowingly when Larry Brently volun
teered to sell twenty tickets.
It was the night of the entertain
ment, the old town hall was resplen
dent in flags and bunting.
The entertainment went off glori
ously, and before the national hymn,
"America," was sung by the audience
twelve girls with regalias of red. white
and blue appeared upon the stage.

corps from Sacramento.
Mercedes Clinton carried a banner,
which she unfurled, upon which was
written in letters of gold, "MAINE
CLUB."
Great were the cries of the audience,
and the old town hall fairly rocked
from the effects of the tremendous din.
After the noise had subsided Mer
cedes made known the reason for the
subscription tags attached to each
ticket.
It 1b needless to say that the dona
tions were generous, for when the re
ceipts were counted it was found that
they had made a clear profit of nine
hundred dollars.
The next morning Larry Brently
came forward and apologized hand
somely to the girls for the insulting
remark of the week before.
The Maine Club still thrives, b**" its
membership has increased to sixty
girls. They did not end their good
work that night. It is their intention
to knit socks and make shirts for the
brave boys in blue who may need them
sadly before the war is over.

HEROIC BEAUTY AND HER
PERILOUS ADVENTURE
BEAUTY, she who by love was able
to transform the unfortunate
Beast Into his proper shape of a
Prince, he having been made a
beast by witchcraft, heard that
there were, in a cave, surrounded by the
dreadful fastness of the Thorny For
est, two young princesses, who had been
turned Into wolves by a bad fairy. As
soon as she heard this she went to an
old Wizard who dwelt in a hut under
a charmed linden and asked him what
she could do to save the young girls
from their unhappy plight.
"Child," said the Wizard, "you know
not what you ask; to save them you
must go alone over a perilous path
way, beset with so many dangers that
the stoutest-hearted man might be ex
cused for turning back In fear. I love
your prince, so that I must tell him,
and he will save you from the danger
you have already Invited, for I see that
the bad fairy is now angry with you."
Beauty answered In a firm voice:
"What you can say cannot frighten me.
If I can save them that will I do. No
less would repay the debt I owe for my
own happiness."
"But you will lose your life and with
that dreadful happening will go out the
hapT'im-ss of the Prince, whom you love
so dearly."
"WiÂ«ard, say no more. lam not to
be moved. All that I dared to save
the Beast, bo much will I now dare for
these helpless ones, for a light breaks
ever me â that they can be saved only
by a young srirl. and that I am the one
for whose coming they have so long
hopefully waited."
"Wise and brave girl, you have read
THE INFANTRY.

And will we ever be defeated, gallant
boys? I guess no.
Defeat is not the sort of game played
by the boys of Fresno.
the secrets of magic, truly; and I see
that you are the favored one of fnte;
but I also love the Prince and my duty
t > him is to see that you do. not go upon
this journey, which he, with frequent
tparj; and with great distress, h;is fore
seen. My advice to you is, to think of
this no more."
Forth went Beauty without another
word, but the Wizard read her rniml
and knew that she would go on h^r t-r
rand of mercy. She tarried not, nor
returned to the palace of the Prince, but
turned into a dreary wood, which
she had been forbidden by the Prince
to visit.
Her heart told her truly that this was
the way she must go. She "passed
through a little wicket gate that shut
behind her with a loud clang. At the
same time a voice told her:
"Never more alive shall you pass this
way until you have met with success.
You are now In the land of the bafl
Fairy, who Is proud of her name. By
all acts will she try to deceive you. Be
ware and farewell."
Beauty looked backward and saw
her Prince standing near the wicket
Kate and his tears flowed so fast and
his voice was raised In such piteous
entreaty that had she been less bravn
she would have turned back. But shÂ»
only cried out, "Fart-well for a tima,
sweetheart; and if It be forever, then
forever think of me, your dear
Beauty."
"Farewell, my love," the Prince ans
wered, as well as he could, his voieÂ»
being broken by sobs. "If I can find
the way I will follow you."
"Be brave, be brave." With these
parting words Beauty disappeared as
Fhe passed around the turn of the path,
and even her voice was lost to the
Prince. And now he broke out in fresh
lamentations, every accent of which
was borre to Beauty, while the Prince
was not able to hear one word of con
solation which she spoke. This was a
part of the wickedness of the bad fairy,
who hoped to dishearten Beauty. The
words Beauty spoke were mocked by
the bad fairy, and the Prince thought
that he heard Beauty say cruelly:
"Alas, I see now. in this wood, that I
have wasted my time and love, for here
is a paradise from which you have long
and cruelly kept me away."
So the Prince's heart bled afresh, and
had it not been that he was so true, so
brave and so kind, he would have
thmieht that Beauty had suddenly be
come unworthy of hid great love. But
he was wise as well as brave, and he
thought truly that this wn/s not Beauty
who was speakiner so. Long, long dayfl
passed before he knew whether he
could be happy more. Long clays and
long nights he wept for the loss of
Beauty, for his fears told him that he
would never see her more.
Day after day he asked the "Wizard
to show him how to pass through the
wicket gate by the path which Beauty

had taken. Day after day he threw
himself against the pate, bruising him
self sadly in his attempts to break in.
He heard mocking laughter and raged
the more. At times he called aloud the
name of Beauty. No answer came
back except echoes. Only one day a
cruel message came to him, "Beauty Is
dead for her folly." From that time he
would not be comforted.
But brave Beauty was not dead. She
walked through the wilderness until
her feet were sore and bleeding. She
found no lack of berries to eat, for the
cruel, bad fairy had it in mind to per
mit Beauty to tire herself out and get
co discouraged that she would be will
ing to turn back. Around her were
strange noises to lure her on. She fan
cied that she heard the voices of the
unfortunate Princesses calling to her
and almost ran. -Then her heart sank
as she heard a mocking laugh that she
had learned too well, and she knew that
the bad fairy was watching and mak
ing fun of her. Even the voices of the
fierce eagles in the forest, who fre
quently swooped down and threatened
to tear her hands and face with sharp
beak and talons, had the voice of the
bad fairy. Then Beauty would hear
the sound as of a great waterfall, and
the earth would tremble under her feet.
She would start back in terror, only to
hear once more that mocking laugh.
Hour after hour, pursuing her weary
way, ready to fall with fatigue, but too
alarmed by shrieks, howls and other
terrifying noises to dare to sleep, what
was her bitter grief and chagrin and
sense of defeat when she came to the
very gate from which she had started,
and knew that the wicked fairy had led
her in a huge circle, so large that she
had never guessed Its curves. So she
had done all this for nothing, and she
might pass many days this way and
not accomplish her end. She was too
brave to try to open the gate. So long
as she lived she would not turn back.
Was her Prince near? She rested a lit
tle and then moved wearily on.
Soon her brain began to imagine that
strange shapes were in the way, and
they had ah appearance of reality.
Lions were crouched, ready to spring
upon her; tigers lashed their tails fur
iously from side to side; serpents of
huge size hung from trees across her
pathway and sought, with rapid move
ment, to inflict death upon her, and she
could not help thinking how terrible it
would be to be wrapped about by their
icy fold, and to be slowly crushed to
death. Who could blame Beauty that
she sobbed?
She lay down upon a couch of thorns
and tried to sleep. Hardly had she

closed her eyes when soft musio
aroused her. Softer was the strain
she heard than the west wind when it
sets all the fiery harebells to ringing;
softer and sweeter than the bird that
sings its love song over its little bird
lings, alseep in their downy nest un
der the shadow of the flowering thorn.
Beauty was wide awake in an instant.
"Beauty, Beauty," said a soft voice.
"What would you?"
"Here are the Princesses whom you
have come to seek. "Wake while the
bad fairy sleeps, for she thinks that
you are dreaming. One moment only
we have to tell you what to do. Then
we will be lost if you do not hear and
attend to what we say.
"Follow the path no more, but boldly
plunge into the briers. You will come
to a lodge. There be bold."
Beauty felt comforted and slept
soundly. When she awoke she plunged
boldly in among the briers, where there
was no path, just as she had been di
rected to do. She had many times to
creep upon her hands and knees and
the briers tore her flesh cruelly. When
the bad fairy saw that Beauty would
not be turned back, she allowed the
briers to bo set aside that the girl
might the sooner reach the lodge where
her courage would be tried to its ut
termost.
The keeper of the lodge, a wrinkled
and weazened little man. let her pass
through the gate and into a large gar
den without any objection. She was
not alone. Before her stood a man
who had a sword and he said in a sol
emn tone of voice: "I am Bluebeard
the Second, and it is my joy to cut oft
young girla' heads. When I have cut
off ten I will be free to go hence from
this prison yard."
"And how many have you cut off no
far?"
"Nine."
"And mine Isâ"
"Yours is the tenth."
"Is there no way for me to escape V
"One only. Give up your Idea of
saving the Princesses from their fate
and the bad fairy will even yet forgive
you for your daring."
Now Beauty was bright, and when
she heard this she knew that the course
she had taken had already won a par
tial victory over the bad fairy. a nd sno
said in a firm and bold voice:
"I will never give up the struggle
until the sisters are released and
happy."
Bluebeard whirled his sword rapidly
around his head and stepped forward
to seize Beauty by her hair. Beauty
screamed with fear, for the keen blade
of the sword came so near to her that
she could feel the wind as it passed.
It was as sharp as a razor and hissed
dreadfully.
Beauty was nimble and managed to
dodge the sword, but Bluebeard over
took her so nearly that he almost had
her by the hair when he caught his
foot In a vine, and he fell.
Before Bluebeard could rise Beauty
had th.c sword, which flew from his
hand.
"Mercy, mercy," begged the mon
ster.
"On one condition; be my slave and
do as I bid."
"The bad fairy will kill mÂ« If I do."
"March," commanded Beauty. The
monster cowered and obeyed.
He led the way to the entrance of a
cave. Forth from the cave rushed two
wolves, their jaws dripping with foam,
their throata sending out hoarse
threats.
The monster grinned horribly, for he
thought that Beauty would turn back
affrighted, and that so she would be
defeated, and the wolves would tear
her In pieces. Look at her as she
stands there! She shows no fear, but
waits for the wolves, which bound to
ward her rapidly with great leaps.
And now they are bo near that she
looks into their eyes and feels their
hot breath. She paused not a second;
as they came within reach she struck
at them with the sharp sword, and the
heads of both roll in the dust. In the
place of the two wolves stand the two
Princesses.
A voice sang through the woods
"Behold, how love has again won the
day; the victory is with Beauty, who
feared not Bluebeard nor feared fierce
wolves, when she was led on by un
selfish love to save the sisters even as
she fj 'ed the Prince."
At vie menti6n of the Prlnoe the
gates of the horrible wilderness were
thrown open and the Prince, ever
faithful, walked bo-ldly in and was led
to where Beauty stood. They went
out of the place together, and as the
gate could never be closed again, the
forest was soon destroyed by order of
the Prince and the power of the bad
fairy departed at the same time.
Neither the bad fairy nor Bluebeard
has ever been seen since.

PREPARING FOR THE
BIG IRISH FAIR
ENERGETIC WORK BEING DONE
BY COMMITTEES.
Special Commissioner Sent to Ireland.
Historical Buildings and
Scenes Prepared.
Remarkable Interest Is being manifest
ed in the proposed Irish Fair, which will
open at the Mechanics' Pavilion on the
20th of August. At a meeting In the
Occidental Hotel Friday evening repre
sentatives of both sexes were enthusias
tic In their efforts to make the affair a
grand success. Arrangements for booths
and other interesting attractions were
consummated, and Michael O'Donnell
was appointed a special commissioner to
Ireland. He will leave shortly for i
Queenstown, and will on his arrival at j
that port continue his journey to all the j
historical battlefields and famous places
In order to obtain relics, which are to be
raffled off at the fair. Bottles of water '
will be sent by him from Shannon, Kll- i
larney, Boyne and other famous streams !
to be used in making bottles of perfume, j
which will be disposed of at the fair.
John O'Leary, president of the '9S Cen
tenary Association of Ireland, will bo
asked to open the fair by cable, and
Commissioner O'Donnell will try and se
sure from Michael Davltt a blackthorn
to be raffled off for the benefit of Celtic
Hall.
From present Indications, Individuals
and societies will attend the fair from all
portions of the State, and the comfort !
of the visitors will be carefully looked
after by the management.
The Pavilion will be handsomely dec- {
orated for the occasion with flags, bunt- <
ing and paintings. The broad expanse of
floor space will be covered with buildings
and scenes dear to the heart of every one
who owes his birth to the land of sod
and familiar to the student of history.
Blarney Castle will rise toward the
dome of the hall, with ivy clinging to its i
turreted tower and battlemented walls. :
Irish lads and lassies will dance before <
It to the weird tunes of bagpipes. Pict- i
uresque Tara Hall will occupy an im
poriant position In the building, and its ;
noble proportions will be oeen to advan- i
tage. Besides the Bank of Ireland build- i
ing, Irish Houses of Parliament in Dub- !
lin, there will be a postoffice booth, Lim- !
erlck Race booth, a "Rocky Road to â 
Dublin," the Lakes of Killarney fishing
pond and other important attractions too I
numerous to mention.
In addition to these there will be Indus
trial and demonstrating booths and ex- !
hlbits made by local firms. Some brisk j
bidding for good positions will be done |
this week.
The fair will open on August 20 and '
close on September 10. It will be open to j
the public every day from 2 to 10:30 p. m., |
Sundays excepted. The proceeds will be j
devoted to the erection of a new hall
where. all the Irish societies may meet.
The Clarkson Jury Disagreed.
The Jury in the case of the Govern- (
ment against William Clarkson was j
brought in the United States District |
Court yesterday morning at- 10 o'clock |
and discharged, it having been unable to i
agree after an all night session. It !
stood six to six. Sympathy for the wife \
and children of the defendant had mucn !
to do with the disagreement. The case
will be retried soon.
Clarkson was foreman of the rolling de
partment of tho Mint, and was accused j
of stealing gold bullion therefrom ana ;
having it sold by Martin Eggers, a grocer,
and E. D. Carter, a blacksmith. He con- i
tradicted their testimony point blank.
