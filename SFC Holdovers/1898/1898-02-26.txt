WASHINGTON, Feb. 24.â The President
fully realizes the great importance of the
situation and of what might be the conse
quences in case the Board of Inquiry finds
that the Maine was blown up by some overt
act. To that end the administration is
making all necessary preparations for any
contingency.
NEW YORK, Feb. 25.â A Washington special
says: The Herald's Havana dispatches this morning
have convinced Congress as well as the administration
that there is no longer any doubt the Maine was destroyed
by the explosion of a mine beneath her keel. Members
of both houses discussed this development to-day and the
question as to what reparation the United States ought to
demand from Spain. It was evident from the discussion
that the administration may have difficulty in satisfying
Congress with any basis of settlement involving merely
monetary consideration, unless it is accompanied by in
formation that the Spanish Government has tried and
executed the persons responsible for the disaster.
There are conservative men in both houses who advise
standing by the administration and consenting to settle
ment by the payment of heavy indemnity, and these
conservative men include some of the most influential
leaders in both houses. When it comes to a test these
men of influence and conservatism will probably be able
to restrain Congress from taking the matter out of the
hands of the President and passing a declaration of war,
but just now there is considerable belligerent talk.
Up to the present time the House Committee on
Foreign Relations has stood by the President without
wavering through all his Cuban policy, and it is therefore
significant that those members of that committee with
whom I talked to-day, without exception, are inclined to
think that a money indemnity will not satisfy Congress
or the people of the United States. These gentlemen
will not be quoted by name, as the matter may come be
fore their committee in some way, and they do not wish
to commit themselves publicly in advance of official in
formation, but their views can be summarized as being
that if the Maine was blown up by a mine under control
of the military authorities of Spain it was a prima facie
â¢ act of war and that the burden of proof is upon Spain to
show that it was not.
The opinion is that a mere disavowal will not be
enough to satisfy the United States, that it was not a
hostile act, but that as some one in the Spanish service

WASHINGTON, Feb. 25.â
One of the results of the Cab
inet meeting to-day was that
Secretary Long wrote and will
send to Chairman. Boutelle of
the House Naval Committee
to-morrow a letter asking for
legislation authorizing the
enlistment of 1500 additional
men for the navy. This num
ber of men will enable the de
partment to place in commis
sion the double turreted mon
itor Miantonomoh and the
triple screw cruisers Minne
apolis and Columbia, all of
which vessels are now in re

Yard.
The regular annual naval

pleted by the House Commit

additional men, but if Con

recommendation he will not
wait for the passage of that
bill for more men.
was responsible for the mines
in Havana harbor it is the
duty of Spain to speedily fix
the responsibility and exe
cute the criminals.
Whether Spain will pay
the heavy indemnity that
will be demanded, disavow
the act and execute its per-
petrators is a matter about
which the members of the
I committee are doubtful.
1 Men are beginning to speak
plainly about the possibility
of war, and Representative
Hull of lowa, chairman of
the Committee on Military
Affairs, who is a conserva
tive Republican, expressed
the average sentiment of the
House well to-day when he
said :
"It all depends upon
whether the verb 'to blow' is
active or passive. If the
Maine blew up the matter
is settled and there is noth
ing to say. If the Maine
was blown up it is war."
NEW YOBK, Feb. 25.â The Her
ald's Washington correspondent
sends the following: In the light of
the Herald's exclusive cable from
Havana this morning showing clear
ly that the Maine's keel was blown
upward, few persons in 'Washington
still cling to the theory that the de
struction of the ship was accidental.
Reluctant as they are to believe that
the terrible disaster was due to
treachery, the authorities have al
most ceased to talk about the acci
uent theory and are now discussing
what methods can be followed to de
termine just how the outside explo
sion occurred and what kind of de
mand is to be made upon Spain.
Fully appreciating the gravity of
the whole question, the President, of
course, will wait for the final con
clusion of the Court of Inquiry be
fore making a definite move.
The Cabinet devoted two and one
half hours to discussing every phase
of the question and all possible con
tingencies, even that of war, and our
condition to meet it. When the Cab
inet had adjourned, I was assured by
two of the members that there was
nothing official concerning the cause
of the disaster before the Cabinet be
yond what had already been made
public, and that the President and all
of his advisers are waiting for the
resort of the Court of In&uiry before
SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1898.
expressing any opinion officially.
They all continue to urge patience on
the part of the public until all pos
sible evidence be obtained and sooer
ly considered.
The only result of the Cabinet
meeting may be said to be this: No
efforts are to be spared to ascertain
the cause of the disaster in Havana
harbor and in the meantime the
United States is to be prepared for
any eventuality. Proceeding on the
assumption that the report of the
Court of Inquiry will show that the
Maine was blown up by some ex
terior agency, the Cabinet discussed
the possibility of getting further evi
dence to determine the exact charac
ter of that agency. There is no doubt,
as previously stated in the Herald,
that if the report of th* Court of In
quiry shows an outside explosion,
Spain will be held responsible wheth
er the exact character of the explo
sion is fully determined or not. Much
will depend, however, upon whether
the disaster occurred through the
medium of a torpedo, a mine, or
some other implement of war under
the control of the Spanish Govern
ment, in fixing the degree of respon
sibility.
It is for this reason that every
possible effort will be made to ascer
tain the real cause, although the dif
ficulty of getting exact evidence as
to the character of the explosion is
fully appreciated. The authorities
have been discussing the possibility
of getting at the exact conditions by
building a cofferdam around the for
ward part of the ship.
Mr. Cramp, the well-known ship
builder, has expressed the opinion
that this will be necessary in order
to raise the wreck and the question
is being discussed whether, if this
were done, any signs of a mine could
be discovered. All of this, of course,
would take* time, but if it ga^e any
promise of establishing a definite re
sult the President, in his desire to
judicially examine and carefully
weigh every scrap of evidence that
can he obtained, would be willing to
forego his final conclusion until it
could be done.
Once he is thoroughly convinced
that an implement of war under con
trol of the Spanish Government
caused the disaster it can be definite
ly stated that the President will
make a demand upon Spain which
will satisfy the American people, and
without positive evidence as to the
exact character of the outside explo
sion it is fully the purpose of the ad-
ministration to hold Spain respon
sible.
The nature of the demand to be
made upon Spain was one of the ques
tions discussed at to-day's cabinet
meeting, but of course the discussion
was on more or less hypothetical
grounds. There was no disposition,
however, on the part of the admin
istration to consider the destruction
of the Maine a hostile act unless
Spain chose to make it so by her fu
ture course.
Grave as the question is, the Pres
ident did not .consider it beyond set
tlement through the medium of an
indemnity if Spain could be made to
see our demands in the proper light.
Accepting the extreme theory, that
the vessel was blown up by a mine
under the control of the Spanish Gov
ernment, the conclusion has been
reached that the most vigorous de
mand for complete reparation in the
form of indemnity, apology and the
execution of the guilty persons if
they can be found will be made. The
indemnity demanded will be large.
Administration officials yesterday
spoke of ten millions of dollars as
the least amount that could be con
sidered. Discussion at the Cabinet
meeting to-day, however, developed
the fact that the demand would be
much larger than this. The price of
the vessel will be considered a com

CopyrlÃhtPd, IK>B, by James Gordon Bennett.
HAVANA, Feb. 25.â The court of
inquiry to-night is still In Havana har
bor, but is ready to move to Key West
at a moment's notice. Instead of com
ing ashore this evening, as usual, all
the members have remained on board
the Mangrove. Whether or not any
evidence will be taken here to-morrow
is not yet certain, but it is reasonably
safe to state that Monday's opening ses
sion will be held at Key West.
To-day the court's time was devoted
almost exclusively to hearing the re
ports of the Navy Department divers.
One or two other witnesses were heard,
but their stories were of little impor
tance.
Greater reserve than ever was ob
served as to the character of the testi
i mony elicited from the divers, but there
is no reason to believe that anything
was learned to-day to alter materially
the testimony already taken from simi
lar sources.
One of the gratifying results of to
day's submarine work was the recovery
in comparatively good condition of the
' paymaster's safe, containing about
$25,000. This Was accomplished by
divers of the naval vessels here this
afternoon.
Great interest is felt here in the ex
pected arrival of the Vizcaya, and it is
not unlikely that her arrival may be
made the occasion for some sort of
spontaneous demonstration of Spanish
patriotism.
The cruiser Alfonso XIII was towed
by tugs to-day from her previous moor
ings near the wreck of the Maine to a
point about half a mile further up the
harbor in order to make room for Cap
tain Eulate's vessel.
Commercial circles express unusual
interest in a brief dispatch in local pa
pers here to-day announcing an un
usual fall in stocks in Wall street, and
there have been many inquiries for fur
ther particulars.

CAPTAIN SIGSBEE KNEW
OF THE SHIP'S DANGER.
1898, by James Gordon Bennett
NEW YORK, Feb. 25.â A Key West (Fla.) special to the
Herald says private advices received by steamer from Ha
vana to-day state that despite Spanish opposition the two
American divers employed by the naval authorities on the
wreck of the 111-fated Maine, while pretending to be engaged
solely in the work of rescuing the bodies and the effects of the
officers and men from the hold, have obtained evidence that
proves beyond a doubt that the Maine was blown up from the
outside. The divers have been before the Board of Inquiry
and, while the sessions are held in secret, enough has come
out to create the impression that their testimony reveals the
fact that the Maine was blown up by a submarine mine.
Captain Sigsbee, it is said, was aware of the fact that his
ship had been moored over a mine and had so notified the au
thorities at Washington and had also informed them that
the bottom of Havana harbor was a perfect network of tor
pedoes, a buoy marking the spot where each was located.
The harbor, it is alleged, was so protected by torpedoes at
the time when belligerency talk became rampant in Congress.
The mines are connected with electrical wires and are worked
by a keyboard located in the arsenal in the navy-yard.
The impression prevails in Havana that the mine was ex
ploded by some friend of the Weyler administration with a
view of injuring the Blanco Government.
ments of some of the Maine's boats,
smashed sea-chests and a ton or more of
other debris. Captain Sigsbee has no
more use for this rubbish, and as his vis
itor was departing Captain Sigsbee,
through the lieutenant, requested that
the Spanish admiral would kindly dis
pose of this accumulated rubbish.
"Have it burned," said the captain,
"or give it to Havana's poor for kin
dling wood."
The lieutenant promised, the two offi
cers saluted with courteous smiles, and
the Spaniard walked down the gangway
to his boat.
Almost beneath his feet as he stood
on the deck the Naval Board had again
resumed its probing of. the problem be

to-day to recover all the bodies still

sent ashore for lumber and preparations
made to construct a float, from which
the divers were to get to work imme

work has won him golden opinions
alike from Americans and Spanish, is
most anxious to recover the last of the

The wreckers' assistants were ready in
their boat and a detachment was waiting
on the black bodied death barge that
floats near the Fern.
The chaplain learned, however, that at
4 o'clock it would be impossible to get
the lumber in time to get to work to
night, so he was rowed ashore dissap

face his task of ministering to the few
injured survivors who still remain un

Lientenant-Commander Wainwright

be constructed early to-morrow, and be

of the forward six-inch magazine and

NOW GETTING THE ARMY AND NAVY
BOSTON IS AT
THE MERCY OF
THE SPANIARDS
Secretary Long Urged by Massa
chusetts Congressmen to Send
a Warship to Protect
the Harbor.
â¢ BOSTON, Feb. 25.â 1n the interests of Boston the Boston Traveller
to-day sent the following telegram to every Massachusetts representa
tive in Congress:
"To allay the anxiety of a million citizens of Boston and vicinity
will you urge Secretary Long to order a warship to the protection of
Boston's nearly defenseles harbor? TOREY E. WARDNER,
Boston, Mass., Feb. 25, 1898. "Manager Boston Traveller."
The Traveller says: "Boston is unprotected in case of war. A war
ship is needed at once to defend the city and harbor. A single Span
ish warship could in a single day destroy the city. Not a single effect
ive means of defense is at hand. An enemy's ship-of-war could shell
the city from outside Boston Light. The harbor defenses could do but
little in return. A United States warship should be stationed off the
approaches to Boston harbor. Experts say that here is where the real
stand in defense of Boston harbor would be made. It is absolutely
necessary that the Navy Department send a, battle-ship to protect the
harbor, especially outside Boston lightship. The nearest American
warship to Boston is now in New York harbor, and Boston is practical
ly defenseless, notwithstanding the fact that there are powerful bat
teries scattered about inside the harbor. The lightship is only eight
miles from the wharves, so that it is possible for a Spanish vessel to
throw shells from outside and cause irreparable damage to property
and a great loss of life. The batteries at Winthrop, situated about
six or seven miles from Boston Light, would only be able to protect
the inner harbor. The mortars would throw shells about on the out
side without any definite range. Fort Warren and the guns that are
now being placed on the extreme end of Long Island would also pro
tect the inner harbor to a great extent and prevent foreign vessels
from running through the Narrows Into President Roads. t The guns at
both places could be trained upon any vessel making such an attempt
with sreat success. As far as the inside harbor is concerned, Boston is
in a fairly good condition to meet a foe. but the whole trouble will be
experienced in moving battle outside the light. The fact that the
city is unprotected within ten miles of the wharves is giving business
men in this city much concern. The average range of the Spanish
warship guns is about ten miles. One of her vessels by maneuvering
about could keep discharging shells with terrible effect upon the city
of Boston. There is no question in the minds of a majority of Boston
men, who know the harbor thoroughly, that the matter is an ex
tremely serious one. Some action should be taken immediately to
have at least one war vessel on or around Boston or within a few
hours' sail of the harbor. It is not impossible for a Spanish warship
to make its appearance suddenly in the harbor. It could demand a
nation's ransom from wealthy Boston."
How a single man escaped alive from
beneath that towering pile of crushed
iron and steel is marvelous, yet Shea, a
coal passer, was down in the berth
deck, in the very bowels of the doomed
ship, when the explosion occurred.
Two other decks were between him and
the stars.
"How ever did you escape. Shea?"
Chaplain Chadwick asked him the other
day.
"Indeed, I can't say, your Reverence," i
said Shea. I knew nothinsr till I found
myself swimming, but in faith I think,
asking your Reverence's flardon, that I
must be an armor-piercing projectile."

paratively minor matter as compared
with the demand for indemnification
of the Government for the slaughter
of its officers and seamen. The least
figure now talked about is twenty
five million dollars.
The. possibility of Spain complying
with the demands of the United
States was also a subject of discus
sion. This, the authorities all con
sider, is the real danger point in the
controversy. If a cfash comes be
tween the two countries over the
Maine disaster, it is now generally
considered that it will be over Spain's
refusal to make prompt compliance
with the President's demands.
It will necessarily be some days
before this point is reached and in
the meantime there may be some un
foreseen contingency to provoke a
rapture in our relations with Spain
before there is chance for a settle
ment of the Maine catastrophe
through the medium of diplomacy.
The authorities earnestly hope
that no such emergency may arise
and that Spain -will be quick to make
reparation for the terrible loss the
United States has suffered, but as a
part of prudence no one can deny
that the administration is fully alive
to the possibilities of the situation
and that preparations are going on
for any emergency.
TELEGRAPH OPERATORS
ORDERED TO FLORIDA.
The Government Is Covering Every
Point Along the Threat
ened Coast.
NEW YORK. Feb. 25.â Twenty-seven
telegraph operators have been sent to
Key West during the last two days by
the Western Union Company. The os
tensible purpose of sending so many op
erators to that point is to handle in
creased matter that is coming from Ha
vana. That this purpose is not the real
one 1b obvious from the fact that there
are not enough wires at Key West to
give employment to so many operat
ors. There are only two submarine
wires from Key West north to Jack
sonville, Fla. Ten operators are more
than sufficient to handle all matter sent
over those wires. What, then, Is the
object of sending so many men to a
point where they cannot but be in the
way of one another?
The reply comes from Washington
In the way of an official utterance by
an official who Is qualified to know.
"The Government," says the person, i
â¢"has realized that something may
break loose at any moment now be
tween the United States and Spain,
and, in order not to be caught napping,
13 covering every important point
along the Florida coast. About 150
telegraph operators have been ordered
to these points, and those sent during
the last two days were the advance
guard of that number."

HENRY CLAY CORBIN, the New Adjutant General
United States Army.
The President has nominated Colonel Henry Clay Corbin to be adjutant
general of the army, to succeed General Samuel Breck, who was retired
yesterday on account of age. General Corbin is a native of Ohio and en
tered the volunteer service at the age of is. For gallant and meritorious
services during the war he was promoted through the various grades to the
rank of brevet brigadier general. He participated with his regiment in all
its marches, campaigns and engagements, including the battles of Pulaski
Decatur and Nashville. On the 11th of May, 1866, he was appointed second
lieutenant in the Seventeenth Infantry; in July of the same year he was an
pointed captain in the Thirty-eighth Infantry, and in November 1869 he was
transferred tp the Twenty-fourth Infantry. On June 16. 1880, General Cor
bin was appointed major and assistant adjutant general. General Corbin
has served on the staffs of Generals Henry J. Hunt. Schofield, Terry Crook
and Miles. His huge frame, erect carriage and handsome face are familiar
to every one who has seen him at the head of Presidential inaugural pro
cessions and other great parades. He was with President Garfleld when he
was shot, and- was at his bedside at his death. General Corbin is one of the
youngest brigadier generals in the army, as he will not reach the age of re
tlrement until September, 1906.

That the Government
Is Preparing for the
Worst Is Evident.
Transportation Facilities an
Important Factor in the
Arrangements.
Railroad and Coal Companies Offered
Bonuses for Making Prompt
Deliveries.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PITTSBURG. Feb. 25.â The Post to
morrow will say: That the United
States Government is preparing to
meet any exigency that may arise by
reason of the investigation of the Maine
disaster is beyond dispute, and the fact
that the proper authorities have just
placed contracts for the delivery of
300,000 tons of coal at the different
coaling stations of the war vessels of
this country in the West Indies and
along the Florida coast is further evi
dence that the Washington authori
ties see the trouble with Spain in sight
and are getting ready to meet the is
sue squarely.
It was learned in Plttsburg through
an officer of one of the largest coal cor
porations doing business in this dis
trict that the Navy Department had
closed contracts with the incorporated
firm of Gaster. Curoan & Billett of
Philadelphia for the delivery at Key
West, Sand Keys, Dry Tortugas, Sa
vannah, Charleston and Fortress
Monroe of 250,000 tons of Pocahontas
coal and with the Rhodes & Birdler
Coal Company of Cleveland for the de
livery of 50,000 tons of the Goshen coal
of that company.
The stipulations of the contracts just
placed are that the coal so ordered
shall be delivered at the designated
coaling stations as soon as it is possi
ble to do so, and that the utmost se
crecy be observed about the matter.
In carrying out these contracts the
railroads play a most prominent part,
and for the purpo.se of moving every
thing as expeditiously as possible
President N. E. Ingalls of the Ches
apeake and Ohio Railroad, Charles G.
Murray of the Baltimore and Ohio,
and General Manager L. F. Loree of
the Pennsylvania went to Washing
ton and consulted with Secretary Long
of the Navy and Assistant George D.
Meiklejohn of the War Department on
the matter. Contracts and all ar
rangements for the rapid handling of
the coal were made, and the Govern
ment, it is understood, is to pay a
bonus to both the coal miners and the
railroads if the 300,000 tons are de
livered within a specified time.

XEW YORK. F*b. 25.â A Topeka
(Kans.) special to the Herald says:
W. J. Bryan, who came to Topeka to
attend the annual banquet of the Kan
sas Democracy, is quoted by the To
peka State Journal to-night on the
Spanish situation as follows: "In my
opinion we should be slow to act in the
Maine affair, especially under the try
ing circumstances which confront us.
Another fact which in my mind impels
to exercise discretion in that official in
vestigation of the explosion is now
being made. The United States cannot
afford to be too hasty in this matter.
International questions are involved
and it would be a sad compliment to
our Government were we to openly
and maliciously bring about strained
relations by cur anxiety to locate the
responsibility of the Maine disaster.
"The proper policy in my mind is for
the United States Government to care
fully investigate the disaster, and, if
evidence tending to attach the respon
sibility where the people assert it prop
erly belongs, is found, then will it be
time for such action to be taken. Un
due haste at this time might involve us
in a disastrous conflict for which there
is no just cause. Let us find out first
where we are at, so to speak, and then
proceed in a proper direction and in a j
right manner. Nothing should be done
until th* investigation is completed."
Asked what he thought Â«theoutcome j
of the crisis would be, so far as it re- |
lated to a possible conflict with Spain, |
Mr. Bryan said:
"Politically or otherwise, the patriot- j
ism of the American people has never ;
been appealed to in vain. Don't you
think this correct?" he said, turning to
Judge A. M. Jackson, who stood near.
"Of course it is," said Judge Jack
son. "If there is war w e know who will
get licked, and it won't be the t'nited
States, either."
"Certainly we can lick them." said
Mr. Bryan as he turned to greet a del

He says he knows that other officers
have received similar orders.
Lieutenant Davidson was absent on
a special leave to perfect an inven

Burned Sugar in His Furnaces.
VICTORIA, Feb. 25.â The British steam
ship Algonla, Captain Davis, arrived in
Esquimau harbor early this morning,
thirty-five days from Java, with a cargo

of the trip, which was rough, the Algonia
ran short of coal, and Captain Davis, in
order to make port, fed the furnace from

CABINET MEN
NOW GRAVE
President and Advisers
Realize th.c Serious
Situation*
At Their Meeting They Talked
Over the Prospect of War
With Spain.
When the Report of the Board of
Inquiry Is Received Decisive
Steps Will Be Taken.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office. Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. 25.
After the Cabinet meeting to-day
Secretary Long said to The Call corre
spondent:
"There was a calm and deliberate
'discussion of Cuban affairs, growing
out of the Maine's explosion, but there
was no excitement, of course, and not
much anxiety expressed by any of the
President's advisers. In fact, the Presi
dent and several members of the Cabi
net smoked while they talked."
The fact that the President and sev
eral of his advisers "smoked while they
talked" may not be important in itself,
but Secretary Long seemed to think
that the publication of this fact would
go a long way toward allaying popu
lar excitement, and that the tobacco
burned by the President and his Cabi
net might be soothing to the public at
large. The public will not have to wait
much longer to learn the official opin
ion of the Maine disaster.
The President and Cabinet believe
that they will know the verdict of the
court of inquiry by Wednesday or
Thursday of next week.
That was probably the most interest
ing opinion resulting from the delibera
tions of the official directors of the
Government at their session to-day.
Every member of the Cabinet sur
rounded President McKinley when the
hour arrived for the Cabinet to meet.
The gravity of the situation is fully
recognized by every member and the
talk was along lines which cool-headed
statesmen take when emergency con
fronts them.
"Not a new fact was brought out."
said several members of the Cabinet
to The Call representative, but in con-
versation later each of these officials
manifested more anxiety than was cvi-
dent at the Cabinet session last Friday,
when every member expressed the
opinion that the explosion was an ac-
cident. The facts which are daily de
veloping, although unofficial, are mak
ing impressions upon the minds of the
big men who guide the administration.
The officials who a week ago. were con
fident of the accident theory have to
day made up their minds that they
may have to change their opinions be
fore a great while. It is said by one of
the President's closest friends that he
continues to hold the view that it was
an accident, but will be governed by
the report of the board of Inquiry.
MARINES ALWAYS
HELD IN READINESS.
Colonel Heywood, Commandant of
the Corps, Prepared for all
Emergencies.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 25.â Colonel
Heywood, commandant of the United
States Marine Corps, said to The Call
correspondent to-night:
"I have received no orders to send
a company of marines to Key West
nor do I look for any. I understand'
however, that a detachment of marines
has been sent from Fort McPherson to
man the guns at Key West, in the line
TROOPS IN THE
SOUTH GETTING
READY TO MOVE
General Merritt Visits Fort Mc-
Pherson, and the Regulars
Receive Orders for
the Future.
NEW YORK, Feb. 25.â An Atlanta (Ga.) special to the Herald
says: General Wesley Merritt visited Fort McPherson and viewed
the Fifth Infantry to-day. A salute of thirteen guns was fired in his
honor and the usual official ceremony was observed. Afterward Gen
eral Merritt inspected the post. He was very guarded in his remarks
to reporters, saying that his orders absolutely forbid at this time a
discussion of matters connected with the army. He said his opinion
as an individual formed at first was that the explosion on the Maine
was an accident, and he had seen nothing to cause a change in that
opinion. He leaves here to-night fÂ«r Savannah to inspect the fortifi
cations there, and goes thence to Key West and to other points on the
coast.
There are many reports as to the probable movement of troops
from Atlanta to the coast. Private soldiers are talking a good deal
and think they are going, but the officers say they have received no
orders to that effect. Colonel Cook has received an order cautioning
him to take extra care of ammunition, and as reported to the Herald
Wednesday, an order was received last Tuesday to hold two companies
in readiness to proceed at a moment's notice to Key West.
The arrival of General Merritt yesterday afternoon was regarded as
especially significant at this time, and as he went in secret conference
with officers of the post it was currently reported in the barracks last
night that orders to man the coast defenses would be promulgated to
day.
No orders to move have been made, however, though eight or ten
companies are now under special detail to be in complete readiness for
such orders should conditions make them necessary. Accordingly
Colonel Cook's conference with railroatl officials yesterday was with a
view to moving his men. With reference to the statement that the
railroads in the Southeast have filed with the War Department esti
mates.as to the number of men and munitions of war they could move
in a given time it develops to-day that these estimates were asked
for nine months ago, and secrecy was then cautioned by the depart
ment. The president of one of the largest railroads in the South, who
for this very reason declined to let his name be used, said to me to
day: "The War Department has in detail all information as to the
movement of troops, not only from Atlanta, but from all Southeastern
forts. Blanks were sent out nine months ago to railroad managers. I
received one. My blank referredto the movement of troops only to
the Atlantic and Gulf ports. We gave the information carefully, and
I presume it is on file at Washington."
of coast defenses that have taken the
attention of the department for some
time past."
When a Call representative arrived at
the marine barracks two companies ol
marines were on the drill ground prac
ticing the foreign movements. ''That
looks rather warlike, colonel," was
said. Â
â¢'Yes; to the uninitiated that would
look as if war had been declared, but
that is but a daily. routine drill. Those
two companies are recruits and are
going through their regular daily prac
tice.
"How many marines are notv- sta
tioned in Washington?"
"Four companies. Two are stationed
down at the navy-yard and the other
two, which are composed mostly of re
cruits, are stationed here"
"In the event of an emergency how
soon would the marine corpri be pre
pared to move?"
"Within ten minutes. I always
keep the men ready. So frequently we
are called on for parades and escort
duty that I have made it a rule to be
ready all the time."
"Do you anticipate any trouble?"
"I cannot say that I do. I have no
orders to send any marines anywhere.
When the fleet sailed it carried its full
complement."
MONITOR TERROR
IN HAMPTON ROADS.
At the Navy Department It Is Said
the Vessel Has No Definite
Orders.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 25.â The moni
tor Terror is lying in Hampton Roads,
and it is said at the Navy Department
that she has no orders as yet. The im
pression is that she will remain in that
place, which is of great strategic value
in case of need, at least until the moni
tor Puritan is ready to take her place.
The Puritan is almost as big as the
Terror, being a 6000-ton vessel, very
little less than the Maine in size.
She carries 12-inch guns in her tur
rets, against 10-inch guns for the Ter
ror, and i 3 altogether the most formid
able double-turroted monitor in the
world in smooth water. This qualifi
cation does not mean that she s un
able to go to sea, but only that from
her great breadth and light draught
she is so susceptible to the wave mo
tion that It is difficult to make good
work with her guns in a seaway.
She is now having new furnaces fitted
to her boilers at the Norfolk Navy
Yard, the crowns of the furnaces hav
ing come down some time ago, owing t-j
the fact that the boilers are the same
that were built for her when she waa
originally laid down many years ago.
It is said at the Navy Department
that she will be ready for service on
March 4.
SAYS HAVANA HAS NO
SUBMARINE DEFENSE.
Spanish Minister Dubosc Declares
There Are No Mines in
the Harbor.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 25.â 1n view of
the widely published report that the
harbor of Havana contained a system
of submarine mines, a statement
around which has centered the chief
public Interests in connection with the
Maine disaster, Senor Dubosc, Spanish
Charge d 1d 1 Affairs at Washington, to
night made to the Associated Press the
following statement, which, coming
from such a source, may be considered
as an official denial:
"I wish to state, on my own official
knowledge, that no mine exists inside
or outside of Havana Harbor; nor is
there any submarine defense of any
kitid. The report is so absolutely false
and ridiculous that it could only have
originated in the minds of those per
sons anxious to incite the evil passions
of both nations for their own miserable
ends. I consider the very suggestion of
such a thing an insult to Spain."
Dupuy De Lome Yet Talks.
LIVERPOOL, Feb. 25.â Senor Dupuy
de Lome, who arrived here to-day on
the White Star line steamer Britannic,
is quoted as saying in an interview: "I
have decided not to speak on the sub
ject of my letter to Senor Canalejas.
I can say, however, that I have been
from the first the victim of misrepre
sentation.
"The news published in the American
papers and sent to this country and
my own was, from beginning to end,
made up of lies of the most infamous
character. The allegation in the
American papers that the terrible ex
plosion of the Maine was the outcome
of a Spanish conspiracy is, in my opin
ion, another instance of the reckless
manner in which newspapers in Amer
ica work upon popular prejudice."
PRECAUTIONS TAKEN
AT WILLETS POINT
The East River Entrance to New
York Is Now Being Made
invulnerable
NEW YORK, Feb. 25.â The Brooklyn
Eagle to-day says: At Willets Point
precaution is being taken to make the
East River entrance to New York in
vulnerable. A so-called skirmish line
of torpedoes is projected from the Wil
lets Point shore across the channel to
Fort Schuyler. The torpedoes will be
anchored so close together that it may
be made impossible for a hostile vessel
to cross the line without being blown
up. The torpedoes will be connected
with electric wires, and to make doubly
sure that their plans cannot be frus
trated the engineers have arranged to
have batteries located at each
end of the line so that in case an
apparatus was used by the enemy to
sever the connecting wires and break
the circuit, the torpedoes still could
be exploded from either end of the
line. The channel is already protect
ed from the Willets Point shore to
the center of the channel by two
groups of submarine mines. Each
group of the mines consists of twenty
two torpedoes, the forty-four together
containing 1200 pounds of giant pow
der.
At Fort Schuyler, directly opposite
Willets Point, considerable engineer
ing work has been done. A torpedo
magazine and experimenting gallery
was recently completed. It is con
sidered the strongest magazine on any
United States fortification.

PLANS OF
NAVAL MEN
FOR WAR
Important Steps Ordered
by Assistant Secre=
tary Roosevelt.
One of the Most Interesting
Matters Is the Preparation
of Auxiliary Cruisers
for Hostilities.
NEW YORK, Feb. 25.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Emer
gency preparations of the most import
ant character yet attempted by the
Navy Department were formally de
cided upon to-day and necessary orders
carrying them out were issued by Chief
Acting Secretary Roosevelt. These pre
parations include:
Firstâ Orders to vessels In different
parts of the world, looking to their bet
ter strategic disposition.
Second â Shipment of guns and
mounts for auxiliary cruisers from
the Washington foundry to the New
York Navy Yard, where in a few hours
they can be placed on board vessels of
the International Navigation Company,
Columbia Steamship Company, Red
"D" Steamship Company, and New
York and Cuba Mail Steamship Com
pany.
Third â Collection? of stores and com
pletion of repairs to cruisers Minne
apolis and Columbia, monitor Mianto
non>oh and ram Katahdin.
Fourthâ Shijunt-nt to works of the
Herreshoffs of torpedo tubes and appli
ances and torpedoes for the torpedo
boats Talbot and Gwin, which will
shortly undergo their steam trials.
The authorities have given up all idea
of keeping secret the preparations
which are being made, and while de
clining to go into the details as to or
ders which are being given, it is gen
erally known what steps are being
taken to put the country in condition
to meet any emergency that may arise.
It has not been denied that orders have
been issued to vessels which entail
their movements to different points,
but what vessel? are affected and
where they go are questions which the
department officials decline to answer.
As the Herald has stated, the Asiatic
squadron is assembling at Hongkong,
f>oo miles away from the Philippines. It
is generally believed that before decis
ive action is taken by the administra
tion the cruiser San Francisco and
gunboats Bancroft and Helena will be
ordered home, it being appreciated that
these vessels would not be effective
against the armored cruisers of the
Spanish navy. The cruiser Cincinnati
and gunboat Castine will probably re
main at the Barbadoes until the arrival
of the Brooklyn at Santa Lucia, sixty
miles away, when Captain F. C. Cooke,
commanding the armored cruiser, will
communicate with Captain C. M. Ches
ter, senior officer commanding the Cin
cinnati and the Castine, and these three
vessels will then probably proceed to
La Guayra. where they will join the
gunboats Wilmington, Vicksburg and
Annapolis.
Quite a large number of guns and
mounts for auxiliary cruisers will be
chipped, commencing to-morrow, to the
Brooklyn Navy Yard. There are now
available for auxiliary cruisers forty
nine 4-inch, forty o-inch and forty-one
6-inch guns. There is also on hand
a large number of six and one pounder
guns and machine guns. The Herald
showed several days ago that the St.
Paul, St. Louis, New York and Paris
would require forty 6-inch guns, twenty
6-pounders and sixteen machine guns.
It is evident that these vessels could be
transformed into auxiliary cruisers
without delay.
The Advance and Alliance of the Co
lumbia Steamship Company will re
quire twelve 5-inch and twelve ma
chine guns. Twenty-eight 5-inch guns
would thus be left, and eight of these
would be placed on board the Segur
ance, Vigilencia and Concho. A total
of eighty 4-inch guns will be needed to
equip the remaining vessels which
would be available for duty as auxil
iary cruisers, forty-nine of which will
be shipped to New York. The gun
foundry is now assembling a number
of 4-inch guns, and it is expected that
within the next few months forty-five
guns of this caliber will be ready for
service.
For six and four inch guns for aux- :
iliary cruisers the department designed
some months ago a pedestal mount.
Sixty-six four-inch and twenty-seven
five-inch guns were reported as com
pleted some months ago, at which time
forty-five were being pushed to com- |
pletion. The Columbia and Minneapo
lis are commerce-destroyers. They
have been in reserve for some months,
the idea being when they are assigned
that they could be got ready and !
I'lared in commission in ten days. Their !
stores have been assembled and are
now ready to be placed on board. This
will probably be done, so when the de- i
partment directs that they be placed
in commission all that will be neces
sary for officers and crew is to go
aboarcl.
The monitor Miantonomoh, which is
also at League Island, has been re
paired, and minor repairs required will
be made as rapidly as possible. Like
the Terror, she has a displacement of
3990 tons. The ram Katahdin, which
was placed in ordinary some months
ago, is also in need of some minor re
pairs. These will be completed as
quickly as possible, her stores will be
assembled, and, like other ships at
Lejurue Island, she will be put in condi
tlon to go to sea Just as soon as her
officers and men may arrive on board.
The Katahdin is the only representa
tive of her type in the world, her prin
cipal arm of defense being her ram.
There have been a number of applica
tions made to the department by offi-
cers of the commander rank desiring to
be assigned to her in case of war. Com
mander G. H. H. Wilde being especially
desirous of receiving this billet. The
Navy Department was informed some
days ago that the torpedo boats Tai
bot and Gwin had been launched and
would undergo their stem trials in a
few days. The Talbot and Gwin are
small boats equipped with two torpedo
tubes. Lieutenant Commander T. C.
McLean, in charge of the torpedo sta
tion at Newport, has been directed to
ship to the works of the Herreshoffs
torpedo tubes and appliances and tor
pedoes for the Gwin and Talbot so that
these vessels can be placed in commis
sion immediately upon the conclusion
of their steam trials.
The department has prepared a cir
cular letter, which will be sent as a re
ply to hundreds of men who are desir
ous of entering the naval service in the
event of war. This let,ter states that
applications will be placed on file and
the candidates for enlistment will be
called upon if needed.
AMERICANS IN HAVANA
ARE GREATLY ALARMED.
They Fear an Outbreak During a Big
Demonstration to Be Held
Sunday.
NEW YORK, Feb. 27.â A special
cable to a morning paper from Havana
says: Americans in Havana are
alarmed to-day over the probability of
an outbreak. There is serious trouble
brewing and the Spanish authorities
are alarmed. Yesterday was an excit
ing day. The Spanish vessel Monte
video arrived and anchored within a
pebble's throw from the wreck of the
Maine.
The Montevideo brought from Spain
a thousand soldiers. When the Span
is-h soldiery learned of the appalling
disaster to the Maine they could not
refrain from displaying their joy.
The wreckers and marines engaged in
the ghastly work of recovering the
bodies were compelled to listen to cold
blooded taunts and sneers.
"Death to Americans," was the yell.
Later when the officers of the palace
visited the Montevideo there was a
such exclamation.
The soldiers were marched to the
Prado and later to the Castle of Prin
cipe, where they were supplied with
rations.
A few days ago it was said at the
palace the soldiers were to be pushed
into the interior at once. Doubtless
this was Blanco's intention then, but
conditions have changed.
There is to be a big demonstration
in Havana on Sunday, and the cap
tain-general will' retain his troops in
the city. The demonstration to be
held Sunday has been on foot for more
than a month.
The efforts of Blanco to- crush it out
by commands and threats have proved
fruitless.
The element which is opposed to au
tonomy and which favors the bringing
back of Weyler is growing all the time.
It proposes to be heard, and heard it
will be on Sunday. That is why Blan
co has retained the sc-ldiers.
The autonomist party has ben split
and the so-called Radical wing has re
organized and formed a new plan of
autonomy. This plan is that Spanish
troops be withdrawn from the island
and the insurgent army who hold rank
and title be recognized as leaders in
what shall be known as the colonial
militia. This plan is the cause of a
great protest on the part of many
Spaniards.
It- is felt in Havana to-day on the
part of Conservatives that Sunday's
demonstration is the beginning of a
studied movement to depose Blanco.
General Arolas. tho military Governor
of Havana, whose military strength as
sisted in promptly crushing out the last
demonstration, is in the hands of weak
er leaders in whom the foreign consuls
have lost confidence.
Sicard Yet in Charge.
KEY WEST, Fla., Feb. 25-Com
mander Clifford H. West, thief of Ad
miral Sicard's staff, sailed on the Mas
cotte to-day for Havana. When asked
the purpose of his visit to Havana he
replied: "I cannot say anythin for
publication.
Rear Admiral Sicard is still in charge
of the fleet, which with the exception
of the New York and lowa, remains at
the Dry Tortugas.
The New York and lowa lie off this
harbor. The admiral says to-night
that he expected to be there soon, and
he looked much improved. The ad
miral expects the Marblehead and the
Detroit on Sunday, hut says the fleet
will not be brought in a body to this
harbor.
No Extra Powder Ordered.
SANTA CRUZ, Feb. 25.â Although
war rumors are prevalent there are
no indications at the California Pow
der Works here of any orders being re
ceived for an increased output of Gov
ernment powder. The works are en
gaged in filling the usual contract for
powder for the Government.

hundred tons of sporting and blasting

At the works there are three big guns
used for testing purposes. One is three

MEMBERS OF A GUN
CLUB AS VOLUNTEERS.
Five Hundred Sharpshooters Proffer
Their Assistance to the
Government.
NEW YORK, Feb. 25.â The prospect
of war with Spain is stirring the people
in Port ' Chester and other villages in
Weschester County. The war spirit is
so strong that two volunteer military
companies are being formed, which will
tender their assistance to the Govern
ment in case war really does come.
The Port Chester company is already
200 strong. At Rye a company of rifle
rangers is organizing.
Port Chester was more keenly
shocked at the disaster to the Maine
because Newell Rising Jr., a young
man popular in the village, was one
of the victims.
Rising's father is a prominent mem
ber of Charles Lawrence G. A. R. post
of this village. The post met last night
and passed resolutions of eulogy on
the dead sailor and of condolence to
his famtly. It was decided to erect a
granite shaft to young Newell Rising's
memory on the post plot in Rye ceme
tery.
Jeremiah Byron, president of the
Mount Vernon Gun Club, sent a letter
to the Secretary of War last night vol
unteering the services of the club, in'
all 500 accurate marksmen. To-day Mr.
Byron received a letter from Secretary
Long, thanking the gun club and stat
ing that the letter had keen duly filed
for refeVence in case of need.

Captain Field and two assistants
under the general supervision of Major
Hexie and Lieutenant Howell of the
United States Engineer Corps. A de

Bodies Cannot Be Disinterred.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 25.-The friends
of the victims of the Maine disaster
have discovered that they cannot have
their bodies brought to this country in
cases where they have already been in
terred. This is due to the fact that the
Spanish laws forbid the exhumation of
corpses until the expiration of the
period of five years ofter burial.
The prohibition had its OTigin in the
fear of infection from contagious dis
eases, pome applications have already
been made to have bodies brought to
the United States by private individ
uals, and they have encountered this
obstacle.
SIGNIFICANT
ORDERS COME
Northern National Guard
Ordered to Prepare for
Emergencies.
All Companies to Be FilledÂ»Up
and Placed on a War
Footing.
En the Event of Hostilities the Militia
Will Man the Guns at
the Forts.
Special DUpatch to The Call.
SPOKANE. Wash., Fob. 2F..âSignifi
cant orders were to-day issued from the
headquarters of the State National
Guard at Olympia for the commanders
of infantry companies to immediately
recruit their companies to their full
strength and increasing the maximum
strength of the two cavalry troops in
the State to eighty men each. The
wording of the orders follows:
1. Thecaptala of each company of infan
try in the National Guard of Washington
will proceed without d< lay to recruit his
command to its maximum strength of
sixty mllsted men.
2. Each troop of cavalry is authorized
hereby to Increase its maximum strength
from sixty to eighty enlisted men.
By order of the C'ommamler-in-Chief
Official: J. K. BALLAINK.'
Adjutant-General. .
Orders have also been issued gazet
ting new officers to fill all vacancies.
Everything is evidently being done to
put the National Guard In the best of
condition. The light battery of artil
lery stationed at Spokane has been try
ing for several years to secure modern
machine guns, and is now informed it
may secure them in the course of a
few weeks. The battery had almost
given up hope of securing them.
National Guard officers say the issu
ance of orders to recruit up to the full
authorized strength is the result of or
ders issued from the War Department
to the adjutant-general of every State
in the Union. In not all the States
have the orders been issued so far. It
is understood that General Ballaine re
ceived his orders by telegraph while in
the interior States the orders are sent
by mail. So far as can be learned from
officers of the National Guard and
army officers, plans are being prepared
under the direction of the Secretary of
War whereby the volunteer troops in
the border States will in event of war
be placed to garrison the seacoast and
other important army posts, save those
that are equipped with heavy artillery,
while the full strength of the regular
army will be mobilized on the Gulf
coast. According to an officer, the Ore
gon Guard will be called upon to garri
son Fort Vancouver and Fort Stevens,
while the Washington Guard will be
placed at Fort Townsend, now aban
doned. Magnolia Bluffs, Fort Walla
Walla and Fort Spokane, while the Ida
ho- Guard will garrison Fort Sherman
and Fort Boise Barracks in Idaho the
one in the Department of the Colum
bia, and the other in the Department of
the Platte.

matters are, at least for the present, in
a quieter state, he has withdrawn from
the Navy Department and gone away
for a few days" rest, leaving Assistant
Secretary Roosevelt to manage the de
partment.fc The latter has been thor
oughly advised at every step of the
Secretary's policy of the treatment of
the Maine affairs, so that there is not
likely to be any change in that respect
caused by the temporary assumption of
the duties of Secretary by Mr. Roose
velt.
Just before the department closed he
had word of the sailing of the cruiser
Montgomery from Tampa for Key
West. Dp to that time the vessel had
br-en given no orders, so that the date
of her departure for Havana, if she is
to go at all, is conjectural. The ship
went to Tampa instead of Key West on
her return from San Domingo, in or
der to facilitate the speedy return to
his duties in Washington of Captain
< 'nuvninshield, the chief of the Naviga
tion Bureau, who saved a full day by
the movement.
The Castine, the second of the United
States warships on the South Atlantic
station, arrived to-day at Barbadoes,
where she joined the Cincinnati. It
may be that the Castine may go to
Martinique to be docked, as she is in
need of cleaning after her trip.
WRECK OF THE MAINE
SINKING INTO THE MUD.
It Will Be Necessary to Remove Guns
and Deck Debris Before Rais
ing the Hull.
HAVANA, Feb. 25.â The wreck of the
Maine is slowly but surely sinking into
the mud. Before the hull v could be
raised it would be necessary to move
the guns and deck debris. For lack of
proper appliances practically nothing in
this line has been accomplished. Aside
from the officers' cabin effects, the sal
vage thus far has ben pitifully small.
The cloudy weather and rain made the
work of the divers unsatisfactory to
day, and very little was done. It is
said that a hole has been made by the"
divers in one of the forward hatches,
and it is hoped that a number of bodies
will be recovered.
The court of inquiry sat longer than
usual to-day, the six divers being ex
amined more in detail than heretofore.
The Spanish cruiser Alfonso XIII has
been towed to a buoy further within
the harbor to make room for the
cruiser Vizcaya. which is expected here
to-morrow or the next day from the
north.
No word has been received at tho
Consul-General's office from Mr. Bar
ker, the United States Consul at Sa
guala Grande, and it is believed that
the report of Mr. Barker's illness is
untrue. ______^_____

ZELAYA, President.
PANAMA, Feb. 25.â Telegraphic advices

provided it is guaranteed by Costa Rica
acceding to Nicaragua's just demands,
thus avoiding future trouble. Otherwise
the Government wants war. The Govern

CONTRACTS
ARE TO BE
HASTENED
Ammunition and Guns for
the Army Are in
Demand.
Quicker Deliveries of Ordnance
and Ordnance Stores Now
Required by Chiefs of
the War Department.
NEW YORK,. Feb. 25.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Pres
sure is being brought to bear by the
chief of the ordnance and the chief of
the engineers of the army on the con
tractors who are behind in the fulfill
ment of their contracts with the de
partment, and instructions have been
issued directing them to hasten partic
ularly the completion of contracts for
guns and ammunition. The work has
been progressing quite as rapidly as
practicable for months at all points
where seacoast fortifications are under
way, and the rate of progress of the
engineering work on emplacements
cannot be greatly accelerated, except
on Southern coasts, where weather con
ditions do not affect excavations and
buildings.
Quicker deliveries of ordnance and
ordnance stores are, however, possible.
It is understood that the Bethlehem
Iron Company has been asked to hasten
their deliveries of eight-inch, ten-inch
and twelve-inch guns, and the Tredegar
Iron Works of Richmond, Va., the
Rome (N. V.) Locomotive and Machine
Works and the Driggs-Seabury Ord
nance Company, to push the delivery
of shells for guns and mortars of
various caliber.
The Government gun carriage fac
tories at Rock Island, 111., and Water
town, Mass., the arsenals at Water
vleit and Frankford and Springfield
Armory have all received orders to in
crease their rate of supply. Ammuni
tion is just now the great need of the
department, and for this reason the
small arms and ammunition plant at
Frankford is expected to turn out not
less than 40.000 ball cartridges, caliber
30, for the Krug-Jorgensen army
rifle, and 20.000 miscellaneous cart
ridges, most of them of the caliber of
45, for use in Springfield rifles, only
supplied to the National Guard. Re
quisitions have also been made on the
Frankford arsenal for shrapnel, canis
ter and sights for cannon.
Ordnance officials decline to make
public the amount of ammunition now
on hand, but it is known to be so small
as to induce the department to mak
every possible effort to increase it at
the shortest notice. In the event of
an outbreak of actual hostilities
purchases of ammunition abroad
would be necessary, and is contem
plated. No anxiety is felt -with re
gard to supplying the militia with am
munition. Their small arm Spring
field rifle can easily be supplied from
private manufacturers of the Eastern
States.
The Scott Foundry at Reading, Pa.,
is working night and day in the hope
of completing by the lasx of June the
16-inch Brown segmental wire-wound
gun which it is building for the War
Department. This will be the largest
gun manufactured for the army until
the 16-inch built-up gun now building
at Watervleit is completed. The wire
gun will weigh twenty-six tons, its
muzzle velocity will be 3000 feet per
second and its muzzle energy over 35,
000 foot tons, which it is estimated
would penetrate both sides (projectile
entering on one side and going out on
the other side) of the armor plates of
a modern battleship. The gun has a
tensile strength of 150,000 pounds to the
square inch. The wire jacket, which
takes up the entire circumferential
bursting strain of the powder, has a
tensile strength of 250,000 pounds to the
square inch. The steel in the Govern
ment built gun has a tensile strength
of less than 100,000 pounds per square
inch. The calculated muzzle velocity
of the Brown segmental tube wire
wound gun is 3000 feet per second, and
the calculated muzzle energy is over
35,000 foot tons.
The muzzle energy is greater than
the muzzle energy of the Government
thirteen-inch gun, which is the largest
and most powerful gun. in the service.
The Government thirteen-inch gun
weighs fifty-one and a half tons; its
muzzle velocity is 2100 feet per second,
and its muzzle energy is 34,155 foot
tons. In the event of successful tests
of this gun it will be placed in some
important position of coast defense.
Many stories are current respecting
the plans of the War Department for
transporting troops and for conducting
a possible campaign in Cuba.* It is not
expected that tiie authorities will con
fide to the puttlic at this juncture such
plans as may have been formed in this
direction. It is a well known fact the
Quartermaster's' Department is pre
pared to furnish transportation for
large bodies of troops at the shortest
notice to the Atlantic Coast and to the
Gulf, and steamship lines have been
approached and are prepared to furnish
adequate transportation to the Cuban
coast if necessary.
The military information division,
through its various agencies, is amply
equipped to furnish a store of informa
tion and maps, and it may be said that
the army, if called into action, will not
be found unprepared for decisive work
without the loss of valuable time.

General Merritt is making his annual
inspection of the posts of his depart
ment, which includes all the States on
the Atlantic Coast and the Gulf, except
Texas, and the States east of Missis
sippi, south of the lakes, excepting In

this time will naturally have more than
ordinary importance, and is calculated
to increase the efficiency and economia
distribution of the troops of the depart
ment.
Major General Miles, commanding the
army, to-day emphatically said to ma
that reports of a rupture between him
and General Merritt on account of tha
latter officer's making public informa
tion about orders and department plans
is entirely unfounded. He said he haa
no occasion to criticize General Merritt,
and that he has his entire confidence.

PREPARE FOR
THE WORST
Conceded War Is Among
the Possibilities of the
Near Future.
Cases in Which the United States
Has Demanded and Received
Indemnity for Outrages by
Foreign Officers.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 25.â One mem
>er of the Cabinet expects the receipt
>f a report from the Court of Inquiry
it Havana about the middle of next
week. There is reason to believe that
in the meantime, and to prepare for
the reception of a report that would
show the disaster to be other than the
result of an acident, some of the offi
cials of the administration have been
looking up the subject of indemnities
so as to lay the foundation of a case,
in the event it should be decided to re
sort to that method of settlement.
There are a large number of prece
dents which will aid the authorities in
shaping their action in this direction
when the facts are fully established.
While none of the cases show the fear
ful loss of life sustained by the Maine
explosion, yet they include many in
stances in which the United States has
adopted energetic measures to redress
the killing of American citizens in for
eign countries.
In a general way these methods of
redress have included demands for in
demnity, proclamations excluding the
warships of the offending nation from
our harbors, display of force, non-in
tercourse, withdrawal of our 'Minister,
reprisal and blockade. Some of these
steps border very closely on war, al
though they are regarded as the move
ments just preliminary to actual hos
tilities, and as amounting to a threat
that force will follow if reparation is
not made.
The case of the Waterwitch is consid
ered to be the most nearly analagous to
that of the Maine. The Waterwitch was
a United States ship engaged in 1555 in
surveying the entrance to one of the
rivers of Paraguay. â  Without warning
and by orders of President Lopez of
.Paraguay a force of troops opened fire
on the Waterwitch, killing the man at
the helm. The President reported the
facts to Congress, and in his message
asked authority to make a demonstra
tion of force which would insure suit
able redress. In response to this Con
gress authorized him "to use such force
as is necessary" to secure ample rep
aration. Accordingly an armed fleet
was hastily assembled on a scale which
was regarded as remarkable for those,
days.
Th expedition included nineteen
armed ships, twenty-five heavy guns
and 2500 sailors and marines. Accom
panying this formidable outfit were ci
vilian plenipotentiaries prepared to
make the demands of the Government
and then enforce them by calling on
the armed ships. The expedition made
a formidable showing in the South
American waters and President Lopez's
Government was awed into complete
subjection by its presence. The Amer
ican Commissioners and naval officers
were received at Ascension with much
honor, and every reparation within the
power of the republic was given. This
included abject apology, a sweeping
disavowal and $10,000 for the sufferers
from the outrage. As the republic was
willing to grant full reparation the na
val expedition did not exert the force
it was prepared to use in case a refusal
had been offered.
When the facts of the expedition
were reported to the American Con
gress; the President stated that the dis
patch of this formal naval fleet had
had a salutary influence throughout the
world and had convinced foreign na
tions that the United States would pro
tect the lives of its citizens with all the
force at its command.
The case of the firing on the United
States ship Chesapeake by the British
ship Leopard is another case affording
a precedent as to the Government's
mode of action. The Chesapeake was
proceeding to sea, when she was hailed
by the commander of the Leopard
with a demand that British deserters
said to be in the hold of the Chesa
peake be surrendered. The American
commander refused to comply, where
upon the Leopard first fired a shot
across the bow of the Chesapeake, and
followed this with two broadsides. The
American commander was severely
wounded three sailors were killed out
right and many wounded. Being un
prepared for action, it being a time of
peace the American commander hauled
down his colors and surrendered
+h â¢? c " d '? US Ct . Citement Prevailed in
the United States over the outrage
President Madison speedily issued a
proclamation excluding from American
ports all- British warships. He also
caused energetic protests and demands
to be presented at London; The Brit
gi' authorities promptly disavowed
the action, recalled the admiral mXr
7 h TÂ« the outrage had be n pern

In a later case the â  American shin
Prometheus was fired upon in the har
bor of Greytown. ; The ship had de
clined to pay excessive port chared
imposed by the King of the Mosaufto
then controlling " the country under
British protectorate. The King called
upon the British warship Exp? PS T to
sustain his demands, and the^press
promptly sent a broadside into the
Prometheus. There were no person!
killed, but ; the United , States mad! a
V^ V u demand for reparation. The i
British Government gave this in the '
fullest manner and without question
disavowing act and condemning
the officer of the Express. â¢
Displays of force were resorted to by
the United States in 1852 against Japan
and in 1858 against Java. b m the case
of Japan, American sailors had been !
severely handled in Japanese ports i
and the native courts failed to give
adequate redress. A naval expedition
was sent to Japanese waters, and this
had the effect of securing the fullest
apology and , also an agreement by
which every protection was guaranteed I
to American citizens and property in '
Japan. In the case of Java the Secre
tary of the Navy sent a large naval
force ti> the waters of Java to demand
that the native trial courts should give
the fullest protection to Americans.
The expedition was successful in its
purpose, and all the assurances desired
were given.
In ISIS seven Americans were killed
and about sixty were wounded while
they were being detained in the British
] iri^iin at Dartmoor. This was brought
on by a clamor for rations, which was
resisted by the prison guard. The
United States demanded satisfactory
and suitable reparation, and the Brit
ish Government complied by an indem
nity for the support of the families of
those killed and wounded.
There are quite a number of recent
cases, the latest being that of the
German occupation of Kiaochau over
the outrages committed by Chinese on
German missionaries. In that case the
German Government acquired as in
demnity a large portion of Chinese ter
ritory, as well as one of the most val
uable strategetic ports of China.
The principle of money indemnity for
the' killing of foreigners has been rec
ognized in several recent cases in the
United States. One of these was the
killing of Italians at New Orleans by a
mob. In that case, while the United
States did not admit the responsibility
of the Federal Government for the act
of a mob, yet indemnity was paid out
of the Federal Treasury as a matter of
international comity and equity. Simi
lar action was taken in indemnifying
China for her citizens killed at Rock
Springs. In the case of the Virginius
a large money indemnity was paid.
Demands by the United States are
now pending against Turkey for the
burning of American missionaries'
property in Turkey during the Ar
menian outbreak. There are many in
dividual claims against Spain, includ
ing the Ruiz case and that of Dr. Del
gado, now pending.
President Buchanan adopted the pro
cedure of reprisal in 1859. This is a
measure just short of war. Mexico was
charged at that time with assenting to
spoliation along the United States bor
der. President Buchanan asked Con
gress for authority to send a military
force to secure indemnity, as diplo
matic negotiations had failed to bring
redress from Mexico. This course was
adopted by Congress, and the prepara
tions for the military reprisal soon
brought forth a satisfactory adjust
ment.
Non-intercourse with Great Britain
was one of the measures adopted in
ISO 9by what is known as the non-inter
course act, as a means of stopping as
sociations which up to that time had
involved many complications and em
barrassments. Embargoes have also
been resorted to as a measure of offense
against foreign nations, short of war,
the purpose being to prevent the ship
ping of supplies needed by the offend
ing nation.
IN CASE OF WAR
MANY WILL VOLUNTEER.
Mail of Governor Shaw of lowa Is
Flooded With Offers of
Service.
NEW YORK, Feb. 24.â A Dcs Moines
special to the Herald says: Governor
Shaw's mail is flooded with offers of
service in case of war between this
country and Spain. A large propor
tion of those who offer their services
are veterans of the Civil War and ex
members of the National Guard. The
anti-Spanish feeling in Dcs Moines was
given an impulse by the arrival this
morning of H. E. Teachout and J. W.
Hill, prominent business men, who
have been making a tour of Cuba. They
left Havana before the explosion on
board the Maine, but from their knowl
edge of the Spanish feeling they are
certain that the disaster was not due
to accident. Interviews with them de
tailing the suffering of reconcentrados
and the insults to which Americans in
Cuba are subjected were printed this
afternoon.
Arrangements are being made for the
formation of a number of volunteer
militia organizations which will offer
their services to the State.
STABBING AFFRAY AT

SAN QUENTIN PRISON, Feb. 25.âAn

Bettencourt and the convict who did
the stabbing got into difficulty over some

SACRAMENTO, Feb. 25.â One of the
most effective incidents which has ta
ken place in Sacramento since the first
suspicion of the cause of the Maine dis
aster arose in the minds of the people
here took place last night at a meeting
of Warren Post of the Grand Army
of the Republic. Those veterans of the
war, who rallied to their country's call
nearly forty years ago, are to this day
just as willing, just as anxious and just
as determined to defend Old Glory now
as they were then.
When the post was called to order
the routine proceedings were speedily
disposed of, and the folio-wing resolu
tions were adopted:
Whereas, In the destruction of the
I nited States battle-ship Maine, while
anchored in the harbor of Havana, en
tailing the loss of 250 lives, casts a feel
ing of gloom over our country, approxl
| muting that of 1861; and Whereas, present
indications seem to warrant the belief
that due caution was not exercised by the
Spanish authorities fur the protection of
said battle-ship and her brave crew
| while anchored in Spanish waters under
! bpanish forts, covered by Spanish guns;
I and whereas, present complications in
! connection with the deplorable disaster to
the Maine have so worked up the minds
of the American people as to render pos
sible very serious trouble, and, as Grand
Army men. wo hold ourselves as ever
, ready to defend the best interests of our

Report of Export Smith Will Not
Cause a Great Delay in tha
Construction.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. 25.
The report of General Sooy Smith, the
Chicago engineer who was sent to San
Francisco to investigate and report on the
foundation for the new San Francisco
postofllce building, is still under consider
ation by Assistant Secretary of the Treas
ury Spalding, Supervising Architect Tay
lor, and Chief Executive Officer Kemper.
They decline to state the nature of the re
port, but a significant remark was drop
ped by Mr. Kemper to-day, when he said:
f "After the report is made public in a
day or two, I hope the newspapers will
not make a mountain out of a molehill."
Assistant Secretary Spalding was asked
why General Smith, a private citizen of
Chicago, was sent to investigate and re
port on the foundation, instead of the de
partment sending a regular agent of the
Treasury- Secretary Spalding said;
"Because we had confidence in him as
a very expert engineer. This is a matter
involving engineering problems merely,
and as the Seventh and Mission streets
site has already been bought and paid for,
and the work of excavation completed,
the building will, of course, be erected
thereon."
This remark of the Assistant Secretary
naturally created an impression that
General Smith's report will say that the
foundation Is infirm and will require a
great deal of piling and at great cost. The
Call correspondent asked Secretary Spald
ing If the material to be used would de
pend on Smith's report. He said:
"Not at all. We have already decided
to use granite. The people of San Fran
cisco need not fear that there will be any
great delay in proceeding with the work
of construction on account of General
Smith s report. The work on tho super
structure will be pushed rapidly as soon
as the bids are advertised for and tho
contract awarded."

will begin the work at an early hour

paratively free of traffic. The easiest
grade to the Presidio will be sought.
When a rifle of similar size and weight
was moved some months ago the truck
went along Van Ness avenue, from
Market to Lombard street. It is pre
sumed that the contractor this morn
ing will follow the same route ap
proaching the avenue along the easiesi
route south of Market street from the
freight yards. The truck tire is fully 10
inches wide, so there is little danger of
damage to the street pavement.
' Word comes from the Ordnance De
partment that other high-power guns
will soon be ready for shipment by rail
to this city. The Engineer Corps is
keeping pace with the Ordnance Corps
in preparation for coast defense.
Colonel Charles R. Suter, U. S. A., is
the division engineer of the Pacific
Coast, and the construction of works
for the defense of the harbor of San
Francisco is under his immediate direc
tion. He is executing a plan devised by
the Board of Fortifications, and it may
require six or seven years' time to fully
carry out the plan as adopted by that
board. Colonel Suter declined to talk
on the subject yesterday. He said that
so far as the Engineer Corps was con
cerned the strictest secrecy was en-
Joined, and therefore he was not per
mitted to disclose the nature of any
plans for the defense of the city. He
was not advised as to the shipment of
any more highTpower guns from the
East, as that was something that per
tained to the Ordnance Corps, of which
General Flagler was the chief. No in
formation could be obtained from
Colonel Suter regarding the proposed
battery at Point Bonita. From other
sources it is ascertained that the plan
adopted by the Board of Fortifications
provides for a formidable battery of 12
inch rifles at Bonita. The works there
will doubtless be of unusual strength,
as they would be exposed to the first
fire of a fleet of hostile ironclads.
Colonel Suter was very courteous In
his refusal to impart information re
garding the work in contemplation.
When a direct question was propound
ed he remarked: "You should not ask
me that question because all officers
of the engineer corps are required to
observe secrecy regarding the location
and strength of engineering works. A
commander of a department is allowed
some discretion in giving out military
information to the press, but the. rule
in the engineer corps is absolute
against giving out any plans."
Everything was quiet along the Pre
sidio line of works yesterday. The
usual guard is maintained to protect
the high-power guns from injury. Am
munition has been distributed and
placed In the magazines. Officers jind

enlisted men of the Third Artillery are
confident that a declaration of war
would not change the station of that
regiment, but the same confidence is
not entertained by the members of the
First Infantry regarding the station of
their regiment. The enlisted men con
jecture that the regiment would be or
dered to Key West at the beginning of
operations, and a readiness to go at
once is expressed by the men. While
the officers of the First Infantry, Third
Artillery and Fourth Cavalry do not
regard war as imminent they perceive
that the war feeling is on the increase
throughout the country and that a con
flict with Spain is among the probabili
ties. An officer of the First said yester
day: "I do not believe this regiment
would be ordered away from this post
if war were declared. The chances are
that we would be ordered to serve as
artillery in the forts of this harbor."
Speaking of affairs at" the Presidio
yesterday, Colonel Evan Miles, com
manding the post, remarked: "Every
thing is quiet here. The force of ar
tillery is ample to man the guns now in
position. The orders advising extra
precaution in guarding the guns and
.magazines are observed. We have not
received supplementary or additional
instructions. Visitors to the Presidio
are allowed to come and go about as
usual."
A board of officers will meet at the
Presidk) next Monday, for the 'mental
and physical examination of such can- j
didates for the West Point Military
Academy as may be authorized to ap
pear before it. The following officers
have been detailed for the board: Major
Robert H. White, surgeon; Captain
James S. Pettit, First Infantry; Captain
Euclid B. Frick, assistant surgeon;
First Lieutenant John D. Barrette,
Third Artillery, and Second Lieutenant I
Thomas G. Carson, Fourth Cavalry.
The examination will be conducted in
accordance with instructions furnished
the board by the Superintendent of the
United States Military Academy.
The following transfers of officers In
the First Infantry have been an

YET FEAR FOR
THE SAFETY OF
THE VIZCAYA
Navy Department Officials Greatly
Worried by the Movements
of the Holland Sub
marine Boat,
NEW YORK, Feb. 25.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: It is not
denied by the administration officials
to-day that great alarm was expe
rienced yesterday and to-day for the
safety of the Spanish armored cruiser
Vizcaya. The movements of the Hol
land submarine torpedo boat which un
derwent a trial yesterday were respon
sible for the scare. Considerable relief
was consequently felt by officials this
afternoon when a dispatch was re
ceived by Acting Secretary Roosevelt
announcing the departure of the Span
ish cruiser from New York. The an-
nouncement of the departure of the
Vizcaya was made in a dispatch re
ceived from Rear Admiral F. M. Bunce,
commandant of the Brooklyn Navy
Yard. Beyond the mere feet that the
Vizcaya had sailed the telegram con
tained no information. It is believed
by the officials that the cruiser is gone
to Havana, but it is proposed to keep
a sharp lookout along the coast so that
in case she anchors in any one of the
Southern ports adequate provisions can
be made for her safety. It was admit
ted to-day that the department was
considerably worried yesterday as to
the safety of the Vizcaya.
During the afternoon Rear Admiral
Bunce informed the department that
the Holland submarine boat had left
Nixon's shipyard early in the morning,
ostensibly to undergo a trial trip. It
was evident from the character of Rear
Admiral Bunce's telegram that he
feared the boat had fallen Into the
hands of Cubans or some irresponsible
person who proposed to destroy the
Vizcaya.
The telegram was received by As
sistant Secretary Roosevelt, who at
once laid it before Secretary Long. In
structions were then prepared to Rear-
Admiral Bunce, directing him to close
ly watch the submarine boat, to search
for any explosives and to have her
taken in charge by a naval guard in
case it should develop that her officers
and men intended to use her to destroy
the Vizcaya.
This instruction was subsequently
laid before the President, who approved
it, and it was at once telegraphed to
Rear-Admiral Bunce.
At a late hour last night the depart
ment received a telegram from Rear-
Admiral Bunce stating that the boat
had been found and examined, but
nothing of a suspicious character had
been discovered. It is believed by de
partment officials that the Holland
boat was under surveillance last night
and to-day. The course adopted by
the department with regard to the
Holland makes it apparent how sus
picious the department has been of
everything which might seem to have
any possibility of developing into a
plot to destroy the Vizcaya.
The department went on the theory
that the Cubans in this country orsome
persons crazed by the loss of the Maine
might have made an attempt to send
the cruiser to the bottom of New York
harbor, and it was against any such
contingency that so many precautions
were adopted.
TORPEDO-BOAT GWIN
. MEETS REQUIREMENTS.
The New Vessel Will Probably Ex
ceed the Contract Speed of
Twenty Knots.
NEW YORK, Feb. 25.-A Newport,
R. 1., special to the Herald says: The
torpedo boat Gwin had another build
er's trial in the bay to-day and it was
given out officially to-night that she
made her contract speed, twenty knots,
easily, and that therefore the Herres
hoffs will notify the Navy Department
that she is ready for her official trial.
This is believed will be ordered for
early next week, much sooner than M:
was thought the boat could be got into
condition. Navy officers say the Gwin
will exceed her contract speed by at
least one knot, and in all other respects
she will meet requirements. She runs
with slight vibration. The official speed
trial will consist of a continuous run
of two hours.

DEPARTURE
OF VIZCAYA
FOR HAVANA
New York City No Longer
Menaced by the
Warship.
Before Steaming Away for the
Cuban Capital Captain Eulate
Reiterates His Expressions
of Friendship.
NEW YORK, Feb. 25.â The Spanish
cruiser Vlzcaya, which has been lying
off Tompkinsville, Staten Island. ;
since Sunday, sailed this afternoon for j
Havana. She passed Quarantine at
1:26 o'clock. Though Captain Eulate 1
had expected to sail about 11 o'clock, :
â with the tide, the departure of the Viz
caya was delayed until after 1 o'clock
by two officers who were on shore.
These men reached Tompkinsville on
the 12:55 train, with important dis
patches from the consul-general at
New York, and hiring a rowboat start
ed for the vessel.
As soon as they were seen starting
from the pier Captain Eulate ordered^
the crew to weigh anchor and a mo
ment later the chains began to rattle
through the hawser holes. Before the
officers In the small boat had reached
her the side screws of the Vlzcaya be
gan to turn and the big vessel moved
slowly down the stream.
When the small boat reached the
man-of-war's side the officers scram
bled up a rope and the Vizcaya began
to get under headway. As the vessel
ed down toward the Narrows at a
four-knot speed Captain Eulate could
be made out standing on the bridge
watching the distant buildings of New
York as they gradually faded from
view. As the vessel passed through
the Narrows the soldiers at forts
Wadsworth and Hamilton stood upon
the ramparts watching her movements.
No ceremony of any kind attended
the departure of the Spanish man-of
war. She did not salute and the big
guns in the fort were silent as she si
lently moved down stream and dis
appeared in the distance .toward Ha
vana.
The Vizcaya was Just disappearing
beyond the Narrows when a train from
Staten Island ferry brought 200 persons
to Tompkinsville, who had come to
at the cruiser. All they could see
of her was her stern and her flag still
at half-mast aft.
Preparations for sailing were active
ly pushed all night. Shortly after
midnight crates of cackling chickens
and quacking ducks were brought
down from New York and hoisted over
the ship's rail. A steer was also j
brought down on a lighter and hoisted
aboard with tackle. Coaling was con
tinued all night with feverish haste
and early this morning the last barge
was towed awoy.
Captain Eulate received newspaper
men aboard about 10 o'clock this
morning and bade them a hearty fare
well. "I have taken a great interest in
your newspapers," the captain said,
"and leave your beautiful harbor with
regrets. If I could I would be glad to
take you all away with me on the Vlz
caya."
While Captain Eulate was talking
the men on deck went through theirlast
drill, and preparations were made to
weigh anchor and move down the bay
on the high tide.
Captain Eulate listened with interest
to the following questions put to him
by reporters:
"What precautions are taken to
guard the magazines on your vessel?"
"What do you think of our navy
yard?"
"What is your opinion of the possi
bility of complications arising between
this country and Spain over the disas
ter to the Maine?"
To these and all questions of a simi
lar nature Captain Eulate replied with
a smile tha- it would be impossible for
him, under the circumstances, to say
a word. He reiterated the statement
made by him on Wednesday, however,
that he was delighted with the recep
tion he had received in this port and
expressed a feeling of great friendship
for the people of this country.

AS TO BOATS
FOR RESERVES
Naval Militia Men Con
fer With the Navy
Department.
Are Interested in the Twenty-
Five Vessels Provided by
the Barber Bill.
They Also Desire Greater Appropria
tions to Secure Uniforms and
Camp Eqiiipments.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. 25.
A delegation from the Naval Militia
Association of the United States was
at the Navy Department to-day. The
visit of the members, however, was not
in response to any requests sent by the
department, as has been represented,
but was simply preliminary to a visit
to the Capitol, where they are to be
given a hearing by the Naval Commit
tee on the Barber bill to further in
crease the naval establishment of the
United States by the construction of
twenty torpedo boats, designed princi
pally for the use of the militia.
While at the Navy Department the
delegation had a pleasant interview
with Assistant Secretary Roosevelt,
who has general supervision of the
naval militia of the country, and with
whom the provisions of the bill were
briefly discussed. The measure, how
ever, had not been formally referred to
the Navy Department by Congress, and
the officials consequently have not
given their opinion regarding its pro
visions. The boats provided for in the
bill are to, be of about 150 tons dis
placement, to have a speed of not less
than twenty-five knots, and are to cost,
including armament, not exceeding
$2,:,00,000.
Two of the boats, the bill provides,
are to be built on the Pacific coast.
When completed they are to be sta
tioned at the principal ports at which
naval militia organizations exist and
are to be manned by skeleton crews
from the United States naval estab
lishment, ready for the full complement
of officers and men to be filled out
from the militia when drill or other oc
casion arises. The association also
desires to urge upon Congress greater
liberality Jn the appropriations for the
naval militia so that they may be fur
nished their uniforms, camp equip
ments, etc.
Commander E. G. Buckland of the
Connecticut militia, who was with the
party, in a brief conversation just after
leaving Assistant Secretary Roose
velt's room, asked that a denial be
made of the published statement that
he had been summoned here for confer
ence with the officials of the Navy De
partment, and added that his visit here
was simply for the purpose of appear
ing before the Naval Committee of
Congress for the purpose stated.
At the Spanish legation a dispatch
was received from General Blanco re
ferring to commercial questions, and
mentioning incidentally that no change
of any kind has occurred in affairs in
SENATOR PROCTOR OF VERMONT.
Havana. General Blanco's latter state
ment is believed at th<- legation to refer
to the lack of definite and trustworthy
news pe-nding the private inquiries
now being prosecuted by the America n
authorities. In view of this attitude of
those whose official position gives them
the best opportunity fur full informa
tion, Senor Dubosc and his associates
do not credit th- reports of discoveries
tending to establish the causo of the
Maine disaster. The commercial nego
tiations have been somewhat lost sight
of during recent exciting events, but
the authorities at Havana are hopeful
that these may be expedited at an
early day. The Cuban Commissioner
who has been named to treat on lh<"
matter probably will come to Washing
ton before long, although some delay
of necessity will occur owing to the
more pressing questions which have
come up of late.

The Wasp This Week.
This week's issue of the Wasp is a
particularly interesting one. As usual,
the editorial features are vigorous and
ably written, while the "X Ray" col
umn fairly bristles with exposes of fa
kers and hard raps at frauds. The mu
sical criticisms of Lucchesi abound with
clever things, and many a make-believe
impresario will wish the Wasp's critic
had never seen or heard him. The
same might be said of the bright theat
rical review, and as for the society gos
sipâit will interest all, and the "Social
Side Lights," by Paul Pry, will be read
with pleasure by every one who enjoys
a good story- on another. In the "Plain
Talks to Public Characters" Rev. Rob
ert J. Coyle is addressed, and every
clergyman and layman as well should
read what is said to the ministerial
gentleman. Long Green Lawrence is
pictured in a cartoon as- a "Modern
Pharisee." and the other cartoons and
Illustrations are notably good.
May Bury Until July 1.
The Western Addition Funeral Directors,
who have the contract for burying the in
digent dead, secured an extension of time
from the Health and Police Committee
of the Board of Supervisors to utilize the
City Cemetery until July l. The man
tiger of the concern argued that when thÂ£
contract was made the proprietors be
lieved that they would be permitted to
carry on their contract to its conclusion
and that it would be unjust to force them
to procure a new burying ground at their
own expense.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 25.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: There
is reason to believe that the trip which
Captain A. S. Crowninshield, chief of
the Bureau of Navigation, made to the
West Indies, was more significant than
now appears on the surface. Tanned
by his exposure to the sun. Captain
Crowninshield resumed to-day his
work at the Navy Department. When
I saw him during the afternoon he said
| that he and his son had joined the
Brooklyn in New Yj>rk and on board
that vessel as the guests of Captain
A. C. Cook, commanding, he had gone
! to San Domingo, where his son owned
banana plantations. It was with a
view to benefiting his physical condi
tion as well as to give his son
an opportunity of disposing of his
I plantations that the trip had been
I made. He learned of the destruction
of the Maine while in San Domir.go,
and this hastened his departure from
that place earlier than had been ar-'
i ranged. The Montgomery fortunately
! arrived at San Domingo and picked
' him up, and on board that vessel !:Â«
| and his son had gone to Port Tampa.
! where they took a train for Washing
ton.
Captain Crowninshield emphatically
denied the report that he had inspect
ed any Cuban harbors or made any
arrangements for a coaling station in
San Domingo. He did not take with
him. he added, any plans of Cuban
harbors with which it is said the de
partment had been furnished.
It is the general Impression in naval
circles that Captain Crowninshield's
â  visit to San Domingo was more impor
! tant than he will admit. In some quar
i ters it is suggested that while on the
Brooklyn he discussed with . Captain
Cook the plan of campaign to be pur
sued by the division of the North At
lantic Squadron south of Cuba in case
of a difficulty with Spain. Some color
is lent this impression by reason of
the fact that the Brooklyn upon leav
ing St. Thomas, where Captain Crown
j inshield disembarked, went to St. Ku
cia, where she will join the cruiser Cin
cinnati and the gunboat Castine. These
three vessels, it is understood, will Join
the gunboats Wilmington, Annapolis
i and Vicksburg, probably at La Guayr.
It is proposed by the administration to
keep three vessels south of Cuba for
the present. There will probably be no
addition to this force, as it is felt that
they can cope with any Spanish ves
sels in Southern Cuban waters, leaving
the northern division of the North At
lantic Squadron, which is at Key West,
to deal with any vessels in northern
waters.
PROCTOR IS
GOING TO
HAVANA
He Admits That He Will
Meet Consul=General
Lee There.
Fears That the Spanish Women of
Havana Will Goad the People
Into an Uprising Against
Americans.
KEY WEST, Feb. 25.âNotwith
standing Senator Proctor's denial of
having any Cuban mission, and that
he was simply South for a fishing and
Pleasure trip, the ex- Secretary of War
sailed from here this forenoon for Ha
vana. He was asked about meeting
Lee in Tampa, but he laughed the
story off and said there was nothing
in it, and when asked about his ohange
of plans in taking this Cuban trip now,
he turned it off lightly, saying that be
ing so near the scene of operations he
thought he would run over and see for
himself the true situation of affairs,
affecting to believe that the reports
from there were worse than the actual
facts.
When asked if he were going to see
Lee he denied the story of being a
special envoy, but admitted after
some questioning that he would be
likely to see Leeâ in fact, would de
pend on him for furnishing him accur
ate information, as he deemed Lee a
very level headed and conservative of
ficial, one who would not get excitod
and lose his head in the midst of all
this red-hot discussion.
From an authentic source it is known
that the news sent by your correspond
ent as to the Tampa meeting was cor
rect, but the facts getting to the pub
lic so quickly, it was decided that if
Lee left, even for a day, it would cre
ate too much excitement, and the plan
was changed and Proctor's pleasure
trip was extended to Key West and
Havana.
The special trains prepared by the
Plant System and other details all bear
this out.
Much comment' is made here over the
fact that Dr. W. F. Bruner, United
States Sanitary Officer, who succeeded
Dr. Williams at Havana, has sent his
family here for safety. Dr. Bruner is
a yellow fever expert from Savannah,
Ga., and enjoys the confidence of the
Government and the medical frater
nity to a great extent. He has antag
onized the Spanish officials and the
medical men of Havana by his truth
ful reports regarding the filthy condi
tion of Havana and the prevalence of
yellow fever and other diseases there.
It is known here that he regards the
situation as being very grave, and that
if the report of the inquiry board is un
favorable Americans in Havana will
likely have unpleasant if not dangerous
experiences. Hence he sent his family
here to be out of harm's way.
Mrs. Bruner prefers not to say any
thing about her husband's ideas or
plans, but she admits that Americans
in Havana are greatly worried for fear
of violence from the volunteers and the
mob element, and many are leaving on
every trip.
The Spanish women make life un
pleasant for the wives and daughters
of Americans there by their illy con
cealed jibes and taunts, and by reason
of their influence there are fears of an
uprising, as their sharp and bitter
words lash the volunteers into frenzy.

HAVE DONE NOTHING YET.
CHICAGO, Feb. 25.â The general pas
senger agents of the Western roads
were in session to-day, considering the
best methods of carrying on the war
against the Canadian Pacific road.
They did not reach any conclusion and
will resume their deliberations to-mor
row. A strong feeling developed in fa
vor of putting in the cut rates through
the Missouri River gateway as well as
through the St. Paul. The probabili
ties are that it will go in through both
gateways. Having secured the suspen
sion of the long and short haul clause
of the interstate commerce act, the
American roads think they can con
serve intermediate rates without con
fining the cut to any particular routes.
They propose to do this by selling
tickets on the rebate plan, charging the
passenger an amount sufficient to pre
vent him using through tickets to in
termediate territory and refunding
him the difference when he arrives at
his destination. This is the plan rec
ommended by the committee.
The First Cut Here.
To-day the Canadian Pacific makes
the first open move to localize the rate
war by selling through tickets from this
city to New York, via steamer to Vic
toria, for $40 first class and $30 second
class. This is a reduction of $39 first
class and $37 50 second class on the
rates in operation before the northern
lines started quarreling among them
selves
Vice-President Stubbsof the Southern
Pacific, when seen yesterday, seemed
disinclined to think that his company
would take any part whatever in the
war. "If this move of the Canadian
Pacific is a bluff it is a mighty good
one," he said. "The Canadian Pacific
is in the position of a man shooting at
a barn door, while we, if we attempted
retaliation, would only be shooting at
a mark the size of a 3-cent piece. The
travel that we would get by the same
sort of a move in their territory that
they have started in ours would not
conic anywhere near making up to us
the loss we would sustain."

committed in the year 1896 or 1597. The
plaintiff confessed to the demurrer and
Judpe Hunt sustained it. hut granted the
plaintiff ten days in which to amend His
pleadings.

TURN THE RASCALS OUT.
THE attempt of the Phelan Democracy at its
meeting on Thursday evening to cast upon Boss
Rainey the entire blame for the corrupt local
government of the past year is quite certain to prove
futile. The Democratic party as an entirety must be
held accountable for the "Shifty Eight" in the Board
of Supervisors, the "Solid Nine" in the Board of
Education and the general demoralization which has
resulted all around from putting Democrats "on
guard." Otherwise there is an end of party respon
sibility. Rainey can no more be held accountable for
the corruption than Boss Phelan, Boss Sullivan or
any other of the numerous bosses who sport tire
Democratic label.
The truth of the matter is the Democratic party of :
this city, as at present organized, is incapable of i
giving us good government. The sign by which it ;
conquers is "the offices." In this respect Mayor
Phelan is no better than his followers. Upon the
platform he talks statesmanship and reform glibly,
but in the filthy pool he is nothing more nor less than :
a patronage grubber who would load down the muni- I
cipal payroll with his friends, supporters and rela
tives, and perhaps sell his soul for an office. If Mayor
Phelan were as much of a statesman in politics as he '
is an intelligent gentleman in private life he would i
recognize his system as utterly destructive of good j
government and reform. No man who spends his j
time creating and filling offices can ever do anything
for the people.
It is true that the Phelan Democracy, which now
endeavors to make out that Rainey is responsible for
all the boodling which has lately taken place at the
City Hall, has generally opposed the policy of the
"Solid Eight" and the "Solid Nine." But it may be
questioned whether this opposition has been due to
its inherent virtue. The fact probably is that Colonel
Sullivan and his politicians are now howling for
"good government" mainly because Boss Rainey has
had the offices for two years. Had they controlled
the places dispensed by him they might now be apol
ogizing for "Cappun" Delany's combine and de
nouncing the Grand Jury for taking an unfair advan
tage of the angelic Waller.
Among Democrats the offices are the source of all
virtue. If Mayor Phelan's friends were drawing
down the salaries paid kt the City Hall undoubtedly
this, in his eyes, would t>e a model government. The
conclusion to be drawn, as we have already remarked,
is that the Democrats are incompetent. What the
people should do next autumn is not to appeal from
Phillip drunk to Phillip sober by dismissing Rainey
Democrats and placing Phelan Democrats "on
guard," but they should fire the whole crowd for
cause.
What the city wants is a clean Republican admin
istration throughout. A respectable Board of Super
visors, a decent Board of Education and a Republican
Mayor would soon straighten things out. A change
from Democrats to Democrats will simply add to the
â  agony of misgovernment.
There is no more reliable paper in the South than
the Richmond Times. In a recent issue it remarks
that the city of Richmond is making money by selling
gas at $i. The gas is said to be of a quality pro
ducing light, visible to the naked eye. The statement
is quoted not to cause anybody distress, but to assure
local concerns that at $i 75 they can, -by encouraging
their agile meters, keep out of the poorhouse.
There will be no objection to the bill of Boutelle to
pay to the families of the men who died as the Maine
went down the salaries 1 which would have been
earned during a year of service. It is really a much
better idea than to erect a/ monument, although there
would be no objection to /this either if the funds were
to be collected by clean hands.
The proposition to tax bachelors in -New. Jersey

FOR IMMEDIATE RELIEF-
PATRIOTIC sentiment and popular sympathy
for the families of the brave sailors who per
ished at Havana with the destruction of the
Maine will have in San Francisco an opportunity to
manifest themselves in a form of practical charity
next Monday evening at the entertainment arranged
by the directors of the Mining Fair for the purpose
of raising a fund for the relief of the stricken house
holds.
The public will bear in mind that the money raised
at the fair will be applied for the immediate relief of
those for whom it is intended. Moreover, the entire
net proceeds will go to the families of the dead sea
men of the Maine. There will be no 10 per cent
rake-off for "wealthy men" who will agree for that
consideration to undertake the collection of the
money. Nor will the fund be kept indefinitely "in
trust" until the persons designed by the public to be
the beneficiaries of their charity are forced to sue the
trustees "for accounting and distribution.
At a meeting of the committee appointed by Mr.
Denicke to take full charge of the work of relief it
was decided that the money raised should be given
without delay to those for whom it was designed
and for whose sake the people have been invited to
contribute. This decision was reached after
an effort had been made to have the fund, or at least
a portion of it, turned over to a self-constituted trus
tee for a monument enterprise or for some other pur
pose that would leave the money in trust for a long
time. The determination of the committee was,
therefore, well considered and is final. All the money
raised will be devoted to the relief of the families of
the noble dead, and the relief will be immediate.
The people of San Francisco can hardly need urg
ing to attend the fair on Monday evening and help
to swell the fund designed for a purpose that appeals
at once to the sentiment of patriotism and the in
stincts of humanity. The families of the heroic dead
need help. Their strong support has been taken from
them. The men who by their service on the Maine
earned the honorable wages that maintained their
loved ones at home have perished. The savings
which a sailor's family can store away are at best
but small. To them, therefore, relief should be gen
erous and immediate. San Francisco leads the way
in the performance of this public duty and her people
arc counted on to see to it that the sum raised will
be worthy of the cause and the city.
Let the date be remembered. Let the people get
ready. All minor engagements should be put aside
on Monday evening in order that the attendance may
be large enough to fill Mechanics' Pavilion to over
flowing with generous, loyal, charitable, patriotic
people. True hearts should prompt willing hands to
show the sympathy of action and liberality on an oc
casion of this kind. The appeal is for the immediate
relief of the families of the American sailors who died
at the post of duty. The response will show the ardor
of our patriotism and the fervor of our sympathy.
GOOD RAINS fIT LAST.
AT last the rains have come, and, what is more,
they have come, it seems, in season for the
greater portion of the crops throughout the
State. The fears of drought have vanished and every
prospect now justifies the hope that the farmers and
orthardists of the State will have good harvests to
profit by the advancing prices caused by the general
revival of industry in the manufacturing centers and
the increased consuming power of the people.
It would have been a calamity indeed to have
a diy spring in California this year. After an almost
rainless fall and winter a lack of rains between this
time and the coming of summer would deprive
the State of almost every advantage it has expected
fr.m the return of better times. As it is we can
look to the future with sanguine expectation. The
augmented demand for wheat, wool, cattle, hops,
truit, taiMns, wine and oil will find Californians in
the market with a bountiful supply.
The benefits resulting from the rains will accruÂ«Â»,
not to the rural districts only, but to the whole State.
The stimulating effects of the refreshing showers will
be felt in business as well as in the fields. The throngs
of Eastern people on their way to Alaska in passing
through the State for the purpose of outfitting in San
Francisco will see the whole Commonwealth flourish
ing in the possession of present good and buoyant
with expectations of the future.
Words of cheer come froim all sections of the
State where the rains have fallen, and the area has
been a wide one. Santa Clara County reports: "The
rain came in the nick of time. Orchardists are de
lighted, as well as ranchers and stock-growers."
From the San Joaquin Valley comes the statement:
"The crops are in splendid condition, and should two
or three inches of rain result from this precipitation
the harvest of grain will be immense." From Napa,
Woodland and Santa Cruz come similar reports, and
only in the southern counties are there still to be
heard expressions of doubt and anxiety concerning
the crops in districts which lack the advantages of
irrigation.
As a whole the outlook for the State at present is
decidedly bright. The long dry spell is broken and
the rains promise to be ample to make sure the pros
perity of the people by harvests of a bountiful char
acter. (
There has arisen a strange and unjustifiable habit of
ridiculing the naval reserve. It would be fair to per
mit this organization at least to have a trial. The
local organization makes a fine showing in times of
peace, and when boats are to be manned a volunteer
who has cultivated a pair of sea legs is certainly as
valuable as one who has never smelt salt water, and
in all probability more so.'

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1898.
THE OUTBREAK IN OAKLAND.
IT was natural and perhaps inevitable that the out
rageous water job perpetrated by the shameless
six of the Oakland City Council should have re
sulted in an outburst of public indignation that threat
ened the summary punishment of one of the betrayers
of public trust. Official corruption tends to popular
violence, as ex-President Harrison pointed out on
Washington's birthday, and the only way to surely
guard against the one is to remove the other.
Popular outbreaks undoubtedly have an effect
tending to check governmental wrongs. They
frighten the perpetrators of corrupt acts and serve as
a warning against repetitions of the offense. Not
infrequently base men in office, who have been indif
ferent to the law, to reason, to justice, to honor and
to decency, have halted in their course, retreated and
yielded when confronted by an enraged community
threatening personal punishment and showing an in
clination to inflict it sternly and swiftly.
Notwithstanding these things, however, a commun
ity loses more than it gains by such demonstrations
of violence. In a country where government is of
the people, for the people, by the people, there should
oe in the law itself sufficient redress for any and all
forms of wrong that may be committed. The people
of Oakland should not forget that it was by their
votes five of the shameless six were elected to office,
and the remaining offender, appointed to office, would
have been powerless for harm without the support of
the elected gang.
There seems a fair chance for Oakland to obtain
redress for the wrong done her citizens by an appeal
to law. If the result prove that the schemers have
been cunning enough to carry out their outrage
within the forms of law, then Oakland will have had
an impressive lesson on the importance of electing
honest men to office, and if her people profit by it the
increased water rates of this year will be none too high
a price to have paid for the benefits that will result.
In the meantime the directors of the water com
panies and their tools in municipal offices would do
well to give heed to the meaning of the popular out
burst in Oakland on Thursday night. Official cor
ruption in the interest of corporate greed has become
a sore point with the American people. When so
eminent a man as an ex-President of the United
States, on an occasion so solemn as that of the anni
versary of the birth of the founder of the republic,
makes that offense the subject of his speech and ad
dresses a stern warning to the offenders of the con
sequences of their offensive acts, it is time for even
the most reckless wrongdoers to pause and consider.
Water companies have been serious offenders
against public morals in California, hven at the
present time the water company of Los Angeles is
threatening an act of spoliation wnre, if possible,
than that attempted at Oakland. The people have been
irritated to the limit of endurance with respect to
these offenses, and the significance of the outbreak
of Thursday is a warning to all concerned to beware
lest worse befall them.
SHfILL WOMEN PAY TAXES?
A PROPOSITION is before the Illinois Legisla
ture to exempt from taxation all property
owned by women until woman suffrage is se
cured by an amendment to the constitution. It is
put forward by the suffragists in the expectation that
it it pass their prayer for the ballot will be speedily
granted. A powerful movement is already behind it
and an outsider can easily wish that it may become
the law for the sake of the instruction that would be
in the subsequent events. It is shown that in Chicago
alone there are ten of millions of dollars in property
standing in the names of women, and it is estimated
that in the whole State such ownership of property
is so large that the exemption will greatly reduce the
amount derived from taxation and will make it ne
cessary to largely increase the assessment and levy
upon all property that is in male ownership. It is
expected, of course, that under this spur the men of
the State will be positively tumultuous for woman
suffrage.
We leave out of the question whether exemption of
property, not by it 3 use but by its ownership, will
stand the judicial test, for we prefer to consider the
movement as intended by its advocates, to advance
the cause of woman suffrage.
Is it true that it will incline all men to that cause?
Obviously it will not. Experience proves that
where there is an exemption of property from taxa
tion, based on its ownership, the tendency is for prop
erty to flow to the point of exemption. If church
and ecclesiastical property is exempt the church and
ecclesiastical organization begin immediately the ac
quisition of property until its accumulation in their
ownership becomes a menace to the State. They
accumulate because exemption from taxation enables
them to pay a higher price than buyers whose own
ership is without such advantage. Therefore in Illi
nois the exempt class would finally absorb all the
property. Not only has our sister woman specula
tion in her eyes, but our brother man would imme
diately proceed to confer his estate upon her in a
trust partnership profitable to both, and he would
never vote for woman suffrage because it would de
stroy the profits of the trust. Nor would our wise
sister woman care for the shadow of suffrage when
she enjoyed the substance of ownership exempt from
taxation. Therefore, instead of a step toward suffrage
this exemption would set against it the impassable
barrier of self-interest and the pride and profit of
possessions. The State would find itself impoverished
by holding on and at the same time be unable to let
go, for men, being exempted by the new law, which
enabled them to tie all property to the family apron
string, would refuse to vote for its repeal. The State
would be driven to support itself by occupation taxes,
licenses, excises and those means of revenue which
arise in the use of property and not in its ownership.
This Illinois experiment is so original and interest
ing that those who are not to be affected by it should
desire it tried for the sake of the lesson that is in it.

EAD NEXT SUNDAY'S CALL, and you'll get a very good Idea of
â i^^ how the perennial revolutions are started in the Central American
I Republics.
|)^J President Gutierrez has written toafriendinthis city that one is
I "1 ripening in his capital. A "professional revolutionist" is in this
j| % city looking after the business interests of the forthcoming revolu
% tion, and indirectly he tells how it was born and how it is being
developed.
That's only one of the features in NEXT SUNDAY'S CALL.
There's a rattling good story about the rush of several compa
nies of United States troops to suppress what was reported to be a
threatened Zuni uprising. It proved to be a Zuni "witch chase," and a good
deal of feeling has been aroused over it.
What the reputed witch did, how she was punished by the high priests
of the tribe and daringly rescued by a white woman is told in detail In
NEXT SUNDAY'S CALL.
The description of voice pictures and how to make them will more than
repay you for the cost of the paperâ s cents. It's a fad that will interest
you from a scientific and a good many other points of view.
Then there's a chance given you at the same time to see what a beauti
ful picture is made when Jessie Bartlett Davis of the Bostonians sings "O,
Promise Me." As a contrast is the rugged picture made by the voice of Eu
gene Cowles when his great bass shakes the instrument in one of his
famous songs.
Of course, you're taking a great deal of interest in the Maine disaster,
and, like everybody else, you're eyes are centered on the wrecked vessel lying
in the bay before Havana. If the wreck affects people way off here so tre
mendously, how do you suppose it affects the everyday people engaged In
everyday life in Havana? Red-handed revolution has stalked through the
island for several years now, and Havana and its people have been threat
ened time and again.
How do those same people employ themselves during all this excite
ment?
How do they amuse themselves?
Read NEXT SUNDAY'S CALL, and you'll find a graphic description of
life in Havana as it is in the midst of all this hubbub, worry, excitement and
death.
Ice farming as conducted on the Truckee is an exceedingly lively and
busy life while it lasts. NEXT SUNDAY'S CALL tells all about the inter
esting life of the hustling mountain ice farmer, his terrors of a snowstorm
and the very slick way in which he harvests his crop -while the summer
boarder is hibernating in ease and high hopes.
The law recently proposed in Ohio by Assemblyman Parker to regulate
marriage by physical examination has caused a great deal o-f discussion

THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT.
The Cuban Government I found to be
working with just the same routine as
any well-recognized government. Major-
General Bartolome Maso, the President of
the Cuban republic, impressed me as be
ing a very conscientious, energetic and in
telligent man, and, above all things, a
great patriot, and one who has the repu
tation of being one of the most honest
men on the island. He was born in
Manzanillo in ]834. and took part in the
insurrection of 1868. On the 24th of Feb
ruary, 1895, he left Manzanillo, and has
been in the field ever since. He was
elected Vice-President of the Cuban re
public on September 18. 1895, and elected
President October 20, 1597.
The Vice-President, Mendez Capote, is
also an exceedingly bright and clever
man, and is a great diplomat. He has
the rank of brigadier-general, and was
born in Cardenas, in the province of Ma
tanzas. He holds the degrees of LL. D.
and Ph. D. from the University of Ha
vana, and is secretary of the Spanish-
American Light and Power Company,
Consolidated, and was counsel for the
railroads of Havana.
The members of the cabinet are also
very competent and intelligent men, be
longing to some of the best families in
Cuba. The Secretary of War, Brigadier
Jose B. Aleman, is a native of Santa
Clara, and is 34 years old. He is not
only a planter, but the editor and owner
of La Defensa, a Liberal newspaper pub
lished In Santa Clara, and has served
as Alderman of the Santa Clara Munici
pal Council.
The Secretary of the Treasury, Colonel
Ernesto P'ons Sterling, was born in Ha
vana. He is 28 years old and belongs to
one of the best families on the Island
The Secretary of Foreign Affairs.
Colonel Andres Moreno de la Torre, was
born in Cardenas, in the province of Ma
tanzas. He is 38 years old and holds the
degree of LL.D. He is the owner of a
sugar plantation nnd Is a well known law
yer of Havana and Cardenas.
The Secretary of the Interior, Lieuten
ant-Colonel Manuel Raymond Silva was
born in Puerto Principe. He is 30 years
old and holds the degree of doctor of
medicine and Is a well known physician

THE SECRET OF THE WATERS.
Dead, down there In that tepid sea
Where the sharks hold high their revelry.
Some sailors have found a sailor's grave,
Beneath the turmoil of wind and wave.
Away from the battle Of free and slave.
Dead, and their ship is their winding sheet,
Its folds of Iron around them meet
And hold them close in a cold embrace.
That the hungry sharks may not displace.
Dead are they, and the great white ship
Has gone with them on their final trip;
Together they rest down in the deepâ
Ah, me! will the waters the secret keep
Which clasps In its hand the sunken Maine
And Cuba's to-morrow, and the fate of Spain?

LAW AND MATRIMONY.
A correspondent has requested Law
Notes to advise him how many women a
man may marry at once without violat
ing any law. This being a mixed question
of law and love, and our specialty being
law, we feel some hesitation in express-
Ing our opinion. There seems to be no
reason why he may not marry as many
as will have hirfi, provided the ceremony
be not performed "In a Territory or other
place over which the United States has
exclusive jurisdiction."
The curliest statute on the subject of
polygamy (I. Jac. 1, c. 11) enacted "that
if any person or persons within England
and Wales, being married, or hereafter
shall marry, do marry any person or per
sons the formÂ«r husband or wife being
alive, each offense shall be felony." The
statutes 35 George 111, c 67. and 4 George
I c 11, have merely changed the punish
ment (1 East P. C. 464). The statutes of
the several States go no further, in
terms, than to provide that no person
"who has a former husband or wife liv
ing shall marry another." Under these
statutes It would seem that it wna not
unlawful for a single man to marry as
many single women simultaneously as
can place themselves within reach of his
voice and the voice of the preacher or
officer performing the ceremony.
It may be that a court to whom a ques
tion were presented would, by some re
finements and subtleties, and by "consid
ering the intent of the Legislature," and
construction of the statute "according *o
its spirit," etc., devise some means by
which to interrupt the wild career of con
jugal felicity which our correspondent
proposes and send him to jail, but Law
Notes, construing the statutes as all penal
statutes should be construed, strictly, sees
no offense in the multifarious marriage
which he has in mind. We feel indisposed
to extend the language of the Legisla
ture so as to make It include cases not
embraced in its terms. It is not unrea
sonable to presume that Hie Legislature
READ
THE SUNDAY CALL.
Intended merely to protect Innocent and
unwary persons from marrying others al
ready married, In Ignorance of the pre
vious marriage, and to prevent wives and
husbands from deserting their consorts
for others. We do not know that the
Legislature Intended to prevent a man
from marrying more than one woman
simultaneously, when it could so easily
and in such few words have said so.
This position finds strength in the fact
that the Edmunds act (act Con. March
22, 1882,), declares expressly. In addition
to the usual provision, that "any man
who hereafter simultaneously, or on the
same day, marries more than one woman.
In a Territory or other place over which
the United States has exclusive jurisdic
tion, is guilty of polygamy," thereby rec
ognizing that the usual provision does
not meet the case in question.â Law
Notes.
SIGSBEE'S GREATEST GLORY.
The Army and Navy Journal in its
last issue, commenting upon the Maine
disaster, says of Captain Sigsbee:
"Again has the country received proof
of the character of the men who com
mand our navy. Could there be a more
severe test of a man's quality than that
to which Captain Sigsbee was subjected?
How well he met it is shown by his first
dispatch, in which he counseled a sus
pension of judgment as to the cause of
the calamity. It is those who suffer most
from this disaster â who are best able to
Judge of its full extent and appalling sig
nificance â who have been the most calm
and collected, and who have done the
most to restrain hysterical utterances and
to prove to the world that Americans may
always be depended upon to show In the
presence of a great emergency the calm
ness of true courage; the reservation of
an Invincible resolution which can wait
until the proper time comes for its ac
tion.
"It is a gallant action to blow up the
enemy's warship in time of war as did
William T. Cushing. It is an equally
gallant action to stay by your own ship
after she had been blown up, amid dead
ly peril of more explosions, until your
men are off; and It argues even a higher
and nobler gallantry to stand between
this awful experience and an imminent
outbreak of popular frenzy and by cool,
brave counsel avert the greater calam
ity. This did Charles D. Sigsbee. No
man ever better earned the thanks of
Congress. His country already thanks
him and is proud of him."

you will have, on applying for your sec

"Which is the longest singlf river In the
world?" Is a question that cannot be an
swered, for there Is not a river that at
some point or another is not fed by a
tributary; but if by the question is meant.
"Which is the longest river in the world
having one name?" then the Amazon is
entitled to that claim. It is estimated
thut its length is 3750 miles*. There are
some who set up the claim for the Mis
sissippi; but upon examination it appears
that the Mississippi proper from fts
source to where it Joins the Missouri is
it is estimated. 3200 miles; from there to
the ocean is about 1200 miles. The Mis
souri, from its confluence with the Yel
lowstone to Its confluence with the Mis
sissippi, is about 2100 miles. The Yellow
stone is about 1000 miles long, and then
from the confluence of the Mississippi and
the Missouri to the ocean being about irxx>
miles, that would make a grand total of
421)0 miles. But that is not a single river
The next longest in the world are: The
Congo, 3500 miles; the Yeneaei, 3400 miles
Nile is 3000 miles long.

of the belligerent drivers, while a wo

Pacific street wharf to take passage on
the Mail boat. The boys wanted to
take a run uptown the worst kind of a
way, but the instructions to the dock
officials were not to allow them off the
wharf. It was impossible to keep them
â in. however. They could not pet past
Harry, the gatekeeper, but they did
manage to climb the fences at the head
of the v. harf and made their escape in
that way into the street in squads.
Finally a watchman was put on each
fence and an attempt was made to re
strain the boys in that way. but it was
useless. Two or three of the boys
would keep the watchman busy while
two or three nmre would slip past him.
Before anything could be done the lads
would be nver the fence and down East

have been drafted for th~ Baltimore

away from right and left swings or side
step with ease wild rushes, he sailed
into the rotund body of his opponent
and the sharp and telling right and
left hand jabs at short range greatly
disturbed the well-fed bread basket of
the local welter-weight.
Green felt the sting of the glove and
he made several wild attempts to land
his right on Ryan's jaw, but he might
just as well have tried to land on the
clock which counted him out, in the
eighteenth round.
Billy Kennedy, superintendent of
the Olympic Club, visited The Call of
fice last evening and said that Ryan
had consented to fight Walcott under
the auspices of the Olympic Club at |
catchweight. and that the match '
could be made at any time Walcott
or his manager desired.
Kennedy further said that Ryan had \
consented to meet Green again at 146 i
pounds, and would guarantee to knock
him out in six rounds or less. Doubt
less the Walcott-Ryan match will be
arranged.
Betting oji th<=> fight closed with Ryan
a strong favorite at 10 to 5. In the
Paris rnutuals considerable money was
bet that the fight would end in eighteen
rounds or over. Some of the sports
evidently were "posted" on the game. |
The pugilists agreed to divide the
fighter's end of the purse.
THE FIGHT BY ROUNDS.
Green entered the ring nt 0:1". o'oinck,
accompanied by his seconds, Eddie
Oreany. Joe rhnynski, Frank Foster
and Bob McArthur. Ryan followed a
few seconds later, esquired by Billy De
laney, Spider Kelly and Henry Baker.
Billy Jordan announced Ryan as the
"Eastern wonder" and Oreen as the
"Western wonder." Green received the
most cordial reception.
James McDonald, the famous base
ball umpire, was introduced as the ref
eree. The announcer stated that Tom
O'Rourke had telegraphed challenging
the winner of the contest to a fight with
Joe Wolcott, but O'Rourke did not
state in his wire what weight he want
ed them to fight at.
As the men came together in the cen
ter of the ring with their seconds to
talk about clinches, it was noticeable
that Ryan had the advantage of an
inch or more in ht-ght and that his
arms were the longest. Roth appeared
about the same weight, 150 to 105
pounds. They agreed to hit with one^
arm free in the clinches.
FIRST ROUND.
As they came to the center for the first
round, both fiddled and danced around for
a full minute. Green was the first to lead
and Ryan ducked away easily. Ryan next
put in a light tap on Green's stomach.
Ryan kept a perpetual sÂ»milÂ»* on his face.
Ryan reached with his long left and
caught Green lightly on the face. A clinch
followed. Both men light on their feet
and dancing around each other warily.
Ryan marvelously quick with his hands
aiid feet. The round endfl without any
damage to either. Cries of "Good boy,
George," at Green's clever showing.
SECOND ROCXD.
Green rushed at the opening of the sec
ond, resulting in a clinch. Green rushed
again and Ryan ducked away. Green
lands a hard left on the Jaw, Kyan coun
tering on the eye. Ryan's constant smile
seems to provoke Green, who rushes
again without effect. Ryan keeps his
brows elevated and his head partly down.
He looks somewhat like Choynski, and
his fighting style is similar to Corbett's.
Green swings for the head but the East
ern boy was not there.
THIRD ROUND.
At the commencement of the third
round Ryan ducked far away from
Green's opening rush, and stood up to re
ceive a left on the side of the face. Green
also planted his left on the body. Ryan
doing very little fighting, but trying to
draw out hiÃ man and let him expend his
strength. Ryan executed a clever side
stop to the right and left, coming with a
straight left on Green's nose. Green tries
a left uppercut and misses by a yard.
Ryan's longer reach is more apparent as
the men get into close quartets.
FOURTH ROUND.
Ryan opened the fourth round with a
rush, landing left and right on the body.
Green swung his left for the head, land
ing lightly. Ryan rushed Green to the
ropes, landing left hard on the body. He
rushed again rind Green turned quickly
sinking his left Into Ryan's stomach
Ryan never gave an inch as Green landed
a left swing on the neck. Green put his
right on Ryan's breast and knocked his
head back with a glancing left on the
forehead. Ryan rushes his man to the
ropes in Green's corner and they ex
change hard body blows. McArthur one
of Green's seconds, joshes Ryan from the
ringside and Ryan replies in" kind, laugh
ing and fighting right on all the while
FIFTH ROUND.
Tn the fifth, after considerable fiddling
Ryan crowds Green to the ropes and gets
the worst of a hot exchange. Green
flushes Ryan on the nose with a straight
left. Ryan puts in a hot one on Green's
body. Green lands a terrific left swing on
Ryan's jaw. but Ryan, partly blocking its
effect with his glove, smiles the more
Ryan exhibit" extreme cleverness but
does not try hard to land.
SIXTH ROUND.
Ryan opened the sixth round with a
hard straight left on the mouth. Green
lands heavily on the body and rushes
Ryan, when the latter runs away. Green
swings his left around Ryan's head and
gets a stiff right on the ear. At close
quarters Ryan puts another hard one on
Green's already swollen mouth. Green
swings left and lands lightly on the head
as the round ends.
SEVENTH ROUND.
Ryan lowered his position several
Inches into a crouching posture as he
came up for the seventh, and Green \
rushes into a clinch. Green receives a
hot one on the ear and another in the
body. Ryan rushes and puts in a left up- j
percut on the jaw. Green tries a left up- !
percut breaking from a clinch, but Ryan ;
was not there. Green gets in a, good "one
on the body and two li^ht jabs on the ''
nose.
ETOHTH ROI'ND.
They came together with a clash at the
opening of the eighth round. Ryan
blocked a left swing cleverly with his
glove. Green landed a nose warmer and
Ryan's smile faded for a minute. A hot
exchange followed in Green's corner
Both men were somewhat winded, and
there waa little execution done in this
round.
NINTH ROUND.
The usual opening rush announced the
ninth, and Ryan tried a left swing with
out landing. lie then grazed Green's nose
with his left. Ryan with his arm blocked
Green's left swing, and clinchod. Green
swung again and Ryan caught it on his
glove. Ryan rushed and Green slipped "to
the floor in hiÂ« own corner. Ryan landed
a hard right on the body. They exchanged
left and right cuffs at* the face In close
quarters.
TENTH ROUND.
At the beginning of the tenth Green
rushed, Ryan stepping to one side. Ryan
received a hard left Ln the stomach. They
clashed, exchanging hard blows at the
body. Green exhibits considerable clever
ness In side stepping and ducking. Green
lands a left swing, and as Ryan clinches
puts his left twice on the face. Green
rushes Ryan to his torner. Ryan puts in
a left swing on the neck and they ex
change hard blows on the body. Both
are making a good stand-up fight of it
now. Green lands hard on the neck as
the round ends, and Ryan, smiling a
pleasant "Thank you," goes to his corner
with a broad grin on his face.
ELEVENTH ROUND.
Ryan dropped his posture again several
inches in the eleventh, and as they came
into close range an even exchange re
sults. Great exhibition of science, but no
hard blows. Green gets in a hard upper
cut on the stomach. Ryan slaps back at
him with his left on the face. Green tries
another left uppercut, which Ryan re
ceives in the stomach again. Both swing
right arid left without effect, clinching.
Green side steps and avoids a left swing.
TWELFTH ROUND.
Ryan's side-stepping and ducking was
the feature of the first part of the twelfth
round, coupled with a hot left swing on
the neck that Green landed, ln Green's
corner Ryan landed a couple of hard ones
on the face, and Green retaliated on the
body. Green tapped Ryan's nose smartly,
and it angered the Eastern boy, who
fought back viciously. They exchanged
some stiff blows on the face at close
range and the round ended in an uproar.
This was the first time Ryan really let
himself out and he fought Green to a
standstill. The California boy was greatly
distressed as he went to his corner.
THIRTEENTH ROUND.
Ryan rushed, beginning the unlucky
thirteenth, planting his left straight into
the pit of Green's stomach. Ryan feinted
with his left and crossed with his right,
landing lightly on the face. Green landed
left and right hard on the body. Ryan
ducked prettily from a left swing and
also blocked a rapidly following left up
percut with his glove. Green punched
Ryan in the stomach as the round closed.
FOURTEENTH ROUND.
Ryan stooped lower than ever as he
came up for the fourteenth with a do or
die expression on his face, from which
the smile was departing gradually. He
ducked his head and led with his left, but
Green hopped away. Green swung a hard
right, which encircled Ryan's neck. Ryan
cuffed Green on the face lightly with his
left glove. Ryan then swung lightly with
his left and quick as a flash planted a
terrific right into Green's stomach, and
Green never thoroughly recovered from
the effect of this blow. Ryan stopped a
well-meant uppercut and they exchanged
stiff, blows on the body.
FIFTEENTH ROUND.
Ryan did most of the fighting in the fif
teenth, Green contenting himself with
carefully guarding his sore stomach, try
ing an occasional and usually unsuccess
ful return. Green was greatly distressed
and worried, with Ryan the picture of
confidence and apparently unharmed.
SIXTEENTH ROUND.
Green showed his splendid grit in the
sixteenth round. Sore and distressed,
after Ryan buffeted him all over the ring
for two" and a half minutes, he turned on
his antagonist toward the close of the
round and fought back like a tiger, so
that Ryan clinched to prevent damage.
SEVENTEENTH ROUND.
Many thought that if Green could pull
through to the twentieth round he would
be entitled to a draw at least, and that
was what the lad seemed to be playing
for. Ryan forced the fighting, however,
and Green was in no condition to with
stand his onslaughts. They exchanged
left and right swings on the head with
telling force. Ryan blocked a left upper
cut and received a swing on the neck as
he rushoil in. Green backed away and
then rushed in, landing with his left on
the face.- Ryan ducked another swing
and missed one of his own. Green very
weak and clinging at every clinch.
EIGHTEENTH ROUND.
The end came for Green in the eight
eenth round. Ho did some clever duck
ing, avoiding many a wicked smash, but
there were many that he did receive, and
he had neither strength to fence them off
nor land back at his stronger opponent.
After a clinch and a light exchange Green
sank to the floyr, remaining down nine
seconds, when he staggered to his feet,
but fell hack again in a heap and was
counted out, Referee McDonald announc
ing Ryan the winner amid a terrible up
roar.
The irrepressible McArthur then clam
bered into the ring to dispute with the
timekeepers who counted Green out, but
two or three husky policemen who had,
climbed in after him gently tossed him
over the ropes on to the hard floor and
the excitement subsided. Ryan grasped
Green's hand, and Graney and his other
seconds helped the defeated but not dis
graced local champion to his dressing
room.
The preliminaries afforded some lit
tle entertainment as appetizers for the
spectators prior to the eventof theeven
ing. The first w.as a three-round set
to between Fred Babcook of Pennsyl
vania and Hugh Dougherty of Chicago.
It was evenly contested and Announcer
"Billy" Jordan did not render a deci
sion.
Next came a four-round bout between
Tony Florence of San Jose and Grant
Rogers of this city, and they furnished
one round of h^ fighting, ending in a
complete knockout.
Rogers rushed his man from the
start and gave him no rest. He floored
him twice with straight arm punches,
Tony staying down each time nine sec
onds. He fought back hard when on
his feet, but was clearly outclassed,
succumbing finally to a left Bwing just
before the first round ended.
Joe Kane and Pat Lynch, both of this
city, then came on for a six-round con
test, Frank Allen acting as referee.
Both men weighed about 150 pounds.
Lynch was the aggressor from the
start, and his superior condition told
in his favor against Kane's science.
The bout was declared a draw.
Inflammatory Rheumatism.
Prom St. I^awrence Plalndealer, Canton, N. T.
To suffer for years with a prevailing
painful ailment, which baffled skillful
medical treatment, yej which was cured
by a simple household remedy, is the lot
which befell Mrs. George L. Rogers of
West Main street. Canton, N. Y.
"Thirteen years ago," said Mrs. Rogers
to a reporter, "I was attacked with In
flammatory rheumatism and a complica
tion of diseases.
"You can judge somewhat of what I
endured when you look at these hands.
They were distorted, twisted and swollen.
My foot, too, is so much out of shape that
the big toe lays across the others, the end
touching the little toe.
"Notwithstanding I am 65 years old,
have a pleasant home and other comforts,
life to me was far from enjoyable, for all
other things pale into insignificance when
you are without good health.
"I tried different doctors and many pro
prietary remedies, but no permanent ben
efit was obtained.
"Last March I tried Dr. "Williams' Pink
Pills for Pale People, and before I had
finished the first box I began to feel that
they were doing me good. I continued
using them and steadily grew better.
"I have used thirteen boxes of the pills
and to-day feel better than for the past
fifteen years.
"My appetite is good, I feel bright,
cheerful and have a desire to live and en
joy society.
'"'I have been a member of the Metho
dist church for many years- but for six
years was unable to at-tenn. I am able
now to attend the church services regu
larly and certainly appreciate that priv
ilege.
"1 consider Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for
Pale People a wonderful medicine, and am
confident no other medicine could have
effected the wonderful cure they have in
my case.
"I am glad to state this, hoping that
some sufferer may profit by It and obtain
relief."
It was nature s own remedy that ac
complished this cure caused by impure
blood, for Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for
Pale People are composed of vegetable
remedies that exert a powerful influence
in purifying and enriching the blood.
Many diseases long supposed by the med
ical profession to be incurable have suc
cumbed to the potent influence of these
pills. This universal remedy is sold by
ail druggists.

LOS ANGELES, Feb. 25.â Seated on
a footlog crossing the Los Angeles
River, upon which is marked in large
letters "Property of the city of Los
Angeles.'" which marks the location of
the famous or infamous Pomeroy &
Hooker tract, a condemnation suit con
cerning which has been pending for
more than five years while the City
Water Company has collected $1,600,000
from the people in water rates; sur
rounded by mud, brush, horses and cat
tle. The Call representative hereby at
tempts to give the people of the State
of California something of a descrip
tion of the water supplied to the people
of Los Angeles.
The ground over which the stream
flows is verdant, which speaks well for
the kind of soil, a thick loam, furnish
ing the best quality of mud. The sur
rounding country consists of bogs and
lowland swamps, and flowing into this
section are numerous channels from
the surrounding towns, where the sur
face flow of water continually adds
to the volume of the stream.
Burbank is situated about one and a
half miles from here, in the upper part
of the sloping land. The mountains are
about eight miles distant. The land
gradually slopes down to the Los An
geles River, which is the only drainage
stream from all the surrounding coun
try for a distance of forty miles. Thus
it will be seen that the water which
flows in the river is nothing more than
an outlet for all the surface flow of the
entire valley from its mountain source
to the ocean, thirty miles distant.
The water itself has much sediment
and foreign matter. The stream for its
entire length is lined with fungous
growth and its banks are the pasturage
for herds of cattle, sheep and horse, as
well as the sites of many barn yards.
The town of Toluca is situated about
two and a half miles up the stream,
with other towns and villages farther
on, whose sewage can find an outlet
only through this river.
Thus it will be seen that the Pome
roy & Hooker tract is the central part
and the diverting point at which this
river water is to be transferred from
the river bed into prepared conduits or
pipe lines to be furnished as water for
domestic purposes in the city of Los
Angeles. The site or land is situated
about 340 feet above sea level, being
about SO feet above the center of the
city of Los Angeles, which is about
twelve miles distant. This site is what
has been proposed as the future source
of water supply for the inhabitants of
Los Angeles.
The Crystal Springs, of which more
will be written later, is just a few miles
below this site and is acknowledged by
all to contain an impure, undesirable
substance, animal and vegetable mat
ter, and is therefore not fit for dorms
tic use.
The Pomeroy & Hooker tract was of
fered to the city for $30,000 about six
years ago. A committee abo-ut that
time went to the place to make an In
vestigation of it, with a view to having
it supply the city with water for do
mestic purposes. The committee start
ed from Los Angeles armed with sand
wiches and beer. In impenetrable jun
gles of willow, nettles and flags, the
committee became confused â yea, in
deed lost, mired down in the mud and
stuck fast. A rescuer appeared.
"Billy" Mulholland (everybody knows
him) came along about that time. See
ing the City Fathers in such a predica
ment, he volunteered to rescue the
committee, and it was soon on land,
high and dry above the main marshes
of the stream. During the confusion,
incident to their journey through the
jungles, the commltteemen lost their
sandwiches and beer; but "Billy" was
well armed for the occasion.
Starting out from the corner of Ala
meda and Marchessault streets, from
the well-filled exchequer of the water
corporation which does business in that
particular part of town, he was pro
vided with champagne and turkey, and
la, the committee appointed to protect
the city's interests and look for a new
water supply fell down and worshiped
the corporation champagne. The com
mittee felt so grateful to its benficent
rescuer that all proceedings were im
mediately changed. New plans were
laid, and the city, instead of purchas
ing the lands, proceeded to litigate. A
condemnation suit was instituted, and
the tract that would at that time have
cost but $30,000 has already cost it more
than $50,000, together with $1,600,000 in
water rates, and Providence only knows
whether the litigation is any nearer a
settlement to-day than when it first
began. The people are becoming tired
of this protracted lawsuit and its
costs, w\hich, added to the undesirable
quality of the water, make the propo
sition ridiculous to continue the case
or even to consider the tract as a feas
ible source of supply.
It would perhaps be interesting to
the reader to be informed as to the
method contemplated for developing
â water in these low marshes and river
beds. The system is known as the per
colating system, which consists of a
main conduit or underground flume dis
tributing or throwing out branches in
various directions beneath the surface
of the land desired to ,be drained. This
â would necessitate the excavation of a
great deal of earth, roots and debris,
and would be a considerable expense.
The water percolates through the soil
above into these trenches below, the
water being conducted into the main
conduit, thence to the main trench and
then into the reservoirs for distribu
tion. This system is used in the Crys
tal Springs district, end is the means
used to provide water to the citizens of
Los Angeles.
It seems strange that any sane peo
Scene at the Point Whence Los Angeles Derives Its
Water Supply.
p!e should ever contemplate the devel
opment of water in such a place, when
but a few miles distant there is an
abundance of sparkling water direct
from the snow-capped mountains in an
abundance that cannot be exhaust* <l.
There are sites in the mountains for
storage reservoirs and places for devel
opment that can and undoubtedly will
furnish a storage for an abundance of
pure water for the citizens of Los An
geles. This water from the mountains
can be easily led down to and connect
ed with the mains that are now laid
from the swale lands of the Crystal
Springs to the reservoirs of the city of
Los Angeles.
The mountains immediately above
these marshes are all Goverament
lands, and have been by proclamation
of the President created into a forest
reservation. Those mountains will nev
er be settled â in fact, are not capable
of settlement, and the strong hand of
the Government will forever protect the
watershed from the intrusion not only
of settlers, but of cattle, sheep and
other animals, and will forever protect
and preserve the natural purity of the
melting snows that fall thereon during
every winter season.
But this discussion is hardly gerÂ«
mane to the original point of this arti
cle.
As to these low marshes again: Think
of this water seeping through the roots,
decayed branches and underwood into
the subterranean channels. Think of
the amount of surface water which
flows over this, and much of that sur
face water will undoubtedly find its
way into these underground conduits.
Notwithstanding any precautions that
may be taken, hundreds of cattle are
continually grazing over this land and
the adjacent territory, and horses,
hogs and other animals wander about
at their will. This %vater can never
be considered healthful and can never
be made of use to the citizens of Los
Angeles.
The valley through which the river
flows is called the San Fernando Val
ley, and it is very productive and ex
ceedingly rich. New farms are con
tinually being started along the entire
valley. Thus the number of cattle,
farm houses and barns are continually
increasing and the entire flow of the
water which drains this section must
find its way to the ocean through the
only course, the Los Angeles River.
There can be no stop or limitation
as to the amount of herding done in
this section. The only place whereat
to obtain this underground percolating
system must be along the borders of
the river. Hence if the site were to
become the head works for the city of
L<>s Angeles it must in a very few
short years change its source of sup
ply or Jose its credit for being a city
for health and recreation and find a
source of pure water for its domestic
purposes.
It has been a question in the minds
of the people of the city of Los An
geles for a long time as to who was the
real owner of the Pomeroy & Hooker
Tract. The nominal owners are both
wealthy men and amply able to make
a long and strenuous fight if they
should see fit and if their interests so
dictated, but the contest has been such
a one and the circumstances have been
of such a nature as to indicate that
there were forces at work other than
that of the ownership of the land in
volved.
At the time of the first negotiations
the city had voted bonds to acquire a
water works system. These bonds
were carried by a majority of 5 or 6 to
1, and it looked very much as though
the day of doom for the City Water
Company had arrived.
In these desperate straits something
had to be done. The head works were
about to be acquired when the little In
cident of the "Lost Committee" oc
curred. Then the Council immediately
changed front and instead of purchas
ing this site instituted a condemnation
suit, which by delay after delay has
resulted in five years of litigation.
Who has been benefited by this de
lay? It certainly has not benefited
Messrs. Pomeroy & Hooker. It is said
that they have been to an expense of
$50,000 in conducting the litigation, and
their judgment for damages, which now
exists and from which they are prose
cuting an appeal, is for only $30,000.
Manifestly they haye 1 not been bene
fited by the law's delays.
The City Water Company, on the
other hand, has been able to collect
$2,000,000 in water rates and the trivial
sum of $50,000 expense has amounted to
very little with it. It is noted by the
people that the attorneys that repre
sent the water company represent
Messrs. Pomeroy & Hooker. It is ob
served that the expert engineers in the
pay of the water company advance
their opinions on the trial on behalf of
Mesrs. Pomeroy & Hooker also. Tak
ing the facts together, first, as to who
has the money, second as to where the
interest really lies, and third the fact
that the engineers and attorneys are
the same, and the people are led to be
lieve that the City Water Company has
some interest in the condemnation suit
of the Pomeroy & Hooker tract, and
that the selection of this tract â or
rather the selection of the means by
which it was to be obtainedâ was one
of the biggest steals from a munici
pality that has ever been instituted in
Western America.
A steal of $2,000,000 has already been ef
fected, and now the City Water Com
pany is laying its plans deep and mys
terious and is controlling the press of
this city for the purpose of effecting
another steal of about the same mag

nitude. The question arises with the
citizens <>f Los Angeles as to whether
or not a second $:.', 000,000 steal is guing
to be permitted.
The facts in regard to the Pomeroy &
Hooker tract and the $2,000,000 collected
in water rates while the litigation has
been delayed, have never before been
properly presented to the people of Los
Angeles before this article.
This stern rc-ality stares the citizens
in the face: Are they to be mulcted
of another $2,000,000 and be given in re
turn only the poisonous water that
emanates from the bogs, marshes and
COW pastures of the lower San Fernan
no Valley, when the " water from the
snow-capped peaks of yonder moun
tains, protected from intrusions by the
strong hand of the United States Gov
ernment, runs quietly to waste and the
people are not allowed to share in its
benefits?
The corporation has been at all times
too stingy with its exchequer to spend
i the few hundred thousand dollars
necessary to supply the city with this
mountain water, while again it has
been in better position to hamper it by
means of supplying the water from
the low swal.es, marshes and bogs
below.
As The Call representative sits here
on this footlog and attempts to peer
into the future, with the citizens
| awakened to the steals of the past and
j the attempted steals of the present and
I'sees them throw off the yoke of the
merciless corporation and go into yon
der mountains, where a munificent
I Government has reserved for them a
! supply of melting snow, and pipe the
i same down for the use of the people
! without the interference of the mo
| nopoly, he sees before the city the fu
ture that lacks only this one necessary
prerequisite to its greatness.
The most thriving business in Los
Angeles to-day is that of peddling wa
ter upon the streets. One water com
j pany distills water and sells it for 75
cents for each ten gallons. There are
various small concerns peddling water
from adjacent springs. Everybody in
the city who can afford it purchases
this class of water, and only the poor
allows the substance from bog
ponds to touch their stomachs. It is
said that the people actually pay to
these companies more money for dis
tilled and spring waters thus peddlrd
from wagons than will be necessary to
pay the interest on the cost of con
structing a system from the mountains
to the city.
One reads of water being peddled
! through the streets of Jerusalem and
j other cities of ancient times, but it is
| hard for the people of California to
! realize such a state of affairs in a met
ropolitan city of to-day.
PASSED A STEAMSHIP
SEEMINGLY DISABLED.
French Vessel Believed to Be La
Champagne Probahly in
Distress.
NEW* YORK, Feb. 25.â The Dutch tank
steamer Bremerhaven, which arrived here
this afternoon from Antwerp, reports
that on February 19, in latitude 43, longi
tude 44, she passed a steamship, appar
ently a Frenchman, which was almost
Stopped and was heading northwest. She
had two mas* and two funnels. Regula
tion lights were burning, but no signals
were displayed.
It is quite probable the Frenchman had
set anchors out, although it was too dark
to see if such were the fact. The weather
had been very stormy, blowing hard from
the northeast and continued to blow
throughout the following day, Sunday
and part of Monday, with very heavy
seas from the northeast.
Captain Ninnes. when informed that La
Champagne was overdue, said there was
no doubt in his mind as to the identity
of the vessel.
Death at Los Gatos.
SAX JOSE, Feb. 25.â A. Rosp, an old

of New York. A widow survives him.
ARGUE AGAINST
THE INJUNCTION
San Jose Officials Seek
Relief From Law's
Restraint.
Councilmen Protest Against an
Order Preventing an
Alleged Job.
Judge Kittredge Takes the Fire-
Alarm-System Case Under
Advisement.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 25.â The petition "of
Sanford E. Smith for a permanent in
junction to restrain the Mayor and
Common Council from awarding a con
tract for a new fire alarm system to
A. J. Coffee was argued and submitted
before Judge Kittredge to-day.
A short time ago the Council awarded
Coffee the contract for a tire system for
$3900, while a bid from the Gamewell
Company for $3300 for a similar system
was before the Council. The Mayor ve
toed the ordinance, but the Council
boasted it would pass it over his head,
and to prevent this waste of the pub
lic's money a temporary restraining or
der was procured. O'uncilmen Fay,
Nolting. Dittus and Krieg were repre
sented by Attorneys Spencer and J. W.
Sullivan and Attorney W. H. Hardy
appeared for S. E. Smith.
The objections of the Councilmen
and Coffee were read. Deputy Clerk
Simonds was sworn and exhibited the
vote on the ordinance awarding the
.contract for the fire alarm system
and other data relating to the ordi
nance. Judgt- spencer then began an
argument for the Councilmen. He
said the case was similar to the street
sweeping case argued a week ago, and
that the only matter worthy of present
consideration was the veto of the
Mayor, filed after the issuance of the
temporary writ of injunction. That
veto changed the conditions so that the
present procei dings were futile and un
necessary.
He then proceeded to analyze the
bids, claiming that those of the Game
well Company did not comply with the
published notice, which specified that
Willard's system should be furnished,
and that the Council in selecting Cof
fee's bid as the lowest and best had
acted within its discretion and for the
best interests of the city.
Attorney Sullivan, for Coffee, follow
ed In an argument along similar lines.
Attorney Hardy held that the Coffee
bid did not comply with the notice. He
said it was not the lowest and best bid
and that the injunction should i.ssuo.
Counsel claimed the other bid was the
lowest. Unless the Injunction should
lie the Council might override the
Mayor's veto.
The case was then submitted for a
decision. As the thirty days allowed
by law in which to pass an ordinance
over the Mayor's veto- expires in a
few days the question must be decided
quickly.
Mayor Koch filed an answer to the
summons this afternoon. He denied
that unle=s restrained he would enter
into the contract with A. J. Coffee,
setting forth that on February 7
he had vetoed the ordinance.
SAN RAFAEL'S TEN
THOUSAND CLUB

The object of this club is, primarily,
to increase the population of the city of
San Rafael to 10,000 people before the
month of June, 19<>l. To attain this the
material development of San Rafael's re
sources is absolutely essential; therefore
tne club will use all legitimate means to
promote immigration to Marin County and
to San Rafael in particular by the follow
ing methods: By establishing and main
taining a bureau of information in San Ra
fael where reliable information of every
character concerning the resources of the
county may be obtained, by personal or
written application; by promoting and en
couraging the development of every le
gitimate industry in the county; by ad
vocating and urging the construction of
first-class county roads; by encouraging
and urging the construction of railroads
and street-car lines; by impressing upon
the people the urgent necessity of improv
ing and beautifying all public squares
and parks and public school grounds in
San Rafael and vicinity; by using all hon
orable means to promote the best inter
ests of San Rafael and vicinity and by co
operating with all associations and organ
izations having for their object a similar
purpose; by raising funds by subscription
or in any other legitimate manner for the
purpose of carrying out the objects of
thjs organization"; by celebrating national
and State holidays in a fitting and be
coming manner.

First Strike at Oakland Har

Precedent.
DEFEAT IN THE HOUSE.
I
Both Items Remain in the Rivsr and.
Harbor Appropriation
Bill.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, D. C, Feb. 25.
There was a hot fight in the House
this afternoon against making appro
priations for river and harbor improve
ments, provided for by existing law, for
which no contracts have yet been
made. It was evident from the begin
ning that the principal purpose of the
fight was to strike out the appropria
tion for San Pedro harbor.
The fight was opened with Parker's
motion to strike out the appropriation
for Oakland harbor ($133,000) on the
ground that no contract had yet been
made for the work. The friends of C.
P. Huntington promptly rallied to the
support of Parker, not because they
were opposed to the appropriation for
Oakland harbor, but because the defeat
of Oakland harbor on the ground stated
would be a precedent for defeating the
appropriation for San Pedro.
That the real assault was on the ap
propriation for San Pedro harbor was
soon made apparent by the speech of
General Grosvenor of Ohio, attacking
that appropriation on the grounds that
the contemplated improvement was
unwise; that it would cost more than
the amount limited by law; that no
contract had yet been made for the
work, and that an excellent harbor in
that vicinity was to be constructed by
private enterprise and turned over to
the Government without cost, provid
ed the Government should not proceed
with the improvement of San Pedro
harbor, and asserting that an offer in
writing to this effect had been filed
with the Secretary of War by persons
of unquestionable responsibility. This
statement of Grosvenor's is understood
of course to refer to Huntington's
proposition to improve Santa Monica
harbor at the expense of his own com
pany, but an investigation has failed
to elicit the fact that any such propo
sition has been filed with the Secretary
of War.
Mr. Cannon, replying to Grosvenor,
practically declared that he was not
in favor of going on with the improve
ment of San Pedro harbor, and rather
shocked the members of the California
delegation by intimating that there
was a little joker connected with the
$400,000 appropriation in the bill. He
declared that advertisement for con
tracts for work on San Pedro called
only for the construction of a break
water, while the appropriation and the
law under which it was made required
the construction of a deep-water har
bor. He therefore thought the courts
might hold (contrary to the Attorney-
General's opinion) that the appropria
tion could not be used for the construc
tion of a breakwater.
A long colloquy followed this sugges
tion of jugglery, in which Messrs. Ma
guire, Cannon, Barlow, Hepburn and
Northway participated.
Maguire tr.-ok the position that Can
non and others had confounded the in
ner and outer harbor projects, which
he said were entirely distinct; that the
act of lSiÂ»8 contemplated only the im
provement of the outer (or deep water)
harbor, already deep enough for com
mercial purpi/ses and a refuge for the
largest vessels afloat, provided only
that it be protected from heavy seas
and from the shoaling of its entrance
|by the deposit of sediment, both of
i which purposes would be accomplished
I substantially by the building of a
breakwater.
Cooper (R.) of Wisconsin came to the
support of the Californians with a
clear and powerful ten-minute speech
in favor of the appropriation.
He said he wiuld rather see every
other appropriation in the sundry civil
bill fail than witness the national hu
miliation involved in allowing the pri
l-vate owners of Santa Monica harbor
to further their personal interests by
defeating the appropriation for San
Pedro.
At the close of Cooper's speech the
opposition to San Pedro was practically
abandoned and the appropriation
passed without division. It was re
marked that throughout the debate
Hooker of New York, chairman of the
Committee on Rivers and Harbors,
who was such an earnest champion of
Santa Monica in the Fifty-fourth Con
gress, sat behind General Grosvenor,
prompting and advising him but tak
ing no direct part in the discussion.
Ever since the sundry civil bill was
reported to the House last week Hunt
ington's man Friday (otherwise called
John Boyd) has been buttonholing
members of Congress.
The result of this fight adds another
to the list of Mr. Huntington's failures
to control legislation in Congress,
where he was once thought to be om
nipotent.
The attempt to strike the Oakland
appropriation from the bill failed.
LOS ANGELES POLICE
COURTS ARE ILLEGAL
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 25.â The Police
Justice courts of this city have been de
cided illegal by Judge Van Dyke of the
Superior Court. A writ of habeas corpus
was asked for in the case of Ah Sang, a
fan-tan player arrested some time ago.
This morning Judge Van Dyke relasad
the prisoner and decided that the Whit
ney act, under which the Police Courts of
this city are constituted, does not apply
to this city, as the census taken last year
by the Postoffice Department showed the
population to be in excess of 100,000. He
declares Police Judges Morrison and Ow
ens to be illegally in office and their offi
cial acts null and void. The decision af
focts a large number of prisoners now
held awaiting trial, but as the two jus
tices are also Police Judges under an
other law it is possible that their work
may be continued as such and extend to
all cases of misdemeanor within the city
limits.
THE LUCILLE
SAILS AT LAST
Government Expedition
Leaves Nanaimo for
Alaska.
End of a Vexatious Delay At
tended by Heavy
Expense.
For Eight Days the Vessel Has Been
Detained Awaiting a Tug's
Arrival.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Feb. 25.â The vexatious
wait for a tug which has detained the
pack train of the Klondike relief expe
dition at Nanaimo for the last eight
days is now over and the ship Lucille,
with her interesting cargo of army offi
cers, packers, mules and Government
supplies, is on her way to Alaska. A
telegram received here to-day an
nounced the arrival at Nanaimo of the
tug Monarch. The ' ship was imme
diately made ready to proceed on her
important mission to the north in tow
of the Monarch.
Thus ends another of the introductory
chapters of the history of the Govern
ment expedition for the relief of the
men who may be reasonably supposed
to feel even now the dread invasion of
wantâ men known to be battling un
successfully against scurvy induced by
lack of variety in their food. From the
first there has been delay following de
lay, until it seemed that the train on
which so much depended would never
get under way. Even after sailing from
this port, after detentions sufficiently
discouraging, the vessel immediately,
on striking British waters, was tied up
once more for what promised to be an
indefinite length of time.
The 112 mules, whose condition is of
such importance to success in crossing
the passes, had suffered from confine
ment in the stalls of the ship's deck,
and it was found necessary in Nanaimo
to unload them and. put them into a
warm barn.
The transfer of the mules from ship to
shore and back again is not child's
play. It requires some time, and there
is always danger of loss through in-
Jury to some of the animals. Hardly
are they settled ashore than the tug
Monarch appeared, and then came the
change from shore to ship. The work
of reloading the stock was begun this
morning and completed in the aft-r
noon. By this time the Lucille is well
on her way, providing no unforeseen ac
cident has occurred.
All this delay has cost some one
thousands of dollars; it ha* been re
sponsible for a loss that can hardly be
calculated in holding back an expedi
tion on vhe early arrival of which in
Dawson depends the physical well be
ing of hundreds of miners. Further cost
is possible through the arrival of the
pack train at Dyea after the snow and
ice have become so slushy as to render
the use of pack mules impraoticable,
and the animals themselves worthless.
It seems difficult to place the respon
sibility. Havner & Co., charterers of the j
Lucille, claim that the Government un
derstood perfectly that there would be
a wait at Nanaimo.
"The Government has no cause for
complaint," said Mr. Havner to-day.
"Before the Lucille sailed on February
16, we went to Captain Robinson and
told him we could not promise to get
the party to Dyea at any definite date.
We told him that it might take forty
five days to reach there; that we could
have the tug Monarch only as far as
Nanaimo and must wait there to catch
another tug coming down from the
north. If they wished to go by some
other vessel we offered to unload their
stuff. We even went so far as to in
sist that they should pay the expenses
of keeping their men and mules at Na
naimo during such time as we might
be compelled to remain there. Every
thing that could be suggested to ex
pedite the departure of the Lucille from
Nanaimo we have since done. Since
she left here we have been under an
expense of $300 a day, so you can read
ily see our interest in getting the expe
dition landed in Alaska as early as pos
"We have a contract with the Puget
Sound Tug Company, which controls
practically all the large tugs on the
sound, to take the Lucille to Alaska.
As a matter of fact they have about
half again as much business as their
boats can attend to. I think now, how
ever there will be no further trouble.
"Since the ship has been tied up at
Nanaimo Captain Robinson Jr.,- local
representative of the War Department,
has tried in every way to hasten the
expedition on its. way. Since no tug
could be secured at first he thought of
sending a United States revenue cutter
to tow the Lucille."
At the time United States District
Attorney W. R- Gay did not believe that
this could be done, but later changed
his opinion. There was also some
thought of bringing the Lucille back to
American waters and transferring her
freight and passengers to some steam
ship. The chief objection to this was
that no vessel with space enough to
take the entire pack train with the sup
plies for the expedition could be
found. It was that fact, indeed, which
induced Captain Robinson to recom
mend the sending of the train and sup
plies by the Lucille. The original con
tract, as will be remembered, was on
the steamship Signal, but delay in the
arrival of that boat from Alaska caused
the cancellation of the agreement.
The Government has stipulated to
pay Havner & Co. $6000 for the use of
the Lucille on this voyage. A portion
of the amount has already been paid.
It is probable, according to good au
thority, that the payment of the bal
ance of the $6000 will be refused by the
Government, and in that case Havner
& Co. will be forced to enter suit.
LADS "PLAY DURRANT"
WITH A COMPANION.
Strangle Him Almost to Death Be
fore a Woman Comes to His
Assistance.
STOCKTON, Feb. 20.-The Mail this
evening is responsible for a story to the
effect that recently four or five little boys,
â¢whose ages ranged from 8 to 12 years,
concluded to play "Durrant." Setting
upon the smallest of the party, they pro
posed that he be Durrant and that they
would make believe hang him. They
placed a piece of black cloth over the
youth's head, put him into a little wagon
and tied a rope around his neck so tight
ly that it made the youngster scream
with fear. The rope was soon drawn so
taut, however, that the screaming ceased.
The boy's companions concluded that he
had merely stopped yelling because they
told him to.
The little fellow's yells had been heard
by a woman living near. She hastened to
the spot, and soon saw that the boy was
being strangled to death. She finally got
the rope loosened sufficiently to allow the
helpless boy to breathe. She had arrived
just in time to save the little fellow's life;
already he was blue in the face. A few
breaths of air soon revived him. The
names of the boya were withheld.
GENERAL BOOTH
AT LOS ANGELES
Third Visit of the Salva
tion Army Chief to
California.]
Speaks Feelingly of the Dif
ferences Between Himself
and His Son.
Given a Loyal Greeting by the ttank
and File of His People in the
South.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 25. â Gen
eral William Booth, commander-in
chief and founder of the Salvation
Army, arrived in this city over the
Sante Fe at 8:30 this morning, and a
right royal welcome did he receive at
the hands of the 200 Salvationists who
had gathered at the depot to welcome
him and his party. With the general
were Commander Booth-Tucker, the
leader of the forces in America, and
his wife, Consul Booth-Tucker, Com
missioner Nicoll, editor of the Salvation
Army publication in Great Britain, Ad
jutant Deverell, the general's private
secretary, Colonel Lawlor, the singer,
and Brigadier Alice Lewis, the con
verted opera singer, who Is secretary
to Consul Booth-Tucker.
Although the streets of Los Angeles
were muddy and very damp, the faith
ful soldiers of the army lined up behind
the carriage containing their chief and
his staff, and followed it to the bar
racks. Here the visitors remained but
a few moments, after which the party
was driven. to the residence of J. S.
Slauson, on Figueroa street, where they
will be entertained during their stay.
General Booth has still a most Impose
ing physical appearance. He Is aa
straight as an arrow, and looks at
least ten years younger than he really
is, his age being 69. To a Call repre
sentative he said:
"This is my third trip to California,
my last being about three years ago.
Since I shook hands with the President
at the White House I have received a,
hospitable welcome throughout the
country, and I may truly say a marked
approval of my work. We are better
understood now in the United States
since the mists and fogs of the recent
controversy have rolled away, and it is
seen that ours is a disinterested work
for the poor and the lost â a purely phil
anthropic work, in fact.
"I really don't understand the feeling
of the Volunteers of America. I don't
understand it any better than you do;
but the feeling of unity in the army is
a hundred times stronger since the dis
agreement than it was before. I of
fered, when I first came to the States,
to visit my son and I did see him but
not alone, for that he declined to per
mit. I am still in the dark as to his
attitude, and no one but God knows
what it means to me to be thus es
tranged from him. Almost every hour
I ask myself how- it will out. I
think of it day and night and pray con
tinually for aid and council."
Being asked if he had formed any
opinion regarding the war feeling in
this country as a result of the Maine
incident, he safd;
"I know little of the matter, but It
i would seem ridiculous that Spain
would seek, in her present circum
stances, to arouse the United States
against her. And Ido not think that
this country would seek a quarrel
either. But, after all. I know nothing
about it. I know only the heart of
England, and that I know as perhaps
no other man can. I am linked to
her people by almost mysterious bond,
and I fully realize that England is a
powerful nation, with an especially
warm regard for the United States.
You cannot know as I do how strong:
that regard is."
General Booth held his first meeting
at the Pavilion to-night. The larg*
building was packed to the doors.

UMBRELLAS
IN DEMAND
Forecaster Hammon Says
the Storm Is Still
With Us.
Copious Rains Will, Therefore,
Fall Throughout the
State To- Day.
The Anxious Farmers Correspond
ently Jubilant Over the
Prospects.
The truth of the old adage that there
is nothing so certain as the uncertainty
of California weather has been practi
cally exemplified in the conditions that
have obtained In the past few days
during the visit of the last rainstorm.
It can well be said that for "ways that
are dark and tricks that are vain," our
climate is most peculiar. This storm ;
did not have to overcome that area of j
high pressure over the plateau region |
in Arizona, Utah and Nevada which j
former storms had to meet and which
were in consequence deflected from this
district for so long. It therefore came
to us free and untrammeled, and yet
< omparatively little rain has fallen
throughout the State, and as a result
there has not yet been as much rain
as needed in any locality.
When Official Forecaster Hamraon
was seen at the Weather Bureau in the
Mills building and asked yesterday aft
"moon as to what the farmers had to
expect from the existing weather con
ditions, he said: "1 would rather some
body else did the forecasting, for it is
well known that prognostications in re
gard to this climate are not infallible.
However, I am of the opinion from re
ports that we have received to-day that
the present storm has not done its full
duty. The storm never would have
reached here at all had the conditions
been tlffe same as they were seyÂ«ral
weeks ago. I anticipate that the storm
has not yet fully spent its strength, and I
that we will get more rain before it j
, leaves us entirely, and, although the J

an exposition that will properly bring
to the attention of the world the re
souit.es and products of the Pacific
Slope.
it is thought by some that the
World's Fair would draw many people
who would visit this city if there were
not a Counter-attraction. For that rea
son it has been suggested by those who
are heartily in accord with the move
ment looking toward the holding of a
large exposition that we defer our fair
until 1901.
A meÂ«ting was held yesterday morn
ing ir th< Mayor's oi!i<;e to discuss the
preliminary details of the exposition.
Letters were received from several in
vited by the Mayor t,. take part in the
preliminary work regretting that other
business kept them away from the
Ing, bin they sent assurances of
their hearty support.
Mayor Phelan, in calling the meeting
to order, stated that he sent invita
tions to prominent business and profes
sional men asking them to co-operate
in forwarding an exposition that would
be worthy of the State and its re-

barometer has remained almost sta
tionary all day, still the sky has all the
appearance of rain. One point in fa
vor of my contention is that if it was
clearing after the storm the wind
should be northwest instead of south
east or southwest, as it has been.
"The cessation <>Â£ rain, which I be
lieve to be only temporary, is due to
the storm having rebounded off the
coast into the ocean, but it has not
go-ne so far that it will not come back
and give us plenty of rain. The high
pressure over the plateau region has
permanently disappeared, and has left
us in excellent shape for copious rain
falls whenever a storm shall come.
"We have had about one inch of rain
over one-half of the State. The pre
cipitation has been north and west of
a line drawn from Point Conception
north and a little east to the eastern
i Age ' f the Sacramento Valley. To the
southeast of that line 1.10 inch fell and
only 15-100 inches in the San Joaquin
Valley. The dry spots where no rain
fell were the west end of Merced coun
ty and two or three places on the west
side of the San Jcraquin. The southern
boundary of the rain Is between Los
Angeles and San Diego, none having
fallen at the latter place up to 5 o'clock
Friday.
"The rains that we have had would
hardly grow a crop, hut will help to a
great extent the pasturage for live
stock, which were in dire need of it.
The San Joaquin Valley is probably in
better condition thnn any other local
ity on account of the natural moisture
that pervades the soil there, and if it
would get two inches In a period not
extending over ten days it would be all
that is necessary. The warm, sultry
condition of the atmosphere Friday
afternoon is also a good indication for
more rain, as it shows that the storm
has not left us, for the source of heat
Is the condensing of the moisture In the
storm."
When seen later in the evening Mr.
Hammon said: "I think that I have
described the weather situation accu
rately, and Saturday it will rain ev
erywhere from San Luis Obispo north.
The storm center is opposite the Ore
gon coast, and the barometer is falling
slowly but surely. The rainfall to-day
has been very light, 2-100 inch having
fallen in this city; 1-100 in Los Angeles; :
4-1 Mm Red Bluff, Carson and San Luis \
Obispo, and 6-100 in Los Banos."

versary of the admission of California !
into the Union. I am heartily in favor j
of an exposition. With me it is sim
ply a question as to the advisability of 'â¢
holding the exposition that year."
Joseph Leggett said that, while he j
favored the exposition, he feared that
the World's Fair to be held in Paris in
1900 would prove a counter attraction
that would be the means of keeping
many people away, who under other
circumstances would visit this coast.
"I believe in expositions, and think
the idea suggested by The Call an ex
cellent one," added Mayor Phelan.
"This is a holiday State, and an expo
sition would prove of great vahie in ad- i
vertlslng the resources and products,
not alone of California, but of the en- ,
tire coast. In 1900 the Paris Exposition
will be held, and I fear it will prove a
great attraction for Eastern people.
They will find it just as cheap to jour
ney to the other side. They are the
people we want to visit us. It is un
fortunate that our fiftieth anniversary
is contemporaneous to the Paris Expo
sition. I met Mr. de Young, the pro
prietor of the Chronicle at lunch yes
terday, and he said that, while he fa
vored an exposition, he did not think
that 1900 was the year for it. He sug
gested that it might be postponed until
1901. The Native Sons have declared |
THE STATE
LIBRARY FIGHT
Present Trustees Will
Not Surrender Their
Offices.
Their Successors Will Not Be
Given Certificates of
Election.
Governor Budd Claims That the
Purity of Election Law Has Been
Violated by Pledges Made.
The Board of State Library Trustees
will meet in Sacramento to-day, and
! nothing is more certain than that a
j lawsuit will be the outcome of it. The
present members of the board will re
| fuse to give way to the Trustees elected
! by the last Legislature unless they pre-
I sent the proper credentials signed by
1 the Governor. The Governor will not
â  sign the credentials.
The charge has been made that the
! Trustees elected to take office next
Monday have violated the purity of
election law by making an agreement
as to how the patronage of the Li
brarian's office shall be divided. In
fact, it is charged that four of their
number signed a pledge to not employ
any but Republicans in the library.
Prior to the election of the Trustees
who will < laim office next Monday let
1 ters were sei\t out by John H. Dickin
j son, Thomas Fl int Jr. and W. F. Price,
members of the Legislature appointed
at a Republican caucus, notifying can
didates for election as Library Trus
tees that it would be necessary to
j pledge themselves to Republican rule.
The letter was so worded that any
Trustee living up to its obligations
could not under any circumstances ap
point or vote for a Democrat to hold
place in the State Library.
The caucus letter was published in
full in The Call on the 16th inst., and
Governor Budd was not slow in tak
ing notice of the political document. He
says that he will not issue certificates
to the Trustees chosen by; the last
their intent ion of holding a celebration
in 1900. The State's admission will be
celebrated by them. Why not have an
exposition in the fall and winter months
of 1901? We can send a commissioner
to Paris, and he could spend his time
making arrangements for the shipping
of exhibits to this city. The foreign ex
hibits can be shipped around the Horn
from Havre or Marseilles much cheap
er than from Chicago or other points.
As you all will remember the Midwin
ter Fair was made up of attractions
from the Chicago Fair. We could step
in now and keep the field open for a
coast exposition in 1901. In that year
there would be a practicability of hold
ing line."
"I am like you, Mayor Phelan," said
Joseph Leggett. "I am in favor of an
exposition if we <'an get it. I consider,
however, that 1900 would hardly be in
good taste to h"!d an international ex
position. I think one year later would
be better."
â¢'lt will bo seven or eight years after
the Midwinter Fair," interrupted May
or Phelan. "I think it would be easy
to get up an exposition after the one
at Paris. I believe it an excellent
plan to wait. There will be many who
will be unable to see the Paris Exposi
tion in 1900 who would visit our exposi
tion in 1901."
Legislature, and also says that he ex
pecta to be brought into court in the
matter. ,
"I suppose that I will be manda
mused," said Governor Kudd yesterday
aftern'-on, "but that will not in the
least bother me. 1 will not issue the
certificates to the trustees who will
claim office on Monday for several rea-
BOM. I hold that, with the possible
exception of J. H. Neff, they all took
a pledge that is in violation of the
purity of election law. The gentlemen
who flaim office by virtue of election
by the last Legislature will, if I am
ctly Informed, attend the meeting
"f the Library Trustees to-morrow and
ask for their credentials. I intend be
ing present, and will decline to give
them commissions. The stand I will
take is on the ground that their elec
tion in joint session of the Senate and
Assembly was never properly certified
to by the President of the Senate and
Speaker of the House. In addition, the
pledge given by them to the Republican
caucus is in violation of the purity of
election law. Another and important
fact to be borne in mind Is that the
pertlon of the Political Code governing
the management of the State Library
and the election of its trustees went
into effect in 1873, and provided that the
term of office of the trustees should be
for a period of four years. Under that
law I fail to understand how the term
<>f the present trustees could terminate
in 1898. In other words, if each term
of office as State Library Trustee is to
be for four years, and the law under
which we are now working went into
effect in 1873, the incumbents' terms
would not expire until 1899."
It is understood that the State Con
troller, who is a Republican, will rec
ognize the Trustees elected by the last
Legislature, regardk-ss of the position
taken by Governor Budd. If the Con
troller recognizes the new board it will
have absolute control of the library
funds. In the event of a legal warfare
being necessary, and that is almost cer
tain, W. W. Foote will represent the
Governor, j
The point advanced by the Governor
that the election of Trustees was not
certified to by the President of the Sen
ate and Speaker of the Assembly does
not, in the judment of lawyers-, present
much of an obstacle. The journals of
that day's session of the Legislature
were certified to as correct by the pre
siding officers, respectively of the Sen
ate and Assembly, and this certificate
covers the proceedings of the joint con
vention at which the Trustees were
elected. This approval is believed to
be sufficient.
The second point concerning a viola
tion of the purity of election law may
receive a different construction from
that which the Governor apprehends.
An enlightened court would probably
construe a pledge to appoint Republi
cans as a pledge to administer the af
fairs of the library in an honest, intelli
gent and creditable manner.
"Don't you think it would be a good
idea to adjourn until the other mem
bers of this committee could be seen,"
; said John H. Grady, "and their opin
! ion as to the advisability of holding
: the exposition one year later was had?"
"There is no need of that," said
Mayor Phelan, "as it is my intention
; to appoint a committee of fifteeh and
j they will decide on the year in which
i the exposition shall be held. California
i was admitted to the Union on Sep
; tember 9, ISSO, but it did not put on its
statehood until some time later."
"What year was the Chicago fair
opened?" asked Leggett.
"They started to open it in 1892,
i which was the four hundredth anni
versary of the discovery of our coun-
I try, but did not open until 1893," replied
! the Mayor; "yet it was no less a grand
; celebration. We might pass some reso
lutions and get the affair started," he
, concluded.
The following resolutions were then
presented and adopted:
WHEREAS, There is a general
desire to celebrate in a fitting man
ner the fiftieth anniversary of the
admission of California into the
Union by an international exposi
tion to be held in San Francisco; and
whereas, San Francisco, by reason of
her climate and past experience, is
well-fitted as a location for such a
fair to be held in the fall and winter
months; and whereas, the fiftieth
anniversary of the admission of the
State occurs in the year 1900, when
the French exposition is also to be
held, and which may on that account
force upon the citizens of San Fran
cisco the propriety of holding their
fair in the following year, just as
the anniversary of the discovery of
America was celebrated in Chicago
in 1893 instead of in 1892; there
fore be it
RESOLVED, As the sense of this
meeting that a fair be held com-
memorative of the fiftieth anniver
sary of the admission of California
into the Union; that a committee of
fifteen be appointed by the Mayor to
devise a plan and submit it at a
meeting of citizens subsequently to
be called, and that they be given
discretion in determining in what
year it would be most advantageous
to hold such exposition and as to the
character and scope of the enter
prise.
"I think an exposition in 1901 will
go," added the Mayor. "We shal want
to get appropriations from the Na
tional Government and from our own
Legislature, however. The Omaha ex
position, to be held next summer, re
ceived over $200,000 from the National
Government, and if we could get that
amount we would have very little trou
ble in making a fine showing. The Su
preme Court decided not long ago that
the Legislature could vote funds for
an exposition. In order to get legis
lative aid we should get the movement
a-going. If we can show to the law
makers the value of such an affair they
may materially aid us.
"If we get national aid and legisla
tive aid we can send a ship to Paris
and offer to carry the exhibits of the
Paris Exposition around the Horn to
this State without cost to the exhib
itors, and we can hold a successful ex
position. I have another idea for a
fair site," he concluded. "I think it
would be a good idea to get some of
the sand hills by the ocean. The Park
Commissioners could cultivate that

for several days. ""I do not intent nam
ing any one," said he. "unless I am
certain that he will take an active in
terest in forwarding the movement.

Midwinter Fair was a success. The
exposition proposed by The Call should
be a greater one. Let us wait until
lflOl to hold our exposition, and I have
no doubt but that we will be success
ful. Energy and concentration of ac
tion are all that are required."
SUCCESS IS
ALREADY ASSURED
All of Our Citizens Should Take
an Interest in the
Exposition.
EX-STREET SUPERINTENDENT
ACKERSONâ The idea of holding an
NEVADA CITY WILL ALSO CO-OPERATE.
NEVADA CITY, Cal., Feb. 23, 189 S.
W. S. Leake, Manager Call, San Francisco â Dear
Sir: The Call's proposition of having a semi-cen
tennial exposition held in San Francisco in 1900,
to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the admis
sion of California into the Union, was brought to
the notice of the Board of Trustees of Nevada City
to-night, and the following resolution presented by
Trustee Carr was unanimonsly adopted:
Resolved, That we heartily approve of having a
semi-centennial exposition of the resources of Cali
fornia held in San Francisco in 1900, and w r ill earn
estly co-operate with other municipal officers in
making it a grand success.
Respectfully yours, T. H. CARR,
Clerk of the Board of Trusteee.
exposition in 1900 is a grand one.
Every public-spirited citizen should
take an interest in the movement.
There is no doubt but that with the
friendly assistance of neighboring
States we will be able to hold an ex
position that will draw the attention
of the world to the wonderful resources
delayed punishment on condition that
the persons he swindled should be re
paid.
A few months after that he was ap
pointed to the responsible position in
Judge Low's court. Attorneys who
knew of his unsavory record wondered
at Judge Low placing so much conii
dence in him.
It is common talk among Police
Court practitioners that the stenogra
pher is the intermediary between the
principals in the cases in courts and
the Judges. It is said that the prose
cution of a great many felony cases
has been dismissed in the lower court
on payment to the stenographer of the
amount his fees would have come to
had the person charged been held to
answer in the higher court. If the
Judge gets part of the money or not it
is a matter so f#r only of conjecture,
but it is the belief of those who know
the workings of the Police Courts that
the Judge and the stenographer divide
the fees. It is also said that cases
where stenographers are required are
disposed of not particularly on their
judicial merits, but so as to incur big
bills for the court reporter.
The Judge of the Court is the only
person in the civic government to
vouch for the correctness of the bills,
and should collusion exist between the
Judge and the stenographer the vaults
of the city treasury may as well be
without locks or guards as far as
they are concerned.
The City Treasurer has the record of
an incorrcet bill that was presented by
Stenographer Vernon. A long and im
portant case had closed on a Friday,
and the following Monday the stenog
rapher presented a bill indorsed by the
Judge for fees amounting to $3900. Au
ditor Broderick happened to be with
the Treasurer when the bill was pre
sented, and he asked Vernon. If he had
completed the transcript of the case
and placed it with the proper city offi
cial. Vernon replied that he had not,
but it would be ready in a few days.
He, however, said he was going on a
holiday, and he wanted the money. The
Treasurer refused to pay the bill until
the transcript of the case was com
pleted and on file, and when it was
checked up it was found that the sten
ographer was entitled to over $300 less
than the bill that was indorsed by the
Judge called for.
Auditor Broderick claims that the
bills of the stenographers on the In
dorsement of the Judges only are paid
contrary to law. The Auditor, in sup
port of his claim, quotes paragraph 274
of the Civil Code, which says:
In criminal cases, when the testimony
has been taken down or transcribed upon
the order of the court, the fees of the re
porter shall be certified by the court and
and products of the Pacific Coast An
exposition such as has Icon suggested
by The Call would prove of great and
lasting benefit to California and con-,
tiguous States. The Native Rons hava
been for a long time engaged in pre
paring for a grand celebration of the
fiftieth anniversary of California's ad
mission into the Union. That they will
co-operate with the directors of the
exposition and assist in every way pos
sible to make it a success goes without
saying. If the people enter into the
movement with the proper spirit suc
cess is assured.

BUSINESS MEN
Henry J. Seegelken Gives His
Views on the Proposed
Exposition.
HENRY J. SEEOELKEN of the
wholesale liquor firm of Seegelken &
Buckner heartily indorses the proposed
exposition, and gives his opinion that
it will be of untold advantage to the
State.
"San Francisco," said the merchant,
"is rapidly on the decline, and unless
it gets something of this character to
help it along there is no telling where
the present state of business depression
will end. An exposition planned on
such a stupendous scale as proposed by
The Call is bound to be of advantage
in helping and bettering the present
state of business affairs both in the city
and the State generally. It is sure to
attract visitors here, no matter how
much positive truth is expressed that
they won't come.
"The great obstacle that will have to
be contended with and a satisfactory
adjustment made before Eastern people
will come to this coast is the present
exorbitant rate of transportation.
These little side issues, I believe, could
be readily settled if the exposition were
once started."
paid out of the treasury of the county or
city and county In which the case is tried,
upon the order of the court.
That, he says, does not mean that
the provisions of the consolidation act
shall be ignored. Section 84 of that
act says:
Every demand upon the treasury must,
before it can be paid, be presented to the
Auditor of the city and county, who shall
satisfy himself that the money is legally
due and remains unpaid.
Section 87 of the same act says:
The Auditor is the head of the finance
department of the city and county and as
such is required to be constantly ac
quainted with the exact condition of the
treasury and every lawful demand upon
it.
"It is apparently the desire of some of
the judges." said the Auditor, "to escape
an investigation of their stenographers'
bills when they demand direct payment
on their orders. The law gives the judges
the right to draw the warrants to pay
their reporters, but it does not imply that
the safeguards now around the city treas
ury should be removed."

RECORD HOLDERS
NOT
ALWAYS WONDERS.
The way records have come down with
a crash it looks very much as though the
Emeryville track could hold most of the
American records if the management
saw fit. Nearly all of the best horses this
country has produced h#ve been sent the
Derby distance â one mile and a halfâ but
the 2:33Â»4 of Lamplighter withstood the
assaults for a number of years. It re
mained for Buckwa to gallop it off in
2:3214 In a race decided at the track across
the' bay on December 24. 1897. So easily
did the bay gelding accomplish the feat
that it looked as though he could have
traveled the route a second faster. The
grand mare, Fleur de Lis, later covered
one mile and a sixteenth in 1:46% so easily
that the American record looks at her
mercy. Judge Denny next comes out and
shatters the long standing two-mile rec
ord of Ten Broeck and Newton. The feat
of Lucretla Borgia, the game little daugh
ter of Imp. Brutus, when she lowered the
record for four miles over this same track
nearly a year ago, is still too fresh in the
minds of race goers to be recalled.
But record-holders are not always top
notchers. Lucretia Borgia couldn't lind
time to win an ordinary purse event ex
cept at long intervals. Mamie Scott,
which mare figures in turf history as the
holder of the seven and a half furlong
record, is a most infrequent winner. How
ard, the chestnut son of Tyrant, though
by no means a wonder, has to his credit
the mark for five, and a half furlongsâ
l:i>oâ made at lios Angeles on October 26,
1895. He has been behind the coin on sev
eral different occasions during the present
reason. Old timers will tell you "time
goes for nothing' âand bo it would seem.
When, asked nis opinion as to a prob
able winner of the Brooklyn handicap,
portly Bill Mr.rry. the Sacramento train
er, said that he thought if Ah Stemler's
great mare Fleur de l.is could be landed
in the. far East in bes present condition
she would be a bard one to beat. Bill is a
very keen judge of horseflesh, and his
opinion goes for something. The future
books are laying 30 to 1' against " the
daughter of the dead Maxim. The event
has never been captured by a mare,
which has much to do with the price laid.
Murry thinks the colt Michael 111. which
he sold to Charley Dwyer, is destined to
become the crack three-year-old of the
year. He has finished into a slashing
looking horse and is capable of shoulder
ing all kinds of weight.
wood stock Farm is indeed fortunate.
Charles Boots, one of the proprietors,
said the other day be already had eight
foals at the farm by Imp. " Brutus, of
which numlÂ«er seven were colts.
Ed Purser, whose extensive betting op
erations has made his tall figure a prom
inent one on all of the big race courses
has taken a vacation in the country
Thinking that he had "gone stale," Ed
decided a rest would enable him the bet
ter to unravel the knotty "dope" prob
lems so numerous and bewildering, to be
encountered the present season
After Thursday's tight finish between
Traveler and Trolley, Tod Sloan, who
rode the former colt, said that Conley
on lrolley was altogether too lovable and
affectionate, squeezing him against the
inner rail almost from the' start to the
head of the stretch. If Conley persists
in calling these sort of tactics into re
quisition .to land his mounts in front at
the wire, he will rapidly lose his popu
larity and should be given a long rest on
the ground. The puolic admire an hon

THE FIELD OF SPORT.
PROSPECTUS OF
EASTERN
CYCLE RACING.
Those interested in cycle track racing |
here have been very much at sea during j
the past few months regarding the con
ditions in the East, and whether the sport
was as little cared for as it is on
this coast at present. The reports we ,
nave received have been indefinite and it
is there fore, with a good deal of satisfac- I
tion that I am able to present an extract j
from a letter from an old-time San Fran
cisco racing man, wno has been in the
South and visited tne many Eastern and
foreign crackajacks now in training at j
Bellaire, Fla.
H. Austin Goddard of the Bay City
Wheelmen has been down there, and
writes me from Detroit under date of
February 20 .tne following interesting
epistle:
Have just returned after a pretty close trip
through the South, and the outlook for ISM is
a corner. 1 visited the crackajacks at the j
Bellaire track, and by present indications the
18%) season ol racing will be fierce and the ISSi
champion made ol iron. Kaser, the Swiss,
is a whirlwind, rides something like our "Bob
Terrill and L*hr, the German, will be hard to
beat. 'All the men there are in condition to
race at an hour's notice, but neither Bald nor
Uougoead has started training yet.
It seems to me, however, Ironi talks with the I
men and others Interested that middle-distance j
racing will be more the thing this year than
the old-time sprint race, and to that end men
like Karl Kiser. Nat Butler, Tom Cooper, I- red !
Hoyt and others are training- for that class or
the sport. Organized pacemaking teams will
be used and will be controlled by the National j
Cycle Racing Association, who are going to |
have regularly paid riders lor the work and
have an independent circuit of their own. It
is common talk that Bald has already signed,
but will not ride middle-distance races.
I suppose you know that "Old Man Pickard
has given up his position with Michael, who
will be trained by McLeish this season. Pick
ard Is doing well, however,, and may handle
Tom I,lnton and Arthur Chase. These two
latter men will give Jlmmie all he can attend
to when they get a well organized pacing team, ,
us you are doubtless aware all the difference
in the world is made by the clock-work pre
cision with which Michaels pacemakers work.
Some say the reason Michael talks about be
coming a Jockey is because he knows L.inton
and Chase can beat him when properly paced.
The Michael-Chase race in New York Christ
mas night was won by superior pacemiiKirn;,
and Chase hair the time had no paeemaKhiÃ

Four games of the Cycle baseball
League will be played to-morrow, two of
them in this city at the Velodrome
grounds, commencing at VI o'clock. The
most interest attaches to the game be
tween tne Olympic Cyclers and the Bay
City Wheelmen at noon. The Cyclers
lead in percentage in the tournament,
while the Bay Cltys have got to wipe out
their stunning defeat of last Sunday by
the Olympic Wheelmen or be practically
out of the race tor tiie pennant. The
probable line up of this game will be as
follows:
Olympic Cyclers. Positions. B. C. Wheolmen.
Boyle Catcher McGiilvray
Head Pl toher O' Toole
Cordes First base Menne
Fullanabee Second iiase Whaley
Custjrove Third base Commary
Bradley Shortstop Oi bson
Hildebrecht L*-ft neld T. Hull
Butz Center field Kanxee
Durham Right field Boeekman
This is a considerable change from the
usual line up of these teams. For the
Cyclers Follansoee has heretofore always
played behind the bat, and they will miss
the invincible Monahan at short, who was
laid off owing to injuries. The Bay Cltys
will put their ambidextrous pitcher, Mc-
Glllviay, in as backstop in this game, and
their regular catcher. Tommy Hall, Bald
by experts to be the best all-round player
In the league, will go out to left garden,
as his hand is badly swollen from the
last game and he cannot catch behind the
plate. With Menne in form again and
Commary able to play, the same old stone
wall Infield will be there, and this prom
ises to be one of the warmest games of
the season. . â¢_
The other games scheduled are between
the Acme Club Wheelmen and San Fran
cisco Road Club, which the latter should
win; between the California Cycling Club
and the Reliance C*ub Wheelmen, a gift
to the Californians; and between the Gar
den City Wheelmen and the Olympic
Club Wheelmen, from the result of which
latter game the Olympics will undoubted
ly be returned victors.
"The annual smokVr and jinks of the
Olympic Clnb Wheelmen will be held this
evening at the social hall. Alcazar build
ing, commencing at 8:30 p. m., and last
ing until morning. It is strictly for mem
bers and a few honored guests. The in
vitations are unique, consisting of a small
canvas pouch, presumably for tobacco,
highly decorated with likenesses of various
prominent members. The programme will
consist of a high-class vaudeville enter
tainment, interspersed liberally with re
freshments both solid and liquid.
Harry Monahan, the crack shortstop of
the Olympic Cyclers nine, will not play in
to-morrow's game with the Bay Cltys,
owing to a contused eye. Harry told Fred
Butz that he got it from 'a foul tip while
playing behind the bat in practice. Jimmy
Coffroth, on inquiry, was informed that a
fall from a wheel was the cause Hut 7.
and Coffroth met, compared notes, be
came suspicious at the varied stories and
started an investigation. Something about
Tuesday night, the Chutes, a lady and
two ruffians was the combined result of
their research. But the lady says Harry
is a hero, so there you are.
Frank W. Fuller of the Olympic Wheel
men is back from his Eastern trip. "Bob"
Lennle has gone south to keep "Pinkie"
Stoddard company. C. C Hopkins is off
the road for a while, and Thomas H. B.
Varney is away on a combined business
and pleasure trip to Honolulu.
The Imperial Cycling Club's tournament
begins next Tuesday night. President
Winslow would like to arrange some In
terclub games, and the Imperials' crack
team is open to a challenge.

The first game warden ever appointed
for Monterey County has just been
named by ihe County Board of Super
visors and will assume the duties of his
otflce at once. With the appointment goes
a curious provision, and one which makes
the affair unique in county annals. The
new warden takes office with the under
standing that should the board at any
time consider him a superfluous official
and request his resignation he will hand
it in.
The game laws have always been kept
in this county and no trouble was had
over them until recently, but during the
|.;ist year so many complaints have
reached the County Supervisors from per
sons who allege that young fish have
been taken from the streams and game
killed out of season, that the' board
deemed it advisable to appoint a warden
for at least a short period. E. IT. Godat
is the new warden, and he will hereafter
devote his time to keeping Intact in Mon
terey County the California game laws.
It is hoped that Sun Mateo County will
also appoint a warden. It is certainly in
need of one.

CHAMPION HANDBALL PLAYERS.
Masters of the Great Irish Game Will Arrive in This City Next
Month.
Phil Casey, champion handball player of the world; James Dunne, a player who has defeated several of the
high class athletes of the Eastern States, and James Dunne Jr., champion amateur handball player of America
wili arrive in this city in the very near future.
Phil Casey and his partner, James Dunne Sr., will make their Inaugural bow to the patrons of Ireland's great
game on March 17 at Phil Ryan's court on Howard street. Doubtless the opponents of the famous Eastern ball
smashers will be James C. Nealon and John Riordan, both of whom are very expert players, and should give eood
accounts of themselves, notwithstanding the fact that their opponents are thorough masters of handball as it is played
Possibly "Jack" Bonnet will muster sufficient courage to give young Dunne a race. A series of games betw*Â»A
"Jim" and "Jack" should prove decid 31y interesting, and it goes without saying that the young Eastern athlet
will meet in Bonnet an opponent who is a capable man In any kind of company. The arrival of the Invaders in
assuredly give handball a great impetus. It is a pastime that should have a laYge following In this city
COCHRAN AND
THE
COLLEGE MEN.
For two years the athletic managers of
California moved heaven and earth to se
cure the services of Garret Cochran as a
baseball and football coach. They now
have him, and he promises to institute a
revolution in matters athletic at the
State University, which will either be re
ceived with immense favor or disgruntled
dissatisfactionâ according to the pulse of
the student disposition.
Cochran Is no fence rider. He Is a de
termined young man with fixed ideas
about the fitness of things. He has seen
a system worked successfully year after
year, and is as positively assured of tho
fruitfulness of it as If it were an edict
from heaven. This system , this morale
he will attempt to introduce at Berkeley.
If firm conviction and absolute determin
ation count for anything In this worM,
the University of California, on Its ath
letic side, will certainly be metamor
phosed in a very short time. This means
a great deal. It is the Implanting, in ail
its various phases, of theathleticgeniusof
tne collegiate East. Cochran will be at
Berkeley during an entire yearâ time for
the consummation of his plans.
It did not take Cochran io.ig to pei
ceive the differences between the Kast
and the West on track and field. Looking
out of the window of his study .'n hij
Berkeley quarters, with the ram descend
ing in torrents, Cochran unloosed the
Kates of speech and spoke right on, tell
ing of his intentions, his hopes, aspira
tions and surprisesâ all in reference to his
new sphere of action.
"My greatest surnrise on- taking up my
abode in Berkeley and looking out for the
distinguishing characteristic of the Cali
fornia athlete was to find such an ab
normal lack of college spirit. Such a
spirit as exists in the East is unknown
here. Why, we men work and work un
til we fall. The honor of playing on a
Varsity team in the East is paramount to
all other eartniy glories, and for the
laurel we willingly subject ourselves to a
few months' sacrifice of ease and the
pleasure of the senses. I tell you, you
don't know what it is out here. Why,
the other day I went on the field, and.
what do you think, the entire baseball
team didn't show up. If anybody failed
to show up or: the moment out East,
without previously obtaining permission
from the captain, it would be all off with
him. He would be a mile up a tree. But
you can bet things will be different in
Berkeley in a short time."
So spoke the man with an Iron hand,
a man whom the Eastern critics say
is the greatest football general in Amer
ica. Continuing he said: "When T ac
cepted Manager Brown's terms I told him
distinctly that I was to be untrammeled
in my work; that I was to use my judg
ment and to form and use my own plans,
and I intend to do it. I came out here
for two seasons, to see If I could not
develop a winning team and to get away
from Princeton. Burning memories of
the Yule-Princeton game still cling to me
and I want to get as far from the scene
as I can. Now I want first to induce
in the California man a spirit which will
make him do something, which will make
him work.
"Another thing. I never saw Hero-Wor
ship so strong iind unalloyed as in Berke
ley. Solace, condolence for shameful de
feat is taken hi the form of admiration
for the superb efforts of one or two in
dividuals. Wp haven't individuals in the
East, we have teams. To rely upon a
single man is suicidal. We develop
teams, and that is what must be done
here. When we lose in the East we do
not care to be seen about for some time
after it. We slink about as if we had
done something mean."
Cochran Is determined to have his own
way ami he will have it. A new regime
is in store for California. Instead of a
weak, vacillating directorate, there will
be one man with ideas in his head and
a hand to rule. The dictatorship is what
is needed. Though a strong ruler, Coch
ran has already gained the good will of
the student body, the athletes and the
trainers.
Last week was a quiet one at both uni
versities. A wet field Monday, a holi
day on Tuesday and rain on Thursday
interfered with the traintng of the track
teams and baseball nines. Cochran had
the pitchers out, showing them some new
wrinkles. He finds the men very weak
with the stick and will devote much time
to Improvement along this line.
At Stanford the college nine was de
feated on Tuesday by the Alumni team,
which they will meet to-day at Central
Park. Stanford's baseball aggregation Is
sorely crippled. Loughead is suffering
from a painfully sore hand. Strohn is
disabled from the same cause. Beckett,
twirler of last year's varsity, will prob
ably occupy the box this afternoon. He
has not as yet been given an opportunity
this season. Who will catch for Stan
ford has not been decided as yet. The
team wearing the cardinal will have in
it a number of freshmen, candidates for
the varsity. The Alumni has not changed
its personnel except as to the pitcher.
Who will pitch the game for the gradu
ates is a matter of sore perplexity to the
captain of the Alumni. At a late hour
last night he was stiH hunting. The game
will, however, be played.
OAKLAND WINNERS
OF BASKET BALL.
Two victories have been won this week
by the Oakland basket-ball teams over
the players from San Francisco. The
Athens defeated the Business men by a
score of S to 6 and the Spartans defeated
the Lawyers by a score of 15 to 11.
The game between the Business Men
and the Athens was played on Washing
ton's birthday in the gymnasium of the
Oakland Y. M. C. A., and the result was
Quite a surprise to many of the specta
tors. The game was full of peculiar
events.
The teams lined up aa follows:
Business Men. Position. Athens.
F. M. Goodrich.... Forward F. J. Bock
Louis Titus Forward.. J. Lancaster
\V. Wilson Center W. B. West
C. Bexnhard Guard H. Muller
C. J. Auger Guard.. ..F. J. Edwards
Last Thursday evening's game be
tween the Lawyers and the Spartans
proved to be a close and fair contest.
Both teams entered the gymnasium with
confidence. The local team was very con
fident, and justified the expectations of
its supporters at least during the first
half, when the Bcore stood 7 to 6 in its
favor. A change, however, took place
when play was resumed, and the Oakland
team carried off the game with a final
score of 15 to 11 points in its favor. Zeihn
and Menzies played well and secured 10
points on clever goals, while Deby proved
to be a very useful guard for the Law
yers, and Oliver made 7 out of the 11
points for his team.
The following players took possession
of the floor when the game was started:
Lawyers. Position. Spartans.
D Williams Forward A. Caldwell
H B Ward Forward E. Menzies
F. S. Oliver Center O.
I J. Truman Jr... Guard C. Zeihn
W. Deby Guard W. F. Martin
Oakland has now won eight games of
a possible twelve, but the championship
cup will have to make the trip across the
bay quite a number of times yet until It
shall be awarded to the winning team of
the finals. _
HANDBALL WILL

Should the weather conditions on Sun
day prove unfavorable for outdoor sport

Good News For Richmond.
The directors of the L.lng Lun Associa
tion have at last decided to move the'r
cemetery from its present location in the
Richmond District to San Mateo County.
They have purchased for the purpose a
site directly opposite to Holy Cross
(Vmotery consisting of a half mile of
ground.
AFTERMATH OF
TENNIS
TOURNAMENT.
A large crowd and a long entry list
made the single handicap tennis tourna
ment held .at the California courts on
Tuesday last a big success. Of the nine
teen players entered but two defaulted.
Throughout the sunny afternoon brilliant
smashes and long rallies were greeted
with applause by the onlookers.
Joseph Hooper's fine showing was the
surprise of the day. Dr. Root played him
on even terms and succumbed to his
prowess. George Bradshaw, after con
ceding Hooper half fifteen, was also de
feated.
Owing to darkness the final match of |
the tournament between Bliven and Mc-
Gavin was not played; it will be decided
to-day.
J. Parker Whitney, uncle of the clever
players, Bob and George, is a tennis en
thusiast, and has arranged a doubles
tournament to be held on his grounds in
Loomis, Placer County, on the 19th of
March. He has offered a handsome silver
cup as a trophy and has issued invita
tions throughout the State inviting ex- I
perts to compete. George Whitney, Rob- j
crt Whitney, Walter Magee and George \
Bradshaw will represent the Callfornias,
and it is expected that a great -many of i
the athletic Englishmen of the citrus \
colony there will enter.
A great deal of credit is due Joe Daily
for his impartial handicapping in Tues
day's tournament. Only in one instance
was he at fault, and that was due to not
seeing the entry play in two years.
Miss Alice Hoffman, who has been
elected a member of the club, is a val- j
uable acquisition to the lady players. Be- I
sides being a clever golf exponent. Miss j
Hoffman is also a tennis expert.
A tennis tournament for ladies is con- '
templated for the middle of March.
The Pacific States Lawn Tennis Asso- .
ciation intends holding a tournament in ;
the month of June at San Rafael as a
preparatory step to the annual champion
ship match on July 4.
Sherwood Adams was defeated by Percy
Murdoch in their meeting last Saturday.
Adams bases his defeat on the poor light
at the Alameda court. As each player :
now has a victory, a final match would !
be an attraction.
Adams and Harry Weihe, known as the
Calif ornias' pony team, will meet Robert ;
Holmes and Percy Murdoch, Alameda's
champions, at the local courts to-day.
COLLEGE BASEBALL

ANOTHER LANDMARK GONE.
The Work of Demolishing the Old
Woodward Stables Bapidly
Progressing.
The work of demolishing the old "Wood
ward Stables at Fourteenth and Mission
streets preparatory to the erection of a
hospital by the Market-street Railway
system for the employes of the road is
rapidly progressing and now but a small
portion of the old landmark remains to
tell the life tale of thirty years ago when
its present site and for miles around was
nothing but a wilderness. With the tear
ing down of this building will fade the
last recollection of Woodward's Gardens,
and the old balloon cars which people In
those days thought it a treat to ride
in, coming from miles around to rattle
over the dusty Mission road in the bobtail.
Just what shape and what proportions
the new building will assume when com
pleted is not as yet definitely known, as
the final contract for its construction has
not been awarded.
The hospital when completed will be op
erated on the same system as that
adopted by lodges in caring for their sick
members. An employe of the road when
taken sick will be sent to the hospital
and there doctored and nursed, receiving
every attention, in fact, that a modern in
stitution of this character affords to its
members for the small sum of fifty cents
a month.

STANFORD BOYS
ARE IN
ACTIVE TRAINING.
The following communication from the
Stanford University will interest amateur
athletes:
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Feb. U.
There is plenty of activity on the track, but
as yet little systematic work is being done.
Things need direction and it Is here that tha
lark of a coach is felt. Most of the older
trackmen and a goodly number of new ones
are out and working along slowly.
In the 100 yard sprints Brunton and Rirrh
are easily the best men. Cantwell, Stewart and
Limons, all freshmen, are likely colts for this
event. Digfflefl, Karstod. Stout and Weather
wax are showing up well lor the 220 and 440
yard events. In Paul Walker. '9S, Stanford
has a trusty man for the quarter mile.
The distance sÂ«iuad is particularly large. It
Is led by Ererett Smith. Williams, Steele.
Dave CooMdge and H. Rote are doing good
work. Under the advice of Luther f'ary. the
Princeton crack* rjack, these men have been
doing less severe training. Work In the other
events have hardly begun, with the exception
of the hurdles, in which Pole. Morgan and
Culver have been doing a little something.
In baseball the team is experiencing a slump.
Fewer men are coming out for practice and the
right kind of spirit is not being put into the
play. A number of good men who donned suits
the first of the season, having despaired of
making places on the tenm so well decided
does the make-up seem, have ceased to ap
pear on the diamond. Practice under these
conditions is slow and unsystematic and the
work in consequence still crude.
The weakness of the 'Varsity was shown
Tuesday when the Alumni nine defeated it on
its own grounds by a score of 11 to 3. The
collegians could not run bases and were al
most sure to be caught out befftre they had
reached the third bag. In batting, little that
is encouraging was done. Krug, of the Cali
fornia Markets, practically had the Stanford
men at his mercy. A liability to make error*
at critical times was another characteristic of
the game put up by the 'Varsity. Strohn.
however, was not behind the bat nor was Cap
tain Loughead out. The loss of these two men
while it weakened the team, does not account
for the long string of errors made.
Ex-Captain Jeffs has announced his Intention
of coming out. His knee is much better and If
properly handled will allow him to play- In
the event of his tryine for catcher, his old
place, Strohn will probably go to third and
the Infield will be pretty well settled. Pitcher
is the doubtful place. The fight is clearly be
tween Lanagan. Hill and Beckett, with thÂ«
former in the lead. Hatting will be the chief
requirement for the outfield. Wright is per
haps surer of htn position in the garden than
any of the others.
The infield this year should be particularly
strong. With such men as Young. Harris and
Htrohn, if Jeffs catches, on bases, and Loug
heed at short, every inch of ground ought to
be covered.
STAND FOR PURE FOOD.
James W. Kerr Addresses the Com
ing Convention at Wash
ington.
On March 2 the National Pure Food
and Drug Congress â¢will meet in the city
of Washington and an invitation was sent
to James W. Kcrr, president of the Man
ufacturers' and Producers' Association, to
attend. The local board was very de
sirous of having its chief officer represent
it at the congresssj but hig business and
the shortness of the notice made this Im
possible, so he prepared a letter which
he has sent to be read before the national
gathering. In it he says:
The State of California takes a more promi
nent position as a fond producing State than
the number of its population would indicate. It
takes first place in the production of beet
sugar, wool, barley, wine and fruit, while its
olives and olive oils, its honey and its various
dairy products are ever increasing resources of
wealth and occupation. It is only natural,
therefore, that the subject which brings you
together should be considered of paramount im
portance by our pÂ« pie.
After briefly ri ewing the aims of the
â  association and what it has accomplished
, and a detailed account of the recent
j troubles growing out of the shipment to
I Europe of a lot of Nebraska corn juice,
\ under the name of "pure California
1 brandy," and the protection to the stuff
I by the Federal authorities at Washing
ton, Mr. Kerr says:
It must be apparent to all that laws which
are so powerful to protect fraudulent manu
facturers from State authorities, and yet so
feeble in che.kinÃ the consummation of a
; crime, or protecting- honest people, must be
i in themselves defective, and I would a.Â«k thi3
j Congress to endeavor to secure for State offi
cers some control over manufacturers In
I United States bonded warehouses; so that
when such frauds and Irregularities occur, if
they do not have the power to confiscate and
! condemn, as with outside manufacturers, they
can at least secure the detention of the goods
in warehouse or In transit until such time as
their true character can be investigated. I re
gret very much that we should meet with the
most effective opposition to our work at the
hands of the Federal authorities, and trust.
1 that you will he abli- to impress upon them the
i fact that the honor of our nation is not en
tirely bound up in the character of money wa
-hall pay to our bondholders.
Lobsters have a great dread of thun
der, and when peals are very loud will
swim to deeper water.

RIVERSIDE, Feb. 25.â An interest
ing session of the annual convention of
the Stat. Young Men's Christian Con
vention was held to-day. The attend
ance was larger than on the previous
days. The three principal subjects dis
cuss- 1 during the day were: "A Glance
Id," "The Physical Man" and
raia's Young Men." These were
divided into classifications, and each
..f the classes was presented by several
of th^ prominent delegates. Those who
conducted the discussion of the sub
je< t. "Physical Man," were L. C. Dale
of Stockton, who took up class work,
which, he said, did more than any
thing else to bring out the best points
of the young man.
Drs. H. L. Deitz and W. TV. Roblee, \
directors of the San Francisco and
Riverside organizations, respectively,
presented the outdoor feature of the
work of the society, which they claimed
was one of the things that created ,
the interest in the Young Men's Chris
tian Association. W. O. Black talked j
of the necessity for athletic work, and ;
said that it prepared the young man
effectively do the work of the society
along other lines' contemplated.
Probably the most interesting discus- :
sion which has yet taken in the
ntion was when the subject, "Cal
ifornia's Young Men," was taken up. j
The principal points were made by C.
B. Willis, secretary of the association '
at Milwaukee, who said that upon the â 
young men depended the future of the ;
country. Their influence for right or
wrong was a matter of great moment ;
ry citizen, and he knew that the
Young Men's Christian Association was
doing a great and good work by put- |
ling many young men on the right j
path. The speaker cited many in- j
ttances where the work of the society j
in shaping the lives of young men had i
b^en the means of doing the country !
and the public a great service. It j
should be the constant effort of every j
member of the society at all times, said S
to point out to the young man his j
advantage, for by so doing they do a I
public service. Influence was every- j
thingâ it either made or ruined the
man.
N. H. Jacks of Oakland closed the
discussion. His theme was "The Fu
ture of the Young Man," which, he
paid, was what the man made it. To
aid him to shape his life right meant
to shape his future. Start the young
man out right and he would remain
steadfast to early pious and good
training:.
To-morrow the members of the con
vention will be treated to a drive about
the city and valley by the citizens and
the local Bociety.

Ousted Teacher Asks for Dam

Denies tli<? Right of a Board of Educa-
tion to Repudiate a
Contract.
Special PlFpatch to The Call.
SAN* BERNARDINO, Feb. 23.â An 1m
::t case now being heard in the Su- ;
- Court has a bearing all over the i
It is one in which Miss May
Newell seeks to hold the Board of Edu
cation to a repudiated four years' con
tract.
About two years ago the Board of E<J
u< ation of this city employed all tearh-
Mier a four years' contract. Dur
ing thA following fall a new board was
ted, the members being the unani
mous choice of all political parties. It
was instructed against long-term em
ployment of teachers. The new board
vith the city tenchers and after a
conference all except the plaintiff agreed
their contracts. At the open-
Ing of the next school u-rm. Miss Newell
appeared for duty, but was informed by
the president of the board, J. W. Ste
phenson, that she was discharged. She
immediately brought suit for $1900 dam-
ages.
In the complaint these facts were !
stated, but in the answer the defendants
alleged fraud and conspiracy between :
three members of the old board and '
charged that the plaintiff was elected at |
the Instigation of a membeY to whom
she was financially Indebted, and that she
was wholly incompetent.
Judge Oster suggested from the bench
,11 such matter as the first two al- I
legations be stricken out, which was
done. The case came up on its merits '
on Wednesday and will last into next |
week.

On last Thursday night the residence

several overdue vessels from the north.
A terrific storm raged in Alaskan wa
ters for several days, and it was feared
that some of the steamships had met
disaster, with a probable loss of life.
Captain Charles Lundquist of the Noyo
brings down reassuring and positive in
formation. He reports that on Febru
ary 17 vessels were located as follows:
The Cleveland was at Skaguay when
he left, and will probably arrive here
to-morrow ot Sunday.
The Protection was discharging her
cargo at Dyea, having been thirteen
days on the up trip.
The Augusta was at Juneau repair-
Ing her boiler, having blown out three
tubes.
The Scotia was at Skaguay discharg
ing her cargo.
The City of Topeka was lying at Ju-
neau.
In coming south the Noyo passed
steamers on dates and at places as fol
lows: February 20, p. m., in Wrangel
Straits, steamers Oregon and Albion;
February 21, a. m., steamer Alliance in
Tonga Narrows, Hueneme off Black
Rocks, Rosalie and City of Nanaimo off
Green Isle, Del Norte at Port Simpson
and Signal at White Sand Island; Feb
ruary 22, a. m., tug Taroma at Green
Top Island, steamer Islander at Law
yers Island, Wallowa at Kennedy Is
land; February 22, p. m., steamer Dora
off Gibson Island, Edith at East Inlet,
National City at York Point, Czarina at
Camp Point, Queen at Kings Comb,
Lakme at Fraser Ridge; February 23,
a. m., Al-Ki in Millbank Sound, Pasa
dena at Bella Bella, Farallon and Bes
sie K. at Lama Pass; February 23. p.
m., ship Resolute at Alert Bay, also
four vessels and North Pacific at an
chor there; February 24, Enoch Talbot
in Seymour Narrows, Whitelaw at De
parture Bay and City of Seattle just
this side.
That makes thirty-one vessels, most
of which were bound north, that the
Noyo passed.
LOST Iff THE SURF.
Three Fishermen Perish in an Angry Sea
at Half moon Bay.
REDWOOD CITY, Feb. 25.â Three
men were drowned at Half moon Bay
this afternoon, their boat being cap
sized by the heavy seas. The news was
first given by three boys who were
on the beach about a mile from Half
moon Bay and were witnesses to the
catastrophe. They were watching a
fishing boat, not more than 200 yards
from shore, trying to beat its way
through the waves. In the boat were
three men. An extra large wave upset
the boat and the boys say that two of
the men immediately sank in the ocean.
The third man managed to cling to the
boat. He held on for ten or fifteen
minutes, but he too was finally washed
off and disappeared with his com
panions.
The boys watched for some time,
thinking that the men might possibly
succeed in reaching the shore. Later
the boat was washed up on the beach
and secured. It was a fishing boat
twenty-two feet long, in which were
nets and fishing tackle, and also a shot
gun. Nothing has been discovered as
yet which would lead to the identifica
tion of the trio. The beach is being
watched in the hopes of recovering the
bodies.
AMOS W. GABLE
YIELDS TO DEATH
Yolo County Pioneer Passes
Away, a Victim of
Pneumonia.
DrovÂ« a Team Across the Plains to
California in the Early
Fifties.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WOODLAND, Feb. 25.â Amos W. Gable
passed away In this city last evening, a
victim of pneumonia.
Mr. Gable was born In Ohio on Septem
ber 10, 1834. In 1553 he made a contract
with Harvey Porterfieid, by which the
latter was to pay his way to California,
and Mr. Gable was to compensate him in
work after his arrival in this State. He
drove a team across the plains, and, af
ter arriving In California, went to work
for Mr. Portorfleid and his brother, re
maining in their employ for live years.
At the end of that time he went to work
for himself, and in 1861 he was joined by
his brother, Harvey C. Henceforth the
two were partners in all business enter
prises and they made their homes to
gether. For several years thereafter
their lives were a hard struggle. They
encountered many privations, reverses
and disappointments before they securely
anchored the foundation for the fortune
they afterward acquired.
On June 4, 1574, Amos Gable married
Miss Mary Gottwals of Yolo County. The
union proved a happy one, and the fruits
of it have been four childrenâ one eon
and three daughters. The widow, the
mother and the deceased's favorite
brother, Harvey C, survive him. The
funeral will take place from the family
residence at 2 o'clock on Saturday. It is
probable that Professor A. M. Elston of
Berkeley, and old friend of the family,
will officiate.
Coursing Club Imports a Judge.
An Informal dinner was given last
night at Delmonico's by members of the
Interstate Coursing Club to E. J. Bull,
who will in future act as judge at all the
meetings which take place under the aus
pices of the club. Bull has been "import
ed" by the club to take the place of John
Grace, the retiring judge, and is said to
be one of the best judges of coursing in
the world. He left Liverpool two weeks
aeo to-day, and during the reason in
England has been judge at the two most
important meetings In that country, Alt
car and Ridgeway. He has also acted us
indue on the invitation of the Grand
biikV Alexis, at two of the greatest
coursing meetings ever held In Russia.
The following gentlemen were present at
the dinner: John Grace J . H. Rossiter,
j R Dickson, editor of the California
Turf : John Halton, and Ralph Taylor,
the celebrated slipper from Denver.
THE SAN FBAKOXBCO CALL, SATI RDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1898.
RAISED IN THE PULPIT.
Rev. John A. B. Wilson and His Son, Rev. Clarence
True Wilson.
Owing to the protracted illness of the pastor the pulpit of the Howard
street Methodist Episcopal Church will for the next few Sabbaths be sup
plied by one of the most eloquent young men in all Methodismâ the young
est ever ordained to the ministryâ Rev. Clarence True Wilson, Ph.D.,
son of the Rev. John A. B. Wilson, D.D.
The Rev. Clarence True Wilsonâ now in his twenty-sixth yearâ pastor
of a great church at Pasadena, where, last week, a magnificent new church
edifice was dedicated free of all debt. While assisting in these dedicatory
services the Rev. Dr. John A. B. Wilson was taken suddenly ill and is still
In a most critical condition. So the so,n comes to take his place. .*
The Rev. Clarence True Wilson has been in the pulpit since his four
teenth year, and from his seventeenth year intrusted with great church en
terprises in the East. He was admitted to the Wilmington (Del.) Confer
ence by a unanimous vote when scarce 20, and at the same time ordained
as deacon by Bishop Newman. At 22 Bishop Fowler ordained him elder.
Soon afterward he received a call from the Sixty-second street Church, New
York City, but was forced to decline the responsibility because of failing
health. He was then transferred to Pasadena, Cal., where his work has
been phenomenally successful.
Dr. Wilson will preach at both services Sunday at the Howard street
Church, and later, during his stay in the city, will conduct special revival
serviceâ a feature of ministerial work for which he has peculiar adaptation.

HE WILL TALK ON SILVER.
EX-CONGRESSMAN CHARLES A. TOWNE.
Ex-Congressman Charles A. Towno, the
great silver Republican from Minnesota,
arrived at the California yesterday, to
gether with his wife and sister and Nathan
Cole Jr., president of the Republican
Silver Club of Los Angeles. The latter
gentleman is also accompanied by his
wife.
Mr. Towne, who is a strong supporter
of Bryan, is making a tour of the West
in an endeavor to keep alive the cause
of silver, and to that end has been ad
dressing numerous audiences in the
southern part of the State, from where
he arrived in this city yesterday.

agement of the Thalia Theater to re
gale the patrons of the place with her
musical selections.
"When the Mining Fair opened she
was engaged to sing for one afternoon,
and signed a conrract to that effect.
Her extra engagement made her a little
late in reaching the Thalia, and the
proprietors, James ami Isidore
Schwartz, made objection to the mat
ter. The engagement was sudddenly
terminated and the Bareness now
claims that there is owing her $30 out
of the salary agreed upon when she
signed her contract with the music hall.
She testified on the stand that the
management had asked her to come to
the Thalia early, as three wealthy men
had called to see her, and she must do
her duty by the house. She said that
for her singing at the Minors' Fair she
had signed for $50, of which she had
received $30 from her manager and had
offered to pay a fine of $10 at the !
Thalia for being late and singing at
another place. It was bmught out that
she was singing under the name of
Miss Matthews, and that she had of
fered to perform under the name of
Baroness yon Zieba if she were allowed
a compensation of $200 p^r week.
The case resolved itself into a ques-
To-night Mr. Towne will speak in Oak

speak before a meeting of the silver
forces at Metropolitan Temple, where, it
is exported, AY. W. Foote will preside.
W. P. Lawlor, who had change of the
local silver fight during the last cam
paign, has the distinguished visitor in

appearances while in this city.
From here Mr. Towne goes to the in

will proceed north. He is fully persuaded
that Bryan is the one and only Presiden

tion of the contract signed by the Bar
oness, and was continued until this
morning at 11 o'clock, when testimony
will be produced by the defense to show
that the theater management carried
out its part of the contract.
The management of the theater
claims that it did not understand that
the engagement of the Baroness was
for one week only, and in the cross
complaint filed asked for $100 damages
for her failure to carry out their in
terpretation of the matter.
STOOD UP ON LONG BRIDGE.
Jerry Began's Experience With, a
Highway Robber While on
His Way Home.
Jerry Regan, who resides at Fourth j
avenue and Kentucky street, while on '
his way home on the evening of the
23d, was stood up by a footpad on the
Fourth street bridge. Regan was walk
ing across the bridge when a short-set
fellow stopped out from behind a wood
pile and dealt him a savage blow over
the head with some blunt instrument that
partly stunned him. When realizing that
his adversary was bent on mischief he
sought to give battle, but another blow
on the back of the head settled all the
fight that was in Jerry, and consequently
he tamely submitted to fate. The high
wayman understood, his business, for
without loss of time he went through
Jerry's pockets und much to his disgust
he was rewarded by finding 15 cents and
an old clay pipe.

% I have a friend, in fact he is my brother-in-law, who is the outside
man for a New York crockery warehouse, a sort of salesman, purchas-

of the stomach. When he woke in the morning there would be a -
gripping, a contraction, a tightness of the stomach, which,' he said,
seemed to be clogged with a slimy, phlegm-like substance. Carlsbad
salts always did him some good, but now he uses a Ripans Tabule. He
only takes one when occasion requires, just one now and then. When
this man, his name is Spalding, was asked to describe the effect of the
Tabule on him, he said : "Why, it brightens me up. It has an effect
like dry air; makes me feel something as I used to of a spring morning

EXPLANATION.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top fig
ures at station Indicate maximum temperature
for the days; those underneath it, If any, the
amount of rainfall, of melted snow In Inches
and hundredths during the past twelve hours.
Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; Isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and Is usually accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear or the Washington coast. When
the pressure Is high in the interior and low
along the coast, and the Isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain Is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is Im
probable. With a "high" In the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
In summer and colder weather In winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW TORK, Feb. "Ll.â There was a sharp
recovery Ln the prices of stock* to-day Sn which
the engagement of gold for Import waÂ« the
predominant influence. The course of the ex
ctuixucfi market yesterday foreshadowed th*
early Importation of gold, â  which is the direct
outcome of the stiffening In the rates for call
money. The amount of sterling exchange held
In New York Is variously estimated at from
$40,000,000 upward. A large part of It has been
used as collateral for loans and the large li
quidation of loans has released a quantity of
this exchange and brought it upon the mar
ket. In other words, the rise In money rates
makes It more profitable to bring home funds
which have been left abroad on account of the
higher rate hitherto prevailing there. The im
port movement of gold is likely, to continue un
less there should be a sharp advance in the
money market in London and Paris. The call
ing in of this country's gold credits abroad is
likely to put a stop tor the present to foreign
buying of our securities which has been large
of late an.l which continued even to-day. The
bears made an effort to retain control of the
stock market at the opening to-day by raid-
Ing a few of the specialties, notably Metropoli
tan Street Railway and Manhattan, but they
were unable to wipe out the gains shown in
sympathy with London. Trading was ner
vous during the flrst hour but after that the
upward tendency became fairly settled and
continued throughout the day with slight frac
tional I reactions, A distinguishing feature of
business was the large number of small lots of
stocks changing hands, reflecting a targe in
vestment demand. The day's highest level of
prices was not fully maintained, but net gains '
generally were from 1 to 2 points. Great j
Northern preferred gained 6 points on renewed I
rumors of a valuable distribution to-be made
to stockholders. The effort being made to ad
just rate differences on "Western and trans-
Continental lines was a favorable factor In the
market.
Money on call loaned at 3 per cent but later
became easier In response . to gold engage
ments. Rates were firmer in both the money
and commercial paper markets.
There was a sharp recovery In bonds to-day
in sympathy with stocks. Total sales, $2,

NEW YORK, Feb. 25.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: There was ;
an Irregular tendency In the stock market here
to-day. The activity was entirely centered In
Americans, and the buying here was consid
erable and Influential. It Is felt that if the
political situation improves the market here
Is likely to become better, as the recent slump
gave Just the opportunity desired by many to
lay In stocks. Prices olosed near the best.
There is no change In Spanish securities, al
though the Paris bourse was flat and mines

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
'- CHICAGO, Feb. 2S.. T ThÂ» opening tone
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1898.
In wheat was somewhat irregular. May
was quiet and weak and opened at %@
%c lower at from $1 034 to SI 03, and
selling down inside of a minute or two to
*1 ui!4, then rallying to $1 034. July was by
no ineiias steady, displaying the weakness
that the earlier delivery did. July opened a
shade lower at S^ig'SS^c, where It hesitated
for a short time, then slowly advanced to
904 c. Though news was of a mixed charac
ter, that having a bearish tendency was ap
parently given the most attention at the start.
Liverpool was considerably lower, though not
enough to cause much fresh selling here.. The
most important bearish news was the Argen
tine shipments which amounted last week to
l,4Uti,uCo bustfcls, which was far from bearing
out the statements that the exportable sur
plus of that country would not exceed, 24,000.
uOO bushels. After the .first minute or bo of .
trading, however, this sort of news was lost
sight of. The much more confident tone of
Wall street and toe prospects of delay In de
cisive action over the Maine disaster Induced
many sellers of yesterday to turn buyers, and
this demand exerted a favorable influence on
prices immediately. Fear of a buying flurry
which might punish shorts also caused hedg
ing by the more conservative bears. July de- .
veloped more strength than did May, and more
trading was done In that delivery throughout.
The Letter party probably accumulated 1.500,000
bushels of July during- yesterday's selling
Uiror, and the amount of bidding for that op- j
tion during the morning developed the fact i ,
that the market was oversold. It resulted in j
a gradual advance In July to 90% c, May mean
while getting to $1 03%. A long period. of dull
ness followed, realizing by smaller scalpers
causing reactions to $1 04 and 90 ! - 4 c. - Afternoon |
prices gradually tended downward. A sharp
break in California wheat at Liverpool of 24d .
was talked of a good deal and helped to start
selling again. July closed at 89V*@S9%c; May,
SI 034.
Corn followed wheat, May closing Vie lower.
Oats were active and strong early, but eased
off later, closing unchanged.
In provisions there was the same disposition
to cover stuff sold yesterday as In grain. Near
the close the market became weaker. May
pork closed 150 lower. May lard and May ribs,
24c lower.

CALIFORNIA RAISINS IN NEW YORK. :
NEW YORK. Feb. 25.â The Journal of Com- j
merce says: Competition of California products i
has reduced the outlet for many foreign goods :
of similar character, during the past year or !
two, and among once prominent articles of ;
European growth in this market none seems to i
have felt this competition more than ' Valencia j
Raisins, which." before ' the time when Cali- '
fornia Raisins became an important factor, '
were In universal demand in the United States, :
and which even for some time thereafter ' held i
an Important position . among commodities !
necessary to supply of trade. . .. . . ~ ; . . j
Recent statistics show to what extent lm- i
ported Valenc!as~have . been, supplanted 1; by I
cheaper California fruit from a . table pre
pared by Jaime, ,> Morandy & Co. of Denla,
Spain, giving the total shipments of . Valencia j
Raisins at that port from 1850 to date,- some !
interesting deductions may be drawn. In all
these years until 1895 shipments -to the ' United' â 
States and Canada were largely regulated â¢by ;
the condition of supplies in the primary mar- i
ket, there being no question as to the amount ;
required for consumption here. But from that >
time to the present imported Valencia Raisins j
have been gradually displaced â¢ by . California :
fruit, owing more, it is said, to low prices than :
to good quality of the latter. In 1894 imports
of Valencia Raisins at United States and Cana- i
dian ports were 133. quintals. The following
year but 59,806 quintals were imported. In |
ISO 6 the imports amounted to 83,726 quintals,
and In 1897 to 65,485 quintals, but it is under- I
stood that the greater part of the stock In both <
years went to the Canadian market. '." ,

FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, Feb. 25.â Bradstreet's Financial
Review to-morrow will say: Under the influ
ence of the Maine disaster the stock market
was unsettled at the end 'of last week. , Liqui
dation continued on Monday, the holiday on
the succeeding day creating a desire to cur
tail speculative engagements. ' On Wednesday,
in the face of heavy buying by London, the
market showed increased weakness and liqui
dation tendencies and continued this course
on Thursday, breaking' with some violence.
The hardening of interest under the withdraw
als of money for use in business at the In
terior and the consequent reduction of the
time loans added to the unsettled feeling and
the calling In of loans was among the chief
disturbing factors London was again a large
buyer at the breaks. Its total purchases in the
two days being estimated at over 100,000 shares,
though this was considered to be mainly spec
ulative and likely to result in selling on the
rally, which foreign operators believed would
ensue. Some large - Interests were purchasers
of the specialties, such activity being promin
ent in the Vanderbtlt stocks, in People Gas
and Rock Island and in the Pacific and Kan
sas and Texas. The bear people were, how
ever, very active In the progress of the de
cline and were rewarded with the forcing out
of a large amount of long stocks, through the
exhaustion of margins and the catching of
stop-orders.
Throughout the week the Traction stocks and
Sugar were especially unsteady and ready to
yield, indicating both that the prices for them
had been put to an unduly high level and that
their rise had attracted considerable weak buy
ing. Humors of all kind regarding alleged
discoveries about the loss of the Maine and
the probable effect on our relations with Spain
had free circulation and the market was too
demoralized on Thursday to take notice of
favorable circumstances, such as the drop in
exchange rates in response to the advance in
money here and the accompanying possibility
that p.ny future rise In Interest here would
have the effect of attracting gold from the
other side of the Atlantic.

BRADSTREET'S REVIEW.
NEW YORK. Feb. 25.â Rradstreet's to-mor
row will say: While business of a specula
tive nature has been quick to reflect the in
creasing strain In political affairs In .reduced
values and withdrawals of curtailments of ac
tivity in some lines, there Is little to Indicate
that the volume of distributive trade has been
reduced, and reports to Bradstreet's this week,
so far as the latter branch of business is con
cerned, are among the best received this year.
With few Important exceptions, the price situ
ation Is one of strength, while the enlarged
demand for coarse grains Is taken to reflect
the turning of . attention from high priced
cereals to those of a lower priced character.
I At the East last week's spurt in the dry
; good's trade at Boston does not seemed to have
, held, but at New York there is considerable
! more doing in the jobbing trade. The cotton
situation is one of firmness, reflecting a like
curtailment of production growing out of labor

! duced by good export demand. Wool is firm,
1 but the demand has perceptibly slackened, and
â  there Is less doing in manufactured goods. The
! best report as to the distribution trade made
: so far this year comes from the Central West.
; Spring trade there Is reported earlier than
i usual. . v, ,-.-;â 
Kansas City, perhaps the most important
â  market for agricultural : Implements, in â â  the
country, reports the demand exceeding all
; records. and pales limited only by the ' ability
ito deliver orders. The demand for Iron and
! steel at the West still continues large, and
] prices are firm. A feature or Chicago trade
i has been the placing of an order for 6000 ' tons
lof steel rails for a railroad In Alaska. Almost
I equally good reports rome from the . North
â  west, where trade is reported either fully
! equal- to or ahead of last year. The South
seems to have shared In the Improvement to a
notable extent.' The word Klondike accurately

I DTJjJ'S REVIEW OF - TRADE.
NEW YORK. . Feb. 25.â R. G- Dun '. & Co.'s
weekly Review of Trade will -say â¢ to-morrow: ,
; Foreign possibilities have much affected â  specu- |
lation and caused - hesitation >In * come targe j
business operation*,; possibly accounting In part
for a checl^tn the rapid advance of wheat, but
Industrial production % continues 'larger than j
, ever/ a - few .: more ": works being added to ' the
active list, with a decrease In the number of
hands on ; strike . and : renewed , evidence that
the volume of business Is larger than In Feb
ruary of any previous year. a- Nor Is there any
symptom of a senseless erase based lon I rising
prices. The legitimate > export and s domestic
demand ,;? preaiaa : oloew rto the capacity of
works, and though there is no flighty advance
in any : line, ana . in all narrowness of profit
in a matter of complaint; new business for this
dull season is unprecedented. : .. .......
v\ heat continued its progress upward * until
$1 06% was reached on Monday, but declined
3^c later, as if there were tears that Spain
would somehow stop British vessels from tak
ing wheat across the water.' Any yielding
based on foreign . possibilities deserves little
notice, but the price has advanced about 10c
since Chicago speculators last took occasion to
shake oil weak followers, and the opportunity
for reaction was inviting. There is no abating
i occ cVt" 1 ? 1 demand. .; Atlantic â  exports were
1.965.514 bushels, flour Included, for the week,
against 1,326,444 last year, and Pacific exports
1.5j6.3i(>, against 136,464 last year, and in view
or current - excitement these figures are more
,^? aoro?a or o?, nt v. than the aggregate for four weeks,
10,49b,912 bushels, against 6.588.415 last year
i.Â°i m i>Â« 1 i antic exports, and 4,053,028, against
1,011,246 from Pacific ports. Corn exports for
the week were 14.5 per cent less than last year,
but the cash price declined but slightly. The
spot price of cotton was not affected.
. It is not the season for much Improvement
in textile manufacture, but the cotton branch
Â£on*Â£i ned by the closing of the strike in one
xJ^X Ri y. er ' m Â»l and by the addition of some
works at the South.
The woolen manufacturer meets many can
cellations -especially in goods sold early with
out definite price, but is doing more than ever
at tnis season, though new business in the
higher grades of worsteds and woolens Is not
particularly encouraging. Sales, of wool are

HOPE NOW
PLACED IN
THE MAYOR
Declares He Will
Veto the Infamous
Water Rates.
Demand That He Revoke
the Appointment of
Woodward.
Oakland Realizes That There
Are Others Equally
Guilty.
THE FIFTH IS INDIGNANT.
Its Member Does Not Like to Be
Chased, but Says He Does Not
Know Fear.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 25.
Oakland Is resting to-day on the
water question, after the excitement of
last night, and is calmly considering
what can be done to prevent the out
rageous steal contemplated by a ma
jority of the City Council in the inter
ests of the allied water companies.
It is conceded on all hands that the
key to the situation Is in the hands of
Councilman Woodward, and every
means will be taken to try to prevent
his voting when the measure comes up
for final passage against the interests
of his constituents.
Several plans are being laid to bring
about this much desired object. It is
suggested that Mayor Thomas, having
made his appointment, can legally re
voke it. This argument is strength
ened by the fact that in the matter of
Police Judges Mayor Thomas has al
ready made and revoked two appoint
ments, and It is presumed he can do
the same with a Councilman.
There is at least a legal doubt re
garding the power of the Mayor in this
matter, but it is clearly the duty of the
Mayor to revoke the pernicious ap
pointment and let its legality be tested
by any one who dares to do so. If his
letter to Woodward yesterday be sin
cere, then it would be but a fitting ef
fort on his part to file a revocation, in
which event Woodward would, unless
too far gone, be forced to resign.
It was suggested to Mr. Woodward ;
to-day that a large petition from the !
representative people of the Fifth
Ward might be presented to him, de- j
manding that, having outraged them, ;
he at once resign. He was asked what
he would do under the circumstances.
He replied:
"I have gone through a great
deal. I cannot say It is pleasant
to be chased by a mob. But I
am a soldier, and fear is the last
element In my composition. I
have been crucified, burned up,
cremated, and it is unfair. I am
not alone in this matter, and am
not the only one that should be
made to suffer. I cannot antici
pate a petition from my con
stituency. But I should be very
careful what I did at this time,
when the feelings of the people
are wrought up by the actions
of those Councilmen who last
evening egged on the lobby. It
is time enough to cross the
bridge when I come to it."
When the ordinance comes up some
time next week for final passage there
is just a possibility that the point may
be raised that not having been passed
in the month of February it is illegal.
Ex-Mayor Chapman said to-day that
he does not think this point will hold
good, for the law says that the rate
must be fixed in February and this
has und' Ã¼btedly been done in the pres
ent instance.
The rate-payers have a final hope in
Mayor Thomas. There has been more
than a suspicion that the resignation
of Fibush, the appointment, the com
piling of the Henneberry resolution,
and the defense of Woodward, of which
he knev nothing till after it was print
ed, are *A part of the same job and
emanate from the same source. If
this be not so. Mayor Thomas has a
chance to dispel any doubt by vetoing
the ordinance after its final passage.
To-day the matter was placed before
Mayor Thomas, and he says that when
the ordinance come before him. he will
wind it up in short order, saying that
his veto would kill the measure, as
there are not enough votes to pass it
over his disapproval. There is, how
ever, some little doubt as to whether
the charter provision requiring the
Mayor to take action on each ordinance
is not superseded by the Snite consti
tution making it compulsory on City
Councils to fix the water rate and
which makes no mention of the ap
proval of the Mayor. However, it is
believed that if Mayor Thomas vetoes
the measure it will be a hard Job to
overcome such action in the courts.
There is somewhat of a decrease to
day in the volume of indignation being
hurled at Councilman Woodward. It
is recalled that there are others. It is
well known that for some time past
poor Woodward has been on the verge
of starvation. Not long ago he passed
through insolvency. Since then he has
had a harder row to hoe than ever be
fore. He executed a mortgage on his
house furniture and a few months ago
it was sold to satisfy the judgment. A
year ago he placed his library and some
of his personal effects \Â»ith a money
lender as security for a loan. He has
done practically no business for a long
time, and from being a man compara
tively well fixed he has come down to
the lowest of financial straits. Before
this man the bait of office, with its al
lurements, whatever they may be, was
dangled. People who knew his situ
ation played upon his poverty, for it
can hardly be called cupidity with a
man who hasn't a cent, and he fell. It
is not surprising that he did so, and to
day there is a feeling that the indig
nation should be directed as much
against the tempters as the tempted.
Where Woodward made his mistake
was in talking too much. Had he pre
served the silence of Councilmen Earl
or Watkinson his vote would simply
have been one of six, without any par
ticular distinction. As It was, as soon

ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
OAKLAND TURNS TO HER MAYOR.
as he was appointed "Woodward pro
claimed through the press that he was
"holier than thou." He was going to
do what was right, and altogether
created a very favorable impression.
No one now believes that he did not
know the purpose for which he was ap
pointed, and having placed himself on
a very high pinnacle his fall has been
tremendous.
He is not, however, any more de
serving of censure than Councilman
Brosnahan. Brosnahan is truly as
Mr. Cuvellier said last night, the
Brutus in the tragedy. It is not
reasonable to expect the public to
believe that his vote, which of itself
gives to the water companies at least
$100,000, was recorded solely from
pique because he could not pass his
liquor license ordinance. Mr. Bros
nahan is far too shrewd a politician
to have the impression go before the
people that he voted to rob them of
a huge fortune simply to gratify
personal spite on five members of
the City Council. The subterfuge is
too transparent and is regarded as
part of the same plot that put Fi
bush out and put Woodward in.
There is increasing indignation in the
Fifth Ward. It is customary when a
district loses its member from any
cause to listen to the representations
of leading party men in the ward and
to be guided at least partly by their
suggestions. In this case Mayor
Thomas showed no courtesy whatever
to the Fifth Ward, but with remark
able haste forced a man upon them
who could not now get a petition with
ten names to support him. There was
no necessity for Mayor Thomas' hasti
ness. Fibush resigned Thursday night;
there was no measure of importance
needing the vote of the full Council till
last night, when the water ordinance
came up. Yet Mr. Woodward was ap
pointed last Friday, and it is unlucky
for Mayor Thomas that it should hap
pen that Woodward was ready and on
hand to record his infamous vote for
the Henneberry resolution introduced
stealthily and without warning last
Monday night.
The Fifth Ward, if they believed it
would do any good, would to a man
sign a petition demanding that Wood
ward resign. But his actions so far
have not indicated that he has any au
thortty to speak for himself in the mat
ter, and it is certain that those who
tied him up are not going to release
him.
On Ninth street this morning there
appeared nailed to a telegraph post a
large placard. In the center of it was
fastened a foot of heavy hemp rope
about the size that Warden Hale oc
casionally uses. On top of the rope in
large letters was the following: "A
sample of one of the 'strings' that were
not on Woodward, but that ought to
be."
Underneath the rope was the follow
ing offer:
"N. B.â A full line of this sample will
be cheerfully furnished on application
by the indignant citizens of Oakland."
The sign was nailed to the post al
most in front of the office of "Benham &
Thomas, on Ninth street, and created
much diversio-n during the day. Not
the least significant feature of the
placard was that it was yellow.
This afternoon a number of the mem
< bers of the Army and Navy Republican
j League signed a call for a special meet
ing, at which they intend to voice their
| sentiments on the water rate matter,
i and, incidentally, to see whether some
I thing cannot be done or undone with
I Major Woodward.
Next Monday night the Council meets
again, but the ordinance will not have
been printed the necessary five days
until the following Thursday. In the
meantime, the citizens will take every
i possible measure to prevent that $100 -
000 steal.
Mayor Thomas was told to-night of
the opinion of many that he should re
voke the arpointment of Woodward,
and said 1' 'vas an entirely new idea to
him. "I cannot say whether I have
I that power or not," said the Mayor
"but if I have I shall certainly use it.
1 appointed a Police Judge and revoked
the appointment, but whether such an
action on my part will hold good re
garding a Councilman I cannot say. I
shall make it my business to find out
the first thing to-morrow morning.
"Regarding the ordinance passed last
night I repeat that I shall veto it. It
will come up for final passage next
week, and then it will have to come to
me for signature or disapproval, and I
shall veto it. I do not think there is
any way to pass it over my veto, for
the charter expressly covers the point.
"I cannot express my disappointment
of Woodward. He is a candidate for
Pension Agent in San Francisco, and
the petition that he sent to Washington
is the finest thing I ever saw. It is
signed by every city and county offi
cial, by every minister, by all the leg
islators from this county, by Superior
Judges and the best of citizens. Sena
tor Stratton was his friend in the mat
ter, and Senator Perkins had given him
much encouragement, but now all his
chances are gone higher than a kite "
This attitude of the Mayor's places
the water question in a peculiar posi
tion. Whether the Council, after the
veto, can start again to fix rates, Feb
ruary having passed, is doubtful. In
such an event the water companies will
undoubtedly try to collect rates un
der the resolution introduced by Hen
nebery last Monday night. Then an
other legal question will be raised
City Attorney Dow advised the Councii
that that resolution Is illegal, and
Hennfbery and the other five of the
"solid six" accepted his decision. Last
night to make their job secure they
took it section by section and had it
substituted for the committee's ordi
nance. Having done this, it has cer
tainly taken the place of the resolution
of last Monday, which was declared il
legal before passage.
Now with the ordinance killed "by the
Mayor's veto and the resolution de
clared illegal there are no rates.
It requires, under the rules of the
City Council eight votes to pass an or
dinance over the Mayor's veto, and it
is certain that no such vote can be ob
tained.
Thus it will bo seen that there are
several tangles to ne straightened out
before the extortionate desires of the
allied companies can be accomplished.

FREDERICK DELGER APPROACHES DEATH.
OAKLAND, Feb. 25.â After a long and successful life Frederick Delger'a
career is nearing a close and his physicians declared to-day that his recov
ery is very doubtful.
The old capitalist has seen seventy-six years of life and has been an en
ergetic business man for over half a century. His rise from the obscurity
of a cobbler to a capitalist was remarkable and was due to winning a for
tune by a lottery ticket many years ago. He invested it Judiciously and
being always careful he soon became a very rich man. He now owns more
Broadway real estate than any other one man, owns a block at Eight
eenth street and Telegraph avenue, where his residence is located, and is
a director of the Central Bank, besides having many other investments.
Mr. Delger. was taken ill last Sunday and since that time he has
steadily been grov ig worse. Dr. Burchard, who attends him, said to-day
that Mr. Delger is only rational at intervals and is suffering from compli
cated chronic ailments.
CAUGHT WHILE
MAKING LOVE
Two Society Youths Are
Arrested at Mills
College.
Taken in by a Constable and
Lectured by the Lady
President.
Now They Have to Plead fop the
Reinstatement of the
Fair Maids.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 25.
Two society youths are in a very un
pleasant predicament. They were ar
rested a few days ago while making
love to two of the prettiest girls of
Mills College. They were caught in the
grounds by the vigilant deputy con
stable that guards the interests of the
well known seminary and were
marched before Mrs. Mills.
The young gentlemen are Layton
Hooper and Will Mason, a brother-in
law of Cashier Garthwaite of the Oak
land Bank of_ Savings. The point that
is troubling these two gallants most Is
that the young ladies in the innocent
little affair are the chief sufferers, one
being sent home and another sus
pended.
Will Mason is every inch a gentleman
and on Saturday he went out to the
college, sought an interview with Mrs.
Mills and interceded loyally for the
young ladies.
"There was really nothing to com
plain about," said Mason to-day. "We
went out to that vicinity to visit a
friend. We saw two young ladies to
whom, in a manner I now forget, we
introduced ourselves and chatted mer
rily about the flowers and the weather.
Presently a constable came along and
Informed us we were under arrest and
marched us into the college, where we
Wi?re severely lectured. This was bad
enough, but we learned later that the
young ladies, who were two of the
prettiest girls in the seminary, had
been severely punished, one being sus
pended and another expelled. For this
we feel very bad, and I have pleaded
with Mrs. Mills for leniency, showing
her how unjust it is that we should
have all the fun and the girls all the
punishment, and I hope that they will
be taken back."
The incident is causing lots of talk
among the younger element of society,
which thinks it a great joke that
Hooper and Mason should have been
so neatly caught while innocently flirt
ing. _____^______ .-. â

SQUARE SPORT
Reliance Managers Are
Still Denouncing
Me Arthur.
May Insist in Future on Two
Judges Besides a
Referee.
President Fitzgerald Expresses Him
self Freely Over the
Job.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 25.
The unfair decision given at the Re
liance Club Wednesday by Bob McAr
thur may lead to a definite rule being
formulated by the club for the future
management of boxing events. The di
rectors are now discussing the advisa
bility of having two judges for each
contest, as well as a referee. There are,
however, some objections to such a
practice, and the club realizing the im
portant bearing, it may have on the
future of the sport will get the views
of other clubs before reaching a de
cision.
Just at this time, when San Fran
cisco is frowning on boxing events, the
Oakland clubs are being importuned
more than ever to permit contests on
this side of the bay. Very binding and
reasonable agreements have been made
between each of the two clubs and the
Chief of Police, which guarantee fair
and safe sport, but so long as the pres
ent method of appointing a referee is
followed there is danger of Just such
trouble as occurred last night.
"This is a matter which I feel I ought
to discuss and yet about which I am
rather delicate," said President Fitz
gerald of the Reliance Club to-day.
"It is a fact that the difficulty of get
ting a good referee is growing, and just
such affairs as occurred last night add
to that difficulty. Where the merits of
two men are almost alike a decision is
hard to give, and a referee in such in
stances has a thankless task, because
one camp of partisans is sure to hiss
while the other is cheering, and no man
likes to be hissed.
"I cannot, however, find any excuse
for tlie raw work of McArthur last
night. For a man that knows how to
box and understands the art such as I
know McArthur does, there can be no
defense or apology. It was a complete
steal from McCue, who had honestly
earned the winner's share of the purse.
Lawler, so far as I could judge, only
hit McCue three times during the en
tire contest, while I would not pretend
to say how much effective work was
done by McCue. Had the seventh round
lasted a few seconds longer I believe
Lawlor would have been put out com
pletely.
"We are now being asked to permit
many contests at our gymnasium, and
we feel that the sport should be en
couraged and kept clean. Our matches
so far have always been very reasona
ble and good sport. No one has ever
been hurt, and I do not see how they
can be hurt with the big gloves on
which we insist and the limiting of the
contest to eight rounds. It is just
enough to try two men out and as a
rule reach a decision. We shall not act
hastily in deciding how to- overcome the
possibility of such unjust work as was
done last night. McCue came to me
after the decision and told me that the
club should not suffer from such work,
because it was in no way responsible.
Both men gave me positive assurance
that the contest should not be delayed
because of the referee, and neither was
it. Consequently we did all that was
expected of us, but will do more in the
future if we can see our way clear.
"Such raw work must have been in
spired by something, and while I do not
intend to say what influenced McAr
thur, it is certainly a suspicious fact
that the betting in San Francisco was
all in Lawler's favor, and that his

THREE-QUARTERS
OF A CENTURY
Professor Le Conte Celebrates
His Seventy - Fifth
Birthday.
A Loving Tribute to " Professor Joe '
From His " Boys and Girls"
at the University.
BERKELEY, Feb. 25.â Professor Joseph
Le Conte. the venerable geologist of the
University of California, was tendered a
pleasant surprise this morning in honor
of his seventy-fifth birthday, by his uni
versity "boys and girls," as he affection
ately calls his students. Every year the
members of his class make February 26,
or the nearest recitation day to that date,
an occasion for giving to their beloved
"Professor Joe" a token of the universal
esteem and veneration in which he is
hefd. When Professor Le Conte entered
hfs lecture room this morning to meet his
class in geology, he found that hi 3 desk,
over which he has addressed class after
class on the absorbing problems of geo
logical and evolutionary science, had been
transformed Into a bed of violets and
blossoms. At the same time he was affec
tionately greeted by a roomful of students
in honor of his birthday. Reno Hutchin
son, on behalf of the students, congratu
lated Professor Le Conte and expressed
the wish that as the students became old
er he might ever become younger. The
venerable professor was then asked to ac
cept as a birthday gift a handsome li
brary book case, which had been draped
with garlands of smilax by the young
lady students.
Professor Le Conte was visibly moved
as he thanked the students for their re
membrance of him. "If I have been able
'to do effective work," he said, "later in
life than falls to the lot of most people, it
is on account of the sympathy and love
of my young students. Which has, I am
sure, rejuvenated me. Your speaker has
said that while the students grow older
with each succeeding year. I myself seem
to grow younger, and I sometimes really
feel as If this were so. If it is. it is be
cause of my sympathetic relation with
young people, which feeling has never
been stronger in me than it is now. To
feel companionship with young peopleâ
this it is that keeps the heart young.
"The. other day our Philosophical Union
discussed the Question, 'Is Life Worth
Living?' Surely, with the sympathy and
love that you young people show toward
me. I have found it so, and not only have
I found that it is worth while to live, but

that it is worth still more to grow olcL,"
At the conclusion of his brief reply, Pro
fessor Le Conte received the individual
congratulations of his young friends.
The esteem in which Professor Le Conte
has' been held for the nearly three decades
in which he has labored at the University
of California has grown to a feeling al
most of reverence. Scarce a student at
Berkeley fails to bare his head when ven
erable "Professor Joe" passes by. Years
have left their mark upon the veteran
teacher; not only has time whitened his
flowing locks and bent his frame, but as
he climbs from the lower campus to his
recitation room in South Hall he stops
oftener to rest under the old oaks. But
the kindly, twinkling eyes shine just as
brightly, the voice is just as vigorous as
ever. His labors at the university are
still extending their field. While he has
been relieved recently of considerable ele
mentary work, the scope of his advanced
courses has been widened. His newly in
stituted lectures on evolution have been
better attended than almost any other
course at the university, in spite of the
fact that credit for the wurk was pur
posely withheld in order to ktvp down th*
number of those who would otherwise
overcrowd the recitation-room.
Few lives have been devoted more use
fully to the course of science than that of
Professor L.c Conte. At the age of 18 he
graduated with tne degree of A. B. from
Franklin College of the ii'niversity of
Georgia. An inherited love of science, his
father, Louis Le Conte, having been an
enthusiastic botanist, and having built
on his plantation a botanical garden, onct*
considered the best in the country, caused
Joseph Le Conte to study medicine. 11l
1545 he graduated from the College or
Physicians and Surgeons of New York.
For five years he practiced medicine in
Macon, Ga., near which the Le ContÂ»
home still stands.
Acquaintance and friendship with the
famous Professor Louis Agassiz turned
his attention more closely to the subject
of geology, and in 1851, with Protessor
Agassiz, ho made a careful study of the
coral reefs and keys to Florida. From
1852 to 1856 he occupied the chair of geolo
gy and natural history in the University
of Georgia. For the following six years_
he held a similar chair in the College of
South Carolina, until it was disbanded
on account of the breaking out of the
Civil War. In 1868 Profespor Le Conte
and his brother, Professor John Le Conte,
four years his senior, received a call
from the University of California, and
from 1869 to 1891, when Professor John Le
Conte died, the two brothers labored in
the field of science side by side, "Pro
fessor Joe" devoting his attention more
especially to geology and zoology and
Professor John to physics.
Professor Le Conte has written a num
ber of books of first rank in scientific
literature. Many honors have been be
stowed upon him by various colleges,
among them the degrees of A. M. and
LL.D. from his alma mater, the Univer
sity of Georgia, and the degree of B. S.
from Harvard College. At present, be
sides occupying the chair of geology and
natural history at Berkeley, Professor Le
Conte holds the title of honorary profes
sor of biology in the college of dentistry
and special lecturer in the veterinary de
partment.

FOOLED THEM
Developed Lameness in
Â° His Preliminary, but
Won Cleverly.
Four Favorites Failed to Navi
gate Through the Sloppy
Going,
v
"Mocorito in Front at Good Odds.
George Lee Finished First in
the Mile Handicap.
It often happens that lame horses prove
very remunerative ones to bacK. Buch
was the case with Collins, a starter In
the mile and a sixteenth selling run J
at Ingles'de yesterday. The brown
gelding opened equal choice in the bet
ting with Souffle, but in his preliminary
gallop showed signs of lameness, and
the crowd soured on him. Even his
owner. Dr. Rowell. was compelled to
pass him up. and so informed the
judges. Souffle was then rapidly played
down to 4 to 5. Receding to 5 to 2, j
Collins went out in front, with Jones '
on his back, and was never headed, j
winning cleverly from Little Cripple. !
To make matters still worse for his
owner. Al Smith, the owner of Little
Cripple, boosted the winner $300 over
hie entered selling price of $400.
The favorites were in good demand
throughout the afternoon, but played in
hard luck, two of them only managing
to finish in front. The track was still
sloppy, which proved beneficial to the
peg-legged division.
In the rush to get aboard Ezell's Oc
turuck in the opening five and one-half
furlong sprint for maiden three-year
olds, the other starters were over
looked. Mocorito, an Bto 1 choice, rid
den by Eddie Jones, led all the way,
winning, ridden out, from the second
choice, Aprona, with Sloan in the sad
dle. Octuruck, backed from threes
down to 8 to 5 favoritism, was away
from the post badly and ran unplaced.
With Mercutlo, Harry Thoburn an<l
Greyhurst scratched from the mile
purse event. Geyser went to the post a
1 to 3 chance, and won, under re
straint, from Orimar. Red Glenn eas
ily took the show from Devil's Dream.
Roulette Wheel, with Thorpe in the
saddle, took the second five and one
half furlong scramble at odds of 3 to 1.
Flandes was sent to the post favorite.
Xiihau, a 30 to 1 shot, gave the Wheel
a hard rut at the end, but Thorpe final
ly got her over the winner by less than
a length. The favorite was an indif
ferent third.
Caldwell's bungling work with the !
barrier at the start in the mile handi
cap contributed to the defeat of the 7
to 5 favorite, Fonsovannah, with Thorpe
up. With half of the bunch pulling up |
the starter pulled the lever, and the
chances of Fonsovannah were ruined
by colliding with Los Prietos. Blarney
stone, away first, led to the stretch, j
where Sloan, on the Corrigan entry aÂ«Â»- !
sumed the lead, winning, hard ridden i
at the wire from Bonita.
Old Refugee was a 1 to 2 chance for
the final six furlong affair, and only !
won by the narrowest of margins. Pat
Murphy hooked up with him in the
stretch, and in a hard drive was beaten
out but a short head. Don Fulano
away badly to a straggling start, ran
a great race, finishing a good third

MUNICIPAL LEGISLATORS.
Police Department and Liquor-Deal
ers Occupy the Attention of the
Charter Framers.
The charter framers devoted last even
ing's session to the consideration of the
Police Department and the governing of
the liquor question.
Section 1, which provided for four Com
missioners and the Chief to make the
fifth, was defeated, and after consider
able debate the section was amended to
have but three Commissioners â one to re
tire every year after the first appoint
ment. This provision will make it im
possible for any one Mayor to have the
appointment of more than one Commis
sioner during his term.
The age at which officers are to be ap
pointed to the force was raised from 21 to
25 at the request of Freeholder Sachs,
who argued that a man at the age of 21
lacked sufficient judgment to discriminate ,
as to the power of his duties.
It is made compulsory upon every mem
ber of the force, including the Commis
sioners, to reside in the city and county. â¢
and also to refrain from taking any part
in politics. The sessions of the Commis- |
sioners must be public, and all votes must \
be cast as "yes" and "no," with a record :
kept of such votes, the same to be open ]
to public inspection.
The section dealing with the liquor I
question was adopted as follows:
"To grant permits to all persons desir- !
ing to engage in the sale of liquor in less !
quantity than one quart, and to revoke ;
any such permit when it shall appear to ,
the board that the business of the person !
to whom such permit was given is con- i
ducted in a disorderly or improper man
ner. If the board refuse to grant such j
permit, or propose to revoke any permit j
that has been granted, the person who is
refused such permit, or whose permit it
la proposed to revoke, shall be entitled to i
be heard before the board in person, or j
through counsel, and to have, free of
charge, all reasonable facilities for the
hearing on his right to have or retain i
such permit. It shall not be lawful for |
any person to sell liquor in less quantity
than one quart in the city and county j
without the permit hereby provided for. j
Such permits must not be granted for ;
more than three months at one time, and
they shall distinctly state the name of
the person to whom the same is given I
and the description of the premises where I
such business is to be carried on. Such I
permits shall at all times be subject to !
inspection by any member of the depart
ment. Complaints to revoke permits
granted by the board must be in writ
ing, signed by the person making the
same and filed with the clerk of the
board; and a copy thereof certified by the
clt-rk must be served upon the party
complained against at least five days be- j
fore the time set for the hearing of the i

CUTTING DOWN
LIGHT EXPENSES
Supervisors Trying to
Prevent a Big Deficit
in Funds.
The City Hall Departments
Must Be More Careful
in Future.
Gas Inspector Taylor May Be Called
Upon for an Explana
tion.
The finance committee of the Board
of Supervisors has decided to adopt
rigid measures to prevent the threat
ened shortage in the city finances.
Supervisor Rottanzi, chairman of the
finance committee, held a conference
yesterday with Supervisor Kivers.
chairman of the street lights commit
tee, in reference to stopping the unnec
essary use of gas in the City Hall. This
item of expense amounts to about $2250
per month, and has caused certain offi
cials a disturbance of mind for years
past. It is known that in certain offi
ces gas in large quantities is used
where there is no necessity for the il
luminant, and that if proper supervi
sion over the matter were exercised the
bills for gas could be materially re
duced.
The fact that gas is burned continu
ally in the sub-basement of the City
Hall has been a matter of comment to
those who have supervision over the
city finances, and numerous efforts
have been made to stop the leak. Un
til the present time, however, no prog
ress has been made. The two supervis
ors called on the Chief of Police yes
terday to ascertain whether it was nec
essary to keep numerous gas jets burn
ing in the shooting gallery of the po
lice department. The Chief was ncrt
aware that such was the practice, and
promised to look into the matter at his
earliest opportunity.
Tax Collector Block was also seen and
asked to look into the use of gas in his
office. It had been represented to- the
committee that gas was burped there
as late as 11 o'clock in the morning,
when daylight should have answered
all purposes.
The report of the Board of Supervis
ors will probably call attention to the
fact that Gas Inspector Taylor, former
ly a member of the board, has not at
tended strictly to his duties, and that
gas has been permitted to burn in the
street lamps at times when the board
had decided economy demanded that
they be shut off. It is expected that by
curtailing expanses in this direction
nearly $1000 per month will be saved
by the city government.

A FUND WITHOUT STRINGS
â¢Great Progress Made in the Pro

Victims.
There is a great denl of interest in
the proposed benefit for the survivors
of the Maine disaster on Monday, ar
ranged by the directors of the Miners'
Fair.
From all signs it will be one of the
most successful events in the history
of the city, as there is a great feel
ing of patriotism all over the State.
N"t only are there likely to be thou
sands in attendance from the city, but
the orders from outside districts are
unusually large.
Everybody should remember that all
the proceeds of Monday are to go for
the benefit of the survivor? of the
Tickets for the benefit concert for the relief of the' relatives of those
â who perished on the Maine are for sale at The Call business office. All
who desire to show their patriotism will do well to spend what they
can afford in this just and patriotic cause. All the proceeds of Mon
day's exercises at the Pavilion will go to the immediate relief of the
families of those who perished. Money thus expended will not go to
the building of a monument to be erected in the indefinite future, but for
the Immediate relief of sufferers.
Maine disaster. There will be no
strings on the fund and there will be
no sideshow in the nature of a big ad
vertisement for a yellow newspaper.
The arrangements for entertaining
the thousands who will visit the Pa
vilion on Monday give indications that
in all ways the 25 cents expended for
an admission ticket will be a wise in
vestment. In addition to the usual
band concert, both afternoon and
evening, by Rogers' band, there will be
a programme of singing, declamation
and addresses given in the Art Gallery
and two very novel and original acro
batic acts on the main floor, between
3:30 and 4 o'clock.
At night the principal feature will
be the first representation in this city
of the musical and spectacular produc
tion, "The Battle of Winchester," the
arrangement of the music having been
made two years ago by the great band
master, Sousa, and rearranged for this
occasion by Rogers. The musical por
tion of the programme is under the
direction of a representative from
General Shafter's staff, and every
detail of camp life and military ma
neuvers will be faithfully depicted by
the United States regular corps, and
by militia organizations. The synop
sis of the spectacle is as follows:
Synopsis â The camp at twilight.
"Tenting on the Old Camp Ground."
Taps. Lights out. "The Soldier's Fare
well." The alarm. Assembly. Off to the
battle. The battle. Victory. Return
by railroad. Home again. Grand an
them, "America." Chorus by children
from the Franklin Grammar School.
Richard Faulkner, superintendent;
Jane Seymour Klink, directress.
In putting before the public the old
familiar melodies, "Tenting on the Old
Camp Ground," "The Letter From
Home," "The Soldier's Farewell" and
those airs and melodies which recall
not only to the veteran, but to his
sons and grandsons, the stirring days
of the civil Â«war, divested of course of
its horrors and sad recollectionsâ that it
is a fitting production for the occasion
of a benefit to those who were either
killed or wounded is undeniable. In
itself it would possess sufficient attrac
tions to merit the expenditure of the
admission price asked, and combined
with the fact that it is in "sweet char
ity's" cause, the biggest attendance of
the entire Mining Fair, or, in fact, of
any exposition ever held in the Me
chanics' Pavilion, is almost assured.
From the members of the distributing
committee come cheering words, as fol
lows: T. J. Parsons â Over fifty tickets
Bold up to noon to-day, and still selling.
President Denickeâ Tickets are selling
to exceed our expectations, and we are,
very fortunately, receiving letters from
out of town, asking us to mail them
tikets, at the rate of about 100 a per
eon. Professor Martin Kellogg of the
University of Californiaâ Send me 100
tickets. They are selling well. Tirey
L. Ford â I have run out of my quota of
tickets and want more. L. W. Buck
leyâl sent 400 tickets to Sacramento by
O. P. Dodge, a well-known business
man of that city, with the assurance
that all the tickets will be sold.
In the way of the auction of goods
which Chairman Parsons and his com
mittee have solicited, it has been very
wisely postponed until the last night of
the fair, in order that they may receive

more contributions and make a grand
success of it. The reports of articles
given show that they go from the sub
lime to the ridiculous, but they are pre
cisely what the committee want. The
circular sent out is as follows:
The management of the Golden Jubilee
Mining Fair has determined to set apart
the net proceeds of the ticket office next
Monday, February 28, for, the benefit of
the families of those who lost their lives
by the Maine disaster. In order to add
something to the amount that may thus be
realized, a committee has been appointed
to secure contributions of articles to be
auctioned off on tk" last Saturday of the
Fair, the total returns from the sale to be
appropriated to the same charitable and
patriotic purpose.
Any contribution will be welcome, from
a cake of soap to a case of fruit, from a
pocket handkerchief to an overcoat, from
a paper of tacks to a sewing machine,
from a pound of candy to a barrel of
sugar.
\Ve hope that all who are solicited will
contribute some item to this laudable
cause. You are invited to give some
thing; we leave it to your judgment and
well-known generosity to determine what
that something shall be.
Our solicitor will call on you within a
day or two for your reply to this note,
and assuming that it will be favorable, a
collector appointed by us will subsequent
ly be authorized to receive and deliver
your contribution at the Mechanics' Pa
vilion in time for saiil auction sale.
The press of the city and State is with
us in this move, and we are assured that
all contributions will be duly credited in
the public print. When the sale takes
place the auctioneer will announce the
donor of each articlf as it is offered.
Trusting you will enter with us into the
spirit of this movement, which calls for a
hearty response from every patriotic
citizen, I have the honor to remain for
the committal 1 .
Major Wallis of the committee re
ports that he has been given articles
ranging from a tin cup to a horse. One
of the prominent butchers of the city
has given him two fat pigs and a coop
full of chickens. The Del Monte Mill
ing Company, of which Mr. Parsons,
chairman of the committee, is presi
dent, will sell all the packages of
cereals and flour, embracing something
like $60 worth, now in their booth at the
mining fair, on the last night of the
fair, all the proceeds to go to the fund
of the benefit.
Some of the mining counties are con
tributing some very valuable specimens
of gold-bearing quartz to be sold for
the fund. One of the big stove com
panies has given a fine range; in fact,
the interest in the benefit is awaken
ing to an extent which promises to
make it financially, socially and in
every way a success. Several of the
theatrical companies have volunteered
programmes and to send artists for
that night.
The Pavilion will be open on Monday
from 10 a. m. to 5 p. m. and from 7:30
to 10:30 p. m., with the admission as
usual, 25 cents and 15 cents. The in
tenor will be decorated in red, white
and blue, and addresses will be de
ll Yer if d ,, from the sta^ e in the center of
the hall.
A large picture, or painting, of the
battle-ship Maine, with the national
colors entwining it and draped with
mourning emblems of black, will oc
cupy a place of prominence in the art
gallery for that evening.
The Naval Reserve has been in
vited to be present and give a drill
Representatives of the Seamen's Union
and other associations of a similar
character have been invited to be pres
ent also. Mayor Phelan will make a
few remarks for the occasion.
The Amateur Academic League of
California gave a most creditable ex
hibition at the fair last night. The
two events that pulled off were: The
fifty-yard dash and the pole vaulting
The Lowell, Berkeley and Oakland
contingents were out in force and
they kept everything lively with their
cheering and counter cheering.
The fifty-yard dash was run in
heats between the different contest
ants, and a final heat was run be
tween the two winners and second
men of the two first heats. The result
was: A. Aberdi, first; F. S. Riccomi
soeond, and William Jacobs, third.
Time, 6 1-5 seconds.
The pole vaulting between Rich
Nicholson and Harry J. Irwin was won
by the latterâ height, 9 feet and 1%
inches. Nicholson at first looked as
if he would win, but he weakened per
ceptibly after the 9-foot mark was
reached.
Prior to the athletic events there was
a drill by the cadets of the Lowell
School under the command of Cadet
Captain Bartlett. The three events
that will be completed by the league
to-night are: The broad running jump
running high jump and the three
standing jump.
To-day will be Stanford day at the
fair, and the college boys will make
things lively. An address will be de
livered by one of the professors of the

PASSING OF A GREAT BALL-PLAYER
TOM POWER DIES AFTER A LONG ILLNESS,
Tom Power died of consumption yesterday at his mother's home at 2545
Folsom street.
Although his death was inevitable, as the dreadful malady had a strong
hold on his system, yet his many friends had hoped that he might be
spared for many months to come. The news of his death will be received
with regret by them, as a more popular fellow never lived.
Tom was known to every one. His fame as a ball player had spread
throughout the United States, and he had made a name in his chosen pro
fession for skill and straight dealing.
Power started his career as a player with the old Pioneer team in ISB6,
playing first base, when that team was under the mana^mpnt of Mike
Finn. He continued with the team during the season of 1887. when he joined
the Altas. After playing through a season with the nine Finn, who then
had the management of the San Franciscos, knowing his value as a first
base man, hid for him and obtained his services. He was given the cap
taincy of the team, and by a thorough knowledge of the game brought it to
a high state of perfection.
He played with the San Franciscos during the season of ISS9, and won
the name of being one of the best first-base men in the country. Manager
Hank Harris of the Stocktons, knowing his worth, made a dicker with Finn,
whereby he gained Power in exchange for Charley Sweeney and Milt White
head.
Playing against his o. ' chums did not prevent him from "xhibiting the
same vim which characterized his work while a member of tht 1 Friscos.
At length his ability as a ball player attracted the attention of Billie
Barnie, the famous manager of the Baltimores, and in IS9O he was engaged
to play the initial position for that great team. Up to 1596 ho played with
the Rochester, Scranton and other important Eastern aggregations. During
the season of 1896 he contracted a cold, which later developed tuberculosis.
He returned home that year and lingered until yesterday, when he passed
away.
Tom Power enjoyed the distinction of captaining c- cry nine he played
with, an honor that is rarely experienced by any player.
He was born in this city twenty-nine years ago. and as a member of
Precita Parlor No. 187. Owing to the absence of a brother from the city
the funeral will not take place until Monday next. The pallbearers will
probably be fellow players and members of his parlor.
BESOUGHT COD
TO BE MERCIFUL
Mrs. Cotter, Murderer of
Her Husband, Goes
Insane.
While Brooding Over Her Aw
ful Crime She Loses
Her Reason.
She Imagines That Her Enemies
Are Determined to Punish
Her.
Mary Cotter, who shot and killed
her husband several years ago, is a
raving maniac. Last night she was ar
rested by Police Officer Donovan and
locked up in a padded cell in the Re
ceiving Hospital.
Cotter was a policeman. In a fit of
jealous rage his wife shot him in the
back, inflicting a wound from which
he died a short time afterward. She
was tried for murder, but was acquit
ted by a jury in the Superior Court.
She claimed at the trial that he first
shot at her, and to protect her life she
killed him.
Since then the woman has been living
at 108 Ninth street. Last evening she
became violently insane, and one of the
lodgers, fearing she would injure her
self, summoned Officer Donovan. The
latter on entering her room found the
unfortunate woman In a kneeling pos
ture on the floor, her hands clasped in
prayer. She was beseeching the Al
mighty to forgive her for the killing
of her husband.'
"I murdered him, I know," she piti
fully exclaimed, "but, Lord, do not
condemn me.
"Open the pearly gates and allow me
to enter. I have sinned, thou Heavenly
Father, but be merciful."
Mrs. Cotter was only half-clad, and,
as she remained kneeling, her long,
dark hair hanging down her back, she
presented a striking picture. After
considerable trouble she was persuaded
to dress herself.
She was then taken to the Receiving
Hospital in the patrol-wagon and
placed in a padded cell.
The surgeons at the hospital, after a
cursory examination, pronounced her
hopelessly insane. To-day she will be
taken before the Commissioners of
Lunacy to be examined.

TOOKE OBJECTS
TO CHINESE
He Is Locked Up in a
Cell With Several
Highbinders.
Claims That Captain Robinson
Is Discriminating Against
Him.
Makes an Appeal to Chief Leas to
Remove His Mongolian
Associates.
I. N. Tooke, who was arrested seve
ral days ago for obtaining diamonds
under false pretenses, objects to being
locked up in a cell with two China
men.
Last Thursday night Captain Rob
inson, who has charge of the City
Prison, for some reason which he re
fuses to divulge, had two highbinders
thrown into the cell occupied by Tooke.
This is the first Instance in the his
tory of the Police Department where
a white prisoner has been compelled
to share his cell with Chinese crooks.
There are two cells set apart for Chi
nese criminals, and notwithstanding
that they are at present unoccupied.
Captain Robinson has seen fit to make
Tooke's stay in the City Prison almost
unbearable by compelling him to as
sociate with two Mongolian despera
does.
Tooke Intends to appeal to the Chief
of Police to have the Chinamen re
moved to another cell.
Since the filing of the suit against
Detective ODea of the Southern Sta
tion by a saloon keeper for false Im
prisonment, Chief Lees has instructed
the prison keepers not to "small book"
a prisoner unless by his orders. Re
cently a number of complaints have
reached him about the evident abuse
of the "small book" system, and he is
determined to suppress it.
Hereafter when a subject Is taken
into custody the arresting officer will
be compelled to get the Chief's con
sent before he can detain his man.
The instructions to the desk ser
geants in this respect are very explicit
and a violation will result in the of
fender being taken before the Police
Commissioners to be "disciplined."
Not a Dull Line.
Editor James H. Barry does not mince
his words in to-day's Star. He pays his

DUPED BY
A CLEVER
SWINDLER
Money Brokers and
Jewelers His Prin
cipal Victims,
Joseph Schwartz Has
Done a Thriving Busi
ness for Months.
He Has Fled From the City,
and Now the Police Are
Trying to Locate Him.
HAD POLICE PROTECTION.
Schwartz Dealt In Diamonds, Which
He Put Under What Is Known
as the Aniline Process.
There is a race between the police
department and the Pinkerton and
Morse detective agencies as to who will
succeed in capturing one of the bold
est swindling operators that has ever
visited the city. He has about a week's
start on them, but each hopes to be
able to bring him within the meshes
c-f the law.
The man is Joseph Schwartz, who has
a record in the East of being one of
the shrewdest and cleverest confidence
workers in the country. He arrived
here several months ago, representing
himself as a silent partner in several
books at the race track. He visited
them daily, and spent money lavishly
so as to keep up the deception.
He soon won the confidence of sev
eral of the leading pawnbrokers, and
his method was to purchase from them
diamonds of an off-color, which, by
what is known as the "aniline proc
ess," he would convert into what on
the surface appeared to be gems of the
purest color. He would, as a rule, buy
them on time and make a part pay
ment on the purchase price. After us
ing the "aniline process" on them he
would take them to a money broker
and represent that he had been suffer
ing severe losses at the race track, and
was in urgent need of ready cash. The
diamonds belonged, he said, to his wife,
and the loan would only be a tempora
ry one. as he would redeem them
shortly. He had two or three jewelry
men as appraisers whom he had
"squared," and if the broker had no ap
praiser of his own Schwartz would sug
gest that the diamonds be sent to one
of his own appraisers, who would re
port that the security was ample, and
he obtained the loan.
He began by borrowing sums from
$500 to $1500, which he repaid In a few
days, thereby gaining the confidence of
the brokers. Then he began doubling
the amounts, and within the past
month secured in the neighborhood of
$20,000, which he took with him when
he fled from the city about a week ago.
One of his victims is Dr. E. L. Wem
ple of 406 Sutter street. In his case, it
is alleged. Dr. Wempfe's appraiser was
fixed and Schwartz got $1000 out of
him. The appraiser reported that the
security was good and when the doctor
realized on the diamonds he was only
able to obtain between $500 and $600.
Other victims are Joseph Nash of Post
street and William Wolfsohn, a jew
eler on Merchant street. In one deal
Nash advanced Schwartz $2000 on a lot
of diamonds which have since been
liberally appraised at $900. Wolfsohn
it is said is out about $5000 in diamonds
which he advanced Schwartz, who used
them in obtaining money from the
brokers.
Van Vliet of the Baldwin Collateral
Loan Company on Market street is
said to be the only one who made
money out of Schwartz. Schwartz was
introduced to him by Jake Wheatfield.
who is known around the Baldwin
Hotel, and it was agreed that Wheat
field should get 10 per cent commission
on the business done by Schwartz.
There is a suit now pending brought
by Wheatfield to recover from Van
Vliet his commission. Schwartz's de
position was taken in the case, but he
skipped before it was signed.
Schwartz stopped at the Baldwin
Hotel and attracted attention as a fine
dresser. It is claimed that his opera
tions were known to the police, as sev
eral of his victims had at various
times complained, but did not care to
swear out warrants for his arrest as
it might hurt their business if it were
known publicly that they had been in
volved in such shady transactions.
It is surprising to these men why
Schwartz was not long ago stopped by
the police from carrying on his swin
dling operations, and some of them are
inclined to think that he was under
police protection. His record in the
East was well known to the police and
to the Plnkertons. Two or three years
ago he was arrested in Ogden for sur
reptitiously getting away with $100,000
worth of diamonds, but he managed to
beat the case somehow. He was one
of the ringleaders in the scheme to fix
a baseball game in St. Louis about five
years ago between the Bostons and
Washingtons. It leaked out that
Schwartz was in the deal, and the re
sult was that the game was played on
its merits and the best team won,
which left Schwartz without a cent
and he had to borrow money to get out
of the city.
To show the man's effrontery ne
made an application while here to be
admitted to membership in the Knights
of Pythias so as to give him a sort of
standing in the community. With all
his cleverness he can neither read nor
write. He is a plausible talker, about
5 feet 7 inches tall, thick set, smooth
round face, weighs about 190 pounds,
dark complexion and dark eyes and
dresses in the height of fashion. He
has a wife and family in New York.
A PRESIDIO SUICIDE.
An Ex-Soldier Rejected for Enlist
ment Became Discouraged and
Took His Own Life.
Joseph Fouque, an ex-soldier, committed
suicide yesterday at the Presidio by
shooting himself through the heart with
a Krag-Jorgensen rifle.
Fouque was following the profession of
nurse, and business not being good, and
perhaps the war agitation working upon
the old military enthusiasm he applied for
re-enlistment. The army surgeon made
the usual examination and passed him as
sound and as being entitled physically to
march with his old comrades, but when
his previous military record was received
it was found that he had been dishonor
ably discharged because he had eloped
with the wife of a brother soldier. The
news cast him down, and yesterday while
the company which he was vlsitlxur was at
lunch he took a rifle down from the
rack, pjaoed the mussle to hie left breast,
touched the trigger with a brush and sent
a bullet through his heart. The body was
taken to the Morgue.
On his person was found a note reading
as follows:
PRESIDIO, CaJ., Feb. 25.â D0 not blame
any one; I knew what I was doing and
preferred death to beggary. My papers
â will Drove who I am. J. FOUQUE.
If Fouque's previous record in the
army had been Btralght he would have
been admitted to Company O of the First
Infantry. The surgeon had passed him,
and the fact of his acceptance was wired
to Washington. Yesterday morning Col.
Evan Miles, commanding the post at the
Presidio, received a telegram from the
Adjutant General of the Army that
Fouque had. been dishonorably dismissed
from the service at Fort Bowie. Fouque
was apprised of this teleirram by the re
cruiting officer and Informed that he
could not be accepted. He was very de-
Hpondent and declined to go down to din
ner with the men of Q Company. While
the soldiers of the company were at din
ner Fouque took a gun from the rack, got
a cartridge from a belt and sent a bullet
through his breast. The gxin was
held so close to his body that the re
port of the discharge was not heard in
the barracks. A Boldler who happened to
enter the squad room saw Fouque in the
agonies of death.
The Krag-Jorgensen bullet passed
through Fouque's body, through the cell-
Ing of the attic and through the slate roof
of the barracks. The penetrating power
of the projectile after passing through a
human body was fully demonstrated. De
ceased was about 40 years of age. It is
said that he formerly kept a drug store in
El Paso, Texas.
JAPANESE LABOREKS.
Twenty-Four All in a Bow Dressed
in Uniform and Duly Tick
eted by Their Master.
Immigration Commissioner North began
yesterday an investigation in the matter
of twenty-four Japanese immigrants who
arrived on the City of Peking last Sunday.
They were dressed in European garments
made of the same piece and cut of cloth,
and all admitted that they came from the
same district in Japan. They were farm
ers and Intended to remain in California
two or three years studying the Califor
nian methods of growing wheat and rice.
No one of them had more than $45, which
they admitted would last them for about
two months. When that was gone they
would telegraph to their fathers and un
cles in Japan for more money. â¢ The ex
pense of telegraphing and cabling, they
said, would be about $20 in each case, but
that would be a mere bagatelle to the
aforesaid fathers and uncles, who had rice
farms yielding an incotne of $75 per an
num each.
The investigation will be resumed this
morning. There can be no doubt that
these immigrants are contract laborers,
as their predecessors have turned out to
be. If Commissioner North should deny
them the right to land no court will have
authority to overturn his action. There
can be no appeal save to the Secretary of
the Treasury.
WILL SOON BE
AT AN END
Figel Case May Be Given to
the Jury on Wednes
day.
Is Postponed Until Monday Because
of the Indisposition of Judge
Murphy.
Sickness seems to be the main ele
ment in the recent delay of the Figel
case. At the present timo Judge Mu>
phy, for the prosecution, is indisposed
and in consequence the case has been
put over until next Monday morning at
10 o'clock. The testimony given yes
terday was a repetition of that given by
the witnesses during the preliminary ex
amination, but the defense is straining
every effort to show that some few facts
tend to support the theory that Isaac
Hoffman committed suicide on the even-
Ing of June 1, and that the de
ceased merchant was led to the rash act
by letters written by his wife, and also
because he might have embezzled funds
belonging to the firm. The prosecution
was even stronger in its contention that
Hoffman was murdered in cold blood by
the defendant.
At the opening of the case Miss Lillian
Cohen was recalled to the stand for re
cross-examination. It is admitted that
the witness is ready with replies to ques
tions put and that there is no danger
but what the testimony given will be
in accordance with what the witness saw
on the eventful evening of June 1. The
whole case seems to rest on a matter
of a few minutes. Half-past 6 o'clock
is the time at issue, and some scatter
ing testimony given tends to show that
Hoffman was alive at the time the de
fendant went on the boat on his way to
San Rafael. The witness was appar
ently positive that one of the two men
she had seen standing in front of tne
store of Hoffman, Rothchild & Co. was
Isaac Hoffman, and cross-examination did
not materially break down her testi
mony.
The witness Was followed by Dr. E. R.
Williams, who testified as to bullet
wounds, powder marks and the possi
bilities of suicide where it had been dis
covered that three bullets had entered
the head of the deceased. Henry Ick
hoff stated that he had seen the defend
ant about 6:25 o'clock at the ferry, and
A. Farnsworth testified that he had seen
Theodore Figel on a car going toward
the ferry at 6:23 or 6:24 o'clock. Dr. O.
F. Westphal related his experience with
Figel at the time he had seen him using
the revolver with which the shooting was
done, and Everett Thomas stated that
he had heard a shot in the store of
Hoffman, Rothchild & Co., about twenty
five minutes to 7 o'clock. The case was
then put over until Monday morning
when it is probable Thomas will be re
called. The defense is of the opinion
that the case will be submitted to the
Jury next Wednesday afternoon, and they
naturally state they do not fear but
that the result will be favorable to the
defendant In the case. Interest in the
proceeding gradually grows as the ca&e
nears an end.
Activity in Building Trades Council
The Building Trades Council is still
rapidly growing in membership, and
promises soon to be one of the foremost
central labor bodies in the city. At last
night's meeting the electrical workers
sent delegates to represent them; and at
next week's meeting it ts expected that
the Painters' Onion will also affiliate
with the council. A committee Is now out
trying to secure suitable headquarters,
and it is probable that the building now
occupied by the Labor Bureau Associa
tion at 915 l ,fc Market street will be chosen.
An effort is also being made to unite the
two central bodies, the Labor Council and
the Building Trades, but the joint com
mittee is making very little progress, as
neither side appears willing to make any
great concessions, while both feel that it
is an end much to be desired.

IN TROUBLE
Creditors Called In to
Settle Its Diffi
culties.

Five Cents on the

$67,000.
CHARGE MISMANAGEMENT
John C. Bauer Heads m Commute*
to Arrange the Concern's
Affairs.
The San Francisco Stock Brewery,
one of the largest individual beer pro
ducing concerns in the city, is In finan
cial difficulties and unless a settle
ment is reached with the creditors
during the next week the corporation
will be forced into insolvency.
The Bruns family, well known in
grocery and liquor circles in this oity,
owns the larger portion of the stock in
the corporation, which has been In
business here for several years.
Several days ago the main stock
holders decided that the burden of
debt that had accumulated was too
heavy to carry and called a meeting of
the creditors. It was shown at the
meeting that the liabilities were in ex
cess of $67,000, and that the concern
could not pay half of its obligations if
the real estate and other asset*
were sold to satisfy the debts.
An offer of twenty-five cents on the
dollar was made but not accepted by
the creditors, who appointed a commit
tee of three, consisting of John C.
Bauer, a representative of the Bank of
California, and another creditor to look
into the state of affairs and report at
another meeting to be held early next
week. It is hoped by the creditors to
settle with the stockholders, many of
whom are wealthy, at something bet
ter than twenty-five cents on the dol
lar.
The main creditors are J. C. Bauer
$25,000, and Bank of California $15,000.
"The downfall of the brewery was
due to mismanagement," said John C.
Bauer, one of the creditors' committee,
last evening. "Several years ago one
of the bookkeepers defaulted for a con
siderable sum, and since then the losses
have been heavy, principally because
extensive credit has been allowed to ir
responsible parties from whom the
corporation was not able to collect.
We hope, of course, to straighten mat
ters out, but at present it looks doubt
ful.
"The property of the brewery was
signed over to a loan association some
time ago for the purpose of raisins
money on a mortgage, and it is possible
that if this loan is arranged the corpo
ration's affairs may be so arranged
that it will continue in business."
The brewery of the concern is lo
cated on Powell and Francisco streets.
DINED WITH DR. MORSE.
A Farewell Banquet Previous to His
Departure on a Pleasure Trip.
One of the most enjoyable dinners yet
given in the dining room of the San Fran
cisco Club marked the approaching de
parture of Dr. John F. Morse on a pleas
ure trip through the East .and Mexico.
Dr. Morse, Mrs. Morse and Miss Jennie
Flood will leave this morning at 9 o'clock
in a special car. They will spend some
time in Eastern cities, visiting all points
of interest, and then they will take a run
through Mexico, including every point of
interest in the southern republic.
To fittingly speed the departing, Ru
dolph Herold Jr. arranged for a dinner
to a few kindred spirits, and last night
they assembled In a private dining room
in the club's apartments in the Claus
Spreckels building. There were present
Dr. Morse, Judge W. H. Henshaw, Henry
F. Fortmann, W. W. Foote. J. T. Burke,
J. B. Reinstein. Edmond Godohaux and
Rudolph Herold Jr.
It was a most informal affair; theguests
were old friends and the hours sped
quickly. Dr. Morse's health was drunk,
and for him and his party were wished a
pleasant journey and a safe return.
