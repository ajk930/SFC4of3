HAVANA, Feb. 22. -La Lucha, in
editorial this afternoon, recommends
that all correspondents of newspa
pers the United States who
send out charges against the au
thorities of Spain be immediately
expelled from Cuba. La Lucha also
states that Captain Sigsbee has no
right to take an active part in the Maine
investigation, adding that in any other
country the first official proceeding
would be to court-martial him.
HAVANA, Feb. 22. â The further inquiry into the
causes that led to the Maine disaster proceeds, the more
remote appear the chances that any evidence will be
discovered to show that the disaster was due to acci
dent. I am able to give you the result of the investiga
tion made this morning by the divers. Those that
penetrated into the forward part of the wreck found that
the whole forward end of the ship from a point just abaft
the forward turret had been twisted fifteen or twenty
degrees to starboard.
That part of the vessel was a wilderness of debris
and curled and twisted plates. The sharp, jagged edges
of some of the plates added danger to the difficulties of
the divers by getting their life lines into a tangle and
fraying the cords, and in one instance almost cutting
through the rubber tube which supplied the diver
with air.
One important discovery made was as
to the position of the corpses found in
the wreck, ioo of which were floating
about the torn compartments. A full
score of these were examined by mv in
formant. All of these were in their
hammocks and all had their arms
curved upward as if they had been
startled by some sudden shock of dan
ger and were in the act of reaching uo
for their hammock hooks to swing
themselves on deck when death came.
This seems to confirm what has already
been said about there having been two
explosions, the first startling the men
into the act of arising from their ham
mocks, the other dashing the fife out of
them while they were in that position.
Before the explosion the ten-inch
magazine was located on the starboard
side, forward, and beneath the forward
turret. What is left of that magazine
seems to have been driven toward the
port bow in a diagonal and upward di
rection.
The six-inch magazine, which had. its
location in the port side of the ship for
ward, was hurled in a direction directly
opposif to that of the ten-inch maga
zine. One of the copper cylindrical
The San Francisco Call
found by the divers in the wreck of that
structure. It contained no powder
charge.
The ten-inch magazine has not been
closely examined at this writing but
such inspection of it as was made leads
my informant to believe the biff pile of
twisted wreckage that lies about the too
of it is composed of unexploded ten
inch charges.
My informant believes that the six
inch magazine was exploded by the first
shock that was felt, and that there was
another explosion in the ten-inch mag
azine.
Though I questioned him very closely
I could gain no idea as to whether the
curvature of the plates indicated that
there had been an outside explosion. He
could not tell me, as he had made no
examination in that direction.
The theory of two explosions is
borne out by the testimony of Senor An
tonio Caballero, a well known tobacco
dealer in Havana. Senor Caballero was
crossing the bay in the ferry-boat at the.
time of the disaster. He was familiar
with the Maine, having paid several
visits to that craft, and was pointing out
SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 1898.
to a group of friends on the ferry-boat
her peculiarities when there came, he
says, a dull report from the forward part
of the warship and the upheaval of a
geyser of water about the boat, followed
almost immediately by a terrific roar
and a blinding flash of light. He is
positive about the first explosion and
says it was noticed by his companions.
This statement of his came to the ears
of one of the court of inquiry, and last
night an officer was sent to Senor
Caballeros to ask him if he would ap
pear as a witness before the court. He
announced his willingness to do so and
was to have appeared to-day.
Many strange tales of the disaster are
brought out as the days wear on. One
of these was made known yesterday
when the captain of an English bark an
chored in the harbor and nearly a
mile distant from the Maine told of
how a bewhiskered jaw had fallen on
the deck of his vessel. The captain has
been asked to appear as a witness before
the court of inquiry.
The proceedings of that body absorb
all interest now. Every one here be-
I lieves a crisis will follow close upon the
heels of its conclusions.
The Spanish authorities realize that
Spain is perilously near a rupture with
the United States and suppressed ex
citement is felt in the air. The Captain-
General js in constant communication
Mfith Madrid, bat nothing that" is' hao- '
pÂ«ning there or at Washington is al
lowed to appear in the papers. The
foreign consular officials are likewise
busy with their home offices.
Diving operations at the wreck were
carried on to-day more briskly and
with better results than heretofore, at
least so far as the work of recovering
bodies is concerned. The men are now
becoming accustomed to the lay of the
wreck and proceed with more freedom
and confidence than they had when they
first ventured into the murky depths.
Operations were confined entirely to
day to the forward part of the ship.
Twelve bodies had been recovered uo
to 3 o'clock. The divers also brought
up deck chairs and other articles that
formed part of the ship's furniture.
As the bodies were brought to the
surface they were towed to the Spanish
patrol boat, where they were prepared
for burial. I spent a short time this
afternoon on board this barge in com
pany with Chaplain Chadwick. The
bodies presented a sickening sight. Out
of twelve recovered to-day it has been
impossible so far to identify one. Most
of them are scarred and burned beyond
recognition. Those bodies that had not
been burned had been in the water so
long the features were unrecognizable.
Eight of the bodies were in such a con
dition that they were all placed in one
coffin.
As the bodies were towed alongside
the barge Chaplain Chidwick peered
anxiously over the side hoping that he
might recognize some familiar features.
Captain Sigsbee, at the time I was on
the barge with Chaplain Chidwick. was
on the lighthouse tender Mangrove a
few yards away. He was seated alone
on the deck looking stern and sorrowful
as fresh evidence of the direful results
of the explosion that destroyed his ves
sel came before his eyes. The bodies
recovered from the wreck, with those
of men who died in the hospital, now
number 158. Of these only fifty have
been identified. It is possible that
marks on what is left of the clothing
may lead to the identification of fifteen
more.
The operations of the divers to-day
did not extend to that part of the wreck
where the officers' quarters were, and
the bodies of Lieutenant Fred W. Ten
kins and Passed Assistant Engineer
Darwin R. Merritt have not yet been
recovers d.
While the divers were at work the
shores, as usual, were lined with throngs
striving to follow all that was being
done at the wreck and on the boats near
by. Craft of all sorts swarmed in the
vicinity of the operations, approaching
as closely as the patrol boats would per
mit them.
Before the Naval Court of Inquiry ap
pointed to investigate the cause of the
explosion which wrecked the warship
Captain Sigsbee to-day continued his
story of the disaster. All the morning
was taken up in this examination, dur
ing which time, I am able to say. facts
of great importance bearing upon the
blowing up of the Maine were brought
out. Great care is taken to keep se
cret all of Captain Sigsbee's testimony,
and the same care will be exercised
when other important witnesses appear

SPAIN WILL NOT SELL CUBA.
Copyrighted, IS9B, by James Gordon Bennett.
MADRID, Feb. 22.â As the question of the purchase of Cuba is being
pushed in Washington, it may be of use to state, and I have it on the
highest authority, that Spain would never, no matter what the Gov
ernment was in power, consider any such suggestion or any compro
mise in Cuba beyond the broad measure of autonomy drafted by the
Liberal Government. This is an absolute, irrevocable decision. People
who suggest anything elÃe are only wasting time and arousing un
founded hopes in the minds of the rebels.
before the court of inquiry to tell their
stories. No story of the wrecking of
the Maine will, however, he Riven such
consideration by the Board of Inquiry
as that of Captain Sitrsbee, who. as
commander of the United States war
vessel, has told just what steps were
taken to protect the battle-ship.
Captain Sigsbee yesterday gave valu
able information as to this, but to-day
it is' understood his testimony was of
even greater importance and through it
great light has been thrown upon the
mystery of the Maine disaster.
When all of Captain Sigsbee's testi
mony is in the court of inquiry will
proceed immediately to the statements
cf the other officers of the Maine, and
then the work of taking the testimony
of the wounded and other survivors oi
the battle-ship will begin. This will
j/robnbly consume considerable time, as
the stories of many of the crew of the
Maine will be long.
These who were nearest the scene of
the explosion will be minutely examined
by the court. Not one ot these has as
yet told his story in detail, and when
these stories are told it is expected they
v. ill tr very sensational. Great impor
tance is attached by the court to the
testimony of these men.
While the investigation in behalf of
the L'niU-u States is point? on the ijpan
ish iuthonties are not idle. The depo
sions of officers of Spanish vessels in the
I. arbor ?rd of harbor officials as to the
Maine disaster were to-day given before
Judge Feral of the Spanish Admiralt>
Court, this way the Spanisn are
working to gather facts as to the Maine
disaster hitherto unknown.
Pefore the court of inquiry met on the
Mangrove to-day members of the court
paid an official visit to Admiral Man
terola. The court did not visit the
members of the autonomist gov
ernment.
In honor of the victims of the Maine
the military commander of Guanabacoa
has ordered the suspension for three
days of public festivities in that city.
This work of respect is greatly appre
ciated by the American colony in this
city.
The rebels in the field have not been
inactive during the excitement follow
ing the destruction of the Maine. Gen
eral Pando of the Santiago district has
asked for re-enforcements to continue
his campaign against Calixto Garcia
and 1600 regulars have been sent to him.
General engagements have taken place
there recently, but no details have
reached the capital.
NAVAL OFFICERS
SUSPECT TREACHERY.
So the Vast Quantity of Coal at Key
West Is Now Being
Searched.
NEW YORK, Feb. 22.â A Key West
special to the Herald says: Notwith
standing the order issued by the Navy
Department commanding all its officers
not to hold interviews with any person
whatever in reference to the destruc
tion of the Maine, or other matters con
nected with naval affairs, it is evident
from unguarded expressions heard in
hotel corridors and in the streets that
the opinion of foul play in connection
with the blowing up of the war vessel
is daily gaining ground in naval circles.
That treachery is suspected even at
this point is evidenced by the precau
tions being taken by the naval au
thorities here. Precisely who is under
suspicion or what is mistrusted I have
been unable to ascertain, but the fact
that unusual precautions are being
taken is apparent.
Below the surface suspicion seems to
be directed chiefly toward the supply
of coal kept in the sheds here for the
use of naval vessels. During the last
few days a gang of laborers has been
overhauling the coal piles, searching
for dynamite or 'other combustibles.
The work is necessarily slow and te
dious, on account of the immense
quantity stored here, and the examina
tion will require possibly a week
longer. From the fact that after the
work is discontinued at sundown
armed watchmen are placed on guard
at the yard it would appear that not
only is suspicion directed with what
might have been placed in the coal in
the past, but the authorities are ap
prehensive anew.
It is reported here to-night that a
dispatch was received at the naval
station after sundown from Washing-
ton stating that the Washington of
ficials were working on information
which may show that a bomb was
placed in one of the bunkers of the
ship and its explosion resulted in the
sinking of the Maine. This theory is
repudiated by numerous officers whom
I questioned. They ridicule the idea
that any ordinary bomb could have
penetrated the heavy steel walls pro
tecting the magazines. I called on
Commander Forsythe to-night and
questioned him respecting the report.
He looked down at me from his tower
ing height with a quizzical expression
of countenance and said: "Young man,
have you seen the orders from the Sec
retary of the Navy prohibiting all of
ficers from granting interviews to
members of the press?"
I evaded his query and asked him Jf
he had received such an order. He
begged to be excused from answering
the question. There is no foundation
in the report that Consul-General Lee
has left Havana for the United States.
I saw the consul in Havana last night
on his way to the palace of Captain-
General Blanco with whom he had a
long conference.
DELUGED WITH THE

Governor Holcomb of Nebraska
Could Turn Out a Big Army
in Case of War.
NEW YORK. Feb. 22.â A Lincoln
(Neb.) special to the Herald says:
Governor Holcomb and Adjutant-Gen
eral Barry have been deluged with
proffers from National Guard members,
ex-army men and citizens of their ser
vices, and yesterday sixty-five citizens
of Valentine tendered their services
to President McKinley through the
Governor.
Major Fechel. United States army,
military attache to Governor Holcomb,
has received a number of cipher tele
grams from Washington, but the con
tents are not disclosed.. At Fort Nio
brara there is more activity than any
time since the Wounded Knee Indian
uprising.
Governor Holcomb refuses to say he
has received any instructions from the
War Department. He says the mili
tary strength of the State for immedi
ate service, fully equipped, is 1200 men,
but that 200,000 more will respond if the
Government calls them.

of the Navy-
NEW YORK. Feb. 22.â A Key West,
Fla., special to the Herald says :
The Call-Herald special dispatch boat
arrived here from Havana at4o'clock
this afternoon. Notwithstanding
the strong northerly wind and a
heavy sea in the gulf the trim little
steamer made the run across in a
few hours. Her arrival in the har
bor, which caused considerable ex
citement, was simultaneous with
that of the steamer Olivette from
Tampa, and as the latter slowed
down in approaching her dock the
fleet little dispatch boat steamed
past with her Herald pennant flying
to the breeze, exchanging salutes
with their musical whistle.
As indicated in my dispatches last
night, the wrecking tug Right Arm
sailed this evening for Havana, hav
ing been sent by the naval author
ities to assist in the examination of
the Maine. Captain Magee told me
he had no doubt his men would be
able within a few hours to deter
mine the cause of the disaster to
morrow.
"Assuming," I said, "that the
action of a mine or torpedo from
the exterior caused the explosion of
the magazines, would a magazine
explosion have obliterated evidences
of the prior exp/osicn of the mine?"
"No," said Captain Magee, "as soon as
our experienced divers get to work and the
surrounding mud is dredged out from under
the ship's bottom we will be able to explain
the whole affair thoroughly, but our informa
tion will be given to nobody but properly
accredited Government officers."
Captain Magee seen ed deeply impressed
with the magnitude of the issue hanging
upon the work of the men laboring under his
control. He is a discreet man and may be
depended upon to do faithful work and dis
close no secrets except to the proper
authorities.
The order issued by ihe Secretary of the
Navy to all officers forbidding them under
penalty of coort-martial from granting in
terviews to any person, and particularly
newspaper correspondents, in reference to
the destruction of the Maine or any matter
connected with the disaster, is being rigidly
enforced by the naval authorities. The order
has naturally, from the open manner and abso
lute freedom with which all information has
been heretofore given by attaches of naval
stations and officers of vessels in the harbor,
caused considerable comment in this city
and created the impression that the Govern
ment is in possession of facts which perhaps
have been developed by divers working in
the Maine, which, if known by the public,
might precipitate premature action by the
President; in other words might force the
executive to dec/are war before the Govern
ment is fully prepared to act. At all events
the order is considered full of significance.

PRICE FIVE CENTS.
Government departments were closed
in Washington to-day .save the Navy
Department, where a few of the officials
assembled to receive any dispatches
that might arrive and to close the con
tract with the wreckers for the recov
ery of the effects on the Maine and the
vessel herself if that be practicable.
The signing of the wrecking contract
was the most important event of the
day, and this concluded the officials
closed up shop and went home to enjoy
a respite from the rush of the past
week.
Captain Sigsbee was heard from in
a dispatch which indicates that close
attention will be given to the coal
bunkers by the Navy Court of Inquiry.
Washington officials unquestionably
have been for some time preparing for
any emergency that may arise, but ap
pearances at the department to-day

ders have already been given and that
the situation is not one calling for im

The Senate passed a bill to add two
artillery regiments to the strength of
the r.avy. This measure has been
urged for many months by officials of
the War Department, who foresaw that
while Congress of late years had taken
measures for the protection of our
coasts by additional appropriations for
extensive works, it had not provided
the men necessary to operate these en
gines of war. Should the House pass
the bill It will enable the department

FORTY RAPID-FIRE
HOTCHKISS GUNS ORDERED.
Contracts With the American Ord-
nance Company That Causes
Comment.
NEW YORK. Feb. 22.â A Bridgeport.
Conn., special to The Herald says: The
American Ordnance Company has re
ceived an order for guns which is ac
companied by considerable mystery.
The order is for forty six-pounder
rapid fire Hotchkiss guns to be deliv
ered at once. The order came from
Vice-President Very of the Ordnance
Company in Washington. The guns
called for in the contract are such as
are used largely by the Government
for torpedo boats and light armed
cruisers, and the belief is that they are
for the United States Government.
Secretary N. W. Bishop of the com
pany says the officials of the company
here knew nothing about the destina
tion of the guns. The order was by
telegraph and was signed by the vice
president. Immediately preparations
were begun by the ordnance company
for turning out the guns. Some of tha
castings will be made by the Bethle
hem Iron Works, Bethlehem, Pa.,
and it will take fully a week
to get the first gun under way, but af

Without a Moment's Loss of Time
tf)e Modern Eogine of War
to Speed to the
Metropolis.
NEW YORK. Feb. 22â A Richmond, Va., special to the Herald
says: News from Norfolk Navy-yard to-night is that the Terror is
under orders to sail direct to New York to-morrow instead of drop
pin? anchor in Hampton Roads. The yard is working with closed
gates, and visitors, and newspaper men particularly, are barred.
Work will be kept up until a late hour to-night. Captain Dunn, com
mander of the Terror, has been on board his ship all day supervising
the work of taking on stores. Some finishing touches are being placed
on her boilers, and this will complete her repairs. She is already
coaled, and stores are not large enough to indicate an extensive cruise.
She will take on other stores at New York, it Is said. It is Impossible
to say at what hour she will leave, her own officers expressing ignor
ance of the exact time, as it is merely a question of completing work
on her. This is expected will be late to-night. She will likely sail in
the morning, and, not requiring a pilot on account cf her comparatively
moderate size, will make a quick run to the Capes, and should reach
New York on Thursday morning. Three hundred men have enlisted on
the Puritan and Terror in the last few days, and many more have of
fered. They are sent aboard the recruiting ship Franklin, and as
soon as they pass the doctor's examination are transferred to one or
other of the monitors.
The Government has increased the appropriation for construction
for the Norfolk Navy-yard from $40,000 to $85,000 for the month of
March, and the force will be doubled. If the requisite number of men
cannot be obtained here they will be transferred from smaller navy
yards. This with other appropriations will make about $300,000 to be
spent in the yard during that month. Other vessels needing repairs
will be sent here shortly, and it is stated on good authority that the
Machias, now on her way from Europe, will be sent to this yard for
extensive repairs.
fierce of men has already been put on.
The officials say they do not attach
the significance to the order that they
would have had they received a hur
ried order f'>r ammunition. It is un
derstood here, despite the disclaimer,
thai the guns are for the Government
and that the contract is likely to be
followed by ano-ther even larger than
the present one. The increased activ
ity at the factory is already comment
ed upon by employes, who see, in the
event of war ahead, lively times for
them.
DECIDED SPLIT IN
THE CUBAN MINISTRY.
Autonomists Bealieved to Be Se
cretly Treating for the Island's
Independence.
MADRID, Feb. 22.â A gloomy tone
pervades in political circles on the re
ports of a split in the Cuban ministry, i
The autonomists, Senor Giberga and j
Senor Amblard, are, it is believed, j
secretly treating with the Separatists
in the direction of independence for
Cuba. Senor Govin, the Cuban Secre
tary of the Interior, is accused of
treason by the Imparcial, which pub
lishes a fac simile of a letter from
Senor Govin to a friend, in which the
former says:
"How could you think that Saga-sta,
a man inferior Â»to Canovas, and liberal
only in name, has inspired my attitude
and not my ideas and sentiments as a
Cuban? McKinley as well as Cut>a will i
determine whether I am a Spaniard.
Long live our country and liberty."
The Imparoial adds that it predicted ;
a weak Ministry in Cuba and warned '
Senor Moret, the Spanish Colonial <
Minister, of what was likely to be the
outcome of his autonomy scheme.
El Pais says: "Spain should treat
with the rebels direct rather than tol- j
crate the traitor Govin."
El Correo Espanol asks: "How â¢will
Senor Moret, the patron of Govin, and \
Senor Sagasta, the patron of both
Moret and Govin. stand, now that Go
vin is a traitor to his country? Who- ,
ever supports a traitor is likewise a

SAYS A TORPEDO
DESTROYED THE MAINE
This pact Is Well I^nows to the GovernmeQt,
fllthough It Is Not Believed tJ)e Spanish
Officers at Havana Had flny HaQd
ir) the Atrocious Crin)e.
PITTSBURG, Pa., Feb. 22.â Senator Quay and his son, Captain A. G. C. Quay of the regular army,
arrived at the Senator's home at Beaver to-day from Washington. According to a special dispatch re
ceived from Beaver, the Senator fears trouble with Spain. He Is quoted as saying the Government has
positive information that the Maine was destroyed by a torpedo, but does not think the Spanish Govern
ment itself had anything to do with the disaster, but that the awful work was done by Spanish guerrillas
who thought by blowing up the boat they were aiding the Spanish Government.
"The torpedo that destroyed the battle-ship was made in the United States," said the Senator. "It's
character is fully understood.- It was possible to send it through the water for a mile and to discharge it
either by percussion or by a time fuse, arranged by clock work. The torpedo probably was sent on Its ter
rible mission by members of the volunteer army in Havana. The work had not the countenance of the
Spanish authorities."
Senator Quay thinks the work of the divers will simply prove what the Government already knows.
He further said the authorities at Washington are very keen to have the Spanish cruiser Vizcaya, now in
New York harbor, leave at once. While every precaution has been and will be taken for her protection,
the Government has secret Information that attempts will be made to blow her up. The police are especi
ally active about the Cuban junta in New York, according to Mr. Quay, but it would not surprise him
if trouble would hatch there. He repeated that the Government is eager to have the Spanish war vessel
leave New York harbor at once.

and further to ascertain just how
many volunteers could be secured in
this section from ex-guardsmen and
citizens should a crisis come. It is
thought that should war be declared

in charge will find considrable more
work than he anticipates.

SAN DIEGO. Feb. 22.â E. Edwin, a
passenger arriving on the steamer Car

on Saturday morning of the murder of
Marvin Gaskill, son of L. H. Gaskill of

RUSHING WORK
ON GUN CARRIAGES.
NEW YORK, Feb. 22.â A Cleveland
special to the Herald says: Superin
tendent W. E. Pendleton of the nav.nl
gun factory at Washington Navy-yard
to-day Instructed the Otis Steei Com
pany of this city to rush work on and
hasten the delivery of the gun car
riages now being built for the navy.
Assistant General Manager Henry
Jeavons of the steel company said:
"We are building five monster gun
carriages for the Navy Department.
We have been at work on them for
some months. In ordinary events it
would take three months to complete
them. Although the work may be
rushed, it will be Impossible to com
plete them in less than two months.
DIFFICULTY OF
DIVERS' WORK
It May Take Six Weeks
to Complete a
Report.
So Filthy Is the Water That
the Work Cannot Be Done
by Sight.
Refuse Has Been Accumulating for a
Hundred Years Where the Maine
, Was Destroyed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Washington, Feb. 22.
Some of the best informed experts in
the department estimate that the div
ers now engaged in examining the
wreck will be unable to make a com
plete report in \e.:ta than six weeks. The
difficulties of examination are exceed
ingly great. The water of the harbor
is unspeakably filthy, containing as it
does the accumulation of the sewage of
Havana for a hundred years. The in
vestigation can hardly be conducted by
sight, as it is impossible to see more
than an inch or two beyond the eye,
and the wreck is sunk so deep in the
mud and slime that the labor will be
doubly hard.
It is hoped, however, that long be
fore the work of investigation shall be
completed there will be some revela
tion to point with reasonable certainty
to the probable origin of the explosion.
This is merely a hope, for it is recog
nized at the department that there Is a
strong possibility of the cause of the
disaster forever remaining a mystery.
Washington is settling down to await
results with a fair degree of patience.
It is felt that without regard to the
Maine disaster or the De Lome inci
dent, Cuban affairs are approaching a
crisis, and that something will happen
soon to bring things to a head.
Had there been nothing startling to
render delicate the relations between
the two Governments in the past two
weeks, there could still be enough in
the regular development of the situa
tion to make it evident that a settle
ment of some kind was approaching.
Spanish sovereignty has been waning,
and this fact is realized both at Wash
ington and Madrid. The United States
Government finds itself for the first
time in a position to. make propositions
to Spain with a fair prospect of cour
teous consideration, and it is possible
that .the feeling between the two gov
ernments may be softened by recent
events, instead of embittered as at first
seemed certain. The mutual expres
sions of condolence and of confidence
to which the tragedy in Havana har
bor has given rise will, it is believed,
have the effect of rendering diplomatic
negotiations easier and more fruitful,
unless, indeed, the divers at work in
Havana harbor uncover facts which
can have only a sinister interpretation.
TURNING OUT HIGH
EXPLOSIVE SHELLS.
NEW YORK, Feb. 22.â The Taylor
Iron Works, Whitebridge, N. J., have
been working a full force and have
been employing as many men as possi
ble for the last twelve weeks. They
are making twelve, fourteen and six
teen inch shells for the Government.
The shells are to be used for the long
range mortars on the staboard defense.
They are made of steei and are about
six feet in length and weigh 250 pounds.
The average number turned out is
about 100 a day. As soon as they are
completed they are sent to the Govern
ment arsenal at Dover, where they are
loaded with 200 pounds of a new and
high exnlosive resembling gun cotton.
Colonel W. J. Taylor, one of the officers
of the company, refused to talk upon
the matter, and -workmen are forbidden
to say anything.

Department of Dakota Is
Prepared for Any
Emergency.
Has Received Orders to Be in
Shape to Start at a Mo

In the Event of Hostilities Spain
Would Find the Regulars
Well Prepared.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Feb. 22.â A St. Paul
special to the Herald says: It
is certain that the Department
of Dakota has had orders to
be in readiness for the field, though
officers at the army building decline to
admit it. These orders do not imply
that the Government expects war, but
are precautionary.
General Wade left for St. Louis a
few days ago, but it is understood that
he went there on private business.
Colonel McArthur, adjutant-general of
the department, said:
"This department needs no orders. As
to orders to place ourselves in readi
ness it would be like asking us to
stand straight. We are supposed to
be ready and we always are ready.
Why, if orders were received to-night
all the troops in this department could
be under way before to-morrow noon.
Every soldier is on a railroad line. The
telegraph would provide special trains
immediately. Within thirty-six hours
after orders arrived the majority of
our men could be out of the depart
ment.
"A few of them, as far west as Mis
soula, for instance, might be a couple
of days in getting here, but there would
be no delay. We have not any artillery
here, but every company of infantry
and every troop of cavalry is at all
times fully armed and equipped for
duty. There are some 2500 men in the
Department of Dakota, about 1700 in- ,
fantry and 800 cavalry. We have three
full regiments of infantry, the Second,
Third and Twenty-fifth, one regiment
of cavalry, the Tenth, and several
troops of the Fourth Cavalry."
The State of Minnesota has three full
regiments of infantry, batteries of ar
tillery and one cavalry troop which
could be fully ready for Government
service in thirty-six hours.
Colonel Frank E. R. Woodward of
Minneapolis, who spent a year in the
Cuhan army, has tendered the Gov
ernor a company of volunteers. A St.
Paul company of volunteers also an
nounces readiness to take the field at
the Governor's call.
A Columbia. S, C, special to the
Herald says: The only activity in mil
itary circles in South Carolina is in
Charleston harbor defenses. Work
there is going on by day and night.
This is explained by the statement that

<?> ATLANTA, Ga., Feb. 22.â 1t developed hore to-night that orders <S>
â¦ have been received at Fort McPherson to hold two companies of United <&
<$> States infantry for immediate movement to Key West.
<S> Two companies have been detailed, and private soldiers are un- $>
<?> der orders not to leave the reservation even when off duty. The $>
<$> story became known through some men bidding their friends good- <S>
<Â§> by and saying that orders to move are hourly expected. Inquiry de- â¦
<S> velops the fact that this order had been expected ever sintfe the riot
<S> in Havana, but it was not received until several days after the <
<S> Maine was blown up. It is understood to have reached here yester- â¦
<S> day. The soldiers who have been detailed for this duty understand '
Â«> that Key West is not their objective point, but that they are only a â 
<8> small part of a force to be moblized at Key West and held ready for <S>
3> a quick trip to Havana.
<?> It is understood that the officers at Fort McPherson, like the pri- <
<S> vate soldiers, look upon this as a serious move, indicating a purpose <â¢
& on the part of the War Department to be prepared for any emer- <
<$> gency at Havana. It is learned on good authority that the immense <
<S> fortifications being built at Key West are near completion, and that '<
<8> the Government has been advised that guns may be mounted imme- <
<$â¢ diately. In these works embrasures have been prepared for four ten- <
<S> inch and two eight-inch guns. These are immense guns, fifteen feet â¦
<3> long, and weigh about twenty-six tons each. At Tybee Island forti
<S> fication the Government is mounting the first four eight-inch guns <
<S> which will comprise the battery.
<S> NEW LONDON, Conn., Feb. 22. â At Fort Trumbull Commander <3>

Governor Richards has received offers
from all parts of the State of volun

WOUNDED TO BE

HAVANA, Feb. 22.â 1 made a round
of the hospitals this evening with
Chaplain Chidwick. All the wounded
but nine have been sent to the United
States, and these with one of two ex
ceptions will be sent to Key West to
morrow by the Olivette unless Sanitary
Inspector Bruner raises further ob
jection, which is unlikely.
Of the nine now left all are doing well
with the exception of Mack, who is
pre.tty badly injured, but will probably
recover. His burns and wounds are ter
rible, yet he stands the pain bravely
and appears cheerful. All praise high
ly their treatment, but the officers of
the Maine think they would make bet

The flag found this morning was not
the ship's but only a boat's flag. The
ship's flag was hauled down at sunset
and will nroba'biy be burned.
Divers this afternoon secured the
ship's silver service, consisting of four
presentation pieces. While operations
to-day progressed more rapidly than
before, they are still comparatively

with caution. Reports were made

there has been foul play, which fact

CAN IDENTIFY
THE TORPEDOES.
NEW YORK, Feb. 22.â An Albany,
N. V., special to the Herald says:
William Ewing, a veteran of the re
bellion, later a first lieutenant in the
United States army, said to be at pres
ent a brigadier-general in the Cuban
army, is in Albany. Of the blowing up
of the Maine in Havana harbor he
sa id :
"The Government can make the best
use of me by sending me direct to Ha
vana to assist in the naval inquiry into
the cause of this disaster.
"If 1 should go I would have to be -
under the protection of the United
States Government, for there are plenty
of Spaniards in Cuba and especially in
Havana who would recognize me. I
would serve the United States by iden
tifying the torpedoes, and the only one?
that could have blown up the Maine, it
it was blown up, and I believe It was.
"Those torpedoes arrived in Havana
with the battleship Alfonso XII, while I
was in Cuba with General Garcia.
The dimensions and all particulars
concerning these torpedoes were
brought to us by one of our men. He
is a man on whom we can rely, and I
can also produce him at the court of in
quiry, providing the United States will
protect him. I could give the numbers
of these torpedoes and other facts, but
it is not proper to do so at this time.
"If these torpedoes are not produced
it is certain that the Maine was blown
up by one of them. I have written to
the Secretary of War and am at his
disposal. He has not answered my let
ter or sent word of its being received.
If he sends to Albany for me I will go
at once to Washington and lay the
facts in my possession before him and
then if needed I will go to Havana."

WAR WITH
SPAIN NOT
PROBABLE
That Is the Officially Ex=
pressed View at
Washington.
An Officer of the Administration
Insists Nothing Has Been
Developed Yet to Show
the Guilt of Spain.
NTEW YORK, Feb. 22.â The
Herald's Washington corre
spondent telegraphs: Whatever
may be the final conclusions of
the naval court of inquiry as to
the cause of the Maine disaster,
the administration, I am in a
position to state, does not antici
pate any contingency which
would justify the belief that war
with Spain would be the out
come. The authorities all de
clare that the military and naval
preparations now in progress are
n<>t in anticipation of such a con-
â â¦â  tlngency. They are solely or a t
â â¦â  precautionary character. â¦
While the Maine disaster doubtless
had the effect of stimulating the ad
ministration and Congress to active i
preparations, all that is being done at j
the present time, the officials insist,
is for the purpose of meeting unfore
seen contingencies and with the ex
pectation that increased military and
naval strength will operate to stave off
rather than increase the probabilities
of war.
Up to the present time the adminis
tration officials have been reluctant to
discuss the possibilities growing out of
the Maine disaster. They have taken |
the ground that this country should i
consider the explosion an accident until j
there has been ample evidence to the j
contrary. Now that the public mind j
has sobered down an official in the ad- |
ministration, who is well acquainted
with the President's views of the sub- !
Ject, told me to-day that the time had
come when the Maine disaster and the i
> ivftJrfr Jed to it could and ought
to be dispassionately discussed.
While not having been authorized to
make an official statement, the official
with whom I talked does, I know, re
flect the views of the administration.
i> T e said to me: "All the information at
*i.and, officially and through the medi
um of the press dispatches, does not
justify any conclusion whatever as to
whether the origin of the explosion was
from the inside or the outside. We have
ample evidence, however, that it was
not caused by any act of the Spanish j
Government. There have already been j
public expressions of disavowal and the j
deepest regret and sympathy expressed
by the Spanish authorities in Havana
and Madrid.
"Admitting that the explosion was
due to some exterior agency, it must j
then be determined whether it was ;
caused by accident or design before the
United States can determine the degree I
of responsibility of the Spanish Gov
ernment. The worst possible light that
could be put on the matter would be
that the vessel was blown up by a tor
podo or mine directly under the con
trol of the Spanish Government.
"Under these circumstances there j
would, of course, be strong suspicion {
that those in authority in Havana had j
connived at or actually ordered the I
work of destruction. But in the face !
of the absolute disavowal the United
States would have to have very relia
ble evidence before we jumped to the
conclusion that the deed was a hostile
one.
"There is certainly nothing in all the I
facts and circumstances now generally <
known that would justify the condu- !
sion that any Spanish official was re- !
sponsible for the deed. But for the !
6ake of argument we will admit that j
Work on the powerful battle-ship Wisconsin is progressing rapiily at the Union Iron Works of this city. The Wisconsin is of JJ,500 tons displacement, being of the
Same size and type as thz lowa, Kearsarge, Kentucky and Alabama. She is d signed f:r a first-class modern battle-ship. Within a few months the great vessel will be launched
should the emergency of war ariss the contractors might be able to complete the work of construction in advance of the time appointed. Irving M. Scott remarked yesterday that
no orders had been received from the Navy Department to hasten the work on the ship. The large force of men engaged in building the Wisconsin cculd be increased
should occasion arise for rapid construction.
some Spanish officer, through hatred
for the United States, purposely ex
ploded the bomb which blew up the
Maine. The question now arises, what
form of reparation can Spain make to
satisfy the United States that the act
was not a hostile one? The action of
an individual is not that of a nation
when it is repudiated by that nation,
and an act which would be considered
hostile when done by authority cannot
be so considered when done without au
thority and promptly disavowed.
"The offending nation, however,
would not only have to make ample
reparation in the form of indemnity,
but would have to punish the offender
by death before the injured nation
could accept the disavowal as sincere.
"If an exterior agency caused the dis
aster, we must first show that Snain
did not exercise due diligence in pro
tecting the Maine while in her harbor.
This established, Spain, of course, is
responsible, and the degree of respon
sibility and the measures taken for
reparation would be governed solely
by what evidence can be adduced as to
how Ihfc explosion occurred. I â¢ :in see
no possibility, however, of discovering
anything that will show the act was a
hostile one, sanctioned by the Spanish
Government."
Both the War and Navy departments
were closed to-day. Only one dispatch
was received from Captain C. D. Sigs
bee, commanding the ill-fated ship. It
reads: "Send to Forsythe for Sigsbee
a transverse sectional drawing of the
Maine through the forward 10-inch
magazine and shell room, showing the
pocket coal bunkers."
This telegram is considered signifi
cant by those who believe the vessel's
destruction was due to spontaneous,
combustion in her coal bunkers. Con
servative officials of the Navy Depart
ment believe that Captain Sigsbee's
request is merely for the purpose of
informing divers as to the location of
the magazine and the bunkers.
INGALLS PREDICTS A
TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION.
Believes a Conflict Is Approaching
That Will Change the Map of
the World.
NEW YORK. Feb. 22.â An Atlanta
(Ga.) special to the Herald says: Ex-
Senator John J. Ingalls of Kansas be
lieves that a general upheaval is near,
when the map of the entire earth and
the frontiers of nations will undergo a
change.
"I believe we are on the brink of the
most tremendous explosion that has
ever been known in the world's his
tory," he said to me to-night as he left
his hotel to lecture in the Grand Opera
House.
"There is a universal crisis at hand,"
he continued. "There are many causes
which contribute to this crisis â the
gigantic armament of the European
powers, the territorial encroachment of
the rival powers in the Orient and in
Africa, the war of the laboring masses
against their own condition and the
accumulation of wealth by the other
class. All are prepared for conflict.
Armies are equipped with the most
modern engines of destruction, and be
hind all this is a great class who look
eagerly for war as an opportunity for
employment and profit. 1 can't but be
lieve that a struggle for readjustment
of frontiers is not far off. We will come
out of it all right, I feel certain, and I
believe that civilization will be ad
vanced, but it will work a change in
the map of the world."
Mr. Ingalls made this prediction in
discussing the situation arising from
the Maine disaster, which he considers
grave in the extreme.

AN INCREASE
OF ARTILLERY

Why It Is Absolute
Necessity.

Must Be Properly
Manned.
There Will Be l^o Opposition in the
House to the Bill Passed by
the Senate.
to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. 22.
Senator Hawley, in reporting the bill
for the increase of the artillery arm of
the army by two regiments, said: "Thi?
speedy passage of this bill or its equi
valent appears to be an absolute neces
sity. The Government, after long and
careful consideration by those whose
offices and studies qualify them to give
the most valuable advice, has entered
upon the execution of a systematic and
elaborate plan of coast defense. The
progress therein is indicated in extracts
from the annual report of General John
M. Wilson, chief of engineers. Existing
contracts call for the emplacement and
mounting on or before June 30, 189S,
now rapidly approaching, 139 modern
high-power steel guns, ranging in cal
iber from eight to twelve inches; twelve
six pounders and 233 twelve-inch mor
tars, a total of 387."
These are to be scattered, according
to the beat judgment of the engineers
and ordnance officers, from Maine to
Puget Sound, having careful regard to
the relative importance of the positions
to be defended. The great expenditure
will be wasted treasure unless a suffi
cient number of artillerymen, carefully
selected and thoroughly drilled, be as
signed to the care and use of these
costly instruments of defense.
As the works are from week to week
completed the utmost the general com
manding can do is to detail a few care
takers to each station. With the aid
of the actives of the National Guard
and those who have been discharged
therefrom after years of instruction, ef
fective cavalry and infantry could be
collected in a comparatively short time,
but in case, of war short notice would
be given to the men in charge of the
guns on the coast, whose costly ma
chinery requires much mechanical skill
and practice. Men fit to be trusted to
run great engines on our railroads, or
even the ordinary steamers of river
and lakes, cannot be called Into service
at a day's or a month's notice. To
handle, but especially to fire with pre
cision, the new guns require the highest
class of skilled labor. A careful esti
mate of the annual additional expendi
ture required to maintain the two regi
ments is $530,054. But some months will
expire before the regiments can be fully
enlisted and organized, and while the
scale of 'the first year, with its equip
ment, will be very considerably greater
than that of average subsequent years,
it is believed that $450,000, possibly less,
will suflice for the fiscal year 1899. It is

AMERICANS
ADVISED
TO LEAVE
Copyright, I 80& by James Gordon Bennett
HAVANA. Feb. 22.â Americans
in Havana have been quietly
notified by Consul-General Lee
that It might be well for them
to send their families to a place
of safety. These precautions
were taken in view of the fact
that there is a strong suspicion
that the volunteers â anti-Ameri
can and anti-autonomy â have
been inspired to create trouble
in case the Maine inquiry proves
that the catastrophe was due to
design.
In justice to the authorities in
Havana, I can say that they are'
taking every precaution in their
power to protect all foreigners
alike.
That
scarcely worth while to enlarge upon
the wisdom of establishing the defenses I
of our very extended coast. Successive j
Congresses have vigorously and liber- i
ally asserted it.
To this is added a number of re
ports, including a letter from Acting
Secretary Meudejohn and General
Miles, the latest being a letter from
General Miles, written yesterday, in â 
which he says: "My Dear Sir: Refer- j
ring to our conversation this morning, i
I have the hon'>r to state that batteries j
have been placed in position in new |
fortifications at Portland Head, Maine; i
Grovers Cliff, Boston harbor; Fort
Hancock, approach to Philadelphia; ap- J
proaches to Washington; the coast of j
North Carolina: Charleston harbor; Mo- !
bile. Ala.: Galve"ston, Tex': Fort Bake^\
Cal. ; Fort Point, Cal., and Fort Stev- i
ens, Or. Batteries will also be placed
within a few months on new fortifica
tions at Great Diamond Lake, Port
land, Me.; Fort Constitution, Ports- j
mouth, N. H. ; Long Island Head, Bos- |
ton harbor; Dutch Island, Narragan- |
sett Bay, R. I.; eastern entrance to
Long Island Sound, N. V. ; Delaware !
City, Del.; approaches to Baltimore; j
approaches to Washington; approaches ;
to Savannah, Ga. ; New Orleans; San
Diego, Cal.: entrance to Puget Sound.
Wasn., making in all twenty-six new
seacost fortifications for the defense of
the great cities of the Atlantic, Gulf
and Pacific coasts, where fortifications
have been and are being erected and
where artillery is required to protect
and man these batteries. We are send
ing small detachments of men to keep
them in fair condition and protect the
ammunition, but these are not suffi
cient to man said batteries, hence the
necessity for two additional regiments
of artillery is imperative and requires
immediate attention."
There are also reports from General
Wilson and General Flngler, showing
the necessity for the additional force.
It seems probable that the bill which
passed the Senate to-day to create ad- I
ditional regiments of artillery will pass I
the House without much opposition if \
it is reported while* the Hcuse is in its
present temper. The military affairs
committee has jurisdiction over this
bill, and Chairman Hull is now absent
at his home In lowa. No opposition is
likely to be encountered from the ap
propriations committee. Chairman !
Cannon is heartily in favor of it, but
he wants it distinctly understood that
his support is in nowise based upon
sentiment produced by the Maine dis
aster or any idea that the situation is
at all critical.
"I favor the bill," said he to-day,
"because I believe the guns in the for
tifications we are building should be.
manned."

is a feeling of relief in official circles
over the recovery of the cipher code
and signal books from the wreck of
the second-class battleship Maine. Of
ficial announcement of their recovery
was contained in a dispatch received
last night from Captain Sigsbee, the
vessel's commander who has placed
them on board the supply ship Fern.
These books will remain in the custody
of the Fern's commander until the re
turn of his vessel to Key West, when
they will be placed under the charge of
an officer and sent to-the Navy Depart
ment.
Appreciating the importance of pre
venting the books from falling into
strange hands, I understand that the
first dispatch sent by Secretary Long
to Captain Sigsbee after the issuance
of orders for the recovery of the dead
bodies of the lost sailors, directed that
the wreck be closely guarded and no
persons be allowed to approach it who
had no business there. The Depart
ment was on tender hooks until the re
ceipt of the information announcing
the safety of the books.
"Had the books fallen into the pos
session of the Spaniards," said a prom
inent official to- me to-day, "the result
would have been extremely embarrass
ing to this Government. Of necessity,
the first step taken would have been
to adopt a new cipher and signal code
and to have distributed them to all the
United States men-of-war in the
world. This would have taken time.
"If war had been in progress during
that period, the fact that our cipher
and signal codes were in the po-ssesslon
of our enemy would have been most
embarrassing to the naval forces of
this country, and the falling of any im
portant ciphers .into Spanish hands
would have naturally resulted in giv
ing them an opportunity to meet any
surprise movement we might have at
tempted." ________________
Cromwell Line Steamers Stop.
NEW YORK, Feb. 22.â A New Or
leans special to the Herald says: New
Orleans shippers are advised that no
more Cromwell line steamers will sail
for this port from New York until fur
ther orders from Washington. The
United States cruiser Marblehead now
here for the Mardi Gras suddenly step
ped receiving visitors about noon and
there was hustle and bustle aboard. It
is reported that she has orders to be
ready to move at a moment's notice.
CRUISER
VIZCAYA
COALED
Due Precautions Taken
to Guard Against
Cranks.
There Will Be No Dynamite Found
in the Bunkers of the Big
Spanish Warship.
NEW YORK, Feb. 22.â The
Spanish cruiser Vizcaya may
leave New York on Thursday.
She can hardly finish coaling: be
fore that time. Captain Eulate
said to-day he did not know ex
actly when he would sail, and
the Spanish Consul told me last
evening that orders regarding
the ship's departure had not
been received.
Captain Eulate decorated the
ship to-day in honor of Wash
ington's birthday, and received
on board Rear Admiral Bunce
and General Merritt. Three sa
lutes were fired by the cruiser
one of twenty-one guns at noon,
to mark the visitor's observance
of the holiday, and the others
when Admiral Bunce and Gen
eral Merritt went up her side.
Captain Eulate's decision to take coal
on board her in spite of an early an-
nouncement from Spanish sources that
he would not do so was in line with
his assertion when he arrived that ho
was in a friendly port and had no
apprehension regarding the safety of
his ship. Two coal barges towed by a
tug approached the Vizcaya soon after
her crew had breakfasted below, and
by 8 o'clock one was lying to the port
and one to starboard of her, and she
commenced the work of passing up
fuel. Although Tier coal carrying ca
pacity is great, the long run from Spain
to this port had pretty nearly ex
hausted her supply, and as she has a
Tun of several days to Havana before
her it was absolutely necessary to re
fill the bunkers.
Due precautions were taken to ascer
tain that the coal contained no explo
sive and that no crank or fanatic had
approached it. Captain Eulate ordered
the coal through the Spanish Consul.
Senor Baldasano notified the navy-
yard of the arrangements he was mak
ing to supply the cruiser and a guard
boat was kept alongside the coal
barges at Communipaw on Monday
and until yesterday morning, when
they were towed to the cruiser.
This coal was passed up in bags and
baskets and was really subjected to
two inspections before it reached the
ship's bunkers. A lieutenant was sta
tioned on each barge and the men
worked under his direction. Another
officer was stationed on deck, and it is
believed the coal was poured out of the
bags under his eyes.
No one on board the cruiser ap
peared to entertain any fear regarding
an attempt to tamper with the coal.
Indeed, they laughed over the work of
coaling as they have laughed over the
vigilance of the patrol boats which
have surrounded them since the Viz
caya anchored. The work was con
tinued all day, except for half an hour
during the visits of Rear Admiral
Bunce and General Merritt.
The Undine left the navy yard at
halfpast ten o'clock in the morning
with the Rear Admiral, Commander
Gilmore, his senior aid and flag lieu
tenant, Aaron Ward. They arrived
alongside the Vizcaya at ten minutes
after eleven o'clock. A bugle summon
ed for a guard of marines and when
they were lined up. Admiral Bunce as
cended and was received by the Viz
caya's commander, with whom he ex
changed salutes. Mingling witfi the
cruiser's officers. Commander Gilmoro
and Lieutenant Ward followed Ad
miral Bunce and Captain Eulate to the
latter's quarters. The visit was brief,
and after an exchange of courtesies
the admiral went over the side to the
music of "The Star Spangled Banner"
played by the ship's band. The gun
ners manned the secondary batteries,
the admiral's launch moved a few
lengths from the cruiser, a gun sound
ed and Admiral Bunce stood up hold
ing his- cocked hat in his hand until
thirteen reports were counted and the
smoke curled above the flag trimmed
Vizcaya.
Then he donned his hat and the
launch shot away.
General Merritt, commanding the de
partment of the East, arrived a little
later with Lieutenants Hale, Mott and
Strother. He was saluted by fifteen j
guns as he departed, getting two more i
than Rear Admiral Bunce. although
their ranks are really regarded as j
equal.
The crowded ferry boats carried
thousands of visitors to Staten Island
to-day to see the Vizcaya. It was a
holiday crowd, good natured and rich
in comment. Comparing the Vizcaya
with vessels of the white squadron was
the chief amusement. The sightseers
carried field glasses, cameras and
sketch books, and took away matty
pictures of the cruiser. Some of them
were rowed out toward her until the
police warned them off. A party of
ten careless young fellows approached
as near as possible and sang patriotic
American airs for the benefit of the
Vizcaya's company. â¢
Senor Baldasano, Spanish Con
sul-General, went on board before
noon. As he walked to the
landing: in Tompkinsville crowds of
boys, seeing gold braid on his ha^
followed him, Jeering. He paid no at
tention to the childish demonstration,
estimating it properly as the foolish
ness of children.
The Vlzcaya's flags, of which she
displayed several hundred, were taken
down at sunset, and to-morrow she
will show her ensign at half-mast once
more as a sign of mourning for the
Maine's crew.
When night settled on the bay tha
big cruiser floated at anchor off Tomp
kinsville as if she had been in a mill
pond. The sky was obscured by clouds,
but hardly a breath of wind stirred,
and every sound on board the vessel
could be heard with almost startling
distinctness ashore.
Bugle notes, sounding clear and loud
along shore, called the men to their
quarters at 8 o'clock, and after that
the only signs of life on the -water
were the patrolling launches that
guarded her.
Counsel-General Baldasano was seen
this afternoon and asked if he was
satisfied with the reception given to
Captain Eulate by the representatives
of the nation and city.
"I must be pleased and delighted
with the reception. We received royal
welcome wherever we went," was the
reply.
"It has been said," it was ventured,
"that Mayor Van Wyck did not extend
a welcome to Captain Eulate >when you
and the captain called at the City
Hall."
"That should not be said. We en
tered the Mayor's office unannounced.
He was. busy and his office was crowd
ed with men. He received us cordially,
but we saw that he was busy and we
soon withdrew."
"What do you think of the naval
and police protection given to the
Vizcaya?"
"That is an evidence of the friendly
relations existing between the two
countries that we appreciate. Of
course, we could not and would not
have asked for it, but that it was of
fered is a matter of gratification to aU
representatives of the Spanish Gov
ernment here."
"Do you care to express your opin
ion regarding the explosion that wreck
ed the Maine?"
"Of that I can say nothing more
than that Spaniards here, at Havana
and in Spain are satisfied with the
methods adopted by the United States
Government for carrying on the invest-
igation."
HOURS FOR DRILL
ARE INCREASED.
Begulars and Militia of Missouri
Are Well Prepared for Active
Service.
NEW YORK, Feb. 22.â A St. Louis
special to the Herald says: The hours
for drill at Jefferson barracks, ten miles
south of St. Louis, were increased, but
Colonel Wessels, commanding the post,
states that it has no relation to the
present strained relation between the
United States and Spain. Colonel Wes
sels says that he has received no in
structions fiom Washington. The
hours for athletic driil have also been
lengthened and there is unusual activ
ity at the post.
Colonel Baldorf, commanding the
First Regiment, National Guards of
Missouri, which is located here, says
that the regiment is now full and upon
a war footing and prepared to move
within twenty-four hours. It is fully
equipped for a campaign and is one
of the best drilled regiments in the
country. Several meetings have been
held in the last few days and hun
dreds of men have signed enlistment
papers which were passed around at
meetings, but no denunciatory speeches
have been delivered. General Brad
ley, who led the Illinois coal miners
against the operators, has written to
a local paper stating that he is pre
pared to organize a company and re
port at any point for duty.
EMPLACEMENTS ARE
NOW COMPLETED.

pearing guns at Fort Caswell at the
mouth of Cape Fear River are com
pleted. The guns are mounted. The
building of barracks begins at once.
Officers and men are looked for in two

Words of Sympathy.
At a meeting of the members of
Pickwick Lodge of the Sons of St.
George, held last Monday night, the
subject of the disaster on the Maine
was brought up and discussed, after
which the following resolution was
adopted:
Resolved, That the members of Pick
wick Lodge note with deep sorrow the
terrible disaster that befell our beloved
country a few days since in the loss oc
the warship Maine, and whereby so many
of our brave sailors were suddenly hurled
into eternity.
Resolved, That this expression of our
sympathy be sent to the San Francisco

CONGRESS TO STRENGTHEN THE NAVY
WILL BUILD
THE LARGEST
OF WARSHIPS
Uncle Sam to Construct the
George Washington in
One Year.
In Addition to This the Senate
Passes the Bill Providing for
Two More Regiments to
Man Coast Defenses.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. 22.
As soon as the reading of the his
toric farewell address of Washington
was concluded by Lodge of Massachu
setts in the Senate t<>-day, Hawley of
Connecticut, chairman of the Military
Affairs Committee, called up the bill
providing for the enlistment of two
additional regiments of artillery for
service in manning the heavy coast
defense batteries which Congress has
provided during the past two years.
Bate of Tennessee objected to the
bill, because it tended to an increase
of the army, to which he said he was
unalterably opposed. He thought that
there were enough troops already un
der enlistment to man .ill the guns
now being provided for by the Govern
ment. He argued that it would be bet
ter to assign infantry regiments to the
manning of these guns than to put
them in charge of raw recruits.
In reply Hawley pointed out that the
strength of the army was really de
creasing in proportion to the inhabi
tants of the country. In addition, he
said. Congress had made large appro
priations in recent years for great guns
for forts and coast defense stations.
Of these guns 139 were guns of large
caliber and delicate mechanism. To
these must be added 232 rifled steel
mortars already paced. or soon to be
placed, in the coast defense stations.
In order that these guns may be prop
erly handled a body of trained men is
necessary. Each of these great war
engines requires to handle it as much
skill as it requires to run a locomotive
or an ordinary river steamer. The War
Department estimates that the 1600
men which this bill calls for will be
np^Fsao' to properly man these guns.
Cockrell of Missouri said he was op
posed to an increase in the infantry
or cavalry arms of the service, but in
this case the country was confronted
by a serious condition. He regarded
it as necessary that the guns provided
by the Government should be properly
cared fnr and manned. For that rea
son he had consented as a member of
the committee to have the bill favora
bly reported.
The bill was then passed, 62 to 4.
The negative votes were cast by Bate
of Tennessee. Clay of Georgia, Chilton
of Texas and Vest of Missouri.
Morgan of Alabama secured the
adoption of the following resolution:
"That the Committee on Naval Af
fairs is instructed to inquire and re
port whether a man-of-war equal, at
least, to any warship in the world, to
be named the George Washington, can
be built, armed and commissioned
within a period of twelve months by
the use of the facilities of the ship
yards, machine shops, mines and for
ests of the United States, wherever the
same are found, and that the commit
tee have leave to report at any time
by bill or otherwise."
The resolution was adopted without
debate.
At 1:30 the Senate went into execu
tive session, and at 4 p. m. adjourned.
SENTIMENTS OF SOME
OF THE STATESMEN.
Senator Morgan and Others Speak
of the Neccessities of
the Navy.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 22.â Tn an in
terview Senator Morgan said to-night.
"In view of the foreign complications
that now threaten us, I assumed that
Congress was willing to be more liberal
with appropriations for the navy and
it occurred to me that this might be a
good time to provide for a new naval
ship to take the place of the Maine. The
new vessel might properly be named
the George Washington and this na
tional memorial day was a very proper
time to introduce such a resolution. It
is singular that none of our war vessels
have been named in honor of the father
of our country. The Navy Department
has very properly named most of our
vessels after the several States, but it
seems to me that there should be a de
parture in naval nomenclature and we
should honor the memory, not only of
our military and naval heroes, but our
illustrious statesmen as well. The in
troduction of my resolution on this na
tional holiday was therefore deemed
an appropriate sentiment by my col
ADVERTISEMENTS.

ing. Pears' Soap es-
tablished over ioo

leagues. They passed the resolution,
and I have strong hopes that the
Goerge Washington will within a year
be'added to our navy."
Senator Morgan was asked whether.
In his opinion, the destruction of the
Maine would have a tendency to make
Congress more liberal or more eco
nomical in its appropriations for war
vessels. He replied: "It all depends
on the report of the naval court at Ha
vana. If the court finds that the Maine
â¢was blown up by the Spanish, the
tendency, of course, will be toward a
great increase in our navy, for in that
event war can scarcely be avoided. But
if it appears that the ship was de
stroyed by reason of the carelessness
of our naval officers, many members of
Congress (remembering the disasters
that have overtaken other American
naval vessels) will naturally say What
is the use? We might as well throw
our money into the sea.' "
A leading member of the House Ap
propriations Committee expressed this
view of the matter to-night when he
said to The Call correspondent: "Ip
to date the modern steel-clad battle
ship has only been a peril to herself
I and a holy terror to those on board of
l and inside of her. Except for the one
i naval battle between a Japanese and a
! Chinese cruiser and the little scrim
mage in front of Alexandria, Egypt,
| when the English fleet silenced the
'â  Egyptian shore batteries, the present
I type of steel-clad battle-ship has never
! done anything but blow up or run on
| mud banks or sink at sea or cut up
j some caper dangerous to her crew and
costly to her owner. Moreover, Just as
soon as millions are Invested in these
metal monsters, the type is changed
and more millions are sunk.
"The whole mad struggle for power is
a costly folly. It is folly which we,
thanks to our isolation and the com-
I pactness of our country, can escape if
i we will mind our own business, in our
nwn proper sphere. Yet, despite these
heavy tuition fees in the school of bit
ter experience, a conspiracy is afoot to
annex the Sandwich Islands and start
a grand colonial scheme, throwing
away the greatest advantage we have
possessed as a nation over all others in
our isolation which has exempted us
from maintaining either an army or a
navy of any size."
Congressman Hilborn of California, a
member of the Naval Affairs Commit
tee, believes that the monitor is the
best type of naval ship for harbor de
fense, although, of course, a monitor
cannot carry coal enough for a long
cruise. He says: "The modern battle
ship is purely the emanation of the
human brain. Theoretically this great
steel battleship, weighing 11,000 tons,
protected by heavy armor, a floating
fortress, is a powerful engine of naval
warfare. But what she would do in
action no one knows. She has cost
millions of dollars and carries withiii
her sides hundreds of human beings,
but a little torpedo of insignificant cost
touching her sides would send her to
the bottom with all her precious freight
of human life."
It must not be inferred from this,
however, that Mr. Hilborn does not ad
vocate liberal appropriations to put our
nrmy and navy on a respectable and
safe war footing, but he believes in an
other style of battleship, constructed
on the monitor plan and besides he is
in favor of a Government factory for
the production of our ammunition.
A Congressman who is a strong i^vo
cate of the seamen's bill said: "We
can have no assurance of safety for
our naval vessels as long as they are
manned by crews composed largely of
foreigners. Any one who can read the
list of the dead and of the saved crew
of the Maine cquld not but be im
pressed with the preponderance of for
eigners who composed the crew of the
unfortunate vessel. American vessels
should be manned by loyal Americans.
They cannot be educated in the ap
prentice schools, but must have years
of hard and practical experience, but
under our existing laws the sea offers
no temptation to our youth. The hard
exactions that shipmasters are now al
lowed to impose upon sailors must be
removed by Congress before we will
be able to enlist American seamen for
our naval vessels.
"A seaman is a slave and can be im
prisoned for failing to carry out a civil
contract. He may be flogged and abus
ed. All of this must be remedied by
Coneress. If not foreign sailors will
continue to compose the crews of mer
chant vessels and therefore our naval
ships will also have to enlist foreign
ers, for our naval apprentice schools
do not and will not accomplish the pur
pose intended and must continue to
employ for our naval vessels practical
famen who are under existing condi
tions chiefly of foreign birth. In order
to guard against explosions from inter
nal cause we must have good, loyal
Americans for a crew. I think that the
seamen's bill advocated by Andrew
Furuseth of San Francisco and the Sea
man's Union, and introduced by Sena
tor Frye. will be passed by Congress.
At fcny rate its chance of success is
greatly improved on account of the
Maine disaster."

REGULARS ARE
READY FOR WAR
Brave Boys in Blue Want
- a Brush With the
'Spaniards.
Work of Strengthening the
Harbor 'Defenses Goes
Steadily On.
There Is a Prospect That Angel Island
May Be Abandoned as a Mili
tary Station.
Officers and enlisted men stationed at
the Presidio received with delight yes
terday the news that the Senate had
voted unanimously to authorize an in
crease of the army by the addition of
two more regiments of artillery. More
soldiers of this branch of the service
are needed. The force of artillerymen
at the Presidio is not sufficient to
properly man the high power guns al
ready in position. When additional
guns arrive to fill the emplacements
now ready the need of more troops will
be urgent.
The impression that there is a regi
ment of artillery at the Presidio is
wide of the true mark. There are only
four batteries of artillery at this gar
rison and two of these are light bat
teries. The only troops available to
handle the modern guns are Batteries
A and H of the Third Artillery. Bat
tery D of this regiment is at San
Diego; X Battery is at Alcatraz; E is
at Fort Mason; L is at Lime Point
(Fc-rt Baker); M is at Fort Canby; B
is at Fort Monroe and Batteries G and
I are at Angel Island.
Yesterday Battery H was on duty at
the works near Fort Point, where the
modern high-power guns are placed.
Since the recent ordei% from Gen. Miles
directing that extra caution be observ
ed at the forts, the men of the Third
Artillery have not been able to perform
all the duties enjoined. Details for
guard duty have been made from the
First Infantry. The Fourth Cavalry
has supplied mounted patrolmen.
It may be necessary to bring from
Angel Island the two batteries of the
regiment stationed at that post and to
transfer the battery at Fort Mason to
a point near the main works of de
fense. No provision has been made
for barracks at the places where the
Section of the Maine, Showing the Forward
Magazines and Pocket Coal-Bunkers.
troops are most needed. The comfort
able barracks at the Presidio are dis
tant one mile and a half from the ten
and twelve inch batteries of Fort
Point. Tents could be pitched at the
front, and this may become necessary.
It is surmised that the increase of
tke artillery force will bring more
troops of this branch of the service to
San Francisco. It is probable that An
gel Island as a military station may be
wholly abandoned. The fight to pro
tect the harbor and the city must be
made at the heads, and as a final re
sort in the narrow channel between
Lime Point and Fort Point. A hostile
fleet powerful enough to defeat Uncle
Sam's ironclads and battle-ships in an
engagement outside and then run the
gauntlet of the forts on either side of
the Golden Gate channel would soon
siler.ce the Angel Island batteries.
An admiral with the courage and
skill of a Farragut or Nelson might
attempt with a powerful fleet of arm
ored ships to pass the batteries defend
ing the entrance to the -larbor of San
Francisco, but few fleet commanders
would venture upon a movement so
full of peril and with such remote
chance of success. As the works of
defense now stand the fire of six 12
inch guns, five 10-inch guns, sixteen
heavy mortars and three dynamite
puns could be concentrated on a hos
tile fleet. The 12-inch rifles have a
range of ten miles. The mortars and
pneumatic dynamite guns have a
range of four miles.
Apart from these modern guns there
are many effective 15-inch smooth
bores and 8-inch rifles of the old pat
tern. The 10-inch smooth bores, which
were converted into 8-inch rifles, shoot
with remarkable accuracy. Artillery
men cf the United States service have
a great admiration for the converted
8-inch rifles. A soldier of the Third
Artillery at the Presidio yesterday re
marked: "We used to keep a tug
busy setting up targets for these guns.
The projectile goes to the mark with
the directness of a bullet from a small
rifle. The six or eight rifles of this
pattern now lying on the ground near
Fort Point ought to be sent over to
Lime Point and placed near the water
line."
The enlisted men of the Third Ar
tillery believe that a war with Spain
would do the country good. They fig
ure that the regular army could easily
absorb 25,000 men, and this force to
gether with volunteer regiments would
make an army sufficient to whip the
Spaniards in Cuba. It is admitted that
the regiments of the regular army
have not, as organizations, ever en
gaged in battle, although many of
them have been tried under fire during
Indian campaigns.
"If the Spanish troops ever encoun
ter American soldiers they will quickly
understand what fighting means. They
have been bushwhacking in Cuba for
several years, but if American troops
go there they will have to fight in the
open or leave the island. We have the
men and the money to win if we go to
war, and it is now time that foreign
nations understood that Americans
would fight. If we do not have war
over this Maine affair the Spaniards
will think we are a nation of cowards
and offer some other provocation.
Whether war is declared or not the
present war talk will do good. It will
show the country the need of preparing
to fight. We will get more men. more
guns and more ships. This regiment,
the Third Artillery, is ready at any
time for a fight with Spain."
The dynamite guns at the Presidio
are carefully guarded, and no one is al
lowed to enter the compressed air plant
without a permit from headquarters.
The immense guns are covered as a
weather protection. Each gun is capa
ble of throwing 500 pounds of dynamite
a distance of four miles. Three shots
from each can be fired in quick succes
sion.
Recent orders issued by General
Shafter prescribe that on the 20th of
each month post commanders submit
a schedule for the approval of the de
partment commander for such drills
and exercises, including practical in
struction contemplated by orders from
the adjutant-general's office at Wash
ington, as they may deem most neces
sary for their commands for the month
following. These drills must embrace
athletic instruction, preferably such as
may be joined in by the entire organi
zation, as the department commander
deems this more important than ath
letic instruction to a few who show
special aptitude. In this connection at
tention is directed to the "Manual of
Physical Drill," prepared by Lieuten
ant E. L. Butts, U. S. A., and author
ized for the use of the troops by the
Secretary of War. It is contemplated
to have practice marches for all arms
of the service in this command early
in the year. The concentration of the
heavy artillery troops at the Presidio
for practical artillery instruction and
target practice will take place in the
months of May and June. The practice
season for smallarma for the cavalry
in the department of California is an
nounced as follows for the current
year: Revolver practice, March; car
bine practice, April and May.
The cordon of precaution is being
drawn tighter and tighter about the
defenses of San Francisco and the bay,
as the prospect of war grows nearer,
and each day brings some new regu
lation to prevent the possibility of
Spanish agents ascertaining the real
strength of the forces stationed here.
The latest order went into effect yes
terday when mounted soldiers were
sent to guard all the means of entering
the Presidio except the one where the
Union street railway terminates.
All o-f those who tried to enter with
out permits were quietly but firmly
told that such passports were neces
sary and that they must be procured
to enter the reservation. Those who
entered the Presidio by the Union
street line were under constant sur
veillance and were not permitted ti
get beyond the range of vision of the
vigilant guards.
ORDERED FROM
GALVESTON TO KEY WEST.
NEW YORK, Feb. 22.â A Galveston
(Texas) special to the Herald says. To
morrow -will end the visit of the bat
tle-ship Texas and gunboat NtaahTiUe

ceed to sea directly after breakfast.
She will be followed between 11 nnd 4
o'clock by the Texas. The destina
tion of both vessels is Key West, where
they will rejoin the flag of Admiral Si
card. Beyond that they have received
no orders, or if they have their com
manders have been careful not to dis
close them. Commander Maynard of
the Nashville, when asked how he
fancied the idea of being ordered to
Havana to replace the unfortunate
Maine, evaded the question, answering
it in saying his orders took him from

SAN DIEGO, Feb. 22.â The third 10
inch rifle for the Ballast Point fortifica

HOW SPAIN
BUTCHERED
AMERICANS
Story of the Revolting
Massacre in Cuba
Retold.
Alex Matheson Describes the
" Virginius Affair " and the Pop
ular Clamor at That Time
for War Against Spain.
The present state of national excite
ment over the destruction of the Maine
and the death of more than half of her
brave crew recalls to my mind most
vividly certain events which took place
on the Atlantic shore a quarter of a
centUFj' ago.
To most of the young men of the
present a reference to "the Virginius
affair" means very little. It was, as
events proved, merely an incident in
ous history, and has been given very
little space in the printed records of our
past. To the American men, young and
old, however, who were alive in 1873,
that "incident" meant much, and for a
time it seemed as if the country, just
recovering as it was from the effects
of an internecine war, was to be forced
by her excited and righteously angered
people into a sudden and retributive
conflict with the same kingdom against
which our hearts are now up in arms.
The story can be briefly told: The
Cuban insurrection, begun October 10.
1868, by 128 men under the leadership
of Charles M. de Cespedes, had endured
for just five years of varying fortunes
for the opposing forces, when the
steamer Virginius, a regularly docu
mented American vessel under com
mand of Captain Frey of New Orleans,
was captured by the Spaniards just
outside Jamaica in neutral waters and
the 183 men who comprised her officers,
crew and passengers were made pris
oners of war. Of these unfortunates
fifty-three were executed, or rather,
butchered, almost immediately in the
city of Santiago de Cuba; they were
shot down by a detachment of soldiers,
and their still palpitating bodies
trampled on by cavalry and run over
by military wagons, after which their
heads were hacked off and carried
through the town on spikes.
Such revoltingly cruel acts were In
themselves sufficient to arouse the in
dignation of a civilized country, but
when it was known that 35 of the vic
tims â some of them beardless boys
whose love of adventure alone had lur
ed them from horne â were bona fide
citizens of the United States, a tidal
wave of outraged feeling swept over
the entire land. Though every section
of the country was roused by the news
of the dreadful tragedy the real storm
center was the city of New York. The
headquarters of the Cuban junta were
there, which insured direct and con
stant communication with the unhap
py island, and the fact that a number
of the butchered men were former resi
dents of New York and Brooklyn made
the horror of the affair felt there with
special keenness.
When the news first came it seemed
as if every man in the vicinity of New
York harbor went wild. Business of
all kinds was neglected and the streets
were full of excited men in groups and
crowds, talking together, reading the
bulletins, or listening to the impromp
tu speakers reviewing the situation
and urging the remedy. And the only
remedy that was suggested during
those days of furious and unreasoning
indignation was war. That we could
"whip Spain with one hand tied be
hind us" was the universal opinion
publicly and loudly expressed. Print
ing House Square was packed with
people feverishly waiting for addi
tional details from Cuba and news
from Washington, and the vicinity of
the Herald office, then situated at the
corner of Broadway and Ann street,
was so densely crowded that it was al
most impossible for the omnibuses to
make their way up and down.
Anonymous posters and handbills
speedily made their appearance sum
moning all citizens to a mass meeting
at Cooper Institute, and on the night
appointed that immense hall was
jammed and at least a score of "over
flow meetings" were held elsewhere,
half a dozen being organized in the im
mediate vicinity of the hall. To facili
tate matters all foreigners in attend
ance were segregated and asked to go
to different localities, where they were
addressed by orators speaking their
special language, and messengers were
constantly sent from the main body in
the Institute to these meetings to keep
them informed of all that took place
there.
The outcome of this Immense gather
ing was a message to the President
from the citizens of New York and vi
cinity offering to furnish both men and
money to begin and carry on an ag
gressive campaign against Spain on sea
and shore, and asking only the Govern
ment's sanction.
As soon as this message was sent
preparations for war began~ln earnest
among us. Recruiting offices were
opened In various parts of the city and
provisional enlistment was general. All
classes were represented In the enroll
ment lists, war veterans, professional
and business men, and mechanics and
laborers. All were eager to help wipe
out the insult offered to their country
and avenge the undeserved deaths
suffered by their countrymen.
I was a young fellow then, with a
wide acquaintance In the sister cities.
It took me Just two days to raise a
company of 100 men, not one of whom
was over 25 or was unable to pass a
strict military medical examination.
Captain Thompson, who had com
manded a New York company in tha
civil war, was to be colonel of our regi
ment, and he wished me to- take th*
captaincy of my company, but I felt
that I was neither old enough nor wlae
enough in military matters to fill such
a position and we compromised by my
taking the office of first lieutenant.
Just previous to the Virginius af
fair one of Spain's finest cruisers, the
Arapales, lay up in the Brooklyn
navy-yard for cleaning and overhaul
ing. As soon as there was a rumor
of war the captain was naturally anx
ious to get away, and hurried the
workmen up. fearing that he might be
made a prisoner. The workmen were
strangely slow, but at last even they
were unwillingly obliged to pronounce
the ship ready for sea. Then three
days were spent in looking for a pilot,
but every .one of those useful persons
was found unaccountably busy. At
last one was secured, one of the best
on the bay, and the captain's troubles
seemed at an end. Unfortunately, how
ever, this most excellent pilot who had
never before met with an accident,
awkwardly ran his charge on a hid
den rock, and back she had to go to
the navy-yard for additional repairs,
which it required a whole week to
finish.
During this time the captain, who
seemed to have been of a singularly
suspicious turn of mind, and was
moreover noted as being th*> most vol
uble and accomplished swearor to whom
New York had ever listened, famil
iarized himself with the channel suf
ficiently to take his ship out
and proceeded to do so as soon as she
was afloat again. The New Yorkers
saw him slipping through their fingers
without expressing the least regret and
much friendly sympathy was BhownjL
when misfortune again overtook him.
Just as he was entering East River
after loudly declaring that he never
wanted to see America nor anything
American again, fate or iankee inge
nuity interfered once more. A tug
boat with several barges loaded with
coal for the Williamsburg sugar re
fineries steamed across his path and
three of the barges, afterward ascer
tained to have been bored full of auger
holes, sunk directly before him. It
took days to raise them, for all man
ner of small accidents happened to the
hoisting machinery, much to the loudly
expressed wonder and regret of the
American workmen employed, and all
that time the Spanish captain simply
raved and roared, to the silent delight
of his unofficial but very determined
jailers.
Not until the uncertainty -was over
and war was no longer threatening
was that cleverly caged cruiser, which
would have been, as we all know, a
rich prize in case of conflict between
her nation and our own, allowed right
of way out to the broad Atlantic.

Evidence of the Cruelties
Inflicted by Spaniards
Presented.
Senator Morgan Shows That Six
Hundred Thousand People
Have Perished During
the Present War.
Call Office, Rlggs House,
Washington, Feb. 22.
Cuba usurped the place of Hawaii in
the executive proceedings of the Sen
ate to-day and was under consideration
for an hour or more. The proceeding
was based upon a document presented
by Senator Morgan of Alabama as the
result of an interview between himself
and Mr. Koop of Boston, Mass. In
presenting the document Senator Mor
gan said that Mr. Koop was a capital
let who had recently returned from
Cuba after a most exhaustive explora
tion of the island.
Senator Morgan laid considerable
stress upon the importance of the doc
ument, which resulted from a stenog
raphic report of the interview between
Senator Morgan and Mr. Koop. The
document consisted of questions by-
Senator Morgan and replies by Mr.
Koop. The latter said he had been In
forty-three provinces and had spent
more or less time in each of them in
the prosecution of his inquiries.
In no place outside of Havana, he
eald. was any effort made to take care
of the reconcentrados, and he declared
that the people were dying in great
numbers in all places in which they had
been collected together by the Spanish,
both as a result of the cruelty of the
Spanish troops and for the lack of food.
He declared that there was no evidence
in the provinces of a more liberal treat
ment of these unfortunate people under
the administration of General Blanco
than there had been under the Weyler
retrime. and said that the peopie in gen
eral were in just as deplorable a condi
tion now as they had beer, before the
change.
In no case were the concentrados al
lowed to go outside the military posts
to collect food, and while there was
pome effort in certain instances to grow
crops in the immediate vicinity of the
garrisons, these crop areas did not ex
tentl morÂ»Â» thrn 500 yards from the
forts. He added that if the people
were allowed to get out they could get
er.'Hijrh to eat to keep soul and body
together, but that when even small

children attempted to go outside of the
guard lines they were shot down as
ruthlessly as if they were enemies in
arms. He said that he had seen women
and children abused by the Spanish
soldiers, and that a favorite pastime
seemed to be to kick the women about
as if they were dogs.
Mr. Koop also devoted considerable
space, at Senator Morgan's suggestion,
to the scheme of autonomy under the
liberal ministry and pronounced it a
failure from one end of the island to
another. He said that business was at
a standstill throughout the country;
that few crops were growing, and that
desolation and ruin stared the traveler
in the face wherever he went. As a
consequence property was much depre
ciated in % alue and the people were
gr?atly discouraged. He said that the
general estimate was that the war had
already resulted in the loss of 600,000
lives, and Mr. Koop himself did not
consider these figures exaggerated.
There was some comment upon the
document by Senators Morgan, Gallin
ger and Mason, but no official action
was taken. Senator Mason said the
statement was no more than he had ex
pected to hear, and Senator Gallinger
declared that the picture drawn was
a deplorable one. He said that two
years ago he had advised that the
United States should intervene to put
a stop to the war, and that every de
velopment since had confirmed the wis
dom of the suggestion then made.
Probably Lieutenant Commander i
Wainwright, the executive officer of the â 
Maine, now assigned in Havana, will
be assigned to the duty of inspecting
the work as it proceeds.
The officers of the two wrecking com
panies to-day said that after the expe
dition was assembled in Havana har
bor a complete inspection of the wreck I
would be made and the exact line of
work determined upon. The facilities
will be ample, and all of the divers will
be able to work at one time in different !
parts of the wreck. Most of the lifting j
will be done by the smaller derrick, j
which is of sufficient capacity for the j
lighter upperworks of the Maine, and
it will take the monster derrick of the
Monarch to lift the huge turrets of the
Maine and the guns mounted within

them. Captain Humphreys stated that
the purpose was not to separate the
big guns from the turrets, but lift
them as a whole.
This will be a tremendous undertak
ing, as the combined weight of each
turret and gun is 166 tons. The Mon
arch can lift 260 tons, so there is an
ample margin of lifting power.
The wreckers were loth to express an
opinion as to their ability to raise the
hull of the Maine. Mr. Chapman and
Captain Humphreys stated that noth
ing but a close personal inspection
would permit a decision on that point.
They are hopeful, however, that the
ship can be brought to the .surface.
The iron barge Lone Star will be used
to receive the turrets, guns and wreck
age, and as fast as loads are made up
she will be towed to the Norfolk navy
yard.

Narrow Escape of the Steamship
George W. Elder From Seri
ous Disaster.
VICTORIA, Feb. 22.â The Portland
steamer George W. Elder, which put
into Departure Bay for coal to-day, re
ports a very narrow escape from de
struction on her tfip down from,
Alaska. The trouble commenced in the
great storm of Frida- 1 ' night, which was
encountered in Charlotte Pound.
The Elder became unmanageable in
the heavy seas. She was blown broad
side throu-*. Ooletas Channel, between
Vancouver Island and Galiano- Island,
and it was by great luck, added to the
herculean efforts of Captain Hinckle
and Pilots Edwards and Thompson,
that she escaped destruction on the
rocks close at hand, the channel being
less than half a mile wide.
The vessel was so tossed about that
all the passengers and many of the
crew were more or less Injured. A pas
senger named Davis from California
had his wrist broken. E. A. Cassel of
Juneau broke his knee cap. Pilot
Thompson was thrown from his bÂ»Tth
and suffered a broken rib. Officers of
the Elder say that so furious was the
storm that they would not be sur
prised to hear nf serious disaster to
some of the many small craft in the
north.
THE SEA STILL
HOLDS ITS DEAD
Bodies of None of the Clara
Nevada Wreck Victims
Recovered.
Definite Knowledge of the Identity
of the Passengers Yet
Lackiny.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
jrXEAU, Feb. 15 (via Seattle, Feb.
22).â There is little to be added to the ac
count of the awful loss of the Clara Ne
vada. Crews of several steamships which
have passecj the: scene of the wreck have
noticed the floating masts, still attached
to the sunken hull, and other wreckage,
but have seen no bodies. Even from
Skaguay there comes no definite news of
the identity of the passengers. It Is cer
tain, however, that A. Benicke of J. D.
Meyers & Co., Portland; Al Noyes of
Juneau and G. B. Saportas of New York
are among those lost.
\V. F. Su;iortas came down from
Skaguay last night. He was the last man
on board of the ship before she left
Skaguay, being there to bid his brother
farewell. George Bach, who saw the
burning steamer frum Seward City, says
the vessel was burning when he lirst- saw
her, and that this must have been after
the explosion. He hung a light out on the
dock and with a companion watched the
burning ship for four hours.
It is now said that the vessel carried
gunpowder, which is based on the fact
that a small box of fuse washed ashore.
The best opinion, however, is that her
boilers burst and that the explosion took
place before the fire. This Is borne out
by the fact that among the wreckage is
a great piece of her deck, a lot of new
chairs and tables and other things that
are not even scorched.
No steps have yet been taken to search
for the bodies, and, in short, outside of
those which may be confined in tne
vessel, the deep snow and wide territory
to be covered make any such enterprise
seem entirely hopeless.

PORT ANGELES, Feb. 22.â The steam

107 hours from San Francisco, bound for

much dissatisfaction on the part of the
passengers on acccount of the meat
served. It was the original intention of
the Whitelaw to take the outside passage,
but the passengers' compelled the captain
to come here for fresh meat and take the
insiue passage. . The rumors of mutiny of
the Whitelaw's crew were unfounded.

Daughters.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ATLANTA (Ga.), Feb. 22.â A special
from Columbia, S. C, to the Constitu
tion says: The most revo-lting crime
ever perpetrated by white men In
South Carolina was committed at Lake
City, Williamsburg County, at 1
o'clock this morning, when the Post
master, a negro, and his family, were
burned out of their home, the postmas
ter and a babe in arms killed, and his
wife and three daughters shot and
maimed for life.
Baker was appointed postmaster
three months ago. Lake City is a
town of 400 inhabitants, and the negro
population in the vicinity is large.
There was a protest against Baker's
appointment, but it was not a very
vigorous one. Three months ago, as
the postmaster was leaving the office
at night in company with several col
ored men, he was fired on from am
bush, but it was not known that the
would-be assassin was prompted by
other than personal malice.
Since then Baker moved his family
into a house on the outskirts of the
town, where he has also established
the postoffice. Last Tuesday night a
body of men, who kept concealed be
hind buildings and fences in the neigh
borhood, riddled the building with shot
and rifle bullets. They shot high, but
no one was hurt, and it was supposed
that they meant t<> convey a warning.
It was a short time before Senators
Tillman and McLaurin and Congress
man Horton had asked the Postmaster-
General to remove Baker because of
his color, and the request had been re
fused.
Baker did not move his family and
gave no evidence of being frightened.
He felt confident of protection from
Washington.
At 1 o'clock this morning a torch
was applied to thy postoffice and Ba
ker's house. Back of it, just within the
line of light, were over 100 white men
armed with pistols and shotguns. By
the time the fire amused the sleeping
family, consisting of the Postmaster,
his wife, four daughters, a son and an
infant at the breast, the crowd began
firing into the building.
A hundred bullet holes were made
through the thin boarding, and many
found lodgment in the people within.
Baker was the first to reach the door,
and he fell dead just wtthin the thres
hold, being shot in several places.
The mother had the baby in her
arms, and had reached the door over
her husband's body when a bullet
crashed through its skull and it fell to
the floor. She was shot in several
places. Two of the girls had their
arms broken close to the shoulders and
will probably lose them. Another of
the girls is believed to be fatally
wounded. The boy is shot. Two of the
seven occupants of the house escaped
with slight injuries.
The bodies of Baker and the infant
were cremated in the' building. All
mail matter was destroyed.
A Coroner's jury was impaneled this
evening, and it visited the charred re
mains and adjourned until Saturday.
There is general and bitter indignation
expressed everywhere.

TO ABOLISH CANADIAN
PACIFIC DIFFERENTIALS.
Gteat Northern and Northern Pacific
Railways Are Acting in
Concert.
CHICAGO, Feb. 22.â 1t is now reported
that the Great Northern and the North
ern Pacific roads have joined hands to
bring about an abolition of all Canadian
Pacific differentials and will insist that
to be an indispensable element in the set
tlement of the present transcontinental
rate war. These differentials are at the
bottom of the trouble. They have been a
source of annoyance and friction since
they have been in existence and now it is
claimed the present war offers an excel
lent opportunity of getting rid of them
once and forever. It is urged that there
is really mi reason for their existence.
Any disadvantages to which the Cana
dian Pacific may be subjected In compet
ing for transcontinental business on the
one hand are more than offset by ad% ran
tagres it enjoys on the other.
It may be that all the matters now in
dispute between the roads may be sub
mitted to arbitration for settlement. In
that case the Question of differentials
would have to abide the result, the same
:is all the other matters in dispute. Should
the war be fought out to a finish, how
ever, it is said the two roads named will
insist on the abolition of all differentials.

MONTEREY, Feb. 21.â The first game
warden ever appointed for Monterey
County has just been named by the Coun

the duties of his office at once. With the
appointment goes a curious provision,
and one which makes the affair
unique in county annals. The new war-

that should the board at any time con
sider him a superfluous official and re
3uest his resignation he will hand it in.
The game laws have always been kept
In this county and no trouble had over
them until recently, but during the past
year so many complaints have reached
the County Supervisors from persons who
allege that young fish have been taken
from the streams and game killed out of

able to appoint a warden for at least a
short period. E. H. Godat is the new
warden, and he will hereafter devote his
time to keeping intact in Monterey Coun

Circumstances Have Shown, How
ever, That the Disaster to the
v Maine Was Not Due to
an Accident.
"Whether the result of accident or
treachery, the blowing up of the Maine
and the destruction of more than half
her crew will lead to radical changes
in the methods of stowing and guard
ing explosives on shipboard. That a
departure from old-time custom In
this respect is necessary is shown by
the completeness of the Maine's de
struction, and the seemingly unfath
omable cause of it. The advent of high
power guns, enormously increased
charges, greater variety and destruc
tiveness of explosives all combine to
make the modern warship's magazines
something to be carefully constructed
and most scrupulously guarded.
The writer spent a number of years
in the nay and is familiar with both
the old and the new methods of storing
explosives on shinboard, and he does
not hesitate to say tÂ«at considering the
widely different character of ammuni
tion now in use the Ordnance Depart
ment" has not kept pace with modern
requirements in the matter of stow
age and measures for safety. The mag
azines of the Maine were located just
as they were in the old wooden frigates
of fifty years ago, long before torpedoes
were inventedâ down on the very floor
or "skin" of the ship where they
would receive the first impact from the
force of a torpedo. Add to that the
fact that modern powder for high power
guns is exploded by detonation ur con
cussion and not by contact with lire,
and the danger of locating magazines
in that way is doubly apparent.
If it be true that the Maine was
struck -b>' a treacherous torpedo, and
that that torpedo exploded under the
floor of her forward magazines, there
is no need to look further for the cause
of her destruction. That 58,000 pounds
of powder, going off at one blast, would
leave little of either ship or crew to
tell the tale. -
The rules governing- the care and cus
tody of a ship's ammunition have
changed but little since the old days
of black powder chat a spark might
ignite. The magazines are now a?
then, the holy of holies, into which no
careless or profane foot dare step. In
the old days stores of powder and shell
were not nearly so large as in the mod
ern ships and magazines were smaller.
A magazine which would hold thirty
tons of powder was never heard of on
board the old line of battle-ship.
But In the case of their smaller stores
the old Benbows were ever vigilant,
and some of their precautions against
danger would seem absurd in these
days. For instance, nobody was ever
permitted to enter the ship's magazines
except the captain, his executive offi
cer, the officer of the deck for the time
being and the gunner and his mates.
A marine sentry was posted on each
magazine night and day. "Whenever
it was necessary to open the magazines
either for inspection or to perform
work in them, such as shifting powder,
filling cartridges or shells and making
"primers," it was an occasion of cere
mony.
First, a red pennant was run up at
the mizzen-yard-arm as a warning to
all boats to keep away. Every spark
of fire in the ship was put out, every
"glim" was "doused,'' every pipe ex
tinguished; even the cook's galley and
officers' ranges had to have their fires
extinguished. When certain that these
preliminaries were attended to the ex
ecutive officer called upon the captain
for the keys. The marine officer posted
a corporal's guard at the cockpit hatch
way to keep everybody away. Then,
with the gunner and his mates at his
heels, the executive officer would open
the magazine to be entered. Before
anybody could go in, however, he had
to remove his shoes and put on felt
slippers; he had also to take from his
pockets every metal article he might
have in them. The magazines were
lighted by heavy bullseye lanterns on
the outside of the magazine bulkheads,
the bullseyes shining through round
holes in the bulkheads. To this day
magazines are lighted in the same way,
the only change being the substitution
of electricity for whale oil.
Most of these old-time precautions
are still in force, though modern pow
der being no longer susceptible to
sparks the rule of extinguishing all
fires and lights when a magazine is to
be opened is somewhat relaxed.
The destruction of the Maine will
lead to another elimination of danger
in our big battle-ships. It will put a
stop to the carrying of gun cotton on
shipboard. When the news of the
Maine disaster first reached the naval
officers who are familiar with the
treacherous nature of this explosion, it
was feared at once that gun cotton
was the guilty agent. When it became
known that there were two explosions,
a lesser and a greater, conviction was
certain that an explosion of inflam
mable gun cotton, spontaneously set
off, had, by the force of concussion,
set off the whole 58,000 pounds of
brown powder in the forward maga
zine. This was by no means an im
probable thing, and the conviction was
strengthened when a longitudinal
section of the ship being published
showed that the smaller gun-cotton
magazine abutted upon the top of the
quarter magazine, with only a five
eighths steel bulkhead between them.
Rear-Admiral Belknap was so im
pressed with the gun-cotton theory
that he inveighed in the strongest
terms against that element in a ship's
equipment, and declared he would
never take a ship to sea with an
ounce of gun cotton on Board of her.
Gun cotton is said to be safe when
constantly kept wet, but when dry it
is apt to explode if you look at it
crosswise. As its only use on board
ship is to fill torpedoes, and as most
I of the big ships are being stripped of
their torpedo equipments, the days of
gun cotton on shipboard are probably
numbered. As for the Maine, the gun
cotton theory of the first explosion is
now declared untenable, because thÂ»
gun cotton is said to have been stored i
in the after part of the ship, and there
fore uninjured.
Reports from Havana are so con
flicting and confusing that it becomes
each day all the more important that
certain easily ascertainable facts
should be made known. The officers of
the ship certainly know where the gun
cotton was stored and how much of it
was on board. The heated coal bunk
er theory could also be promptly dis
posed of if Captain Sigsbee would in
five words say whether his coal supply
was anthracite or bituminous. As a
matter of fact it was anthracite, and
who ever heard of spontaneous com
bustion in an anthracite coal bunker?
The Spanish theory of a hand grenade
never amounted to much, but it could
be quickly disposed of if Captain Sigs
bee would tell whether he had such ex
plosives on board the Maine. As a
matter of fact it is very doubtful, for
hand grenades long since ceased to
figure in a modern ship's equipment.
The captain himself admits that while
lying in Havana harbor he took the
precaution to have some fixed ammu
nition brought on deck, ready for use
by the light guns of the secondary bat
tery in case of quick emergency. Two
of these light rapid-fire guns were in
the fore military top, and it is possible
that a charge of ammunition might
have faller out of the top down to the
deck through an open hatchway, ex
ploding somewhore near the magazine,
but then it is hardly conceivable that
fo light an explosion would have set
off the greater mass. The latest re
ports from Havana are to the effect
that the magazines of the Maine were
not blow up at all, though h<uv that
fact can be known just now is not re
vealed.

APPROPRIATIONS FOR CALIFORNIA.
Â£3 S reported to the House on Monday the sundry
/ \ civil appropriation bill, while not wholly sat
â¢ isfactory, has many features that will be grati
fying to the people of California. It does not appro
priate for the State all that we asked, or all that we
have a right to expect, but it provides for many im
portant public improvements, and some of these are
among the works the people of the State have most
desired.
The most notable feature of the bill so far as it
affects California is the appropriation of $400,000 lor
work at San Pedro harbor during the next fiscal
year. This is especially gratifying because the fight
against that improvement has been so strongly and
so successfully waged in the past that doubts existed
in many quarters whether some new plan had not
been devised by the opponents of San Pedro to still
further delay it.
The large appropriation recommended for the work
seems to put an end to the long contest over the is
sue. It is one of the most signal triumphs the people
have won over the opposition of the Southern Pacific
Company and will have in the southern part of the
State something of the effect produced in the San
Joaquin by the construction of the Valley Road. It
is a step toward emancipation from the monopoly,
and is significant of the increasing power of the peo
ple and the diminishing prestige of a corporation
which a few years ago was considered all powerful
throughout the commonwealth.
Among the other items of the bill are appropria
tions for Oakland harbor. $133,000; for buildings in
San Francisco, $500,000; for the establishment of tele
phone connections between lightship and lighthouse
at Point Arena, $860; for fish culture stations at
Baird and Fort Gaston, Cal., $4620; for enforcement
of the Chinese exclusion act, $100,000; for surveys and
resurveys of the Pacific Coast, $54,400; for surveying
and temporarily marking a portion of the eastern
boundary of the State of California, $10,000; for con
tinuing work on the wall at the Presidio, San Fran
cisco, $5000; for defraying expenses of the California
Debris Commission, $15,000; expenses of Soldiers'
Home at Santa Monica, $25,000.
There is missing from this list the much desired ap
propriation for the improvement of the Sacramento
end San Joaquin rivers. That work is in many re
spects the most important we can expect of the Fed
eral Government in this State, and as the completion
of it will require years of time it is to be hoped the
beginning will not be long delayed. It may be pos
sible to .get an amendment making the appropriation
while the bill is under consideration in the House,
but, failing that, the contest for the measure should
be organized with greater force than ever. We have
won the fight for San Pedro by sticking to it, and we
can win that for the rivers by the same tactics.
Having collected from the people of San Francisco
$7000 ostensibly for the families of the firemen 'who
perished at the post of duty during a recent fire in
this city, the Examiner holds on to the funds and
stands a lawsuit rather than give them up. This is
working charity according to the law of the profits of
a slot machine.
The action of the Supervisors in this city on the
question of water rates for the ensuing fiscal year
was not in itself particularly gratifying, but when con
sidered in connection with the situation of the water
problem in Oakland and Los Angeles it is almost
worthy of commemoration by a brass tablet in the
City Hall.
At the time it made a donation of cheap sheepskins
to the sailors of the Bear the yellow journal explained
that a portion of the cost was defrayed with money
taken from the so-called charity baseball fund, and
now it looks as if the remainder had been sneaked -out
of the firemen's fund.
Jefferson County, Washington, complains of a lack
of school manns, but there is reason to suspect that
what the fellows up there are aiming at is not to get
young women to teach children already in the county,
but pretty girls to marry and set to raising more chil
dren.
Zola may not succeed in proving that Dreyfus was
not justly convicted", but he has already shown very
clearly that the French Government cannot assure
anybody a fair trial when the Parisian mob is aroused
and demands a victim.
If any proof were needed of the truth of the state
ment of Councilman Rowe of Oakland that the water
resolution adopted on Monday night was "an insult
to the council," it would be found in the alacrity with
which the majority took it.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 1898.
SENATOR WHITE'S RETIREMENT.
1--HE announcement that Senator Stephen M.
White has determined to retire from public life
and devote himself to the practice of his pro
fession will be received by the people of the State
generally, irrespective of party politics, with regret.
Mr. White is one of the ablest Derryocrats California
ha 9 ever produced. When not acting as a partisan
his services to the commonwealth in the Federal Sen
ate have been exceedingly valuable. The people can
not fail to feel the loss of a man in Congress whose
ability and experience were destined to cause him to
play an important part inthe history of the nation.
Now that Senator White is about to retire from
active politics it is appropriate that a Republican
newspaper like The Call should pay him a compli
ment, especially when it can truthfully say that he
reached the high office of United States Senator with
out corruption or compromise. He has sat in the
upper house o[ Congress for six years as an inde
pendent man â a most extraordinary position for a
lawyer without fortune to occupy among the mil
lionaires and corporation attorneys who ornament
that chamber.
From a political viewpoint Republicans may rejoice
that Senator White has retired; the disappearance
of such a man from the Senatorial field ought to
make the election of a Republican Senator easy.
But we doubt whether in all except partisan matters
it will be possible to improve on him. He was, in
fact, though to our mind wrong in politics, an ideal
Senator for the State.
Mr. White's retirement is attributed to the inade
quate compensation paid a Federal Senator. He
says he cannot continue in office without abandoning
his law practice, and he cannot live comfortably and
ieave anything behind for his family upon $5000 a
year and mileage. The moral of this should not be
lost upon the public. Here is an independent, able,
conscientious and self-respecting man who is prac
tically driven out of the public service because it does
not afford him a living. Were Senator White to en
gage in business schemes and represent corporations
in Congress doubtless he could speedily get rich; but
he will not do that. Hence he is driven to withdraw
from the Senate in order that he may procure a fair
return for his services.
It ought to be perfectly plain to the most superfi
cial observer that the compensation of which Sen
ator White complains can ultimately produce but
two results, viz., filling the Senate with millionaires
and ignoramuses. Doubtless there will always be
plenty of men glad to accept senatorships ht $5000
a year, but such men will ordinarily make worthless
Senators. Millionaires usually possess some ability.
But suppose the crop of millionaires runs out? What
will become of the Federal Senate?
THE FREE-SILVER MANIFESTOES.
WE have reviewed the statements made by the
leaders of the three free silver parties. We
have fairly sought out and individualized the
classes, and the interests attacked and devoted to
destruction by these perfervid documents. Their
authors and supporters must now show how the
people and the country are to be benefited by de
stroying the interests they attack.
If the 159,000 depositors in the savings banks of
this State are killed as "traitors" or exiled as
"Tories," and their property is taken from them, who
will be helped by it? Will it bring another day's work
to any laboring man, or add a penny to his wages?
If the insurance companies are destroyed and
made incapable of drawing interest or paying losses,
will it bring prosperity to anybody, will it add to the
food, comfort, shelter or wages of the laborers, or to
the happiness of anybody? In one of his campaign
speeches Mr. Bryan said he could prove that the fire
and life insurance companies take in more money
in premiums and interest than they pay out for losses.
But who would insure in them if they did not?
Suppose his theory put in practice and their power to
pay losses destroyed, what could cause more suffer
ing and distress? Countless thousands of affection
ate and prudent men have insured their lives for the
benefit of the women and children of their families.
Every hour of the day some man dies who leaves life
insurance for the protection of his family. The mind
cannot conceive the loss and suffering if the insur
ance companies were destroyed in the anarchist as
sault proposed by the three parties which are making
this hysterical appeal.
Suppose, again, that the whole fabric of commer
cial credit is crumbled in a common wreck by the
success of this attack on the commercial banks, who
would be helped by it? Can any laboring man
demonstrate that he would be better off?
In the place of all these interests, institutions and
practices of business, which are to be destroyed as
enemies of the popular welfare, these politicians pro
pose to put the free coinage of silver at 16 to i. In
what way can it substitute them? How can it restore'
their own to the 159,000 savings bank depositors in
California? How can it replace their small invest
ments to the stockholders in building and loan as
sociations? In what way will it restore the credits
required by ship builders and the promoters of the
large wage paying enterprises of the country? Can
they point to any free silver country in the world
where enterprises nre more active and profitable,
work more plenty and wages better, or as good, as
here? Is it not plain that if there were such a coun
try emigration would be flowing from here there?
As a matter of fact we go to great expense to shut
out and turn back from our shores immigrants from
the greatest of the free silver nations to protect our
own wage earners from the lower standard of life
which enables these immigrants to exist upon less
and therefore for lower wages.
These politicians are seeking power by threaten
ing to use in a way that will bring distress upon
the very classes over whose condition they pretend
to agonize. Their proposition is so full of danger
that the thoughtful patriotism of the country will
combine against and defeat it.
The attention of Bateman Brothers is respectfully
called to the fact that the energetic citizens of Bernal
Heights, feeling the need of a public hall, built it
in one day. Bateman Brothers are said to have a
contract for erecting the Hall of Justice. It would
be cheering if they were to absorb the Bernal Heights
spirit. At the rate they are progressing the estimate
of the non-professional observer would be that to
carry out the terms of such a contract the Batemans
w^ould have to keep on at their present gait: for at
least a thousand years.
The contrast between the orderly transaction of
business by Congress during this administration and
the disorderly racket that prevailed in Cleveland's
time is worth noting as an evidence that when we
have a statesman at the White House we have state
craft at the Capitol, and when we have a freak at the
head of affairs we must expect a menagerie of
cuckoos and wild colts.
THE WATER SCANDAL IN OAKLAND.
THE manner in which the water rateo for the
coming year have been fixed in Oakland and the
circumstances under which the job was done
constitute one of the most serious municipal scan
dals of the day. The very swiftness with which the
work was accomplished is an evidence that it was the
outcome of a scheme that could not bear the light of
examination and discussion.
A resolution fixing water rates was submitted to the
City Council some time ago and passed to print.
That measure had been duly considered and in the
main was fairly satisfactory as it provided about the
same rates as now prevail. Suddenly on Monday
night the new ordinance was introduced which ma
terially raises rates on all classes of consumers of
water, and without debate, without a pretense of
time for consideration, the new measure was adopted
by a vote of six to five.
A peculiar feature of the proceeding is the part
played in it by the newly appointed member of the
Council, Mr. Woodward. This gentleman was sup
posed to be on the side of the people, but his prompt
action in voting for a raise in the rates has naturally
raised a suspicion that he was fixed by the companies
beforehand, and that the retirement of Councilman
Fibush to make way for him was part of a pre
arranged plan.
Such, at any rate, is the impression produced on the
minds of some of the Councilmen themselves, for as
soon as the vote was announced Councilman Girard
is reported to have said: "Now our eyes are opened.
When he was appointed last week the new member
stated in the public print that he was for the people
and had no strings on him. We now see what people
he meant. We can now see why Mr. Woodward was
appointed."
The new ordinance was carried through so rapidly
the members had no time to consider the full extent
of the proposed raise. As soon as it was introduced
it was referred to a committee and was then reported
back within five minutes. As the resolution com
prised about twenty pages of type-written matter the
committee could hardly have had time to read it
much less digest it before reporting it. The newly
appointed Woodward, together with W. W. Watkin
son, constituted a majority of the swift working com
mittee and reported in favor of the resolution, while
the remaining member, Mr. Upton, was allowed no
time to make an adverse report further than what was
required to write "I emphatically dissent."
It is estimated that the new rates will allow the
water companies a revenue equal to 12 per cent on
their investments. The increased tax falls on the
water supply everywhere, from hydrants used by the
c:ty to the tubs of private houses. It is an act of
spoliation as sweeping as it was sudden. It is not to
be wondered that the consummation of such a job
should have roused the indignation of good citizens
and that Councilman Rowe should have protested
against it as an "insult to the Council."
It is gratifying to learn that the City Attorney con
siders the vote taken under such circumstances to be
illegal. The people of Oakland should certainly
make a determined and persistent resistance to such
an outrage as this. It is about as insolent a job as
has ever been worked out in the face of the public in
the history of California. Oakland ought to find some
means of defeating it. and also some means of punish
ing the jobbers that designed it.
TRAVELING LIBRARIES.
AN article in the current number of the Ameri
can Monthly Review of Reviews gives an in
teresting account of the work and present ex
tent of the traveling library system in the Eastern
States where it has been adopted. The facts cited
show that the system has supplied an urgent need
of American life, and its operation is expanding with
remarkable rapidity.
At the present time the system is in oper
ation on an extensive scale in New York.
lowa, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin. It has
also been adopted by some of the. larger rail
ways of the East for the benefit of their employes,
and it is said the circulating library of employes of
the Baltimore and Ohio is perhaps the most impor
tant institution of the kind in the world.
The eager demand on the part of the rural popu
lation of the country for such advantages as are af
forded by the system is proven by statistics showing
the rate of expansion. The first appropriation for
traveling libraries was made in New York in 1892,
and in that year forty-six such libraries were sent out!
In the second year 139 libraries were necessary to
meet.the demand, and last year no less than 447 were
circulated. To supply these libraries the State has
36,000 volumes, which are circulated in sets of from
50 to 100 volumes each.
In other States the system is not so extensive as
in New York, but in all of them it is growing. Mich
igan is now circulating 100 libraries of fifty volumes
each. lowa circulates fifty libraries and there are ap
plications on file for 200. In Wisconsin the move
ment was started by the munificence of a private citi
zen, and to this day the State has made no appropria
tion for it, but nevertheless upwards of 100 libraries
with a varying number of books are being circulated,
and there is a demand for more.
It is significant of the importance of the work that
a demand for libraries has been found in localities
where the people were supposed to be wholly indiffer
ent to literature or incompetent to profit by it. An
instance is cited of a hamlet in Wisconsin made up
of a railway station, a store, a blacksmith shop, a
saloon and a dozen houses. The people were of the
kind called "tough" and the young men generally
found their amusement in getting drunk. The store
keeper agreed to keep a library and circulate it, and
the result soon showed that the people of the com
munity appreciated the advantages offered. The
number of books called for at the place soon ex
ceeded that required for several other communities of
equal size that were considered much more cultured.
The topic is one of timely interest to California.
Our State is so sparsely settled that thousands of cul
tured people live remote from cities and have few or
no advantages in the way of books. At the same time
the State has at Sacramento one of the largest and
best State libraries in the Union. This library is
maintained at the expense of all the people of the
commonwealth, and yet it is of benefit under present
conditions only to the residents of Sacramento or to
those who visit that city.
Why not put a large number of the books belong
ing to the people into circulation so that all may have
some benefit of them? Why not be one of the first
States of the Union to adopt the traveling liblary
system instead of waiting to be one of the last?
Officers of the War Department who explain that
the recent orders which have caused activity at every
army post "have no significance" not only waste
breath and time, but produce in the minds of hearers
an inclination to cry "rats!" which, being vulgar, is
something the department has no right to encourage.
THE MUSTANG AND THE SHIP
THERE are some things of the sea
apparently not mastered at the United
States Naval Academy and one is
how to dock a ship without plunging
somewhat into the appropriation for re
pairs. Charitable people have explained
that a naval vessel being designed and
built for destroying purposes is true to
her calling and election by trying to rip
up everything she falls in with, and no
commander, unless he runs her into a
strawstrack, can prevent confusion and
disaster.
This theory will hardly bear the wear
and tear of time and practice. The United
States steamer Marion during her last
cruise acted unusually contrary. She tried
to kick the gates out of every drydock she
entered and rubbed the planking off every
coal wharf she was moored at. Yet after
she was turned over to the Naval Re
serve she came meekly down from Mare
Island and let Captain Louis H. Turner
dock her at a Folsom-street pier without
losing a fleck of paint from her flanks or
chafing a splinter from the dock. She
then snuggled up to the structure as
though it were home to her.
There is one naval vessel that was re
cently docked without disasterâ the Phila
delphia, and the navy officers at Mare
Island wondered. Her commander was Ne

AN HOUR
WITH THE
COLONELS.
OOOOOOOOOC owing to the pres
ence of the Governor's staff, which had
assembled there pursuant to an order of
Adjutant-General Barrett, as they, to
gether with Governor Budd and Mayor
Phelan, had accepted an invitation to
visit the Mining Fair. The order read 1
o'clock, but the six carriages did not
move until 2, and the lieutenants, colonels
and majors whiled away the dreary hour
of waiting by indulging in good-natured
railery and innocent badinage at the ex
pense of each other.
Lieutenant Choynski, in commenting on
the variety displayed in the military uni
forms of his associates, said: "Some are
wearing campaign hats because they look
better in them, while others wear fatigue
caps for the same reason, and I am one
of the others. Each man is uniformed
according to his own sweet whim, caprice,
age or physical condition. Look at Colonel
Sanborn, who has no cord on his hat and
is wearing tan shoes and gloves, while
Major Klrkpatrick thinks he is going to
a social function in the Maple room,
judging from his cotillon overcoat with
silk lapels and his white kid gloves."
Colonel Pippy was accused of wearing
Colonel Kowalsky's military overcoat,
which had wofully shrunk from fre
quent campaignings, but Pippy denied the
soft impeachment.
Colonel Andrews was resplendent In his
gorgeous military costume, but he be
wailed the fact that it hid from view a
diamond stud of huge dimensions which
he wore on his immaculate shirt front,
and he finally concealed his handsome
proportions in an Inverness coat of the
latest cut.
Just as the party were about to start
an Italian image vendor came up and
offered for sale two plaster-of-paris
busts, one of Christopher Columbus and
the other of George Washington. In a
spirit of fun Colonel Chadbourne, who
had become impatient at the long delay,
picked up the bust of Columbus and
dashed it to pieces on the ground. The
Italian gazed ruefully at the broken frag
ments, and then with a quick movement,
as if impelled by a sudden idea, threw
the other bust down to join its shattered
companion, saying: "Georga Washa, he
go broka, too." It was whispered that
the colonel also went broke settling the
damage, but the truth of the rumor
could not be confirmed.

CALAMITY UNBEARABLE.
Had the Spanish cruisers and torpedo
boats attacked the Maine and sent her to
the bottom with the loss of 250 lives the
calamity would have been hard to bear,
but to have the Maine destroyed as she
was destroyed on Tuesday night is calam
ity unbearable. Jt Is useless to cry pa
tience when there is no patience*. It is
useless to ask for suspension of judgment !
when judgment has been given. That
judgment is against Spain, and if it is re- |
versed it will be on the testimony of wit- I
nesses who have standing in the court of j
public opinion.â Chicago Inter Ocean.
ENOUGH AND TO SPARE.
The world, has already supped full of
horrors from the Cuban conflict. It is
time for it to end. Its first American vic
tim was the brave Ensign Breckinridge.
The next are the 253 victims of the Maine
explosion. Shall there be others? Must
the infernal carnage go on until Cuba is
depopulated and until other blameless
Americans are sacrificed through acci
dent, treachery or incompetency? Is it
not time for the United States Govern
ment to say that the war must stop â that
this nineteenth century materialzation of
Dante's Inferno must come to an endâ
and to enforce the mandate? If our men
must perish, is it not better that they
shall perish in fair and open fight, than
go down as helpless victims of mystery,
treachery or inaction?â Minneapolis Tri
bune.
THE MAINE DISASTER.
Editor Call: The Key West corre
spondent of the Journal-Examiner says
that even if the destruction of the Maine
were an accident, we know that Spain
was planning such a crime and therefore
the act must be treated as a Cause of
war.
There is a great deal of such foolish
and misleading talk. There are certain
rules in force between nations, " the
growth of treaties and conventions and
other forms of agreement, and ..educed
from the principles of natural justice, and
no country has ever gained honorable
or permanent advantage by their viola
tion. The Cuban rebellion has put upon
this country a peculiar strain. Our na
tional honor requires that we enforce our
obligations as a neutral. If a subject of
Spain, on his own responsibility, blew up
the Maine, we must be cautious in the
enforcement of national responsibility
upon Spain. It is notorious that ever
since the rebellion began citizens of this
country have constantly violated our
neutral obligations. It has proved use
less to bring them before American
juries, for their acquittal has followed.
Violation of the neutrality laws has not
impressed our people as a wrong in
morals or policy. Public meetings have
been held, participated in by local offi
cials, as mayors of cities and even mem
bers of Congress, and public subscriptions
have been started to buy arms and muni
tions of war for the Cuban insurgents.
In all these acts encouraging violations
of neutrality our people are unable to see
any wrong. Granting that a Spaniard has
proved as incapable of the conception of
wrong In destroying the Maine, the two
governments have a common interest in
avoiding responsibility for the acts of in
dividuals.
If it were capable of proof that the
Spanish Government knew in advance of
such Intention of her subject, and, hav
ing the power, failed to prevent it, the
aspect of the case would be wholly
changed.
The British Government was notified of
the building within her jurisdiction and
by her subjects of the Alabama as a
cruiser for the Confederate Government,
.having the power, sue failed to prevent
that violation of the neutrality laws, and
when we asked the nations to sit in judg
ment between us in the i Geneva Court,
that great jury found her guilty ol re
sponsibility, and she paid to us the
heaviest fine ever paid by one country to
another, except as an indemnity for war
between the parties.
Having established this principle, we
should not lose sight cf it in the excite
ment of the moment. If a subject of
Spain destroyed the Maine, without the
prior knowledge of that Government, and
we force indemnity for that act of an in
dividual, the columns of American news
papers and the proceedings of public
meetings in this country would go far to
prove to an international court of arbi
tration our responsibility for the cost to
Spain of her attempts to suppress the in
surrection which has been made neces
sary by the aid extended by our citizens.
Of course Spain Is weak and miserable
and mad, but she has the rights of a na
tion, and in view of our Alabama prece
dent, we could not honorably decline her

There were three events on the card

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 1898.
A CENTURY OF
ROUND TRIPS
Steamer City of Peking
Has Established a
Record.
During a Life of Twenty-four
Years She Has Only Met
With One Accident.
Two Steamers With Five Hundred
Passengers Aboard Sailed
for the Klondike.
The Pacific Mail Steamship Com
pany's steamer City of Peking was
gayly decorated with bunting yester
day in honor of Washington's birthday
and also to let the world know that she
had just completed her one hundredth
round trip. All her flags were set, and
from the jiggermast a burgee with the
figures "100" on it was flown.
The Peking was launched at Chester,
Pa., in 1874, and came to San Francisco
via the Straits of Magellan early in
1875. When she arrived here she was
leaking and had to be docked for re
pairs. She was then the largest steam
er afloat, with the exception of the
Great Eastern, and her docking was a
holiday event in San Francisco. It was
found necessary to strengthen her by
the addition of two steel decks, and the
wise men in nautical circles shook their
heads and predicted a Bhort life for the
big liner. She is to-day, however, in
spite of her age, one of the strongest
ships afloat, and her hull and machin
ery are in as perfect order as the day
she was launched.
During her twenty-four years of life
the Peking's engines have made 309,
759,505 revolutions, she has traveled
1,321,099 miles and the coal consumed
in making that record has been 280,652
tons. She has carried during that time
111,150 steerage passengers and 7100
cabin passengers, and is still in such
shape as to be able to start in and
cary them all over again. Other orig
inal crew only two are now aboardâ
Caesar Christian, the steerage steward,
who came out on her from New York
as quartermaster, and Ah Jee, the Chi
nese porter, who joined her here.
During her career the Peking has
been commanded by Captains Griffin

twenty-three typhoons and came out of
them scatheless.
Two steamers sailed for Alaskan
ports last night. The Excelsior took
away all the passengers she could
cary for Copper River, Dyea and Ska
guay. and the Humboldt had a few less
than the law allows. She is licensed to
carry 325 first and second-class pas
sengers and her purser said she had
312 aboard. However. Max Kallsh, the
general agent of the vessel was taking
no chances and he had all strangers
put ashore and every passenger on the
vessel counted.
The sailing of the Oceanic Steamship
Company's Mariposa has been post
poned from to-day until Friday next at
2 P. ML The English mails by the
S. S. Campania were late in arriving at
New York and will not reach here until
Friday, at 10 A. M. Among the Mari
posa's passengers will be President S.
B. Dole of Hawaii and W. G. Irwln, the
well known banker of Honolulu.
The steamer China, which left here
for the Orient on the 6th inst., had a
very rough time. Twice she had to be
hove to and a lifebfrat was stove in, the
bridge ladder carried away and also
the quarter boat. The captain Is re
ported to have stated that It was the
roughest and most disagreeable pass
age he had ever made.
Mr. Wilson of llf> O'Farrell street
will not forget Washington's birthday
In a hurry. He got into a row In a
saloon and is now laid up in the Har
bor Receiving Hospital with a broken
jawbone. Some one, he knows not
who, knocked him senseless and
broke his Jaw in two places. â¢ He will
be disfigured for life unless he gets a
dental surgeon to make a plate for his
mo-uth to hold the bones in place until
they knit. His friends who brought
him to the hospital disappeared as
soon as they turned him over to Dr.
Hartley.

Wi Long Can You II you do not know

probably because
your nerves are not
quite as steady as they should be, and
you can sympathize with one whose are
worse. Yet here is a man who has not
been able to hold anything steadily in his
hands for years. It is due to nervous ex-
haustion, he explains, and he is in such a
very shaky condition that he fears to get
on an electric car. He has attributed his
trouble to weakness, â¢ but according to
eminent authority, ; the weakness is only a
symptom of the disease. After a careful
examination of the patient, the most
skilled physician in this class of diseases
in the State said "Debility due to some
sort of excess." The man, however, is
destined to get well and , have as good
nerves as he ever had, the specialist ex-
plains. He is at this moment suffering
from lack of appetite, pain in the loins
and the small of the back, but they are
all disappearing. He took a whole heap
of patent medicines for his nerves instead
of getting at. the root of the trouble. He
is rapidly improving under the "Hudyan 1
remedio-treatment, and will be a perfect
man again very

The "Hudyan" treatment is only ad-
ministered at the Hudson Medical Insti-
tute at the junction of Stockton, Market
and Ellis streets, and cannot be bought
elsewhere. It is a specific In all debilita-
tion, and does wonderful work very
rapidly. Circulars and testimonials show-
ing what it has done are absolutely free
to all seekers after health. Blood taint
In every form is completely cleaned out

TRIBUTES TO OUR
FIRST PRESIDENT
McKINLEY`S
TRIBUTE TO
A PATRIOT
George Washington.
Eulogized by the
Executive.
He Points to the Lessons
Taught by the Great
Statesman.
Far - Sighted Wisdom of His
Farewell Address to the
Nation.
ADVICE TO BE HEEDED.
Reference Made by the Speaker to
the First President's Foreign
Policy.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 22.âPresi
dent McKinley was driven to the Acad
emy of Music this morning, where the
"Washington birthday commemorative
exercises of the University of Pennsyl
vania were held. Over 2000 students
assembled on the university campus at
9:30 and marched, four abreast, to the
Academy of Music. There the students
took the seats reserved for them.
President McKinley addressed an in
telligent and appreciative audience at
the academy. By his side on the stage
â¢were assembled the faculty of the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania and many pro
fessors and executive officials of other
educational institutions. The appear
ance of the President on the stage was
the signal for thunderous applause, and
as it died away the students broke out
with their thrice repeated college cry
of "Pennsylvania," and the Municipal
band followed with "Hail to the Chief"
and the "Star-Spangled Banner."
Charles C. Harrison, provost of the
University of Pennsylvania, introduced
President McKinley, who, as he
stepped forward, was greeted with
spontaneous handclapping from all
over the house, and the students again
gave their college cry. It was some
minutes before quiet was restored. In
his eulogy of the character and genius
of Washington the President said in
part:
It was committed to Washington to
launch our ship of state. He had neither
precedent nor predecessor to help him;
he welded the scattered and at times an
tagonistic colonies into an indestructible
"Union and inculcated the lessons of mu
tual forbearance and fraternity which
have cemented the States into still closer
bonds of interest and -sympathy.
From the hour when Washington de
clared in his Virginia home that ho
would raise a thousand men and equip
them at his own expense to march to
the defense of Boston, he became the
masterful spirit of the Continental army
and the mightiest single factor in the
continent's struggle for liberty and in
dependence. Apparently without personal
ambition, spurning royal honors when
they were suggested to him, he fulfilled
a still more glorious destiny as the guid
ing force of a civilization freer and
mightier than the history of man had
known.
Though Washington's exalted character
and the most striking acts of his brilliant
record are too familiar to be recounted
here, where so many times they have re
ceived eloquent and deserved eulogy, yet,
often as the story is retold, it engages
our love and admiration and Interest. We
love to recall his noble unselfishness, hia
heroic purposes, the power of his mag
nificent personality, his glorious achieve
ments for mankind and his stalwart and
unflinching devotion to independence,
liberty and union. Those cannot be too
often told or be too familiarly known.
Much practical benefit is to be derived
from the present application of portions
"f Washington's farewell address, a doc
ument in which he laid down principles
â which appeared to him "all important to
the permanence of your felicity as a peo
ple." In that address Washington con
tended in partâ First, for the promotion
of institutions of learning; second, for
cherishing the public credit; third, for the
observance of good faith and justice to
ward all nations.
At no point in his administration does
Washington appear in grander propor
tions than when he enunciated his ideas
in regard to the foreign policy of the
uuverjiweui;
"Observe good faith and justice toward
all nations; cultivate peace and harmony
with all. Religion and morality enjoin
this conduct. Can it be that good policy
does not equally enjoin it? It will be
â worthy of a free, enlightened, and at no
distant period, a great nation, to give to
mankind the magnanimous and too novel
example of a people always guided by an
exalted justice and benevolence."
To-day, nearly a century from "Wash
ington's death, we turn reverentially to
study the leading principles of that com
prehensive chart for the guidance of the
people. It was his unflinching. immov
able devotion to these perceptions of du

HARRISON'S TRIBUTE.
Inimitable Qualities of Washing
ton's Life and Character.
CHICAGO. Feb. 22.â Ex-President
Benjamin Harrison spoke to-day at
the Auditorium at the annual celebra
tion of the Union League Club In
honor of "Washington. In his tribute
to the great patriot he said:
We assemble on this anniversary of the
birth of Washington, not so much, if at
all, to bring tribute to him, as to learn
at his feet the lessons of a conscientious
citizenship. The inimitable qualities, of
Washington's character and life; those
that did not exhaust themselves on a lo
cality or a period; that are instructive
not only to military commanders and
chief magistrates, but to the unofficial
citizen: the lessons that he taught, not
for the march and battle, but for quiet
days when no drum beat calls to dutyâ
these are the qualities and lessons that
should engage our thought to-day.

Football Game.
PALO ALTO, Feb. 22.â The baseball
game on the campus to-day between the
Varsity and the Alumni teams resulted in
a victory for the latter nine by the un
even score of 11 to 3. The Stanford team
played an extremely loose game, as ten
costly errors will show. Besides fielding
poorly the collegians were weak with the
stick and were pretty much at the mercy
of Krug, the pitcher of the California
Market nine, who played with the Alumni
although protested by Manager Keesling
for professionalism.
Follensbee of the Insurance League
team caught a star game for the Alumni
nine. His throwing to bases was par
ticularly good. Abe Lewis made the most
sensational play for the visiting team.
The Varsity team was weak in several

Hill, who pitched for the Stanford men,
was sufOrfng from a rheumatic arm and
was supplemented near the end of the
game by Lanagan, who allowed but one
hit to be made off him. The Alumni

fair hitting that they are still a long way
from being back numbers.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 22.â The vete
rans of the blue and the gray,
residents in Los Angeles County,
united to-day in commemorating
the birthday of the Father of
his Country. It was no extempor
aneous affair, but a well planned and
programmed celebration, lasting
through the entire day. In the morning
there was a parade, in which 3000
Union veterans participated. The Con
federate veterans were not invited to
participate in the parade for the rea
son that the national commander of
the Grand Army of the Republic has by
ukase forbidden such a thing. Despite
this fact there was quite a sentiment
among the Union veterans in favor of
extending to them an invitation, but in
order to prevent any trouble and a pos
sible reprimand from the national com
mander it was not done.
The parade formed at 10 o'clock and
the procession moved at once, cover
ing nearly all the principal streets of
the city. It was quite an inspiring
spectacle â 3000 veterans of a war that
closed thirty-three years ago. Many of
them were maimed and crippled, while
one totally disabled comrade was
wheeled in his chair by a half-dozen of
his fellow-cotnrades.
After the usual mounted police at the
head of the column came the rifle squad
of the local police force, comprising
twenty-six men under the command of
Captain M. A. Roberta. The men made
an excellent showing, as they were
well drilled and well uniformed. Then
came the Soldiers' Home band, an or
ganization made up of Union veterans
who are living at the National Home.
Chief Marshal C. F. Derby and his
aides, William Young, chief of staff,
and Henry Enispar, chief bugler, fol
lowed. The Union Veterans' Legion,
made up of 300 old soldiers from the
National Home, came under the com
mand of Moses Wiley. These men were
excellently drilled.
Individual veterans from the home
followed, representing the Uncle Sam,
the John A. Martin and the Rosecrans
posts of the Grand Army and the
Naval Veterans' Association. Long
Beach Post of Long Beach, Godfrey
Post of Pasadena, Dan Bidwell Post of
Norwalk, Glendale Post of Glendale,
Fort Fisher Post of Santa Monica, Po
mona Post of Pomona, Shiloh Post of
Compton and Burnside Post of Azusa
followed in the order given. The
veteran drum corps under the com
mand of Captain Sam Kutz was fol
lowed by the three local posts of the
Grand Armyâ Stanton, Kenesaw and
Frank Bartlett.
The parade was witnessed by a dense
throng of people, who stood along the
sidewalk on the line of march. When
the drum corps struck up some of the
old-time martial tunes the old soldiers
could restrain themselves no longer.
They broke forth in the old army-song
chorus, and although their voices were
weak and husky they made the streets
ring with their enthusiasm.
After marching for about an hour the
column headed for Hazards' Pavilion.
There a bounteous luncheon had been
prepared for the Relief Corps. The food
had been generously contributed by the
citizens of Los Angeles, and every old
soldier and his family were invited to
eat to their hearts' content. The supply
was amply sufficient.
As soon as tables cauld be cleared
away the afternoon exercises began,
but for about an hour prior to this the
veterans held informal reunions in the
corridors and in front of the Pavilion.
Comrades who had not before in a
long time came together and talked of
old times and of the boys of the same
regiment they were in who had gone
before.
Superior Judge B. U. Smith called
those in the Pavilion to order for the
afternoon exerciseÃ. In doing so he
made a few very pleasant remarks ap
propriate to the occasion. The Veteran
Drum Corps rendered a stirring army
march, after which Rev. W. A. Knigh
ton invoked the divine blessing. The
comrades then made a number of short
speeches, which were full of patriotism
and manifestation of love of country
and flag. A number of amusing inci
dents of army and prison life were re
lated.
Among those who spoke were Captain
A. M. Simpson, Comrade A. C. Shafer,
Colonel R. B. Treat, Comrade H. C.
Goodlng and General H. A. Pierce.

Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. 22.
The speech of Representative Henry
U. Johnson of Indiana in the House to
day, opposing the annexation of the
Hawaiian Islands, is the talk of Wash
ington to-night. It was a brilliant ef
fort and created a sensation. He was
not only applauded by members of his
own party, but when he had concluded
the Democratic side (almost a unit in
their opposition to annexation) as well
as a goodly number of .Representatives
on Mr. Johnson's side of the House,
arose and cheered wildly. He aroused
the members to a high pitch of en
thusiasm. His speech is Justly re
garded as one of the most brilliant
that have ever been delivered in Con
gress. His delivery was as rapid as
usual, and he maintained his reputa
tion as the fastest speaker in Congress.
Thoughtful Republicans see that they
are forced to abandon the annexation
scheme. It is stated by conservative
members this evening that the treaty
will be abandoned by the Senate within
the next ten days, and they admit that
annexation by joint resolution, in view
of the pending Spanish troubles, is very
doubtful, if not hopeless. The speech
of Johnson in the House is taken as a
warning. The scheme need not look
for support by fair and patriotic men
in that body if attempted by joint legis
lation.
Johnson's clear and emphatic de
nunciation of annexation fell like a
bombshell upon the annexationists in
the House. He has been the recognized
supporter of the administration in all
its policies in the past. Always a clear
and convincing speaker, to-day John
son astonished all who heard him by
the force and emphasis of his argu
ment. The crowded galleries broke into
frequent applaus â¢ and members of
both sides arowtied about him to hear
his remarks and tncourage him to con
tinue.
The reason for leading Republicans
abandoning the administration on this
issue is well understood. They feel
there will be enough coast to defend
along the Atlan.ic, Pacific and Gulf
States in- the near future without un
dertaking a patrol of islands 2000 miles
out in the Pacific. To guard Hawaii in
case of hostilities would be to divert
from important duty battle-ships that
will be none too numerous and effect
ive for protecting our present posses
sions.
The Republicans acknowledge the
force of this argument, and in the face
of impending trouble with Spain shrink
from undertaking more work than will
be forced upon them under existing
conditions.
Republican Senators admit that the
treaty cannot command two-thirds of
the vote of that body, and are urging
Chairman Davis to bring the debate t >
an end by recommitting or abandoning
it. They know that a joint resolution
for annexation would bring endless de
bate in the open Senate.
In the House it would meet with the
opposition of Reed as well as many Re
publicans who realize the burden it
would be to take care of Hawaii under
the difficulties now menacing this coun-
try.
Morrill of Vermont, the oldest member
of the Senate, created great surprise
when he spoke against annexation, but
the speech of Johnson to-day has de
moralized the supporters of the scheme
in the House. Some regard it as evi
dence that the administration is willing
to see the scheme defeated, and all ad
mit there will be a large falling off in
the vote which they have counted on in
the House for securing annexation by
joint resolution.
"When Johnson finished he was con
gratulated with great earnestness by
Bailey and many members of the Dem
ocratic side, and the heartiness with
which he was applauded by members of
his own party showed very clearly that
his speech had carried conviction there
also.
Johnson, in opening, referred to the
contest now on in the Senate over Ha
waiian annexation, and said the friends
and supporters of the treaty, both in
side and outside of the Senate, were
turning heaven and earth to secure its
adoption, and that President McKinley
was laboring to change the convictions
of Senatorial opponents of the measure.
He discussed the recent visit of Presi
dent Dole and suggested that the Ha
waiian nation, unlike the United States,
had everything to gain and nothing to
lose. He urged concentration of popu
lar attention on the issue and the dis
abuse of the minds of the people of er
roneous impressions, and asserted that,
once put to the test, either in the Sen
ate or in the House, the American peo
ple would be quick to discover the dan
ger involved and so condemn it.
"It will be buried," he said, "beyond
the possibility even of an ultimate res
urrection." [Applause.]
"I am opposed to the annexation of
Hawaii," he continued, "because I be
lieve the people of Hawaii are opposed
to it. I am not to be confused by this
special plea that the real sentiment of
the people of the Sandwich Islands is
only to be obtained from the views of
those who assume to govern them.
That, sir, is the merest technicality.
There is no room here for the applica
tion of the narrow doctrine of estop
pal."
Whether the present Government of
Hawaii was a de facto or a de jure
Government, he declared, it misrepre
sented the people of Hawaii.
"When it was charged, in 1893, at the
time when the republic succeeded the
monarchy, that the revolution was aid
ed by the interposition of American cit
izens, I did not believe it was true,"
said Jphnson, "and I denied it very
vigorously at the time, but the per
sistency with which this treaty of an
nexation is being pressed gives color
to the accusation then made, and which
I then so earnestly denounced."
Johnson, continuing, gave some of
the reasons which impelled him to op
position to annexation. One was the
ignorance of the population of Hawaii.
How long had it been, he asked, since
we had passed a bill to keep out the
ignorance of the Old World that we now
proposed to annex territory in which
ignorance was the rule, not the excep
tion. We had passed the Chinese ex
clusion act; now it was proposed to
annex territory which contained a
large Chinese population. He did not
favor the holding of territory under the
shadow of the American flag. A.colon
ial policy might be adapted to the na
tions of antiquity, but it would not do
for a free country which derived its
powers from the consent of the gov
erned. It would be unwise and short
sighted, he said, if we should cut loose
from all the traditions of the past and
rashly embark on the unknown sea of
territorial aggrandizement. We had
confined our expansion to contiguous
territory in the acquisition of Florida,
Louisiana and Texas. In 1853, under
inllmore's Presidency, we had been
wise enough and sensible enough to re
ject these yen- islands. We had also
rejected the proffer of the mob of St.
ihomas and under the administration
or General Grant Congress had voted
down a proposition to purchase San
Domingo.
Only once had we departed from our
ruleâ in the purchase of Alaska from
Kussiaâ and only the ruture could de
termine whether that had been a wise
move.
Possession of extraneous territory
meant a constant source of irritation.
The history of the world proved this.
It was urged that the Sandwich Islands
were the key to the Pacific. Their strat
egic importance was emphasized as if
guns mounted there could command the
Nicaragua canal and the Pacific Coast,
thousands of miles away.
The annexation of Hawaii would es
tablish a bad precedent. The appetite
grew by what it fed upon. To-day the
cry was "Give us Hawaii," to-morrow
it would be "Give us Cuba," and the
next day "Give us Samoa." These ap
peals would all be justified by the plea
sant sophistries which appealed to our
vanity and cupidity, until at last we
would find ourselves irretrievably com
mitted to a policy unnecessary to the
material happiness of our people,
hurrying along a path which was
strewn with the wrecks of empires and
of nations. (Applause.)
He did not deny,- he said, that the ac
quisition of foreign territory had added
to the prosperity of nations. But his
tory showed it to have been ultimately
a source of weakness. Cupidity bred
opposition, it piled up taxes, it shed
human blood, it was the first step
toward dismemberment. Let the na
tions of the Old World pursue this pol
icy of aggrandizement to their hearts'
content; let them saddle their people
with debt, equip armies and navies and
shed oceans of blood. Let England
boast, if she pleased, that the sun never
sets upon her territory. But lot us re
member that it never goes down upon
the misery her policy has created. Her
people starve in India. Let wars and
rumors of wars bring anxiety to the
faces of her colonists, but let the flower
of her colonies, which broke away from
her domination 100 years ago, and
which, by pursuing the opposite policy,
has outstripped her. continue to stand
as an example to the civilized world.
While others seek war and its horrors
let us soothe our people with enduring
peace. "Peace hath her victories no
less renowned than war.
"We are in the Infancy of our re
sources, the morning of our material
development. We will be wise, he
said, to develop our matchless country.
The internal reforms which our coun
try demands present a field broad
enough to list our best efforts, the pur
ification of the ballot, the crushing of
the rings and trusts which plunder our
people without stint, the restriction of
immigration, the establishment of a
fixed and stable standard of value and
the reform of our banking laws afford
work for us to do. Let us not be
known and execrated as the boisterous
bullies of the Western hemisphere. Our
country Is all powerful, the world con
cedes cur strength.
"While I am proud of our navy."
continued Johnson, impressively, "I
sometimes think that the powerful
battle ships we have built have bred
feelings of intolerance and insolence. It
is not more true that a plethoric treas
ury breeds public plunder than that a
well equipped army and navy rashly
leads tcr friction and war. Let our
equipment insure peace rather than
provoke war. (Applause.) While it
may seem that these remarks are pre
mature, and that I have taken too firm
a grip on the forelock of time, it is my
purpose to sound the alarm, that the
House and the country may under
stand the character of the proposition
pending in the Senate. My information
is that the treaty will fail in the Sen
ate, but it will be supplanted by a joint
resolution providing for the annexa
tion of the islands. Ido not doubt its
passage by the Senate and that it will
come here. If the Senate fails to do its
duty, let us, fresh from the people, ex
ercise our high prerogative and send it
to its doom. (Applause.)
"I trust God it will not be made a
party measure. With exalted patriot
ism and deliberate counsels we will
reach a . conclusion worthy of this
House and the country and erect a
safeguard for the future. If we turn
from this temptation now and adhere
to the right, twenty-five years of peace
and prosperity will vindicate our pa
triotism and posterity will bless our
memories. Let us have the moral cour
age to say 'No' to a policy which will
lead, God alone knows where."
The demonstration which greeted the
conclusion of Mr. Johnson's speech was
one of the greatest and most spontane
ous witnessed in this Congress. Many
of the Republicans joined in, and the
galleries, which were crowded, gave
evidence of approval. Members throng
ed about the Indiana member when he
took his seat and warmly congratulated
him.

PARIS* Feb. 22.â The precincts and |
lobbies of the Palace of Justice were j
deserted to-day, the fourteenth of the
trial of M. M. Zola and Pellieux for the
allegations which the former brought
in the Aurore, published by the latter,
against the conduct of the Esterhazy
court-martial. The Assizes Court it
self was thronged. M. Laborie, counsel i
for M. Zola, resumed his argument for
the defense. He chronologically re
viewed the case from the arrest of Al
fred Dreyfus, pointing out that, as Ma
jor Paty dv Clam interdicted Dreyfus
from speaking, the announcement of
his arrest, published by the Libre Par
ole and Eclaire, must have been com
municated by the Ministry for Wor.
Continuing, M. Laborle charged the
Libre Parole and Eclair with lying in
regard to the guilt of Dreyfus, and re
ferred to Major Paty dv Clam's at
tempt to intimidate Dreyfus and to
Major Forzinetti's belief in the lat
ter's innocence. He also dealt with the
court-martial's decision to conduct the
trial in secret in spite of the protests
of tho press. He said this was the rea
son of the unceasing protests in behalf
of Dreyfus, "which troubled all high
minded persons," adding:
"The strength of those of our adver
saries who are acting in good faith
lies in their belief that the whole af
fair was conducted with justice and
legality; but the facts do not bear out
this belief." (Murmurs.)
Counsel for the defense then de
clared that eight months prior to the
arrest of Dreyfus the Minister of "War
possessed photographs of the paper
containing the expression, "That
scoundrel of a D ," and showing
that a French officer had relations
with two former military attaches.
This document, M. Laborie pointed
out, did not refer to Dreyfus; but, all
the same, the culpability of Dreyfus
was founded upon it, and it was the
document which the veiled lady hand
ed to Major Esterhazy, the latter sur
rendering it to the Minister of War
only on securing a receipt. Referring
to General Mercler, M. Laborie said:
"Maybe he is a brave soldier, but
he is not familiar with great affairs.
In the absence of proofs he substituted
his own arbitrary impression, and thus
had an innocent man condemned."
Counsel also asked why the docu
ment referring to "That scoundrel
D " had not been previously spoken
of, as the defense could have brought
into court foreigners who disputed its
genuineness. The statement caused a
commotion in court and the presiding
Judge interrupted counsel to say:
"We would not have heard them."
"If we did not summon them," con
tinued M. Laborie, "it was because we
wished to discuss between Frenchmen
alone an affair solely concerning
Frenchmen. However, opinions may
differ in this affairâ in the hour of
danger we all show a solid front to
the foreigner." (Applause.)
Then, denouncing the action of the
prosecution in having Dreyfus write
from dictation, counsel said:
"Such a trick proved the emptiness
of the prosecution, for had they pos
sessed proof of his guilt they would
not have had resource to such theatri
cal effects at the opening of the court
martial, and. the judges, having only
the bordereau, would have acquitted
Dreyfus, had not, contrary to all laws,
their judgment been led astray by the
secret communication of the docu
ment."
After reading an account of the
court-martial he added:
"I have all the papers concerning the
affair in my hands, and I solemnly af
firm that there is nothing in them
against Dreyfus. I pledge you my
honor, gentlemen, that there is no
proof against Dreyfus."
The statement made a commotion
and there were remarks of approba
tion among the public.
A short adjournment of the court fol
lowed, during which a number of per
sons shook hands with M. Laborie,
whose moderate but firm utterances
made a considerable Impression upon
the audience. When the hearing was
resumed, M. Laborie referred to the
alleged confession of Dreyfus to Cap
tain Lebrun-Renault, and remarked:
"If a written report of it exists it
was drawn up as an afterthought and
I could have proved it by a witness
had Captain Lebrun-Renault testi
fied." , ..
M. Laborie then gave a description
of the degradation of Dreyfus. H'j
recalled that amid shouts of "Death
from the pitiless crowd, Dreyfus had
not ceased to cry "Vive la France,
and swear, upon the heads of his
wife and children, that he was com
pletely innocent.
"Dreyfus," M. Laborie asserted,
"only appealed for one act of mercy
âthat the Ministry should continue the
inquiry." (Commotion.)
After the court adjourned M. Laborie
received a veritable ovation, cries of
"Vive Laborie," mingled with counter
cries of "Vive l'Armee" and "A bas les
Juifs." The public emerged from the
court in a state of excitement, but
there was no disorder. M. Laborie
will continue his address to-morrow.
SONOMA DAY AT THE
CLOVERDALE CITRUS FAIR.
Thousands of Guests From Sur-
rounding Towns Entertained
at the Big Pavilion.
CLOVERDALE, Feb. 22.âClover
dale's sixth annual citrus fairâ the
most successful ever held in Northern
California â came to an end this even
ing. Every train from north and south
brought its quota of visitors to-day,
but it remained for the excursionists
from Petaluma. Santa Kosa, Geyser
ville and Healdsburg to cause the side
walks to overflow and the streets to be
congested with foot traffic. Two sec
tions of a train, numbering twenty-two
cars, brought 3500 people eager for the
success of Sonoma County day.
The pavilion had been furnished and
burnished for the occasion. Flowers
and foliage that had become withered
were replaced and the occasional va
cancies caused by sly thefts of oranges
were filled with newly gathered fruit.
The programme of the day began at
1 o'clock with a concert by the Clover
dale Cornet Band. When the opening
air, "The Star-spangled Banner," was
struck up deafening applause sounded
from the four corners of the pavilion.
Then the stars and stripes were un
furled, while louder rolled the ap
plause. In addition to the selections by
the band glee clubs from the various
towns represented by the excursionists
lent their harmonies.
Union Hall was made the scene of the
last, act in the reign of King Citrus VI.
Here dancing was indulged in toward
the hours of morn.
DISCOVERS A WRECK
WITH BODIES ON BOARD.
BOSTON*, Feb. 22.â There is scarcely a
doubt that the British ship Asia, bound
from Manila for this port, was wrecked
near Nantucket during the gales of the
past few days, and that her entire crew
of twenty men has perished. This con
clusion is not only '^me out by wreck
age, consisting of the stern of a boat
with "Asia" painted on it, yards and
other materials, which were cast ashore
at Monomoy, but Captain Haley of this
city telephoned from Woodhull to-night
that while the tugboat E. V. McCauloy
was steaming out to the barge Kxcelsior,
which lies sunk on Handkerchief Shoal,
be saw positive" evidence of the wreck of
a large scjuare-rigged v*^;! And recov
ered two bodies from ar Portion of a dis
mantled hull.
Captain Haley said thafr while off the
Handkerchief lightship " 'tiiÂ« tug passed
through a large amoun?-m wreckage, in
cluding bales of hemp, broken spars and
broken ship timbers. Drifting in the
mi'lst of this mass was a portion of the
wreck, on which the bodies wen.- lashr.l.
It was discovered that the bQdiei were
those of a man and a little girl, appar
ently 10 or 12 years old. They were fast
in the mlzzen chains. The tug quickly
headed in the direction of the wreck and
the crew released the bodies, the tug re
turning immediately to Woodhull, whero
the news was sent to this city.
ADVERTISEMENTS.
INTENSE _SUFFERING~
From Dyspepsia and Stomach y
M Trouble.
INSTANTLY RELIEVED AND PERMANENTLY
CURED.
A New Discovery, But Not a Potent
Medicine.
Dr. Redwell relates an interesting ac-
count of what he considers a remark-
able cure of acute stomach trouble and
chronic dyspepsia by the use of the new
discovery, Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
He says: The patient was a man who
had suffered to my knowledge for years
with dyspepsia. Everything he ate
seemed to sour and create acid and
gases in the stomach; he had pains like
rheumatism in the back, shoulder
blades and limbs, fullness and distress
after eating, poor appetite and lobs cÂ«f
flesh; the heart became affected, caus-
ing palpitation and sleeplessness at
night.
I gave him powerful nerve tonics and
blood remedies, but to no purpose. As
an experiment I finally bought a fifty
cent package of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets at a drug store and gave them
to him. Almost immediate relief was
given, and after he had used four boxea
he was to all appearances fully cured.
There was no more acidity or sour
watery risings, no bloating after meals,
the appetite was vigorous and he has
gained between 10 and 12 pounds in
weight of solid, healthy flesh.
Although Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
are advertised and sold in drug stores,
yet I consider them a most valuable ad-
dition to any physician's line of reme-
dies, as they are perfectely harmless j
and can be given to children or invalids
or in any condition of the stomach with
perfect safety, being harmless and con-
taining nothing but vegetable and fruit
essences, pure pepsin and Golden Seal.
Without any question they are tha
safest, most effective cure for indiges-
tion, biliousness, constipation and all
derangements of the stomach however
slight or severe.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are sold
by druggists everywhere at fifty cents
for full sized package.

FIRST IN THE HEARTS OF HIS COUNTRYMEN
WASHINGTON'S birthday]
was made a great patriotic
holiday. Never since the
Revolution has it fallen on
more patriotic times. The
excitement following the loss
of the Maine has aroused the loyalty
and enthusiasm of the American peo
ple all over the country, and yesterday
Jt was brought to the front. There was
no general military parade as in former
years. The enthusiasm of the soldiers
was turned to a more practical vein.
They were engaged all day In prepar
ing the defenses of the harbor to repel
should one appear in consequence
of the recent disaster in the harbor of
Havana. The civilians, however, ob-
Berved the day as a festival. There
â were meetings and receptions during
the day, and in the evening there were
:?ts and entertainments at which
the memory of the Father of the Coun
try was duly honored. The athletic
g men celebrated the day by in
dulging in their favorite sr-orts. The
- al flag was displayed to a wider
t than ever before on this anni
\ ersary.
A.l all the meetings the addresses,
while filled to overflowing- with patriot
ism, contained warm expressions of
sympathy for the heroes of the Maine
iter and for the families and rela
- <>f those who went to their deaths
within the walls of the battle-ship.
HONOR THE NAME
OF WASHINGTON.
Members of the Y. M. I. Commem-
orate the Birth of the Father
of His Country.
The annual reunion of the San Fran
cisco Councils of the Young Men's In-
Btitute filled Metropolitan Hall yester
day afternoon with a patriotic and en
thusiastic audience. The exercises
â were in commemoration of the birth
-orge Washington, and the large
hall was tastefully and suitably dec
orated. On the platform when the
proceedings opened were the following
vice-presidents of the different coun
cils: W. H. McClellan, M. E. King,
A. B. Maguire, E. J. O'Rourke, Martin
W. Fleming. It. A. Miller, J. J. Shea
han, George W. Patterson, S. Pack
man, M. J. Waldheimer, Richard Dow
dall, Robert Tobin, F. J. Kierce, P. H.
Hammond, Samuel Haskins. John T.
Geary, E. B. Thomas, J. J. McDade,
George A. Stanley, Frank Murasky,
Martin E. King, Charles L. Healey, E.
J. Coffey, W. J. Hoey, Charles J. Har
rington, T. P. O'Brien, R. E. Fazacker
ley, j. T. Kavanaugh, Philip Prince
valle, J. F. Callaghan, D. E. Hayden,
H. A. Burke, John Looney, P. C. Keitz,
Ed D. Sullivan, John J. Duddy, P. J.
Hagan, Harry Kugelberg, A. Pilcovieh,
John A. Dunbravy, J. E. Gallagher and
F. E. Mahoney.
K. B. Thomas, the chairman of the
committee of arrangements, opened the
] roeeedings. In his address he spoke
of the appropriateness of the day for
such a reunion. "'The meeting of the
members of the councils of the Young
Men's Institute on this occasion," he
said, "Is to do honor to the memory
of the man who stands as our exem
plar of human freedom, George
Washington,"
John T. Greany, the president of the
day, in his address said: "It has been
the custom for years at these reunions
t'Â» honor the memory of the father of
our country. It has also been cus
tomary to congratulate ourselves on
the peace of our country. I had ono
of those peaceful speeches prepared,
but the telegraph and the cable com
menced to work and I had to change
it. I do not believe war is Imminent.
It has not yet been discovered that the
Maine was destroyed by an enemy, but
if it is, and the President issues a
proclamation defying the treacherous
foe, I have no doubt there will be a
rally from the ranks of the Tountf
Men's Institute, and they will stand
ready to do battle for their country
wherever duty calls them."
Mrs. Edith Stanley Griffin gave a
contralto solo, "Mount Vernon's Bells,"
and she was obliged to respond to an
encore. S. J. Daly gave a bass solo.
J. P. Grodjens also sang and Thomas
W. Hickey was called on for, several
recitations.
The orator of the day was Rabbi M.
S. Levy. He expressed appreciation of
thÂ« honor of being appointed orator of
the occasion. "We want to be patrio
tic." he said, "not for years is patriot
ism more needed than it is at present.
We want to teach our young men pa
triotism and loyalty to country. At
this time the nation is .on the tip toe
<if excitement. Innocent men serving
their country loyally have been sent to
meet their creator by an act that
seems impossible of explanation. Mil
lions of eyes are turned to the national
peat of government waiting to hear the
cause of disaster. I believe It was due
to an accident, but should it prove to
be from an act of treachery Columbia's
pons wijl be found equal to cope with
the emergency and to- be equal to that
< t" 1 any nation on the earth. When I
was asked to address this Fathering I
did not hesitate in giving my consent.
I felt bound to speak to this gathering,
opposite though we afe in religious
sentiment, but as one as Americans
and friends. We cherish the immortal
name of George Washingtc-n. We can
not perform acts that will link our
names with his, but give us the oppor
tunity and we will by our deeds of
Talor give our names a place of honor.
America convinced of her debt to her
Immortal sire has conferred the holiest
and noblest title upon him â father of
our country, noble siro and father of
religious toleration. Millions are doing
honor to that name to-day, but none do
it greater honor than the members of
the Young Men's Institute of Califor
nia."

lar. Members of the Reliance, Olympic,
Alameda and Lincoln Gun Clubs were
there to take advantage of the first op
portunity for match shooting since the
close of last season. A fÂ°irer day for
gunners could not have been had.
Hardly a breath of air disturbed the

DINED IN THE
CAPTAIN'S CABIN.
Pleasant Evening Spent on Board
the Naval Militia's Ship
Marion.
The old warship Marion was alive
with light and merriment last evening,
for the officers of the naval militia and
their ladies were dining in the captain's
cabin. It was the first affair of the
kind ever held by the reserves, and the
success of the event has drawn forth
demands for an early repetition.
It was at first intended to hold a re
ception to the officers of the National
Guard during the afternoon, but in
view of the disaster to the Maine it
was deemed more suitable to hold no
public ceremony.
At 7 o'clock the three long cables in
the cabin were filled, Captain Turner
presiding- in the center and Lieutenant-
Commander Nerney and Lieutenant-
Commander Klngsland at the side
tables. Every officer was in- uniform,
and the whole affair was distinctly
naval in character. The menu was an
excellent one, and when it had been
thoroughly discussed toasts were
called for.
Lieutenant-Commander Nerney pro
posed the health of Lieutenant Hughes,
the navy officer detailed as inspector of
the reserve, and the toast was drunk
to him as the representative of the
service of which the reserve is a sup
plement. Then the service itself was
toasted, Lieutenant Hughes responding;
then General James, who had be-,
friended the reserve on every occasion;
then the Governor, the captain, and
Adjutant-General Barrett responding.
The President of the United States was
toasted, and then the ladies called for
the oratorical powers of Lieutenant-
Commander Nerney, Lieutenant-Com
mander Kingsland, Lieutenant Dennis,
Lieutenant Emanuel and Lieutenant
Elliott, and then Captain Turner sug
gested that another toast be taken up.
Then a toast to the out of town re
serves was responded to by Lieutenant
Llndsey, commander of the Santa Cruz
division, and then every one drank to
the boys in blue who serve in the re
serve and constitute its greatest
strength. The toasts ended with a li
lent tribute to the men of the Maine.
The dinner over every one went out
on deck and a systematic inspection of
the ship was held by the ladies. That
being over the decks were sanded and
the guests and the officers danced until
long after the time when the regula
tions presume a warship to be asleep.
Among those present were:
Captain L. H. Turner and Mrs. Turner,
Lieutenant Hughes. U. S. N., Lieutenant
Young U. S. N., Lieutenant Commander
T A Nerney and Mrs. Nerney, Chief En
gineer G. R". Kingsland and Mrs. Kings

LEAGUE OF
IROQUOIS CLUBS.
William Jennings Bryan Indorsed
as Standard Bearer for
1900.
The annual meeting of the State
League of Iroquols Clubs was held
yesterday at the Pythian Castle. "When
the convention was called to order by
Grand Sachem Max Popper there were
about 100 delegates present.
The grand sachem in his annual ad
dress, after giving a history of the
work of the past twelve months, said
amid great applause:
"We held meetings under our aus
pices in every campaign; we attended
in a body all State conventions and in
augurations to contribute by our pres
ence to the enthusiasm that accom
panies the gathering of Democrats
when charged with a duty so satisfac
torily performed to insure the support
and approbation of all adherents of
the political faith we so steadfastly up
hold to victory or defeat. We also as
sisted at all times in extending the
hospitality of the Democracy of Cali
fornia to visiting Democrats from afar.
Particularly we contributed to perfect
the necessary arrangements and gave
proper attention to the memorable and
never-to-be-forgotten visit of our great
chieftain, the Hon. William Jennings
Bryan, the next Democratic nominee
for President of these United States,
and if all signs do not fail he will be
elected to that high and honorable of
fice in 1900."
The election of officers was next in
order, and as soon as it was announced
Grand Sachem Popper was nominated.
Popper declined the honor, saying he
was about to give up business in this
city and visit in the East for an in
definite time, and therefore he would
be unable to properly discharge the
duties. The declaration provoked loud
protests. Popper suggested Vice Grand
Sachem John C. Ruddock as his suc
cessor. That gentleman's name was
formally put to the convention, and he
was elected by acclamation. George
Cabaniss was elected vice grand sa
chem by acclamation, and Louifl
Metzger was unanimously chosen
grand treasurer. Larry J. Welch was
re-elected as grand secretary.
A resolution was adopted deploring
the Maine disaster, and other resolu
tions were placed on the minutes ad
vocating Democratic principles.
In the evening a banquet was held
at the Spreckels Cafe.
INCIDENTS OF THE BIG ROAD RACE.
The guests to the number of) two
hundred sat down at two long tables
which had been tastefully decorated
with evergreens, and the cafe through
out was likewise ornamented with
floral pieces and a huge American flag.
Gathered at the tables were men
prominent In the business, professional
and political walks of life. The doctor
rubbed elbows with the Assemblymen,
School Director, Supervisor, lawyer and
the. Senator. Each one of the guests
had a little American flag in his button
hole, and the menu cards were prettily
designed in the shape of a tomahawk,
as the emblem of the Iroquols braves,
the first page containing a picture iof
George Washington. Beside the or
chestral music the guests were enter
tained with vocal selections by J. C.
Flood, J. B. .Donahue and Charles Ban
tel.
The toastmaster of the evening was
Governor James H. Budd, and the
toasts, which were fittingly responded
to, and those who responded were as
follows:
Washington â Hon. Frank T. Shea.
Democracy â Hon. Robert Ferral.
Iroquois â Professor J. H. Simmons.

SMITH WON THE
BIG ROAD RACE
The San Jose Wheelman Makes a
New Record In the Twenty-
Five Mile Handicap.
C. M. Smith of the Clarden City
Wheelmen, San Jose, took both time
| nnd place honors in the big twenty
five-mile road race at San Leandro
! yesterday morning, adding another to
j his long list of victories on tho track
and road. With a handicao of two
minutes, he passed sixty-eight men,
finishing in first place and also making
the fastest time for the distance â
1:08:26 â which establishes a new coast
! record for the course, the best previous
! time being 1:09:34 1-5.
The California Associated Cycling
! clubs, organized some six years since
j for the promotion of road racÂ«3 and the
general good of the prominent clubs
l'eicabouts to be had by banding to
pe 1 her, while having recently assumed
I the more general functions whi?h the
j League of American Wheelmen fomior
ly performed on this coast, still con
tinues to promote four big annual road
events for its members. The first is a
twenty-fhv.'-mile handicap around the
Pan Leandrn triangle on Washington's
btrthday, of which yesterday's race was
the sixth, and the others are the 7.00
irilo relay In May, a twanty-mile team
race In July and a ten -mile handicap
In October.
The San Leandro triangle, so-called,
is an ideal course for a twenty-five
mile road race. ' The start is made in
the town of San Leandro on the road
leading toward Haywards. The riders
here have the base of the triangle,
which they follow in the direction of
Haywards, turning at a right angle be
fore reaching that town, which gives
the perpendicular and takes them
through San Lorenzo, when they turn
west on the county road from San Jose
giving the hypothenuse, which brings
them back to the place of starting. The
total distance thus covered is eight and
one-third miles, and by making the cir
cuit three times the required twenty
five miles are completed, and the spec
tators have seen the start of the race,
watched the riders pass them twice,
and been at the finish.
This course and the 100-mile relay
course to San Jose and back are two
of the most naturally adapted circuits
for cycle road races in the world, and
in this respect California wheelmen
are particularly favored, and the more
so because the roads are usually in
good condition, and "good roads" is the
slogan of the C. A. C. C.
The race yesterday called for 10 a. m..
and this necessitated such an early
start from this side that not many
gathered to see the men sent off, as
compared with the immense throng
that congregated at about the time
the finish was expected. The Â«-oad
was lined with people for a quarter
of a mile on either side of the tape,
pushing and struggling good naturedly
with each other for a coign of vantage,
and every tree and near-by house had
its quota of human freight intent on
seeing the spirited scene usual at the
finish of a road race. Ropes stretched
on either side of the road kept the
crowd in check so that the riders had
a fair field in which to finish.
Recent rain made the road rough
and muddy in places, while in others
it had improved the course by laying
the dust and hardening the roadbed.
Accidents were numerous, however,
and out of seventy-six original starters
only thirty-seven crossed the tape. No
one was severely hurt, fortunately, a
bad fall and the loss of some cuticle
being the worst reported. Among those
to suffer in this way were Louis Kra
ker, G. T. Morgan, C. S. Vogel, Clif
ford Cummings, W. Hammer, M. S.
Meyer, W. D. Wells, D. E. Francis, A.
B. Johnson, J. J. Borree, P. H. Rosen
heim. C. N. Bolte, George Kroetz, Fred
Jurgewitz, John Davidson and G. A.
Wyman.
Wyman was in the scratch bunch,
and much was expected of him, but a
punctured tire put a stop to his racing
for the day. Johnson and Francis
were both considerably bruised by falls,
Johnson nearly having an ear torn off,
and Rosenheim's wheel broke in two
and let him down on the hard earth
with a thud.
The Eastern idea of throwing water
in the faces of some of the riders to
freshen them was tried in this race.
Whether Smith, who was liberally
doused each time he came around, was
aided to his victory in this way is a
question.
Smith's ride c.t the first sixteen miles
of the journey was remarkable. In this
distance he gained over three 'minutes
on George Felix, who led as they passed
the judges the second time around, and
was in fourth position. He held this
place for the rest of the journey, sprint
ing ahead to the lead when near the
tape.
The scratch men did not help each
other as much as was expected, and
while making good time finished to
ward the last and four seconds behind
last year's record.
Smith's victory will net him in prizes
a suit of clothes and a gold watch â not
a bad day's work for an amateur.
Smith is the young man who aspired to
ride a mile paced by a locomotive in
less than one minute, and still has that
bee in his bonnet, but the necessary
arrangements could never be made
with the railroad company.
The Olympic trophy now held by the
Bay City Wheelmen, and which was
contested for in this race, was won by
the Garden City Wheelmen, the points
made being as follows: Garden City 12,
San Francisco Road Club 5, Imperials
3, Olympics 4.
The following table will show the po
sitions at the finish, handicap and net
riding time of each man:

PAST SACHEMS
IN COUNCIL.
Improved Order of Red Men Cele-
brate Washington's Birthday
by a Banquet.
Nearly two hundred members of thÂ«
Past Sachems' Association of the im
proved Order of Red Men met last
night in the Red Men's Wigwam on
Post street in celebration of the anni
versary of the birth of Washington.
An excellent banquet had been pre
pared under the direction of J. A. El
lert, Jacob Fo -zer and M. Leisen, the
committee of arrangements, and after
it had been disposed of the company
was favored with instrumental selec
tions by Past i'achem Swan and F. D.
Brandon. The master of ceremonies
introduced J. A. Filcher of the State
Board of Trade, who delivered an elo
quent address in response to the toast
"California." He told of its resources,
its grandeur, and declared that it was
one State of the Union of which, not
only its citizens but all Americans
can feel justly proud, and that every
Red Man on the reservation of Califor
nia is loyal to it. Jacob Fowzer said
that there is one thing that the order of
Red Men must never forget 1 , and that
is to honor the father of his country,
and upon his suggestion every one
present gave three rousing cheers and a
tiger for the man who was first in war.
first in peace and first in the hearts of
his countrymen.
The outburst was followed by short
addresses by C. F. Burgman, great
chief of records, A. K. Stevens, Grove
L. Johnson, B. F. Josselyn, Judge
Campbell and Judge Conlan. There
were songs by Messrs. Nelson and Col
lins and a recitation by Mr. Jennings.
A REUNION ~AT
CENTURY HALL.
Daughters of the American Revolu-
tion Honor Washington's
Memory.
Chapters Puerto del Oro, Sequoia and
California, of the Order of Daughters
of the American Revolution, held a
joint reception yesterday afternoon In
honor of the day. The hall was pret
tily decorated and the attendance was
large.' A brief address was made by
Mrs. A. S. Hubbard, expressing senti
ments appropriate to the occasion. A
programme of music was presented
and added much to the entertainment.
GOOD NEWS FOB. PRINTEBS.
A report widely circulated that the
State printing was about to be done by
the convicts incarcerated in San Quentin
prison created much uneasiness in the
ranks of printers throughout the State.
Work is very scarce at present, and to
take this work out of the hands of le
gitimate tradesmen would cause a great
deal of suffering.
A meeting of the Allied Printing Trades
Council was called and resolutions con
demnatory of such a course were adopt
ed and widely circulated. A copy of these,
together with a letter requesting him to
use his influence to prevent any such
action being taken, was forwarded to
John H. Dickinson, chairman of the
Senate Committee on State Institutions.
In reply General Dickinson forwarded the
following letter, which explains itself:
"President Allied Printing Trades
Councilâ Dear Sir: Yours of the 18th inst.
regarding resolutions relating to State
printing by convict labor was duly re
ceived. Regarding the same I am in
structed by the committee to inform you
that there'has never been any suggestion
made to or by the committee that convict
labor should be employed, and the com
mittee has no such proposition under con
sideration and would not entertain it
under any circumstances. I can assure
you that these are the sentiments not
only of the committee as a whole, but of
each individual member.
"Trusting that this information will be
satisfactory, I am yours truly,
"JOHN H. DICKINSON, Chairman."

WILLIAMS'
CASE IS IN A
LOWER COURT
An Individual Opinion
Judge Coffey Has
Formed.
The Whereabouts of the
Missing Heir of the
James Estate.
George Williams Supposed to
Have Been Killed in the
Civil War.
IS HE DEAD OR ALIVE?
Briefs Are to BÂ© Presented To- Day
by Attorneys for Both Sides of
the Controversy.
An exciting chapter In local history,
In which a lost heir constitutes the cen
tral figure, will be read at 2 o'clock this
afternoon In the Probate Court of De
partment 9 by Judge Coffey, and refers
to the argument on petition for the
final distribution of the estate of the
late Dr. James Williams.
Dr. Williams died testate in this city
March 1, 1597, and since his death no
end of trouble has been caused by
George Williams, a brother and one of
the principal legatees of the estate left
by the decedent at his death, whose
â¢whereabouts Is unknown and whose
death every one concerned in the pres
ent suit (except a .doubtful few, who
think they have a trace of him) believe
occurred some twenty years ago.
The residuary clause in his will reads: :
"In addition to the last-named bequests
(that is, bequests made to persons out-
Side his own family), I give, devise and !
bequeath unto my brothers, George
Williams and William Frederick Wil
liams, share and share alike, the resi
due of my estate, after all debts and;
all bequests are fully satisfied, unto
them and their heirs forever."
This residue mentioned in the will
amounts to $25,000 and is ready for dis
tribution according to the dictates of
the will. bÂ«t since both men to whom
the property was originally bequeathed
are unable to- claim it owing fo the fact
that one is dead and the other is miss-
Ing and can't be found, and is conse
quently supposed to be also deceased,
the point at issue is, can the estate be
settled before thp whereabouts of Geo. j
Williams la ascertained, if living, and
if dead, before positive proof of the
fact is set before the court?
The only thing that prevents the pres
ent petitioners (the widow of William

BLOWS WHICH RYAN WILL AIM AT GREEN.
A Kidneu Punch and a Jolt on the Chin That Man Cause Trouble.
Tommy Ryan, the champion welter
weight pugilist of the East, is of the
opinion that he is pursued by a hoodoo
or false spirit.
Ryan has been training for a 20
round contest with George Green for
the past four weeks at the Reliance
Athletic Club in Oakland, and to-day
he is physically in splendid condition
although somewhat disfigured.
"I cannot understand why my face
got mashed up so badly," Ryan re
marked yesterday with a sigh as he
pointed to a gash over his right eye, a
mouth which was minus two front
teeth, which doubtless had done good
service in their time, and a nose which
bore a slight resemblance to Mt. Tam
alpais because of a red mark which
ran down its center.
"You see, in the first place," he con
tinued, "this big fellow Baker, whom
I box with, smashed me in the mouth
Frederick Williams and her two sons)
from receiving the estate is a doubt as
to whether this brother is dead or
alive, although a thorough search has
been made for him from one end of
the country to the other without avail,
n<>t the slightest trace of him having
been found.
As no trace of the missing heir can
be found and as he left no wife or
children, having never been married,
the natural inference is that the en
tire bulk of the property should pass
Into the possession of Frederick's wife
and her children.
The law presumes that when a man
is absent or away from a certain com
munity for a certain space of time,
and his whereabouts has not been
heard of for the period of seven years,
he is dead. If this be true and George
Williams cannot be found his brother's

tate.
To combat this argument, that Wil
liams is dead, the attorneys represent
ing the litigation are equally hopeful of
proving beyond a reasonable doubt
that he is alive and can be found if
sufficient money is awarded to institute
further search.
The leading spirit in favor of estab
lishing this fact, and convincing the
court of the truth of his argument that
Williams is alive, is Attorney A. Boyer,
a central figure in the opposition, who
at one time, so Oliver Evans, who rep
resents Mrs. Frederick Williams,
claims, was anxious to prosecute the
suit for her against the people for
whom he is now fighting.
Many conflicting stories are told by
both sides as to the probable fate of
the missing man, and a sketch is given
J'l wish you would state that I have
always fought in the welter-weight
class against all comers, and I am
ready at any time to fight 'Kid* Mc-

is the middle-weight limit." â 
Ryan was informed that Fitzs!m
mons now holds the middle and heavy
weight championships, but he said
that "it made no difference about
"Fitz, 1 as he has retired from the ring
and that McCoy claims the title."
"Yes, I want another go at McCoy
and I will compel him to fight me at
154 pounds. He defeated me the first
time we fought, but the second time
we met I was having all the best of
the mill when the police stopped the
game.
"My match with Green is at catch
weights. I expect to enter the ring
on this occasion weighing 154 pounds,
which is nine pounds over the weight
I have fought in the East. I guess
of his life from the time he left his
home to enlist in the Union army at
the beginning of the Civil War, 'until
he was last heard of.
"At the age of 16 years." said At
torney Evans in his complaint, "George
Williams, anxious to join the Union
army, left his home and applied for
enlistment, representing that he was
IS years of age. He was admitted and
stayed with his division until just be
fore the attack on Vicksburg, when he
deserted."
The attorney here describes the dan
gers and perils to which a soldier bear
ing the Union uniform was exposed
from the rilles of the Southern soldiers
and particularly that branch of them
called guerrillas. It was at this time
and while trying to get away that ho
was supposed to have been shot and
killed.
This is the argument upon which
Green will enter the ring at 156 pounds
from what I can learn. All I want
here is a square deal, and then the
people can judge for themselves which
is the better man."
Ryan's right name is Tommy
Youngs. His father is a French-Cana
dian and his mother is a German. He
has fought fifty odd battles as a welter
weight, and his only defeat was at the
hands or fists of "Kid" McCoy two
years ago in Maspeth, N. Y. McCoy
knocked him out in fifteen rounds.
Ryan has whipped Danny Needham,
outclassed Jim Hall, the Australian
middle-weight; whipped Henry Baker,
heavy-weight; "Mysterious" Billy
Smith five times; "Shadow" Maber,
Billy McCarthy of Australia, Tom
Tracey, Jim Ryan of Australia and
many others of less fame.

rests the whole litigation, and if it can
be proven the estate and property of
James Williams will be awarded to his
brother's wife and children.
But since the war, and in fact im
mediately after it, the missing man
was reported to have been seen at
Memphis, and ten years later in New
York.
This little romance to account for the
disappearance and the possible death
of the Union soldier who is the present
cause of so much judicial wrangling
in the courts, i 3 cited by Evans as a
truth beyond denial.
The litigation contends that George
Williams has been found, but Judge
Coffey, quoting from an authority
other than legal, says that if such is
the case he must have been found
south of hades.
A point upon which the litigation
bases its argument is the fact that
inches; right wrist 7 inches; left wrist
7% inches.
Ryan's pet blows are a duck and
counter with right; a right hand punch
at chin in the breakaway. It was with
this blow that Walcott v.'-r.i iTie battle
from George Green: a kidney blow,
which he will use on Friday night. This
he described by placing his left hand
glove over his opponent's right on
breast and then by ducking inside a
left swing at neck he sends his right
hard on the kidneys. The kidney blow
which George Dawson used to such ex
cellent advantage was somewhat dif
ferent from that which Ryan uses. The
latter ducks inside the left swing and
then delivers the blow. Dawson side
stepped to the outside and then shot
in his right.
The fighters last night selected Jim
McDonald, the well-known baseball
expert and umpire, as referee. The
choice lay between McDonald and
Hiram Cook.
William Frederick Williams sometimes
signed his name as W. F. Dickinson
Williams, which they will try to prove
was not the same man mentioned in
the testator's will. This name is sup
posed by some to have been adopted by
W. F. Williams out of respect to either
his uncle or a friend.
Reviewing the suit in all its phases
from a standpoint of conservatism and
judging from the remarks of positive
truth expressed by both sides of the
case, indications point strongly to the
fact that there is going to be a "hot
time" when the opposing sides come
together this afternoon for the final
battle.

"NOT SO DEAD,
YOUR HONOR"
A Live Miner Objects to
the Probating of His
Estate.
Strange Case of Jeremiah Pen
dergast, Long Reckoned
as Deceased.
Not Asleep in Death, but a Real
Owner of African
Mines.
One of the most peculiar cases ever
administered on in the probate courts
of this city is that of Jeremiah Pender
gast, long supposed to be dead.
It came to pass that just at the mo
ment when the Public Administrator
felt the most secure in conducting the
affairs of the supposed dead capital
ist the latter gave a war-whoop in due
legal form, away over In Africa, which
has been heard here in such a way as
to stop proceedings.
Pendergast, supposed to have died
long years ago and to have left some
thing like $15,000 in the Hibernia Bank,
is now known to be alive and well in
the Congo Free State, where he haa
hired a lawyer to communicate with*
Attorney Oscar T. Shuck of this city
and make protest against the distri
bution of his estate while he is on
earth.
The story is somewhat romantic.
Nearly thirty years ago the man sup
posed to be dead opened his account
at the Hibernia Bank and soon there
after disappeared. He was known to
have been a pioneer miner and was
supposed to have perished in a fire up
in the mountains, though the banlc
could not dispose of his money with
out positive proof that he was dead.
Year after year the bank advertised
his name among the dead, and asked
for his heirs to come and claim the es
tate. Oscar T. Shuck undertook to
find the heirs, but found him instead.
"The old fellow is rich in Africa
now," said Mr. Shuck yesterday, "and
he writes to me that he hopes nobody
will assume that he is a dead one. He
is making money in mines and has
made a great fortune since he left
California. Martin Pendergast, who
shot Mrs. Rose Rice many years ago,
is a brother of the rich African miner.
The shooting was quite a sensation in
1878. The old man whose estate is ad
vertised is now well known as an un-
usually prosperous miner in the great
African districts. It is probable that
he will allow his money to remain
where it is for an indefinite period.
"In all our correspondence the old
fellow has never said why he re
mained silent so long, except to inti
mate in a way that he believed the
money was safe and he did not cars
to disturb it."
A case involving the whole matter is
now pending in Judge Slack's court,
where proof will be introduced to show
that the owner of the bank account is
still alive and that the Public Admin
istrator has no right to interfere in
the administration of the estate.BOSSES FIDDLE;

FOUR CAUSTIC REPLIES.
Citizens Whom the Councilman
Assailed Hold Him Up to Public
Scorn.
Sppoln! TMspatch to The Call.
PAX JOSE, Feb. 22. â On every side
to-day are heard words of pity and
contempt for Councilman Nolting.
Every citizen sees in his effort of last
night only the fulfillment of a task
forced upon him by his political mas
ters, the leaders of the "gang." No one
i> inclined to hold him personally re
s;Â»>npible for his vile utterances before
the Council.
It is clearly perceived that his foul
ebullition was not in any sense a spon
taneous expression, but that it was
part of a preconcerted plan of cam
paign. It is common talk that his little
piece was delivered not only to be
smirch, if possible, some of the men
opposed to gang rule, but to afford the
organs of the corruptionists a pretext
for coming into the fight against the
New Charter Club and good govern
ment. The matter which Nolting in
jected into tho Scully affair last night
was entirely foreign to the subject un
der discussion.
That it was the object of the gang
k leaders to make an opening for their
newspaper backers was shown by the
attitude of the Mercury this morning.
In the course of a double-leaded edi
torial two-thirds of a column long the
unseemly course of Nolting- is strongly
Indorsed, and the New Charter Club is
condemned by indirection. The main
organ of the gang has evidently not the
courage to attack it openly. Further
along this editorial has the following
insidious suggestion:
The City Central committees of the Re
â¢^ ibllcan and Democratic parties have re
fused to join in the convention for the
nomination of a single ticket for me mu
nicipal offices. The citizens of ian Jose
low demand that those committees agree
to call a convention for the nom. nation
of a single, non-partisan ticket selected
from the two parties, the delegates to
comprise only citizens of recognized in
tegrity, whose motives cannot be called
in question.
Xo citizen of intelligence is decived
by this, for the single reason that the
committees of both parties are known
to be carried in the pockets of the
bosses. Anything manipulated by
them would, therefore, be by the gang,
of the gang and for the gang.
This suggestion is in line with the
known policy of the corruptionists.
Everything possible will be done to
split the vote and sap the strength of
the supporters of the reform move
ment. If the proposed Democratic-
Ri publican fusion ticket becomes an
accomplished fact, the next move of
the gang will be to put ostensibly in
dependent candidates in the field. In
this will lie the greatest danger to th<;
cause of good government. There is
only one way to overcc-me it. Every
sincere seeker for municipal reform
must refuse to run independently and
must cast his vote for the New Char
ter Club ticket, from top to bottom.
The men most directly assailed be
fore thÂ»? Council make answer to the
attacks on them through the columns
of The Call. W. B. Hardy's reply is as
follows:
The political cesspool of spite and vile
abuse of small-bore ward politicians last
night overflowed in the Council chamber
through the mouth of Councilman Nolt-
King, and as might have been expected
those citizens who in their endeavor to
suppress the nuisance had comf in closest
contact with its cause were the first to
have. their garments soiled with the foul
stream. The disreputable cabal of San
Jose political tricksters, of which Coun
cilman Nolting is a conspicuous member,
h-a-s been so long exempt from punish
ment as to believe retributive justice to
exist only in the imagination. The pub
lic treasury, in the estimation of this
clique, is the spoils to be apportioned
among those whose only means of sup
port is derived from that source.
Supplies of all kinds were purchased,
labor performed and contracts entered
into by members of the city government
in direct violation of the city charter.
At last, to prevent the total bankruptcy
of the city treasury, a vigilance com
mittee was formed to interpose the
strong arm of the law in defense of the
people, to stay the wholesale plunder of
these miscreants. This committee, com
posed of some of the largest property
holders and best-known citizens in San
Jose, employed myself and other attor
neys to institute leÂ«Â»al proceedings to set
asirte certain alleged contracts that were
about to be made by the Common Coun
cil, and this employment is the imme
diate cause of the hostility of Council
man Nolting to me. I commend to him
the fable of the viper gnawing the file,
and advise him that the vigilance com
mittee has resolved to remain in session
until his term of office expires and he has
been relegated to that obscurity which
awaits all petty ward politicians of his
class and caliber.

JAKMAN SCORES NOLTING.
Styles Him the Most Treacherous
Member of a Thieving Gang.
SALINAS, Feb. 22.â The remarks of
Councilman Nolting in the San Jose
Council chamber Monday evening show
conclusively that the gang of unprin
cipled scoundrels â of which he is the
deepest dyed, the most cunning and
treacherous, void of moral rectitude or
manly honor and using his official au
thority only to punish his enemies, to
put his relatives in positions and to
coax or coerce every <> ne connected
with the various city departments to
patronize his grocery or barroom â are
at their wit's end to know what to do
to continue their reign of public plun
der and system of boycotting of all
those who dare to oppose or expose
their villainous methods of collusion
for looting the city or for the vilifica
tion of honorable citizens who will not
sacrifice their independence and free
dom of thought and action.
Mr. Nolting in his bitter spleen and
anxiety to get even with somebody who j
he imagines is interfering with what j
he considers a legitimate livelihood, but
which all honest men would look upon
with abhorrence, accuses me while
Councilman and during my candidacy
for Supervisor of spending $2000 in im
provement about the City Hall, and,
inferentially, of using the expenditure
to assist my election. The facts are as
follows and can be verified by the rec
ords in the Cltv Hall:
The structure committee, consisting,
if my memory serves me right, of A. S.
Mangran, W. T. Nolting and J. P. Fay,
had a resolution passed by the Council
empowering them to have certain clos
ets taken out of the City Hall to be re
placed with an improved kind, and to
paint the roof and woodwork outside of
the City Hall. The committee re
quested me to take charge of and su
perintend the work, for the reason that
I had a practical knowledge of the
business.
I learned afterward that It was a trap
set by the bosses to insure my defeat
as Supervisor, they taking it for
granted that I would do as they would
under similar circumstances, that is,
furnish all the materials from my own
store and have my own painter do the
work. I did not furnish an ounce of
material nor did I put one of my men
on the work, nor did I handle one dol
lar of the money. The foreman, F. G.
Currier, . managed the job and worked
eight hours a day. The rest of the men
were paid $2 50 a day and drew their
own warrants.
They worked hard and earned every
dollar they received. The material was
purchased from G. B. MacKee & Co.,
D. Rinaldo and M. Lenzen & Son. I
devoted a good deal of time to super
intending the work and without any
compensation. The entire painting,
including labor and material, amounted
to about $1000. It is a matter of re
cord and can easily be verified. It was
one piece of work where the city got
value received.
I was in my store one evening when
a man who was in touch with the gang,
but who had yet a little spark of man
hood left, told me that he- had Just left
a few of the scoundrels who had decid
ed to send cappers out all over the city
to inform the church people especially,
that "Jarman was drunk on Friday
evening and had to be taken home by
two men."
No person on the face of the earth
ever saw me under the influence of
liquor. I did not believe that men could
be so callous and lost to all sense of
honor, yet they did report it and with
such er>od effect that the minister of
the church in San Jose preached it trmm
his pulpit. On learning how he had
been imposed upon he made all the
reparation in his power.
Another scheme they resorted to was
to visit all Catholics they could and in
form them that "Jarman was an A.
P. A.," which I was not. Then they
turned around and visited the A. P.
A.'s and told them I was a Catholic,
which was not true.
The New Charter Club and the good
people of San Jose must put no cre
dence in any reports derogatory to
their candidates, as this ring of thieves
will stop at nothing short of murder
to accomplish their ends.

HONOLULU. Feb. 15.â The American
bark Arago, which sailed for San Fran
cisco on the 11th inst., was towed back
to port yesterday afternoon in a very
much disabled condition by the Wil
ders" steamship Lehua. During a
heavy blow on last Friday night her
foretopgallant, main and mizzen masts
were carried away, and she drifted
helplessly so close to the breakers off
Koko head that Captain Greenleaf gave
up all hope of saving her. Signal lights
were hoi6ted, and one steamer in pass
ing answered them. Another steamer
that passed must have seen the lights,
but neither steamer attempted to ap
proach the distressed vessel.
The Lehua picked the Arago up
about 6 o'clock yesterday morning: in
almost midchannel. The master of
the Lehua saw the barkentine's colors
reversed, and bearing down on the
vessel took her in tow. It was slow
work, as the Arago was deep in the
water and the steamer had a big load
in her hold. Both vessels reached port
safely and the barkentine is now tied
up at a wharf, where she will remain
until Captain Greenleaf can hear from
her owners in San Francisco.
Captain Greenleaf states that the
Arago cast off from the tug about 4
o'clock last Friday while in the chan
nel. About Bp.m. an unexpected
heavy sea was encountered. The Arago
was under storm canvas, but the ter
rible strain as she pitched forward was
sufficient to break the lashings of the
fore topgallant yard, which In falling
carried away the topsail yards. The
Â«Â° m^ nn t ce h d w , ei&ht n of yards carried
auay the topgallant mast, and the
whole wreckage fell so as to crino *
the mainsail yard and leave the ship in
The wind was then blowing a gale
and a very high sea was running. An
hour later the main mast was broken
oft at the deck, and in falling it carried
the mizzen mast away, excepting about
fifteen feet above the deck. Only one
mast was left standing, and that was
crippled by the falling wreckage
In the meantime the ship was help
less and was drifting rapidly toward
the rocks off Koko head, then scarcely
four miles distant. The night was black
and the thunder storm was at its
height. The captain had given up all
hope of saving his vessel when a
steamer was discovered scarcely four
miles distant. Blue lights were burned,
but the signals were not answered
Later another steamer passed, but
while she answered the signals she did
not go near the wreck.
By the greatest good fortune the Ara
go Just cleared the point, and stood off
in clear water. She was so crippled
that she could not tack. She drifted
about for three nights and was finally
secured by the Lehua and towed to
port.
The Arago is bejieved to be all right
below decks, as she Is not taking any
water. Captain Greenleaf says he will
not do anything with her until he hears
from her owners, the Simpson Lumber
Company of San Francisco.
It is understood that the Wllders
Steamship Company will put in a claim
for $30,000 salvage for rescuing the ves
sel and her cargo of sugar. The latter
is valued at $67,000.
Some fears are entertained for the
bark S. C. Allen and the barkentlne S.
O. Wilder. Both vessels put to sea on
the same day the Arago left port.
Charles W. Day, a well-known resi

SACRAMENTO, Feb. 22.â While the
lips of Thomas Snyder, the accused
Supervisor of Yolo County, remain
sealed, the tongues of others are bab
bling and new rumors are floating
thick and fast. The most recent con
tribution from the town of many scan
dals comes with the statement of
George N. Turner, which is in line
with the assertion made by Ed Curry,
who said in the presence of Thomas
Lovedale, Assessor Chamberlain and
Casselman, that Snyder had offered
him $100 to "let up on the gamblers."
George Turner's statement is as fol
lows:
"In the first place I am a very warm
friend of Ed Curry's. He helped me
out once when I was in trouble, and
when he took up the fight against the
gamblers I stayed with his end of It
and swore to a warrant myself. The
warrant I swore to was against Pete
Boyle, and was filed on the 18th day of
May, 1897. Just before the case was
to come up I met Tom Snyder In the
ladies' entrance of the West End
saloon, where he gave me $5 and told
me to go and dismiss the case against
Boyle."
"Did you receive the money from
him?" he was asked.
"He paid it to me with his own
hands."
"Was there any one present?"
"Yes."
"Who?"
"He is a very prominent man in the
town of Washington, and I do not want
to divulge his name now, but if the
matter ever comes up where I am com
pelled to answer I shall."
"Are you sure he saw you?"
"He could not help it because he was
standing within one foot of Snyder and
me, and overheard Tom tell me to go
and have the case dismissed."
"What did you then do?"
"I went and had It dismissed."
"Do you remember the amount of the
costs?"
"Yes; four dollars and a half."

MRS. PINKHAM'S STANDING INVITATION.
Women suffering from any form of female weakness are invited to promptly
communicate with Mrs. Pinkham at Lynn, Mass. All letters are received,
opened, read and answered by women only. A woman can freely talk of her
private illness to a woman; thus has been .established the eternal^confidence be-,
tween Mrs. Pinkham and the women of America which has never been broken. ;
Out of the vast volume of experience which she has to draw from, it is more
than Dossible that she has gained the very knowledge that will help your :
case. She asks nothing in return except your good-will, and her advice
relieved thousands. ; Surely any woman, rich or poor, is very foolish if she does
not take advantage of this generous off of assistance.â Lydia L. Pipkham

the record. In connection with the
circumstance Mr. Snyder said:
"I never gave Turner one single dol
lar for the purpose of having him dis
miss any case. The only money that
has ever passed between him and me
has been on occasions when I have
paid him for some work that he has
done for the county. I deny every
word of his statement as a falsehood.
I never gave him money; I never told
him to dismiss that case. That is all
I have to say."
Thomas Lovedale, who is mentioned
in the memorandum made by Cassel
man on the 22d day of November, 1897,
upon being asked the question whether
or not he heard Ed Curry say that Su
pervisor Snyder had offered him $100
to "quit on the gamblers," replied:
"I have been dragged into this affair
without my consent, and shall make
no statement one way or the other
concerning that conversation. When
this matter comes up in court it will
be time for me to make a statement,
and before that I most respectfully re
fuse to be interviewed."
Mr. Lovedal is a very prominent man
in the county of Yolo, and much re
gret is expressed by many that he
should refuse to tell what he knows.
His word would be accepted without
a moment's hesitancy and would have
great weight in whatever direction the
influence of his statement would tend.
George K. Rider, who is also men
tioned several times in the Casselman
statement, was seen at his home on
Fifth street this morning. Mr. Rider is
associated with Frank Daroux in the
proprietorship of the Washington pool
rooms. Said he:
"In the first place I am too old a
duck to be caught doing such a foolish
thing as to offer or give a man a bribe
in the broad sunlight in the presence
of a dozen people. Had I been doing
the business Mr. Casselman gives me
credit of doing, you may depend upon
it he nor no other man would have wit
nessed the transaction. I remember
the occasion very well when I gave
Tom Snyder some greenbacks at the
depot in this city. It was one morning
just before he was going to Woodland.
I intended giving it to him up town,
but in some way missed him, so went
to the depot knowing that I could over
take him before he left. I stood wiiere
I could have been seen by at least a
dozen people, and knew at the time
that that was the situation, i did hand
Supervisor Snyder some money. It was
currency. It was not $100, however,
nor was there much of a wad. It
amounted just exactly to one-tenth of
$100â in other words, I handed Snyder
on that occasion the sum of $10, the
denomination being two $5 bills."
"For what was this money given?
was asked.
"I was paying a license fee for some
saloon keeper over in Washington," re
plied Mr. Rider.
"Did you ever have a talk with Cas
selman about it?"
"I believe I did on one occasion, and
if I remember right, I told him what I
gave to Snyder, together with a state
ment of the purpose."
"What business relations do you
have, if any, with Abe Morris at Wood
land?"
"We pay him a commission for the
money he handles for us. I believe he
makes about $100 a month. We pay it
to him, not for the purpose of securing
ourselves in any way, but simply as
a business proposition. Why, we do
the same thing in Fresno and other
places in the State. Money is handled
for us by some local man, and for that
we pay him a commission. lam look
ing for a good man now to represent
us in the city of Stockton. We are
known throughout the State as being
reliable. Men know that when they
play their money with us they will be
treated right, and for that reason we
have many connections similar to
the one with Abe Morris at Wood
land."
"Did you ever contribute arty part of
$250 for the purpose of repealing the
present ordinance?"
â¢'Do you mean the two-fifty Abe
Morris has been reported as getting?"
"Yes."
"Well, that Is the biggest fool propo
sition of any. Do you think I would ex
pend any part of $250 to the end of re
pealing an ordinance that suited me to
death? Why. say. I would be more apt
to loosen up a few dollars to have that
ordinance remain just as it is. Under
that ordinance, I can run my games
with impunity. W T hy should I want it
changed for one under which they
might bring me to time? No, sir; you
are all wrong on that proposition.
When my men were all arrested I em
ployed an attorney of Woodland to se
cure a dismissal of the case. I told him
I wanted my case dismissed and not
to bring the ordinance to a test. I was
satisfied where I stood, provided I could
avoid a trial. I do not know what was
done or how it was done. I paid my at
torney â Baker was his name â I paid
him, I say, to have these cases dis
missed. He got them dismissed with
out attacking the validity of the ordi
nance and that is what I wanted. He
did the work for me and I paid him and
asked no questions."
"Do you contribute anything for pro
tection now?"
"We do not."
"Has Tom Snyder an interest in the
games?"
"He has not; no more than you have.
"Are you satisfied with the present
state of affairs in Washington?"
"More than satisfied," replied Rider,
with a smile, as he excused himself and
said no more, â 
Asiatic cholera was first supposed to
have originated from the consumption
of unsound rice, and was called "the
rice disease."

Kidney and Bladder Troubles Quickly Cured.
You May Have a Sample Bottle of the Great Discovery,
Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root, Sent Free by Mail.
Men and women doctor their troubles [
so often without benefit that they get
discouraged and skeptical. In most
such cases serious mistakes are made
in doctoring and in not knowing what
our trouble is or what makes us sick.
The unmistakable evidences of kidney
trouble are pain or dull ache in the
back, too frequent desire to pass water,
scanty supply, smarting irritation. As
kidney disease advances the face looks
sallow or pale, puffs or dark circles
under the eyes, the feet swell and
sometimes the heart acts badly. Should
further evidence be needed to find out
the cause of sickness, then set urine
aside for twenty-four hours; if there
is a sediment or settling it is also con-
vincing proof that our kidneys and
bladder need doctoring. A fact often
overlooked is that women suffer as
much from kidney and bladder trouble
as men do.
Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root is the dis-
covery of the eminent physician and
scientist and is not recommended for
everything, but will be found just what
is needed in cases of kidney and blad-

AFTER SHARKEY'S SCALP.
Will Be Given a Bout in Court Before He
Meets Big Jim Jeffries,
TOM SHARKEY will have a bout with the courts before he puts on the gloves
with Jim Jeffries, the Los Angeles Giant. The Union Delivery and Storage
Company will engage him In legal combat to-day and endeavor to prove be
fore the law that the "Pride of the Navy" is "a very cheap guy." The con
troversy â will be over two hand satchels and a trunk. Sharkey holds the disputed
articles. The delivery company will go Into court armed with an unpaid bill for
transportation charges.
Sharkey, who has taken up training headquarters at Hoggerty's.on the Ocean
Beach, had his clothing and training apparatus shipped him from "C"allejo. The
articles were securely packed in two valisea and a trunk and shipped on the
steamer Sunol, which arrived here Monday morning. Sharkey's brother and one
of his trainers were at the wharf to receive the baggage. After receiving the
checks they turned them over to an agent of the Union Delivery and Storage
Company, with Instructions to have the satchels and trunk delivered at Heg
gerty's without unnecessary delay. No bargain was made as to the amount to
be charged for the delivery of the baggage.
That oversight on the part of the delivery company's agent and Sharkey's
representative is the cause of the present trouble.
The two satchels and trunk were entrusted to Joseph Griffin, oneof the driv
ers in the employ of the company, with instructions to make all possible haste
to Heggerty's and to be equally speedy In collecting the charges. When Griffln
reached the training quarters he jumped off the wagon and picking up the two
satchels entered the place. He asked for Sharkey, and after delivering the
satchels presented to him the way bill calling for $5 transportation charges.
Sharkey, who had been punching the bag when the delivery wagon arrived,
was somewhat exhausted, and when the bill was presented to him he almost col
lapsed.
"Five dollars!" lie feebly ejaculated.
"Correct, sir," said â¢ irifTin, affably. "It is a long run out here, and the team
will have to be put In the stable when I get back to the city."
Shnrkny had by that time recovered somewhat from the knockout blow given
him by the bill.
"I want you to understand, young fellow," said he, "that while I'm not a
cheap guy, I'm not a sucker. I won't pay any such amount."
"Then you can't have the trunk," replied Griffin.
Sharkey was in a towering rage in an instant, and danced around the room.
He wae In ring costume and Griffln was overawed. Fearing that Sharkey might
take him for a punching bag he suggested a little long range fighting. He as
sured Sharkey that he was not responsible for the size of the bill and that the
only redress to be had would be from the office.
"I'm not a cheap guy," repeated Sharkey, who had cooled down in a measure.
"Two dollars is all I will pay you."
"I will have to return the trunk to the city," said Griffln, "for if I do not
collect I will be held responsible for the charges."
Sharkey then engaged in some deep Thinking and evolved a strategic play.
"You had better telephone your office." said ho to Griffln, "and learn if a
mistake has not been made."
Griffln, who feared that his nose might at any moment be spread over his face,
quickly caught at the idea of using the telephone. While he was engaged at the
'phone Sharkey slipped out of the room.
"They say that rather than have any trouble they will accept $4 from you,
Mr. Sharkey." said Griffln. turning from the telephone.
The room was deserted. Griffin hurried out on the beach and found Sharkey
directing the removal of the trunk from the wagon by two of his trainers.
Griflln protested. He said that the removal of the trunk under existing cir
cumstances was a.n offense punishable by law. Sharkey was obdurate and the
trunk was carted into the training quarters. As an act of condescension Sharkey
signed a receipt for the satchels and trunk and after his name wrote "protest."
When Griffln returned ;to the office and told the story of his adventures hia
employers became wroth and declared they would invoke the aid of the Jaw.
"We are not going to stand any such imposition," said S. A. Hussey, president
of the delivery company. la;;t night, "and before we get through with Sharkey he
will realize that he has been in a mix-up. We intend having a warrant issued
for his arrest to-morrow and if the criminal courts cannot deal with the case
we will try the civil courts. It will cost Sharkey more than $5 before- he is
through with us. It is not the first time that he has tried such tactics. He says
that he is not a cheap guy. 1 feel that befora we are finished he will find that he
is mistaken on that point."
been heard in this city. He spoke in j
part as follows:
"The fiftieth anniversary of any !
event is its golden jubilee. On the 24th '
of last month we .celebrated, by a j
grand pageant in the streets of this i
city,' the- golden jubilee of the discov- j
cry of gold on the Pacific slope. This j
magnificent mining fair is but a con- i
tinued celebration of that event, and j
to-day, set apart by your committee
as miners" day, is reserved for an ex- j
elusive mining celebration of the won- j
derful discovery of gold that ultimately i
gave to the world a new common- I
wealth, and to the flag of the Union its
thirty-first star.
"To-day, which under ordinary cir
cumstances we would devote exclu
sively to a celebration of the birthday
of the 'Father of His Country": to
day, while our eyes are still moist with
sorrow for the fate of the brave men

of the pride of % our navy, and while we
tire yet patiently waiting to know
what it means; to-day, we celebrate
an event that finally gave to our coun
try its most valued and largest terri
torial acquisition. We feel that Amer
ica must still yield to the manifest des
tiny that makes her great. No hostile
threat of any foreign power, and no
grasping insolence of any domestic
trust shall dispel our hope, that the
stars and stripes will yet float tri
umphant from Newport News to Pearl
Harbor, from Washington to Havana,
and from Honolulu to the Golden Gate.
"My friends, gold is the theme of the
day we celebrate. But he ill interprets
the thought and the ideals of our peo
ple who imagines that in this State, or
on this day, or in our heart of hearts
we do not know that the claim of Cali
fornia to the gratitude of the nation
can never rest alone on the fact of the
material discovery of fifty years ago, or
the material production of the years
that have followed. This is Indeed the
Golden State, but, beyond all our
golden one billion, three hundred mil
lion dollars of the royal metal, beyond
our golden grain, our golden oranges,
our golden poppies, our golden sunshine
and our golden wine, the history of our
pioneer fathers and mothers, their
struggles and triumphs in frontier life
and mining camp contain a promise,
that here, in the veins of this mighty
commonwealth, In the life and soul of
this great people, are other treasures,
the outcroppings of which we see to
day, the gold of an uprigTit, downright
lightning defying intellectual honesty;
the gold of a sincere and reverent
spirituality; the gold of a frank, brave,
strong and tender manhood; the gold
of an intelligent, loving, loyal, pure
and plucyy womanhood. These are the
treasures which California will lay at
the feet of the nation; these are the
virtues which are the lineal descend
ants of the courage and the heroism
and high endeavor of the gulches and
the mines, of those immortal scenes
and incidents of the days of '49 that are
to be the burden and the theme of the
[unsung Iliad' of the Sierras and the
pines."
The Cornish wrestling contest for
heavy and light weights were next
upon the programme and proved most
interesting. The judges were J. Pol
kinhorn and E. S. Van Court, while the
referee was George Miehli^er of the
Olympic Club. The first contest was
between J. W. Jaffaud, 197 pounds, and
Fred Webster, 185 pounds. Jaffaud
was an easy winner in the first bout,
Webster being in no condition.
The second contest, between James
Rodda, 156 pounds, and Charles Has
kins. 160 pounds, was a lively one, and
lasted for six bouts. Haskins won.
Thomas Whalen, 171 pounds, and Ollie
Phillips, 148 pounds, put up a lively
four bouts. The contest was won by
Whalen. The terms of the wrestling
were for two hips and a shoulder or
two shoulders and a hip to constitute
a fall. The other wrestling and rock
drilling contests come off to day and
to-morrow.
It was 2:30 o'clock Jn the afternoon
when Governor Budd and staff, accom
panied by Hon. Jacob H. Neff, presi
dent of the California State Miners'
Association, Mayor Phelan, Colonel E.
A. Benicke and S. J. Hendy, entered
the Pavilion and took seats upon the
band stand. Their entrance was the
signal for the formal opening of the
miners' day exercises and the crowd
rapidly gathered around the stand.
President Neff bespoke success for
the miners' day and paid the fair a
high compliment for its varied exhibit
and excellent management. He then
introduced Governor Budd, who spoke
as follows:
"Fifty years ago when gold was first
discovered it started an immigration
to California from the other States of
all kinds and classes of people, who
sought here not only gold, but a new
home. Presto, in a few years Califor
nia became a State, and now it is the
first of all the States In the Union. J
(Great applause.)
"California, the State which discov
ered gold, and which to-day gives this !
exhibition, will, in connection with :
other States, give an exhibition that ;
shall be second only to that of the j
great national exposition held at Chi- ,
cago. Let us start and fight for fhe j
coming exposition, and two years from
this day we shall realize it. My friends
we have the miners with us to-day,
and we also have the best Mayor that
San Francisco has ever had and he
will speak to you now."
Mayor Phelan with this introduction,
after acknowledging the compliment
paid him, said:
"San Francisco is the chief city of
the State and coast, and many and
vast are the benefits derived from its
great commercial prosperity. This pros
perity makes possible in the art of
mining what otherwise would not be
possible. Her citizens are eager to do
their best, and this exhaustive display
testifies the fact.
"By a strange coincidence it Is Just
fifty years since gold was discovered
here, and now comes a similar discov
ery in the great north. This will
only serve to add to the glory and gain
of the city. Let me add that, while
the money of this city has made many
things possible to the miners, they
have repaid their debt, for with their
orders for mining outfits and machin
ery, they In their turn have made it
possible for those firms to establish
plants here that enable them to help
build the American navy; so that San
Francisco has become known as a ship
building city. On this Washington's
birthday, while we welcome you to our
city, let us not forget that California
is part and parcel of this great Union,
ever ready to do her part in upholding
the national honor, and we cannot tell
from the present crisis how soon she
may be called upon."
At the conclusion of the addresses
the invited guests witnessed the three
handed drilling contests between the
representatives of Nevada and Tuo
lumne counties.
Nevada County was represented by
Pat and John Feeney and Joe Larkin,
and Tuolumne by Lewis Page, John
Kitto and John Dingle. The first prize
was $225, and the second $120. This was
offered by the State Miners' Associa
tion. The terms of the contest were for
fifteen minutes' drilling in solid granite
and while the world's record of 43
inches was not broken excellent ones
were made. The judges were Professor
Waldmer Lindgren of Stanford Uni
versity and Professor S. B. Christy of
the University of California, while "Ed
ward H. Benjamin was the time
keeper.
Tuolumne County won the toss and
took the second hole and the second
round. This made Nevada County open
the contest and at the crack of the
pistol they began. Larkin held the drill

ners could make It. the occasion being a
reception to friends given by the petty
officers and members of the local div'l
i sions of the militia. Overhead there were
canvas awnings and the scene was
made brilliant by numerous incan
descent lights that gave the hun
dreds of ladles and their escorts who
were invited an opportunity to see what a
warship looks like when decorated on an
occasion of ceremony. In addition to the
many citizens there were present Captain
Turner, Lieutenant Commander T. A.
Nerney, executive officer, and many of
the other officers.
Between 8 and 9 o'clock there was a
promenade concert, during which time the

Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; isotherms, or dotted lines, equal |
temperature. The word "high" means high I
barometric pressure and Is usunlly accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres
sure and Is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure Is high In the Interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain Is probable;
but when the "low" Is Inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon !s lm
frobable. With a "high" in the vicinity of
daho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
In summer and colder weather In winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

War] and now he calmly lays down i-n
tbelr camp. Less than a month ago he
very anxious that nothing should
be 'lone that would jeopardize reason
able rates, and he took special precau
tions to guard against any jugglery
such as occurred last night, and now
he is with those who were formerly so
odious to him. Why this change?
Major Woodward was appointed last
Friday to fill the place of a man who
nad declined to support the outrage,
ana when asked what course he intend-
"I have studffd water rates for
twenty six years. I have nothing to
say in defense of my vote other than
that i believe 1 have done my duty,
and knowing such to be the case,
there is no p ,\ver on earth that can
vhange me," said Mr. Woodward
to-day.
Ed to pursue he said: "I go into office
without a single string on me and can
be counted on the side of the people.
I intend that my record as a Council
man shall be as clean as my record as
a sofdier." " -:/. - .* r '.'v
. Now people are "wondering what the
"record as a soldier" could have been,
and are asking: "Why this change?"
Last Saturday Woodward said he had
not given the water question any study,
but could be counted "on the side of
the people." To-day he said: "The
fact that I was only in my first meet
ing of the Council cuts no figure, for
1 have been studying the question for
twenty-six years."
City Attorney Dow said to-day:
"The city charter prescribes that the
water rates must be fixed by ordinance-
It is true that the State constitution
says that municipalities shall fix wa
.cr rates cither by ordinance or resolu
tion, bnt the provision of the charter
docs not conflict with this, it simply
specifics the method of fixing the rates
more definitely.
" In a San Francisco case the Supreme
Court held that it Mas not necessary
for the water rate ordinance to be signed
by the Mayor, but that decision was
based on the provisions of the consol
idation act, which applies only to San
Francisco- Tl at act enumerates certain
measures which must be approved by
the A. ay or and the fixing of water rates
i not mentioned among these. There
fore, the court held that it was not
necessary for the water rate ordinance
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 1898.
to go to the Mayor in that city
"In case that an attempt is made to
collect water rates in accordance with
the resolution passed last night any
rate payer can contest the matter in the
courts. Holding the opinion, as 1 do,
that the action of the Council in the
premises is illegal I could not appear in
defense of the measure as passed."
The section of the city charter re
ferred to by City Attorney Dow, cover
ing the matter of fixing water rates,
reads as follows: . "The Council shall
have power to pass ordinances to fix
and determine annually iho latcs of
compensation to be collected by any
person, company or corporation in the
city for the use of water supplied to the
city or the inhabitants thereof and to
prescribe penalties for the violation of
all ordinances pa-scd in reference to
matters contained in this subdivison."

Â® Here are a few of the opinions Â®
Â® of officials and citizens of Oak- Â®
Â® land: Â®
EX-MAYOR MACK WEB
BERâIt looks bad. The action
had the appearance of being cut
and dried. The water companies
could afford to have paid $25,
000 for that resolution.
EX-COUNCILMAN WALTER
G. MANUELâ Language fails
one in such cases to express
one's disgust and discourage
ment. It must be clear to every
one that the Council has sold
out. It Is very discouraging to
one who has sought to do his
duty in such a matter as this to
see all of the -work of years
knocked out at one blow. As far
as I can judge in a hasty exami
nation the resolution raises the
present rates from 50 to 60 per
cent, and possibly more. It con
tains all of the Jokers of the '91
ordinance, such as raises on hy
drants, extras for bathtubs and
other incidentals.
EX-COUNCILMAN W. O.
BUCKLANDâ I don't think the
Couneilmen are traitors to the
people; I know they are. The
action last night is clearly il
legal, as they took no trouble to
investigate the cost of the water
companies' plants. They have
no right to make a rate based on
two plants more than on twenty.
If they construct twenty water
plants here, according to their
view, the rates would be so high
as to be prohibitive. I don't
want to say what I think of such
actions by our Council. It is
very evident why one member
resigned and some one else was
appointed to the Council, after
last night's work.
* * *
POLK GRAYâ lt's a rank rob
bery. Look what that man
Thomas has done, Fibush re
signs and instead of going to the
people of the Fifth Ward and
consulting with them, and ask
ing them if they had some man
in whom they had confidence
and could recommend, he ap
points this man Woodward be
fore any one could get to the
City Hall with a petition or pro
test.
O. I. DENISONâ It is just
what I expected. Now look for
a general clean-up on the sale
of the City Hall Park and the
purchase of a park site.
â¢ Â« â¢
EXrCOUNCILMAN C. W.
WILKINSâ I called the turn last
night, and it came out just as I
predicted. Fibush was a little
uncertain; the water comapnies
wanted some one they could de
pend upon.
â¢ â¢ *
W. H. WEILBYEâ WeII, I can't
find language to express myself
on such an occasion as this.
What is the matter with Thomas
and Woodward? It looks very
much like a put-up job. I can't
find words to express my con
tempt for such actions, and I
don't think tar and feathers are
any too good for such men. It
is outrageous. I wondered what
idea Thomas had in putting
such a man as Woodward into the
office, when there were so many
substantial men in the city who
have some interest in the city's
welfare, who could have been se
cured to take the place. I was
more surprised at the action ta
ken, but can see now that it was
clearly a part of the general
scheme being worked out
* * â¢
MTLES DOODY-Thafs a
great trick Fibush played on us
He did not want to disgrace the
Jews and let Woodward do It
â¢ â¢ â¢
JULIUS ZABELâIt looks as
though Woodward thought he
was the people.
â¢ â¦ â¢
JACOB HARRIS-The Coun
cil ought to be hung in effigy
It's a disgrace to a civilized com
munity.
â¢ â¢ â¢
DR R. E. BAUSKE-The re
sult of such an action will be to
injure property and to drive
away capital. Already the taxes
are too high and the water rates
heretofore have been excessive
The result in, that people will not
invest in Oakiand and many of
those who are here will want to
get away This is the natural
result of the system. The people
should own their own water
works and other public utilities
and then there would be an in
come to the city from guch
sources, and it would remove
one of the chief causes of cor
ruption. It is too bad that we
cannot get men who will stand
with the people.
â¢ â¦ â¢
COLONEL JOHN P. IRISHâ
It would appear that the peo
ple who supposed that Mr Din
gee's Water Company was an
eleemosynary enterprise and
that he and Moffltt were in water
and politics for their health were
mistaken.
The question, "What caused the
change?" is not yet answered.
Ben Hill Brought Home.
OAKLAND. Feb. 22.-Benjamin L Hill
convicted of shooting his wife on thp
streets of this city one night about a year
ago, was brought to the County Jail this
afternoon from San Quentin where he
has been confined for the past five months
or more. The first three was while await
ing execution. His case was appealed to
the Supreme Court and a stay granted
The lower court was sustained and now
Judge Ellsworth will set a new date for
his execution to-morrow morning HMi
will be returned to San Quentin to-mor
row. The Governor has promised to give
the condemned man a hearing, which It
is expected will result in a commutation
to life imprisonment.
Adams Point Park.
OAKLAND, Feb. 22.â The ordinance de
claring the Adams Point Track necessary

TOOK POISON
FROM A QUACK
Narrow Escape of a Man
Who Patronized a
Peddler.
Was Near Death From Acute
Spasms When Relief
Came,
Charles Elliott Was Induced to Take
Generously of Wormwood
Mixture.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 22.
Charles E. Elliott was seriously pois
oned last evening through taking some
medicine that had been given him by
a traveling quack doctor.
For sometime Elliott has been suf
fering from dyspepsia, and about a
week ago he was advised to place him
self in the hands of an itinerant ven
dor of nostrums. Elliott did so and
was told that he was suffering from
worms and that a decoction of worm
wood would soon effect a cure. The
medicine was prepared and Elliott fol
lowed the instructions very faithfully.
Each day he became worse and was
told that the medicine was of that
peculiar nature that makes people
sick before it cures them.
Last night Elliott became violently
sick and was seized with convulsions
and spasms. When Dr. D. L. Jones
arrived the patient was in a very ser
ious condition and death was very
near. It was at once seen that Elliott
was poisoned and that his whole sys
tem was permeated with the irritant.
As soon a.Â« his wife had told Dr. Jones
the story he decided it was the result
of the "wormwood mixture," and acted
accordingly. It was only after seve
ral hours' work that Elliott was out of
danger, and to-day he declares that
no traveling doctor will ever sell him
pills apain.
"People should take warning by El
liott's case," said Dr. Jones to-night,
"and be very caroful about taking med
icines from fakers. Had Elliott taken
any more his chances would have been
very slim when I got to his house."

Legislature Must Act.
OAKLAND, Feb. 22.-The committee of
the Board of Education, appointed to in
vestigate the possibility of avoiding the
necessity of teachers and other employes
of the department discounting their sal
ary warrants reported last evening. The
report shows that only by an act of the

Berkeley Landmark Destroyed.
BERKELEY, Feb. 22.â Fire this morn
ing destroyed a building on University
avenue, opposite the Town Wall, belong
ing to J. Casey. "Casey's," as the place
was known, was a resort popular and
patronized in the days before the mile
limit law was vigorously enforced. The
genial host kept a number of goats in his
back yard, and "goat's milk" was dis
pensed over the bar to thirsty Berke
leyans. The place has been unoccupied
for some time and nobody seems to know
how the fire started this morning. When
the firemen arrived no water cou*d be ob
tained and the old landmark was totally
destroyed.

Tools Poison by Mistake.
ALAMEDA, Feb. 22.â Mrs. Martin Pet
ronek of 231G Santa Clara avenue had a
narrow escape from death last evening
about 6:30 o'clock. She had been ill and
was feeling somewhat weak. Thinking
that a little stimulant would do her good
she went to a cupboard where a bottle of
whisky is kept. It was dark and she
could not see the bottle. Nevertheless
she took quite a drink from it. She had
no sooner swallowed the liquid than she
found she had made a mistake and had
taken a big mouthfull of carbolic acid.
Dr. Sander was summoned immediately
and by administering antidotes managed
to save her life, though her throat was
painfully burned by the acid, and she
will be ill for some time.
Football Game.
ALAMEDA, Feb. 22.â The game of foot
ball between the Vampires of this city
and the Oakland Recreation team in this
city this afternoon did not turn out to
be so interesting as was expected. Three

team had things pretty much their own
way. The result was a victory for the
last-named team by a score of 3 to 0.

was some of this wood that caused the
arrest of Do^aM fit" 1 ". b" having tried
to carry it off while the street employes
were cutting it down. No further steps
have been taken by the Cohens to recover
possession of the wood as yet.

WAS A BATTING EXHIBITION.
Will & Fincks Win From the Bueh
nell Alerts by Superior Stick
Work.
Yesterday's game between the Will &
Fincks and the Bushnell Alerts was a
batting exhibition from start to finish, in
which the former team had a shade the
better. Both pitchers were hammered all
over the lot, but the Alerts suffered
through poor fielding. Shea was taken
off first and put in the box and Mob
kimon was moved over to short. That
the maneuver was faulty was seen early
in the game, as Mosklmon Could not play
the important position nor could . Shea
P Knell's work in the bos is showing con
stant improvement and it looks as if the
veteran will continue for a great many
moons Foulter, the new find in ball
circles proved a valuable man to the Will

feeble condition and told a peculiar story
of being drugged and robbed.
Maloney has been for years suffering
from the effects of a paralytic stroke.
Saturday, February 12, he says while
down town he met a Â±riend, Billy Cur
ran, and they went to a saloon on Pine
and Dupont streets, where they met Dan
Crowley and a woman whom he knew
only as Annie. They had two or three
drinks and then ey all went to a lodg

remembers being put to bed, but every
thing is a blank to him "between then
and Tuesday night, when he awakened
and found his vest open and $37 50 miss-

He got home somehow, and since then
he has been suffering from the effects of

said he would do so this morning.

DANCING TO THE
BOOKIES' MUSIC
Five Heavily Played Fa
vorites Slaughtered at
Ingleside.
Briar Sweet Turned Up an
Unexpected Winner of
the Oaks.
Dry, Dull Sport Over a Damp Truck.
The Magical Turn Performed
by Senator B!snd.
A big holiday throng attended the
races at Ingleside yesterday and' was
greeted with a card warped out of all .
semblance erf shape and form. The
*port was musty from beginning to
Â«nd, and little is the wonderment that '
mutterings of legislative interference '
are fluttering through the air. Two
races that had a tinge of class about
them were declared off and in their
Btead were substituted, two ragged af
fairs for "skates." Some of the horses
heavily backed appeared to "blow up"
from spontaneous combustion, while
others relapsed into a feeling of ennui
that was truly refreshing to the "lob
ster merchants." One favorite won
and it was freely circulated about that
It was to be "shooed" in. The most :
disgraceful rendition by any of the
acrobats during the afternoon festivi
ties was that of the Montana horse
Senator Bland, and it goes without ,
saying that if the chestnut son of In
verness ran in the colors of an owner
In debt to some hay and feed merchant
Instead of a wealthy man, he would
have been nibbling grass on the public
highway last night and his owner, an
exile from the game, could have sought
the Supervisors for relief.
After three numbers had been ren- I
dered, the California Oaks for three- j
year-old fillies over one mile and a fur
long, with a guaranteed value of $2000,
was called. It proved more than a
mild surprise. Torsida. the fast filly
owned by "Daggie" Smith, held an ex
sited place in the betting, but cut a
dismal figure in the running, ultimate- ;
ly bringing up a dusty third. Briar
Sweet, the Jennings entry ridden by
Lonnie Clayton, considered by the
Bmart ones nothing more than a sprin
ter, whistled along out in front and ;
never pressed won in a jog from Nap- j
amax ridden out to the last ounce by \
Thorpe. Recreation, the stable com- j
panion of Xapamax, had speed for a !
few panels when she faded away to
nothing. Tom Griffin's filly Martha II
was a starter with Tod Sloan nn her
back; but Ti>d was never given a
chance to imagine himself a contender.
The big coin though was held in re- !
serve to be wagered on the fifth catas
trophe, the seven furlong run. for
which Senator Bland with Conley up \
â¢was such a cordial even money chance. \
When the betting began the bookies
drew a long, straight line opposite the
Senator's name and with a big ax drove
a carpet tack into either end. They got |
the coin- in chunks and bundles, and j
they kept every dollar of it. He was
afflicted with about as much speed as !
a tattooed tramp rushing the growler, j
The track was heavy, which perhaps j
had something to do with his load. At
any rate, Ostler Joe made the running
until nearing the wire, where Willie
Martin got up with Geyser and beat
him out a neck. Howard Mann, the
"sick one" of the party, found no
trouble in taking the show from Johnny
Campbell's charge. The winner re
ceded in the betting from 8 to 5 to 13 J
Jj 5.
Jack Martin, a member of the Texas
light artillery, strolled away with the
opening seven furlnng run at odds of
10 to 1. Hidden by young Stevens, he
headed Chstles A and Schnitz in the
run home and downed the former horse
a head. Spenor. on Schnitz, waited in
the stretch to set his chronograph, or
he might have :.. iÂ«hed closer up than
third. Nothing much seemed to be ex
pected of the favorite. Benamela, and
no one was disappointed when the

brown horse brought up In fourth

The substituted second race was a
six furlong run, whi^h was taken by |
Hermosa, a 10 to 1 shot, ridden by Mr-
Imyre. The outsider won from the j
jump, and won pulling up from George :
Lee. the favorite.
The mile selling event that followed
! was another farcical affair. Stentor,
with "Skeets 1 * Martin in the saddle, ,
was made a warm even money chance
and had no speed whatever. Pat Mur
phy made all the running and passed

ahead of Foremost, with the first
choice third.
Last on the programme came the .
Refugee race. The ring was flooded
nith money to bet on his chances, and ;
everything went according to schedule.
The V.id sprinter, with his baseball bat
' underpinning, was allowed to make his
own pace, and finished pulled up. five |
lengths in front of Red Glenn. His was ;
the one lonely win of a favorite, and :
he had the sympathy of those behind j
I him.

CLOSED THE
TRACK OFFICE.
The Western Union Company Has
Withdrawn the Ingleside
Service.
The Western Union Telegraph Company
has closed its office at the Ingleside
track. The managers of the track wanted
the company to discriminate in the serv
ice given, and the telegraph officials
promptly refused to do so. The fact that
the track officials wanted to prevent any
news being sent out from there has
caused many expressions of dissatisfac
tion. There was no good reason ad
vanced why, if everything was conducted
fairly, the news should not be sent out
after each race. The track people wanted
to shut off all service except to the East. 'â 
and the telegraph company refused to en
ter into any such agreement. The West- :
err. I'nion took the stand that it could not
discriminate between race service and
private messages. The company was per- .
fectly willing to man an office at Ingle
aide "track so long as it could transmit
all the business offered. When it was
suggested that the company only handle
Eastern service and not the local the j
company decided to retire, in justice to
all concerned.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 1898.
HOT BATTLE
OF BALLOTS
Mercantile Library Elec
tion Is Set for
To-Morrow.
Lively Times Expected Through
the Agency of an Oppo
sition Ticket.
A Vigorous and Spicy Campaign
Document Issued by the
Opposing Hosts. Â«
It is evident that the peculiar variety
of time widely advertised for "the old
town to-night" is in store for those
who are to participate in the special
election to be held to-morrow for
the selection of officers for the Mercan
tile Library.
Owing to several palpably irregular
features in the annual election recent
ly held the board of trustees has de
clared that election null and void and
has ordered a special election on the
day mentioned.
The polls will be open from 9 a. m.
until 6 p. m. and from 7 until 8 p. m.
Besides the "regular" ticket, com
posed principally of officers seeking re
election, there is a very lively "oppo
sition" ticket in the field, and this is
the element which promises to supply
the vinegar and spice for the cam
paign. The "opposition" ticket is com
posed as follows: President, Edward E.
Perley; vice - president, Charles G.
Hooker; treasurer, T. R. Bannerman;
recording secretary, Captain E. Dan
iel; corresponding secretary. Miss
Frances Hodgkinson; trusteesâ James
Wightman, Alfred Bouvier, Julius
Kahn A. E. Kellogg, George H. Ca
baniss. William Himmelsbach. F. P.
Deering, Miss Agnes M. Manning and
Miss Rose C. Galiagher.
The â¢opposition" forces have issued,
for the consideration of the library
members, an appeal for the support of
their ticket, which is rather spicy. Af
ter animadverting upon the negligence ;
and ignorance of the old board of trus
tees, as indicated by the mismanage
ment of the election, which was no
election, the document states:
The committee of members, in renomin
ating a ticket for the coming election '
hereby reiterates its arguments against
the reinstatement to office of certain
members of the present board now candi
dates for vindication and re-election. The
continued absence of the recording secre
tary and others, the unfortunate absence
of the president at Klondike for four ,
months, the recent misappropriation of j
nearly $2000 by the ex-librarian and its
total loss by reason of the board's neg
lect to renew his bond; the selling of li
brary property foV $7500, bought a few
days" afterward by the Standard Oil Com
pany for $15,000 in spite of the alleged de- ;
fectlve title; the unpaid bills for books,
papers, coal, gas and consequent impair
ment of the library's credit; the fact that i
the very minutes of the board's meetings
have been kept on scrap paper, read and
approved in bunches of three meetings at ;
a time and at long intervals inscribed in \
the minute book, tell the tale of negli
gence and mismanagement.
Continuing, the appeal pays a flat
tering tribute to the personnel of the
"opposition" ticket and makes very
specific promises of a business-like ad
ministration of the library's affairs in
the event of that ticket's election, sum
ming up thus:
The opposition ticket is a protest against
the past mismanagement of our splendid
library. Its members are not prompted
by motives of personal animosity nor self
interest. It places no blame upon those
members of the board who have striven
to do their duty under adverse circum
stances. It is an honest attempt to infuse
new life into our organizationâ to elect of
ficers pledged to the performance of their
duty to the library and to the mainten
ance and upholding* of its credit and finari
cial honor.
MESSENGERS CALL
ON MRS. STANFORD
Boys Feast and Make Merry
at the Big House on the
Hill.
Each Was Presented With a Bible
and a Box of Candy for
Souvenirs.
Mrs Stanford was "at home" to the
messenger boys at her California-street
house yesterday afternoon, between the
hours of 2 and 5. It was not a formal
function. There was no elaborate decor
ation or any of those accessories that
characterize the functions at which the
groat preside.
It was a simple affair, but there was
that delightful bond of fellowship and
hospitality that only the closest sympathy
between hostess and guests can inspire.
The messengers of the four companiesâ
the Pacific Union, Western Telegraph,
Postal Telegraph and San Francisco
came in squads of seventy-five and spent
as much time as their labors permitted
with the lady who sought to interest and
amuse them.
The boys had their best behavior on,
and were so anxious to put only the
best foot forward that their enjoyment
was of a subdued kind. They only spoke
in whispers and manifested their delight
in the broadest of broad grins. As soon ;
as the boys arrived at the big house on â 
the hill they were ushered into the ball
room, where a feast had been prepared ;
for them. After partaking of all the good ;
things, they made their way to the draw
ing room, "where they were received by
Mrs. Stanford, who thereupon took them
in charge and showed them all the works
of art and many valuable curios with
which the place abounds.
On leaving each boy was presented with
a neatly bound Bible and a box of candy
as souvenirs of the happy occasion. The
boys had arranged it so that all the en
tertaining should not be on one side, and
they entertained their hostess by rousing
choruses and happy solos.
Little Willie Adams, with unusual fore
thought, brought with him a stiff little
bouquet of violets and pansies, which he
presented Mr?. Stanford in a neat speech.
At departure the boys gave three hearty
cheers for the kind hostess.
PUGILISTS IN TRAINING.
Goddard and Jeffries Will Fight in
Los Angeles on Monday Next.
Joe Goddard, the "Harrier" champion,
and Jim Jeffries will box fifteen rounds
before the Los Angeles Athletic Club on
Monday evening, tbe 28th inst.
The Olympic Club has not entered an
objection to Jeffries' fighting before he
fulfills his engagement with Peter Jack
son, as the Olympics are on very friendly
terms with the Los Angeles Athletic Club.
A contest which should attract consid
erable attention will be held this even
ing at the Reliance Athletic Club in Oak
land between Marty McCue and Jimmy
I^awlor.
The clever Australian fighter Tweedie
got his first surprise a few weeks ago at
the Olympic Club when Lawlor put him
to sleep in the second round of their en
gagement. But the local lad will find in
McCue both cleverness and hard punching
Qualities. The boys are booked to fight I
ten rounds and the members of the He- j
| liance Club can safely count upon seeing
one of the best little scraps that has ever ;
: taken place in their gymnasium. The fis
tic appetizer will consist of an eight- ]
round bout between Yank Savage and ',
i Jimmy Riley.
As the contest between Kid Parker and
Fred Muller, which took place in Oakland
recently, did not have a satisfactory end- i
ing owing, it is said, to the rank decision i
! given by Referee Elmer, it is probable ',
! that the Olympic Club of this city will I
offer the fighters inducements to box I
eight rounds as a preliminary to the Jack
son and Jeffries fight, which will take
place next month.
Tommy Ryan is a clever boxer and can
not understand how any man who pre
tends to know anything about the game j
can forget himself so far as to use his
head as a means of self-defense. Last I
; Saturday, when Ryan was boxing with
Baker, the last named pugilist bumped his
gloveless skull into Ryan's mouth, shat
tering two of Ryan's teeth, which were I
extracted on Sunday. The welter-weight
now talks with a lisp, but he says that
the loss of the molars, although disfigur
i ing his mouth somewhat when he yawns,
! does not prevent him from the enjoyment i
; that accrues from a porterhouse steak !
i when properly masticated.
George Dixon, the colored fighter, is cir
! culatlng a report in the East that he was
not accorded a fair show when he fought :
Solly Smith in this city. Smith whipped j
Dixon in good style and desires The Call
to state that if Dixon is anxious for an
; other whipping he can get it any time and
place he names.
FATHER ANDRE VISITS HERE.
He Is a Guest of the Marist Fathers
on Bush Street.
The Rev. Father J. Andree, a secular
priest of the Canadian Church in Minne
apolis, is in this city a guest of the Marist
Fathers at the French Church on Bush
street. He came up from Los Angeles
last week, where he had been to see his
brother, and came up here to spend a few
days.
The Marist Fathers have a branch in
Minneapolis, and it was at their solicita
tion that the reverend gentleman went to
the French presbytery. He is much
pleased with his cordial reception, for ev
erything is being done to make his short
stay a pleasant one.

Professor Bernard Moses Talks on
the Practical Value of
Patriotism.
The Sons of the American Revolution
gave a banquet last night at which 250
guests were present. Covers were laid
for that number, but the Maple Room
of the Palace Hotel, in which the ban
quet was held, was so overcrowded that
some forty guests were obliged to be
seated in the Marble Hall adjoining the
banqueting room.
The tables were prettily decorated,
the color used being pink. At one end
of the Maple Room the insignia of the
order was displayed in due prominence
on the wall, while the Stars and Stripes
formed a fitting background for the
cross of "Liberty and Country."
Before commencing the splendid re
past which had been provided for them
the guests sang two of the most patri
otic songs known to Americansâ
"America" and "Columbia the Gem of
the Ocean." At the first sound of the
orchestra the whole assemblage rose to
their feet as one man and the songs
were sung with intense feeling and
fervor. Among the guests present were":
Mayor Phelan, Hon. Horace Davis,
Professor Bernard Moses, Professor
Lathrop, Rabbi Voorsanger, General J.
H. Dickinson, General G. H. Burton,
Joseph L. Spear, Professor F. M. Wil
liamson, Colonel A. S. Hubbard, Judge
G. N. Fox and S. Prentis Smith.
After the cigars Col. J. C. Currier,
president of the society, made a few
introductory remarks on the Inception
and growth of the Society of the Sons
of the American Revolution. He said
that the society would every year
make its influence felt throughout the
country by the' preservation of Ameri
can traditions, and by stimulating and
fostering a healthy public sentiment
regarding honesty in all departmental
affairs pertaining to the State and to
the country. If a luilthy patriotism is
promoted throughout the ccuntry by
the efforts of the society, it will not
have lived in vain. The Colonel then
proposed a toast to the man who In
his exalted position deserves the sup
port of all true Americans in time of
peace and warâ the President of the
United States.
In responding to the toast, the Hon.
E. F. Preston made a speech which
was greeted as In many ways the
speech of the evening, reaching as it
did an elevated tone that touched a
responsive chord in every patriotic
heart present. He said:
The President of the United States.
The ruler of more than sixty millions of
freemen, vested by the suffrages of the
citizens of the republic with far greater
powers than art- accorded to constitu
tional moiiurchs. When tested by the
number of people, value of the interests
and the geographical area affected, his
powers are vast beyond conception.
Recognized by the cro#ned heads of the
other world as their official equal, the
President of the United States stands
forth without Insignia, decoration or title,
his office illumined by those great truths
upon which the superstructure of our
Government rests, beside which all
hereditary honors and titles pale and be
come Insignificant.
Our sturdy forefathers, who crossed the
sea in search of liberty, brought with
them as part of their very being- those
fundamental principles of human liberty
which were wrung from John by the
barons at Runnymedeâ fit seed to fructify
and bear the fruit of an American re
public. And wh-n they published that
second Magna Charta, the Declaration of
Independence, to the world, humanity
answered with a responsive throb. Se
lecting the colors with which Almighty
God had streaked the sky, they wove
them Into the American flag, and conse
crated it with their blood and their lives.
From this highest order of patriotism
was evolved our form of government,
which to-day remains substantially un
changed. Master minds met in its for
mation. The Federalists, led by the great
Alexander Hamilton, and the Democrats
by Thomas Jefferson, united in devising
a system by which men could govern
themselves. The country was vast, limit
less and unpopulated. The people were
strong in habits of self-reliance, cemented
by the bloody war through which they
had Just parsed. How well they builded
we, their descendants, alone may know.
The sparse population of the narrow strip
of land between the Alleghenies and the
Atlantic Const has extended across the
Mississippi River until it has reached the
Pacific. The stage coach has made way
for the railroad, the great West is dotted
with populous cities and throughout the
length and breadth of the land teeming
millions still look to our institutions and
to our flag with the same reverential af
fection as did our forefathers of old.
However foreign nations may regard us,
however serious they may consider our
political contests, they must always count
upon what they seem to forgetâ the in
tense, unbounded patriotism of the Amer
ican people, a patriotism always willing
to pour forth its treasure and its blood to
maintain the dignity and the honor of the
republic. And in this patriotism and
reverence for our Government lies our
chief safeguard. The ever-Increasing
population of the world is beating upon
stranger shores to find room for an ad
ditional resting place.
The surplus manufacturers are forced
to foreign markets, displacing the do
mestic product and producing an in
evitable financial struggle, the settlement
of which no one may foresee. And the
man who is chosen to guide the destinies
of this great people through all of the
possibilities of the world's complex civ
ilization is engaged in the discharge of
the duties of the highest office known to
modern man.
By the past we may forecast the future.
The people of the United States for more
than a century have, in their selection of
Presidents, proved the possibility of self
government. The roll of chief magis
trates is one unbroken record of high
honor, statesmanship and personal dig
nity. Whatever may have been the po
litical struggle, whatever may have been
the issues upon which he was elected,
the man has always been the President
of the United States, rising above party
dogmas to the full appreciation of his
higher station, while the people in the
same manner have, without regard to
political affiliations, rendered him their
respectful and affectionate support and
homage.
This is the higher type of self-govern
ment. The clouds may lower, but the
tempest will spend Its force In vain bo
long as a united people are of such ma
terlal that they can select from among
themselves for their rulers men who will
not only command their respect and sup
port, but who can in peace or war, at
home or abroad, enforce the respect of
the world to the flag and the nation and
maintain our position of the grandest
republic of freemen upon the eartn.
Colonel Currier then reafl several
telegrams which had been received
from many prominent men regretting
that they were unable to attend the
banquet. Telegrams of greeting were
also numerous, some of them being
from sons of the order whose business
has carried them to reside in Europe.
The principal telegrams received were
the following:
Executive Department, Sacramento, Cal.,
Feb. 16, 1898.
William M. Bunker, Chairman Banquet
Committee "Sons of the American Rev
olution," San Francisco, Cstl.--lJi.-ar Sir:
I am in receipt of th<? Invitation of your
committee to meet with the "Bonn of the
American Revolution" on thÂ«- Â«vf-ningj of
the 22d of February, to celebrate the an
niversary of the birth of Washington
and to renew the patriotic rni-tnorleÃ as
sociated with his name.
I regret exceedingly tIM />Â«rc<:HKlty which
compels me to decline thin invitation, and
hope that in doing so you will permit me
to express a wish that your meeting
proves a success and that your order
finds in it inspiration fur a renewed
growth.
The Revolution gave to thr- world its
greatest nation, an example of the possi
bilities of a free government, conceived
by the principle of equality before the
law, and for themselveH. a successful
government by themselves of a vastly
numerous people, Intent upon the broad
est liberty.
Guided by a discriminating Judgment,
you meet for the purpose of reviving the
memories of our fathers' struggle for in
dependence, on the anniversary of the
birth of the one man who, more than
any other, made possible the success of
the great cause for which they battled.
Washington was the great central figure
of the Revolution. He was the noble
character, around the impersonal
grandeur of which all factions could
gather, where petty strifes were har
monized, and where selfish ambitions
were shamed into inactivity.
Your society, organized from the de
scendants of our forefathers, who con
ceived our Government and realized its
existence, enjoys a splendid inheritance,
to be worthy of which demands of you
the highest standard of citizenship. You
have before you a great work, to take up
the burden of our broadly liberai society
where your fathers have laid it down,
and to carry it on. Your ancestors
achieved a liberty; yours is the obligation
to preserve it. They threw off the yoke
of a monarchy; see that its rule is not
succeeded by that of monopoly. They re
pudiated a nobility created by royal pa
tent: do not substitute for it the odious
aristocracy of wealth. They bequeathed
to us a Government so constituted that
all might participate alike in its privi
leges, should bear in equal proportion its
burdens, and should enjoy the equal pro
tection of its laws. These are the essen
tial principles which lie at the foundation
of our liberties; let these be jealously
guarded as our most sacred heritage.
Your mission is to uphold the constitu
tion, to preserve uncontaminated the prin
ciples asserted by our fathers, and trans
mit them unimpaired to our sons. While
the spirit of Washington, of Jefferson and
of Adams animates the breast of our citi
zenship, our institutions are safe, and we
will pursue our splendid destiny of illus
trating to the world the possibilities of a
free government.
The uneasy fears which at times dis
trusf our confidence in the future should
never dishearten, but should prepare us
to meet and solve the problems of the
future. The insiduous growth of per
nicious principles should be met by the
alert attention of patriotic interest. The
people informed as to their rights will de
mand that they be accorded them. It is
the mission of this country to impose
upon Its citizens an even proportion of
the burdens of its maintenance, and to
equally distribute its privileges; it is the
function of your association to see that
this foundation principle is faithfully ex
ecuted. That you will rise to your re
sponsibilities I confidently predict.
Please permit me to again thank you
for your appreciated invitation, and, with
the hope that your meeting proves the
success your noble purpose deserves, I
remain, yours truly,
JAMES H. BUDD.

BOSTON, Feb. 22. 1898.
William M. Bunker, Esq.â My Dear Sir:
It gives me much pleasure to send across
the continent to the California Society of
the Sons of the American Revolution at
its banquet on the evening of February
22 the heartfelt greeting of the common
wealth of Massachusetts upon the oc
casion which they are commemorating.
The memory of this great son of the
Old Dominion is the equal possession of
all the States of the Union, and has
passed from the custody of the thirteen
original States along the Atlantic sea
board through the mighty valley of the
Mississippi to the States bordering the
Pacific. Distance aiid time only add lus
ter to his great name. Very truly yours,
ROGER WOLCOTT.
Mayor Phelan spoke at some length
on the magnificent patriotism which
has always been displayed by Ameri
can citizens. He said that the coun
try's great population for the most part
lived in cities, and that therefore the
interests and happiness of the people
were better served by a clean and hon
est municipal government than an oc
casional statute passed by Congress.
One of the principal concerns of this
country to-day is municipal reform,
and municipal patriotism is the only
power which can bring this about.
Great laughter was caused by the
Mayor addressing his audience as "la
dies." He, however, deftly turned the
error to account by saying that as
woman is the head of the household,
and households are a major part of
municipal care, the word "ladies"
sprang involuntarily to his lips.
Professor Bernard Moses of the Uni
versity of California then spoke on the
"Practical Value of Patriotism." He
said: "The patriotism I mean is not
that which finds expression in noisy
declamation, nor in such a devotion to
present conditions as to render us
blind and deaf and dumb before the ex
perience of the world. The patriotism
of which I think is a strong, intelli
gent and far-sighted love of country; a
love of country that inspires us to keep
our hands clean of corruption, and our
minds fixed on lofty political ideals;
that moves us to work wisely and con
scientiously for the promotion of the
prosperity, the dignity and the glory
of the nation. It is patriotism of this
sort that constitutes the main element
of civic virtue; and It is only where
this virtue exists that popular govern
ment can be maintained."
The Consul-General for the Pacific
Coast of the French republic was next
introduced to the assemblage by Col
onel Currier. M. de Lalande made only
a short speech, but it drew volleys of
applause from his hearers. He said:
Mr. President and Gentlemen: The rep
resentative for the Pacific Coast of the
republic of France expresses his thanks
for the invitation with which the patri
otic association of the Sons of the Ameri
can Revolution has honored him to-day.
It is more than a hundred years ago
that French officers, whose names have
remained engraven in history and in the
memory of the American nation, fought
valiantly in your ranks for your national
independence. They fought side by side
with your great liberator, George Wash
ington, whose glorious anniversary your
chosen society is to-day celebrating. I
do not think that any other nation's his
tory could present a name that would
shine with greater brilliancy.
Like Individuals, nations also have their
hours of trouble and anxiety and of sad
ness, but these moments pass away, as
also do the hours of triumph. What re
mains and is more lasting Is the con
sciousness which a nation acquires of its
own existence, of Its mission and of its
own dignity. The American people to
day represent one of the most powerful
nations of the world.
Conscious of this, it Is a treat proof

you give to all of your greatness that
when you show to your friends that if
on the one hand you are prompt in
avenging an injustice, on the other you
know how not to forget past services. As
for me, what most particularly appeals
to me, it is your constant and faithful

Rabbi Voorsanger followed the
French consul with a speech on The
Trinity of Political Independence,
which was listened to with great inter-
Warren Olney sent a note expressing
his regret that Illness prevented him
from being able to deliver his speech
which was on the programme with the
title of "Then and Now," and the
president called upon the Rev. Dr.
Theodore C. Williams to speak on the
subject of "The Federation of the
World."
Considerable hissing was the result
of Dr Williams' statement that the
diplomatic service of the United States
in the courts of Europe Is a shame and
a disgrace. American representatives
in other countries have never assumed
the proud position which they were
justified and bound In honor to assume
The speech excited no applause and
did not appear to find favor with the
audience.
An orchestra discoursed sweet music
during the evening and the banquet
was the most successful ever inaug

VETERAN FIREMEN.
They Honor Their New Officers and
the Native Daughters.
Pioneer Hall was crowded on Monday
to its utmost by those who were fortun
ate enough to have received an invita
tion to the ball and banquet given by
the Veteran Firemen's Association in
honor of the installation of the officers
fir the current term and of the Native
Daughters who, on the day after the
Jubilee parade, had entertained the mem
bers of the association.
Of the Daughters there were thirty
three, three from each of the local par
lors, and during the evening they were
specially honored.
From S o'clock until 10:30 there was
dancing in the main hall, and during in
termission Joe Marshall, the retiring pres
ident, was, by Senator Sumner on behalf
of the association, presented with a hand
some gold badge in recognition of the
members' appreciation of him. The old
veteran via; unable to respond, but the
iKippy smile upon his wrinkled face
showed plainly the gratification the p.es
entaUon gave him.
More than 400 persons sat down to the
very fine banquet that had been pro
vided, and it was long after the hour of
midnight before the orchestra played
"Home, Sweet Home."
The affair was under the direction of
John Foley, Joe Satchbill and J. W.
Kenny, the committee of arrangements,
and J. Berolzheim was the floor manager,
aesisted by J. H. Riley, F. Terramore and
B. Barman.
Elevator Boys Strike.
The rumor of a strike of the employes
of the Emporium proved upon investiga*
tlon to be only a strike of tho elevatof
boys employed there. The boys went on
a strike on Saturday night, for what
cause it is not known. The management
secured a lot of new boys and broke them
in on Sunday and Monday morning the
elevators were running as smoothly aa
usual.
