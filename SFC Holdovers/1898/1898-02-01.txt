VOLUME LXXXIII.â NO. 63.
RUSSIA WILL
RAID BRITAIN'S
INDIAN EMPIRE
LONDON. Jan. 31.â There is a startling dispatch in the Daily Telegraph to-day. It comes from SL Pe
tersburg. This paper's correspondent there had an interview with a Russian admiral, now chief of squadron,
and with an eminent Russian â  diplomat. Their declarations, therefore, if true, have semi-official weight. You
must remember that the Daily Telegraph Is not given in general to faking. T.his is what makes the St. Peters
burg dispatch so serious. Practically the declarations it makes amount to a menace from Russia toward Eng
land, that unless England chooses to acquiesce in the policy being pursued by Russia in the far East, war is in
evitable. If this dispatch is not a fake, Russia hi a thrown down the gage. It remains to be seen whether
England will take it up or back down. The dlspatc is, if true, so- important that I send it to you in full:
"I have had a conversation with the Russian admiral who has been appointed to the post of chief of
squadron, concerning the situation In the far East. This officer, in the course of his remarks, said: 'Nearly
the whole of the marine forces of Russia will be dispatched to the far East, for it is necessary for Russia to
place herself in a position of naval strength in Chinese waters equal to that of Great Britain. Russia will not
permit the opening of a new port, either at Port Arthur or at Talien Wan. We shall see that Germany will say
the same thing with regard to Klaochau and the bay of Sara Sa, while France will prevent the opening of the
Siam Gulf and Nankin as free ports. Russia, France and Germany will permit no European power to carry out
such an attempt against their interests upon the pretext of encouraging China-European trade, for under that
condition the power in question would become the real mistress of China, directing both her politics and her
finances.' . .. . â  / . â¢ : ; " .â¢'â -.
*T[ also called upon a celebrated Russian diplomatist, who said: 'The conditions of the loan of 12.000,000
pounds -which Great Britain has offered to the Chinese Government are directed principally against the interests
of Russia and France, and for this reason our Embassador at Peking, together with Ills French colleague, will
struggle to prevent China accepting British overtures. By the opening of Talien as a free port, the value of
Port Arthur as a naval station would be diminished. In the spring Great Britain will no longer occupy her
self with the Chinese question, and will certainly not take the offensive, finding, as sh^ will, the necessity of
devoting her strength and energy to India, where a revolt infinitely more serious than the Sepoy mutiny Is about
to break out. There Russia will be able, without difficulty, to- penetrate through Afghanistan ami the Pa
mirs to the Indian possessions of Great Britain, to whom she will dictate terms. We have enough troops,
and well fortified frontiers with outposts well connected in the rear for our reserves. By railways and tele
graphs we could, in the course of a few days, place upon the Afghan frontier an army of 100,000. men. You per
ceive that all the chances are on our side, and we do not fear the threats of England.' "
CONSTANTINOPLE, Jan. 31.â The j
Russian military cruiser Saratoff, be- '
longing to the Volunteer fleet, with
twelve quick-firing guns and 1600
troops on board, passed the Bosphorus I
yesterday on her way- to Vladivostok.
LONDON, Jan. 31.â 1t Is announced !
on the best authority that the talk of
an Anglo-Japanese plan of campaign j
In certain eventualities is unfounded. !
.No such matter has occupied the atten
tion of the statesmen of the two coun
tries and no agreement exists between
England and Japan except the common
desire to secure the free development
of trade in China.
As regards Port Arthur, the Russian
fleet, according to the same authority.
Is only there for winter quarters, and j
the statement as to a Russian occupa- j
tion are unfounded. China is willing j
that the English warships should an- t
chor there if desired.

PEKING, Jan. 31.â 1t is supposed
that Great Britain's withdrawal from
Port Arthur, and her ceasing to exert
pressure for the opening 1 of the port
of Tfelien Wan, which actions are re
garded as incredible ami suicidal to
British interests and prestige, were
owing to her disbelief in the existence
of a secret treaty between Russia and
China. The Chinese Government, how
ever, quotes this treaty as the reason
for Russia's presence at Port Arthur,
and Russian dispatches to the Tsung

of Port Arthur is In accordance with
the treaty.

GEORGE CLARK TO BE
GIVEN AN EARLY TRIAL
Objects to Pleading on Saturday, on
the Ground That That Is
His Sabbath.
NAPA, Jan. XLâ George W. C!ark, the
St. Helena fratricide, was arraigned in
the Superior Court this morning at 10
o'clock. District Attorney Bell for the
people, and Henry Hogan. C. J. Beer
stecher and E. L. Webber for the do
fense, were all present, the latter pledg
ing his support to the accused to-day.
After consultation and other preliminar
ies Saturday next at 10 a. m. was fixed
as the time for pleading.
Clark objected to the date, contending
that Saturday was his Sabbath, but his
objection was ignored. It is commonly
believed that the court will permit very
little delay in the trying and sentencing
of this monster.

"in this matter of a canal across our :
country.- The canal company has not '
lived up to the obligations included in
the concession, and we consider that It
has deceived us and we believe, that |
further dealing with it would only re
sult in further deception. For this rea
son we. would prefer: dealing directly
with your Government, knowing that it Is
stable, which the canal company is not. j
"We consider that the concessions which
are now held by the ranal company ex
pired some time since, and that they
are therefore void, although the canal
company think differently. The Tipo
tapa canalization is one of the most
striking illustrations of the failure of
the company to keep its agreements and
one of the chief features made with
Mr. Baker, the retired United States
Minister, dealt with this vory matter.
We have no objection to the Congress
of the United States passinga bill look
ing to the support of private capital in
building the canal, but when it came to
the United States actually controlling
the canal this government would have
something to say about that. But in
the event of a possible transfer of con
trol the matter could be discussed by
this government and the United
States."
"Would the concession granted to the
Atlas Company interfere at all with
the operation of the canal?"
"Not at all. The concession was
granted to the company for navigation
rights of the San Juan River, and it is
not such as to retard the construction
of the canal. This government took
good care in granting that concession
that it should be such as not to lead to
any international complications."
CENTRAL AMERICAN INTRIGUES
In the Event of War They Would
Have Some Bearing on the
Nicaragua Canal.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Jan. 31.â A Mexi
can paper of recent date contains an
; interview with a recently returned
traveler from Honduras, who gives a
detailed inside history of the intrigues
i of some of the Central American re
i publics. These intrigues are generally
! of no Interest to the world at large,
but in view of the recent mysterious
workings of an American syndicate in
Honduras, and the possibility of war
! affecting the Nicaraguan canal, they
are of importance. The interview
says in part:
"In the present affair the dispute be
tween Costa Rica and Nicaragua is
much more serious, as it affects the
sovereignty over the line of the so
1 called Nicaragua oanal. Costa Rica
may count upon the energetic support
I of many Hondurans, for there is a bit
i ter grudge on the part of a certain
section of the people of Honduras to
| ward the present Government of Nicar
agua. General Domingo Vasquez, the
Honduran soldier of fortune, proposes,
'â¢if successful, to depose the present
i President of Nicaragua, Zelaya, and
then, with a friend in his place, pass
; through the country and enter Hon
! duras.
"Bonilla will be overthrown and Vas
quez will' again assume the power for
; which he played and lost in the chance
of battle. This will ..have an interest
ing bearing from an American point of
view. Boniila, now President of Hon
duras, has recently granted to an
American syndicate a concession of
such magnitude that the country has
practically passed into the hands of the
' syndicate, which has power to collect
taxes and pay the liabilities of the Gov
ernment's army and civil service. The
syndicate is practically the receiver for
. the entire republic. It is said that the
Vanderbilts are the leading capitalists
interested in this syndicate. No such
important concession was ever before
granted unless it was by the British
Government to the Great East India
Company. Some of the erreatest capi
talists in the States are In this syndi
cate.

YOUNG MITCHELL ACCUSES
SUPERVISORS OF CORRUPTION.
My refusal to be shaken down in the Walcott-Lavigne fight was
the straw that broke the camel's back with the Board of Supervisors. I
do not want to appear as a kicker, or to show undue feeling or spite,
but the Committee on Health and Police, of which Captain Delany is
the chairman, is raw in his work. I have refused to be shaken down.
Ned Lanigan is broker for Delany, Rivers, Haskins and Devany, or he
claims to be. Silence on my part is no longer golden. Haskins asked
for $250. I did business with him personally, after he had been rubber
necking about my place, but I would not trust him or his committee out
of sight, and would not pay until they had delivered the goods. As
they did not deliver the permit, they did not get the money.

DESTITUTION
ON COAST OF
NEWFOUNDLAND
Hundreds of Men, Women and
Children Dying From Exposure
and Starvation, and Many
Vessels Locked in the Ice.
NEW YORK, Jan. 31.â The Red
Cross line steamship Portia arrived to
day, four days overdue, from St.
Johns, N. F., and Halifax, after a des
perate encounter with pack-ice off the
Newfoundland coast. Sne brings a har
rowing tale of blizzards and destitu
tion in the coast section of that coun
try.
Hundreds of men, women and chil
dren dead and dying from exposure
and starvation, with ab'ur.clance cV>s*
by and hundreds more threatened with
a like fate, are the conditions reported
by the Portia.
The Portia was penned in by huge
Arctic floes in plain sight of St. Johns,
unable to move, and finally man
aged to escape by the merest accident.
Many other craft, several of them re
lief vessels sent by the Canadian Gov
ernment to succor destitute fishermen,
had to abandon their errands of mercy
and return to St. Johns, where they
were still in the ice when the Portia
struggled into clear water.
Close to where the Portia lay the big
steamship Virginia was locked tight.
She had been sent north by the Cana
dian Government with food for the
starving fishermen, but a short dis

ARRANGING FOR THE
MOHICAN'S VOYAGE
There Is No Diplomatic Significance
in the Proposed Visit to
Samoan Islands.
"WASHINGTON, Jan. 31.â The Navy
Department Is about to arrange the itin
erary of the coming 1 cruise of the Mohi
can with her crew of apprentices, through
the islands of Oceanica, and particularly
to Samoa. The vessel Is expected to start
the last of February and to occupy eight
months on the cruise. An effort is mak
ing to increase the number <,i apprentices
on the vessel from sixty to 150, which will
give her a full complement. Probably the
first stop will be made at Honolulu, and
then the Fanning Islands, half way from
Honolulu to Samoa. The vpssel will not
stay long In Samoan waters, but it is
expected will return to Mare Island by
way of the Society Islands. There is said
to be no diplomatic significance in the
voyage beyond a desire on the part of the
State Department to avail itself of
this opportunity to show the American
flag on a warship In Samoa in partial
payment of an obligation imposed on the
United States to take turns with Great
Britain and Germany in keeping a man
of-war among the islands.
MUST ACCEPT GEORGE
AS GOVERNOR OF CRETE
But in Making This Concession the
Turks Will Be Less Disposed to
Evacuate The3saly.
NEW YORK, Jan. 31.â A dispatch to
the Commercial Advertiser from London
says: There is an Impression here that
the Sultan In the end will be compelled
to accept Prince George as Governor of
Crete. It Is strong enough to provoke
discussion of the consequences, namely,
that the Turk, with Mohammedan feel
ing aroused, will be less disposed than
ever to evacuate Thessaly, and that the
Balkan states, already disturbed and
restless, will be likely to ask compensa
tion for Greece's virtual gain of Crete.
The European concert, as to the near
east, is temporarily dissolved, with Ger
many and Austria on one side and the
other powers on the other, but it Is not
beyond re-establishment. The Greelfs are
likely to be calmer and more content
with the dynasty, but there are fears of
worse than the existing anarchy for a
time In Greece, with the Turks clustered
about Canea and jealous Cretan clan
chiefs ready to provoke disorder.

j sor Delany's committee is as rotten a
I body as the city has ever tolerated in
politics. â¢
"They wanted me to shake down for
| $500 on the Walcott-Lavigne fight,"
said Herget, "and Ned Lanigan was the
j broker .who came to me and said I
j would have to do right by 'the boys,"
meaning the Supervisors. We agreed
on $500, but I never paid it because
| they did not send a collector whose
{Â credentials I was sure of. I had the
money ready, but nobody, came to me
to 'do business,' and I was determined
not to chase them. I felt this after
ward when I wanted other permits."
â¢ According to Mitchell's story there
was a great deal of hard feeling on the
part of Messrs. Delany, Haskins, Riv
ers and Devany because the $500 did not
materialize, so when Mitchell applied
for a permit for the Griffo-Lavigne
fight he decided to' do business with the
crooked Supervisors in person. His '
story of this is startling, and, if true,
shows a monstrous state ;of political
corruption. He says:
"I called on Haskins, who had been â 
rubber-necking around my place, and I
| asked him what the Griffo fight would
cost me. He said, after some haggling,
that it would cost $250, and I agreed.
I offered a check, but he demanded the
money. I went out to the board with
the money, which I showed to some
of my friends. Haskins tried hard to
get it, but I always said: 'No permit,
no money; show me . the permit first,'
but he did not show it. . He said every
thing would be all right on the follow
ing Monday. I told : him I would not
trust the board out of my sight. While
this talk was going on the other mem
bers were walking ahead of us. The
result was I was knocked out of the
fight. I never got the permit. I . was
told to fix the matter with Lanigan,
but I could not see it their way. I
wanted to have my permit first."
The last chapter of the disgraceful
story came to light yesterday. Mitchell
had a permit hanging fire for the
Jackson-Maher fight, but he has failed
to get any satisfaction.
; "They lost my permit in the shuffle,"
he said, "and there is probably no -
chance that <; it will ever be obtained.
The . reason is the fact that they have
not been able to 'shake me down' and
they are sore on me and : my fights.
. "All the fights are going to the Em
pire ; and r the ; National : clubs :' and
Brother i Groom has been shaken down
good and hard to get what he has ob
; tamed. . This Committee on Health and
Police is not in business for its health,,
but for what it will pay. Lanigan
makes no bones about being broker for ;
Haskins, 1 ; Delany, Devany and Rivers. \
It is about the rawest play for money ;
that I ever saw. ; If the committee had
sent the right man all would have been
well.
"When I agreed to pay Haskins $250
I suggested that I would bring a check
for that amount to the board at the
date agreed upon. He said, 'Don't you
bring any check near here, but come
here with the money. We don't want
to deai with any checks or with any
thing but spot cash,' "
Mitchell is not making his entire
fight at once, for he says he still has
more cards up his sleeve to be used if
necessary. He has no faith in the in
tegrity of the committee or the honesty
of the methods now in vogue with the
body that has in charge matters of
health and police.2
HAS NO POLICE
TRIBUNAL NOW
Sacramento Deprived of
This Branch of the
Judiciary.
Judge Hart Renders His De
cision Declaring It Non-
Existent.
Culprits Who Have Been Fined or
Imprisoned Will Now Seek
Redress.
cp=,-!al Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 31.â As was
published exclusively in The Call thi3
morning. Judge Hart filed his opinion
to-day which deprives Sacramento of a
Police Court. About the only people
who find a solace in Judge Hart's de
cision are those serving terms in the
County Jail under a sentence passed
upon them by this defunct Fountain of
Justice. The legal striplings of the
town are preparing an onslaught
against Sheriff Johnson's boarding
house, and the probabilities are that
before to-morrow's sun shall set every
hobo who has received his sentence
.â om this play court will be liberated
through the constitutional gateway of
habeas corpus.
Those who have taken advantage of
the ever existing alternative during
the last two years, are wondering what
process of law will restore to them the
lines they have paid, and, from those
grand old citizens who have paid the
penalty of maintaining poor sidewalks,
to the humpbacked scorcher who has
been fined for fast riding, there is a
Oonoertcd movement to procure a re
turn of the moneys illegally forced from
their unwilling pockets. Taking it all
in all it is rather a serious state of af
fairs and much uncertainty exists as
to the real status of the recently elect
ed Police Clerk and City Attorney.
Following is the substance of Judge
Hart's opinion:
Petitioner was tried and convicted in
what was claimed to be the Police Court
of the city of Sacramento, during the
month of Jury. 1897, of the offense of vio
lating ordinance No. 430 of said city, and
â was adjudged to pay a fine of $2uo, or, in
default of the payment of each fine, to
be Imprisoned one day for each and every
dollar of said fine, to wit: for the period
of 200 days. An appeal was taken from
Bald judgment to the Superior Court ot
Bacramento County and. after the hear
ing thereof by said court, the judgment
ftguinst petiti'on^r was affirmed or. the
37th day of January. ISSS. In support of
hie application for a writ of habeas! cor
pus the petitioner presents the following
as grounds for his discharge:
Firstâ That the judgment is void, be
cause the entire proceedings were had in
tin alleged court having no legal exist
ence
Secondâ lf it be concerted that the judg
ment is not void for tin- above reason, the.
sentence imposed upon petitioner is void
because in excess of jurisdiction of the
court.
The complaint upon which the petition- j
cry/asr v/as pr- r aa sworn to before I
one E. C. Rutherford, who styled himself !
the "Clerk of the Police Court of, in, and j
for said city of Sacramento." and the
title of the court alleged in said complaint j
13 as follows: "State at California, Coun- â 
ty of Sacramento, in the Police Court of |
the City of Sacramento, in said county, j
before ' Hon. GtrurgeG. Davis, Police
thereof:" â  ' â  â  .'
The present charter of tho city of Sac
ramento was approved i.y the Legislature i
on February 7. 1Â«Â», by a concurrent reso
lution, and went into effeci on the Sth day |
of January. 181*4. Prior to the adoption of i
this charter there existed in this city a i
Police Court, which was created by an i
act of the Legislature of 1563-64. and the
jurisdiction thereof established by an
nmenclatory act approved March 2.1, IS7S.
The present constitution expressly pro- j
Dibits any such legislation.
The question now arises as to whether
or not the proceedings, resulting in the
conviction and imprisonment of the peti
tioner, having been had before a person
clothed with the authority and exercising
the functions of a legally constituted tri
bunal to wit: The office of City Justice,
was coram judice. notwithstanding the
fact that all the papers, processes and
records in said cause purported to have
Issued from and were of and in a non
existing court.
The complaint in the case of the peti
tioner was verified before a person who
claimed to be clerk of the Police Court.
The complaint and the proceedings had
thereunder purported to have been filed
and to have taken place in the Police
Court. The transcript on appeal was cer
tified to by a person claiming to be clerk
of the Police Court. Of course there can
be no clerk of a court having no exist
ence and there i.= , therefore, no such an
officer as clerk of the Police Court in this
city; but. as I have heretofore stated, the
charter does not attempt to create a Po
lice Court by express terms nor does it
attempt to create a clerk of a Police
Court. It simply provides, in effect, that
the City Justice, upon whom it shall be
come incumbent (having jurisdiction to
do so under tho general law) to perform
the duties which the law creating the
Police Court, existing before the ad"-tion
of the chartr-r. cxpn-sslv invested i.. jch

provision (Sec. 62) provides that he shall
be designated the "Clerk of the Police
Court," such designation amounts to no
thing and cannot authorize the perform
ance by him of duties pertaining- to a non
existing tribunal. Under the provisions
of the charter he is simply a clerk of the
city Justice of the Peace.
lam of the opinion that the Legislature
had no right, by concurrent resolution,
to invest the chief executive officer of the
municipality with power of naming any
Justice of the Peace of the county to take
the place of a city Justice of the Peace.
The general law concerning city Justice?
of the "Peace provides among other things
that "No person shall be eligible to the
office of Justice of the Peace in any city
having over 15,000 Inhabitants who has
not been admitted to practice law in a
:ourt of record." And I think that when
a Justice of the Peace is called upon for
any reason authorized by law to preside
In the court of a city Justice of the Peace
he must possess such qualifications of
such city justice as are prescribed by the
general law.
It follows that nt the time of the trial
and conviction of the petit ionor there was
not, nor Is there now, puch a tribunal as
a "Police Court" existing in the city of
Sacramento, and, hence, the proceedings
aerainst petitioner were void and he must,
therefore, be discharged.
FUEL FOR TORPEDO BOATS.
Navy Department Decides Upon Oil
After Thorough Experiments.
WASHINGTON', Jan. 31.â The Navy
Department has decided to adopt oil as
fuel for torpedo-boats. Its advantages
over coal have been proved in recent ex
periments at New York with the Stiletto.
Rnd authority has- been asked by the
6pecial board conducting the trials to fit
Dut'this boat permanently with necessary
appliances. It is suggested further that
some new torpedo-boats now building be
equipped with similar apparatus.
The caloric power of oil over coal was
3emonstrated on one of the trials of the
Stiletto, when it was shown that a ton
of coal would run the vessel about
twenty-eight miles, while a ton of oil
tvould enable her to steam fifty-six miles
at the same rate. The steaming radius
Df torpedo-boats will almost be doubled
oy the introduction of oil, which, in addi
tion, occupies less space than An-
Dther advantage is that there is no waste
and no danger of spontaneous combus
tion. The introduction of oil on these
boats* will not lead to the abandonment
Df coal entirely, us by a simple arrange
ment the oil feed gear can be removed
and the use of coal resumed without se
rious delay.
WATER WORRIES
THE SAILORMEN
Fear the Kentucky Will
Be but an Unlucky
Ship.
Where the Custom of Christen
ing Vessels With Wine
Comes From.
Has a Significance Which Appeals
Particularly to the Warriors
of the Sea.
Special Dippatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Jan. 31.
The officers of the Navy on duty here
are very much perturbed over Miss
Bradley's announcement that she will
use water in christening the battle-ship
Kentucky, and express considerable
worry over the practical effect of such
i a departure from precedent.
"This intention of Governor Bradley's
: daughter may not strike landsmen as
| anything more than a good joke on a
\ State that has always been represented
i as a hard-drinking community," said
I one officer to-day, but it may re
sult badly for the navy. Not a man
in the service will feel a ray of com
fort in sailing in a ship that has been
baptized in water. As for myself, I
think no sailor with good red blood in
his veins can approve of any such dis
regard of the conventional method.
"Mark my word, if water is used in
the ceremony, the Kentucky will be an
unlucky boat, or known as an unlucky
boat, which is much the same thing.
She'll be a regular Friday boat in the
mind of every sailorman. She may not
come to any grief, but she will have a
half-hearted crew. The crew should
take pride in their ship. They will go
into action in the Kentucky, if war
should come in her time, just like a
man with a cracked gun or a broken
sword.
"This thing of baptizing ships with
wine has a significance that is only un
derstood by men who follow the sea.
The custom comes from the old Vik
ings, who dashed a cup of wine over
the bows of the stanch boats in which
they traversed the ocean. People may
say it is indecent to use wine in the
ceremony of baptizing ships. For my
part, I believe it more sacrilegious to
use water. I need not explain why.
The Kentucky will be the home of her
crew, and I tel! you the interests of the
service demand that shf> shall go into
the water in the good old way."
KILLED A BRIDE OF
SEVENTEEN DAYS
Juan Orosco of Lamanda Park Ar-
rested on p Charge of Murder
ing His Wife.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 31.â Juan Oros
co of Lamanda Park was arrested to
night charged with the murder on last
Tuesday of Modesta, his bride of seven
teen days. Mrs. Orosco's dead body was
found in the bedroom of her home on
Allen's ranch with a bullet hole in her
breast. The coroner's jury returned a
verdict of death from a self-inflicted
wound, but left the question of suicide
or accident an open one. Pedro Le
nares, brother of the dead woman,
learned from a Mrs. Neblino, who lives
near the Orosco house, that the hus
band was seen to go Into the house on
the morning of the wife's death and re
main there ten minutes. While he was
there she heard a shot and later she
saw him go away. Lenares swore to
the complaint charging Orosco with
murder.
SUICIDE OF A
TRAIN-WRECKER
After Making a Confession in Jail,
Henry Goettell Hangs Himself
With a Towel.
ST. AUGUSTINE. Fla., Jan. 31.â Henry
Goettell, a German baker, after making a
confession to the Sheriff that Herman
Breetz and himself had wrecked a pas
senger train near Rivera, on the Florida
coast, last Tuesday night, committed sui
cide by hanging himself with a towel in
the jail early this morning. Breetz, who
occupied the same cell, also attempted to
kill himself, but was unsuccessful.
After wrecking the train, the amateur
wreckers lost their nerve and ran. It was
their purpose to hold up the passengers.
CAPTAIN JEFFS
MUST RETIRE
Resigns the Leadership of the
Stanford Baseball
Team.
Suffering From Injuries Received, in
thÂ© Thanksgiving Day Football
Game.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PALO ALTO, Jan. 31.â That which those
on the inside of baseball most feared be
cause of the effects it might have on
the Stanford baseball team, occurred to
day, when Captain Jeffs resigned his po
sition. The step could not be avoided,
for the injured knee which Jeffs has been
suffering from since the Thanksgiving
football game is in such shape that Dr.
Wood decided last night that it would be
impossible for Jeffs to play this season.
After the operation which Jeffs had per
formed to remove the water whtch had
accumulated on his knee it was thought
he would be ab.e to take his old place
behind the bat and captain his team.
Overexertion In coaching the men during
this week's practices has made imme
diate recovery impossible.
Captain Alexander Jeffs is one of the
best men Stanford has ever had on the
team. He began to play In his freshman
year, and has never ceased to star. Jmis
position is that of catcher. Besides
weight, strength and quickness, he Is a
general, and uses his head. In batting he
led the list last season. As a football
player he is known as the clever end of
the '95. '96 and '97 Varsities.
Loughead, the shortstop, will act as
temporary captain. I'oe most likely
among the possible candidates for captain
are Strohn, Toung and Loughead. jelfs'
resignation will probably send C. Strohn
behind the bat, leavinp third base open.
Barred From Stockton Schools.
STOCKTON, Jan. 31.â Judge Rudd this
morning gave a decision in the case of J.
N. Southrej' against the city, which par
tially decides the school question here.
Four or five hundred children from the
outlying districts have been attending
school in the city for the past five years
by virtue of contracts which a former
school board had no right to make. The
city board last fall shut down on the
practice and suit was brought to compel
them to admit the children. Judge Budd
holds to the opinion of the City Attorney,
and after the close of the present year all
will be excluded. They are now attend
ing pending the decision to-day rendered.
THE SAX FBANCTSCO CALL, TUESDAY, FJSBKUARY J, 1898.
CHIEF OF POLICE DWYER OF SACRAMENTO.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 31.â Thomas Dwyer was confirmed as Chief of Po
lice by unanimous vote of the City Trustees to-night.
Thomas Dwyer enjoys the distinction of being the youngest man everap
pointed or elected to that important trust. Mr. Dwyer was born in Sydney,
Australia, but he came to California at an early age and has resided in
Sacramento City ever since. Mr. Dwyer is 33 years old. Fifteen years of his
career have been in the employ of the Southern Pacific Company in Sacra
mento.
Chief Dwyer is a man of family. While this is his first political venture,
he has always taken a deep interest in the political affairs of others, and
his appointment by Mayor Land and confirmation by the Trustees is no
doubt the result of a solicitude on the part of an army of friends who have
taken this opportunity of showing their gratitude for favors received from
Thomas Dwyer in the past. The appointment is a popular one, and the
many friends of Mr. Dwyer look forward with sanguine hopes for his fu
ture.

Great Boon to Stockmen in
Southern Monterey
County.
Their Herds Have Been Decimaied
Because of the Lack of
Pasturage.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALINAS, Jan. 31.â Cattle are dying
in large numbers in the southern end
of Monterey County. There is practi
cally nothing for the animals to eat in
that locality until to-day's rain gave
hope of relief, and all of the stock
raisers who have any pasturage else
where have been endeavoring to move
their livestock before it all perished.
Twelve carloads came through Salinas
on Saturday afternoon's freight, bound
for the Henry Miller ranch near Gil
roy, where they will be fed on beet
pulp. The cattle seemed in a bad state
of exhaustion, and in fact were all that
were fit to be shipped out of a herd of
3000. Even when the train pulled out
of Salinas most of the cattle were lying
down in the cars, not being able to
stand. When the freight reached Cas
troville the whule trainload of stock
was practically useless, and out of the
entire twelve carloads there were not
more than ten animals on their feet.
In some places in the lower end of this
county oak trees have been cut down
so that the livestock could subsist on
the leaves and moss until rain came.
STOCKTON, Jan. 31.â Rain indica
tions were seen early this morning,
and light showers fell during the day.
This evening there was a light shower,
but the southeast wind promises a
good rain. Farmers are looking anx
iously fora soaking downpour, although
the young grain can hold out two
weeks longer without moisture.
FRESNO, Jan. 31.â The indications
have been favorable for rain during
the day. but only traces have fallen.
The outlook is stiH favorable for the
badly needed downpour.

and a few drops of rain have fallen.
The clouds are threatening. High
mass was said at St. Joseph's Church
this morning; for rain.
CHICO. Jan. 31.â Long needed rain
began falling here at 7 o'clock this
evening. Farmers are jubilant, as the
crops were needing rain badly.
SANTA ROSA, Jan. 31.â Sonoma
County was to-day visited by a rain
which promises to be of inestimable
value to the farmers. Grain has been
suffering badly and all other farm
products show the effects of the
drought, but if the present storm con
tinues for a few days little damage will
result from the long dry spell. The
ground is very dry at present, but the
farmers throughout the county are re
joicing over the prospects of a con
tinued downpour. It is raining quite
heavily to-night and the sky is black
with clouds.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 31.â Rain be
gan falling slightly here this evening
and is still coming down at midnight.
Reports from the country are that the
crops are in excellent condition, though
a little backward, though they could
stand two weeks more of dry weather,
but fortunately will not have to.
YUBA CITY, Jan. 31.â Rain begnn
falling here this afternoon at 5 o'clock.
The weather is warmer and prospects
are good for continued showers. Farm
ers need rain and warm weather for

VICTORIA, Jan. 31.â 1t is reported
here to-night with an appearance of
probability that the operations of the
British fleet in the neighborhood of
Coquimbo during the next few weeks
will be of more than ordinary interest.
The cruiser Leander left for there on
Saturday, and the flagship will follow
in a couple of days. It is believed that
the acquisition of territory with a view

pitching straw from the mow. There was
no mark on the body and his family is of
the opinion that death was caused by a
stroke of apoplexy.

JUDGE BUDD ON
CHURCH RIGHTS
Says Ecclesiastical Bodies
Must Regulate Thercw

May Not Resort to Law tc
Compel Obedience to
Their Rules.
Suit Brought to Close a House of
Worship Is Decided. Against
the Plaintiff.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, Jan. 31.â Judge Budd, in
giving his ruling on the demurrer inter
posed against Attorney Brinkley's com
plaint on "ecclesiastical outlawry,"
throws the case out of court, and in
effect tells the attorney to appeal to
heaven. Brinkley demanded that the
court revoke the license of a colored
brother to preach; that the church be
closed, and that it otherwise be madt.
to feel the vengeance of the secular
law, 1 because the members were not
Christians and had not lived up to Bap
tist law.
Brinkley is a colored preacher who
got a license from the Supreme Court,
and his first attempt at practice of law
was to go after an offending church ia
a complaint which he indorsed as "ec
clesiastical outlawry." The decision Is
of some interest aside from this, as it
discusses the standing of religious cor
porations.
Judge Budd says that a question not
raised by the demurrer must be con
sidered by the court, and that is
whether the court has jurisdiction of
the principal subject matter of this ac
tion. It is the policy of our laws that
the free exercise and enjoyment of re
ligious profession and worship without
discrimination or preference shall be
granted In this State. No one church,
however, can make rule/ for another
and independent church, nor for the
discipline of such other members.
When a number of churches of the
ame denomination are united in one
association of churches, such associa
tion can be incorporated. If the Second
Baptist Church has been admitted Into
the Western Association, then the dis
cipline of that church and of its mem
bers for a want of compliance with the
rules of that association is for that as
sociation, and not for the secular
courts.
The principles stated in the com
plaint as those which should govern
Christians in their intercourse with
each other, and members of one church
with another, are most commendable,
says the court, but the ordinary code of
justice cannot interfere with any de
parture from the rules indicated by
such principles. The matter must be
heard and determined by ecclesiastical
tribunals established by churches fur
that purpose, and ultimately by a tri
bunal much higher than any earthly
one.
ONLY LEAKY TUBES.
Magnified Reports of Damages to
the Indiana's Boilers.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 31.â A good deal
of amusement was excited among offi
cials of the Navy Department at the at
tempt being made to convey the impres
sion that the fine battleship Indiana had
suffered some severe and dangerous
breakdown while on the way south re
cently through the failure of her boilers.
As a matter of fact the extent of the
mishap was the leakage of one or two
tubes in the boiler, an event so insig
nificant and of such frequent occurrence
on all kinds of steamships that Admiral
Sicard made only a passing reference to
it as an explanation of why he took the
Indiana in tow for six hours to prevent
her from delaying the progress of the
remainder of the squadron. Otherwise
the matter would not have been called
to the attention of the department, save
in one of the monthly reports.
SENATOR MURPHY CENSURED
Resolution in the New York Legis-
lature Asking His Resignation.
ALBANY, N. V., Jan. 31.â Assemblyman
Week â¢ of New York City startled the
Assembly and its 2000 spectators to-day
by the introduction of a resolution cen
suring and requesting the resignation of
Edward Murphy Jr., senior United States
Senator from this State, for voting 1 for
the Teller silver resolution. The resolu
tion was a complete surprise. It brought
to their feet a number of members of the
minority with objections. They could not
object to the introduction of the resolu
tion, but they signified their intention to
debate the proposition, and, under the
rules of the House, it had to go over to
be printed.
Assemblyman Weeks stated that he
was willing that it be laid aside, with the
understanding that it was to be made a
special order at S:3O o'clock next Monday
evening. This course was pursued.
NECESSITY OF
FENDERS IGNORED
Supervisors Postpone Their
Decision for What
Purpose ?
Are They Waiting^ for Their Price
Before Reaching a. Con
clusion?
The sad details of the death of 2
year-old Hulda Johnson, whose young
life was crushed out under the wheels
of the Juggernaut on Sunday and
which appeared in yesterday's Call,
aroused the righteous indignation of
the community yesterday.
Notwithstanding the fact that an
. other victim was added to the already
long list of victims, yet the Supervisors
'esterday completely ignored the im-
portant question. It would seem that
they have lost all regard for their fel
low men, and that the only way to
make them feel the necessity of such
a humane invention would be the
maiming of some relative or dear
friend of their own by the fenderless
cars.
A great deal of blame has been thrown
upon the railroad companies for not
adopting some sort of fender. From inter
views had yesterday li was learned that
they were perfectly willing to adopt one,
but held back for fear that the Supervis
ors might say to them after they had
equipped their cars at great expense that
another fender had been adopted by them
as the proper one for use on street rail
roads. This reason alone stops them from
equipping their cars.
Why don't the Supervisors settle the
matter? Are they waiting for their price?

SITKA, Alaska, Jan. 21.â The Nowell
Gold Mining Company, next to the ;
Treadwell, is, with all its stamp mills
and properties, the largest gold min
ing concern in Alaska. Owing to al- |
leged mismanagement the company re
cently went into the hands of a re
ceiver. The employes of the Berners
Bay Mining and Milling Company, one
of the Nowell Company's best proper
ties, refused to surrender it to the re- j
ceiver, and at one time it looked as i
though the United States troops at i
Sitka might be called upon to enforce j
the decree of the United States District
Court c-f Alaska by assisting Receiver
E. F. Cassel to gain possession of the
property. The court adjudged the em
ployes in contempt and a deputy United
States Marshal has gone to Berners
Bay to make a formal demand for the
surrender of the mine. The latest i
news from Berners Bay is that the dif
flculty is in a fair way to peaceable
adjudication without resort to force of
arms. Boston, New York and San
Francisco capital is interested in the
Nowell Gold Mining Company.
Receiver Cassel has just made a pre
liminary report of the liabilities and
assets of the company to the court.
The assets show real estate, mining
and mill site, claims and improvements
thereon, including development work
and equipment, of $3,431,070 85. This
amount represents the cost to the com- !
pany of the property, of which amount !
52,500,000 is represented by the capital ;
stock of the company Issued in pay- ;
ment for certain mining properties ;
transferred to the company. The t>al- ''
ance of the total amount, $931,070 85. is I
apparently the actual amount of money
expended in developing and improving
the property. None of the foregoing
figures can be taken as representing
the present actual value of either the \
property or the improvements. Cash, |

DEFIED BY HER
COUNCILMEN
Request Made by the Mass=
Meeting of Citizens
Ignored.
Officials Decline to Warn the
Water Company Regarding
the Making of Needless.
Improvements.
These resolutions the Los Ange les City Council permitted to die
for want of a second:
Resohed, That the City Attorney be and he Is hereby directed to
draw up In legal form a notification to the Los Angeles City Water
Company that further improvements placed upon its system between
this time and the 22d of July, 189 8, beyond what are absolutely neces
sary for the maintenance of the said system until the expiration of the
lease of the said company, would not accord with the plan of the water
system for the municipality as outlined by the City Engineer.
Resolved. That the City Clerk be and he is hereby directed to for
ward this notice to the Los Angeles City Water Company at once
LOB ANGELES, Jan. 31.â The people j
of Lob Angeles are again brought forci- j
bly face to face with the proposition j
that if they obtain anything from the j
present City Council which will facili- |
tate the acquisition by the municipal- j
ity of the plant now operated by the j
water company they will simply have
to hammer it out. It is again made j
very plain that the Council is going j
to do nothing of its own free will and
volition that savors of business meth- '
ods in pushing negotiations between
the municipal corporation on the one
hand, and the private corporation an
the other. Members of the Council
who have up to date done the very .
thing at the very time that was de
sired of them by the water monopoly I
stand around in the City Hall lobby
and prate about what they are going
to do, or are willing to do for munici
pal ownership, and then, when the
time comes for them to vote in the City
Council, they do the very thing and
vote the very way that the City Water
Company desires them to. Then they j
object to being referred to as oppos- i
ing municipal ownership and as act- j
ing in the interest of the water com
pany and not in the Interest of the {
people. If they do not receive sub- j
star.tial recognition from the private j
corporation f or the' service they ren- â¢
der. the consensus of public opinion is j
that they ought to. !
To-day Councilman E. L. Hutchison
offered the following resolution to the j
Council:
Resolved. That the City Attorney be
and is hereby directed to draw up in
legal form a notification to the Los An
geles City Water Company that further
Improvements placed upon Its system.be-,
tween this time and the 22d of July, 1895.
beyond what are absolutely necessary for
the maintenance of the said system until
the expiration of the lease of the said
company, would not accord with the plan j
for the water system for the municipal
ity as outlined by the City Engineer.
Resolved. That the City Clerk be and
is hereby directed to forward this notice
to the Los Angeles City Water Company
at once.
The resolution was drawn in con- j
Bonance v. Un me ieque&i. cniuuuicu in ;
the resolutions adopted at the non-par- j
tisan mass meeting of citizens held on
Saturday evening. It was a reasonable â 
request to make of the water company i
â simply a notification that the cor- j
poration would have no claim against
the city to compel it to purchase any
unnecessary improvements it might :
make to its plant between now and the j
expiration of the contract. Yet the res- j
olution absolutely died for want of a \
second. Councilmen Nickel and Toll
both jumped into. the breach as soon j
as It was presented and argued against
its adoption. They lined up for the i
water company. No Councilman had
backbone enough to second the resolu
tion, although its passage was request- â 
ed by a mass meeting of hundreds of
citizens. Councilman Grider was un
avoidably absent.
' But the Councilmen who are In this
fight and are so Indifferent as to the \
rights of the people and so fearful lest
the water company will not be accorded
every right it is entitled to are seeking
cover. They are aware that the rate- i
payers of Los Angeles, thanks to The j
Call, have their eyes opened as to the '
manner in which they are being dealt
with by public servants who forget
ante-election pledges. The result of :
this awakening is a report from the
committee on water supply, which was
made to the Council to-day. It was a
review, long and tiresome, of what that
committee has done â or, rather, what
it has not done â in the matter of bring
ing to a head the negotiations between ,
the water company and the city. The

report contains no new facts and none
that are of any Importance in so far
fiR shedding light on the all-Important j
questions concerned. Among other '
things the committee says in its re
port:
There has never been any doubt as to
the wishes of the people In this matter:
their attitude has been positive and un
equivocal for municipal ownership, and
no act of Council, legal advisers, engineer
or committee can be honestly Interpreted j
to mean anything but complete acquies
cence to this demand. If a more radical
action has been declined from time to
time, it has been done in obedience to ;
legal barriers and with the one object
of avoiding complications which would
avail naught but to defer the actual ac- ''
quirement of municipal ownership.
As a business man. in the conduct of his
practical affairs entrusts all legal ques
tions to competent advisers, so those now
In authority In municipal affairs have
deemed ft but justice to the citizens
whose Intrr^sts they represent to make
of this matter a legal rather than a polit
ical contest.' At all times have the legal
advisers of the city been fully consulted.
The report of the committee, which
contained absolutely nothing of any '
value, was filed. The water supply j
committee. it will be noted, has placed ;
all responsibility for Inactivity and de- I
lay upon City Attorney .W. E. Dunn.
The Citizens' Committee proposes to |
see to it that Mr. Dunn does something
more from now on than look wise when
it comes to taking action on the water
question. Mr. Dunn has all along
claimed that he was with the people in !
this contest, but he has not up to date j
availed himself of the opportunity of
going on record very strongly in that
direction.
In this matter of trifling with the
rights of the city the people of Los ;
Angeles have already had a costly ex- \
perience. If F. M. Kickell, the present
chairman of the Council committee on 1
water supply, had voted as he agreed
to in the City Council In 1892 the city
would now o^n the Hooker-Pomeroy i
head works site and the long and ex
pensive litigation that is pending to j
get that site for the city would have
been avoided. But Nickell cast his vote
so that the title to the head works land
was clouded, and now the city will be
compelled to pay large money for his
mistake, which has resulted in great
benefit and advantage to the water
company. This is one of the reasons
the people look with suspicion on i
Nickell now.
The water company to-day submitted i
to the Council its annual statement as
to its business. It is as follows:
For a period of twelve months, from
November 1, 1896, to October SI, 1897. Re- !
ceipts â Material sold, $90 76; service con
nection, 515.505; rent of house, $96; water
rents, $407,787 89; total, $424,590 65. Ex- ,
penditures â General construction account, !
$104,364 27; expense account. $104,633 08;
maintenance accounts. $107.62:) 52; interest '
account. $33,957 84; bills payable. $10,000;
oil well and tank, $2,7r;7 43; Los Feliz con- â 
nection account. $920 76; dividend account, I
$74,400; total, $438,638.
This statement as to expenses is i
graphic in its generalities. The three |
items of general construction, mainten- j
ance and expense, which cover $315,000,
are certainly very Indefinite.
To-morrow ex-Mayor Henry T. Haz- J
ard will designate the committee of I
nine on municipal water supply, and it j
will at once proceed" to endeavor to ob
tain some action at the hands of the
Council. The Aldermanic body is now !
looked upon with suspicion, but if it i
can be persuaded to do something in '
behalf of the people the general pub- j
lie will applaud, even If the syndicated j
dailies fail to realize the importance of j
the action taken.

CITIZEN OF STOCKTON
ASSAULTED BY THUGS.
Held by a Woman While Two
Strange Men Olub Him Into
Insensibility.
BTOCJCTON, Jun, 81.â It was learned at
the police otflce this afternoon that last
night K. E. Flnnlson was mysteriously
assaulted at hhÂ» residence in the City
Homestead, a suburb. Flnnison went out
into his yard in the darkness. He was
suddenly seized and held by a woman.
At the same instant he saw two men in
front of him. Then everything became
a. blank. As discovered afterward, he
was struck on the back of the head and
rendered unconscious. His wife found
him wandering aimlessly around the
premises. When accosted by her he said:
"You want to poison me."
To-day the man recovered his reason.
He said he could remember now that
the remark ho made to his wife was a
repetition of what the woman said who
seized him just before he was Btruck.
Finnison is the man who swore to the
complaint apainst Charles Burns a few
days ago charging blm with disturbing the
peace of himself and his wife. He was
mixed up In the trouble between Burns
and the latter's spouse, a girl of 15 years.
ACCIDENTAL SHOOTING
AT MOKELUMNE HILL
T. S. Gleason the Victim of a Man
"Who Didn't Know It Was
Loaded.
STOCKTON, Jan. 31.â Word was re
ceived here this afternoon of the* acci
dental shooting of T. S. Gleason, a well
known citizen at Mokelumne Hill. The
victim had been playing keno at a saloon
and at 11:30 last night, accompanied by
Constable Pe'.attn, he went to the saloon
of Robert Casey. Everybody was talking
about the game of keno, und during the
conversation Oleason slapped down a 10
cent piece on the counter and said:
"I am this much ahead of the game."
The constable followed suit with a sim
ilar remark. The barkeeper, Casey, then
playfully pointed an old, rusty revolver at
Gleason and said:
"Well, I am this much ahead of the
game."
A ft-w minutes later the latter lay dead
on the floor. The bullet penetrated his
forehead just above the nose. Casey is
almost crazed with grief.

LIVED FOR HOURS
WITH A BULLET
IN HIS BRAIN
Made Despondent by Sickness,
an Illinois Man Commits
Suicide at Santa
Monica.
SANTA MONICA. Jan. 31.â It is generally supposed that a bullet
flrpd into a man's brain will produce instant death, or, at the most,
give only a few minutes' respite, yet this morning E. G. Collett shot
himself with a 44-60 Winchester, and, with his brain exuding from the
wound, lived for six hours.
Collett came from Glenburn, Vermilion County, 111., but had been
â  stopping in Fresno for some time, arriving here a month ago. He was
a victim of catarrh of the stomach. He had become despondent, and
had been heard to declare that there was no reason for a man in his
serious condition trying to live. Dr. Place treated him for his disease.
Only last week Collett asked him for laudanum to rub on his head, but
the physician realized his condition of melancholia and ga\*e him a
prescription that could not injure him.
Early this morning Collett was found on the beach. Beside him lay
the rifle, which he had discharged by means of a stick pressed against
the trigger. The bullet entered the right side of the forehead, near
the top. He was removed to the Receiving Hospital and physicians
called, but the case was hopeless. The decision was that he could
survive but a few minutes. To the contrary, he lived for fully six
hours.
From his effects It was learned that he leaves two children in his
Illinois home. His wife died some time ago. A bankbook disclosed the
fact that he was a man of means and had plenty of funds for immedi
ate usp. He was 50 years old. Hi s sister, Mrs. E. E. Layton of Ver
milion, IU., was telegraphed to and the body awaits her directions.
DIES TO ESCAPE
AN EVIL SPIRIT
Chinese Commits Suicide
on the Steamship
Braemar.
Hangs Himself With Only Two
Feet of Ordinary Lamp
Wick.
Suffered From Rheumatism and Be
lieved Himself Possessed t>y
a Demon.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
_ .
TACOMA, Jan. 31.â After wrestling
for two years with the evil spirit to
whom Chines- attribute all physical ills
and suffering. .Look Su,a fireman on the
steamship Grammar, committed sui
cide this morning by hanging. Con
sidering his facilities, he did a very
neat Job of it, for he had only two
feet of ordinary lamp wick and a small
space in the stoke hole in which to ope
rate. The body was discovered short
ly after daylight and cut down by an
engineer. None of the other forty
Chinese aboard would go near the dead
man, nor venture into- that part of the
ship. Each was afraid he would be
come possessed of the devil, which,
they say, inhabited Look Su's body, if
they touched his corpse or anything it
had touched.
The Celestial was taken ill at For
mosa and suffered from an attack of
rheumatism all the way across, recov
ering only upon arrival at Victoria.
After solemn ceremonies, by means of
which his companions thought they
had driven out his evil spirit, last
night his rheumatism or the devil re
turned, doubtless causing his decision
to kill himself.
His superstitious countrymen explain
the reason for his death by saying that
he has really been dead for two years,
or ever since the devil, in the guise of
rheumatics, has had possession of him,
and because he did not die during this
last severe attack while crossing the
sea he took his own life in order to es
cape the clutches of the demon.
They believe the escaped devil is still
aboard ship and will keep away from
that stokehole in particular until ac
tually compelled to work there. That
will be to-morrow, for the Braemar de
parts on Wednesday morning.
Look Su's body will be carried back
to China on thp Braemar in a coffin
which his countrymen brought forth
from their quarters to-day. These
Asiatic liners always carry a number
of Chinese coffins for use on such occa
sions. No steamship refuses to carry
back the body, for in such an event it
would be ever afterward boycotted by
all Chinese crews.
Coroner Hoska held an inquest this
afternoon, bringing out the story here
related.
TRIED TO MURDER
AN ERRING WIFE
Emil A. Steger Frustrated in an At-
tempt to Cut His Spouse's
Throat.
ST. LOUIS. Jan. 31.â Emil A. Steger, an
employe of the Nelson Morris Company,
came over from East St. Louis at noon
to-day and went to 206 South Broadway.
His wife was there with another man.
Steger burst open the door, drew a mur
derous butcher knife and made for his
wife. He says he intended to cut her
throat.
"You have murdered my love," he
cried, "ruined my life and blasted the
future of our child. I'll show you no
mercy."
The woman seized the knife in both
hands. Then came a deadly struggle be
tween husband and wife. The keen edge
of the knife cut to the bone. Blood
spurted from the wounds and she
shrieked with pain. The husband jerked
the knife away with such force that he
lost his balance, staggered backward and
fell In a heap on the floor. The wife
darted out of the door, screaming for
help. He caught her and again she
grasped the knife. He struck her with
his free hand, knocking her down, and
was about to finish her when Mrs. Lewis,
the landlady, dragged him back.
At the hospital Mrs. Steger said they
had been marriea five years and had
quarreled most of the time. She left him
some time ago anil was working as a
waitress. C. P. Talbot, the other man
in the case, escaped by jumping from a
window.

SEEKS A LIFE
OF SOLITUDE
Young Hermit Who Lives
in the Santa Cruz
Mountains.
Chose an Isolated Spot Where
He Could Study the Occult
Sciences.
Has a Valet With Whom All Com
munication Is Carried On in
Writing.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA CRTTZ. Jan. 31.â Santa Cruz
County has a hermit, one who !s styled
by the people who reside near his
abode the "Laurel Hermit." This
name is chosen, as he resides three
miles from Laurel station, on the nar
row gauge road, fourteen miles from
this city. Laurel is an ideal spot for
one wishing to live this sort of life, as
it is in the Santa Cruz Mountains, and
with surrounding canyons, its beautiful
forests and its pretty streams, is just
the place for one who would commune
with nature.
It was in the fall that a young man,
a stranger, came to this place to take
up his home. The spot was a very iso
lated one, and the neighbors soon saw
that he wished to be let alone and pre
ferred his own company. A cottage
was built by himself, and here he
has resided, a mysterious personage.
The object of his choosing such a
spot for a residence was soon learned.
He is studying the occult sciences and
the mysteries unknown to man. A
queer request was made by himâ that
the men who were engaged in chop
ping wood near by his place should
cease their work, as it disturbed him.
He was soon designated by the people
as the "Laurel Hermit" on account of
his eccentricities and peculiarities.
The most singular feature is that a
man is engaged by him as a sort of
private secretary, who does all of his
business, such as the purchase of gro
ceries and household necessities. It is
said by those who reside in the neigh
borhood that these men never speak
to each other. All communication be
tween them is done by means of notes.
which are left on a certain spot on the
ranch.
The hermit owns a horse and car
riage and often makes excursions in
the deep recesses of the forest, where
he can be undisturbed in his studies
of the occult sciences. He has never
been troubled by any of his neighbors.
They do not call on him, as they know
they wnuld be unwelcome, and they
feel that if he so desires he may study
and commune with nature to his
heart's content. All that is known of
the young man is that he is from the
East.

ADMITS THE
FOUL CRIME
Abel Storms Confesses
That He Killed the
Rath burns.
Gives the Details of a Most
Fiendish Double
Crime.
Condemned toy His Own Mother, the
Assassin* Is in Danger of Being
Lynched.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BURLINGTON, la., Jan. 31.â Abol
Storms has confessed the murder of
Mrs. Fannie Rathbuni and her daugh
ter Mary. The confession was made to
Chief of Police Grelrier and the County
Attorney. Storms says he committed
the deed on Sunday night, January 25.
He states that he killed the mother in
the cellar. Then he enticed the little
girl Into the bedroom above, and after
an attempt to assault her, cut her
throat.
Storms was taken to the morgue, al
though he begged not to see the bodies
of his victims. He turned sickly pale
and trembled violently when he gazed
upon the corpses.
Storms and Cox, an alleged accom
plice, are now locked up in the county
jail and strongly guarded by deputies
armed with Winchesters. Sheriff Smith
has issued a proclamation to the effect
that any attempt to break into the jail
and lynch Storms will be met with sum
mary treatment by the deputies, who
will not hesitate to shoot. All is quiet
to-night, though threats of lynching
were made during the afternoon.
Storms' mother was in Burlington to
day. She is a fine-looking, intelligent
woman, and was much horrified by her
son's predicament. She exclaimed
when first hearing of the murder: "The
man who did that deed ought to be
hanged, no matter if he is my son."
Cox is held as an accessory to the
crime, but he has not confessed. His
preliminary hearing is set for Wednes
day.
HOT AIR SENT FORTH
FROM AN OLD CRATER.
AI.BTQT'ERQT'E, Jan. Sl.â There are
very strong indications that one of the
extinct volcanoes, about eight miles west
of Albuquerque, is preparing to resume
operations. A party of half a dozen per
eon3 from the town drove out to the vol
cano yesterday and report having felt hot
air issuing from'crevices In the bottom of
the crater in a number of places, and all
declare there was a distinct smell of sul
phur all about the place.
This volcano has been extinct for many
centuries, but the country for several
milt-s around is covered to a great depth

HANNA'S FRIEND
Attorney Campbell and
the Alleged Bribery
of Otis.
Tel is How He Supported Mc-
Kinley on Account of
Tariff Views.
Now the Investigation Into the Ohio
Senatorial Scandal Is Drawing
to a Close.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
COLUMBUS, 0., Jan. 31.â The inves
tigation into the alleged attempt to
bribe Representative Otis to vote for
Senator Hanna during the late Senato
rial contest is rapidly drawing to an
end. The committee held a brief ses
sion after the Senate adjourned this
evening.
Attorney T. C. Campbell was the only
witness examined. He was recalled. for
the purpose of allowing Senators Rcb
ertson and Garfield, who were not pres
ent last Friday, when Mr. Campbell
was on the stand, to question him.
Neither of the Senators, however, asked
a question, and the only queries were
made by Chairman Burke. Mr. Camp
bell told of his personal relations
toward Otis. He said he had frequently
acted as attorney for Otis and always
considered Otis a straightforward and
honest man. He said Mr. Otis had al
ways been a sort of mild Republican.
Campbell said he did not see how Otis
could have voted for Hanna, as Otis
was a member of a free silver club.
Campbell said he had always been on
friendly terms with Senator Hanna,
and had been associated in a business
way with some of Hanna's friends. He
claimed he had been a supporter of
Hanna until after the latter's position
on the money question had been made
known after his appointment to the
Senate. Then he had rather drifted
away from the Senator politically.
Campbell claimed he had been a sup
porter of McKinley in the Presidential
campaign oh account of his views on
the tariff.
No other witnesses were examined,
and the crowd of spectators who had
gathered were somewhat disappointed.
It is believed the committee will com
plete its work this week.
MASKED MEN
DEMAND A PRISONER.
; Conflicting Beports Concerning a
Negro Murderer Who Was in
Custody of a Constable.
GALENA, Kan., Jan. 31.â A mob of
fifty masked men were at the Memphis
depot here early this morning- when Con
stable Lafe Roe arrived from Columbus
| with Richard Ward, a negro, who. with
' out serious provocation, fatally stabbed
Dennis Brown last week. The mob de
; manded that Ward be handed over to
; them, but the officer quietly drew his
! prisoner into the car and went on to tho
! next station. It is believed that Ward
has been returned to the county jail at
j Columbus.
COLL'MBUS, Kan., Jan. 31.â At the

j stable Roe has not returned from Galena
with his negro prisoner, Ward. One re
! port has it that when pressed by the
! mob Roe permitted the negro to run
I through the car and escape in the dark
| ness. Another rumor in circulation is
: that the negro has been caug-ht and

NEWS FROM
CONSUL LEE
So It Is Believed That
All Is Quiet at
Havana.
Supplies Sent to Private
Individuals Are
Seized.
Goods for Suffering Cubans
Should Go to Uncle Sam's
Representative.
RUIZ CLAIM STILL DRAGS.
But the Government Intends to
Cause Spain to Hasten Its
Consideration.
' i Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Jan. 31.
No word has been received at the
State Department from Consul-General
Lee since Saturday last, which is taken
as an indication that all is quiet there,
and that the situation remains un
changed. The department has been in
formed that the Spanish authorities in
Havana had seized certain supplies
consigned to a private individual, but
there is no cause for complaint in this
Incident, inasmuch as the agreement
by the department with the Spanish
authorities for the free admission of
supplies for the suffering Cubans
looked to the consignment of all such
supplies to Consul-General Lee and the
exclusion of individuals from the privi
lege of free admission of goods, a pro
vision necessary to prevent frauds
upon the customs revenues.
Another demand is to be made upon
Bpain for the payment of $75,000 in
demnity to the widow of Dr. Ricardo
Ruiz for murder of her husband in
Guanabacoa jail. It is understood that
the State Department is preparing an
instruction to Minister Woodford
which will be sent to that official in a
few days in which he will be directed
to call the attention of Minister of
Foreign Affairs Sagasta to the fact
that this claim was presented last
summer; that it has not yet been paid,
nor, in fact, has a detailed answer been
received to the note addressed to the
late Minister Canovas. The only re
ply made has been a formal acknowl
edgment of the receipt of the claim.
There is every reason to believe that
the instructions which the department
is preparing will be more vigorous in
character than that submitted last
summer. The original note which ac
companied the claim was courteous
in tone and appealed to Spain's sense
of justice. Since its presentation the
administration has made no attempt
to press the claim, partly on account
of the negotiations following the ar
rival of Minister Woodford in Madrid,
which have resulted in the inaugura
tion of autonomy in Cuba and carrying
out of a humane policy in the prosecu
tion of the war.
It is expected by thf administration
that Spain may take an argumentative
course and endeavor to rebut the evi
dence produced hy the United States
showing that Ruiz jvas murdered, by
counter evidence that he committed
euicide. The department received a
letter from Mrs. Ruiz a few days ago,
in which she asked to be informed as
to the steps taken to procure the pay
ment of hpr claim. She wrote that she
Is In needy circumstances and express
ed a hope the United States would do
all it could to obtain the indemnity de
manded.
The action to be taken by the de
partment effectually disposes of reports
which have been persistently in circu
lation for several months, alleging that
Minister De Lome had privately settled
with Mrs. Ruiz, as was done by his
Government in the Delgado case.
SAYS SHE WAS TRICKED
INTO AN INVESTMENT.
Woman Asks fora Beceiver for the
Northwestern Transporta
tion Company.
TACOMA, Jan. SLâ lire. Emma Haskin
to-day asked Judge Williamson to appoint
a receiver for the Northwestern Trans
portation Company, which was incor
porated two weeks ago to run steamships
to and between ports in Alaska. Her ap
plication will be heard to-morrow, but
an injunction was issued to-day enjoin
ing the company and its officers from
selling two small steamships they have
already purchased.
In support of her request for a re
ceiver, Mrs. Haskin declares she. was
tricked into investing her money in one
sixth of the company's capital stock, on
promises that her husband. George Has
kin, would be made the company's gen
eral manager. This promise was made,
she nays, by her husband, together with
Lewis Levy, John Asher and Ed Heine,
all prominent citizens. Haskin was duly
elected manager on January 19. but nine
days later, she alleges, Levy, Asher and
Heine, acting- as a majority of the trus
tees, revoked his appointment and named
another in his stead. Being thus pre
vented from sharing in the management,
Mrs. Haskin wants the company's af
fairs closed and the proceeds of its as
eets distributed among the stockholders.

People Hear the Truth.
BpÂ«cl*l Dispatch to The Call.
As shown by the experience
of Mr. Herbert Myrick, editor
of the Orange Judd Farmer, pub
lished at Dcs Moines, lowa,
yesterday, the advocates of the
annexation of Hawaii do not
propose to permit even freedom
of speech with reference to the
matter. The cause which will
not bear the fullest and freest
public discussion hardly needs
the condemnation of formal dis
approval. It is condemned by
the silence its defenders would
compel.
DES MOINES, la., Jan. 31.â Herbert
Myrick, editor of the Orange Judd
Farmer, was the recipient of most dis
courteous treatment at the hands of
the advocates of Hawaiian annexation
in this city to-day. He had been in
vited, as an authority on the subject,
to deliver an address before the mem
bers of the Legislature on the dangers
which threaten the American farmer if
the treaty now pending in Congress
should be passed and become a fact.
It was supposed by those who Invited
him that the Assembly chamber could
be had, and it was generally adver
tised that the address would be de
livered at the close of to-day's session
of the Legislature. A large crowd of
prospective sugar-beet growers had
gathered and so frightened the annex-
ationists they determined not to permit
Myrick to be heard, if that were possi
ble.
To that end Senator Van Houten,
who has a resolution indorsing annex
ation pending, objected to permitting
Mr. Myrick's address to be delivered
in the State House. As one objection
suffices, fhe State House could not be
had.
The anti-annexationists, however,
would not be balked, and, gathering at
another hall, heard Mr. Myrick's ad
dress, which was replete with reasons
why the American farmer should op
pose the bringing into the Union of Ha
waii.
"Let us take lowa," Mr. Myrick said,
"as a typical agricultural State for
comparison. If lowa were to produce
the 227,000 tons of sugar made in Ha
waii last year, practically all of which
was shipped to this country, 'twould
have built over twenty big factories,
costing, say $500,000 each, requiring an
investment of say $12,000,000. These
factories would require about 2.000,000
tons of beets, to grow which fully 165,
000 acres would be needed, or over half
a million acres for a three-crop rota
tion. At $4 per ton, these factories
would pay out over $8,000,000 for beets,
or more money than lowiv farmers got
for all the wheat they raised in 1896.
"All the hogs In lowa would not sell
for enough to enable the American con
sumers to pay an average price of 5 cents
a pound for the Hawaiian sugar import
ed during the past year. The milch
cows in lowa do not much exceed in
value the retail price of this sugar.
The rapid development of lowa's dairy
industry has been one of the marvels
of her agriculture, yet the 75,000,000
pounds of butter made in her 725
creameries in 1896 sold for about only
half enough to pay the consumers'
price for the Hawaiian sugar imported
last year.
"All the grain raised in lowa in 1896,
corn alone excepted, hardly equaled in
value what the West pays for the
sugar it consumes in one year. Yet
4,000,000 acres of land were devoted to
these crops.
"lowa is the banner corn State of
the West. In 1896 she raised on 8,260,
000 acres nearly 32r),000,000 bushels of
corn, worth 545,000,000. But this vast
crop, upon which her prosperity so
largely depends, was worth less than
twice what Western consumers would
pay for Hawaiian sugar in a single
year. lowa's oat crop is grown on
about 4,000,000 acres and is worth ?12,
000,000, but it must be doubled to equal
what consumers pay for Hawaiian
sugar. lowa's wheat crop must be
trebled to equal in value what Ameri
can consumers pay for Hawaiian
sugar.
"The cost of producing sugar in Ha
waii is 1H centsâ less than 2 cents per
pound â according to the annual reports
of the Hutchinson, Ewa and other com
panies. Refining at Pacific Coast re
fineries costs less than % cent a pound.
The present freight rate from Honolulu
to Missouri River points is about %
cent a pound. This makes the cost to
the producer from 2%, to 3^4 oents per
pound for refined sugar delivered in
Nebraska or lowa. It is believed that
3 cents would fairly represent the
average cost of Sandwich Island re
fined sugar laid down in Nebraska or
lowa.
"The American Sugar Trust, realizing
that this domestic beet sugar industry
was destined to create a disturbing
factor that might necessitate a com
plete rearrangement of its trade, re
fused to renew iis contract with the
Hawaiian trust. So the island munop

MADE A MANIAC
BY THE BRUTALITY
OF A SHIP'S MATE
Seamen of the George Stetson
Tell a Story of Awful Cru
elty to One of Their
Number,
PORTLAND, Jan. 31.â 1f the story of John Burke, who came around
the Horn on the American ship Georgre Stetson In the capacity of
sailor, can be believed, the officers of this ship are guilty of the most
barbarous cruelties that have been reported at this port in many a day.
The Stetson arrived at Astoria with a cargo of coal on Thursday, be
ing 174 days out from Baltimore, where she took on cargo. Captain
Murphy is in command and George Harvey is first officer.
The victim of the alleged brutality of the officers, and especially of â¢
that of First Mate Harvey, is a seaman named Amos Stone, son of a
wealthy jewelry merchant of Boston. Stone is said to have been
taken off the Stetson at Astoria a raving maniac, having arrived at
this condition as a result of the treatment he received on the voyage.
"Stone was singled out as the especial object of Harvey's brutal
ity soon after we left Baltimore," said Burke, in narrating his story.
"Harvey, for some reason, knocked him insensible with an iron top maul,
and as the rest of us feared we would be treated likewise we were at
the point of turning back four hours after we left port. As soon as
we saw what had happened we scampered up the masts to turn to. The
mate, however, informed the captain, who bullied us into remaining
with the ship.
"Stone, as the result of the injury he received, was laid up for some
days, during which time he was given little to eat. As soon as he re
covered sufficiently to venture out and report for duty Harvey kicked
him off the forecastle. From that time on Stone was unable to leave
his cabin. He was starved and beaten almost daily, and by the time
we reached Astoria he was skin and bones and a raving maniac. As
we were rounding the Horn, where the seas were very bad, Harvey
would open the door of Stone's cabin so as to let the water in to soak
his clothes and bedding. I have also seen Harvey open the door of
Stone's cabin and with a heavy leather strap beat him until big welts
stood out on his legs and back. Stone, who was already losing his
reason, would not wince under this scourging and stood like a statue,
without saying a word in remonstrance.
"An effort was made to obliterate the marks on Stone's body before
the ship reached Astoria, but without success, and he will carry the
marks with him to the grave. During much of the time Stone was
cooped up in his cabin he had nothing but refuse to cat, ami the place
was the most foul-smelling I was ever in. He was abused like a dog,
even during the time he was in irons. It made me sick to look at him,
accustomed as I was to seeing displays of bruiality on the high seas."
Burkes story is corroborated in every detail by Ernest Weyl, Ira
Dierks and Charles Russell, three of the crew, who are now staying in
Larry Sullivan's sailor boarding house, on North Second street.
oly has secured refineries at Crockett
and elsewhere on the Pacific Coast, and
proposes to sell its sugar throughout
the West at any cost. It can well af
ford to sell at cost for two years, or
even at a loss, to kill the beet sugar
industry, for then it could renew its
trade with the trust, dividing the coun
try between the two organizations, and
putting up prices 'as much as the traf
fic would bear.'
"In addition to these purely commer
cial reasons for the impending war
against Western beet sugar, is the feud
between the Hawaiian trust, including
Augustus Spreckeis, the latter's father,
Claus Spreckeis. The older man has
been quietly selling out his interests on
the islands for several years, because
he realized that the American people
would not much longer permit a few
planters there to wax fat at the ex
pense of our farmers. He evidently felt
that it was only a question of time be
fore the advantages that had made him
so rich would be taken away by the
abrogation of the reciprocity treaty. In
that event he foresaw a brilliant future
for beet sugar in the West, and hav
ing demonstrated the possibilities o"
that industry at Watsonvllle, is now
completing what will be the largest
beet sugar plant in the world at Sa
linas, California.
"To the bad blood that had previousty
existed between the father and son is
now added indignation among the
planters' ring that Claus Spreckels
should have 'deserted them,' as they
term it, and 'war to the knife, death
to beet sugar,' are the watchwords or
the Hawaiian sugar trust."

AND CITIZENS
San Jose's Council Con
tracts for a Fire Alarm
System.
Agrees to Pay More Than the
Amount of the Com
pany's Bid.
â â â â â ___
Mayor Koch Will Veto the EXenl, but
It Will Be Passed Over
His Head.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 31.â The City Coun
cil took another Btep to-night in its
raid on the city treasury. A resolution
for the purchase of a fire-alarm syÃtem
from the United States Fire and Police
Telegraph Company was carried unan
imously, and this, too, in the face of
adverse public opinion. The price is
$3900, payable in monthly installments
of $65.
This is $1500 higher than a bid sub
mitted by the same company a month
ago. An additional expenditure of a
large sum will be necessary to rewire
the city for the system. Only Council
men Fay, Dittus and Nolting were
present, but Krieg. the absentee, is also
in favor of the system, and the fire
alarm system will be saddled upon the
city despite the Mayor's veto. lUis said
Mayor Koch will refuse to sign the
contract, and that the affair will be
carried into court.
The Council at first proposed to give
the contract to the United States Com
pany for $3900. Mayor Koch put a
stop to this by refusing to sign the con
tract, as bids had not been called for.
Then bids were advertised for and the
United States Company submittted a
bid of $2400 and the Gamewell Com
pany one of $3300. Notwithstanding
that the United States Company offered
to put in the same system as the one
adopted to-night for $2400, the Council
gave the same company the contract
for $3900, or $300 over the bid of the
Gamewell Company, claiming that It
was a larger system.
Councilman Fay presented a long
typewritten statement, explaining his
action. It was a weak defense, and
criticized Mayor Koch's action on nu
merous questions. Councilman Nolt
ing also explained his interest in the
awarding of the contract.
Although the people of the city op
pose the purchase of a new fire-alarm
system, and regard it as an attempt to
loot the treasury, the resolution pur
chasing the system will probably be
passed over the Mayor's veto.
GREAT BLIZZARD
EXPECTED IN NEW YORK
Already Traffic Is Impeded by Blind
ing Snow, and a Big Storm
Is Predicted.
NEW YORK, Jan. 31.â Since 3 o'clock
this morning snow has been falling in
this city and vicinity, and to-night a
strong west wind and falling tempera
ture call forth many predictions of a bliz
zard. All day there was a fog on the
bay in addition to the blinding snow, and
traffic on the water was impeded seri
ously. There was one serious ferryboat
collision, and many accidents were nar
rowly averted. The cable and elevated
roads in this city and the trolley lines
in Brooklyn and Jersey City kept snow
plows in constant use. and were not
badly impeded. The cold weather filled
the city lodging houses to overflowing
last night and to-night, and many women
and children who applied for.shelter were
sent to the different hospitals. Trains
and railways terminating in Greater New
York and Jersey City were delayed by
the storm, but not to a great extent. The
storm started like the blizzard of March
12, 1888, that tied up traffic in thiÃ city for
several days. â¢
Weather Forecaster Dunn said to-night â 
"The weather conditions have taken on a
form resembling more the outline of the
blizzard than any other storm that has
appeared on our maps for many days."

tion of the bachelor herd as shown by the
quota of killable seals; experimentation
on a larger scale in the branding of fe
male pups and adult cows for the purpose
of depreciating the value of pelagic skins;
further experimentation in the herding
of young bachelors in the salt lagoon of
St. Pauls Island during the season of
pelagic sealing, for the purpose of pro
tecting them from the pelagic fleet, and
Investigation of the methods of huntinig
the sea otter, with a view to devising
means of saving them from extermination
in Alaskan waters; an investigation so far
as time will allow of the present condi
tion of the salmon fisheries of Alaska; a
reconsideration of the effects of the Paris
award.
The sole cause of the decline of the
fur seal herd is found in pelagic sealing.
This conclusion was reached last year,
and a reconsideration of all the questions
involved give no reason to alter or modi
fy it. The investigation of the season of
1897 only strengthens it. Pelagic sealing
involves the indiscriminate kilHng of
males and females, the latter forming at
all times the greater part of the pelagic
catch. When we take into account the
loss of the herd through old age and
the small percentage of the young which
survive to breeding ape, we find the mar
gin of increase in the herds to be very
small. The killing of females to any de
gree in excess of the annual increase of
three-year-old breeders must cause a de
cline. Under pelagic sealing this increase
has at all times, since 1595, been vastly
exceeded.

How Captain Ray Settled the Supply
Problem at Fort
Yukon.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 31.-The War De
partment has received advices from it 3
agent at Dyea, Major I. H. Rucker,
Fourth Cavalry. In one dispatch, dated
January 12, the major says that W. H.
Rank, just in from Dawson, December 16,
had dispatches from Captain Ray, the
army officer sent into the mining country
by Secretary Alger to report upon condi
tions there.
Rank says that Ray, who was at Fort
Tukon, had seized all the supplies of the
Alaska Commercial Company and of the
North American Trading Company in the
name of the Government and was issuing
them to the people, selling at the com
pany's prices to those who could afford to
pay, and giving to those unable to pay.
There were 600 people at Fort Yukon.
Rank further said that Ray would ask
the Government for 500 troops to be sta
tioned at Circle City and vicinity.

Special Dispatch *- The Call.
CHICAGO, Jant . 31.â Captain A. B.
Smith of Los Angeles, Cal., is in the
city in the interests of a new line of
steamers he proposes operating on the
Mexican coast in opposition to the Pa
cific Mail, which, he says, will shorten
the distance between New York and
San Francisco by six days' travel. It is
to be operated in connection with the
Tehuantepec railroad, a concession for
which he has already obtained from
the Mexican Government. He has also
been granted a right of way for the
Gulf of California and Yuma railroad
to connect the northern terminus of the
steamboat line with the Southern Pa
cific Railroad, which, Captain Smith
says, can be compelled under its char
ter to carry freight and passengers no
matter by whom offered at propor
tional rates.
In case he must, Captain Smith says
he will put on a line of boats up the
Colorado River to the Needles and
there connect with the Atlantic and
Pacific.
Four steamers have been purchased,
and with these semi-weekly trips will
be made, the distance being 1800 miles.
Captain Smith is very much elated
over the prospects, and figures he will
be able to control a grreater part of the
Mexican and South American business.
The boats will carry the Mexican flag,
and will have the protection of that
vju\ eriiiiiciiL..
Besides the concessions named, Cap
tain Smith has also obtained a grant of
1,000,000 acres of land, embracing- the
extreme northwestern portion of Mex
ico. This is a rich mining: country, and
in portions is very. fertile agricultural
land. .
POTTER'S FRIENDS UNEASY.

NEW YORK, Jan. 31.â The far West Is
now the seat of war in Potter's League of
American "Wheelmen presidential cam
paign. R. M. Welch of San Francisco,
who has been prominent in the California
secession movement, is declared to be I
directing 1 the anti-Potter campaign in I
that part of the country. Copies of cir- ;

in which votes of Kansas, Nebraska,

that Potter is certain of 2SB votes in the

Votes With the Majority.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
"Washington, Jan. 31.
The House buried to-day the Teller
resolution declaring the bonds of the
United States payable in silver under
en adverse majority of fifty votes. The
Republicans were solidly arrayed in op
position, with two exceptions, Linney
of North Carolina, who voted with the
and Populists, and "White of
North Carolina, the only colored mem
ber of the House, who answered "pres
ent" when his name was called. The
desertions from the Democratic side
were McAleer of Pennsylvania and El
liott of South Carolina. Both voted
with the Republicans against the prop
osition. Speaker Reed, although it is
not customary for him to vote, had his
name called, and, amid the cheers of
his followers, went or. record in oppo
sition to- the resolution. The vote was
reached after five hours of debate un
der a special order adopted at the open-
Ing of the session to-day. The limited
time allowed for debate and the pres
sure of members for an opportunity to
be heard was so great that the leaders
on both sides were compelled to farm
out the time by minutes. This detract
ed much from the continuity of the dis
cussion, but It also, in a measure, in
tensified the interest In the galleries,
which were crowded all day, and the
combatants on the floor were cheered
by their respective sympathizers.
Many of the Senators from the other
end of the Capitol were also present to
listen to the arguments.
The majority, under the leadership of
fDingley, who made a carefully pre
pared speech, sounding the keynote of
the opposition, assumed the position
that the last clause of the resolution
was in reality a disguised declaration
for the free coinage of silver, while the
assaulting Democrats, under the direc
tion of Bailey, maintained that the de
feat of the resolution was another step
in the direction of the establishment of
the gold standard, to which they al
leged both the President and Secretary
Gage had irrevocably committed the
Republican party. The debate was at
times fast and heated, but there were
no sensational incidents beyond the
hissing of Rhea of Kentucky, when he
said that, as the author of the "crime
of '"3," the hottest places in hades
would be reserved for the present Sec
retary of State. The vote on the reso
lution was: Ayes 132, nays IS2.
The struggle opened immediately after
the reading of the journal, when Dlngley
. (R.) of Maine, chairman of the Ways and
Moans Committee, reported back the
resolution with the recommendation that
it should not pass.
Henderson of lowa, one of the leaders
of the majority, followed this by present-
Ing the special order agreed on by the
Committee on Rules, providing for the
immediate consideration of the resolu
tion and a vote without Intervening mo
tion at 5 o'clock to-day. The rule was as
follows:
"Resolved. That Immediately upon the
adoption of this resolution the House
shall proceed to the consideration of the
Senate concurrent resolution No. 22 (Tel
ler resolution), that general debate shall
be had thereon until the hour of 5 o'clock,
at which time, without any Intervening
motion, a vote shall be taken upon the
passage of said resolution. General leave
tn print upon the subject of said resolu
tion for five days from this date is hereby
granted."
Wheeler (D.) of Alabama and DeAr
mond (D.) of Missouri protested vigor
ously, however, ami the latter said that
Â»â¢'? he had an opportunity he would pro
pose a Cuban belligerency amendment.
To this suggestion Speaker Reed re
tnrted curtly that it would not be in
order, and when DeArrnond appealed to
him not to decide the question hastily,
the Speaker exclaimed: "That it is not
In order Is too plain for argument."
During this colloquy there were evi
dences of disturbance and excitement on
tfie Republican side, of which Johnson
(R.) of Indiana was the center. At last
Juhnson Insisted upon asking a question
of Henderson. He wanted to know, with
emphasis, whether it was true that all
thp time was to be consumed by the
members of the Ways and Means Com
mittee.
"There Is no such proposition." called
nut Dalzell CP..) of Pennsylvania. But
Johnson did not subside, and continued to
profest, declaring loudly that he antag
onized the rule. If such was the Intention.
He had a wordy war with Dingley, but
in a tone that could not be heard in the
confusion.
The Speaker cut off further Incident by
putting the question, and the rule was
adopted by a vote of 143 to 115. the Demo
crats refraining from demanding a roll
call. Then there folowed a controversy
over the division of time.
To suggestions that time should be di
vided between Democrats, Populists and
Republicans. Dingley retorted: '"I was
not aware that there was any distinction
between the Populists and Democrats, as
: r present constituted." He said time
would be equally divided between those
for and against the resolution.
Dingley then opened the debate in op
position to the resolution. It was. he paid.
not one which, even if passed by both
Houses, would have force. If passed, it
would be only an expression of the two
Houses.
"Its importance, therefore." continued
Dingley, "lies in the fact that, if con
curred in by the House, it will legitimate
ly and inevitably be regarded, not only
here, but by the world, ad the expression
of the deliberate majority of the Ameri
can people as to their standard of honor
good faith In the discharge not only
of national but also of private obliga
tions.
"This resolution is presented for the
purpose of securing an expression by
Congress as to the power of the Govern
ment either as to the payment of its
obligations or as to what may be de
clared legal tender. No one denies that
Ihj". or fuur other /nation, has the power.
to pay In gold, or silver, or paper or cop
per according to their pleasure. Pay
ment cannot be enforced against a sov
ereign nation. Its obligations are meas
ured by It 3 own oense of honor and good
faith. The intelligent selfishness of a na
tion which Is to live not simply for a
generation, but for centuries, ought to
lead it, and whenever a nation is wisely
governed does lead it to scrupulously
maintain its pledges in both letter and
spirit, so as to preserve its credit un
tarnished, and thereby not only to make
It possible to borrow" at the lowest rate
of interest, but also to make it easy to
obtain loans In exigencies which are.
sooner or later, to come to every nation.
"Honor and credit are its title deeds to
permanence and prosperity. The dishonor
of the pending resolution is in Its tail.
And that string, well-nigh harmless twen
ty years ago, under conditions then exist
ing, is made doubly harmful by the condi
tions of to-day. The detail of this resolu
tion is as follows: That to restore to its
coinage such silver coins as a legal ten
der in the payment of said bonds (mean
ing practically all the bonds of the United
.States now outstanding) is not In viola
tion of the public faith nor in derogation
of the rights of the public creditor.
"The declarations of the movers and
supporters of this resolution in the Sen
ate during its recent consideration in
that body throw a flood of light on what
is meant now by the 'erase' to restore to
coinage silver coin, a phrase which, in
1878, was with good reason interpreted by
many who supported a similar resolution
to mean something vitally different from
what it must mean now.
"This brings me," proceeded Dingley,
"to the consideration of the vital ques
tion as to whether the Government has
the moral right; in other words, whether
it would be an act which the moral sense
of the world would regard as in accord
ance with honor and faith for the United
States to pay its outstanding bonded in
debtedness In dollars of so materially less
value than the dollar which has been the
practical standard of value since 1534.
barring the war and reconstruction pert
od. and which has been the legal and
practical standard of value since 1579. and
the dollar in which our bonded indebted
ness has been paid thus far. paid by
every administration from Lincoln to Mc-
Kinley, to wit: The dollar equal in value
3 grains of standard gold. (Ap
plause.) Bear In mind that we are dis
cussing this question from the point of
honor and good faith and not from the
point of power or technical legal rights,
for I have already said that the Govern
ment can do as it pleases. More than
thr^e-fourths of the outstanding bonds
were, as a matter of fact, issued and sold
after IS7S. when the silver dollar was
dropped from the list of coins. Now, in
view of these acts, would it be -good faith
for Congress, now that silver has so
greatly depreciated, to restore its free
and unlimited coinage at the ratio of 16 to
1, by this country alone, when the market
ratio is 33 to 1. and then use such dollars
to pay the bonds which we had sold for
gold under such circumstances? I fear
that many of you are resting on the ex
pe :at!on which you have that nothing of
this kind will be done and are excusing
vote for it on the unworthy idea
that you are 'playing politics.'
"If bo, I beg of you not to trifle with
the honor and good faith of the nation
for any such miserable end; for rest as
sured such an expression of opinion as
to the sense of honor of the people of
this country, contemplated by this reso
lution, under existing conditions, would
seriously injure the credit of the coun
try and tend to weaken reviving confi
dence. It' is. I believe (as does every
scientific bimetallist in the world outside
of politics), that the free and unlimited
coinage of silver at 16 to l by this coun
try would make the United States a sil
ver monometallic country, like Mexico
and China, and would gfrve us a silver
basis that would obstruct our trade with
gold standard countries that now take
90 per cent of our exports, and prove a
serious menace to our progress; and be
cause I believe that It would seriously
injure our credit and standing as a na
tion, I appeal to the gentlemen on this
side of the House to maintain the pledge
which the Republican party made at St.
Louis to keep all our currency, whether
silver or paper, as good as gold and pre
serve the public faith and credit; and
to the gentlemen on the other Bide to
maintain the standard of value which
Jackson's administration gave the coun
try sixty-four years ago, arid the honor
and faith of the nation so carefully pre
served by the father of the Democratic
party, and to take tha opportunity of
fered by the resolution now before the
House to show the country and the whole
world that the good name of the nation
is safe in our hands." (Prolonged Re
publican applause.)
After the outburst of applause which
! greeted the close of Dingley s speech had
i subsided. Bailey was recognized for an
i hour. He first yielded twenty minutes t<
Wheeler (D.) of Alabama, a member of
\ the Ways and Means Committee, who sub
| mitted an argument in suport of the reso
j lution. Before closing Wheeler yielded a
minute each to half a dozen members of
I the Democratic side, each of whom, as
Cowherd (D.) of Missouri said, erected a
hook on which to hang a speech in the
Congressional Record.
Among others who made brief speeches
I were: Dockery, Bland, Hopkins, Clayton,
I Grosvenor, Wheeler, Pearce, Grow,
Brumm. Balrd. Bell. Johr.son. Steele. Ev
'â , ans. Walker. Bartlett, Brucker, Norton,
Cochran. Dolliver, Magulre, Cannon, Hep-
I burn. Rhea. Lacey, Swanson.
Bailey, owing to the great pressure for
time, had only four minutes in which to
close the debate for his side. The reso
lution under consideration, he said, con
tained two propositions, one moral and
the othpr legal. One asserts as a matter
of law that the bonds of the United States
are redeemable at the option of the Gov
ernment in silver, and the other, as a
| matter of morals, that to restore to its
coinage such silver coins as a legal tender
in payment of the bonds, principal an<l
interest, is not in violation of the public
faith nor in derogation of the rights of
the public creditors. He would not dwell,
j he said, en the legal aspect of the ques
tion. There was not a lawyer in the
! United States or in any other country
who would venture on his professional
! reputation to deny that the bonds could
!be paid in silver. That went without
| saying. The Republicans Jn this matter
1 must justify themselves, if at all. upon
the proposition that in their conscience
they believe that gold was the money of
the contract.
Henderson (R.) of lowa, the one-leggpd
veteran, and Dalzell (R.) of Pennsyl
vania closed th<* debate with five-minute
speeches in opposition to the resolution.
j The former created intense enthusiasm,
as with the stump of his leg resting on
a bench at the right of the Speaker's
chair and his crutches by his side, he
j rallied his followers. This resolution, he
! said, reminded him of one of the mono-
I grams he used to see on the Bryan ban-
I ners.
Baileyâ You will see it again in 1909.
(Democratic applause.)
Henderson â \es. and we will tear it
down again. (Republican applause.) "It
was the three Rs," continued Henderson.
1 'Radicalism. Rascality and Repudia
tion.' This scene reminds me of a Popo
cratic convention. It is the old familiar
howl agalnÃt the bondholders. But, gen
tlemen, you must remember that they
cannot cut down the money of the bond
holders without cutting in half the money
that goes to the old soldier or his widow
or orphan; or the money of the men who
toll."
Simpson (P.) of Kansasâ How about
the taxpayers?
Henderson waved Simpson's interroga
tory aside. The resolution, he resumed,
was in reality part of the programme
that sought to commit the country to the
single silver standard. He recalled the
President's declaration in his New York
epeech.
"God bless little Mac." he exclaimed
fervently. "His declaration means that
the best' money in the world shall be paid
to the bondholders, the plow-holder, the
hod-holder, the pen-holder, the pension
holder and all who toil and all who
sweat. [Republican applause.] Put that
in your pipe and smoke It. On that issue
we will meet you next fall and thrash
you as we thrashed you in 1896." IPro
ionged Republican cheers ]
Dalzell (R.) of Pennsylvania declared
that the resolution was meaningless un
less its purpose was to open the mints
to the free and unlimited coinage of
silver. , ...
Then at 5 o'clock came the vote, which
was followed with interest, notwith
standing the defeat of the resolution was
a foregone conclusion. The Speaker an
nounced that the vote would be directly
on the resolution not on the adverse re
port. It was soon evident that party
ranks were being held intact. There
were only three breaks. Elliott (D.) of
South Carolina and McAleer (D.) of
Pennslyvania voted against the resolu
tion and LJnnoy (R.) of North Carolina
voted for it. White (R.) of North Caro
lina did not vote. After the roll was
called, the Speaker* asked that his name
be called, and on the call he responded
with a vigorous "No." He then an
nounced the result: Ayes 132, noes 182.
The Republicans cheered long and
loud over their victory, and then at 5:35
p. in. the House adjourned.

256.000. The bill was placed on the calen
dar.
The agricultural appropriation bill was
reported by Cullom or Illinois, and placed
on the calendar.
Foraker secured the adoption of a reso
lution instructing the Secretary of War
to return to the State of Ohio the regi
mental Hags of the Twenty-tlrst, Twenty
eighth and Sixtieth Regiments of Ohio
Volunteers, under the request of the Gov
ernor of Ohio.
Morgan of Alabama presented a reso
lution, which he asked to lie on the table,
requesting the President, If in his opin
ion not inconsistent with the public ser
vice, to send to the Senate the corre
spondence and notes of a diplomatic
character relating to the negotiations and
to the exchange of ratifications up<i,n A
treaty between the United States and
Great Britain relating to compensation
for the seizures of British ships in the
Bering Sea, and also the instructions and
advice given by the State Department to
the agent or attorney of the United
States as to the conduct of the arbitra
tion.
At the request of Carter, chairman of
the Census Committee, the pending cen
sus bill was made the unfinished busi
ness.
Pettigrew of South Dakota gave notice
that he would to-morrow speak upon his
resolution declaring it to be the policy
of the United States not to acquire ter
ritory to defend which a navy would be
required.
Hale anticipated, he said, that the pro
posed speech of the Senator from South
Dakota would trench upon a matter prop
erly being considered by the Senate in
executive session. If it should so trench
it would be a violation of the Senate
rules, and he wanted it understood that
the objection would be raised.
Pettigrew said he thought it would be
time enough to object when it became
evident that he was violating the Senate
rules.
Chandler gave notice that on next 1Â« rl
day, at the conclusion of the morning
business, he would move to take up the
case relating to the seating of Mr. Cor
bett as Senator from Oregon.
Foraker called up the bill providing, un
der certain conditions, for the purchase
by the Government of the Kansas Pacific
branch of the Union Pacific Railroad,
and asked that it be considered at once.
Thurston offered the following amend
ment to the bill: ..
"In case the Kansas Pacific division of
the Union Pacific Railroad shall be pur
chased for the United States, that the
President may, in hia discretion, sell the
railroad and property so purchased for a
sum not less than the full amount paid
out by the United States to purchase the
railroad and property. The Secretary of
the Treasury shall, under the direction
of the President, make, execute and de
liver to the purchaser or purchasers of
said railroad and said property a convey
ance in writing, but not under seal, which
conveyance shall vest in said purchaser
or purchasers all the rights, title and
Interest of the United States in and to the
property therein described."
Turpie #f Indiana offered to the amend
ment an amendment providing that "in
no case shall the sale be made for a less
sum than the original claim and interest
due thereon."
In view of Turpie's amendment, For
aker withdrew his request for immediate
consideration.
Upon motion of Quay the army appro
priation bill was then laid before the Sen
ate. The bill, after being slightly amend
ed, was passed, carrying $23,143,492.
On motion of Cullom of Illinois the
legislative, executive and judicial appro
priation bill was laid before the Senate.
As it came from the House the bill car
ried $21,476,245. and as reported to the Sen
ate it carried $21,629,300, an increase of
$153,055. The bill carries $713,9R6 less than
the estimates and $90,266 less than the ap
propriation for 1898.
During the consideration of the bill Tur
pie secured the adoption of an amend
ment providing that in any reductions
made in the force of the pension office
the commissioner shall retain In the ser
vice by preference such employes as may
be honorably discharged soldiers and sail
ors or their widows and daughters.
Cockrell did not believe the condition of
the business in the pension office war
ranted such a reduction of force as had
been suggested, and said that if, after
the reduction was made, an effort should
be made to increase the force there would
be "some amusement over it."
Plattof Connecticut commended the work
of the Commissioner of Pensions and
thought from his statements before the
Committee on Civil Service that retrench
ment was made with a. sincere desire to
better the service of his bureau.
The reading of the bill occupied about
three hours, its consideration being con
cluded at 5:45 p. m. Amendments adding
$29,000 to the total amount carried by the
measure as reported to the Senate were
adopted.
The bill was passed, and at 5:30 p. m.,
on motion of Quay, the Senate went into
executive session and soon thereafter ad
journed. ________^___

RAID ON THE
LIBRARY FUND
Another Scandal for the
Los Angeles Grand
Jury.
Exorbitant Charges Said to
Have Been Made for Re
pair Work.
Trustees Will Not Pay a Bill That Is
Approved by City Electrician
Francis.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 31.â The Board
of Library Trustees has unearthed
some work on the part of City Electri
cian Ira J. Francis which one of the
Trustees to-day announced would be
laid before the Grand Jury for investi
gation. Some time ago the Library
Trustees ordered certain alterations
made in the arrangements of the li
brary. The city electrician was called
in to give an estimate as to the ex
pense of new chandeliers and altera
tions in the facilities for lighting the
library. He gave $200 as the cost of
the proposed changes. They were
made and the bill has come hi from
W. G. Hutchison & Co., amounting to
almost $6000.
The Trustees refuse to pay the bill.
They have made an examination and
an investigation, and they find that
the charges made for the work, as ap
proved by Francis, are from 25 to 100
per cent higher than the work could
have been done for in the open mar
ket. The five members of the board
are a unit in opposition to payment of
the bill, and if Hutchison & Co. ever
get their money it will either be after
they have reduced their charges or af
ter a court has held that they are not
exorbitant. . .
The present Board of Library Trus
tees is made up of I. B. Dockweiler,
Earl Rogers, E. K. Foster, W. F. Bur
bank and W. M. Garland. It has insti
tuted many reforms in the public li
brary, which have met with popular
approval. Amons other things it in
stituted a plan for civil service exam
inations for subordinate positions in
the library. In these examinations
employes were graduated according â¢*>
ability and length of service. It ab
solutely did away with favoritism and
political "pull" in influencing library
appointees.
Against this but one objection was
raised, and that was by W. A. Spaldlng
in the Herald. He is an ex-Library
Trustee and by the civil service test
some of his appointees were displaced.
However, the board instituted the civil
service plan despite Editor Spaldlng's
objection, and it has met with great
success.
The president. I. B. Dockweiler, an
nounces that the Trustees do not pro
pose to permit the library fund to be
robbed by any excessive charges, even
if those charges are approved by the
city electrician.
CHANGES IN THE
UNION PACIFIC
Receivership Terminates and
the New Company Takes
Control.
Edward Dickinson Remains as Gen
eral Manager, and There Are
Only a Few Changes.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OMAHA, Jan. 31.â On and after mid
night of January 31, ISM, according to the
circular issued by the receivers of the
Union Pacific, the receivership termin
ates. In a formal notice to all employes
that the receivers have turned the prop
erty over to the new company, according
to a circular issued by President Burt,
under date of February 1, the official ros
ter of the new company is given out. Only
two changes are made in the list of
names which have been familiar to all
having dealings with the overland route
during the time since 9. H. H. Clark suc
ceeded Charles Francis Adams as presi
dent.
Edward Dickinson remains general
manager, despite the many rumors of his
intended withdrawal. John A. Munroe,
freight traffic manager: Edward L. Lo
max, general passenger agent; John B.
Berry, chief engineer (to succeed George
H. Pegram, resigned), .md John W. Grif
fith, purchasing agent. are the appointees.
General Manager Dickinson announces
as the head of his official staff, E. Buck
ingham, superintendent of transportation.
He has heretofore been superintendent of
car service only. All other superintend
ents and chiefs of departments are re
tained until further notice. There are
many rumors of Impending changes, but
investigation shows that so far the dis
missal of a score of clerks from the sev
eral departments of headquarters is the
only outward sign of retrenchment.
REFUSES TO ACCEPT
PAYMENT IN SILVER
So a Prominent Democrat Will Be
Sued in Order to Test the Bland-
Allison Act.
DETROIT, Jan. 31.â A friendly suit In
chancery was begun to-day In the Circuit
Court at Pontiac to determine the con
stitutionality of the Bland-Allison silver
act of 1878. Stephen Baldwin, a Detroit
capitalist, purchased some land upon
which there is a mortgage held by Fred
A. Baker, chairman of the Democratic
State Central Committee. Mr. Baldwin
tendered 364 silver dollars in payment of
the amount due on the mortgage. Mr.
Baker declined to accept silver dollars
unless enough of them were tendered to
equal at the present bullion value of sil
ver 364 gold dollars. Accordingly suit
was begun t* obtain a decree compelling
Chairman Baker to cancel the mortgage
and accept the tender made. Ex-Con
gressman Timothy E. Tarsney is com
plainant's attorney, and all the parties
are prominent silver men and will carry
the case to the United States Supreme
Court in any event. Chairman Baker
says:
"I will contend before the courts that
the Bland-Allison act is unconstitutional,
because it does not provide for Free sil
ver. It provided only that the Govern
ment buy silver at. its depreciated price
in gold and pocket the seigniorage; yes,
legalised the stealing of the seignior
age."

HEALTH BOARD
TO INVESTIGATE
'Will Look Into the Quali
ties of Illuminating
Gas.
Supervisor Rottanzi Makes an
Attack on the Sensational
Press.
Police Instructed to Ascertain the
Speed of Electric
Cars.
The Board of Supervisors at Its meet
ing yesterday practically washed its
hands of the question of regulating the
qualities of the Illuminating gas fur
nished the citizens and rate payers of
this city and shunted the entire mat
ter on to the Board of Health.
When Supervisor Lackmann's measure
came up the course of the Examiner
and the Chronicle in urging the adop
tion of such a measure was vigorously
attacked by Supervisor Rottanzi, who
quoted figures to show that the very
coal gas that was so strenuously ad
vocated, contained from 2 to 9 per cent
of carbon monoxide, while the Lack
mann resolution called for anilluminant
containing not more than 5 per cent of
the deadly ingredient. Supervisor
Lackmann moved that the matter be
sent to the Board of Health for investi
gation and this course was adopted
without a dissenting vote.
The resolution framed by the Health
and Police Committee, pledging the
board to provide $400,000 out of the next
tax levy for the erection of a new City
and County Hospital, was passed
unanimously.
Supervisor Clinton introduced a reso
lution instructing the Chief erf Police
to detail as many men as may be
deemed necessary to watch the cars of
the various electric lines that operate
within the city limits and report
whether they run within the limit of
speed allowed by law. The matter was
referred to the Health and Police Com
mittee.
District Attorney Barnes was granted
sixty days' leave of absence with per
mission to leave the State.
The report of the Health and Police
Committee recommending: that Mrs.
Gilmore, matron of the Receiving Hos
pital, be removed and that Mrs. Welch
be given the place was adopted and the
change will take place at once.
"Mayor Phelan's bull," as the resolu
tion requiring the Spring Valley Com
pany to finish the Balboa boulevard
through its lands is often called, was
rescinded by a unanimous vote, the re
port of the committee convincing the
board that a grievous blunder had been
made.
Mayor Phelan's veto of an authoriza
tion to pay Gray Bros. $3578 08 for the
construction of artificial stone side
walks about Lafayette square was read
and took the usual course. The Mayor
admits that the work on which the bill
is based was done in a satisfactory
manner and at a reasonable price, but
claims that the contract was illegal
and that the contractors should have
known this before they took the job.
The veto is quite likely to be over
ridden at the next meeting, several of
the members of the board being: of the
opinion that the Mayor has experienced
a change of heart since he helped Con
tractor Raisch out of a similar predic
ament.

CHARTER, MAKERS AT SEA.
Are Unable to Settle the Supervi-
sorial Question.
The Freeholders are still puzzled ar.d
perplexed over the board of eighteen
Supervisors who are to be elected In the
event of the charter now being framed
receiving the indorsement of the people
and the ratification of the State Legisla
ture. When they met last night. I. Gutte
introduced a measure providing for the
dividing of the city into nine districts
and from each of these districts the elec
tion of two Supervisors; the board first
elected to so divide itself by lot that nine
members shall go out at the expiration
of the first year and nine members be
thereafter elected annually. The pro
posed section also made provision for the
election of the Supervisors by district
and not at large as at present.
The measure met with considerable op
position, inasmuch as the Freeholders
have spent several nights in attempting
to successfully solve the Supervisorial
question, and on motion of H. N. Clement
it was decided to postpone action on it
for one week.
P. A. McCarthy then introduced a sec
tion granting to the Supervisors the
power to lease all street railway lines
that may revert to the city at the expira
tion of twen^-five years under the pro
posed new nTCfhod of granting such fran
chises. McCarthy's measure provided
that such leases be for a term not to ex
ceed twenty years, and that the award
be made to the person or corporation
making the highest bid for the lease. In
the event of 15 per centum of the regis
tered voters filing a petition against the
granting of any such lease, the matter is
to be held in abeyance until passed on by
all the voters at the next general elec-
tion.
The section was referred to the legis
lative committee, with instruction to re
port at the next meeting.
The subject of Election Commissioners
was next taken up for consideration. It
was decided to provide in the charter for
the appointment of the Election Com
missioners by the Mayor. The board is
to consist of five members, who shall so
classify themselves by lot that two mem
bers shall go out of office at the end of
the first year and one each following
year, the commission to serve in future
for four years. The appointment of the
Registrar and all necessary deputies to
conduct the office will rest with the com
mission, and all salaries are to be fixed
by the board. The commission will also
have the power to redistrict the city into
precincts containing 200 voters each and
also provide for annual elections for mu
nicipal officers.
It was decided to raise the salary of
Miss C Jackson, the assistant secretary
of the board, to $200 a month.
A POLICEMAN 'S
BAD BLUNDER
Releases a Prisoner on
an Order Fixing
Bail.
Jacob, Joseph Causes Conster
nation in the Police De
partment.
Judge Campbell Comes to His Res
cue and Saves Further
Trouble.
Jacob Joseph, charged with petty
larceny, caused consternation at police
headquarters last night. Joseph was
arrested yesterday forenoon on a war
rant sworn out by Maurice Scheuer
and locked up at the California street
station. When the van containing the
prisoners from the California street
station reached the Central station
Sergeant Bidwill discovered that Jo
seph was among the missing. He at
once communicated with the officer In
charge of the branch station, who pro
fessed entire ignorance of the where
abouts of Joseph. Chief Lees was then
notified and two detectives were de
tailed to find the missing prisoner.
While they were scouring the city for
Joseph the officer at the California
street station telephoned to police
headquarters that Judge Campbell haS
released the prisoner on his own recog
nizance.
It was afterward developed that a
friend of Joseph had visited the Cali
fornia street station while he was there
and gave the desk sergeant an order
fixing bail, which had been issued by
Judge Campbell. Evidently thinking:
it was an order of release the officer
took Joseph out of his cell and told
him be could go.
The mistake was discovered a short
time afterward, but no report of it was
made to Chief Lees.
As soon as Desk Sergeant Bidwill
found that Joseph had escaped he in
formed Captain Robinson, who started
an investigation. While the police
were searching for the escaped pris
oner a friend met Judge Campbell,
and by representing that Joseph was
locked up at the California street sta
tion he induced him to write out an
order of release. He then took the or
der to the California street station, but
as Joseph had already obtained his
freedom the officer in charge, with a
significant wink, merely registered the
order on the prison blotter. Subse
quently he telephoned the contents to
Desk Sergeant Bidwill. It is said that
Joseph will appear in court when the
case is called this morning.
FIGEL MURDER TRIAL.
Only Seven Jurors Selected So Tar
to Try the Case.
Seven jurors have been selected to try
Theodore Figel for the murder of Isaac
Hoffman. Fourteen jurymen were ex
amined yesterday, and out of that num
ber two were selected, R. V. C'rosky and
H. Larsen. Those examined and excused

lpy. Otto Willweber and J. A. Kearney
were called into the jury-box in the
afternoon, but as the panel was ex
hausted and the box could not be filled,
an adjournment was taken until this
morning at 10 o'clock. Prior to the ad
journment of court Judge Cook issued
an order that a venire of fifty be selected
and instructed to be in court when the
case proceeds this morning.
FRACTURED HER LEG.
Mrs. Carrie E. Muller Tails Through
an Elevator* Shaft.
Mrs. Carrie E. Muller, 4310 Twenty-third
street, met with a serious accident yes
terday afternoon through the sross' care
lessness of some one. She had occasion
to go to the old Supreme Court building,
on Larkln and McAllister streets, to see
her attorney, G. W. Rose. The elevator
door on the ground floor had been left
open, and she stepped, as she thought,
onto the machine. It was not there, and
she fell to the basement, a distance of
about fifteen feet.
She was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital in the ambulance, and Dr. Bunnell
found that her right leg was badly frac
tured at the knee. She fortunately es
caped without any other injury.
Electric light men were repairing the
wires in the elevator yesterday, and it is
not known whether they or the elevator
man left the door open.

THE WEAK WAR ARGUMENT.
PERHAPS no proposition to abandon a historic
policy and step outside the constitution has
ever before received as much assistance from
circumstances as the proposed annexation of Hawaii
Everything has happened that can happen to blunt
and dull the sentiments of justice, consistency and
nu::.anity by an Â« p^eal to the thirst for glory which
in fighting races Kke ours is often mistaken for pa
triotism. The island oligarchy understood the situa
tion perfectly and proceeded to intrgue for an issue
with J?pan in the hope to nag that truculent nation
into a demonstration that would hre the American
heait. But Japanese statesmen saw through the pur
pose of the oligarchy and conducted themselves with
reiiMikable ici! earmce and commencuiWe prudence,
s:- that fire died out. Next came the European de
monstrations on the coast of China, and these seemed
certainly to be worth the half dozen votes which
the treaty lacks in the Senate. But, to the sober
minds of thinking Americans, "the events in the far
East" did not change right and wrong at home.
They did not make good policy that which before
was bad. They did not make constitutional that which
before had been unconstitutional. They served
rather to prove the strength of our declaration that
governments derive their just powers from the con
sent of the governed. It was observed that this de
claration was brought into plainer view by the acts
of the predatory nations, forcing upon the Chinese a
government by invasion and without their consent.
In vain was the military argument used. "The key
of the Pacific" unlocked no new reason for this un
safe departure. The possession of a naval frontier
2000 miles away, to be utilized at all only by send
ing coal that long distance to fall a prey and become
the prize on deep water of any naval power with
which we may beÂ»at war, was seen to mean the weak
ening of our defensive force rather than its re-en
forcement.
It is apparent to the merest tyro in strategy that
Hawaii must itself be defended and that it cannot de
fend us. If we take it for military reasons it must be
fortified, supplied with great guns and munitions of
war, garrisoned and patrolled by a fleet. Its fortifi
cation alone will cost our taxpayers more than the
protection of all our continental seaports. To properly
garrison it will demand a large increase in our stand
ing army, and to patrol it a like enlargement of our
navy.
Our people see in this a definite acceptance of the
policy of the predatory nations. They acquire far
lands and expand their military systems to defend and
hold them. Spain once led the world in this policy.
She seized the richest islands and principalities on
continents and flourished while she dreamed of uni
versal dominion. But fate has foreclosed its moral
mortgage. One by one these possessions slipped
away until only the Philippines and Cuba remained,
and now Spain is bankrupt in trying to restrain their
attempts to escape.
It is useless to say that there is a preserving salt
in our institutions to protect us against these conse
quences, for our entrance upon such a policy is in
defiance of those institutions.
Hawaii can furnish nothing in her own defense.
She has no coal. Make her independent and neutral.
No other nation can make a coaling station there.
A local supply imported cannot be taken by a man
of-war in a neutral port, for coal is contraband of
war and cannot be supplied by a neutral to a bel
ligerent. With no coal mines Hawaii is a better de
fense to us independent and neutral than she can
possibly be under our flag and loaded with coal to
tempt the enterprise of any naval power with which
we may be at war.
The Greenway throne is said to be tottering. For
fear some may not realize the solemn import of this
information it must be added that before this throne
society has been wont to kneel. If it is permissible
to throw in a word of advice at this crisis society
might be advised to get out of the way and let the
throne totter to absolute smash. History is full of
accounts of other thrones which have done the same
thing.
Statements that the attorneys for Ratcliffe, the
imported matinee idol and wife-beater, are worried
about his condition are the first intimations that the
man is nearly broke.
Possibly the handsome cook of Maitland Kersey,
the New York society man, caused his arrest simply
to prevent his going to Klondike, a trip too danger
ous for a handsome man of fortune to undertake.

WHAT DO THEY WANT?
ANOTHER death has been caused by delay in
providing proper fenders for the street cars.
This death, like most that have preceded it on
the roll of street car accidents, was due to the lack
of precautions which the law requires, which public
safety demands, and which could be provided by the
car companies at comparatively little expense. How
much longer are we to wait for the enforcement of
the law?
As the death of little Hulda Johnson on Sunday
was not the first caused by the lack of safety ap
pliances on cars that run rapidly through the
streets, so it will not be the last. Before many days
go by another victim will be claimed. The dread
death roll grows fast. The fenderless car is almost
as destructive as the juggernaut. It is a continual
menace to life and limb in the city, and neither man,
woman nor child knows when it may strike, so sud
denly and without warning does it come in its swift
approach.
The issue is one to be dealt with by the Super-
I visors. By the passage of an ordinance requiring the
; street car companies to adopt such fenders as the
board may approve, they have taken upon themselves
the responsibility of the existing evil. Until the Su
pervisors have specified what form of fender shall be
; used the railroad companies cannot act. The San
Mateo electric line has notified the board of a will
j ingness to equip its cars with safety appliances if the
board will decide^ what shall be used. Still the Su
pervisors have not acted. They have postponed the
subject from week to week, from month to month.
Again and again public opinion hus demanded a
remedy for the evil. .. As each new life has been
crushed out popular indignation has been .expressed
with increasing force. The urging of the people, the
insistence of the press, have alike been in vain. Al
ways the Supervisors have put . the question by. In
j the face of public clamor, in the face of an outraged
community, in the face of the horrible record of .
deaths, so rapidly increasing, they have refused to
act. Even yesterday, with the swift and awful death
of little Hulda Johnson fresh in their minds, they
again postponed the issue. â¢ : -/ ; ..-. â 'â â â -.: '.;.'. 'â ;â¢ â¢"â â â¢â ' v : ,'. - -.>.â :..' '/ ; -

are they seeking: in these continual delays
and postponements? Is there a price to

is not difficult to find some appliance that will save

public indignation grows? > y '.-â¢'./,- ''â¢'â¢>"V :; V *:â '.;â¢'â â¢â¢''
The postponement of yesterday should be the last
The Supervisors must act or the people will know the
reason why. It will be the duty of the Grand Jury
to inquire into this criminal delay. The death roll is
increasing too rapidly while the Supervisors hold put
for a price. It is time to protect the people and save
the lives of children. "',",' â¢ "' 1.
MAKING THE ISSUE PLAIN.
THE object of the silver men in taking up the
Teller resolution in the Senate was to prevent
any attempt at financial legislation in the House
at this session. They intended to serve notice that
no currency reform bill could be passed, hoping
thereby to discourage the advocates of sound money
and lead them to leave the money question vague and
uncertain until after the coming Congressional elec
tions.
Although the scheme was cunningly devised and
boldly carried out it seems now as if the object de
sired would be defeated by the very means adopted
to attain it. The Teller resolution, so far from dis
couraging the champions of national honesty and
sound finance, has roused them to action. We are
now more likely than ever to have a financial bill
passed by the House at this session. Public senti
ment in favor of such action is increasing and will
continue to increase as the importance of the issue
becomes better understood by the country.
In his bold, direct and masterly speech before the
National Association of Manufacturers President
McKinley urged immediate action with the vigor and
force of a true leader. "Under existing conditions,"
he said, "our citizens cannot be excused if they do
not redouble their efforts to secure such financial
legislation as will place their honorable intentions be
yond dispute. All those who represent the great
conservative and business interests of the country
owe it not only to themselves, but to the people, to
insist upon the settlement of this great question now
cr else face the alternative that it must again be sub
mitted for arbitration at the polls."
After these words the Chandlers and Wolcotts of
the party will in vain attempt to delude the people
into the belief that there is a divergence of opinion
between the President and his Secretary of the Treas
ury. Mr. Gage himself has never so warmly or more
strongly spoken for honest money and immediate
action. The President, it is clear, understands the
meaning of the great victory of 1896 and is eager to
go fciward and present to the country a bill that will
make the issue plain and leave no doubt as to which
party will assure the stability of our money and the
inviolability of our national obligations.
The Call has contended from the first that the bat
tle for financial reform should be aggressively fought
at this session of Congress. It noted with regret the
apparent weakening of the sound money forces at the
assembling of Congress, and has been pleased to see
their ardor increase as the session progresses. Since
the President has now spoken so clearly and so for
cibly for immediate action, it is hardly possible there
can be much further delay.
Surely Congressmen will heed the words of the
President: "Whatever effort is required to make the
settlement of this question clear and conclusive for
all time we are bound in good conscience to under
take, and if possible to realize. That is our commis
sion â our present charter from the people."
REPUBLICAN LEAGUE CLUBS.
IN preparation for the work of the coming cam
paign the California League of Republican Clubs
is arranging for a State convention to be held
prior to the national convention of the league, which
is to assemble at Omaha in June. This requires
that all clubs throughout the State which are asso
ciatcd with the league, shall begin to get ready for
the call. There is time enough for all old clubs to
reorganize, if necessary, and for new ones to form
and take part in the State convention, but there is no
time for delay.
It is a custom in this country to Â«peak of each
successive campaign as the most important in the
history of the republic, but this time the old phrase
has more than ordinary meaning. It is now certain
that nothing can be done to settle the currency prob
lem at this session of Congress, and accordingly that
problem will be the dominant issue of the Congres
sional elections. It is an issue that will affect every
man's interest as well as the national welfare and
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 1898.
honor. It therefore behooves all good citizens to
get ready to take an active part in the contest, and
the best way to do that is to organize in strong as
sociations in order to act with the greater force and
more effectiveness.
The League of Republican Clubs is one of the
best associations ever formed in the history of our
politics. The league represents no particular can
didate, and has no personal interests to advance. It
is formed solely for the purpose of bringing stanch
Republicans together and enabling them to work in
unison and harmony for the maintenance at the polls
of the great' political principles and legislative poli
cies which the Republican party represents and to
which all other parties are opposed.
The value of the league has been attested by the
arduous proof of, service rendered. The Republican
convention of this State said in its platform at the
last campaign: "We indorse the york of the Na
tional League, and the efforts of our young men to
make it a potent factor in prosecuting a vigorous
and successful campaign in this State." President
McKinley also has spoken of the value of the league
to the party and has borne witness of its services to
genuine Republicanism.
No argument nor urging should be needed to in
duce all active Republicans to ally themselves with
the State League and through it with the National
League by organizing local clubs and taking part
in the proposed State convention. This work should
be undertaken at once. It is not an easy campaign
that is before the champions of sound money. The
recent vote on the Teller resolution in the Senate
shows that body to be under control of the silver
Patists. They will make a determined effort to gain
control of the House in the Congressional elections
this year and the Presidency in 1900. Against such
opponents the Republicans must be watchful of every
['oint of the contest? The duty of the hour is to
organize. Let every Republican join the league and
prepare for the battle. .
THE SCHOOL SCANDAL.
AN investigation of the methods and practices of
the School Directors in administering the de
partment will be welcomed by the people, and
if the Grand Jury undertakes one that will be thor
ough, comprehensive and searching it will have gen
eral approval. : : ;: 'â â [ â  r â  ;
It matters not whether there is any foundation for
the alleged scandal or riot. School investigations
are always in order. We never can have our School
Department too clean, and every Grand Jury is ex
pected to try its new broom in making as good a
sweep as possible from one end of it to the other.
It is of course desirable that public officials should
not be harassed by incessant charges and investiga
tions. Nevertheless, as a general rule wherever there
is a scandal or a wide rumor of evil an examination
should be made. The public schools should be
free from all taint dif. corrupt practices, and a School
Director should be ready and willirig at all times to
assist any official investigation into any charges made
on good authority either against the School Board
as a whole or against some particular member of it.
In all cases of this kind, however, the investigation
should be radical and far reaching; It should seek
out the authors of the charges as. well as the officials
against whom they are made. If an accused official
is found innocent the examination fhould not stop at
his acquittal. The guilty accuser should then be put
on the rack and exposed as a slanderer, even if he
cannot be otherwise punished.
The recent school scandal in Los Angeles is a case
in point. Grave charges were made there against a
member of the School Board, and he found no de
fender among the newspapers of his city. He -could
rot even get a hearing for his side or the case until
The Call, moved by a sense of justice and fair play,
gave him a chance to defend himself in a written
statement. He was seemingly condemned in ad
vance, and yet when the evidence was brought out in
full he confounded his accusers and left some of them
without even a fragment of any good reputation they
may have previously enjoyed. ;
In the Los Angeles case a victory was won for jus
tice and honesty in the School Board by the earnest
ness with which The Call sought not only the truth,
but the whole truth. In that instance not only were
the innocent acquitted, but the guilty were morally
convicted. A similar method should be pursued by
the Grand Jury if it makes charges that call for an
investigation of the School Board here. Let us
have no half measures. Let us have the whole truth
so thoroughly made known that no guilty man will
escape, whether be lie the accused or the accuser.

Spitzbergen next summer. One, under Mr. Jaderin,
â will try to measure a degree of longitude; the other,
under Professor Nathorst, the palaeontologist, will
examine the waters to the west of the islands. Pro
fessor Nathorst has engaged the steamer Antartic

He will steam along the west coast of Spitzbergen,

Fat men must be on their guard when traveling on
French railroads. A 340 pound citizen of Lille who
had bousht a third class ticket, after failing to
wedge through the doors of a third class and of a
second class carriage, entered a first class compart
ment and rode to his place of destination. The rail
road sued him for the difference Â«n the fare, to
which the defense was that, having sold the ticket,
the company was bound to provide doors to the
third class carriages wide enough to admit him.
The court, however, held that he must have known
his own girth and the size of carriage doors, and
should have bought a ticket admitting him to a wide
enough compartment. It refrained from making
him pay for excess weight. ~ i *^.
INTENDED FOR A PRESIDENTIAL YACHT.
IN EVERT country, except Russia,
royal yachts are paid for out of the
public funds on appropriations passed
by law to that effect, but the Czar,
with his absolute power, simply or
ders a craft built and the country pays
for it. Since France became a republic
it no longer maintains yachts for the sole
use of its President, nor does the United
States President enjoy the marked favor
and distinction of a crowned monarch in
thi3 respect.
Yet at the very outset of building a new
navy, ten years ago, it was planned to
reserve one of the smaller vessels for his
Excellency Grover Cleveland. The cruis
ers Charleston and Baltimore were con
tracted for during the last month of 1886,
and one month later Cramp took the con
tract for the Torktown. This latter ves
sel was launched April 28 in the following
year and it was during her completion
for sea that the Navy Department, of
which William C. Whitney was Secre
tary, conceived the idea of fitting the
Yorktown with the accommodations of a
yacht.
The language of the law passed by Con
gress authorizing the construction of the
vessel was: "One heavily-armed gunboat
of about 1600 tons displacement, costing,
exclusive of armament, not more than
$520,000." The Bureau of Construction,
under date of October 25, 1887, published
descriptions and Illustrations of the ves
sels in course of construction for the new
navy and diagram No. 1, accompanying
this article, shows the original plan of
the quarters under the poop deck of tht
Yorktown.
I* conformity â¢with the idea of making
a Presidential yacht out of the craft, a
radical rearrangement in the quarters
under the poop deck was decided upon, a
plan of which is shown in diagram No. 2.
The after cabin was not extended, but
some changes were made in its arrange
ments, as will be noted by a comparison
with the original plan. The captain's for
ward cabin and the iorpedo-manipulating
room were made into one room, forty-two
feet in length, with six settees on each
side, serving as berths, and with curtains
separating each division from the one
adjoining and the general room.
In this large room three tables were
to bo located; one at which twelve per
sons could be seated and two accommo
dating eighteen each, making a total
seating capacity for forty-eight people.

this room, which might be termed a

The San Francisco Call's enterprise
in the publication and distribution of
Its Golden Jubilee Edition has won
unstinted praise all over the State.
The edition, from a literary stand
point, was a triumph of Journalism,
and its excellent resume of the mining
Industries should be preserved as a
part of the history of this State. Two
special trains were chartered to dis
tribute the Jubilee Calls. One was
started for Los Angeles and the other
for Sacramento, and the runs were
made in an incredibly short space of
time. This enterprise following 3c
closely the recent publication of the
New Era Edition is evidence that The
Call will make it interesting for its
competitors and will make them
hustle.

firbucKle New Era-
The San Francisco Call issued a
splendid Jubilee Edition last Sunday,
which was distributed to all the prin
cipal cities of the State by special
trains. It contained much valuable
reading matter and should be filed for
reference by all those wishing to
keep pace with our State's advance
ment. Such enterprise is certainly
deserving of successs.
IT SETS THE PACE.
Los Angeles Capital.
One of the greatest feats ever per
formed by a California Journal lies to
the credit of the San Francisco Call.
For the first time in the history of the
State a paper printed in San Francisco
reached Los Angeles the day of pub
lication. Last Sunday morning, at 2
o'clock, a special train, bearing thou
sands of copies of the beautiful ju
bilee edition of The Call, steamed out
of Oakland. At half-past 2 o'clock
Sunday afternoon the boys were cry
ing The Call on the streets of Los
Angeles, and it was purchased by
eager thousands. Two hours were lost
en route by the breaking of a piston
rod, so the actual running time con
sumed on the trip was ten hours and a
half. The Call is growing greater
day by day, and with its enterprise,
courage and honesty, it is setting a
pace which other journals find hard to
follow. The Call is now the most ex
tensively circulated San Francisco
paper in this city, and names are being
added to the suoscriptlon list at the
rate of 100 per day.

The Jubilee number of the San
Francisco Call was In the hands of its
Los Angeles readers at 2:30 p. m. of
the day of its publication. The ppecial
train bearing a big: coachload of this
grand number left Oakland mole at 2
a. m. on the 28th inst., and at 2:30
p. m. was placed in the hads of Its
apent at the Arcade depot. The run
of twelve hours was the fastest time
ever made over the road, notwith
standing' the delay of one and one
half hours by the breakdown of an en
gine. This remarkable feat of journal
ism indicates the stamina of the push
controlling the business department
of The Call. It takes brain as well as
money to produce such a paper as the
great Jubilee Edition and place it in
the hands of its readers so far away
to the north and south while fresh
and crisp with the rrforning news. The
compliments of the press in honor of

o THE TALE o
Â° OF A o
0 PROSPECTOR. Â°
o o
0000000000
One of the my
riad tales which
make up the story
of prospectors,
their lives and
their luck, was
told to a party
of miners at tha
Palace Hotel last evening by Tom Mc-
Donald of French Gulch, who is one of
the Shasta County crowd enjoying the
Jubilee. Mr. McDonald has been one of
the widely known mining men of the
State since ho got rich out of the Mc-
Donald mine adjoining the great Brown
Bear at Deadwood, and put a lot of his
money into San Francisco real estate.
"It was old Weaver Sebastian who
found the Brown Bear that has yielded
three or four millions," he recalled. "Ho
lived for a good many yr-ars In a cabin
in a gulch not far from Deadwood, and
was one of those fellows who live that
way, raise a few potatoes, go hunting
.md fishing, do a little prospecting and
when money is short go and wash a
few dollars 1 worth of dust out of a crock
bed. Do you know, Sebastian found that
mine fifteen years before he located it.
While out hunting one day he found a
chunk of rich float near a spring where ho
stopped for a drink. Whether it was
laziness, or what, I don't know, the cuss
just buried it there by the spring and
went on with his gun. He didn't pay
any more attention to it for fifteen years.
Then, when the Monte Christo was lo
cated on a hill near there, he remembered
that chunk of ore and went back to hunt
it. The spring had closed and opened
again a hundred feet above, but Sebas
tian found his rock and then he found
the ledge close by. He got $50,000 for the
claim that became the Brown Bear. He
came down to the city, made presents to
the girls and so on, and now is living
in another cabin up there at French
Gulch, just about as he did before he
came across his fortune."

the name of John, and whose aversion to
the truth has earned for him among the
officials of the road the sobriquet of
Ananias. On a recent trip the porter had
an experience that will last him for some
time, even if it does not effect a per
manent cure upon his inability to coma
anywhere near the truth.
John was making the western trip a
few weeks ago, when, as he tells the
story, the train stopped at San Antonio,
and an old lady with a parrot that she
carried in a large cage boarded the train.
The bird along with $2 was given to John,
with the instructions that he was to feed
and take care of it.
The porter put the parrot away in the
buffet and limited him to a strict water
diet. When Yuma was reached the next
day the old lady asked to see her pet.
John brought Polly out, and as he set
him down the old lady asked:
"You have fed him, haven't you?"
"Yas, mam; I'se feed him all he can
oat."
John turned to leave with no reproach
of conscience, but this was the parrot's
cue. Lifting up his voice he shrieked In
his high falsetto:
"He's a liar, I haven't had a cracker
for a day. Only water, nothing but cold,
damp water."
John swears that he would not take
care of another parrot even if his life
depended upon it.

COMPANIES' THREAT
"Combination Is the Only Resource Left
to Capital/ Says J. C.
Martin.
Dingee's "Agreement" Shows Its Face in a Strong
Similarity Between Two Reports
Filed Yesterday.
** Gentlemen, we are in your hands. If you. do not
:ilÂ»f <lc by the law and give us a fair rate Â©I* interest on
onr investment there is but one resource left to capital;
that it*, a combination. There is not now the remotest,
idea of these water companies combining unless forced
into it, but their money has been invested in good faith
and they have a right to expect a just return."â J. â¬'.
M4KTI.>, in an address to Oakland City Council one
year ago.
Those who remember the little episode
â¢which occurred when the City Council
of Oakland was fixing the water rates
a year ago are now wondering whether
the implied threat of J. C. Martin to
about to l>e carried out. Just what â¢
rate of interest" on their investments
the water companies, is a question that
remains to be seen. It is a fact, how
ever, that if the water companies of
Oakland were very anxious for a 'fair
rate of interest" on their investments
they would be charging all that the law
allows and not be carrying, as Presi
dent Dingee has admitted, 2000 dead
heads on their books.
With that number of water users
paying nothing and the rest of them
paying ridiculously small amounts, the
people of Oakland do not expect the
water companies to make quite as
heavy dividends from their plants as
they did before the war of rates.
But the water companies will un-
doubtedly use their incomes for the
past year as a basis on which to make
a demand of the City Council for high
er rates. The law specifically states
that the water company shall get'a fair
Income from its investment. The peo
ple do not believe that this means a
watered investment, nor does it. mean
that two or more water companies
shall combine their plant valuations
fur the purpose of making an increased
Fh"\ving of investement of capital. If
two companies can combine in this
manner there is nothing to prevent the
formation of a half dozen companies,
with inflated valuations, and then de
manding of the Council a rate that will
give a 5 per cent income from the
grand total. If there is anything in
Martin's threat it means that capital
will combine against the taxpayers of
Oakland and force the rates up.
Councilman Henneberry's contention
that there are at present no legal rates
for Oakland opens the door for all sorts
of juggling with rates, for if there are
no legal rates now then it is incumbent
upon the Council to go to work and fix
the rates according '.o lav.-. This means
that the water companies will have an
opportunity of taking the present
Council in hand and do all possible to
convince the members that the rates
are too low.
While the reports of the two com
panies filed yesterday indicate that the
water situation in Oakland is not one
that brings profit to the men who have
their money invested in the plants so
far as returns from the supply is con
cerned, there is a littfe secret history
connected with the Oakland Water
Company that tells a different story.
Of course, like all secret histories, this
can only be judged by surmise. It is
a well-known fact that $4,000,000 worth
of stock has been sold by the Oakland
Water Company. This amount of stock
leaves a large margin of profit for these
who had the manipulation of the paper
and it is estimated by the knowing
ones that something like $2,000,000 of
the total must have represented the
profit accruing from the sale of the
Piedmont Springs Water Company's
plant, for it is rather improbable that
the plant of that company should have
had anything near that vaiue, at least
that is what Oakland capitalists think
about it.
The present danger lies in that "lit
tle readjustment of inequalities" spoken
of by President Dingee. In that read
justment the doors will be thrown open
for the introduction of all manner of
arguments to induce the members of
the Council to make changes that will
end by an advance in rates to an extent
not dreamed of by the innocent ones
who think it no harm to "make a few
changes."
The water companies have not fol
lowed their usual custom this year so
far as the matter of filing their annual
statements is concerned. That agree
ment spoken of by President Dingee
has evidently gone Into effect and the
companies are no longer afraid to let
each other know what they are going to
tell the public, for both reports were
filed long before the expiration of the
time set by law.
There is a wonderful similarity in the
reports so far as the amount of busi
ness done is concerned. There is but a
few thousand dollars difference in the
receipts of the two companies and both
reports show that it has been necessary
to get money from outside of the reve
nues in order to keep things moving.
Both reports show that the operating
expenses were almost equal and both
show a falling off from their former in
comes. The Contra Costa Company
was compelled to sell 117,000 worth of
bonds while the chief stockholders of
the Oakland Company had to raise $66,
000 to help things along.
The statement of the Contra Costa
Company shows total receipts of $212,
790 13 from all sources, but from the
sale of water in Oakland for all pur
poses but $133,782 09 was received. The
Oakland company shows a total receipt
of $208,272 06, but from water sales in
Oakland but $122,630 70 was received.
This makes the total amount received
by both companies from sales of water
in Oakland $256,412 79, a little more than
half as much as the Contra Costa Wa
ter Company received four years ago
I with fifteen per cent less population to
I supply than at present. . ' "â ", .â  â¢â  . .
I : Comparison with \ the statements
filed in 1897 and 1896 shows that in 1897
f the Oakland received from water rates
($99,620 : 30, : . and in 1596 $90,641 30, so that
j its business has been somewhat better
this year than in either: of the precd
} ing ones. In 1897 the Contra Costa re
ceived for water $142,718 85, : or very
j nearly the same as this year, and in
â ! 1596 $183,736 16.-. , . '
In 1897 the total receipts of the Con
' tra;^ Costa were $204,929 92, and of the
Oakland $217,028 69.: In 1896 the Contra
Costa reported 'total receipts of $2,044,
390 97, of which $1.533.000 came' from
sale of . bonds, and the Oakland re
ported 1 $5,490 937 30, of which most rep
resented the value of the Piedmont

A STORY OF THE RAIN.
Mow the Catholic Cfiiarch Prayed For the Needed
Visitation.
Deut, in gun vivlmiu, movemur. et tumui. pluvittm nobil tribue eongruentem; ut praesentibui

[Translationâ O God, In whom we live and move and are, irant us seasonable rain;
that we, enjoying a sufficiency of support In this life, may with more confidence strive
after the things that are eternal.]
The foregoing prayer was the one offered in the ceremony of mass yes
terday beseeching rain in time to save the crops of the State.
Is there any true efficacy in prayer? Yesterday morning the Cath
olic churches throughout this archdiocese sought to demonstrate this prob
lem.
All the scheming and calculating of a thousand weather prophets cannot
induce nature to bend to their wishes, as was clearly shown by the efforts
of a local forecast official, who could not prophesy rain until he broke an
embargo of impenetrable air of high pressure in several of the Middle States.
Weather charts and mr.ps of every description were consulted by ex
perts on atmospheric pressure, but they proved of no avail in defining the
true cause of the continued drought which has hung o\er this State for the
greater part of this winter, and which now threatens the farmers of the
State. In not one instance could they make a favorable forecast of ap
proaching rain. â¢ â  â¢: : ...â¢'â¢â 
The outlook for the success of this year's crops was becoming more arid
more discouraging, and the hopes of the farmers of trying. to realize any
thing like a fair success with their wheat were rapidly being abandoned;
and they were gradually becoming resigned to the fact that they would
have to submit to the inevitable. It was at this critical moment that Arch
bishop Riordan resolved to invoke a blessing upon the farmers and have
mass said in every Catholic church under his direction In this archdiocese.
Accordingly the celebration of high mass was solemnized yesterday morning
in all the churches, without exception, and prayers were offered up to the
supreme power.
The last mass for invoking the desired rain was hardly over, when the
barometer changed and a light rain began to fall.
It was a solemn and sublime spectacle to see the congregations of the
different churches kneeling before the tabernacle praying for the blessing
of rain upon the needy farmers.

A lawsuit was yesterday instituted
in the Superior Court which will cause
no end of comment among old timers in
San Francisco and be talked about in
cessantly in circles of the First Metho

It will be recalled that the papers had
much to say when John Trubody, aged
fc-9 years, died, last Xovernber. In IS79*
when Trubody was over 71 years of age,
he married an English girl who was
fifty years his junior. This was his sec
ond marriage. By his first marriage in
1832 he had two sons who are now resi
dents of Napa County. These sons
bring a suit to compel the young widow
of Trubody to surrender valuable
houses and lands which were deeded to
her when her husband was under her
influence. The story is narrated in
the papers which D. H. Wittemore, at
torney for the plaintiffs, filed yester
day. ".. ;â 'â¢" V " : - â ' - â  : 'â ' â  : â â â  â -'.â ; â  ',':.:â¢â  "
It is set forth that the plaintiffs, W.
A. Trubody and Joslah Trubody, are
sons of John Trubody who died in No
vember, 1897. In 1848, so the legal doc
uments aver, John Trubody and the
plaintiffs went to the mines of Califor
nia and delved in the placers for gold.
They earned $14,000, of which sum the
father was to; have one-half and the
two sons the other half. In 1848 the
father bought with $8000â part, of the
$14*000â property in the city on the
south line of Washington street, near
Montgomery. The: fact is not set forth
in the papers, but is well known to old
timers, that this is the property at the
corner of Duhbar alley and Washing
ton street, and on that land was erected
the first marble-front building in San
Francisco. The marble, now much
discolored by time and blemished, was
brought from Sing Sing, and Mr. Tru
bedy. a progressive citizen of that era,
was highly commended for his enter
prise. The event was not celebrated
by a public banquet or worldly festiv
ity, as the builder was a strict Metho
dist and pave to the Lord credit for
the achievement.
The legal papers, however, do assert
that in 1849 John Trubody, with $6000,
did buy land at the northwest corner of
Powell and Washington streets. On
that land was erected the first brick
building ever constructed in San Fran
cisco. It is not a part of the complaint,
but it is believed to be a fact that the
first house of worship owned by the
Methodists of San Francisco was built
on land procured for the congregation
by Mr. Trubody.
According to the papers the first
marriage of John Trubody took place
in June, 1832. The father and mother of
plaintiffs resided and worked together
until 1877, when the first wife, the
mother of the plaintiffs, died.
In 1856 John Trubody purchased,
with the proceeds of the earnings of
plaintiffs, BSO acres of land in Napa
County at a cost of $17,000. In 1878: he
sold 700 acres of the tract: for $23,000.
The land was cultivated by the sons
on shares for the father. He constant
ly assured his two boys that each
one should have on^thlrd of his es
tate. The legal papers mentioned the
marriage of John Trubody to the de^
fendant, Ja.ne Trubody, in: 18.79. Her
maiden name is not given.
In ISB9 John Trubody, then over 81
years of age, received injuries from a
fall. According to the complaint in the
case the wife (Jane) did not leave lier
husband alone after the accident and:
neither did she permit any of his kin
or friends to see him. Gradually she
Induced him to.deed to her piece after
piece of his valuable property, until
everything in the world he possessed '/,
was conveyed to her. She handled the
affairs very well from a business point
of view and built new houses and in
creased the revenues of the estate. The
legal papers aver that she obtained the
property by fraud and undue in
fluence. The property conveyed to her
is valued at $50,000, She got the Wish- ;
ington street brick house in June, 1893.
Other pieces *he obtained at various
times. She did not get the Durtbar
alley marble front until. April 27, 1897,
That was the last parcel of the whole
' lot. â¢. .-â â¢ '; â ; â â â â 'â â ,}â â : :'â  â :'â â  â  : ~' ; -
The plaintiffs, one of whom is a Su
pervisor of Napa County, pray for
judgment of the court that said deeds
be annulled nnd canceled, and for such
further relief as may be obtained and
for an accounting of rents since the
property was obtained. :
There has been a deal of gossip about
the case since the death of John Tru
body. It is said that w-itnesses as well
known as Ralph G, Harrison and A. C:
Merrill will be placed on the Witness
â â  stand 'to testify that John Trubody
intended to give each of his sons one
third of his estate and that he had a
will prepared to carry out such inten
tion. â :â .â  ';"â  â  : , ' :\/:.r.: \/ : .r. .'!. â  : â â â ; â - . : "
Gossip goes that Mrs. Trubody â the
[ second wife, Janeâbrought the vener
able husband to : terms by refusing to
go to churcfc . Ile was a devout Meth
odist and belie -d that non-attendance
of divine worship \vas a sin: not lightly
to be passed over,, and therefore: he
i made such concessions as transfer of
worldly possessions in order to get his
young spouse to attend the worship.
It is said that proof can bÂ« introduced
to show that the mother of the plain
tiffs had money: in bank at the time of
â her death and that John Trubody did
not know of such deposit of money
until after her demise. Then he pro
cured special letfers of administration
and obtained this money.
During the early married life of John
Trubody and his first wife they gave a
home to John Smith, a man whom they
picked up on the plains. Smith died
at the brick house on Washington
street, and, having no kith or kin
whom he knew, gave all of his property
to the mother of plaintiffs. :
It is claimed that the testimony oh
the trial will show that the money in
bank belonging to the mother of the
sons, as well as the property of Smith,
went ultimately to the Second wife,
Jane, who now lives in one of the
Washington-street houses. She is still
a young widow, and, having money at
j her disposal, will doubtless put Up a
; beautiful fight to hold all that js now In
her keeping. The sons, too, are reso
lute and mean business. They claim
to be able to show- that she had nothing
when their father married her, and
that two-thirds of what she now has
belongs to them.

POLICEMEN
MAKE A
RECORD
Officers O'Mera and
Murphy Maltreat an
Aged Couple.
Mr. and Mrs. Merrin. Were
Dragged Out of Bed
and Sent to Jail.
Aroused From Their Sleep and
Charged With Disturbing
the Peace.
MRS.; ELLIOT IMPRISONED.
They Accost a Woman on the Street
and Then Arrest Her on an
Odious Charge. .
Policemen J, J. O'Mera and T\ C.
Murphy were told to don citizen's
clothing on Saturday night and go out
and make a record for themselves. If
the stories told about them be true, and
there seems--- to be no reason to doubt
them, the policemen made a record.
Shortly after midnight the two offi
cers with two others entered the Fargo
lodging house Without any authority
or warrant and treated several of the
inmates in a most abusive manner. A.
lady who occupies one of the rooms of
the house was aroused by the police
men breaking in her door. ;;
The officers struck a light In the room
and systematically commenced a
search of the place- The lady sat up
in her bed and asked the policemen
what they wanted. One of the four
leered at her and replied: "Only just
to see your pretty face.-'
The policemen ransacked the room,
using disgusting language all the time
they were there. Then they went to an
adjoining room where a woman and her
three children slept. They searched
that room thoroughly and the disturb
ance they made roused the proprietor,
Edward Merrin, who went from his
room Into the hall to see what it was
about.
He remonstrated with the policemen
for entering his house in such a manner
and asked them the reason of it. He
promised if any crime had been com
mitted by any of his lodgers he would
give all the assistance he could to the
officers. . : . â 
fin, however, received only curses
ows for his trouble and was
d down to the street and placec
arrest.
Merrin hastily threw on a wrap
per and leaving her room followed her
husband to the sidewalk an<i pleaded
with the policemen to be gentle with
the prisoner. Her pleadings, accordng
to the interpretation of the policemen
was a crime, and she was placed under
arrest.
Mr. and Mrs. Merrin were charged
with disturbing the peace, and the case
will be heard in the Police Court on
Wednesday. The prisoners were re
leased on bail. t
Policemen O'Mera and Murphy
added another arrest to their. brilliant
records on Saturday evening. Late at
night they appeared at the Central
prison with Mrs. Elliott, the wife of a
stableman employed at the Green Val
ley stables, and charged her with in
decent conduct in the streets. Mrs. El
liott has been separated from her hug
band for some weeks and she had no
friends to assist her. Judge Campbell
dismissed her from custody.
She said she was walking on Mission
street toward her home on Sixth street
when the two policemen in civilian
clothes came along. As they neared
her one of them raised his hat and said
"Good evening." Mrs. Elliott, thinking
jt was some one who knew her, replied
with a similar salute.
"Where are you going?" one of the
policemen asked as they both turned.
"I am going home," she replied.
"No you are not; you are going with
us," and the two officers took her by
the arms and led her to a patrol box
and summoned the wagon.
She remained in prison nearly two
days with the odious charge against
her. â  .' '
They Were Not Burglars.
Charges of attempt at burglary against
George Hay and David Grant were dis
missed by Judge Wallace yesterday and
the persons were discharged. They were
accused of having attempted to effect an
entrance into Barnes & Khelenbeck's
store, Mission and Eighth streets. Hay
went to trial, and owing to insufficiency
of evidence Judge Wallace instructed the
jury to acquit the defendant and order
both prisoners discharged.

the latest addition to the gasoline
fleet is <3. W. McNeaf's launch Port
Costa. The big dealer in wheat has
built his summer residence on the hills
above his grain elevators and the
launch Will carry himself and family
to San Francisco and around the bay
on many an excursion. The Port
Costa is 45 feet long, 9 feet broad and
i% feet deep. She is fitted with a?
fifty-horsepower Union gas engine, and
Air: M#Near will be disappointed If,
when down to her bearings, she will
not beat thirteen knots an hour. She
will have a long overhang deck and
Pullman berths for four will be pro
vided in the after cabin and for two
in the forward cabin. She wilt be
finished in quarter sawed oak, rubbed
and varnished, will have heavy plate
glass windows and will be upholstered
with morocco leather. As she may
be occasionally used for towing small
crafts a towing post has been put in,
but when not in use it can be made to
disappear In the after compartment
and the hole in the deck will be cov
ered with a metal plate. The Port
Costa had already half a dozen races
on her hands and in the Augusta and
America she will have two fast boats
to meet.
Captain Turner, Navigating Officer
W. E. Gunn, Ensign Peterson and a
squad of men from the naval militia
were busy at work on the sloop-ofrwar
Marion yesteTday. Fenders between
the vessel and Howard street wharf
were put out, one of the boats on the
starboard side was taken into the re
serve boathouse and the other was
brought in on deck so as to prevent any
possibility of damage from vessels
which may have to dock ahead of the
Marion. Everything will be shipshape
by the end of the week and the reserve
Will then begin to prepare for the re
ception and ball which is to be held
on board the latter part of the month.
Qreat credit is due to Chief Engineer
George Kingsland and his crew for the
manner in which they got the war
ship's: engines ready to come to San
Francisco. They did not reach Mare
Island until midnight Saturday, and
then found that a great deal of ma
chinery had been taken apart in order
to facilitate oilirig. The men went to
work with a will and by S o'clock Sun
day morning everything was in work
ing order and the vessel was ready to
start at a moment's notice.
A couple of the coasting fleet are
making long passages from the Sound.
The schooner Maggie C, Russ is now
fifteen days out from Port Gamble, and
the schooner Mary E. Russ seventeen
days from Port Ludlow. Both vessels
E.re lumber laden and the chances are
their long passages will be accounted
for by contrary winds.
The: American bark Hadyn Brown is
having a hard time of it to get to this
coast. She left Baltimore for Puget
Sound 265 days ago and twice has been
compelled to put into different ports
for repairs. On May 27 she put
Into Bermuda leaking, and it took un
til July 10 to patch her up and
get her to sea again. On September
10 she put into Montevideo with
her decks swept, boats carried away
and three of the crew washed over
board. It took until November 22 to
get her ready for sea again, and since
that day she has not been heard from.
It will take her a long time to get this
far up the coast, and the chances are
by the time she reaches her destination
she will have the longest passage on
record to her credit.
The Star line of sailing vessels, one of
the best known in England, is going
out of existence and several of its ves
sels will be owned in San Francisco,
The Star of Italy has been sold to J.
J. Moore & Co., and will go into the
Australian trade. The Star of Bengal
has been purchased by Captain J.
Smith, and will also be put in the Aus
tralian trade. The Star of Bengal is
now on her way from Swansea to
Santa Rosalia. On her arrival there,
and* after discharging her cargo, she
will be taken over by Captain Hender
son, late master of the four-masted
schooner Golden Shore, and Captain
Oliver, her present master, will come
to San Francisco on her as a passenger.
The steamer San Bias arrived from
Panama and way ports yesterday with
a few passengers and a large cargo of
coffee. At Corinto she landed thirteen
engineers who came from the East to
work on the Nicaragua canal. From
this it looks as though the work on the
canal was going to be pushed to com
pletion.
The United States steamer Adams ar
rived from Honolulu yesterday and
went direct to Mare Island. She was
twenty-six days coming, having cov
ered the entire distance under steam.
The funeral of the late Elisha Hig
glns will take place from his home In

Daisy Rowe and Glendale, four-masted
schooners Alice Cook and Robert Lew
ers, ships John Ina and Hawaiian Isles
and many others. He was one of the
best-known and best-liked men in the
shipping and lumber business in San
Francisco, and his death is a distinct
loss to the business community.

WHY?
"Why will, people attempt things for
Which they are entirely unsuited?
Why do women Worry, cry and fret,
\vhen they should be pleasant and hap
! py. most. of their time?
Why are men blue, despondent, mel

[ should be strong, hopeful, enterprising
\ and vigorous?
Why should any man or woman en
danger health, possibly life, when a lit
tle care will prevent it?
Why is the present season of the year
so depressing, enervating â the very air
filled with chills, pneumonia, grip and
all bad influences? .
Why unless the seeds of disease are
on every hand, and need to be fought
against constantly?
Why will people permit the dangers, â 
sickness and troubles, of this season to
affect their health and undermine their
life, when they can easily :be coun

Why do people not realize that the
best thingforovercoming these troubles
is pure whiskey taken as a medicine?
Why will people persist in taking im
pure, adulterated injurious whiskeyy
when so pure an article can be secured

Why will unscrupulous druggists

Animal Society Loses
and Captain De

. â 
Grave Charges and Hot
Shot of No Avail With
the Supervisors.
Martin Stevens Assails Delany
Fiercely and Is Called
to Order.
CITY MUST FIND A POUND.
Osborn, the New Master of Lost
Animals, Is Not to Be
Favored.
There was a hot battle before the j
Board of Supervisors yesterday after
noon in the question' of the control of
the public pound. The Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
lost, but not before some of the hot- ,
test velleys that have ever been fired ;
at a public official had been fired at
Captain Delany by the representatives
of the society. i
At the outset Captain Delany made
a grand play, as he stated for
the -vindication of his honor. The whole
matter concerning his honor was re- j
ferred to the Finance Committee on j
motion of Britt.
Later In the engagement Martin Ste
vens, on behalf of the society, made
bold charges of corruption. He was
called down by Britt and the Mayor
for using language too severe for the
occastoru He stopped without apology j
or modification of his remarks.
"It is commonly rumored that you
are a boodler and that you expect to j
get a rake-off when Osborn becomes â 
poundmaster," said Stevens. It was
this remark which struck the Mayor
and the Supervisors as going beyond
the limit, and the speaker's attention \
was called to the fact that his lan- j
guage was pretty rough, considering I
that he spok^ by courtesy of the board. |
He closed without apology further than i
this: :. . . j
"I don't say that I know these j
things," he said, "but the gentleman
owes it to himself to demand a thor
ough investigation and to do all In'
his power to see that the matter Is [
cleared up, if he be honest. If It be |
rushed through and his skirts be
cleared here, I promise him that the |
charges so boldly made in the public i
prints will be ventilated before another j
body." Later Mr. Stevens said the |
boodllng accusations made against the \
captain would be brought to the at
tention of the Grand Jury.
Then Delany made a speech demand-
Ing an investigation, and the whole
matter of the charges was left to the
Finance Committee, which will report
at 11 a. m. Friday. %
Later in the session the board re- ;
luctantly allowed representatives of the '
society fifteen minutes to speak on the ;
charges made against Poundkeeper j
Holbrook. Martin Stevens was the man '
selected to do the talking, and he f
began by solemnly stating that Hol
brook had never had a fair trial or
been under the Impression that he was
In any way under fire. "Although we r
are prepared to show that Captain De- [
lany and the Judges who tried this case
were unfair, we desire also to state
that we want a fair hearing now, with
out reference to the serious and most j
blighting charges made In the public j
prints," said the speaker. "We are ,
also ready to take up those or any i
other charges of corruption."
The whole question was 6oon rushed
to a vote on the motion to appoint j
Osborn in place of Holbrook. This
motion was finally carried by a large
vote, the following favoring Osborn:
Delany, Haskins, Devany, Sheehan.
Rottanzl, Stan'on, Morton, Britt and j
Rivers. i
During all the deliberations there
were many directors of the society i
present, particularly Messrs. Cole, !
Hutchinson, Stevens, Partridge, Gruen
hagen. Holmes and Seymour.
After it was announced that Mr. Os- |
born would be the next poundkeeper, |
there were some warm words. He had \
accused Holbrook of trying to get what \
he called a "rake down" on horse-shoe- j
ing bills, but Holbrook explained that
the charges were wholly false and that |
the trustees knew all about the circum- i
stances, and that there could be no ]
semblance of truth in any of these mat- .
ters.
President Cole of the society was
seen at his home after the decision of
the Board of Supervisors. He said: â¢ i
"I am not authorized to speak for the '<
board, but I will say that I do not see ;
how we can ever stand Osborn. We :
did not care to make any charges j
against him, but he cannot give satis- I
faction. I do not think the trustees '
will allow the city to use our premises
â with a man like Osborn in charge. We i
have lost the fight and that settles it
until there is another board. It is hard
to say what we will do with out prop- I
erty. We may lock it up and await i
better boards, or we may sell the prop- j
erty and go out of business entirely, i
There is no question whatever in my
mind that Osborn is a stench in the
nostrils of the board. He cannot use
our pound nar conduct the affairs of the j
city there. It is a clear loss of our !
fight."
"If Captain Delany says he never j
talked with me on the bribery ques- i
tlon," said Mr. Wadham of the society |
to a reporter, "he is a common liar. I.j
will swear to my charges and make j
them to his teeth. He cannot frighten !
me nor intimidate me in any manner.
I will be more specific. The remarks j
were made one day last November, j
when I called on him at the store \
where he is employed to see that other j
people do not steal. He is some sort
of a floorwalker at the J. J. O'Brien
â tore. I think he is a crooked boodler
and T shall make my charges boldly
before any court or any body of citl
zÂ»nn." _____^___^

Outside Companies to Be Authorized
to Transact Business Im
mediately.
Insurance Commissioner Andrew J.
Clunie has at the present time a big
fight with the insurance companies and
particularly with that organization or
"compact," a.s he calls it, known as the
Board of Fire Underwriters of the Pa
cific. The fight began about five
months ago, when letters were sent by
him to the seventeen New York com
panies doing business here, calling their
attention to the fact that under the
laws of New York certificates of au
thority issued to companies organized
under the laws of States, other than
New York, and doing business there,
absolutely expired at the end of a year
from the date of their issuance. Also
that by such laws entire discretion was
vested in the Insurance Commissioner
of New YoTk as to whether any such
company should be permitted to do
business in that State; and that the
effect of the retaliatory law of Cali
fornia was to subject New York com
panies doing business here to the same
obligations. Notices of a somewhat
similar nature were also sent to local
agents of Pennsylvania and Connecti
cut companies.
From their knowledge of the feelings
of the Commissioner they evidently
felt that these regulations were direct
ed at the "compact" and were fearful
of making applications for annual li
censes, apprehending that the same
would be denied on account of their
affiliation with the "compact," and in
stead set about to arrive at an amicable
understanding with the Commissioner.
As a result Attorneys T. C. Coogan
and W. S. Goodfellow were named by
the Board of Underwriters as the
board's representatives, with full
power and authority to represent the
organization.
To this end negotiations were carried
on for some time, finally resulting in
an agreement embodied in the follow
ing letter written by the Commis
sioner to President Haven, with the
assurance of Mr. Goodfellow and Mr.
Coogan that the same would be accept
ed by the Board of Underwriters:
Office of the Insurance Commissioner, State of
Californiaâ San Francisco, Jan. 22, IS9S.
Charles V. Haven, President Board of Fire
Underwriters of the Pacificâ Dear Sir: Shortly
after my assumption of the duties of this office
I conceived it to be proper that I should under
take an investigation as to the reasonableness
of rates ot premium charged for Insurance
against loss by nre throughout this State, with
n view, if possible, to secure some relief for
property owners should It be found that the
rates were more than compensatory to the
companies engaged in the business. . : ,
At the outset of my inquiries I ascertained
that there existed in this State an association
known as the Board of Fire Underwriters of
the Pacific, composed of most of the companies
authorized to do a fire Insurance business In
this State, and of which you are the president.
The objects and powers of this association are
set forth in article II of lta constitution, a*
follows: 'â â ';â 
ARTICLE 11.
Its function shall be the regulation of:
1. Rates of premium and policy forms, ex
cepting rates of premium on property located
in the State of W ashlngton.
2. Prevention of rebates.
5. Compensation for business.
4. Premium collections.
6. Agency appointments.
In the following districts:
District Aâ San Francisco.
District Bâ California (except that part in
cluded in Districts A and C), Nevada and
Alaska.
District Câ Southern California, comprising
the Counties of Santa Barbara, Ventura, Los
Angeles, San Bernardino, Orange, Riverside
and San Diego and Arizona.
District Dâ Oregon, Washington and Idaho.
District Eâ Montana. â '.*.#.
District Fâ Utah.
This association virtually controls the entire
fire insurance business of the State, and In the
fixing of rates its power is absolute. Under its
rules no member is permitted to effect Insur
ance except at board rates, and obedience to
this rule is enforced through heavy penalties.
To the mind of one not instructed In the nice
ties of the Insurance business this combination
or compact, Judged from the constitution and
rule?, presents all the features of a trust, and
Its objects, viewed from the same standpoint,
appear to be those usually had in view by the
organizers of trusts to force from those re
quiring the articles governed by the trust a!l
the traffic will bear.
On the part of the organizers of this asso
ciation It is claimed that its maintenance Is
essential to the protection of the Interests of
both the Insurer and the Insured; that by
means of it the expense of fire insurance writ-
Ing is reduced to a minimum; that through it
data are obtainable essential to be had In order
to fix rates upon any proper basis, and that
as a result of the combined experience of its
members and the data thus obtained the fixing
of rates of premium will in the future be based
upon scientific principles; and I am moreover
assured that It Is the intention of its mem
bers to so fix rates as to ultimately secure to
the Insured the desired protection at the lowest
rates possible In order to effect reasonable
compensation to the company for the risk in
volved.
These statements appear fair and reasonable
upon their face, and if the workings of the
association are on these principles It may be
that much good can be accomplished for all
concerned.
Various conferences have been held between
representatives of your association and my
self, and while our respective views of the
powers and duties of thts department are
widely divergent, it has been suggested that
we act together in the establishment of rates,
that a careful study be made by me of the
constitution, rules and transactions of the as
sociation and that when able to understand
lngly do so I make such recommendations
concerning the reductions of rates of premiums
throughout the State as to me may seem right,
with the understanding that such recommen
dations. If made in a spirit of fairness and
Fupported by facts warranting their con
clusions, shall be adopted.
I have already been furnished by you with
copies of the constitution, rules and appendix
of the association, and have made a somewhat
thorough examination of each and have found
therein several features which I believe to be
inimical to the interests of the citizens of the
State, and not compatible with the designs of
the association as represented to me by Its
organizers. These matters call for Immediate
correction as a preliminary Condition to any
concerted action between this department and
your association.
One of the constituent elements going to
make up the rate of charges for premiums on
all fire rinks now In force in the city and
county of San Francisco is a certain percent
age for brokerage. The amount at present es
timated for this purpose I understand to be
between 10 and 15 per cent of each premium
received. This amount forms no part of the
net Income of the company, but is supposed to
be part of the cost of writing the risk, it be
ing paid to the middle-man acting between
the Insurer and the insured. Prior to the for
mation of your association the broker and his
customer were permitted to make such agree
ments concerning that part of the premium set
aside for brokerage as they saw fit and the
rate of premium was frequently largely re
duced to the Insured by reason of rebate al
lowed from this brokerage. Section 3 of article
6 of your association provides as follows:

THE SA^ FRA^STGISGO CAJjL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 1. 1898.
WHOSE BABY WILL BE N EXT ?
Grief- Wrung Hearts in the Home Bereaved by the Latest
Fenderless Car "Accident."
IN eight years ther,e have been fifty
nine daalhs In San Francisco due to a
lack of fenders on street cars. Since
the first of this young year of '98 three
people have been killed, their lives for
feited to the nlgÃardly god who Is wor
shiped by corporations.
It's an old story, this, of accidents
which need never have occurred, of suf
fering that might have been prevented,
of life-long sorrow inflicted unneces
sarily, stupidly, wantonly. It's an old
story to the ordinary newspaper reader,
but seven times every year it comes with
all the force of novelty upon some one;
some one who has read with easy,
quickly passing sympathy of the victim
before the last. But now it is some one's
well-beloved who is last on the list, and
his own experience teaches him to realize
what others haA-e endured.
The last one to-day Is a falrrhaired
little girl, a baby not yet 3 years old.
And to the father and mother has Come
in an enlightening agony the knowledge
of what all this newspaper talk about
fenderless cars means. William Johnson
and his wife understand the question
thoroughly now. It is exquisitely sim
plified for these two unhappy people. To
them a fenderless car means the sudden
crushing out of a young life, the sicken-
ing thought of a child's suffering, the un
endurable memory of a baby's trust and
loving faith in those in whose charge it
is turned to doubt and reproach and
awful fear.
"I can't blame myself," says the poor
mother. She doesn't weep now; but there
are unshed tears in her low, trembling
voice. "She had left me only a minute,
two minutes before.
" 'Where are you going?' I asked her.
" 'In the yard," she said.
"And not five minutes after that my
little boy ran and asked me where Hulda
was.
"'She's In the yard,' I said.
" 'No, she Isn't," he answered, his face
white with fright. 'She's killed. She's
run over by the cars.'
"I went out into the street, but I was
afraid to look, and then, when the people
came in to me I knew it was my child
nobody else's."
Poor woman! For a moment she had
hoped that some other busy mother and
not herself had lost the pet of the house
hold. .*â :::..â ;, .. .â â ;â â .. â  " ;,.;â . ,-./ ;.- .T^'.'' ' ;
"But now," she went on, wrapping and
unwrapping her hands in the little shoul
der shawl she wore, "now we must bury
her first. We can't think of anything
else yet. But why shouldn't the street
car company pay for their stinginess,
their cruelty? It cari-t bring my baby
back :to me, but it may make them more
careful and save some other woman's
babyâ if mine couldn't be saved,"
"But it could," said the father. He was
Fitting bent forward in his chair, in that
weak, bowed attitude a strong man, and
particularly a laboring man, adopts, his
idle hands clasped and his head drooping.
"People on the sidewalk waved to the
mptorman when the car was twenty feet
from the baby yet. But he didn't stop."
"No; I wouldn't blame motorman,"
said the mother gently. "Poor man, he
must do what the company tells him.
The cars go flying past here. He couldn't
stop, 1 think." \: : : â¢ .!
These two love to talk about the little
one, Sho was the baby, for one thing,
the only girl , and she' d such a sweet ,
merry temperament that the neighbors
had grown to note with an eye-caress
the pretty little ; ilgrure in its blue ging
ham apron, the warm gray woolen guimpe
the bright red short cape and the snug
small hood from which the flaxen curls
escaped in straw-like tangled bunches/
"I could trust her so," said the mother
I bate, discount, commission, abatement, pecu
! niary or other valuable consideration shall be
paid or offered directly or .indirectly to any In
; cured person, firm or corporation, or to his or
I their agent, O r to any person not authorized
j by the terms of this constitution to receive It."
Penaltyâ "For each violation of thlÃ section
I the penalty shall b* the cancellation of the
I policy or policies, and the prohibition to write
I or place within one year the risk or risks cov
i ered." . â 'â  . ;â ' .
I And stipulation 3of the agreement which you
' require each broker to sign is as follows:
"Not to pay or offer to pay any rebate, dis
' count, commission or abatement of premium
:to any person, firm or corporation whatso
i ever directly or indirectly, nor make of offer
i any pecuniary or other valuable Inducement
I to obtain buslneÂ»." . . ,
| These provisions are Intended to prevent the
i Insured obtaining the benefit Of any rebate
I satisfactory to himself and the broker. This
I to my mind Is wrong. The money when earned
. belongs to the broker and not to the company,
i and what the broker Bees fit to do with hia
i own money does not seem to me to be any
1 affair either of the association or its constltu
i ent companies. ; / . â¢ ':â '.'â â .â "â â â¢.
It is mainly In the city and county of San
} Francisco that the system of brokerage pre-
I vails. Throughout the interior of the State of
I California the broker's place is supplied by the
| local agent, whose compensation is a certain
! percentage of the premiums received. The
I same prohibition against rebating Is placed
I upon him as upon the broker, and virtually
I the same agreement Is exacted from him. The
! same objection applies to this prohibition as
i to that placed on the broker and its abroga
tion Is likewise required.
Under present conditions no benefit is se
cured to the Insured by dealing directly with
the insurer. The rate of premium charged by
the company, whether placed through a broker
|or directly by the Insured, Is the same. If
placed by a broker the company pays him 15
per cent of the premium: If placed by the in
sured no allowance Is made, but that part of
the premium estimated for brokerage is con
sumed by the company In addition to the
amount originally set aside In the rate for its
profit. Absolutely no Justification exists for
] this. The only attempted excuse offered for
it 1b that to allow the 15 per cent to the policy
holder would Jeopardize and Interfere with the
business of the broker. There should be and Is
no disposition to prevent any one hiring a
broker to place his insurance if he so desires.
At the same time if there exist persons seek
j ing Insurance, who, from economical or other
I motlvep, are desirous of transacting their own
j insurance business, common Justice requires
I that they should reap the benefit of that
! originally set aside to pay for the service they
! are rendering. It seems to me that the mere
j statement of this proposition Is Its own vlndl-
I cation. Some plan should be devised to ob
viate this injustice.
In conclusion permit me to assure you that
| the suggestions made herein are ones believed
I by me to be for the best interests of the people
of the State, and If acted upon by your asso
ciation It wtll afford me the greatest pleasure
] to co-operate with you In an endeavor to se
j cure reasonable rates of premium for Insur
ance in this S' â â¦? sufficient to enable the com
panies to maiit a fair profit on their lnvest-
I ment, which should be all that they desire.
Respectfully yv.jrs. ANDREW J. CLUNIE,
Insurance Commissioner.
The letter v.-as sent on January 22,
and no answer has been received there
to. The Commissioner believes that by
this long silence the underwriters have
broken faith with him. He now con
siders himself released from all obliga
tions to make any concessions to what
he terms "this insurance trust." He
declares his intention of using every
power of his office to work its dissolu
tion.
The order made by Commissioner
Clunle last Saturday declared Invalid
and insufficient not only the bonds of
the foreign companies, from whom the
larger amount Is claimed for back
taxes, but also those of the different
American companies mentioned, and
until these bonds are renewed these
companies stand in the same position
as the foreign companies, which the
Commissioner declares are doing busi
ness here Illegally, and upon their ap
plications for renewals of bonds all the
questions before raised and also the
legality of their membership In the
board will be tested.
The attitude of the Commissioner Is
further shown by his statement made
last evening that he will to-day accept
in renewal bonds from the Continental
Insurance Company of New York, the
Merchants' Insurance Company of
New Jersey, the American Insurance
Company of Boston, the Northwestern
National Insurance Company of Mil
waukee, none of which are with the
underwriters and which are pledged
not to Join.
The determination of the Commis
sioner to carry the war Into Egypt was
no doubt intensified by the position of
the insurance companies which are
jjinder his displeasure. The Board of
with wistful pride. "She used to go er
rands for me. Why, yesterday morning I
she went for milk."
Think of this blithe, busy baby of two
years trotting off to the dairy or the
grocer's.
"But she never crossed the street. Yes,
just once she did. But Iâ l punished her,"
the mother's voice broke, "and she prom
ised me she'd never do it again.
"Something attracted her, you see. She
was laughing when she came In to me
that last time, and said something about
a funny dog. 'Such a funny dog,' she said.
I suppose she was running after the dog
whenâ when the car struck her."
If you have a maid for your baby girl,
madam, you may be inclined to censure
this poor woman for neglect of her child.
If your baby has the sheltered corner of
some near-by park, your own sunny gar
den for her play-ground, it may seem to
you incomprehensible that any mother
would permit her two-year-old child to
play upon the street. But for one child
bo fortunately placed, so well cared for,:
as your own, there are thousands of Hul- j
da Johnsons, loved as tenderly and as
devotedly.
The children of the poor must play j
upon the sidewalk. The home nestâ and
the Johnsons' home is in a basement
early becomes too small for these sturdy!
fledglings. They seek air and light and
adventure. They seek air and light and j
so logical, when is fear of punishment so t
strong as to prohibit a child from follow
ing joyously, blindly, confidently tne
thing it desires?
Babies will continue to play upon the
sidewalk south and north of Market j
street, too. And they will be allured out 1
beyond the limit mothers set for adven
turous, toddling fe/et in spring-heeled
shoes. The very boundary that is or
dained will In itself tempt them further.
Are these pretty trespassers, these tiny j
malefactors, to be judged by a Draconian |
law, while for adult sinners church and;
State preach clemency? Every car with
out a fender may be destined to crush the ;
life out of some smiling child, eager for
freedom, mad with the delight of unac
customed unrestraint. It needs but a slight
thing to excite a child's curiosity. Then !
hey for the other side of the street, ]
where, everybody knows, the keenest
pleasure is! Snould this golden-haired,
baby-faced adventurer slip on the cobole
stones: should he, all enthralled with the
glamour of discovery, intent on sight
seeing, be deaf to the clangor of bells ;
should he, paralyzed for a moment by
fear as the onrushlng car comes nearer;
and nearer, hesitateâ as Baby Hulda did ,
yesterdayâ there will be the same hor
rible mangling of another tender body,
the same bitter, never-ending regret in
another mother's heart and the same

There will still be accidents as the city
grows older and more populous and more
streetcar-ridden; but these are the
things that cannot be guarded against. ;
The newspapers have preached the mer
ciful gospel of the fender, but the slaugh
ter of the innocents continues. However,
in time the streetcar companies will
i themselves provide the remedy. The
campaign of education on what a fender
less car can do is being conducted so ably,
so perseverlngly and so unfalteringly that .;

beginning of the end. This poor little i

mother will retain their places near the
foot of the cruel list. Th/ro will not be
many successors to their suffering and
sorrow. This baby's death has done
j much for the safety of other children.,

Purpose.
A Widow Who Dsclares She Was
Only Making Brandy for Medi
cinal Use.
United States revenue officers discov
ered an illicit still In Livermore Valley
a few days ago, which has been in opera
tion for a number of years. .
Mrs. George True, a widow, was the
owner of the raided place. She denied j
that she had kept the Government out of j
what was justly due it.
Acting under instructions, G. E. Russell |
and F. A. Fletcher, revenue officials, went
to the scene of action disguised as farm
ers. : While Mrs. True r s attention was oc
cupied with other matters, the disguised
officers managed to reach the cellar of
her house, and found a. few barrels of
brandy stored there. A test was made of
the contents of one of the barrels, and
it was found to be different from what
the United States certificate on the barrel
called for. Mrs. True became aware that
her farmers had flown, and, hearing a
noise in the cellar, she arrived just in
time to see the revenue officers sealing
the barrel. She vigorously objected to
thlfl proceeding, and denied that she had
done any wrong thing. In her excite
ment, she tried to destroy a tag on an
other barrel, but was prevented.
Feeling that they had just causi for j
their actions, the officers finished "heir |
work by placing a revenue padlock on the I
cellar door and politely telling the lady
that an explanation to their superior.
Collector of Internal Revenue Lynch,
be neces sary. This the lady de- I
elded to do, and until she makes her I
explanations further steps will not be
taken.
While searching the premises the rev- I
enue officers found a still of lawful size,
sufficient to hold five gallons of liquor. \
Mrs. True denied that it had been used !
du _ r i ng the past two years.
The charges against Mrs. True are that
she sold and rectified brandy without '
sanction from the Government, boih of
which are denied by that lady. Speaking ;
about the trouble, he said: "The only
brandy I ever made was for my own use
and medicinal purposes. I may have !
given a bottle away, but it was not done
wltn the intention of conflicting with the
law."
The revenue officers feel confident that
in Mrs. True they have discovereu me ;
person who has been shipping large !
quantities of the liquor out of the valley,
utterly disregarding the fact that there
was a tax due the Government.
Mrs. Green Missing.
The police were notified yesterday of
the disappearance of Mrs. Elizabeth
Green, of 426 Eddy street. On January 21
she went to the office of Attorney Bur- ;
dett, in the Claus Spreckels building, and
drew $100, as she had been in the habit
of doing. Since then nothing has been
seen or heard of her. She is 65 years of
age, tall and rather stout, with white
hair and wore a black dress and sealskin
shoulder rape.

"Victor Durand" at the Alcazar-
Exciting Horsemanship at
th.9 OrpheUm.
By to-night, or to-morrow night at
| the latest, the little old opera house
i around the corner should be offering
entertainment that will please every
body who cares for clean nonsense
! and twinkling music. The company
was nervous last night. There were
1 drs.gs and hitches in the performance,
and time to die of drink between the
acts: but in spite of these first-night
debilities there was no questioning the
good value in the Tlvoli's "Pearl of
| Pekin." The production is generous,
clever, arid in many ways artistic. The
play Itself is full of Jollity; to be sure,
some of the jokes and interpolated
songs are not making their first ap
| pearance on earth, but on the whole
; the book is better than those acrobatic
! hair-raisers that are thrown at us
; nowadays, and the musicâ all of it
â  that is Leeoeq's . and some that is
Kirker'sâ is delicate and humorous^ as
| we seldom find the lighter music of to
j. day. , â  â â :.. .. : - ... â â '
1 missed "The Pearl of Pekin" when
â  Louis Harrison presented it here some
seven years back, and I am not famil
iar with Lecocq's operetta "Fleur de
The." from which it is Americanized
by "Gus" Kirker, the kept composer
. of the New York Casino "Reviews," so
I everything- was new to me last night,
that Is everything except a song or
two and a handful of gags that had
dallied with my auditory nerves in
â  other shows, and I spent an evening
of comfortable good nature. Unlike
"Brian Boru" "The Pearl of Pekin"
pretends to nothing that it is not. You
i do not come away from it with a griev
ance. I can recommend It to anyone
who wants to digest his dinner with
something/that is light and picturesque.
;â â  I found it also a refreshing contrast to
"The Girl From Paris." There are legs
in "The Pearl of Pekin," of course, but
they are candidly set forth in pink
tights and they are those trusty Tivoli
legs that we have learned to look upon
openly and unashamed. Miss Hall is
the one instance of naughty lingerie,
but she contrives to leave something to
the imagination. Miss Hall was one
' of the nervous ones in last night's per
; formance, and her symptom was over
work; a little less effort will produce
more effect, for the part of Flnette is
right In Miss Hall's line, I think, if
she will only ease up a bit and try
tp see some of the fun herself.
Miss Walcott also was nervous, but
with entirely different effect, her natur
ally timid temperament at times as
sumed the proportions of actual fright.
However, modesty Is too rare a stage
! accomplishment to be wantonly dis
| couraged, and a little of it is very
pat to the part of the coy little Chi
nese bride.
If Edwin Stevens was suff erlngr from
any of the ills of an opening,
it was not patent. He was en
tirely himself, and more than half
the fun of the performance. Tyfoo,
although the longest and slimmest of
the many Mandarins of comic opera
China, is, in the parlance of the "pur
feshioh," a fat, fat part, and Mr. Ste
vens gives to it the best of that im
perious mirth of his. He missed only
once last night, and that was in a
drunken scene which was long and la
bored. Mr. Leary is not very fortu
nately cast as the Japanese, but at
least he does not overdo. Phil Branson
is the same old explosion, perhaps
varied a bit by his efforts at a French
dialect. An exceptionally happy epi
sode is the "Chin Chin" quartet, sung
and danced by Georgie Cooper, Jennie
Stockmeyer, Grade Gray and Hannah
Davies. This, Miss Walcott's singing
of Edgar Kelley's mulberry song and
the choruses, were the especial musical
hits of the night.

A PLEASANT EVENING.
Nano Nagle Debating Club Promises

The entertainment to be given by the

times and their efforts have brought them
much applause. They have been trained
by the best musical and theatrical pro

to be one of the best that had taken place
In this city.

Lagniape Is a New Orleans word. It
Is applied to a bonus given to pur

A TRIBUTE OF
HIGHEST ESTEEM
W. J. Martin Presented With a
Beautiful Costly Silver
Set.
Western Union Telegraph Employes'
Present' to the Late Man
ager.
W. J. Martin, lately manager of the
Western Union Telegraph Company and
now business manager of The Cajl, had a
genuine surprise yesterday. QcVIW
T H. Reynolds, the popular cashier
of the telegraph company, "quested
Mr. Martin to step into his office for a
few minutes, stating that he had some
thing to say to him. As Mr. Martin en
tered the office his eye fell on a large
case, containing a beautiful silver serv
ice of seventy-eight pieces. Mr. R^ynolda
explained what it all meant, saying: Air.
Martin, since you have been with this
company you have yon the esteem, love
and respect of every employe and now
that you are about to enter other fields
of usefulness, they have taken this way
of expressing their high regard tor you
and wishing you every good that can
fall to the lot of man. They asked me to
present this to you in their behalf.
Mr Martin was silent for a moment,
and in a few words, which did not con
ceal his emotion, he expressed his tnanKS
to the donors for their elegant remem
brance of him. He added: "I hope the
time will come when I will be able to
own a home in keeping with this beauti
ful present, for then I will have every
one of these, my friends, come and dma
with me."
Thus was the presentation madeâsim
ple and informalâ but it was expressive
of the high regard of nearly 100 employes
of the big telegraph company. A little
later Mr. Martin went among his friends
and told them how much he appreciated
the gift and how unexpected it was to
him.
On the corner of the case, which is or
oak, is a gold plate, bearing the inscrip
tion, "Presented to W. J. Martin by the
employes of the Western Union Tele
graph Company, January 31, 1898."
Mr. Martin severs his connection with
the company after many years' service,
coring which he worked himself from the
lowest to the highest round of the ladder.
He began his experience at the keys in
Salinas, where he soon became manager.
Later on he held similar positions in San
Jose, Stockton and Sacramento/and when
he came to this city he became the chief
operator. From this position he mounted
to that of the highest, which he has Held
for the past three years.
Mrs. Porter's Gum Drops.
James Miller, who claims to have the
only right to dispose of candies In the
Grand Opera House, is annoyed at the
statement made by a Mrs. Porter that
"gum drops" she had eaten in that place
were what caused" her illness. He denies.
In the first place that there are any gum
drops sold at the theater. He says he has
ascertained that the lady had partaken
of a hearty Spanish dinner previous to
going to the theater, and to this he at
tributes her illness rather than to thÂ©
"gilm drops."EXIT THE

Society Belles Despondent at
the Misfortune Which
Awaits Them.
TO APPEAR IN "OUR FLAT."
First Ho Wrote Plays and Now
Ho Wants to
Act.
George de Long, the popular society ;
man and leader of the cotillon, is go- j
Ing upon the stage.
He will make his debut under an as
sumed name, and will play a part :
which has not one dancing step in it.
In fact, the society man is not going
to roly even a little bit on his great
social successes, his unusual aptitude
he deux temps or his talent and
tn executing and selecting intri
cate figures for tlfe German. There
will be no Lily Langtry nor Cora Pot
ter tactics about his debut. The name
that i? always kept in type, for con
stant use in the social column, is to
be dropped and a nora de theatre, that
no bribe can prevail upon the gentle
man to disclose, will be adopted in its
stead.
In a modest little road company, with
Leila Burton* daughter of CoJonei
'â t-Tge Burton, as the very capable
head, George Long is to make his
initial professional bow. He is to play
Vane in "Our Flat," and only his own
greatness may save the thankless part
from utter oblivion.
For some weeks the nimble-toed beau
has been rehearsing his part, and
though he has been observed to sneak
off between dances and mutter and ges.
ticulate in a wild and awful manner.
still he manages to carefully guard his
secret, until the proverbial "little bird"
discovered the fact, and â society lost a
beau and the stage gained an embryo
actor.
Ten minutes after the "little bird"
whispered the tale society was astir.
First the buds and the belies and ev.-n
the matrons were despondent to the
verge of tears, but after some little re
flection, when it began to dawn upon
them that â perhapsa? Montmorenoy Al
gernon de Vere â their favorite dancer,
might electrify the world, and that his
halo of glorious light mitrht cast a fee
ble ray in their direction, their lace
mouchoirs were quoted at a premium,
bright eyes shone again, and the sweet
young things who make up the army
c f dear matinee girls went out and .
bought reams of scented, tinted, note
t taper.
And the hero of all this commotion
and future devotion emphatically de- j
nies all knowledge of a stage debut.
Broadhurst, author of "What Hap
pened to Jones," says De Long ap- ;
proached him on several occasions,
anxious to join the company in which
Corson Clarke is to star, but De Long
denies it all.
Miss Leila Burton admits that De >
Long is rehearsing with her daily, but i
De Long says there is some misunder
standing, and with gentlemanly tact
denies it all. v : I
And so the matter stands. The ma- j
jority says, "Yes," the minorityâ in this
case De Long himselfâ says emphatic- \
ally upon his "word of honor as a gen
tleman," "No!"
Mr. de Long, a year or more ago,
took enough time from his social duties .
to "dash off" a play in seven acts and
seventeen tableaux. Managers, how
ever, could not be made to see the!
many excellent qualities of De Long's
play, and the only hope of a produc- j
tion appears to be in the dim and dis- j
tant future, when De Long will be ft; I
great star and possibly a great man
ager as well.
VINING AND
THE NICKELS
He Refuses a Half-Fare Rate
to Schoolchildren on
Jubilee Day.
>frhe San Francisco and San Mateo
Electric Railway Act 3 More
Generously.
E. Potentate Vining, the mighty ruler
of Huntington's street railway system, j
has again given an illustration of his !
avaricious tactics in the management of |
the system over which he i.s a self-con
stituted Czar. The aforesaid Vlnlng has ;
a great deal to answer for since he was j
imported from the East, mainly for the
purpose of harassing a patient and long- J
suffering public, and he has had the, to I
him, extreme- pleasure of "turning- down" j
a large number <jf applicants for small
favors; but the latest ones who have had j
to submit to the reversal process were |
the pupils of the Horace Mann Gram- j
mar school, and they asked for so little
that it seems a pity that Pooh Bah Vin
ing could not sew his way clear to the
granting of the modest request.
Miss Beckwlth, one of the vice-princi
pals of the school, had the temerity to
face the despotic Vining and ask that
the pupils of the school who were to take
part in the Jubilee day parade be granted |
a half-fare rate on that day, knowing
that such a concession would be grate
lully received by their parents, as the
children were obliged to ride three or
four times. Miss Beckwltta was not ad
mitted to the managerial presence on her
first visit, as he was very busy Assuring
on how to cut not fares but expenses in
half, and she had to state her business
to the attendant in the outer office, who
after repeating it to his commander-in
chJef, came back saying that the request
for a half-rate to the children could not I
be granted under any consideration.
The lady gracefully withdrew, but yen- i
tured once more, and was finally ad
mitted into the presence of the tiger on
the next day. On repeating her request
..Mhe imperturbable Vining informed her,
r Tvith frigid haughtiness, that "such a
concession was impossible of consumma
tion."
Then she applied to Superintendent Mc-
I^negan, of the San Francisco and San
Mateo Electric Railway, and he not only
granted the desired half-fare rate over
his road on Jubilee day, but extended the
privilege for the rest of the week, and
THE FAIR A GREAT ATTRACTION.
I
THE Mjning Fair is proving a
greatdr attraction than its pro
motors anticipated. Hundreds of
visitors crowded into the great
building yesterday and none were dis
appointed at the display. Nearly all
the exhibits are in place, and every one
of them had its share of visitors.
The displays from the mining coun
ties, showing the wealth and develop
ment of their mines, continue to be the
chief attractions. Their exhibits are
arranged with good taste, and every
feature of the mining industry in the
State is shown. j
A pretty feature of the exposition is I
a litter of St. Bernard pups that were
brought from Irvington yesterday, and
given a place with the Klondike ex
hibit. The pups are about eight weeks
old and they have become the special
favorites of the ladies who visit the
fair.
It was decided yesterday by the man
agers of the fair to open the exposition
on Sundays. President E. A. Denicke
of the Mechanics' Institute was the
author of the radical innovation, and
as he holds a high position among the
German residents of the city it was de
cided to call the first open Sunday
night "German night." The German
societies have been asked to assist in |
the entertainment for that evening, |
and it is proposed that the combined
German singing societies give a con
cert on that: evening. :
The feature of the entertainment last
night was a caramel-wrapping contest.
It was between eleven girls in the em
ploy of Louis Saconi & (.'<>. Each girl
that this was appreciated by all con- !
cernod goes without saying.
The company issued tickets in the form |
of a pass, and thf se were purchased for
â '6 cents each by the pupils, who wt?re_al
lowÂ«d as many as they needed. The
ticket was punched oh the first ana sur
rendered an the second or return trip,
thus making each fare 2- 2 cents.
Over 1500 tickets were bought i>y thÂ«Â»

der are cropping up. The most promi
nent of these thus far mentioned are
Frank Miller of Sumner Post, Sacra
mento; Colonel George Stone of George
H. Thomas Post and 90l Cahen of James
A Garfield Post of San Francisco; Frank
W < ushir.g of Admiral Porter Post, Oak
land All of these have merits to com
mend them and strong friends to support
their claims. Colonel Stone established
for himself- a brilliant record during the
war having entered the service as a pri
vate soldier when the first shot sounded
the alarm and served continuously for
five years, reaching the grade of lieuten
ant-colonel in command of his regiment,
and it was he who marshaled the grand
McKinley parade just before the last
election. , .
Sol Cahen was for three years in the
ranks of the Third California Infantry
and for years has been prominent in mer
cantile circles in this city. Frank Cunh
ing now occupies a position of import
ance in the Custom House at this port
and Frank Miller Is president of the
nn.tior.al bank of D. O. Mills, Sacramento.
No man In California has boon more
helpful to comrades In a silent and gentle
way than Frank Miller of Sacramento.
He was a candidate for department com
mander at the Salinas encampment last
spring, but yielded to General N. P.
Chipman.
SWALLOWED CARBOLIC ACID.
Mrs. Nordin Found Dead With Her
Four Children Crying Beside
Her Body.
Mrs. Annie Nordin committed suicide
last evening by swallowing carbolic acid
at her home, 4075 Nineteenth street. Her
husband, who Is a carpenter, returned
from his work yesterday evening and
found that she had not prepared supper
for him. He left the house and went to
a neighboring restaurant to get somo
thing to eat, and on his return found his
wife lying on the floor dead, with h<>r
four little children clustering around her
crying.
Mrs. Nordin. was a native of Ireland 30
Xt-ars old. The supposition is that the
cftuple had some words over her failure
to have the evening meal ready on his
return, and the quarrel was the cause
of the woman's act.

RUMOR SHIFTS
POLICE CAPTAINS
A Report Circulated That
Significant Changes
Will Be Made.
j Commissioners DenyThatThey
Will Take Place in the
Near Future.
I . _____ / . . ;
It Is Conceded, However, That Such
a Plan has Been Sug
gested.
Members of the Police Department
who wear shoulder straps ,and chev
rons in indication that they have
reached an altitude beyond that of a
patrolman are at present anxiously
discussing certain changes rumor sayb
will take place at the meeting of the
Commissioners to-morrow night 'â "'â â â '.\
It is reportedâ where the report ema
nated is not knownâ that "in order to
drag them from a groove, out of beaten
paths," a majority of the captains and
sergeants will be shifted. Two years
ago sergeants and corporals changed
stations, but nothing was thought of
the matter. A similar move on the
part of the Police Commissioners at
this time would cause no surprise, but
the report that captains as well as un
der officers are to be changed has in
augurated a speculative discussion that
only time can cause to cease.
Captain Wittman, now of the Central
station, having probably presiding
jurisdiction over all the captains, it is
said, will gather his belongings and
move to the Southern district. Captain
Spillane, now of the Southern district,
one of the department's veterans, will
take the position now occupied by Cap
tain Wittman. Captain Spillane is at
present the only visible impediment to
Captain Wittman's walk to the police
throne two years hence. Captain
Bohen is not earnestly in the race for
honor; that is, that honor which ac
companies the position of Chief of Po
lice, and the Southern and Central dis
trict captains are, in consequence,
looked upon as the best available ma
terial.
Rumor does not stop at the central
and southern districts, but effects other
departments as well. For some un
known reason it is said Captain Dun
levy will be taken from the Harbor
District and -will change places with
Captain Gillin of the Mission District.
With this change, if it takes place, the
halcyon days of the water front pa
trolmen will come to a sudden end. Of
ficers of the Harbor District have been
enjoying watches of eight hours on
duty and sixteen off. This will change.
The usual policeman's watch o^ six
hours on. then twelve off, then twelve
on and six off, will be their lot. Ac
companying these various changes ser
geants and corporals will be scattered,
and "beaten paths" will be a matter of
I some > souvenir L spoon.. â â .â : In the evening
1 there Will he a. wheelbarrow race and
â¢a â  whlpsawing .contest. "Swfftwater"
Bill will referee the events.
The Board of ; Fair Managers yester
' day decided to make Saturday next
| children's day, and: the price of admis- \
slon for the occasion will be ten cents. ;
â â :â ::â  On Friday night a couple is ;: to be

German Women of Means Are
Her Particular Prey, but
Men Are Not Spared.
AN ATTORNEY AFTER HER
She Will Again Be Arrested for
Obtaining Money Under False
Pretenses.
_____ '
Mra. Sophie Maas, an adventuress
who has been for years engaged in
playing upon the credulity of her fel
low beings and thereby keeping herself j
well supplied with funds, \\*ill soon !
against be in the clutches of the police,
and this time Attorney J. K. Ross will
see to it that she will not escape pun
ishment if he can help it.
Abc-ut eighteen months ago Mrs.
Maas, while living at 9 Dale place, was
arrested on the complaint of E. Cade
nesso on the charge of obtaining money
by false pretenses. It was alleged
that she obtained $400 from him by
falsely representing that she owned
property that did not belong to her.
The case was heard by Judge Gamp
bell, and Mrs. Maas by her meek and
lowly attitude in court so impressed
the Judge that when he asked Cade
nesso, "All you want is your money
back?" and he replied in the affirma
tive, the Judge retorted, "this is not
a collection agency," and dismissed the
case.
Attorney Ruef, who represented Ca
denesso. secured another warrant from
Judge Low's court and Mrs. Maas vas
again arrested. When the case was
heard before Judge Low the evidence
was so convincing that he held Mrs.
Maas to answer before the Superior
Co-urt. She wrung her hands in pre^
tended grief, and it so affected the
Judge that he gruffly asked Cadenesso,
"All you want is your money, isn't It? 11
and Cadenesso, having his experience
of Judge Campbell to guide him, meek
ly replied, "No; I want her punished."
Trie judge scored him for persecuting
an inoffensive woman and abruptly .
dismissed the case.
v Now comes Henry Martin, an em
ploye in the Hamburg lodging-house,
with a complaint that Mrs. Maas has
swindled him out of $100 with the â as
sistance of her friend, Mrs. Ferris. On
March 4 last Mrte. Maas got $200 btit
of Martin by false representations.. She
is always on the lookout for German
men and woman who have by their
industry managed to save some money.
She learned that Martin had; $200 in
the German Savings Hank, and March
3 last she and Mrs. Ferris called liptm ;
Martin. She' talked to him in a friend
ly way for some time and finally sug
gested that he should lend her the $200
he had in the bank and she would pay j
him $50 interest at the end of the
month. She claimed that, she was a
woman of wealth and she was backed
up In that assertion^ by her friend, Mrs,
Next day they called again upon j
Martin and induced him to go out with
them to Pierce and Steiner streets,
where Mrs. Maas showed him several i
houses which she said belonged to her. j
Mrs. Ferris chimed in and said that j
Mrs. Maas was worth over $50,000. The |
bait took, and Martin drew the $200 put
of the bank and handed It over to Mrs.
Maas, receiving in return a worthless
piece of paper. Mrs. Maas did not call
with the money and interest at the end
of the month, and Martin began to
make inquiries. He found that Mrs.
Maas did not own any property on
Pierce or Steiner streets, and was told
by people that she was a fraud. He
ascertained Mrs. Ferris' address, and,
by perseverance and threats, he got
back $100. Mrs. Maas then left the city
for New York and only returned a few
days ago, and is living at 718^ Bryant
street.
Martin had placed the case in the
hands of Attorney Ross and he began
to institute inquiries as to Mrs. Maas.
The result was startling.
"I find," said Mr. Ross yesterday,
"that this woman has been for years
victimizing bankers, money lenders,
dentists, and all sorts and conditions
of men and women. Her particular
prey is German women of means, and
she has swindled many of them. I
can't give their names from memory,
but one of them is Mrs. Metszga of
Alameda, who is out $400. Lacey, the
money lender, is out $500, and there are
others too numerous to mention.
"I can name two particular instances.
About a year ago Mrs. Maas got ac
quainted with Carl va>Â« foreman, a ba
ker He is one of the most simple and
confiding men I ever met. By various
pretexts, in telling him that she owned
property in Denver and in this city,
and that she was to buy a drug store
in Antioch for him she managed to get
out of him altogether $4000. She also
managed to get from a friend of Van
Breman named Schmidt, who works in
the same brkery, $350.

operations were stopped, and to-mor

row Martin will swear to a complaint
in Judge Conlan's court for her arrest
on the chargre of obtaining money by
false pretenses. The complaint is
drawn up and would have been sworn
to to-day, but the Judge had adjourned
court before we got there. I will have
any number of witnesses who will ap
pear in court and testify to having been
swindled by this woman."
The psalto-ry of Spain is supposed to
have been introduced into that coun
try by the Moors. It is still in com
mon use among the peasants.

CHICAGO GRAIN* MARKET.
CHICAGO, Jan. 31â In wheat conditions
were more favorable for a decline at the open
j ing than for two weeks. Outside of the de
1 pression caused by the unloading of many
j heavy holders on last week's bulge, the in
] fluence of wheat was still apparent, news de-
I cidedly favoring the. decline which took place.
! May opened 95%^9*5c. recovered to 9GV<c, then
jit declined slowly to 95% c. There was not
much selling pressure, but on the other hand
there was almost a total lack of demand and
; the market sank from its own weight. Liv-
I erpool was very weak and this had more in
| fluenee than anything else. The 1:30 p. m.
i quotations from Liverpool showed a decline of
Hd. and London was reported equally weak.
.The vlcible supply report showing a decrease of
I but 551,000 was also a disappointment. The
market was steadied about noon by the liberal
! clearances. 634.000 bushels. May advancing to
i ?5V but after that the market ruled heavy.
I Late in the session some selling pressure was
| put -on January and the price of that delivery,
which had bÂ»en nominally $1 OSVi. dropped very
quickly to $1 03 on the selling of not more
than 75,000 bushelÃ. This weakness was re-
I fleeted in May. May closed 94% c.
Com was weak at the opening anil remained
so throughout. May closed %-c lower-.
Oats closed \i<B%e lower.
Provisions were very dull. The market
â¢ cloned easy. May pork 10c lower, May lard
| 5c lower and May ribs 2\*e lower.

â¢ :'. LONDON.-: Jan. '".31,â Th* Mark' : I.ane Express,
; to-day, in Its. weekly review, of the grain mar
ket, says: Although th" French wheat . fields'
promise well, it Is feared they are affected by'
rnr.knpss and weeds. 'â  Austro-llungary is suf- :
' fering from a plague of . field mice and moles
which Is spreading over the vast plains of the 1
. Leyttia and Danube. The news from Russia i
is- satisfactory, so far a? the Azlma' wheat of
1*93 Is concerned, but the threshing of the
1597 crop indicates that the yield is very, small
: in the province*, which have, hitherto been.
'credited with an average crop.' Large sales
of Russian wheat point, therefore, to a very
: bad agricultural situation, showing that Rus
sia, while not increasing her total production. . |
Is becoming through agricultural poverty, a.
I prompt seller for â  cash .after 1 the -.. harvests.
With America also a weaker holder, we must
be prepared for increased fluctuations at lower
prices- from October, to February and higher
from March to June. .In ordinary years from
July to September, harvests may be â  expected
to control prices, In accordance with actual
reaplngs. The reduction of the Italian duty on
; foreign wheat is expected to cause the bulk. of
, Russian and Roumanian wheat to be shipped
i to Genoa, Naples and Venice in February and
1 March. â â â¢:; ; ; - â â :â ' '.-.â â . â ' .- â¢ '; â â  -._.

Exciting Outcome of the j
Controversy Over
Athletics.
Bold Request for the Removal
of Professors Bacon arid j
Clapp.
Professor Kellogg Asked to Reconsti
tute the Faculty Athletic
Committee.
BERKELEY, Jan. 31.â The Associ
ated Students of the university this
morning broke all college precedents by '
petitioning President Kellogg for the I
removal of two members of the faculty, j
Professor Thomas R. Bacon and Pro- ;
fessor E. B. Clapp, from the athletics
committee of the faculty. The resolu
tions asking for a new committee were
hotly debated and the adoption of
them by a vote of 85 to 40 did not come
until after an exciting discussion.
Dissatisfaction with the present fac
ulty athletics committee, which con
sists of Professors Bacon, Edwards and
Clapp, was first openly expressed by
Football Manager Everett J. Brown, |
upon his election a week ago. He
charged that two of the members of
the committee (evidently Bacon and
Clapp) were not acting for the interest :
of athletics at the university and de
clared that until a change was made
there would be trouble and dissension.
Brown was reprimanded for his lan
guage by Professor Soule, chairman of
the students' affairs committee, but no
official action was taken and the fac
ulty showed an inclination to drop the I
matter. The Btudent body to-day, \
however, indorsed Brown's position by
their action and have forced to ah
Issue the question of faculty interven
tion in athletics. .â  . : |
The resolutions which threaten to j
cause consternation in the faculty are j
as follows:
Whereas, It is desirable to secure
harmony between the faculty and stu
dents In all matters in which each ex
ercises some control; and, whereas, such \
harmony neither does exist nor is j
likely to exist between the student body i
and the athletics committee of the facuny i
as at present constituted, which fact, we]
fear, may prove a menace to the athletic!
success o"f the university during the com
ing year; be it
Resolved, That we, the Associated Stu
dents of the University of California, re
spectfully petition the president of the
university to reconstitute the above-men
tioned committee from such faculty mem- j
bers as might co-operate with us, through
our representatives, to a greater extent
than do some members of the present
committee; and be it further :-.]: -.] : ':â â 'â  .
Resolved, That it Is the sense of the |
ntudent body that such co-operation ',
might be beet secured by. the appoint- !
ment to the committee of Professor Wai
tÂ«r Magee, Professor George C. Edwards |
and Professor Sydney A. Cloman, Irre- i
epectlve of any views which these pro-;
fessors are known to hold on any matters i
of athletics policy.
The resolutions were offered by J.
Haber, '98, and a prolonged discussion â ]
followed. Editor Hopper of the Occi
dent vigorously objected to the resolu
tions, charging that they were merely
Intended to lower the amateur standing i
of athletics at the university. Secfe- F
tary Allen of the Associated Students i.
intimated that a personal quarrel be- |
tween Brown and Professor Bacon was i
at the bottom of the trouble. Brown i
hotly denied the charge. After an hour I
of controversy the resolutions Were
adopted, the secretary being instructed I
to send copies to President Kellogg and i
the Board of Regents.
President Kellogg refused to discuss i
what would be done with the students' j
petition.
"I have just read the petition," he j
Bald this afternoon, "and have not con- ]
3ulted with anybody about it. I can- j
not talk about it now." :

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Jan. 31.
J. T. Moran, the leader of the old
time and celebrated Greenhood and
Moran baseball team, has again caught
the fever and he intends to organize
nn Oakland nine that shall be the equal
of the celebrated aggregation that once
played a noted game in Alameda that
1 was umpired by Mr. John Lawrence
Sullivan.
There Jb not a more enthusiastic en
thusiast in California on baseball lines
than J. T. Moran. He says that the
few years that he has not been tak
ing an active part in the sport havo
been lost from his life. He places the
time of certain events according to
HELMS NOW THE CHAMPION SPRINTER.
Until In3t evening Officer Rooker, who won: fame by chasing and recapturing an escaped prisoner, held the
record of the California Station as a hundred: yard foot racer, but Sergeant Helms has wrested the laurels
from him. and is now champion, sprinter of the force. The sergeant caught a burglar last night after a race of
several blocks and furnished considerable amusement for those fortunate enough to witness the trial of speed.
Officer Knight was also entered for the run but didn't come out of it with as many honors to his credit as hte
superior, possibly because he was handicapped somewhat by carrying some fifty pounds more weight than
Helms. .-.-.â  .;': ..' \ ;';â¢'â  : :â¢' â ;:. i, .â â ' '/â :â â  . ' .â â¢).'â  'â  â  â -,[_ .. .: :";:"â¢â Â»â  ' ..'. 'â â [. .'â  .. '.'â â¢â¢
It happened this way: Leopold Greenburg left his Curiosity Shop at 43*? Montgomery street at 6:30 last
night to get something to hold soul and body together, leaving his store locked in the meantime. 0n his re
turn half an hour later he was greatly surprised to find the padlock on the door broken and the door in a con
dition to be opened by any stray passer-by. Entering the shop, he interrupted two men, who were busily en
gaged in looting th*> place. They dropped their work and rushed by him, put of the door, and up Montgomery
street as fast as their legs could carry them. Greenburg gave chase, at the same time yelling at the top of his
lungs for assistance. Officer Knight and Sergeant Helms were in the Tvicteity, heard the alai-m, hastened to
the scene of the disturbance, spied the burgiars, and the race was on. Up Montgomery street sped the burg
iars, the doughty police following them every step of the waylike angelsof mercy in dlsgufse/ At the corner
of California the crooks separated, one going up and the other down the street. Officer Knjght, with his 300 .
pounds, chose the down grade, but ;with this in his favor, the terror of Montgomery street failed to get hia
man. It was different with the sergeant, however.: Girding up his loins, a:nd nothing daunted; by the steep hill
he must climb at a breakneck speed, the genial officer forced the 247 pounds of flesh he carries up the slippery
Bldewalk, and without any assistance (so he claims) caught the agile Bailor boy he was chasing. Hence the
title champion. ' : ' ' :. â  â¢ :'â¢â  .'.\ : 'â â â 'â ' .'â â â  â !â¢â  â  !â¢.â â¢â¦â  'â â 'â  . : :

:lty of silverware piled on the floor of the shop preparatory to placing it in a sack to carry away. Angel gave
the police the name of his accomplice, acknowledged his guilt, and says that if hd had known it waa Helms

their chronological relationship with
certain features of baseball history and
as the sport has been somewhat dull
since his team disbanded, his pent-up
ardor is now bursting forth more vig
orously than ever.
"I intend to at once organize as
strong a team as I can possibly get,"
he said this afternoon. "It will be es
sentially an Oakland aggregation, that
is to say, it will be manased in this
cify. but I shall get the finest talent
available. lam now negotiating with
the railroad syndicate for a suitable
park on one of its lines, but we have
not decided on any particular locality.
Th^re is a good opportunity now to
revive the national sport, and I intend
tÂ«.f take advantage- of it. There is no
re&son why we should not have a good
team. To-.morrow the matter will be
floridod of the Recreation Park of San
Francisco. I stepped into that for the
purpose of helping c-ut my friend. Col
onel Robinson, and preventing McNeil
doing as he pleased, and I expect to
have some very lively baseball this

THEODORE MEETZ DEAD.
The Aged Alameda Capitalist Carried
Away by Blood Poisoning.
ALAMEDA, Jan. 31.â Theodore Meetz,
the aged capitalist, who had one of his
legs amputated last week because of
blood poisoning, the result of the work of
) a chiropodist upon a corn oh his foot,
; died this afternoon about 3:30 from the I
effects of the operation. From the time
:the operation was performed it was rec
ognized that he had but a slight chance
i for recovery: His age was a strong factor
I against him, but he lived longer than was
j expected even then, passing nway peace
i fvilly to-day at the hour mentioned.
Meetz was 77 years old. at the time of
; his death and was; a -.native of Germany.
I He had resided in this country for the
I greater portion of his life, having lived in
Alameda for upward of thirty years. Ho
I; engaged in. the brewery business here and
bought large tracts of land which in time
made him wealthy. He also bulk and ran
the first car line between Alameda and
Oakland, and added to his wealth from it.
When he sold his franchises to the elec
tric railroad companies he received a
very large sum of money for themâ some
180,000. Ho was married many years ago
and his widow survives him. He had no
children.
The cause of his death was peculiar.
Years ago. while he owned the street car
line, he was driving one of his cars when
his right foot got caught in some way
and was badly crushed. It always gave
him trouble afterward and finally a very
painful bunion grew on the crippled mem
ber. Some weeks ago hÂ« called in the
services of a San Francisco chiropodist,
who operated on the excrescence. Soon
after blood poisoning made itself appar
ent, and after other remedies had failed
it was decided that amputation afforded
the only possible chance for recovery.
Accordingly the right leg was cut off
just below tho knee last week. This did
not afford relief, and the end came as al
ready stated.
HENRY IS STILL MISSING.
His Friends Are of the Opinion That
He Is in the City.
L. M.. H.er.ry. a collector In the employ
of the Spring Valley Water Company, who
has been missing since a week ago yes
terday, is believed to be in this city. It
is not known positively whether he is
short in his collections, and it will be ful
ly two weeks before his district can be
thoroughly canvassed.
"We are not looking for Henry," said
Charles Webb Howard, president of the
water company, yesterday afternoon,
"for if he is short In his accounts the
surety company on his bond will make
good tho loss. Henry was under $5000
bonds, given by a surety company, and if
his accounts be short that sum will more
than cover any loss to the water com
pany. Henry was one of our most trust
ed employes," I.'1 .' added Howard, "and I can
not easily bring myself to believe that he
has' done anything wrong."
"If there be a shortage what do you
think it will amount to?" was asked.
"Under no circumstances will it reach
$1500, and if thero be a shortage it will
probably amount to much less."
It is believed Henry is still here. He
was well known and it is not thought
possible he e6uld travel fifty miles with
out being recognized. A report was cir
culated Saturday night that he had
crossed over the line into Mexico, but the
story could not be confirmed. The surety
company telegraphed ;to all the impor
tant stations leading out of the State
and received replies that no one answer
ing Henry's description had been seen.
The friends of the missing collector are
of the opinion that he will show up and
prove his collections are all straight.

T, H. Goodman, general passenger
agent of the Southern Pacific, who has
be<?n in Chicago for some time past at
tending- a meeting nf the traffic officers of
the western â 'â¢â â¢and transcontinental â¢'; lines,
will arrive in/, this city to-day.
:'. The object .of the meeting', as previous
ly published, in The Call, was to see If
some means; pouid not be devised by
â Which the through rates from eastern
points to Alaska Ala San Francisco could
be made to- come flown to the level of
the cheaper -fares on .the more northern
route terminating fit Puget Sound ports.
Though, the mait^r was thoroughly gone
over, the meeting dissolved without com
ing â : to any definl c agreement, so the
.solving of the problem wfil have to fall
on the Southern Pacific alone. :
..The difference comes in the steamer
fares from this city northward., and
amounts to $12 first (lass and $b second
claps. As the steamship companies abso
lutely refuse to come down from these
figures,. strguing that at 'any reasonable
price they Will have more travel than
they can accommodate, the difference on
the through rates from eastern points
will fall on the Southern Pacific and its
Immediate connections.
. R. A. Donaldson, assistant general pas
senger agent of the Southern Pacific,
when seen on the matter, had this to say:
â¢"The situation is simply this: The
through rates from the east to Alaska
by way of San Francisco are $12 and $6
higher than by way, of Portland, Seattle,
Tacoma and Victoria, and It thus becomes
apparent that the lines interested in bring
ing Klondike traffic to San Francisco
must make up the difference by reducing
railway fares to meet the steamer
charges. This difference will fall on the
Southern Pacific and Its Immediate con
nections, and they will be obliged to
stand whatever absorbtion there Is.
"Such a proceeding on our part is not
a cut in rates, it Is merely an adjustment
and equalization po we may get a faic
share of the business In the expected
rush."
Should this view of the matter be taken
by the northern routes the present har
mony of the railway world will remain
undisturbed, but should' some of the
northern lines consider the reduction in
the light of a cut, they will no doubt ven
ture on retaliatory measures, which will
be apt to bring on a rate war of such pro
portions as has not existed for many a
long day.
LABELING GOODS.
Articles of Foreign Manufacture
Must Not Be Marked as of
American Production.
Assistant Secretary of the Treasury
Howell has issued the following circular
to Collector of the Port Jackson:
The attention of officers of the customs is
invited to the provisions of sections 8 and 11
of the act of July 24. 1597, which are as fol
lows:
"Sec. S. That all articles of foreign manu
facture, such as are usually or ordinarily
markÂ«d, stamped, branded or labeled, and all
packages containing such or other imported
articles, shatl, respectively, be plainly marked,
stamped, branded, or labeled In legible En
glish words in a conspicuous place, so as to
Indicate the country of their origin and the
quantity of thetr contents; and until so
marked, stamped, branded, or labeled they
shall not be delivered to thÂ» Importer. Should
any . article of imported merchandise be
Â«.*%rked, stamped, branded, or labeled so as
to Indicate a quantity, number, or measure
ment in excess of the quantity, number or
measurement actually contained In such arti
cle, no delivery of the same shall be made to
the importer until the mark, stamp, brand or
label, as the case may be, shall be changed so
as to conform to the facts of the case
"Sec. 11. That no article of imported mer
chandise which shall copy or simulate the
name or trade-mark of any domestic manu
facture or manufacturer, or which shall bear a
name or mark, which is calculated to Induce
the public to believe tfrat the article Is manu
factured in the United States, thall be ad
mitted to entry at any custom-house of the
United States." â¢ â¢ *
It has come to the knowledge of the depart
ment that in many instances the trade names
and designations of domestic manufacturers
are stamped upon one side nf the blade or
tang of razors and knives, while the name of
the country of origin la obscurely placed upon
;the other, in such a manner as to afford
prlma facie evidence of an Intention to de
ceive the purchaser. The foreign names In
such cases can be easily removed by the cheao
process of buffing. (Synopses 12,273, 16 147 and
18.187.) Such articles are not admissible to
entry. In synopsis 16,238 It is held that "the
branding of articles of cutlery should be of
such a character that It can not be removed
unless ground out on a grindstone, and shoild
be quite as legible as the proprietary marks
and so located that there will be no difficulty
in seeing It/'.
Officers of the customs are further Instructed
to refuse entry. of any article bearing- names
of well-known domestic manufacturers with
names of American cities, whether the' name
of the foreign country of origin appear there
on or not (Synopsis 11,115.) All cases involv
ing similar evasions of law shall be reported
to the department for Instructions.

"THE CALL'S"
VIEW INDORSED
Ministers Applaud It for Its
Stand in the Brown
Case.
The Editorial in Friday's Issue
Voices Public Opinion
They Say.
The Bay Association and Monday
Morning Club Consolidated
YesterdÂ»y.
Since the members of the churches
and their leaders have had a chance to
think over the confession of Rev. C.
O. Brown many of the friends of that
gentleman, who were once his stanch
supporters, have changed their minds
and are outspoken in their belief that
the sentence of the Bay Conference
was a merited one.
The attitude of The Call In laying
aside all sentimentality and showing the
gentleman up in his true light has been
applauded by many of the brightest
lights In the Congregational Church.
After the meeting of tÂ£e Monday
Morning Club yesterday the praise of
The Call's editorial was heard on all
sides. The editorial referred to ap
peared in the issue of last Friday's
Call, headed "Concerning C. O. Brown,"
and the article rebukes him for the at
titude he has taken, and expresses dis
gust with the excuse for a confession
the disgraced minister read.
The part particularly indorsed is the
following: :
The so-called confession is only an
other of the long list of Brown decep
tions. It is really an attempt at self
gloriflcatlon. By implication it tries to
convey the impression that although
Brown was not wholly innocent, he had
been far more sinned against than sin
ning. It speaks of "a deep and malignant
conspiracy against, his home." He knows
that no such conspiracy ever existed; he
knows that people are aware of this
knowledge on his part. The charge comes
with ill-grace from a man who had de
liberately sullied that home by installing
within its wails as favorite a creature
of the streets. There is naught in the
confession indicating regret;, its abject
ness has no ring of sincerity, its promises
are hollow. It Is not what it purports to
be. It Is a palpable sham, a crowning
Infamy born of a character wholly barren
of the elements tending to respond to an
impulse toward reform. Yet this man
calmiy proposes still to serve a cause to
which he is more than a reproach. He
has become a stench in the nostrils.
One of the ministers of this city, the
Western correspondent for the large
Congregational paper of the United
States, edited by Lyman Abbott, called
the New York Outlook, when tele
graphed to for particulars of the Brown
case sent among other clippings the
editorial before mentioned, writing at
the same time that "it was public opin
ion voiced in the most conservative pa
per of San Francisco."
The Bay Association is no more,
neither is the Monday Morning Club,
for both consolidated yesterday at the
regular meeting of the Monday Morn
ing Club into "The Ministers' Congre
gational Association of San Francisco
and Vicinity."
The cause of this change is that
neither organization could live by it
self, but joined together could become
a powerful body, A new constitution
was framed and the officers of the
Monday Morning Club were appointed
as officers of this new body until next
April, the time for regular election.
According to the new constitution
none but ministers will be eligible for
membership, thus barring laymen, a
move that has caused considerable
comment, as this was not the case with
either of the two associations that yes
terday met and adjourned sine die.
The first meeting of the new associa
tion will take place next Monday.
Rev. E. P. Dennett read a paper be
fore the Methodist ministers, the sub
ject being "Spiritual Biology," and In
it he criticized the teachings of the
theological seminary in regard to its
method of instructing the pupils to
teach the gospel.
The Presbyterian ministers were en
tertained by the reading of a paper on
the "Four Gospels of St Luke" by Rev.
S. S. Cryor of Westminster Church. A
woman appeared before the ministers
to tell them about the Italian mission.
The Christian ministers met but ad
journed at an early hour, after listen
ing to a paper by Edward Davis on
"The Relation of the Holy Spirit to the
Conscience."
GREAT COURSING EVENTS.
Two Meetings Will Be Held This
Eveningâ High-Class Dogs
for the West.
Meetings will be held this evening: at
Pythian Hall, between the original Inter
state Coursing Club and the new club
which Is known as the Union Park
Coursing Association.
As business of more than ordinary Im
portance will be transacted by both or
ganizations It is expected that a large
number of leashmen will be represented
at each meeting.
Messrs. Donahue and Simmons of Crip
ple Creek, Col., have written to the sec
retary of the Interstate Club that they
will have three or four crack running
dogs entered for the John Grace cup,
which will be run for at Ingleside Park
on February 22. Mr. Donahue will be here
in season to witness the great Inclosed
coursing event of the season.
It was stated last evening on good au
thority that Eddie Canavan will Judge
the Union Park Coursing Association
meeting on February 22.
An attempt has ben made to secure the
services of Headly. the great English
coursing judge, for the Union Park Asso
ciation, but as Mr. Henrtly has an excel
lent position in old England, It is ex
tremely doubtful that he will journey to
California unless he is guaranteed a sub
stantial salary, which must last at least
three years.
J A Graham of St. Louis, who is an
Importer of English greyhounds, has sold
to Hugh Lynch of the Interstate Club
four high-class clogs, namely: Decota,
by Glenklrk-Gilder: Mystic Maid, by Mil
ler's Rob-Lady Penbrook; and two pup
pies by Astronomy-Mystic Maid of great
promise. The kennel will be shipped on
Wednesday and Mr. Lynch expects the
high-class flyers In this city In the latter
part of the week.
WILLEY'S WILL.
It Will Be Contested by Several Rel
atives Whose Names Were Not
Mentioned in It.
It is likely that the will of Charles
Walter Willey, in which he bequeaths to
Mrs. Mulrhead all his interest in $82,000
In the litigation over his father's estate.
will be contested by relatives of the de
ceased. It had been always supposed
by the friends of the deceased that he
had no relatives living:, nor are there
any mentioned in Ms alleged will, but it
appears that he had several kinsfolk,
both here and in the East. Jason Sprin
ger, a well-known pioneer, who died
about a year apo at Sisson, was an uncle
of his. Jason's brother, Watson Springer,
who lives in the northern part of the
State, called at the Coroner's office yes
terday morning to make inquiries con
cerning the will. He said young Willey

As none of the relatives of the deceased
are mentioned in the purported will, it is
believed that undue influence will be al
leged as one of the grounds for the con
test.
Sailors' Wages Increased.
The Klondike rush has proved a boon
to seamen all alone the coast, except in
this port. Heretofore it has been cus
tomary to pay $30 per month for coast
vise shipping, and $35 for deep sea, but
for the past few weeks shipowners along
the coast have been only too glad to
get men at $35 per month for the coast
wise trade and $40 per month for deep
sea men. In this port the prices remain
the same, but many men take what they
can get to get out of port and then ue
sf^rt and ship for the higher rate at the
first port the vessel makes. It is expected
by the members of the local union that
in this way a great many who have been
idling away time along the water front
will go out, and increased prices from San
Francisco will follow aa a natural re
sult.
CROOKS IN PLENTY
IN THE MISSION
Police Confident That a Gang
Is Operating in That
District.
Residents of the Mission are becoming
greatly alarmed over the large number of
robberies an 1 burglaries which have been
committed in that district during the
past month.
Daylight burglaries have been very fre
quent and the thieves are becoming more
daring.
On Saturday afternoon between 4 and
5 o'clock the grocery store of John Do
herty at York and Twenty-third streets
was entered by two men through a rear
entrance while the proprietor of the es
tablishment was standing in front of his
store, and the contents of the cash
drawer was stolen. Miss May Hogan, a
young lady living on Hampshire street,
saw the burglars leaving the store with a
bag and stated that they disappeared
down Twenty-fourth street.
About twenty minutes later the saloon
and grocery conducted by Luke Fitzger
ald at Hampshire and Twenty-third
streets was entered in a similar manner
while the proprietor was waiting on a
customer and the cash register was emp
tied.
The police are of the opinion that a
gang of Eastern crooks is operating In the
Mission and the most efficient detectives
on the force have been detailed to run
them down.
Captain Bohen has secured excellent
descriptions of the men and is confident
that before many days have elapsed he
will have the entire gang in the tanks.
Nearly all the burglaries and robberies
In *he Mission of late have been commit
ted in the same manner, several occur
ring at about the same time each night,
thus strengthening the belief of the pres
ence of a gang.
A Friend at Court.
Two new laborers went to work In the
appraiser's store yesterday. One of them,
C. W. .Love, is a personal acquaintance
and friend of Vice-President Hobart and
worked for him in Paterson, N. J. Hence
it is reported in the' Custom House that
Mr. Love owes his position in the ap
praiser's store to the good offices c* the
Vice-President.

TRACKING THE
HARBOR BOARD
Doctored Books of Darby
Laydon & Co. Exam=
ined in Court. j
Mr. Colnon Suffers Lapse of
Memory in Consequence
of Vertigo.
In the hearing yesterday of the case
against the Harbor Commissioners
brought by the Paraffine Paint Com
pany, on allegations of fraud and col
lueion on the part erf the board, with
favored firms or non-incorporated or
ganizations of contractors, Judge Bel
cher made a series of rulings that are
proper subjects of comment and com
mendation, because of their bearing
an the public interests involved with
this complicated litigation.
The Harbor Commission is a board
of public works, with an executive
head, to whom is confided a great
trust, in the administration of which
a vast expenditure of public funds is
made annually.
In a number of legal actions insti
tuted against them during the few
mc-nths past fraud and collusion have
been charged. For reasons and through
Influences as yet unexplained, these
suits have been dismissed without hav
ing been tried as to the merits or ver
acity of the serious accusations In
volved.
The grievances of the unsuccessful
contractors in each and every case are
directly traceable to a syndicate of
successful contractors, whom it is af
firmed legallyâ and avowed with even
greater scandal in the openâ one or
more members of the board secretly
serve in the matter of purchasing ma
terials and making contracts.
As already pointed out in The Call's
exposure of the controversy, the com
bination as a whole .may be designated
as the Dundon-Slade syndicate. It
includes the Slade Lumber Company, J
the Dundon Lumber Company, the San j
Francisco Timber Preserving Company, j
of which Dundon and Slade are the i
chief officers, or operators, and the ]
Darby Laydon & Co. firm, in which the j
two gentlemen are interested. The ;
combination, which deals in lumber, >
piles, and a pile-preserving process, has j
transacted with the board during the
last year alone, about $134,000 worth of
business.
Each successive legal onslaught made
on the board has been supported- by
the charge that the combination named
were favored after a fraudulent and
collusive fashion.
The latest competitor for contract to
suffer from the system alleged to be in
vogue is the Paraffine Paint Company,
and. unlike their predecessors in the
courts, they seem to have put up a
fight which is intended to bring about
a thorough and sweeping investigation
of the inner relations between the Dun
don-Slade syndicate and any one or
more members of the board whose rep
utation may have been tainted.
In the preliminary sparring for the
opening of their case, latitude was al
lowed for the conduct of their inquiry
until the records of the board had been
brought into partial review, back to j
November, IS%. They had procured a
judicial order for the appearance in
court of Mr. E. E. Plade. with the books
of the lumber-supplying tentacle of the
contract octopus.
Mr. Dundon had been subpenaed also, j
but under a protest that business im- j
peratively required his absence from J
the city, he was permitted by the court
to absent himself until Thursday.
Yesterday, when it was learned that :
Darby Laydon, who is also wanted on the
witness-stand, had taken an imperative
business trip from the city, in company i
â¢with Mr. Dundcn, the attorneys for the i
Parafline Paint Company summoned
the bookkeeper of the Darby Laydon &
Co. tentacle to come into court with
the books in his custody.
Toward the closing hours of the ex
amination for the day, when counsel for
the Paraffine Company attempted to
dig into the Darby Laydon books, under
the eye of the court, they were met at
every turn by the attorney for the
commission by objections and the tak
ing of exceptions. Throughout this
phase of a contest which Is evidently
intended to. take up the time of the
court for many days. Judge Belcher ad- ,
hered to a line of rulings from which
the public may gather the hope that if I

Attorneys for the Paraffine Company
purpose showing that one or more of the
Harbor Commissioners and some of the .
confidential agents have identitu'd
themselves with the interests of the !
Dundon-Slade syndicate by accepting |
money presents and gratuities from '
one or more of the syndicate com- I
panics or copartnerships^-gratulties de
scribed by Attorney M. J. Sullivan as [
bribes. : - \
A former bookkeeper of Darby Lay
don & Co. was put. on the witness
stand to enlighten the court as to the
manner in which moneys were paid on
the side to either the Harbor Commis
sion or their trusted agents. Mr. Strat
ton, of counsel for the board, strenu
ously opposed the admission of such
testimony on several groundsâ that it
was incompetent as coming from a wit
ness who could not swear of his own
knowledge that the firm paid moneys,
or made presents, to the board br its
members; that the range of inquiry
went beyond the period which the in
vestigation had comprehended; that
testimony relating X<> a time when the
board was constituted differently than
at present could not have proper bear
ing on the conduct of the board as at
present composed; that counsel for the
Paraffine Company could not show proof
of what they alleged, from these books,
but were transgressing the reasonable
bounds of the examination without any
actual proof on which to base their ex
pectations.
Counsel for the plaintiff company
affirmed it was their intention to prove
from the books of these firms, or com
panies, and by competent testimony,
that the Harbor Commission and its
officers had been in the habit of receiv
ing gratuities or bribes since a period
anterior to the time covered by the ques
tions involved in the pending litiga
tion, in proof of the further allegation
that the Dundon-Slade syndicate had
been on secret terms of friendship and
favoriteism with the commission since
Mr. Colnon had become a member, in
March, 1895, and perhaps prior thereto.
Judge Belcher asked if it were their
purpose to introduce this evidence
precedent to establishing collusion pos
itively on the part of the present board.
When they Insisted that such was their
design he allowed the introduction of
all testimony of this nature within the
period of Mr. Colnon's incumbency;
holding further, however, that in event
the links were not carried out to the
present the preliminary testimony
should be rejected as irrelevant and in
competent as affecting the present
issue.
The effect iof â¢ this ruling,^whatever:
specious pleading may ; be made as to
undeserved reflections .-which may 1 fall
upon the board, either wholly or In
part, will be beneficial ; in several./re
spects.. The most important of these
is that if the board and its: agents are
guiltless they . will be proved :to be â¢ so. â â¢
If innnocent of the damaging charges
of bribery and collusion they are grati
fled doubtless at : this opportunity to
be placed [ honestly before the [ public
they are appointed to serve,; since the
allegations of silent. partnerships and
secret profit sharing will; have to rest
largely in the confirmatory proof in the
accounts of the Dundon-Slade syndi
cate. If wrong has been done the State
in the manner described the/people
will enjoy the benefit of Judge Bel
cher's ruling even to a larger and more
appreciative extent than can the Par
afflne Paint Company as a complain
ant against the commission. Viewed
from whatever standpoint, it is diffi
cult to perceive why the board and its
attorneys should 'not acquiesce in the
proceeding under Judge Belcher's rul
ing, for in matters |of this kind when
honest public- officers are before : the
bar of justice to defend accusations of
such grave moment it would; seem their
wisest and most courageous 'course to
â waive technicalities and quibbling^ and
place their ', faith of vindication in" the
fullness of \ the inquiry made, within

,in his ruling's. â "':'â¢". - : ;â  ' . . .'. ;
Prior to the opening of the afternoon
session Mr. Garret McEnerney saun
tered into the courtroom and dropped
nonchalantly into a -.: corner; ..remote
from the one th which the; attorneys
j and members of ; the Harbor â  Commis
sion were seated, in front Of the wit-
I ness chair. At the head of the table,
| paralleling the jury box railing;, sat At
j torney Strattun, representing the
: board, with Chairman Colnon, Member
: Chadbourne and Chief Engineer
Holmes surrounding hint. Presently
Major Harney, .the third : membef, and !
Attorney Ford, who has served the
i board for some time, joined the: Strat
i ton entourage:.
Before the hearing was resumed, Mr.
; Chridbourne withdrew, and was seen
no more, â . . ;-.- :.â¢â â â â â â â  ' ' â â  .-' "\ ' â  : - 'â¢;
About the same time, P. M- :Reed,
! present bookkeeper of the Darby: Lay
: don tirm and of the long-headed ceph
nlic formation, to whom alienists at
tribute the possession of the milder and
humanely serviceable characteristics of
mankind, came in with ah armful of
grimy books, depositing them on a set
tee not far from the picture of ease and
1 contentment Mr. McEnerney usually
.composes himself into on the eve of
action. Thereupon Mr. McEnerney
nrose and made his way into the wit
ness-bo:;, taking a chair therein near j
I the railing, on the other side of which
sat Attorney Strattoh. It soon deveK
oped that Mr. McEnerney was present
to defend the books of Darby Laydon
& Co. from vandal intrusion.'
At the table, directly in front of the
clerk's desk, \vere grouped S. G. Irv
ing of the Parafflne Paint Company
and his attorneys, Judge Cope and M. i
J. Sullivan. ':'?. , :.; : ..'; .-.-. '.'.2 â 
Chairman Conlon was first called to
: the stand and; gave the second enter
\ tainlng exhibition of the day, of spas-
I medic- recoveries fi'ofti a chronic lapse
i of: memory consequent upon an attack
of vertigo last spring. The evidence
of these temporary restorations oc
curred in affirmative and negative an-
J swers to questions of Attorney Strat
ton, intended to establish the fact that
Mr. Stratton knew a great deal more
! about the business of the bdard than
did the honorable executive chairman.
I In short, Mr. Gohlon did hot know pre
cisely very much about anything re
lating to the contracts, opinions, legal
advices and specifications pertaining to
the su'lt, but allowed that Mr, Strat
ton knew all about them. ;
"When Mr. Reed came forward 'with
the books of Â£)arby Laydon <& Co., in
obedience to the request that he be
called to the stand, there was an ex
pectant shuffling and a sudden bobbing
together of craniums : stored with legal
lore and crafty At.tr/rneys Stratton and
McEnerney met, mouth ar.d ear, across
the jury-box railing:
After Mr. Reed had been sworn he
[' identified- the books as those of IDarby
Laydon & Co., and testified that they
were all of the: acpount records : -. ', he
knew about. When asked if there ex>
isted in them fi, "service account," the
I legal mentality of Attorney Strattrm
and Attorney McEnerney caitie into
j whispered affinity, for a few moments.
The swift result was an inquiry from
Attorney Stratton directed to Judge
Cope, as to the intention of the <iues
: tinn. It was explained that the puiv
! pose was to show- the private nature
j c-f t he transa ction s between the â¢com
mission and the Darby Laydon firm.
The witness then replied that no "ser
vice account" had been kept for two
| years. Objection was marie to any
i further questioning of the witness on
! this line, because the keeping of a "ser
| vice account" had ceased prior to the
beginning of the period which had
I marked the limit of the investigation
as conducted up to that time.
Judge Cope dropped the witness
j without discussing the point, but ex-
I plained that the intention to have Dar
| by Laydon present himself to pilot the
i inquiry through the mazes of the firm's
accounts had been defeated, tempora
rily at least, by the unexpected depart
ure from the city of that gentleman.
Then the real tug of war came off.
John A. Townley took the stand. He
had been bookkeeper of the firm for
seven consecutive years, and until two
years ago.
A mass of objections and exceptions
followed the query: "Did you ever
know of Darby Laydon & Co. making
a present, to Mr. Colnon?"
In this other form the question was
put: "Did you ever know of Darby
Laydon & Co. making a present to the
Board of Harbor Commissioners while
Mr. Colnon was a member?"
Objections continuing, Attorney Sul
livan; vigorously insisted that the ques
troij was relevant to the issues in the
case; that Chairman Colnon had testi
fied that he had ever at;ted from pure
and disinterested motives. It was the
intention: to prove bribery and collu
siorju It Syas proposed: to show that se
cret relations began between Darby
Laydon & Co. and the Board of Harbor
Commissioners as far back as 1895, when
Mr. Colnon became a member of the
board. If this proof was to be followed
by similar proof coming down to the
present time, it should be considered
by the court; as it would have its mo
ral value in the determination of the
pending issues^
Attorney Stratton asked counsel for
the Paraffine Paint Company if they
had recent proof of the nature charged.
Judge Belcher gaid he was willing to
take their word for it as reputable
counsel in the court.
After other direct questions had been
objected to. Judge Belcher ruled that
the investigation of the books and the
taking of the testimony of witness
should proceed, with the understanding
thai it would be expunged from the
record as incompetent unless the links
of the alleged proof were carried down
to the present time.
Witness, under instruction of coun
sel, examined first th^ ledger for proof
of rocord he had made as bookkeeper
:of moneys secretly s'aiil tv ;i .iy mem
ber of the Harbor Commies-ion or their
agents. It should be explained that,
the expectation was to prove by Wit- .,
ness Townsley the recorded payment
of such presents or bribes, under what
is described as "service account," in
accordance with the directions of a
member of the firm. This "service ac-.
count" was no less than a private reg
istry of moneys paid out other than
for goods received or goods purchased.
To certain records of the nature de
scribed, of. which he was willing to- tes
tify, he had been informed by a mem
ber of the firm the Harbor Commission
was the recipient, he had, while serv
ing as bookkeeper, affixed pmall initial
marks. Thesp he could not find in a
perusal of the accounts.
He did make : a startling discovery at
the outset, however. yv " The "service ac
count" . had been kept on page 142 of
the -ledger .under the caption written
by him; "Service." â¢ This page caption
had . been altered by erasure and sub
stitution to read "advertising." ; :â ?'.
"How do you- know an alteration has
been made on â¢ that page?" asked At
torney Stratton, who had advanced to
the .witness stand, with Judge Cope and
Attorney : Sullivan.. ' . . % . â 'â  'â .
v "Let me look," said the witness, and'
opening the. ledger * index page j to ; the
letter :"S" he , ran . his â  finger down un- 1
til it struck this line in his 'own hand
writing, "Service account, page 142."
Said he, "there is how. I know.".
â  The person who substituted the head
ing, â  "Advertising," :on : page â¢ 142 for ;
"Service," had forgotten to do a similar,
piece of slick work on the ledger index
page. :;:â â¢';"â  :â ; '-r- ;â "â 'â â¢- v- . . '...;_ â¢ ;:.: V; â ..â ;:

The ..remainder of ', the proceedings up
to the time of the adjournment was.
.devoted mainly, . to contention 4 over ob
jections. Attorney Stratum fought . like :
a good one -to stop the investigation of ;
the books, but the Judge good; natured-'
ly overruled him, save...in, the particu
lar that the examination should not go
beyond .the time. Mr. Colnon joined the ;

'â â  "Butj as a matter of fact, you have

; sented ; : the interests .of ;â¢ the .' four re

WEDDED AT THE RUSSIAN CHURCH
A Groom From St. Petersburg Who Will Be
Ordained on Sunday Next.
Vladimir V. Allexandrof, a representative of the Holy Synod of St. Pe
tersburg, and Miss Rose Tsfkoores, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. P. Tsikoores,
were married last evening at 8- o'clock in the Russian Church. 1715 Powell
street, the archbishop conducting the impressive Eastern orthodox cere
mony.' The bride was attended by Miss Mac Doyle, who officiated as maid
of honor, and Miss Tillle Doyle and Miss Lulu Hoffman as bridesmaids.
George P. Tsikoores, Paul S. Grepachevsky, George A. Dabovich and N. Sam
Martlnovich assisted as groomsmen. Miss Annie Angel officiated as a little
Bower girl, strewing flowers along the bridal path. The bride wore a mag
nificent cream white satin gown. The skirt was made en train, and the cor
sage was trimmed with rare and costly lace. The bridesmaids were attired
alike in white organdie over white silk.
After the ceremony there was a reception for the bridal party and a lim
ited number of guests at the residence of the bride's parents, 1814 Taylor
stroet. On Sunday next the groom, who has been doing missionary work at
the Russian Church at Seattle, will, at the Russian Church in this city, be
ordained and will then proceed with his bide to Seattle, where he will take
charge of the church.

The Pacific Pine Lumber Company,
the Healy, Tibbetts & Co. and the

All the proposals were higher than
rates previously paid for piles. Healy,

All bids were rejected on the ground
