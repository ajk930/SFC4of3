THE HOUSE IS FOR WAR.
THE SENATORS HESITATE
SPAIN RESENTS
INTERVENTION BY
THE UNITED STATES
Ministers Talk of Peace, but the
Situation Is Looked Upon
at Madrid as Grave.
Copyrighted, 1898. by James Gordon Bennett.
MADRID, April 13.â The view
taken here of President McKinley's
message is exceedingly serious, and
although some apparently think that
the President may be given full pow
ers to intervene, the period at which
intervention shall take place is un
defined, depending upon results and
events.
Popular appreciation of the situa
tion was expressed to-day by a polit
ical leader, who said: "Does Presi
dent McKinley intend to take Cuba
immediately?"
The Cabinet meeting to-day lasted
five hours, and it is said was mainly
devoted to the consideration of Presi
dent McKinley's message to Congress
on the Cuban question. "When the
Ministers adjourned an official note
was issued setting forth the views of
the Government. It is variously
commented upon and interpreted in
newspaper circles.
In brief, the note sets forth that
the Cabinet has granted an extraor
dinary credit for war purposes and
has incidentally increased the grant
for the artillery of Porto Rico.
The Minister of the Interior, Senor
Capdepen, gave the official version of
the events here on Sunday and Mon
day, and also made a report of the oc
currences in some of the provincial
towns.
After disposing of current affairs,
the Premier, Senor Sagasta, desig
nated two of the Ministers to imme
diately draw up an address to the
crown.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs,
Senor Gullon, at the request of Senor
Sagasta, made a report of the state
of affairs in his department, which
the Premier thought should occupy
the first place in the debates of the
Cabinet.
Senor Gullon read a report of the
text of President McKinley's mes
sage. After referring to the Presi
dent's previous message, which was
considered necessary in order to fill
up the gaps in the political sum
mary, it was decided that the .para
graphs read were sufficient for the
Cabinet to affirm that the Govern
ment refuses to acknowledege the
right of the United States to inter
fere in Cuba, adding:
"The declarations in the message
are incompatible with the sover
eignty and rights of the nation, and
are an interference in the internal
affairs of this country."
The Spanish Government, how
ever, expressed the opinion that it is
not called upon to take action until
the recommendations ot President
An American Torpedo-Boat on a Night Scent Off Havana Harbor.
DON CARLOS
WILL FIGHT
MADRID, April IS.â Don Car
los has issued a manifesto. In the
course of which he says:
"The carlist who in the face
of war with the United States
would rise In arms against
Spain, is a traitor. If war oc
curs all th who fight against
the foreigner who insults us will
deserve well of Carlos. If the
Spanish Government does not
venture into war, but permits
the loss of Cuba, then t' i Car
lists who do not respond to the
voice of the King will also be
traitors. If the Government will
not take up the glove thrown
down by "Washington the King
himself will come to Spain; and
if he cannot get soldiers he will
get volunteers from the pro
vinces to defend the honor ' the
country."
McKinley have become specific acts.
Thus it is considered by the Span
iards here that matters are practi
cally as they were before the mes
sage was sent to Congress, and the
opinion is expressed in official circles
that neither the message nor last
night's Cabinet meeting has changed
the prospect of peace.
The Spanish Government consid
ers that, apart from its solemn af
firmation of Spain's rights as a na
tion, the Ministers are not called
upon to make any declaration so long
as the resolutions of Congress or the
initiative of President McKinley do
not lead to concrete acts.
The official note also says: "A
firm consciousness of its rights,
united with the resolution to main
tain them, will inspire the nation as
they inspire the Government, with
the serenity necessary in these diffi-
I cult moments to direct successfully
and defend energetically the sacred
interests which are the patrimony of
the Spanish race."
The Minister of War, General Cor
rea, Rnd the Minister of Marine, Ad
miral Bermejo, submitted reports re
lating to the measures taken toward
mobilizing all the forces of the coun
try.
There is absolutely no truth in the
report that General Weyler has been
called to Madrid.
The Bourse closed very weak. The
opinion of the Ministers is more op
timistic than at first, as the full text
of the message has been received and
digested. Even those who took a
gloomy view of the document, now
express themselves as more hopeful.
I sum up public opinion, kowe ver,.

PRIVATEERS TO
BE DISPATCHED
TO THE PACIFIC
Purpose of the Spanish Govern
ment in Buying the Ships of
the German Lines.
NEW YORK, April 13. â A Washington special to the Herald says:
Official confirmation was given to-day to the Herald's exclusive announce
ment this morning of the departure of the armored cruisers Vizcaya and
Almirante Oquendo from Porto Rico for the Cape Verde Islands, where the
Spanish torpedo-boat flotilla is lying. It is said they left San Juan five days
ago and are expected to arrive at their destination within the next two or
three days.
In accordance with instructions given by the Spanish Minister of Marine,
the mobilization of the Spanish naval force at Cadiz continues. Official in
formation was received at the Navy Department to-day of the arrival at that
point of the steel battleship Pe/ayo. This force will be further increased by
the auxiliary steamers Normania and Columbia, which ought to arrive at
Cadiz to-morrow. Spain is scurrying the European market for desirable
merchant ships which can be transformed into auxiliary cruisers. This
official information reached the authorities here to-day from Lieutenant A. P.
Niblack, Naval Attache in Berlin.
No confirmation has been received of the rumored purchase by Spain of
the Saale and Spree of the North German Lloyd line. Should it prove true,
and should war break out within the next few days, it can be stated on ex
cellent authority that the Saale, at least, will never fly the Spanish flag. Ac
cording to the Herald's shipping news, the Saale will arrive at New York on
Saturday next. With hostilities in progress and with the knowledge that the
Saale has been sold to Spain, there is no doubt that the Government would
seize the vessel at New York and impress her into the American naval
service. The Spree is believed to be in German waters, so it would be im
possible to reach her.
Besides the Spree, the Saa/e, the Normania and the Columbia, Germany
has other merchant ships especially built for conversion into auxiliary
cruisers, and which it is believed here her agents are inspecting. These in
clude the Fuerst Bismarck of 10,500 tons, the Augusta Victoria of 10,300
tons, belonging to the Hamburg-American line, and the Kaiser Friedrhh of
12,800 tons and twenty-one knots, and the Havel of 8900 tons and nineteen
knots, belonging to the North German Lloyds.
Confidence is expressed by the authorities that Spain is purchasing these
vessels not so much for duty as auxiliary cruisers as for service as privateers.
There is little doubt that an attempt would be made to dispatch them to the
Pacific with a view to harassing American commerce on that side.

ONE DAY'S DELAY
BEFORE THE FINAL
PLUNGE IS MADE
To-Day Congress Will Put the Matter
Once More Into the Hands
of the President.
Both Houses Will Declare for Intervention With
Arms, Which Spain Has Said She Can
Under No Circumstances Tolerate.
NEW YORK, April 13.â The Her
ald's Washington correspondent tele
graphs: Congress is plunging rapidly
in the direction of war.
It is all war talk again to-night.
There is not even the element of de
lay which yesterday offered some hope
of peace. Both houses are rushing
madly ahead. They are responding to
the President's message promptly and
emphatically, and going far beyond
what the President hoped for or ex
pected. With the American Congress
bent on war, the Spanish Government
making no headway under the armis
tice proposition, and the Spanish Cortes
soon to meet and thereby complicate an
already excited condition in Spain, it is
hard to figure out a single hope for
pcav.c.
Congress is almost sure to direct
armed intervention. This means war.
In what form intervention will be au
thorized is not yet definitely settled.
There are details yet to be effected in
the House and Senate resolutions, but
the form of words makes little differ
ence. Both the resolutions of the Sen
ate and the House imply the same ef
fort on the part of the United States.
Anything that Congress may do,
the least thing Congress can do, in
its present temper, would mean armed
intervention at once and this will not
be accepted by Spain as anything less
than a hostile act.
The House acted promptly by an
overwhelming majority. There may be
some delays in the Senate in reaching
a final vote, but the consideration of the
grave subject will not lag. Beginning
to-morrow, the Senate will hold con
tinuous session until a vote has been
taken. Senator Chandler gave notice

THESE RESOLUTIONS
MAY MEAN A WAR
TO SET CUBA FREE
WASHINGTON, April 13. â This Is the resolution
passed to-day by the House of Representatives:
"WHEREAS, The Government of Spain for three
years past has been waging war on the island of Cuba
against a revolution by the inhabitants thereof without
making any substantial progress toward the suppres
sion of said revolution, and has conducted the warfare in
a manner contrary to the laws of nations by methods in
human and uncivilized, causing the death by starvation
of more than 200,000 innocent non-combatants, the vic
tims being for the most part helpless women and chil
dren, inflicting Intolerable injury to the commercial In
terests of the United States, involving the destruction
of lives and property of many of our citizens, entailing
the expenditure of millions of dollars in patrolling our
coasts and policing the high seas in order to maintain our
neutrality, and
"Whereas, This long series of losses, Injuries and
burdens for which Spain is responsible has culminated
in the destruction of the United States battle-ship Maine
in the harbor of Havana and in the death of* 266 of our
seamen,
"Resolved, That the President Is hereby authorized
and directed to intervene at once to stop the war in Cuba
to the end and the purpose of securing permanent peace
and order there and establishing a stable and independ
ent government of their own In the island of Cuba: and
the President is hereby authorized and empowered to
use the land and naval forces of the United States to exe
cute the purposes of this resolution."
to-day that no business other than the
consideration of the intervention reso
lution should come before the Senate.
This was unnecessary, as the
minds of the majority of the Senate
are made up to reach a conclusion at
the earliest possible moment and end
the suspense.
The present expectation is that the
Senate will reach a vote on Friday, but
the Senate is an uncertain body, and
when sober second thought is brought
out by some of the conservative men
THE SENATE RESOLUTION.
WASHINGTON, April 13.â The resolutions presented to the Sen
ate are as follows:
Whereas, The abhorrent conditions which have existed tor more
than three years in the Island of Cuba, so near our own borders, have
shocked the moral sense of the people of the United States, have
been c disgrace to Christian civilization, culminating, as they have.
In the destruction of a United States battleship with 266 of its officers
and crew, while on a friendly visit to the harbor of Havana, and
cannot longer be endured, as has been set forth by the President of
the United States in his message to Congress of April 11, 1898, upon
which the action of Congress was invited: therefore,
Resolved, Firstâ That the people of the island of Cuba are and
of right ought to be free and independent.
Secondâ That it b the duty of the Government of the United
States to demand and the Government of the United States does
hereby demand that the Government of Spain at once relinquish its
authority and government in the island of Cuba and withdraw Its
land and naval forces from Cuba and Cuban waters.
Thirdâ That the President of the United States be and he hereby
Is directed and empowered to use the entire land and naval forces of
the United States and to call into actual service of the United states
the militia of the several States to such an extent as may be neces
sary to carry these into effect.
perhaps action may be delayed some
days longer. The conservative Sen
ators worked hard to-day to stem the
tide. Senators Hanna, Elkins, Aldrich,
Hale, Hoar and Spoonerâ the entire
coterie who seek delay â were in con
stant conference.
The only move made in the direc
tion of delay was that by Senator Hoar,
who succeeded in having consideration
postponed until to-morrow.
As the day wore on the conserva
tive Senators became more and more
convinced of their inability to pre
vent positive action.
Had a vote been taken to-day the
amendment proposed by four members
.of the committee /ecognjzinjKjttg indc-.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
SENATE WILL
ACT TO-DAY
WASHINGTON, April 13.â
Senator Perkins expressed the
opinion to-night that the Senate
Committee would to-morrow
adopt the resolution passed by
the House to-day, and that the
Senate discussion would be brief
and the resolution passed before
adjournment to-morrow night.
pendence of the Cuban republic would
have been adopted. This may still be
the case, because it is favored by nearly
all the Democrats and by many Re
publicans and Populists.
At the same time the action in the
House in voting down a similar propo
sition^ will have its effect, and in addi
tion the statement was made at the
Capitol to-day that the President would
probably veto the resolution if it went to
him with recognition incorporated.
In view of the declaration for indepen
dence that is already contained in the
Senate resolution, it is probable that
recognition- will lose ground be
tween now and to-morrow. Assum
ing that the Senate will pass the reso
lutions now before it there will than2
come a clash between the House and
the Senate as to the form in which the
resolutions shall finally be passed. An
effort will be made to have the House
accept the Senate resolution, and thus
avoid the necessity for a conference
committee. This may or may not suc
ceed.
The influence of the administra
tion will be strongly urged against
the Senate resolution. The President
would much prefer the House resolu
tion, as that is in line with his mes
sage more nearly.
Its adoption by both houses would
still leave chance for avoiding war.
Representative Maguire of California,
one of the strongest lawyers of the
Democratic side, takes the view that the
resolution passed will largely remove
the possibility of war. He said: "The
resolution is meaningless so far as it
forces action. It practically leaves
action in the discretion of the Presi
dent. It authorizes and empowers him
to use the land and naval forces of the
United States to stop the war in Cuba
and to aid the Cubans to establish an
independent government. It directs
him to do nothing. The effect of this
lodgment of power in the President will
immediately invite the intervention of
the European powers. '
"In this lies the danger of very se
rious and embarrassing complications.
By this we are led into an error which
we have steered clear of for a hundred
years. It will be next to impossible
for the President to resist the demand
which the powers will make.
"If he does resist it he will show a
strength of character which has not
been suggested by anything that he has
yet done. In this case what will the
powers do? It is my firm conviction
that unless the Resolution is amended
in the Senate there will be no war, but
there will be instead a superabundance
of diplomatic complications."
The scathing arraignment of Spain in
the. report of the Senate committee is
one of the sensational features of the
day. The report was written by Senator
Davis, chairman of the Senate commit
tee, and is without doubt one of the
strongest documents of its kind ever
submitted to the Senate. It would tend
more than anything else that has hap
pened thus far to aggravate an already
complicated situation. Its very remark
able extension of the Monroe doctrine
is likely to stir up a great international
row.
From an international point of view
the report will attract attention in every
capital of the civilized world and will
undoubtedly be quoted as a precedent
in American history for all time to
come.
In its consideration of the Monroe
doctrine the report contains the fol
lowing striking paragraphs:
"We cannot consent, upon any con
ditions, that the depopulated portions
of Cuba shall be colonized by Spain
any more than she should be allowed
to found a new colony in any other
part of this hemisphere or island
thereof. Either act is regarded by
the United States as dangerous to
peace and safety.
''The Monroe doctrine has kept the
powers of Europe out of the Ameri
can continent ever since it was pro
mulgated. It was a distinct an-
nouncement that the United States
would intervene under certain cir-
cumstances in the affairs of every
Central American and South Ameri
can State."
The President's message contained
no reference to the -action of the Euro
pean powers. These sentences from
the report are the answer of the Senate.
They show very plainly that European
interference in the affairs of the West
ern Hemisphere is not to be tolerated
by the United States.
IS A WORTHY CHRISTIAN.
Dr. George C. Adams, pastor of the
First Congregational Church, is adverse
to entering into a controversy with At
torney C. W. Harris, who wrote him a
satirical and caustic letter last month
criticizing his attitude on Christian so
cialism and hit? opposition to Professor
Herrin.
After the receipt of the letter the pastor
of the well-known church took counsel
with some of the leading members of his
congregation, and they were of the same
opinionâ that he should not answer it.
The doctor disclaims being an anti-Her
rinite, but states he has the greatest re
spect and admiration for the learned pro
r. "I am sure." he said, "that he is
a most worthy Christian, and were he but
here I would invite him Into my pulpit I
believe I have the liberty to differ from
him, as I would any other Christian.
There is no truth in the statement that
I answered Mr. Harris in my paper before
the ministers' meeting last Monday. I
delivered my sermon, 'If Jesus Come
isow, wholly without notes, and there
was nothing said in answer to his letter
"This is the second communication I
have received from Mr. Harris, and al

church and therefore could not have left

The following is the text of the re
port of the minority of the House For
eign Affairs Committee in support of Its
resolution for the intervention and re
cognition of the Cuban insurgents:
We, the undersigned members of the
I Committee on Foreign Affairs of the
; House of Representatives, having con
sidered the message of the President of
! the United States which was transmitted
to Congress on Monday, April 11, 1898,
I and on that day referred to said commit
tee, submit the following report to the
House of Representatives:
We recommend the following resolu
tions as a substitute for the resolutions
submitted by the majority of the Com- i
mittee on Foreign Affairs:
Joint resolution-
Resolved, That the United States Gov
ernment hereby recognize the independ
ence of the republic of Cuba.
Secondâ That, moved thereto by many
considerations of humanity, of interest
and of provocation, among which are the
deliberate mooring of our battle-ship
Maine over a submarine mine and its
destruction in the harbor of Havana, the
President of the United States be and
he is hereby directed to employ imme
j diately the land and' naval forces of the
United States in aiding the republic of
Cuba to maintain the independence here-
I by recognized.
I Thirdâ That the President of the United
States is hereby authorized and directed
to extend immediate relief to the starv
j Ing Cubans.
In support of the first resolution, guided
by motives of humanity, and interest, in
fluenced by divers provocations, among
which are the deliberate mooring of our
battle-ship Maine over a submarine mine,
its ruthless destruction in the harbor of j
Havana and the death of 266 seamen, we
submit the facts to the House, to our
countrymen and to the world.
For more than a quarter of a century,
with short intervals, a revolution has
been in progress in Cuba, destroying our
commerce and causing financial loss to
our citizens and unprecedented mortality
| among the contending factions. For more '
than three years the Cuban patriots have i
struggled for freedom with courage, for
titude and self-abnegation unexcelled in
the annals of the human race. These
people are our near neighbors, closely
connected with us by ties of business and
of friendship. In their aspirations for
liberty they have been animated by our
example and have modeled their form of
government upon ours.
During these three years the Spaniards
nave butchered the people, starved help
loss women, children and old men by
hundreds of thousands and have wasted
the island by fire and sword in violation
of all the rules of civilized warfare. These
acts of barbarous cruelty have filled the
American people with horror 'and they
are practically unanimously in favor of
recognizing the independence of the gov
ernment established by that brave and
heroic people by the expenditure of so
m^ich treasure and so much blood, and
our people will be satisfied with nothing
The Government which the Cubans
have established has all the forms of a
republic, and is a republic in fact, based
on manhood suffrage, executive and leg
islative departments in fuii operation and
with a judicial department perfect as far
as the exigencies of the situation permit.
They levy and collect taxes, disburse
large sums of money, conduct a postal
system, maintain an army of 30 000 men
in the field, have defended themselves
successfully against 225,000 Spanish sol
diers, 135.000 of whom are in hospitals or
in their graves, and are now in undis
puted possession of three-fourths of the
island. Outside her picket lines Spain
possesses not one foot of Cuban soil.
Within her picket lines three-fourths of
the population are insurgents at heart,
who will cordially participate in the re
publican government as soon as the
Spaniards evacuate the island.
With these facts staring us in the face
we must realize that Spain can never con
quer Cuba and that ultimately we must
recognize the independence of the Cuban
republic. This being the case, the sooner j
we act the better. for all concerned, there- '
by putting an end to the . sacrifice of
human fife and the destruction of proper
ty. We urge the unequivocal recognition j
of the independence of the Cuban repub
lic because the Cuban patriots merit such
recognition by their valor and prowess in
arms; because recognition, is , the plain, I
honest, courteous, manly course, and will \
remove from the minds. of all men any i
suspicion that we ,are preparing .to wage
a war of conquest- and to annex the isl
and from motives of sordid greed or as
the beginning of a policy of imperial ag- |
grandizement. ' " . " .-''â â  â  ';' '.'â >
We urge 'the recognition of the existing !
republic because under international law j
only an existing government can be recog- j
nized, and because, recognizing the pres
ent republic, we lift from the minds of \
the Cuban patriots the fear that we will i
force upon them a government: which j
they do not want; we urge because with- '
out such recognition, in- the event of -war |
between Spain and the American i repub
lic, it would be a war against Cuba also, '
for until the recognition of â â  her independ- |
ence^she is. in the contemplation of inter- '
national law, still a part of, Spain ..;
'. Recognizing' the. independence of the re
public -vvhT gire the- Cubans: credit among !
the. nations of the world, thereby en
abling them 40 use all their resources to
the utmost and- will influence men of
' other countries to ' reinforce the Cubans
with the assurance that they will be
treated as soldiers and will not be hanged
as traitors, filibusters or pirates in the '
event of capture. ' â  '
' We urge the passage of the second res
olution, providing for armed intervention,
as a necessary and logical sequence to the i
recognition to the Independence of the I
Cuban republic' ,-;. : . -â  v- >â¢:-
Facts must be considered as they actu
ally, exist, not as we would, have them,
and one of the most . potent or patent
facts of the 5 situation is that Spain re
fuses to realize what all the rest of the
world knows to be trueâ that Cuba has
passed from her control â  forever. This
being the case, she will hold on with the
strength of , despair to fragments ,of the

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 14, 1898.
SCHLEY RECEIVES
ORDERS TO DRILL
FLYING SQUADRON
When the Vessels fire \r) pSJhting
Trin) They Will Be Sent to a
Better Strategic Point.
NEW YORK, April 13.â A Washington special to the Herald says:
"Proceed to southern drill grounds for maneuvers and target practice
to continue for a period of forty-eight hours, upon expiration of
which return to Hampton Roads. Direct Minneapolis and Columbia to
undergo speed trials."
In effect these are the instructions telegraphed to Commodore W.
S. Schley, commander-in-chief of the flying squadron, this morning,
which caused him to leave his anchorage off Fortress Monroe at 2
o'clock this afternoon and proceed to sea. It can be authoritative
ly stated that Commodore Schley has no other instructions. Should
it be deemed advisable while he is at sea to direct him to sail to a
better strategic point than Hampton Roads, or should war come, In
structions will be sent to him by one of the vessels now lying at Nor
folk or at Hampton Roads to-morrow.
When it became known among the officers of the department short
ly after noon that orders had been given to Commodore Schley to sail
considerable interest was manifested which developed into great ex
citement when Secretary Long declined to state the cause of the ves
sels being dispatched to sea or to their destination. The Secretary's
action is in accordance with his decision not to hereafter divulge the
character of orders given to ships on the ground that it might give
Information to a possible enemy, and, also, because, when war comes
he does not wish to be put in the position of affirming or denying the
destination of ships or squadrons.
Of considerable importance is the experimental trip of Commodore
Schley's squadron. It is practice preparatory to action. The ser
vice of the Minneapolis and Columbia since placed out of commission
a year ago has consisted of the cruises they made from League Is
land to Hampton Roads. The Brooklyn, Texas and Massachusetts,
while attached to the North Atlantic squadron, engaged in various
maneuvers and are, therefore, familiar with squadron evolutions, but
the commerce destroyers have not undergone fleet practice under their
present commanding officers, and it is desirable that Commodore
Schley shall make his force as much of a unit as possible within the
short time he will remain at sea. The trials of the Columbia and
Minneapolis have been ordered to determine the speed and ability of
their engines to stand the strain of racing, and finally gun practice is
necessary to test the guns and mounts, particularly the elevating gear
of the eight-inch guns of the Brooklyn, which were repaired last week.
The Herald has stated that the authorities are desirous of sta
tioning the flying squadron at a better strategic point than Hampton
Roads. It is generally understood that the squadron will first pro
ceed to Porto Rico, and thence to European waters, and It is, there
fore, considered a wise plan to put the ships as near Porto Rico as
possible in order that no time will be lost after hostilities have com
menced. There has been some talk of having the ships drop down as
far south as Port Royal, but this would not be any great gain in
amount of distance saved, and the officials have therefore considered
the advisability of having one vessel go to Bermuda or St. Thomas.
No action, however, has yet been taken. The drill grounds to which
point the squadron was ordered to-day was about fifteen miles from
Hampton Roads, and a vessel carrying supplementary instructions to
those given Commodore Schley before his departure can cover the dis
tance from Fortress Monroe within a few hours.
LEO XIII IS
MUCH UPSET
The Pope Did All in His
Power to Prevent
War.
Feels Keenly Disappointed Over
the Prospect of a Near
Conflict.
Pontiff Had Arranged to Send Monks
Throughout Cuba to Preach
the Gospel of Peace.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, April 13.â The Rome corre
spondent of the Daily News says: The
Pope is exceedingly upset by the latest
developments of the Hispano-American
question, which seems turning in a way
he had expected and tried to avoid.
This morning, having said mass in the
Sistine Chapel, he turned to those
around him and exclaimed:
"I have prayed God with the whole
force of my being and with the deepest
fervor to avoid this war and not to al
low the Pontifical Â»fforts to end in
smoke of battle. Otherwise, I have
implored the Almighty to take me to
himself that I may not behold such a
sight."
Those present say that the aged Pon
tiff spoke with such real emotion that
his words deeply touched all. After
mass, the Pope and Cardinal Rampolla
conferred together for an hour and
then were joined by the Spanish Em
bassador, who was the bearer of the
war tidings.
I learn that one of the projects of
the Pope, if the chief obstacle to peace
had been a refusal by the insurgents
to accept an armistice, was to instruct
the Bishop of Havana to send Capucine
monks to- preach peace and moderation
to the people all over the island.
The Pope has sent a dispatch t Em
peror Franz fosef, in answer to a
telegram from his majesty to a mes
sage in Italian, thanking him for his
kindness and for the way in which he
has responded to the Pope's request.
The Pontiff begged him to make a last
trial by using his good offices with the
heads of oth<-r states to spare the world
the horrors of war. It Is patent to all
Leo XIII has done everything human
that is possible, but war is now con
sidered inevitable even by the most
optimistic.

Washington, April 13.
Bishop Saterlee of the Episcopal
church has issued the following address
to the members of his diocese:
Diocese of Washingtonâ My Dear
Brethren of the Clergy and Laity: The
chief magistrate of the United States,
who under God is the chief ruler 01 our
country, has in his message to Congress
set forth the only conditions upon which
in his judgment we can enrage in a
Christian warfare, and also under which,
to use his own word, our aspirations as
a Christian and peace-loving people can
be realized. It will be a grave responsi
bility if war is undertaken under any
other conditions, and our country, acting
through dimness, will be held account
able by God and by the civilized world at
large if her lirst aim is not for truth and
justice, peace and happiness. I invoke
you all as the servants of that Prince of
peace to whom all power is now given in
heaven and on earth to remember in
earnest prayer those in the Government
of the United States who are charged
with this God-given responsibility; and
tv pray that God will bestow upon them
a right judgment in all things and grant
that they may both perceive and know
what things they ought to do and also
may have grace and power faithfully to
fullill the Bame.
I herewith set forth a prayer to be
used at this present time in all the pub
lic services of the Protestant Episcopal
church in the diocese of Washington:
Ministerâ Give peace in our time, O Lord.
Peopleâ For It is thnu Lord only that maketh
the UnitMl States dwell in safety.
Ministerâ Give peace hi our time, O Lord.
Peopleâ For it is thou Lord that maketh the
wars to cease in all the world.
Ministerâ Give peace in our time, O Lord.
People â Because there is none other that
flghteth for us but only thou, O God.
COLLECT.
Most gracious God, we humbly beseech thee
for the people of these United States In gen
eral, so especially for the President and Cabi
net and for the Senate and Representatives
In Congress assembled; save them from all
error, ignorance, pride and prejudice and of
thy gTeat mercy vouchsafe, we beseech thee,
so to direct, sanctify and govern them In their
present work, by the mighty power of the Holy
Ghost, that peace and happiness, truth and
justice, religion and piety may be established
among us for all generations; through him to
whom all power Is given in heaven and on
earth, our risen Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
Amen.
Faithfully your brother,
HENRY T. SATERLEE,
Bishop of Washington.

LONDON TIMES
REBUKES CONGRESS
Copyrighted, 1898. by James Gordon
Bennett.
LONDON, April 14.â The Times,
commenting editorially this
morning on the resolutions sub
mitted yesterday to Congress,
says:
"They embody demands which
cannot be addressed to a sover
eign power without rendering
negotiation and compromise im
possible. Even If they do not
amount in form to a declaration
of war, these resolutions are ac
companied by violent and offen
sive reports offering gratuitous
provocation to the Spanish Gov
ernment and people in the eyes
of the civilized world. The
American case cannot but be
seriously prejudiced by the man
ner in which it is now presented.
We doubt, after yesterday's
scenes, whether Congress is a fit
body to deal with a great na
tional issue or to act as the aven
ger of wrong. The situation is
that Congress has declared for
war in everything but name, al
though without having defined,
except in the vaguest manner,
objects for which it wishes to
fight.
DEFENDED BY
THE BRITISH
London Papers Uphold
President McKin
ley's Policy.
If Opposed to War He Would
Not Have Written the Mes
sage He Did.
All the Papers of the English Metropo
lis Agree That Uncle Sara Is
Heading lor War.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON. A ril 14.â Editorials in the
leading papers assert that "America is
heading deliberately for war," and that
there is only the faintest chance now
that the delay will still enable c peace
ful solution.
The Daily lews cays: "Th<Â» true
meaning of President McKinley's ac
tions cannot be mistaken. If he were
Opposed to war he would not have
written such message. He has been
most unfairly attacked for an alleged
ab lication of his power. The fact is, |
he has done the utmost he could to
avoid war, but he did not make the
American constitution, which entrusts
a war declaration to Congress."
The Daily chronicle, which similarly
defends President MeKinley against
criticism, says that "the Times news
paper, with the accustomed fatuity of â¢
its treatment of American affairs, makes '
against him," and adds: "America is
being driven along by the elementary
forces which her best statesmen and
shrewdest financiers cannot control."
The Standard says: "The steady
current toward war reminds us of the
course of the Niagara River above the
falls. There seems to have been a few
slight disturbances on the surface of
the stream in th- thape of something
like the personal encounters in the
House of Representatives, but there
has been no check or diminution of the
strength of the current."
The Daily Mail thinks that "events
are moving in the most desirable direc
tion and giving America time to per
fect her preparations to insure a speedy
victory."
The Daily Telegraph, looking to the
likelihood that after Spain has
been defeated, the Cubans will
not submissively accept terms
America may choose to impose,
says: "It is no light task that
America has undertaken in the interest
of humanity, but one that will tax the
i resourcefulness and statesmanship of
| her rulers to the very utmost."
The Daily Graphic says: "The war
will not be child's play. There will be
tragedies on the seas, but there will be
worse tragedies in Cuba, where the
United States will have to face an army
of one hundred thousand men."
The St. James Gazette says: "The
j system of conducting delicate diplom-
I acy through rival committees is not
i commendable generally and has led in
j this instance to deplorable results.
i General Fitzhugh Lee, who makes war
like speech s and openly esu uses the
! cause of the insurgents and declares
i that the time has arrived for action
; against the friendly power to which he
S was accredited, is setting the to:ie in
i America. He is not a cautious man
I like General Woodford or President Mc-
Kinley. So the fire-eaters and the
I sword-wavers are to have their way
because the cautious and experienced
men are timid and do not possess the
firmness or the courage to declare their
decision and insist upon it."
The Westminster Gazette says: "If
the proposed resolutions pass it means
the Americans have cut themselves off
from peace. They will have done so de
liberately after much thought and con
sideration, provocation and in spite of
concessions upon which at least a tem
porary peace might have been patched
up. It will be their choice, and we can
only hope they have counted the cost."
The Pall Mall Gazette supports Presi
dent McKinley, saying: "He has com
ported himself with skill and propriety
throughout. As a result he is now able
to take a line which will not fail to get
America solid around him. The crisis
has come and it finds the President
ready to act."
PARIS, April 13.â The Temps com
menting upon the Cuban situation says:
"By a curious contradiction, President
McKinley renounces the diplomatic
path at the moment when he was be
ginning to gather the first precious
fruits of his activity. He gives up the
reins and direction to Congress at the
very moment there is supreme danger
in slackening his hold of this impatient
team and when it would have been
comparatively easy to obtain the upper
hand."
After Two More Liners.
LONDON, April 13.â The Daily Mail
says the United States Government is
negotiating for the purchase of the Cu
narder Lucania and the North German
Lloyd steamer Kaiser Friedrich, which
is not yet finished.
A Long Look Ahead.
The politicians are even now beginning to
weigh the possibilities involved in the next
Presidential election. The papers are lull of
electioneering gossip, and venture predictions
as to the future which are somewhat too s-lf
confldent. But it is safe to say that a .Â«> s
tematic course of Hoetetter's Htomach Bitters
will renew health in the malarious, bilious,
rheumatic, costive or nervous.
NOW COMES
THE CHINA
The Big Mail Steamer May
Be Added to the Fleet
in the Pacific.
Two Naval Boards Have Ex
amined the Vessel and. Filed
Favorable Reports.
Possesses Speed and Coal-Carryin
Capacity Sufficient for an Auxiliary
Cruiser.
The Pacific Mall Company's steam
ship China will probably be the next
merchant vessel of the Pacific fleet to
be added to the Asiatic squadron of
America's navy. Negotiations are now
in progress for the purchase of the ves
sel, and it is expected they will be con
cluded in a few days. The China is
now at Yokohama, having arrived
there yesterday from this port, and it
is expected she may be fitted up for
service on the other side of the Pacific
if such can be accomplished in a
friendly port during the progress of
hostilities with Spain. Th Navy De
partment has had a sharp eye on the
China for several weeks. She is so
constructed that she could carry a
large armament and be a powerful ves
sel in offensive warfare against the
Spanish possessions in the Fax East.
She has large coal-carrying capacity
and great speed, and could carry on an
active campaign far from her base of
coal supplies for many days before be
ing, obliged to return for fuel.
When the China was in Yokohama
6fx weeks ago she was boarded by a
corps of naval engineers and ship con
structors who are now attached to the
vessels of the Asiatic fleet, and a care
ful survey of the steamer was made.
In due time the report reached the
Navy Department in Washington, and
it was so satisfactory that negotiations
were at once commenced for the pur
chase of the vessel should the relations
with Spain become such that hostili
ties could not be avoided. While the
steamer was lying in this port a few
days previous to her sailing on March
23 another board of naval engineers in
spected the vessel.
The members of the board went
aboard as railroad men from the East,
giving the impression to her crew that
they were only on a trip to gratify their
curiosity, claiming that an ocean
steamer was something of a novelty to
them. They took in the minutest detail
of her construction and examined her
engines in a critical manner. Their re
port was even more decisive as to the
fitness of the vessel for a commerce
destroyer and auxiliary cruiser and on
the strength of it every hour is now ex
pected to bring word that the Govern
ment desires the steamer, and to turn
her over to some representative of the
navy at the earliest possible moment.
The China has been plying between
this and Asiatic ports for the last eight
years. She is the pride of the Pacific
Mail fleet and the most popular of the
transpacific vessels running out of San
Francisco. She is now flying the Ha
waiian flag, but up to a few months
ago she was claimed by the English
registry. She was built in Glasgow by
the Fairfield Ship Building Company,
and was launched in 1889. She came
out to this coast soon after she touched
the water and ever since she has been
running between this port and Hono
lulu, Yokohama and Hongkong. She is
a four-masted steel steamer with triple
expansion engines and capable of main
taining a speed of about eighteen knots.

INFORMATION
He Knows All About the
Fortifications of Ha-

Tells the Naval Strategic Board
What He Saw While
in Cuba.
Members of That Body Think HÂ« Has
Rendered Most Valuable
Assistance.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
NEW YORK, April IS.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
General Lee grave valuable information
to-day to the Naval Strategic Board,
which is engaged in drawing up a plan
of campaign against Spain. He ap-
peared at 11 o'clock before the board
and for two hours studied maps of
Cuba, pointed out weak spots in the
Spanish fortifications, described the
:haracter and range of the guns
mounted thereon, and made suggestions
of the points which would be attacked,
which members of the toard believe will
aid them materially in the task with
which they are wrestling.
Concerning General Lee's testimony,
a member of the board said to me to
day: "General Lee threw light on a
number of points with which the board
had been struggling. He was a splen
did observer while at his post, and ful-
ly understands the fortifications of Ha
vana and their guns, and he was able
to describe them, their points of loca
tion, their range, and such other mat
ters as would appeal to the military
mind. I liked his style of del very.
Every thought was evidently carefully
considered before it was spoken, and
consequently the board relies greatly
on the information he submitted and
the advice he was asked to give."
STABLEMEN'S ASSOCIATION.
A Constitution Has Been Adopted
and Temporary Officers Elected.
The meeting of liverymen, or rather
the proprietors of stables in which
horses are boarded, of which a notice
appeared in yesterday's Call, has crys-
Uiilized itself into a premancnt organiza-
tion.
At the meeting held over Bridge's sta
ble a few nights since a constitution was
adopted, in which an association was
formed for the protection of all who may
become members. At present eighty-six
of the San Francisco stablemen have
signed the constitution, leaving about
twenty-five out, who, it is expected, will
sign before the next meeting of the as
sociation.
At the meeting just held C. S. Critten
den, one of the oldest stablemen in the
I city, was elected president, W. K. Bridge
vice president and Stanly W. Morehead
secretary.
The constitution provides for a direc
tory of nine members, with three stand
ing committees, whose powers are al-
I most unlimited in providing rules, terms
I and conditions eoverning the association.
j The annual election for offlers will be held
on the first Monday in Ja.nuarv nf otci>
year, at which time the standing com
; mittees will be appointed, aa also a
board of directors.
A schedule of prices for the boarding
I of all horses will be adopted by the com
mittee having charge of that particular
branch of the association'es rules.
Stables will be classified into three
grades. The first will be known as class
A, the second as class B and the third as
class C. This classification means the
relative standing of the various stables
as they are now recognized.REPRESENTATIVES
FOR INTERVENTION
After One of the Most Exciting Scenes
In Its History, the House Vir=
tually Declares War.
Call OffloÂ«, Rtggs House,
Washington, April 13.
The House of Representatives to-day
after one of the most exciting and
memorable days In its history, by a
vote of 322 to 19, adopted a resolution
which nine-tenths of its members be
lieve makes war with Spain inevitable.
It Is a fact which was grimly com
mented upon to-day by members as
they spoke of the future, that every
war in which the United States figured
began In April, and that to-day was
the anniversary of the fall of Fort
Bumter, which aroused the patriotic
fever of the North and made the four
years of civil strife a certainty. The
resolutions adopted direct the President
to intervene at once In Cuba to re
store peace and secure to the people of
this island "a stable and independent
government of their own," and author
izes him to use the army and navy to
execute the purpose of the resolutions.
Although only nineteen members â fif
teen Democrats, three Republicans and
one Populist â dissented upon the final
vote, the proceedings were marred by
a bitter and acrimonious display of
partisan feeling. During the height of
the excitement the lie was passed be
tween Brumm (R.) of Pennsylvania
and Bartlett (D.) of Georgia, and a dis
graceful scene followed that almost de
scended to the level of a free fight.
Order was finally restored and later
the two members found that the alter
cation had arisen out of a misunder-
Ftandlnpr, whereupon there were mu
tual apologies. Later In the proceed
ings the Speaker was obliged to again
call upon the sergeant-at-arms with his
silver mace, the emblem of the House's
authority, to seat Johnson of Indiana,
who was indignantly remonstrating
against what he termed the "unneces
sary war into which the country was
being plunged."
Only forty minutes were given for de
bate and special rules were required to
get the resolutions before the House.
The minority resolutions, which de
â ! fur the recognition of the ex
isting government of the insurgents,
voted down â 147 to 190 â but they
Becured the votes of three Republicans.
Some stirring and patriotic sentiments
voiced during the debate, which
the ealleries and the members to
a hitrh pitch of enthusiasm.
Adams of Pennsylvania, acting
chairman of the Foreign Affairs Com
mittee, and Dinsmore <L>.) of Arkansas,
the senior minority member of the com
mittee, were the only members who
had ;'.;: opportunity to speak directly to
the rp-sc-iutions, but Henderson of lowa,
i and McMlllln of Ten
â¢ each made speeches upon the
i i >rtier.
Th< Capitol was again like a be
red citadel. Thousands upon thou
armed into the corridors and
to witness the scenes and to
the stirring oratory- The galler
ies of the House were a solid mass of
humanity, and on the floors excited
members in groups were discussing the
situation.
Adams, acting chairman of the For
eign Affairs Committee, came into the
hall with a copy of the Senate resolu
tions and was immediately surrounded
and forced to read them aloud to half a
hundred members who gathered In the
main aisle.
Trifling matters occupied the attention
of the House for the first hour, while the
members and the spectators In the gal

members waa almost unendurable,

"I ask for the regular order," shouted

"Which is an objection," observed
Bailey.
"Is ther^ any objection?" asked the
Speaker, still holding his gavel aloft.
Bailey sought to interpose with a re
quest Luat th^ ~Â»lnorlty resolutions be
read, but the Speaker Insisted that if ob
jection was to be made it must be made,
"Then the chair is determined to force
the minority." cried Bailey, amid much
oonfusion and cries of "regular order."
Then Bailey, turning and facing the
floor, entered an objection in emphatic
tones. The whole Democratic side rose

Offlc* Houra-8 a. in. to 10 p. m.; Sundays Â« to a p. to. - Â»â "â¢Â«.,
Â©f the Democrats ajrainst the taunting
words which were coming from the other
side.
Suddenly in his rear, the next tier of
seats, came in stentorian tones from
Brumm (R.) of Pennsylvania a taunt ad
dressed generally to the Democratic side;
"You got just what you did not want,
he shouted. _ , .
"That is not true," cried out Bartlett,
who it was explained subsequently was
addressing his remarks to a Republican
on the other side.
"1 say it Is," n-torted Brumm, hotly.
"It is' not." flared back Bartlett, turn
ing and facing Brumm.
"You are a liar, " responded Brumm.
Instantly Bartlett reached for a large
bound copy of the Congressional Record
on the desk before him and hurled it at
his adversary. It fell short, and then the
two antagonists rushed for each other.
The House Immediately was in an up
roar. Some of the ladies in the galleries
screamed hysterically. Members crowded
toward thr "combatants from all quarters.
They ran across the area in front of the
Speaker's desk and crowded up the ad
joining aisles, clinching, tugging, hauling
at each other like madmen. It was like a
free tight in the street. Shouts of anger
and indignation were heard on every
hand. Members in the crush espoused the
two original combatants and there were
several exciting collisions, but no blows
struck.
Meantime Bartlett and Brumm were
trying to get at each other over the
benches, but they were borne back by
friends. Bartlett, who is a slight man,
was carried off his feet, and Myers of
Indiana, a stalwart, broad-shouldered
Hoosler, blocked the path of Brumm. who
is himself a man of great physical vigor.
In his efforts to stop Brumm, Myers be
came involved with Pierce of Missouri,
and they almost came to blows. All this
time the gavel of the Speaker was heard
above the awful noise and his voice was
commanding the sergeant-at-arms to re
store order. Armed with the great sil
ver mace, the emblem of authority of
the House, Colonel Russell, the sergeant
at-arms. repeatedly charged the thick
mass of struggling members, but was as
often swept aside. One of the other em
ployes. Griffin Halstead. a son of Murat
Halstead, while attempting to pacify
Brumm, was felled by a blow on the jaw.
At last, by the efforts of a dozen muscu
lar members, the belligerents were sepa
rated, the angry legislators retired to
their seats and a semblance of order was
restored. It was one of the most dis
graceful scenes witnessed in the House
in many years.
The effort to get the resolutions before
the House having failed the Committee
on Rules retired and formulated a spe
cial order, which was brought a few
minutes later. It provided for the im
meoiate consideration of the resolutions
reported by the Foreign Affairs Com
mittee. The House was at this time
still laboring under a great stress of sup
pressed excitement. Partisan feeling
was still rampant. Richardson explained
that the rule did not propose to close
debate.
"The sentiment on this side of the
house," said ne, "is almost overwhelm
ingly in favor of action, not talk. â¢ The
time has come in the opinion of the coun
try for action on this great question. It
has been discussed by the public press,
it has been discussed in the pulpit, it has
been discussed in the House and the
benate, it has been discussed at every
fireside in the American republic, and we
believe, Mr. Speaker, that the time has
come, sad as it is, when this country can
no longer stand idly by, everything hav
ing been done by our chief executive to
secure peace on that island without arms
âthe time has come when the last resort
must be appealed to by our country "
1 and my colleagues," replied Bailey
heartily agree to Uie rule which provides
Tor the immediate consideration of this
important resolution. It would not have
been necessary to ask the assistance of
the Committee on Rules if the gentleman
on that side of n.e House had been pa
tient enough to allow those on this side
to propose an understanding with regard
to debate. I 6imply reserved the right to
object in order to ascertain if it was pos
sible to reach an agreement about the
time to be occupied in debate, and, while
the gentleman representing the minority
of that committee was attempting to pre
sent a resolution which has the indorse
ment of himself r-id his associates I was
required neither to consent to the imme
diate consideration of the proposition
presented by the chairman of the com
mittee, nor to deny to my side the rignt
to present its views to the House and to
the country. That I asked only what was
reasonable will be testified to by the
gentleman from Maine (Dingley), be'eause
after the unseemly occurrence, which
came more nearly disgracing the House
of Representatives than any act which has
occurred during my membership in this
body, the gentleman's own sense of fair
ness compelled him to ask the House to
do precisely and only what I asked for
in the beginning. I did not intend to in
terfere with the immediate consideration
of this resolution, but i wanted the coun
try- to unuerstand that (derisive laughter
and jeers on the Republican side) a mem
ber don't pay any attention to him. Mr.
Speaker, I believe I will not disgrace my
self by commentinp- on such behavior as
that. [Applause on the Republican side.]
In conclusion Bailey said: "But sir we
are as ready to meet the question, we" are
as ready to decide It, we are as ready to
take our responsibility with gentlemen
on ,the other side, and we Invite yoâ¢ to
call the rpU. (Applause and cries of
Vote! vote! )
At this point Johnson (R.I of Indiana
stoutly protested against cutting off
members of the House. He entreated
Henderson ' not to be ungenerous enough
to move the previous question until other
gentlemen have had the right to be
heard."
Henderson declined to yield, but he
granted a few minutes to McMillan (D )
of Tennessee, a member of the Committee
on Rules.
Henderson demanded the previous ques
tion against the loud protests of Johnson
of Indiana, who became so violent in his
denunciation of this effort to stifle debate
and not allow a "remonstrance against
Una unnecessary war into which the
country was being plunged" that the
Speaker had to appeal to the sergeant-at
arnis to compel him to take his seat The
rule was then adopted and the resolutions
were again presented, together with those
of the minority report, which were to be
offered as a substitute.
Adams yielded to Dinsmore (D.) of Ar-

COLLIS P. HUNTINGTON
IN FAVOR OF PEACE.
Believes There Is Nothing to Fight
About, and That There Will Be
No War.
Collls P. Huntlngton, despite the
character of the news received from
Washington yesterday, gave it as his
opinion that there would be no war
with Spain. Incidentally he remarked
that he had received two or three tele
grams yesterday from New York on the
subject. Referring to the resolution
by the House, he said:
"I don't think it means war. I un
derstood they were going to pass such
a resolution. I got two or three tele
grams relating to the subject. They
were not from Washington, but from
New York.
"My own' Impression Is that we will
not have any war. There is nothing
to go to war about, that I know of. I
was told they passed a resolution giv
ing the President authority to use the
army and navy of the United States In
any way he thought best. That was
what should have been done. I should
have voted for this If I were in Con
gress. I don't believe any one think*
there is going to be a war. I don't
think Spain had anything to do with
the blowing up of the Maine. A Span
iard might have done it, but that would
not have been Spain. I take it that
we are not going to war for Cuba, for it
don't belong to us, and 1 don't think
we want it. I should like to have the
people there get their freedom from
Spain, but I don't believe it Is our busi
ness to go out of our way, any more
than it is that of other nations, to help
those people.
"Our country ought to be sure she is
right. But if we get into war. wo
should all be for our country, right or
wrong. That is why we ought to be
very careful, because we can't any of
us do less than support the flag when
war is on.
"I do not think a war with Spain
would disturb the business of this coun
try to any great extent. However, we
have more to lose than Spain In the
way of commerce, and she will, there
fore, be able to do more harm to us, at
least for a time, than we will be able to
do to her. She may do our commerce
more harm than most people imagine."

WOULD ENLARGE
THE
MONROE DOCTRINE
Majority Report of the
Senate Foreign Rela
tions Committee Ask
ing Intervention in
Cuba.
"WASHINGTON. April 13.-In the
Senate to-day Davis, chairman of
the Foreign Relations Committee,
submitted the majority report. It
gives a very thorough review of
the entire situation and a strong
presentation of the facts which
had led the committee to its con
clusions. The report takes up the
Maine disaster as the leading topic
for consideration and plunges into
that question in Its first sentence.
Here are the principal points in
the report:
The destruction of the United States
battle-ship Maine, of two of her officers
and of 264 of hor crew in the harbor of
Havana on the nieht of February 15,
1898, excited to an unprecedented de
cree the compassion and resentment of
the American people.
Manifestations r' that resentment
were susucniled. although the reeling
waS not allayed by the self-restraint
of our people, who determined to hold
their Judgment in suspense concerning
their ultimate action until an official
investigation should disclose the cause
of that great disaster and enable them
by direct or circumstantial testimony
to Impute the responsibility therefor.
That investigation has been made.
It was conducted with judicial thor
oughness and deliberation. The diffi
culty of demonstrating by conclusive
proof the cause of that sinister event
was the usual one of exposing plotted
and > â sterlous crimes. No such diffi
culty, however, obscures its official and
. responsible cause.
With animus by Spain so plainly ap
parent that no one can even plausibly
deny its existence, it Is merely one rea
son for the conclusion to which the In
vestigating mind must come in consid
ering the entire subject of the relations
of the United States with their Govern
' ment. It is the opinion of your com
mlttee that the destruction of the Maine
was compassed either by the official act
of the Spanish authorities or was made
' possible by v negligence on their part
so willing and gross as to be equiva
lent in culpability to positive criminal
â  action.
When property and life are destroyed
' by an act which the exercise of dill
. gence by thf person whose duty it is to
use It should have prevented the hap
â  penlng of such an event it Is sufficient
proof that that diligence was not em
ployed. The lime of the explosion It
â  self must have been calculated for the
moment when the Maine should swing
' within the destructive radius of the
. mine.
The duplicity, perfidy and cruelty of
â  the Spanish character, as they always
have been, are demonstrated still to
continue by their manifestations dur
â¢ ing the present war in Cuba. All these
â  circumstances considered cumulatively
warrant the conclusion that the de
â  struction of the Maine was compassed
either by the official act of the Spanish
authorities (and the ascertainment of
â¢ the particular person Is not material),
or was made possible by a negligence on
' their part so willing and gross as to be
. equivalent In culpability to positive
criminal action.
Conflict of opinion among jurists upon
the subject of intervention is very great.
Arntz maintains tliat the right of lnter
â¢ vention exists whÂ»n one state violates
or threatens the rights of another state,
' while, on the oth>*r h;md, Gulzot declares
. that one state has the right to inter
vene in another statt only when its own
safety renders it indispensable. Between
these extremities o( opinion, differences
among publicists are various and Irre
concilable. Professor Hall and others
support the right of Intervention in
cases similar to that of Cuba.
If these '.pinions state the correct
rules, as we believe they do, the right
' of Intervention by the United Statts in
the present instance is undoubtable.
The balance of power and the Monroe
doctrine are both policies of lnterven
. tlon, to be effected In certain contingen
cies In furth. -ranee of national politics,
and to justify which, no canon of inter
national law was ever invoked. The
former has profoundly affected the rela
tions of the European states and the in
dependence of many of those sovereign
ties. The latter has kept the powers of
Europe out of the American continent
ever since it was promulgated. It was a
dlHtlnct announcement that the United
States would Intervene under certain ex
prensofl circumstances in the affairs of
every Central American and South
American state. The United States did
intervene by threat and show of force
In the affairs of Mexico and France and
compelled the evacuation of that repub
lic by a European power whose own
prior Intervention in Mexican affairs had
overthrown a republic and established a
monarch upon the ruins. No publicist
has ever asserted that either of these
policies is part of the law of nations.
Further Justification for interven
tion in the present case Is found
in the fact that it is the only means of
extirpating an otherwise Incurable and
dangerous evil. The conduct of the Eu
ropean powers respecting Turkey has
been pursuant of the policy which im
pels one nation to intervene in theaffairs
of another state to stop cruelty and mas
sacre, and if necessary, to depose it
from sovereignty. The fact that Spain
is a Christian state does not give her
greater warrant to exterminate her sub
jects than Mohammedan Turkey pos
sessed to exterminate hers. The recent
interventions of the European powers In
favor of Turkey and against Greece In
her endeavor to assist the Cretan Insur
gents is familiar history. So. also, is
the intervention of the same powers
which checked the advance of the armies
of Turkey Into (Greece.
We cannot consent upon any condi
tions that depoulated portions of Cuba
shall be colonized by Spain any more
than she could be allowed to foun.l a
new colony in other parts of this hemi
sphere or the islands thereof. Either act
is regarded by the United States as dan
gerous to peace and safety.
Intervention is justifiable and neces
sary for the followinc reasons: The
present situation in Cuba has become
a menace to the peace of the world, and
especially to the peace and safety of ihe
United States. Spain has bid for Euro
pean intervention, thus far, apparently
without success, but the conditions
which make such intervention possible
should be removed at once. For nearly
three years the hostilities in Cuba and
the Spanish administration of that island
have involved this Government In peril
ous relations with Spain and raised
questions of right and responsibility in
Which BO prospect of settlement is ap
parent. So long as these conditions are
allowed to remain unsettled they will
Increase an Irritation which has already
become intolerable, and which will ulti
mately require adjustment by measuies
much more vigorous than now seem ade
quate to compose existing difficulties.
Spain has failed to perform her treaty
obligations and other international duties
toward the United States. To give a
minute specification of the derelictions
would necessarily extend this pape<\
They are the familiar matters of cur
rent history. American citizens hava
been seized and imprisoned without a
shadow of proof, and have been prj
ceeded against by violent irregular forms
in violation of treaty violations.
The assassination of Kuiz, an Ameri
can citizen; was the act of Spanish
officiate, who held him in custody un
warranted by his treaty rights. No
reparation has been made for this act.
although It has been demanded by this
Government. A justifiable cause for in
tervention has been afforded by the bar
barity with which Spain has conducted
her military operations: by her slaugh
ter of captured insurgent soldiers, and
by her extermination of not less than
200,000 of her own non-combatants â
men, women and childrenâ by driving
thr-m from their homes into olaces. of
concentration and there suffering them
to die of starvation and disease.
In ISM there was $5f>.000,000 of prop
erty in the island of Cuba belonging to
the citizens of the United States. Much
of this hns been destroyed, and much
of that destruction has been by the
acts of Ssialn. The destruction of the
remainder she has been unable or un
willing to prevent. The claims on file
in the Department of State apainst
Spain for indemnity for Uiis destroyed
property are about $16,000,000 in amount.
The military officers have levied con
tributions upon American planters as
the price for the preservation of their
estates and the continuance of their
agricultural operations. In 1893 tfce com
merce of the United States with Cuba
had reached the annual sum of nearly
$100,000,000. Since that time it has been
substantially annihilated by the meth- â 
ods of Spanish military and civil mal
administration.
HOT WAR TALK
IN THE SENATE
Intervention Resolution Postponed for
a Day===Statesmen Declare Spain
Must Give Up Cuba.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, April 13.
War between two powerful nations
was the sole topic of discussion in the
Senate to-day. â¢
Such excitement, suppressed though
it was; such a feeling that the country
was on the verge of events that would
make history for all time to com 6; such
eloquence and impassioned oratory,
and such keen and brilliant repartee
have been known in the Senate -not
since the days when the country was
convulsed into the greatest war of mod
ern times.
Notwithstanding the throng in the
galleries that semi-circular chamber
was almost as silent as if it were de
serted. Conversation was conducted in
low whispers. A full quarter of an
hour before the Senate was convened
Davis, chairman of the Foreign Rela
tions Committee, entered the chamber,
and* quietly went to his seat in the cen
ter of the Republican side. He care
fully placed on his desk a bulky pack
age, which all intuitively knew to be
the fateful resolution and report from
his committee on which peace or war
might hang. The Senate chamber filled
rapidly, and when the Vice-President's
gavel fell nearly every Senator wai at
his desk.
Scarcely five minutes had elapsed af
ter the session convened before the
Vice-President recognized Davis. An
instant hush fell over the chamber. Da
vis presented to the Senate the reso
lutions and report from his commit
tee, and requested that they be read.
The report was a terrific arraignment
of Spain and her policy, yet so eager
were all to hear every word that not
the slightest demonstration occurred
throughout the reading.
Following the presentation of the re
port and after Hoar of Massachusetts
had insisted that consideration of the
resolution go over till to-morrow on a
point of order came two of the most re
markable speeches yet delivered on the
Cuban question. Foraker of Ohio and
Lodge of Massachusetts, both impas
sioned and brilliant orators, presented
different phases of the Cuban situation.
Foraker advocated the direct recogni
tion of the independence of the Cuban
republic, and with eloquence and
vehemence seldom heard in the Senate
splendidly maintained his position. A
sharp colloquy between him and Elkins
of West Virginia caused excitement.
Lodge followed with an appeal for
action in preservation of the national
honor and in wiping out the stain of
the "atrocious murder" in Havana har
bor. His words so reached the heart
that the galleries were swept with a
tremendous wave of applause.
Lindsay of Kentucky concluded the
discussion for the day with a powerful
speech, in which he advocated the
recognition of the Cubans and a con
cert of action between the insurgent
army and the United States troops in
driving the Spanish forces from the isl
and of Cuba.
The majority report and resolution
submitted by Davis, chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee, were
read, occupying about forty-five min
utes. The resolution attached to the re
port was as follows:
Whereas, The abhorrent conditions
which have existed for more than three
years in the island of Cuba, so near our
own borders, have shocked the moral
sense of the people of the United States,
have been a disgrace to Christian civ
ilization, culminating as they have, in
the destruction of a United States bat
tleship, with 266 of Its officers and crew,
while on a friendly visit to the harbor
of Havana, and cannot longer be en
dured, as has been set forth by the
President of the United States in his
message to Congress of April 11, 189S,
upon which the action of Congress was
invited; trerefore,
Resolved. First, that the people of the
island of Cuba are, and of right ought to
be, free and Independent;
Second, that it is the duty of the Gov
ernment of the United States to de
mand, and the Government of the United
States does hereby demand that the
Government of Spain at once relinquish
its authority and government in the
island of Cuba and withdraw its land
and naval forces from Cuba and Cuban
waters.
Third, that the President of the United
States be, and he hereby Is directed and
empowered to use the entire land and
naval forces of the United States and to
call into actual service of the United
States the militia of the several States
to such an extent as may be necessary to
carry these resolutions Into effect.
Senator Turpie presented the report
of the minority of the committee as
follows:
The undersigned members of the Com
mittee on Foreign Relations concur in the
report made upon the Cuban resolutions,
but we favor the immediate recognition
of the republic of Cuba as organized in
that island, as a free, independent and
sovereign power among the nations of
the world.
The minority report is signed by Sen
ator Foraker (R.) and by Senators
Morgan, Turpie, Mills and Daniels (D.).
Hoar demanded that the majority
resolution lie over under the rules unitl
to-morrow.
It soon began to look as if the con
servative Senators would delay the
Cuban resolution by debate. Senator
Davis said there was no disposition to
unduly rash the question, though it
would be pressed as rapidly as possi
ble. The speaking in itself would be
sufficient to throw the case over until
to-morrow.
The chair decided Senator Hoar's
point of order well taken.
Notwithstanding the decision of the
Vice-President, Senator Foraker pro
ceeded to discuss the Cuban question
on its general merits.
Foraker began with a reference to the
President's message, stating that the
President made certain recommenda
tions, some in a negative and some in
an affirmative form. "One of his nega
tive recommendations," Senator For
aker said, "is that notwithstanding he
finds and states to us that *he effort
of Spain to subdue and conquer the ir
surgents in Cuba has been futile, we
shall continue to deny to the people of
Cuba and also to the government es
tablished by the insurgents of Cuba a
recognition of independence."
Foraker then entered into a compari
son of the President's recommendations
and the recommendations of the com
mittee, stating that while there were
some differences of opinion as to what
should be done they were in accord as
to the main great purpose. As to the
form and character of intervention, the
committee differed with the President,
believing that the time had come when
no further negotiations were in order
and the committee had provided for ac
tion immediate ai d specific, "as th>y
believed to be in character and keeping
with the desires of the American peo
ple in respect to this matter."
In concluding Foraker said:
Does anybody imagine, Mr. President,
if we should go into Cuba and there es
tabllsh a government for which we would
be responsible that the present Emperor
of Germany would hesitate to say for a
moment to the people of America: "You
have taken by conquest revenue that
Spain had a right to pledge and did pledge
to pay the principal and interest of bonds
due to my subjects, and 1 will now look
to you." And if Germany and France
would make such a demand on the United
States the distinguished Senator from
West Virginia 1 imagine would he the
first to say, "We ought to pay up rather
than have any fighting."
Lodge of Massachusetts made a
j speech in support of the committee's
resolution. He declared that when we
were face to face with a foreign power
it was the overriding duty ot Congress
and the people and the executive to
stand absolutely together. "When the
President comes to Congress and in
vokes our aid in a controversy with a
j foreign country and asks us to give
! him power to intervene, I desire," he
said, "that the great power of war
should be given to him in that way.
I am against a declaration of war, but
I prefer giving the President the power
to intervene. lam against recogniz
ing the Government of the insurgent
republic, because the President of the
j United States in his high responsibil
ity has advised Congress strongly
against it. ' The President has noth
ing to do but to ask Mr. Palma to thÂ«
White House and the Cuban republic
i stands up erect and recognized. We
may safely trust that ~>ower to the
President. When we authorize the
President to intervene and use the
army and navy of the United States
we create a state of war. We do not
deceive ourselves at this solemn hour.
The form of words is of little moment
in a crisis like this. The great cen
tral fact concerns the people to-day.
The President has asked us to author
ize him to set up a government there
which shall be a stable government and
a 'government capable of observing in
ternational obligations.'
"What kind of government can
alone observe international rela
tions? Only an independent Govern
ment. If we intervene we do not go to
there to take Gomez by the throat and
make him stop fighting. We go there
to put Spain out of that island, for no
other way can we create a government
, capable of observing its international
obligations.."
Speaking of the Maine's loss Lodge
said: "We have evidence of Cantain
Slgsbee before our committee as to the
character of the examination which the
Spanish made â trivial, slight, careless,
done for a form to back up a story
which they had already made up their
| minds to stand by and put forth. That
has been the attitude of Spain toward
an awful disaster, happening in her
own harbor."
Kryeâ Will the Senator from Massachu
setts please add right here that the death
of our sailors and the destruction of our
ship, according to General Lee's testi
j mony, was celebrated by banquets and
champagne by the Spanish oflicers in
Cuba.
Lodge â I thank the Senator from Maine
for recalling to me the testimony of Gen
eral Lee on that point yesterday. They
rejoiced in Havana and they explained
the explosion by throwing it upon our
officers, slandering their character and
denying their words. We cannot take
money for the dead men of the Maine.
There is only one reparation. There is
only one monument to" raise over that
grave, and that is free Cuba and peace
in that Island. That is a worthy monu
ment, worthy of men who died under the
flag they loved, died, in the cold lan
guage of the law, "in line of duty." There
are mutterings among the men who wear
your uniform because they think you
nave not striven to redress the awful
slaughter of their comrades. You must
maintain the honor of the uniform un
der which they died. Surely there is no
more righteous cause than this for any

who stands and must stand at our head,

Lindsay was speaking when Hoar in
quired whether Lindsay knew of any
j person of influence who proposed to
place the Cuban people under restraint
i by our armies.
In reply Lindsay read from the Presi
i dent's message that paragraph in whi^li
he spoke of placing restraint upon both
parties to the conflict in Cuba-
Carter of Montana inquired if the
I Cuban republic should conquer and gain
| its own independence and freedom
! whether it would be responsible for the
! Cuban bonds.
Lindsay maintained that the case of
the United States and that of the Cuban,
republic differed from each other ma
terially in that the very funds derived
from the Senate bonds had been em
ployed to hold the Cubans in subjec
| tion. He thought, however, that that
I was a question in which we were not
I in the slightest way interested.
Carter then inquired whether Lind
say would have this Government shirk
the ephemeral responsibility of Cuban
! bonds by falling in behind the Gomea
! Government to escape the legitimate
consequences of war.
Lindsay said in reply that he was not
: afflicted with the delicate sensibilities
j of the Senator from Montana, and If
i the United States should, in waging a
war against Spain, find another Gov
ernment engaged in the same kind of
war, he felt that there would be na
justification in a union of forces. He
! maintained that it was the duty of the
i United States to treat with the insur
] gent Government in Cuba, so that no
man should be unjustly dealt with, and
no man's property unjustly confiscated.
Chandler announced that when tho
Foreign Relations Committee resolu
tion was called up to-morrow he would
object to the consideration of any
other business until the resolution was
disposed of.
Daniels of Virginia offered a resolu
tion requesting the President to trans
nit to the Senate all diplomatic corre-
I spondence between the United States
! and Spain respecting affairs In Cuba
and also requesting him to inform the
Senate whether this Government has
submitted to Spain the proposition of
Cuban independence, and if so, in what
form such proposition was made and
under what conditions.
Without debate the resolution waa
agreed to. Frye of Maine, a member
iof the Foreign Relations Committee,
j desired, he said, to present a resolu
i tion which had been before the com
mittee and which, to his mind, was
responsive in its nature to the desire
1 of the President as expressed in h!a
i message. The resolution, he further
! stated, represented the opinions of cer
! tain members of the Foreign Relations
; Committee. Being pressed for infor
i mation, Frye said that the resolution
! reported by tho Foreign Relations Com
mitfee had the unanimous approval of
; the committee. Four members, how
, ever, believed that the Republicans
ought to recognize the independence of
; the Cuban republic and unite in a su'p
i plementary report embodying the in
| dependence feature. When he learned
that the supplementary report was to
I be reported he reserved the right to lay
i before the Senate the resolution which
he had just offered.
The resolution was the same which
| Frye introduced several days ago and
i which was referred at that time to the
Foreign Relations Committee.

STOCKTON PRISONER
ACCUSED OF ARSON.
''Jack" Breen Charged With Having
Caused the Fanners' Union Ware

STOCKTON, April 13.-The Grand Jury
to-day found an indictment against
"Jack" Breen for arson, charging him
with having set fire to the warehouse of
the Farmers' Union in this city on the 4th
of last January, when property to the
value of J225.000 was destroyed. Breen is

rious other articles, which he sold in

part of it has been identified by the own
ers. Several suits have been brought
against the Farmers' Union by farmers
who lost grain in the fire, and the con
viction of Breen will have an Important
bearing on that litigation, for the com
plainants in the civil cases expect to
prove negligence on the part of the corpo
ration in order to recover their losses.

PERSPIRATION ON
THE BROW OF A
SUPPOSED CORPSE
People of a Washington Town
Fear a Prominent Man
. Was Buried Alive.
TACOMA. April 13.â 1t is believed by some at Montesano, in this
State, that D. C. Mitchell, a prominent logger of Satsop, was burled
alive at Montesano yesterday afternoon. Mitchell died at Satsop, a
few milos away. His body was taken to Montesano that the funeral
might be conducted under Masonic auspices. At the close of the fu
neral services the casket was opened to enable friends to view the
remains. One of the first men to pass by the coffin discovered that
Mitchell's forehead was covered with perspiration. Not wishing to
make a disturbance, he said nothing of It Just then, but stated his
opinion to others in the rear of the room. These joined him in re
questing an investigation before the casket was closed. When the glass
was removed small particles of perspiration were readily observed on
the forehead.
The report quickly spread that Mitchell was being buried alive, and
caused great excitement. A physician was summoned in haste, some
believing that the supposed dead man was in a trance and might yet
be resuscitated. Five minutes later the doctor arrived and proceeded
to make a careful examination, the lid of the coffin having been re
moved prior to his arrival. He pronounced life extinct. The so
called perspiration, he said, was very unusual, but such cases were
reported in medical works, being usually attended by the belief that the
persons exhibiting such phenomenon were not dead. All tests, how
ever, showed Mitchell to be dead, and no possible good could be at
tained by delaying the burial, as had then been proposed.
Acting on this advice the interment was proceeded with. There
are many at Montesano, however, who express the opinion that the
burial should have been delayed for a day or two. Many stories have
been related of how supposed dead people have returned to life, and
there is talk of exhuming the remains and making a more thorough
examination.
Mr. Mitchell's death was supposed to have been caused by heart
disease, as he suddenly became unconscious while sitting at his din
ner-table on Sunday afternoon, and dropped to the floor.

Shipping Corn From Nebraska.
WOODLAND, April 13.-The strong
probability of short hay and grain crops
has Induced some of the farmers and
stock dealers of Yolo County to try the
experiment of shipping corn from Ne
braska, Kansas and Maine. Several ship
ments have already been received and
others will follow. The freight charges
are rather high, but if a number of pur
chasers combine and order a train load
at one time a reduction of $30 or $40 a car
can probably be obtained* Stock hogs are
selling very cheap, and speculators are
buying th^m -with the expectation of
fattening them on corn.

Extensive Thefts of Gold From

Company.
Three or the Culprits Are Arrested
â nd Warrants Are Out for
Others.
Bpeclal Dispatch to The Call.
RANDSBURG, April 13.â George Cal
ladine, night shift boss, and Oliver Le
fevre and wife were arrested this morn
ing. The men are charged with having
stolen ore from the Yellow Aster mines
and the woman is accused of having
received the ore. Several warrants are
still unserved.
Some time ago John W. Lambed, the
i citizen's committee's night watchman,
j noticed several women frequently sell
: ing gold dust at local stores. Knowing
â  their husbands were workingmen he
I became suspicious, and after careful
I investioation, learned that the store-
I keepers purchased from the womn
I dust to the value of $1500 monthly.
i Lambert was not long in locating the
I women and soon learned that many
! men were implicated. While he was at
i work on the case one of the women be
j came alarmed and sent for him.
"I am sick of the whole business,"
j she said.
Then she confessed all. A watch was
put on several houses, but the princi
pals had already fled, leaving the wo
men to care for themselves. Telegrams
have been sent in all directions in the
hope of capturing them.
In searching one house Officer Lam
bert noticed a large oatmeal sack con
taining a lot of potatoes and onions. He
gave it a kick and found that it con
tained rocks also. The vegetables on
top were removed and he found over
$100 in free milling ore tied in a ban
dana handkerchief and old rags, while
a small salt sack and a small paper
bag contained rock that would easily
sell for $1000.
John Sin leton, superintendent of the
Yellow Aster Mining Company, said
his company had been losing ore. The
amount he could not give, for the rea
son that the ore had been carried away
in buckets and s n the pockets of the
thieves. It was easily worth $1 a pound.
Last summer fifteen sacks of ore, val
ued at $100 a sack, were taken from a
pile of sacked ore n:ar the company's
office.
Calladine was paid extra to look out
for men carrying off any of the com
pany's ore or property. He will have
his examination on Monday.

WILETT WILL
GO TO FOLSOM
JLife Imprisonment the
Baden Murderer's
Punishment
Sentence Pronounced After the
Hearing of Testimony at
Redwood City.
Officials Repeat the Confession Made
to Them by the Accused
Man.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDWOOD CITY, April 13. -Judge
George H. Buck this morning heard
; testimony in the case of James Wilett
one of the three men implicated in the
killing of C. A. Andrews at the Grand
Hotel in Baden on the 17th day of last
November. An information was filed
| against him in the Superior Court,
charging him with murder, and on
Monday he pleaded "guilty." The court
thereupon set to-day as the time for
hearing testimony and passing sen
tence.
Sheriff J. H. Mansfield and District
Attorney H. W. Walker testified to
statements and admissions made by de
fendant to them. On Saturday last the
District Attorney had an interview
with Wilett in the County Jail and
I at that time the full particulars of the
attempted robbery, which resulted in
murder, were told by Wilett.
About ten days prior to the 17th of
November the three men â Wilett, Ray
mond and Winters â planned to rob the
Grand Hotel at Baden, run by Mr. Fer
riter. About a week before the mur
: der Raymond and Winters went to Ba
i den to inspect the premises and learn
I the pay day of the packing works, a
! great many employes of which were
i boarding at Ferriter's.
On the afternoon of the 17th the three
j men took the county road leading to
I Baden and stopped at the old Baden
! station about a mile from the Grand
j Hotel. There they separated and Win
ters went directly into the town. Ray
mond and Wilett arrived in town con
siderably later. The three met ac
cording to appointment and went to
; the hotel.
Wilett says Raymond was the man
who did all the shooting, who fired the
shots that killed Andrews. He was
present in the hotel at the time. After
the crime he made his escape to a milk
ranch near Baden and finally worked
his way to Arizona, where he was cap
tured by the officers.
In giving his testimony the District
Attorney repeatedly turned to the pris
oner and asked him if what he was
saying was true, and always got an
affirmative answer.
The court found that the defendant
was guilty of murder in the first de
gree, but under the circumstances said
he would not impose the extreme pen
alty of the law. He pronounced the
life sentence. As the defendant had
a preference and desired to be con
fined in Folsom Prison, the court made
the order accordingly.
CANNOT ENFORCE
THE LIQUOR LAWS.
Gage Reports on the Impossibility of
Federal Officers in Alaska to Cope
With Public Sentiment.
WASHINGTON, April 13.â Responding
to a resolution of Inquiry in regard to the
enforcement of t-e liquor law In Alaska
Secretary Gage sent a statement to the
Senate, in wnich he says that, notwith
standing the efforts of the department, it
is a fact that the law is openly violated.
It has, he says, been' reported to the de
partment that fo-ty saloons do business
in Juneau, a town of less than 4000 in
habitants, while in Sitka. which contains
less than 1000 white inhabitants, there are
twelve saloons.
"The universal public sentiment in the
Territory," says tne Secretary, "is bit
terly opposed to the enforcement of the
liquor law, and ue efforts of the officers
are met with intimidation, threats, vio
lence and attempts at bribery."
He says an agent of the department who
reported this condition was indicted, xhe
Secretary says:
"The statement has been made repeat
edly by judicial officers of the Territory
that no Grand jury in Alaska would in
dict any person arrested for violating the
liquor law."
The report closes with the stntem nt
that it is impossible to enforce the prÂ«w
ent law against the existing public senti
ment.
Buying Oregon Grain.
STOCKTON, April 13.â The scarcity

closed. The grain will be snipped here I
by steamer and river boat via San
Francisco and the amount will keep
the mills busy for many v.eeks.

Entire Day.
Bpeclal Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, Or., April 13.â 1n the
Republican Congressional convention,
for the Second District of Oregon, at
Astoria this evening, Malcome A.
Moody of The Dalles was nominated by
acclamation for Congressman. This
action was preceded by a settlement of
the contest between the delegations
from Multnomah County and the ad
mission of the regular delegation. The
contest began at 10 o'clock this morn
ing, the very moment of opening, and
continued, with several recesses, until
7:30 this evening.
In calling the convention to order
Chairman Carey did what he could to
favor the supporters of Mitchell and
Ellis. By his action he split the con
vention in two and for several hours
two Republican conventions for the
Second* District were in session. Car
ey's convention consisted of about thir
ty members from the co-untry and the
sixty Mitchell delegates from Multno
mah. The regular convention was
made up of about fifty country dele
gates and the sixty regular delegates
from Multnomah. The first was nom
inally in session from 10 to 1, and ad
journed until Friday morning' at 10.
The second, immediately after tempo
rary organization, appointed a commit
tee on credentials and took a recess un
til 2 o'clock.
C. "VV. Fulton of Astoria undertook
and successfully carried out a plan to
harmonize the party in this district and
after numerous conferences brought the
Mitchell faction into the regular con
vention. There, shortly after 7 o'clock,
all the delegates outside of Multnomah
County decided by a vote of 48 to 32
that a compromise was inadvisable and
subsequently by a vote of 47 to 33 ad
mitted the regular Republicans to seats
in the convention. It was now evident
that Ellis would have no chance for the
nomination against Moody so his name
was not presented to the convention
and Moody was nominated by acclama
tion.
At a caucus of all the del 'gates out
side of Multnomah at the convention
hall to-nigrht it was Informally declared
that the election for temporary chair
man to-morrow shall be by ballot and
that balloting shall not begin u/itil
there shall have been ample time for
nominations. M. L. Chamberlin of
Marion presided and J. B. Eddy of
Douglas wa elected secretary.
The impression prevails that the
Multnomah case will not be reopened
in the State convention, t ugh this is
by no means certain. The temper of the
delegates may undergo a change be
tween now and morning. However it
is believed that there 1b a majority in
the First District as well as in the
Second in f .vor of seating the regular
delegation from Multnomah. The pre
vailing temper of the convention seems
to be in favor of taking decisive action
now and thus ending the practice "of
sending double delegations from Mult
nomah.

HAS FLED FROM THE CITY.
The Bonds of Sidney Kellett, the No
torious Young Scamp, Declared
Forfeited.
Sidney Kellett having failed to appear
in Judge Low's court yesterday the judgd
declared 'his bonds forfeited and issued
a bench warrant for his arrest. The Su
perior Court had affirmed the judgment
on appeal.
Sidney was arrested some months ago
on charges of carrying a concealed weap
on and having burglars' tools in his posÂ«
session. He was convicted on both
charges and sentenced to six months in
the County Jail on each. He appealed,
and hi 3 bonds were fixed at $500 on each
charge. He was released on bonds ac
cepted by Judge Campbell, which led to
the fight between Campbell and Low as
to whether a judge other than the com
mitting magistrate had the right to ac
cept bonds on appeal, and Campbell won
before Judge Cook. Then the matter was
taken to the Supreme Court to test thq
constitutionality of Police Court 4, but
the case was dropped, as Low recogniied
Campbell's order of discharge.
Sidney has now fled from the city anq
left his bondsmen to face the music. They
are George P. O'Neill and Mark Senna,
and it is a question with Bond Inspector
Newman whether they are competent ta
stand the amount of $500 each.
Sidney is a bad young man. He was
the promoter of the scheme to assault
and rob o-ld man Isadore Goulet on Gold-,
en Gate avenue, and had the extra
ordinary good fortune to escape punish*
ment in the Superior Court.
A Rabbi Prays for Peace.
Rabbi Isidore Meyers offered a fervent
prayer during services yesterday morn
ing at the Bush-Btreet synagogue, which
brought tears to the eyes of many of hla
auditors. The tenor of his pathetic words
was for peace and good will and in dis
couragement of war to be settled by
sword or gunpowder. He hoped that
Congress would follow the wise course of
the President, in whom the public had
bo much trust and confidence. At the
end of his eloquent plea many in the
large assemblage congratulated the rabbi.
Dr. Meyers dllivered a powerful sermon
before a very large congregation on
"Israel's Answer to Jews and Gentiles."

The British bark "Willscott had a second narrow escape from total de
struction while on her maiden voyage. She was launched in 1896 and
eighteen months ago left England for Capetown. From there she went to
Philadelphia in ballast and thence to Hiogo, Japan, with a cargo of oil.
She was caught in a squall and nearly capsized off the coast of Australia.
THE BARK
WILLSCOTT
DISMASTED
Caught in a Hurricane After
Leaving Japan and Very
Nearly Wrecked.
This Is Her Maiden Voyage, but it Is
the Second Time That She
Has Narrowly Escaped
Foundering.
The British bark Willscott reached port
In distress yesterday, after one of the
most remarkable voyages on record.
With the scantiest kind of a jury rig she
I covered over 3500 miles in sixty days and
now lies off Black Point, looking more
like a dismantled hulk than anything else.
The Willscott is on her maiden voyage,
having left England for Cape Town about
eighteen months ago. From South Africa
she went to Philadelphia in ballast, and
when off the coast of Tasmania, during
the voyage from Philadelphia to Hiogo,
Japan, with a cargo of oil she nearly cap-
sized. During a storm a heavy squall
struck and threw her on her beam ends..
Just when everybody was expecting her
to go down, the squall passed and she
gradually righted herself. After discharg
ing at Hiogo the Willscott started for
Victoria, B. C, in ballast, and when ten
days out became nearly a total wreck.
"We left Hiogo on February 3 last,"
said First Mate Disney yesterday. "Ter.
â¢ days later we caught it. The wind
was from the NNE., and was gradually
working Itself up Into a hurricane. There
was i tremendous cross sea, and the ship
was rolling gunwales under. Everything
was snujrgcd down and the vessel was
doing fairly well under the fore and main
lower topsails and â  the foretopmast and
mizzen staysails. . The wind blew harder
and harder and the ship rolled more and
more until at 3:15 p. m. the foretopmast
buckled just below the cheeks of the
mast and all the spars and gear fell over
board to starboard with the exception of
the foreyard and lower topsallyard,
which fell on the forecastle head and
eventually rolled overboard. "
"Before anything could be done with
the wreckage the main lowermast buckled
lust below the cheeks of the mast, and a
few seconds later, buckled again about six
feet for the deck. All hands were at once
set to work cutting away and clearing the
wreckage and In getting rid of the spars
that were doing their best to batter a hole
In our starboard side. The thumping was
so great that it started the butt straps
between the third and fourth sister keel
sons and made the hull leak slightly
"At 6 a, m. on February- 14 -the spanker
boom, gaff and mizzen' topmast carried
away, and there we lay like a log in the
water. : At this time the storm was at its
height and we expected every moment to
be our last.
"When the gale had subsided a little
the captain; ordered an examination of
our damages. We found that the bow
sprit was still In place, but badly shaken
the leads for the stays and the bobstay
band carried away, the forecastle head
, rails/lighthouses, bell, ventilators, life
rail and ladders had been carried â  away*
while the covering board and deck * was
. badly damaged. ,
A "The forward capstan was smashed,
r4r 4 sailors' forecastle damaged, two gigs
. swept overboard, skids and chocks
smashed. main fife-rail, starboard lite
boat, davits, skids, stanchions, bridge and
compass badly damaged. The mizzen
lowermast was very badly shaken, poop
rail," skylight, charthouse, ladders and
rails badly broken and damaged. Port
compass smashed and * poop - deck â¢ and '
mala deck badly, cut up.
I "Six chain plates of the main rigging
I were broken, the pin rail in the wake of
â  the rigging was carried away and forty
| eight feet of the starboard bulwarks were
i smashed. Two chain plates of the fore
, rigging were broken, the chain rail in the
wake of the rigging carried away and
sixty-six feet of the bulwarks was badly
damaged. One of the stanchions of the
starboard bulwarks was bent and the
cement in the starboard scuppers was
damaged.
"Tuesday, February 15, at 10:30 a. m. we
sighted a full-rigged ship (the British
; ship Cpnway, bound for Puget Sound).
: \\ c hoisted our numbers and flew signals
i of distress as well as possible, but no
notice was talten of us in our predica
ment.
"The following day we got some sail
on the wreck, but on February 17 the
storm came up again and not only blew
: away the mizzen staysail but split the
spanker badly. When the storm mod
erated again we got two headstays to the
stump ot the foremast and set "our jibs,
lebruary 23 we got a spar across the
foremast and set a squaresail and four
days later another storm came up and
mew away our mizzen staysail again.
| During that gale one of the men named
â  bullivan was thrown into the scuppers
and hurt his back. He is now on the
sick list From that time on we had
plenty of gales, but luckily they all blew
in the direction of San Francisco, so that
in spite of our crippled condition there
was rarely a day that we did not make
from sixty-five to seventy knots.
"Saturday last. In latitude 38.44 north,
longitude 127.40 west, we sightc-d what we
took to be a disabled steamer, and if it
was not a steamer it must have been
some dismasted craft like ourselves. We
ran down toward her. but a rain squall
hid her from sight for a short time. Cap
tain Mitchell had his signals all ready to
set, but when the squall had passed there
was not a trace of the vessel to be seen.
We were off Point Reyes nearly all day
Tuesday and flew slgna'ls, but the man on
the lookout did not see us. Eventually,
however, we were picked up by the tug
Reliance and brought into port."
It will cost a small fortune to repair
the Willscott. and it will be several
months before ehe will be ready to go to
sea again. The vessel was fully insured,
so the loss will fall on the underwriters.
She is 19S1 tons burden and was built at
Glasgow In 1896. She Is owned by Hickie,
Borman & Co. of London.
Ocean View Bepublican Club.
A large delegation of Ocean View Re
publicans assembled at Fisher's Hall on

THE ft'A-W FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 14, 1898.
From Japan she started for Victoria, B. C, in ballast, and when ten days
out was dismasted in a hurricane. Luckily she had nothing but favorable
gales after that and she made the run to San Francisco under a jury rig
in sixty days. She looked like a wreck yesterday morning when she came
to an anchor off Black Point.
FOREST QUEEN
STILL MISSING
The Bark Is Probably
Disabled and Off the '
Usual Course.
Captain Nelson Has Asked the
Collector to Send Out a
Cutter.
F. Giovanni, a TÂ«rra-Cotta Worker,
Jumps Overboard From thÂ©
Bay City.
There Is still no word from the bark
Forest Queen and the owners are getting
very anxious about her. Captain Nelson
thinks she Is dismasted and drifting
about outside, and seafaring men are of
the opinion that It might have been the
lumber vessel which Captain Mitchell of
the Willscott sighted last Saturday. Cap
tain Nelson called upon the Collector of
the Port yesterday and asked that one
of the revenue cutters be sent out to look
for the overdue bark. If she Is out of the
run of the coasters and is dismasted she
may drift around for months before be
ing picked up. If, therefore, a cutter can
be spared it Is the duty of the Collector
to send one out at once.
The steamer Morgan City discharged
the little steam launch Yale, which she
brought from New York on her deck,
yesterday. She was built for an 18 knot
flyer, but cannot do better than 14 knots.
S-e was taken to Belvedere during the
afternoon and will remain there until
the Johnson-Locke Mercantile Company
finds something for her to do on the
Yukon.
F. Giovanni, who Is employed In the
terra cotta works In Alameda, tried to
commit suicide yesterday. He jumped
overboard from the steamer Bay City on
the 7 a. m. trip and was only rescued
with difficulty, as he was determined to
drown. At the Harbor Receiving Hospital
he said he was dirty and jumped over
board to have a wash. As he showed
symptoms of Insanity the doctors held
him for further examination.
Spear street wharf began sfnking yes
terday and the freight stored on it had
to be removed in a hurry. The wharf
was condemned by Chief Engineer
Holmes of the Harbor Commission
over two months ago. and the
work of repairing it cannot begin until
the injunction suit now pending is de
cided. The rush of shipping compelled
the chief wharfinger to use the wharf
however, but only a certain amount of
freight was allowed on it at a time. Even
that little was too much, however, and
the wharf settled six inches under It in
an hour.
The quarters for the Tiburon and Sau
salito ferries are now ready In the new
depot, and the old sheds that have done
duty for offices for so long are to be
torn down and removed. Inside of a few
weeks the new Union Depot will be oc
cupied for the first time.
On account of repairs to the Folsom
street wharf the steamship Morgan City
has been transferred to Jackson street
wharf. She will leave on the lGth inst
for Dyea, Skaguay and Juneau.
Uncle Sam now wants men and wants
them In a hurry. At the naval rendez
vous they are enlisting machinists
firemen, ordinary seamen and landsmen'
There are plenty of applications, and two
recruiting officers and two doctors are
kept busy all day examining the appli
cants.
Japanese Immigrants Examined.
TV. M. Rice, United States Immigration
Commissioner at Victoria, B. C, arrived
last Tuesday evening for the purpose of
examining the methods pursued by United
States Commissioner North of this city
in passing upon the right of a certain
class of immigrants to land here. Immi
gration Commissioner Rodgers of Phila
delphia is here fir the same purpose, his
mission hither being a result of the com
plaint of the Japanese Minister at Wash
ington that Commissioner North did not
snow Japanese immigrants fair play and
discriminated against them while favor
ing other nationalities.
The gent!' men spent yesterday after
noon in attending the examination of Jap
anese immigrants on hoard of the Peru
and familiarizing themselves with the
methods of the special board of inquiry.
FEMALE THIEF
IN BLACK
Miss Muller Cleverly Re
lieved of Her Purse
and "Watch.
Discovered the Thief, but Al
lowed Her to Make
an Escape.
The Bold Operations of a Mysterious
Female In thÂ« Western
Addition.
The mysterious woman In black, as
the police have designated her, is again
at work in the Western Addition. Last
Monday afternoon she entered the resi
dence of Miss Muller, a dressmaker, at
2404 Sutter street, and stole a purse con
taining some money and a gold watch.
Miss Muller had left the house for a
few minutes and on her return she dis
covered the mysterious visitor.
After apologizing for having entered
the house during the absence of the
occupant, the woman burglar said she
was anxious to have a waist made pre
paratory to spending a short vacation
at Santa Cruz. Not suspecting any
thing wrong Miss Muller asked her
what kind of a waist she desired to
have made. Taking out her watch and
noting the time the mysterious visitor,
after saying that she had an important
engagement, promised to return yester
day morning.
Shortly after she had left Miss Muller
discovered that her purse and watch
were missing. Convinced that the wo
man had taken It she at once notified
the policeman on the beat. He made a
search for the thief but was unable to
get a trace of her.
Last night Miss Muller visited police
headquarters and gave a description of
the watch. She described the woman
as being of medium height and dressed
in black. She said the woman bore
evidence of refinement and spoke with a
slight foreign accent.
During the past several months the
same woman has been operating in the
Western Addition, and notwithstanding
the efforts of the police she has suc
cessfully managed to elude arrest. Im
mediately after the case was reported
to Chief Lees he detailed Detectives
Bee and Harper to visit the various
pawnshops in the hope that the woman
might have sold the stolen time-piece.

The San Francisco Athletic Club will
give its next entertainment on the even
ing of May 3. As the directors have an
nounced that the first prize will be a

Rejoin His Regiment
The First United States Infantry sta
tioned at the Presidio is ready to march
and waiting to receive further orders.
There is nothing to do now but wait.
Every company of the regiment is pre
pared to move at the word of command.
The wagons are ready and the com
pany property, tents, kits and so on,
can be loaded on the teams at once and
taken to the boat or railroad station.
Every dispatch from Washington,
Madrid and Havana is carefully read
by the soldiers. Enlisted men and of
ficers have about dismissed all thought
of a peaceful adjustmpnt of the dif
ferences between the United States and
Spain. The army people do not un
derrate the fighting qualities of the
Spanish. The fact is understood that
Spain is in position to put up a pretty
strong oattle on the sea and do some
effective fighting on land. The ability
of the United States to end Spanish
sway in Cuba is not doubted in the
least. The opinion Is expressed by
some of the enlisted men that it would
not be good management to send Amer
ican soldiers and horses to Cuba until
next fall. The summer climate on the
island would kill six soldiers where
Spanish bullets would kill one.
The order issued by Colonel Miles,
the commanding officer of the Presidio,
directing that no officer shall leave the
post without special permission from
headquarters is still in force.
The following was issued yesterday:
Presidio of San Francisco, California,

Captain Frank de L. Carrington,
commanding Company X, First Infan
try, Presidio, who has been absent from
his regiment since September 30, 1895,
on duty with the National Guard of
California, was asked yesterday if he
expected to accompany his regiment
East in case orders were received from
the War Department directing it to
move. In reply Captain Carrington
stated that he daily expects telegraphic
orders from Washington relieving him
from duty with the California National
Guard and assigning him to duty with
his regiment. In case of war his com
pany, which is a skeleton company, will
be recruited to its full limit as pre
scribed by law.
First Lieutenant Frank Greene, Sig
nal Corps, United States army, chief
signal officer department of California,
is now undergoing an examination for
promotion, before a board of officers
convened at the Presidio, of which Col
onel Marcus P. Miller, Third Artillery,
is president. Lieutenant Greene has
charge of connecting electrically the
posts in San Francisco harbor, con
tracts for which work have already
been awarded.
Lieutenant Greene Is also giving in
struction to a class of thirty enlisted
men at the Presidio, from the infantry
and cavalry arm, for the purpose of
making them familiar with the code of
signals adopted by the United States
army.
The class is at present engaged In
sending and receiving messages be
tween the Presidio and Fort Point, but
shortly signal stations will be tempor
arily established at Fort Baker, Mount
Tamalpais, Alcatraz and Angel
islands, for the transmission and re
ceipt of messages. In case of war the
most proficient of the class will be
transferred to the Signal Corps.
Assistant Secretary Howell of the
Treasury Department has notified Col
lector Jackson of the adoption of a
resolution by Congress requiring the
admission free of duty of all guns, am
munition and other naval and military
supplies as may be purchased abroad
by the Government for the national de
fense prior to January 1, 1899.
THE LOBJNG CLUB CONCERT.
Odd Fellows' Hall Filled Last Even-
ing With a Large Audience
of Music Lovers.
The third concert of the Lorlng Club's
twenty-first season drew a large audience
of music lovers to Odd Fellows' Hall last
evening, where they were well rewarded
by hearing an excellent programme ren
dered. It Included ten selections of a clas
sical nature that were interpreted with
a true musical spirit under the able di
rection of D. P. Hughes. The soloists of
the evening were John Marquardt, violin
ist, and Arthur Weiss, violoncello. Mrs.
Carmichael Carr was the accompanist.
The singing of the chorus was excellent
and showed the results of careful train
ing and work and was warmly received
by the audience. The trio for the piano,
violin and violoncello evoked great ap
plause, while the numbers of Messrs.
Marquardt and Weiss were thoroughly
.appreciated, as was shown by the warmth
of the reception accorded these two
artists.
Coal Dealers to Be Arraigned.
The members of the Coal Dealers' As
sociation who have been indicted by the

he was discovered. Dr. Wilson, who
chanced to be passing at the time, took
the little fellow in-o his buggy and drove
at once to the San Francisco Polyclinio
at 404 Ellis street, where he made a hasty
examination, and, finding the boy baaiy
injured, at once took him to his home,
where the family physicians, the Drs.
Sullivan, were called in.
It was found that the boy's leg was
broken near the ankle, his back badly con
tused, and there was an ugly cut about
two inches long on his head. It was
reared at first that the spine was injured,
but the doctors now think there is noth
ing more serious than a few bad bruises
on the back.
Free Public Market.
The special committee of the Produ

tion held a meeting yesterday, at which
there were present E. F. Adams. John
Swett of Martinez, W. P. Cragin of San

Reports were received from these and
discussed at length. It was decided to
leave the data furnished by the three
committees in the hands of the chair
man, who will later on present the whola

It is the desire of the body to meet with
a body of commission men and arranga

WSI. H. SAWYER of Berdell Z,

â  as follows: Â£Â£
"I cannot refrain from saying that I con- y-

of the greatest Inventions on earth, for It , iS

THjE HOT WOVE AND ITS EFFECTS.
ACCORDING to reports that come to us from
the interior of the State the effects of the hot
wave have been as beneficial to some industries
as injurious to others. To the orchards it has brought
profit, but to the grain and grass growers it ha* in
flicted loss. Thus we may take an optimistic view of
the situation and cite the wave as another evidence
that whatever weather comes some of our diverse in
terests are benefited, or we may complain with the
pessimists that no matter what comes somebody gets
hurt.
Considered from a strictly commercial point of
view, without reference to particular industries and
without regard to either optimism or pessimism, the
general result of the hot weather seems to have in
creased the value of the crops of the State. All the
fruit districts report that prospects are now much
brighter than they were. The orchardists are more
hopeful than they have been for months past, and it
is believed by most of them that if a fair amount of
rain falls before the spring is over the result will be
a fruit crop that will be fully equal 'to the yield of
average years.
This season has been so exceptional in every re
spect that it is not easy to predict the future. We
had one of the coldest and dryest winters on record,
and now the spring brings to us ihe hottest weather
in April that we have known for ten years. It is clear
that we are hardly likely to have average conditions
during the rest of a season which has thus far run its
course in such an unprecedented way, but whether
the variation from the average will be on the Â»ide-of
more rain than usual or less is a question on which a
prediction will be ventured only by those who are
in the habit of basing their weather prophecies on the
way the hedgehog feeds and the ram faces when the
wind blows.
The greater evil of the year has fallen upon the
cattlemen, -but it is possible that out of this some
good may come. It has directed public attention to
the wrong done by our quarantine laws and has
aroused efforts to provide a remedy. These efforts
*re not likely to be wholly in vain, and perhaps out
i)f the distress of the dry season there may come a
sufficient mass of argument to induce our law-makers
to take some action that will relieve California cattle
of the bad name that rests upon them and open a
way for the better conditions in the future.
BETTER PROSPECTS FOR WINE MEN.
IZJ ROM every point of view the prospects of wine
makers and wine-dealers in California have been
* brightened by the recent agreement on the part
of the contending associations to seek a friendly and
mutually beneficial settlement of their differences
through the assistance of the State Board of Trade.
So many futile efforts at attaining a satisfactory basis
of agreement between the makers and the dealers
have been made in the past that it is evident some
;>utside mediation will be necessary to bring about
i harmonious arrangement, and no body of men better
fitted for that service could be found than the one
selected.
The importance of the wine interest of the State
is well known. It is one of the most valuable depart
ments of our rural industry, and yet for some years
past it has not been so remunerative to the producers
as it should have been. The income derived from it
by the community as a whole has been large, but the
men engaged in it have in too many instances hardly
received adequate wages for their labor, much less
interest on their investments. This condition of af
fairs led long ago to serious attempts at the adoption
Df some measures that would make the industry more
profitable, but up to this time radical differences be
.ween the dealers and the makers have prevented the
iccomplishment of the cesired object.
The new movement promises well. Both associa
tions have cordially agreed to co-operate with the
committee appointed by the State Board of Trade
in seeking an adjustment of the points in controversy.
It is estimated that upward of 30.000.000 gallons of
wine will be produced in the State this year, and the
amount of money involved is therefore considerable.
Wine-making is one of the industries of California
tvhich have the largest possibilities of expansion.
The American people are slowly but surely learning
the benefits of using wholesome table wines, and the
home market is widening. Moreover, the European
demand for our wine is growing. The area of the
State fitted for cultivation of wine grapes is enor
mous. If, therefore, we can fix the industry on a
paying basis and harmonize the two branches of it
so that co-operative work will be possible, the out
look of the industry will be as bright as that of any
in the State.
Another murderer has pleaded guilty. He deserves
jÂ» Â«ou of thanks and a speedy hanging.
THE MINORITY MARPLOTS.
THE opposition in Congress has united on this
joint resolution and desires the United States
to go to the world on it:
"Resolved, by the Senate and House of Represen
| tatives of the United States, in Congress assembled:
"Section I. The United States Government hereby
recognizes the independence of the republic of Cuba.
"Section 2. That moved thereto by many consider
! ations of humanity, of interest and of provocation,
among which are the deliberate mooring of our
battle-ship Maine over a submarine mine and its de
struction in the harbor of Havana, the President of
the United States be, and hereby is, directed to em
ploy immediately the land and naval forces of the
United States in aiding the republic to maintain the
independence hereby recognized.
"Section 3. The President of the United States is
hereby authorized and directed to extend immediate
relief to the starving people of Cuba, and for this pur
pose the sum of $1,000,000 is hereby appropriated."
This Government cannot recognize a thing unless
it exists. Therefore the resolution presupposes the
actual existence of Cuban independence, in the form
of a republic, and the existence therÂ« of a govern
ment capable of fulfilling international obligations
and of protecting person and property within its
jurisdiction.
Next the resolution introduces an offensive and
defensive alliance with this independent government
and bind* the United States in such alliance to aid
it with ships and armies in maintaining its indepen
dence. Then $1,000,000 is appropriated out of the
United States treasury to relieve the starving people,
who, according to the first section of the resolution,
have achieved independence and erected a republic.
We are to send an army to "aid" this independent
nation; our soldiers are to fight under the orders
of its military commanders, and at the same time our
taxpayers are to feed and clothe the starving citizens
of this free and independent republic!
Again we are "provoked" to do this because the
Maine exploded in a harbor which must belong to
this independent nation, if it have the jurisdiction
presupposed in the preamble.
The international lawyers and publicists of the op
position who propose that the Government of the
United States shall play second fiddle to the Junta,
and that General Miles shall take his orders from
General Gomez, do not explain the connection be
tween the Maine explosion and Cuban indepen
dence, though the verbiage of the resolution infers
that the two events are connected and that Cuban
independence became a fact internationally recogniz
able when the ship blew up. The pseudo patriots
who daily inform the world that the President is a
traitor should follow up their plan of fighting for
and feeding an independent republic which, if inde
pendent, would be able to do its own fighting and
feeding, by a proposition to annex the United States
to the republic of Cuba and exchange President Mc-
Kinley for whoever happens to be at this moment
President of that island.
Heretofore this country and all countries that are
civilized have abided by the rule that a revolting
people are independent only when able to maintain
themselves without aid. That is what independence
means. No matter how sick, sore and starved they
become while fighting for independence, they must
achieve the thing itself and be able to maintain it.
We may declare war against Spain for the Maine
explosion and may strike her where she is weak, in
Cuba, and the world will justify us. As a result Cuba
may become independent, but if she were so now
there would be no Spanish power there for us to
strike.
The resolution is worthy of the demagogues who
are attacking their own Government. It is ridicu
lously self-contradictory and would make the country
a laughing stock.
THE VALLEY F^OAD.
f~* ONTRACTS let for the construction of a sec
( tion of the Valley Road westward from Stock-
ton to Point Richmond serve to remind the
people of the progress that is being made toward
completing the great enterprise which is to break
down the monopoly of transportation between San
Francisco and the San Joaquin, and which in all
likelihood will eventually break down the trans
continental m6nopoly as well.
This enterprise is not only the greatest now under
way in California, but it is one of the most important
ever carried out in the history of the State. The fact
that it was undertaken during a period of depression
was a striking proof of the public-spirited energy of
Californian capitalists, and the rapidity with which
it hat been pushed forward affords unmistakable
evidence of their industrial vigor. It is, therefore,
gratifying to note that the enterprise was not a mere
temporary Â«purt to supply an investment for unem
ployed capital, but the beginning of a patient and
persistent work of vast magnitude which is to go on
until the cinch of the railway monopoly between San
Francisco and the interior of the State \ completely
broken and an avenue opened for better trade and
freer trade in every direction.
At both ends of the line the work goes steadily for
ward. At the western end the contracts just let pro
vide for the completion of two sections of track on
either side of the Franklyn tunnel, while at the south
ern end the work of constructing the steel bridge
over Kern River is going on, and grading on the
other side has commenced, while preparations are
being made for constructing the link from Visalia
to Joaquina.
The activity displayed In the work and extension of
the Valley Road ought to have the effect of arousing
the Southern Pacific Company to the task of com
pleting the gap in the coast line. The company ob
tained valuable grants of rights of way along the
route of the proposed coast extension upon the un
derstanding that the road would be immediately con
structed. Years have passed and the company has
not fulfilled its agreement. The work along the
route is hardly more than an excuse for work.
The Valley Road constructs miles of tracks while
the Southern Pacific sends promises to the people
from whom it obtained rights of way that it will be
gin construction in earnest next spring o- next fall, or
next year. The contrast is striking, and clearly re
veals to the people the difference between a railroad
designed for the benefit of California and one oper
ated solely for the purpose of taxing traffic all it will
bear.
When Mark Twain gets ready to write another ac
count of a riotous legislative body he need not go
from his native land. And it becomes Americans to
laugh very moderately at the uproars of the French
and Germans when engaged in jaw-fighting for the
good of their respective countries.
There may be smaller men than those who have
carried partisanship into consideration of the war
issue. If so, however, they have failed of getting
.on record.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 14, 1898.
McINTOSM AND HAYMOND.
H^ VIDENCE of a moral awakening among mem
bers of the bar in this city is furnished by the
action of the San Francisco Bar Association on
Tuesday evening. For some time past a committee
of that organization has been engaged in an investi
gation of the conduct of two attorneys, Benjamin
Mclntosh and Edward B. Haymond, with a view of
presenting them to the Supreme Court for disbar
ment. The pair were charged with offering to sell
the confession of Albert Hoff to the newspapersâ
a proceeding highly unprofessional and violative of
their oaths as attorneysâ and they were convicted of
the offense by Superior Judge Cook. Failing to ap
pear before the Bar Association and defend them
selves, they were on Tuesday evening found guilty of
unprofessional conduct and disbarment proceedings
ordered instituted against them.
It is to be hoped that the members of the commit
tee entrusted with the duty of prosecuting these
young men will not now fall a victim to what is
known in the classics of the coast as "cold feet." In
plainer language, it is to be hoped they will do their
duty. It is evident that neither Mclntosh nor Hay
mond is fit to practice law. Attorneys who, as coun
sel for a man charged with murder, will attempt to
sell his confidential utterances to the press, have no
conception of their duty either to their clients or
the sovereign who licenses them to practice law, the
State. Indeed, such attorneys are a disgrace to an
honorable profession, and the courts of which they
are officers ought to be ashamed of them.
It is to be hoped also that the Bar Association will
not stop at Mclntosh and Haymond. Within the past
month three other attorneys have been arrested in
this city for infringing the Penal Code. Nobody has
suggested that they be disbarred, because their prac
tice is mainly confined to the police courts. We do
not think, however, that this should protect them. It
is true that the discipline of the police courts is less
severe than that of the courts of record, but a rascal
may do as much damage in one as in the other. The
Bar Association ought to look after the purity of the
entire legal profession, and whenever it discovers a
scoundrelly lawyer who uses his license to defraud
his clients or betray the public it should reduce his
sphere of operations instantly. It is only by prompt
action in cases like those of Mclntosh and Haymond
that an important branch of the judicial system can
be maintained on a plane of decency and respecta
bility.
Manr committees of the San Frandsco Bar Asso
ciation appointed Hke this one to institute disbar
ment proceedings have been overtaken by congealed
extremities. It is on record also that the Supreme
Court occasionally gets "cold feet" when confronted
with an influential legal scalawag. It is unnecessary
to go into particulars on this point Suffice it to say
that the public will watch the cases of Mclntosh and
Haymond with interest. If these attorneys have a
"pull" it will soon be placed in evidence.
PfICIRC COAST FISHERIES.
NOTES on the fisheries of the Pacific Coast in
i 895, by William A. Wilcox, which have just
been published by the United States Fish Com
mission, serve the double purpose of showing how
important is the fishing industry of this coast and how
slow is the Government in making public the full re
ports of its agents. The publication in 1898 of a re
port dealing with conditions in 1895 is not exactly
commendable in a Government that represents an
up-to-date people.
Late as it comes, however, the report can be read
with considerable interest and instruction by all who
desire information on the subject. In commercial
value the fisheries of California, Oregon, Washington
and Alaska rank in importance next to those of New
England and the Atlantic Middle States. It is, more
over, probable that in the long run the Pacific out
put will exceed that of the East, for even in the years
embodied in this report, which were those of the
panic and depression, the development of the industry
was considerable.
A large portion of the California capital in
vested in fisheries is employed in Alaska, but as that
department of the industry is not included in this re
port, a full showing of the commercial value of the
business to us is not made. Owing to the depression
in prices which prevailed at the time, while the out
put of the salmon fisheries of the State increased
353,274 pounds in 1895 over that of 1892, the money
value decreased $25,778. There was also a marked
shrinkage in the value of the output of oysters and
shrimps, showing that the fish industry, while it in
creased in extent, suffered as well as the rest of the
business of the country from the hard times and lost
much of the rightful profit of its labor.
Much better is the showing made for the coast by
the fisheries of Washington and Oregon. Between
1802 and 1895, despite the depression, the value of the
fishery products of Washington Increased by $470,865
and those of Oregon by $411,731.
To pack the salmon output of the coast requires
upward of 80,000,000 tin cans a year, and this demand
is the cause of considerable industry in making the
cans. The bulk of the can factories are in San Fran
cisco, and it is gratifying to note that even in the
bad year of 1895 a considerable portion of the tin
plate used in the cans was of American manufacture.
An exchange of saffron hue exposes to remark an
editorial entitled, "What It Means to Be 'Yellow,' "
but does not follow with the lucid explanation which
might have been expected. There are few papers in
this country so designated, and the exchange in
question is one of the most vivid among these. The
term, justly applied, means that a paper is above all
else sensational; that it prints a picturesque lie
rather than the sober truth; that it cares not for
reputation; that honor to it is nothing; that it revels
in filth, savors of blackmail, incites to crime, traduces
decency, tends to make the world believe that the
people of this country are low and base, and that the
greatest rogues in jail or out are the proprietors of
these purveyors of carrion. Such is a fair exposition
of the meaning of "yellow."
It must not be considered that the plans outlined
so minutely for an attack on Havana have the sanc
tion of the army or navy officials who will execute
whatever plans may be arranged. As a rule a com
mander does not forward to the enemy a detailed ac
count of what he proposes to do and the available
means. But the yellow correspondent is beyond
control.
The chief reason for regretting that two heavy
weights have signed articles of agreement to fight is
that the event will be regarded as of such importance
as to warrant the giving to it of considerable space
which might be devoted to something worth men
tioning.
The Russian gentleman who remarked that the
United States had barred its own action may now
observe that the tame authority has knocked the
bars dowv
k . _
FABLES WITHOUT MORALS
"Why do you call this paper an
extra?" asked a man who had purchas
ed an evening sheet and discovered
that the matter it contained under
startling headlines was at least twen
ty-four hours old.
"Husl,." said the proprietor. "If
everybody asked such fool questions
as that we would soon cease to pub
lish any paper at all."
Nevertheless the man went his way
not wholly appeased.
One day a yellow paper having fallen
from a car window was found by an
incautious skunk, who was rash enough
to nose it, and then proceeded home
ward with an air of dejection and ill
ness.
"What is the matter, my dear?" asked
his wife, approaching to greet him.
"Do not come near," he exclaimed.
"On the way home I had an accident
by which I acquired an intolerable
odor. I have emptied my perfume sac
in a vain effort to overcome it."
Thereupon the skunk wept bitterly
and agreed for a week to sleep out of
doors.
A man meeting- a friend whom he dis
covered in the aot of wiping a perspir
ing brow, remarked, "Is it hot enough
for you?"
"Plenty hot enough for me," replied
the friend, wringing his handkerchief
and replacing it in his pocket, "but the
only locality hot enough for you is the
one we read about."
Having spoken thus he seized a cob
blestone and smote the inquirer sore
and dead. The Coroner having list
ened patiently to the particulars, said
he had seldom sat in a case which gave
him so much genuine pleasure, and
brought in a verdict of commendable
homicide.
A noisy Congressman rose in his place
and in thunderous tones demanded war.
"I suppose In case of getting that
which you seek you would shoulder a
musket and haste to the front," said a
voice from the gallery.
"It would be unseemly for a person
of my standing to do that," replied the
speaker, unabashed, "but If there Is
any chance to give orders over a long
distance telephone I can be counted on."
Later It was explained that while the
Congressman was really of the rabid
fire variety, he was loaded to the muz
zle with blank ammunition.
"Certainly I killed the man," said the
prisoner at the bar, addressing the
court in easy conversational style, "but
your Honor must bear in mind that I
was crazy at the time; in fact, I culti
vated a state of insanity so as to be
enabled to kill him with the least risk
to myself."
"Enter a plea of guilty," remarked
the Judge to his clerk, "and add that in
view of the attempt to play this dig
nified court for a sucker the prisoner
will be hanged at sunrise to-morrow."
At this point spectators noticed for
the first time that the figure of
Justice had snatched the bandage from
its eyes and was indulging in a wink.
It befell that a prisoner was haled
before a Police Judge and there ac
cused of vagrancy, which charge he
was readily able to disprove. "You are
fined $50," remarked the Judge,
thoughtfully stroking a luxuriant
beard.
"But why," protested the defendant's
lawyer, "should my client be fined when
we have shown him not to be a vag
rant?"
"If you think there would be any
thing like a financial coup In fining a
man unable to pay up you are not onto
the ways of this august tribunal," re
sponded the Judge with crushing dig
nity. In a brief time it was noted that
the court and the bailiff had gone out
to take a drink.
When a sovereign state decided to
erect a denot for its favorite monop
oly, search was made for honest men
to "administer the funds. Thereupon
divers rogues, disguising themselves,
made clamor for the office, saying:
"We be the most honest of mortals, and
we invite that our records be scanned
and if It be found that any among us
ever stole a hot stove, then will we
concede our unfltness."
But the suspicions of the people
were not allayed and as the work pro
gressed they said among themselves:
"Verily if these fellows stole no hot
Btoves, surely they no more than wait
ed for the stoves to cool."
A woman being on the witness-stand
was asked her business and replied that
she was a lawyer's assistant.
"I do not fully comprehend," said the
court "Who is the lawyer?"
"I do not mind telling you In con
fidence," said the woman, "that he Is
any lawyer who needs the services of
a widow to assist him in getting hold of
a big estate."
"Then you are a professional widow
prepared to shed tears at the tomb of
the millionaire for a fair whack of the
proceeds?"
"Your Judicial mind has exactly
grasped the situation," acknowledged
the woman, who was after a brief con
sultation admitted straightway to the
bar.
By chance a Falsehood met a. Repu
tation and threatened 111.
"I do not fear you," said the Repu
tation.
"You would if you knew how solid I
am with the editor of the Yellow War-
Cryer," returned the Falsehood haught
ily.
Then the Reputation fled, and even as
it went observers saw that a saffron
smudge had come upon it.
An Uncle Samuel, who owned a large
farm, hearing a. tumult looked over
his back fence one day and observed
a number of people engaged in cut
ting the throats of each other. Being
a person of peacable inclination the
sight was not pleasing to him.
"It would be a great favor," he said
mildly to the one wielding the largest
blade, "if you were to desist."
"Go to," retorted the one addressed,
cleansing a gory machete on the
tresses of a murdered woman. "I do
I not see that this concerns you. Be
sides, I want you to understand that I
am a gentleman."
It was with visible signs of dissat
isfaction that the uncle withdrew, and
some who knew him opined that he had
merely gone to get a gun.
Drawing near to a man who had coin
in his pocket a follower of fortune re
marked that possessing a valuable tip
on the races he was prepared to sell it
"Are you sure that your tip is a good
one?" asked the man with coin, his in
terest instantly aroused.
Being assured that the tip was such
.as is technically termed a "dead open
and shut," the man with coin reached
for his purse.
"It will be both profit and pleasure
to pay you $2 not to reveal to me the
tip," said the man with coin, handing
over the silver.
Then those who heard marveled at
his wisdom, and knew that he had been
there before.
One day a noble ship sailed into a
friendly port on a mission of peace, and
shortly thereafter was blown up by a
mine, so that of those on board many
perished miserably.
"Why have we been thus treated?"
asked the survivors, "and why are
these our comrades dead and our good
ship in the slime of your harbor?"
"The ways of Providence are past
findina out," respor.ded thos^ to \vhonÂ»
the inquiry was addressed, "but be as
sured that Bbrr#w is also heavy upon
us."
Later, when it was learned that this
grief was because of the fact that any
should have escaped, the survivors
made much ado, nor held their peace
upon being told that the explosion was
an Incident. H. J.

THE NEW CHARTER,
ThÂ« Editor of The Callâ Sir: ThÂ« new
charter is under consideration by thÂ«
people, who have had am;>le opportunity
to study its provisions. No more Im
portant Instrument has ever been sub
mitted to their votes, and It is due to tha
Freeholders who have given their tima
and services in its construction that ita
merits, demerits and probable results
should be adequately discussed and clearly
recognized, since its influence for good or"
evil, must be felt for many years to come.
The only fitting arena for a public dis
cussion is The Call. The Chronicle hai
shown its want of public ' spirit by sys
tematic silence on this vital question and
the yellow journal has sacrificed Its inde
pendence to its protege, the Mayor, as if
he were the only embodiment of wisdom,
honesty and economy and the only high
priest of progress. It remains, therefore,
for The Call to invite an open discussion,
the more desirable because the charter is
a. long and complicated document which
few will read and fewer fully understand
and the results of which may be difficult
to foresee.
What then are the opinions of our most
thoughtful citizens? What are the Im
provements which may be reasonably ex
pected from its adoption? Will it provide
us with an honest, efficient and econ
omical government? Will it give us a
board of incorruptible Supervisors? Will
it destroy the power of the "bosses" and
disperse the army of political henchmen
who have , now possession of the City
Han? . Will it put a end to corruption,
'"-â ncy v extravagance and waste?
will it enable the government to pave,
light and cleanse the streets, to acquire
and honestly conduct those public utili
ties which form such an important fea
ture of modern city government? Will it
promote the credit of the citizens, the
safety of investments and the circulation
of capital? Will it foster commercial en
terprise and relieve business of unneces
sary burdens? Will it promote the better
employment of the people? Is it a home
rule charter which secures to the citizens
the control of taxation and expenditure
*"Â£ the management of their own affairs?
That these are the proper objects of a
charter no one can possibly deny, nor can
it be doubted that a charter likely to se
cure them is our greatest want. "But let
us. not blindly rush into the business of
charter making without adequate con
s deration. The charters .of American
cities have been remarkable neither for
wisdom nor success. Municipal govern
ment is admitted to be the conspicuous
failure of the UnJted States. Not a single
large city has escaped Â« the evils or cor
ruption, political machines, extravagance
and waste, and it may be that our new
charter is little more than the modifica
tion ot a system which has been found
wanting in a dozen: other cities. Let us
ml : i re , that lt is not - and rather submit
a little longer to th t ills we have than fly
to others that may be merely anticipated.
\ve might be much worse off We are
free.from debt. Our taxation is not too
heavy. What we want isa government
which may be trusted to spend our
money with more reference to wisdom
and economy than to actual amount

The will of Salome Anderson, the
"woman Mason," made public to-day,
completely exonerates her from the
charge of absorbing the estate of her in
sane sister, and shows that ample pro
vision was made tor Mrs. Doretha Petz
echler. who is in Napa Asylum.
Just before her death Mrs. Anderson
was cited to Bhow what she had done
with the estate, valued at JIOOO, and of
which Ehe was guardian. The will shows
that Mrs. Ajiderson's actions were . both
honorable and sisterly, for on October
16, 1890, she bequeathed $3000 for the bene
fit of her unfortunate sister. The clause
In the will relating to Mrs. Petzschler is
as follows:
I give and bequeath to Live Oak Lodge No.

Hilgard, director of the agricultural ex

station at Paso Robles:
The facts are simply that owing to the ex
tremely deficient rainfall for this season, all
experimental work, planting, etc., has neces
sarily been abandoned there until the au

absence of irrigation facilities, is to maintain
as far as possible the existlnK plantations by
careful surface tillage to prevent evaporation.
Under these conditions a "workman in chance
is all that Is required, and Inspector of Ma
tion Charles H. Shlnn is at present visiting the
station in order to arrange for the season _s
suspension of active work and the selection of
a suitable workman. It is true that consider
ations of economy enter into the case, inas

CHANGED HIS TESTIMONY.
C. D. Haines Admits in Court That
He Was Influenced.
OAKLAND. April 13.â A sensation de
veloped just before the close of the day's
session in Justice Lawrence's court in
East Oakland during the second day's
examination of Stacey itogers for the
shooting of E. E. Halsey in Berkeley on
the 29th of last month. Charles D.
Haines, at whose house the trouble oc
curred and a witness to the shooting,
testified that he had changed his testi
mony on direct examination from what
he gave at the Coroner's inquest after
talking with Herbert V. Herbert, in the
employ of the District Attorney's office.
Haines was "on the stand all of the
forenoon. He said Rogers called on the
night in question and Mrs. Haines an
swered the bell. Rogers asked for
Haines, and when the witness went to
the door he said, "I understand you do
not want me to come to your house." He
said he replied, "Yes, sir; excuse me,"
and was about to close the door when
Halsey pushed by him into the door
when the snot was tired. He testified
that Halsey's hand was extended with
open palm downward.
On a rigid cross-examination by Judge
Gibson Ilaines admitted that his testi
mony at the inquest was correct and
that he had changed it after a talk and
suggestions from Herbert. At the in
quest Haines testified that Halsey ap
proached Rogers in a most threatening
manner, and he believed intended to
thrash him. as he said he would before
the doorbell rang.
Deputy Coroner Strelghtif of Berkeley,
who found a razor in Halsey's pocket
after his death, is dangerously ill at his
home, and in order to take his testimony
Judge Lawrence will hold court in his
bedroom to-morrow morning as soon
after 10 o'clock as convenient. Deputy
District Attorney Lin Church will rep
resent the people and Thomas J. Thomas
the defense at that time. In the after
noon the examination will be resumed In
East Oakland, and probably finished on
Friday.

shall not change my opinion."
Some effort is being made to have what
is being spoken of as "a special session"
of the Grand Jury. There Is no such
thing. A week ago the Grand Jury ad
journed to the call of the chair, and
whenever the chair issues a call for a
meeting it will be a regular session of the
Grand Jury, and not in any sense a "spe
cial" one. One of the members of the
Grand Jury said to-day that their work
has been hampered by the doings of
those who would use the Grand Jury for
political ends. "We want, if possible, to
find something definite," he said, "and as
coon as anything criminal can be traced
to any party we will at once take posi
tive action. We cannot, however, permit
ourselves to be used by political factions
or for political ends. Our duty is a hard
one to perf rm. and it is made more
hard when insincere people try to use
us to carry out their personal ambitions.
It Is bad enough to have to withstand
and try to overcome the tactics of those
who are according to current report try
ing to corrupt the city government, or
who have corrupted it, but there is noth
ing to be gained by the enemies ** these
corruptionists trying to brir>~ about tneir
indictments and at the same time make
political capital.
"I am not at liberty to tell one word of
what has transpired in the Grand Jury
room, but I may say that we have heard
some startling stories. Most of them,
however, have been contradicted in one
form or another, or point to actions of
such a nature that, though indiscreet
and morally bad, are not criminal, and
consequently they do not come within
our jurisdiction."
When the Grand Jury reconvenes it is
probable that subpenas will be issued for
some of the directors of the Contra Costa
Water Company, in the hope that many
of the tales of bribery may be traced to
their origin. The company held its an
nual meeting yesterday, and it is stated
that much interesting discussion took
place among the directors regarding the
situation in this city. It was considered
advisable not to make any changes in the
directors at this time, and it was given
out that this was done to protect the
company from the insinuation that such
a step would be taken merely for the
purpose of complicating matters before
the Grand Jury. If a new board of di
rectois had been elected they would of
course be perfectly innopent of an that
has transpired the past few months,
while the old board woulci have no offi
cial standing in the company, and con
sequently would say that they knew no
more than their ruccessors. This eltua
tlon not being a politic one was avoided
by the re-election of the entlrÂ» board.
When the case of the people against
Harry Thomas was called this morning

ALAMEDA, April 13.-Expert Davis
presented his report on the Harbourne
defalcation to the Board of Library Trus
tees last evening. The board directed that

MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING.
Missing Records of the Mission
Grammar School Wanted for the
Department.
For some weeks it has been known to
the Superintendent of Schools that the
missing records of the Mission Grammar
School, which were wanted in the Craven
case, were in the possession of James M.
Wilkins, proprietor of the Cliff House.
The fact was communicated to Chief
Lees, and the District Attorney and the
Chief went to the Cliff House and saw
the books. Wilkins was asked to give up
the books, but declined to do so except
by order of the court. Monday the Dis
trict Attorney applied to Judge Belcher
for the necessary order, but it has not
yet been granted.
There are four books: TeacherÃ' time
and class recor> s for April, 1R95; class
records April 1. ISOS, to close of the half
year; teacners' time table and class rec
ords for the last half of the year 1895 and
the same for the half-year from January
1 to June 30, 189$.
"The only object," said District Attor
ney Barnes yesterday, "in securing pos-
Bession of the books is to complete the
annals of the School Department. With
out them tne records of the department
would be incomplete, and, as they are
public documents they should not be in
the possession of an outsider. As far as
I know niere is no intention oÂ£ founding
a criminal charge against Mrs. Craven
upon these records. In fact. I know of
no present intention of reviving the Cra
ven case in any form. There is nothing
in the records in question bearing upon
the case of Notary Cooney, which is the
only phase of th'- Craven litigation pend
ing in the criminal courts. '
Chief Lees said that the long-drawn
out story in a morning paper was all rot.
He was notified that the books were at
the Cliff Housf and as tbev wore n ,,h lic
documents they should be in the posses
sion of tne Schor ' Department.

Wlllard Powell, an old man, Is in the
Insane ward in the Receiving Hospital,
and efforts are being made to find his
friends so that he can be taken care of.
He arrived from Chatfleld, Minn., on Sat
urday and registered at a hotel, but he
does not know where It was. He met
a hackman who took him to a clothing
store and sold, him a suit of clothes and
a watch for $33. They are not worth $3.
The old man was unable to find his hotel
and wandered about the streets till a
policeman took him to the prison. Yes
terday he tied a handkerchief round his
neck, and as it was thought he was try
ing to choke himself he was sent to the
hospital. He has a friend in the city
named Eugene Wood, but he does not
know where he lives.

BOLD ASSAULT
AND ROBBERY
Two Men Hold Up a
Groceryman and Take
His Valuables.
Arrested While Fleeing Witl-
Their Plunder From the
Scene.
The Plucky Grocer Fired Five Shots
at the Men While They
Ran.
This morning at about 2 o'clock two
men entered the grocery store of E. Lleb
scher, on the corner of Mason and Pacific
streets, and demanded that the propri
etor give up his valuables. Upon his pro
testing they beat him over the head with
a revolver and compelled him to submit.
They took his watch, money amounting
to $117 and other valuables and ran out,
going toward Broadway.
Liebscher grabbed his revolver and fol
lowed to the street and fired five times at
the flpeing men. Officers Conway, Peshon
and Connors heard the firing and ran
toward the store, meeting the robbers,
whom they placed under arrest.
The booty secured by the robbers was
found on their persons and the men were
taken to the California 'street station
where they were booked on a charge of
assault with a deadly weapon and rob
bery.-
The men gave the t names of James
Thorn and John Winrdw. It is believed
by the police that the two men have
been connected with the various rob
beries which have taken place on the
north side.
Llebscher was badly bruised about the
head and face, but his injuries are not
serious.
WILL BE A TOTAL WRECK.
Captain Peaoody of the Ship New
York Thinks the Vessel Will
Never Be Saved.
Captain Peabody of the ill-fated ship
New York, which a month ago became
stranded on the shores of Ilalfmoon Bay,
reached the city a few days ago and
joined his wife and child at a down-town
hotel.
Although out of employment by the
loss of his vessel the captain shows no
signs of worry, as he has just received
a sympathetic letter from the owners of
the vessel, in which they speak highly
of his ability as a seaman and hold him
blameless for the wreck of the vessel.
In speaking about the wrecked vessel
last evening Captain Peabody said: "On
the night of the accident a gale was
blowing and a haze prevented our seeing
anything. One by one I sent men aloft
to sight the Farallones or the Point Bo
nita light, but without success. At last
1 went aloft, and some distance ahead I
saw breakers. 1 tried to wear my ship
around, but she did not answer her helm
as quickly as she would in the open sea.
The strong undercurrent rapidly drew us
inshore, and before we knew it we were
high and dry on the land.
"The gale increased in violence and the
waves went over us, washing everything
before them. We tried to send up rock
ets as signals of distress, but as fast as
they wore lighted the waves would put
tin m out. At last we tried lighted
oakum saturated with turpentine, and
thus ga\ne those on shore warning of our
peril."
After narrating the perilous scenes en
acted that awful night, the captain said
he lost nearly everything he possessed in
the world by the wrecking or the vessel.
He has been sailing thff mighty deep
since 1562 and was given his command !
when twenty-three years old. This is the i
first wreck he ever experienced during |
his long sc-rvice. Mrs. Peabody and their
little girl are still unnerved by the perils
of that night.
Captain Peabody expects to be given
another command very shortly. As to the
New York, he thinks she can never be
recovered.
SOCIALISM VS. ANARCHY.
A Spirited Debate by Champions of
Both Causes.
A joint debate on the question of
"Christian Socialism vs. Anarchy" drew
a large and appreciative audience to
Scottish Hall Tuesday night. The meet
ing was opened with a short address by
Peter B. McCabe, who was selected by
both principals to act as chairman and
umpire. The anarchists were out in force,
nearly all the local groups having dele
gations present, while the Christian
Socialists were equally well represented.
Andrew Klemencie. the Hpokesman for
"Anarchy," is a veteran in the Anarchist
ranks both in Europe and America, and
though not as fluent a speaker as his
opponent, is recognized for his sincerity
and earnestness of purpose as well as
zeal in promoting his ideas. Theodore
Lynch, his opponent, is the secretary and
one* of the organizers of the Union Kt
form League recently started by Rev. W.
D. P. Bliss for the spread of Christian
Socialism. The speakers held the floor
alternately for* an hour and a half, and
were followed by an eaual number of
socialists and anarchists till 11 o'clock,
when the debate was closed.
WOMAN BRUTALLY BEATEN.
Lawrence Massoni, a Butcher, Ar
rested on a Charge of Battery.
Lawrence Massoni, a butcher at 107
Hayes street, was arrested yesterday on
a warrant charging him with battery,
but a more serious charge may be regis
tered against him.
Massoni is a neignoor of Reuben Side
man, who has a ladles' tailor-shop. The
children of the two families had a fight
Tuesday, and in me afternoon Massoni
wont into Sldeman's store, and, after
abusing Mrs. Sidema:-.. knocked her down
and punched her on the side. Her
screams brought her husband to her as
sistance, and when Massoni saw him he
ran.
Mrs. Sidemnn is In a poorstateof health,
and it is feared that serious complications
will follow the brutal treatment she has
received at the hands of Massonf.
Sldeman swore to the warrant for Mas
soni's arrest in Judge Conlan's court yes
terday, and the Judge after hearing the
â¢story of the assault fixed his bonds at
$500.

owned by J. S. Gibson of Yolo County,
but had been taught the elementary rudi
ment? of the gam â¢ by the veteran George
Howson. He made his debut in the
three and a haU furlong scramble for
maidens, decided under selling conditions,
and was entered to be sold' for $500. His
work nad been far above the average, and
from 10 to 1 he was played down to 5 to
2 favoritism. Turning the bend for home
behind four of the other starters with
his mouth wide open and apparently
"nopelessly pocketed, Henneasy managed
to squeeze through on the inside, and,
driving at the end, got the decision from
Rey Hooker, a 00 to 1 shot, by a scant
head. When put up to be auctioned me
winner was bid up to $1100, at which fig
ure his trainer sorrowfully parted with
him.
Several other highly educated ones were
put over the plate, and the ring was hard
nit. Three favorites and three well
backed outsiders helped deplete the book
makers" exchequer.
In the linal live and a half furlong
sprint it seemed as though everybody on
the grounds had a bet on George Miller.
The olil-time favorite was pounded down
from flvea to 5 to 2 favoritism, and won all
by himself, with Potentate capturing the
place from San Mateo.
The books got in wrong at the kick-off.
They laid ."> and G to 1 in the opening bet
ting against Kly, and, after being played
down to 8 in .". favoritism, the geiding led
his company all tne way, winning cleverly
from Alma. McFarlane took the show.
The end-stay folks got their checks
down in plenty on Oahu to win the second
event at 6 funongs, forcing the oaus
against the Idalium filly down from 10 to
6. With Gouin in the saddle she skipped
to the front and fairly walked in. Ap
plejack was secc.-Q, driving from Joe
Levy.
The Burns & Waterhou6e entry. Sweet
Faverdnle, carried the bulk of the money
bet on the mile ana a furlong selling run,
end, aftf-r striking the stretch In the lead,
was heaten out by both Earl Cochran and
Twinkior. The winner. Earl Cochran, was
& to 1 in the betting.
Kittlemen Bros.' good mare Midlight
looked pounds the best of the crowd in
the lifth event, over six furlongs, but re
ceded in the betting, and showed a notice
able lack of speed. Petxotto. a 12 to 1 shot,
was In front from the lirst, galloping in
ahead of Lost Girl, another despised one.
The favorite was third.
TRACK NOTES.
The Easterners are gradually parkins; their
grips and pullinp out on each departing over
land train. Fred Cowan and Pete Gaffney left
for New York la?t night, and Bookmaker
Charles Walters starts for St. Louis this morn-
Ing. Thr- latter is a heavy losrr over the sea-
Fr.n's booking, quitting between $12,000 and
$15,000 behind. On Saturday next Harry Griffin,
the ex-Jo< key, will bid his friends adieu.
W. H. Timmons, it seems, has been dickering
with J. S. Gibson for the purchase of Juggler.
Satisfactory terms could not be arrived at. so
â when the two-year-old won yesterday Mr. Tim
mons sot him at his own rl.rjre. He also
cai-hed a good bÂ°t over the colt's victory. Much
sympathy was expressed for Trainer Howson,
but he simply phared the fate of all natives
racing horses for Eastern rain.
There weie altogether too many "uncorklngs"

yesterday. T. E. Latta, the owner of Rey
Hooker, was pleased to confide to his more inti
mate rriends that the colt had been resting
easily of late, and they loaded up at the elong
ated i) rice of 5u and 60 to 1. Beaten a short
head on the finishing line was assuredly ma
terial for another hard luck chapter.
W. B. Sink Jr. departs for the Eastern coun
try on Monday next, with Formero, Refugee
and Rio Chlco. The former, a son of the South
ern California sire. imÂ». Conveth, is a colt
above the average, and If not killed off will
take some beating from the blue grass fed
candidates. "Pa" Bradley' s Traverser will
Journey over the mountains In the same car.
Johnny Humphreys looked contented with all
the world alter Juggler whispered in. He held
some pasteboards on the colt, getting on at
top price.
Although fond of bouquets. Richard Clawson
of Woodland had a difficult time at the con
clusion of the fourth event In getting some per
son, sane or insane, to tell him he rode a good
race on Twlnkler. Master Clawson takes liber
ties with the Judges and with horses at times
when it looks like handling hot coals. If Claw
son could forget that he and Tod Sloan are
the greatest of all riders he would pilot more
â winners.
Starter J. B. Ferguson was yesterday In re
ceipt of a telesrram from E. A. Tipton. man
ager of the Montana circuit, stating that the
Anaconda entries will close on Saturday next.
Entries for the big $5000 "Labor Day" Handi
cap, over one and a quarter miles, close on
May 7.
Had he not been cut off Just as the barrier
was released. Juggler would have won hands
down. Report had him working four furlongs
In 50 seconds, with IIS pounds In the saddle.
Fly opened in the betting at 6 and 6 to 1, at
which figure considerable coin was taken in by
the books.
This will be cut-in day at the track, and it Is
said that George Rose will b* an absentee from
the block. The big California penciler is said
to be a good loser on the season.
Eroica ran a delightiul race for a favorite,
and one or two books laid quite liberal place
odds. The conjurers will get their work in
from this time on unjess the officials relapse
from their reverie. Three days of "get-away
stakes" Is quite sufficient.
Palo Alto Stock Farm has issued Its annual
handsomely bound catalogue of thoroughbred
and trotting stock, containing complete pedi
grees of the sires and matrons of that noted
breeding establishment.
The annual sale of the Belle Meade yearlings
will be held this year at the Sheepshead Bay
Â»ckÃ, the last three days in June. The
Bale will undoubtedly attract the attention of
turfmen in all parts ot the country, as the
produce of this celebrated Tennessee breeding
establishment have performed so well in past
yean that owners are anxious to get a son or
daughter of the great Iroquols, Longstreet,
Clarendon, Tremont, Luke Blackburn or any of
the grand thoroughbreds who make Belle
Meade their home. This year's crop of two-year
olds already started have shown up exceed
ingly well, and the first two races given on

youngster, Buena Ventura.

IN THE SERVICE OF THE FLAG.
The Tugs Vigilant and Active Turned Over to the Government.
The Fearless to Follow,
THE two steel tues Vigilant and
Active are lying along-side the Union
.Iron Works wharf awaiting 1 the dis
position of the Government. They
were taken over there yesterday, and
then their captains and crews came home
in Peterson's launch wearing an air of
sorrow and dejection that was painful
to see.
The first official news of the change that
had been made came to the men yester
day morning when they were told to take
all their belongings ashore and to strip
the boats of all property not belonging
to them or necessary in their navigation.
Folsom-street wharf resembled a house
moving during a good part or the morn
ing, and then the crews set to work to
haul out the big towing hawsers and
'mooring lines.
The Active got cff first, and as she left
the berth she had occupied so long her
whistle wailed mournfully and the sur
rounding steamers and tugs answered In
the same minor key. Soon after she had
gone the Vigilant was ready, and she, too,
blew three melancholy toots as she left
the crowd on the dock behind her. As
s=he passed the Sea Queen, of the Red
Stacks, she was saluted and she woke the
echoes In answer; the Reliance, with a
ship in tow, did the honors, and the Red
mond farther up the bay joined in.

I used to wrap her hands up, and when I
would dress her, I had to put her on the table,
for I could not hold her. She would kick and

her face and arms almost to pieces.

It was not a happy going away at all.
The men on the boats were silent and
glum. The boats had been their homes,
they said, and it was like leaving home
to go away from them. Captain Silovich
of the Vigilant declared he would stick
by his boat if they would only let him.
"I don't care if she does go to war," he
said, "they will want some one to run
her, and I know her and she knows me.
and I'll go along with her if they will
let me."
There was no ceremony. The boats
were tied to the wharf and then the men
went home. The Fearless will follow
them when she arrives here.
What the Government is going to do
with the two boats and the Fearless when
she comes in is a source of much specu
lation along the water front. They may
be made into dispatch boats or they may
be made into patrol boats, or they may be
put In the torpedo service. Lieutenant
Capp, the naval officer at the Union Iron
Works, who took charge of them, de
clares he does not know the intention
of the Government regarding them. He
made a careful inspection of them as soon
as they were securely moored to the
wharf, but he said the Government had
not yet made known what the boats
would be used for In case of emergency.
"They are only makeshifts as war ves
sels anyway," he said. "They were not
built for such service, and so cannot be
expected to be as good as boats specially
designed. In view of that fact they may
not be used at all, or only in case of
emergancy."
pieces, with tone and understanding and
poise that are simply marvelous in a
little girl of 9. Perhaps the most re
markable feat of the afternoon was her
improvisation on the theme selected at
random from several submitted by the
audience. She worked the four bars of
the unharmonized melody into quite an
imposing bit of music, giving to it several
moods and keys and preserving the char
acter and consistency to the very last.
Little Paloma seems to have not only the
temperament and instinctive feeling, but
a fair knowledge of the science of music,
and it is good news to hear that her
present "season" is limited to two
months, after which she will go to Leip
sic, finish her education, and (unless she
should go the way of so many prodigies)
live up to the brilliant promises of her
childhood. Paloma is a child even on the
concert platform. Among the flowers
given her during yesterday's recital was
a box of candy, which she hugged to her
heart with the most convincing delight.
Mrs. Florence Scarborough sang "My
Heart at Thy Sweet Voice," from "Sam
son and Delilah", the song of the mother
from the "Prophet" and an encore piece,
her big contralto sounding to especial ad
vantage in the dramatic aria of Meyer
beer's. Assisted by Mrs. Scarborough,
little Miss Paloma will give two more re
citals in the same hall, to-night and to
morrow afternoon.
In the evening the Sherman & Clay
Hall was the scene of another interest
ing concert, a benefit given to young
Marino, the violinist. Marino was in
splendid form and fairly surpassed him
self in the D minor concerto of Wie
niauski, playing with much more staying
power and generalship than usual.- The
lad's talents are beyond question and it is
to be hoped that enough money will be
realized out of last night's concert and
the other one which will be given Sat
urday afternoon in the same hall to en
able him to stay abroad for a couple of
years longer and come home a credit to
himself and to the town. Considerable
Interest was centered in the 'cello solos
of Ernest Lent, who, it will be remem
bered, was quite a failure at a recent
symphony concert. Mr. Lent's perform
ance last night of the Chopin E-flat noc
turne and a Popper tarantelle proved-con
clusively that nis previous disaster was
only the result of stage fright. He is
not a particularly emotional 'cellist and
his tone lacks distinction, but he plays
discreetly and with an easy reliabflity
that should be valuable in concerted
work. MrÃ. Carr and Abramoff will as
eist at Saturday's concert.
From all present accounts Melba's sea
son at the California will be limited to
three performances, on Tuesday, Thurs
day and Saturday evenings of next week.
As already announced the operas are "The
Barber," "Travlata" and "Lucia." The
Bale of seats commences this morning.
The line of ticket-seekers will - have
formed long before this paper is printed,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, AFRTL 14, 1898.
It 1b generally supposed that the tugs
crew than they have been carrying; that
a speed wheel will be put on in place of
the propeller designed for strength in
towing, which they now carry, and that
they will be supplied with small rapid
fire guns. They have coal capacity
enough to make them valuable as patrol
boats or scouts, and then, too, they will
make excellent transports for men and
supplies when speed is a matter for con
sideration.
The two tugs are moored side by side at
the Iron Works wharf and are in charge
of the two first mates, William Olsen
of the Vigilant and Michael Downey of
the Active. They will be retained as boat
keepers until the two boats are refitted
or are ordered to the island. It Is prob
able, however, that any refitting to be
done will be done at the Union Iron
Works.
The dock where the tugs used to lie
looks deserted, and the men of the tug
boat office and around the wharves are
beginning to talk seriously of war. The
purchase of the two boats and their sud
den departure are the first real touch of
war that has been felt here, and added
to the sentiment that a sailor always
weaves around hjs ship is a realization
of the. errand upon which they have gone
Despite this, the men want to go with
them, and it is a safe wager that they
would stay by the tugs as much because
they have been their homes as because
they have gone into the service of the
flag.
THAT WATERED
LOT OF WHISKY
A Gauger's Certificate That
May Have Been Forged,
Here or in Kentucky.
Agent Thomas Thinks That There
May Have Been Some Moonshine
Work in the Matter.
Special Internal Revenue Agent Bert
Thomas yesterday sent the Collector of
the Second District of Kentucky a state
ment of the seizure and detention of a
large number of barrels of whisky from
saloons in this city, as exclusively an
nounced in yesterday's issue of The Call.
He had discovered some more than or
dinarily suspicious circumstances in con
nection with the ten barrels placed un
der detention in A. M. Fink's saloon at
the corner of Pine and Market streets.
The gauger's certificate is undated, and
purports to have been signed by "A. 8.
Rutlidge, gauger tor the Second District
of Kentucky," the whisky being the
product of the Queen Distilling Company.
There is something else besides the date
that is wrong with the certicate, and the
Internal Revenue Collector for that dis
trict has been asked to investigate that
particular lot of whisky.
As found by Agents Thomas and Towne
in Mr. Fink's cellar, the liquor had been
reduced with yater to 90 proof, the certi
ficate caving for 107 proof. Jt is clear to
the officials that there has been fraud
somewhere and that a violation of law
has taken place. It is probable also that
Mr. Fink was bunkoed, if he himself aid
not. water the liquor, for he has paid for
liquor of 107 proof and received only 90
proof for his money. It is possible also
that without Mr. Fink's knowledge the
original contents upon which the tax was
paid have been removed, and the stamped
barrels refilled with moonshine illicitly
distilled whisky properly reduced and rec
tified without troubling the Government
officials about sucn little matters as li
censes, taxes, etc. This is the most
serious aspect of the case, for it may be
evidence of an illicit distillery in this
revenue district. The seizures and de
tentions were made by one of Collector
Lynch's deputies under direction of Spe
cial Agent Thomas. Mr. Lynch said yes
terday that the matter had not yet been
reported to him, and that he could take
no action in the premises until the agents
filed their reports. In fact, he said that
he was not aware officially that any seiz
ures had been made.

Another Southern Pacific Suit.

the Southern Pacific Company. She al

HE GOT HIS
CHINESE BACK
A Search on the Front
for a Shanghaied
Celestial.
M. Hart Lost His Cook and
Brought Out the
Police.
Louis Yun Sing Made His Disappear
ance Because He Owes
Money.
Mark Hart has lost and found his Chi
nese cook, and thereby hangs a tale of >m
pressment, shanghai and nocturnal wan
derings on the water front with a cordon
of police in a vain endeavor to recover pos
session of a son of Asia. Louis Yun Sing
Is the Celestial in question, and his mys
terious disappearance has been the cause
of it all.
Without a warning of any kind Louis
Tun Sing left the Hart household on
California street late in the afternoon
last Monday, and since that time a care
ful and well planned search was in
stituted. Yun Sing did not disappear
of his own free will. When he
left the California street house he
was escorted by another Asiatic, who
called for the very purpose of carrying
the servant away with him. The fact of
Yun Sing's leaving the Harts so uncere
moniously is attested by neighbors who
saw the two Chinese walk down Califor
nia street together. They also say that
Yun Sing was very excited, shouting vo
ciferously and gesturing like a man who
saw impending evil ahead, but could not
avoid it.
At the time of his departure Yun Sing
was in the midst of his culinary duties.
A dinner was in preparation and that is
as far as it got, for when the head of the
house returned home for the evening he
found his wife and children scattered
about, searching for the departed. Louis
Yun Sing was nowhere to be
found. Dinner at the Hart house
hold was late that night, and it
was hardly finished before Mark Hart
determined to report the matter to the
police, and with their co-operation at
tempt to track his elusive chef de cui
sine.
The day following Hart was surprised
by a visit from two sons of Confucius.
With weird and mysterious manner they
inquired if he had lost Tils cook. They
knew all about it and out of mere friend
ship to Louis iun Sing said they would
acquaint Hart with full details of his
abduction and impressment. Their
story is this: Louis Yun Sing owed an
other yellow skinned Oriental $18 and
had at all times refused and still refuses
to pay the same. For this persistent de
termination to avoid his obligations the
bold and bad man of the story devised a
scheme which has proved to be a coup
de graoe. He fell upon the credulous
Yun Sing at an opportune moment and
by the cogency of his reasoning induced
the latter to go with him. The two in
formers say that Yun Sing was carried
aboard the Indiana, a steamer that will
tail for Alaska this morning. The cred
itor Is according to their story the boss
of a Chinese gang got together for Yu
kon service.
After listening to this plausible tale
Hart notified the police. A sergeant was
delegated to accompany him in the
search of the steamer lying at Spear
street, and on Tuesday evening the Chi
nese hunters took thp field. At the Har
bor Police Station an additional force
was attached to the squad and the hunt
proceeded.
The party went direct to the Indiana,
and the officer in charge of the moonlight
expedition demanded admittance. This
was refused, but when the badge of au
thority was displayed sesamic results
followed. All through the ship the party
searched with Hart in vain. To his re
peated cries of "Louis" no response was
given, and after a little blasphemy the
disappointed hand returned to the Har
bor Police Station, weary and wharf
stained.
Yesterday morning Hart received an
other visit from a Chinese. The tenor of
his story is that Louis Yun Sing was on
the ship, but that the boss, expecting a
search, sequestered him in Chinatown,
and that just before the ship is to sail
to-day the shanghaied Celestial will be
carried aboard.
Late yesterday afternoon Mr. Hart,
with two police officers, found the China
man locked in a room back of a butcher
shop on Dupont street. He was released
and tak^n homo. He said he had been
on board the Indiana, but had been sent
ashore when the search was made.
REFUSES TO
BE EVICTED
Interesting Fight for the Pos
session of Four Rooms on
Turk Street.
Mrs. Fannie L. Mntson, a Photogra
pher, Holds the Fort Against
All Comers.
A stubborn fight has been In progress
for some months for the possession of
four rooms in the lodging-house at 6 Turk
street. Mrs. Fannie L. Matson, a photo
grapher, holds the fort, and defies the
proprietor to evict her.
Since last August the fight haa been
going on in the Superior courts, and an
evietion,suit is now pending before Judge
Bahrs. The fight has temporarily been
transferred to the Police Court, and Judge
Joachimsen will to-day have the oppor
tunity of hearing both sides of the story.
It seems that Dr. C. F. Rea, the then
proprietor, gave Mrs. Matson notice to
quit last August, hut Phe, refused to do so.
Then the doctor would not allow the ele
vator to run to her flat, and she brought
suit against him for $10,000 damages,
while ne brought suit for ejectment
against her for non-payment of rent.
Since then Mrs. Matson has not paid any
rent and will not give up possession.
February last the doctor sold out to Mrs.
J. L. Fisher, and she immediately gave
Mrs, Matson notice to quit, but it had no
effect, and when Mrs. Fisher posted up
bills, "Rooms to rent." they were prompt
ly torn uown. Then she swore out a war
rant for the arrest of "John Doe" for
malicious mischief, but he has not yet
been found.
Tuesday evening a tenant went to take
possession of the rooms and employed two
men to help him in removing Mrs. Mat
son's furniture. A watchman employed
by Mrs. Matson was overpowered, so her
attorney alleges, and some of her erfects
were thrown out into the hallway, tone
complained to the police, but, as it was
a case for the civil courts, they ueclined
to interfere. Yesterday morning Mrs.
Matson swore tf> complaints for the arrest
of Dr. Rea, Mrs. Fisher, Frank Has
kell and C. F. Repen on a charge of forci
ble entry and detainer. They were ar
rested and released on cash bail. Now a
warrant will be sworn out for the arrest
of Mrs. Matson on a charge of perjury
for swearing to the complaints against
Dr. Rea and Mrs. Fisher, as they were
not present at the time the effects were
removed.

Madame,
It's just a question of taste
every day we advertise new arrivals â our windows show them â but we must leave the choice to you. You know as
well as we do there's an air of refinement about lady's wear which cannot be defined in words â but a well-dressed
woman is the center of attraction â anywhere ! It is not due to the cost â nor the pattern â a costume may have
nine good points and be marred by one defect â but we show you day by day the newest fabrics for ladies' wear.
Our store is so close to you â we're as good as neighbors â it's easy to see our stock without saying one word to us.
And there's one point you can rely upon â we can sell better goods at closer figures than our competitors. There's a
why and a wherefore for this, but it's so â it shall be so. Six huge stores of Hale's in California have grown by the
generous patronage of the people, and we know of no better time than Glorious Springtime to mention this ; and
in mentioning â to thank you.

ANNA'S FINERY
IS THREATENED
Attachment Out Against Mile.
Held for a Laundry
Bill.
Sued for $8 95 for Cleaning Various
Articles of Apparel, Including
Hosiery and Gloves.
Anna Heldâ the star of the milky way
âIs in distress and unless some one of her
devoted admirers comes to her assistance
Anna may have to divorce â  herself from
some of her American dollars. Not many
of them, but enough to cause her a severe
spasm of anguish, for Anna loves the
American dollar five times better than
she does the franc of her native land and
a hundredfold more \ than the most rav
ored of her devotees.
Who among the throngs who watched
the entrancing Parisenne pirouette about
the stage of the Baldwin, lavishing her
smiles upon all with distracting impar
tiality, would have imagined she was the
victim of a remorseless creditor?
/ But such was the case, and although
Anna has bidden farewell to the Golden
Gate and has got as far as Oakland on
her return : east, she /is still â¢ pursued by
the haunting fear that she will have to
yield up $8 95 with a few dollars addi
tional for costs, etc. , - -
And it looks as though Anna's fears
were not without cause, for Anna has
been sued; sued for $8 95 for the cleaning
of her clothes.
Norah Clifford and C. L. Snow, com
prising the firm of John F. Snow & Co.,
are the people who are making life a
burden for the divine Held. In a com
plaint filed in the Justice Court yester
day they allege that on the 4th of the
present month they entered Into an agree
ment with the Queen of Vaudeville
whereby they were to . renovate certain
articles of wearing apparel enumerated
as follows: One satin dress, one pair of
tights (quality not stated), three pairs of
silk hose, - one hat. three feathers, three
pairs of shoes and fifteen pairs of gloves,
said lot to be duly scrubbed, laundered,
etc., for the sum of $8 95. This, according
to -the complaint, was satisfactory to the
defendant, ; and the refurbishing orocess
was properly * performed and the articles
returned to their owner on, April 10, but
she ; then . and ' has ' since persistently . re
fused to pay the bill, although repeatedly
asked to do so. 'â '>'_ * -.- . â :
As Anna has completed her engagement
here and last night was in Oakland, steps
were taken to make a forcible levy on her
goods and chattels, and for that purpose
an attachment was taken out. both here
and in Oakland. The plaintiffs are de
termined, and Anna will have- to skip
around very smoothly to prevent the
officers: from getting nola of ncr effects..
OAKLAND, April Anna Held caused
the police^, and Sheriff's office a lively
chase to-nieht. About 7 o'clock a Mr.
Sabin, representing ; the Bushnell Photo
graph Gallery, appeared at the police sta
tion and told Captain Carson of his woes.
He said his firm had loaned the Held
company while in San Francisco a valua
ble picture, and they had gone off with it.
He i asked for a \ warrant for : petty lar
ceny or anything that would recover the
picture. % This could not be issued, as Miss
Held's manager. Siegfried, said the tak
ing of the picture was a mistake and that
if < the ; photograph man . went to . the prop
erty car in West Oakland he could get it.
The car i was visited, but no picture was
found and it ; was learned that it is in a
car that is now supposed to be near Salt
Lake.- This ended that Incident. V -,
<t> About the same *:â¢ time Deputy Sheriff
O'Callaghan from San Francisco appeared
at: the Sheriff's ; office: with a summons
authorizing the ; attachment of Anna
Held's property for the sum of $8 90 for a
dye concern in San Francisco. The claim
was in ' the name of Norah Cliff i . The
summons ,was served on the actress and a
visits was - made to i the railroad yards > to
attach a few dollars' worth of the actress',
property , that so many columns have been
written about. . V ,
- The â ', manager . calmly, told . the deputy
that everything belonged to him; that not
a gem 1 or a stitch "of ; clothing I was the
property, of Miss Held, and the officer had
to return with no satisfaction. ;,

ECONOMIZING.
Three Minor Roads Ab
sorbed Into the South
ern Pacific.
ThÂ© Papers Placed on File In
the Office of the County
Clerk.
Stated to Be a Move to Save Expenses
in the Management Of
the Road*.
Another step toward greater economy
In the affairs of the Southern Pacific
Company was taken yesterday. This
was the formal consolidation of four
of the lessee roads of that corpora
tion. Speaking of the matter, Collls P.
Huntinpton said:
We consolidated the Southern Pacific Rail
road Company, the Northern Railway Company
the Northern California Railway Company and
the California Paoitlc Railroad Company as a
measure of economy. We always do these
things as fast as we can, because they save
considerable expense In several ways. This la
done In connection with all the little roads that
come into our possession. We did it with the
6tockton and Copperopolls. Before we got It
It did not pay expenses. After we secured I
think we even reduced rates on It. and then
we made It pay interest on half it cost. We
consolidated it and reduced expenses by that
move. That is the only way these little road*
can be made to live.
The papers were filed last evening In
the County Clerk's office. They pro-
Vide for the consolidation, amalgama
tion and incorporation of the Southern
Pacilic Railroad Company, the North
ern Railway Company, the Northern
California Railway Company and the
California Pacific Railroad Company.
The new corporation is to be known as
the Southern Pacific Railroad Com
pany. The several capital stocks, debts,
properties, assets and franchises, it is
further provided, held, owned or pos
sessed by the interested corporations

In the new corporation.
The directors of the new Southern Pa
cific Railroad Company are C. P. Hunt,
ington. New York; T. H. Hubbard, New
York; George Crocker, C. E. Green,
Charles G. Lathrop and H. E. Hunt,
ington of San Francisco; P. S. Douty,
San Mateo; Russell Wilson, San Fran
cisco, and N. T. Smith, San Carlos.
The roads and branches included in
the amalgamation cover 4535 58-100
miles, and the capital stock is fixed at
$12fU.">5,000.
The articles of incorporation are
signed by C. P. Huntingdon, president,
and J. H. Willcutt, of the Southern Pa

TUB WAJtM SPELL BROKEN.
It Will Be Cooler To-Day Except In
the Northern Part of the State
With Heavy Fogs on Coast.
Am predicted by Forecaster McAdie of
the Weather Bureau there was the anti
cipated change In the weather yesterday
afternoon. The atmosphere began to cool
most perceptibly about 5 o'clock, and by
S it was disagreeably cold, with a heavy
fop rolling in from the sea. The maximum
temperature was higher yesterday than
on Tuesday, but the mean temperature
was less.
The temperature has fallen rapidly
along the Central Pacific Coast, but it
continues high in the valleys, where it
is 10 to 25 degrees above normal. With
the exception of a slight trace of rain at
Port Angeles there has none fallen upon
the Pacific Slope. It will be cooler to-day
except in the northern part of the State,
with heavy fogs along the coast.
The Printers' Strike.
The printers and Typothetae have fairly
locked horns, and each stands quiet wait
ing for the other to make the first move.
There was no change in the situation yes
terday beyond the usual statements from
the proprietors that they have plenty of
competent men ai.d the refutation of this
by the officers of the union. Beyond the
pending out of circulars and pamphlets
giving the "true status of the case" by
hoth sides, hardly anything has been done
toward arriving at a settlement of the
difficulties, and it now looks as though
the strike will drag on for an indefinite
length of time. A full meeting of the
Typothetae will be held this afternoon to
consider the situation.

Now that Judge de Haven has handed
down a decision to the effect that the

of the labor unions will be used to fight
the case to the end. At the meeting of
the Carpenters' District Council last night
the matter was brought up for discussion
and much satisfaction was expressed re
garding the decision. The business agent
of the council, Harry M. Kaunders, was
authorized to spare no expense to prose

a penalty for each day of its violation

Council and the Labor Council has charge
Of ttio matter and a meeting of this com
mit tc-e will be held to-morrow evening
to lay down ;i definite course of action.
An apgressive campaign will be opened
immediately against not only the Keh;o

A vote of thanks was tendered Messrs.

THE EVICTION OF HUNG HI LOI
The Sheriffs Deputies Surprised the Chinan)en and
Threw the People's Clothes Ir)to the Street.
THE majesty of the law in the person
of six of the Sheriff's deputies, headed
by Officer Jesse Galland, descended
upon the laundry of Hung Hi Loi, 537
Central avenue, yesterday and proceeded
to take swift and merciless vengeance
upon the almond-eyed citizen of the
Orient because of his failure to meet a
rent bill of $45 due to Samuel W. Cowles.
Judgment was secured in the case April
5, against Hung Hi Loi and his partner,
Hung Wah, and a few days ago they were
notified to pay up or get out, but when
the notice was served. Hung declared
that "he no savez," and refused to leave.
It lacked but a few minutes to the hour
of noon when the deputies stepped from
a Hayes-street car at the corner of Cen
tral avenue, and with noiseless tread pro
ceeded to steal unawares upon the laun
dry and the unsuspecting Hung Hi Loi.
When they entered the establishment of
the washtub and iron they found neither
Hung nor his partner. They had evidently
got the tip of the impending trouble and
had silently decamped. However, the
deputies surprised six stoical Chinamen,
who were busy putting imitation mirror
gloss upon six 99-cent shirts. The en
trance of the visitors did not in the least
disturb the complacency of the yellow
laundrymen.
"Where is the boss?" asked the head
deputy.
"Chow la moo wah ki," answered a
dried-up, wean.-eyed and shriveled-faced
old Oriental, who was laboring with the

and the rooms of the institution were
crowded. During the entertainment Dr.
J. H. Stallard, one of the directors of the
pilyclinic, announced that Mrs. Phebe
Hearst had decided to donate $5000 toward
helping the institution carry on its char
itable work.
Since the organization of the polyclinic
hundreds of the sick poor of the city have
been treated by many of the most skilled
physicians in the State free of charge.
Medicines hava been given to those un
able to pay for them, and in every wav
the instjtution has done much to alleviate
the suffering of the unfortunates of the
city. The expenses of carrying on the
polyclinic are consderable, and much of
it is borne by the physicians who gratui
tously give their services as well. Charity
is looked upon to maintain the institution,
and the donation of Mrs. Hearst came
when it was a welcome gift. About three
years ago Mrs. Hearst assisted the poly
clinic by a similar gift.
SHORT TWO THOUSAND
The Charge That Has Been Placed
Against L. C. Watters of the
Commercial Power Company.
L. C. Watters was arrested yesterday
on complaint of his employer, I. C. Bor
den of the Commercial Steam Power
Works at 506 Commercial street. The
charge is embezzlement, and tnis may be
raised to felony embezzlement before he
comes to trial. The amount which it is
charged he is short is over $3000, and the
time it took to accumulate that amount
of shortage stretches over several
months.
Watters was collector and confidential
clerk to the firm for nearly four years,
and he was trusted with all of the busi
ness of the firm in the absence of Mr.
Borden. A few months ago It was
found that a bill had been presented and
that there was not sufficient money in
the hands of Watters to pay it, when at
the time there should have been enough
to pay a dozen like it. An investigation
followed and an explanation was de
manded, and as It was not satisfactory
the arrest of Watters was decided upon
It was found that there had been num
bers of bills paid by checks which had
been cashed at various placesâ at sa
loons and business houses where Watters
owed moneyâ and no accounting had
ever been made of the money they repre
sented. About a month ago Watters left
his position, and it was after that that
most of the discrepancies were made
plain.
Watters had always borne a good rep
utation and his arrest was the cause of
much surprise among his acquaintances.
He has a wife and lives at 2615 Sacra
mento street. When accused of the em
bezzlement he declared that the only way
It could have occurred waÃ by dishonesty

roared the deputy. "What do you think
I am. a traveling" lexicon of buried lan
guages that I can understand that
tongue-twisting jargon? What I want to
know is where is the boss, and 1 want to
know it mighty quick."
Here the deputy pulled off his coat, and
his men taking the hint shucked out of
theirs. As soon as the Chinamen caught
sight of the badges upon the vests of the
deputies they quit work as if they had
been struck by lightning, and at a Bignal
from a little, fat washer who was stirring
a tub of soapsuds they all started up with
a high falsetto of protestations. The com
bination of their shrill, piping voices
sounded like the filing of a rusty saw.
while ever and anon above the ear-pierc
ing chatter there arose the voice of the
old man. who. dancing around upon one
leg and waving his arms above his head,
shouted "Me no bosseâ he gone, me no
br.sseâ he gone."
The deputies "said not a word but went
straight to work," and without ceremo.iy
began to deposit the wash of the entire
community in the street. The red-hot
stove held them at bay until they could
get a hose to play upon it, and then the
work continued. Tables, chairs, tubs,
irons and all the paraphernalia of the
laundry were dumped out upon the pave
ment and piled into a confused and
heterogeneous pyramid.
While this was going on the Chinamen
were busy gathering together their per
sonal belongings. The shriveled patriarch
quickly secured his pipe and faded yellow
jacket, and his fellow-laborers were not
Ed in the office with him. There has
been no suspicion attached to his assist
ant, however, for the officers of the com
pany have thoroughly inevstigated the
whole affair and have no one to suspect
but Watters. Watters declares he is in
nocent.

LAWYERS IN DISGRACE.
Proceedings to Disbar Attorneys B.
Mclntosh and E. B. Haymond.
Benjamin Mclntosh and Edgar B. Hay
mond, the two lawyers who were recently
found guilty of unprofessional conduct by
Superior Judge Carroll Cook, have been
cast out by the Bar Association of San
Francisco. The offense for which they
stand condemned was committed during
the trial of Albert Hoff, the murderer
These lawyers conducted his case as his
counsel and during the proceedings they
attempted to soil an alleged confession
of the murderer to the newspapers, ask
ing the sum of $2000. Judge Cook com
mitted both lawyers for contempt, and at
the same time suggested that they should
bo brought before the Bar Association for
disbarment. This organization took up
the matter and a decision was reached
against the accused, but Mclntosh asked
for more time, which was granted. When
the case again came up for hearing on
Tuesday evening he did not appear, and
the following resolution was passed:
Resolved, That - committee be forthwith ap
pointed to prosecute Attorneys Benjamin Mc
lntosh and Edgar B. Haymond before the Su
preme Court of the State of California, and
that the said committee, representing the Bar
Association of San Francisco, take all neces
par- steps toward bringing about their dis
barment.
The committee adopting this resolution
consisted of Chairman Michael Mullany
Secretary J. S. Tobln and Messrs. Fifield]
Kellogg and Louderback. The move to
disbar these two lawyers will be pre
sented to the Supreme Court on the evi
dence taken in the Superior Court.

slow to follow his example. Soon each
had a bundle, and this he took out upon
the street and sat thereon. Silent and
dumfounded, as it were, they watched
the wholesale work of destruction go on.
But when the people whose wearing ap
parel was thus being confused and mixed
with that of their neighbors got on to
what it was all about, then the fun com
menced. Mrs. O'Reily suddenly appeared
upon the scene and demanded the imme
diate surrender of two towels and one
bedspread. Mike Donahue was content to
pay 50 cents for his shirts and collars,
but when he went home and found that
in the confusion he had a bundle contain
ing a lot of female underwear, he re
turned boiling with rage, and shaking a
pair of unmentionables in the face of the
silent and bewildered Chinamen, he swore
to do damage to the faces of each and
every one of them if they did not find his
belongings.
First the people came by ones, then
twos, next a dozen -at a time and finally
with a rush. They were not to be reasoned
with. They wanted next week's wash,
and they attacked the pyramid in the
street to find it. In less time than it
takes to tell it there was a confused mass
of clotht-s. Chinamen, men, women and
children jumbled together in a confused,
struggling pile. Every one for himself
was the principle that governed the rush.
The patriarch dived beneath a pile of
blankets, but some one grabbed his queue
and hauled him forth. The scene resem
bled a bargain counter rush, and for
many blocks around there were strewn all
and every kind of wearing apparel used
to adorn the person of man or woman.
DONATIONS FOR
THE FESTIVAL
Masons Feel That Their Efforts
Will Be Rewarded With
Success.
Several Hundred Tickets Have Been
Sold and the Demand for
More Is Increasing.
Every indication points to the fact that
the coming fete by the Masons of this
city in aid of the Widows' and Orphans'
Home at Decoto, Alameda County, is
destined to meet with unprecedented
success. Donations are steadily increas
ing, both in number and extent, and
tickets are being sold rapidly and in fact
are disappearing like the proverbial hot
cakes.
The board of trustees assembled in the
temple yesterday for deliberation. Charles
L. Patton presided. Dr. Voorsanger, W.
Frank Pierce, Dr. Thomas Flint, Edwin
Whipple, Ed Peabody, William Johnson
and Ed Hines were present. It was re
ported that the Masonic Widows' and Or
phans' Home would be completed in Oc
tober. A resolution was passed asking the
lodges of the entire State to send in the
names of the widows and orphans whom
the various lodges desired to occupy the
"home" on its completion. It is expected
that at least seventy-five widows will be
accommodated in the early part of No-
vember.
W. Frank Pierce, inspector general of
the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite
of Freemasonry of the Southern Juris
diction of the United States, has just re
turned from Amador, Calaveras and San
Joaquin counties. He reports that the
Masons of these counties will take part
in the festival and will donate %'arious
articles to be sold. He says enthusiasm
prevails among the fraternity.
In looking over the donation books yes
terday it was discovered that the Califor
nia Furniture Company had donated
sums to a great many ladies. The ladies
of the Scottish Rite body met yesterday
in the temple and reported a great many
large donations. Several hundred, tickets
have been sold. One lady had secured a
complete tailor-made dress, hat, etc. Mrs.
J. R. Jones, Mrs. Henry Cline, Mrs. Shat
terly, Mrs. Starbird, Mrs. W. Thomas,
Mrs. Judge Caswell and Mrs. Hollis all
reported large donations.
The ladies of Mount Moriah Lodge as
sembled in the temple yesterday and
reached the conclusion that they would
have a Mount Moriah Washington booth.
Costumes will be the dress of Martha
Washington, and articles symbolic of
Washington and his life will be sold.
Mrs W. E. Boyer is the chairman and
Mrs. Guy Calden secretary. The Electric
Railway Advertising Company of Oak
land has donated space for advertising
purposes. _
Failure of L. G. Flanagan.
L. G. Flanagan, a dealer in hay and
grain on the corner of Folsom and Eight
eenth streets, filed a petition yesterday
to be declared an insolvent debtor. His
liabilities amount to 117,152 17, but are
mostly secured by mortgages on real
property holdings in Noe Valley and
Comerfordville.
THE BRUNSWICK
OPENS DEEP
A Complete Agreement
With the Comstock
Tunnel Company.
Possible Turning Point in the
Fortunes of the Famous
Old Camp.
Now Prospecting the Great Bruns
wick Lode Will Begin 1300
Feat Dowa
The famous, sleepy, old Comstock re
ceived yesterday the first definite injec
tion of the new life blood which all Com
stockers have an abiding faith is sure
to give the old camp a great resurrection
some day.
Late Tuesday afternoon Franklin
Leonard, president of the Comstock Tun
nel Company, and a number of the lead-
ing representatives of the Comstock com
panies interested in the Brunswick lode,
reached a complete agreement as to an
important contract, by the terms of which
these companies may and will go to pros
pecting the Brunswick lode from the
Comstock tunnel.
The agreement contains an enormous
mass of details. Briefly, it gives the con
tracting companies the right and every
facility to run prospecting drifts along
the lod<^ on each side of the tunnel and
to drairt their workings, haul out their
ore and waste rock and generally to op
erate their mines through the Comstock
Tunnel.
Where the tunnel passes through the
Brunswick lode it is about 1300 feet below
the surface, and several hundred feet
lower than the deepest shaft now on me
lode, that in the Chollar claim. The
prospecting work so far done on the
Brunswick lode has uPen done from the
surface wholly, and what little has been
done has not developed any ore bodies of
grpat importance.
Now prospecting can begin at a depth of
1300 feet and besides can be carried on on
a vastly cheaper scale than operations
from the surface. There is every promise
now that some of the companies will go
right to work running drifts north and
south from the level, and it sJiould not be
be very long before they show what the
Brunswick lode is made of and whether
or not the abounding faith in it which
fills Virginia City is justified.
The companies who become parties to
the agreement are the Gould & Curry,
Savage, Consolidated California & Vir
ginia. Best & Belcher, Hale & Norcross,
Chollar and Potosi. A perfect agreement
has be,en arrived at as far as the com
panies mentioned and President Leonard
are concerned. The agreement awaits
final ratification by the trustees of the
Comstock Tunnel Company in New York,
to whom it will be forwarded at once, and
also by the Union Trust Company of
New York, trustee for the income bond
holders. As President Leonard is the
heaviest holder of the stock and bonds
of the company, and has acted here in
accordance with a resolution adopted by
the trustees, this is looked upon as a for
mality which will be promptly attended
to on the arrival of the papers in New
York and reported by telegraph.
President Leonard last evening declined
to say more than to confirm the news in
a general way.
"I regard the agreement as one that
will be mutually beneficial to my com
pany and to the mining companies con
cerned, he said. "From their stand
point, it will greatly reduce the cost of
development. I have been laboring for
two years to bring this about, and I am
glad that it is about accomplished. It
is the only practicable and economical
way to prospect lode.
"When this matter is finally off our
hands, as I expect it will be with the
ratification by the trustees in New York,
the way will be opened for the other
waiting enterprisesâ the drainage of
American Flat and Silver City through
the Comstock tunnel. It is too early to
say more about these projects than that
they may now come actively to the front
To them this enterprise of the Bruns
wick Lode has been a stumbling-block
which is now removed."
Comstockers will be delighted to know
that there is at least a definite prospect
of deep operations on the Brunswick lode
with all its possibilities of success and
failure, and its possible bearing on the re
sumption of deep mining on the Com
stock, the 8000-foot tunnel to Silver City
and the 8000-foot tunnel which may yet
allow mining to be resumed in tne rich
but wet veins of American Flat. This
final reaching of an agreement is regard
ed as a turning point in the fortunes of
the Comstock.
BEATEN BY HIS WIFE.
G^orge Wense, a Cook, Has His In
juries Attended to at the
Hospital.
George Wense, a cook living at 115
Seventh street, had a dispute with his
wife yesterday morning. The woman had
been drinking, am. in her rage she picked
up a pair of scissors and attempted to
stab him. He warded off the blow and
in doing so hit ...~i in the jaw.
Throwing away t..e scissors she went
at him like a tigress and knocked him
down with a blr v on the left eye. Then
she jumped on him and banged" his head
against the floor, almost severing his
right ear. She continued to strike and
kick him till she became exhausted and
left him in a semi-conscious condition. As
soon as he was a.-o Wense went to the
Receiving Hospital, where his injuries
were attended to by Dr. Rinne. He pre
sented a pitiable Sight with his discolored
eye and lacerated ear. He declined to
have his wife arrasted, as he said when
she got sober she would feel sorry for
what she had done.

ARTICLE XII.
ACQUISITION OP PUBLIC UTIL
ITIES.
It is hereby declared to be the pur
pose and intention of the people of the
City and County that its public utilities
shall be gradually acquired and ulti
mately owned by the City and County.
To this end it is hereby ordained:
SECTION L Within one year from
the date upon which this Charter shall
I go into effect, and at least every two
! years thereafter until the object ex
pressed in this provision shall have
been fully attained, the Supervisors
must procure through the City Engi
neer plans and estimates of the actual
cost of the original construction and
completion by the City and County of
water works, gas works, electric light
works, steam, water or electric power
works, telephone lines, street railroads
and such other public utilities as the
Supervisors or the people by petition to
the Board may designate.
In securing estimates of the original
cost of the construction and completion
of water works by the City and County,
the Supervisors must procure and place
on file plans and estimates of the cost
of obtaining from all of the several
available sources a sufficient and per
manent supply of good, pure water for
the City and County, in order that
propositions for the acquisition, con-
Btruction and completion thereof, and
the incurring of municipal indebtedness
therefor, may be submitted to the elec
tors of the City and County as herein
after set forth.
Sec. 2. After such plans and esti
mates shall have been procured and
filed, the Supervisors shall, at as early
a date as they may deem for the best
interests of the City and County, enter
into negotiations for the permanent ac
quisition by the City and County, by
original construction, condemnation or
purchase of such or any of said
public utilities as they may regard
most important to the City and County
to be first acquired, and to formulate
and submit to the electors of the City
and County, at a special election, prop
| ositions for the permanent acquisition
and ownership thereof.
Before submitting propositions to
the electors for the acquisition by orig
inal construction or condemnation, of
public utilities, the Supervisors must
solicit and consider offers for the sala
to the City and County of existing util
ities in order that the electors shall
have the benefit of acquiring the same
at the lowest possible cost thereof.
Sec. 3. When a petition or petitions
signed by electors of the City and
County equal in number to fifteen per
centum of all the votes cast at the last
preceding general election shall be pre
sented to the Supervisors, setting forth
that the signers thereof favor the ac
quisition by the City and County of any
public utility, and requesting tho
Board to prepare for submission to the
i electors of the City and County, as
| hereinafter provided, a proposition for
the acquisition of such utility, it shall
be the duty of the Board to immediate
ly take such steps or to enter into such
negotiations as will enable It to formu
late such a proposition for submission
to the electors as aforesaid. Such prop
osition shall be so formulated and com
pleted within six months from the date
of the filing of such petition. The Clerk
of the Supervisors must, immediately
upon the filing of the aforesaid petition
or petitions, after examining and veri
fying the signatures thereto, transmit
an authenticated copy thereof, without
the signatures, to the Board of Election
Commissioners, and another such copy
to the Mayor, together with a certifi
cate that the required number of signa
tures are appended to the original. ThÂ©
Mayor shall alro have the right to for
mulate and submit to the electors &
separate proposition from that formu
lated by the Supervisors for the acqui
sition of the utility named In said peti
tion. At the next municipal election af
ter the formulation of such proposi
tions by the Supervisors and the May
or, the Board of Election Commission
ers shall submit to the electors the two
alternative propositions. The proposi
tion receiving a majority of the votes
cast thereon shall be adopted; but in
case the votes cast in favor of bothpropositions shall not exceed one-half
the total number of votes cast thereon,
both propositions shall bo deemed re-
Nothing la this section shall be so
construed as to prohibit the Supervis
ors from responding to the aforesaid
petition of the electors requesting the
acquisition of any public utility by pro
ceeding at once, without the submission
of propositions to the electors as afore
said, to pass an ordinance declaring its
determination to acquire the same as
provided in section six of this Article
and from proceeding thereafter to ac
quire the same in the manner herein
after provided.
Sea 4. In case the cost of any public
utility sought to be acquired under the j
provisions of this Article, oan be paid \

be lawful to acquire the name by a ma- j
jority vote of the electors voting there- ,
on at any special election. In submit- ;
ting propositions to the electors for ,
such acquisition the Supervisors shall
specify in such proposition the cost of
the public utility, the proposed method
and manner of payment therefor, and
submit to the electors the question
whether the same shall be acquired â 
upon such terms. \
In case, however, the cost of such
public utility sought to be acquired
under the provisions of this Article
shall so far exceed the annual revenues
Of the City and County, in addition to ,
the other necessary expenditures there
of, as to render it necessary to incur a .
municipal bonded indebtedness for such j
purpose, then the Supervisors, in sub- ;
mittlng propositions to the electors for j
the acquisition thereof, shall specify |
therein the amount of the proposed â 
bonded indebtedness, the rate of inter- !
est thereon, and whether such bonded
Indebtedness shall be incurred. At
least two-thirds of the electors voting
thereon at such election shall be neces- j
Bary to secure such acquisition and to
warrant the issuance of municipal
bonds therefor, as hereinafter eet forth.
Sec. 5. When the electors by vote J
shall have determined, as hereinbefore
set forth, to acquire any public utility, |
such action on the part of the electors ;
Khali be equivalent to the passing of
the ordinance by the Supervisors de
claring such determination as set forth
In section six of this Article, and the i
Supervisors shall proceed without de
lay to pass an ordinance calling a .
special election as required by section !
seven of this Article.
Sec. 6. When the Supervisors shall de- j
termlne that the public interest or ne
cessity demands the acquisition, con
struction or completion of any public |
utility, the cost of which will be too
great to be paid out of the ordinary an- j
nual Income and revenue of the City and j
County, the Supervisors shall, by or- i
dinance, specifically declare such de- I
termination, and shall publish the same j
for at least two weeks in the official
newspaper.
Sec. 7. At the next regular meeting of \
the Supervisors after the publication of |
the ordinance declaring said deter- I
mlnation as above set forth, or at an j
adjourned meeting thereof, or not less
than two weeks nor more than four
weeks after the electors by vote 6hall i
nave determined to acquire any public
utility, the Supervisors by ordinance
phall call a special election, at which
shall be submitted to the electors the
proposition of acquiring such public
utility, and of incurring a debt for the
acquisition of the same as set forth in
such ordinance. No question other
than the acquisition of such utility and
the incurring of the indebtedness
therefor shall be submitted at such
election.
Sec. 8. The ordinance calling such
special election shall recite the objects
and purposes for which the Indebted
ness is proposed to be incurred, the es
timated cost of the pro-posed public
utility, the necessity for the acquisition
of the same, and that bonds of the City
and County shall issue for the payment
of the cost of the same as in such or
dinance set forth (if the proposition be
accepted by the electors), and shall fix

shall be held, the manner of holding
puch election, and the manner of voting

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. â¢ April 13.-Net losses ranging
from two to five points in the active leaders
of speculation, an animated close to the day's
trading, with almost the bottom ltvel of the
day, and heavy blocks of securities offering for
sale were the features of to-day's market. The
point of order In the Senate, which sent the
consideration of the Cuban resolution over a
day, rallied the market slightly, but all re
ports from Washington Indicated that,
though there might be delay, there was little
doubt that the ultimate action of Congress
would be such as would necessarily constitute
casus belli by repudiating Spanish sovereignty
In Cuba. The Spanish 4 per cent bonds w-i>Â»
without support at any of the European cen
ters, and the heavy tone of Americans hel.ied
the growing belief in war. The early weakness
on the local exchange was due in great part
to liquidation of foreign account in American
securities. Sales of all the International stocks
for London account were more urgent than at
any time since the Cuban question his beÂ°n
at issue There was not much added pressure
of local liquidation In the early trading. It is
not improbable that the large selling for Lon
don account was influenced by the money mar
ket's condition In London. The open market
rate for call money there has been raised to
about the bank rale ot 4 per cent. Berlin dis
count has vi-, risen to i-, per cent, compared
with the bank rate of 4 per cent, and money
hardened appreciably in Paris to-day. With
call money In the local market responding with
a rise to 4. per cent, there Is no diminution in
the pressure in foreign centers for gold to shin
to New York. It is the expectation in WaU
street that the Bank of England will raise the
rate of its discount to 6 per cent should war
be declared between the United State* oiui
Spain. With large Blocks of exchange in New
York still to be drawn upon this condition Jf
affairs might easily have been the impelilni
cause for Tendon selling of American scour*
ties In an effort to ameliorate the exchange
condition; There were some very heavy hold"
ings thrown over in the final dill" i to-day"

LONDON MARKET.
NETW YORK, April 13.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here remained stagnant to-day, becom
ing disordered by the war rumors. Cottangoes
were higher, because of dearer money, those on
Americans being o'JfoMi per cent.
Americans appeared steady and continued so
until there was a sharp fall In Spanish 4's,
which wiis connected with selling from Spain.
Americans gave way In sympathy and all the
market became dull, closing only a fraction
above the lowest.
There were wild rumors at the close. Includ
ing that the cable between Havana and Key
We?t had been cut. Consols and other gilt
edge stocks contlue to call on dear money.
There Is no likelihood of further rise In the
Hank of England to-morrow, unless war should
be declared or New York should engage a
very heavy account of gold.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, April -Everything in wheat
was strong at the opening. Even May, which
has been only nominal of late, exhibited a
great deal of activity, and on that fact was
the . feature of the early trading. ThÂ» most
prominent factor in the strength was undoubt
edly the gravity of the reports from ashing
ton Another factor was the knowledge which
leaked l out before trading f, commenced that
loiter had received acceptances from abroad
of a" the wheat he had offered the previous
afternoon on prices based on yesterdays ad
vance This quantity was put by Letter at
about 700,000 bushels, and this show of deter
mination of foreigners to get all the wheat
ahead of actual hostilities Â«â¢f^ Â« enu a ln '
anxiety among shorts,* big and little and
started them to covering as soon as trading
C Â°MayTtaried . at $1 08 and advanced at once
to Â»1 09%. the highest point yet reached In
that option Loiter soon took advantage of
he bulge and disposed, of large quantities
through brokers, and the price eased off to
Jl 08 The bIK trading, however, was done In
July All classes of buyers came into the mar
ket but offerings were decidedly limited until
the price got up to 86% c. This was above
ca?l figures and free selling by t holders or
those privileges, with extensive realizations by
the B tra!ders, caused a little soften Ing of pricey
Tulv fretting back to S6>h,c. But about 11.30
o-cl^ck the innuence of the Washington news
was augmented by more sensational news re
garding the California crop. Before 12 o clock
the buying had become larger than before, and
as the session wore on it became practically a
bramble among shorts to cover. Ordinary
news of the day cut little figure, everything
else being overshadowed by the war news and
Letter^ big cash sales. Continental markets
were firmer and higher. Northwest receipts
were small, 142 car*, against 253 last week and
294 a year ago. Chicago receipts were ,1 cars.
The addition to contract stocks to-day amount
ed to about 118,000 bushels. Clearances were
rather light The Letter Interests sold largely
of May and also of July right up to the close
but even these offerings were not sufficient to
fit isfvthe demand and a few minutes from
the end of the â¢*slon July was bid up to 88% c.
The market then reacted. atW
r,,â¢ was rather draggy at first, but at noon
the market began to respond to the Jump in
"^^ZXe^*^. the firmness
being diTe principally to the wheat advance.
â Provision-! early, were easy on a break. in hog
prices and the market dragged until noon At

Attempts to Create a

His Scheme to Divide the

Row Over the Appointment of
a Head to the Evening Busi

â¢
RAGAN'S FRIEND JORDAN.
Resolution to Promote Vice- Principal
Folkes Bitterly OpposedâHam
mond's Patriotism.
Resolved, That the two outside
classes connected with the Richmond
School be called the Jackson School,
and that Miss Sophia A. Grote be
elected principal of the said Jackson
School and transferred thereto from
the Golden Gate School.
SAM L. WALLER,
PHIL HAMMOND,
DR. D. F. RAGAN,
DR. GEORGE S. DRUCKER,
T. R. CAREW.
T. A. BURNS.
That little resolution caused a wild
time in the Board of Education yester
day, and was only defeated because
Waller and the other signers could not
pet another member to stand in with
thorn.
"When the resolution was read Head
attacked it in vigorous terms as en
tirely unwarranted and intended only
to advance Miss Grote. He said the
residents of the Richmond District
were clamoring; for a new school build
ing which waa also an absolute neces
sity, and that the two classes which
are now quartered in buildings in !ose
proximity to the Richmond School
would all be under one roof, but Miss
Grote, having been made a principal,
could not be reduced again, and would
have to be provided for somewhere else.
He asked if Superintendent Webster
approved the plan.
Mr. Webster replied that he had
never heard of it bof<>re and certainly
did not approve cf it.
Waller and Drucker attempted to de
fend the proposition, and President
Barrington called Carew to the chair
while he took the floor in opposition to
it. Gallagher also opposed it a.s a jab,
and the motion was lost, the six sign
er? voting in favor of it.
The next fight occurred just prior to
adjournment, and it looked for a mo
ment as though Waller and Head might
"mix matters." During the executive
session of the committee of the whole
an effort was made to reach an agree
ment in regard to appointing a prin
cipal of the Evening Business School.
vice Kilpatrick, removed. Head and
others wanted to promote Vice-Prin
cipal Folkes, but Ragan as usual had
a man for the place, Mr. Jordan, a
teacher in the Washington Grammar
School. After wrangling till nearly 5
k the committee adjourned and
the regular session began. After the reg
ular business had been disposed of Ra
pan left the meeting, but as a motion to
adjourn was made, a resolution was
passed up appointing Folkes to the
place. Hammond moved to substitute
the name of Jordan and the fight was
on. Carew became all tangled up in
parliamentary laws, and Waller
seemed to run things about as he
pleased, having entered the fight in Jor
dan's behalf. His language to Head
was noticeably bittf-r, and once when
he drew near in a boisterous manner
Head said: "Oh, don't get so close to
me; I don't want tn be contaminated."
Then Waller calmed down somewhat.
A vote was finally taken, resulting in
six for Folkes and five for Jordan. As
it required a majority of the board thÂ«
matter went over till the next meet-
ing.
Hammond afforded much amusement
by moving that Ppanish should no
longer be taught in the public schools
Th' re was no second to the motion.
THE UNLUCKY CORONA IN FLAMES.
SEVERELY DAMAGED LAST EVENING AFTER A ROUGH VOYAGE,
The Pacific Coast Steamship Com
pany's unlucky steamer Corona, which
was towed into this port last Tuesday
in a disabled condition, was partially
destroyed by fire last evening, and but
for the heroic efforts of the firemen who
responded to an alarm from box 354
early last evening, and those employed
on the fire tug Governor Markham, the
ship would have been burned to the
water's edge. About 7 o'clock flames
were seen issuing, from the ship, and
within a few minutes < it ' looked as
though the vessel, as well as the

Drucker's resolution, providing that
leave of absence be granted to all
teachers who enlisted for the war, and
that tfrey be given their positions back
upon their return, met with a better
fate and was passed, Riigaii being ex
cused from voting.
The muddle over the building of the
Mission High School was taken notice
of in the form of a resolution calling
on the Rae Building Company to com
plete its contract and in case no steps
were taken in that direction in three
days the board would finish the work
and deduct the cost from the contract.
Ragan's resolution placing teachers
whose classes were consolidated on the
substitute list was referred to the com
mittee of the whole.
Resolutions were passed as follows:
Instructing Architect Welch to prepare
plans and specifications of the repairs
necessary on the Girls' High School
building, by reason of the recent earth
quake, and instructing the secretary to
advertise for bids for the same; recom
mending the assignment of Mrs. M.
Cashman as special teacher of sewing
in the Franklin Grammar School; that
A. H. Cooke be transferred from the
Girls' High School to the Polytechnic
and Mission High schools; that the
Lowell High School be placed at the
service of the Board of Examiners, of
the Civil Service Commission, on May

the captain nor any member of the
crew except the watchman was
on deck, and In consequence the cause
of the blaze has not been determined,
but it is supposed that a spark from
the donkey engine, which had been run
ning during the day for the purpose of
hoisting coal aboard, had fallen into
some inflammable matter, which caused
the conflagration. It was at first deter
mined to take the burning ship away

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 14, 1898.
HUNTINGTON
MUST TELL
THE TRUTH
The Southern Pacific
Company to Be
Investigated.
The Railroad Commis
sioners Decide to Look
Into Its Books.
A Resolution Introduced by
Commissioner La Rue That
Will Cause Some Fun.
RATES TO BE ADJUSTED.
Each of thÂ« Twenty-Seven Roads in
the State Must Show Its Finan
cial Condition.
The Railroad Commission has resolved
to do or die. It will make one last effort
to regulate the freight and passenger
rates of the roads doing business in the
State, and, if its attempt proves futile,
the members of the commission say there
Is no reason why they should continue to
exist as a body that would be a commis
sion in name only.
When the regular meeting of the board
was held yesterday afternoon in its rooms
in the Chronicle building the first matter
to be taken up was a complaint received
from E. L. Merihew of Los Angeles, in
which he stated that he had been charge!
$3 30 for a stop-over ticket from Oakland
to Sacramento, though he understood
that the rate, as fixed by the board,
should have only amounted to $2 50 for
that distance. A letter from J. C. Stubbs,
showing that Merihew had only been
charged the legal rate, as fixed by the
commission in ISS7, was received, read and
found to be correct and the complaint
was dismissed.
After the complaint had been dismissed
Commissioner La Hue arose and sprung
the sensation of the afternoon in the form
of a resolution which, in its preamDle, re
cites the action of the board in Septem
ber, 1*95, when it reduced the grain :ates
over the Southern Pacific 8 per cent, and
the appeal of that company to the Fede
ral Courts to annul the order, and the
decision of the United States Supreme
Court, in a Nebraska case, to the effect
that Railroad Commissioners had no power
to reduce rates until the earnings of tht
road were thoroughly established and
made known.
The resolution goes on to rehearse tne
action of the Circuit Court 01 the North
ern District of California granting a tem
porary restraining order preventing the
commission from adopting or attempting
to enforce any schedule of rates that
should tend to reduce the charges collect
ed before the attempted 8 per cent reduc
tion and the subsequent decision of Judge
McKenna on November 30, 1896, whereoy
the first part of the restraining order was
continued in force and the lauer part dis
solved, thus allowing the commission the
power to make a reduction in rates, sub
ject to a review by a competent court, af
ter the earnings of the road have been
satisfactorily established by competent
authority.
In accordance with this latter decision
the resolution orders the officers of the
Southern Pacific Company and all of Its
leased lines t o appear before the Board
of Railroad commissioners on May 11 and
give testimony and data that will enable
the board to determine the cost of con
struction, me amount of improvements,
the value of the roads, stocks and bonds,
the present as compared with the original
cost of construction, the sum necessary
for operating expenses and the earning
capacity of the road under the freight
and passenger rates fixed by law; also the
fixed charges of all railroads and other
transportation companies owned, leased
and operated by the Southern Pacific.
The officers of the other ro _s in Cali
fornia, twenty-six in number, are caJled
upon to appear before the board on June
8 and give similar information concerning
their several lines.
This resolution means all the roads
operating in California, and the Southern
Pacific in particular, will be obliged to
appear before the Railroad Commissioners
and subject themselves to an investiga
tion such as has not been held since tney
sprang into existence, and, if the result
of the investigation show that their earn
ings warrant such action, the rates on
freight and passenger traffic will be so
reduced as to make them comply with the
provisions of the law.
All the Commissioners are heartily in
favor of the action proposed by the reso
lution. They say that the powers of the
board have been so abrogated in one
way and another that it can practically
accomplish nothing for the benefit of the
played into the hold the flames were
under control. The fire wa* confined
principally to the hold of the vessel,
but the decks and rooms were badly
burned in places. The damage has not
yet been estimated, but it is presumed
it will reach somewhere in the neigh
borhood of $12,000. It is reported that
the loss will be almost entirely covered
by insurance. During the fiercest por
tion of the fire the bay was lit up for
quite a distance and a large crowd
gathered at the scene to witness what
might have resulted in an exceedingly
disastrous blaze.
people of the State, and that it is high
time that the whole matter be brought to
the attention of the courts ajid be defi
nitely settled either one way or another.
If the Southern Pacific is allowed to do
practically as it pleases and the Railroad
Commission has no power to interfere in
any way whatsoever, then, say the Com
missioners, the board is a useless insti
tution and might just as well pass out of
existence.
The resolution passed without a dissent
ing voice.
WILL FIGHT FOR
THEIR MACHINES.
Cigar-Dealers and Saloon Men Say-
That Devany's Order Is Not
in Good Faith.
The License Committee of the Board of
Supervisors met yesterday and, at the
request of a number of cigar-dealers and j
saloon men. deferred action on Devany's
order prohibiting nickel-in-the-slot ma- !
chines in use by them which pay winners
in drinks or cigars. The parties interest
ed intend to make a hard fight against the !
order, and yesterday, being collection day, '
they were unable to present their case be
fore the committee.
There is a feelin among some of themâ
and they do not hesitate to express their \
convictionâ that the order is not made In |
good faith, but is merely intended to
force those affected into raising a fund to :
defeat it. It is c.ed in support of this
theory that if the police were really de- j
slrous of suppressing the actual gambling |
machines, such that do not give any re- i
turn for the investment except by chance,
they would raid the machines that are 'â 
maintained in many places that pay win
ners in money. There are several varieties
of these, none o. which is licensed, but
which have come into use since Judge.
Cook's decision. They are gambling de
vices pure and simple, and are now under j
the ban of the law in that they are ex
pressly prohibiteu from being licensed, but I
the police allow them to be operated with- '
out molestation. License Collector Bon
net recently ordered his deputies to fur
nish him the names of people maintain
ing such machines, ajid he now has a list
of seventy-four money-paying machines
in operation in town.

The boss of the repair department in a Massachusetts
watch factory says : "I used to be a good deal of an ath-
lete and was in the habit of taking lots of out of door
exercise, but since I've been shut up in this shop I began
to have terrible bilious headaches. I still did enjoy an
occasional bout at boxing, but after a few lively rounds a
tendency to get as sick as can be seemed to take posses-
sion of me. The exercise appeared to stir up the bile and
the next day I would have a cracking good headache, My
druggist recommended me to try Ripans Tabules as a
possible cure. He said they seemed to be the latest cure-
all for stomach troubles. Well, he just hit it. I have not
used more than 25 cents' worth, but I exercise now asi
much as I please and don't know what a bilious headache
means any more."

THE FREEMAN
HEARD FROM
Captain Porter Gives an Ac
count of the Loss of
the Vessel.
The Crew Is Now Stopping With
Erower at Point Hope
Station.
A letter relating to the loss of the
whaling vessel Freeman is in the posses
sion of Mrs. W. P. S. Porter of Alameda,
the wife of Captain Porter, the late mas
ter of the wrecked vessel, being received
by her yesterday afternoon from her hus
band, who is now at Point Hope with the
greater part of his crew. The letter gives
a minute and detailed account of the loss
of the Orca, Freeman, Belvedere and Na
varch, and a description of the course of
the vessels from the time they reached
Alaskan waters until their final destruc
tion and abandonment off Point Barrow.
In speaking of the loss of the Freeman
he said:
"When we left the vessel at 4 p. m. she
was eight miles off shore and was drift
ing north with the ice pack. The next day
she drifted a little closer to land. She
was half full of water. Some natives
boarded her and set fire to her by acci
dent. I saved nothing but what I wore.
"Captain Sherman and I are all right
and are living at Liebes' station with
Charlie Brower. The Newport, Jeanie
and Fearless are all right and are close in
shore. The crews of the Orca and Free
man are here and those of the Belvedere
and Newport will shortly arrive. By us
ing economy we will pull through all
right."
According to Nilsson, the zoologist, the
weight of the Greenland whale is 100 tons
or 224,000 pounds, or equal to that of 88
elephants or 440 bears.
