FAN JOSE, Feb. 12.â 1n an affidavit
made by Mrs. Mary A. Welsh Scully
to-day Councilman Julius Krieg and
his brother, William Krieg, are charged
â with receiving bribes for a position on
the police force of San Jose.
Besides directly accusing these two
men, Mrs. Scully implicates Counoil
man George B. Dfttttt and James W.
Rea, better known as "Jim" Rea, the
"boss" of Santa Clara County, and also
puts the two remaining members of the
-Council, J. P. Fay and William T. Nolt
ing, in a questionable position. John
H. Scully is the officer whose position
â¢was bought. His wife made the affi
davit because, after she had allowed
him to squander her fortune of $50,000,
and had risked the loss of what little
property remained to her in order to
raise the money to buy him a "star"
on the local force, he had virtually de
serted her and left her and her four
children on the verge of starvation.
To the latter course. Mrs. Scully says.
her huÂ£Â£>a.L- m led by association
-vith, and through th* influence of
Councilman Krieg. It is in the hope
that Krieg will be punished for his
crime she has thrown fear and caution
to the winds and made public all the
details of the transaction.
Officer Scully, in the presence of the
Chief of Police and The Call's special
correspondent, this afternoon confessed
that he and his wife had procured his
position by the payment of money to
W. C. Krieg, as the agent or partner
of Councilman Krieg. chief Kidward
â¢was dumfounded over the disclosure
He immediately suspended Scully, and
will lay the matter before the Council
for investigation at the regular meet
ing of that body on Monday night.
Both the Kriegs and v oundiman Dlt- |
tvs deny that they ever received any
money for securing Scully a position
as a policeman. W. C. Krieg admits he
made a bargain with Mrs. Scully to use
his Influence with his brother to se- |
cure Scully a place on the police force, I
but claims that the twenty dollars
promised him was never paid by Mrs.
Scully. Council Krieg says he secured
JOHN H. SCULLY, the Policeman Whose Place Was
Bought by His Wife.
The San Francisco Call
! Scully's star for him simply out of
I friendship.
Whatever the Council may do in this
matter there is a certainty that It will
be brought to the attention of the
Grand Jury for immediate considera
tion. It is very likely that the New
Charter Club will take the case in hand.
While Mrs. Scully was dictating her
affidavit to-day the tears which she
j vainly endeavored to restrain would
now and again well over, and her
words would come in trembling, half
! sobbing tones, as days of anguish and
i suffering were apparently recalled to
| her mind. She lays all the blame for
j the apparent alienation of her hus
; band's affection to the companionship
jof Councilman Krieg. Her most fer
j vent wish, she says, is that Krieg may
I be put in the State's prison, and that
j men like him may never again be
elected to hold office in the city of San
i Jose.
A sad touch of romance runs through
j this story of bribery, cruelty and cor
ruption. Mrs. Scully was a rich wid
ow, with four children, when she mar
! ried John H. Scully about five years
ago. Her first husband, Welsh, left her
i a fortune of about $50,000. nearly all in
â  real estate, on El Dorado street, just
north nf the business center of San
Jose. She has the reputation of being
| extremely generous, and never In the
days of her prosperity refused a re
! quest from a friend for a loan. Be
â  tween her ill-advised liberality and the
â  drains made on her by her youthful
| and good-looking husband, all her
J property is to-day mortgaged up to the
; full limit, and the rents are pledged to
pay the interest on these mortgages.
For this reason Mrs. Scully has of late
been dependent on what her husband
could earn to provide food and cloth
ing for herself and children. Recently,
she says, she has been getting little or
nothing from Scully, whose salary as a
police officer has been $75 a month.
Some days, she stated, she had no mon
ey with which to provide her family
with food.
She charge? that Krieg has been tak
ing her husband into disreputable

State of California, County of Santa Clara, ss.
Mary A. Welsh Scully, being first duly sworn, deposes and says
that she is a resident of the city of San Jose, and has livad there con
tinuously for twenty-two years. She also further deposes and says:
I am the wife of Police Officer John Scully. John Scully was appointed
as a policeman on January 1, 1897. I am acquainted with Julius Krieg,
Councilman of the Fourth Ward of the city of San Jose. I have known
him for more than six years. During the latter part of December, 1897,
I sold some of my property to Mayor V. Koch for $6000, and while I
â was sick in bed W. C. Krieg called on me and said: "I hear Koch
gave you some money." I told him: "No, he didn't give me any; he
paid all the debts." He then said: "If you can get $150 to give my
brother Julius, he could get your husband on the police force." I asked
him how he could do it. and he said that Julius Krieg would give each
of his men in the Council a piece of money. He said that Dittus and
James W. Rea would get part of the money and they would put Scul
ly's name on the slate. I told him I could not get the money, and he
asked me to go to Mayor Koch and try to get the money. I sent for
Mayor Koch and asked him for the money, and he wanted to know
what I was going to do with the money. I told the Mayor I wanted to
pay a bill, and he said: "No, you don't; you want to pet Scully on the
force." I denied that I wanted the money for that purpose, and Koch
didn't give it to me.
I borrowed from C. J. Menslng, a dry goods clerk, $150 by paying
$25 for getting the money and $5 a month Interest for a year. I got this
money on the Ist day of December, 1896, and on the 28th of Decem
ber. 1896, in my home, in the presence of my husband. I paid to W. C.
Krieg the $150. W. C. Krieg told me he would give the money to his
brother Julius. On February 12. 1897, I saw Julius Krieg. I thanked
Julius for getting my husband on and told him I was sorry I could not
pay the balance. This balance was a note my husband and I signed
at the time I paid W. C. Krieg $150. The original agreement was that
I Bhould pay $150. When they found out we were anxious, they de
manded $50 more.
Julius Krieg then said: "I know you have done the best you could,
and you can pay the note when you can." He further said: "I did not
get all of this money. I didn't get half." W. C. Krieg then got an
order for $13 a month on the treasurer, to be deducted from Scully's
salary- This was repeated for three months, until the note was paid.
W. C. Krieg told me, when he got the money, not to tell It, as it was
a State's Prison offense; that it would be death to me if I told it.
On last Friday I asked George Dittus, a Councilman, how much
of this money he got. and he replied that he received none; that Krieg
got it all. Afterward I saw Mrs. W. C. Krieg and she said Dittus got
half of the money, but that he is afraid to acknowledge it.
I make this affidavit of my own free will, and for the purpose of
having these men punished for their crimes.

places and inducing him to spend his
! money there. It is this action on the
part of Krieg and her husband that
induced her to make this sensational
exposure.
Immediately after Mrs. Scully had
; made her affidavit, a copy of it was
taken to the Chief of Police and read
to him. He sent for Officer Scully.
i Scully at first denied all knowledge of
! money having been paid for his posi
| tion, but after all the details of the
' transaction were related and he had
; been cautioned by Chief Kidward, he
admitted that he had signed a note for
$50. which was in part payment of the
$200 that he and his wife had agreed
ito pay for his position. He denied,
however, that he had seen his wife pay
i over the $150 in cash to W. G. Krieg.
His other answers were given in such
a way as to indicate that he was far
from telling "the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth."
He could not recollect when or where
; the note was signed, whether or not his
wife had signed the note with him, or
what had become of the note. When
pressed on the matter he Baid that he
had destroyed the note, after he had
paid it by giving four orders on the
City Treasurer for $13 35 each to W. C.

Krieg. The last of these orders was
paid on January 21, of this year. He
said that he knew his wife had paid
$150 to W. C. Krieg for his position, as
she had told him so, but he did not
know when or where this money was
paid. He also knew that she had bor
rowed it. Scully made the following
further statement:
"I had the first talk with W. C.
Krieg about securing a position on the
police force in November, 1596. just be
fore the election. I afterward ap
proached Councilman Krieg and said I
would like to get a place on the police
force. He said it depended on who got
elected as members of the council. He
would then see how things stood. 1
next paw W. C. Krieg in his shop
after election. He said there was a
pretty hard crowd elected and that it
would take money for a fellow to get
in. He said it would take about $150.
He did not mention any names, but
said that parties up town would have
to have it. I was also present at my
house when W. C. Krieg spoke to my
wife about this matter."
Chief Kidward was rendered almost
speechless by the revelations to which
he was a listener. When the interview
with Scully waa over and the latter had

left the Chiefs private office. Chief
Kidward expressed himself as follows:
"I didn't know the first thing about
this. It was a cloudburst to me. The
only thing I knew was about the col
lecting of the money by W. C. Krieg. I
thought he was simply collecting money
for some work done for Scully. I col
lect the money for the whole depart
ment from the City Treasurer, and
these orders are a check against the
men's salary, which I generally pay. I
remember the payment of two of these
orders to W. C. Krieg. The first order
was left with the City Treasurer, and
I think wh<>n I called for the money
they gave me the order as part of
Scully's salary. The second order was
presented to me by W~. C. Krieg. He
brought the order in here and I paid
it to him and kept it out of Scully's
salary."
Chief Kidward th<=>n paid the fol
lowing tribute to Scully as an officer:
"As far as Scully personally in con
cerned he has been a number 1 offi
cer. He has shown himself to be ex
ceedingly bright, and for a new man
has done remarkably good work. I
expected good work from him, but he
far_exceeded my expectations. He
always proved himself faithful, willing
and energetic."
At the close of thÂ« Interview the
Chief gave the order for the immediate
suspension of Officer Scully pending an
investigation before the City Council.
The Chief evidently regretted to take
this course, but said he had to act
promptly in order to protect himself
and the police force as a whole from
unfavorable criticism. He added that
he would lay the matter before the
Council on Monday night.
In the course of his interview Scully
said he could not place his hands oa
any of the orders or the note given to
W. C. Krieg. but the last order paid
by Chief Kidward was secured. It
readfe as follows:
San Jose. March 25. 1597.
j N Ewing. Treasurer City of San
Jose- Please pay to W. C. Krleg. on or
der, thirteen 35-100 dollars ($13.35) and de
duct the same from my salary for the
month of July, 1897, and oblige.
(Signed) JOHN SCULLY.
This bears the "O. K." of Scully and
a penciled memorandum shows it was
paid on January 21. 1898. Across the
face of it, at right angles to the writ-
Ing of the order, is written in large
characters in what is evidently the
handwriting of W. C. Krieg, the word
"Paid." Under this is the signature of
Krieg.
W. C. Krieg denied that he had been
a party in any way to securing a place
for Scully on the police force by the :
payment of money to his brother, the ;
Councilman, or any other Councilman. '
He denied that he had ever been paid i
any money by Mrs. Scully for securing â 
a place for her husband. His explana- ;
tlon of the transaction he had had with
the Scullys is as follows: "The note
for $50 was for work I did in repairing
their pump and for some borrowed
money. They can say what they want, j
but let them prove it."
"Why should Mrs. Scully make these
charges?" he was asked.
"I can't say why. I had talked with i
Scully, and had agreed to help him. â 
She agreed to give me $20 if I would ;
use my influence to get her husband on \
the force, and I spoke to my brother
about him. but she never paid me the â¢
$20. To show you the feeling that ex
ists between Mrs. Scully and myself. I \
must tell you of some of the business
transactions that took place between '
us. Since the time she promised to pay
me that $20 I did some repairing on her :
steam pump, and bought some old win- ;
dows that she had. I wanted them to !
build a green house. When my wife
asked her what the windows were
worth, Mrs. Scully said let it go for
the $2". as she wanted to pay her debts. |
Now she wants pay for the glass, and I j
will pay her whatever the glass is i
worth, if she will pay for the repair |
work on the pump. I can show that j
the note was given for work done, but
it will mean considerable work over my
books.
"Mrs. Scully was the first to speak \
about getting her husband a position
on the police force. This was a few
months earlier than December, 1396.
She said she thought Johnnie would
make a good police officer. After that ;
%ye had frequent conversations about !
it."
Councilmen Krieg and Dittus, who
are boon companions and can always
"be found together, when they are not
attending to public or private business,

vorite haunts on Market street. They

SACRAMENTO, Feb. 12.â C. M. Ray
mond, alias Moore, who is now in Fol
som prison, and who is to be hanged
on the Bth day of April for the murder
of Fred Andrews in a hotel at Baden,
San Mateo County, has made a full and
complete confession. He exonerates
Winters and implicates a man by the
name of Willets. To-night's Bee has
the following statement of the con
fession:
"On last Monday Moore sent for
Warden Aull. saying he was anxious to
see him upon important business. It
was a wet, dismal day, and this, per
haps, may have led him to think of
his crime. When Warden Aull arrived
at the cell Moore told the Warden that
he wanted to confess to the murder,
and asked the Warden to send for
Brother Chisholm, the prison chaplain.
Warden Aull told him that he would
send for Brother Chisholm, but that the
chaplain generally came over on Sat
urday.
Moore said that he could not wait
that long. Warden Aull then said hÂ«
would see how soon he could get
Brother Chisholm and telephoned to
the chaplain, who answered he would
try to get over from Auburn the next
day. The warden was very busy, hav
ing other matters to attend to, and told
the chaplain he could not see him on
Tuesday.
Warden Aull then went to Moore
that same evening and told him that
Chisholm would not be over until Sat
urday. Moore still insisted that he
could not wait that long.
The condemned man said that he and
Winters went to Baden one week prior
to the shooting and examined the
building. They then went back to San
Francisco, where Moore procured a re
volver from Winters. Later, Moore
said, he met Willets, who was an ex
convict, and together they returned to
Baden. While there, Moore said, he
met Winters in Holy Cross Cemetery
and got another pistol from him. W*il
lets and Moore that night entered Fer
riter's Hotel for the purpose of com
mitting the burglary.
"Some one who was at the head of
the stairs," said Moore, "saw us and
threw me down stairs. The noise at
tracted several other roomers, wtio ap
peared on the scene. At the foot of
the stairs I looked up and saw several
people struggling with Willets, when I
shot four times."
Warden Aull asked Moore what Win-,
ters was doing In Baden at that time.2
if he was not implicated in the mur
der. Moore said he was there for the
purpose of robbing the paymaster of
the Western Meat Company, who was
to pay off the men at the slaughter
house the next day. Warden Aull asked
him if Winters knew that Moore and
WUlets wore going to commit the burg
lary, and he replied that he did.

FINDS FOR THE
STATE PRINTER
Office at Sacramento May
Soon Resume Op-
erations.
Secretary Brown Believes There
Is a Way to Bring This
About.
Governor Budd Says Means Would
Be Found tc Meet Any Pos
sible Contingency.
Special Dlepntch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 12.â The possi
bility of the State printing office being
provided with funds sufficient to enable
the State printer to resume operations
has again arisen. Secretary of State
Brown, in speaking of the matter, said
to-night to The Call correspondent:
"I have hopes of providing some
means by which the State printing
office will be enabled to open again with
a sufficient force to meet the require
ments naturally following the semi
annual publication of various State re
ports.
"I have had a short talk with the
Attorney-General, and believe that he
favors some way out of the present dif
ficulty. The regents of the State Uni
versity stand ready to advance $200,
000 to the fund of the State Printing
Office, provided some legal and proper
procedure can be arranged. Should
Governor Budd sanction the proposi
tion I feel quite certain that the State
Printing Office will again be opened."
Governor Budd said, when spoken to
concerning this project:
'"Several months ago the Attorney-
General and I discussed the matter,
and at that time came to the under
standing that when the necessity arose
there might be some steps taken to
ward providing for it. I have no doubt
of being able to find means which will
meet the contingency when it arises.
The various boards and institutions
throughout the State have been getting
along very nicely, and a great saving
has been made in the use of the mimeo
graph. Lessons in economy have been
taught, to the great saving of the
State's funds.
"I see no reason for altering the pres
ent advantageous system until the ab
solute necessity arises. When the Leg
islature convenes it can order the
printing of whatever reports it deems
necessary, and until then I do not see
the necessity of providing for a great
demand until we are sure that such a
demand exists. We are getting along
very well, indeed, and I am hearing no
complaints from the State institutions
on the question of their printing, and
1 am quite certain that no particular
fault is being found by the people who

REACHES ITS CLIMAX.
Many Doomed to Die of Starvation
Unless Belief Is Given
at Once.
NEW YORK, Feb. 12â A npeclal cable
to the World frrnn Dublin says: The dis
tress in Ireland has rrached an acute
phase; yet Chief Irish Secretary Balfour
has consented only under pressure from
Irish members of Parliament *o adopt en
tirely inadequate measures of relief. Wil
liam* Phillips, an Englishman owning
large estates in West Ireland, where he
is magistrate for several counties, and
who is a political supporter of the present
government, gives the following appall
ing description of the condition of af
fairs there:
"Knowing probably better than any
other Englishman the people of West Ire
land, I am deeply disappointed to find
Gerald Balfour's answer to the Trish
members so very unsatisfactory. From
my own personal knowledge I can assure
the Worlds readers that no words I could
use would adequately describe the fear
ful state of misery and destitution in
which from no fault of their own, they
are now placed. Unless many are to die
of starvation, immediate relief is imper
atively demanded."

SAX JOSE, Feb. 12.â Mrs. George F.

BETTER PRICES
Wine Growers Meet in
Conference at St.
Helena.
Urged by Speakers to Lend
Their Support to the
Corporation.
Henry J. Crocker of San Francisco
Presided Over the Large
Gathering.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. HELENA, Feb. 12.â A big meet
ing was held here to-day by the Wine
Makers' Corporation for the purpose
of conferring with the producers with
a view to strengthening the organiza
tion. The meeting was arranged by
Charles A. Wetmore of Stockton and J.
R. Miller of Sonoma, the committee ap
pointed to conduct this work in the in
terest of the corporation. The morn
ing train from San Francisco brought
Henry J. Crocker, president, and W. J.
Hotchkiss, manager of the corporation.
The meeting was held in the town
hall at 1 o'clock this afternoon, and
was largely attended, men being pres
ent from Napa, Pope and Chiles val
leys, Yountville, Oakvllle, Rutherford,
Calistoga and other parts of the coun-
try.
Seneca Ewer called the meeting to
order, and Henry J. Crocker was elect
ed chairman, and Senator C. L. Larue
secretary. Air. Crocker outlined the ob
jects of the meeting, saying that the
corporation was endeavoring to procure
80 per cent of the wines now outside of
the association and corporation.
"With this amount added to what had
already been pledged, the growers
would be enabled to control the market
and again name and receive fair prices
for wine. There were many outside the
corporation, he said, who were wanted
because by united action the producers
could have control of the situation, and
the support of these outsiders was nec
essary to the success of the movement.
W. J. Hotchkiss reviewed the history
of the corporation, telling what it had
done and its objects. He spoke of the
urgent necessity of the producers
standing together in order to place the
market on a secure foundation. The
men outside tlfe corporation who sold
to the association were, he said, fur
nishing ammunition with which to fight
the growers.
Resolutions were passed commending
the action of the corporation in its ef
forts to protect the wine men against
unnecessary losses, and declaring that
its projects are entitled to serious con
sideration and immediate attention.
Speeches strongly* favoring the cor
poration and its efforts to win over
additional men were made by Charles
A. Wetmore, J. R. Miller, S. Ewer, H.
W. Crabb, C. N. Pickett, C. L. Larue
and Henry Lange.
Messrs. Wetmore and Miller will re
main in the valley for several days
personally interviewing the growers
and urging them to unite with the
corporation;
HOLLISTER CAPITALIST
ENDS LIFE WITH POISON.
Rancher Joseph H. Ringot Found
Dead in a Cart in His
Field.
HOLLISTER, Feb. 12.â Joseph H. Rin
got, a wealthy resident of Hollister, was
found dead in a cart in his field at noon
to-day. An empty -ottle, which had con
tained carbolic acid, was evidence of sul
ciae. The mouth was badly burnu.
Ringot was 82 years of age. For many
years he was a pioneer shipbuilder in San
Francisco. Twelve years ago ho sold his
business there and invested in farming
property, from which he derived a large
income. Within the last three months he
invested in aduitional property. It had
been his custom to drive into the field and
doze in his cart. A colored farmhand
heard him groaning, but supposed he was
snoring. Two hours later he was found
dead.
No motive can be assigned for the sui
cide, as Ringot was actively planning im
provements on his property. He leaves
an estate valued at $250,000.

FIND EVIDENCE
OF A MURDER
Boys Discover a Corpse
in a Wood Near
Tacoma.
Officials Believe It Is That of
Alfred Cushing of San
Francisco.
Slayers Had Removed All Evidence
Which Might Lend to an
Identification.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
TACOMA, Feb. 12.â Tacoma has a
murder mystery. The victim was klllr-d
nearly two months ago, and the body
concealed in the woods four miles south
of the city, near Fern Hill. Everything
which could afford the slightest clew
to his identity was removed with one
exception, and that clew leads the Cor
oner and police to believe that the man
came from San Francisco. It consists
of a stamp in his soft black hat, which
shows that it was procured at the San
Francisco Hat Works, at 111 Fourth
street, in that city.
Alfred Gushing, who came from San
Francisco in November, is missing.
His description tallies with that of the
body found last night, except that
Cushing wore gray clothes when last
seen, while the murdered man was
dressed in a new suit of black diago
nal cloth. Cushing was ; oing out near
Fern Hill looking for land, which
strengthens the belief that he may be
the murdered man.
The body was found last evening by
boys, but was not recovered until to
day. It lay on its back, with the hands
stretched out by its side. The dead
man wore a sack coat, light striped
shirt, celluloid collar and four-in-hand
scarf.
Beneath the vest was a short knitted
brown wool jacket. His pockets con
tained a black silk handkerchief, $9 33
in silver, some cartridges, a bottle half
full of whisky and a carpenter's fold
ing rule. He was five feet six inches
tall, weighed lfiO pounds and was from
30 to 35 years old. His teeth may afford
a means of identification, being pecu
liar in that an extra tooth protruded
through the roof of his mouth just to
the right of the center of his lower jaw.
One lower tooth was decayed to the
roots and two upper teeth were miss
ing. All his clothing was new and of
good quality, including underclothing
and shoes. Ten feet away was found
a cheap small caliber revolver. His
pockets bear evidence that all papers
had been removed from them.
Everything indicates that the stran
ger was murdered by having his throat
cut, for his windpipe was completely
severed. Rodents and insects had
gnawed at his face and neck, but care
ful examination shows that no bullet
had entered his hoad or body. Blood
had run down his body, which it would
not have done had he committed sui
cide and died on the spot.
The police are working on several
theories, being inclined to believe that
he was murdered for his money and
carried into the bushes by the mur
derers, who removed his letters and
papers, placing a whisky bottle and re
volver near by to indicate suicide. The
leaving of a little money in his pockets
would also tend to divert suspicon.
Alfred Cushing, who came here in No
vember, rented a room on Taooma ave
nue until February 20. He returned
from one land-hunting expedition, and
started out on another shortly before
Christmas, intending to- start a chick
en ranch, v. hen he found the right lo
cation. The fact that he has not re
turned has aroused suspicion, and it
will not be surprising if he and the
dead man are found to be identical.
Whether he has relatives in San Fran
cisco is not known, as his room con
tains absolutely nothing that reveals
who his friends were.
The remains were buried this after
noon.
PNEUMONIA CAN
NOW BE CURED
An Important Discovery Made
by Two Brooklyn
Physicians.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 12.â Considerable
discussion has been caused among mem
bers of the medical profession by news
of the discovery by two physicians of the
Borough of Brooklyn of a remedy which
they believe will cure the dre;id disease
pueumonia. Dr. Charles Lundbeck and
Dr. Carl Elfstrom, who have worked to
gether in developing this cure, are posi
tive that it will be a success. Dr. Lund
beck has the greatest faith in the cure,
and while he hag tested it on only half
a dozen patients the results fully satisfy
him that he has a method which will
revolutionize the treatment of pneumonia.
Dr. Lundbeck at his home *o-night said:
"There is not the slightest danger at
tached to the treatment, and it is pain
less. No drugs are used. I simply draw
a quantity of blood from the patient. The
amount is determined by the condition
of the patient. To give an idea of the
Quantity I may say that it is very small,
about fifty grammes, or little more than
one ounce and a half, in most cases. This
blood is prepared by a process in which
heat as well as time is a factor in pre
paring the serum. It 1h prepared in a
vessel something like an incubator. It
takes several hours to prepare it and It
is then hypodermically injected into the
patient.
"In one cose where the patient's Tungs
were solid and she had the greatest dif
ficulty in breathing the lungs began to
melt in ten or twelve hours, and she is
now fully restored to health. There is
no secret about the method. It is simply
as to the preparation of the serum that
we have had mainly to experiment. The
I serum acts in making the bacilli harm
! less and that is what effects the cure.
As soon as I have perfected all the meth
ods I will inform members of my profes
sion. There, is no desire to keep any
thing seem. It will be for the good of
humanity."
MORRISON'S SALARY
MATERIALLY REDUCED.
Justice Wallace Decides the Case of
the San Jose Street Superin
tendent.
SAN JOSK, Feb. 12.â Justice Wallace to
day decided . that George M. Morrison is
Street Superintendent and not Street
Commissioner, and consequently is en
titled to' draw- a salary of only $100 a
month under the new charter. This deci
sion was rendered in a suit brought on a
claim assigned from Morrison to recover
$125 a month salary.
Morrison was chief deputy iinder Street
Commissioner Bennett, and at the lat
ter's death was appointed Jiis successor.
Under the old charter there was the office
of Street Commissioner, but when Morri
son was appointed to the vacancy the
new charter was in effect, and the office
of Street Superintendent had been creat
ed with a salary of $100 a month. In the
meantime Morrison presented a claim
for $125 each month, which the Council
refused to allow.
KLONDIKE KING
SHOT TO DEATH
Hector C. Bollong Mur
dered by a Former
Friend.
Tragedy at Seattle Followed by
the Suicide of the
Slayer.
Were Partners and Boon Compan
ions, but Quarreled Over Prop
erty Rights.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Feb. 12.â Hector C. Bol
long, one of the men that made small
fortunes in the golden Klondike last
year, was murdered this morning. The
deed was done by his former boon com
panion, Andrew S. Annan, who then
turned the revolver to his own head
and blew out his brains.
The two men were friends in Schuy
ler, Nebr., and came to Seattle in 1888.
Bollong invested considerable money
in tide land property, improved it,
went into the cattle business and later
took Annan in as a partner. The prop
erty became involved In litigation and
Bollong and Annan quarreled as to
whether or not they should fight the
case in the courts. Annan refused to
put up any money for the litigation.
Bollong spent considerable, and the
outcome of the case was a partial vic
tory for the two men. Bollong in
sisted that Annan put up his share of
the court expenses, but Annan persist
ently refused.
A year ago came the Klondike ex
citement and Bollong went north,
leaving his parents to represent him
in the property. Annan lived With
them in a house on the dispuieu
land. Bollong had hardly been out of
the city when Annan began a series
of unsuccessful efforts to abtain sole
possession of the land. While he was
engaged in this effort Bollong re
turned from the north. He had pushed
over the passes, entered the land of
pebbly gold and obtained possession of
claims that are now admitted to be
worth $75,000.
Annan continued his efforts to get
the land, and one day recently, meeting
Bollong in the streets, he accused him
of crooked work in connection with the
litigation. Yesterday they met again.
Hot words followed, and when they
separated Bollong remarked to a friend
that Annan was "a little off."
Last night Bollong retired at about
11 o'clock. W. B. Williams, an old
friend, stayed with him. Annan, who
was still a member of the household,
occupied a room opposite that of his
former friend. This morning, when
Bollong left his bedroom to go down
stairs, Annan stepped out, revolver in
hand, and commenced to fire.
Three bullets took effect and the un
fortunate victim staggered into the
kitchen, dying a few minutes after
ward in the arms of his parents.
As he was breathing his last another
shot was heard in Annan's bedroom.
Investigation showed that the mur
derer had taken his own life.
Bollong leaves a father, mother,
three brothers and four sisters to
mourn his death. Two of his brothers
live in Fairhaven, this State, and the
other in San Bernardino County, Cal.
Two of his sisters live in this city and
the other two in California. All of his
sisters are married except one.
Annan is believed to have had rela
tives in Schuyler, Nebr.

Bpeolal Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 12. â Correspond
ence of the Herald under date of Man
agua, Nicaragua. January 16, says:
The canal commission, having met
President Zelaya and his Cabinet, is
settling down to its work on the line of
the canal between the lake and the Pa
cific. The main problem of this portion
of the canal project is the La Flor
dam. The commission expects to nass
two weeks In the study of this western
division.
About five days ( were occupied by the
commission In its trip up the river,
making observations of features of the
Btream and an examination of the
work which is being done along the line
of the canal as it affects the river.
The commission will make another
examination of the river portion of the
canal route on its return from the west
ern side, when it will make a careful
study of possible dam sites in the vi
cinity of Ochoa and San Francisco
and Deseado valleys. The work of the
parties of Mr. naves, Mr. Davis, Mr.
Ehle, Mr. Onderdonk and others will
then be in an advanced stage, and
many valuable data will have been
obtained by that time. This will
greatly assist the commission in arriv
ing at definite conclusions. The line
of the canal, as at present, from
Greytown to Ochoa, including the dam,
is where the commission expects its
hardest work.
The commission will spend several
days on foot going over the line from (
Ochoa into Greytown, and it is cer
tain that its findings will cover every
possible feature and phase of the di
vision.
The party in coming up the river
from Ochoa had an excellent opportun
ity to study the San Juan and the top
ography of its valley. The canal line,
as at present, does not contemplate any
use of the river below Ochoa. Between
Oohoa and Fort San Carlos are San
Carlos River and Machuca Belas, Cas
tillo and Torro Rapids.
On reaching Fort San Carlo 9, the
commission found the work under the
direction of Lieutenant Hanus well
advanced. Lieutenant Hanus and his
party reached here on December 31. He :
will make a complete survey of the
coast line of the lake on both sides for
miles above and below the two canal
entrances, and will also make complete
soundings covering areas of the lake
twenty miles square on both sides.
In addition he will make soundings
along the proposed line across the lake.
This has been done only once, many
years ago, and as the work was done
In a small launch and under unfavor
able circumstances, the results have
never been regarded as final.
Lieutenant Hanus Is of the opinion
that these soundings across the lake
may result In locating some sunken
volcanic peaks. Lieutenant Hanus,
from observations thus far made about :
anrt among the islands, believes it may
be possible to carry the canal route
through some one of these channels,
Instead of to the north, as the plan of ;
the canal company has it. Should a
complete survey and soundings develop
the feasibility of this and should such
development be adopted, several miles
would be saved in the Journey across
the lake.
If Lieutenant Hanus secures time
and facilities he will make a complete
survey and chart of the lake, some
thing that has never been done. As it
is his chart will show all that is ma
terial to the canal route and on a big
scale. Work on the lake, in common
with the work of all other divisions,
will be done with a thoroughness that
has not been attained before, because
of the fact that there are more men
than ever before on the canal line and
that these men will spend more time
on their work than was possible for
the men of any previous expedition.

NEW YORK, Feb. 12.â The
Press says: Through a source
known to be absolutely trust
worthy the Press has learned
the identity of the person who
stole the famous De borne letter.
The insulting missive was not
abstracted from the mails, and it
was not a thoughtless or uncon-
Bidered memorandum, never in-
tended for transmission by post,
as has been contended in some
quarters. The letter which en
compassed De Lome's downfall
was stolen by Manuel Serafin
Plchardo, son-in-law of Senor
Arturo Amblad, deputy of the
Cortes In Cuba. Pichardo Is the
close business associate of Can
alejas, the editor of El Heraldo,
of Madrid, to whom the letter
was addressed and delivered,
and Is the Havana correspond
ent of that newspaper. He is a
young man of brilliant Intellect
ual attainments and the vigor
and beauty of his poetic writings
have given him the name erf the
"Poet of Cuba."
HAVANA (via Key West), Feb. 12.â
i It has been resolved to open negotia
tions with the insurgents, in the belief
that the revolution could not be sup
pressed by force of arms. Anticipating
that the insurgents would not accept
the new terms, the colonial Govern
ment will open negotiations, thus sav
ing the Madrid Government the respon
sibility.
The following propositions will be
formally tendered to the insurgents:
First â The volunteers will be dis
solved and a Cuban militia formed.
Second â The insurgent colonels and
generals will be recognized.
Third â Cuba will be called on to pay
only $100,000,000 out of the $600,000,000
indebtedness due for both wars.
Fourthâ Cuba will pay $2,000,000 a
year for the crown list.
Fifth â Cuba will make her own trea
ties without interference by the
Madrid Government.
Sixth â Spanish products will have
only a 10 per cent margin of protection
over similar products from other coun
tries.
Seventh â No exiles or deportations
will be made, even In war time, to
Spain, Africa or penal settlements
elsewhere.
Eighth â Death sentences for rebel
lion shall be abolished.
Ninth â Martial law cannot be or
dered by the Captain-General without
the assent of both the House and the
Senate if those bodies are in session,
or without the assent of a majority of
the Cabinet if they are not in session.
Tenth â The Archbishop of Santiago
de Cuba shall always be a native
Cuban.
Eleventh â The actual insurgent
party shall have three seats in the
first Cabinet.
Twelfth â An armistice of fifteen days
shall be granted for the discussion of
the terms of peace.
The annexation sentiment is grow
ing stronger among the Spanish resi
dents, and if it were not for the strict
censorship exercised this sentiment
would be manifested through the news
papers. Several merchants and plant
ers, some native Spaniards and mem
bers of the Conservative party, upon
being interviewed, declared that the
situation in Cuba was terrible and that
if the war should continue for another
year the island would disappear from
among the producing countries of the
world.
SEEKING A DIPLOMAT.
Spain Anxious to Get a Good Man to
Succeed De Lome.
MADRID, Feb. 12.â The Ministry is j
busy trying to rind a fitting repreaenta
! tive to take Senor De Lome's place.
The one who would seem to have been
made for the position is Senor Arguer
ra, until recently Sub-Secretary for
State, which position he relinquished j
upon being gazetted as Embassador to I
Vienna. He has not yet left for his j
post. I understand he has been ap- j
j proached, but has refused the place, j
; which is distinctly a great pity, as here i
! we have a serious trained diplomatist, j
I who accurately knows the views of !
! Senors Sagasta and Gullon Just as ab- }
j solutely as General Woodford knows
Intimately those of President McKin- \
j ley. Further, Senor Arguerra is mi
i stinctively fond of details, calcula- j
I tions, figures, etc., and in this particu
j lar would be superior to Senor De |
â  Lome in dealing with the infinite tech- I
j nicaiities which will necessarily arise i
jin connection with the commercial
' treaty.
There was much cordiality at a din- !
; ncr given last night by General Wood- I
I ford. Ministers Gullon and Moret, it '
was remarked, stopped very late. That !
the conversation was not unsatisfac- |
tory was reflected In General Wood
ford's distinctly happy appearance,
which told more of the satisfactory
state of affairs than many words.
HAVANA. Feb. 12.â Letters from the
Herald's field correspondent, who is once
more with the insurgent forces, bring
information that without doubt the Cu
ban army was anxious for several
weeks because of a fear that important |
leaders might surrender to General !
Blanco. Had an important presenta- j
tion taken place the cause would have '
1 been greatly crippled. j
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 1898.
GREAT BRITAIN
NOT A LOSER
Gaining Many Diplomatic
Points in the Far East
Controversy.
Both Germany and Russia Will
Respect Present Commer
cial Treaties.
On the Whole the Policy Pursued by
Premier Salisbury Is Satis
factory,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Feb. 12.â Though the Chau
vinists noisily persist in distorting: the
situation in the far East, the great
majority are abundantly satisfied with
Lord Salisbury's statement, and there
is reason to believe that they will be
still more gratified in no far distant
future. When the Government shall be
in a position to lay the papers on the
subject before Parliament, it will be
seen that the conduct of the affairs has
been in strict compliance with the prin
ciples enunciated by half a dozen Cab
inet Ministers.
Of course, the Premier Is not in a po
sition to reveal the whole story, as
there is much yet to settle, but he will
be able to relieve all anxiety with an
explicit statement that he will allow
no power to interfere with British
treaties with China, which give free
dom of entry to every port which may
become open under authority, or at the
request of any power whatsoever.
By his attitude In regard to Kiaochau
Bay, the Marquis of Salisbury has
paved the way for a community of po
litical action between Great Britain
and Germany, which will not only pro
duce excellent results in the far East,
but help to assure the stability of the
general international situation. This is
already shown by the transfer of Herr
Detring, the Commissioner of Chinese
Customs, to the Government service in
Shang Tung Province, he having ad
mittedly gone to Peking to undermine
Sir Robert Hart, the Englishman who
has been Director of the Chinese Im
perial Maritime Customs since 1885.
Great Britain's agreement with Rus
sia will probably also be found to be
more reaching than a written assur
ance that Port Arthur will be a free
port and agreeing to the opening of
Talien Wan when the railroad reaches
there.
The British warships now on their
way to China are the first-class battle
ship Barfleur, the first-class cruiser
Gibraltar and the second-class cruiser
Bonaventure. When they arrive on
March 5 or thereabouts Great Britain
will have a preponderance of nearly five
thousand tons over warships of Russia
and France combined in those waters.
ROBBED OF HIS
DIAMOND STUD
Millionaire Henry Miller the
Victim of Light- Fingered
Gentry.
j Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, Feb. 12.â Henry Miller, the
San Francisco millionaire, was "touched"
for his $500 diamond stud at the railway
station to-day. Mr. Miller was on his
way from Uakersfleld to San Francisco
and got off the train to take luncheon.
As soon as he alighted several people
I crowded around the platform, and after
I the millionaire had elbowed his way
j through he noticed that his diamond no
i longer sparkled on his shirt bosom. He
caught sight of a well-dressed man walk
ing away from the station and observed
that he was one of those who stood close
! to him as he alighted from the train.
< Mr. Miller followed him for about half
a block, but came to the conclusion that
The had the wrong person, as the well
dressed individual had such a respectable
I appearance.
Mr. Miller reported the theft of his dia-
J mond to the officers, who believe that the
man suspected by him was the one who
"picked" the diamond.
Mr. Miller was very wroth over the
thoft of the stone and offered a reward of
! $150 for its recovery. He afterward said
i that he would give $500 reward for its re
j covery, as he had worn It for twenty
i three years and had promised It upon his
: death to his grandchild.
A passenger on the train said that he
; recognized among; the passengers a no
' torious confidence woman whom he knew
' in Los Angeles, although he did not know
her name. She got off the train right be
hind Miller. It Is strongly suspected
I that she took the diamond.

FOUND DEAD.
Why did he do it? He had everything
to live for, â happy home, wife, friends,
money; but he shot himself through the
heart. Why ?
He couldn't have given a good reason
himself. But everything looked gloomy
to him. He was in a gloomy frame of mind.
It was the way he looked at life that day.
He had been living in too much of a hurry,
rushing' and driving at business, hustling
through his meals, cutting short his sleep.
His nerves got on edge ; his stomach and
liver got out of order; he grew dyspeptic
and melancholy.
When the digestion is out of order there
is little use trying to look on the bright side
of things, practically there isn't any bright
side. This is a dangerous condition to get
into. Yet it is easy to get into and mighty
hard to get out of it, unless you go about it
in the right way.
There is a remedy that has pnlled thou-
sands of people right out of this depth of
despair. It is Dr. Pierces Golden Medical
Discovery. It acts directly upon the stom-
ach and liver. It restores their natural
capacity to nourish and purify the system.
It purges away bilious poisons, feeds the
nerve-centres with healthy, highly vitalized
blood, and drives out the "blue devils " of
melancholy and nervousness.
J. L. Warner, No. 1900 O Street, Sacramento,
Cal.. writes: " During the last five years I have
been doctoring with as many as six different doc-
tors here and in San Francisco for diseased stom-
ach; but none of the doctors gave me even tem-
porary relief. Two years ago I completely col-
lapsed, and had to give up aX work. I have felt
many times that I would like to leave this world.
In looking over the ads in the San Francisco
Examiner I ran across yours, and I now owe my
life and present good health to Dr. Pierces med-
icines. I have taken fourteen bottles of the
' Golden Medical Discovery and four little vials
of ' Pleasant Pellets,' and I am entirely well of
all stomach trouble. Can sleep nine hours every
sight, aad am now ready to go to work again."

LOS ANGELES, Feb. 12.â Hon. C.
A. Towne of Minnesota, chairman of
the Silver Republican National Com
mittee, opened the campaign for bi
metallism in Southern California at
Hazard's Pavilion to-night, and was
greeted by a large audience. His re
marks created enthusiasm among the
followers of Bryan. The salient points
of his address follow:
As the chairman of the National Com
mittee of the Silver Republican party it
is a privilege to me to meet the members
EX-CONGRESSMAN CHARLES A. TOWNE.
of the Silver Republican" Club face to
face, to extend to them in behalf of the
Silver Republicans everywhere our sin
cere appreciation and to wish the club
a still more honorable part in the future
prosecution <>f the great contest we are
in. I regard as a fortunate circumstance
also that I am permitted to make my first
speech in California on the anniversary
of the birth of Abraham Lincoln, whose
memory is as dear to the hearts of the
Silver Republicans. Democrats and Pop
ulists that are lovers of their country as
it can possibly be to any member of the
regular Republican organization, and his
principles we practically proclaim to be
infinitely nearer in accord with those we
advocate than with the present policy of
the organization that bears the old name.
The great contest of the day Is between
the many and the few, the masses of the
people and the so-called vested Interests
intrenched behind special privileges; be
tween the producers of wealth and the
hoarders oif gold. In such a fight no one
can doubt that the deep sympathies and
earnest efforts of Abraham Lincoln, were
he alive to-day, would be. as they always
were, upon the side of the massi-s and of
the people. In this respect Jefferson, Lin
coln and Bryan are but varying
sions, appropriate to their respective
ages, of the infinite wisdom and good
ness of God in raising up instruments for
the carrying out of his inscrutable pur
poses.
The work of Lincoln was to emancipate
a subjugated race of 4,000,000 men. The
object of the contest waging to-day is
to unfetter the energies of 7S.000.OOi) of
people, and, indirectly, to add to the pro
ductive power and social happiness of the
producers of wealth in every land. The
ptory of civilization is the history of the

attempts of selfishness and greed to ob
tain control of states and civilizations.
In every age the contest has assumed
substantially the same complexion. From
the time when nations were established
and the arts of peace began to thrive
there have existed men who have pa
tiently and unrelentlessly pursued a pur
pose of thriving by the labor of others.
To this end they have secured the con
trol of governments and have made the
laws.
One of the most subtle and effective
means employed by them has been the
manipulation of the money systems that
have prevailed among various nations.
Inasmuch as the prices of commodities,
when conditions effecting them remain
unchanged, will rise with and increase In
the kind of money substance in which
they arc stated and will fall with a de
crease in that substance; and inasmuch
as the debtor who incurs a debt when
I prices are high and must pay it when
prices are low will inevitably contricrute
a portion of his substance to the creditor
which the latter in jusvice has no right
to receive, it follows that the creditor in
terests of society, if they are able to con-
I trol the money unit which measures the
value of services and commodities, can
subject the producers to a virtual slavery,
under which all property will gradually
[ pass into the possession of the conspira
; tors.
International monetary conferences,
committei's to ino.uirc into the causes of
the increasing disparity between the met
als, commission after commission to in
vestigate the depression of agriculture,
have followed each other from year to
year ever slneo 1576. when the discovery
seems really first to have been made that
in the demonetization of silver a fatal
blow had been struck at the progress of
mankind.
In the United States until 1596 but one
policy was avowed upon this subject and
that was a determination to get rid of
the gold standard.
The Republican platform declared for
bimetallism in 1888 and again in 1892, but
notwithstanding these declarations, the
Administration policy of that party was
by usurpation of power and by abject
submission to the dictates of the gold
brokers to fasten upon the- country more
and more securely the policy of monetary
contraction. About the year 1896 the pow
ers in control of the Republican party
thought themselves strong enough to
show their hand.
In the platform at St. Louis they de
clared against the free coinage of silver,
except by international agreement, which
they pledged themselves to promote, but
proclaimed that until such an agreement !
could be had the existing gold standard
must be maintained. The reference to
the international agreement was a mere j
pretense. While many thousands of
prominent Republicans honestly sup- j
ported the declaration and many millions i
believed in it and trusted it. the powers
that put it into the plafform used it to i
attract the support of the former and j
never intended that it should be carried i
out.
The Wolcott commission was a fore
doomed and expected failure. Nothing
can make this fact plainer than the ac
tion of President McKinley in sending to
; the extra session of Congress his message
of July 24. 1897. wherein he indorsed the
plan of the Indianapolis Sound Money
j Convention, which that convention de
clared consisted of three fundamental
provisions, namely, the maintenance of
the gold standard and the retirement of
the greenbacks and treasury notes and
: the erection of a huge system of banks
of issue.
The inglorious return of the Wolcott
i commission was followed by the pre
sentation to Congress of the Administra
tion's gold standard monetary scheme in
the weak and indefinite suggestions of
the President's annual message and in
i the more bold and clear propositions of
the Secretary of the Treasury. ,
Thus the Republican party stands to
! day as the avowed champion of the gold
standard and the banks. To its support
have rallied the gold brokers of the world
; and all other trusts and monopolies. The
: Republican platforms of 1884, 18S8 and 1892
i vigorously denounced these combinations
; of capital. It is a significant circumstance
; that the very convention which in 18%
surrendered the Republican party to the
gold standard left out of its platform all
reference to trusts and other monopolies
and prosecuted its campaign in partner
ship with them and by means of the cor
ruption funds which they contributed
The Republican National Committee in
its campaign text book in 1892 declared
that nine-tenths of the people were bi
metallists. This was true then and Is
true now.
The verdict of 1896 was a mistaken one
Trusting Republicans were betrayed by
the managers of their party. Events are
making daily clearer the absolute sur
render, of the party to these evil influ
ences. As the issue becomes more clearly
denned doubt of a righteous decision
grows less.
The sentiment of the country is with
us to-day for bimetallism, for the masses'
of the people are against the gold stand
ard, . the , trusts and combines, the i
organized greed of the world. .All
that is needed in order that we may
win is that ,we shall be united in pur
pose and narmonlous in co-operation I
Populists. Democrats and Silver Repub
licans must all unite in the campaign of
IS9B in order that the gold standard shall
not win with the division of its oppo
nents. â¢ - - F *\ â 
No party need surrender its organiza
tion. No man need abandon his opinion I
on certain other matters, but until the
advance of the gold monopoly powers Is
stopped and thrown backward there is no
room for any political, social or economic
regeneration in the United States.
And we shall unite. The efforts to di
vide us will fail. Tne hosts will -rally
again In 1900 upon the platform of 1896
and under the leadership of the stainless
and peerless hero of that fight, and to
gether march to a victory of the people,
for the people and by the people.

NEW YORK, Feb. 12.â The American
line steamer St. Louis, Captain Randle,
which arrived to-day from Southamp
ton, reports the loss at sea of the Hol
land-American line steamer Veendam,
Captain Stenger, bound from Rotter
dam to New York. The passengers and
crew of the Veendam were saved by
the St. Louis. At quarantine Captain
Stenger of the Veendam reported as
follows:
"The Veendam left Rotterdam on
February 2 with a cargo, nine cabin
and 118 steerage passengers and a crew
of eighty-five, bound for New Tork.
We had strong northwest gales and
high west and northwest seas. On
February 6, at about 5:17 p. m., ship's
time, being then in latitude 49 degrees
35 minutes north, longitude 20 degrees
1 minute west, the steamer struck a
submerged wreck or some wreckage
which tore a hole in the ship's bottom
and broke her propeller shaft.
"We found that our ship was making
considerable water, and at once set all
pumps to work, but, notwithstanding,
the water gained on us. In the mean
time all our boats were made ready, in
order, if necessary, that we might leave
the ship, as she was now sinking rap
idly by the stern. At 1:30 a. m. we ob
served the lights of a large steamer
bearing about east by south from us.
We made a signal of distress, on which
the vessel bore down on us. We then
decided, for the safety of the passen
gers and crew, to abandon the ship. The
vessel proved to be the St. Louis of the
American line, bound from Southamp
ton for New York. We hailed her and
reported that our ship was sinking and
that we wished to be taken off. At 1:43
a. m. we commenced to transfer our
passengers and crew, using three boats
of the St. Louis and one of ours. Our
men were kept at the pumps.
"At 4:53 a. m. on Monday everybody
had been transferred to the St. Louis.
When the last boat left the Veedam,
the ship was laboring very heavily and
sinking rapidly by the stern. The
transfer of the passengers and crew
took, notwithstanding the great diffi
culties and the high seas running, only
three hours and ten minutes and was
accomplished without the slightest ac
cident.
"As the wreck was a dangerous ob
struction to navigation, we decided to
set her one fire, was done. The
position of the wreck was then latitude
49.19 north, longitude 19.475. On board
the St. Louis we were warmly received
and the captain and his officers did
everything possible for our comfort. We
take this opportunity to express our
utmost gratitude also in the name of
the passengers of the Veendam."
The Veendam was formerly the
White Star steamer Baltic. She was
built at Belfast, Ireland, by Harland
& Wolff in IS7I. She was a four-masted
barkentine-rigged screw steamer, reg
istered 4036 gross, and was 418 feet
long, 41 feet beam and 31.9 feet deep.
Mendel Mandoff and David Devin
ishke, two steerage passengers of the
Veendam, both hainng from Voveno
Guberna, Russian Poland, told a Joint
story of what befell the ill-fated Hol
land-American liner, as follows:
"It was after 5 o'clock on Sunday,
and we were three days out, that there
came a terrible crash. We did not know
what was the matter. The women,
for the most part sick, sprang from
their cots and began to rush about.
They shrieked dreadfully. The ship
stopped, and from the rushing around
we knew that there must be some
grave trouble, and we began to pray
to God for his protection. Suddenly
one of the officers came into the steer
age and ordered all men on deck. We
obeyed and were put to work on the
pumps. The crew were bravr fellows.
Not a man would get off until all of
us were safe. When we were on the
St. Louis and found not a soul miss
ing we fell on our knees, some of us,
and thanked God. We have been
splendidly treated on this ship. We
have no clothing, only what we are
wearing."
Chaia Nyitka, who came to this coun
try with her father from Sushkovalen.
Kalish Guberna, Russia, spoke for the
women who were rescued.
"We were nearly all of us sick," she
said, "when the crash came. But we
became suddenly well. Our sickness
was frightened away when we heard
some of the men saying the 'Shema'
(Jewish prayer before death), and oth
ers saying the psalms, and we thought
that the end had come. When all the
men were ordered on deck we followed,
because we were afraid to stay where
we could not see. On the decks we saw
men at work at the pumps and felt the
vessel was settling. We strained our
eyes through the darkness to see ships,
but there were no ships. Then great
lights shot out, and they said rockets
would bring us help.
"For five hours we watched them
shooting up and then dropping into the
rough sea. Then in the distance we
saw a light. We thought it was an
other rocket, but the light burned
steady, and it grew faster, and the
lights in the distance grew many. In
the darkness there shot a boat, and we
were all saved."
The 118 steerage passengers were all
taken to the Barge Office. Of these
seventy were detained because of lack
of visible means of support. The cap
tain, officers and crew of the Veendam
sailed for Rotterdam on the Spaarndam
this afternoon.

CHICAGO, Feb. 12.â The anniversary
of the birth of Abraham Lincoln was
generally observed here to-day, by ex
ercises in the schools and by various
banquets. The principal banquet of the
evening, however, was the twelfth an
nual affair of the Marquette Club,
which was held at the Auditorium
Hotel. Fully 600 members of the club
were present and the speeches in re
ply to the toasts were received with
great applause. Ex-President Harrison
was the speaker of the evening, and his
address on "Abraham Lincoln" was re
ceived with enthusiastic manifestations
of applause.
President E. Q. Paulding, of the
Marquette Club, opened the exercises
with a brief address, and then intro
duced Congressman Boutelle of Illinois,
who spoke on 'Chicagoâ A Political
Storm Center." Congressman Boutelle
was followed by ex-President Harrison,
who said in part:
The observance of the birthday of
Abraham Lincoln, which has now be
come so widely established by public
law or by general custom, will more and
more force the orators of the occasions
to depart from the line of biography and
incident and eulogy and to assume the
duty of applying to pending public ques
tions the principle illustrated in the life
and taught in the public utterances of
t lie man whose birth we commemorate.
And after all we may be sure that the
great, simple heartod patriot would have
wished it so. Flattery did not soothe the
living ear of Lincoln. He was not un
appreclatlve of friendship, not without
ambition to bo esteemed, but the over
mastering and dominant thought of his
life was to be useful to his country and
to his countrymen.
No college of arts had opened to his
struggling youth. He had been born in
a cabin an<l reared among the unlettered.
He was a rail-splitter, a ftatrjoatman, a
country lawyer. Yet, to a" those condi
tions and associations he was a leaderâ
at the rail-splitting, in' the rapids and at
the bar, and in story telling.
In the broad, common-sense way in
which he did small things he was larger
than any situation in which life had
placed him. Kurope did not know him.
To the South and to not a few in the
Northern States he was an uncouth
jester, an ambitious upstart, a reckless
disturber. He was hated by the South
not only for his principles, but for him
self. The son of the cavalier, the men
who felt toil to be stain, despised this
son of the people, this child of toil. He
was distinguished from the abolition
leaders by the fairness and kindliness
with which he judged the South and the
slaveholder. He was opposed to human
slavery, not because some masters were
era el, but upon reasons that kindness to
the slave did not answer. "All men" in
cluded the black man. Liberty is the law
of nature. The human enactment cannot
pass the limits of the State's; God's law
embraces creation. Mr. Lincoln had faith
in time and time has justified his faith.
If the panorama of the years from IS6I
to ISR.T could have been unrolled before
the eyes of his countrymen would they
have "saidâ would he have saidâ that he
was adequate for the great occasion?
And yet. as we look back over the story
of the civil war, he is revealed to us
standing above all men of that epoch in
his capacity for and adaptation to the
duties of the Presidency.
Following Harrison came Justice
David J. Brewer of the United States
Supreme Court, who spoke eloquently
on "The Nation's Anchor," the court of
which he is a member. He was fol
lowed by Lyman J. Gage, Secretary of
the Treasury, who spoke on "Govern
ment and Finance."
Great applause greeted Bishop Potter
of New York when he arose to deliver
an address on "The Humor of Lincoln."
The reverend gentleman told many
anecdotes of Lincoln in a most happy
manner, and contributed greatly to the
enjoyment of the evening. The other
addresses of the evening were by Presi
dent Canfield of the University of Ohio,
who responded to "Education and the
Nation." and W. J. Calhoun of Dan
ville, 111., who replied to "Illinois."
Observed in San Rafael.
SAN RAFAEL, Feb. 12.-The anniver
sary of Lincoln's birthday was celebrated
here this evening by a meeting in the
Opera house, which was packed to its
full capacity and hundreds were unable
to obtain admission. The exercises in
cluded vocal and instrumental music by
school children and a number of ad
dresses. The oration was delivered by
G. V.'. Arbuckle of San Francisco and
the chief address by Captain Gorley of
this city.

BERLIN, Feb. 12.â The proceedings
in the Reichstag and Diet this week
were unusually interesting. There were
a number of significant declarations
from the minister members of the
Reichstag. The maiden speeches of
Baron yon Bulow, the Minister for
Foreign Affairs, have been approved by
almost the entire press, and the im
pression prevails in parliamentai y
circles that a vigorous foreign policy,
patterned after Prince Bismarck's, will
mark Baron yon Bulow's regime, par- ;
ticularly as the Emperor has expressed
entire approval of his methods. While
Baron yon Bulow's references to Kiao
chat] were enthusiastically received by
SVMi the Leftists, a passage referring
to Crete was the most important. He !
practically announced that Germany j
would not support Russia In any fur
ther compulsory measures In Turkey.
The utterances of Count Posadow
sky, the Minister for the Interior, es
tablished that the Government is fully
determined to support the Agrarian de
mands much more strongly than here
tofore. Count yon Kanitz, the extrem
ist leader of the Agrarians, proclaimed â 
this fact amid the plaudits of the Agra
rians and Rightists.
Herr Richter, the Radical leader, in
an intensely aggressive speech, said
this frankness was an advantage, as it
enabled the people to plainly see the
extent and boldness of the Agrarian
schemes.
Herr Bebel and other Socialists se- j
verely scored the Government for prom
ising its powerful aid in systematically :
raising the price of cereals in order to ;
enrich a small number of big land own- j
ers.
The Vorwaerts, in a scathing article i
headed "Broad Usury," takes the gov- j
ernment and the Emperor to task for ;
"now splitting upon the same commor- ;
cial treaties they thought the height â 
of wisdom a few years ago." The p]m- '
peror's statement in 1895 that he could ;
not help to make the poor man's bread
dearer as it would be equivalent to the i
worst kind of usury is quoted and con
trasted with his present attitude.
Count yon Kanitz also declared in
the Reichstag that it was not contra- ;
dictative that "there was not the
slightest chance of Germany's agree
ing to a treaty with the United States j
on the basis of the prevailing Dingley j
tariff and the ridiculous reciprocity
clauses."
The importation of Chinese coolies :
was also touched upon in the Reichs- :
tag. It was affirmed and denied that j
the Importation of coolies on a large
scale had been inaugurated by land \
owners of East Germany. It is learned '
that several syndicates have already i
been formed for their wholesale impor- >
tation. One syndicate, composed of i
land owners of East Prussia, has con- \
tracted for 1200 Shantung coolies to be j
delivered at their estates to compete i
with German farm labor before June i
6. Several similar contracts have been ;
signed.
Letters received from Kioachau show
that things are not peaceful there, as !
the Government professes. The Ger- i
mans have sent several expeditions into !
the interior to punish the natives for
outrages upon sentinels at outlying
points, and there have been several
encounters. In one case two Chinese
officers and a number of followers were
killed, and a Village has been destroyed
and a camp broken up. The Germans
sleep on their arms and fear a sudden
attack.
The Emperor on Thursday was pres
ent at the parade of the Fifth Regi
ment of guards at Spandau before
their new colonel, the Russian Grand
Duke Constantlne, and his Majesty
created a sensation by walking up to
his guests with his drawn saber and
saluting while saving in a ringing
voice: "Always friends with our dear
neighbor and co-laborer, Russia, I
hope."
At the luncheon afterward at the
officers' mess tthe Emperor drank to
the health of the Grand Duke, saying,
"To a future comradeship in arms."
The Grand Duke Constantine did not
respond and hardly touched his glass
wih his lips.

CONVICTION SEEMS SURE.
Jurors Afraid to Overthrow the Gov

Not Guilty.
Copyright, 1898. by James Gordon Bennett.
LONDON, Feb. 12.â There Is
little chance of the acquittal of
Emlle Zola. The mob would be
ready to lynch the jury, and the
soldiers are much more excited
than they appear to be. Dislike
for secret trial, however, is in
creasing, and should M. La
borle's eloquence exert an ac
quittal the Government is bound
to fall, In which case the army
may issue a pronunciamento.
The chances are decidedly
against such an overturn, but
there Is nc lack of funds for a
revolutionary movement. The
Jews are frightened and enraged
at th^ir position under the par
liamentary republic.
PARIS, Feb. 12.â We shall not see
tho t!ni?h this week of the burning,
ishingr, panting affair which for
- past has held Paris In a state of
hypnotism which overshadows every
.. in business and politics both, and
g such society embarrassment
in order to render society gather
possible In certain salons, host
- have given out the following
formula: "While sitting at the table,
speaking on the subject of the Dreyfus
question Is forbidden. This applies
not only to the Dreyfus affair, but to
all other affairs which are connected
with It and spring out of this ques
tion."'
What are Zola's feelings amid all
this? I asked him the question. He
replied: "The more people Insult me
and cry after me the better I like it.
I ha^e behind my chariot a horde of
insult^rs. I have always had them,
since I became known, and I fear
the day when I shall not be surrounded
by howlers."
For those who know Zola's pride
words may be an explanation â
partial explanation âof affairs. He
fears nothing so much as silence, and
lefense of Callas by Voltaire and
the pleading of Victor Hugo for John
Brown inspired him with the idea of
d^f^nding Dreyfus. He has wished to
be before every one, to have something
to do with everything, and not being
able to realize all the ambitions which
his prodigious will power for working
seemed to warrant, having refused to
become a Deputy because he was not
rat or, having abandoned the idea
mg received by the Pope, who re
fused him the entry of the Vatican,
and also of entering the French Acad
emy, which seemed not disposed to
open its doors, he considered that the
pedestal had been placed before him in
such a possible enterprise which inter-
I him and invited his sincere con
vj.-tions, an enterprise which attracted
him as a novelist, accustomed as he is
to follw the thread of darksome in
trigue. He believed, I say, in this role.
If he could expose himself to mortifi
cation and attacks he would also
achieve unique rank and universal
fame.
From the point of view of the no
toriety of the affair, added to his name,
he made no mistake, but perhaps he
has discounted the sudden changing of
opinion in France, which has not yet
been brought out. It is not likely,
but a. very curious observation concern
ing Zola was made to me in court at
thK- last sitting by a distinguished phil
ologfst.
"Look," he said, "at those slight
ataxic movements of the left leg and
that declivity of the side of the mouth.
.Are not these signs hardly yet notice-
able of the commencement of paraly
sis, the precursor of that kind of mad
known as folie dcs grandeurs?"
â  us hope this observation is only
a hypothesis, and not a diagnosis.
"What will be the end? It is not pos
sible to foretell the result. Many an
nounce an acquittal as possible, some
bet two to one, but seem more
animated by their sympathies and the
I eloquence of Zola's counsel. La
borie, which contrasts with the cold,
unpleasinp: speech of the Advocate
il, Van Cassel.
s- trerai points for an appeal have al
ready been taken by the defense. The
lonrtemnation of Zola will not stop his
. mis from attempting revision of
the Dreyfus trial. As to Zola's acquit
tal, that is rath"!- improbable after the
form.'i! evidence of generals who seem
to have made an impression on the
Jury. This ftcqdfttal would be the sig
nal for grave troubles. It would be
difficult to defend the person of Zola,
also. Outside Paris, the Israelites in
nces, especially Algeria, would be
. t to violence, which it would be
difficult to suppress.

M. Bertillon, the handwriting expert,
testified that Dreyfus wrote the bor

residence of Dreyfus in 1894 he would
prove It.
M. Bertillon also said that he had
copies of documents upon which his
opinion was based.
Replying to M. Laborie, M. Bertillon
said he could produce them only on the

This caused the Judge to remark:
"Only the Minister for War has au

"Then we are certain not to get it,"

THE BEAUTY OF A FIGURE.
T â ; ROM a little town in the South comes the story
of a woman named Crowâ whether a relict ot
*â  the justly celebrated Jim Crow does not appear,
But on her own hook she was a remarkable woman.
Mrs. Crow had done something contrary to the peace
and statures, so that necessity had arisen for arresting
her. This task was undertaken by two officers, and a
little later the turmoil began. She did not want to be
Â«i rested, and was a lady of determined character. Her
daughters were of similar mold. For does not a cor
respondent relate that one of the daughters "flew at
them like an enraged tigress with a big knife"? It
may be supposed that when an enraged tigress with
a big knife essays to fly the prudent would feel an
impulse to get away from there. An enraged tigress,
even unprovided with a knife, is no pleasant spec
tacle, but give her a big knife and set her flying and
she would be a terror. Hence the conclusion is
reached that Mrs. Crow was a remarkable woman.
The past tense is used advisedly, and is an emphasis
to the easily discerned beauty of the figurative lan
guage employed. While she and the younger Crows
were fighting, some of them probably like enraged
tigresses with six-shooters, her spirit took its way to
a new jurisdiction. The correspondent, however, is
believed still to be on earth, and we shall live in the
hope of hearing from him some more.
BUSINESS IN SACRAMENTO.
I" N RESIDENT STEFFENS of the Sacramento
L_y Chamber of Commerce was able to make a
* most encouraging report of the business and
progress of that city in his address at the annual
meeting of the chamber on Friday evening, while at
the same time pointing out how much must be done
in the way of public improvements, particularly on
the river, before Sacramento will have the full meas
ure of commerce and prosperity which her people
have a right to expect.
The rich extent of the fruit industry of California
is well illustrated by the statistics given by President
Steffens of the fruit shipments from his city. From
these it appears that for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1897, there were shipped from Sacramento and
adjacent points 4593 tons of dried fruit, 4505 tons of
canned goods, 1938 tons of vegetables, 1658 tons of
hops, and in 1897, from May to November, inclusive,
the vast total of 41,560 tons of deciduous fruit.
Along with these large overland shipments there
was in the city during the past year an excellent and
prosperous retail trade, due, as Mr. Steffens points
out, to the wages paid out by the large shops and fac
tories for which Sacramento is noted. By reason of
this the financial affairs of the people have been on a
solid foundation, and the progress and development
of the city have been steady and continuous.
All the business and industry now carried on in
Sacramento, however, only emphasizes the need of
river improvement, or, as President Steffens terms it,
"river restoration." The work is one which the Gen
eral Government should undertake, and the argument
for action on its part is now the more potent because
the State has appropriated $300,000 for the enterprise.
This display of State energy cannot fail to have effect
at Washington since it demonstrates the importance
which Californians place upon the proposed improve
ment, and accordingly the outlook for a Government
appropriation in the near future is now more promis
ing than ever.
It is gratifying to note the stress which the Sacra
mento Chamber of Commerce places upon this much
desired work. The improvement of the Sacramento
and the San Joaquinis the State issue of greatest mag
nitude now before the people of California. To pro
mote it there should be cordial co-operation among
all classes of citizens and in all sections of the com
monwealth. It should occupy the attention of
chambers of commerce everywhere and be kept to the
front so long as any portion of the river system re
trains in need of improvement or restoration.
While there is naturally a feeling of sympathy for
the man who swallowed a mouse, the mouse got
distinctly the worst of the arrangement. Evidently
the human stomach is less fitted than that of the
whale to accommodate lodgers, or else the mouse
lacks the power of endurance possessed by the
human as attested beyond dispute by the affair in
which Jonah obtained notoriety.
Tt is an accommodating burglar who will kill him
self rather than be captured. The preference of the
average burglar for killing somebody else is so well
established that the police ought to gratefully ap
preciate an exception.
In all probability there will soon be a settlement
with Canada of the Alaska boundary. All the people
of this country ask is that they may have a fair dea*
hue they do not go so far as to expect it.
WIPE OUT THE SCANDAL.
REPORTS from Chicago, published in The Call
yesterday, disclose a shameful scandal in con
nection with the management of the exhibit es
tablished in that city by the San Francisco Alaskan
Trade Committee. As matters stand the exhibit has
been virtually abandoned, the city discredited, and its
trade injured to an extent which will prove serious
unless immediate steps are taken to repair the wrong.
According to the reports the agents left in charge
of the exhibit have been guilty of almost every con
ceivable form of betrayal of trust. They neglected the
work required of them, they wasted the funds in their
hands they permitted some of their number to ad
vertise the business of a particular transportation
company to the disadvantage of other San Francisco
companies engaged in the same trade, they indulged
in dilations carried to disgraceful excesses, and
finally became so outrageous in their conduct that the
proprietor of the hotel in which they lodged threat
ened to turn them out.
It appears the neglect of duty and the debauchery
began as soon as the agents found themselves in
charge of the exhibit and the funds. When ex-
Governor Sheakley arrived at Chicago to direct the
work of the exhibit he found the committee's reputa
tion had been ruined, the funds wasted and everything
in such confusion that it was impossible for him to
do anything more than to dismiss the dishonest
agents, pay their bills, save them from expulsion from
the hotel, and then pack the exhibit off to railroad
depots and arrange his affairs to return to his old
home in Pennsylvania-
It would be worse than useless to try to cover up
a scandal of this kind. It might be hushed up in San
Francisco, but not in Chicago, and it is in Chicago
where the evil of it is felt. San Francisco has been
discredited there, the money her merchants sub
scribed to promote their trade there has been wasted.
The only thing to be done is to make the scandal
known here in order that our people may be aroused
to remedy the evil before it is too late. It Is to that
end The Call addresses itself. The wrong to the city
has been done, and we expose it for the purpose of
bringing about some action to redeem our credit as
speedily as possible.
There can be no differences of opinion among in
telligent men concerning the value of prompt action
in this emergency. The Alaska trade already active is
quickening itself for the great rush of the spring and
the summer. Experts estimate the rush will continue
for at least two years and will lead to the develop
ment of industries in Alaska that will bring about a
permanent trade of great importance. We must ad
vertise in the East to get that trade, and the Eastern
advertising must be done very largely in Chicago.
Every da^ f lost in redeeming the wrong done by the
agents of the exhibit sent there is a loss of money to
our spring trade and to the prestige of our commerce.
Immediate action should be taken by those in au
thority to investigate the Chicago charges and see if
there is not some way of punishing those who have so
grossly abused their trust. The offenses have not
been petty misdemeanors growing out of incompe
tence and idleness. They have been, according to the
stories, shameful outrages against decency as well as
morality. Such offenses cannot be hushed up and
should not be condoned. The Alaskan Trade Com
mittee will be expected by the public to act at once.
STILL UNEXPLAINED.
EVER since The Call requested Senator Stratton
to make an explanation of his extraordinary re
lations to the various litigants in the Harbor
Commission case now pending in Judge Belcher's
court he has been asking witnesses for the plaintiff all
sorts of questions bearing on the subject. Among the
witnesses questioned has been Mr. Slade himself.
According to the newspaper reports this gentleman
testified to having searched for Senator Stratton and
found him in the vicinity of Stow Lake, to having
employed him as attorney in some cases, to having
paid him for advice and to having listened to his
conscientious scruples concerning his relations to the
Harbor Commission and Slade.
Mr. Stratton has asked other witnesses about his
dual legal character without eliciting any satisfactory
information. He has not come forward with his own
testimony, nor has he, so far as we know, taken Judge
Belcher into his confidence. This is remarkable,
since there is no person in the world so well informed
upon the subject as he, nor so well qualified to pre
sent the public with a full, true and specific account of
the part played by him in the curious transactions be
tween the Dundon-Slade syndicate and the Board of
State Harbor Commissioners.
In default of his testimony, therefore, we are bound
to assume that Senator Stratton has been enacting the
part of a sort of Dr. Jekyll with the commission and
a sort of Mr. Hyde with the Slade combination. In
other words, while advising the former what to do
in the Paraffine Paint Company's and other cases he
has divested himself of all recollection that he ever
was the paid attorney and advisor of Mr. Slade.
While advising the latter what to do in order to get
contracts from the Commissioners or defeat them in
litigation he has blotted from his mind all recollec
tion of his obligations to the State. To act these
parts would, of course, require of Senator Stratton an
extraordinary control of his conscience, but in default
of a more complete explanation from him there is
nothing left for us except to assume that he would
have us consider him equal to the emergency.
We are not disposed to judge Senator Stratten
harshly; he is a reform Senator from Alameda County
and that ought to be sufficient to get him out of al
most any equivocal situation. But we respectfully
submit that he is taxing our credulity rather severely
when he asks us to believe that as attorney both for
the Harbor Commission and for Mr. Slade he could
look out for both parties at the same time. The tes
timony in the Paraffine Paint Company's case shows
that the interests of the two clients were antagonistic.
That is, the Dundon-Slade combination were getting
collusive contracts out of the commission to the
great detriment of the State treasury. Unless Mr.
Stratton can establish that it was a good thing to de
plete the State treasury in this way we shall be dis
posed to stick to the apparently absurd theory that
when he advised Mr. Slade how to carry on his busi
ness to the detriment of the State treasury he was
playing both ends against the middle and was ac
tually getting his fees out of the people.
We regard an explanation from Senator Stratton as
more imperative than ever.
The wires tell a story about a rich Californian who
deserted a home in the East long ago and who, going
back there, found the only survivor of his family to
be his daughter, who was being cared for in the
county poorhouse. Of course he took her out and
tried to make amends for a lifetime of neglect, but
this does not alter the truth that he ought to be kicked
clear back to this State and on out into the Pacific.
If Waller was glad to be indicted the fact of being
under arrest must fill htm with absolute joy.
THE SAN FBAKCISCO CALL, SUXDAY, FEBBUARY 13, 1898.
THE persistent recurrence ever since 1875 of the
financial issue in American politics points to it
as the one selected especially by all the rule-of
thumb politicians as the easiest to talk about and the
most capable of exciting the people. It does not
merely relate to the kind and quantity of money in the
country and the source tf its supply, but it furnishes
a subject which in its discussion enables attacks upon
ownership and an assault upon the laws that uphold
the rights of property.
The greenback movement was the earliest shape as
sumed by this movement. It rapidly ripened into a
demand for fiat paper, issued by the Government, a
full legal tender and irredeemable. This idea is still
in existence in the demand that the Government sub
stitute non interest bearing bonds as a means of
raising money in place of taxation. But all of these
ideas merge readily in the demand for free coinage
of silver at 16 to I. That policy is represented as
satisfactory to the fiatists, because the difference be
tween the bullion and nominal value of the dollar will
be fiat. All those who believe that more money is
needed are easily led to hope for a pecuniary flood in
the form of silver. Another class, who believe that
gold is the rich man's money and silver the poor
man's, join the ranks in the hope of despoiling the
rich and enriching the poor. Then there is a class
who insist that we must have a kind of money that the
bankers cannot handle, and they are enthusiastic in
the belief that the "white metal" will be too hot for
a banker to hold.
As recruits to the ranks made up of the foregoing
there are the classes who adopt, in one form or an
other, the ideas of the socialists, communists, an
archists and even of the nihilists. Free silver is the
captain in command of all this force in politics. The
advocates of that policy in Congress propose to
prevent any permanent adjustment of the financial is
sue because that will remove the cohesive principle
which holds these elements in fusion. Remove that
and their differences put them at angles which make
common action impossible. There is at present a
constant temptation to politicians to seek personal ad
vantage and get office by joining this combination.
The good of the country, the permanent foundations
of general prosperity, the constitutional limitations,
are not considered by these people at all. Facts
make but little difference to them. Even knowing
that if they get power they cannot perform all they
promise, they count with confidence upon their abil
ity to shift the blame from their shoulders and stand
acquitted by their disappointed dupes.
In this situation it is plainly seen that the friends of
sound finance, the men who desire to see the world's
financial center come where it belongs â to this con
tinent, richer in all resources than any other part of
the planet â must get together upon a common policy
and oppose it to the plans of the fiatists. It is not
so much a party as a public question. The President
adopts it as an administration policy because it is a
vast, far-reaching public necessity. If they are wise
the Republicans will make standing room on that is
sue for all men who agree that a sound money policy
must be pleaded in the campaign issues. We see sil
ver Republicans, who believe protection to be a pub
lic necessity, in alliance with silver Democrats who
will use their power, if they get it, to tear down pro
tection, and with Populists who will use their success
to tear down everything. In the emergency presented
by this alliance the sound money men of all shades
of belief on other public questions must feel that there
is room for them to meet in defense of a principle that
underlies all conditions and every requisite of na
tional prosperity.
There is probably nothing in the report that
Spain must apologize or be rebuked by the severance
of diplomatic relations with this country. Spain has
up to the present been permitted to do as she has
pleased, and there is no particular reason for suppos
ing that the administration lias experienced a change
of heart. If Spain were to bombard Key West doubt
less there would be something in the nature of a pro
test, but as it is peace at any price seems to be the
rr.le.
The freak who is on exhibition in Chicago where
she amuses and instructs by swallowing poison,
getting snake-bitten, having nails driven into her
flesh, and doing other things of an equally edifying
character, ought to blow herself up with dynamite.
She is unnecessary. The public can eat pie and ac
quire all the nightmare that is good for it.
A contemporary announces that as a result of a
shooting accident a gentleman has been deprived of
his pantella. The pantclla is a new part of humati
equipment, apparently, and it is to be regretted that
the only person provided with it should have
met with such a loss.
The arrest of ex-Senator Dunn for renting a room
to be used for pool-selling is a start in the right direc
tion. Experience has shown the difficulty of convict
ing a guilty man for this offense, and yet a persistent
series of arrests might discourage him to an en
couraging degree.
It would seem to be part of the duty of the gentle
men having in charge the Miners' Fair to see that the
couple married the other night in public get an early
start for the Klondike. It may be unkind to interfere
with a honeymoon, but the loving pair appear to have
been bluffing.
Whether or not a person who works for a living
shall be admitted to society seems to be a question
with a peculiar faculty of keeping alive. Nobody
outside of society cares what the answer to it may be,
and it ought to be the least of the working person's
troubles.
Kentucky shows symptoms of desiring to be the
scene of pugilistic events like the one enacted in
Nevada a few months ago. Evidently the State feels
that it is not living up to its reputation as dark and
bloody ground. Even its duels are now fought
through the papers at space rates.
Members of New York's four hundred are to give

THE FINANCIAL ISSUE.
WITH ENTIRE FRANKNESS.
Mr. Lynn of Oakland possesses ap
parent confidence in the theory that
the Lord commanded him to kill Mrs.
Lynn. The conclusion that Lynn is a
homicidal liar is the one naturally
drawn from the situation. There is a
lack of evidence that the Lord would
communicate with a creature of the
Lynn stripe, even if an exchange of
ideas were common between the Al
mighty and his subjects. There is an
improbability that an order contrary
to the peace would have been issued.
But granting that Lynn might have
received the instructions under which
he claims to have acted, certainly had
he done so he would have been clothed
with power to carry them out, and
would not have fired five bullets with
out fatal results. It seems to me the
best course would be to treat Lynn as
a dangerous criminal rathet- than as
one inspired. As a rule authority to
kill doea not come from heaven, but
there are reasons for supposing that it
comes from the other place. True,
Abraham thought he was told to sac
rifice Isaac, but the fact that he was
willing to do so is one of the darkest
spots in a record, which was more
than ordinarily reprehensible. Abra
ham should have been clapped into an
asylum or a jail, and this man Lynn
is no better. If Mrs. Lynn chance to
succumb to her injuries, then her as
sailant ought to be hanged with all
reasonable dispatch. If he was acting
on divine orders he will have nothing
to fear beyond the gallows, while if
spared he might get some more orders.

I have not the unhappiness to know
Ruth Ashmore. "Whether she is old or
young, single, married or a widow are
matters not of public knowledge, and
possibly of no consequence. Ruth
writes advice for girls, all of it based
apparently on the idea that girls have
mush where they ought to have brains.
If anything could induce a good girl
to throw discretion to the winds it
would be such stuff as Ruth drools at
her through the columns of Bok's
comio monthly known as the Ladles'
Home Journal. The worst feature
of Ruth's pious ooze is the undercur
rent of nastiness which is never ab
sent. So keen an eye has the lady for
the vile, so acute a scent for moral
decay, that she detects iniquity where
another would find innocence. She be
lieves man to be possessed of the idea
that every girl is legitimate prey, the
most ordinary courtesy a veiled insult.
She thinks that a young woman who
fails to resent the overture of mere
politeness has been lured to ruin. She
wants our sisters and daughters to be
a lot of vinegary spinsters treading the
path of life with no object but to ob
serve and rebuke the affronts lining
the way. What the gentle Ruth needs
is a clean mind. If she has a real re
gard for the young she will quit writ
ing for them. Her ebullitions of
bogus righteousness are disgusting
and corrupting. She <loes not know it.
I am forced to the conclusion that she
does not know anything. Yet Ruth
harmonizes beautifully with her en
vironment. The male Impersonator
who runs the concern is also sweetly
modest to the point of Indecency. In
the same issue in which Ruth demon
strates that there is no middle ground
between the prude and the outcast
Bok announces that hereafter there
will be nothing more printed in re
lation to styles in ladies' underwear.
The details, he explains, are "ex
tremely and pardonably offensive to re
fined and sensitive women," Noble Bok!
lovely women! The refined and sensi
tive will have to secure their under
wear without the guiding Intelligence
of a Bok, it might be said, the Bok.
Looking on a different page of the same
number I was surprised and made sor
rowful by observing that the reform is
not complete. There was a picture
there of a girl who had on an under
shirt and nothing more. Think of the
horror of it! To be sure, the picture
represented a tot of 3 or thereabouts,
but a tot grows, and in later years may
not the memory of this picture cause
her pain and blushes? Then a bed
shoe was not only described, but ac
tually portrayed. I marvel at such a
lapse into depravity. If a shoe, a foot;
if a foot, a leg; if a leg, then under
wear or influenza. Thus Bok sets a
trap where by easy stages we are car
ried to the forbidden topic. There were
female figures in corsets, over which
they gracefully bulged, with naked
shoulders and bosc-ms as bare as your
hand. I ask Ruth, I ask Bok, is it
right? There was an angel with noth
ing but the shadow of its wing -to
shield it from the eye. There was a
lass on a bike in a position plainly in
dicating that she had two legs, and
that with an abandon imperiling her
soul she had thrown one of them over
the wheel. There was a buxom kitchen
girl, with her sleeves rolled so high as
to show a round and wicked arm al
most to the top, and the glimpse of an
undervest. Ruth and Bok, their hands
clasped and their faces turned toward
the light, may be battling against the
hosts of sin, but they have still before
them the task of expurgating the ad
vertising columns.

The analysis of Joaquin Miller by
Ambrose Bierce, recently printed, was
one of the best things he has written,
to say which is to say much. Miller
is a poet, and as such his critic gives
him liberal praise. But Miller cannot
write prose, and he is unable to keep
out of such as he tries to write his
own unpleasant personality. I do not
know the thickness of the Miller hide,
but unless it is abnormal it has been
as thoroughly perforated as the lid of
a pepper box. The only regrettable
possibility Is that Miller may try to get
even, salving his wounds with the es
sence of bad English.
Objections from the editor of the Post

not notable for enthusiasm, yet among
them were enough acceptances to show
the scheme to be feasible. However, a
change in regular work deprived me of
the time I had expected to devote to
the letters, and the plan was dropped.
With the exception of one, the replies
received were courteous. That one
came on a postal card, a distinct gain
to the sender of 1 cent, over which I
doubt not he chortles to this day.
Thinking the yahoo needed a lesson in
manners, I returned his own card to
him accompanied by a little advice, and
then forgot the incident. Had it been
vaguely recalled memory would still
have failed on the point that the cor
respondence had been with Dune. Mc-
Pherson. I often noticed that he was
spoken of as a clown, dense, uncouth,
and in after years, that his paper was
the essence of stupidity, and yet the
Incident was not brought back. Not
long ago I wrote a bit of doggerel about
Dnnc, and 10, he comes to the front
with our brief correspondence, explain
ing by it the "animus." There was no
animus. I look upon Dune as upon
any other simpleton. It was easy to
realize that he was a dullard, but I
confess to surprise that he should glory
in the fact that my discovery was not
recent. Having neatly been branded an
ass, a man with a grain of sense would
have resented it, but here is the im
mortal Dune, proudly proclaiming that
he received the brand long ago, and
bringing forth exhibits to support the
allegation and establish the justice of
the branding.

The clergyman who the other day
said that prayer as an institution was
dying out, may have spoken hastily.
At any rate, people continue to pray.
In instances the act seems to do them
good. I have never been able to ob
serve that prayer had any effect be
yond this. It does not stay the flood,
nor turn aside the cyclone. The blis
tering drought defies it. Pestilence and
famine lay waste the land, nor pause
as the victims voice their fervent wish
es. Christian nations go panoplied for
war against each other, each side for
tified by the prayers of millions, and
each calling with confidence upon the
God of Battles. It is not logical to
claim that the right always wins, for
it doesn't, and frequently both sides
are wrong, so it couldn't. Political con
ventions are opened with an invocation,
and from the first word to the amen
every listener is planning how to break
the slate of his neighbor. In fact,
prayer is a fixed habit, and is so gen
eral as often to lose its sacred charac
ter and its "dignity. From my boyhood,
and I speak not with irreverence, it has
always seemed to me a presumption to
ask the Unchangeable to change, to
suggest to the Almighty how this little
world ought to be run. That the sea
sons come and go undisturbed, that the
sick die, the hungry starve and the
seed of the righteous beg bread, seems
an evidence that events are not direct
ed by human petition. There is
another side to the matter which
tends to detract from the re
spect naturally due. It is that so many
whose wickedness is flagrant pray
with peculiar unction. George Clark,
fresh from the murder of his brother,
flopped abjectly by his bed and prayed,
not for forgiveness, but that the peo
ple might turn to Christ and be saved.
The street evangelists who knee the
cobbles and try to raise their voices
above the clamor of traffic bring
prayer into the contempt bred of famil
iarity. They mean well, but they over
estimate their influence. The tendency
to pray is natural. The cornered rogue
sees in it a possible chance of escape,
the hypocrite finds in it a cloak, the
good think it brings them in touch with
the divine, and the careless may still
cling to the pretty custom learned at
a mother's feet. I believe the reverend
gentleman to be unduly alarmed. Peo
ple are bound to pray; they couldn't
help it if they would. As to results,
there will, of course, be differences of
honest opinion.

suppose Hamilton had reached the

CHESSâ Several Subscribers, Sacramen
to, Cal. These correspondents say: "Stan
ton's Hand-Book in Chess defines in rule
13 the penalty for an illegal move, as:
Ist. The move to stand as played. 2d. To
move correctly. 3d. To replace the piece or
pawn moved and move to king. Tn rule
17 it says: If a gieee or pawn be touched or
be played, when by moving said piece or
pawn the king would be in check, the
player must replace same and move the
king, and if the king cannot be movou
there is to be no penalty. A contends
that if a player moves a piece or pawn
when by so doing the king is in check, it
is an illegal move and if so wished any of
three penalties as provided in rule 13
could be enforced. B contends that in
such case it is an 'unlawful' move, but
not an "illegal" move, as in case the king
should not be in check by the action the
move would be proper, and further says
that the meaning of 'illegal' as governed
by rule 13 is to be applied to a move that
could not be possibly made, as for in
stance to move the castle like a bishop,
etc."
The answer to the above is: If a piece
be moved exposing one's own king to
check the move must be withdrawn, and
for penalty the offending, player must
move his king. If the king has no move,
however, or cannot move without placing
himself in check, no penalty can be en
forced under either of the rules cited.

after a desperate attempt to outrun
Officers J. W. Capels and C. Peters, all

rather than go to prison. The man's
untimely end was as tragic as it was
unexpected. Edward Solomon, the
confederate, is now behind the bars at

burglary lodged against him.
The story of the burglary and sui

"It was about 4:20 a. m. when I saw
a tall, heavy man who turned out to
be Solomon in front of Weber's store.
I crossed the street and asked him
what his business was there at that
time in tlv morning. He said he was a
baker out of work and was waiting for
a certain baker's wagon to pass and
tak>' him out to Ingleside. There he
said he believed he could get a place. I
did not think the tale true, but had no
reason to make any arrest.
"After searching the man and find
ing nothing suspicious on his person I
told him good morning and walked
down the avenue looking for a place
â where I could hide and watch the
man's actions. I met Officer Capels
and Special Rodriguez and told them
my suspicions. Rodriguez was in
civilian's garb and he walked slowly
up past Solomon, it having been ar
ranged previously that if he saw any
thing suspicious he was to sound his
â whistle and arrest him. When Rodri

his heels and Capels and myself barely
thirty yards behind and rapidly gain-
Ing. â¢
"Half way up the block the fleeing
burglar turned and sent a bullet whiz
zing past the head of Rodriguez. The
latter dropped on one knee and emptied
his revolver at the fellow, but failed
to hit him. He missed each time and
returned to arrest Solomon, who had
stood quietly in front of the store. As
soon as the special had done firing I
sent two bullets after Nelson, arid Ca
pels shot once just as the burglar was
turning to the right Into Powell street.
"On Powell, between Green and
Union, I fired twice more. When Nel
son reached Union street he was near
ly twenty yards ahead. He sped across
Powell street to the left and up Union.
He was around the) corner out of sight
for an instant, and then it was that
we heard a single shot. As we round
ed the corner in hot pursuit, there lay
the burglar, about fifty feet from the
corner. He was lying on his face, his
head being toward us. A bulldog re
volver lay near his feet, and the blood
was pouring from a wound in his
breast. He was dead."
The policemen then sent for the
Morgue wagon, while Rodriguez took
Solomon to the City Prison. He admits
that he knew Nelson, but claims that
their meeting at this hour so far from
home, both living in the same house at
512 Bush street, was purely accidental.
He sticks to the same "baker story"
he told before his arrest.
The policemen together fired eleven
times. An autopsy over the body of
the dead man shows that the bullet
from a 3. c -caliber revolver entered the
breast above the right nipple, passed
through both lungs and the heart and
came out beneath the left shoulder
blade. The man was a painter by oc
cupation, a native of England and 27
years old. He lived with a half-breed
negress at 512 Bush street. He was an
opium fiend and had an unsavory rec
ord, having been sent to the County
Jail on February 16, 1892, for petit lar-
ceny, and to Folsom on January 26.
1894, for burglary, under the name of
Silas W. Carter. He was detected with
another desperate character named
Chfrles Wilson in robbing the resi
dence of Mrs. Schofield, Attorney EL E.
Highton's mother-in-law, at 1715 Tay
lor street. He was discharged Septem
ber 7, 18i*7. Kelson was also one of the
three men who assaulted General
Barnes at an early hour on the morn
ing of February 23, 1593. When arrest
ed a few nights later these men. includ
i ing Nelson, were waiting at Jefferson
i square for Dr. Abrams. vVilson

! and has never been retake."i.
In Peters' statement one fact Is omit
ted â that there was another witness to
the skirmish, and the fact that the man
had shot himself, Edward F. Distel,
foreman of The Call zinco department!
Distel was on his way home, and had
reached the Intersection of Green and
Powell streets, when Nelson turned
into Powell In the race. P'-ters was the
; foremost pursuer and ran up to Distel,
; shoving his revolver into his face, with
j the remark: "Who are you?"
"No matter," was the response;
"there goes your man," pointing to
Nelson, fleeing down Powell street.
Distel also ran along with the officers,
i and bears evidence to the truth of their
statements that Nelson was around the
corner when the shot rang out. He
| was the first, besides the officers, to
i reach the body. Nobody else arrived
; on the scene for several minutes.
That it was a suicide is further
proved by the fact that tho revolver of
the dead burglar had three chambers
emptied, two having been discharged
at the officers, and evidently one at
himself. About six weeks ago he was
found in Gus Schultz's room, at 512
Bush street. Schultz having been ar
rested for burglary. At that time he

NOT FIT FOR WILD ANIMALS.
Health Officer Dunn Condemns Oakland's Vile
City Prison.
OAKLAND, Feb. 11â The Health Officer stated to-day that unless something
be done with the City Prison he will proceed to placard it and declare It unfit
for human habitation. This will make it a misdemeanor to put a man in prison
after he Is arrested.
"The present state of our City Prison ."said the Health Officer In his official re
port, 'Ms a blot on the escutcheon of Oakland. Overcrowded, low and poorly
drained, Infested with vermin that cannot be destroyed and permeated with
divers odors, it forms a very antithesis of the sanitary ideal of a prison. The
cells are all located in a cellar unfit for caging wild animals, not to speak of
confining human beings. The larger cells are fearfully overcrowded, and all
are practically never reached by the rays of the sun. Thus the natural damp
ness of the place is made to ever threaten an epidemic among those confined in
the prison. One of these larger cells Is used for the female prisoners, and into
it are crowded all classes of female malefactors, no opportunity for segregation
being given. To reach the cells occupied by another classâ the morphine fiends,
one must wend his way through narrow alley ways to finally reach two dark,
damp and malodorous rooms, into which are, crowded nine or ten mor
phi-maniaos. No recommendations for alterations can be made, for the place,
h^ing absolutely inadequate in size and location for the purpose to which it is
put, nothing short of condemnation will suffice. Therefore, I pray that the City
Council of Oakland will, as soon as possible, set about the building of a new City
Prison, in which the poor unfortunates confined within its walls can be hu
mannly treated.
"The most crying need of the City Prison Is a hospital annex, where sick
patients can receive proper medical attendance and care. At the present sick
prisoners are kept in the same or similar cells and subjected to the same dis
comforts as are the healthy.
"Thus there is no possibility of giving them that careful attention, or of
placing them amid those sanitary surroundings that are of such paramount
importance in the treatment of disease.
"Therefore a malady, which would be trivial if properly treated, frequently,
on account of the present lack of facilities, assumes an aspect of the gravest
danger."
Mayor Thomas has declared that the place is not fit for dogs, and says it
compares unfavorably with the Pound.
This afternoon Attorney Garrity stated that he intended to swear out a writ
of habeas corpus on behalf of his client, Charlie Lee, an Americanized Chinese,
who forges checks. He will use as his evidence the reports of the Mayor and of
successive Grand Juries and of Health Officer Dunn. While it is not doubted
that this will be sufficient evidence to secure the release of the prisoner, it will
only end in his being transferred to the County Jail, as his crime is a felony.
A special committee of the City Council, composed of Messrs. Cuvellier, Fl
busb and Upton, is now investigating the condition of the City Prison, as a re
sult of the communication recently sent to the Council by Mayor Thomas, and
it is probable that something will be done immediately.

NEW CLERGY HOUSE FOR HAYWARDS.
OAKT,AND. Feb. 12.â A real estate transaction was closed to-day at Hay
wards by which Rev. John A. Lally has acquired a splendid church property,
on which is a dwelling, that will in future be used as the clergy house of the
parish.
Rev. Father L,ally has only been a few weeks in charge of the parish at Hay
wards, but he has already laid the foundation for extending the scope of church
work. The town has long needed a clergy house, and Father Lally at once set
about acquiring one. He entered into negotiations with John Ruppricht and se
lected a plat of two and a half acres adjoining the church. There is a modern
dwelling on this property, and to-day the purchase was completed, and will be at
once used for the needs of the parish. It is the intention of the pastor to
erect in the future a new church that shall be large enough for the growing
town, and a convent school is also to be erected.
The site Is one of the finest in town, and ts located on a hill, from which
can be seen the bay and adjoining towns. It is considered one of the best church
properties in Alameda County. Father Lally came to Haywards from Half

would pose in several different styles,
weighing the chances of being found in
successive mental evolutions and meas

persecuted spectators would force upon
his mind a recollection of where he was
and the ball would be thrown. Lannigan
has speed, however, but the ball must be
thrown before it can be appreciated. His
work was successful, for he sent few to
bases on balls and retired many.
On the part of Stanford the game was
devoid of errors; five were charged to the
alumni account.

was successfully carried out. A large
number of school children participated
and helped to make the occasfon a suc
cess. The Horace Mann, Hamilton,
Burnett, Afission and Hearst schools
were represented by their drill corps,
and in addition to these there were del
egations from the other schools of the
city. The drilling of the different
schools was excellent and greatly en
joyed by the crowd. Miss C. F, Starke,
of the Hearst Grammar School, read
Lincoln's Gettysburg address, and there
was singing by a boys' quartet. All
the school children sang "America"
with great effect.
The management of the Fair is par
ticularly pleased with the action of C.
L. Barrington, of the Board of Edu
cation, in granting their request that
the children of the different schools be
given on certain days a half holiday
in which to visit the Fair. A schedule
has been arranged for the various
schools, and Tuesday will be the open
ing day, at which time the pupils of
the Jefferson, Adams, Agassiz, Bernal,
Broadway, Buena Vista, Burnett and
Longfellow schools will visit the Fair.
A souvenir spoon will be presented to
each lady who visits the Fair this af
ternoon.

MINISTER
COOPER IS
NOW SILENT
Refuses to Talk in
Reference to the
French Cable.
The Visit of the Warship
Caused the Scheme to
Be Public Gossip.
Hawaii Receives a Reply From
the Japanese Govern
ment.
ARBITRATION IS ACCEPTED
But There Is a Hitch as to the Num
ber of Arbitrators to Settle
the Dispute.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU. Feb. 15. â Minister
Cooper refuses to say anything in ref
erence to the French cable scheme, but
the matter is now common gossip here.
The Government has at length re
ceived a rei>ly from the Japanese Gov
ernment through Minister Shimamura.
The contents of it, as obtained from
the two diplomats, may be briefly con
densed. The principle of arbitration
is accepted, but the details are matters
of controversy still, and are likely to
be for some months to come. Both
Ministers claim that there is cordiality
and rapprochement in the dispatch, but
there is one point upon which, appar
ently, neither Government is willing
to recede at present, and that is
supposed to be the character of the
Court of Arbitration. Japan probably
wants one arbitrator and Hawaii
three.
The two Ministers agreed on one
point, and that was that it was inex
pedient to make public the details un
der consideration. The whole of the
correspondence between the two Gov
ernments up to December 31, 1597, will
be published by the Minister of Foreign
AffairÃ and presented to the Legislature
cm the 16th.
Minister Cooper states that the Gov
ernment has considered no plans for
the future conduct of the Government
in the event of annexation being de
feated, and if we are annexed the sug
gestions will naturally proceed from
Washington. It is understood, howev
er, that should annexation be defeated
during the session of the Legislature, \
propositions will be brought before that
body to broaden the eonstitutiu-n and j
enlarge the power of the people.
The following statement published in \
the Independent is supported by relia- i
ble evidence:
The Mormon church In Utah and the
representatives of that State were puz
zled some months ago. A petition trom
the large colony ot Hawaiians in the
State ot Mormons favoring the annexa
tion of Hawaii was presented to the Sen
ators and Representatives of the State.
Shortly after another petition, signed by
every decent member of the Mormon
church in the Hawaiian islands, in which
the petitioners in forcible and touching
language opposed the annexation scheme,
was received by the Senators and repre
sentatives of L tah and by the head of
the church which claims 9CWO adherents in
Hawaii. Upon investigation it was
learned that the leading Hawaiians at
Salt Lake City were blinded by promises
of lands and privileges } n Hawaii by
emissaries from this Government if they
could get up an annexation petition
among the Hawaiian Mormons. The men
were tempted, forgot their honor and
their fealty to their native land and
their Hawaiian brethren, only to learn
later on that the promises of their un
scrupulous tempters were idle and value
less, and that they are now being laughed
at for being duped and led into a dishon
orable bargain. A Mormon elder has
been sent here, evidently by the same
syndicate, and the Hawaiians who belong
to that church will be asked to change
around and join the fold of the annexa
tionists. The elder will find that his
smooth words, his promises and his cre
dentials will not help him in his unholy
mission. In Laic. where he now is, he
will get the Klondike heart. Not one Ha
waiian could he find here to follow him
on his annexation expedition.
At a brief meeting of the Cabinet
some correspondence relating to the
establishment of a French line of
steamers was read.
The steamers are to be put on very
shortly now, and will run from New
Caledonia, Tahiti and other French
possessions in the South Pacific to
Honolulu. Honolulu will be the ter
minal point of the new line. It is sur
mised that Honolulu will be made the
supply point for all the French Islands.
Mails, freights and other goods for the
people residing on these possessions
will be brought to Honolulu from Can
ada and the United States to this port.
Here they will be picked up and carried
to the different islands.
The government would only give out
the most meager information concern
ing the enterprise. From whom the
correspondence was received could not
be learned, but it is probable that the
French government is interested in the
new line.
The news of the establishment of the
new line of steamers is hailed with de
light by the merchants and residents
in Honolulu. A line of steamers such
as the one proposed means many thou
sand dollars of revenue in each year.

MURDERER BUNKOED
FOR A CONFESSION
The Examiner Offered Frank Belew
Two Thousand Dollars to Own His
Guilt and Has Not Paid the Bill.
Fairfield, February 12th.
Frank Belew, now confined in the County Jail, being duly
sworn, states that he was visited in jail on February 4th by John
F. Conners , representing the San Francisco Examiner. He further
states that said Conners, for and on behalf of the said Daily Exam
iner, made him several offers of money if he would confess that he
poisoned his sister and brother; that an of f er of the sum of $500
was refused, whereupon divers offers were made, finally culminat
ing in a specific promise to pay said Belew the sum of Two Thousand
Dollars if he would make said confession. Believing that the sum
offered would be paid as promised and being in sore need of friends
and money, the said Belew, hoping thus to be rewarded by The Exam
iner, and believing in the representations and promises of its said
agent , John F . Conners , did on the day following make certain state
ments relative to the crime, and did consent to acquiesce in such
reports thereof as the said Conners might write for his paper.
Said Belew further testifies that he has not received a cent of
the promised reward from Conners or The Examiner.
Signed
Subscribed and sworn to before me this 12th day of February,
1898.
(Seal)
The integrity of Belew's affidavit will
not be questioned by anybody familiar
with the circumstances. From the mo
ment the man was arrested he was
aware that his guilt was known. He
had admitted It in advance, and had
been betrayed. In conversation with a
representative of The Call he again
admitted his guilt, but did so inadvert
ently. He then virtually made a prom
ise that he would tell all about it. No
inducement was held out to him. He
was simply asked if he did not think
that such a course would ease his mind
and possibly create a little sympathy
for him. In this mood he was left.
Shortly afterward an Examiner
man, accompanied by a deputy named
Fitzpatrick, visited the prisoner and
remained for some time. Fitzpatrick
JUST FOR THE
"FUN OF IT"
Daughter of Millionaire
Northam Going on
the Stage.
The Young Lady Has Grown
Weary of Her Act in
Society.
As She Is Under the Wing of Mme.
Modjeska a Bright Future
Awaits Her.
Special Dispatch to Tho Call.
NEW TORK, Feb. 12.â Another "mil
lionaire's daughter" has quit society
and taken to the stage, and this time
not because of dear papa's financial re
verses, but simply for the "fun of the
thing," for love of the footlights and
of the boards immediately behind them.
The young woman is pretty, and her
rather irate father is a multi-million
aire of the Pacific Coast, R. J. Nort
ham. The young lady is his daughter
Maud, who will play Therese in "Mac
beth" on Monday at the Fifth-avenue
Theater.
Mr. Northam is one of the very
wealthy men of California, and has
enormous ranches near Los Angeles,
where he and his family spend much
of their time. One of these adjoins
that of Mme. Modjeska, and an inti
macy sprung up between the actress
and the Northams.
The young girl broached the subject.
] of her desire to go on the stage, and
it was discussed between Mme. Mod
jeska and Miss Northam's family. Miss
Xortham frankly avowed to-day with
reprehensible slanginess that she
! "grew deadly tired of the society act
and wanted to do some work. Not hard
I word, of course â I loathe that â but
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 1898.
is of the type best described by the
word "bulldozer." He is understood to
have killed his man, and he it was who
had held a pistol on Belew when the
handcuffs were being put in place on
the lonely ranch at the time of the ar
rest. Belew hated him, but was afraid
of him. He had also expressed a sense
of disregard for the Examiner man,
but the pressure was too strong. Be
tween the bullying and the cajoling, he
yielded the old story that The Call
had had in type days before. He was
anxious to unburden his mind. The
only reason the Examiner had so much
trouble in getting him to do so was
that he distrusted it. To almost any
body else he would have talked freely
then.
But the Examiner's representative
just nice easy play work, wearing love
ly gowns in impossibly hideous draw
ing rooms (stage drawing rooms al
ways are hideous) and reciting lines
when I can get them. I've got some
of them and hope to get more. I mean
to work and do as well as I can.
"If it was not that my parents know
Mme. Modjeska so well they never
would let me have my way, but T travel
in her private car, put up at the same
hotels and altogether am to be quite
under her wing. I've 'tried it on' upon
the stage, and like it immensely. My
father was opposed to it, and wants me
to give it up. He won't write to me
and says he won't send me any money.
But he gets over that by giving my
mother plentyâ which, of course, she
sends to me. Perhaps he will relent
when I do something on the stage
worthy of good newspaper notices. As
I have a pretty good voice, I'll have
notices set to music, so I can sing them
to managers when I go looking for a
â place.' That will be a new idea, won't
it?"
Miss Northam is treated by Mme.
Modjeska and her husband almost as
an adopted child, for she tours and
travels with them more as one of their
own immediate party than any mem
ber of the company.
SHORTAGE IN
THE ACCOUNTS
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALINAS, Feb. 12.â The Grand Jury
of Monterey County, which .has been
in session in this city for the past week,
made a partial report to Judge N. A.
Dorn to-day. The Judge, not having
appointed other grand Jurors to take
the places of the members of this one,
they were only temporarily dismissed.
Four indictments were found. Ex-
County Tax Collector Charles L. West
lake was found short $7030 54 In his
accounts for the years 1895 and 1896,
and the District Attorney was instruct
ed to take proper proceeding to collect
that amount.
This makes the sixth indictment
brought against Westlake. At the last
sitting of the Jury in January It found
the ex-Tax Collector short over $8000.
He was then under four indictments for
shortages aggregating about $950 for
county licenses, had been tried and ac
quitted on one charge and was about to
stand trial for another. The trial was
for a shortage of about $200, and after
a long deliberation the jury was dis
charged, nine favoring for acquittal.
He will be tried on March 7 on the
same charge.
County Assessor W. A. Anderson was
found to be short in his accounts. The
Assessor's accounts for the year 1896
show a deficit of $819 85.
This amount was, however, allowed to
be paid by Mr. Anderson. A search
ing examination failed to show any in
tention on the part of the Assessor to
defraud the county, and the Grand
Jury exonerated him of criminal in
tent. This is the second shortage that
has been found in the Assessor's office.
The last report of the Grand Jury
showed a deficit of over $1000 in An
derson's accounts, but he was allowed
to make this good.
It was thought by some that further
charges would be brought against
County Auditor George S. Miller, for
at the last meeting of the jurors they
charged him with willful neglect of of
fice, and papers were filed against him.
The matter is now under advisement by
Judge Dorn.
The Grand Jury authorized the ex
perting of some officers' accounts for
the Dears 1894 and 1895.
had to hold out golden promises which
he had not the slightest idea of keep
ing. He made futile pledges which
wrung from the despairing wretch a
familiar story, even at that time, com
mon property. Whether Fltzpatrick
lent himself to the scheme, or was pur
chased, is not exactly known, but if a
price was named for his useless ser
vices he is in a more advantageous po
sition to collect than the poor dupe
who was swindled out of the story of
crime. It is the consensus of legal
opinion that a confession extorted by
fraud and threat is without value, and
as the facts were already well known,
the only thing accomplished by the
Examiner beyond making a display of
itself was to cloud the situation and
throw obstacles in the path of justice.
ANNEXATIONISTS
ABANDON HOPE
Cannot Get the Votes
Necessary to Pass
the Treaty.
After All the Speeches Are Fin
ished the Measure Will
Be Withdrawn.
It Is Now Evident That Hawaii and
Cuba Will Have to Be Con
sidered Jointly.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. 12.
The friends of the annexation of
Hawaii, In the Senate, have abandoned
hope of ratifying the treaty. They lack
four votes of the necessary sixty, and
they see no way at present in which
these can be secured. Had they been
able to decide upon the course to be
pursued in the event of the defeat of
the treaty they would force a vote at
once or else withdraw It. But they
have let the discussion run on in the
hope that the sky might clear.
There are still several speeches to be
delivered in executive session, and
there is no present Intention of at
tempting to cut these off, but nothing
further will be done toward putting the
treaty through.
It is believed that when the qtiestion
comes up in open session it will give
rise to as much debate as has already
taken place. The opponents of annex
ation are confident that their case im
proves with argument and that the dis
cussion would have an effect on pub
lic opinion favorable to them. Never
theless, the members of the Foreign
Relations Committee will bring the
question up as soon as they can de
vise how it can be brought up.
Senator Chandler and Senator Mor
gan are of the opinion that the Cuban
and Hawaiian question ought to be
joined when it comes to positive leg
islation, and Senator Mason served no
tice in his speech this week that he
was for Cuba first.
This is r problem that the friends of
annexation will have to mcct â ho.w to
get a joint resolution through without
having it ineumbered with a Cuban
resolution. It is thought that Speaker
Reed cannot prevent the House from
adopting a double resolution on Cuba
and Hawaii, and that the President
would give his approval.

STRUCK DOWN
BY ASSASSINS
Charles Collins' Corpse
Found Near Santa
Monica.
Suspicion Falls Upon a Neigh
bor, Who Is Placed
Under Arrest.
Evidence Indicating That the Victim
Was Murdered for His Paltry-
Savings.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
SANTA MONICA, Feb. 12.â The body
of Charles Collins, a well-known car
penter of this place, was found 'to-day
in the sandhills south of the town. The
top and back of the skull had been
crushed in, evidently with an ax,
hatchet or heavy timber. Collins was
building a house for himself and occu
pied a tent on his lot not far from the
spot where his body was found. His
nearest neighbors were Peter Garcia
and family. They had lived on a part
of Collins' land, but their house had
recently been moved off to make room
for his improvements.
Mrs. Garcia, a not very prepossessing :
woman, seemed not at all surprised i
when told of the murder. It might
have been an everyday occurrence, for
all of the interest she manifested. She
immediately* declared, however, that
Collins was building the new house for
her, and claimed she had loaned him i
$50, part of which he had repaid. She
said he had told her last night that he
was going to Los Angeles, and would
not be home until Monday. His effects
seem to disprove this assertion, as his
valise was open and his effects strewed !
about, and his carpenter tools lay
about just where he had used them.
The body was discovered by two
women, and Marshal Dexter was noti- j
fled. It' lay face down, with the right
arm underneath. There was no evi
dence of a struggle. One theory is that
he was murdered in his tent and the
body carried to this place, yet the con
ditions indicate that ho fell there.
Tracks of two persons led to the place,
and the tracks were deep In the sand,
as though the pair might have carried
a heavy load. On each side of the body
was a depression, as though some one
had knelt in the sand. Collins' watch
chain was broken and the watch gone.
He had no money upon him, although ]
when he paid a lumber bill two days
ago, he was seen to have a number of
$20 gold pieces.
Suspicion fell at once on Garcia. It
is reported that he pawned a saw be
longing to Collins last night, and this
morning redeemed it. He was then
seen to have a $20 gold piece in his
possession. It was discovered that he
had paid a small bill or two.
He could not be found until this even
ing, when the officers took him into
custody. It is thought he had been in
Los Angeles. He was wearing new
shoes and a new pair of overalls and
had $2 30 in his possession. As 30 cents
would be more than he ordinarily had,
and, especially, as he had been drink
ing, appearances were against him.
He did not ask what was wanted of
him. When he was taken to the
morgue Constable Myers struck a
match. Although the corpse was seem
ingly unrecognizable, the arm over the
blood-stained face, when they asked
him if he knew the man he immediate
ly answered:
"Yes, that is my neighbor."
It is hardly possible that he could
have heard of the murder. His house
is guarded and will be thoroughly
searched for more incriminating evi
dence. It is not known whether Col
lins has a family or not, as he has al
ways been alone here. Mrs. Garcia
says that he has a daughter, but she
does not know where.

Fifteen hundred people went out to In

They saw lots of it and of all sorts. The
Eastern dogs of Dr. yon Hummel tired
them in the start. The talent looked upon
Prince of Fashion as a "pipe" over Yon

Prince at 2to 1. Even the doctor him
self had little faith in Van Neda and
played her for but a few dollars. She
won from the PrFnce with ease. The
latter seemed averse to killing and threw
away at least two opportunities.
Then Yon Hummel's crack Yon Brulle
came out against the so-called scrub, Nel

she is, scrubs are valuable. She turned
down the Eastern flyer and was back in
her kennels without wetting her coat.

WILL PROBABLY RECOVER.
George B. Sperry Resting Easily at
the French Hospital After a
Successful Operation.
Present indications point favorably to
the ultimate recovery of George B.
Sperry frojn the wounds inflicted by an
accidental explosion of a shotgun while
on a hunting expedition in Martn County.
The sufferer, who is at present lodged
in one of the wards at the French Hospi
tal in this city, is resting easy and there
are no immediate indications of blood
poisoning or erysipelas setting in, which
means a speedy mending of the shattered
leg.
Upon the patient's arrival in the city
yesterday afternoon from Olema, where
the accident took place, he was imme
diately taken to the hospital and placed
in the hands and under the care of Dr.
Putnam, the resident physician.
He was instantly placed on the operat
ing table upon his conveyance here and
an anesthetic administered. The shat
tered knee cap was hastily examined and
the wound, which had been dressed by a
country physician soon after the ac
cident occurred, reopened and thoroughly
cleansed. The wound was then restitched
and the entire leg placed in a plaster-of
paris cas_t, after which the patient was
consigned to one of the large rooms ad
joining the main ward.
Dr. Putnam, speaking of the accident
last evening, said that every effort was
being made to save the injured leg, and
unless Sperry's present condition takes
an immediate change for the worse he
has sanguine hopes of a favorable re
sult of the operation and the ultimate re
covery of his patient. Owing to the ex
tremely vital nature of the wound, how
ever, no definite prophecy can be made as
to whether the leg will be saved or it will
be considered necessary to amputate.
CARMAN'S VERSION.
One of the Alaska Trading Commit-
tee to Chicago Gives His
Explanation.
The dispatch in yesterday's Call from
Chicago, in whicn the Alaska Trading
Committee was severely criticized,
brought forth the following explanation
from D. M. Carman, one of those whose
names were mentioned in that dispatch.
This explanation was made to those hav
ing charge of the Alaska Trading Com
mitteee's management in this city. It is
as follows:
"Referring to the article that appeared
in this morning's Call, D. M. Carman of
the Alaska Trade Committee said that,
while it was true that during the two
days that his troubles in Chicago necessi
tated his absence from the Chicago of
fice, some of the employes got on a spree
and, doubtless, did some very question
able things, however, not one dollar of
the committee's money was expended by
them in that way.
"Every dollar of the committee's money
was properly expended, and there is a
voucher for It.
"Of the $1120 received by him on account
of the Eastern trip, $214 50 was paid for
salaries, and the balance was expended
in payment for hall rent, posting the large
posters of the jubilee committee and dis
tributing literature in the towns and the
expenses incidental to the work at hand,
and all is properly accounted for, the bills
having been audited."
OBJECT TO THE ORDER.
Merchants' Association Addresses
the Supervisors on the Side
walk Stairway Matter.
The Merchants' Association has ad
dressed a communication to the Board of
Supervisors In reference to the proposed
license ordinance affecting the space be
neath the sidewalks and protesting
against the passage of the same In its
present form.
It is claimed that the order, unless
largely amended, would work a great in
justice on merchants, and the special
committee that was appointed by the as
sociation to report on the ordinance ad
vances the objection that the existing
areas under sidewalks and the stairways
leading thereto were excavated and con
structed at the expense of the merchants
and with the consent of the city, and
that It would be a manifest injustice to
impose a license fee under the circum
stances.
It is claimed also that the order dis
criminates against Market street, that
thoroughfare being the only one in the
city 100 feet in width.
Fell Dead.
An unknown man fell dead at 5:rW
o'clock yesterday morning while going
into a saloon at 1144 Market street. The
body was taken to the Morgue.

ACTARRH OF JHE STOMACH.
A Pleasant Simple, but Safe Effectual
Cure for It.
Catarrh of the stomach has long
been considered the next thing to in-
curable.
The usaul symptoms are a full or
bloating sensation after eating, accom-
panied sometimes with sour or watery
risings, a formation of gases, causing
pressure on the heart and lungs and
difficult breathing; headache, fickle ap-
petite, nervousness and a general
played out, languid feeling.
There is often a foul taste In the
mouth, coated tongue, and if the in-
terior of the stomach could be seen it
would show a slimy, inflamed condi-
tion.
The cure for this common and ob-
stinate trouble is found in a treatment
which causes the food to be readily,
thoroughly digested before It has time
to ferment and irritate the delicate
mucous surfaces of the stomach.
According to Dr. Harlanson the
safest and best treatment is to use af-
ter each meal a tablet, composed of
Disatase, Aseptic Pepsin, a little Nux,
Golden Seal and fruit acids.
These tablets can now be found at
all drugstores under the name of Stu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets, and, not
being a patent medicine, can be used
with perfect safety and assurance that
healthy appetite and thorough diges-
tion will follow their regular use after
meals.
Mr. N. J. Boober of 2710 Dearborn
street, Chicago, 111., writes: "Catarrh
is a local condition resulting from a
neglected cold in the head, whereby
the lining membrane of the nose be-
comes inflamed and the poisonous dis-
charge therefrom, passing backward
into the throat, reaches the stomach,
thus producing catarrh of the stomach.
Medical authorities prescribed for ma
for three years for catarrh of stomach
without cure, but to-day I am the hap-
piest of men after using only one box
of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. I can-
not find appropriate words to express
my good feeling.
I have found flesh, appetite and sound
rest from their use.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is the
safest preparation, as well as the
simplest and most convenient remedy
for any form of indigestion, catarrh
of stomach, biliousness, sour stomach,
heartburn and bloating after meals.

stomach troubles, by addressing Stu-
art Co., Marshall, Mich. The tablets
can be found at drugstores.

FITTINGLY CELEBRATED.
Li IS ANGELES, Feb. 12.â The an
nlversary of the birth of Abra
ham Lincoln was this evening
made the occasion of the second
annual banquet of the Young
Men's Republican League of Los
Angeles. A most enjoyable and enter
taining time was had by the 400 guests
â¢who gathered at the banquet table to
observe the natal day of the greatest
American President, and to hear again
the grand doctrines which he gave to
the world, and which are to-day the in
epiration of the Republican party of the
nation.
Music Hall had been elaborately dec
orated for the occasion. Everywhere
â were visible portraits of Lincoln, of
Grant, of Blalne and of the heroes and
plants of the Republican faith, pastand
present. At 8 o'clock the guests had all
been seated, and after a pleasant re
past Hon. A. W. Kinney, president of
the California State League, introduced
the toastmaster, Luther G. Brown, the
local president, who opened the "feast
of reason and the flow of soul" with
the following words:
THE FEAST OPENED.
ReroarKs by Toastmaster
Brown, League President.
"Fellow Republicans â In assuming
this too great honor. It is not my pur
pose to presume upon your patience
with any extended remarks. It is im
possible, however, to resist the tempta
tion to express in some slight ti
the intense feeling of gratification that
the unquestioned success <>f this aus
picious occasion must produce in the
breast of every one present. One ar.d
all, I bid you welcome, and may this
be a genuine Republican love f< ast.
"It was the purpose of the Young
Men's Republican League, in giving '
this banquet, not only to honor the
name of that exalted character whose
memory, like an inspiration, hovers
over us to-night, but also tir bring to
gether here a large concourse of faith
ful Republicans that we might be
moved to sink all party differences,
clasp each other's hands, and pledge :
ourselves anew to those great principles
of which the Republican party has ever
been the protector and the preserver.
I can say that we have succeeded be
yond our most sanguine expectations.
Never before have the Republicans of
this city either planned or exeeiu.
great an undertaking. It is without
precedent, and will probably remain
without a rival until the league gives
Its next banquet at the beginning of
the next Presidential campaign two
years hence.
"I say the next banquet, for the
T"ung Men's Republican League is
here to stay. Wo are ready and will
ing to fight the battles of our party.
for we know that when we are fighting
the battles of our party we are light
ing the battles of our country. This is
the opening gun of the fourth cam
paign in which the league has taken an
active and aggressive part. We are a
permanent institution, and a duly ac
credited part of the State League and
of the National Republican League.
We were represented at the last two
National League conventions, and will
participate in the State League Con
vention this spring and send delegates
to the National League Convention in
Omaha next June.
"We have no quarrel, or even any
Bpirit of rivalry with any Republican
club, save a spirit of emulation not to
be outdone by any in our zeal for the
Republican party. We realize that oth
er clubs are necessary to the proper
organization of the party; we bid all
euch welcome, and assure them of our
cordial cooperation in all plans that
will tend to the success of the princi
ples of the Republican party.
"The Young Men's Republican
League has no candidates for any of
fice from Governor down to Justice <,f
the Peace, but when the Republican
party, in delegate convention assem
bled, has nominated its candidates, we
will be with them till the day of vic
tory, fcT we know not defeat. Vnere is
but one thing that we iVm&nd, and
that thing we have a right to demand,
and that is that the best men in the party
be nominated to office. The league does
not desire to boss the party or to run
tilings, but don't ask us to fight a los
ing fight. Give us the best men, and
we will give you victory."
The toastmaster then caused patriot
:' lc. letters to be read from Republicans
prominent In the affairs of the nation,
among the authors being President L-
J Crawford of the National League,
Hon.- Nelson Dinglcy, Hon. Frank Mo-
Laughlin, Senator George C. Perkins
and Congressman S. G. Hilborn. The
sentiments in the various letters were
vociferously applauded.
Hon Thomas Fitch was then intro
duced and responded with a master
piece of eloquence to the toast "Abra
ham Lincoln."
In responding to the toast. "The Cali
fornia Republican League," Colonel
<;eorge Stone of San Francisco, among
other things, said: "The scope for
r.'jlitical usefulness of the National Re
publican League is not understood in
this State. There is no other political
organization possessed of such elements
f of strength and power. Its principles
are of the highest and its methods the
most dignified. The rule of non-inter
ference with local caucuses and con
ventions appeals to that large number
of citizens who, while recognizing the
necessity under certain conditions of
caucus manipulation, personally dislike
to engage in such work. The loyalty
nrifiy which the league always supports
regular Republican nominees com
mends it to the party leaders and all
true Republicans.
SAFE IN THE FOLD.
Senator Bulia Srjows Califor
nia Is a Republican State.
In responding to the toast: "Califor
nia a Republican State," Senator Bulla
proved by statistics the fidelity of Cali
fornia to the Republican cause, and
concluded as follows:
"Having demonstrated that Califor
nia has been Republican in the past,
has there been any such change of
litionfl as would tend to defeat the
Republican party at our coming elec
tion? I do not think so. The tariff
question will not be an issue in the
next campaign. That problem has been
solved, and s<> largely in favor of Cal
ifornia and her particular interests
that he would be a bold free trader
indeed who would advocate any modi
fication of the schedules affecting our
industrial interests, but should such
ification be attempted by the Dem
ocratic party it would redound largely
to the benefit of the Republican ticket.
Whether or not the IMngley bill has
restored the degree of prosperity which
its advocates claimed for it, the fact
remains that thousands of mortgages
in every State in the Union are being
discharged, and even though that may
be due in part to a shortage of crops
in foreign Jands while 'our own fruit
ful fields laugh in abundance,' a kind
providence has seen fit to bring this
about during a Republican administra
tion, and our party will be the bene
ficiary of this benevolent action of the
Almighty. Of course the currency
question is still an open one, but our
party is certainly in no worse position
with reference thereto than it was one
year ago.
"The only danger which has threat
ened us at any time upon that issue
was the defection of the sound mony
Democrats, or rather their possible re
turn to their own party, but the intro
duction and passage in the Senate of
the Teller resolution has emphasized
the fact that the issues of the last cam
pa ipn are not dead, and every friend of
sound money will see the necessity for
the same d"jrree of vigilance that was
required at that time to maintain the
honor of the nation. Thus we have
every reason to expect the continued
co-operation of all friends of sound
y until this vexatious problem
shall have been satisfactorily adjusted
In some way. Upon other national ques
tions, the Democratic conventions
throughout the different States have
Indorsed and declared their adherence
x<> the principles and declarations of
the Chicago platform, and upon these
Issues the pi ople one year ago emphat
ically declared their opposition to its
revolutionary statements.
"There are some things, however,
which Republicans must do. They
must act harmoniously, adopt a plat
form fair to all classes, nominate good
men for office, renounce ana denounce
all bosses, faithfully discharge their
political duties as citizens, adhere to
their patriotism and respect for Gov
ernment in all its branches, and organ
ize thoroughly and effectively for the
work of the campaign. These things
being done, I am unable to see any
sufficient reason why we should fear
the failure of the Republican party at
the next election, and I confidently
predict for our entire ticket, from Gov
ernor to Constable, a most glorious and
triumphant victory next November,
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 1898.
and that we may then as now rejoice
in the fact that California is a Repub
lican State."
ROLL OF HEROES.
Hon. F- R- Davis Pays Tribute
to Great Republicans.
The Hon. Frank F. Davis responded
as follows to the sentiment, "Our Re
publican Heroes."
"Mr. President and Gentlemen: The
field of heroism Is as limitless as
human endeavor. Wherever the
genius of man has crystallized human
effort into a system there shine Us
splendid examples. It has been the
creation of religion, of business, of po
litical life in all ages of civilization.
"Circumstances and exigencies cre
ate political parties. Into that new
creation as its essence of life comes the
burning: question of the hour. That
question may be as selfish in char
acter as what shall be the standard
medium of exchange, or it may rise to
the splendid ideality of human liberty;
but when that question, whatever it
may be, becomes vital and aroUnd it
gather the hosts which make a polit
ical entity, then dawns the day for he-
roic action. It is the glory and boast
of the Republican party that its he
n>es are the nation's heroes, and their
immortal names the common heritage
of the republic. The foremost figure
in the field is the pioneer hero. He is
born, reared, perfected under circum
stances of trial, and in the fire which
tries the hearts and souls of men. He
is the man of the ax. Beneath the
strokes of his arm fall the tangled
forests of human error, and he bares
his breast to the impending rocks of
human opposition. His the unfaltering
courage, the clear and well-defined
purpose, the never-tiring brain, the
never-ceasing progressive movement,
the unalterable faith in the certainty
of prevailing truth and the undying
hope that in the end all things will
work out for the welfare of humanity.
"Such in character was Abraham Lin
coln. What a birth and training for
the field of heroism. A log cabin in
the wilderness, a chore boy upon the
farm, a clerk in the corner grocery, a
struggling country lawyer. His sphere
of action the field of Western politics,
a farm wagon for a rostrum, the
scarred and worn toilers of field and
forest for audience, the political bat
tle fought by night and by day In
school -house, in open field, in country
church, on village square, and amid ail
the struggle for daily bread, with mis
fortune, sorrow, opposition keen, some
times almost overwhelming, the daily
and nightly wage. So born and trained
he came to wield the destinies of a
great nation.
After stirring eulogies of Lincoln.
Grant and Blame, the speaker closed In
this eloquent manner:
This hour of uncertainty demands the
genius of the hero statesman. The
crisis demanded and received the splen
did leadership of the Plumed Knight,
James G. Blame. Then was born the
watchword, "The American workshop
for American labor, protection to home
industries." Under the broad utilitari
anism of that gifted genius mark our
country's progress. Out into the wil
derness stretches the iron threads of
numberless railways; the whistle of the
steam engine, the roar of the forge and
the crash of machinery awaken the
echoes of the forest, and on the broad
fields of the public domain where wild
Indians and still wilder beasts have
made their haunts and lair rise the
humble cabin of the homesteader. Into
every line of human activity come
strength and prosperity. New fields of
action open, the unemployed millions of
other shores invited to participate in
our prosperity join the advancing hosts,
and the unfed and ill-clad millions of
the unemployed find he-nest work for
honest hands to do. The population
doubles, national wealth increases by
the thousands of millionÃ. capital finds
safe investment, and labor steady and
remunerative employment. It is but a
sketch, an outline. Time forbids more.
Tears for the heroes dead, cheers for
the living. Grant and Linco-In and
Blame have passed from the theater of
active life, but the field still demands
Republican heroism. In that field of
action stand the young men of to-day.
From their ranks must spring the he
roes of the future. The strength of the
Republican party is In its young men.
That strength is well founded. The
face of youth is ever toward the dawn,
and on the uplands of the rising day of
action it fights and wins its battles.
From the ranks of the Republican par
ty, as the hour shall demand, whether
for the work of the pioneer In new and
untrod paths, that of the soldier on the
field of battle, or that of the statesman
BY THE
YOUNG MENS REPUBLICAN LEAGUE OF LOS ANGELES
A BRILLIANT ORATION BY THOMAS FITCH.
n ON. THOMAS FITCH, in re-
I \ spending to the toast, "Abra
| I ham Lincoln," said:
*J It Is 89 years since Abra
ham Lincoln was born. It Is
nearly 33 years since he climbed to
immortality. We may now Impar
tially discuss his character and his
acts, for time wears out prejudices,
tranquilizes passions and induces
men to respect the integrity of mo
tive of those from whom they have
radically differed. If Wendell Phil
lips were alive to-day he would
propably incur no personal risk in
addressing an audience in New Or
leans. If Jefferson Davis were still
in the flesh he would certainly be
accorded a patient hearing in Bos
ton. The men of this generation
can scarcely realize that less than
half a century ago slavery was not
only powerful but popular in the
North as well as the South, while
those whrr claimed themselves in fa
vor of its abolition incurred social,
business and political ostracism in
the North, and insult, assault and
expulsion in the South. Few post
masters south of Mason and Dixon's
line would have delivered a copy of
the New York Tribune to a sub
scriber, and few subscribers would
have ventured to receive a copy of
it except in a sealed envelope. The
Northern man who Journeyed south
ward padlocked his lips when he
crossed the Potomac or the Ohio.
In the streets of Southern cities
slaves marched to the auction block
with the clank of their manacles un
muffled, but the voice of freedom
was hushed to silence, her dramas
were unpresented, her songs un
sung. A despotism more drastic
than that of Russia ruled in fifteen
States. The vast amount of capital
invested in slave property was ap
parently safely intrenched behind
barriers of Judge-made law, bas
tions of commercial power and bat
teries of social prestige. In all of
the Southern and in many of the
Northern States the great forces of
society were enlisted in the inter
ests of the slave holders. The con
servative influence of the churches,
always exercised in favor of exist
ing authority, was allied to the prej
udices of the slums against the ne
gro. The power of the banks â millions
upon millions of whose money was
loaned upon the security of human
chattelsâ was linked to the ambi
tion of politicians whose nomina
tion and election depended upon the
favor of the slave-holders. The en
ergies of merchants anxious for
Southern custom and the power of a
press seeking for commercial adver
tising were all massed against anti
slavery agitation. The millionaire
and the proletariat marched in the
lock step of comrades and bowed to
Dagon, and slavery officered onir
army and navy, ruled our courts
and Legislatures and Congresses,
dictated our foreign and domestic
policies, dominated our political
parties and selected our Presidents,
Pabinets, Embassadors, postmasters
and customs officers. Yet, even
with the combined power of all
these forces, agitation for the abo
lition of slavery could no more be
suppressed than could the waves be
stopped from dashing when the
Btorm king rides the seas, or the
earth be stopped frnrn quivering
when internal fires throb in her fur
naces.
Radical utterances on the one
side instigated utterances equally
radical on the other. A Southern
Senator characterized the constitu
tion of the United States as "a prof
itless compact with Northern mud
sills." while Garrison denounced it
as "a league with death and a cove
nant with hell." Toombs boasted
that the time would come "when
he could call the rail of his slaves
on Bunker Hill," and Seward de
clared that the hour was approach-
Ing when "New Orleans must cease
to be a mart for the bodies and
souls of men."
Yet, notwithstanding, the rising
tempest of agitation, the dormant
and drowsy conscience of the North
slept on, until the slave-holders
themselves aroused it by repealing
the Missouri compromise which they
themselves had enacted thirty-four
years before. Their action was bit
terly denounced at the time by men
of all parties, yet its logic may not
at this day be justly criticized, for
slavery was aggressive by that very
necessity of its nature which de
manded expansion as a condition
precedent of continued existence.
The world was weary of it. Pro
gressive civilization called for its
extinction. It was a relic of bar
barism out of touch with the times.
The nineteenth century had become
for it the enemy's country where
to halt was to die, and bo it defi
antly smote the nineteenth century
in the face and marched out Into
the open with drums beating and
colors flying. Then the freemen of
the North awoke with the spring
and roar of lions aroused from
slumber. Out of the farms and fac
tories, out of the forests and mines,
out of the shops and counting
houses they came. They formed the
grandest association of freemen
that the world has ever known, and
they named it the "Republican Par
ty." For it and its beneficent pur
poses the tongue of the orator has
been kindled with fire from the al
tar. For it the strain of the poet
has swelled to the sweetest song.
For it the sword of the soldier has
flashed along the line of victorious
armies, and whatever the future
may have in store for it, its glori
ous past will live as long as the
English tongue.
It may not always have been in
fallible in its selection of measures,
and it may not always have been
wise in its choice of representatives,
but its purposes have ever been
high and patriotic.
It was officered at its inception by
captains, whose names now stand
high on the rail call of fame â Sum
ner and Wilson and Fessenden and
Hale of New England; Seward and
Greeley and Curtis in New York:
Winter Davis and Cassius Clay and
the Blairs in the border States;
Chase and Wade and Giddings and
Trumbull in the Northwest; Baker
on the Pacific.
There were giants in the land in
those days, intellectual caryatides
who upheld their age. Small men
with large bank accounts had not
then excluded large men with small
bank accounts from the high places
of state. The pretorian guards of
politics had not then inaugurated
the practice of shamelessly selling
Senatorial togas to metallic acci
dents, whose dense and unsensitive
egotism made them unaware that
a seat in the United States Senate
Is not of itself distinction, but only
an opportunity to achieve it. The
passage of the Kansas-Nebraska
bill made no longer available the
honeyed glue of compromise with
which Henry Clay had bo often
linked repellant atoms in inhar
monious alliance, and in 1856, for
the first time in our history, the
forces of freedom and slavery were
aligned for battle. Candidates for
the Democratic nomination for the
Presidency were numerous, but the
chief contest was between Douglas
and Buchanan. Douglas was com
paratively young, ' his fidelity to
slavery had not been tested, the
Blave-holders needed the Keystone
State, and they selected the morally
cartilaginous and mentally unossi
fied Pennsylvanian as an affable
availability. Out of the ultimate
West came Fremont to lead the
forces of freedom. Pathfinder was
he, seeking untrodden ways in poli
tics as in the exploration of moun
tain and desert. With the light of
freedom in his loyal eyes and the
bronze of Western suns on the face
that never feared a foe or shirked
a contest, he led the Republican
party to a battle which, though lost,
yet proved the Bunker Hill of our
new revolution. The contest of 1856
was the midnight sun of an emanci
pated North, for its setting rays
glowed with the presage of a vic
tory that was to bring the illumina
tion of freedom to a nation.
Four years of fruitless struggle,
in which slavery vainly sought to
fasten itself on the new North
west, and then the hour of tri
umph arrived. A leader of
leaders was needed, and all eyes
were turned toward Illinois. A man
for the times was demanded, and
the God of the eternities presented
him in the person of Abraham Lin
coln.
He was the child of poverty and
toil. Not the hopeless poverty and
cringing toil of those who labor
amid the din of European marts,
but the manly submission to priva
tion, and unmastered toil of the
Western pioneer, whose eye of faith
beholds the star of hope shining
above the clouds, and who in his
dreams of the future drapes himself
with the Senator's toga or the
Judge's gown. Abraham Lincoln
was self-made and self-reliant, but
never self-seeking or self-sufficient.
He was honest, not with that nur
tured integrity which too often
proves an exotic that dies at the
first blast of adversity, but he was
honest by instinct, and because it
never occurred to him to be other
than honest. He was in spirit as in
fact one of and one with the peo
ple, and he needed no guide to find
the way to their hearts. He loved
liberty of action, of speech and of
thought, and in so far as his gener
ous and chivalric soul would suffer
him to hate anything, he hated tyr
anny and meanness and shams. His
was a personality so vital that it
cannot die, and after all these years
he seems a living presence rather
than a memory. He was a master
of speech, his passion and pathos
and humor were matchless, and as
as a logician he was peerless. His
iron-limbed syllogisms crushed
Bophisms as if they were eggshells.
His wit, his philosophy, his strong
saving common sense, his quaint
forms of expression have filled our
political literature with familiar
apothegms. What better rebuke to
dogmatism than the phrase, "Ev
erybody is wiser than anybody";
what clearer description of a repub
lic than "government of the people,
by the people, for the people."
What more complete destruction of
sophism than his answer to the con
tention of his opponent than slav
ery must be excluded from a terri
tory by unfriendly legislation.
"Judge Douglas," said he, "holds
that a thing may be lawfully driven
away from a place where it has a
lawful right to go." What annihi
lating sarcasm in his reply to those
who insisted that Republican vic
tory would entail negro equality and
miscegenation. "Because I do not
want a colored woman for my
slave," said he. "it does not follow
that Ido want her for my wife. My
understanding is that I can Just let
her alone."
His argument against secession is
stated in a sentence, "Can aliens
make treaties easier than friends
can make laws?" What grander
plea for liberty than his appeal to
Congress in behalf of the 13th
amendment? "In giving freedom to
slaves," he said, "we assure free
dom to the free, honorable alike in
what we give and in what we pre
serve. We shall nobly save or
meanly lose the last best hope erf
earth."
What more comprehensive state
ment of trie duty of the hour than
the familiar sentence, "With mal
ice toward none, with charity for
all, with firmness for the right as
God gives us to see the right."
There are many words of Lincoln
so fitly and grandly said that they
will burn In the sky of history like
fixed stars, even when the master
pieces of great orators shall have
vanished with their train of rhetor
ical splendors into space. There are
ideas of his which victorious arm
ies have placed upon their eagles
and carried to a grander fruition
than ever prophet foretold or poet
dreamed. Never was ruler or. rep
resentative truer to a trust than he.
His reigning animating purpose was
to preserve the geographical integ
rity and political unity of the
United States of America, and hia
determination to extend the bless
ings of freedom to every human be
ing dwelling beneath the shelter of
our flag was an outgrowth of the
original design. He never lost sight
of this purpose. He was conserva
tive when the premature adoption
of radical measures might have
alienated the wavering and weak
ened the Union cause. He was rad
ical when the power of time and
circumstance had crumbled the bar
riers of prejudice which for years
had obstructed the road to justice.
His individualism was never ab
sorbed or subverted even by the
genius and power of the great men
who daily counseled him. Without
being egotistic or dogmatic or stub
born, he was firm. He "took each
man's counsel and preserved his
Judgment." Without previous train
ing in the conduct of public affairs,
he was called upon to grasp the
reins of government when the char
iot of state was rocking amid the
convulsions of war. But he kept a
steady hand, and neither the terri
fied counsels of o'er-cautious con
servatism, nor the demands of un
thinking and Improvident zeal could
drive him from the road along
which he believed the safety of the
natio-n demanded he should guide
his countrymen. It was his privi
lege to select the best policy for the
time, and his gift of discrimination
was marvelous. He stands ap
proved by the popular judgment,
both of his times and of later his
tory, as seldom having made a mis
take. He was sometimes deceived
in his judgment of men, but he was
hardly ever at fault in his judg
ment of measures. Understanding
the American people better than
many men of more experience in
statesmanship, he never entertained
a doubt as to the final iss\ie of the
contest. When disaster encompassed
us and defeat hurled back our arm
ies, he called for more men. Sus
tained by his imperturbable trust
in the righteousness of our cause
and in the power and willingness of
the people to meet aft requirements,
he pressed steadily onward to that
perfect consummation of national
peace, unity and freedom which,
with the faith born of presence, he
felt would be sure to come, and
which he almost lived to see.
Shall we of this day not profit on
the performances of public duty by
recalling the life and teachings of
this patriot and martyr? On the
morning after the news came of
Lincoln's assassination, crowds
surged in front of the United States
Government buildings in Wall
street, and the air was charged with
panic. Then there arose upon the
granite steps a son of Ohio, who
years afterward worthily, though
briefly, occupied Lincoln's chair and
quieted the fears of the multitude
with a sentence now historic, "God
reigns, and the Government at
Washington still lives."
A month ago another son of Ohio,
emerging in triumph from a politi
cal contest, the mephitic odors of
which still poison the atmosphere,
paraphrased, and shall I not say it?
burlesqued Garfleld's great utter
ance by telegraphing to the Presi
dent of the United States, "God
reigns, and the Republican party
still lives."
Yes, our goddess lives, not because
of the result of the Senatorial elec
tion in Ohio, but in despite of it.
May she live hereafter as in Lin
coln's day, an expression of the
brains and conscience and patriot
ism of the nation, and not as a sat
rap, scourged and gasping and
weary at the chariot wheels of Plu
tus! May she live unswindled by
the hucksters of the caucus and
undebauched by the bawds of the
lobby! May she live with ears un
attuned to the clink of the briber's
gold and with brow unbranded with
the scarlet letter! May she live
with her foreign policy unshaped
by the magnates of the sugar trust
and her finances unruled by the
mouthpiece of a banker's syndicate!
May the harvest of prosperity which
her rule is bringing to the nation
not be blighted by the hot and
greedy blasts of selfishness while
the corn is still in the milk, and
may those who now control her des
tinies turn their backs upon Wall
street and their faces to the western
stars, and so guide our ship of state
that from his place above, Abra
ham Lincoln,
The firm patriot there,
Who made the welfare of mankind his
care,
Shall know he conquered.
in the halls of legislation, shall be born
as the hour demands new Lincolns, new
Grants, new Blames, to guard the eter
nal welfare of the republic.
Hon. H. C. Gooding, Hon. R. J. Wat
ers and ex-Governor John L. Beveridga
also responded to toasts.
The enthusiasm during the evening
was simply unbounded. The banquet
was a success in every way, exceeding
any previous event of the character
that has ever occurred in Los Angeles.
LEAGUE HISTORY.
Crjief Incidents in the Career
of the Organization.
The Young Men's Republican League
of Los Angeles is the pioneer organi
zation of this city, having been formed
in 1592. Its members are always in
the front of the fight, bold, aggressive
and never discouraged by reverses.
The league was organized in Febru
ary, 1892, with A. W. Kinney presi
dent, H. P. Platt secretary and W. F.
Hemming treasurer. Its first head
quarters were on West Second street.
This was in the Harrison-Cleveland
campaign, and the league, being a
uniformed organization and the first
composed of young men in this city, it
at once took an active part in advanc
ing the welfare of the party, visiting
during the fall Pasadena, Wilmington,
Santa Monica and other cities. This
activity so stirred up the opposition
that a party of "unknowns" entered
the league's headquarters and smashed
its furniture and fixtures.
However, the organization continued
to prosper and its efforts were indorsed
by the County Convention. During
this campaign the club assisted in en
tertaining the drill corps of the Union
League Club of San Francisco.
The league reorganized in the Estee-
Budd campaign with 400 members.
George Francis was elected secretary
and Edward Booth treasurer. The
headquarters were located on South
Spring street. During this year many
oganizers and speakers were sent to
neighboring places to form auxiliary
clubs. This work was recognized by
the county convention in a fitting man
ner. The county platform was first
established in 1594. and the Young
Men's League contributed much to its
welfare. Commendatory letters were re
ceived from Mr. Estee and State
Chairman D. M. Burns.
In 1596 President Kinney and Secre
tary Francis were re-elected, F. Down
ing being made treasurer and S. G.
Brown vice-president. The campaign
was formally opened on March 4 by
the first annual banquet of the league.
This was a memorable occasion. Let
ters were read from Thomas Reed, J.
S. Clarkson, Mr. Quay and others high
in the councils of the party. Hon. Wil
liam MeKinley wrote: "Ever sin<?e the
organization of the league movement
I have recognized it as a factor in
shaping the policy and destinies of our
party. It affords me pleasure to send
my best wishes for the success of your
banquet and to express to you my con
fidence that the great principles of the

Republican party are now universally
recognized throughout the United States
as being absolutely necessary for the
progress and prosperity of the coun
try."
The League opened up elegant quar
ters in the Stowell block, and Its 700
members immediately got to work.
Strong resolutions were adopted favor
ing San Francisco as the city for hold
ing the National Republican Conven
tion, and these were sent to the mem
bers of the National Committee.
At its annual election in 1897 the
league elected the following officers:
President, Luther G. Brown; first vice
president, George B. McLaughlln; sec
ond vice-president, W. M. Hiatt; third
vice-president, F. P. Frost; treasurer,
Alexander Caldwell; secretary, George
Francis; assistant secretary, O. R.
Staples.
In the coming battle of '98 the Young
Men's Republican League will be found
in the thickest of the fray and with its
banners well toward the front. It will
not attempt, as an organization, to
bring out candidates or influence con
ventions, but when the nomination,* are
made its members will support them
loyally until the polls are closed on
the first Tuesday in November.
The members of the executive com
mittee for 1898 are: P. J. Kennedy, T.
Hughes, F. Brakesuhler, G. B. Mc-
Laughlin, A. Caldwell. L. R. Garrett,
S. McClure, F. P. Frost, C. C. Bonnell,
C. R. Staples, W. Knippenberg, W. E.
Ludlow, C. McStay, H. J. Hutchinson,
George E. Pillsbury, Edw. Booth,
George Phibbs, A. Walshe, Z. Swable,
R. E. Drummond, George P. Adams,
W. M. Hiatt, George Francis.
The Young Men's League is repre
sentative of the hope, the vitality and
aspirations of the Republican party,
and as Hon. Charles Emory Smith ex
pressed it: "It is the flower of the
great political force which, as a crea
tive and constructive organization will
rank in history with the party of Chat
ham and the younger Pitt, and with
the party of Washington, Hamilton and
Marshall."

Time, 1:41. Winner, B. J. Johnston's gr. h. by Imp. Order-Lucy
first three driving.
Good start. Won
sending her to the post favorite. Thorpe
took the lead from Allie Belle with
Napamax soon after the start, and kept
her in frant to the end, leading the fa
vorite out a length, and tripping the dis
tance off in 1:21. Sloan was a close
third, with St. Calatine.
In the two-mile event, taken by the
black horse, Judge Denny, the world's
record, held jointly by Ten Broeck and
Newton, was shattered, the son of Fon
so, carrying 105 pounds, going the route
in 3:26^. It was a hard-f ought battle,
though, Schreiber's colt, Marplot, with
B.Â°) pounds up, setting a great pace and
contesting every foot of ground at the
end, finally being beaten three or four
lengths. The winner, an 11 to 20 fa
vorite, was ridden by Charley Thorpe,
while Marplot had little Johnny "Woods
up. Collins and Dick Behan, the cmly
other starters, were beaten off.
The muchly touted Chihuahua was
finally given another trial in the open
ing eyent at six furlongs, with a big
field of fourteen facing the barrier.
Notwithstanding the heavy play on the
gelding, he receded in the betting from
S to 2. Clawson got him away from
the post badly, and, though he rushed
him to the fore the first three furlongs,
was unplaced at the end. Morinel, a
15 to 1 shot, ridden by Spencer, headed
the bunch the last furlong, and, in a
drive, led Good Friend out half a
length. Blarney Stone was a close
third.
The two-year-old event, at three and
one-half furlongs, had a very farcical
termination. Saintly opened a pro
nounced choice, but receded to 7 to 5,
the wise play being confined chiefly
to the Burns & Waterhouse entry, Odd
Eyes, which was played from 2l2 l / 2 down
to 2to 1. In a false breakaway Thorpe,
on Odd Eyes, Conley on Buena Ven
tura and Spencer astride Magdalenas,
ducked the barrier and raced pell mell
to the stretch before pulling up. Saint
ly, the first choice, then won easily
from Buena Ventura. Foxey, a GO to 1
shot, finished in the show.
Tod Sloan had the leg up on Lincoln
11. in the final purse event, over a
mile, and his mount ruled a 6 to 5 fa
vorite in the ring. Paul Griggs, the
gray horse, was the warm one, his odds
being forced down from 6 to 2 to 9 to 5.
Dorsey, who had the mount on the lat
ter, let slip no opportunity from the
Jump, and. riding the Johnson entry
hard all the way, got to the wire a
length in advance of the first choice.
Los Prietos was an indifferent third.
NOTES.
Judge Denny and Marplot will meet
again on Tuesday for a special purse
offered, the race to be under the same
conditions as governed yesterday's
event.
"Longshot" Conley failed to land a
winner. He was second, though, in the
first three eveÃts decided.
Buena Ventura ran a great race, and
had it not been for the false break
away, would have been hard to beat.
Magdalenas, too, had speed to burn.
St. Calatine was evidently a trifle
short. ' She runs best out in front, at
that.
Now After Hearst.

ney Grove L. Johnson, appeared before

Judge Campbell yesterday and Bwore to
a complaint charging W. R. Hearst of
the Examiner with criminal libel in con
nection with the publication of the article
reflecting on him in the issue of the paper
of June 7 last. A. M. Lawrence, the man
aging editor, and Charles S. Aitken, have
been held to answer before the Superior
Court on the same charge.
Charge Dismissed.
The charge of receiving stolen goods,
preferred against Aaron and Hiram
Crocker, pawnbrokers, was dismissed by
Judge Joachimsen yesterday on the
ground that the evidence was Insufficient.
It was shown that as soon as the Crock
ers knew that the articles had been stolen
they notified the police, and there was a
doubt in the Judge's mind as to whether
they intended to deprive the owners of
their property. The articles were stolen
from a railroad car at Port Costa.

NARROW ESCAPE
OF THE WEEOTT
Her Smokestack Got Red
Hot and Set Fire to
the Woodwork.
More Tales of the Cruelty Prac
ticed on American Deep
Water Ships.
The Captain of the Tlllle E. Stsrbuck
Compelled to Pay Hie Men Off
at Honolulu..
The twenty-six passengers who left
here on the Weeott for Eureka had an
exciting experience of it on the way
up the coast. Coal happened to be
very scarce ' here prior to her de
parture, and the owner of the vessel
had to take whatever they could get.
The stuff which was put into the Wee
ott's bunkers was full of sulphur,
which not only burned out the fire
bars, but also made the smokestack
red hot and nearly set the ship on fire.
Men were kept on watch nearly all the
time throwing water on the woodwork
in order to prevent it from breaking
out Into flames. The captain's state
room and the social hall were uninhab
itable the greater part of the voyage,
and passengers had to remain In their
rooms or promenade the decks in con
sequence. The captain's cabin is just
forward of the smokestack, and the
woodwork of it was burned clear
through in some places. The social
hall Is just aft the smokestack, and
it was in an incipient stage of com
bustion almost from the start. Several
sections of the smoKestack were
burned completely out and had to be
replaced before the vessel could again
put to sea. The Weeott arrived from
Eureka yesterday, but on this occasion
the voyage was an uneventful one,
as a supply of good steaming coal had
been procured before leaving for San
Francisco.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
steamer Australia arrived from Hon
olulu yesterday with a very large car
go, principally sugar, but not many
cabin passengers. The crew were very
much disappointed when they heard
that the Zealandia was going on the
island run and that the Australia was
going to run from San Francisco to
Dyea and Skaguay. Purser Mc-
Combe and Dr. Soule are the only two
of the Australia's crew who will be
transferred to the Zealandia, All the
others will remain by the ship.
Among the steerage passengers on
the Australia was E. H. Latimer of the
American ship Tillie E. Starbuck. Dur
ing the voyage of the vessel from New
castle, Australia, to Honolulu, it is al
leged the first and second mates ill
treated the sailors. The men were
rope's ended without cause. Some of
them were knocked down and kicked,
and many of them had frequent intro
ductions to the belaying pin. When the
Starbuck reached Honolulu the men
laid the matter before the United
States Consul, and he held that the
men had been brutally treated. All
who wished were given permission
to draw their pay and quit the ship,
and in consequence nearly all the sail
ors left. Latimer, as soon as he got
his money, took ship for San Francis
co, and is on the lookout for another
vessel where he will get fewer kicks
and cuffs.
There seems to be an epidemic of
cruelty on the high seas on American
ships bound for Hawaii just now. Dur
ing the past month the United States
Consul has been appealed to in several
instances, and on each occasion he has
censured the captain and officers and
ordered them to pay the men off.
Steamboat men do not seem to know
a good thing when they possess it. At
the present time there are actually not
enough vessels to handle the promised
Klondike trade, and yet a rate war has
begun. Hitherto each passenger has
been allowed 150 pounds of baggage,
but the agents of the Humboldt are
now allowing each passenger 600
pounds. The agents of the Dirigo are
not to be beaten, and they also are
allowing each passenger 600 pounds of
baggage. Passengers by the National
City and Albion are only allowed 150
pounds cf lÂ»iÂ£gage.
The passenger accommodation on the
bark Rufus E. Wood, which will prob
ably be the first vessel to get away for
St. Michael, is rapidly filling up. A
party of eight fro-m Chicago secured
their accommodation yesterday, wiring
their passage money to the Alaska-Yu
kon Transportation Company. It will
be known as the Morrison party, and
will be composed of F. S. Morrison, M.
C. Anderson, A. J. Patch, M. L. Pot
ter, Fred Jackel, E. Wait, M. L. Eh
man and J. L. Talbot. They will ar
rive here the latter part of March, and
will purchase their outfits in San Fran
cisco.

WANT A CEMETERY MOVED.
Richmdnd District Club Will Petition
the Board of Supervisors on
Monday.
Next Monday afternoon at the meet-
Ing of the Board of Supervisors the Rich
mond District Club will present a strong
petition at the instigation of President
Forsyth asking that the board will give
orders that hereafter no burials shall be
made in the City Cemetery.
The Board of Health will support the
petition, and it is probable from inform
ation given by various members of the
Board of Supervisors that they will act
promptly on the matter in a manner fav
orable to the members of the improve
ment club. For months past resolution
after resolution has been acted upon by
the members of the club in the Richmond
district, but up to the present time no
conclusion as to what to do with the
knotty problem has presented itself. At
the last meeting of the club, however, the
members agreed that the matter should
be placed before the board and they are
now confident that body will act in a
favorable May.
PEOPLE WILL WIN
OVER SPRING VALLEY
Six Supervisors Declare They
Are Against Any Increase
in the Water Rates
i _
The Other Six Waiting for More "Testi=
mony" and Unwilling to Say How
They Will Vote.
There seems every reason for believ- |
ing that the people of San Francisco i
will win in their effort to resist the an- j
nual assault of the Spring Valley Wa- j
ter Company. The corporation, as
usual, desires an increase of the rates.
It would exact from consumers enough j
to make its gains more than 5 per cent .
on the Investment, and 5 per cent is !
considered all that can justly be de
manded. In fact, consumers here pay i
more than asked in other places. For j
a time it was feared that the company
had won, or otherwise secured, the sup
port of a majority of the Supervisors,
but it has not. Six of the twelve de
clare that there shall be no increase,
while the views of the Mayor are well
understood. So, unless Spring Valley's
representatives have cards up their
sleeves, their fight is lost. It is true
that some Supervisors are still waiting !
for something they designate as "testi- j
mony," but the other six make their j
declarations against an Increase, and
do not leave themselves an opportunity ;
to change to the side of the monopoly. '
While Spring Valley is begging for
the privilege of getting more money
from consumers a natural interest is
being taken in the attitude of the vari
ous Supervisors. As a matter of fact
the gentlemen who have the power to
fix rates know the situation thorough
ly. Their minds are already made up.
If the Spring Valley Company wishes
to put up an expensive building, in it- {
self a source of revenue, and have cus
tomers pay for it, the Supervisors can
see through the scheme, and no amount
of talk, however smooth, can change
their views. If stockholders are desir
ous of making more than 5 per cent on |
an investment very little argument is
required to establish their right to do
so, or the reasons why they should not
be permitted to do so. Hence when !
Supervisors declare they are waiting |
for more testimony people will wonder I
if it is the same sort of testimony they j
were looking for when they failed for
so many months to find a fender to
which they could lend or upon which
they could otherwise bestow their ap
proval. It is remembered that last
year dire threats were made of things ;
which were to happen if rates were re- I
duced. It is also remembered that I
rates were reduced and that the dire
ful happenings have yet to put in an
appearance. The word of the company
was not made good then. Possibly it j
will not be made pood this time. An
opinion prevails that some of the Su- !
pervisors are unduly alarmed, or try
to think they are scared, when they
are not. It is interesting to note what
the Supervisors say, and easy to judge |
from it where they stand. Here are a
few excerpts from recent interviews:
Supervisor Rivers â I will be en
tirely guided by the testimony and
the facts adduced before the board.
Whence is the testimony to come?
Who Is to stand sponsor for the
facts?
Supervisor Sheehan â I intend to
live up to the pledge taken and I will
be governed a good deal by the rep
resentations offered us during the in
quiry.
Did Sheehan live up to his pledge
last year? Also there is a curiosity as
to the character of the representation
STREET WORKERS
TO BE LAID OFF
Result of a Threatened Reduc
tion of Ambrose's Ap
propriation.
He Says He Will Be Obliged to Aban
don Projects for Needed
Repairs.
Supprlntondcnt of Streets Ambrose Is
about to discharge the entire force now
at work on the streets and sewers, owing
to the action of the Board of Supervisors.
Mr. Ambrose states his position as fol
lows:
"The board has declared its intention to
use up the greater portion of my uppro
prlation in the paving of various streets
that could well be held over until the
next fiscal year. In spite of my protesta
tions they are about to let contracts that
will aggregate the sum of $25o,<Mp. They
are as follows: For paving with bitu
minous rock the city's portion of Oak and
Stanyan streets, $25,000; improving Alamo
Square, $13,000; repaying Market street,
$25,000; repaying cobbled streets, $38,000;
city's portion of Sunset district sewer,
$15,000; for street sweeping, $135,000. To
tal, $250,000.
"While I am In hearty accord with the
Supervisors as to the necessity, of per
forming the above mentioned work i be
lieve in first doing work on downtown
streets and sewers thut is an absolute
need. Streets that have long been neg
lected in the business portion of the city
where heavy hauling is constantly going
on is in many place* in wretched condi
tion and needs immediate attention.
"The sewers of the lower portion of the
city, also long neglected, are choked and
in need of immediate relief. For the past
four months night watches have been
working to get these into some kind of
shape.
In fact, the situation at present in the
lower portion of town is such that should
a heavy storm come on the result would
be the flooding of all of the cellars In the
wholesale districts. With the backing of
the tides and the excessive drain of storm
water it would be impossible for the
water to run off. Year after year the cel
lars of the lower portion of town have
suffered from the overflowing sewers, and
it is to- remedy this evil that 1 am striving
no hard, but the cutting off of this appro
priation in the manner contemplated by
the Board of Supervisors will so cripple
my department that the work must be
abandoned, and great damage will result.
"I have warned the Supervisors of the
situation and requested that these pro
posed improvements go over until after
July, and with the money now allowed my
department I would be able to fix the
streets and sewers of the business portion
of the town. Complaints are constantly
coming to my department, and I want
the blame for any damage done to rest
where it belongsâ with the Board of Su
pervisors."
A list of the sewers in need of repairs
and their condition shows that many,
particularly along the water front, are
almost In a state of collapse, In the
which would serve as a guide to
Sheehan.
Supervisor Delany â I will be in a
better position to judge . . . when
the company has had an opportunity
to be heard.
In other words, the distinguished
captain is on the fence, and by a little
adroitness the company may knock
him off on the side where he will do it
the most good.
Supervisor Haskins â I decline to
express an opinion.
Why?
Supervisor Devany â It would be
too soon to ask me how I should act
in the matter.
There Is not much to say here
either. Once more the one word
"Why" seems to cover the case.
Supervisor Britt â I will be gov
erned by the circumstances as they
are presented before me.
And the presentation will be attend
ed to by emissaries of Spring Valley.
Britt has the reputation of recogniz
ing the side of his bread which has
butter.
But there are Supervisors who do
not seem undecided. Spring Valley
does not hold them in the hollow of its
hand, if the figure is pardonable. They
are not waiting to be convinced, but,
having the power of thought, are not
afraid to state the conclusions they
have reached. Excerpts from what
they have said are of a different tone
from the quotations above. Some of
these follow:
Supervisor Smith â I am opposed
to any increase in existing rates.
Mr. Smith has been detained from
business by serious illness in his fam
ily, and extended views could hardly
be expected from him.
Supervisor Morton â Under no
circumstances will I vote for an in
crease of rates.
Evidently the necessity of â¢waiting
for "testimony" has not struck Mr.
Morton.
Supervisor Dodge â I stand as I
did one year ago when the question
was before us.
Yet Mr. Dodge has Just as much in
formation in the matter as the other
members who are praying for it.
Supervisor Rottanzi â I will favor
the same rates as I did last year.
What? And Spring Valley with that
elegant new building to pay for?
Surely the doctor grows hard
hearted.
Supervisor Clinton â I will cer
tainly not vote to increase the rates.
Here is a chance for Spring Valley
to undertake some missionary work;
but the field Is not promising.
Supervisor Lackmann â I am in fa
vor of a reduction.
Now, can Spring Valley look upon
this as anything short of treason?
While it begs for more Mr. Lackmann
advocates giving it less, and he is
not waiting for its instructions and
does not look to its representatives
for counsel. Lackmann is in immi
nent danger of acquiring popularity.
But if he goes on in this way Spring
Valley will never regard him as a
proper man to have a voice in the
management of public affairs.
residence portions of the city, too, repairs
are badly needed.

LUX MONET
WENT UP
IN SMOKE
Interesting Tale of a
Case in the Jus
tice Court.
Attorneys Insinuate That
Cigars Were Lighted
With Greenbacks.
One of the Heirs of the Great
Lux Estate as a
Defendant.
KEPT A BUGGY FOR WEEKS
His Attorneys InslrmÂ«tÂ« That He
Was the Worse for
Liquor.
If Insinuations that were thrown out
in the Justice Court yesterday are to
be believed, the millions of the late
Charles Lux, or at least the portion
that belongs to Charles A. Lux, are go
ing up in smoke.
Young Lux and his wife, who was
designated as Madge Lux, were the de
fendants in Justice Groezinger's court
in a suit brought by John W. Murphy,
proprietor of the St. George Stables,
for carriage hire.
It developed in the testimony that on
July 1 last Lux hired a buggy from
Murphy for the ostensible purpose of
going to the park for a few hours' drive.
Murphy testified that instead of being
kept a few hours, the time of detention
of the vehicle was more lifce a few
weeks, and that when the rig came
back it was in a most deplorable condi
tion.
He asked the court to award him $200
for damages to the outfit, hire of the
buggy and the loss of sundry articles
connected with the rig.
Lux, when he took the stand, testi
fied that he did not remember anything
about the horse, buggy or accouter
ments, except that the vehicle was "a
square box with a whole lot of old
wheels."
Stableman Murphy testified that
when the horse and buggy came back,
after an absence of three weeks,
the horse was practically ruined, and :
that the buggy was in such a condition ]
that it cost him 521 to have it repaired. !
Attorney Benson, for the defendant, j
1 was evidently determined to show that ;
his client was incompetent from drink
at the time he hired the rig, and asked
Murphy whether he did not know that
Lax was intoxicated, and that he had ',
I endeavored to light his cigar with a
' burning five-dollar bill at the time he
left the stable. Murphy knew nothing \
of such circumstances.
Justice Groezinger decided that there
was no case against Mrs. Lux, and dis
missed the case against her, reserv
! ing his decision tn the case of the hus
band for a decision on next Monday.
Attorney Regesburger, who conduct
ed the case for Murphy, states that if
the decision goes against him he will
appeal the matter to the Superior
Court, and that more interesting testi- i
mony will be brought out.

CAPTURED TWO
BAD BURGLARS
A Couple of Young Fellows
With Records in the
Toils.
Believed to Bo the Men Who Broke
Into the Barth Jewalry
Store.
Two young fellows, who are suspected
of being the burglars who broke Into the
jewelry store of Rudolph Barth at 141
Post street Sunday morning, were cap
tured early Tuesday morning by Officer
Jim Cavanaugh, and their names put on
the small book at the California-street
station. They were later transferred to
the City Prison and will probably be
booked to-morrow morning.
The men gave their names as George
Thompson and John Brown, and neither
of them Is over 20 years old, but they
have rather bad records. Thompson's
real name is George Riley and he is the
man who was tried about a year ago for
the murder of a man named Hennessy at
the St. David House on Howard street.
He was acquitted of the charge because
of the sudden death of the principal wit
ness from poison. Besides this he waÂ«
up once before burglary. The name
Brown goes by among his friends is
Ritchie.

kept it until Monday evening. During
that day the bedmaker entered the room
and saw on the bed a number of watches,
some other jewelry and about $20 in mon
ey. This created some suspicion, and lat
er the police were notilied and made a
search of the room, but found nothing but
an extension watch key. About 2 o'clock
Tuesday morning- Ritchie and Riley re
turned to the house and* inquired for the
key, and when they could not find it gave
up the room. They were watched when
they left the place and Officers Cava
naugh, Peters and McMahon arrested
them at a beer hall on Kearny street.
They had nothing on them to connect
them with the burglary, but the clerk of
the New Avenue House identified them as
the men who had rented the room.
The key is the only evidence there 19
against the men, as the other goods they
had in the room have not been found, but
it Is believed that this will be sufficient
to convict. Mr. Barth, while he cannot
positively identify the key as his on ac
count of its similarity to all watch keys,
says that a key was taken from his store
on the morning of the burglary. He had
received a dozen new keys of that kind
but two days before and had sold none,
but there were only eleven in the box the
day after the robbery. Among other
things taken from the store was about
$20 of counterfeit money which had been
passed at the store from time to time. It
is believed that this was the money the
people at the hotel saw in Thompson and
Brown's room.

The full text of the opinion is as fol

City of Richmond, appellant vs. South
ern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Com
pany, appellee. Appeal from the Circuit
court of the United States for the East
ern District of Virginia, at Richmond.

Simonton, Circuit Judges.
This case comes up on appeal from the
decree of the Circuit Court of the United
States for the Eastern District of Vir
ginia.
The complainant is a corporation or
ganized under the laws of the State of
New York as a telephone and telegraph
company. It is engaged in the business
of a telephone company and of construct
ing and operating telephone lines in and
through the States of Virginia. West
Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina.
Georgia, Alabama and Florida. It has
maintained and operated for several
years all the apparatus necessary for
transmitting telephone messages in the
city of Richmond, Va., and has erected
and maintained along certain streets and
alleys of said city numerous poles and
wires for this purpose.
The complainant company was incor
porated on the 11th of December, 1579. In
ISS4 it applied to the city of Richmond
for authority to erect its poles and run
its wires along the streets and alleys of
said city, and by an ordinance passed
June 21, 1884, this permission was granted
as to such routes as may be specified and
agreed on by resolution or resolutions of
the Committee on Streets from time to
time, and on the conditions and provi
sions of the ordinance. These conditions
and provisions are: That on any route
conceded by the Committee on Streets
and accepted by the company the poles
should be so placed by the company un
der the direction of the City Engineer, as
to allow for the use of said poles by the
fire alarm and police telegraph, in all
cases giving the choice of position to the
city's wires. To furnish telephone serv
ice to the city at a special reduction of
HO per year for each station. No shade
trees to be disturbed, cut or damaged
â without permission of the City Engineer
and the consent of the owners of the
property in front of which the trees
stand. All this work to be in every re
spect subject to the supervision and con
trol of the City Engineer. The ordinance
to be subject at any time to repeal, such
repeal to go into effect twelve months
after the passage of the repealing ordi
nance.
On the 13th of February, lSS9,.the South
ern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Com
pany, the complainant, accepted without
reservation ail of the restrictions and ob- :
ligations of the act of Congress,, ap
proved July 24, 1866, entitled "An act to
aid in the construction of telegraph lines
and to secure to the Government the use
of the same for postal, military and other
purposes." :
And thereupon, on February IS. ISS9, the
Postmaster-General certmed that this
acceptance was on file in the Postoffice
Department. This act of Congress is in
these words:
Section 163. Any telegraph company now
organized, or which may hereafter by organ
ized under the laws of any State, shall have
the right to construct, maintain and operate
lines of telegraph through and over any por
tion of the public domain of the United States.
over and along any of the military or post
roads of the United States, which have been or
may hereafter be declared such by law, and
over, under or across the navigable streams or
â waters if the United States; but such lines
of telegraph shall be so constructed and main
tained as not to obstruct the navigation of
such streams and waters, or Interfere with
the ordinary travel on such military or post
roads. , v i'">V: â
Section 5268. Before any telegraph company ;
shall exercise any of the powers or privileges
conferred by law such company shall file \
their written acceptance with the Postmaster- :
General of the restrictions and obligations re- !
quired by law. ; ". .
THE ORDINANCE.
On December 14. 1Â»94, the City Council
of Richmond repealed the ordinance of
June 26, ISM. grunting- these privileges to
the Southern Bell Telephone and Teie
sjraph Company, to take effect twelve
months after Its approval. And Septem
ber 10. 1896, the same City Council passed
another ordinance as to the joint use of
poles erected in the. streets and alleys of
the city of Richmond, for the support
if wires used in connection with the
transmission of electricity.
The first section of this ordinance pro
vides that all poles now erected in the
streets or alleys of the city of Rich
mond for electric wires, except such as
support wires required by city ordinances
to be removed and run In conduits, shall
thereafter be allowed to remain only on
terms and conditions thereinafter set
forth.
The second section provides that no
pole now erected for the support of tele
phone wires shall remain on any street
in said city after December 16, 1893, un
less the owner or user of such pole shall
first have petitioned for and obtained
the privilege of erecting and maintain
ing' poles for telephone purposes in ac
cordance with the conditions or this. or
dinance and such others as Council may
see fit to impose. If such owner fall to
obtain such privilege and" fail or neg
]â¢â¢â  to remove the poles and restore the
street to its former condition, he shall
be liable to . a fine not more than. $500
and 'not less than 5100 for every pole so
remaining. Each day's failure to be a
separate offense. Then follows a num
ber of sections imposing most stringent
conditions, placing the -whole matter
within the control of the city and its
officers, reserving the right in the City
Council at any time to put other restric
tions and regulations as to the erection
and use of such poles, and from time to
time require the removal of them and
the wires to be run in conduits. On
September 10, 1896, another ordinance was
passed requiring the removal of poles
and wires from overhead in certain
streets and for the construction and us
ing conduits in certain streets. This or
dinance was enforceable under heav>
penalties, with the provision also that
any company getting the privilege of
putting in these conduits, must make
them 10 per cent larger than is needed
for their use, so that the city might
run its wires free In such conduits and
any other company may use them for
an agreed compensation, or one to be
fixed by arbitrators. , . . ,
Threats having been made to carry,
ordinances into effect, the complainant-!
filed its bill praying an injunction. It
fests Its right to use the streets and ai-'
leys of the city of Richmond for the pur
poses of Its business under article I, sec
tion 8, of the constitution of the United
States and the act of Congress of lS6t>,
and denies that in such case it can be
prevented or controlled or be in any
way dependent upon an ordinance or
any ordinances of the City Council.
he prayer for an injunction is in these
words:
That said city and all others. Its agents' and
employes, may be restrained and enjoined from
removing or interfering with its poles and
""ires in paid city, and from interfering with
the right of your orator to use said poles and
wire*, and that all proceeding* by Â»ald city
or its agents and all others to prevent; your.
orator from continuing, renewing, repairing
& na extending Its . lines,, wires . and poles in,

be declared null and void.
THE DEMURRER.
Upon , the riling of the bill an interlocu
nX, m i?, n etion was granted.
Tv % bm was first met by demurrer.
1116 demurrer set up these defenses:
1. As to the equity of the bill.
1. That the act of Congress of 1566 applies
only to telegraph companies and not to com
panies like the complainant.
*. That the act of Congress, even if It does
apply to complainant, does not give it any
right to erect its poles anil wires along the
streets of Richmond Without the consent of the
city, subject to reasonable regulations as to
the routes, position and .number of the poles
and to pay for the use of the street.
4. That If this is the effect of the act of
Congress it is unconstitutional.
5. That the ordinance of 1884 constitutes a
binding contract between complainant and the
city of Richmond, with a power of rescission
by repeal in the City Council; that this power
was given by the statute of the State of Vir
ginia and was properly exercts*d.
The demurrer was overruled and the
defendant tiled its answer.
The portions of this answer which bear
upon the conclusions reached In this case
are these: A denial that the wires, poles
and lines of the complainant in and over
the streets and alleys of said city con
stitute a part of the' postal service of the
United States. A denial that complainant
is a telegraph company and a denial that
its acceptance of. the act of lS6ii,
so far as the telephone exchange
In Richmond is concerned, even en
titled it to any of the rights and pow
ers authorized by the act. A denial thai
the acceptance by the complainant of t'v*
provisions of the act of 18tt has rendered
complainant independent of and BUperior
to the Council of the city of Richmond.
The cause came to a full hearing and
the Circuit Court made the following de
cree:
The court, without passing on the rights
claimed by the complainant company under the
laws of Virginia, and the ordinances of the
city of Richmond, is of opinion and doth ad-
Judge, order and decree that the complainant
company has, In accordance with the terms
and provisions and under the protection of the
act of Congress of the United States, approved
July 24, ISG6 (which is an authority paramount
and superior to any State law or city ordinance
in conflict therewith), the rights to construct,
maintain and operate its lines over and along
the streets and alleys of the city of Richmond,
both those now occupied by the complainant
company and those not now so occupied, and
to put up, renew, replace and repair Its lines,
poles and wires over and along paid streets
and alleys, as well as to maintain, construct
and operate the same and to connect Its lines
with new subscribers along said streets and
alleys, and the sand city of Richmond, its
agents, officers and all others are enjoined and
restrained from cutting, removing or in any
way Injuring said lines, poles and wires of the
complainant company, and' from preventing or
interfering with the exercise of the aforesaid
rights by the complainant company, and also
from taking proceedings to inflict and enforce
fines and penalties on said company for exer
cising its said rights.
ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR.
The defendant obtained leave to appeal
from this decree and it comes up on the
assignments of error. These are eleven
in number. The first three are general in
their character, going to the preliminary
injunction and to the demurrer to the bili.
The fourth is to the effect that the or
dinance of ISB4. passed under the author
ity of the State of Virginia and under
which the operations of the complainant
company were begun and continued, cre
ated a contract which bound the com
plainant to cease Its operations upon tho
streets and alleys of Richmond whenever
the City Council exercised its right to re
peal said ordinance, a right reserved in
the ordinance itself.
The fifth and sixth deny that the com
plainant has any right to the privileges
under the act of Congress of 1566, which
applies to telegTaph companies, and not
to a telephone company, as complainant
is.
The seventh, eighth and ninth deny that
even if complainant comes within the act
of I*B6, it can be protected, unless it is
engaged in interstate commerce business;
and only as to such business, and denies
that it is protected in its local business.
They also deny that there is anything in
the contract with the Western Union
Telegraph Company which puts com
plainant in interstate commerce business,
or within the protection of section 8. ar
ticle I, of the constitution of the I'nited
States.
The tenth and eleventh assignments as
sign- error as to the scope of the injunc
tion, as it enjoins the city from interfer
ing with the infra State and local busi
ness of the complainant, and a right to
erect Its poles and stretch its wires with
out any control on the part of the city.
At the bar the appellant declared that
the constitutionality of the act of Con
gress of 1866 was recognized and admitted
Thnt all streets which are letter carrier
mutes are post roads of the I'nited
States.
That under the act of 1866 a telegraph
company can obtain a right of way for its
poles and wires through a city and along
its strf-ta against the wish of the mu
nicipality.
The decisive questions raised in this
case are:
Firptâ Does the complainant come within the
protection and is it entitled to the privileges
contained in the art of Congress of 1S68?
Secondâ lf it comes within the provisions of
that act, how far has it limited and restricted
itself by accepting- the provisions of the ordi
nance of the city of Richmond?
Thirdâ To what extent does the protection of
the act of ISftj go? Does it make the company
accepting it free of the control of the munici
pality In which Its does business"
The act of Congress of 1860, in terms,
speaks of telegraph companies. Do these
words include telephone companies?
The telegraph arid telephone both com
municate messages by means of electricity
over wires for longer or shorter distances.
The telegraph communicates these mes
sages by sound of instruments, the tele

SOME CITATIONS.
In Bngland, in the case of Attorney
| General vs. Edison Telephone Company
i 6 Q. B. Div., 244, Stephens, J., in a care
i fully prepared and elaborate discussion,
says: "I do not think it necessary to
: express any opinion on a controversy
; which is more, scientific than legal, and
j perhaps more properly metaphysical or
j relative to the meaning of words than
scientific, as it seems to turn upon the
nature of identity in relation to sound.
It !s enough to Pay that, whatever be the
merits of the controversy, it does not ap
j pear to us that the fact, if it is a fact,
I that sound itself is transmitted by the
i telephone, establishes any material dis
tinction between telephonic and tele
graphic communication, as the transmis
sion, if it takes ular-e. is performed by a
wire acted on by electricity."
In the Wisconsin Telephone Company
vs. City of Oshkosh, $2 wis., 32. this case
was cited with full approval, and the
doctrine asserted that, in contemplation
of law, a telephone and telegraph com
pany are one and the same. In the case
of the Chesapeake and Potomac Tele
graph Company vs. B. and O. Telegraph
Company, 66 Maryland, 410, the court of
last resort of that State quotes with ap
proval the English case above quoted, and
sayc further: "It is clear if we take the
term telegraph to mean and include any
apparatus or adjustment of instruments
for transmitting messages or other com
muni' atioi â  by means of electric currents
and siKnals. that term is comprehensive
enough to embrace the telephone."
The same doctrine is clearly and fully
expressed in Duke vs. Central N. J. Tef
c-phone Company, 53 N. J. Law Report*, j
341. The court quotes the language of I
Bell in his application for a patent, set I
out in the telephone cases, 126 U. S. . 1.
He pays: "What I claim is the method
or an apparatus for transmitting vocal I
.>r other sounds telegraphically as herein I
described, by causfrig- electrical undula
tions similar in form to the vibrations
of air accompanying said vocal sounds. "
And so. also. Brown, J., now Mr. Justice
Prown, in Cumberland Telephone and
Telegraph Company vs. United Electric
Railway Company. -12 Fed. Rep., 273, says:
"We see no reason to doubt the posi
tion assumed by the complainant that a
telephone company is a. telegraph com
pany."
The complainant, therefore, comes
within the protection', and is entitled to
the privileges, of the act of 1866.
2. The next question Is, if the complain
ant is within the protection and enjoys
the privileges of the act of Congress of
1M56. how far has it limited and restricted
itself by accepting the provisions of the
ordinance of the city of Richmond?
In June, 1884, the ordinance was passed
(.â ranting the right of way throughout the
city of Richmond to this complainajH.
At that time it had not accepted the
provisions of the act of lÃ'lfi, and in no
'it her way could it get the right to enter
the city but by permission of the City
Council- The permission was given sub
ject to the right oi the City Council to
revoke it at any time after twelve
months, and on December 14, 1894, it was
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 1898.
i revoked. In the meantime, 1889, the
i complainant, recognizing: the uncertainty
of its tenure, concluded to nut the en
joyment of its rights on higher grounds
j and under paramount authority. Can
it now be said ihat the complainant can
| not avail itself of the privileges of the
I act of 1866. and must look for them to
the City Council, because formerly the
cit;. granted privileges which it has re
voked? Can a contract, revocable and
revoked by one party, still bind the other
party after its revocation?
The complainant is not now using the
post roads of the city of Richmond under
any grant from the City Council. The
Council themselves, by "their own act,
! have put an end to any such contract
with the complainant. But for the act
I of Congress, it would be a trespasser on
these post roads. Under the act of
j Congress, it has the right to construct,
i maintain and operate lines of telegraph
j over and along any of the post roads of
I the United States, and when an effort
i is made, or threatened, to deal with It
1 as a trespasser, it can refer to that act.
3. The next question is: To what ex
tent does the protection of the act of
| Congress go. Does it free the company
; accepting Its provisions from any control
of the municipality through whose
streets it may go?
TO WHAT EXTENT.
This act of 1566 authorizes the company
accepting its provisions to maintain and
operate its lines on any postmad. The
> act itself prescribes a condition. The
lines of telegraph must not interfere with
the ordinary travel. It is, therefore, sub
ordinate to the public use. The privileges
of this act. "like any other franchise, are
i to be exercised in subordination to public
as to private rights." (.St. Louis vs.
Western Union Telegraph Company, 148
U. S., 100). These privileges must be en-
Joyed, suhject to the lawful exercise of
the police power. In Western Union Tel
egraph Company vs. Massachusetts. 125
T*. S. , 530, a telegraph company, protected
by the act of 1866. and engaged in busi-
I ness as a common carrier, was held to be
; a subject of taxation by a State. The Su
i preme Court uses this language: "It
never could have been Intended by the
Congress of the United States, in confer
ring upon a corporation of one State the
authority to enter the territory of any
other State and erect poles and lines
therein, to establish the proposition that
such a company owed no obedience to
the laws of the State into which it thus
i entered.
; In the case of St. Louis vs. Western
! Union Telegraph Company, supra, a
I charge by a city for poles was held valid
ngainst this same company, the only lim
1 Itation being that the charge be not un
j reasonable. In Western I'nion Telegraph
i Company vs. the Mayor, 3 Law Reports
I Ann.. 449. an ordinance requiring that tel
| egra-ph wires be placed in conduits was
sustained. Streets and alleys in a city
: are the public property placed under the
I supervision and control of the municipal
: ity. the representatives of the sovereign
j power. They exercise this supervis'oh
: and control for the benefit of the whole
i public, those living upon and those pass
ing through such streets and alleys. And
in the exercise of this supervision, which
! is the police power, they must see to it
that the rights of the public and of pri
vate persons are not infringed.
The complainant, under the act of Con
gress, has the right to use these high
; ways. Neither the State nor any muniei
! pallty can prevent it. But this use must
j be subordinate to the rights of the pub
; lie, must not endanger those rights. And
as the municipality is the guardian of the
public in this regard. It can establish such
lawful provisions as may regulate the
use, always, however, avoiding such reg
i illations as will make the use burden
; some and intolerable, and so practically
1 impossible. (City of Philadelphia vs.
Western Union Telegraph Company. S2
Fed. Rep., 797.)
This being so. the injunction granted
by the Circuit Court is too broad in its
language and effect. There should have
been the recognition of a proper exercise
of the police power by the municipal cor
poration, and the use by the complainant
of its poles and lines should have been
declared to be subject to such regula
tions and restrictions as may now or may
be herafter imposed by the City Council
of Richmond, in the proper and lawful
I exercise of the police power.
INTOLERABLE AND IMPOSSIBLE.
The only remaining question is. do the
â  ordinances of the city of Richmond pre
! scribe regulations which will rmike the
use burdensome and intolerable, and
practically impossible?
"It belongs to the Legislature to exer
cise the police power of the State, sub<
;ect to the power of the courts to ad
judge whether any particular law is an
invasion to rights secured by the consti
tution." (Mugler vs. Kansas, 123 V. S.,
SB.] "The Legislature may not. under
the guise of protecting the public inter
ests, arbitrarily interfere with private
businesses of or impose unusual and un
necessary restrictions upon lawful occu
pations. In other words, its determina
tion as to what, is proper exercise of its
| police power is not final or conclusive,
I but is subject to the supervision of the
j f-ourts." (Lawton vs. Steele, 152 V. S. .
I 137.) If this be the case with regard to
1 the Legislature a fortiori it applies to a
| municipal corporation, the creature of
the Legislature.
On examination of these ordinances, it
will be seen that as a condition precedent
to the use of the streets of Richmond, a
petition must first be riled for the pur
pose of erecting and maintaining poles
and wires for telephone purposes, in ac
cordance with the conditions of that or
dinance, and such conditions as the Coun
cil may see fit to impose. (Ordinance
approved 10th September. 1895.) The sev
enth section of that ordinance expressly
reserves to the City Council the right to
put at any time other restriction* and
regulations. And the whole tenor and
effect of the ordinance is to put the com
pany absolutely under the control of the
city. And the terms of the ordinance
are enforclble under heavy penalties. The
next ordinanceâ the one providing for
wires in conduits â after providing that
the City Council may compel the remmal
of wires from poies overhead in certain
streets and the putting them in conduits
in certain streets, under a penalty of nr>t
less than $100 or more than $500 for each
pole per week, provision is made for per
mission to build conduits of sufficient ca
pacity to accommodate the wires in such
streets and to provide for an increase
thereof to at least the extent of 100 per
cent, the increase of space not to be oc
cupied by the party building the conduits
without the consent of the Council, the
conduit to be used for the wires of the
Council free, and the City Coun.il t.,
allow any oth^r person or corporation !<
use such conduit for wires upon paying
compensation in th^ mode prescribed by
the City Council. This privilege of build
ing and owning conduits to last no longer
than fifteen years, ut the end of which
time the city may put such other restric
tions, conditions and charges as it may
see fit. or may order their removal at
the expense of the owner. The charge
for using or owning any wire in any such
conduit shall be for each year until Jan
uary 1. 1900. $2 per wire per mile; af
ter January 1, 1900. such larger com
pensation for the rest of the term as tht
City Council may see fit.
These are some of the condition*
now imposed, with the right to im
pose any others which the Coun
cil may see fit. Now it goes without
saying that if the complainant, notwith
standing its claim of protection under th.
act of Congress of ISM. were willing to
file a petition to the City Council for the
privilege of using its streets and alleys,
and in that petition agreed in considera
tion of its grant to abide by any present
or future condition, regulation or restric
tion the Council may impose, this woillA
be a binding contract and would control
the complainant. (R. R. Company vh.
Ryan, 153, U. S., 436.) Whatever the rights
of the complainant may have been und< i
such a stipulation, it would surrender
them and come within the absolute domi
nation of the City Council. The court*
could not review any ordinance to ais,
cover if it be within the lawful exercise
of the police power, for the complainant
would be bound by its contract to obey
the ordinance, be it a police regulation or
not.
These conditions, regulations and re
strictions already prescribed by the CJtv
Council appear to be stimulated by a de
sire to oppress and control, perhaps de
feat, the existence of the complainant,
and so are not the lawful exercise of the! !
police power. I
Let the case be remanded to the Cir- I
cuit Court with instructions to modify
the terms of the injunction therein grant*
ed, so that it may conform to the prin
dplea declared in this opinion, the costs
ot the case to be equally divided between
the parties.

May Have Taken
His Life.
Tragic Ending of a Man

Business.

Divorced a Short Time

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 12.
From a home of wealth and luxury
to death in the lowest of Bowery sa
loons in New York, Is the fate of John
Henry Church Jr., who ten years ago
was one of the best-known young men
in this city.
Probably no family on either coast
has had more romance and tragedy in
jected in their history than that of the
Churches of this city. John Henry
Church Sr. is now a resident of San
Francisco, is in poverty, and word has
just been received that a short time ago
his favorite son either died from the
effects of or committed suicide by tak
ing morphine.
At the time ot his death the New-
York papers declared that there was "a
mystery on the Bowery." A well
dressed young man took a room at the
Klondike lodging house, 359 Bowery,
and for two days did not go out. At
the end of that time the docrr was
forced open, and the dead body of the
man was found on the iloor by a chair,
upon which were a syringe and a vial
containing morphine. He had regis
tered as Thomas AlcCarty, but an in
vestigation of his clothing showed that
his name was either J. H. Church or G.
H. Granville. After the bc-dy was taken
to the morgue Granville was discov
ered, and a little later the dead man
was recognized as Church. His step
father, Stephen Van Court of Mt. Ver
non, made the identification. Mrs. Van
Court, young Church's mother, was
formerly one of the live wives of J. H.
Church, the wealthy saloon man of this
city.
About ten years ago young Henry,
contrary to his father s wish, married
a young actress, who was then em
ployed at the Golden Gate Music Hall
in this city, an institution which has
long passed into history. Their mar
ried life was short and unhappy, and
young Church secured a divorce.
Some time later Henry was arrested
for an alleged theft of a watch and
was sentenced by Judge Wallace
to twenty years' imprisonment. A
new trial, however, was grant
ed him, and his mother, Mrs.
Van Court, who had always maintain-
Ed correspondence with young Henry's
divorced wife, sent out $100u to pro
vide for her son's defense. He was en
abled to procure attorneys and at his
second trial was acquitted.
After this incident young Henry
went to New York, where his mother
set him up in business, and for some
time he had been doing tolerably well.
He had, however, contracted the habit
of using morphine, and three days be
fore his death he disappeared from
home, and, as developments showed,
he had gone to the room on the Bow
ery under an assumed name either for
the purpose of having a morphine de
bauch or taking his life. "Whether his
death was accidental or Intentional is
still a matter of doubt.
Young Church's father is perhaps
the most-married man in California.
Years ago he started his matrimonial
career, and at that time ne was said to
be worth $200,000. Periodically he has
beon divorced and married until he has
had five or six wives. In nearly every
instance a separation took place only
in conjunction with the giving of a
handsome sum to the aggrieved wife,
consequently each time Church mar
ried he was poorer than when he last
appeared before the altar. Both he and
his son have from a variety of reasons
been before the courts in this city and
San Francisco as much as any two
members of one family ever were.
Young Henry's former wife is now
living in this city, having been married
to a very worthy man.
CIGAR DEALERS
IN DIFFICULTY
A. Pennsylvania Firm Sues for
the Recovery of a Large
Sum.
Peculiar Phase of the Situation A
Suspicious Transfer of
Property.
Harrold Bros., dealers in cigars and to
bacco, 103 Front street, were attached
late Friday afternoon by i. w. Sny
rter upon an assigned claim from Oblong
Bros., Philadelphia, Pa., for cigars and
:obacco sold and delivered by them with
in the past year.
The Philadelphia firm, not receiving a
remittance, became suspicious and sent
a representative to make an investiga
tion, which resulted in his finding that
property formerly in the name of Frank
and W. P. Harrold had been either trans
ferred or that a homestead had been filed
thereon. Property in Mill Valley has been
â¢leeded to George Harrold, and the book
accounts to a mother of the members of
the firm. All of these transactions are of
recent date, and by the attorneys of the
plaintiffs. Walter. H. Linforth and Grove
C. Whitakcr, are looked upon with sus
picion.
A peculiar phase of the situation is
that, notwithstanding the fact that the
attachment is for a large amount, $17,
:â¢!Â«, there seemingly is only one creditor.
An effort, therefore, to force the firm
into insolvency v/ould fail, as it would
require the petition of at least five cred
itors. The parties making the attach
ment will necessarily be compelled to al
lege fraud to have the assignment of
book accounts, the filing of homesteads
.-<nd deeding of property set aside. That
this course will be pursued is intimated
by the attorneys for the plaintiffs.

Turmoil at a Meeting of
the Village Belle
Circle.
The Treasurer Threatens to
Kill the Chief Com
panion.
An Investigation Into the Treasurers
Accounts the Causa oT the
Trouble.
There was an exciting time at the
meeting of the Village Belle Circle,
Companions of the Forest, Friday night
in the Alcazar building.
Edward P. Donovan, 265 Harriet
street, was recently elected chief com
panion, and upon his induction into of
fice he decided on making an investiga
tion into the accounts of the treasurer
and financial secretary, J. G. Chase, a
carpenter and builder on Larkln street,
near Vallejo. At his suggestion an au
diting committee was appointed, which
roused the ire of Chase. The commit
tee commenced their investigation, and
Donovan, on receiving a partial report,
became convinced that something was
wrong.
During the meeting Friday night
Donovan called upon Chase to produce
some vouchers. Chase jumped to his
feet, called Donovan a vile name, and
quickly put his hand in his hip pocket.
He threatened to kill Donovan and a
wild scene followed. A number of lad
ies belong to the circle and several
were present at the meeting. Chase's
words and actions filled them with ter
ror, and their screams could be heard
all over the building as they made a
combined rush for the door. The crush
was so great that two of them fainted,
which added to the excitement.
The men were calmer and several of
them made a grab for Chase and held
him till Donovan got out of the way.
The meeting broke up in disorder, as
bloodshed was feared if Donovan re
turned.
Yesterday morning Donovan appeared
before Judge Joachimsen and swore out
a warrant for the arrest of Chase on
the charge of threats to kill. He had
not got over his excitement, and it was
evident that his nerves had received a
severe shock. He told the Judge that
he firmly believed Chase would carry
out his threat to kill him, and he
wanted him bound over to keep the
peace.
"The Investigation must go on," said
Donovan, "and It won't do for this man
to try and prevent it by threatening to
take my life. I am certain something
Is wrong, and his conduct last night
has simply made me more convinced of
the fact."
WILL SAIL FOR SKAGUAY.
The Steamer Australia, Captain
Houdlette Commanding, Taken
Off the Honolulu Line.
The steamer Australia, Captain Henry
C. Houdlette commanding:, arrived in
port yesterday after a pleasant voyage
from Honolulu. The next trip out made
by the Australia will be to Skaguay, as
the steamer has been chartered by Good
all, Perkins & Co. to convey freight and
passengers to the frojen gold fields in
the Northwest Territory. Captain Houd
lette, who iB one of the best known and
most popular cnptains sailing out of this
port, will remain in command, and the
majority of the crew will also make the
voyage with him.
"We had a very pleasant voyage from
the islands," said the Jovial captain last
night. "I cannot recall an incident or
event worthy of notice," he added, "un
less it was the fog bank we ran into eight
hundred milfÂ»s out from port. We were
in the bank day and night, and I can as
sure you that we felt pleased when we
got out of it. when off the Farallon Isl
ands."
Captain Houdlette said that it came to
him as a great surprise when he was in
formed that his next trip would be to the
Klondike regions. He has made 151 trips
to the Hawaiian Islands, and It will ue
strange for him to take the Australia
over an entirely new course.
"All the information I have received
concerning the voyage to Skaguay," said
the captain last evening, "comes from
the pilot. He told me that the Australia
had been chartered by Goodall, Perkins
& Co. and that I was to pail with her
within a few weeks. I was tired out when
I got in. and went home without visiting
the office. I suppose I will recei\ - e all
necessary instructions Monday."
Captain Houdleite will have the best
wishes of all who know him in his new
field of duty. . uring the many trips
made by him to the islands he won a
host of friends, and those who are fre
quently called to travel to Honolulu will
miss him and hi* stanch steamer.

DUMMIES MANGLED BY CAR FENDERS
Inventors Display Devices for Saving the Lives of Those Who Get in
the Way of the Trolleys.
There was another test of street
car fenders and alleged fenders on
West Mission street yesterday. About
a score of inventors were there with
their devices that they claimed would
save the lives of those who were un
fortunate enough to be caught in front
of swiftly moving cars. Nine of the
devices were given tests for the benefit
of the Committee on Health and Police
of the Board of Supervisors, who will
recommend to the board the style of
fender they think best suited for use
on the lines of the city. Working
models of the different fenders were
attached to cars and dummies of men
and boys were laid on the tracks to
test their utility. Supervisors Rottanzi
and Clinton insisted on fair and com
plete tests and they made the motor
men in charge of the cars run at the
dummies at the full speed of the cars
with the dummies standing, sitting and
lying down on the tracks.
The great difficulty in devising a
fender for use in this city, say the in
ventors, is that contrivances are want
ed that will be far enough above the
rails when the cars are running to
clear the tracks on the sharp grades
and at the same time be low enough
to prevent the limbs of the unfortunate
persons who might get in the way of
the cars from going under the wheels.
General Manager Vining of the Mar
ket-street Railway system was among
the inventors. His device was similar
to several others that were tried, and
it, like the others, had a way of mang
ling the dummies that would do credit
to a sausage machine. However, all
the fenders tried had some merit, and
when the tests were over the Supervi
sors were of the opinion that the con
trivances known as the Hunter fender

Men.
The burglars -who entered the Atlan
tic bonded warehouse at Battery street
and Broadway several nights ago, confi
dently expected to get away with at
least $10,000 worth of opium. In some
â¢way they learned that a valuable lot of
opium had been placed in the ware
house and they determined to steal it.
Going to a Chinese merchant, who
deals in the drug, the burglars repre
sented that they had fallen Into pos
session of a quantity of opium which
they claimed was worth $10,000.
The Chinaman claimed he was anx
ious to purchase some opium, and offer
ed to pay the creeks the full value of
the drug.
They then left his store, after prom
ising to return a few hours later. Sus
pecting that they contemplated raiding
a warehouse in which was stored opi
um, the Chinaman informed the police
man on the beat. The latter at once
notified Captain Bohen, and two de
tectives were sent to make an Investi
gation. While they were quizzing the
Chinaman the daring burglars had
forced an entrance into the Atlantic
bonded warehouse, but failed to secure
any opium.
This was due to the fact that the su
perintendent of the wareho-ÃBe, becom
ing suspicious of the actions of two
evil-looking men, who were seen hang-
Ing around the place on the afternoon
of the burglary, ordered the opium
placed in a vault. Not being supplied
with the necessary tools, the burglars
did not attempt to open the vault, but
contented themselves with drinking
several bottles of cognac.
Last night the Chinaman to whom
the men offered to sell the opium visit
ed police headquarters and gave a de
scription of the burglars to Captain
Bohen. He declared that the man who
acted as spokesman was well dressed,
but gave evidence of being an opium
fiend.
After Introducing himself as a well
to-do merchant he claimed that he had
bought a large quantity of contraband
opium, which he was anxious to sell,

and the Craig fender had the most to
recommend them. The Supervisors,
however, who took the most interest in
the tests are in the minority in the
Board of Supervisors, and the opinion
was freely expressed that the fender
devised by Manager Vining would be
the one that would be eventually
adopted by the Board of Supervisors
as the one most desirable.
A fender invented by a man named
Tucker was first tested. The car was
rigged with cushions where it would
most likely strike its victim. That
was intended as the first means of
avoiding injury. Then there was a
scoop net close to the wheels to pick
up the body of the person to keep the
car from going over it and crushing
out what life there might be left. That
fender pushed the dummies along the
ground in front of the moving car
without causing much apparent dam
age to them.
The Markley fender was next called
for trial. It was a long scoop-net af
fair that projected far in front of the
car. It had to be carried high above
the rails so that it could clear the
ground at the grades. The inventor
wanted to lower it so that it would
scoop up the dummies on the level
spot where the tests were being made,
but that would be considered a special
privilege and it was refused. The
fender was withdrawn from the test.
A young man named Bernard had a
fender that was operated by the ac
tion of the brake lever. Every time
the brake was put on it scraped the
ground. It was not considered worthy
of thetimeof a test and it was ruled off.
A fender devised by the joint genius
of Jones and Wickersham and called
the "Monarch" was proved to be a fail

Drovidlng that he could trust the pur

In answer to a question as to how
much of the drug he had he remarked
that it was worth at least $10,000. As
the Chinaman signified his intention of
buying the drug the "merchant" and
his partner then left the place, after
promising to return in a short time
with the opium.
Captain Bohen is determined to
catch the men, as he thinks they will
attempt to enter other bonded ware
houses in search of opium. He has
detailed two of his best men on the
case, who are diligently working to ap
prehend the burglars.

ure on a track where the grade was
steep. It, like the Markley fender,
had to h" far above the rails,
and on trial it passed over the dum
mies.
A fender made by John Craig, a Mis
sion blacksmith, had many good points
and it was given a severe test. It, un
like the others, picked up the dum
mies that were placed In front of it,
and a netting along the forward end
of the car prevented any hard knocks
that might be given by a swiftly mov
ing car.
The Clark fender that is in use In
Oakland, Alameda and Sacramento
was given a severe test and it met
most of the requirements demanded of
it. The greatest objection raised to it
was that it could not be carried close
enough to the rails to clear the track
on the grades and still be effective on
the level stretches of the track.
Vining's fender was the last one
tried. It is much like the one Tucker
claims to have invented. The other in
ventors say Vining and Tucker stole
each other's ideas on car fenders.
Vining's fender was without the cush
ions In front of the car. It scooped up
the dummies after rolling them along
the ground for a few feet, and Vining
and his railroad friends said it was a
success. The dummies, however, were
considerably damaged.
Henry Boardman had a fender at
tached to a truck arraneed with a few
buggy wheels. The railway company
would not allow him to put it on one
of their cars. A young man substi
tuted himself for the aummy and the
fender picked him up without causing
him the least injury. The truck was
propelled by some of the friends of the
inventor.

The Fit of a Cornet.
Corsets of various styles have been
worn by women ever since the eyes of
man have admired the graceful form of
woman. In the days of the Roman "Cor
setus" woman was content to suffer the
tortures of an unfitting, uncomfortable
affair, that it might add beauty and sym
metry to hor form. At the middle of the
fifteenth century it was a mark of In
fluence in England â wives of men hav
ing an income of less than $200 a year
were forbidden to wear corsets over a
certain cost.
It is estimated that over 60,000,000 cor
sets are used annually by the women of
the United States alone, giving employ
ment to 10,000 people.
Dp to recent years comfort in corsets
was almost an unknown quality. Corsets
that gave shape and beauty to a form
were generally too uncomfortable to wear.
Corsets that were at all easy were mis
shapen affairs of no practical use.
Miss Hulin, the expert corset-fitter now
at Hale's, claims that proper corset-fit
ting is a science. She has made a careful
study of feminine anatomy, and says that
90 per cent of the corset-wearing people
of the world do not wear corsets that fit
them properly. Each form has its pe
culiarities, and a correctly fitting corset
should add beauty to form and comfort
and support to the wearer. An oppor
tunity to consult such a student of cor
sets and feminine form seldom occurs
Miss Hulin is a leader in her profession
and is in. a position Â£o give advice that
may mean years of comfort to any lady
consulting her. She will be at Hale Bros,
for some time, demonstrating, fitting, ad
vising and explaining the merits of cor
rect corset fit and comfort. Her services
and advice will be free to the patrons of
the store.

The undersigned, taxpayers of the Mis

necessary tax.
The protest was supplemented by a
series of ringing preambles and resolu
tions read by E. P. E. Troy, as follows:
Whereas, There is now on foot a selfish
scheme to rob the citizens and taxpayers
of this city and county by foisting upon
the city at sevpri times its value a cer
tain tract of land known as the Rock
Ranch und Gum Tree tracts as a site
for a zoological garden; and
Whereas, The selfish promoters of said
scheme have asserted that our able, hon
ored and incorruptible representative in
the Board of Supervisors from the Elev
enth Ward, Dr. Charles A. Clinton, did
not in his vigorous and manly opposition
to this unsavory job represent the views
or voice the sentiments of the residents
and property-owners of the Mission; and
Whereas, A new hospital for the proper
treatment and care of the city's sick is
absolutely- necessary if we would preserve
the fair fame and good name of our mu
nicipality, and proper school accommoda
tions for our children in which their
health and even their lives shall not be
in daily jeopardy; and
Whereas, If it be thought desirable at
this time of business depression and
financial stringency to establish a zoolog
ical garden, the city now has, in the tract
of land known as the Industrial School
and House of Correction tract a site in
every way superior to that proposed to be
purchased at so enormous a cost to the
peoplo of this city. Therefore be it
Resolved, That we, the citizens of the
Eleventh Ward and Mission District of
this city, in mass-meeting assembled, do
hereby declare our perfect confidence in
the honesty, ability and faithfulness of
our representative in the Board of Su
pervisors, Dr. Charles A. Clinton, of
whose record as a public servant we are
proud; whose invaluable public services
we gratefully recognize, and whose pub
lic acts we heartily indorse and ap
prove.
Resolved, That in our judgment no
steps should be taken by this city to ac
quire land for a zoological garden until
a new charter has been adopted and cer
tainly not until the city has erected a
proper hospital for Its sick, and provided
sanitary and comfortable accommoda
tions for all the children of our public
schools.
Resolved, That we hereby thank the
San Francisco Call for its able, vigorous
and persistent exposures of this attempt
ed steal.
It is unnecessary almost to mention
the fact that the resolutions were
adopted with a unanimous shout of
! approval.
James H. Barry made up in fire and
earnestness what his speech lacked in
length. He had come, he said, not to
make a speech, but to enter his solemn
protest against the proposed steal for
the so-called zoo. He believed in public
improvements, but did not believe in
public thefts. It was asked, he added,
that the taxpayers should contribute
nearly $400,000 for the purpose of en
riching only a few land speculators at
the expense of the people.
Mr. Barry called attention to the fact
that the city had nearly 100 acres of the
old Industrial Schocrl tract lying idle,
and that it would be a proper site for
a new City and County Hospital, "where
the maimed and the halt and the blind
may move around and enjoy God's* free
air." The site of the present hospital
could be converted into a park.
Mr. Barry closed by saying:
Let us look out for the sanitary con
dition of our schools and, incidentally, for
the sanitary condition of our Board of
Education. As bad as they are, our
Supervisors are angels of light compared
to those men who are supposed to edu
cate our children morally and intellect
ually.
Ex-Supervisor Denman was the first
speaker called on to address the meet
ing. After touching on its purpose he
said in part:
"I am in favor of a new hospital for
this city. It is about time that the city
has laid aside its swaddling clothes
and put on the garb of manhood. We
deserve a better hospital, and think
that instead of erecting on its present
site that the Almshouse tract should
be used for that purpose and not for a
monkey ranch. I am opposed to the
proposed zoo, because I think it a job,
and I think you are of the same opin
ion. [Applause.] I understand that the
gum-tree tract is assessed at $45,000.
Now, how much do you think they ask
for it? All they can getâ s3B7,soo. It is
the old story over again â I have al
ways fought such jobs and will con
tinue to do so."
Judge Van Reynegom said: "I think

It is a ehame that the hospital accom
modations are so wretched. It is a
good passport for the ports of death,
and I feel sorry that any human being
must go there."
Joseph Leggett said that the present
ramshackle that is used for a hospital
is a disgrace to the city and will al
ways remain so until a new structure
ia erected. That would be better than
a monkey garden.
Dr. Clinton was then introduced, and
received a hearty greeting. In a few
well-chosen words he thanked his
neighbors for their Indorsement of his
stand, and pledged himself with con
tinuing to uphold their interests.
Max Popper said he came as a repre
sentative of the Castro street division,
and that all the residents of that part
of the Mission were opposed to the
purchase of the gum tree tract. He
stated that he had taken the trouble
to canvass the district and claimed that
the majority were opposed to the plan.
John Hanlon followed in a short
speech, and his remarks were received
with applause. .
All the speakers paid high tribute to
Supervisor Clinton for his devotion in
this matter to the interests of the peo
ple. After the conclusion of the meet
ing the Supervisor was serenaded at
his residence by the band and several
hundred citizens.

"FUERO LOS AMERICANOS" SHOUTED THE SPANISH MOB
Los Americanos! Fuero
Yankee filibusteros!"
From morning until night the
streets of San Sebastian rang
with the menacing words.
On every lip the same cry,
"Down with the Americans!
Away with the Yankee filibus-
ters."
The little children out for their morn
ing walk, with their nursemaids,
ehouted it in sweet high childish treble;
the flower girls and chestnut venders
sang out the excellence of their
â¢wares, their soft voices thick with pas
sion as they interspersed their remarks
with eternal maledictions on "los
Americanos;" the street gamins and
Idlers gathered in little knots and vied
with each other in finding appropriate
terms to express their hatred and con
tempt for the "Pueblo Yank." In the

along the boulevard, the cry rang as
from a single throat, "Ftfero los Esta

Ptoithout an outward evidence of this
smoldering fire. The blaze s-tarted
when a report came that an American
Senator had delivered an open tirade
in Congress against Spain. Full ac

published in the papers next day, and

the northern border, washed by the
Bay of Biscay, through Madrid, down
to Cadiz and Malaga, in the south, the
excitement rose to fever heat.
"What right have the Americans to
interfere in Spanish-Cuban affairs?
Who are they? A people without his
tory or origin, formed from the scum
of Europe and the sediment of the
prisons, a people whÂ«se fundamental
law is La Ley de Lynch. And do they,
who have conquered their territory by
assassination, wish to give lessons to
the Spaniards in humanitarisimo?"
The papers teemed with inflammable
philippics, the wrath of the people
mounted steadily higher. Then came
the news that broke the floodgates of
angry passions. The Yale students had
burned in effigy their beloved little
King Alfonso XIII I The people did not
realize that it was but the hot-headed
action of youthful students. They took
it as an added insult from the United
States, and goaded on by a thirst for
revenge, the thought of the indignity
put upon the little kins, rankling deep
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 1898.
in every proud and patriotic heart, they
threw restraint to the winds. Through
the streets of Madrid swayed that
hydra-headed monster â the mob.
As by a single impulse it moved
straight toward the home of the Ameri
can Minister. The savage was upper
most, and with fierce exultation in the
glow that comes when passions long re
strained are given free rein, the mob
gave vent to its wrath by stoning Min
ister Taylor's house.
"Buenol" shouted the people of San
Sebastian when they heard of it, and
"Bueno!" -echoed the rest of Spain.
But by nightfall San Sebastian was
one mass of fluttering banners, flags,
streamers, wreaths and garlands. A
feverish populace impatiently â¢waited
for the morrow when the little king,
the queen and the two infantas with
their retinue should arrive for a two
fold purpose: to bid godspeed and in
spire courage in the 5000 soldiers who
had responded to the call of "more men
for Cuba," and to temporarily forget
court life in the capital on the pretty
little beach of San Sebastian set apart
for the royal family and called "the
concha."
As an American girl, you may think
that I ought to have resented the mal
edictions that filled the air on "Los
Americanos." To the contrary, I felt
an unbounded sympathy for the frantic
Spaniards. After all they were not
more ignorant of our country than the
majority of Americans are of Spain.
As a student, I had come to Spain
with distorted conceptions of her peo
ple. But a year's sojourn among them
had corrected all this. Living among
them as I did I could see clearly that
there was some right and justice on
Spain's side.
Onr house being well known as the
home of Americans, we were in a
quandary as to whether or not we
should fly our beloved flag o*n the day
of the fete when the Queen should ar
rive. It was the custom of all the
foreign residents to hang their respec
tive flags alongside of the Spanish flag
from their balconies on the annual fete
day celebrating the arrival of the
royal family at San Sebastian. But in
the state of feverish excitement the
flying of the American colors might
rouse the mob, as it did when Minister
Taylor's house was stoned. On the
other hand if we did not raise our
colors the people might regard It as a
sign that we did not wish to pay proper
respect to the royal family.
A note from the Alcalde quickly set
tled the difficult question. "Fly your
colors," he said. "I pledge you protec
tion." Ten minutes afterward, at his
order, twenty civil guards quietly sta
tioned themselves around our house.
At 7 o'clock in the morning I was
awakened by shouts that gradually
rose into clear distinctiveness: "The
soldiers! the soldiers! the soldiers have
come!"
. Every house in town emptied itself
as though by magic, and not one nor
two nor three thousand people but all
San Sebastian rushed to the station to
enthusiastically greet the royal party.
An hour later, swelled by the voices
of the 5000 soldiers, came the cry, "The
King!" "The King!" The bands struck
up "La Marcha Real," and the people
shouted themselves hoarse, as the royal
family drove through the streets to the
summer palace. Arrived there the pop
ulace turned again and made a mad
rush for the boulevard where, in the
presence of the royal family, the Arch
bishop was to give a solemn mass for
the departing soldiers.
Long before 10 o'clock, the appointed
hour, every inch of space was packed
with an excited throng, whose volatile
temperament permitted it to change in
an instant from a passion-tossed popu
lace to men and women with reverence
in the heart and prayer on the lips for
their beloved rulers. The 5000 soldiers
filed in solemn lines into the open space
allotted them, and high above all, on a
spacious platform erected for the occa
sion, stood the altar, before which knelt
the Archbishop, the assisting priests
arid the royal family. The impressive
service was chanted to the accompani
ment of the low and mournful boom
of the ocean waves as they broke
against the stone walls.
It was a sight which neither time nor
change can ever efface. In the rear the
deserted city, silent as a city of the
dead; to the front the kneeling multi
tude with bowed heads and tearful
eyes, their black garments in sharp
contrast to the azure of the sky, for be
it known there is scarcely a family in
Spain that has not lost some relative
in the Cuban struggle, and nearly ev
ery woman and child is in mourning.
In front of this almost weeping
crowd marched line upon line of sol
diers, clad in dark blue denim suits,
their knapsacks and an extra pair of
shoes flung over their shoulders, the
officers in the same sort of uniform,
save that their cuffs and collars were
decorated with stars. Less than a
week before those soldiers had lived
leagues apart, but the common cause,
the preservation of Cuba for the mother
country, Spain, had drawn them to
gether and on this solemn march to the
front.
Over half of the loyal fellows in the
marching ranks were mere boys. The
country had been almost drained of its
men.
The gorgeous altar there on the street
of San Sebastian, the splendid robes of
the priests, the pale blue gowns of the
two princesses, furnished the only dash
of color. The Queen in her simple gray
gown and bonnet, and the little King,
the delicate contour of his face brought
out in relief by his close-fitting blue
uniform, stood side by side as the Arch
bishop finished the services.
From whore I stood I could see the
frail form of the boy King shake with
suppressed sobs, and the Queen gazed
for a moment at the pathetic picture
before her, and then shuddered and
covered her face with her hands until
she could regain her composure.
Not one in our party could restrain
from sobbing at the pathetic sight.
At the last word from the Archbish
op the royal family, their faces bathed
in tears, descended from the altar and
were quickly whirled away in car
riages.
The people lined the entire way, on
either side, from the boulevard to the
station, where the trains waited â to
bear the soldiers the mile or two to
San Xander, whence the ships set sail
for Cuba. Those two miles were one
long line of sobbing men and women.
Every barrier of birth and pride was
broken down, heart to heart they met
oh the common ground of human sym
pathy. The proud senora of aristo
cratic birth saw in some obscure coun
try youth a resemblance to her own
boy in far off Cuba, and gave him a
token for luck. Women and girls
stripped themselves of their jewels and
flung them at the soldiers. Men held
out their purses to the passing soldiers.
I saw the pretty flower girl who every
morning brought us a basket of blos
soms unfasten the little gold pin which
I gave her and for which she had over
whelmed me with endless thanks, and
without a sigh of regret at losing her
one trinket, she fastened it on the coat
of a soldier who had not received a
parting token.
At the station the crowd surged
around the trains that were packed to
Buffocation with the soldiers.
How the people cheered! How they
called on heaven to help their cause!
When a messenger broke through
their ranks and distributed among the
soldiers little crosses ,as a parting gift
from their boy King you could hav6
heard the cheers miles away.
And so midst tears and shouts, hand
wavings and kisses, prayers and bless
ings, bearing with them all the money
and jewels that the impulsive people
had thrown them, the soldiers departed.
On the following day San Sebastian
again shouted "Bueno!" foT the news
came that the beautiful hotel in Gra
nada called Washington Irving, In
honor of the American who made that
city and the Alhambra famous, had
had its name officially changed.
MIRANDA MASON.
CHANCES IN THE WORLD FOR BOYS.
By Henry E. Highton.
Manifestly, it would be impossible
even to consider the deeper and under
lying reasons which in recent years
have affected industrial conditions,
and still less possible to 'discuss
the remedy. The unnatural con
flict which has been so long
raging between capital and labor has
tended to destroy the middle men,
through whom the greater part of the
business of the world was formerly
transacted; to derange the equipoise of
industry, and to illustrate what Tenny
son calls "the falsehood of extremes."
Of the terrible evils affecting labor of
every kind which have already resulted
from this conflict I have no doubt
whatever; but I am equally convinced
that they constitute phenomena, de
plorable in themselves, but through
which a better order is to be secured
and a higher development attained.
First â You ask me whether, in my
opinion, a boy has as good a chance in
the world now as when I was a boy.
My answer is "Yes" and "No." Thfat
a boy could have as good a chance to
make his way now as then I firmly be
lieve. That the average boy actually
has I do not believe. The reason is
to be found in the average boy him
self, and that not through his own
fault.
When I came to this Coast, nearly
fifty years ago, it was easier to earn a
livelihood than it is to-day, but, at the
same time, two facts coexisted, first,
average boys, in all the gradations of
life, from the manual to the intel
lectual, were brought up to work and
were trained and developed at home,
and, second, girls were not their com
petitors. In 1898, while the necessity
for labor is greater, these conditions
are reversed. The problem of life
among boys is largely how to live
without work, and girls are pushing
their way into all industrial occupa*
tions. These facts are due to the re
laxation of home training and to edu
cation, which rises intelligence and
stimulates ambition without a definite
object. The result is that the profes
sions and mercantile business are over
crowded by men who are above man
ual toil and unfit for intellectual
achievements, and, in the struggle for
existence and for unfruitful and lux
urious existence, the standard of right
and wrong is lowered. Hence the enor
mous increase of politicians, to whom
government is a goose to be plucked,
and who aim to convert official life
into a form of paternalism which ia
supposed to supply the deficiencies of
the people themselves. It is true that
combinations, both of capital and of
labor, have obstructed the approaches
to many forms of industry. But, .when
this is conceded, still the chief trouble*'
with the average boy of the present
day could be removed by the resurrec
tion of the home and by such improve
ments in our splendid educational sys
tem as would prepare every boy and
every girl for some definite employ
ment as well as for the discharge of
their ordinary duties in relation to
each other and to the world.
Second â Do you think industrial con
ditions have become so harsh in this
country as to make the outlook
gloomy?
Answer â Undoubtedly there Is much
hardship in existing conditions, but I
do not consider the outlook "gloomy."
With all our faults, and notwithstand
ing the evils against which we have to
contend, the average standard of ma
terial and intellectual life in the United
States is higher than in any
other country and much higher
than it was fifty years ago.
Our resources and our opportu
nities are virtually unlimited. As we
approach the end of the century,
amidst fill the darkness which has
overspread industry for a number of
years, the dawn of a brighter epoch
can be distinctly observed.
Third â What trade or business do
you think offers the most hope for the
rising generation?
Answer â No segregated trade or
business, but, referring comprehen
sively to the Pacific Coast, all the
trades and all the business included in
agriculture, horticulture, sugar-beet
culture and mining.
Fourth â Do you believe machinery
and trusts have made it practically im
possible for the average poor boy to
get far above the station in which he
was born?
Answerâ As to machinery, I answer
in the negative, because I believe that
machinery has increased the demand
for labor and improved its quality. As
to trusts, in their relation to "the aver
age poor boy," as in many other rela
tions. I regard them as injurious, but
not to the extent suggested by the
question. All forms of monopoly, in
cluding trusts, tend to place the poor
at the mercy of the rich, and thus to
obstruct the aspirations of youth. But
I am quite satisfied that, in spite of the
trusts in the United States, the "aver
age poor boy" can raise himself, by
study and industry, good habits and
reasonable economy.18
BRICK OF KING SARGON I-NIPPUR.
WITHIN the past thr<*e years
surprising discoveries have
been made in Babylonia by
the scholars of Europe and
America. They are of such
a character as to unsettle
much that has been accepted by the
world for centuries. At the present
time Assyriologists are busily engaged
in furthering the work, with the hope
of supplementing the discoveries al
ready made. France, England and the
United States have men of scholarship
and excavators of courage on the scene
âall engaged in an endeavor to get to
the uttermost date.
. The work now in progress will be ac
tively pushed for many years to come.
The illustrations accompanying this
article, loaned by Dr. Hilpreeht of the
University of Pennsylvania expedition,
will give a good general idea of the re
sults of the excavations. The meanings
of these fragments, worse than the pro
verbial Greek to the layman, are eas
ily mastered by the Assyriologists, and
it is by means of these examples that
the history of the world has been car
ried back so many thousands of years.
Two years ago Sargon I and Xarain
Sin were believed by the world to rep
resent the earliest stage of civilization,
the father and son reigning in Baby
lonia in succession a few hundred
years less than four thousand before
the birth of Christ. And even this was
not wholly conceded, no less a scholar
than Niebuhr contending that these
two kings were unhistorieal and th^ir
reigns only legendary. But the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania expeditir.-n some
time since established the existence of
these two kipgs beyond all doubt. Nu
ns monuments of these rulers have
been brought to light in the mounds of
Nippur, oldest of the world's cities. Not
only this, but there have been un
earthed from beneath the ruins of the

cuneiform scripts by which history can
now be written backward three thou
sand years beyond tho days of Sargon.
The cuneiform scripts of Sargon and
his son and those of Nebuchadnezzar
are after all not very dissimilar, while
the texts found deep dcrwn below the
temple of Bel (Baal) are to those of the
>n period as is the writing of a
child to that of a man. The French ex
pedition, which has been at work far
ther south, confirms these general re
sults and places the age of. the world,
in civilization, from seven thousand t_/
ten thousand years before Christ. Thus
Sargon I, instead of representing the
dawn of civilization, can stand for lit
tle more than the middle chapter of the
ages before Christ. The whole effect of
the great w<>rk is confirmatory of the
Bible No conflict can result between
the new B. C. 7000 and the Biblical B.
C. 4004. This Biblical date was fixed
by the scholars of two hundred and
fifty years ago, who were as wise in the
matter as the excavations and tradi
tions of their period permitted.
The work has been done under the
greatest of difficulties. The famous
English explorer Sir Henry Layard re
tired discouraged from the great mound
of Nippur, where the American expedi
tion has toiled for several years, in the
campaign previous to the present for
thirty-four months continuously, often
in heat of 120 degrees in the shade,
with sand storms and biting insects as
almost constant terrors, and with
treacherous Arabs, very willing to rob
and kill, as frequent companions. The
first American expedition left the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania in ISBB. Since
that time about $100. 000 has been ex
pended, contributed by a few citizens
of Philadelphia. The work of the first
expedition covered the period of 1888
89. The staff consisted of Dr. John P.
Peters, director; W. Herman v. Hil
precht. Assyriologist, and J. H. Haynes,
excavator.
The laborers, 200 Arabs, were fur
nished by the Turkish Government,
which has always, through Dr. Hil
precht, been a party to the work. Tur
key has had its reward as the excava
tions have progressed in the increase of
Its store of objects of antiquity.
The second expedition, entering the
field later, in 1889, resumed the work
with 400 Arabs, securing some 8000 tab
lets, several stamps in terra cotta, hun
dreds of vases bearing inscriptions, and
many bowls and other antiquities.
It was from this expedition that came
the sensational results. For three years
the members of the expedition worked,
pursuing their purpose beneath the
burning sun for nearly three years
without cessation. Inspired by the ever
opening, ever widening discoveries re
vealed to them as they delved down
deep beneath the temple of Bel. There
was made a thorough examination of
the lower strata of the temple as de
pcribed by Dr. Hllprechi in his monu
mental work, "The Babylonian Expedi
tion of the University of Pennsyl
vania." Three sections were excavated
down to the water level of the old de
parted river Shatt-en-NIL A systematic
study of Babylonian drainage was
made and the two most ancient arches
of Babylonia were unearthed by Mr.
Haynes. Structures built by Naram
Sin and pre-Sargonlc buildings and
vases were found. Four hundred tombs
of various periods and forms were ex
cavated and their contents saved.
Twenty-one thousand cuneiform tablets
were found and taken away, tablets
containing history as plainly written to
the Assyriologist as are the text books
of our colleges and universities to their
students to-day.
Many fragments were also found,
among them contracts dated in the
reign of Dungi, son of I'r-(;ur, of many
Cassit"' kings hitherto unknown, of Da
rius and of Artaxerxes Mnemon. The
torso of an inscribed statue, hundred*
of vase fragments, ruins of what was
an old fountain in terra cotta baa re
lief, water cocks, drain tiles, fifty clay
coffins and burial urns â these were
among the other finds. The
savants of Europe and Amer
ica agree that by the great
results obtained, the studies of ancient
history, paleography and philology
have been badly upset and a universal
revision is held to be necessary.
The vast ruins of the Temple of Bel
are situated near the empty bed of the
Shatt-en-Nil, which divided Nippur
Into two parts. Out of the midst of
the ruins there arises a conical mound,
whose top is about one hundred feet
above the level of the surrounding

plain. The crest c.-f the mound is about
lil'tj- feet above the surrounding debris.
In this mound are the ruins of the
great Temple of Bel. To the care of
this temple the kings of Babylonia ap
plied ihemselves as to a religion.
Shrines were added, its beauties were
enhanced, and there is every evidence
that the sanitary arrangements were
good and that they were not allowed to
fall into bad condition.
At the time of Ur-Gur, B. C. 2800, the
ziggurat, or temple tower, stood on the
northwestern edge of an immense plat
form which formed the pavement of the
whole temple inclosure. This platform
was made entirely of sun-dried bricks,
not inscribed, identical "with the mass
of crude bricks forming the body of the
temple tower. Below the platform of
Ur-Gur was another pavement, consist
ing of two courses of burned brick.
These were fifty centimeters square and
eight centimeters thick. Most of them
were stamped. Dr. Hllprecht believes
that the inscriptions on these bricks
and on some door sockets establish the
identity of Shargani-Sharali with Sar
gon I, and states that this second plat
form was apparently laid by Sargon
and relaid by his son, Naram-Sin.
Another striking illustration of the
activity of Naram-Sin was found In the
ruins of the outer wall of the city. The
foundation of this wall was placed on
solid clay, two-thirds of a meter be
low the water line of the river, or five
meters below the plane of the desert.
This foundation was built of worked
clay with cut straw, and was raised to
a height of five and a half meters. The
top of the foundation was thirteen and
three-quarters meters wide, and upon
this, it is Justifiable to assume, a great
wall was raised to some unknown
height. The ruins of this wall, were
there nothing else, would establish the
leading position of Nippur in the world
during that city's existence.

PAFERS.WAR TRICKS THAT CHINA TAUGHT TOUR BIG NATIONS.
CRUELYiES THAT THE CHINESE SOLDIERS
PRACTICED ON CAPTURED
WHITE 'DEVILS.
THE nations of Europe Â«re eying China with a
good deal of curiosity now. They're wondering^
just how much she'll stand, and whether, when"
driven to a corner, she'll adopt the same tactics
she did in the famous series of wars that threw
or^n so many of her sealed ports to the commerce of
tre world.
The nations of the world, and practically the same

preceding centuries. The nations rather condemned
John Bull when he walloped the Yellow Dragon in the
"opium war" of 1542. But John Chinaman learned a
great deal of Caucasian ways and warfare in that
brief set-to, and when, nearly a score of years later,
the European concert came playing around his shores,
hÂ« opened up the game in quite a confident spirit.
Yeh, the Chinese Commissioner at Canton, who
conducted affairs much as though he was Director-
General of the Orient, seized the "Arrow," a lorcha
flying the British colors, blew them to the winds,
flung the Chinese crew (who claimed to be British
subjects) into jail, and told the protesting representa
tives to go to Potsdam for redress or anything else
they wanted. Later this oily and independent diplo
mat, when he was cornered and forced to make some
sort of treaties and promises, readily and greedily
made all sorts of treaties and promises. He agreeably
signed all sorts of papers, but when the European
diplomats were out of sight he locked up the treaties
in an old box, instead of forwarding them to his
home Government, and forgot his promises. Later
these same treaties, dirt begrimed and soiled, were
discovered among his effects by the wrathful Euro
peans. They were found to be most useful then to
burn up what remained of his abandoned garbage.
The English finally determined to bring this oily
old Pooh Bah to time, so they sent four war vessels
to bombard Canton, his headquarters. That oily Pooh
Bah, Teh, knew a thing: or two in an Oriental way,
and he soon had the United States, Russia and France
pounding before the doors of Canton. But instead of
wrangling among themselves over the spoils, as he
had figured, they agreed that he ought to be burned
out. Yeh withstood them as long as his rice-fed sol
diers would fight; then, in an explosion of over
twenty-five big war Junks and the blaze of all of
Canton's public buildings, they ran him to Calcutta,
where he was locked up. The plenipotentiaries of all
the attacking powers rummaged among his papers,
and when they discovered how he had bamboozled
them In his crafty Oriental fashion, they determined
to make a lasting lesson on China. Through Yen's
deception, all their diplomatic work had been for
naught, so they began to consult on the best way of
dealing directly with the head of the Government,
and not through its tricky agents. This consultation
led to the famous advance on Peking by the combined
powers and the discovery of "mysterious" Cnina.
All the while all sorts of tricks, horrors and cru
elties were being perpetrated on the Caucasians when
ever the Celestials could catch them napping. The
white soldiers soon discovered that new tactics were
needed to meet the yellow soldiers' style of warfare.
Even after the first defeats the Chinese were not
to be trusted, and the allies had to be ever on the
valert to guard against their treacherous and cruel
An attempt was made, after the
rail of Canton, to poison the waters at Hongkong and
destroy the whole community, but, luckily, the plot
was discovered in time.
The advance of the war vessels of the four powers
to the entrance of the Peiho River was a memorable
event in Chinese history. Four great forts, deemed
to be impregnable, guarded that entrance. It was
the gateway to Peking. While the diplomats were
discussing what to do, and the plenipotentiaries were
bundling Mr. Astute Commissioner Yeh off to Cal
cutta, myriads of Chinese were actively at work
strengthening their forts on the river. But the four
powers, after several days' cannonading and shelling,
brought the Chinese to terms and they decided it was
prudent to sign several of the treaties that Commis
sion Yeh had dealt with so glibly and lightly.
Diplomatic sparring followed for two years; then
the Chinese thought themselves again in condition
to make a few changes in the old agreements. Each

stripped for the fray each knew it was for blood,
property and a historic record. Certain it is that the

the utmost vigilance was observed by tnose on duty
as floating torpedoes and fire rafts -were continually
being launched by the Chinese. Should one of these
have exploded it would have destroyed the whole fleet.
It was during this blockade that the British ship
Niger was made the victim of one of the most das
tardly and disgusting plots in history. Late one
very dark night, the Chinese launched a villainous
junk of strange build that floated Gown onto the
British vessel. An attempt was .made to tow it clear,
but before this could be done there was an explosion
that ripped the upper decks off the junk ami filled
tut- air with the most disgusting material and scat

Niger was never used again. She was taken back
to England and dismantled.
i;ners who unluckily fell into the hands of
the Ohlnesi 1 were subjected to the most cruel and
brutal kind of tortures, which were made to last as
long as the victims had any life left in them, and
when that was about extinct they were finally sliced
to pieces.

little too much "Samshoo," wandered outside the lines

every attempt waa made to rescue him, he was never
THE SAX FB Ay CISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBBTTABY 13, 1898.
The Chineee lost no time in strengthening the
approaches to Tientsin. The forts at the entrance to
the Peiho River were entirely reconstructed and more
heavily armed with superior guns, and the approaches
by sea and land made almost impregnable. The river
was "boomed" and rendered almost imm-.vigable, and
torpedoes were sunk at all points of the entrance to
the river, but fortunately they proved to be harmless.
In the summer the British fleet again appeared off
the Peiho River for the purpose of ratifying the
treaty made and signed at Tientsin the year before,
but this time to meet with defeat, for upon the gun
boats attempting to- enter the river the heaviest kind
of a fire was opened upon them and three vessels were
sunk. Of a landing party of about 1000 men who at
tempted to storm and, take the large fort on the
south bank of the river, 470 men were killed.
It was here that the Chinese again resorted to
their peculiar tricks. Ditches, dug in front of the
forts and filled with slush, were covered over with
grass and weeds so aa to look like solid ground. The
soldiers who attempted to cross them instantly sank
from sight and suffocated. Besides this, there were
scattered over the ground bamboo spikes that were
capable of cutting through the strongest boot and
crippling the soldiers. Then there was a sort of iron
frame that held a pointed spear pointed in the direc
tion of the attack. This was concealed by weeds so
that the soldier who ran against it with any force was
impaled and hung until death relieved him of his mis
eries. Noisome stuff was scattered everywhere.
During the attack Admiral Sir James Hope was
severely wounded while on the bridge of his little
"tender," the Coromandel. and did not leave his post
until the whole of the killed and wounded had been
recovered and the flotilla of gunboats had withdrawn
from beyond the range of the Chinese guns.
An incident occurred at this time which reflects
the greatest honor on the American navy. Commo
dore Tatnell, in his flagship, the frigate I'owhattan,
was with the English fleet. During the engagement
he was the guest and companion of Sir James Hope.
The two brave men stood side by side on the bridge
of the Coromandel. A huge round shot carried off
half the "pivot gun's" crew, and Commodore Tatnell,
quickly taking in the situation, called his coxswain
and boat's crew up from their boat to fill up the va
seen again by his countrymen. It was
learned afterward that he had been
gradually chopped to bits by having a
finger, toe, ear or some other portion
of his body amputated every day, this
gradual execution lasting several
weeks.
Upon another occasion, four British
marines were "cut off" near Canton,
and during the days of their captivity
were compelled to eat the vilest kind of
food, while their thirst was only al
lowed to be quenched by the most stag
nant water. Only one of them sur
vived the horrible tornture to tell
the tale. He died a day or two after
his rescue.
cant gun numbers, and thus, for the first time in
naval history, American and British tars fought side
by side. The round shot which severely wounded the
British admiral was the messenger of death to the
brave American coxswain, who fell dead while firing
a British gun. The commodore felt his loss keenly,
and remarked to Sir James, who was being "propped
"P" in an arm chair: "Blood is thicker than water."
This remark had a double meaning and is now a his
toric one in both navies.
The officers and men of the old Powhattan did all
they could to assist their wounded British cousins.
Lieutenant Semmes, of subsequent fame in the Con
federate navy, was executive officer of the Powhat
tan and behaved nobly on that disastrous occasion.
It was next to impossible to renew hostilities that
year, as it was found impracticable to capture the
place without the aid of land troops and artillery,
and nothing further was attempted until the follow
ing year.
The news of this disaster spread great consterna
tion among civilized nations. The European nations
began to dread that the Chinese dragon had at last
been roused. Great Britain and France lost no time
in meeting the threatened emergency. They set about
actively preparing fleets sufficiently powerful to cap
ture the whole coast of China if necessary. The
navy yards of those two countries were kept busy for
the better part of eight months in equipping and dis
patching the necessary war vessels to the China seas.
Merchant vessels were chartered to carry troops,
horses and the various munitions of war to the
Orient, and all the then-famed American-Chtna clip
pers were chartered by the British Government to
convey coal from Japan to the coming seat of war.
By the early part of 1860 there were in the Chinese
seas nearly 300 English and French war vessels of
all classes, besides an immense fleet of English,
French and American merchant steamers and sailing
vessels, used as transports.
The British army was composed of regiments of
regular cavalry, infantry, artillery, etc., besides drafts
from the most famed Indian cavalry and infantry
regiments. The French A\aa composed mainly of ma
rines, artillery and Algerian troops, Ooth armies
being well equipped as regards their commissaries,
hospital and other necessary non-combative corps,
in addition to whicl) the British had the C C. C.'s
(Chinese Coolie corps), a body of picked Chinese,
mainly recruited from Canton. (Many of these, it
was afterward learned, had been fighting against
them at that place.) This time they were officered
from the Royal Marines.
When hostilities were resumed, the Chinese ex
pected the same kind of tactics as had been employed
the year before, and were prepared for them. But
the English and French officers knew that the forts
were practically impregnable from the front, and it
was no part of the campaign to make the attack
that way.
All the cavalry. Infantry and artillery were landed
on both sides of the river, completely surprising the
Chinese, who had never thought of a flank movement.
The first fort was captured almost without resist
ance, most of the Celestials fleeing to tne forts fur
ther up the river. It was here that there was heavy
fighting that lasted two days, but ended in the almost
complete destruction of the forts. Heavy artillery
was brought up and the shelling was fearful. On the
last day the Chinese were driven out through the
front of their fort onto the villainous death traps
they had set for the English and French. Here they
were compelled to take their own medicine, and thou
sands were suffocated in the mud ditches, crippled on
the bamboo spikes and impaled on the spears. The
Chinese had been taught their lesson, and the author
ities were only too glad to sign treaties that opened
their ports to the world.
CAPTAIN GEORGE E. JACKSON.
HEROES OF HEBREW PLAY-WRITING.
FANCY turning out eight plays a year for the
stage. Yet that is what one of the dramatic
writers for the Hebrew stage does, and he
thinks nothing of it. Usually he scatters in a
half dozen extra plays for holiday productions.
The up-tc-date writers that provide Hebrew plays
for the stage are a peculiar lot. Turning out a pro
digious quantity of acts, scenes and dialogues in a
given time is not their most surprising qualification.
At present four of them furnish, ready made, the ma
terial for the Hebrew drama for the most of the world.
The Hebrew dramatic company goes stocked with
dramatic material wherever it travels. Mr. Greenbergr,
manager of the German-Hebrew Opera Company now
playing at the Bush-street Theater, carries the manu-
script of 200 plays. In speaking of this style of thÂ«
drama as an industry, he said:
"Abraham Goldfaden is the father of Hebrew the
atricals â that is, as a profession and pursuit â in thiÂ«
century. He started his first company in Roumania
twenty years ago. It failed there, but being trans
planted to Odessa, Russia, it succeeded. His company,
has since played in all the principal cities of Europe.
The past year the company has been in Paris, where
Goldfaden resides.
"Goldfaden is the best known author connected '
with the Hebrew drama. He has written over 100
plays. The entire repertoire of his Parisian company
is his work. The authors who are writing for the He
brew stage in America are Professor Joseph Lateiner,
Professor Abraham Horwitz and Professor Sharkan
sky. The most successful of this trio financially la
Professor Lateiner. He is 45 years old, of Roumanian
parents and has lived in the United States about ten
years. During that period he has written over 200
plays, the most successful being 'Moses in Egypt.'
"He is under contract with a New York theater to
â write not less than eight plays every year. He shares
the profits of the plays with the managers of the the
ater and gets no bonus for his manuscript. 'Alexan
dre,' one of his plays, ran an entire year in New York.
He does all of his literary work after midnight.
"The most learned and intellectual of these threÂ«
writers is Professor Abraham Horwitz. He Is about
60 years old and a Galician by birth. He speaks eight
languages. Over 200 plays from his pen have apv
peared. An indefatigable toiler, he has been known to
write constantly eighteen consecutive hours.
"About two years ago one of Professor Horwitz's
plays failed so completely that after the first night
the managers told him that they must take It off and
put on a tried play instead. Far from being down
cast, Professor Horwitz at once set to work and three
days later he called at the theater with three fin
ished acts of 'The Love of Jerusalem.'
"The play was at once rehearsed and staged ancl
scored an immense success. Professor Horwitz has a
weekly income of several hundred dollars, for most
of his plays have great and lasting stability. The re
ceipts from his play, 'Kouzri, or the Jews in Caucasus,'
have been over $50,000 to date. Upon the production
of his dramatic opera, 'King Solomon,' nearly $2000
was expended.
"Of Professor M. Sharkansky, the youngest of
these writers, not much can be said as yet, excepting
that in his work he gives promise of becoming the
foremost man of his kind when his present contempo
raries have written themselves out or have died. He
is about 35 years of age and has been in this country
only five years. He has written but two :>lays, both,
however, instantaneous successes. His 'Kol Nidre, or
the Persecution in Spain,' saved a Hebrew theater in
New York from closing its doors.
"He is the most eccentric and erratic of these
writers. He seldom works more than three hours a
day, v and takes months in the preparation of a play.
But^-hat he has written will no doubt be lasting."
"So many plays of this kind have already been
written," I suggested, "is it not extremely difficult for
these writers to find new plots and new ways of treat
ing themes?"
"Not at all," answered Mr. Ore^nberg. "You see,
the treatment in all cases is the sameâ that is, the
spirit pervades the treatmentâand is absolutely fa
vorable to the Jews, of course. Otherwise it would
not be a play for a Hebrew audience. All the plays
are written around Biblical, Jewish historical inci
dents or Jewish folklore. One has but to read and cull
therefrom what he considers worthy and suitable to
dramatic treatment. And one must admit there Is no
limit to opportunity for plays in these directions.
Why, a mere incident will often serve as material for
a four-act play. Around David and his harp Pro
fessor Lateiner has woven his latest play. This has
been running for six weeks already in New York."

EDUCATING CHILDREN
BY PICTURES
Unique System That Is Being Developed
by an Oakland Man Who Is Trying
to Revolutionize the Schoolroom.
MANT suggestions have from \
time to time been made as to
the improvement of our pub-
He school system, but none
has struck quite so unique a j
vein as has G. L. Faust of j
Oakland. Mr. Faust has given the !
subject of child education much
thoughtâ in fact, so much so that he
has evolved a new system which he
hopes some day to see supersede even
the most advanced systems now in
practice. He has styled the public
school room of to-day as "slaughter
pen of time and mind." This little
thing has worried him so much that
he is now writing a book which will
tell about his new theory in practi
cal use and will be an eye-opener to
teachers and a mind-opener to pupils.
Mr. Faust apparently is a man
about 55 years of age, of gentlemanly
bearing, and neither in dress, manner
nor conversation does he bear the Im
print of a "crank"; neither would one
suspect at a casual glance that this
man, G. L. Faust, is a man ambitious
to revolutionize the world in thought,
action and mind development, but,, this
is just what his theory is intended to
do.
He has the most advanced method
or system of object teaching yet
thought of; in fact, object teaching as
now practiced is but a mere kinder
garten affair as compared with the
Faust system. In order to follow the
system evolved by Mr. Faust there is
required the most unique school
rbom ever designed. He even goes
further, and to the schoolroom adds
parks, recreation grounds and numer
ous similar adjuncts.
According to Mr. Faust's idea, as set
forth in the manuscript of his book,
each 100 children should have a rec
reation park of about five acres, set
out with all kinds of plants, trees and
shrubs and flora in general and pe
culiar to the particular climate. Here
the children pass their time when not
in the recitation-room. The latter
opens from the park and each room is
designed to accommodate twenty pu
pils.
Along the sides of the room are ar
ranged little cells or compartments,
each of which is occupied by a child.
The cell is constructed so as to shut
out everything from the observer save
it view in front, and that glass front is
a magnifying lens. To be sure, there
is the aperture above, but all else is
inclosed. This inclosed space he has
provided with what he claims to be an
excellent system of Ventilation. Over
the opening at the top of the cell and
at an angle above them are mirrors,
in which is reflected the facial ex
rion and every movement of the
QUEER PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN AT A MINISTERS' PICNIC
"Speculation is both lawful and profitable," paid the pho
tographer at Pacific Grove, Monterey County. Cal.. as 1 R -
'.â¢ing- the beautiful results of his skill in delineating the
and forest grandeur near by. "See! This is the most
n markable scene in my collection, and the more I study It the
more I ask the question, What is it?"
The picture which he handed me represented a group of
eighteen people and a dog, posed against a background of tall.
. r pines. Each member of it was standing but six. four of
whom were children seated upon the grass and upon whom the
light seemed focused.
To the left of the picture, seated securely in a half reclining
position among the highest branches of the loftiest trees, was
the shadowy yet distinctly outlined form of a little girl, clad in
white, with folded hands, hair flowing from beneath a turbaned
cap and placidly watching the scene beneath her.
The lower limbs of the child were concealed in a haze which
extended several yards around her, and the group was uncon
scious of her presence.
Truly, it was at the first glance a remarkable picture, calcu
lated to awaken the wildest conjecture concerning things
deemed occult to those who see nothing but what is revealed
through their senses. Being of an investigating turn, I asked:
"Under what conditions was this obtained?"
"The simplest imaginable," he answered. "The date was
May 1: the time, high noon, and the occasion a May-day pi>-

was blowing at a moderate pace over the sandhills, which
were south of us about 150 yards. The sand ridge i.s about
seventy feet high and almost as white as snow. A few scat
tering shrubs adorn its surface. The ocean was 700 yards
southwest of us."
"And who composed the party?" I asked. "Some one may
have been victimizing you."
"Impossible," he quickly answered, "for a more orthodox,

up that party of Methodist ministers, their wives and chil

"The picture was instantaneous and I made but one im
pression. The plate used was *C. Dry Plato No. 28,' size five
by eight inches, and the development was made three hours
aftr the exposure."
"What was your imprsslnn when first you saw it?'* I asked.
"I was astonished, of course, as was every member of the
group.. Fraud, as you see. was out of the question. One of
the reverend doctors said, 'It' is an optical illusion.' I said, 'I
have a spirit picture,' because 1 saw nothing improbable in
the circumstance. However. I rarely exhibit it to purchasers."
"We were standing in the rear of his tent as he spoke, and
I took a rapid survey of Mr. Adams' surroundings. He was a
traveling photographer. I'pon a shelf near me was his small

developed and harmonious. Veneration, causality, truthful
ness and a sense of moral responsibility seemed his in an un
usual degree.
Of course I purchased the mysterious picture.
"While revisiting the drove recently I encountered one of
the elderly men who had been in the group on that day of
May, and referring to the shadow of the child in the treetop,
said:
"Of course you have a theory of how the child's form got
there!"
He is a scientific man and rarely errs in his statements;
never, willingly. He replied:
"Oh, of course it was a kind of composite picture, that is
evident; a sort of mirageâ aâ a freak of nature easily ac
counted for byâ by natural laws in optics. Well, on the whole,
I cannot explain it. butâ hut 'tis there, you know."
Of course I know, and knowing. I still wonder what was it?

At the will of the teacher the chil

This new system of education pro
vides for the development of the body
as well as of the mind, and for that
reason he has given particular atten

justable seat and foot rest, so as to give
any desired angle or distance between
the two, and either may be raised and

is of a peculiar construction, and is
adjustable not only to the height of the
child but to the curvature of its spine.
It is to put in practical use this ad
vanced theory of object teaching that
Mr. Faust has designed such an oddity
of a schoolroom. The glass fronts to
the recitation cells are none other than
magnifying lenses. The teacher at will

Along the Sides of the Room Are Arranged Little Cells or Compartments, Each of Which Is Occupied by a Child.
views of such subjects as may be
chosen.
The originator would begin his edu
cation of children at the age of five
years or, as he puts it, "as soon as they j
can leave their mother's care."
Whon the child enters the school it i
â¢naturally goes to the primary class, |
where each child wears a number, and
in the primary class the numbers range
from one to five. It is by these nurn- \
; bers that the teacher is to distinguish
; the time of their recitation, and as to :
i what series of pictures shall be thrown
on the lenses.
All beginners start at number one, j
which number means that but one ob- i
j ject is to be thrown on the lens at a j
! time, and each object is so selected as j
: to be designated by a monosyllable, as
'â â  rat, cat, dog, man, etc. The word al- |
< ways accompanies the picture, and the !
child learns the name, or rather learns ;
; to identify the word with the object j
i until the two either together or sepa- I
' rately in this child's mind stand for
the same thing.
! These pictures will follow each other 1
in rapid succession. In the primary
stages of the teaching he suggests that
;i !>' . ut three pictures should be shown,
the idea being to train the child to
make mental observation quickly and
to retain in the memory what has been
seen. He says: "The child necessar
ily acquires the habit of attention, and
this Is the beginning of acquiring a
memory. The child knows what he
sees, and, mark this point, he learns
to tell what he knows. You know, it
has been said of men, "having eyes they
see not, and having ears they hear
not,' and there Should have been
added, "and the poor dumb creatures
cannot tell what little they know.' To
one who observes, h >w debasing It all
is. call it the prostitution of God
giv< ;i faculties."
"Now, with the number one," con
tinues Mr. Faust, "I would continue
the single object with the word and
object pictures following in rapid suc
cession until the pupil's memory had
so developed that he could follow at
least ten pictures shown in this way at
one drill. The pictures are changed at
each recital so as to have new objects
of interest. The special aim at this
time is rapidity in the succession of
the pictures so that the mind to its
capacity worked rapidly, and this is
th" cue point that is very desirable to
have fixed as a habit." Mr. Faust claims
that a mind well trained in this way
will cover more ground in a few mo
ments of time than will one of the
slow-going children of to-day in as
many hours. He also makes the as
sertion that the mind can be so devel
oped to rapid thought that It becomes
automatic in effect.
The children who have been tagged
No. 2 are those who have gone through
the training In which the pictures
thrown upon the lens consist of only
one object and one name and have
reached such a stage of development
that the pictures designed for them
comprise two words and two objects,
but in this instance both the objects
shown are animals.
The No. 3 grade pictures have three
objects, two <>f which are animals and
the third a bird, and accompanying
these objects are the three descriptive
wordsâ all monosyllables.
No. 4 follows in the same way, only
there are two animals and two birds,
and there are four words, and the dis
syllables begin to appear, but they are
such as the teacher would class as
"easy."
Then the No. 5 follows under the
same treatment, only there are three
birds and two animals in the picture
and there are ot course five words,
mostly monosyllables, but the dissyl
lables are more frequent and a trifle
more difficult than in No. 4.
When the child has gone through the
five numbers he Is then through with
Department No. 1 and Is ready for De
partment No. 2, which is a duplicate
of No. 1 and has Its five acres of park
and also an annex, which is a spacious
apartment in which in tiers and rows
under glass capes are ranged the flora
to be found in the park. There is also
an aquarium well filled and flowers
and animals in groups, all the work of
a skilled taxidermist. In the center of
the annex there will be a great variety
of seats, rests and inclines and provis
ion for instructive games.
In Department No. 2 the children
will be numbered from one to five.
They would occupy the same peculiar
cells, with the adjustable chair, foot
rest and shoulder-clamp.
The No. 1 children would be shown
pictures with six objects, of which
there are four birds and two animals,
one bird and one animal named in dis
syllables and the others in monosyl
lables. The next grade would be five
birds and one animal, and the next
four birds and one animal, and the
next three animals and three birds,
and in the fifth but two objects and
some words.
It is in this department that Mr.
Faust would have the children begin
to form sentences. It will be seen
from his arrangement of pictures that
the word "and" is the first connecting
word brought to their attention.
In further explaining his theory Mr.
Faust says: "I would not give exact
ly tiio same succession of pictures to
each child and here comes one of the
advantages of having the children iso
lated in cells rather than in a class, as
the teacher can then arrange a series
of views to accord with the progress
and the ability of each child. It would
be the business of the teacher to school
himself carefully to know what is best
in the way of succession for each
child, but always aiming far rapidity of
thought.
"I think the old teachers under o".r
present system will concur with mo In
saying that a child learns far more
readily by oral instruction than he Joes
by ciolving for it in books, and again
in imparting information in this >ral
way a vast deal in the way of effect
depends on the manner and method in
which it is done. Oral teaching is
something erf a science.
"The birds, animals and plants in the
anner.es to the various departments I
v.t.uld have selected and arranged with
special connection with the pictures
and subjects that will be displayed on
the lenses in recitation rooms of the
department with which the annex is
connected. As by my system the teach
er would be with the pupil while at
recreatic-n in the park or annex the
lesson would in reality continue there,
in fact, the recreation in the annex or
park under the instruction of the teach
ers would be a part of the lesson, for
It would be continued there orally."
Department No. 3 will be "a class
of emotions," and the pictures selected
are from every-day life scenes, such
as arc quite familiar to the children,
and tho subject of each picture forms
a simple but complete sentence. As to
what the pictures might be can best
be judged by a few sample sentences
such as "the babe smiles." "the* dog
plays with the calf," and "the hen picks
up a seed."
Tho object will be to show such pic
tures as would have in each something
that would arouse a dormant thought
and a dormant feeling. The idea would
bo to draw the mind of the child into
a condition of self-stimulation or self
action.
It is not until the child has reached
the fourth department that Mr. Faust
would let him out of his box or cell,
but even here it is his theory to sep
arate the child from his fellows,
though he is fully exposed while at
class. As Department No. 3 was de
voted to the emotions. Department No.
4 deals with idealization. A feature of
this method of teaching idealization is
the showing of pictures of parts of ani
mals â for instance, the head of a cow
or the head of a horse. The pupil has
been familiar with pictures of the
whole animal, and now that only the
head is shown the child Is supposed to
"idealize" for the rest of the animal.
Mr. Faust thinks that the children
in this department, when they have
heen dismissed to the annex or park
from the recitation room, should each
carry with them a pencil and tablet.
These he would attach to their waist
hands, so they could be prepared at all
times to idealize.
Department No. 5 will contain the
annex and park with a special view of
giving the children a more extended
system of geological, botanical and
zoological course of instruction.

IRELAND'S CENTENARY
Interesting Short History of the Fierce
Struggle Which Irishmen Are to
Commemorate This Year.
DURING the current year, IS9B, 1
Irishmen all the world over will
celebrate the centenary of the
last great armed struggle for
their country's independence. From
America, from Australia, and from ev
ery corner of the globe where the chil
dren of Ireland dwell visitors will, this
year, return for a brief commemorative
visit to the scene of the 1798 insurrec
tion.
As a result. Interest in that fierce
struggle against English supremacy in
the green isle has acquired a renewed
interest.
For the benefit of Irish-Americans a
bird's-eye view of the incidents of the
insurrection has been prepared. The
"Calendar of "98," as it may be termed,
has been carefully revised by John E.
Redmond, M. P., Mr. Parnell's successor
in the leadership of the Irish National
ist party. The review is accurate and
impartial, and will be a useful and
handy guide for those preparing to
visit Ireland during the year.
The following is the calendar:
May 27 â Outbreak of the insurrection.
On the previous day (May 26) a brigade
of yeomanry and militia had burned
the church of Boulavogue, of which
Rev. John Murphy was pastor. This
act Â« precipitated the rising. Boniires
were lighted along the Wexford hills,
and the people, armed with pikes,
poured in from all sides. The first fight
occurred in the afternoon at Oulart
Hill, Fr. Murphy leading the rebels.
The British were severely routed and
almost annihilated, only five redcoats
escaping from the field.
May 28 â Fr. Murphy mustered a large
force and led it against Enniacorthy.
Battle of Knnisoorthy. in which the
British were again defeated and the
town captured.
May 30â Fight of Three Rock Moun
tain. British routed with heavy loss.
Town of Wexford surrendered to the
Irish. Beauchamp Bagenal Harvey of
Barry Castle elected commander-in
chief of the insurgents, with Fr. Mur
phy second in command.
June Iârapture1 â rapture of Newtownbarry,
under Captain K>ogh, and subsequent
recapture by a large force of British
regulars during the night. Heavy loss
on both sides. On the same day the in-

surgents, under Rev. John Murphy,
were badly defeated at Ballycarrow.
These were the first serious checks re
ceived by the insurgents.
June 2 â Capture by the Irish forces
of Lord Klngsborough and several
British officers. Additional forces ar
rived from England, General Walpole
assuming command.
June 4 â Battle of Toberneering. The
Irish, armed chiefly with spikes, utterly
routed General Walpole and captured
his cannon. Pursuit of the British to
the town of Gorey. After an ineffect
ual attempt to capture the place by as
sault the insurgents laid siege to Wal
pole's fortifications.
June sâBattle5 â Battle of Ross. Three times
the Irish captured the town after great
loss. General Harvey showed incom
petence as a leader, and allowed drunk
enness and plundering. As a result,
the British returned with re-enforce
ments during the night and recaptured
the stronghold. The struggle for its
possession had lasted altogether thir
teen hours, and had been attendfi
with extraordinary bloodshed. General
Jones commanded the British.
June BâFormal8 â Formal deposition from the
insurgent leadership of Harvey, and
election of Rev. Philip Roche in his
stead. Harvey's weak command had,
however, done so much to demoralize
his men that Roche found almost in
surmountable difficulties in the way of
restoring order and discipline. Numer
ous skirmishes occurred, notably one at
Castlecomer, County Kilkenny, between
the rebels and a large force under Sir
Charles Asgil and the Earl of Ormonde.
The Irish defeated, and their leader,
Captain John Brennan, killed. The im
ported English miners in the Castle
comer collieries lent their aid against
the rebels.
June 9â Battle of Arklow, County
Wicklow. Several hours of severe fight
ing, resulting in a drawn battle, the
insurgents running short of ammuni
tion and retiring in good order. The
rebel leader, Rev. M. Murphy, killed by
a cannon ball. The Irish firmly in
trenched, repulsed a night attack with
heavy loss.
June 12â Defeat of the insurgents at
Barris, County Carlow. Skirmish of
Tinahely; the Irish victorious.
June 19â Second fight of Three Rocks
Mountain. The insurgent division of
Colonel Thomas Clooney, surrounded by
a far larger force of British regulars,
succeeded in cutting its way through
the redcoats; and when pursued, sud
denly faced about and routed the
enemy with considerable loss.
June 20 â Heavy defeat of the insur
gents after four and one-half hours of
severe fighting at Foulkes Mills. Ar
rival of second body of British rein
forcements from England and Wales.
June 22 â Battle of Vinegar Hill, Brit
ish fully armed and numbering 20,000
men, surrounded the Irish forces, which
consisted of only 2000 with firearms and
less than 10,000 with pikes and scythe
blades. CJeneral Lake commanded the
British: Rev. Philip Roche and Esmond
Kyan the Irish. The fight was long
and bloody, but such great superiority
in strength told in the end. The in
surgents were forced to abandon their
position and retreat. The defeat broke
the back of the rebellion. Commander
Roche and a number of others wera
slain.
June 23â A remnant of the insurgent
army crossed the river Barrow Into
Kilkenny County. Battle of Gores
bridge, in which the Irish under Rev.
John Murphy won a temporary victory.
The rising in the south closed with
the capture of Rev. John Murphy.

NATIONAL AND PRIVATE CONTESTS
FOR CLIPPERTON ISLAND.
THE question of the national sovereignty to which Clipperton Island
belongs is now being considered by Judge Seawell. The man who
discovered the island, unless vague accounts of a seventeenth cen
tury discovery by a French navigator are allowed, will be in court
as the plaintiff in the case.
The suit is that of Permien against the Oceanic Phosphate Compa
ny. The plaintiff. Captain Permien, is a rugged seafaring man over 70
years of age, who has followed the sea for more than half a century, and
who for more than forty years has sailed as a master of a vessel.
While cruising in the Caleb Cushing early in the eighties in the re
gion of Clipperton Island he discovered it. His attention was first at
tracted to it by the immense number of birds which he saw flyingabout
it. lie made a landing, investigat2d its character and saw that it con
tained immense deposits of guano. He raised the American flag over it
and took possession of it in the name of the .United States of America.
When he returned to San Francisco he reported his discovery to the State
Department under the provisions of the Federal statutes and claimed
the right to the deposits of guano.
Later he transferred his claims to the Island and the deposits to a
corporation which was formed for that purpose, the Oceanic Phosphate
Company, one c-f the defendants in this suit.
The suit is against the company and the six directors, and is to se
cure a rescission of the contract by which the stock was transferred from
Permien, and to secure what It is claimed are Permien's property rights
in the island.
The vexed question of what country has the right to exercise sover
eignty over the island has been investigated. The Secretary of State
has been communicated with. But, contrary to what has been reported,
the Secretary does not say that it belongs to France, but simply that ac
cording to some gazetteers and similar publications, the island was first
discovered by a navigator sailing under the French flag. It is not known,
however, that France has ever laid claim to the island, or ever performed
any acta c-f sovereignty concerning it.
It was never charted until after Captain Permien's discovery, and
never fully charted until within the past year, when the United States
Hydrographic Office accepted the very careful and complete chart made
by Paul Henning, who spent several months on the island in the em
ploy of the Oceanic Phosphate Company.

or obstinate, or when the strain on his wings became
painful. Naturally there can scarcely be an accurate
comparison between men and flies; but as far as possi

very careful observations and computations. Indeed, in
the fly experiment two matches tied together were lifted,

A Mexican man-of-war took the
i plucky fellow off the island the other
day, but he jumped overboard, swam
back, hoisted the American nag again
and to date has successfully main
tained his position on the island. Sev
eral nations claim the island. While
these big ones are battling over the
sovereignty of the place a number of
corporations and capitalists are disput
ing in the courts here the commercial
rights of it. For the island is rich in
gunno deposits.
Theodore Gussmann, the man who has
â  self marooned himself on Clipperton
i Island, is doing his level best to hold
it for the United States, and incident
ally for his employers, the Oceanic
Phosphate Company.
The other day a French man-of-war
touched at the island and brought
I away letters from Gussmann In which
I he detailed his novel situation. One of
them was to Captain Baettge, a friend
in this city. It was of a business na
ture and dealt with the best way to
i preserve certain rights in the island.
I Another letter was to a particular
J friend, in which the self-marooned man
j relates the awful lonesomeness of his
! position.
Some idea of this lonesomeness can
be obtained from the accompanying
pictures which are drawn from pho
tographs taken last year by Newland
i Baldwin of this city. It was then that
j Gussmann's story began.
At this time Gussmann was one of a
party sent to Clipperton Island by the
Oceanic Phosphate Company on the
steamer Navarro. The party remained
', on the island some weeks putting up
! buildings and collecting: guano and
then departed for San Francisco, leav
: ing Gussmann and two companions,
named Nelson and Smith, behind to
take care of the place. The title to
; the land and buildings was given into
! Gussmann's custody.
A few weeks after the departure of
1 the Navarro the Mexican cruiser Dem
! ocrata hove in sight and after great
! difficulty landed a party of marines,
! who pulled down the American flag
I flying at the time, hoisted the Mexican
! colors and took possession of the place.
Gussmann and his companions were
! invited on board the Mexican cruiser
; and told they must remain. Smith and
Nelson, yielding to the seductive in
fluences of certain beverages, readily
agreed to leave the island. In fact, it
is most likely they were tired of being
there. Gussmann, however, demanded
<to be put back on shore. This was re
â  fused, and he was ordered to give up
i the letter and other papers pertaining
to the ownership of the island.
Seeing that argument was useless
and that he would soon be seized by
the Mexicans, Gussmann Jumped over
board before anybody could reach him.
It was a most dangerous thing to do,
and the Mexican officers, thinking he
would surely drown, allowed him to
swim toward shore and he was soon
i lost to sight in the breakers.
But Gussmann did not drown. In-
I stead he made the swim of his life, bat
i tling for hours in the breakers and
! eventually landing on the beach in an
almost lifeless condition. He did not
attempt to stand up, for fear the Mext
! cans would see him through their
j glasses and send back for him. Instead
j he lay flat on the beach until darkness
came, when he mustered up strength
enough to crawl to his cabin. In the
morning the Mexican cruiser was gone
I and Gussmann was alone on the reef.
There is no more desolate spot on the
face of the waters than Clipperton
Island. Strictly speaking, it is a cir
cular coral reef, without any particular
outlet to the sea. There is, of course,
some seepage through the crevices of
the reef when the tide rises and falls,
but not enough to have any particular
effect on the waters in the lagoon
forming the center of the island. As a
i consequence they are dead and stag
i nant and half filled with guano. Dur
! ing the rainy part of the year, when
j the weather is stormy, the lagoon is
stirred up occasionally by the waves
These three men were left on Cllpperton Island by the Oceanic Phosphate Company. The captain of a
Mexican man-of-war tried to carry the trio away and lay claim to the island. Gussman jumped overboard and swam
ashore, hoisted the American flag and has remained in possession ever since.
The cocoanut palms are the only bits of vegetation on Clipperton Island. About half a dozen more were planted,
but they were devoured by the voracious crabs that overrun and destroy every green thing on the island; only Iron,
rocks and boards escape them. The pigs were saved from the wreck of the Kinkora.

washing over the reef, but during the
dry season the water and guano simply
cook.
On one side of the reef there is a flat
sand pit a few feet above the ocean.
On the opposite there is a jagged rock
that rises probably 50 feet. The build
ings of the phosphate company are on
the sand spit, and it is here that Guss
mann makes his home.
On this desolate reef there are only
two green things visible. They are
palm trees that have been coaxed into
existence by guano collectors. To save
them it was necessary to plant them in
boxes with sides about 18 inches high.
slipping: off.
First the fly tried to raise himself by flapping his
wings, but failed. Gradually cutting off the cotton till he
could raise himself it was found that the string was
about twelve times as long as the fly's body. Now take
a sailor of average height and strength, give him a
cable sixty feet long and as thick as his leg at the
thickest partâ could he lift such an immense coil, much
less soar through the air with it? Yet that proportion
ately is -what the fly did.
These experiments go to show power in moving areas;
other trials were made to show weight-lifting ability.
The match weighed four times as much as the Insect
did and the cotton half as much.
The earwig, one. of the beetle family, was chosen for
another series of tests. After harnessing the bug to a
piece of string a little dray was constructed of card
board, with the side folded down at right angles and two

Besides these two little palms there is
not even a spear of green on the island.
The enemy to vegetation on the reef
is the terrible voracious land crab. This
creature is very offensive in many
ways. It is little larger than the
crabs sold In the San Francisco mar
kets, but it has longer and stronger
claws and can travel over the land at
a lively rate. Nothing eatable escapes
its voracious maw if it once gets a
hold on It. It devours everything that
washes up on the reef except boards
and pebbles.
For companions Gussmann has the
myriads of sea birds that swarm over
the island and two pigs that were res
cued from the wrecked Kinkora.
In the letter to his friend Gussmann
makes an attempt to describe his feel
ings when he found himself alone on

Ed by the Mexican cruiser and event
ually made their way to America and
told their story to the world. But they
evidently thought Gussmann had been
drowned in attempting to swim ashore,
for they said nothing about him. He
was alone on the reef and remained so
until November 24 last, when a French
man-of-war touched at the island.
Gussmann now has a chance to leave,
and his three months of solitude had
taught him what he would have to pass
through in case he remained. But his
duty to his employers triumphed, and
he chose to stick to the island and
look after the property on the reef in
pieces of lead pencil, minus the leads, were pivoted by
means of wires. To this the bug was attached and the
tests of strength began. He dragged the cart easily af
ter a moment's curious investigation. Then matches
were piled upon it until there .were eight. Then the in
sect balked. These eight matches weighed twenty-four
times as much as the earwig and their combined length
was thirty-two times longer than his. For purposes of
comparison a horse may be utilized. It is more than
doubtful If an ordinary draft animal could carry as
much proportionally.
Then an English penny was dropped on the bug's
cart and he drew that, too. To figure how much this
meant, the experimenter ascertained that the penoy
weighed as much as eighty-three of the matches. As
a match was four times longer than an earwig it was
necessary for purposes o$ comparison with horse-power
to divide the timber into lengths equal to that of a horse,
preference to breaking his agreement
and going home. Instead he wrote a
letter asking to be released from his
contract and rescued. It is very like
ly that this will be done, as Captain
Baettge is making efforts to get a
schooner and go down after him.
In the meantime Gussmann is alone
on the reef, hoping and praying for re
lease. Some idea of what, he has to
pass through can je gained from the
letter to his friend. This is written in
German and is quite long. Whatever
it may be in the way of chirography,
it is certainly a most graphic descrip
tion of the lonesome days he passes
on the reef. Such ordeals have driven
many men insane, and it is hoped that
Gussmann will live until help comes.
"Days are all alike to me," he writes
in one place. "I don't know Sunday
from Monday, and sometimes think
it is all a dream that I will wake out
of very soon."
Gussmann then goes on to describe
the way he lives. He says that he
| wakes about daylight every morning
i and always thinks it is the morning
| before. The first thing he does is to go
I out and look for any signs of a sail
ior a column of smoke. He always
keeps a pile of dried wood handy so
that he can light it at a moment's no
tice for a signal. For days he meets
disappointment. Then he struggles
1 with himself. All about him the
breakers roar and the sea birds

As a last experiment the earwig, suspended, held In
two of his feet a strip of paper twenty times longer than

The rope necessary to bind together a dozen men

pieces of paper than the one referred to in this experi

the earwig voluntarily seizing the ribbon of paper and
holding it tenaciously.

London Underground Railway.
In designing the new London under*
ground railroad, the engineers have hit
upon a new scheme v.-hich may be adopt
ed hereafter on surface roads. There are
no grades in the tunnel, but at various
points the roadbed itself has been In
clined, so that it can be used as a brake
or as a speed accelerator for trains. On
each side of each station is a 3 per cent
gradient, rising on the approaching side
and falling again to the level of the road
on the departing side. This unique method
gives a retarding effect to all trains ap
proaching the stations equivalent to the
application of considerable additional
braking power, while materially aiding
in the acceleration of all trains as they
leave the platform. Furthermore, the
saving in power necessary to secure the
requisite rapid acceleration is by the
adoption of this plan calculated to
amount to about 33 per cent. This Is a
point in modern railway practice which
might well be adopted by surface roads.
The new London underground follows
the line of greatest traffic: in the city. It
runs from Liverpool street due west, un- â 
der Holborn, High Holborn, Oxford
street and past Hyde Park as far as
Shepherds Bush.
The road will receive passengers from
the great underground central depot, now
in course of construction by the Central
London Railway Company, between the
Bank of England and the Royal Ex
change, brought In by the main lines of
the London and Northwestern, Midland
and 'London and Southwestern railroads.
It is especially at this point in the city
that crossing streets is a perilous task,
and the railroad company is now engaged
in constructing a series of subways im
mediately below the surface for the con
venience cf pedestrians and as approaches
to its own station below. From this cen
tra! depot will radiate not less than five
underground tunnels, some eighty-five
feet below the surface, each feeding a
separate and equally populous district of
the great agglomeration known as Lon
don.
Thje Movements of Tall Towers.
It is announced that the Eiffel tower
has been vibrating to such an extent that
many of the excitable Parisian public
have become alarmed lest it come about
their ears. Colonel Bassot has found that
the expansion and contraction of the iron
in the tower causes it to describe a tor
sion movement between sunrise and sun
set, which traverses a curve of four
inches. A backward movement equally as
great occurs during the night. But in
spite of this movement, the tower could
not fall. It is quite as rigid as though
constructed of a solid piece of steel, and,
if anything, more so. Our own Wash
ington monument moves backward and
forward several inches every day, yet
nothing short of a convulsion of nature
could displace it. The tall tower on the
Philadelphia City hall is also noted for its
capacity to lean to one side. The great
dome on the Capitol building in Washing
ton, D. C, moves quite a distance every
day, and in this connection a curious ex
periment was tried to show how far out of
plumb it usually goes. A thin wire was
hung from the inner topmost point of the
dome. On the lower end of the wire was
a plumb bob, in the lower point of which
was inserted a lead pencil. It Just touched
the floor of the rotunda, on which a large
sheet of white paper was laid. As the
dome moved it dragged the pencil with it,
and, consequently, left the tracing of its
course on the paper. An oval fully a foot
in length was marked out every day.

THE WORLD OF BOOKS.
A BASQUE IDYL.
RAMT'XTCHO- By Pierre Lot!. . New
York: R. F. Fenno & Co. Ban Fran
cisco: For sale at .the Emporium.
Dreamy poetry, exquisitely expressed
sympathy with nature, more especially
In her melancholy moods, an intuitive
ptlon of the heart's most elusive
sentiments, these are the special charac
teristics which Pierre Loti's name evokes,
and they are to be found in marked de
gree in his pathetic relation of a Basque
peasant's love. The story is of the
slightest, and as Is common with this
author, of the saddest. Ramuntcho, the
hero, inherits from his Basque mother
the splendid physique, the muscular
energy, the nomadic instincts, the poetic
; melancholy of a Ions; line of in
dependent ancestors devoted to smug
gling, to their time-honored games of the
tialid and the "rebot"; devoted also to
their picturesque land with its southern
luxuriance in the shadow of forbidding
mountains; yet with the restless blood of
the wanderer in their veins. From his
nameless, aristocratic father he inherits
the refinement, the vague longings, the
cynical weariness of life, characterizing
the blase French fashionable of these lat
ter days.
This father, in a moment of romantic
caprice, captivated a passionate Basque
girl, who willingly followed him to a
life of hidden love in the city, and baby
Ramuntcho was born in the purple.
"When his mother saw that her rich
lover's love was waning she did not await
desertion; proud, stern, self-reliant, she
returned with her babe to her native vil
lage, bought back her dead parents' little
farmhouse and there, hard-working, lone
ly, silent, brought up her son with a
stately dignity that at last found favor
with her simple, proud country folk and
won back her position.
But Ramuntcho was none the less a
boy, bearing his mother's, not his fath
er's, name; a lad distinguished as one of
the bravest smugglers and best, pelota
players on the countryside, but a bad
parti for a girl with a family name and
a dowry. And so the loves of the nero
and of Gradeuse, the golden-haired,
dreamy Basque beauty, are hopelessly
crossed. True that the twain have af
fianced themselves almost from infancy,
according to the Basque custom; true
that Arrochkoa, Gracieuse's rich young
brother, favors the match: her mother,
Dolores, is bitter in opposition, and while
Ramuntcho is serving his three years as
a French soldier, lovely Gracieuse, always
mystically inclined, is spirited away to
a convent for life. The most touching
scene, powerful in its pathos, is the last,
when Ramuntcho and Arrochkoa visit
the sequestered convent intending to kid
nap the young nun; impressed by the
spirit of still resignation, the traditions
of holiness and self-sacrifice, the atmos
phere of transcendental purity that en
velops them, their hearts quail at the
thought of sacrilege, and the hero, moth
erless and wifeless, is left to wander away
alone to American shores.
A sorrowful idyl, hut an idyl in every
sense of the word. Pierre Lot! has never
been happier than in his descriptions of
the Basque scenery, the Basque charac
ter, the Basque daily life. Smuggling
becomes less a matter of adventure than
of poetry as we creep with the smugglers
CONDUCTORS AS
MODERN BAYARDS.
WE are living in an age of discovery,
and the most recent memorable
exploit of our explorers has been
the bringing to light of the Boston
street-car conductor. Those of us who
remember this worthy of old may not
have known him as a rara avis, but
quite a remarkable number of news
paper articles have recently appeared
about him, and the stret-car conductor
of Boston has been drawn from com
parative obscurity and set upon the
pedestal which his worth would seem
to merit.
He is the idol of the hour. One en
thusiast, writing recently in an East
ern journal, declared that not her cult
ure, but her street-car conductors con
stitute Boston's chief glory, while seve
ral of the New York papers and one
Chicago journal have held the uni
formed factotum up for local admira
tion. Even The Outlook has a good
word for him, and a corresponding
note of disapprobation for his unworthy
compeers in less fortunate cities. To a
man or to a woman â for I suspect
most of these writers are of the petti
coated sex, these personally conducted
ones from Boston hold up the conduc
tors as a model for emulation in the
"Far West." We are told that the
Athenian conductors speak in low, re
fined accents, unlike the rude bawl of
the Westerner. According to authority
they open and shut the umbrellas of
lady passengers, help the children on
and off the platforms, and do not poke
passengers in the back to urge upon
them the impossible duty of "stepping
up forward" in a crowded car. They
answer all questions, and never grow
weary in well doing.
The list of their virtues prolongs it
self beyond space here to recount it.
The difference between them and our
Western men is insisted upon, relent
lessly, and to read these curious ar
at dead of right, through spectral woods,
over mysterious mountains, or along si
lent river; the playing of the pelota, the
dancing of the fandango, the gatherings
In church, are described for us with all
the loving fidelity of a native poet, the
visions of Basque scenery make one un
derstand the Basque nostalgia. And the
exquisitely delicate love-making of the
two childrenâ the hero is only 15 when tho
romance opens â is redolent of purity. Se
lection becomes well nigh impossible, but
here is a scenic description taken at ran
dom:
"The land of thick branches which they
traverse, under the oppression of very
high mountains, which they do not see,
Is all in ravines, profound and torn up,
in precipices, where torrents roar under
the green night of the foliage. The oaks,
the beeches, the chestnut trees become
more and more enormous, living through
centuries off a sap ever fresh and mag
nificent. A powerful verdure is strewn
ever that disturbed geology; for ages it
covers and classifies it under the fresh
ness of its immovable mantle. And the
nebulous sky, almost obscure, which is
familiar to the Basque country, adds to
the impression which they have of a sort
of universal, meditation wherein the
tilings are plunged; a strange penumbra
descends from everywhere, descends from
trees at first, descends from the thick,
pray veils above the branches, descends
from the great Pyrenees hidden behind
the clouds."
As will be seen, Pierre T,oti's charm
owea little to his translator. M. Henri
Pene dv Bois has undertaken a task for
which his command of English does n>->t
qualify him. Translation, more especial
ly in the case of a singularly idiomatic
writer, does not merely mean an exact
rendering of expressions in another
tongue, and it often requires all the au
thor's innate eloquence to make us for
get the crudities of his translator.
LOVE LORD OF ALL.
AND FRIENDS-By
Maxwell Grey. New York: D. Apple
ton & Co. Fore sale at Doxey's.
This is not the dramatic, psychological
sort of work we look for from the author
of "The Silence of Dean Maitland." In
"Sweethearts and Friends" Maxwell Grey
gives us a sketchy story illustrating the
hopes, fears and trials of the latter
day young -woman whose ambitions are
not limited to social gayeties and matri
monial success. The heroine is a very
charming girl who, in defiance of family
prejudice, cuts out a medical career for
herself, closing the door of her heart
against little Love in the belief that his
advent would imperil her mental salva
tion. But Love wins the day, as he has
done from time immemorial, and sweet
Dr. Amy marries the "friend" who has al
ways been her sweetheart, albeit he went
astray for a time under tutelage of a flip
pant fairy whose shallowness seemed to
him more womanly than Amy's independ
ence. This gentleman, alternately dubbed
The Immaculate and Bayard, is a preux
chevalier rather out of joint with modern
prose, yet he learns to bt?nd to circum
stances and accepts meekly his wife's de
votion to her profession. The love of
these twain is literally tried by fire 'and
the scene in which Bayard rescues a child
and Dr. Amy rescues Bayard savors a
little too much of the melodramatic to be
tides is enough to make every woman
in the unfavored West wish that she
might go to Boston and place herself
under the protection of Boston's newly
discovered "glory."
Something of this sort I was think
ing the other day as I got aboard an
electric car at the outskirts of the city
1 h;ld ' traveled some distance before
takirg the, car, and my coat was cov
ered with an all-too-palpable powdter
,1 was dabbing ineffectively at my
sleeves, handkerchief in hand, when the
conductor, just a mere Western con
ductor, approached with a little brush.
"Let me brush you," he said, simply,
and leading me to the door he very
deftly and gently removed every par
ticle of dust from my back and shoul
ders. Then, having other duties, he
handed me the brush and I finished the
process in comfc-rt. -
It is a peculiarity of the human
brain that dispraise makes a greater
impression upon It than does praise.
In one of his recent pleasant "Talks
(>:i Writing English" Arlo Bates told
an amusing instance of this. He said
t<> his audience: "If I were to say to
you that 'The Heavenly Twins' is mor
bid and unhealthy rubbish; that
'Trilby' is a pleasant transient ex
citement; but that 'The Return of the
Native' seems to me the most notable
English novel since Thackeray, you
would have no difficulty in remember
ing that I condemned 'The Heavenly
Twins.' You would have a fairly clear
idea that I had been less enthusiastic
than the general public about 'Trilby,'
and you would perhaps vaguely recall
that there was something else â really
it is astonishing how quickly a name
slips from the memoryâ which i
praised."
As the audience left the hall one lady
said to another, a stranger, "I beg
jrotur pardon, but could you tell me the
name of the third book that was given,
the one the lecturer said we should for
get?"

THE AMERICAN COOK
TTVEIA T E LESSONS IN SCIENTIFIC
COOKERYâ By Miss Susy Tracy. San
Francisco: H. S. Crocker Company.
Miss Tracy probably knows why she
prefaced her lessons with the adjective
"scientific." As a matter of fact, they
are addressed to students who have not
yet mastered the A B C of the culinary
art, and their merit lies in their direct
simplicity. The veriest tyro could hardly
spoil a meal when following Miss Tracy's
directions, but the more ambitious cor
don bleu must go further afield for in
struction. Had Miss Tracy professed to
teach only American home cooking, she
would have saved her artistic reputation;
as it is, certain of her recipes irresistibly
recall poor Dv Maurier's definition of
roast chicken, "such a different thing
from poulet roti." In like manner is our
authoress's bouillon a different thing
from the French article, being nothing
else but ordinary English beef-tea. Her
directions to steep "French frifcd pota
toes" fn cold water would make the hair
of the humblest French cook stand
straight on end, while her views on the
subject of boiled fish are an insult to
piscine aristocracy; no self-respecting fish
condescends to boil tastefully in plain,
unadulterated water. In the matter of
broiling, too, Miss Tracy might study
with advantage the preliminary use of
marinades or sauces. But to the unso
phisticated American family cook her
handbook will probably prove helpful.

Alic Lee Moquo. Xpw York: Q. W.
Dlllingham Company. San Francisco,

A blood-and-thunder novel this, in the
good old blood-curdling style; a lale of
cruelty, murder and sudden death to sat
isfy the most insatiable reader of the
sensational. Mrs. Moque takes us to
Pennsylvania, under the reign of terror
of the "Mollie .Maguires," and gives us
GROUP OF FIGURES ON A MONUMENT LATELY ERECTED TO DUMAS IN PARIS.
And so, amid all this queer pean to |
the Boston street-car conductor, the j
accented note, after all, is not so much >,
the praise of him as the corresponding !
i disparagement o-f his Western brother. |
I am glad some conductors, somewhere,
; are getting a little praise, for their po- j
, aition is at best a thankless sort of ;
; one, and I confess that for my own |
I part I have been prone to forget the j

Some time ago I had occasion to go
to a part of the city with which I was
; quite unfamiliar. Seeing, a block or |
more away, a large building in course
'of construction, I asked a conductor
; what it was to be. He told me, and
when, a few seconds later we passed
another half-completed structure, he
i volunteered the information that it was
a new orphanage, and during the rest
of the trip he called my attenetion to
several features of the district that
were unknown to me. All this with no
an exceedingly vivid insight into the
Joys that befell survivors who intruded
upon regions where there was opposition
to surveying in general and railroading
in particular. The story is not a pleas
ant one: the scenesâ more especially the
domestic scenesâ in the saloon of Potts
town which was the Magulre rendez
vous, are repulsive in the extreme, yet
their air of reality suggests that the au
thoress has based her little romance on
hard historical facts. A v-Jn of poetry
is supplied by the loves or Toola. the
rustic beauty, whose only dissipation is

the "Bodymaster," or chief of the infa
mous Maguire brotherhood; and the life

inclined son, gives opportunity for some
very pertinent theories on heredity. Mrs.
Moque is not yet a mistress of style, but
her conceptions of character are powerful
and with her capacity for stirring plot
we may look for some fine work from her
pen in the future.
THE CENTURY.
H. PhelDs Whitmarsh writes in the
Century for February of "The Steerage
of To-Day," his article being illustrated
by Andre Castaigne. Mr. Whitmarsh
draws this picture of one of his compan
ions in the voyage that he made:
Kneeling in an upper bunk near mo, a
middle-aged Irishman was hanging a pot
containing a shamrock plant. I entered
into conversation with him, and learned
that he was going to join his son in Cali
fornia, to whom he was taking the sham
rock as a present.
"I hope it will live," he said, looking
wistfully at the pot as it swung from the
beam. " 'Twas the wan thing the bhoy
wanted. 'IVave iv'ryting," says he in his
letther, 'an' come over. I have enough
for the both of us now,' says he; 'an' I
can make you comfortable for the rest ay
your days. But,' says he, 'fetch me a
livln' root ay shamrock if ye can." "
All Sunday we were in smooth, water,
running under the lee of the Irish coast.
The day being fine and warm, the steer
age swarmed on deck in full force. Men,
women and children all crowded about
the after hatch, some playing cards, some
dancing and some already making love;
but for the most part they lay about the
deck, sleeping and basking in the sun.
In the afternoon my friend the Irishman
appeared with his shamrock. He wanted
to give it a "taste" of fresh air, he said.
At sight of it many of the Irish girls
shed tears; then, seating themselvesabout
tho old man, they sang plaintive Irish
melodies until the sun went down. The
sad faces of the homesick girls and the
old father sitting among them holding in
his lap the precious little bit of green
presented a Eight not easily to be for
gotten.
REVIEW OF REVIEWS.
In the series of articles dealing with the
Immediate problems which concern the
great powers of the world, now appearing
in the American Monthly Review of He
views, Mr. W. T. Stead writes for the
February number a paper on "British

candid piece of criticism, all the more in

The Pall Mall Magazine for February

Anthony Hope's sequel to the "Prisoner

On one of the park lines, recently, I
noticed a child of perhaps 2 years, In
charge, apparently, of her father. The
little one wore a baby-tormentor, in
the shape of a bonnet â¢with a mon
strous frill that fell down over her face,
completely hiding her eyes and render
ing her vision an impossibility. She
kept throwing her head back and peer
ing from under her shelter tent in the
endeavor to see something of
her surroundings. The conductor was
rather surly looking. I heard
him speak with quick decision to

CURRENT LITERATURE
A portrait of John Vance Cheney, re
produced from a drawing specially made
for the purpose, forms the frontispiece of
the February number of Current Litera
ture. This is by way of illustrating the
article on Mr. Cheney and his work,
which is provided by F. M. Hopkins as
his monthly contribution to the "Ameri
can Poets of To-day" series, so long an
interesting feature of this magazine.
Among other good things in this number
are an article on the late Alphonse Dau
det. an account of his life and work, as
well as a reproduction of his exquisite
littlesketch,"The Deathof the Dauphin";
spirited readings from Sienkiewicz's
laest novel, "Hania," and from Mrs.
Frances Hodgson Burnett's "His Grace
of Osmonde"; a compilation of clever
thrusts at the sterner sex entitled "Men
in Epigram"; and another, a verse com
pilation, "What the Old-time Poets Say
of Death." The editorials are keen and
clever.
THE ATLANTIC.
An article in the February Atlantic
which will attract wide attention to an
evil hitherto largely unknown and unsus
pected is that upon the relations of the
labor unions to the negro, contributed by
John Stephens Durham, late United
States Minister to Hayti. Mr. Durham
shows the grave injustice and injury done
to the whole colored race by the system of
exclusion practiced by the labor* organi
zations of the country. He does not con
sider that this was originally a conscious
crusade against color, but that it is part
of the general system of exclusion, like
the discrimination against women and the
limitation of apprenticeships. But in ef
fect, the color limit is drawn by them so
absolutely and so strictly that no man
suspected of the slightest tinge of color
Is permitted to join a trade union or to
work in company with a union man
throughout the United States. The result
of this sweeping exclusion is to shut out
the colored man, no matter how capable
or well trained, from all skilled employ
ment whatsoever, and to degrade him to
depend upon unskilled labor or menial
service entirely for his support.
THE ARENA.
J. M. Foster, a new contributor to the
Arena, presents an article on "Secret
Societies and the State," which will com
mand general attention and perhaps pro
voke controversy. A most valuable num
ber is the article by Mrs. J. B. Montgom
ery-McGovern on "An Important Phase of
Gutter Journalismâ Faking." The evil dis
cussed by the author is so crying and uni
versal that her protest will call forth a
hearty response.
LADIES' HOME JOURNAL
A writer in the February Ladies' Home
Journal tells and pictures how to over
come the difficulties of securing good
photographs of young children. He has
evidently given much study to the matter,
and seeks to instruct the parents rather
than the photographic artist. The key
note of his teaching is to avoid putting the
children in strained, unnatural positions,
but to let them assume natural poses.
The best way to dress the children and to
fix their hair Is also told, making the
article exceedingly valuable.
FRANK LESLIE'S.
The gold regions of the Klondike are
described and pictured elaborately in
Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly for Feb
ruary. The article is written by Henry
Clay Colver of Seattle, who giv^s an in
teresting account of the first discoveries
and of the recent expeditions, and >.ells
insisting upon his right to do as he
pleased. The Conductor had not looked
amiable, but presently he came into the
car, bent over the baby and very gont
ly folded back the big ruffle, smoothing
it down so as to give the child unhin
dered vision. 'There," he said to the
father, "now she can see out." The lat
ter was not offended. He smiled, and
when the frill fell down some time
after he turned It back again. But I
do not believe that even a Boston con
ductor ever showed a manlier bit of
consideration for the comfort of a little
child.
I do not think that it could be suc
cessfully maintained that her street
car conductors are San Francisoco's
chief glory. The city has one or two
other features to which her people may
point with pride, but for just mere
men, the majority of whom do not
"speak with a cultured, accent." most
of our knights of the bell-punch do
very well indeed. Now and then one
encounters an unamiable one among
them, but as a rule they are honest,
kindly men, who make up in patience
and willingness to serve what they
lack In culture and opportunity.

LITERARY NOTES.
TVe have received from R. H. Russell,
publisher. New York, copy of a volume
of cartoons by Homer C. Davenport just
issued by him. The book is artistically
printed and bound and contains an in
troduction written by John J. Ingalls. It
is sold in two editions â the popular, price
$1 75, and the library, price $2 25.
Mark Twain's "More Tramps Abroad"
("Following the Equator") has already
sold over 10,000 copies in England. Mr.
Clemens has just sent to London for a
quantity of the "copy" paper which he
is in the habit of using. It is quarto size
and rather thin. Like most authors in
these days he has his manuscript type
written before sending It to the printer.
Perhaps he appreciates the value of his
autograph to the collector and wants to
keep it for his heirs.

CALIFORNIA AND
MANIFEST DESTINY.
AN early decree of "Manifest Des
tiny" was that the great West
should some time become a part
of the empire of the United States.
With American history there be
gan a mighty expansion of the Anglo-
Saxon race, which was destined to con
tinue till the farthermost Occident
should be reached.
Benjamin Franklin In 1754 prophesied
that in less than a century the vast
trans-Alleghany country must become
"a populous and powerful dominion."
Washington caught a true vision of the
West, and his sagacity and knowledge
of remote regions served him well in
public and private life. Wolfe's vic
tory at Quebec was a door opening to
the Anglo-Saxons an infinitely vast re
gion.
Napoleon "lightly offered the province
which had come to him so cheaply,"
and all Louisiana was acquired. By tne
treaty of 1819 Florida was ceded to the
United States. Notwithstanding Span
ish possessions and the claims or covet
ous desires of England, France and
Russia, "Manifest Destiny" had decreed
that the great California territory
should belong to the United States.
We are indebted to the question of
slavery extension for the accession of
California; slavery extension owes its
downfall to the admission of California.
It has become an admitted principle
in American politics that free States
could come into the Union only when
accompanied by slave States. After
the admission of Texas, when there
were fifteen slave and fifteen free
States, a vital question was that of
the disposition of California. "Mani
fest Destiny" answered the question
and forever turned the tide against
human slavery. Neither the climate,
nor the soil, nor the production of any
portion of California was adapted to
'shave. 6s: ciose shave, 7s fid; hair cut,
13s; hair cut, London style. 16s'; 'Four
men wanted at La Due's sawmills. Noth
ing to do but work. Pay Â£3 a day and
three drinks.' 'Mule cutlet, 4s 2d'; 'dog,
tenderloin, 10s 3d.' The Times has a
poetical department, humorous Illustra
tions and a thrilling account of an as
sassination In a saloon over cheating at
cards."
More than six months ago David
Christie Murray went out Into tho desert
places of North Wales to devote him
self to a work of fiction, animated by a
serious purpose, which has long lain at
the back of his mind. This book is to be
called 'Despair's Last Journey," and will
represent the writer's own view of the
facts of life; it will probably ba finished
In time for publication in the spring.
Mr. Murray has also recently seen
througrh the press a volume of tales and
poems shortly to be Issued by Messrs.
Uhatto & Windus of London. This will
be the first collection of Mr. Murray's
verse which has appeared.
"Book News," which publishes in each
issue an expression of opinion from lead
ing authors in regard to their own per
sonal view of their work, gives in its Feb- i
ruary number the following remarkable \
utterance by Sarah Grand in regard to
her purpose in writing "The Beth Book,"
in which, as will be seen, she touches up
on the errors of the critics:
"In influencing their daughter's choice
of a husband parents are apt to consider
a man's means, manners and position
rather than his principles or ideals. If ha
prove to be a good fellow in society they
are content to inquire no further. Many
men of excellent manners in public are
men of most corrupt mind, whose con
versation In private is a continual source
of suffering to their wives. I wrote 'Tha
Beth Book' to show what a retined wo
man must suffer when forced to associate
with such a man, the inevitable blight,
the certain deterioration that settles
upon her even when she has the force of
character to escape absolute corruption.
The critics have almost all missed this,
the one purpose of the book, and pounced
upon something quite incidental, and
merely introduced by way of illustration,
and as the vivisective incident, to which
they attribute an exaggerated impor
tance. The subjects discussed came in
evitably into the life of an intelligent wo
man situated as Beth was at the time of
which I was writing; she could not have
avoided them, and, therefore, no picture
of her would be faithful that ignored
them; but it is in the conditions of her
life, not In her Intellectual pursuits or
opinions, that the real significance of her
story is to be found."
slave labor, and slavery had not ex
isted in Mexico since 1829.
Although there were early indica
tions of gold, a favoring Providence
concealed the illimitable stores of
wealth until after the American con
quest and after hope of slavery exten
sion had faded. The fortunate acci
dent of Marshall gave to America the
gc-lden wealth of California. And now
for fifty years California has been a
most influential factor in the world's
development. In the dark hours of
civil strife it was our gold that sup
plied an indispensable element of
strength and steadiness to our Federal
finance.
The "Manifest Destiny" of California,
so far as it relates to past days, is not
merely a trumped-up expression of to
day for retrospective use. Numerous
prophetic utterances of the pioneer
press and observant travelers afford an
instructive commentary on subsequent
history. Read in the Californian and
the Star, beginning with 1846, and in
contemporaneous speeches such expres
sions as these: "The destiny of Cali
fornia is fixed â she is to become a free
and independent State. She is to mako
her own laws, manage her own re
sources, and found those institutions
in which her children are to find a hap
py home." "This (English) is to be the
language of California. The vast tide
of immigration from the United States
will inevitably make it so. It becomes,
therefore, every parent to have his
children taught this language." "Who
can now doubt the importance to which
California is destined?" "Our com
mercial capital, San Francisco, is des
tined to be the center of the exchange^
of the world, and is destined to suppi^
the world with a large share of its cur
rency."
"Manifest Destiny" is calling to-day
for native sons and native daughters of
moral fiber and excellent virtues.

as a designer for the lithographic
trade," said H. J. Breuer, "but when I
had saved a few hundred dollars I
would retire with It, study and paint
! landscapes, and end by pawning the
frames, before going back to toil. In
ISBS I rented a studio on the corner of
Fourteenth street and Broadway, New
York. I had gone through the usual
phases; my best clothes in hock; my
watch 'spouted' at the Bowery and the
ticket held by the proprietor of a cheap
restaurant as security for a seven-meal
: coupon ticket. I tried for work, but
luck was against me. I had got down
to toasting a little bacon over the gas
jet and a five cent loaf. It was winter,
dull, shivering and silent, save the oc
casional visit of a friend, from whom
I always tried to hide; but, if he suc
ceeded in getting in on me unawares
I entertained him with cheerful lies
until he had gone and thon kicked my
self for a fool because 1 did not ask
him for a dollar.
"Well, at about that time my finances
were at their lowest ebb. I heard the
landlord at the door, blustering, swear
ing and saying, 'What do you mean?
Two months due to-morrow.' With an
emphatic shove at my shoulder I gave
that landlord one biff, so. He grabbed
me and as I had had no breakfast that
day I fell down and he sat on me like
anundlgested doughnut.
"When I got up I had only two but
tons left that would hold. I was busy
painting my eye back to Its normal
color when I heard another knock at
: the door. I grabbed the poker this
time; the door opened and a gentleman
whom I had known in better days en
tered the room. I raked at the stove
and closed the damper, knowing that
the stove was cold.

comer. 'Are you very busy?' 'Very!'
said I. 'Sorry,' he said. "I want you to

" 'Well,' said I, 'pony down your $100
and I will see what I can do for you,'
and will you believe it, he did. I paid
the landlord, but I haven't licked him
yet.
"But what Is life without sweet
hope?"
"I cannot say that I have had such
a very hard time during my artistic
career," said L. P. Latimer, "for I have
been rather fortunate. There have been
times when it has been hard to make
both ends meet, but I have always
managed at the last moment to sell a
picture. The greatest trial I ever had
was when my health failed and I had
to go into the country, with strict or
ders from my physician not to touch my
brush for three years. The anxiety
was something terrible; I felt like a
caged bird, and that was the greatest
struggle that I ever endured for art's
sake."
"It is amazing," said J. TV. Clawson,
"how much real wretchedness can be
transformed just by an unexpected
order for a picture. I had a studio in
New York at the time of our greatest
skirmish for food, and my wife and I
were feeling the lack of rations and
rent, while the day for our monthly re
mittance had not yet arrived. We were
rather blue, and the playful chatter of
our two-year-old babe reminded us of
our responsibilities. Just then Mr. Sar
toris, General Grant's son-in-law, called
and said: 'Clawson, old boy, I am going
to sail for England to-morrow and
would like to take a pastel portrait of
a friend to my father. Can you do it
by noon to-morrow?'
"Though a big effort, I announced
with celerity: 'Yes, if your friend will
pose immediately.' The portrait was a
success, and finished when Mr. Sartoris
called the next day. He handed me five
new crisp ten-dollar bills. Wife and I
bo%ved our benefactor out and when the
door closed fell into each other's arms,
while the baby grabbed the bills and,
before we discovered it, had torn one
Into fragments, the largest of which
was a quarter of an inch square. It re
quired more time to mend and pass that
greenback than it did to make three
' pictures."
J. D. Strong associates the great
est hardships in his artistic career with
the year 1874. "At that time I was
studying in Munich," said Mr. Strong,
"and waiting anxiously for my long
overdue remittance. I was in pretty
hard casings, I tell you, and finally
took the advice of some students, who
conducted me to a one-cent souphouse.
This place was kept open for the very
poor. There were no waiters here â
each fellow must help himself to the
soup plates and ladles on the shelves,
and wash and return the dishes when
he had finished his meal. This meal
consisted of a scoop from two great
caldrons of soup, or a sort of pot
pourri. I never could make out a suit
able name for the ingredients unless it
could be called anti-fat.
"Well, for a price equivalent to one
cent, a piece of black bread and the
privilege of fishing in these caldrons
for whatever I could take out at one
scoop was given me. At one time I got
a chop bone and a chicken leg. This
was not. very fattening, but I was a
faithful customer there for a week."
"When I was thirteen years of age."
Mr. Jorgensen began, "I commenced
my first struggle in labor for art by
shortening my sleep. I could be found
by 4 o'clock every morning scrubbing
the floors of the old Art School at 430,
Pine street. By doing this and run-
Ding errands, I was enabled to clothe
myself and help my mother. Sometimes
during the janitor's absence all of his
duties devolved upon me, but this was
my first struggle and not the worst one.
From 1881 to 1883 I was an assistant di
rector in the Art School, when Mr.
Williams advised me to branch out for
myself and take a studio. I started out
on a still hunt and found one on Cali
fornia street that just suited me. But
to my astonishment I was asked to pay
the rent of $20 in advance. I had
scarcely a dollar in my pocket and I
lay awake half the night scheming to
get that sum. When morning came I
gained enough courage to ask the loan
of a friend. I got the twenty and pro
ceeded to arrange my studio while my
bosom swelled with joy at the thought
that I was actually in business for my
self. It did not take me long to get
things in order, for my supply of fur
niture was meager. But my stock of
hope was at high tide. Then I sat down
to wait for pupils and orders. Seven
days passed and not a figure darkened
my doors.
THE B&K FRANCISCO CALL, STJXDAY, FEBBXTARY 13, 1898.
"Where were my brilliant dreams? I
felt that I was going mad. I sat down
"WORK." SAID WM. KEITH, "IF YOU'RE HUNGRY, WORK- IF YOU'RE
IN LOVE, WORK- WHAT'S THE USE OF CRYING OVER YOUR
TROUBLES? WORK! WORK! WORK!"
at my easel, but I could not paint. I
was blind to color save one, and that
the golden twenty loaned me by my
friend. It seemed to dance all over the
canvas, until I had to quit work. Sev
eral more days passed, and In all of my
life I can truthfully say that these
were the most wretched days. Not an
order; not a pupil. The fifteenth finally
dawned, and early in the morning I
was startled by a rap at the door. I
yelled 'come In' rather unceremonious
ly. A stranger answered my summons.
I studied that man as closely as if he
had been some diatai.t opecies of cre
ation, for he was the first visitor in the
fortnight. He left me an order for two
pictures that secured the rent, not only
for one month but for three."
"The most wretched time In my ca
reer," asserts H. S. Fonda, "1 spent
in Paris in 1893. I could not speak a
word of French and just happened to
stop at a hotel where there were no
Americans. Upon the second day of
my arrival I missed my bank drafts
that I had been wearing In a little bag
suspended from my neck. Oh, that
hour of torment was bitter! I had
saved my earnings of years for this one
purpose â to study in the art schools of
Paris, and now nothing remained. Be
sides, I had very little in my purse and
as the hotel did not furnish meals I
did not eat that day. Of course I no
tified the bank and hunted up the
American Club at the Hotel de la
Haute Loire, where I found bonhomme
and consomme and, to my unspeakable
delight, I also found my drafts where
they had been lost in the recesses of
my own pockets."
"In 1889." said Artist John Stanton,
"I left Paris and went up to Rochefort
en terre to sketch. One day I was busi
ly engaged in sketching the fortifica
tions, not knowing there was a law
against it, and was arrested by a ser
geant, who took me for a German spy.
I made matters worse by being sullen
and was locked up in the conciergerie
for two days and a night and fed on
onion soup.
"As soon as I was released from here,
my funds being low, I set out for Rye,
England, where I expected to find my
allowance waiting for me. I was dls-
appointed, and in my desperation took
the first room I could find where I
could get credit. It was somewhat
topsy-turvy, but the woman explained
that her Aunt Martha had just died
and that she would have it in order by
night. For three days I occupied the
room without noticing anything un
usual. But on the fourth, thinking
that I was opening the door to the
porch, by mistake I opened the one on
the opposite side of the room, and for
a moment I stood rooted to the spot.
For there lay the fast mortifying body
of a corpse.
"I went down those stairs three
steps at a time and demanded of the
landlady to do something with the
'deader.'
" 'Oh, that is only poor Aunt Mar
tha,' the woman explained. 'She died
with a little wind around her 'cart,
and the doctor said it would be no
'arm to keep the good soul for a few
days. We are going to bury her over
the little 'ill to-morrow.'
"The worst part of the whole thing
was that, knowing what was in the
next room, I had still to occupy mine
from sheer necessity until the remit
tance arrived, and that was the most
wretched night in my whole exist
ence."
"The worst trials of my life," said
Thomas Hill, "I endured while paint
ing that picture of 'The Last Spike.'
Owing to the many commissions, show
ered upon me by Mr. Stanford, my
generous patron, I made very slow
progress with the picture, covering a
period of four years. From time to
time I changed the figures at Mr.
Stanford's suggestions, and one day he
met me on the street and in the friend
liest manner said that he must counter
mand the order, as he feared the pub
lic would think him egotistical if he
had anything to do with the work. I
told him then that I released him
from all responsibility, but that It was
an historical event, and that if the
picture were truthful I should have no
trouble in finding a purchaser. He
told me, however, that when I had
completed the picture I had bet
ter let him see It first, and the expres
sion on his face as he said it told vol
umes to encourage me.
"If there was any folly in it it was
all mine, but I worked with more zeal
than ever before. Foremost amonn
the stubborn facts that stared mp in
the face was the mortgage on my
home, besides my wife and nine chiiu
ren had to have bread and butter. My
four years of toil, with its hopes and
discouragements, left me worn out in
body and mind. The mortgage on my
home was foreclosed, but Charles
Crocker came to my rescue and fur
nished me with the means to get out
of the country, to forget the spike
picture and its attendant miseries. But
I never can."
"Once upon a time." related C. D.
Robinson, "a minister tried to reform
a drunken Indian by offering him a
bribe to keep sober. 'Now, Joe,' said
he, 'if you can keep sober for one year
I will give you $5 at the end of that
time.' The intoxicated Indian quickly
pledged himself. The minister saw
him no more for six months, when he
found him on a glorious jag. 'Why,
Joe,' the good man exclaimed, 'you are
drunk again.' 'Oh, no,' the Indian in
sisted; 'this is the same old drunk!' "
Artist William Keith said: "Oh, yes,
I have had hardships; but, man alive,
who hasn't? I was a wood-carver and
stuck to my trade until I had saved a
little money, and then I began to
paint; but. pshaw! when I didn't sell
my pictures did I sit down and whine
like a woman? No, I just worked and
worked at another. If I had quit paint-
Ing whenever I received a disappoint
ment or failed to sell a picture, darn it
all, I would have been a physical wreck
long ago. Everybody has disappoint
ments. But if you are in' trouble,
work; if you are hungry, work, and if
you are in love be sure and work; it is
the best thing you can do."
"To tell the truth." said Amadee
Joullin, "my whole life has beep â 
struggle from the time I succeeded in
Retting myself fired from a printing
office, where my father had placed me
that I might outgrow the notion of
studying art, down to my meager exis
tence while studying in Paris in 1883.
I think there were very few students
who lived on as small an allowance as
I did. Invariably as the end of the
month came around I had to liv.c on
horse meat. I did my own cooking and
soon got to relish a horse steak pretty
well.
"But pshaw! the greatest hardships
of life are those we endure at home
among our own friends. I remember
one time when rooming with Jules Ta
vernier that I had a rather hard rub.
He suggested that we go out into the
country to sketch, and I had scraped
all the money I could together and met
him at the ferry. 'Let me have your
money, Joullin,' he said. 'I haven't any
just now, but I've got some coming.'
He was always like thatâ expecting
money, and when it did come he was
the most generous-hearted boy in the
world.
"Well, my money was soon spent, and
we waited for Jules' remittance to
square up our debts at the hotel. At
last it came, but by that time our
board bill had increased to such an
extent that we could only pay our fares
to Oakland. There we wereâ stranded
at the mole. While we were scheming
to get across the bay, a newsboy came
up, who, reading the name of Jules Ta
vernier on the valise said: 'Hello,
Jules.'
" 'Do you know me?' asked Jules
quickly. 'If you do, let me have four
bits and I'll give you this pocket-knife.'
"The bargain was made, but when we
reached the other side we had to walk
up to our studio carrying our traps,
and the worst part of it, to exist on free
lunches for nearly a week."

some manner there was a confusion of
signatures, and as I could not draw the
money until the matter was investigat
ed, I repaired to a cheap restaurant
whose price corresponded with my de
pleted purse. It would have been bet
ter for me had I gone hungry to bed, for
what I ate made me wretchedly ill â so
ill, in fact, that when I obtained my
money I had no appetite, and that, so
far, has been the most wretched day in
my experience."
G. ijadenasso, about two years
ago, had a hard run of luck. Sickness
came into his family, he had pawned all
of his jewelry and each day seemed
darker than the last. "It is true, I could
ping," said Mr. Cadenasso, "and often
spent 20 cents for laundered linen and
6 cents to the bootblack to make myself
presentable at some wealthy homes
where I sang without remuneration,
hoping that they would reciprocate by
buying a picture.
"One day I cannot forget. A society
lady stopped me on the street and said,
'Mr. Cadenasso, why don't you go to
Castle Crag? It's perfectly lovely up
there.' 'Madam,' I interrupted, 'I have
not 5 cents to go to the park.'
"Oh, there was such a tempest In my
aoul, and everywhere I looked the
clouds grew blacker; even the elements
sympathized with me and covered the
sky with clouds. Like an inspiration
the desire came to me to cross the bay
and sketch. I w r ent with a friend and
when I returned that night I brought
with me my finished picture 'The Gath
ering Storm.' I found a purchaser at
once and ended my worst struggle."
Speaking of his most tormenting ex
perience, H. R. Bloomer said: "I re
member 1878 as the year of years in
which the history ot my struggles
amounted almost to a climax. I occu
pied the studio in Paris formerly used
by Dv Maurier of 'Trilby' fame, and at
the same time was studying under Du
ran. One day Horace Hawes called
and took a fancy to a large unfinished
picture of Mount Shasta. He ordered
it to be finished and sent to his address
in San Francisco. By a stroke of ill
luck there was no certificate accom
panying the picture and it was kept in
the New York custom-house for six
months.
"On the strength of this sale I In
cured more debts than I otherwise
would have done, for I felt sure that
the money would be forthcoming as
soon as the pictures arrived in San
Francisco. I worked with zeal, and
along with the other students I sent
two pictures to the Universal Exposi
tion. Months passed by and no word
from San Francisco. I got deeper and
deeper in debt, and one morning â the
most miserable one I have ever known
âthe proprietor of the restaurant told
me he could give me no more credit.
I walked the streets of Paris all that
day without eating, trying to live
down my despair.
"Late that night I crept into my
bed in my studio and slept, from ex
haustion, until the next morning, when
I was aroused by one of the students,
Wyatt Eaton, who suggested that I
go to the exposition office and inquire
the fate of my pictures.. After a little
persuasion I went and â rt-as informed
that both had been sold, and that one,
'The Bridge at St. Gretz,' had been
bought by the French Government and
that I would get 1000 francs for it.
"I think I walked home on air."
When Otto Dobbertin, the sculptor,
arrived In San Francisco he brought
with him the remains of his overland
lunch and an empty purse. For three
days he lived on the debris of the one
and was spurred on in his search for
work by the flatness of the other.
There were days, so he says, that he
ate nothing at all. Then he walked
out to the park, and there met a Ger-.
man contractor, who gave him an or
der to make some figures for the
Santa Barbara building at the Mid
winter Fair. "He also gave me $1,"
said Mr. Dobbertin, "and that kept me
one week, until I had finished my fig-
An amusing account of VirglJ
Williams' adventure in Italy, showing
that artist's undaunted spirit, is related
by Mr. Jorgenson. Mr. Williams, who
was the first director of the San Fran
cisco Art School, spent nearly ten yean
in Italy. During that time he made
several sketching expeditions into the
interior of the peninsula, and on ona
of these he discovered that he lacked
the funds to buy even a third-class
passage on the steamboat which would
take him to his destination. His argu
ment to the ticket agent was of no
avail. The agent advised him to see
the captain, but he found him just at
firm. They would take no one on less
than a. third-class fare.
"Finally as Mr. Williams turned to
leave the boat, he saw some horses
aboard and said, 'Surely, captain, you
don't charge as much for shipping
those horses as you do for carrying thÂ«
passengers, do you?'
" 'Of course not,' the captain replied
" 'Then let me go as a horse; I will
stand in th re with them.'
" 'Who are you, anyway?' the cap
tain exclaimed, amazed at his persever
encp.
" 'I am an American artist,' Mr. Will

"Then the captain said, 'Whoever yon
are, you are all right; come along with

THE FATAL KLONDICITIS.
I'd a lover who was perfectâ
Or, I thought so at the time;
He would send me flowers and candy,
He would write me yards of rhyme;
He would visit, send me notes-
He would call me through the phone;
But he took the Klondicitis,
And I'm doomed to live alone.
I gave just fifteen hundred
To a man I thought all right,
lie was sure of "millions in it,"
And 'twould work "just out of sight."
"We had planned to make a splurge,
And were waiting for a scoop;
But he took the Klondicitis
And I think I'm "in the soup." . J {j
You may talk of rheumatism,
You may fear to get a chill, 'fl f]
You may dread the indigestion, 5
And the latest microbe ill;
You may run the entire gamut,
You may have the worst of luck;
But I think the Klondicltis
The most fatal thing we've struck.

HOW TO CALL A GERMAN POLICEMAN.
An amusing frontier incident is re
ported by the London Globe from the
village of Schoelbach, in the neighbor
hood of Metz.
A boy who was minding a flock of
sheep on a small island in the river
was caught in a violent storm, during

FORE MY EYES."
which the rain fell in torrents. ThÂ«
river rose rapidly and threatened to
cover the island.
The boy shouted for help, and his
cries were heard by two German po
licemen and several villagers, but no-nÂ«
of them would venture into the swollen
stream.
The boy had almost given himself uj
for lost, when he remembered hearing
some of his playmates say, "If you
want a policeman, shout, 'Vive la
France!' "
He immediately began to shout "Vivi
la France!" whereupon the two police,
men plunged into the river, seized tin
boy. dragged him across to the main
land and off to the police station, wher*
they charged him with uttering sedi
tious cries.

SOCIETY.
YET another week of dancing, mu
sic and brilliant entertainments
and the season of IS9T-98 will
have come to a close. The past
week has been crowded with
elaborate affairs, and this week
promises to be equally as gay.
Mr. and Mrs. W. F. Whlttler gave an
elaborate dinner, followed by a dance,
on Monday, at their elegant home, cor
ner of Jackson and Lapuna streets, in
honor of Mrs. Whittier's debutante
sister, Miss Gertie Carroll.
The affair was one of the most elegant
of the many elaborate private entertain
ments given this season. The magnificent
homo, which is so well adapted for the
entertainment of so large a party, was
magnificently decorated for the occasion.
Reception hall, drawing rooms, billiard
hall and dining room were placed at the
disposal of the dancers, and the vast ball
room was converted into a sumptuous
banquet, hall.
The guests were seated at seven round
tables, each of which boasted of an orig
inal and individual decoration. The first
table was aglow with bright red roses.
Snow blossoms were, used to beautify
table No. 2. The third table was decor
ated with nothing but delicate ferns. At
the fourth table the fragrant violet was
used with most artistic effect. For the
fifth table japonicas were used for dec
orative purposes. Daffodils made the
6ixth table beautiful, and the seventh ta
ble was prettily arrayed with delicate
pink fruit blossoms.
After the service of an elaborate menu,
dancing was inaugurated. The cotillon
was the feature of the evening. Edward
Greenway leading with Miss Carroll.
Four figures were danced. The favors
were extremely pretty. For the first
figure there was the Klondike favorâ a
tiny golden pick, from which, tied with
brilliantly shaded ribbon, three tiny nug
gets were suspended. A floral wand was
the favor for the second figure, and the
much admired doll favorâ tiny dolls in
cap and bellsâ for the third figure. For
the fourth figure dainty silver vinai
grettes and scarfpins were distributed.
Mr. and Mrs. Whittier received their
guests, assisted by Miss Carroll.
Mrs. Whittier wore an imported gown
of cream white satin, trimmed with point
lace. The only bit of relieving colors on
the gown was a spray of pale green
popples that were fastened to the cor-
t>age.
Miss Carroll -wore a dainty grown of
pink satin. The overdress was of cream
lace, the pattern of -which was traced
with a tiny frill of pink chiffon.

DEL MONTE, Feb. 12.â A large number
of Eastern people have arrived here this
week, having been driven to California
by the terrible blizzards and other forms
of climatic discomfort now so prevalent
east of the Rockies. Chicago is espe
cially well represented upon the week's
list of visitors, and those who come from
the Windy City are doubly appreciating
the mildness of a California spring. A
notable party of Chicagoans now here
consists of Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Miller
and Mr. and Mrs. S. W. Miller. Many
San Franciscans also are staying here
nnw, among them being L. Cohen and
Mrs. Cohen. Mr. and Mrs. Joseph D.
Grant came down from San Francisco
this week, remaining only a few days.
They were accompanied by Miss Lewis
of Portland, Or.
Mr. and Mrs. J. S. Carvalho of New
York City arrived "Wednesday to spend
! the remainder of the week. f
The pleasant weather of the past week
has made out of door amusement very i
: delightful, and driving has been especially
i indulged in. Wheeling is also coming
into favor again, and between 10 and 12
o'clock in the morning the grounds are
full of riders upon their noiseless steeds.
Now that the season for quail and duck
! shooting is almost over the sportsmen
here are all the more eager for the de
lights of gunning. Early starts and late
' returns, usually game-laden, charac
â  terize the days for these irrepressible en
! thusiasts.

It Bounded creepy and strange and
promised something of a novelty, so
we decided to go.
We were conducted to good side
seats half way up the aisle, and before
the president's gavel fell we Inspected
our surroundings. The hall was large,
handsomely furnished, and, as Mo
hammed said of Hades, almost full of
women. It had no windows other than
the colored glass of its monstrous
dome, through which filtered pale rays
of light and sunshine, giving to the
scene "a magic with witchery in it."
Mrs. Bramme whispered, adding that
"the creeps were giving a shadow
dance all up and down her spine."
Promptly at 2:30 o'clock Mrs. Bram
me and I were in the vestibule
leading to Beatific Hall. At the en
trance door we were welcomed by two
young girls, rather more plainly at
tired than the average woman usher,
and with nothing especially uncanny
about them that I could discern,
though I was vigilantly watching for
something of the sort.
There were mottoes upon the walls
bestowed upon Miss Florence Scatena
and Mr. Hurlburt.
Miss Scatena rendered several piano
solos and Miss Bertha Roth and Eugene
Roth contributed vocal duets. An ele
gant supper was served.
Besides the guests of honor there were
present the Misses Louise Naud, Anna

which revealed themselves by hun
dreds, as our eyes became accustomed
to the gloom, all of them suggestive of
blackboards, which were suspended
upon either side of thepresident's chair,
and were covered with strange dia
grams of human figures. While I was
trying to read the inscriptions, the
president arose, stood quietly a mo
ment, glancing with a half-smile over
the crowd of anxious faces before her,
and then, in a low, clear, carrying
voice, addressed the audience.
She welcomed the women to a par
ticipation in the mysteries of the new
era, "each soul to as much of the mys
tery as it can absorb; to all the light it
can now receive; each to all the good
which we know from our own experi
ence is within its grasp." She said she
knew that the visitors would be
amazed at what they would presently
see and hear.
Amputating an external member of
the physical body had long been prac
ticed by civilized peoples; but it had :
been reserved for up-to-date scientists
to invade the inner anatomy of the hu
man body, and, by removing organ af
ter organ, to re-create, in a sense, and
to cause the intellectual to be adapted ]
to new connection. Much more she i
said on the same line. Her leading
idÂ«a was that the excising scientist has i
demonstrated that it was possible to
live and to enjoy life without many of
the organs Â«t digestion, circulation and
nervous and muscular action.
Every umbilical and hypogastric or
gan may safely be removed, and, as
science moves, most of the organs in
the epigastric regions may also be i
taken out. Then there would be noth- '
ing left to trammel the spirit; nothing '
to give pain. But then there woufd
be such space and possibilities for hap- ;
piness as never have been conceived by
the minds of men.
"Do not for a moment imagine," said
the president, "that all this is the re- j
suit of the excising skill of the surgeon. I
When once proved that the stomach
could be removed and life not only go
on the same, but the mind thereby be
immeasurably strengthened â so that I
intense will could cause the successful
absorption of Btill another organ â it I
was at once seen that such action could
thus dissolve any organ; and earnest, ;
aye, inspired women by the score en- \
weddings
tered upon the trial."
Then some of the more advanced
members of the society were invited to
give their experiences.
Miss Williams, whose hair, eyes,
cheeks and hands were of ashy pale
ness, spoke with a voice that seemed
to come from a long distance. She said
that she had coveted a slim \Â»aist. She
had passed through the excision pro
cess for the sake of attaining a delight
ful slimness. Her stomach and some
other organs had been removed. The
result was that she had no waist â only
a diaphanous shred to connect the
aesophagus with the abdomen. She
had also, by the exercise of will, she
said, absorbed still other organs. Thi3
she would demonstrate later.
Then a lady who was introduced as
"Madam Ananias" gave an account of
her experience. Malice, melancholy
and envy, which had tormented her
from her youth, had left her upon the
excision of her gall and spleen and the
removal of certain gray matter from
her brain. Then, she said, her spiritual
eyes had been opened and she had be
gun to discern clearly the wisdom and
possibility of mental as well as sur
gical excision. She was no longer sub
ject to any hindrance in the higher
aspirations nor limited by any boun
daries seen by physical eyes. She said
she was willing to make ocular demon
stration of the truth of her statements.
A tall, animated blonde, of about
forty summers, with a face that spoke
resolution and activity, put this ques
tion to Mrs. Ananias:
"You Bpeak of having your g-all anrl
spleen removed, do you still retain your
stomach?"
"No, madam; it was removed eight
weeks ago.'
"And yet," said the interlocutor, "you
eat, have appetite, taste and sense of
smell?"
"Yes," replied Mrs. A. "I have a re
fined and elevated appetite, a sense of
taste and smell as much above former
life as attar of roses is above the odor
of decomposition."
A lady asked the chair if each of. the
members who would appear before the

audience had been subjected to the
same excision.
Madam President replied: "By no
means aro all alike in their present ex
alted conditions, and a little later this
inquiry will be answered in an en
tirely satisfactory way."
The next speaker was Dr. Fox, who
advanced the theory that the only ab
solutely essential organs in the human
body are those where thoughts are
born. All others are collateral, and
with higher development not only
nun-essential, but inconvenient. Ill
nature, anger and vindictiveness de
part as the excising knife â or, better
and higher yet, the subjugated will â
dispen.se with the organs whence
they spring, and those brainy sections
where tht-y are shaped for action
and given, as it were, wings and feet.
All of the organs within the human
frame are as susceptible to removal
as are the hairs of the head or the
fingers on the hand.
"Somewhere in Arabic legend," said
Dr. Fox, "I have read of angels lean
ing over the battlements of heaven,
throwing their loosened golden girdles
to weary toilers up the shining stairs,
the sooner and- the surer to make cer
tain their entrance into the Eternal
City. To-day we throw to you one end
of our girdles with more than loving
invitation to invite and draw you- into
the fold of our ecstatic life. Will you
join us and â "
"Yes, yes, come and join us!" cried
voices from all over the several plat
forms.
"See what I was and am!" shrieked
one whom the president called "Miss
Blonm." "Obesity was my curse. Mind
has triumphed over matter! Look how
slender I have become."
"Come and join us, come and Join
us," they cried. "Mind must triumph
over matter. Sacrifice your stomachs
to higher aspirations."
The lights began to flicker in a
strange, weird way. My bosom friend
and I became frightened and we fled
from Beatific Hall.
I wonder where that society will end
if it keeps developing along such lines?
H. A. BENEDICT.THE LATEST NECKWEAR FOR THE SPRING GIRL.
TT : E spring girl and her bow will be
this year. Bows are
to be so plentiful that no young
woman need be without one. And,
happy thought ' There are not only
to be bows in great number, but bows in
many varied types. The spring girl need
never grow tired of her spring bow, for
she 'lay change it at will.
Tha bows are not of the masculine per
suasion. They are of chiffon, satin and
silk, and are altogether the gayest things
in Town. There is a delicate, fluffy bow,
bedecked with lace frills, and the plain
bo-R', tied with tailor-like severity. There
art- big bows and little bows, butterfly
bows and many variations of the four-in
htnd ties.
Xo matter how many bows the spring
g rl may claim as her own, she must have
one or two at least in the gay Roman
colors.
A bow Just In town is made of Roman
striped silk and boasts of beautiful silk
fringe ends. It is tied about a high linen
collar and Is arranged in front in a bow
with ends which reach Just a trifle below
the corsage. These bows come not only
in dark shades striped with scarlet, vivid
green and brilliant yellow, but they can
be bought in all the light evening shades,
in soft cream, for example, crossed with
lines of baby blue, violet and faint pink,
â¢with here and there a hair line of black.
The four-in-hands come not only in
these same Roman colors and finished
with fringed ends, but they may be bought
in all the brightest plaids. In the Roman
scarfs the stripes run not only up and
down, but bayadere.
There are so many varieties of four-in
hand ties this spring that the up-to-date
girl might wear one every day and yet
her ties would never look alike. In the
first place, there is the conventional four
in-hand in Roman stripes with silk fringe
ends; then there is the four-in-hand in
satin or silk, which peeps out from be
neath a small turned-down fur collar, and
which was designed purposely to be worn
right after the fur boa is taken off.
The accordion-plaited four-in-hands are
also all the vogue. They come principally
in plain colors, and are tied to show an
.unusually small knot. Their fanlike
spreading ends are extremely pretty. One
of the daintiest of the new four-in-hands
Is made of sheer white lawn, with the
ends covered with an applique of leaf
embroidery. This tie Is sold in connection
â¢with a finely plaited stock of the white
lawn, which is made with embroidered
turnover points. A novel and new four
in-hand is also a combination of tie and
stock. The stock is of ribbon, and the
four-in-hand does not appear until some
distance below it, but is so connected with
the stock by two narrow ribbon bands.
These four-in-hands are generally made
up In silk and lace, the long flowing ends
finished with lace frills.
The bow and the four-in-hand also com
bine their charms this spring. One of the
latest of the neckwear fancies shows first
a big fluffy lace bow, mounted on an in
conspicuous stock, while below It a rib
bon four-in-hand with lace ends peeps
out. This novelty is frequently varied by
having both the bow and the four-in-hand
made of accordion-plaited silk or satin.
Even the tailor-made girl will wear this
year a wide mull or net scarf. It must
be very wide to be in fashion and must
tie in a big bow straight under her chin
There are the plain scarfs of mull and
mousseline de soie, with tucked ends
then there are those ' of black chiffon
with white lace designs appliqued to the
ends as a border, and others in white
chiffon with black lace borders, besides a
great variety of net scarfs with lace ends.
But no matter how many mull scarfs
the tailor-made girl may own, she will
always be true to the severe little string
tie and the masculine Ascot. There are
extremely narrow ! string ties this year,
as well, the tie which. fastens in front
with a tiny accordion-plaited bow. The
newest ties of this description show the
Koman colors and are very fetching
with the severe tailor gowns. ' The latest
Ascot is all accordion plaited and comes
â¢in exceptionally light colors.
Besides the neckties the neck ruffs
fancy fronts and Huffy boas are Just
now receiving their perennial . welcome.
An odd ruff much in demand is made of
three semi-circular rurnes of crepe de
chine held in place with tiny rosettes of
lace. This ruff is finished in front with
two long stole ends of the crepe de chine
edged with lace like that used for the ro
settes. It can be bought not only in
black crepe de chine, with white laâ¢
rosettes, but in all the newest colors of
the season.
The young person who Is accustomed
to transforming her wardrobe at will can
effectively change this ruff when she
grows tired of its lace trimming by sub
stituting a knot of violets or a cluster of
forget-me-nots in place of the rosettes
and by using a flower fringe instead of
lace ends. Another popular ruff so high
that It almost covers the ears from view

THE Love Affairs of Some Famous Men" is as
good aa its title, and both are by the author
Â° t*. Vtn He Ha PPy Though Married."
It s very trying to be married to a genius or a
Tool, cays the author of this chatty book. Montes
quieu was once at work when some one rushed in
shouting "Fire.'" "Qo to my wife," ho replied, as he
â¢went on writing; "thesp matters belong to her." On
the other hand, Longfellow and Lowell were ex
cellent husbands. Confucius was so worried by his
wife that he had to divorce her before he could wc.-rk
in peace. Byron's most unhappily wedded mate once
ask^i him at his study door: 'Do I disturb you, By
ron?" To which he answered: "Damnably!" ' He
would not so have spoken to- the Countess (iulccioli,
who was his companion in Italy In later years.
Scientists are curious husbands. Once Mr#. Agas-
Biz screamed on finding a snake in her shoe in the
morning. Her husband asked what was the matter.
"Why, a little snake has just crawled out of my
boot."
"Only one? There should have been three."
He had put them there to keep warm.
Tyndall married a daughter of Lord Claude Hamil
ton, who thought a mere professor not good enough for
a lord's child. Their life was very happyâ in fact, sci
entists seem to make the best husbandsâ but It was
her terrible fate to end her husband's life by giving
him an overdose of chloral by mistake.
Edison once stood behind a telegraph operator's
chair.
"Mr. Edison," ssid Miss Stillwell, "I can always tell
when you are behind me or near me."
This was the opening for which the wizard Vaited,
and he replied: "I've been thinking about you of late,
and if you are willing to marry me I'd like to marry
you." And they did.
Daudet's wife was not only an excellent housekeeper,
but a fine literary critic, who helped Alphonse at his
work. Cooper and Hawthorne were both encouraged
by their wives to begin writing their masterpieces.
Thomas Hardy dropped architecture to become a nov
elist at his wife's urging. Max O'Rell's translator and
literary helper is his English wife.
But these men were not poets. Women who marry
poets play "a game of double or quits." There was
Dante. He had a wife and seven children after set
tling down, but he never forgot his Beatrice, and poor
Mrs. Dante wasn't permitted to forget her, either.
"Whensoever she appeared before him, he had no ene
my left on earth." Chaucer, who himself married one
of the ladies of a queen's bedchamber, wrote:
Marriage is such a rabble rout
That those who are out would fain eet in
And those who are in would fain get out.
Shakespeare wedded a woman much older than him
self, and their child was born very soqn after. In his
will he left the lady his "second best bed," which may
have had a subtle sentimental meaning, like Pickwick's
chops and tomato sauce.
When Milton was 35 he married Mary Powell, the
daughter of a gay, bustling house. She didn't enjoy 4
o'clock rising and long prayers, and in a month ran
away home. Subsequently she came back and fell on
her knees to him â and he used the scene as the mate

broidered with spangles to represent
some crawling animal. For instance, a
soft cream-colored satin, selling at an ex
orbitantly high price, showed green liz
ards, which looked as if they were crawl
ing over the satin from the neck to the
waist band. They were exquisitely em
broidered In the finest of shaded green
spangles, and these effective spangles
formed entirely the high stock collar.
Tucked fancy fronts are, all the vogue,
and some show narrow lace insertions
alternating with the groups of tucks.
The boas are full and fluffier than ever.
Those in chiffon and gauze tie in front
with long ribbon ends, and the ends are
finished with row after row of tiny chif
fon frills.
The feather boas will be more popular
than for many seasons past. Not only
will they be worn in black and in solid
colors to match exactly the costume, but
many shaded boas will be seen.
To make a first-class stock or bow you
must begin at the wrong end of the
business. Buy one! It is absolutely ne
cessary to observe the way a "boughten"
tie is put together before attempting one
yourself, unless perhaps you have an ex
cellent fashion-plate of one and are
"handy." Be cartful in making one that
your work does not have the "all but"
appearance common to so many home
attempts at making dainty trifles. But
with a knack and a willingness and the
materials, there is no reason why good
results should not follow your efforts. Do
not mako the mistake of using old ma
terials. You must purchase good new silk
or chiffon or you will have poor success.
To use a piece of ribbon around the
neck in such a manner that it has the
latest look proceed as follows: Take one
end of the ribbon and pin it to the belt in
front. Carry the other end around the
neck and around again, laying it as flat
as possible until it has passed twice
around the neck. Now bring the end
down even with the other one and cut it
off. Tie in a i'our-in-hand knot at a point
three inches below the neck and directly
under the chin.
Many people have trouble with these
rib) on collars, claiming that it is impos- ...
sible to keep them erect around the neck.
They sag and present an untidy appear
ance. There is only one way to keep
them up. Wear underneath the ribbon a
very narrow linen collar, one that hugs
theneck closely. At the first turn of the
ribbon the linen collar is hidden. The
ribbon will now keep its place nicely and
be protected from the nock as well. A
ribbon worn in this way lasts twice as
long. Many persons purchase very nar
row linen collars for this purpose alone.
As it comes spring the question of a
fashionable color arises. Last spring it
was green, the spring before it was ma
genta. the preceding spring blue, the one
before that brown, and so back to that

of the creation! She died young. Milton's second wife
died a year after marriage. In his third retribution
smote him, for she was the termr he had deserved
Before their marriage he had never seen her. She sur
vived him 53 years, and, according to Johnson, cheated
his children.
De Quincey rushed into print to abuse Wordsworth,
who never read the articles. "He says your wife's too
good for you," a friend once quoted. "There he's
right," cried the poet. Long after one who went to
Kyeal Mount "saw the old man walking in the garden
with his wife. They were both quite old and he was
almost blind, but they seemed like sweethearts court
ing."
Shelley, already with one broken heart experience,
wedded at 19 a girl of 16, and the two children played
at light housekeeping on buns and things. Later he
deserted his wife and she drowned herself in the Ser
pentine.
Landor's wife mortally offended him in their honey
moon by jumping up to look at a Punch and Judy
show while he was reading his own poetry. He was
a burly, roaring fellow, with a colossal conceit. She
was gentle and not over-bright. So he deserted her
and their children shamelessly.
Byron's life was embittered by his early love affair
with Mary Anne Chaworth. The "Maid of Athens" was
a daughter of Mine, Macri, wife of a British vice-con
sul in Athens. Byron didn't love his wife and she
couldn't stand nine executions in the house for debt in
one year, not to speak of marital misconduct. So they
parted.
Goethe was a terror. After "Gretchen" Anna Kath
arina, Charity Meixner, "Emilia" and "Lucinda" he
devoted himself to Charlotte Buff (Lotte) and Ann
Muench. After a little affair with "Lili" Schoenemann.
he fell in love with the Baroness Stein, the mother of
seven children, but still able to keep the poet awake
three nights meditating on her charms before he'd even
seen her. He wrote her a thousand letters. Then
came Ohristiane Vulpius, a fat, gross, drunken creat
ure, whom Goethe married when he was 58. Before
and after their marriage they lived together 28 years
until her death. At 74 the widower fell in love with
Miss Yon Lewezon and later yet with Mme. Szyman
owska. Goethe, like Bobby Burns, had a beautiful vis
age and an eye which, it was said, no woman could
resist.
Heine told his patient, much-enduring wife to marry
after his death, so that at least one man might mourn
him.
"Have your jest, dear," she replied, placidly; "you
can't do without me."
Every Monday Heine used to beat her, In a sort of
Joke, which hurt her feelings terribly, although she
was three times as strong as he.
Hood was another poet who deHghted in playing
jokes on his wife, though they were of a different kind.
Most beautiful was Browning's love story. Eliza
beth Barrett was a poet herself, and in such poor
health that her parents opposed her marriage to

wonderful navy blue season we had not
many yearn ago.
This .year the color bids fair to be
purple. But this Â»s nothing strange as
purple blossoms out as regularly' as
Easter comes around. It may be said
that next to purple will come a light
shade of green almost soft In its delicacy
In neck trimmings this green will be
much worn. It can be found in chiffons
and in silks, and it comes in some kinds
of lace. The softest green thread comes
for making into lace for the neck which
can be knitted so delicately that the lace
passes for something very fine.
White chiffon is much combined with
green silk, and there is a wavy green ma
terial thinner than crepe that "is also used
for neckwear.
After the green this year will come all
the shades of red, with a predominance
Dickens and his wife separated after twenty years
of not always unhappy married life, apparently by the
man's fault mainly. His wife was not fine enough for
his new fortunes. Thackeray was a good husband and
father, but his wife went crazy and had to go to an
"institution." There was something sordid about
Charles Reade's life "romance." He couldn't marry
without losing his college fellowship, but formed an
"alliance." possibly Platonic, with Laura Seymour, an
actress, whose dissolute husband Reade kept in spend
ing money.
Jean Paul Richter said that woman's soul as well as
her body is bound in an eternal corset, but he seems
to have been "happy, though married." Balzac once
met in a Swiss inn a Princess who was reading one
of his stories. They corresponded and after her Prince
died .Balzac was promoted to the vacant place in her
heart and great domain.
Dr. Johnson was gross, fat, short-sighted, scarred by
scrofula and a pig at table. At 26 he married a woman
of 46, whom he disciplined a little, obeyed fairly well,
loved devotedly and missed, after her death, very
much. Johnson had a low opinion of women, who, he
said, could neither make a good book of cookery nor
even dress in good taste, but O how he could flatter
the pretty girls in his elephantine way!
Thomas Carlyle's marriage has been more written
about than that of any other man, however great.
Both he and Mrs. Carlyle were cheated of their first
loves, and there was besides, according to Dr. Peck,
of cherry. The most vivid scarlets will
be in style, and the woman who can
wear red will be happy, for her complex
ion will be suited every time.
Red goes well with all complexions, so
neckwear-makers have discovered, and
the white chiffon stock with its tiny
border of scarlet is no novelty.

Browning. Both believed In, but neither practiced free

Browning used sometimes to kiss the paving stones in
front of the door of the church where he was mar

of verse In his wife-s coffin. Seven years later they
were dug up and printed.
Steele captured a very beautiful lady by his art In
writing love letters, and when they were married he
used to get drunk, while she fought the wolf with cold
British valor and kept upon her husband as tight rein
as she could.

When he was 80 he wrote that she had always been

charming little reception gown, trimmed
with pink gauae ruches. Three of these
ruches are set in parallel scallops around
the bottom of the skirt. The waist Is
quite elaborate, made in a low-cut blouse
shape, slashed to the belt in front and
filled in with a guimpe composed of al
ternate gauze ruches and insertions. The
blouse front is embroidered with a de
sign of fuchsias, beaded and spangled.
The sleeves are of shirred gauze. On the
left side of the front is a cerise velvet
ribbon knot with a steel buckle, connect
ing by a band of the ribbon to a belt to
match.
A checked wool In green and a light
castor-color combined is a handsome ef
fect and serviceable. The skirt Is In one
of the flounced styles, having a very nar
row front breadth, with the upper p"art of
the sides and back fitted, and the lower
part joined on in a curved flounce grad
uating higher toward the back. A band
of dark green silk heads the flounce, and
another is put above. The side fastened
waist is pleated in toward the belt, but
not bloused. In the top is a guimpe of
castor-colored cloth with green silk folds,
and below the guimpe a triple scalloped
collar of cloth. The belt is of green
silk.
A child's frock of dark red cashmere
Is trimmed with narrow bias puffs of

Carlyle was very near a genius herself and almost as

with a very bad aim. And after her death, how the

make good husbands, in spite of their nerves. Wagner
was perhaps an exception, but even he behaved well to
the other man's wife â Bulow's â after they had rear

The most bitterly debated marriage ever made must
have been that of Martin Luther, whose wife used to
scold him heartily, though she had been a gentle nun.
Swift loved his Stella, was secretly married to her,
some say, and after he died a lock of her hair was
found in his desk, labeled "only a woman's hair."
Sterne was a mean and unfaithful husband, but In
general clergymen have been guilty of nothing worse
than nagging. Many have forgotten that Cardinal
Manning was once married before he left the English
Church. His wife died after four years of a very hap
py union. Whitfield's wife also died In four years,
somewhat to his relief, as he confessed, though she was
too good for him, and heartened the poor spiritless
fellow by sea and on land as best she could. Once
when a mob began throwing stones at him she stood
at his side shouting: "Now, George, play the man for
God!"
And again when they were bound for Georgia and
an enemy was about to attack the ship, the stout
hearted woman made cartridges while her husband
trembled and confessed his fears.
Mrs. John Wesley was a woman of quite another
sort; indeed, she was a terror, and went on occasions
even as far as hair-pulling, for which the saintly life
of her spouse certainly gave little provocation.
Lawyers have had their share of marriage tribula

lady who chose the latter and made him desperately
unhappy.

THE MOODUS NOISES.
It is stated that the disturbances of the lower Con
necticut Valley, which produce what from early colo
nial times have been called the "Moodus Noises,"
have begun again, after a period of rest of twelve
years.
BOMAN RIBBON JTIE D IN LATEST ST7L&
MORE MASCULTN'R RFFECT.
For twenty years, up to 1729, the villagers of thÂ«
town of East Haddam heard these noises almost con
tinuously. The Rev. Mr. Hosmer, In a letter written
August 13, 1729, says, in speaking of the phenomenon!
""Whether it be fire or air distressed in the subterrane
ous caverns of the earth cannot be known; for there
is no eruption, no explosion perceptible, but by sounds
and tremors, which are sometimes very fearful and
dreadful. I have myself heard eight or ten sounds
successively, and imitating small arms, in the space
of five minutes. I have, I suppose, heard several hun
dreds of them within twenty years; some more, some
less terrible. Sometimes we have heard them almost
every day, and great numbers of them In the space of
a year. Oftentimes I have observed them coming
down from the north, imitating slow thunder, until
the sound came near or right under, and then there
seemed to be a breaking like the noise or a cannon
shot or severe thunder, which shakes the houses and
all that is in them."
The center from which the noises proceed seems
to be Mount Tom, situated at the junction of Moodus
and Salmon rivers. The severest shocks have been
felt as far northeast as Boston and as far southwest
as New York, and have there been noticed as earth
quakes. In 1816 and 1817 these noises were more than
usually loud. On the recent recurrence there was a
sound resembling a clap of thunder, rollowed for a
couple of hours by a roar like the echoes of a distant
cataract. A day later there was heard a crashing
sound like that of heavy muffled thunder, and a roar
not unlike the wind in a tempest. The ground was so
shaken as to cause a rattle as though an earthquake
were in progress.
The Indians, familiar with these noises long be
fore the advent of the whites among them, called the
region now embraced in the town of East Haddam,
and particularly that situated in the vicinity of Mount
Tom, Matchemadoset, or "at the place of bad noises."
This name, corrupted and contracted Machamoodus,
and finally to Moodus, gives name to a branch of
Salmon River and to a manufacturing village. The
region where these subterranean disturbances have
occurred from time immemorial is one of deformed
crystalline rock.
THE CATACOMBS LIGHTED BY ELECTRICITY.
The visitor to Italy complains of modern steam
tug 9on the Grand Canal in Venice and the new
fangled ideas of cleanliness in the streets of Naples
and the new quarters in Rome, but the height of the
prosaic seems to have been reached with the illumina
tion of the catacombs by electric light. No more dim
distances, in which one must take care not to be lost,
no more monk guides, holding lighted tapers, no more
darkness, mystery and imagination. This being the
feast of St. Cecilia, says the Rome correspondent of
the Pall Mall Gazette, the catacombs of St. Calixtus,
where the Roman virgin was buried in 177 A. D., were
for the first time all glowing and glaring with thou
sands of electric globes illuminating even the most
remote corners, and giving to the whole a mundane
jrather than a mystic air.

GRANDPA'S VALENTINE.
H"X 7'ES." paid grandpa, "there is
\/ one valentine that I would
V like, and that would be a mes
sage bringing news of my
-*- brother Ned. Poor boy," he
mused. "I have not seen him since we
parted at Marysville, nearly forty
years ago."
"Where did he go?" asked Thornton
Graham, a bright boy of 16. "Have you
never heard from him since, grand
pa?"
"I have never heard from him and
suppose that he is dead long ago," and
grandpa sighed heavily.
"When is your birthday, grandpa?"
"It falls on Saint Valentine's day."
Thornton Graham said nothing more,
but went out c-f the room. Then he
carefully studied the list of vessels to
arrive. When he had done this he went
to the Merchants' Exchange on Cali
fornia street and asked many ques
tions. The answers seemed to satisfy
him, and he left the exchange, whist
ling merrily and so preoccupied that
he did not notice his father, who
passed him. smiling.
"â¢Have y< -u been buying a ship,
Thornton?" he asked.
Thornton looked up suddenly and
was confused. "Please, papa, don't
ask any questions."
But from that time on for some days
Thornton was ill at ease. He was the
first to get the morning and evening
papers. He spent all his leisure ask
ing questions of men interested in
shipping and in scanning the bulletin
board at the Merchants' Exchange
that told of the latest arrivals by sea.
One day when he was in school a
messenger inquired for him. He went
to hfs teacher and asked to be excused
at once.
"On what account?" the teacher
asked.
He whispered earnestly to the teach-*
er, who excused him. The other pupils
In the school noticed that the teacher
was pleased all the remainder of the
day.
Meanwhile Thornton walked rapidly
to the water front and the messenger,
â¢who continued with him, spoke to a
boatman, who at once invited Thornton
to get into his boat. A few minutes
later Thornton was by the side of a
newly arrived ship, that had come in
from Sydney, N. S. W. Hardly was he
over the side of vessel when he saw an
old gentleman talking with the master.
He walked rapidly to them and said:
"I am Thornton Graham."
"And I," said the old gentleman in
response am "
"Hush," said Thornton.
Grandpa's birthday arrived, and the
family gathered to celebrate it. There
â¢were young and old, all of whom came
to the sturdy and kind old California
pioneer.
"But where Is Thornton?" asked
grandpa.
"He is here," answered Thornton,
who had just entered, "and I have
taken the liberty to bring a gentleman
â who resides In Australia, and who says
that he knew you in the early days in
California."
When the boy stopped speaking, he
brought forward the old gentleman
whom we have seen on the deck of the
ship from Australia.
"Bless the Lord," ejaculated grandpa,
w-hile his face was pale and red by
turns, and his eyes were filled with
tears, "it is Edward, who has come
back to me after nearly forty years."
"It is indeed Ned," responded the
stranger, "and I must say that your
eyesight remains good, for I am
changed in appearance."
What a happy and merry party that
was at dinner. Grandpa and Uncle Ned
had to sit side by side and they fre
quently stopped to throw their arms
around each other and to laugh and
cry, and all the others were compelled
to laugh or cry with them.
Then Thornton told his story. He had
seen an Australian paper containing an
advertisement signed by Uncle Ned,
asking for information concerning
grandpa. He had entered into corre
spondence and had assured Uncle Ned
that grandpa was alive. Then Uncle
Xed made haste to visit San Francisco.
Thornton demanded as his reward for
bringing the two brothers together that
Uncle Ned should not make himself
known till grandpa's birthday. Grandpa
had to hug Thornton repeatedly and so
did Uncle Ned.
"I'll answer you, now, papa," said
Thornton, "about buying a ship."
"No need of an answer, Thornton.
My blessing upon you."
Uncle Ned explained. He had come
from Marysvllle to San Francisco in
the early days and had been kidnaped
to serve on a ship bound for Australia.
Before he had time to return he heard
that grandpa was dead, and for many
years he thought him to be dead. But
one day he advertised and from it came
the reunion of the two brothers.
"Thornton," said grandpa after din
ner, "you have brought me the best
valentine on earth. You could not have
done better if you had been Saint Val
entine."
A DOG THAT HAS
A SENSE OF HUMOR,
The pet of the Potrero Police Station
is a little wire-haired terrier dog named
Keys. Where he came from nobody
knows. Like Topsy, he "just come."
Keys' first appearance at the station
was five years ago, and a more ragged,
half-starved, miserable beast could not
have been found in seven counties. Lieu
tenant G. W. Bennett, then sergeant,
took pity on the poor little fellow and
fed him well, hoping that he would go
away with the next man who spoke
kindly to him. Not so. Keys stayed
at the heels of his benefactor and
would not be driven away. The first
performance of the little tramp was a
trick that gave him the name that has
always clung to him. Bennett was out
one nigh, and, when jumping over a
mud puddle, lost a bunch of keys and
his whistle, but he did not miss them
until he reached the station. Then he
was mad, for he knew where the keys
had been dropped.
In no good hunmr, he started for thÂ«
THE VALENTINE DAY LARK OF THE BUMPKINS WITH THE GRANGER WHO IS HAVING SPORT.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 1898.
place where ho had jumped the puddle,
but as he arose from his chair he no
ticed that the canine tramp held some
thing bright in his mouth. It was the
bunch of keys, and the stray was then
given his name, Keys. This act of in
telligence made him the favorite of the
men, and it was but a short time that
he was found to be very fond of play
ing ball. For hours Keys would run
and fetch the ball for anyone who
would play with him. Keys loved to
play ball so much that the boys of the
Potrero would ask to have him for a
mascot when they had a game to play
with some other club, and more than
once Keys was taken to Central Park
when the Union Iron Works team had
a game with the Pacific Rolling Mills
or the Butchertown teams, and Keys
was always on the winning side.
But Keys' last performance with the
ball turned out to be rather expensive
to his friend Bennett, as well as the
druggist who keeps the store on the
earner of Kentucky and Twentieth
streets. Lieutenant Bennett .went to
the store and bought the little dog a
fine rubber ball, which he took to the
station. The druggist thought to have
a joke on the police officer, and one
day he saw the dog lying on the side
walk and told him to go fetch the ball.
Keys, ready for play, rushed into the
station and in a moment was out with
the ball, which he gave to the drug
gist. After a short play the druggist
took the ball into the store and hid it.
A little later Lieutenant Bennett had to
buy a new ball, and the druggist sold
him the same article he had taken from
Keys. This fun was kept up for sev
eral days, every time selling the same
ball to the officer. After the officer had
bought that one ball eight times he
found out the trick that the druggist
had played on him and he resolved to
get even. One day he took Keys into
the store, when only the clerk was in,
and showed the little dog- where the
balls were kept and made him jump up
and get one.
Then the tables were turned. Twice
a day, when the druggist was out, Mr.
Bennett would send Keys after a ball,
and the dog always came back with a
new one. He would bring back big
ones and little ones, cheap balls and
high-priced ones, until the shelf over
the officer's locker was filled with
enough to stock a toy shop. The drug
gist raved and swore that the children
of the neighborhood were stealing from
him. To save some innocent child from
being unjustly accused Mr. Bennett at
last told the druggist of the way he
had turned the joke and how the dog
had helped him in the fun. As Mr. Ben
nett had had all the fun .he wished for
in this direction he gave back to the
druggist all the balls that Keys had
stolen, except the eight that had been
paid for. But poor Keys has to suffer
for all the fun he made for the others.
ROYAL AND THE RAIN.
By Relnhold Richter
The clouds were dark and heavy,
The rain came pattering down,
And Royal by the window
Gazed" out with pout and frown.
But, as he gazed out. quickly
His face grew bright with joy,
"Mamma says smiles are sunbeams" â
Mused thoughtful little Roy.
"Perhaps if I laugh softly
The big drops will not stayâ
For sunshine always frightens
The naughty rain away."
I smiled to hear ray baby,
My baby man so wise.
But oh, in that brief moment
A wonder filled my eyes.
For, lo! a quivering sunbeam
Stole through the window pane.
"Oh. oh!" cried Royal gayly.
"I've laughed away the rain."

By this time the little boy and girl

the little girl said:

"That is so," answered little Toddle

laughing, and the frogs laughed, too.
CRUISE OF THE CALIFORNIA.
(Synopsis of preceding chapters.â The army
of savages commanded by Blnnle marched to
the Marwipe River and there waited for the
skull-hunters to cross the river, under the
command of Ghocr-Ghee-Tee, to attack them.
Binnie led 10,000 savages to battle. They were
driven back by the superior numbers of the
skull-hunters, but returned to the attack, un
der Blrmie's leadership, on the folllowlng day.
At an opportune moment, Kemona, who has
seen the war canoes coming at a- distance on
tha river, hastens forward, tells Mr. Ostend
(for he was in command of the war canoes,
having taken boats at the place where ho
could no longer sail the California) of the
need of his presence on the battle-field. Soon
after the roar of the machine-gun which had
been taken from the California la heard, and
the hosts of Ghoor-Ghee-Tee melt away be
fore Its iron rain. With Mr. Ostend are Bin
nie s five boy friends, all California boys, and
also his father and some friendly savages
whom Mr. Ostend has persuaded to row tha
canoes up the river for him. Ghoor-Ghee-Tee
has run away with the savages of his tribes
and his power is broken, so much so that the
white men will have no troble in marching
across his country to go to the land of the
Afarkise. where the white captive. King, to
rescue whom the white men cama to New
Guinea, will be found surrounded by his sub
jects, who are also his captors.)
I WILL, not take your time to read
about how the white men crossed
the land of the akull hunters, nor to
relate the small skirmishes that
took place with the Afarkise.
Throughout that hard journey, filled
with privations, the six California boy 3
showed that they were worthy to have
been selected to undertake the most
daring of adventures. They grew
hardier and braver constantly, and
more competent to look out for them
selves.
Binnie's army melted away In the
land of Ghoor-Ghee-Tee, for the sav
ages were nearly all thieves, and the
chance they had to steal the cattle and
other wealth of the skull -hunters was
more than they could resist. They de
serted and left Binnie with only Koti,
of all their number, to remind him of
his life among and his command over
them. So there were only ten persona
in the party who were now to try to
carry away a King from his people.
These were Mr. Ostend, Binnie's
father, Binnie and the five other brave
California boys, faithful Kemona and
Koti, the savage chief who had been
second in command of Binnie's savage
army. They were in a land filled with
thousands of savages, any one of whom
would have taken their lives for a
much smaller cause than the secret one
for which they had journeyed.
Koti was the guide of the party. He
was ordered to take them to the chief
village of the King by the shortest
way. He led them, after many days,
to the top of a lofty table mountain.
Their eyes sa.w a great valley, sur
rounded on all sides by steep moun
tains.
"How much further have we to go?"
asked Mr. Ostend.
"The King's village is In that valley."
"Is there a trail down from here?"
"No, we must travel four days' march
to reach the only place where the na
tive can enter."
"Koti," asked Mr. Ostend, "do you
think that we are going to climb over
these mountains many miles, when the
king's village is just below us?"
"What else can we do?" asked Bln
nie.
"Do you see these great leaves?
They are tougher than the stoutest
cloth, and yet you see that they are
very thin.
"Well?"
"You spoke yesterday of the sticky
gum of what you called glue trees."
"What has all that to do with us?"
"We are going down into the valley
from here to-morrow, and in para
chutes. Of course they will be larger
than any parachute you have ever seen,
but we shall surprise the natives, ana,
if I am not mistaken, we shall make a
favorable impression upon them, for
our descent will be sensational ."
All day the party worked under the
direction of Mr. Ostend, and the result
was the production of four enormous
sheets of cloth-like substance, of great
strength. The next morning the party
were early astir. Out of the grass they
wove baskets, and to these attached
ropes, which they also mad\ When
they rested for dinner, which consisted
of mountain trout and wild strawber
ries, they had in prospect a great sail
through the air. Three boys were to
ride in each of the last two parachutes
to go. The other two were to be occu
pied by Mr. Ostend and Kemona and
Mr. Lane and Koti.
A light wind was setting from the
mountain top toward the valley, and
on this the four parachutes were
floated. It must be confessed that the
boys and also Koti were a little
alarmed as they found themselves
adrift in the air so far above the val
ley. For giant trees in the valley were
to their eyes not taller than small
bushes, and thousands of savages, who
were watching the strange objects that
were coming through the air toward
them, looked to be not larger than in
sects when the air carriages first left
the level of the lofty table mountain.
The wind, blowing without variation,
carried all the parachutes in the
same direction and to about a uniform
distance from the summit. Below the
summit the air was very still, and the
four parachutes settled In a cluster,
like a flock of four strange and huge
birds. Such they appeared at first to
the ignorant savages to be. But as
they drew nearer a great shout ran
around among the savage throng:
"See the flying houses coming from
the sky!"
At a word from Mr. Ostend the ten
men began to fire their revolvers in
the air and kept up a steady fusillade,
so that to the savages it was as if
from the flying houses fountams of
fire were shooting toward the sky and
that the sky was thundering.
From thousands of grass-thatched
huts the savages were poured out, as
from a huge ant hill â thousands and
thousands of black savages. They
climbed to the tops of a semi-circle
of hills that rose above their village,
and there awaited with curiosity and
fear for the flying houses to touch the
earth.
Silent they were as statues until
they saw in the flying houses white
men. Then they wailed, for their
great witch doctor had said that never,
until white men should come from
the sky, should their great white king
be taken from them. And now the
white men had come, surounded with
the thunders and the lightning of the
skies, and they saw their hour of
doom, for the witch doctor had aJso
said that with the departure of th*
king would come about the ruin of the
land and the people.
But, among the throng was the white
King, and he saw and knew that the
letter that he had sent forth in a san
dal wood box had reached brave men
and that before his eyes were those
who had risked a horrible death in a
strange and savage land to save him
from captivity, and to restore him to
his own people. He was so moved with
gladness that he could hardly refrain
from showing it.
A shout from the savage multitudes
was raised as the parachutes touched
the hilltops.
Forth came tha Great Witch Doctor
and stood before the people. "The
hour has come," he said. "Prepare to
lose your King and your land."
Then arose from all sides a cry of
rage, such a cry as can only come from
a great multitude â from a multitude of
savages in extreme wrath.
Dusky hands were placed on bow
strings and threatening looks were on
the faces of the savages. One false
move on the part of Harry Ostend
would have ruined all. One moment
and the white men would be annihi
lated. Only superstition kept the sav
ages in awe for an instant.
Never was Harry Ostend cooler and
more completely master of his nerves
than he was then, in the greatest dan
ger the party had so far met. He saw
that he must win the day by a strata
gemâbut by what?
Slowly and coolly, while arrows ana
darts were leveled in the direction of
his party, and thousands of eyes glared
hostility at him, he poured from his
liquor flask a quantity of spirits into a
cup and dropped in the spirits a light
ed match. When the liquor blazed up
he threw the liquid upon the grass.
"The white men can burn water."
shrieked the affrighted savages, "and
see, the water sets fire to the world."
Then the savages fled in all possible
haste before these strange men who
might burn up the world. Nor did
they stop running until they were In
their village nor until the witch doctor
had told them that there they were
safe. D. H. W.

GOODEST OLD DOCTOR,
The goodest old doctor came when we
were sick â
That is, dolly was sick, and me.
When I ran out my tongue ho said,
very quick,
"You'll need lemonade, that I can
see."
And he sounded like fairies I've heard
in my dreams,
When he said, "Don't forget to take
chocolate creams.
"Tour pulse beats so fast that fresh
caramels I
"Shall prescribe, also peppermint
drops.
"Take buttercups, Ice cream and cocoa
nut pie,
"And cream soda, until the pain
stops."
Then I ran out my tongue for my
dolly. Said he:
**Glve her some of the same; tea
same symptoms I see."
Well, the dolly, you know, was sick
only in play;
And she really can't talk, drink or
eat.
But I took enough medicine for dolly
that dayâ
And for me, too â pie, cakes, candies
sweet.
I was doctored for both, and the
queerest thing still
Is that dolly is well but her mamma
is ill!
THE WEDDING OF
THE WILD FLOWERS,
I was walking along a Californlahill
side and stopped to admire a young
eucalyptus tree that was pranked out
in all its beauty. I heard a voice that
came from the eucalyptus. It said
plainly, "There is going to be a wed
ding."
That seemed a queer thing for a
tree to be talking about, but the birds
talk so much about love in their nests
that the trees have a chance to learn
much.
In a sunny hollow there were some
buttercups in blossom, among the
grass, and they were all aflutter with
the news, which they were talking
over.
Just then the wind, which had never
done anything the like before, so far
as I knew, said several times "Amen,
amen, amen."
"Ha, ha!" laughed the California
quail, "the wind is going to be the par
son to marry the California poppy and
the blue chicory, and he is practicing."
So it was. Hidden behind the shel
tering screen of manzanita trees I
was able to see all. The bride was the
California poppy and her bridal dress
was as radiant as the most glorious
sunset. The bridegroom was a tall,
graceful chicory blossom.
The wind was the first to kiss the
bride after the wedding. Then the
stately chicory bent over, at the sug
gestion of the wind, and touched his
lips to the bride's glowing face. This
was some years ago. Since then the
chicory and the poppy families have
lived closely together, and many, have
been the weddings.
GOLDILOCKS AND JACK,
C. M. D., 2311 Jackson street, San Fran
cisco, writes: My little brother and I are
very much interested in the new storiea
that are going to be in The Call. My
brother prefers "Jack the Giant Killer"
to anything else, and I prefer to hear
what happened to Goldilocks after she
ran away from the three bears. I am
very anxious to hear how the bears got
loose after Goldilocks nailed them to the
bed post and if she had any more ad
ventures; and if she married a prince,
and how many children she had. Did she
always ha\ - e the same curly, golden hair,
like that she had when she was a little
girl? And was the prince nice? And did
he live In a golden palace, with diamond*
and rubies and all kinds of beautiful
stones in It? And was all the furnitur*
gold and silver? Did he own a. lot of
land? And was Goldilocks a good, kind
queen? I hope to know all this In a lit
tle time, for I am very fond of Goldi
locks.THE GOOD COON SONG,
THE BAD COON SINGER, AND AN
EMOTIONAL COMEDIAN.
Perhaps influenced by May Irwin I
used to think that what is called the
viodern coon song was entirely the in
vention of the white person and that
only the white person could sing it with
he real fancy flavor and the light
pumpkin-colored insinuation. We live
and learn. Here at the California are
the Black Patti's variegated trouba
dours singing coon songs for all the
earth as well as any imitation coons
ever dared to do, with just as much
Hash-nigger swagger and crappy enter
prise and emancipated move-on, and
ten times as much inspired ginger in
the choruses. There is no reason why
the modern coon shouldn't do this, but
it la none the less surprising that he
noes. There is no constitutional reason
that I know of why the colored person
should not sing in any kind of music
as lovely and facile a note as the white
person, but did you ever hear a coon
who could sing real music, who had in
his or her voice a quality that, for ail
its occasional hints of sweetness and
sympathy, did not suggest to you dark
Darwinian thoughts on the origin of
species?

etition that negroes_are_singer3, but I
have yet to hear the first of these noc
turnal song birds, for whom the nation
pplit and bled, warble in more than
three removes from the crow. Take
Sissieretta Jones, the prima donna so
prano assoluta of the race, a woman
whose voice is fairly educated, who
phrases with some skill, who has a
long range and no end of suppleness â
take Sissieretta and paint her white
and try her out somewhere seriously,
and do you think she would pass mus
ter? Never. It is not because Sissier-
Ptta is black â or I should say black and
blue, since she will sprinkle cornstarch
on that proud, onyx complexion of
hersâ that she la not a valuable vocal
ist: it is only because she is black that
6he should be encouraged to sing at
all. A few more Black Pattis might
eventually lift the hoodoo from the
coon voice.
â¢ * â¢
Anyway, it is an experience to hear
these troubadours sing the modern
coon songs, which were originally writ
ten in caricature of the peacocky
"cullud" personality, as cleverly as
white people sing them, and to know
that come of the very best of them
are written afid composed by Ernest
Hogan, a negro. Hogan wrote that
ragtime masterpiece, "All Coons Look
Alike to Me," and until you hear the
author sing it you will never know
the true essence of the song. He makes
drama of it, gives it with fervid decla
mation, subtle emphasis, grotesque se
riousness and all the essentials of coon
character. He Is really a colored Chev
alier, and it is pleasing to learn from
the newspapers that his diamonds are
properly authenticated, and that he is
rich. Let Hogan write the nation's
coon songs, and he need not care who
compiles the American symphonies. I
daresay, Dr. Dvorak would drop dead
of gout were he offered anything like
the net royalties of his coon contem
porary.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Another Hogan gem of latter day folk
song is "What you gwine to tell Massa
Peter when he meets you at the gate?"
The refrain is quite banally Caucasian,
but the song proper, which is written
In the recitation style, with long, urgent
pauses on the chord of the tonsorial
seventh, is tremendously impressive
and full of character to the last note.

If you can stand another laugh after
seeing the coons I would recommend
the Alcazar's "Charley's Aunt"âespe
cially Mr. Paulding as the "aunt." I
have seen this British farce several
times before without experiencing any
notable hilarity, but the other night at
the Alcazar it gave me tears of Joy.
The Alcazar's production never was
intended to be as funny as it is â it
couldn't have been. Much was hoped
for in Mr. Paulding, but no one could
have foretold the exorbitant delight
that was to be got from him in the
part of "Auntie." His clinging, emo
tional nature, his wild eye, and his
most soprano wail are given full vent
in the extravagances of this part, and,
although I never saw Mr. Paulding in
the role of Romeo, I will take oath that
this is the funniest thing of his life.
Several of my colleagues, I notice, are
advising Mr. Paulding to modify his
acting. Heed them not, Mr. Paulding;
modification would spell your ruin. If
you can continue Auntie at this gait
you etand a good chance of distancing

In New York the row over "The
Tree of Knowledge" continues, and
Daniel Frohman's Lyceum Theater
flourishes like a green bay. Aiming
point blank at William Winter, the se
verest denouncer of Mr. Carton' 3 play,
the Herald says that from the tone of
some of the tearful remarks that have
been dropped into the columns of the
newspapers in connection with the
"Tree of Knowledge," at the Lyceum,
it would seem that some old gentle
man who wandered into that play
house last Monday evening must have
been laboring under the impression
that Mr. Daniel Frohman is running a
Sunday school instead of a theater at
his Fourth Avenue house.
The Herald says that "The Tree of
Knowledge" is not intended for kin
dergarten consumption, and that the
stage has the same privilege as the
pulpit to discuss and lay bare social
errors and human frailties to which
men and women are prone.
Dignified Mr. Sethmar of the Times
writes that no one but a fool or a libi
dinous weakling ever called "Othello"
or "Measure for Measure" immoral,
and only such persons could seriously
regard Mr. Carton's play as immoral.
It treats, to be sure, not very frankly,
but with a strong sense of pictorial
effect and considerable emphasis, of fe
male depravity and the evil influence
of a wanton woman, and it is offered
as entertainment for old and young.
in ''inclusion, Mr. Sethmar says:
"1 have frequently expressed my
sympathy with those ministers of the
guspt>l who, holding earnestly that
man's sole duty on earth is to prepare
for the hereafter by repentance, hu
mility, self-denial and good deeds,
have cried out against the theater. I
warmly uphold the course of parents
who, desiring their children to know
as little as possible of sin and passion,
keep them away from the playhouse.
But this is apart from the Question.
Habitual theatergoers will find noth
ing indecent in Mr. Carton's play."
In London Ferdinand Gottsohalk du
plicated his American success in
"Never Again." He has just sailed to
rejoin the American company at New
Fork.
It. is declared that Fanny Davenport,
not certain as to the reception that
awaits her forthcoming production of
Sardou's "Thermidor," and desirous of
having another play less familiar than
the Sardou melodramas in which she
has been appearing for the past dozen
years, is making efforts to secure
"Madame Sans-Gene," now that Kath
ryn Kidder has announced her retire
ment from the stage.
Miss Gertrude Coghlan, the 18-year
old daughter of Charles Coghlan, plays
the part of Juliet to her father's Romeo
in the balcony scene which Mr. Cogh
lan has introduced in the fourth act
of his new adaptation of Dumas' play,
"Kean," to which he has given the title
"The Royal Box." A rather notewor
thy feat is that of a father acting Ro
meo to his own daughter's Juliet.

THE SA"N FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 1898.
'The Conquerors" from Sardou's
"La Haine," calls attention to the fact
that similar charges were made against
Sardou in reference to "La Haine,"
and that the French playwright re
marked in reply that "dramatic art
consists less in the choice of subject
than in the original treatment by which
the subject is rejuvenated, and that
there were never two dramatic works
of which criticism could s .y that they
sprang fully armed from their author's
brain and owed nothing to anybody
else."
That Ingenuous mixture of "The
Rivals," "The Love Chase," "Lon
don Assurance" and several other old
comedies which Eugene Presbrey was
pleased to call "A Virginia Co-urtship"
and an original play by himself when
William H. Crane, first produced it here
at the Baldwin, has been presented in
New York, with the following belated
statement on the programme:
"Evolving the scenes and incidents
around which 'A Virginia Courtship' is
built, the author has humbly tried to
follow the models and in some respects
has copied the personages made famil
iar in the old comedies, which are des
tined to live and be popular as long as
the English language is spoken."
Pinero's new comedy, "Trewlawney
of the Wells," has been favorably re
ceived at the Court Theater, London.
The action of the play is laid in the
early sixties, and it is notable that the
fashion in dress at that period has
been strictly adhered to. The story
tells of the infatuation of a young sprig
of the nobility for a popular actress of
the period, the former having proposed
and been accepted. He tells of the en
gagement to his noble father, who, hay-

ing been through the pace himself, does
not threaten him with disinheriting if
he persists in marrying the actress,
but instructs his son to bring his pros
pective, bride to spend a few weeks at
the paternal mansion. The actress con
sents to the agreement, and she is soon
an honored guest in the family circle
of her betrothed. For the first few days
the change of life and the convention
alities and usages of society prove a
novelty and surprise to her, but the
longing for her former companionship
and the more or less free-and-easy life,
with its unconventional manners, soon
makes itself manifest. She becomes
restless and irritable, and her fiance
seeks to fathom her trouble. She re
ally loves the young man and tries to
overcome her desire to return to her
old bohemian life. Do what she will,
she cannot overcome it, and at last
tells her lover that she could not be
happy in society with all its environ
ments, and the engagement is broken.
Miss Minnie Seligman-Cutting, after
an absence of three years from the

With every prospect of a brilliant
season the Bostonians open at the
Baldwin to-morrow night in their new
opera, "The Serenade," the book by
Harry B. Smith, the music by Victor
Herbert.
The story of "The Serenade," like
that of "Manon," is closely identified
with a certain melody, which, in vari
ous forms, recurs throughout the piece.
Dolores, a beautiful young lady of rank,
flirts with a handsome barytone of the
Royal opera, Alvarado. The Duke of
Santa Cruz, the guardian and fiance of
Dolores, is extremely jealous of her un
known admirer, whom he has deter
mined by means of a serenade. He has
Dolores taken to a castle in the moun
tains, but the barytone follows the
party and is ensconced in the household
disguised as a cook. A broken-down
tenor and a stage-struck tailor who
have been indulging in the self-same
serenade are captured by the Duke's
minions, and he, mistaking the tenor
for Alvarado, has him placed in dur
ance vile. The appearance of the tenor
in the tower frightens the natives and
an attack by brigands adds to the gen
eral excitement. Haunted by the sere
nade the Duke has his ward conveyed
to the convent <>f St. Ursula, which ad
joins the grounds of a monastery.
In the meantime, Alvarado, fleeing
from a former admirer, Yvonne, a dan
seuse, seeks refuge in the monastery,
and by a stratagem scales the walls
and discovers that Dolores is in the ad-
Joining garden. The Duke, appearing
on the scene again, is driven to a fren
zy by hearing the monks singing the
serenade, and with a detachment of the
guard breaks into the monastery, where
Dolores has retreated, disguised as a
boy. Many ludicrous complications
follow, ending, of course, in the happy
manner usual to comic opera.
Acts first and second are the same in
scene and depict a mountainous region
in Spain, the home of the "Royal Mad
rid Brigandage Association, Limited,"
with the haunted castle in the .fore
ground and the moonlit Sierras in the
background. There are glimpses of dark
ravines, the gurgle of swift, rushing
mountain streams, the bivouacs of
brigands and the harvpst festival of the
peasantry. Among the principal scenes
is that which shows the entrance of the
brigands, led by Mr. Ccrwles, the bri
gand chief Romero, who tells of their

TEACHERS AND SCHOOLS
OF CALIFORNIA
In a recent article on "Pictures for Our
Public Schools." M. G. Van Rensselaer of
New York speaks as follows: ' The ef
fort to increase the attractions and the
civilizing and educational influence of our
public school rooms by filling them with
good works of art has been prosecuted
along different lines in the various cities
and towns throughout the East. In New
â fork, with the hearty sanction of the
Board of Education, but with no money
save what came through private gifts,
the work of school decoration was begun
more than a year ago by the Public Ed
ucation Association. A special committee
on art was. appointed to attend to it. and
our chief and fundamental aim has been
to transform the barren, ugly, always
uninspiring and often actually repellent
public school room into an attractive
one which will cheer the eyes and spirits
of teachers and pupils; to make them
feel that they are not prisoners in dun
geons, but are at home in places planned
for their pleasure and benefit; to creato
rooms which will form happy and civil
ized contrasts, impossible of creation
elsewhere, to the squalid, dreary and
miserable surroundings, amid which a
very large proportion of our children
must live.
"The first step toward this end was
taken when the Superintendent of School
Buildings gladly promised that all school
interiors which required painting should
hereafter be colored in light, cheerful
tones, attractive in themselves, and fur
nishing good backgrounds for works of
art. The second step was to concentrate
our efforts in one school after another,
rather than to scatter pictures impar
tially through many schools.
"In selecting our works of art beauty is
our first concern. Nothing is approved
which is merely interesting by reason of
U^'e b S"rT m rily to bring; to bear the
refining, uplifting, inspiring influence of
beautiful lorms and. when Possible, of
beautiful colors, for we believe that this
influence is invaluable in the right devel
opment of young minds and spirits and
we know that a great majority of those
being trained in our public schools are. in
their own homes wholly outside its range.
To secure beauty we have chosen, or
course, many reproductions of the recog
nized masterpieces of painting, sculpture
and architecture. For VlÃlfV 181 f" ce iÂ°" e t frtÂ°t m
in a boys' grammar-school is devoted to
Greek and Roman art. and another to
Medieval and Renaissance art, including
reproductions of buildings, statues and
paintings. Another room is given to lit
erature, as illustrated by portraits and
by pictures of the dwellings of famous
writers, and of scenes which they have
immortalized. The large assembly room
is" decorated with patriotic subjectsâ
traits of famous men in history and pic
tures of noted buildings."
1 have quoted at length from the above
article because I think it contains many
valuable suggestions for decoration that
might with pleasure and profit be carried
out. not only in San Francisco, but in the
primary, grammar and high schools
throughout the State. Far be it from me
to imply 'that the schools of our own city
are -barren, ugly, always uninspiring,
for many of them contain home-like
rooms that abound in pictures and plants,
and gay blackboard drawings, which are
artistic according to the taste of the
teacher.
But that there is still room for vast im
provement along this line, especially in
the poorer quarters of the city, no one
who aas given the matter attention can
doubt. Here one often sees large apart
ments entirely bare or boasting only a
few sickly plants. Small wonder that
such rooms are dreary and uninviting to
pupils and teachers alike. Let the teach
ers then bring pictures, if only cheerful
colored prints, which they themselves
have gathered or begged from friends.

MASONIC.
It has been decided that the entertain

Chapter's meeting was attended by about

the local chapters. During the evening
two candidates were initiated, one of
them being Harry T. Creswell, City and
County Attorney. After the closing of the
chapter the members and visitors re
paired to the banquet room, which had j
been most tastefully decorated. There
was one long table with five points from
it and each of these was draped with one
of the colors of the central star of the
order. The floral adornments and the
piece de resistance in the shape of a large
cake were of the color of the drapery on
each of these points. The whole produced
a novel and pretty effect. At the previ
ous meeting there was a surprise in store
for the members, and that was the
worthy matron, Mrs. Val Schmidt, as
suming a double function, that of the
worthy patron as well as her own, some- |
thing "that has never before been done by

T. MORGAN MAC MAHAN
J. Morgan McMahon, A.8., S.E.S., was born in Sierra County, California,
In 1862, and graduated from the grammar schools at the age of fourteen. By
careful study, energy and perseverancce he has acquired an education that
places him in the front rank of teachers. Professor McMahon began his ca
reer as a teacher in Tuba County, but is now recognized as one of the
foremost educators of Tuolumne County.

filled with them.
Many principals and teachers may shake
their heads over t.iis plan, and while ad
mitting its theatrical excellence, deplore
that it cannot be carried out. But if it
has been successfully operated in t.ie East
our own State should not lag behind.
Moreover, in the Oakland High School
a notable beginning in this direction was
already been made. The progressive art
teacher. Miss Hernck, believes in keeping
abreast of the times, and has gathered
quite a gallery of beautiful art photo
graphs, which are not only pleasant and
inspiring to look upon, but are exceeding
ly useful to illustrate her lectures. And
she does not make the mistake of render
ing her collection a conglomerate mass of
invitation to exemplify the work before
the next session of the assembly.

THE RELIEF COMMITTEE.
The semi-annual banquet given last
Sunday by members of the relief com
mittee of the I. O. O. F. of San Francisco
in the Nevada restaurant was without
question the most enjoyable affair that
the members of this body have ever at
tended. The expense was not from the
relief fund, but was met by the indi
vidual members who attended. The menu
presented was an original one in the
matter of announcements. Louis Kiagon,
the treasurer, acted as toast master and
a right good one he made. During the
discussion of the eatables sweet vocal
and instrumental music was discoursed.
The following were the toasts offered:
"The Light of Other Days," reminiscent
of the work of past committees, Mr.
Watson; "The Rebekahs," Dr. Regens
burger; "The Widows and Orphans,"
James A. Wilson; "Fraternity." A. J.

for a speech, but his innate modesty got
the better of him and he declined. The
pleasant gathering was brought to a ilose
with the singing, "Should Auld Acquain
tances be Forgot?"
ANCIENT ORDER WORKMEN.
The various lodges of the order are at
this season electing representatives to the
Grand Lodge, which will meet next April.
The most important matter to come up
before that body will be the election of a
successor to David S. Hlrshberg, grand
recorder.
After an absence of a few weeks In the

states that the new classified assessment
plan has worked so well that this year

But the pictures of each periodâ the clas

HOME INFLUENCE AND ITS EFFECT
UPON THE SCHOOL.
I feel that I am writing upon a subject
of delicacy as well as importance and
profundity when I endeavor to express
my views on that which more than any
other factor molds the child's character
and paves the way for his future joy or
sorrow, success or failure in life. By
"home influence" I mean not alone the
credit, in view of the fact that it was
the first time he had been called upoi
to do the work. This council will re
ceive a visit on the 21st from the cabinet
officers.
Golden Gate Council will, on the even
ing of the 22d, give a patriotic entertain

NORMAL SCHOOL TO BE ERECTED IN SAN DIEGO.
The above is a faithful likeness of the new State NoT- ma l School Â»of San
Diego County, which will be built on University Heights, in the city of San
Diego at a cost of $100,000. The plans were designed by Hebbard & Gill
of San Diego, and were accepted by the Normal School Trustees last week.
Work is to begin by the middle of March, and $35,000 will be expended this
year. It is expected that with this sum the right wing and middle portion
of the building can be erected and the ground floor finished.
The building will be 400 feet in length, facing south, and fifty feet in
child's fireside surroundings, but also his
amusements and companionsâ in fact, tne
whole moral, intellectual and physical
culture which he receives outside the
school room. Some may argue that the
influence of home life has little or nothing
to do with work or behavior of the pupil
in the class room, but this is false logic,
promulgated by those who have never ex
perienced the hopes and disappointments
of the true teacher. ,
The observant instructor who taKes
charge of a new school is enabled within
a few days to point out every pupil whose
surroundings and home influence are en
nobling. For the moral development or
the child's mind parents should place in
his hands such works as will teach him
that the world expects him to make the
best and most practical use of those fac
ulties with which he has been endowed,
and that it is his duty to cultivate and
train all these capabilities of mind and
body so as to render the greatest possible
service, not only to himself, but to man
kind in general.
It should be impressed upon pupils and
parents how necessary is regular attend
ance at school, and the fact that not only
in the school, but in the way to or from
it, and on the playground, scholars are
subject to the orders of their teachers.
This is an important point.
It is the business of parents to see that
their boys do not loaf about the streets
and saloons after schools hours. Inquire
into their associations, make your home
surroundings pleasant, and be sure to
teach your children morals and manners,
if nothing else. .
I would also mention the importance of
visiting the school. Speaking from my
own experience and that of others, I can
Justly say that the enterprising teacher
will always welcome visitors to his
school: for there is no other one thing
in the whole course of school life so im
portant and encouraging to both teacher
and -pupils as this visiting of the school
by friends, parents and relatives. It stim
ulates the energies of the child; creates
a favorable spirit of competition, and fos
ters a desire to exefel by appealing to the
pride of the pupil. Therefore, visit the
school. Do not remain away, become as
Ignorant as possible of the work accom
plished by children and instructor, and
then cauterize the latter. Investigate the
school and learn what is being done; then
criticize if you will. Rpmembcr that even
if you have no children in attendance, or
if you are a trustee, to visit the school
is a duty you owe to yourself, to your
friends and to your country.

sion on the first and third Thursdays of
each month for the purpose of study
along the lines of school work. Principal
J. v . Young leads the primary teachers
and C. C. Hughes of Encinal School the
grammer grade. At the last session the
latter gentleman opened the discussion
on the subject of "Reading." Following
this Miss Wiebalk gave an excellent re

"Language Arts" has been chosen as a

NEW NORMAL SCHOOL IS BADLY NEEDED.
To the New State Normal School we are looking forward with lively
anticipation, if property manned and equipped it is sure to be a success,
and will aid much to the effectiveness of the educational system of Cali
fornia. One of the most pressing needs of the public schools has been and
now is a larger number of professionally trained teachers. In San Diego
County only about 20 per cent of the teachers are State Normal School
graduates, and these are largely drawn from Eastern normal schools. The
school at Los Angeles is 126 miles distant, and its capacity is hardly more
than sufficient to supply the needs of its imm:diate vicinity.
For a student tyxiy our climatic conditions are perfect. The school will
be convenient of access both by land and by water, and the cost of living is
moderate.
Three well-equipped normal schools may b? better than five that are
but poorly equipped, but with reasonable support from the State in ths
shape of appropriations the Normal School at San Diego can easily be the
peer of any now in operation. WALTER J. BAILEY,

GOLDEN GATE'S ANNIVERSARY/
The eleventh anniversary ball given by
Golden Gate Council of the Y. M. I. in
Native Sons' Hall last Tuesday was a
grand success in every way. The decora
tions were novel and artistic. They were
the idea of A. F. Schleicher and were
what he called "Sea Grotto." The com
ponent parts were tulle, fishnet and sil
ver tinsel. The centerpiece was in white
and nile green and represented water
dripping from the net, while on all sides
were representations of inhabitants of
the briny deep. The stage and balcony
were arranged in style to correspond
with the center and a circle of incandes
cent lights around the room shaded by
Spanish red tissue threw a subdued light
over the whole, producing a strange yet
pretty effect. In the hall there was gold
en grill work representing a golden gate,
and through this those who took part in
the grand march, some 'JOO couples, led by
Samuel Haskins and Miss Driscoll,
passed.

SAN BERNARDINO City anc! Coun
ty .ire so Inseparably connected
that an account, however brief, of
the one must necessarily include
a description of the other.
San Bernardino County, with an
area of 16,000 square miles, is the
it in the State. Sin- stands first in
â .versity of her climate, first in re
â â  Irrigation, the first In the cul
of tropical fruits ami the first in
miles of railroad within her borders. She
is larger than several of the New England
Sta'es put together, more extensive than
Rhode Island, Vermont, Connecticut, New
Hampshire or Delaware; is as large as
Maryland and has a greater area than
some of the European kingdoms.
In her climate. San Bernardino has her
greatest charm. It can be expressed in
two wordsâ bounty and beauty. There is
no Coast Range lying between the county
nnd the sea. as is the case with the other
Southern California counties, and the
breezes from the Pacific temper the chilly
winter as well as the glaring
heat of summer. This is truly the land
Of the sun an.l the sea. The altitude
varies from 500 to U.iml feet, and the trav
eler smoking a cool climate in summer
can find it here as readily as he can a
warm temperature in winter. The dis
tance from the ocean is sufficient to dispel
the moisture from the winds; yet they
are cool and refreshing. The ocean fog's
seldom reach this valley, and they are
â¢ -nse here than along the eoa-st. The
elevation, the latitude and the distance
from the seaâ only forty miles awayâ
[ne to f>rm a climatic condition that
is rarely excessive. This has often been
I the Italy of America, but the cli
mate more closely resembles that of
-â  :rn Spain or Portugal, or perhaps
Palestine. It is th^ most equable to be
found in America, containing less damp
ness than that of Florida. It is, especially
in the more arid portions, the proti
'.and for those suffering from pulmonary
.^ints. it is a spot where can be
found an equanimity of climate that is a
tnt delightâ an absence of the frigid
extremes of winter or the burning heat of
summer. Gentle, exhilarating breezes
golden, refreshing sunshine combine to
makf> this nature's own health resort.
The rains usually occur at a tempera
ture of about 50 degrees, and the wet
days correspond to the April days on
the Atlantic coast and in the Mississippi
Valley. The dry -winter days greatly re
semble pleasant October weather in the
Middle States or May days in New Eng
land. The mean temperature of San Ber
nardino Valley is much nearer that of the
coast than is generally supposed. From
S o'clock in the morning to 4 o'clock in
the afternoon the days are warmer than
they are in the coast counties, but from
10 p. m. to 5 a. m. the reverse is true, the
mountain breeze accomplishing for San
Bernardino at night what* the sea does
for the coast during the day. Blankets
are always comfortable on summer nights
after 10 o'clock, and the days that are
uncomfortably warm will not exceed
thirty during the year.

PRACTICAL JOKES
OF BRUTAL NOBLEMEN
WHILE the matinee girls are
discussing the brutality to
which Actor Ratcliffe sub
jected his English as well as
his Ame:ican wife, the courts
of Europe are agog over a we.i-authen
ticated story that before the final sep
aration of the young Grand Duke and
Grand Duchess of Hesre, a fortnight
ago, the Grand Duke laid violent hands
on his beautiful and high-spirited con
sort; first of aU using his fists upon
her and ultimately pitching her by
force out of the room in which the cli
max of their matrimonial bickerings
took place.
Both are the grandchildren of Queen
Victoria â the Grand Duke being the
only surviving son of Princess Alice of
Great Britain, while the Grand Duchess
is the offspring of the Queen's sailor
son, Duke Alfred of Edinburgh and Co
burg. There is no doubt that they were
married too young, and their separa
tion Is distinguished from all other dis
solutions of royal marriages by the fact
that for once it has not been caused,
either directly or indirectly, by any in
fraction of the seventh commandment.
In fact, the trouble origin Ued entirely
with the Grand Duke's tendency to
practical joking, a tendency which is
quite frequent among European royal
ty, but which, in the case of the young
ruler of Hesse, is carried to an extrav-
agant degree.
His practical Jokes differ from those
of his uncle, the Prince of Wales. They
resemble those of his first cousin, the
Kaiser, in that they partake of the na
ture of rough horse-play and coarse
ness. Moreover, the Grand Duke has
been, ever since he married, in the
habit of selecting his beautiful young
wife a 8 the principal butt of his harsh
Jokes. These have already, in the spring
of last year, led to her suddenly leaving
Darmstadt and seeking refuge with her
eldest sister, the Crown Princess of
Roumanla, at Bucharest.
In the middle of a ball at the palace
at Darmstadt the electric lights were
suddenly extinguished, whereupon the
young Grand Duke and several of his
associates, who had previously provid
ed themselves with squirt guns, shot
water at the bare necks and shoulders
of the ladles present, incidentally hug
ging them whenever they got the
chance.
The v-rand Duchese was drenched,
besides being embraced roughly by at
least two men who were not her hus
band. Frantic at the indignity to which
both she and her guests had been sub
jected, she left Darmstadt, accom
panied only by her maid, early the fol
lowing morning. No one knew what
had become of her until thirty-six
hours later a telegram from Bucharest
announced her arrival there. It was
only with the utmost difficulty that she
'.vas persuaded to return to her husband
and child, and then only on the solemn
promise of her husband that he would j
abstain from practical joking at her i
expense.
Since her return matters have gone
from bad to worse. There has been
more practical joking, and,- moreover,
the highly cultivated and exceedingly
clever Grand Duchess, who has been
brought up in England and is essential
ly an English girl, has strongly resented
the very anti-British attitude which her
husband has taken up in connection
with the recent ill feeling in Germany
against Great Britain.
The Grand Duke was never tired of
abusing the English policy, the English
court, and, indeed, everything that ppr
tains to Great Britain, entirely oblivi
ous of the fact that both his father
and himself have been dependent upon
the bounty of Queen Victoria. The
venerable sovereign has not only dow
ered his sisters and provided him with
a large annuity, but she actually pays
most of the expenses of the court, the
Grand Duke being the poorest Prince
In Germany.
It may be added that the Grand
Duke as a boy had the misfortune to
kill his younger brother. He was chas
ing him through the rooms of the ducal
palace and upon catching up with him
jcave him a push. The blow carried the
.awarded to Juan Bandini. The rancho
ban Bernardino, which gave name to the
county and city, â¢ was' granted to Jose
-Maria Lugo, Jose del Carmen Lugo, Vi
cente Lugo and Diego Sepulveda in 1842.
by Juan B. Alvarado, Constitutional Gov
ernor of the Department of California,
and judicial possession was given the
same year by Dominguez, first Judge of
the Peace in the District of Los Angeles.
Uie rancho contained nine leagues, or
3. .700 acres. This magnificent estate was
sold by the original proprietors February
26, is Amasa Lyman and C. C. Rich,
for Â£77,500. Lyman and Rich were two
ol the original "quorum of twelve" sent
out as leaders of a party of 500 Mormons
by Brigham Young from Salt Lake City
to colonize San Bernardino. A party
had come from Salt Lake two years pre
vious and attempted to purchase the Chino
rancho. now a magnificent beet-sugar
farm, but were unsuccessful. The Mor
mons first settled on Lytle Creek and built
a small village, which was moved to the
site of the present city when the Apostles
made the purchase. â  'â  â¢
The county was separated from Los
Angeles April 26. 1553, by act of the Leg- !
islature, when Isaac Williams, David :
Seely, H. G. Sherwood and John Brown j
wore appointed Commissioners to locate
the town and lay out the farms and town
lots. The county boundaries were not !
properly defined until April 2. 1557. The |
city was incorporated by act or the Legis- !
lature April 13. 1864. It then had a popu- i
lation of .-'.bout 2000 and was in a very |
flourishing condition. It was the great
center of travel and trade for Arizona, !
Utah. Idaho and Montana, and directly '<
on the route to the sea. Fort Yuma, Tuc- i
son, Fort Mojave, Preseott and Santa Fe i
were al! tributary to San Bernardino. I
The Legislature passed an act May 18. i
1564. repealing the first charter, provided i
the act was ratified by the people, which !
they did with unanimity.
Brigham Young, fearing a conflict of
arms with the United States Government i
in I>>s7 called all his cohorts into Salt !
Lake City, and a large portion of the pop- |
illation of i?an Bernardino obeyed the
summons and sold their property to the !
gentiles for small sums. San Bernardino
was then no longer a Mormon city, al- i
though two yean later a number of the
original colonists returned, having repu I
diated Brigham Young and selected
young Joseph Smith as their leader. But i
in the meanwhile gentiles had been com- i
Ing to San Bernardino, and although the i
imprint of the Mormons is still apparent,
they never again obtained control of the
corporation.
The resources of San Bernardino Coun- j
ty are of the most varied character, com
prising everything requisite to the build- !
ing up of a wealthy community, while its j
location in the great highways of -travel I
gives it a prominence over many of the
"Seven Sisters."
TIMBERâ In the mountains north of
the city is an inexhaustible supply of the !
best timber to be found, consisting of i
pine, black and white oak, cedar and ma- j
hogany.

MINERALS â The precious metals I

Placer gold was found on Lytle Creek in
I the early days and has been worked for j
i years. The same may be said of Hoi- I
i comb Valley. Along- the Mojave River ;
for forty miles and in the hills north of i
, the city gold-bearing quartz is found in
every direction. The county contains
among other camps the Victor, which has
been pronounced during the past week i
to equal the famed Cripple Creek of Colo- !
rado. The Mountain district, Ruby dis
trict and Morongo have mines that arc
being worked to advantage, as have Pi

P? f 'f Â°1c1 c of the most Promising dis
tricts in the county, and contains many
very rich mines. It has been recently
demonstrated that many rich veins of
gold, silver and lead lie in the desert
wastes that have heretofore been over
looked by prospectors, but which are
readily accessible and easily worked The '
future of gold mining in San Bernardino ]
is full of promise. The ahsence of large !
streams has proved detrimental to pla
cer mining, most of the gold being in
quartz and requiring expensive ma
; ohinery to develop it. This is fast being
introduced, and it is easy to predict that
within a few years San Bernardino Coun
ty will become one of the greatest gold
i ?HÂ° dU , C i ng * ectlons ln the world. Among
! the other flourishing mining districts in
the county may be mentioned Johannes
.Â£ rs \ 5, wen . t >'- six milfi s from Kramer on
the Atlantic and Pacific railroad and
thirty miles from Mojave on the South
; crn Pacific. The Lone Star, on the ex
treme north, is another district rich in
i w f'v ar *P evln c district, on the Atlantic
I and Pac fie off from Barstow, contains
! many valuable mines. Calico district and
I Alford have many good mines. Soda,

and the Providence Mountain districts
are all coming into prominence and con
tain great possibilities. Sacramento dis
trict, west of the Needles, Lava Bed Dry
Lake and Black Hawk contain mines
that pan out well. Oro Grande district
is the largest in the county, and is on the
Santa Fe route on the Mojave Desert.
The mineral wealth of the county does
not consist of gold alone. Silver, copper
lead, zinc, iron, manganese, borax salt
soda, baryta, gypsum, sulphur and asbes
tos are found in abundance.
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS - The
agricultural products of San Ber
nardino are many and varied. Corn
wheat, barley, rye, buckwheat, oats
potatoes, sorghum and tobacco flourish
1 here is no place in the world
where ailalfa can be grown to bet
ter advantage. Twenty tons can be grown
i to the acre, making it a most profitable
crop. Barley is perhaps the principal
grain crop, being more profitable than
wheat, more productive than oats, and is
i the chief horsefeed.
'â¢ LIVESTOCKâ The climate is peculiarly
; fitted for developing neat cattle and fine
. horses. The Jersey. Holstein and short
1 horn are fast supplanting less favored
cattle.
! CITRUS FRUITS-San Bernardino is the
home of the orange. So well have the
I growers succeeded in producing fine fruit
i that the brands from this county always
j bring the highest prices in the' Eastern
I markets. The district is rarely visited by
trost. and the water supply is abundant
The acreage of orange and lemon orch
ards in the county is over 20,000 acres and '
the oranges are largely of the navel I
variety. The crop for the eountv this '
season is placed at 35,000 carloads or i
1.175.000 boxes. Two medals from the South
ern California Fair, one from the World's I
Fair at Chicago and one from the Atlanta i
Exposition were won by San Bernardino !
orange-growers. " !
Ansen Van Luven planted the first
orange trees In San Bernardino County. I
near the old Mission, in 1856. One tree is I
still living and bearing fruit.
DECIDUOUS TREESâ There is SOOO
acres in the county planted to deciduous
trees, including peach, apricot, prune,
pear, fig, walnut, apple, cherry and al
mond.
The vine thrives as well here as in
other parts of the State. The acreage is
GOOO, two-thirds of which is raisin grapes,
one-fourth wine grapes and a small per
centage of table, grapes.
WATERâ The majestic snow-clad peaks
that stand like grim sentinels above im
perial San Bernardino uirnish an abun
dant supply of water for all purposes,
including irrigation and electric power.
The principal basin for this water supply
from the mountains is Bear Valley Lake,
belonging to what is known as the Bear
Valley irrigation system. The lake is on
the headwaters of Bear Creek and has
a water shed of over fifty square miles.
From October to May it is not necessary
to draw on the lake for water, the over- i
flow being sufficient. By storing this !
overflow the water supply of San Ber
nardino could be easily doubled.
FOREST RESK.CVES-San Bernardino
County has within her borders two '
United States forest reservations, com
prising about 1,500,000 acres. These re- j
serves lie between the desert and the
city and consist of large quantities of I
valuable timber.
SUMMER RESORTSâ No part of the ;
country can boast of more charming sum
mer resorts than can this county. Squir
rel Inn. Fredalba Park, Seven Oaks. Bluff
Lake and Arrowhead are all easily acces
sible and popular resorts.
THE IMPERIAL* ClTYâ lmperial San
Bernardino, the city of homes, of schools
and of churches is the third in size of
the cities of Southern California and is
situated on the southern slope of the
San Bernardino Mountains, at a height
of 1075 feet above the sea. Seven square
miles are included in the corporate area
and the population Is 11,000. San Bernar
dino is the central point of supply for
the whole county and large sections of
the mining districts of other counties and
draws a considerable trade from Southern
Nevada, Arizona and New Mexico. The
city was originally laid out one miie
square by the pioneers from Utah, who
had th<> wisdom and good taste to survey
wide, straight streets and line them with
shade trees. The same wise plan has been
kept up in the numerous additions that
have been made to the city, and the
wide, shady streets, splendidly paved, af
ford charming walks and drives, that ex
cite the admiration of all visitors. Pure
artesian water flows from about six hun
dred wells of from two to seven inches in
diameter in the city and immediate vi
cinity. These wells extend over an area
of thirty square miles, the ordinary depth
bfing 160 feet. The city is noted for its
beautiful, commodious and costly build
ings, the public buildings as well as the
residences being very handsome. The
county courthouse, situated on Court and
i E streets, is the finest structure of Its
i kind in Southern California and equals I
any in the State. It is not yet completed ;
! and has already cost over $200,000. It was
; built without an issue of bonds and no |
| debt will be left for future generations. !
|It is a massive structure of Mentone I
â  stone with heavy columns of ColtOti mar- j
Me at every entrance. The interior is ,
finished with San Bernardino M6untain i
Pino.
The city has a splendid public library of I
4000 volumes, maintained in a modern ;
two-story brick building on Fourth street. '<
i It has over 200Q patrons and issues ltioo
j books each month. MYs. Ella Lawson is
I librarian, and the Library Board is com- !
posed. of Judge F. W. Gregg (president).
|E. E. Katz (clerk), John Anderson,
H. L. Drew and D. A. Moulton.
SCHOOLSâ Few if any cities In Amer
ica of equal population offer better edu
cational advantages that San Bernardino.
| The schools are the pride of the city. The j
! system is a splendid one. The buildings, !
â  the appliances and the methods of In- [
! etructlon are in every sense up to date*
j In its earlier history the city wisely pro-
I vided grounds for all its school buildings,
both for those then in use and those that
have beon subsequently erected, and
these grounds are now a permanent part
of the property of the municipality. The
schools of the city are conducted in
eleven different buildings â four wooden
and seven of brickâ which, with one ex
ception, have been erected during the
past decade. These, with their grounds,
represent a value of over $250,000. During
the present year forty-two teachers are
employed, including a special teacher in
drawing and music, and 1600 pupils are
enrolled.
The High School, with Its library, ap
paratus and grounds, is valued at $110,000.
It enrolls 225 students and employs the
labor of four men and two women in ad
dition to part of the work of the City
Superintendent, Professor N. A. Richard
son, and also of the special teacher in
drawing and music. It provides a four
year course in Eliglish, Latin, German,
history, mathematics, science and phy
sical culture, and offers as elective all
essentials to a good business course. Its
laboratories â biological, chemical and
physicalâ are as well equipped as any In
the State, excepting those at the uni
versities. The High School is fully ac
credited at the State University and at
Stanford and is well represented in these
educational centers. Since 1889 30 per cent
of its graduates have attended higher in
stitutions of learning. During the last
three years it has graduated eighty-three
pupils. An excellent system of schools is
maintained throughout the county. This
embraces three high schools, forty-six
grammar schools and eighty-four primary
schools. The value of the school property
in the county is nearly $r>oo,ooo and the
current school expenses for the last year
were $125,000. Miss Margaret M. Mogeau
is the efficient /Superintendent of the
Schools and is the first lady in the county
who was elected to office by vote..
There is an excellent private school in
the city kept by the Sisters of Mary, in
a large and well-arranged . building,
owned by the Catholic church, under the
direction of Father Cabaleria.
CHURCHESâ AII the leading denomina
tions have churches in the city and most^
of them have handsome church edifices/
which range in cost from $1000 to $30,000.
The churches which have buildings are:
Baptist. Rev. A. J. Frost. D.D., pastor;
Presbyterian. Rev. R. B. Taylor, pastor;
First Methodist Episcopal, Rev. F. V.
Fisher, pastor; St. Paul's M. E. South,
Rev. J. W. Bain, D.D., pastor; Congrega
tional, Rev. J. G. Rollins, pastor; St.
John's Episcopal, Rev. J. H. D. Brown,
pastor; Christian, Rev. J. C. McÃeynolds,
pastor; Catholic. Rev. A. Cabaleria,
parish priest; Latter-day Saints and
Christian Scientists. The county has
fifty-one church organizations and thirty
five church buildings.
NERVOUS TRIALS
OF AN UNDERSTUDY.
Do you know where the great actors
and actresses of the future will come
from?
From the ranks of the understudies.
And where do the understudies come
from?
San Bernardino has four banks, fur
nishing ample facilities, and all of them
! in excellent condition and in handsomo
j quarters. They are the Farmers' Ex
change Bank, the San Bernardino Na
tional Bank, the Bank of San Bernar
dino and a savings bank. The soundness
of these institutions has never been ques
i tioned.
NEWSPAPERS â The newspapers of
San Bernardino arc not surpassed by
any city of this size in the country. They
: are three in number, each of them pub
; lishinp daily and weekly editions, which
are well patronized. They are the Free
Press (independent), H. C. Warner,
owner and editor, and J. W. Headen city
editor; the Times-Index (Republican), F.
W. Richardson, publisher and editor, and
C. A. Whitmore, city editor; the Sun (Re
publican), R. C. Harbison, editor and
publisher, and Kendall Holt, city editor.
There are thirteen other papers published
in the county.
HOTELSâ The city is well supplied with
hotelsâ the New St. Charles, the Stewart
and the Southern, besides a number of
other smaller hotels and apartment
houses. The restaurants of the city are
considered good.
CITY GOVERNMENTâ The city gov
ernment is composed at present of the
Board of Trusteesâ J. B. Frith (presi
dent), C. L. Thomas, Monroe Stewart, J.
A. Wees and M. A. Pace; Recorder, J. D.
Faris; Attorney, Colonel C. C. Haskell;
Marshal, William B. Reeves; Clerk. Le
gare Allen; Treasurer, Marion Aldredge;
Assessor, Jeff McElwain.
RAILROAD FACILITIESâ The city is
well provided with railway lines, being
situated on both the great transcontinent
al routes. It also has connection by rail
with Redlands, Riverside., Colton and
Highlands. There are, all told, sixty ar
rivals and departures of trains each day.
The county contains 415 miles of standard
gauge railroad, 128 miles of motor line
and 15 miles of streetcar lines. The city
is situated on the famous kite-shaped
track of the Santa Fe route.
The machine-shops of the Santa Fe
system are located here. They constantly
employ a large number of skilled mechan
ic*. The monthly payroll of these shops
averages $55,000, nearly all, of which is ex
pended in the city. These shops and the
railroads combine to make this a railroad
town in a measure.
OTHER INDUSTRIESâ SeveraI cream
eries are operated in the city and vicinity,
with a capacity of 11,000 pounds of milk
daily.
The stores and business houses of the
city are large, and are usually construct
ed of brick or stone. They embrace all
lines of mercantile pursuits. The city
enjoys considerable wholesale trade with
the neighboring towns, and goods are oc
casionally shipped to Arizona and New
Mexico.
The manufacture of flour has lately
been receiving considerable attention. The
San Bernardino Roller Flour Mills (J. V.
Suman, proprietor) have recently been
erected in the heart of the city, and are
run constantly at a capacity of seventy
barrels of flour per day. Only Home
grown wheat is used, which is found to
produce a finer grade of flour than the
northern-grown grain. The motive power
is water.
The city is well lighted by the San Ber
nardino Electric Light and Power Com
pany, which has a ten-year contract for
public illumination. There is also a gas
company and another electric light com
pany in actual working existence, besides
several in embryo. The electricity is gen
erated by waterpower.
The Southern Hospital for the Insane is
in San Bernardino County, five miles from
the city limits, and is a lofty pile of
buildings, beautifully located on the sun
ny slopes of the San Bernardino Range,
surrounded by groves -of oranges and
tropical plants, and directly under the
snow-capped mountains. The view from
this spot is sublime. J. W. HEADEN.
We are a set of aspiring young peo
ple who are studying for the stage on
our own account, and we prefer the
practical lessons of the theater to the
theoretical ones of the dramatic
schools. Of course, there are under
studies and understudies â some mere
makeshifts, to whom many opportuni
ties come, but upon whom nobody's
mantle ever falls. The genuine under
studies are those who have the divine
fire in them and simply wait modestly
but eagerly for their chance.
The accidents that give underftudies
a chance to move suddenly to the front
happen every day. Girls jump from the
chorus to leading roles in comic opera.
The boy who came on the stage with
a card-tray last year and pompously
announced "Mr. Blinkinsquigg McGuin
ness" plays a good part this year. Even
the property man who holds aside the
curtain through which Rose Coghlan
passes when, as Lady Janet Maclin
tork, she arrives at the Duke of Shet
land's ball â yes, even he, through op
portunity, may develop into a farce
comedy star in a few years.
And I, who watch Mies Coghlan night
after night from my place in the ball
room â who knows but some unseen
chance is near for me, her understudy?
How we understudies long for that
chance, yet how we fear it! Every
night we stand in the wings, watching
each expression and movement of those
on the stage. Sometimes our imagina
tion carries us beyond the present time.
The great, the looked-for night has
come. We are on the stage saying our
lines, The loud burst of applause, the
curtain-call, is for us. We have suc
ceeded.
Then the property man calls
"Strike!" the stage hands begin to
change the scene and we are hustled
from our snug retreat. We realize that
we must hurry and dress or be late
for the next act. As we mount the
stage to our dressing-room we comfort
ourselves by saying, "Well, maybe it
will be to-morrow night; I will be even
better prepared then."
A principal generally delights in tell
ing her understudy that she is very ill,
almost too ill to appear, and then
watching the effect.
Sometimes, quite often In fact, she
will come to the theater blooming with
health, yet secretly inform her under
study that she felt so badly all day
that it was only with the greatest
difficulty she managed to report for the
matinee. "And, my dear child," she
will add, "be prepared to go in my
place this evening."
And then night comes. You go with
out your dinner; you remain at the
theater between the matinee and even
ing performance; you spend every mo
ment of your time getting on a good
make-up; you nervously say your lines
and cues over and over. You pray for
success; you think of the glories of to
morrow, following this evening's work.
You are so happy. Of course, you are
saying that Miss is ill, and you sin-.
cerely hope she will be well â to-mor
row!
You even make up your mind to send
her a lovely bunch of roses. You think
she is one of the sweetest women you
ever met. And then, just as the half
hour is called, you hear her merry
laugh, and you go tn her dressing-room,
all the while your heart beating rapid
ly, and you softly ask her "how she
feels." She will reply that her head
ache is entirely cured and she never
felt so well in her life.
And I am not the only understudy
who hfs had worries and trials.

HERE ARE SOME QUITE CLEVER TRICES WITH MATCHES
THOUSANDS of works on magic
and second sight tricks which only
adepts could master have been pro
duced, but the most novel recent
contribution to literature of this
nature is that of a Frenchman
named Traumele. This man has spent a
lifetime conceiving tricks to be per
formed with ordinary household matches.
In his work more than a thousand tricka
are illustrated, with full Instructions how
to perform them. They range from the
construction of animated figures to the
building of temples of intricate archi
tecture. AH are produced by the clever
use of that commonest and cheapest of
all household necessaries, the wooden
match.
One of the simplest tricks demonstrates
the old story of the marooned negro, the
sailor-captors and the negro, all being
represented by matches. There are nine
teen sailors, making twenty men. repre
sented by twenty matches all told. It is
decided to kill one man. and the marooned
negro is given his choice of position in
line. He is represented by a reversed
match. Count is to be made in rotation,
and each seventh man is to go free. The
last man left is to die.
Where must the count begin bo that
the negro captive will be the victim?
The solution is simple. Let him select
any position, and then begin the count so
that he will be No. 3 at the outset and
his white captors will be safe. The re
versed match alone will be in position at
the conclusion. Figure A shows one of

passing erf Adolph Sutro de-
y 7 m serves something more than a
f*\ hare announcement of the fact
V j and a memorandum of his life
work.
It fell to his lot to illus
trate the period in -which he lived.
Half a century ago he was one of the
\ youths who cut loose from
;â  and home to seek his fortune
in a land where success meant riches,
and failure hardship, privation, and
>!y death. There was no reason
why he should wander afield. His
father was a prosperous manufacturer
at Aix La Chapelle. in Rhenish Prus-
B he himself, at is. was foreman of
the factory. He was industrious and
smart. A life of plodding industry
pretty certain to insure him an
ample sufficiency in his old age. Yet
he took ship for the region of gold,
where his instinct told him that mind
and energy would tell. The boy want
ed to stand on his own feet.
In I^4<t. at the age of If*, he landed
In San Francisco and opened a cigar
store. It prospered. But he had not
come t<i California to live on the profits
of retail trade. Stories of wonderful
Ties in Nevada were
buzzing in the air. He turned his
stock into money, mounted a pack
horse and rode to Washoe, where ore
worth (4500 to the ton, one-third gold
and two-thirds silver, was being dug
:' shallow holes. A camp had
founded at the base of Mount
Davidson and a town which took the
name of Virginia City. Therein young
Butro pitched his tent, and by dicker
n mining locations and operating
â  rchandise he siron became, young
as he was, one of the most substantial
citizens in the place. Far-sighted ob
servers remarked that that young Ger
man would get there. Indeed, in the
Jargon of the camp, he soon had money
to burn.
He was a man in whose hands
money was never idle, nor time thrown
away. In 1861. long before the discov-
cry of the great bonanzas, he set up
a quartz mill on the Carson River, and
he grew richer day by. day. But even
then he realized that the great depth
of the shafts- on the Omstock lode,
and the intense heat prevailing on the
lower lev< Is, would prove a bar to suc
cessful mining unless the grade of the
ore proved higher than could reasona
bly be expected. It cost more to hoist
the ore and pump the mines than ordi
nary ore was worth. A plan must be
devised to drain the lode into the Car
son River, if it was to be a permanent
Bource of profit. He spent anxic.-us
and sleepless nights poring over
the problem, and at last he solved it.

Gould & Curry, Savage, Ophir, Hale
& Norcross and Chollar were being ex
ploited and the rage for deeper work
ings was maddening. The only man who
had a practical plan for deep mining
was Sutro. He proposed to drive ?
tunnel from a point in the flank of
Mount Davidson, 20,485 feet from the
Savage shaft, so as to strike that shaft
at a point 1645 feet below the surface of
the earth. Such a tunnel would not
only drain the Savage workings, but
being connected by lateral drifts with
the works of the other mines would
drain them all and would serve as a
horizontal outlet for the ore, which
would save the cost of perpendicular
hoisting. The plan was loudly applaud
ed 'by Ralston, Sharon, Mills and the
Bank of California. A tunnel company
was formed, in ISG4, an act of incor
poration obtained from the Legislature
of Nevada in 1865, and a bargain
closed with the mining companies for
the payment of a royalty to the tunnel
company of $2 a ton on all the ore ex
tracted after the opening of the tunnel.
Thus far all was plain sailing and
Sutro was the king of the hour.
But in 1866 and 1867, when he went
round, hat in hind, to men of money
for funds for the enterprise a chill had
come over the atmosphere. Like, all
novelties the tunnel attracted criticism.
Engineers who could not bear the
thought of being beaten at their own
business by a German tobacconist
pooh-poohed the scheme. Practical men
called the tunnel Sutro's coyote hole.
A change had come over the spirit of
Sharon, Ralston and the Bank â¢ f Cali
fornia. The very people who had been
most enthusiastic in support of the en
terprise now pronounced it impracti
cable. It is in human nature tc de
nounce new improvements as frauds.
Everybody flung bis little stone at
Sutro and said he was mad.
But the fiber of the man's soul was
such that opposition and calumny only
erved him to more energetic work. He
at all his own money. and the money
of his personal friends in the tunnel
treasury- lie stumped the State on be
half of his scheme, pouring out a del
uge of oratory in his broken English,
spoken with his Teutonic accent. Ami
though he could not make converts in
Montgomery or California ptreeta he
wen over the working miners In Ne
vada and they, took $50,000 of his stock.
He got some more in the Eist. With
this start he broke ground for his tun
nel on October 19, 1869. With his plans
iii Ills hand he crossed over to England
and there he secured from the .Met Uil
montf and" others' subscriptions- enough
to if? sure the completion of the bore,
though not on the scale he had origin
a<iy ir.if uded. :''-' : --^.':l
But the undertaking was tremen
dously difficult. He had 20,485 feet to
bore, and at first his drills could not
make over V"J feet a month,' and even
at last their extreme rate of progress
was not over 10 feet a day. Three years
after the work began the temperature
at the end of th- winkings was 72 de
grees Fahrenheit; next year it ros^ to B3
degrees; in 1576, to 90 degrees; in 1878, to
109 degrees. Man cannot labor long in
such heat. The miners fell fainting at
the drills, anil had to be carried out
senseless into the open air. The mules
refused to approach the car?. All the
â %-hile Sutro himself, shirtless and gasp
ing, begrimed with dirt and smoke, and

For IÂ«S6 were 653, 229.599 26
A gain of $67,559,543 65
The "apparent gain Is principally, due to the
increase In the values of wheat over that of
the preceding year, combined with a compari
son against clearings, a portion of. which were
produced during a period of Dusiness depres
sion that prevailed after the announcement Id
July, 1886, that the National Democratic party
had declared for the unlimited free coinage of
silver In their platform for the Presidential
campaign.

and their outflow of water was counted

of the enterprise had nearly reached
$5,000,000. Once more Sutro was the

accept as collateral for the smallest

be property. He was as shrewd as he
was enterprising. He had passed

old. The loss of his mental fac

of rears, combined with the ef

disappointment and despair. He did

When his name was in every man's

the millions which would fall into the

stock, he quickly sold out his shares
and placed the proceeds in banks of
undoubted solidity.
That was twenty years ago, and Mr.
Sutro was in the full vigor of man-,

What was he to do with the millions
which had been won after so desperate
a struggle? Rest and pleasure, soft
Sicilian days, and gay Parisian joys
would have commended themselves to
many men. Repose was ndt in Sutro's
instincts. His mind could not be idle.

from the heart of the city to the ocean
beach. Adjoining the Sutro Baths, he
began the collection of objects of art,
pictures, sculptures, tapestries and
curios for the equipment of a museum.
But the object which was nearest his
heart was the foundation of a library
which, while it should be useful "for
citizens generally, should be especially
attractive to scholars and should help
develop the higher thought and work
of the Pacific Coast. For the acquisi
tion of this library he visited Europe
and purchased as a nucleus the most
valuable works in the Sunderland Li
brary, the library of the Duke of Ham
ilton, that of the monastery of Bux
heim, and that .of the Duke of Dahl
berg, which were sold at auction at
the time. From the Royal State Li
brary at Munich, which had absorbed
the collections of the confiscated mon
asteries of Bavaria, he bought over
4000 incunabula, probably the best col
lection in existence. When he left Eu
rope he intrusted the completion of the
work to learned bibliophiles, who were
instructed to spare no expense to ac
quire rare and valuable works: they
have fulfilled their task admirably.
Of the collection as it stands. An
drew T. White, now Embassador to
Berlin, has said: "With considerable
acquaintance among the libraries of
the United States, I should rank this
one already among the first four in
value. â¦ * * Every branch of
science, literature and art is well rep
resented. Many of the works are of
the costliest. Among them are num
bers of rare illuminated maunscripts,
a very large collection of early printed
works, especially of the Reformation
and early renaissance periods, with
over 30.000 volumes dating from the
Civil wars, and Cromwellian period in
England. Especially curious from a
historical point of view is a collection
which Mr. Sutro has made in Mexico,
which will prove a mine for the coming
investigator of Spanish-American civ
ilization. There is also. a very large
mass of Hebrew manuscripts which
will evidently some day reward investi
gators in Semitic history and litera
ture."
Professor Burr of Cornell wrote:
"The Sutro Library is, I think, beyond
all comparison the best collection in
America, both as to numbers and as to
the quality of the books of the fifteenth
century, and I gravely doubt if it has
any rival this side of the Atlantic for
its literature of the sixteenth century.
In travels 6f every age, in church his
tory, canon law and theology, in the
history of all the sciences, especially
the natural sciences, in curios of many
sorts, its shelves are a golconda of
treasures."
The number of hooks in the library,
exclusive of manuscripts, is at present
about 230,000. Among them are the Par
liamentary documents and proceedings
which Macaulay used in writing his
history; the laws of England as com
piled by Lord Cairns, and a vast as
semblage of medical, botanical, geologi
cal, astronomical, mathematical and
other scientific collections; among the
manuscripts are many on parchment in
the Hebrew, Greek, Latin and Arabian
tongues.
From the libraries which had be
longed to the German monasteries, and
which were sold when the properties of
those institutions were dispersed, Mr.
Sutro acquired editions of early works
which are now so rare as to be almost
priceless. Such are books printed by
Fust of Mainz, by Aldus of Venice, by

Of the Bible, the library contains 400
editions, including the "Vinegar" Bible
and the "Breeches" Bible of Geneva, of
which only a few copies are known to
exist. Another exceedingly rare publi
cation is a complete set of the Paris
Moniteur. When San Francisco be
comes a seat of letters and original
research, the existence of this library
will draw scholars to the coast from all
parts of the country. It was the joy
and delight of Mr. Sutro's old age. He
was never tired of talking about it, and
of longing for the time when he could
throw it open to the public, and, with
his kindly face and beaming eye, wel
come the scholar to its alcoves to pro
secute the studies that would enable
the Pacific Coast to contribute its mite
to the sum of human knowledge.
The mistake of Mr. Sutro's life was
permitting himself to be elected Mayor
of the city. He was not equipped with
the peculiar gifts which fit a man for
municipal administration, nor was his
temper calm and serene enough to en
dure the wearing friction of office. For
nearly twenty years he had been suc
cessful in everything he tried; he was
intolerant of opposition and irascible
when he was thwarted. The good
humored ridicule which he drew on
himself by his assaults on the octopus
diverted public attention from his no
ble qualities and blinded people to his
lofty merits. It exposed him to being
called a demagogue by politicians of
small caliber. It led people who were
quite incapable of understanding him
to sneer at his noble schemes of public
benevolence. If it had been his good
fortune to preserve his intellectual
powers a few years longer San Fran
cisco would have owed to his liberality
university buildings that would have
been an honor to the State, the finest
library on this side of the rivers, a mu
seum which in itself would have at
tracted visitors to California from all
parts of the world, a pleasure resort
which is without a rival
Other men besides he have expend
ed their millions in erecting monu
ments which will preserve their names
from oblivion, and, though their aim
was rather personal gain than public
service, they are still fairly entitled to
gratitude because in promoting their
own ends they ministered to the pros
perity of the people at large. Sutro,
from the time he became a millionaire
and the increase of his wealth became
a matter of secondary importance,
subordinated the pursuit of gain to his
set purpose to take a place among the
benefactors of humanity. He was glad
to see his lots appreciate in value; but,
as ho walked over Sutro Heights and
cast a wistful glance over the vast
spaces of the ocean that rolled at his
feet, his mind turned gladly from
thoughts of real estate to revel in the
jey that when he was gone generations
would thank him for what he had done
for them and theirs.

LOS ANGELES
WILL EXHIBIT
Its Chamber of Commerce
Replies to the State
Board.
California Must Not Expect to
Stand on Los Angeles'
Credit.
They Want the Advantages That
Are to Be Gained by Its
Action.
The Chamber o-f Commerce of Loa
Angeles has replied to thÂ£ general sub
committee appointed by the State
Board, Chamber of Commerce of this
city and the other commercial and in
dustrial organizations in no uncertain
terms. It will be recalled that this
sub-committee was appointed upon a
motion of Mayor Phelan to invite the
city and county of Los Angeles to unite
In making an exhibit at the Trans-
Mississippi Exposition, to be held at
Omaha.
At the last meeting of the State .
Board a telegram was received from :
Los Angeles, stating that $10,000 had j
been raised for the exhibit, and asking
what San Francisco would do. Ncr re- j
ply was made because the board had â 
not then made its return to the peti
tion of the committee representing: the |
commercial and industrial organiza
tions of this city. Yesterday J. A. !
Filcher, the secretary of the board, re- i
ceived the following letter, which ex- i
plains itself:
Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce,
February in, 1898.
J. A. Filcher, Esq., Secretary State
Board of Trade, San Francisco, Cal.â
Dear Sir: At the meeting of the Board
of 1 >i rectors yesterday 1 road your coin-,
mnnlcatlon relative to the Trans-Missis
sippi Exposition and the matter was dis- j
cussed pro and con, and In looking up j
the subscription list that was circulated j
among our people it was found that the '
money was subscribed for making Â« I
Strictly Los Angeles exhibit. The chair
man of the committee. J. S. Slauson, j
stated that they had canvassed every i
county in Southern California, endeavor
ing to collect funds to make a Southern
California exhibit, but were unsuccess- I
ful and had to abandon the idea entire- j
ly, and when they came to go among
our own people they subscribed only on j
the condition that the money would be i
used for defraying the expenses of a I
local or county exhibit. Such being the !
case, the board, as much as they would !
like to enter into the proposition of mak- >
ing a State exhibit, felt in duty bound to
carry out the conditions under which the
money was subscribed. The fund fur
nished by the county was also subscribed
on the same conditions. Of course, if
space can me procured next to that as- !
signed to our county, w will do every
thing in our power to nave the display
conform to the balance of the exhibit.
You are w*>ll aware that any exhibit
that can be made- in < >maha r.r any other
locality from any section of this State
naturally advertises the whole State, but
where money is furnished by one locality I
for advertising that particular section
it is hardly to be expected the whole
State should claim credit for it.
You are fnmiiiar with th^ position ta
ken by the Chamber of Commerce in in
augurating the Omaha Exposition and
the fight made in the Legislature to have
the bill passed, which is sufficient evi
MINES AND MINING
"Within the past few days the first slight
steps in the way of actual operations in
connection with those restraining dams
have been taken by the Federal Debris
Commissioners. Under the supervision of
Hubert Vischer, an engineer in the em
ploy of the commission, shafts are being
sunk and borings made at various points
at the Narrows in the Yuba River to de
termine the nature of the foundation
available there. This point has long been
regarded as one of the sii.Â«s that would
probably be selected. No fotmal decision
to erect a 4am at that point has been
made and the tests merely indicate ac
tive "preparations to prepare plans." The
plans themselves have a tedious course
ahead of them, but a slight movement on
the part of the commission is enough to
rivet attention and produce joy. There is
a reasonable promise that within the
dence that its members are awake to the
advantages to be gained by such an ex
hibft and will leave no stone unturned
to make the display equal to all former
expositions under its charge.
Regretting very much tiiat this matter
was not taken up several months ago, so
that we could all work in unison, I re- j
main, Yours truly,
FRANK WIGGINS, Secretary.
The board made no reply to- the tele
gram from Los Angeles because it was
onry at their last meeting that they re- |
plied to the committee from this city. ,
The substance of this reply was that it
was the sense of the board that any
thing less than an adequate display
would be injurious rather than of an
advantage to the State.
It is now apparent that California
will be represented at Omaha by Los
Angeles if no other section of the State
is.
The State Board at its next meeting
will receive the reply from the general \
committee, and will determine whether
the State shall be represented at Oma
ha. In event of the board deciding to
make an exhibit the question will rise
as to whether the Los Angeles exhibit
will be separate or connected with that
of the State.
LECTURES ON CHILD LIFE.
Mies Amalie Hofer Before a Large
Audience at the Century Club.
The initial lecture of a series of three
was delivered by Miss Amalie Hofer of
Chicago at the Century Club yesterday ;
afternoon before the assembled members :
of the Golden Gate Kindergarten Associa- ;
tion. This is Miss Hofer's first visit to j
this city on a lecture tour and in conse- i
quence much interest has been displayed ,
by the members of local institutions in
the subject which she has chosen as the
most appropriate to elucidate during her
brief visit here.
This subject, which will embrace the
entire series of lectures, will be entitled
â¢Child Life." being based on Froebel's
"Mother Play and Nursery Songs."
The sub-title of the first lecture deliv
ered yesterday afternoon was on "The
Family and Home Plays," and was- given
for the purpose of showing how the do
mestic ideal may be enthroned in the
child's mind.
From the first words uttered in the ex
pansion of the subject Miss Hofer at
tempted to draw a well-deiined parallel
of the effect* produced upon a child edu- I
cat ed from birth in the correct course it
should pursue in life and the child neg
lected by its parents to practically shape |
its own course through the struggles of j
the world.
In the description of the effects of early
training of the child mind the lecturer en
larged upon the advantages accruing
from an early attendance at the kinder
garten, and spoke of the coming move
ment which she, assisted by the directors
of the various kindergarten systems in
this State and others in the Union, she
hopes to effect in making this fundament- j
al school of human knowledge a well- j
recognized institution, the duties of which
will be placed in the hands of competent \
and well-trained teachers, who, in order j
to ho eligible to hold positions as such, j
must undergo a course of study of not
less than two years' duration.
These teachers will then be given posi
tions in the new department and shall
have the care of educating and bringing i
children up in the correct course j
in life, and principally those children who j
are either neglected by their parents as !
unwelcome burdens or thrown upon the |
world without a proper fundamental basis
of knowledge, and virtue owing to the j
lack of means of poor people.
The little hall in the rear of the Ten- j
tury <""lub where the lecture was held was
crowded with a select and enthusiastic
audience of women and young ladies in
terested in kindergarten work.
The sub-title for the next lecture will be
â¢'Nature Plays," by which the child comes
into knowledge of his surroundings and |
the laws which govern them," to be d*Â»- i
livered to-morrow afternoon at 3 o'clock
in the Century Club Hall on Sutter street, i
Will Filed for Prqbate.
The will of Otis J. Preston was filed for
probate yesterday. An estate consisting
solely of shares of stork in the firm of
Preston & McKinnon is bequeathed the
children of the testator, Phare and share
alike.
year a dam or two will be located, plans
approved and contracts called for.
The committee on dams of the Califor
nia Miners' Association has prepared a
reply to the communications of Ciuef of
Engineers Wilson, and it has been for
warded to Washington. The communi
cation does not <*o into any aetailed dis
cussion of the relations of the Federal
and State appropriations, the misunder
standing of the law expressed by Gen
eral Wilson or the methods by which the
State and Congressional appropriations I
can be simultaneously and practically ap- I
plied to the same work. The situation, !
however, will be explained by members of j
the California delegation and the execu
tive committee of the Miners' Associa
tion will see that a way of amalgamat
ing the appropriations so that the State !
money will be at the practical, if not the |
technical, command of the War Depart- |
ment ia devised. The body of the com- I
munication, which has been forwarded by !
President Neff and Secretary Sonntag, is
as follows:
"Your favor of January 7, IS9B, has been
received, and contents noted with great
care. We are much encouraged at your i
statement that progress is being made I
in the maturing of the plans for the im
provement of the Sacramento and Feath
er rivers, and hope that the final plans
may be brought to perfection at as early
a day as possible.
"In regard to the $300,000 appropriation
by the State of California for the im
provement of the Sacramento and San
Joaquin rivers, we would say that that is
under the jurisdiction of the Commis
sioner of Public Works of California, and
that we, therefore, do not feel at liberty
to trench upon his action.
"In regard to the $250,000 appropriated
by the State of California for the con
struction of restraining dams, and which
is referred to in the act of Congress of
June 3, 1896. mentioned in your letter, we
would say that, in view of the fact that
the law of Congress Is permissive, and
does not command the deposit of this
money with the Treasurer of the United
States, and also in view of the peculiari
ties of the constitution of the State of
California and its very stringent provi
sions as to the disbursement of State
money, the officers of our State have no
right to draw any part of the appropria
tion from the State treasury until plans
for the erection of restraining works are
adopted by the California Debris Com
mission.
"If your office is in the least degree ob
structed in its work because the Califor
nia appropriation has not been paid into
the United States treasury it will be a
source of deep regret to every one con
cerned in California.
"A copy of the law referred to herein
is inclosed for your convenience. It has
been carefully compared with the origi
nal statute. But, in case of any ques
tion, we would refer you to the Statutes
and Amendments to the Codes of Califor
nia" a. 1897, page 169.
"In conclusion, we wish to cordially
thank the chief of engineers for his ex
pressed intention of impressing upon the
Debris Commission the importance of ad
vancing the work assigned to them, and
ask that all possible dispatch may be

February 22 promises to see more
miners from all over the State in San
Francisco than have been assembled in
the metropolis before. That will be
miners' day at the Mining Fair, and the
special committee in charge, of which W.
C. Ralston is chairman, is straining
every nerve to make it the great day of
the fair. This it unquestionably will be.
The low railroad rates have been extend
ed to the 26th inst., and thousands from
the mining regions will be on hand. The
Calaveras band will be on hand and at
the formal exercises Governor Budd,
Mayor Phelan, J. H. Neff and others will
make addresses. That old song of pio
neer times. "The Days of '49," will be on
the musical programme. Over $1000 will
be expended in prizes at the double and
single handed championship rock-drilling
contests and the Cornish wrestling con
tests.
That "white metal" mystery of Modoe
County is at the front again and stirring
up some excitement up there. There ap
pears to bo a mineralogieal mystery about
the thing, though probably the mystery
is simply due to the fact that no expert
authority has ever taken the trouble to
thoroughly investigate it. The white
metal discovery was made about three
years ago by a man named Dyson. A
deposit of mineralized igneous rock ap
parently a mile wide arid several miles
long was found in the Warner Range, be
tween Surprise Valley and Goose Lake.
It was said that by any crude smelting
process a peculiar white metal was easily
obtained. There was a rush, many claims
were located and then nothing came of
it all. Samples sent to the State Mining
Bureau showed very soft iron, lead and
zinc, but no exact analysis was made.
Similarly indefinite tests were made by
other assayers. The metal looks like soft
solder and will coat iron readily. It hap
been popularly called Dysonite, after the
discoverer. Now a San Francisco min
ing man is investigating the thing and
Modoc County expects the mystery to be
solved and to see a large production of
"Dysonite," whatever it really is.
The miners are about as much Interest
ed in the rain prospects as are the farm
ers, in whose behalf all the prayers for
precipitation are offered. During all the
fall and winter a great many quartz
mines dependent on water power as well
as hydraulic mines have been shut down
or run part time on account of lack of
water From this cause the State's gold
production was lessened between $2,000,000
and $3,000,000. In the Sierras there are two
feet of snow where there is generally
twelve or fifteen feet. Should the season
remain a dry one the mining industry
will be greatly hampered in many dis
tricts throughout the year.
Here is another sample of the weekly
**n H of indications of mining prosperity
in California and the new widespread in
lerebi id it. San Jnse is not in a gold
mining region, but the San Jose Mercury
*ays: "Success appears to be attending
the efforts of a large number of residents
of this county who are interested in nu
merous mining ventures in various parts
of the State. Every little while the an
nouncement is made that some of our
citizens have 'struck it rich' or have
sold a mine or bought one. while scores
are meeting with encouraging prospects.
The revival of interest in mining is not
confining itself to any particular locality,
and the profits of the industry are as
likely to be reaped by those residing in
the agricultural districts an well as by
those who are neari-r the mines."
Something new, though simple, has
struck beach mining, a small phase of the
gold industry in California which grows
with the others. Economy in handling
the black sand has resulted at the mouth
of Harris Creek in Humboidt County by
the plan of piping water from a dam on
the creek into a sand pit on the beach
mining claim. The sand and water were
then pumped with a five-inch pump into
the sluices instead of being shoveled up

The great copper mines at Iron Moun

wood that it has become scarce near-by,
and now a firm with a contract to supply
20,000 cords has bought a large tract of
railroad timber land on the Pit River,
from where the wood will be floated down
to Keswiok in the Sacramento. The
general mining boom in that part of the |
State is enlivening the whole country,
creating saw mills and other industries,
affording employment to a great many
men, giving home markets to the farmers
and putting new life into the towns.
The celebrated Lincoln mine at Sutter
Creek, Amador County, has been bonded
to E. C. Voorheis and some associates for
four years for $200,000, and will be ex
tensively developed. The mine was once
owned by Senator Stanford, who sold it
to a Scotch company for $400,000. It was
poorly managed and has been idle for
twenty years. It is proposed to incor
porate a company with 115.000 shares of
stock, 15,000 shares to go to the promoters
and the remainder to be assessed 3 cents
per month for a working capital.
William York and sons, who some time
ago struck it quite rich in their mine

feet struck some of the richest rock that
has ever been seen in this section.â

WHIST
PASSING WHIST FADS.
The Now York Evening Post of Wednesday
and Saturday of each week comes to us with
a whist column that we take great pleasure
in reading. It is edited by that brainy little
woman, Mrs. Margaretha Wetherall Wallace,
whose name we have seen so many times In
"Whist."
We have read some severe criticisms on some
things she says in her columns, and the only
charge that we know can be proved against
her is, phe tells the truth, and that Is some
thing even some whisters don't want to hear.
We wish we could say as much of some others
that write whist articles.
In commenting on a match recently played
between the Baltimore and Toledo teams for
the A. W. L. challenge trophy, Mrs. Wallace
hits the nail on the head in regard to one
or two whist fads. She says:
"In looking over the reports of the game that
have so far come to hand, two noticeable fea
tures are that the Vail through the honor'
appears to be going out of practice, and that
some of the teams are beginning to realize
that the lead of fourth best from king. Jack,
ten is a trick-loser. In regard to the former
play, it is quite possible that there was no
favorable opportunity for making the 'call
through the honor.' That question can, of
course, only be determined by an expert ex
amination of the deals, but so far as the lead
of fourth best from king, jack, ten Is con
cerned, it may be apropos to say that at the
sixth congress, when Mr. Henry Jones (Cav
endish) was present, he was Interviewed by the
correspondent of the Evening Post on this
very point. He unhesitatingly pronounced the
lead of the fourth best from that combina
tion as a certain trick-loser, and predicted that
after a time it would be given up. Lately
it has been quite the fashion to attempt to rel
egate the 'master' to the rank of old fogy by
some of the champions of the league, but It
must be admitted that if Baltimore has given
up the fourth best lead from king. Jack, ten,
the opinion given by Mr. Jones on this point
over a year ago Is not without some value."
WHIST SYSTEMS AND JUST WHIST.
Whist players, whist writers and whist talk
ers can argue until the grand finale of life re
garding the value which the opening of a hand
possesses as an Indication of superior practical
whist ability, and during the debate the fel
lows who are paying close attention to the
middle and end play of the hands will wear
the high-score pins and the mouthers of special
water-tight, gold-cinch systems will all be lost
In the shuffle for whist honors simply because
they know more about system than they do
of play. A little system and hard-headed
whist win match games and other whist hon
ors, while much system and its many depend
ent attributes to whip the other teams, with
out the exercise of brain action. Is responsible
for tall-end position in competitions. Whenever
one KÂ°es among whist players nowadays more
is heard of system than of whist. Three men
and women out of every ten pose as whist au
thorities, talk and write learnedly of how to
win tricks and then want you to believe that,
as whist players, they are only in hard luck. â
T. E. OtlÃ, In Newark News.
WHY MORE THAN ONE LEAD FROM THE
JACK.
It should bÂ« the aim of every whist player
to try to endow each and every card he plays
with as much positive Information as his whist
capacity or ability will permit.
What is the use of having a card say one of
three things, if you can confine it to two, and
why say one rf two If you can confine It to
one?
Every whist student should always bear in
mind that there Is a negative as well as posi
tive side to most every whist play. At the
present writing, according to the system of
American leads now in vogue, the jack is orig
inally led from ace. king, queen, jack and one
or more others, and from king, queen, jack and
two or more others in both plain and trump
suits. Now why not drop the firsf and con
fine it entirely to the second, and when you
lead the jack have it say. "Partner. I hold the
king, queen and two others at least, but I
don't hold the ace," and from the first com
bination lead the queen?
We know there are a few players of the first
rank who long ago adopted these two leads,
but why not make them generally known, and
v.-hen we know them to be good lead no other
way?
IS WHIST A PASTIME OR A SCIENTIFIC
STUDY?
There has been a great deal said on the sub
ject or whist being played as a mere pastime.

A PROFESSIONAL CORSET-FITTER.
We have secured the services of
MISS AGNES HULIN for a limited
time in our Corset Department. She
will be at the counter ready to make
valuable suggestions to corset wearers,
answer questions and give hints on
proper corset fit and construction that
will be of great value to all ladies inter-
viewing her.
To those that have made n study of the same,
they know better. Rome of the brightest minds
in the country have often expressed their ideas
on the subject, but there is none that strikes
us with more favor than the sayings of Major-
General A. W. Drayson. who has given the
game of whist more thought than any other
man we know of.
In his work. "The Art of Practical Whist.r
he says on page 2: "If whisi; were a mere
pastime it never would have occupied the posi
tion or the attention of intelligent men that it
now does. Whist, although a pastime and
tending to Increase Bocial intercourse, is yet
Bomething more. It brings Into action faculties
of memory, observation. Judgment, patience
and knowledge of character, all of which are
necessary as means of success in the world;
thus whist, like some branches of mathematics,
although not practically useful in every-day
life, yet calls into action those mental qualfties
which every observing and reasoning person
ought to possess. It also has the advantage of
being a game that can be played to an ad
vanced period of life, when more active pur
â¢ults cannot be carried on, or when the sight
and muscles have lost their power."
ANSWERS TO WHIST QUERIES.
Under the American Whist League code of
laws, when a trick Is once turned and quitted
It cannot be seen. The English code differs
from ours In this respect.
TRUMP SLIP AND TRUMP CARD.
In duplicate whist the trump card and the
trump slip must be left by the" dealer face up j
on the tray until It Is his turn to play to the \
first trick; then he must take the trump card j
into his hand and turn the trump slip face
down and put it in its usual place. After the
trump card has been lawfully taken up and the
trump slip turned down any one looking at the
face of the trump slip is liable to the same
penalty as naming the trump card. The penalty
for this Is a player can have his highest or
lowest trump called by either adversary any
time during the play of that deal.
REVOKING.
If your partner renounces In error or refuses
to follow suit to a card led and you think be
has a card of that suit and you ask any ques
tion calling partner's attention to the play,
should he have a card of the suit In hand, you
asking the question which calls your partner's
attention to the play establishes a revoke, and
the card Improperly played must go with the
trick.
WHAT IS THE TRUMP SUIT?
When the dealer has once lawfully taken up
the trump card It must not be named, under
penalty of law 18. Many players are under the
Impression that they have a rigrht to ask the
dealpr at any time what the trump suit Is.
All questions (except the one when you ask
an adversary if he has a card of a suit re
nounced) must be addressed to and answered
only by your partner. The dealer's responsi
bility of the trump card ceases as soon as he
takes it up lawfully.
SCORING MATCH GAMES.
In scoring match games between two clubs
or where there are more than four players on j
a side it Is done in this way: Add the total |
number of tricks that both teams have made I
together and divide the same by two, and the I
team whose score of tricks taken exceeds such I
dividend wins the match by the number of I
tricks in excess thereof. For example. Trist j
Duplicate r.nd Petaluma play a match with :
sixteen players on a side of twenty-four deals. ;
The total tricks won by Petaluma were 1260, i
the total by Trist 1236. Adding the two scores
together makes 24%; divided by two. Rives us
1248. The Petalumas' score exceeds this num- j
ber by twelve, consequently wins the match j
by that number of tricks. Read law A in the
Laws of Duplicate Whist.
COMMON MISTAKES IN WHIST.
Calling a deal in whist a hand. A "hand" In
whist is thirteen cards, a deal is four hands of
thirteen cards each.
Calling an original lead a "forced" lead be- ;
cause you see fit to open from a short suit. It j
has got to be the common name for this lead
In certain whist localities, but it is incorrect.
The proper name for it is an Irregular lead.
Calling tricks "points." There is nc such
thing as "points" In duplicate whl.Â«t.
Then, again, saying the "two-spot or nlne
ppot." or any other spot. Just as well say the
jack-spot or queen-spot. The cards are not
spotted.
Playing your cards on the edge of the table
and placing your score sheet and pencil in
front of you near the tray. The reverse of
this is what you should do and comply with the
law.
