VOLUME LXXXIV.-NO. 143.
DO THE PEOPLE OF SAN FRANCISCO
WANT BARCLAY HENLEY, AN ALIEN OF
MEXICO, FOR THEIR DISTRICT ATTORNEY?
Is Barclay Henley a citizen of the United States or is he an alien who has no country and who has renounced alle
giance to the land that gave him birth ? In 1864, fearing arrest at the hands of the Federal authorities, he went to Mexico,
which country was then under the rule of Emperor Maximilian, where he renounced allegiance to the Government of the
United States and became a naturalized citizen of Mexico. He has never renounced his Mexican citizenship and has never
legally announced his intention of again becoming a citizen of the United States. He is now a candidate for the office of
District Attorney of the City and County of San Francisco on the Democratic ticket, having been nominated for that position
by Mayor Phelan's self-appointed convention of one hundred job-chasers.
IN 1864 Barclay Henley, the Demo
cratic candidate for District Attor
ney, left California and went to
Mexico, -where he renounced his
American citizenship and took the
oath of allegiance to the Government of
that country. That small portion of the
voters of thia city who intend to cast
their votes for Mr. Henley would now
like to know whether they are expected
to vote for an alien, a citizen of Mexico,
or a citizen of the United States.
The question concerning Mr. Henley's
citizenship has been asked before, but
during the years that have pas^-d since
the query was put no satisfactory an
fwer has been given an expectant pub-
Jic. Now that Mayor Phelan and the
Kxamirver, twin models of purity, have
vouched for the high purposes and per
sonal worth of their candidate for Dis
trict Attorney, it may be well to give
to the public such official data as can
at this moment be obtained concerning
Mr. Henley's citizenship, so that every
one will have an opportunity to form a
Judgment from a contemplation of the
facts.
During the progress of the Civil War
Henley's open declaration concerning
his sympathy with the Confederacy
brought him to the attention of the
civil and military authorities of this
State. Before these officials could take
any authoritative action concerning the
matter Henley went to Mexico. Ar
rived there, he addressed the following
petition, the original of which is still
on file in the official archives at the
City of Mexico, to Emperor Maximilian,
then thÂ«Â« r-j'ing soven-'grn of Mexico:
PETITION.
The undersigned, Barclay Henley,
a native of Charleston, Indiana,
United States of America, has the
honor of very respectfully stating to
your imperial Majesty that, having
come here with the idea of immigrat
ing from his native country and
bringing his family and his fortune,
he has become convinced that, under
the auspices of the new government
Mexico is the country of America
that offers the greatest advantages
and most guarantees to an snterpris
ing and hard-working colonist. But
the undersigned having all of his
property in California is under the
necessity of returning there in order
to bring his family and to turn into
cash his movable and immovable
property, and then, owing to the
strong animosities which have been
occasioned by the civil war between
the partisans of the North and those
of the South, he fears that on ac
count of his Southern opinions that,
as an American citizen, he will meet,
on the part of the authorities of Cali
fornia, with more or less obstacles to
his immigration, which his character
as a Mexican subject will place him
beyond their precautions.
The undersigned, therefore, takes
the liberty of very respectfully solic
iting from your imperial Majesty to
grant him naturalization papers by
virtue of the power vested in your
Majesty, and as you have deigned
to do with other foreigners.
Hoping that this petition will be
favorably received the undersigned
has the honor, sire, of remaining,
with the most profound respect, your
imperial Majesty's very humble and
most obedient servant,
(Signed) BARCLAY HENLEY,
Iturbide Hotel, Room 43.
To the Emperor.
Attached to the petition Is the follow
ing certificate:
"We, the undersigned, are acquainted
with Mr. Barclay Henley, an American
citizen, and know that he conducts him
self well and lives honestly, and for the
uses which may be necessary, we sign
this paper in Mexico on tho 24th of De
cember, 1864 (Signed.)

"Let it be issued. December 24, 1864."
The Minister of State and Foreign
Affairs returned Mr. Henley's petition
with the following indorsement:
"Mr. Barclay Henley, whose petition to
H. M. your Excellency is pleased to
transmit to me, marked with the number
2337, must be presented himself to the
Ministry in order to fill the requisites of
the law now in force relating to naturali
zation papers."
That he did comply with the requi
sites of the law is shown by the fol
lowing: , .
MEXICO, December 24. 1864.
I ninclope herewith to your Excellency,
the paper* which H. M. the Emperor has
been pleased to errant in favor of Mr
Barclay Henley, so that you may deliver !
them to said gentleman when he calls
for them at your office, if the said party
has already called and left his address
your Excellency may please forward to i
him the said documents wherever he may !
be: but if he has not given his address,
you will forward the same to the Political
Prefect of San Bias, where the Interested
party Is to go."
Mr. Henley, having left the City of
Mexico before â  receiving his natural!
The San Francisco Call
zation papers, they were forwarded In
due course as directed, as wfli appear
from an official letter to the General
Secretary of the Superior Political Pre-
Kture of the Mexican Empire from
military commander of San Bias,
dated January 18, 1865, which reads as
follows:
"With your Excellency's official note of
the 6th, I have received the naturaliza
tion papers which his Majesty has been
pleased to issue In fa%"or of Mr. Barclay
Henley, who left for Mazatlan on the 9th
inst. on board the English steamer Ze
nith, and I shall forward said document
by the mall steamer Alirante, which sails
from this port on the 22d inst., to the Su
perior Prefect of said port, who shall ob
tain corresponding: receipt to be transmit
ted to your Excellency in due time
"Certified to by Mariano Romero, Su
perior Political Prefect, District of
Guanajuato."
Having received his naturalization
papers, and feeling that as a citizen of
Mexico he had nothing to fear from the
civil and military authorities of Cali
fornia, Mr. Henley returned to this
State. His arrival here, however, was
quickly noted, and the following letter
was addressed to him by Provost Mar
shal General John F. Mason:
Office A. A. Provost Marshal General of
California and Nevada Ter., San
Francisco, Cal.. February 7, 1865.
Mr. Barclay Henleyâ Sir: It is reported
that you are here as an agent or repre
sentative in some form of Dr. \Vm. M.
Gwin, formerly U. S. Senator from this
State. Major General McDowell requests
me to ask you If this Is so, or if it is not
true. 1 have the honor to be, very re
spectfully, your obedient servant.

To this Mr. Henley made the follow
ing reply, being careful, as will be
noted, to announce his Mexican citizen
ship and claim the protection , due a
subject of a foreign power:
S. F., Cal., Feb. 7, 1865.
John F. Mason, A. A. Provost Marshal
General â General: In response to your
communication hearing the date of the
6th inst., inquiring of me whether I am
or am not "an agent or representati\'e in
some form of Dr. Wrn. M. Gwin, formerly
U. S. Senator from this State," I have the
honor to state briefly my true position in
reference thereto:
Some months ago I was employed by
some gentlemen (whose names will be
given upon request) to proceed to the
City of Mexico for the purpose of obtain
ing from the government a grant of land
somewhere in Northern Mexico, with a
view of engaging in the cultivation of
cotton, tobacco, etc. On my arrival In
conformity with my Instructions, I sub
mitted the papers and buslneas generally
to Mr. Gwin, by whose opinion I had been
previously told to be governed, it having
been understood that he (Gwin) would be
found in this city.
Mr. Gwin promptly informed me that
a grant of land of this character could
not be obtained and it would be useless
for me to apply for it, saying, however,
that small grants of land, in the shape
of pre-emption claims, somewhat like the
American pre-emption plan of gfving land
to actual settlers, could be obtained.
Mr. Gwin, in conjunction with the Mar
quis de Montholon, the French Embassa
dor in Mexico, also gave me some other
Prtrmation in relation to the contem
ted French occupation of Northern
xico, assuring me of French protee
n and giving promise of permanent
rerament In that country.
These assurances, together -with
the natural inducements held out by
the country, induced me to take up
|my abode there, in pursuance of
which I applied to the Mexican Gov
ernment for letters of naturalization,
which were duly issued to me, the
evidence of which fact is now in the
hands of the French Consul of this
city, to whom you are hereby re
ferred.
In justice to the gentlemen who Rent
me to Mexico, and in order that they
might be placed in full possession of the
facts, ana also to arrange and close up
my own private affairs, 1 re-turned to Cal
ifornia and have made my report to these
gentlemen.
I see no reason why I should not re
mark here, as is due to candor, that I am
the friend personally of Mr. Owin. a
friendship which I have renson to be
lieve is reciprocated, and I would not hps
itate to aid him in any honorable, lawful
and legitimate enterprise in which he
may be engaged. These being our rela
tions on leaving Mexico, Mr. Owin re
quested of me that while on my visit to
i this country and engaged in the f;f-ule
ment of my own business affairs, I would
furnish to those desiring it such informa
tion in reference to the French occupa
tion of Northern Mexico as 1 had from
intercourse with himself and M. Montho
lon possessed myself of, and in this con
nection I have sometimes said, and per
haps writtton, that I was sent here by
Dr. Gwin, intending thereby only to con
vey the idea that whatever information
I gave was obtained from sources en
titling it to creditâ that Is to say, from
himself or the French Minister.
As before remarked, I came here from
Mexico to settle up my private affairs,
preparatory to leaving, and Incidentally
nave, upon all proper occasion, endeav
ored to give all who come to see me or
hayÂ« written me such information In ref
erence to the soil, climate, commercial
advantages, government, etc., as the data
with which I have been provided wir w >
able me to do. The business that brou^at
me here is about concluded, and 1 shall
be ready to return by the next steamer.
I have not come here to engage myself In
anything improper, unlawful or Inimical
In any degree to this Government. I have
had and nave now no secrets and am
ready at all times and have been to tell
the military authorities of this coast
everything that I know in reference to
the matters or reports that I presume
provoked your communication of yester
day. I have the honor, general, to be
very respectfully your obedient servant,
BARCLAY HENLEY.

BARCLAY HENLEY, THE EXAMINER'S "SWORD OF DAMOCLES," BOWS TO MAXIMILIAN I.
records In the office of the Secretary of
War at Washington, D. C.
It may be that Mr. Henley will claim
that by the provisions of the treaty of
1868 between the United States and
Mexico he was absolved from his alle
giance to Mexico. The treaty reads:
"Article IV. If a citizen of the United
States naturalized in Mexico renews his
resklenceshlp in the United State* without
Intent to return to Mexico he Bhall be
held to have renounced his naturalization
in Mexico. Reciprocally, if a citizen of
Mexico naturalized in the United States
renews hlB residence in Mexico without
intent to return to the United States he
shall have renounced his naturalization
ship in the UnlU-d States. The Intent not
to return may be held to exist when the
person naturalized in one country resides
in the other country more than two years,
but this presumption may be rebutted by
evidence to the contrary."
In the same year a treaty waa nego
tiated between the United States and
Bavaria. Because of some doubt as to
the meaning of th* terms, the follow
ing protocol was added:
The citizen naturalized abroad
must first apply to be received back
into his original country in the man
ner prescribed by its laws and regu
lations, and must acquire citizenship
anew, exactly as any other alien.
Mr. Henk/ Is not a naturalized citi
zen of the United States.
The decision "sT the Supreme Court in
1821 in the case of Captain Clayton, an
American citizen who had taken the
oath of allegiance to a revolutionary
government at Buenos . Ayrea, Chief
Justice Marshall said:
The individual who divests him
self of the obligation of a citizen
loses the rights which are connected
with those obligations. He becomes
an alien. His lands, if he has any,
are escheatable. He cannot recover
those rights by residence, but must
go through the process which the law
prescribes for the naturalization of
an alien.
This being so. It would appear to the
lay mind that Mr. Henley is not now a
citizen of the United States, and that he
has no right to vote or hold office or to
enjoy any of the rights and liberties
that are the exclusive privileges of the
subjects of this free country.
The following from the News Letter
of August 15, 1885, referring to the sub
ject of Mr. Henley's citizenship, may
not prove uninteresting:
He was known to be unpopular
with his neighbors and for very ob
vious reasons. He was unneighborly,
a land-gTabber, a fllcher of Indian
soil, a trafficker in the spoils that
are always to be found around "poor
Lo's" reservation, on the border of
which he lived; an aider and abettor
of Maximilian's ill-starred effort to
throttle republican liberty over a
large section of this continent dedi
cated to the Monroe doctrine; a dis
gruntled, unappeased and disloyal
American who has never been recon
structed and has never accepted the
inevitably but is secretly to-day as
much an imperialist as when he fled
to Mexico sympathizing with Maxi-
The undersigned, Barclay Henley, a native of Charleston, In
diana, United States of America, has the honor of very respectfully
stating to your imperial Majesty that having come here with the idea
of immigrating from his native land and of bringing his family and
his fortune, he has become convinced that, under the auspices of
the new Government, Mexico is the country of America that offers
the greatest advantages and most guarantee to an enterprising and
hard-working colonist. But the undersigned, having all of his prop- \
erty in California, is under the necessity of returning there in order
to bring his family and to turn into cash his movable and immovable
property, and then owing to the strong animosities which have been
occasioned by the civil war between the partisans of the North and
of the South, he fears on account of his Southern opinions that,
as an American citizen, he will meet, on the part of the authorities
of California, with more or less obstacles to his immigration which
his character as a Mexican subject would place him beyond their
precautions.
The undersigned therefore takes the liberty of very respectfully
soliciting from your imperial Majesty to grant him naturalization
papers by virtue of the power vested in you and as you have de
signed to do for other foreigners.
Hoping that this petition will be favorably received the under
signed has the honor, sire, of remaining, with the most profound
respect, your imperial Majesty's very humble and most obedient
servant. BARCLAY HEHLEY.
I milian's usurpation, eschewed the
broad aegis of American freedom,
forsook his Americanship and grov
eled in the dirt and begged and be
' seeched to be allowed the poor priv
ilege of wearing the servile livery of
the direst and darkest monarchy that
foreign coin and mercenary arms
have ever attempted to foist upon any
portion of the free soil of this liberty
loving continent. Such was and is
Barclay Henley.
And this is the man that the Exam
iner refers to as the "Sword of
Damocles"â the man whose candidacy
is "bringing fear to the heart of every
wrongdoer" within the confines of the
city of San Francisco. This "sword of
Damocles" is the same man who fled
to Mexico during the hour of his na
tion's peril; who swore allegiance to
I foreign power in order to escape ar
st upon his return to his own coun
r; who i-as never renounced his al
fi'ance to that foreign power, al-
DUgh he has for years been enjoying
; fruits of the llbery that was bought
the blood of the heroes whom he de-
Ised and reviled; who has sought
d is seeking office at the hands of
izens whose claim to citizenship is
clear as their love for their country
It may be that the good Republicans
and good Democrats of this city who
have watched the brave boys of the
gallant First California Volunteers
march away to fight a foreign foe wfll
vote for this man who fled across the
border when men were needed to fight
the nation's battles. Perhaps the Grand
Army veterans whose empty sleeves
and bent forms testify to the part they
took in the struggle to maintain the na
tion's integrity will vote for Mr.
Henley.
This is the man Mayor Phelan has se
lected to administer the laws of the
loyal State of California to the good cit
izens of San Francisco. The choice Is
worthy of the man who marie it.
The A. B. Treadwell Club.
There was a large and enthusiastic
meeting held at Scottish Hall last night
on the occasion of the first meeting of the
Western Addition A. B. Treadwell Club.
Thomas Coleman, president of the club,
introduced Judge William Caldwell as
chairman of the meeting.
After a review of the achievements of
the Republican party In the recent troub
lous times, Judge Caldwell introduced
County Clerk Curry as the first speaker
of the evening.
Mr. Curry explained that he was not
present to further his interests as candi
date for Secretary of State but to let the
people of the city know that he wanted
A. B. Treadwell upon the Police bench.
He made some very pointed remarks
about a man who, while occupying a high
position, tore up tracks in order that cor
porations might not have to pay for pav
ing streets.
A. B. Treadwell, the nominee for Police
Judge and the guest of the evening, was
the next speaker. He thanked his friends
for the demonstration in his behalf and
pledged himself, if elected, to temper
judgment with mercy. He also paid a
high compliment to the rest of the nomi
nees on the local Republican ticket.
The Treadwell quartet, composed of
Miss Annie Jensen, May Griffin, Charles
Franklin and John McHaughton, ren
dered a very catchy ditty. Maguire

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEVADA CITY, Oct. 20.â When Henry
T. Gage, Jacob H. Neff and General W.
H. L. Barnes sought their respective
rooms at Auburji last night for a few
hours' rest the cheering Republicans
continued the great Placer County
demonstration. While waiting for out
going trains the bands played and the
young people danced on the platform
at the Freeman Hotel.
At daylight this morning the Repub
lican standard-bearer, accompanied by
Mr. Neff and General Barnes, boarded
the train for Colfax, connecting there
with the narrow-gauge train for Grass
Valley and Nevada City. In anticipa
tion of the early arrival of the distin
guished party a large throng of citi
zens assembled at the Nevada City
depot. Among those to greet the stand
ard-bearer were Sherman Marsh (chair
man of the Republican Committee), B.
N. Shoecraft, Frank Wadsworth, D. E.
Morgan, J. C. Dean and Henry Lane.
The speakers were escorted to the Na
tional Exchange Hotel, where they met
many of the people of Nevada County.
In honor of the arrival of Mr. Gage a
Governor's salute of seventeen guns
was fired.
The daylight meeting in the theater
of Nevada City this afternoon was an-
other remarkable demonstration, match
ing in point of public interest and Re
publican enthusiasm the great daylight
rallies which rendered the towns of the
San Joaquin Valley so memorable. The
spacious theater was crowded to its ut
most capacity at 2 p. m., the hour ap
pointed for the speaking.
A procession was formed at the hotel,
and, headed by Goyne's band, the col
umn of cheering Republicans marched
to the meeting place. The vast audi
ence was called to order by Sherman
Marsh, who introduced ex-Senator E.
M. Preston as the presiding officer of
the occasion. Mr. Marsh named the
following vice presidents: M. I* Marah,
Charles E. Mulloy, N. P. Brown, W. T.
Monk, Thomas Daniels, W. E. Meser
vey, R. C. Walrath, David Richards,
Dr. R. M. Hunt, J. S. Gregory, Richard
Plummer, Rev. J. Sims, P. G. Scadden,

Evans, A. B. Wolf, B. F. Snell, Judge
Walling, George Nihill, John Waiters,
John T. Reddenick, John Caldwell,
Judge F. S. Nilon and A. C. Cooper.
Mr. Preston, in accepting ..he duties
of presiding officer, made a brief speech,
in which he mentioned a political speech
recently made by Governor Budd in
San Francisco in which the Governor
said: "We are now lined up against
the common enemy." Mr. Preston
asked: "To whom does the Governor
refer when he speaks of the common
enemy? The Republican acknowledges
no enemy but the enemies of our flag
and the enemies of prosperity. The Re
publican party has no uncompromising
way of dealing with its enemies, as we
will again demonstrate on the Bth of
November." (Great cheers.)
Jacob Neff, Republican nominee for
Lieutenant Governor, was the first
speaker introduced. He received a tre
mendous ovation from the audience. In
a few words he thanked the people for
the cordial greeting. As at Auburn
last night he resented the attacks of
Maguire on the integrity and intem
gence of the Republican State conven
tion. He predicted a triumph for the
Republican party and assured the peo
ple that an honest administration of2
State affairs would be one of the re
sults of the victory. (Prolonged ap
plause.)
A double quartet entertained the au
dience. The president introduced Henry
T. Gage. The greeting accorded to the
popular standard-bearer was remark
able for its enthusiasm. The audience
arose and cheered repeatedly. Mr. Gage
spoke for nearly an hour, exposing the
weakness of the fusion candidate's pu
sition on the railroad question. \lhe
Congressional Record was produced to
make the point clear that JNiaguin- w;is
trying to fool the people. The single
tax scheme was handled in effective
style. Maguire's non-American atti
tude in Congress was shown. An elc^
quent tribute was paid to the adminis
tration of President McKinley. In the
mountains, as in the valleys, the peo
ple hail the mention of McKinley's
name with ringing cheers.
When General Barnes was introduced
the people expressed their delight in j
rousing cheers for the eloquent expo- j
nent of Republican principles. The ar
dor of the assembled citizens increased
with each succeeding oratorical night ;
of the speaker. >iut much attention j
â¢was given to Maguire, as Mr. Gage had
turned the searchlight on the rec
ord of the office-holding giant. General
Barnes remarked that Maguire was po- j
litically dead, but the remains might |
be on exhibition for a few days longer, i
The general spo-ke in his happiest man- j
ncr and occasionally turned aside from (
the profound consideration of national
and State questions to treat of the
cranky isms of the single tax leader.
There were .many miners present and i
the discourse afforded them pleasure
and instruction. The Bailies at the ex
pense of the single taxers and their
apostle evc-ked peals of laughter. The
Splendid assemblage, representing the |
best citizens of Nevada County, was j
moved to admiration by the eloquent
tributes to American institutions, Amer- j
lean valor and American achievements. |
It was almost dark when the meeting
adjourned with mighty cheers for Gage
and Xeff and renewed cheering for Gen
ml Barnes and cheers for the whole \
Republican ticket.
Nevada County is in line and will ren
der a splendid majority for Gage and !
Neff on November S.
GREAT ENTHUSIASM
AT GRASS VALLEY
GRASS VALLEY, Oct. 20.â Henry T.
Gage, Jacob Neff and General W. H. L.
Barnes, accompanied by Mr. Shoecraft i
of Nevada City, arrived In Grass Val- ;
ley at 6 o'clock. Owing to the prolon
gation of the meeting at Nevada City i
there was some lack of system in the :
reception here of the distinguished |
party. At the Holbrook Hotel C EL \
Clinch of the State Central Committee â¢
in company with other citizens greeted
the nominees, and escorted tncin to a j
large tent where the meeting took !
place. Music was rendered by the
Grass Valley band. There was a fine
turnout of marching Republicans, and j
a brilliant display of fireworks in honor j
of the event. The streets were lined |
with cheering spectators.
Mill street, on the line of the parade,
"was gorgeously illuminated, and thou
sands of people from Grass Valley and I
surrounding precincts viewed the pro
cession. Three thousand people assem
bled at the big tent where the speakers
addressed the multitude. W. J. Milch- j
ell, chairman of the Republican County ;
Central Committee, called the meeting i
to order, and designated Dr. E. Jamie- i
800 as the presiding officer. Campaign
songs, were sung by the Grass Valley
quartet.
The following vi_e-presidents were
announced: William George. Benjamin
Opie. Daniel Coffin, C. E. Uren. F. J.
Thomas, Henry Daniels, C. E. Clinch,
W. J. Mitchell, D. E. Matteson, M. M. !
Hitchell, A. J. Hoskiner. James Me- j

John Latham, R. Curtis Sr.. J. M.
Campbell. H. L. Body, T. H. Wilhelm.
Charles Stocks, D. B. Marwick. J. P.
Shoemaker, W. H. Morgan, William
Campbell.
Jacob Neff was the first speaker in
troduced. He was received with enthu
siastic cheers, and made an acceptable
speech.
The standard-bearer, Henry T. Gage,
received an ovation when he was pre
sented to the vast audience He spoke
for an hour, holding the profound at- j
tention of the people, and securing j
many demonstrations of approval.
General Barnes received from the au
dience a manifestation of welcome
equal to that which the people accorded |
to the nominees. His address, as usual. ]
was eloquent and convincing. He held j
the vast audience for nearly two hours. !
In the course of his speech, and in re
ply to an inquiry from some one in the
audience, he gave it as his Judgment
that M. H. de Young never could
be chosen United States Senator.
To-night Nevada County Republicans
are predicting a sweeping Republican
triumph. The standard-bearer has
gained hosts of friends since the tour
of the mountain counties began. To
morrow he will return to the Sacra
mento Valley and speak at Woodland
to-morrow night.
SFXMA REPUBLICAN RALLY.
Spirited Addresses Evoke the Great-
est Enthusiasm.
BELMA, Oct. 20.â The Republicans held
a rousing meeting here last night, which
was addressed by J. C. Needham. Repub
lican nominee for Congress in this district,
and by Major Kyle and A. M. Drew. The
speakers were greeted with enthusiasm,
and storms of applause followed every
well-made point. Mr. Needham clearly
mated his position on the railroad ques
tion, claimed by the fusioniets as the only
Issue, and satisfied his hearers that he
was right on that issue, as well as the
tariff, which cannot altogether cease to
interest as long as we are threatened with
a representative in Congress who believes
It "robbery." Mr. Needhajn made many
friends by his statesmanlike handling of
the questions considered.
Major Kyle handled the fusion principle
in politics without gloves, and kept the
house in a roar by the ridiculous attitude
In which he placed the particolored party,
which, by the action of its leaders, ac
knowledges that the principles of neither
faction are of a nature to win adherents.

Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: I was
called upon by one of your reporters yes
terday and Interviewed regarding the po
sition taken by the Merchants' Associa
tion in indorsing Mayor Pnelan for re
election. An account of this interview
appeared in to-day's edition of The Call,
which differed very materially from my
statements to your reporter. I desire to
correct this account and to say that I
made no disparaging remarks about May
or Phelan or his friends, and that I sim
ply stated that the Merchants' Associa
tion were not in polities and therefore I
thought would not indorse Mayor Phelan
or any other candidates. Respectfully,

TO H. T. GAGE
Great Demonstration
at Woodward's.
ORATORY, SONG AND CHEERS
BERKELEY AND STANFORD UN
DERGRADUATES JOIN HANDS.
Arrangements Made for the Holding
of Several Big Meetings in
the Interest of Republi
can Candidates.
The students of the two greatest edu
cational institutions on the Pacific Coast,
Berkeley and Stanford Universities, have
perfected arrangements with the Repub
lican State Central Committee for their
mammoth reception to Henry T. Gage at
Woodward's Pavilion on the evening of
Saturday, October 29. This will be by
far the greatest demonstration of the
campaign and will be an Impressive ob
ject lesson to the voters of the State on
the thoroughness of the mental training
of the young men at these two universi
ties, for each will be represented by ora
tors selected from the student body as
fully equipped to debate the political is
sues of the day as the veteran campaign
ers of the party.
The joint committees from Berkeley
and Stanford having charge of the re
ception met at the State committee's
headquarters yesterday and held a long
conference with Major Frank McLaugh-
Un and other members of the State or
ganization regarding the details. The
programme for the evening was arranged,
with one or two minor exceptions.
There will be no organized parade to
the pavilion, owing to the uncertainty of
the weather so late in the season, but the
students have more than made up for the
lack of skyrockets and red fire by the
excellence of the exercises within the big
Btructure.
Professor C. A. Duniway of Stanford
will deliver the address of welcome and
introduce the president of the evening-,
who will be some member of the Univer
sity of California alumni to be decided
upon in a day or two. The Stanford
quartet will render a prize campaign
song-, after which orations of ten minutes'
duration will be delivered by C. C. Reeth,
class of '00. University of California, and
Mr. Chandler, class of '99, Stanford Uni
versity.
The Gage Club of Berkeley will sing its
piize campaign songs, to be followed by
short addresses by R. C. Daniels, "99, j
University of California, and S. G. Baily.
'99. Stanford. Then the Stanford quartet !
will entertain the assemblage with more
songs, after which General W- H. L.
Barnes will deliver the oration of the
evening. The double quartet of the two
universities will follow General Barnes,
and the presentation of Mr. Gage and a
short speech by that gentleman will con
clude the exercises.
Of course both collages â¢will be repre
sented in the audience -by bigsdelegatlons,
who will lay aside their natural rivalry
and fraternize during the evening, and
the boys will come loaded with class, col
lege and campaign yells, each delegation
striving to outdo the other in the matter
of noise and enthusiasm.
Monday evening, October 31, there will
be another big demonstration at Wpod
ward's Pavilion, when Webster Davis,
the celebrated Eastern orator will speak
in behalf of the Republican nominees.
Other meetings arranged are as follows:
To-morrow night Messrs. McKinlay, Pat
ton and Kahn will address a meeting at
Scottish Hall, Larkin and Hayes streets;
another meeting at Fairmount Hall, Chen
ery and Miguel streets, will be addressed
by Messrs. Patton, H. L. Murphy and W.
M. Allen; a third, under tne auspices of
the Austro-Slavonic Republican Lreague,
at Apollo Hall, 810 Pacific street, will be
addressed by Messrs. Kahn, Patton and
Murphy. Tuesday evening of next week

ORATOR FROM THE SOUTH.
J. Wade McDonald of San Diego, a
Former Democrat, to Address
Republicans To-Night.
To-night at Odd Fellows' Hall, one of
the most important meetings of the. cam
paign will be held, when Judge J. Wade
McDonald, the famous orator of San Di
ego, will tell the voters of San Francisco
why he has forsaken past political affili
ations and declared for Gage and Repub
licanism.
Judge McDonald is one of the most
prominent members of the bar in the
southern part of the State, and has long
been regarded as a power in Democratic
councils in that section. Only two years
ago he began a campaign tour in behalf
of W. J. Bryan, but was forced to aban
don it owing to ill-health. But Judge Mc-
Donald believes the Democratic party of
the past is dead; that as a national organ
ization it no longer exists, and Instead,
the Republican party now stands for true
Americanism and all that it implies.
Judge McDonald has had an eventful
career. When less than 16 years of ago
he entered the Union army and served
until disabled by wounds from which he
has never recovered. After the war he
settled in Alabama, where he studied
law and was admitted to the bar. He
was a stanch reconstruction!*! and, con
sequently, a Republican, but after Grant's
election in 1868, believing the laws enact
ed for that purpose were unwise, he
joined the Democracy, remaining with
that party until now.
Judge McDonald removed to Kansas
from Alabama, where he was as active in
politics as a Democrat could be In that
overwhelmingly Republican State before
the Populist craze temporarily bereft the
people of their sound judgment. Ten
years ago he came to California, locating
in San Diego, where he has remained
ever since.
Judge McDonald claims the honor of
being the first to publicly r. Ivocate the
policy of extension which the adminis
tration is now carrying out, and it is
this policy that has brought him back to
the Republican ranks. On May 80, last,
he delivered the Memorial day oration for
the Grand Army at San Diego, in which
he advocated the annexation of Porto
Rico, Hawaii, the Ladrones, Carolines
and Philippines.
In his speech Judge McDonald will deal
mainly with national affairs, and endeav
or to show his hearers that the present
election is primarily an indorsement or
condemnation of the McKlnley adminis
tration's course in the war with Spain.

Some Things That Happened at Teutonia Hall.
MAGUIRE OPENS
HIS CAMPAIGN
IN THIS CITY
Addresses Meetings
in Three Districts.
DEMOCRATS SNUB THE MAYOR
DECLINE TO WAIT FOR MR.
PHELAN'S ARRIVAL.
The Mayor Poses as the Working
man's Friend â Joseph P. Kelly
X^lls of the Decline of
the Democracy.
The Democrats of the Thirty-first Dis
trict held a big demonstration at Teutonic
Hall, on Howard street, near Tenth, last
night. The place was literally packed, for
the Thirty-first is regarded as one of the
Democratic strongholds of the city, and
the crowd gave Judge Magntre, Mr. Hut
chison and the other State, district and
municipal nominees who addressed them
a moist flattering reception. But the
crowd also gave Mayor James D. Phelan
the cut direct, for they refused to wait for
him to get around from another meeting
to address them.
The meeting was the most important
one of five district gatherings arranged
by the State Central Committee for the
evening, at which the leading men of the
party were announced to speak. D. D.
Louney presided, and among the vice
presidents who occupied seats on the
stage were: T. E. Treacy, William Mo-
Laughlin. Charles Asmussen, T. Clancy,
Owen Casey, George Maloney, C. J. Gal
lagher and F. A. Quinn. A number of
ladies were present, and a band added to
the enthusiasm.
Judge Maguire was introduced as the
first speaker, and was greeted with a
storm of applause. He said he had a feel
ing of deep affection for the old Thirty
first foT it was there he was first elected
to office when, twenty-three years ago, he
was a candidate for the Assembly. He
had always begun his campaigns in that
district, and when he had discovered tnat
the campaign managers had arranged to
have him appear at several meetings else
where before he got to the Thirty-hrat
District he had asked them to change ao
.he could speak there first. He said he
â¢Was glad the people remembered his
former trade, at the same time picking up
a hammer aud tapping an anvil on the
stage, whereat the crowd cheered again.
He then turned his attention to the rail
road, and went over the ground he cov
ered so frequently when he was here a
fe E L ee HutchlÂ°son, candidate for Lieuten
ant' Governor, followed Judge Maguire.
He told of their campaign tour together,
saying they had spoken in seventeen
counties In the State, and wherever they
had appeared the halls were not half
large enough to hold the crowds that
wanted to hear Judge Maguire. He pre
dicted that gentleman's election by 30,000
H A McCraney, candidate for Clerk
of the Supreme Court, spoke briefly on
the outlook for the State ticket, after
which Maguire aiTfl his party took car
riages for another part of the city, and
James H. Barry was Introduced. He said
"My distinguished opponent, Mr. Kahn,
who is running against me for Congress
in the Fourth District, has stated that
this district and this State ought to elect
somebody to Congress who is in touch
with the administration. We have such
men in Congress now In Mr. Loud and
Mr. Hllborn, and what have they done?
I may not be In touch with the adminis
tration, but I will have something to do
with getting a postofflce for San Fran
cisco. The administration has done noth
ing for California. Senator White suc
ceeded in "getting an appropriation passed
for harbor improvements at San Pedro,
but the appropriation has been hung up
by Secretary Alger. After this year we
will have a Democratic Congress* and it
will not be necessary to be in touch with
the administration; the administration
will have to be in touch with Congress."
The crowd thinned out perceptibly after
Barry had finished, despite Chairman
Louney's appeal to them to remain as
Mayor Phelan would be present later in
the evening: but the appeal, though it
was repeated several times, had no effect
and after each of the subsequent speak
ers concluded there was a further clean-
Ing out of the hall.
William M. Hinton followed Mr. Barry
and In turn was succeeded by John P.
Dunn. Then came several municipal can
didates, including R. P. Doolan, E. P.
Mogan and M. Greenblatt and D. 8.
O'Brien, candidate for the Assembly from
the Thirty-first District.
Following these gentlemen came a quar
tet in red shirts and leather aprons, who
sang a compalgn parody on the "Anvil
Chorus," from 'Til Trovatore."
Then followed a period of "filling in"
in an attempt to hold those still present
until Phelan could arrive. F. A. Quinn,
T. E. Treacy, Charles Asmussen. the lat
ter a Stanford student, who proved him
self an orator of exceptional ability, and
T. J. Lyons, candidate for School Direc
tor, talked against time, but without
avail. The crowd showed by their actions
that they did not want to hear Pbelan,
and at 10:30 the meeting adjourned before
his Honor could put in an appearance.
PHELAN AT PIONEER HALL.
A Crowd on Hand to Hear Some Ex-
planations for Self and Party.
A houseful of Democratic voters of the
Twenty-ninth District foregathered at
Pioneer Hall last evening to listen to J.
"Heft" Phelan and minor lights of his
following on the issues of the campaign.
The speakers of the evening were: Frank
lin K. Lane, Washington Dodge and the
"Hefter" Mayor.
Steven M. Nolan, nominee for the As
sembly from the Twenty-ninth and chair
man of the meeting, explained In a well
learned though complex speech that it
was the duty of all properly informed
Democrats to stand "shoulder to shoul
der" with the "Little Joint," as they call
him. and "Jim" Barry, to tight for
Democratic victory. He then took consid
erable pleasure In introducing James
Denman for Superintendent of Schools.
After pointing with pride to his record
of four times incumbent of the office he
seeks, Mr. Denman gave way to Dr. Ed
E. Hill, who was followed by John A.
Brown, who confessed to an affection.
purely platonic In nature, for "South of
Market." and said that if he and "Dick
Doolan were elected to the offices they
seek they would see that the district of
their affections would be well cared for.
Franklin K. Lane, one of the events of
the evening, followed a number of minor
nominees to the rostrum, and etated that
the only charge that Republican papers
had dafed to make against Democratic
nominees wan that they were job-chasers,
"and that's just what we are," agreed
Mr. Lane. "We are practical, and we
know what we want; I have the great
est sympathy for the men they call 'the
puph.' and I believe that a man h&B as
much right to work for a living in politics
as anywhere else."
Lew. Byinpton, lormerly of Post street,
now of Harrison, followed Mr. Lane, but
made no allusion to recent residential
changes. He merely thought that the
Supervisors to be elected should De "men
of distinction and ability."
"Dick" Doolan, for Superintendent of
Streets, got no further than a promise to
the "south side" that they could begin
figuring on Jobs in the department, when
Mayor Phelan' s arrival interrupted.
After five consecutive speeches the
Mayor was in a pronouncedly happy vein.
He redwelt, aB it were, upon current is
sues and held up to the glad eyes of his
audience Washington Dodge as the orig
inal Democratic honest .man. With one
hand on his bosom he bowed before hia
audience and disposed of his Wllmerding
School difficulty by putting his word
against The Call's, with hand in the
same vicinity he forgot to mention that
the Merchants' Association had not in
dorsed him, and he considered a simple
denial all that was necessary to prove
that he does not hold stock of the new
gas company. Said Mr. Phelan:
"We do not come before you to aftk re
election, but approval of what we have
done There have been those of us who
have been untrue to their trust, but they
are not running for office this year, and
we are glad of it."
Mr. Phelan then made room for Mr.
Dodge, who waa followed in turn by T.
F. Bonnet, E. I>. Fitzgerald, Barclay
Henley, Jerome Deasy, the man who
moved," and. numerous others.
WAITED FOR MAOUIRE.
The Thirtieth District Democratic
Club Addressed by Its Candi
date for Governer.
After waiting three hours the Thirtieth
District Maguire Club was enthused by
a speech from their candidate for Gov
ernor. Judge Maguire arrived at the hall
of the San Francisco Athletic Club short
ly before 11 o"clock and was greeted by
cheers from the 500 or more people pres
ent.
Two anvils, which had been placed on
the speakers' stand, attracted Judge Ma
guire's attention, and he spoke of his
early life when he had gained a living
as a blacksmith. He said that although
he had forsaken the anvil for an easier
job he Btill remembered the time when
he was engaged in manual labor, and that
he always had a warm spot in his heart
for one who toiled for a living. Mr. Ma
guire paid his respects to General W. H.
L. Barnes, the Southern Pacific and his
opponent for gubernatorial honors. The
lateness of the hour, he said, would pre
vent his discussing the issues of the cam
paign, but he spoke at some length on
the Spanish-American war and territorial
expansion.
D. V. Dennehy, the president of the
club, presided, and introduced thf fol
lowing speakers: E. J. Marks, Roel B.
Terry, X D. F. Bartlett, Al Fritz, F. J.
Burke, J. A. Carroll, Edward Hanrahan,
J. A. Browne, Walter Gallagher, J. F.
Twig's. J. D. Phelan, Dr. Ragan, Edward
L. Hutchison, H. J. McCraney, E. I.
Woodman, J. P. Dunn and James H.
Barry.
"THE WOSKINGMAN'B FRIEND."
Mayor Phelan Posed as Such Before
an Audience of Wage-Workers
Last Night.
The Democrats of the Forty-fourth
District met in Apollo Hall, 810 Pacific
street, last night to hear speeches from
Mayor Phelan and other Democratic can
didates. The hall was but partially
filled, but a mob of email boys in the
gallery made enough noise to keep up an
appearance of enthusiasm.
Franklin K. Lane was the first speaker
of the evening, and told the same story
that he has been telling three times every
night for the past week: "The Demo
cratic nominees are of the people and for
the*people; those on the Republican ticket
are of the corporations, for the cc-rpora
tions and against the people." The office
to which he aspires Is a very important
one, and he declares that if elected he
will make San Francisco the chief city
of the country.
Mr. Phelan" arrived shortly after Mr.
Lane had finished his speech, but as mem
bers of the band were temporarily ab
sent from the room the customary ode of
"Hail to the Chief" was not played on
his entrance, but the small boys in the
gallery got the tip and whistled long and
loud. Sir. Phelan realised that he was
speaking to an audience of workingmen.
and of course posed as the friend of the
toiler and the enemy of the corporation
which gives him work. According, to his
speech he had never sought the nomina
tion. His friends had asked him to serve
another term, and he felt It his duty to
lay aside all personal preferences and
serve another term. He did not come be
fore tlie general public with the feeling
that he is "one whit better than any
other man," but as "the head of a clean,
honest ticket ami asrainst the combined
bosses of both tickets. " He characterized
the Republican nominees as "sneaks who
are goiiiK around telling lies " about him,
and openly denounced them as '"liars."
He Is opposed to the limitation of the
liquor traffic and the closing of business
plftcos on Sunday as an "encroachment
on the rights of the people."
George H. Oambitz. Theodore F. Bon
net, Dr. Washington Dodge, Lewis F.Bying

speeches. ___________^
JOSEPH P. KELLY
ON THE DEMOCRACY
TELLS OF ITS WANING POWER
AS A PARTY.
Speaks of James H. Barry as a
"Hypocrite" and Outlines and
Condemns His Character.
Joseph P. Kelly, independent candidate
for CongTess in the Fourth District, de
livered an address at Drews Hall last
evening on the Democratic party and the
condition of Democracy g-enerally. In it
he aimed to place before the voting citi
zens in the Fourth District a true and
unprejudiced portrayal of the corruptions
upon which the Democratic party is
based.
"There is nothing in this party to-day,
so far as honesty of purpose and purity
of motive is concerned," said he. "Es
sentially speaking, there is no Democratic
party in this State, and the voters who
once claimed allegiance to Democratic
principles are now voting irrespective of
party fealty for the best and most honest
of candidates. It is now the best man
that receives the votes of all reputable
citizens. Bossism of to-day is not the
same as it was a few years ago. The
ruling power of Democracy now is what
has been fittingly designated 'the com
mittee of 100 Job-chasers.' In the appoint
ment of this 100 men what do we see?
What has been the consequent result of
such politics,? Twenty-two of the very
people who have a monopoly of the power
are provided with places on the Demo
cratic ticket. This committee has virtu
ally converted itself into a convention to
run the Democratic party in the further
ance of individual interests.
"It seems an outrage that- a number of
men should band themselves together and
say that they are the only honest Dem
ocrats in the municipality.
"I, as a man and as a citizen, dispute
their presumption in attempting to dis
franchise me or any other man from
having a voice in local government
"My primary reason for running for
Congress from the Fourth District is to
defeat, or at least attempt to defeat, a
man who never was a Democrat, but
who is now representing himself as such.
This man is James H. Barry, editor of
the Weekly Star. By his own words he
has proved the justness and the truth
of my assertion that he never was a
member of the Democratic party, al
though now he tries to deny this to gain
the votes of the public.
"It is a deplorable thing that religious
prejudices should be brought before the
public as one of the issues of a political
campaign. But it is just and right for
every decent citizen to know now that
Mr. Barry was a stanch supporter of one
of the most self-convicted and avowed
A. P. A.'s that ever was placed in nom
ination for office. This man was no
other than Kinney, the well-known poli
tician.
"If Barry, entertaining and declaring
such principles as these, should accept
the election to the office to which he
aspires he would be guilty of base dis
honesty. I would like to ask Mr. Barry
four questions," said the speaker, "to be
answered through the public press. They
are:
" 'Whether in 1884 he did not become a
member of a society closely allied to the
American Protective Association?'
" 'Whether the ruling principles of this
society were not identical with those of
the A. P. A.?'
" 'Whether or not the night of his in
itiation he made one of the most caustic,
vilifying and disgusting anti-Catholic
speeches ever made against this or any
other religion?'
" 'Whether Dr. Tannier did not call on
Barry when he was the only printer in
San Francisco who would publish Ma
guire's book against tb" Pope?' "
The speaker here outlined McNab's pol
icy in withdrawing his nomination for
Congress in favor of Barry. TO exemplify
the declared hypocrisy of Barry. Kelly
read a number of articles from the Star in
which the editor attacked McNab in scur
rilous language, caning him Gavin Mc-
Scab and characterizing him as "one of
Buckley's bleeding lambs."
"This" attack," said the speaker, "was
made in 1891; and 1898 Barry accepts the
discarded bone that McNab has deigned
to throw to him.
"As far as I am concerned," Kelly con
tinued, "possessed as I am of the am
bitions of a young man, there is nothing
on this earth, or above, that could In
duce me to accept the nomination as
Barry has done when confronted with
such revolting and disgusting truths of
past conduct and present traits of char
acter. The Examiner has also come out
in flaring eulogies of Barry as the clean
upright and only honest man that could
possibly be selocted\ to represent the
Fourth District. Such praise of a man
whose every word, written or oral, haa

MAHONEY PROVED TOO CLEVER.
He Was Awarded a Decision Over
Jack Dennis Before the Hart
ford Club Last Night.
Paddy Mahoney, a pupil of Jimmy An
thony, was awarded a decision over Jack
Dennis, of the Olympic Club at the Hart
ford Athletic Club's monthly exhibition
last night. Dennis was over weight and
did most of the leading up to the fifth
round. Mahoney, under instructions,
sailed in and hit his opponent wherevei
he pleased, and was warded the fight in
the eighth round. Mahoney did clever
work throughout the bout and created a
good impression.
M. Meyers of the California Athletic
and Swimming Club knocked "Kid" Swei
ger of the Jefferson Athletic Club to the
floor in the first round of their go,
and the police were about to stop the
bout when the gong sounded.
At the opening of the second round
Meyers flew at Sweiger and landed a
number of blows, when Sergeant Blank
stopped the argument. Meyers was given
the decision.
The six-round bout between Billy Hogan
of the Hartford Athletic Club and Billy
Murphy of the Princeton Athletic Club
was interesting from start to finish. Both
boys fought hard and fair. In the fifth
round Hogan knocked Murphy flat on his
back wtih a straight left, and for a mo
ment Murphy was groggy. He came to
quickly, however, and renewed the fight
with vigor. Referee McLaughlin awarded
ed the decision to Hogan.
Joe Kennedy and a Mr. Craig furnished
four rounds of excitement, and as usual
politicians stepped into the ring and de
livered speeches.
OONCEBT TO S. J. SANDY.
Metropolitan Temple Crawded With
Friends of the Well-Known
Singer.
The testimonial concert tendered S. J.
Sandy (one of the leading singers at St.
Mary's Cathedral) last evening was both
an artistic and financial success. Metro

C. L. Patton Addresses
a Big Meeting.
MANY CANDIDATES SPEAK
MORGENSTERN EXCORIATES
YELLOW JOURNALS.
Patton Says It Is a Case of "Phelan
and His Money Against
Patton and H<Â°
Friends."
The Republicans of the Forty-fifth Dis
trict held a very enthusiastic meeting at
Garibaldi Hall last night, James Carr pre
siding. Among the speakers were:
Charles L. Patton, I>. E. McKinlay, A. J.
Morgenstern, Julius Kahn. Judge Murphy,
I. J. Truman, Asa R. Wells, John D.
Fiebe, J. B. Carson, Judge Joachimsen,
William S. Fitzgerald and others.
1\ E. McKinlay. in a forcible speech,
made plain t" the voters the necessity to
Republican Congressmen at this
on, and cited as the principal reason
the great and beneficial effects that have
Hon. D. E. McKUo'ay.
followed the passage of the Republican
tariff hill, as compared to the measure
that was Riven the people by Cleveland
and his Congress. His remarks were
greeted with cheers.
A. J. Morgenstern followed with some
warm Btat< yarding yellow jour
nalism in this city. He Bald:
"I Btated upon last Monday night In
Drews Hnl! In this city that there was
not a rep . â  r In the whole
of San Fr Â«eas supporting
Mr. James 1 <. Phelan in his effort to con
tinue an office-holder in this city and
county. I repeat that statement to you
to-night. It certainly requires no argu
ment upon my part to convince you that
the Examiner is not a rf-putable news
paper, and his only additional newspaper
support comes from the Bulk-tin. I said
upon last Monday night that I had been
Informed by a close friend of Mr. Phelan
that two years ago he had paid for the
support of the Bulletin, and if that state
ment is true, then the Bulletin is not a
reputable newspaper. Th<-> Bulletin, not
withstanding that The Call published tnat
Statement upon Tuesday morning, re
mained silent and made no denial of its
truth upon Tuesday. In the issue of
Wednesday Mr. Phelan publishes an open
letter, In which he states that he has not
paid to the Bulletin any money nor made
any promises to them for what they are
doing to advance his campaign. Note the
distinction. The r..arpf was that tne
money was paid for the support two years
ago. The denial is that no money nor
promises have been made for what is
being done now. This statement, I repeat
to you, gentlemen, comes from a man
who 1b a friend of Mr. Phelan, who was
active in his support two years ago and
who is now upon the Phelanâ so-called â
Democratic ticket.
"Mr. Phelan t>M!s you that 'platforms
are ordinarily springs, to catch woodcocks,
molasses to catch flies; that if the can
didates upon the Republican ticket break
their pledges those who nominated them
will cry that they could not hold them
after election.' Gentlemen, do you be
lieve that Mr. Pfttton would make a
pledge to break it? Do you believe that
Henry S. Martin, Asa R. Wflls, I. J.
Truman, D. J. Murphy, Albert Heyer, Dr.
Kearney and men of that stamp make
pledge* to break them or that they are
rvlle tools of any man? If you do,
then believe that the Examiner and that
Mr. Phelan speak the truth. If you do
not br'ieve that of these eminently re
â¢pectabifl gentlemen, then believe that
Mr. Phelan and that his foul support,
the Examiner have lied and are lying
for the purpose at deceiving you.
'â¢I should Ilk" also to direct your at
tention to the fact that Mr. Phelan de
clared on Saturday night last at a meet
ing in the- Thirty-first Assembly District,
that the reason why the Democratic party
held no primary election was that the
Supreme Court had declared the primary
election law unconstitutional, and that
there was consequently do primary elec
tion law, and no protection could be af
forded to voters at a primary election.
This statement Is, upon Its face, either
a false statement or one made in total
Ignorance of the law. The Porter primary
law is still in full force and effect, con
taining provisions fur the severe punish
ment of any violation of the primary
election law, and the only necessary step
to the invocation of the protection of that
law at a primary election 1b that the
primary be held under its provisions, that
Is, that the party holding the primary
election should do so under the provisions
of that act, by so specifying in its call
tor the election. It was not the fact of
absence of legal protection that influenced
Mr. Phelan and his gang of job-chasers
against the holding of a primary, but the
fact that he feared to place himself be
fore the voters of his own party, fearing,
and with good reason, that ho could not
renominate himself." v _.i.-; _-
Mr. Mel-Onlay's remarks were followed
by ringing cheers.
Julius Kahn, candidate for Congress in
the Fourth District, in a brieÂ£j?peech told
the voters why patriotism ana loyalty to
the party should cause them to support
the national administration by voting the
Republican ticket from start to finish in
order that after the battle had been
fought the news could be flashed to
Washington that California had swung
solidly into the Republican column.
Ex-Judge 1). J. Murphy spoke at Borne
length, telling of the merits of the candi
dates on the Republican ticket and di
lating upon the excellent features of. the
party platform which the leading Demo
cratic paper had declared to be the best
ever presented to the people of thlscltj.
During the course of Judge Murphy s re
marks John Callender. a colored man.
arose in the audience and stated that
while the Judge was District Attorney he
had convicted the speaker, but that tne
punishment was only just. , Instead 01
having any ill feeling toward Mr. Murph>
he declared that he would secure the
votes of many colored men for him. me
Judge and the colored man. whose ppreen
was quite dramatic, shook hands ana tne
audience cheered. Â , ty . o
I. J. Truman briefly addressed the
meeting and referred to the fact that
Mayor Phelan had to go into the coloniz
ing business In order to get men in tne
various sections who would take "Hier*
from him as Supervisors. Thanks to .The
Call, this scheme of Mr. Phelan had been
exposed and the voters would remember
these facts when the time came to vote.
When Charles L. Patton, RePâ¢ Â«"}
candidate for Mayor, appeared, he received
a great oration and gracefully acknowl
edged the compliment. Mr. p , at n / JrllJ rlI
ticularly Impressed upon the minds ims
hearers the fact that the Republican
nicipal platform was the best ever offered
the citizens of San Francisco. He said it
was as full free and fair as could be
made and that he stood â 9Â«Â«^JgS2
every plank In it. The new <*a aret _ cr d "MI
become a law because it was a decided
improvement upon the Pâ¢**"* "t"^* 1
machinery. He believed the next Legis
lature would adopt It and declared that
he was in favor of a dollar tax on a valu
ation of 000,000. The city could
be run on this sum without reducing
the wages of its employes. He would like
to have the power to enforce an eight
hour law that provided a minimum wage
of $2 per day because he believed the city
would be more prosperous under such con
di- t 'l"am in favor of this plank in the plat
form " said Mr. Fntton, "and if I am
elected 1 pledge myself not to sign any
contract unless this provision of eight
hours and J2 per day shall be a part of
the document. Mr. Phelan says that 135
per month is enough for janitors working
In the City Hall, but they are not his
kind of people. When Mr. Phelan and the
rest of the Democracy tell you that this
contest is between Kelly, Crimmtns,
Rainey. Buckley. Herrln and others, ho
and they tell you what is not true. Not
one. of those men knows what my official
acts will be. As a matter of fact this
contest is between Mr. Phelan and his
money and Charles L. Patton and his
friends."
Mr. Patton promised to give "an honest,
clear, upright, business administration,"
if elected, and retired amid cheers that
rattled the windows.
The other speakers made short, pithy
speeches and were cordially received.
RICHMOND VOTERS.
They Hold a Non-Partisan Meeting
and Listen to Candidates.
Richmond District Independent Club
was the rendezvous of nearly all the can
didates of both parties at a meeting held
at Clement street and Fourth avenue last
night. Robert Haight had the honor of
presiding.
From tho enthusiasm manifested for
the Republican nominees Richmond will
doubtless give a good majority to the
nominees of that party.
Charles L. Patton was tho first to be
Introduced to the meeting, and was the
signal for round after round of applause,
which took the form of an ovation. He
briefly stated the line of duty he will pur- j
sue when elected Mayor of San Fran- j
clsco. His remarks were brief as It was
not on the programme for any of the
candidates to make speeches, but rather
that they present themselves for the
voters' benefit, yet he made a telling hit
against "hefting Jimmy's" declaration of
Interest In the workingman, by repeating
Mayor Phelan's remarks before the Board
of Supervisors at a time when the duties
of the janitors of the City Hall were
under discussion.
Mayor Pheian at that time said that
175 a" month was too much for janitors.
All he paid his janitors for looking after
the property that his father left him was
$35 a month. This he considered enough.
Patton assured his hearers that he
would insist on eight hours as being a
day's â  work and nothing less than $2
j should be paid to any laborer. (Cheers
and applause.)
Attorney General W. F. Fitzgerald,
nominee for City and County Attorney,
received a most flattering reception. He
gave an account of his actions at the time
! that it was sought to introduce convict
cut stone into the Affiliated Colleges build
ings. This movement he stopped by de
c-lining to approve of the contract.
He assured the people that if elected
h<- would insist that all public contracts
contain the cjauteâ eight hours' work.
nothing less than $2 for the service, and
California material to be used.
He favored the city owning its own gas,
water and street railroads.
J. B. Carson, Republican nominee for
Superior Judge, spoke a few words, after
which Slg M. Bettman, Republican nom
inee for State Senator, and H. H. Davis,
Independent candidate for the same office,
made their bows .and short addresses.
<; W. Collins. Republican nomine" for
Supervisor of the Eighth Ward, appeared
and w;us warmly received. His address
wn= short and to the point.
Justices of the Peace F. H. Kerrigan
and Joseph E. Barry were presented and
well received. Barry promised to tie
every marriageable couple in the Rich
mond district free of charge who should
apply to him during the n<-xt two months.
Police judges Conlan and Mogan were
accorded a very pleasant reception, and
Thomas F. Graham. Republican nominee
for Police Judge, made a short address,
as did also R. H. Webster, Republican
nominee for Superintendent of Schools.
The Introduction of W. A. Deane, nom
inee for County Clerk, was the signal for
a burst of applause, seconded only to that
given for H. S. Martin. Deane spoke but
a short tim<\ and had the audience with
him throughout.
H. S. Martin, Republican candidate for
Sheriff, fairly captured, not only the
lobby, but the ladies, who arose and made
him welcome. Martin's popularity In
Richmond Is to some extent due to his
splendid management of thf French Hos
pital of which he is one of the head offi
cials.
Frank Murasky, Democratic nominee
for Superior Judge, made a favorable im
pression.
CHEERED FOR PATTON.
; Workingmen Listen to the Repub
lican Candidate for Mayor.
"Washington Hall. 85 Eddy street, was
too small to hold the gathering of Repub
licans who assembled there last night
and the anterooms and hallway leading
to the large meeting place were pressed
| into service. The occasion was markr-,1
! by the presence of all the Republican can
i didates of note, and speeches by them
wr-re listened to and cheered. When
Frank Bell, chairman of the meeting,
rappod for order breathing room was at a
premium.
Charles L.. Patton was introduced to the
audience, and they attested to his popu
larity by rising to their feet and rheer
lng for nearly five minutes. During his
remarks they paid the deepest attention
and showed their approval by repeated
outbursts of enthusiasm. Throughout the
meeting the same fueling was displayed.
Judge D. J. Murphy, candidate for Dis
trict Attorney, also received an ovation
and for ten minutes he spoke on the im
portance of the office he aspired to and
what the citizens of this city could ex
pect if he was elected. I. J. Truman was
a late arrival, but was given a cordial re
ception. He devoted a portion of his
speech to enlightening those present on
the methods employed by James D. Phe
lan and his committee of "100 Job-chas
ers." His remarks were cutting and to
the point.
Mr Truman stated that if he were
elected to the office of Trpa,surer there
would be no "hefting," nor would citizens
be in danger of losing sleep worrying
about the money in his care. Ho also
dwelt on the expose of Mayor Phelan's
colonization scheme, and closed with a
hope that the whole ticket from Henry T.
Gage down would be elected.
Among the other candidates to address
the meeting were: Edward I. Sheehan,
Jienry Martin, Judge Low, Mr. Phelpa,

Starved His Horses.
L. "Wachter, who keeps a hog ranch
noar the Four-Mile House on the San
Bruno road, was arrested yesterday by
Officer Hooper for cruelty to his horses.
The two animals he uses to haul swill
to his hogs are so poor they can hardly
walk. The officer says that the man is
able to care for his horses, but that he
is too stingy to give them hay enough
to keep them alive.

nothing else but a surrender to the enemy
almost before the battle has begun. If the mld
roul'Ts are not to have a place on the State
ticket, I for one shall not be forced to sup

honorable for the straight Populists, In order
to preserve the party, to support and help
elect the State Republican ticket, for If the
fusion-Democrats win the Populist party will
be virtually dead in this State and never can
be resurrected.
.We cannot kill fusion by supporting it at the
polls. I am willing to support an honorable
amalgamation with all the reform forces on
a union platform, but such a damnable swap
ping and dickering by a few office seekers as
was done at Sacramento in July I think
thould be rebuked by not voting with them.
I think It best for the straight Populists. In
order to preserve the party, to go on the ticket
by petition; otherwise to mi port the Republican
State ticket. The principles of the Populist
party are rightâ eternally right. They are con
ditions brought about by changes and circum
stances. They are progressive and evolution
ary, and are destined to be crystallized into
the organic laws of the land, If not by evolu
tion, then revolution must be the consequence.
Hence, the duty of the hour Is to vote with
the Republicans Instead of the Democrats. I>>t
us hear from the Populists throughout the
State on the subject. The time is short.

seventy-nine names, and then he filed his
petition.
Unfortunately for Mr. Byers, there are
some objections to his going before the
district as a candidate for Supervisor.
His petition should have had ninety-five
names, and then again Mr. Byers does not
even resideâ ln fact, has not even a Mur

ST. PAUL, Oct. 20.â -Reports from the
wheat fields of North Dakota and Mani
toba to-night are of a most discourag
ing character. It has been either rain-
Ing or snowing nine days. In Manitoba
only about 8,000,000 bushels of wheat of
a crop of 26,000,000 bushels has been
thrashed, and the balance standing in
stacks and shocks is threatened with
destruction. The farmers almost de
spair of saving the balance of these
crops.
The barley and oat crops are also all

standing crop would be rendered unfit
for even hog feed. The loss in North
Dakota and. the Red River Valley is
estimated at 20,000,000 to 25,000,000 bush
els.
MINNEAPOLIS, Oct. 20.â The rain
and snow throughout Red River Valley
and North Dakota caught many of the j
farmers with grain unthrashed and the
prospect is that much of it will remain
in stack until spring. This is especially
the case in interior townships and lo
calities at a distance from the railways
and villages. Just what the loss will
be it is impossible to estimate, but it
is safe to say the greater portion of
that which remains in stack through
out the winter will be of little value ex
cept for fodder.
Samples of wheat brought to this city
which had been exposed to rain for the
past few days were so bleached and ]
swollen as to resemble the Washington ;
and Oregon product. Such grain will I
have to be dried out and cleaned before j
its value can be determined. Estimates |
on the number of bushels thus affected
in Manitoba are 7,000,000. On the rame
basis 10,000.000 to 15,000,000 bushels
would be damaged in Red River Val
ley and North Dakota, and the total
loss will amount to several million dol
lars.
The bad weather has very materially
affected general movement of the
crop. Farmers are unable to come to
market and elevator men cannot han
dle the crop expeditiously. Many of
the mills in the Northwest are runnine
da- and night, and the stock on hand
has been considerably reduced. All in
all the Northwestern crop has largely
deteriorated from the early estimates.

JORDAN OPPOSED
TO IMPERIALISM
Stanford's President Makes a Bold
Argument Before the Liberal
Congress of Religion
at Omaha.
OMAHA, Oct. 20.â A bold argument
against imperialism was made by Presi
dent David Starr Jordan of Stanford Uni
versity at this evening's session of thÂ«
Liberal Congress of Religion, and it was
listened to by a crowded church. Summed
up. It was to the effect that a policy of
expansion would make incumbent
upon this country an expensive
colonial system with all that that im
plies of a costly army and navy;
that our Government system would have
to be largely changed from American re
publicunism to British imperialism; that
the pursuits of war would take the place
of our pursuits of peace: that it is not
suited to this country; that living in the
tropics degenerates the Anglo-Saxon
character, and finally, that this nation,
stands for an ideal of individual citizen
ship, which is a higher purpose for hu
manity than national aggrandizement.
Professor Jordan's paper was entitled
"Lest We Forget." from Rudyard Kip
ling's hymn, the "Recessional.'

FOR THE SET-TO
WITH ENGLAND
PARIS, Oct. 20.â The al
leged war preparations of
France in connection with
the Fashoda incident are
the absorbing topic of dis
cussion here. According to
the French papers there
were important naval ex
periments at Toulon last
evening. A flotilla of tor
pedo-boats was detailed to
make an endeavor to force
the entrance of the harbor,
and the whole garrison was
called to arms and the forts
and batteries were manned,
ready for instant action.
The result of the experi
ments has not been made
public.
Vice Admiral Barrera pre
sided yesterday at a secret
council of war at Brest, in
which the chiefs ot the
maritime forces took part.
Confidential orders were
subsequently issued to the
garrison.
LONDON NEWSPAPERS
NOW VERY CAUTIOUS
LONDON, Oct. 21.â The London
morning papers have cooled down to
an exceedingly cautious and conserva
tive tone in dealing with the Fashoda
question, apparently realizing that the
public on both sides of the channel is
heated to the danger point. There is a
marked effort to avoid an offensive
tone.
The Times says: "Sir Michael Hicks-
Beach has gone some way to persuade
our neighbors that we really mean what
we say. The time has come when it is
absolutely necessary to dispel French
dreams on this subject, unless very
dangerous consequences are to result,
but 'the Chancellor of the Exchequer
might have performed th operation
more dexterously."
The Daily News, which voices the
general feeling, says: "The country is
determined to maintain its rights, but
there is no occasion to provoke our
opponents or to add fuel to the con
troversy."
NAVAL RESERVES

SUCCESSFUL "WOOD DRIVE.
Vast Quantity Reaches Keswick
From a Long Distance.
REDDING, Oct. 20.â A solution of the
wood transportation problem was reached
Tuesday by the successful termination of
a seventy-five mile drive of 15,000 cords
down the Pit and Sacramento rivers to
Keswick, where it was boomed and de
livered to the Mountain Copper Com
pany.
Since the opening of spring 150 men have I
been employed in cutting wood on a heav- !
ily timbered plateau in the big bend of
Pit River. As fast as sufficiently dry the
wood was shot into the river by means j
of immense chutes and permitted to drift !
at will along the stream. When the sea
son's cut had been placed in the water
a large crew of expert river men followed |
down the stream and dislodged the fuel I
that had been caught in the eddies and !
on the shallows. The river crew finished ;
its work yesterday. While there was a
large percentage of loss, the experiment
is considered a success, and the wood
cutting farce will work throughout the
winter.
The great copper smelting plant at Kes
wick is an enormous consumer of fuel,
both wood and coke. Lately three ves
sels arrived in San Francisco from Enp
land loaded with coke exclusively for the
Mountain Copper Company, and the
Southern Pacific Company has since been
running special trains in delivering- the
fuel to Keswick.

Something Must Now Be Done to
Stop the Spread of All
Classes of Disease at
Hawaii.
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1698, by James Gor
don Bennett.
HAVANA, Oct. 20.â An agreement
i between the two commissions as to the
| date of evacuation again seems prob
able. As stated in a recent cable, the
American ultimatum is January 1, and
j this date will be finally accepted by
the Spaniards. General Butler to-day
called upon General Parrado, and an
informal conference was held, as a re
sult of which the American Commis
sioners believe there will be an early
meeting in joint session for ratifying
the date of evacuation.
The committee to-day served notice
on Mr. Hamlll, who purchased the cop
! per and bronze guns sold at auction,
j that the American Government would
I contest the legality of the sale, and he
; would dispose of the guns at his own
risk. A New York agent who was
about to deposit a draft for $100,000 to
purchase the guns from Hamill, was
also warned and later refused to com
plete the deal.
Rumors have been afloat for several
days in regard to friction between Gen
eral Blanco and the Madrid Govern
ment over finances. It was also re
ported that the Madrid authorities had
I ordered General Blanco to refuse to
j evacuate Cuba until the Philippine
j question was settled. I can deny both
1 stories on authority. General Blanco
I steadfastly refuses to give interviews
and has given only two since Febru
ary, both to The Call and the Herald.
But from one so close to him that his
assertions may be considered inspired,
j I learn that the Queen Regent fully
i approves everything General Blanco
| has done, and relies implicitly upon his
i advice in matters pertaining to Cuba.
i There has been no friction and no or
! der to delay evacuation. General
| Blanco refuses to tell any one whin
: he will leave Cuba, but it is safe to say
, the Madrid Government will keep him
i here until the linal formalities have
' been concluded.
Thut something must be done to stop
the spread of all classes of disease
seems evident. Dr. Hi'iinner >y-Â« just
forwarded to Washington a complete
report on the mortality of HAvana from
January 1 to October 13, His figures
are enough to strike horror to the
hearts of those contemplating visiting
the city. Fevers are still on the in
crease. Dr. Brunner's figures deal
only with the city proper. The mili
tary hospitals in the suburbs would
add materially to the totals.
In spite of the fact that Havana was
considered practically free from yellow
fever this year, eighteen died from that
disease during July, twenty in August,
tv. Â»*:iiy-three in September and seven
teen in the first thirteen days of Octo
ber. The increase of typhoid fever is
startling, as shown by the following
list of deaths: Fifty-seven in June;
eighty-seven in July; 127 in August;
136 in September and sixty-nine in the
first thirteen days of October. The
fever is generally caused by a lack of
food, and might be written "starva
tion." It has caused 2408 deaths. Since
January 201 have died as the direct re
sult of starvation. Those who have
heard that Havana climate is good fur
tuberculosis Will be interested in learn
ing that 2243 died from that disease
this year. The total number of deaths,
846, in October, a usually fairly
healthy month, shows the increase of
all diseases.
SPANISH SOLDIERS
WANT TO BE DISCHARGED
HAVANA, Oct. 20.â The American
Military Commission has been informed
that a great number of discharges have
been applied for by Spanish Boldiers
and officers since the publication of
Captain General Blanco's decree an
nouncing that such applications would
ho granted. Tht- total number of Span
ish soldiers who have made application
for absolute discharge from the army
before the final evacuation takes place
is now estimated to have reached 15.000.

of either the Democratic <>r Republican

ber 2, 1898, appointing us a board to point
the positions of ships of Admiral Cer
vera's squadron and those of the United
States fleet in the battle of July 3, 1898,
off Santiago de Cuba, we have the honor
to submit the following report, accom
panied by a chart, showing thÂ«! positions
of the ships at seven different times.
2. These times, as taken by the I. nited
States ships engaged, with the incidents
noted, are as follows:
No. 1, 9:35 a. m.â Maria Teresa came out
of the harbor.
No. 2, 9:50 a. m.â Pluton came out.
No. 3, 10:15 a. m.â Maria Teresa turned
to run ashore. . .
No. 4, 10:20 a. m.â Oquendo turned to run
ashore. ,
No. 5, 10:30 a. Furor blew up and
Pluton turned to run ashore.
No. 6, 11:05 a. m.â Vizcaya turned to run
ashore. , .
No. 7, 1:15 p. m.â Colon surrendered.
3. The chart selected by the board for
plotting is H. O. chart No. 716, ISSp, West
Indies, eastern chart of Bahama Islands,
with part of Cuba and north coast of ban
Domingo. This selection was made after
careful comparison with all other charts
at hand, as the positions of the principal
! headlands and fnlets and the distances
I between them on it agree more nearly
I with the observation of the members of
the board than those given by any other.

The foregoing report needs the accom
panying chart to make clear what were
the positions of the Spanish during the
famous battle of Santiago on July 3.
Measurements upon the charts showing
the positions of the vessels at the speci
fied times named in the report will give
as fair an Idea of the work of the board
if can be made without the chart itself.

FOR KILLING A CHINAMAN.
Harry Clark, a LO3 Angeles Youth,
on Trial for His Life.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 20.â Harry ClarÃ,
a young lad, was placed on trial for his
life this morning. He is accused of kill
ing Wong Sing Hay, a laundryman of
Garvanza, with a shotgun to secure the
few dollars he had in his pocket. Several
days after the crime Clark, who had dis
appeared, was found hiding In the cellar
vessels were as follows: The New York
having come within three miles of Morro,
being southeast of that point. The
.Brooklyn was two and a half miles south
and west of the Teresa and one and
three-tenths miles directly south of the
Colon, one and one-tenth miles and a lit
tle behind the Vizcaya, one and
three-tenths miles and a little in
advance of the Oquendo. The Texas
was one and two-tenths miles from and
behind the next Spanish ship, the Oquen
do. The lowa was one and one-tenth
miles from the Teresa and a little closer
in, but not as far west as the Texas. The
Oregon had pulled up and passed the
Texas and lowa, being a little further
inshore than the Texas and a little fur
ther out than the lowa. She was in ad
vance of the Teresa, being one and seven
tenths miles from that vessel, six-tenths
of a mile from and directly in line of
the Oquendo, seven-tenths of a mile from
the Colon and one and two-tenths miles
behind the Vizcaya. The Indiana was two
miles from the Texas and two and six
tenths miles from the Oquendo, the near
est Spanish vessel. The Gloucester had
moved up six-tenths of a mile and was
Just a mfle directly south of Morro.
Position No. 4,10:20 a. m.â Oquendo turned
to run ashore. Only five minutes elapsed
from position No. 3. All vessels had been
running westward without material
changes in their positions. The Colon had
run one and three-tenths miles, the Viz
caya about one-tenth of a mile less and
swerved to the left, bringing her to one
and one-tenth miles of the Brooklyn. The
lowa was the same distance, but directly
astern, and the Oregon was one and three
tenths miles from the Vizcaya, but fur
ther out to sea. The lowa, eight-tenths
of a mile from the Oquendo, had gone
nine-tenths miles from the same vessel,
and both seemed in advance of the
doomed Spanish ship. The Indiana had
advanced eight-tenths of a mile and was
two and six-tenths miles away from the
< âºquendo, the nearest Spanish ship. The
New York had advanced nearly a mile,
but was not yet abreast of Morro. The
Gloucester had run over two miles and
was northwest of Morro.
Position No. 5, 10:30 a. m.â Furor blew
up and Pluton turned to run ashore. This
is ten minutes later than position No. 4.
The Gloucester had run a little more than
two miles and was four-tenths of a mile
from the Furor and but little further
from the Pluton. The New York had run
two and two-tenths milus, and was three
and three-tenths miles from the Furor,
the nearest Spanish ship, and two and
two-tenths miles south and a little west
of Morro. The Colon had run two and
nine-tenths miles and the Vizcaya two
and seven-tenths miles. The Brooklyn
had run two and three-tenths miles, and
was one and two-tenths miles from the
Vizcaya, and one and six-tenths miles
from the Colon, which was running nearer
the shore. The Oregon had sailed two
und a half miles, and was one and one
half miles from the Vizcas'a and about
the Rame distance from the Colon. The
Texas was one and two-tenths miles
astern of the Oregon, two and four-tenths
miles from the Oregon. The Indiana was
one and one-half miles astern of the
Texas.
Position No. 6, 11:05 a. m.â Vizcaya
turned to run ashore. In the thirty-five
minutes the Vizcaya had sailed about Bix
miles and was off the mouth of the As
seradora River. The Colon had run live
and one-half miles further, and was more
than that distance in advance of the
Spanish vessels. The Brooklyn was one
and three-tenths miles distant from the
Vizcaya and slightly behind her. The
TeKBM was two and seven-tenths miles
from the Vizcaya and directly astern of
the Oregon. The lowa was three and
two-tenths miles directly astern of the
Vizcaya. The New York was five miles
behind the lowa. The Ericsson had kept
along- with the New York all the time,
and was, at this position, one-half a mile
in advance of her. The Indiana was near
ly four miles behind the lowa.
Position No. 7, 1:15 p. m.â The Colon sur
renders. In the two hours and ten min
utes from the last position given the ves
sels had coursed westward a great dis
tance. The Colon had run twenty-six and
a. half miles and was off Tarquiho River.
The Brooklyn was the nearest American
vessel. She had sailed twenty-eight and a
half miles, and was three and four-tenth
miles from the Colon. Tfie Oregon was
four and a half miles from the Colon and
more inshore than the Brooklyn. The
Te:.as was three and four-tenth miles be
hind the Oregon. The New York was nine
and a half miles from the Colon. None
of the other vessels had come up, save the
Vixen, which was abreast of the New
York. This little vessel at the beginning
of the fight steamed out to sea and sailed
westward on a course about two and a
quarter miles from that of the nearest
Spanish ship. The tracings of the charts
snow that the Spanish vessels sailed on
courses not more than three-tenths of a
mile apart until the Oquendo ran ashore.
Then the Vizcaya veered out to sea and
the Colon kept nearer the shore, their
courses being about seven-tenths of a mile
apart Up to the time the Oquendo went
ashore, the lowa, Indiana, Oregon ana
Texas sailed on courses within three
tenths of a mile of each other, the lowa
being the nearest and the Texas the far
thest from the Spanish vessels. Ihe
Brooklyn's course waÂ« from three-tenths
to one half of a mile outside that of the
Texas. The swing to the right which tne
Brooklyn mad*? with the beginning of tne
engagement shows an oval Tour-tenths of
a mile across. She crossed the courses of
the Texas, Oregon and Indiana twice
while making the turn, but before these
vessels had gone over them. The course
of the. New York after passing Morro was
nearer the shore than any other United
States vessel except the Gloucester, and
a mile behind where #he Oquendo turned
to run ashore she. passed inside the
courses of the Spanish ships. Ten miles
w. st of the Vizcaya disaster she crossed
the Colon's track, but followed very clnso
the course of the vessel until the latter
surrendered. The lowa, Indiana and Er
icsson did not go farther west than
where the Vizcaya ran ashore.

CHEERED TO
VERY LAST
Vast Crowds Witness
His Departure.
TAKES FAREWELL OF CHICAGO
McKINLEY'S MOST INTERESTING
ADDRESSES.
One to Ken Who Favor Interna
tional Arbitration and the
Second to Railro o^
Employes.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Oct. 20.â President Mc-
Kinley and the members of his party
left for Washington to-night. The
crowd that has followed him every
time he has appeared in public was
with him to the last, and it required
the efforts of 150 policemen to restrain
the throng which packed the depot to
suffocation. Just as the train pulled
out, the President appeared on the
platform of the last car and bowed re
peatedly as the crowd cheered him.
The President spent much of the day
in rest and receiving friends of the
family. There were more than the us
ual number of callers.
The banquet at the Auditorium the
nie-ht previous was not permitted to
disturb the habit of early rising which
he has so closely adhered to for years.
At 8 o'clock he breakfasted and then
kept open house for Captain McWil
liams' neighbors and friends until
luncheon hour.
Mrs. McKinley has patronized the ba
zaar given by the women of the Holy
Angels Catholic church by sending a
donation for the movement. The la
dies in charge of the bazaar, wishing
to show their appreciation of the act,
this morning sent a delegation to Mrs.
McKinley, presenting her with a beau
tiful Sevres vase. The ladies were pre
sented to the President and Mrs. Me-
Kinley by Mrs. McWllliams. ::.
After luncheon President McKinley
proceeded to the First Regiment arm
ory, shortly after 1 o'clock. From the
armory he went to the . Auditorium to
meet a number of friends, and while
there was presented with a memorial
in favor of international arbitration by
the Chicago committee on arbitration,
and after listening to the reading of the
memorial he said: . '
"I am Indeed very glad to meet this
representative delegation, and give you
the assurance that the subject of your
memorial shall enlist my early and ear
nest consideration. You. are doubtless
aware that I have informed- the Czar
of Russia that the United States will be
represented in the proposed congress of
peace. I suppose It might notbeinappro
priate, when we form our commission,
to constitute it generously from Chi
cago gentlemen, who are so thoroughly
Interested in the issue with which It
will deal But we will take that up
later. I don't want it to take any of
you by surprise." ,
During the remainder of the day he
rested at the Me Williams residence un
til it was, time for his train. ..:..
During the trip to Washington the
President will make stops and- deliver
speeches at Logan sport, Indianapolis,
Columbus and Pittsburgh. , . â â¢â 
At 1:30 p. m. the President was driven
to the First Regiment armory, where,
together with Mayor Harrison, he was
received by a large gathering of rail
road employes., After the reception the
President addressed the railroad men,
eliciting from , them . the * warmest . ap
plause. The railroad reception ;at * the
armory was President McKlnley's last
public appearance in * â  Chicago Â§ during
the Jubilee^ .wet weather haying neces
sltated the postponement of the bicycle
parade.
Judge Barton Paine was one of the
chief speakers at the meeting.
The armory was crowded when the
exercises were opened with prayer by
Dr. Emil G. Hirsch. Chairman J. H.
Walsh of the Brotherhood of Locomo
tive Engineers presided and delivered
the opening address. He introduced
Mayor Harrison, who delivered the ad
dress of welcome to President MeKin
ley. The President's response was lis
tened to attentively and frequently in
terrupted with applause. Following
President McKinley came Judge John
Barton Payne of Chicago. Other speak
ers on the programme were George R.
Peck, E. K. Clark of the Order of Rail
way Conductors, F. P. Sargent of tha
Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen P.
H. Morrissey of the Brotherhood of
Railway Trainmen and P. A. Arthur of
the Brotherhood of Locomotive En
gineers.
An informal reception for the railway
men was held by the President after
the addresses. Mr. McKlnley was sta
tioned in an inclosure on the first bal
cony above the entrance, wjiere the
railway men filed by singly. As they
came up to the President, one by one,
their extended hands were grasped by
Mr. McKinley's. The men were all ad
mitted into the armory by ticket. The
distinguished guests from Washington
were present and composed the group
which surrounded the President on the
balcony.
President McKinley spoke as followi:
I count myself fortunate to have the
privilege of meeting with this great rail
way organization. I have had in the last
ten days many most pleasing and Interest
ing experiences as I have journeyed
through the country, but I assure jwu
that not one of them has given me greater
pleasure than to meet the women and men
connected with the great railroads of tha
country. (Applause.)
It is fortunate that this great body of
representative men and women has as
sembled in this c'*y at a time when tha
people were celebrating the suspension of
hostilities, with early nope of an honor
able, just and triumphant peace. Tha
railroad men of the country have always
been for the country. (Applause.) Tha
railroad men of the country have always
been for the flag of the country, and in
every crisis of our national history, in war
and in peace, the men of your great or
ganization have been loyal and faithiul
to every duty and obligation. Tours la
at once a profession of great risk and of
grave responsibility. I know of no occu
pation in the sphere of human endeavor
which carries with it greater obligations
or higher responsibilities than the profes
sion of railroad men.
You carry the commerce of the coun
try you carry the rich treasures of tha
country from the Atlantic to the Pacific,
and you carry daily and hourly tha
freightage of humanity; they trust to
you your integrity, to your intelligence
and' your fidelity for the safeguarding of
their" lives, and I congratulate the coun
try from the bottom of my heart that In
this great system so interwoven with tha
everyday life of the citizens of the re
public we have such splendid character
and such high intelligence.
I bring to you to-day not only my
good will, but I bring to you the good
will and respect of seventy millions of
American citizens. (Applause.) Tour
work is before a critical audience; you
go in and out every day before your
countrymen, and you have ever deserved
from your countrymen the unstinted
praise and approval of your fidelity to
the great interests you represent. The
virtue of the people lies at the founda
tion of the republic; the power of th%
people ie in the American fireside. Tha
virtue that comes out Â©f the holy luster
of home is the most precious gift this
nation has, and when the words of the
people meet in the home of the people
it is a command to Congress and the ex
ecutive: it is a law of the republic.
1 thank you, my fellow citizens, for your
cordial greeting, and I congratulate yoÂ»
on the evidences of returning prosperity
everywhere. (Great applause.) What yom
âwhat we allâ want Is business prosper*
ity. When you have that you have some
thing to do; when you have it not, then
you are idle. There are few empties now
on the sidetrack. (Laughter and ap
plaumv) And there are few railroad men
not employed now. (Applause.) Tha
more you see the freight car the oftener
you see the pay car. (Applause.) I am
very glad to observe that the First Illi
nois Regiment is in your presence to-day
capplause)â that gallant regiment madÂ©
ui> of the volunteers from the homes of
Chicago, who took their lives into their
own hands and went to Santiago to fight
the battle of liberty against oppression. I
am glad to have this opportunity to meet
and greet them and to congratulate and
thank them in the name of the American
people. And now, having said this much,
I hope you know that I will carry from
this place, from this audience, from these
warm-hearted men and women, the pleas
antest memory of my long trip through
the West.
At the conclusion of President Me-
Kinley's remarks the audience broke
into wild cheers, which lasted fully five
minutes. The Presidential party then
left the hall.

THE SYMPATHY

Policy of Spaniards
at Paris.
THE CUBAN DEBT THE ISSUE
SPAIN'S ANSWER EXPECTED TO
SE UNSATISFACTORY.
Dons Will Pretend That They Are
Being Crushed by the Atti
tude of the United
States.
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett.
PARIS, Oct. 20.â The critical point of
the negotiations between the United
States and Spain will be reached to
morrow, at the meeting of the Peace
Commission. Despite the arguments
which the Spanish delegates have ad
vanced in regard to the Cuban debt,
the position of the United States re
mains unchanged.
The answer of Spain was expected on
Wednesday, but the postponement un
til to-morrow gave the Madrid Govern
ment an opportunity to discusÃ the sit
uation. Its written reply to the con
ditions insisted upon by the Americans
is expected to be presented to-morrow.
It is known that while the United
States refuses to assume the obligations
of the Cuban debt or guarantee the
same, the bonds of the Cuban munici
palities will retain their validity.
Spain's answer is not expected to be
satisfactory.
The articles in the French press indi
cate that the policy on the part of
Spain is to seek to arouse the sympathy
of Europe on the ground that she is
being crushed by the United States' re
fusal to relieve her in any way of the
burden of the Cuban debt.
PITIFUL PLEA FOR
MERCY TO SPAIN
LONDON, Oct. 20.â The Paris corre
spondent of the Times says:
"I had a visit to-day from a gTeat
Spanish personage who seems to have
been commanded to ascertain the trend
of public opinion on the negotiations
here. He appeared much depressed. He
has found great and general sympathy
v.ith Spain, but was unable to discover
any possibility of obtaining moral sup
port against the American delegates,
â who are inflexible in their demands and
with much politeness of form ha^ye
hitherto categorically refused to make
the slightest concessions on any of the
instructions received by them, never
having asked their Government for the
FJlghfnst modifications.
"The intended sitting yesterday could
not be held because the Spaniards, in
view of the written replies made to
them, renounced their attempts at con
versation and asked forty-eight hours'
grace to consult their Government and
prepare a written rejoinder.
"The friend who called to tell me he
had found his countrymen much dis
couraged, being convinced that the
United States is bent on a rigorous ex
ercise of the rights of victor, remarked:
"I have heard that Prince Bismarck
once said to you: "When you have your
hand on the throat of a vanquished na
tion you can take from it all you like,
but you must always beware of abus
ing your victory and exaggerating your
conquests. Otherwise you load yourself
for many generations with a crushing
burden, which ends by havine the most
mischievous results for the victor â al
most more than for the vanquished." '
"My caller remarked:
" "TheAmericansare not adopting this
wise and humane view. They seem
bent on pushing the results of the war
to their extreme consequences. They
refuse to entertain any concession on
the Philippine question, and while de
clining to take any sovereignty in
Cuba, they maintain that the Cuban
debt is a Spanish debt, and that Spain
abused her sovereignty by saddling the
island with the Interest of a debt by
which she alone profited.
'â¢ Vainly have we urged that they
themselves accepted financial obliga
tions toward England after the war of
Independence, that they accepted the
burdens of taxes after the conquest,
that there is no more general law than
the law of the obligations of a country
changing with its rulei%, and that it
would be an arbitrary course and a
vexatious precedent to throw the
Cuban debt upon us. It Is useless, and
they stand peremptorily on their de
mands.
" 'What our delegates should say to
them, if they persist, as it is to be
feared they will, Is this: "We are In
your hands. You are the victors. We
for once committed the folly of going
to war with you because you left us no
time to avoid it; because you treated
us in such a way that even at the risk
of suicide we were bound to plunge into
â¢war, although the result of it was evi
dent to us. But we will not commit
the fresh folly of recommencing war in
any form. We are, therefore, at your
mercy. We shall submit to your dic
tates and shall leave the world to Judge
of those dictates: but no human force
will compel us to subscribe to them,
and we shall not subscribe."
"'This Is what our delegates ought to
gay on this Cuban question. As for the
other points, they will wait to hear
what they are.' "

Rev. W. H. Moreland of San Fran
cisco Among the Missionary
Bishops Chosen by the
Convention.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 20.â At the
meeting of the House of Deputies of
the Episcopal convention to-day the
following letter to the Czar of Russia
was agreed upon:
To his Majesty the Czar of Russia: The
General Convention of the Protestant
Episcopal Church, composed of Bishops,
clergymen and laymen, haib* with joy tne
great peace manifesto which your Majesty
has issued. We earnestly hope that the
conference may result in a reduction of
the excessive armaments which are a bur
den on the people and in the establish
ment of Forae method of judicial arbitra
tion for the settlement of International
difficulties by which may be preserved the
I principles of equity and right whereon
rest the security of states and the welfare
Majesty"? appeal to international
discussion will stimulate the consciences
of civilized nations and the inauguration
of this noble movement may well be con
sidered a happy presage for the century
which is about to open and mark an epoch
In the progres of the world. We earnestly
I invoke upon it the blessing of Almighty
' God and pray that it may help greatly to
hasten the coming of the kingdom of the
Prince of Peace on earth.
The letter was agreed to by a vote
of 270 to 41.
Rev. B. W. R. Taylor of Los Angeles
said that, in view of the action relative
to the Czar of Russia, it was eminently
proper that the house adopt the pend
ing resolution expressing thanks to
Great Britain for the sympathy shown
toward the United States during the
recent war with Spain.
The resolution was then adopted. It
was as follows:
Resolved, That this General Convention
of the Protestant Episcopal Church of
the United States places on record its
sense of deep gratification at the many
I manifestations of friendly feeling to our
nation which have been so freely and cor
dially shown by the Government and em
pire of Great Britain during our late war
with Spain, and express the sincere hope
that the time may speedily arrive when |
these two great nations of the Anglo- I
Saxon familyâ the United States of
America and the British empireâ shall
stand together in defense of the rights i
and liberties of mankind and for the pro- |
motion of Christian civilization among
the nations o$ the earth.
The House of Bishops to-day selected
the following missionary Bishops: For
Boise, Idaho, Rev. J. B. Funston of
Portsmouth, Va.; for Sacramento, Cal.,
Rev. W. H. Moreland of San Francisco;
North Dakota, Rev. S. D. Edsall of Chi
cago; for Presiding Bishop of Brazil,
Rev. L. L. Kinsolving of Virginia.
On the invitation of the presiding
officer the Dean of Berford addressed
the convention and expressed his hearty
thanks, as an Englishman, and for his
country, for the cordial resolution just
adopted. He rejoiced at the friendly
feeling between the two great nations.
It tended to no warlike alliance, he
said, but to that natural union between
those of common tongue and religion.
Instead of meaning war the alliance of
the two nations would do more for
i peace, the Dean said, than any other
j movement of nations.
By unanimous rote the House adopt
|ed a resolution fixing Tuesday next,
October 25, as a day for final adjourn
i ment.
The report to the House of Deputies
of the committee on the state of the
church presented a comprehensive sur
vey of the work of the last three years.
The total contributions of the last three ,
years for all purposes reached $31,541,- ;
I 178. There has been an increase of |
bishops from seventy to eighty-three, j
of clergymen from 4022 to 4380. The
number of baptisms has been 192,725;
confirmations, 134,741; communicants,
681,645. The present church sittings are
At the afternoon session the Bishops
concurred In the resolution for final ad
journment on October 25. They con
curred also In the letter to the Czar of
Russia relative to his peace conference
and in the resolution expressing ap
preciation for the sympathetic course
of Great Britain during the recent war.
The appointment of Rev. W. H.
Moreland of this city as missionary
Bishop for Sacramento will necessitate
his removal from San Francisco, where
he is at present rector of St. Luke's
Episcopal Church. He has occupied
the pulpit here for over five years, and
during his faithful labors has built up
one of the largest congregations in the
city. The honor bestowed upon him
may be said to have been well earned,
and while his congregation regrets that
his connection with St. Luke's has been
severed, it Is happy over his promo
tion.,
MESSAGES FROM SEA
BY CARRIER PIGEONS
Captain Renaud of the French Army
Comes Over to Establish a
Transatlantic Service.
NEW YORK, Oct. 20.â Welcome mes
sages will soon be flying home to anxious
friends from the big-trans- Atlantic steam
ships by means of trained pigeons. Cap
tain Gabriel Renaud, a French cavalry
officer, has arrived In New York for the
purpose of establishing a carrier pigeon
service on the French line steamships
this side of the Atlantic, such as has
been completed since last June on the
French side. As the captain nays, this
carrier pigeon service has two purposes.
There 1b a humanitarian one of allaying
the anxiety of waiting friends and rela
tives by sending messages from delayed
or disabled steamships. Then also pas
sengers can communicate with loved
oneÃ before their vessel arrives in port.
Captain Renaud has made a study of
carrier pigeons for many years. He Is
the author of several articles on the
I adaptability of trained birds submitted to
I the French Academy of Sciences, and or
! ganized last year a carrier pigeon ser-
I vice for the French army.
TO PREVENT SCALPING.
Seven Railroads Petition for an In-
junction at Chicago.
CHICAGO, Oct. 20.â The flght between
the railroads and the ticket brokers, re-
Bulting from the efforts of the former to
prevent the scalping of tickets by the lat
ter, has oeen taken Into court. Seven
railroads to-day petitioned for an injunc
tion restraining the sale by the brokers
of excursion tickets, issued by the rail
roads on account of the Peace Jubilee In
this city. k â
The petitions were presented to Master
in Chancery Learning and upon his rec
ommendation a temporary restraining or
der was issued by Judge Smith. Owing to
delay in securing the necessary- bond, ser
vice on the order will be made to-mor
row morning. The brokers against whom
the injunction is levied number thirty
two and include nearly all the down town
ticket scalpers.
Prominent aotors tell their best
stories, in next Sunday's Call.

BISHOP FOR SACRAMENTO.
NO BUTTLE WITH

Spanish Rumor Excites
Ridicule.
FILIPINOS HAVE NO NAVY
DEWEY FAILS TO MENTION
THE INCIDENT.
General Otis Cables to the War
Department as to Conditions
at Manila and Health
of His Troops.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
MANILA, Oct. 20. â Reports have
reached here of a terrible state of an
archy in the Southern Philippines. The
Spaniards there are cooped up in the
principal towns. The Americans con
tinue capturing the rebel vessels as
they arrive at Cavlte. Two have been
captured this week.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 20.â The sensa
tional Spanish report of a naval bat
tle between Admiral Dewey's vessels
and the insurgent navy in the Philip
pines is received with absolute incredul
ity in both the Navy and War depart
ments. If there has been any recent
action Admiral Dewey has failed to
mention it, and neither General Otis
nor United States Consul Wildman have
regarded it as worthy of notice.
It is believed at the Navy Depart
ment that the Spanish authorities re
fer to the seizure of the little steamer
Abbey by the McCulloch on September
23 last. The steamer was of American
register, though formerly known as the
Pasig. It was reported to Admiral
Dewey that she was bringing arms
and supplies of war to the Insurgents.
He sent the McCulloch to stop this
movement, but when the cutter found
the Abbey in Batansas Bay the vessel
had landed her cargo of arms and the
insurgents refused to give them up.
Thereupon the Abbey was seized and
taken by the McCulloch to Manila.
This affair could not be dignified with
the name of a naval engagement, and
Admiral Dewey in reporting the seizure
to the Navy . Department made little
Â°Vt t 'is just possible that there have
been some similar incidents not deemed
worthy of report in the islands of Cebu
The War Department to-day posted
the following bulletin:
Under date of yesterday General Otis
cabled the War Department:
"The situation in Luzon somewhat
improved. The influence of Filipinos of
education and property not desiring in
dependent government, but hostile to
Spain is gaining the ascendency In the
revolutionary councils. Am promising
nothing but am enforcing the law. The
complications seriously affect inter
island commerce and diminish revenue.
Affairs are progressing favorably,
though the sick report Is increasing,
owing mostly to the carelessness of en
listed men. The health' of the officers
is good. The condition of the city and
facilities for quartering troops are im
proving. Fever is decreasing. Intes
tinal troubles are about the same.
There are many slight ailments. Small
pox has apparently been arrested. Dur
ing the month twenty-eight deaths oc
curred, eight from smallpox, eight from
typhoid fever, five from malarial and
intestinal complaints and three from
fl.ccldftnt "
LONDON, Oct. 21.â Eastern Tele
graph Company says there is no foun
dation in the report circulated in the
United States that the cable between
Hongkong and Manila has been cut by
Admiral Dewey.
INTERESTS THE PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
There Is a Prospect That the War
Claim of California Will
Soon Be Paid.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 20.â General Bar
rett had a hearing yesterday and to-day,
with the Auditor of the War Department
on the war claim of California. General
Barrett and his private secretary, Colo
nel Burgln, were received very cordially
by Auditor Brown, who showed every
courtesy possible. No time was wasted,
and the party proceeded immediately to
examine the claim and see If there were
any paragraphs that needed explanation.
As far as Auditor Brown could see there
Is no reason why the claim should take
long to audit, as every cent seemed to
him to have been accounted for. The j
claim has been handed over to the chief
of the claims division, and It will prob
ably take his department about five days
to go over It and then the exact amount
that is due California from the Govern
ment will be known. General Barrett is
working hard to have the claim fixed as
soon as possible, as the State of Califor
nia needs the money to equip the new Na
tional Guard.
Pensions have been granted as follows:

DISASTER ON
THE TORPEDO
BOAT DAVIS
Seven" Men Meet a
Horrible Death.
TUBES OF A BOILER EXPLODE
I WHILE UNDERGOING FINAL
TRIAL TRIP.
Victims Engulfed in Flames, Steam
and Boiling Water â Several
Others Injured, but Not
Seriously.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ASTORIA Or., Oct. 20.â At 11:30 this
morning, twenty-five milâ above this
city, on the Columbia River, an acci
dent happened on the torpedo boat
Davis, at the time in charge of the Gov
ernment official trial board, undergoing
her final trial trip. The boat was
steaming along at fully twenty-eight
miles an hour, when some of the tubes
in the after end of the forward boiler
suddenly exploded. The escaping
steam and water blew open the furnace
doors, and instantly filled the fire room
with flames, steam and boiling water.
Seven men in the room at the time were
so seriously scalded that all subse
quently died.
As quickly as possible the boat was
stopped, the hatch opened and the men
lifted upon the upper deck. Within a
few minutes two of them, in spite of
the care of a surgeon on board, died.
The boat was taken in tow by a rivei
tug, which happened to be in the vi
cinity, and brought to this city. On
reaching the dock here the third man
died, and the others were at once re
moved to the hospital, where they ex
pired late to-night.
The names of the dead are:
CHARLES O'NEILL, fireman.
PAUL LUITHLE, coal passer.
HARRY WOODS, fireman.
W. WOODS, superintendent of the
boiler-room.
J. RYAN, fireman.
A. JOHNSON, fireman.
A. BUEHLE, fireman.
All were residents of Portland.
Other members of the crew were also
injured, but none seriously.
The Davis was built by the firm of
Wolff & Zwicker, Portland, and on sev
eral preliminary trips has worked sat
isfactorily. She left Portland this
morning on her last official trial, and
would in all probability have been ac
cepted by the Government on reaching
this city.
The theory advanced by some of the
crew for the explosion is that the au
tomatic water-gauge failed to work
properly, and the water ran down too
low in the boiler.
The Davis left for the shipyard in
Portland to-night In toiv of a tug. and
aside from the damnpe in her fire-room
is in perfect condition.
AWFUL TYPHOONS AND
FLOODS IN THE ORIENT
Thousands of Lives Lost, Hundreds
of Villages Swept Away and
Scores of Shipwrecks.
VANCOUVER. B. C, Oct. 20.âDisas
trous typhoons, sandstorms and floods
have caused a fearful loss of life and
property in the Orient. In the district
watered by the river Feng, in Japan,
hundreds of villages have been swept
away and 2000 people have been drowned.
Another report says that 260 towns are
under water. Thousands of refugees are
Hocking to the cities. The Ishlkari River
has also overflowed, drowning over 1000
people. Seven prefectures were de
stroyed.
In a terrible typhoon off Formosa, hap
pening the same tlm<=> as the floods, groat
damage to shipping was done. At Temani
eight junks were wrecked and a hundred
lives lost. Twelve junks were driven to
sea and lost. The steamer Rensi Maru
was piled upon the shore.
Among the ships wrecked was the
American bark Comet. The ship was
abandoned and the crew was saved. The
French steamer Holhow is wrecked on
the beach near Amoy. The German
steamer Trinidad, formerly of the Cunard
line was abandoned In the open sea-
Homeward-bound passengers state that
they passed through twenty miles of
abandoned wrecks, chiefly Chinese junks.
The loss of life must have been enormous.
It Wears Out a Man's Life-
It Ruins Vitality and De-
stroys Ambition,
V&rlcocele is an enlargement of
the veins, a clogging of the circu-
lation. It comes from excesses,
from injury, from strain and from
freat weakness of thÂ« vital parts,
t causes
Dragging Pains in the Baok, Pains in
the Groin and Abdomen, General
Weakness and Lassitude, and Early
Destruction of Vitality.
Men of forty feel like sixty when
they have Varlcocele. It kills all
ambition anil makes young men feel
that the brightness has gone out
of life. It ie a secret drain that
eate up manl'- strength as surely
as does consumption. Have you
got it? If so,

STRIKE TH.EM fJLL DOWN.
IN his concurring opinion in the case of Fitch vs.
the Board of Supervisors, decided by the Supreme
Court at Los Angeles on Monday, Justice Garoutte
calls attention to one of the contentions of the
plaintiff in a way that is striking as well as illumin
ating.
According to the act under which Fitch brought
his suit to oust the Supervisors he says: "Non
performance of the official duty of fixing water rates
in the month of February is declared to be malfeas
ance in office." In following the act the trial court,
therefore,, substantially impeached the entire board,
since its judgment went to the removal of all its mem
bers for malfeasance.
In short, he declares that the statute of March 7,
1881, provides for the punishment of innocent as well
as guilty Supervisors â in other words, the impeach
ment and removal of those who honestly endeavor to
fix rates in February as well as those who, being in a
majority, refuse to fix them in that month.
Justice Garoutte also directs attention to the fact
that Judge Wallace declares in his findings that some
of the Supervisors are innocent, and yet he enters a
decree removing them from office. The learned Jus
tice regards this interpretation of the law as mon
strous, and says:
The Legislature has no power to pass an act vis
iting these serious consequences upon innocent men,
and, as a necessary result, any act attempting to
enforce such a power Is unconstitutional. A deÂ»
termination as to the exact limits of the power of
the Legislature in declaring what acts of the indi
vidual shall constitute a crime is an interesting and
possibly difficult question, considered in the light of
the constitution. But there Is no difficulty in de
claring, in the light of the constitution, that a Leg
islature has no power to say that one man wholly
innocent is guilty of crime and shall be punished
because another man fails to perform his official
duty. The power of the Legislature reaches no such
limit. It cannot be done under our form of govern
ment. I shall not concern myself in pointing out the
particular provision of the constitution forbidding it.
I find it between the lines. The whole spirit of the
instrument denies the right to do it.
We agree with Justice Garoutte that the whole doc
trine is infamous. Moreover, we are willing to add
what was evidently in the mind of the jurist, that the
men who conceived and executed the doctrine, giving
to it the authority of judicial decision, are infamous
men and unfit for American citizenship.
Some of them are running for office at the present
moment in this city. The people should ascertain
their names and repudiate them. Mayor Phelan
headed this entire conspiracy against American lib
erty and should be rebuked first. A man who attempts
to establish such a doctrine has no place in the gov
ernment and should not be permitted to exercise
power of any kind. He is unfit to hold the office of
poundkeeper.
AN INSULT TO CITIZENS.
WHAT do the residents and voters in the Third,
Fifth, Seventh, Ninth and Tenth wards think
of Mr. Phelan's assertion that no man among
them is qualified to be a Supervisor? What do they
think of his acts and advice by which each of these
wards has been colonized with a candidate of his
selection? How do they receive his "holier than
thou" suggestion of their universal unfitness to hold
a public office? How will they vote on election day
with the sting of this insult still hot upon their faces
and burning in their hearts?
Mr. Phelan declares that his committee on nomina
tion reported to his Committee of One Hundred that
"suitable" men could not be found in any one of
these wards for the office of Supervisor. What does
Mr. Phelan mean by "suitable men"? Does he mean
honest men? Surely there must be one honest man in
these five wards. Docs he mean capable men? Surely
in this large section of our city there is one man at
least both honest and capable enough to be a Super
visor. What, then, does Mr. Phelan mean by the
term "suitable men"? Perhaps he means "service
able men." If so, it is quite probable that Mr. Phelan
was not able to pick out any of his sort of "service
able man" in any of those five wards. But even
that should not have tempted him to commit the mis
demeanor of inducing five other men to commit a
wrong.
Chief Surgeon Huidekeper of the volunteers has
been honorably discharged. There will be no ob
jection. He is said to be a good horse doctor, and
that is an honorable calling.
Indictment of the manager of a matrimonial bureau
merely means the extension to him of an opportunity
to jump bail.
When Democrats "get together" the one nearest
the door will be wise to put his head out and yell for
the police.
When Mayor Phelan talked over the telephone to
the Mayor of Portland, he did not tell him a word of
what he knew concerning the subject of colonization.
MR. HEARST fIND HIS POPER.
*#Jtf'r:~' -V)"-'- â
IT is not pleasant to have to pause in the dignified
and proper discussion of public issues to respond
to the provocation offered by a coward without
character, a cur with none of the instincts which make
even curs worth the tax and the collar which keep
them out of the pound.
Mr. Hearst has chosen to conduct this campaign
with mud which he flings at persons rather than to
discuss principles and apply policies.
Therefore it becomes necessary to recall the offen
sive personality of this man, who was so long a
fugitive, to the attention of the people of this city,
from the midst of whom he fled, and to which for
years he dare not return, while the courts waited to
get jurisdiction of him to punish his offenses against
decency.
From the beginning of his newspaper career Hearst
was a blackmailer. The tendency was as marked as if
inherited. He haggled for a price on his silence as
shamelessly as a thief bulling the value of stolen goods
at the pawnbroker's.
His paper has for years professed anti-railroad sen
timents, and yet whenever it nrght have been for
midable to the railroad its silence has been offered at
a price.
When the Pattison Commission was here in 1887
probing into Southern Pacific affairs there was an op
portunity for the Examiner to make good its anti
railroad pretenses. But it sold its forbearance, pock
eted its price and maintained an innocuous attitude
until the commission was gone.
Hearst's $30,000 contract with the Southern Pacific
is notorious history. He entered into a written treaty,
which he signed, a copy of which is in existence, to
give the Southern Pacific "fair treatment" for the
period of thirty months, covering two sessions of the
Legislature. The verbiage of the treaty completely
reveals the threat by which he forced the corporation
into it. If it would not be blackmailed into buying
fair treatment of this perverted fellow, the publicity
at his command in his paper would be used in treat
ing it unfairly. No fact that can be brought to the
attention of men is more firmly established than this
blackmailing treaty. The advertising contract which
cloaked it, and which referred to it as a condition of
the superimposed contract, was hypothecated at a
bank and was paid to within $8000 of the $30,000 it
called for, when the Southern Pacific stopped pay
ment because Hearst had violated his treaty for "fair
treatment" of the corporation. If the only element
in the transaction were the advertising contract, why
does he not sue for the $8000 balance? If the treaty
that underlies the contract were an open, legitimate
and proper transaction, as it is made a part of the ad
vertising contract, why does he not go into the courts
on it and prove that he treated the corporation fairly
by proving that the things he printed about it were
true and therefore "fair," and not in violation of the
treaty?
He does not go into the courts because the black
mailing treaty would be declared against good con
science or public policy. The courts would decide
that a newspaper cannot make a legal contract to
abstain from unfair treatment of an individual or a
corporation for a money consideration. The courts
would decide that Mr. Hearst was a blackmailer, and
the public that he was a blackguard, when he held up
the Southern Pacific and made it agree to pay him
$30,000 for thirty months' "fair treatment."
While, he was a fugitive from civil justice in this
State, avoiding the jurisdiction of California courts,
he managed his paper through another blackmailer,
the fellow Lawrence. We carry on no controversy
with him. We kick the dog, not his fleas. Of course
it is unpleasant for citizens to be held up to public
contempt by the libels which Lawrence prints, as the
biting of any parasite is annoying. But we realize
that a cur must have parasites, and that those who live
on Hearst gain in their power to annoy, as flies gain
in poison by the carrion on which they gender.
When Lawrence uses a pretense of charity to ad
vertise the Examiner and pinches the proceeds; when
he lies, fakes, libels and slanders, he is living up to
his nature, it is true, but he does it because he is the
parasite of a cur.
The paper, which is feculent with the corruptions
and blackmailing of Hearst, is selected as the organ
of reform by the purists who are pretending to rectify
politics while striving for power to be used under the
dictation of a blackmailer. Mayor Phelan takes or
ders from Hearst's parasite, and wig-wags as Law
rence's thumb is raised. The Mayor has a right -to
select his methods and the men with whom he con
sorts, or whose orders he obeys. The decent com
munity have also the right to judpc him by the com
pany he keeps, and he cannot complain.
It may be that there is a section of public opinion,
not a highly commendable opinion, that a corporation
is the legitimate prey of the blackmailer Hearst. But
the vicious and immoral use of his newspaper is not
confined to the blackmailing of corporations. Its
silence has been bought and paid for when it had in
ttJ possession knowledge that if published would have
prevented crime and protected the rights of the help
less.
When the Pacific Bank was rotting and was sap
ping the funds of the savings bank which belonged to
thousands of poor depositors, the Examiner gained
a perfect knowledge of the situation, and instead of
publishing it in time to prevent the robbery of the
savings depositors, it sold its silence to the robbers
for a money consideration, which was taken out of the
funds of those depositors. Instead of timely warning
of the robbery* it joined the robbers and took its share
of the spoil. This will not be denied for Mr. Hearst
by his parasite, for the evidence is in existence and is
ample.
The record of Hearst is abhorrent. When it is
studied every fair-minded man is convinced that when
he exposes offenses in his paper a blackmail dicker
with the offender has failed, and those who may be
victims of burglars, or bank looters, or corporate
crime or individual transgression, have the right to
assume that Hearst has fattened his wallet out of
their spoliation by selling his silence to their de
spoiler.
Let no one say that this is a newspaper quarreJ, for
it is not. It is no more a newspaper quarrel- than the
exposure of a bank burglar is a quarrel between lock
makers because the robber is a lockpicker. The hang
ing of a man who has murdered with a razor may be
indorsed by an honest barber without exposing him
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 21, 1898.
to the accusation of jealousy. A wretch may be pun
ished for infanticide by malpractice without calling it
a doctors' quarrel, and a shyster may be disbarred
without ascribing it to the professional jealousy of
lawyers. We treat the case of this cur, Hearst, from
the same standpoint, our interest in it being only that
of the citizen who is entitled to protection in his good
name, without being compelled to make a contract
with Hearst for "fair treatment."
THE HONORABLE JACOB NEFF-
AT no time in the Republican State Convention
was the enthusiasm greater than at the nomi
nation of Jacob Neff for the office of Lieu
tenant Governor. Throughout the State there was
felt the same delighted pride in the choice. His nom
ination was everywhere ratified with the heart as well
as with the brain, for honest Jacob Neff is one of
those genial, whole-souled men whom the people love
and whom they are always glad to honor and to ele
vate to high office.
No other man so completely represents all Califor
nia as Mr. Neff. He has been identified with its his
tory and its advancement from the days of the pio
neers. He is known in the city and in the country;
among the farmers of the valleys and among the
miners of the mountains. Gifted in a high degree
with the faculty of making and retaining friendships,
he counts his personal friends by the thousands, while
his reputation has won for him the esteem of thou
sands more who have never met him.
It has not been by good fortune or by popular
caprice that Mr. Neff has won this high place in the
esteem of the community. It is his because he has mer
ited it. He has made friends among all classes of
people because he has shown himself friendly to all
classes. He has been kindly, hospitable, helpful, in
all the relations of life. He has not lived for himself
alone. He has borne his share of public duties and
has been as faithful and as energetic in the perform
ance of them as in the conduct of his private business.
He can, therefore, count upon the permanence of the
esteem of his friends, neighbors and fellow citizens,
because it is based upon the solid foundation of ser
vice rendered and good work well done.
So great is the personal popularity of Mr. Neflf that
many persons are apt to overlook the political reasons
why his election should be brought about. The office
of Lieutenant Governor is by no means an unimport
ant one. Outsideof the fact that he succeeds to the gov-
ernorship under certain contingencies, he is charged
with the duty of presiding over the deliberations of
the Senate, and has therefore considerable power and
influence in the direction of legislation. A Demo
cratic Lieutenant Governor could seriously hamper a
Republican Senate in carrying out policies for the
general welfare, while a Republican Lieutenant Gov
ernor could and would materially facilitate their
adoption and enactment.
Mr. Neff is peculiarly well fitted to perform the
duties of president of the Senate. His abilities as a
presiding officer of deliberative bodies are well known.
They have been often demonstrated. His knowledge
of parliamentary law has been gained by a large ex
perience as well as by study. He is firm, just, impar
tial and prompt.
The voters in this campaign who have long been
residents of California can hardly need urging to cast
their ballots for grand old Jacob Neff. He is dear
both to the pioneers and to the native sons. He rep
resents alike the capital and the labor of the State,
the patriotism and the industries of the people. His
personal popularity and political strength taken to
gether render him invincible by any opponent. Let
his election be given by a majority the State can be
proud of. -^.
THE GREWSOME GIRLIE.
JUST why a girl should desire to wear a belt or
carry a purse made of human skin is one of the
problems still awaiting solution, and considera
tion of which has aroused interest in this community.
There is, as a rule, an instinctive reverence for the
dead, and this natural emotion often takes the form
of an actual horror of contact with a corpse. The
mummy is the only style of cadaver which fails to ex
cite a thrill of repugnance, but it is so old and its per
sonality so lost somewhere along the corridors of
time that it does not count.
But the tanned skins worn by the local belie were
stripped from a- comparatively recent entity. They sug
gest #n individual existence. They recall the pallid
face on the pauper's cot, the rigid form from which
the covering was torn for the bedecking of another
form which one day will be as dead and as fair an
object of prey for the ghoulish. However, one girl,
has taken a decided lead. Her apartments are decor
ated with a human eye, a staring, unwinking, pickled
human eye, which, snatched from the socket of a
corpse and having been prepared by the loving
hands of medical students and placed in a case of skin,
was presented to this gentle maid.
That eye ought to enter into her dreams. It should
haunt her. It should peer at her through the dark
ness, making her. terrified and hysterical, seek refuge
under the bedclothes. It ought to look daggers in
the direction where her soul would be had not nature
kindly so constructed her as to be free from such
an annoying tenant.
It is impossible to esteem the girl who regards
human skin, aside from her own, as a suitable cover
ing, or who courts the presence of a pickled eye.
The Examiner says there is a "deluge of money"
in this campaign. The statement can hardly be ac
cepted. If the Republicans were spending coin cor
ruptly, as intimated, the Examiner, instead of expos
tulating, would be standing with editorial palm ex
tended and singing with unction, "Let Some Drop
pings Fall on Me."
Mayor Phelan asks in what way he has done aught
against the interests of labor. Well, for one thing, he
has declared that the lamplighters to whom the gas
company â an institution not noted for bigness of
soul â pays $40 a month would be well enotigh paid
at $25.
There is always something new concerning the
Chinese Emperor. He has been variously dead, well
and hearty, and now he comes into notice as an in
valid. The Emperor seems to have an active press
agent who lacks accuracy.
"Democrats should get together" exclaims the or
gan which is supposed to voice the common desire for
purity and reform. Why should any more of them
get together? Isn't the Committee of One Hundred
a terrible enough example?
If Keenan had exhibited the determination to kill
himself that he showed when his wife was the victim,
he would not now be troubled by dreams of the gal
lows.
Ex-Chaplain Mclntyre, late of the Oregon, can now
have the satisfaction of speaking his mind, and this
is a joy as much to be sought after as a post in the
navy.
WANDERING CANDIDATES
ARE NOW INELIGIBLE
John L Love on the Legal Status
of Those Who Were
Colonized.
Recognizing tho fact that John L.
Love Esq. would be familiar with the
election laws, since he was for four
years Attorney General 'of the State,
four years Assistant District Attorney
of San Francisco and for two years City
and County Attorney for San Francisco
and as such a member of the Election
Commission, The Call asked him to give
a legal opinion on the status of Mayor
James D. Phelan, the candidates for
Supervisor who have registered in
wards in which they do not live and of
the members of 'the sub-committee of
"One Hundred" upon whom the re
sponsibility is being thrown, assuming
that what has been printed in The Call
is true. The following is Mr. Love's
reply:
SAN FRANCISCO, October 20, IS9B.
To the Editor of The Callâ Sir: In an
swer to your communication, I will give
you my ideas upon the subject from a
legal standpoint as plainly as I can.
when the consolidation act was passed,
each ward was represented by a Super
visor, who was a citizen and voter of that
ward and who was elected by the voters
of that ward only. This lÂ«d to what was
called "colonizing," and it was this sit
uation which coined the word and put it
into politics.
To do away with this evil, the Legis
lature, which at that time, under the old
constitution, had the power to amend the
consolidation act, passed a law that the
Supervisors should be voted for by the
whole' city and county and not by wards,
but they still adhered to the proposition
that a candidate for Supervisor must be
an actual and not "temporary" resident of
the ward he waa to represent. This is the
law to-day.
After the adoption of the new constitu
tion in 1879, it became impossible for the
Legislature to meddle with our consoli
dation act in any way. To general laws
we are amenable, but not to any special
act.
Some one pushed an act through the
last Legislature abolishing the wards, for
what object or for what purpose 1 can
not guess, unless it is the situation that
now stares us In the face.
That some attorneys said this act is un
constitutional and special legislation is the
main excuse of Mayor Phelan and his
followers for their dereliction in register
ing prospective candidates for Supervisors
in wards and precincts in which they do
not belong.
There is not a lawyer worthy of the
name who does not know that the law
abolishing the wards is unconstitutional
and of no force or effect. They might as
well have abolished the consolidation act
as a whole; and the committee of one
hundred and Mr. Phelan admit it when
they say that they resorted to false and
fraudulent registration "in case the courts
Should so decide." This fear of the courts
is one of the numerous excuses Mr. Phe
lan gives for what has been done. There
is a very sharp edge to this business
somewhere, for I notice â¬he Mayor Is al
ways very careful to say "I didn t do it.
I propose to demonstrate from the
statute law that all of these registrations
of Supervisors named by you, except one
were fraudulent and felonious, and if
they vote on such registration they will
commit another felony.
The Sternberg case affords very little
light for the reason that this case went
off on the question whether the crime had
been proven or not, as to whether the
accomplices who '"gave Sternberg away"
were corroborated or not. It was ad
mitted cm all sides that it was a crime.
Now I am about to auote from the
Sternberg case, and see, Mr. Editor, If you
can distinguish It from the one we are
W peopfe^-s? Sternberg, 111 California Re
ports, p. 4.
"Henshaw, J. Defendant was charged
with procuring and allowing A. Gutman
to be registered aa a voter In the pre
cinct register of a precinct in which he
was not entitled to be registered. The
prosecution was had under and by vir
tue of the provisions of the purity of

Now Is there any distinction between
voting for Mahoney or for yourself for
Supervisor? Is there any distinction be
tween the Baldwin Hotel and the Occi
dental Hotel, the Nob Hill House and
the Coso House? The court says further

one taken up in good faith with the in
tent to remain.
Section 1239 of the Political Code is as
follows:
"The Board of Election in determining
the place of residence of any person must
be governed by the following rules: â¢ â¢ â¢
"1. That place must be considered and
held to be the residence of a person in
which his habitation is fixed, and to
which whenever he is absent he has the
intention of returning.
"5. A person must not be considered to
have gained a residence in any precinct
into which he comes for 'temporary' pur
poses merely, without the intention of
making such precinct his home."
In the Examiner of October 19, IS9B,
Mayor Phelan is quoted as saying:
"There is not the least suspicion of ille
gality about the 'temporary' change of
residence. The candidate went into an
other ward for a definite purpose."
I suppose it is fair to ask what the pur
pose was. Was it to vote for Mr. Ma
honey for Senator, or Mr. Some One Else
for Assemblyman, or for himself for Su
pervisor, or for the greater glory of Mr.
Phelan himself?
Sternberg must begin to feel that he has
been pretty badly treated. I would sug
fest, Mr. Editor, that you address a note I
o Judge Wallace, who sentenced Stern- i
berg to prison (and of whom the Examiner
says: He is facile prlnceps as a Judge),
that he distinguish this case from the i
Sternberg case; of course not pointing j
out the culprits.
To show that the same idea runs all j
through the election lawsâ that is, that a I
man must vote from his own home and j
not around the cornerâ l call your atten- ]
tion to the law in regard to challenging
a vote. There are certain questions laid
down, which the election officers must \
put to be answered under oath, and
among others, these:
"Section 1233, Political Codeâ l. When
did you last come into this county or elec
tion precinct?
"2. When you came into this county or
precinct did you come for a temporary
purpose merely, or for the purpose of
making it your home?
"3. Did you come into this county or
precinct for the purpose of voting here?"
The lawmakers ought to have put in
another question: Did you come to run
for Supervisor?
Section 1239 reads as follows: "The
Board of Election', in determining the
place of residence of any person, must be
governed by the following rules, as far as
they are applicable:
"I. That place must be considered and
held to be the residence of a person in
which his habitation is fixed and to which
whenever he is absent he has the inten
tion of returning."
I understand from the statements made
In your paper, which I am taking all the
time as true, that some of the wandering
Supervisors have already announced that
"so soon as the election is over they are
going home, whichever way It goes""
Subdivision 5 of this same section reads
as follows:
"A person must not be considered to
have gained a residence in any precinct
into which he comes for temporary pur
poses merely, without the intention of
making such precinct his home."
Mayor Phelan can hardly plead Ignor
ance of the law when he says to the Ex
aminer that "there is not the least sus
picion of illegality about the temporary
change of residence â¢ â¢ â¢."
That word "temporary" occurs too often
in the law, and it rested unruly in his
brain.
Without quoting any more from the
statutes, It is clear that these gentlemen
in their zeal to do something are im
properly registered, and it is clearly the
duty of the Registrar and the Board of
Elpction Commissioners to serve them
with a citation, and. after hearing, strike
their names from the Great Register. I
cannot see how any one of the persons
registered away from their every-day
homes will dare vote. If I am rignt, it
would be a felony if they aid.
Suppose none of them vote, that all keep
away from the polls and that they all
polled a majority vote In the city and
county, still they would be ineligible and
could not hold the office, because they
were not : ntitled to vote. "And no person
is eligible to an office who is not an
elector." (Political Code, aection 58). Re

'BUTCHER" WEYLER MADE
TOBACCO ADVANCE
HIS EDICT RENDEBED THE
CUBAN LEAF SCARCE.
American Consumers of High-Grade
Cigars Are Made to Suffer the
Consequences.
Bernard Stahl, a guest at the Palace
Hotel and one of the largest manufactur
ers of Havana cigars in the country, pos
sesses interesting information concerning
the effect of the recent troubles in Cuba
upon the tobacco market.
"So far as the American market is con
cerned," he said yesterday, "the trouble
1 commenced in May, 1896, with the edict
of General "Weyler prohibiting the expor
tation of leaf tobacco from the island.
| "This edict was, of course, the work of
the Cuban cigar manufacturers, and, if
I mistake not, Weyler received a large
sum for it. He went there, as everybody
knows, a comparatively poor man and
came away wealthy. This edict was in
force until October, 1897. During that time
American manufacturers were at their
wits' end for tobacco, and it went up from
75 to 100 per cent. Part of this advance, it
is true, was due to the troubled condition
of the island. The small farmer, with hi;*
400 or 500 bales of tobacco, waa in a bad
way. Perhaps one day a band of insur
gents would demand $1 per bale for spar-
Ing his crop and the next day he would
have to pay a similar sum to the Span
iards for alleged, lack of sympathy with
their cause.
"How was the consumer affected? As
a matter of fact. It all came out of him.
He wouldn't stand the difference in cost,
and the manufacturer could not. In other
words, the consumer secured a poorer
cigar. Even Connecticut tobacco was put
into many well-known brands, that were
introduced as and in fact were originally
pure Havana. I doubt, however, If the
consumers generally noticed much differ
ence. A large percentage of them judge
a cigar by Its price or the stamps on the
box. I can see no chance of a good crop
for at least two years. My experience
shows that the people of this coast re
quire more high-grade goods, proportion
ally, than the people of the East. '

FIND LAW FOR
MR. VALENTINE
A Bundle of Papers Refused on Which tc
Base His Battle for the People's
Rights.
He Will Seek a Writ of Mandate to Compel Wells-Fargo
to Pay Its Share of the War
Tax.
The State has taken up the fight oF the people, and by
writ of rrmndatewill force Wells, Fargo & Co., rather than
Wells, Fargo & Co.'s patrons, to pay its war tax.
Since The Call first called his attention to the impo
sition being practiced by the carrier corporation, the
Attorney-General has been casting about for some swift,
sure method of bringing the greedy corporation to a sense
of its wrong-doing. He has decided upon the all-power
ful writ of mandate, and to-day or to-morrow he will make
petition for the writ before the Circuit Court.
Wells-Fargo's patrons may yet have the satisfaction
of seeing Wells-Fargo's president writing checks for his
own war stamps.
The will of the people has not been
potent in the fight to compel Wells, Fargo
Â£.- Co. to pay its war tax. and the strong
arm of the State has been invoked to
force that purpose.
Despite that its volume of business has
been greatly reduced by its insatiate
greed, the carrier corporation has per
sisted and still persists in <umpelling the
people who have made 11 ice a
profitable possibility to stand the burden
of its just expc:.
Basing his action upon the decision
handed down a week ago by Michigan's
Circuit Court. Attorney General Fitz
gerald will to-day or to-morrow begin
mandamus proceedings against the com
as the quickest, and ni"
tory method of obtaining a final d<
as to whether or not the carrier company
shall pay for the stamp the law requires
shall be affixed to all receipts.
The State established a cause of action
c n Wednesday.
On that day Assistant Attorney General
â Anderson, who has closely studied the
involved, presented at Wells-Far
go's offices a roll of opinions for trans
n to the Board of Examiners.
In the presence of two witnesses he ten
dered the amount ordinarily due, but re
fused to submit to the agent's demand
for an additional cent for the customary
stamp.
His package and his money were pushed j
to him across the desk with the in- \
formation that unless the company's de
was complied with the package ;
would not be received. Mr. Anderson j
then made a formal demand that the com
pany pay for and affix the necessary
stamp. This was refused.
'.gem's refusal Mr. Anderson >
i more than he expected. His ae
ial to the ends of his su- â¢
for two months been the
opinion of Attorney General Fitzgerald
that a proceeding by mandamus was the ;
only consistent way to arrive at a de- j
cision capable of prying open the swell- \
ing coffers or' Mr. Valentine and his con- '
freres. ;
When seen at his home last night â¢
Attorney General Fitzgerald said: j
"I became convinced over two
months ago that a writ of man
damus would he the most potent pro- '
eeeding to begin against Wells, Fargo & j
I I v I that opinion to a \
number of attorneys who questioned me
concerning th*> status of the matter.
"Since The Call first directed attention ;
to the cape and since the decision of the j
Circuit Court of Michigan, in which it is
stated that the Attorney (>â¢ neral was the
proper person to proceed in a case of this
kind. I determined to bring the local cor
poration to time if 1 could establish a
case against it.
"With this intention I instructed Mr.
Anderson to proceed as he has told you
ceeded, and I think by to-morrow,
or the next day at the latest, we will
have our complaint and petition for a
writ of mandate against Wells-Fargo in
proper shape to lay before the court. We
will prosecute it as rapidly as the ma- j
chinery of the law will permit."
The Michigan decision which Attorney â 
General Fitzgerald has considered is in
effect as follows:
As I understand, the law applying to this
subject Is found in schedule A of the revenue
law of 1538, and is as follows:
"Express and freightâ lt shall be the duty
of every railroad or steamboat company, car
rier, express company or corporation, or person
whose occui>atlon is to act a3 ouch, to issue to
the shipper or consignor, or his agent, or per-
Eon from whom any goods are accepted for
transportation, a bill of lading;, manifest or
Other evidence of receipt and forwarding, for
such shipment received for carriage. and trans
portation, whether In bulk or In boxes, bales,
packages or bundles, or not so enclosed or In
cluded; and there shall be duly attached and
canceled, as In this act provided, to each of
puch bills of lading, manifests, or other mem
oranda, and to such duplicate thereof, a stamp
of the value of one cent."
This Is the main portion of the law applying
to the question in hand.
It is manifest to me that it Is the intention
of Congress to require th" express companies
to deliver to the person offering for shipment
any goods or packages a receipt for the same,
and it requires Paid receipt to have attached
to it a revenue stamp of one cent. This makes
Jt clear to my mind that it is the duty of the
express company to deliver to such shipper
a full and complete receipt: and a receipt would
not be full and complete or legal unless it had
attached to it a canceled revenue stamp of the
value at one cent. '
Mr. Fitzgerald also spoke of the ap
peal of William F. Costley against Wells,
Fargo & Co., which was argued and sub
mitted yesterday to Superior Judge
Troutt.
Costley. in his .suit, prays for $299 dam
ages alleged to have resulted from the
refusal of Wells-Fargo to affix the neces
sary revenue stamp to a receipt for a
package tendered by Costley for trans
mission to Sacramento. Justice Barry,
before whom the case originally came,
gave a decision In favor of plaintiff, it
was appealed to the Superior Court and
AN EXPRESS TAG BROUGHT
HIM FROM FAR ST, LOUIS
WARREN HENRY DONALD, 6 years of age, is a brave little trav
eler, who reached this city Wednesday evening on the overland
train, having made the trip from St. Louis alone. Tied to his
coat was a tag addressed to an aunt, living at 267 Seventh street.
The little fellow has been living with his grandmother in St. Louis
for f(,mc time. His father, who is a photographer in Mexico, wishing his
son with him, wrote his mother to bring Warren to San Francisco. The
grandmother, being too old to travel, decided to send the boy by himself.
V\ hen the youngster arrived at the ferry depot last evening no one was
there to meet him. hut he was not at all concerned, and accosting a police
man, was t;ik<-n to the Harbor Station. The name on the tag had been
written with a lead pencil and being somewhat worn, could not be de
ciphered by the police. They finally made out the address, 267 Seventh
street, and Officer Dyer delivered the little parcel of flesh into the arms
of his aunt. She had not expected her nephew until a later train and was
Just on the point of starting for the depot when the boy arrived.
The boys lonesome journey ffe not finished. After visiting here a few
days, he will be placed aboard the steamer Orizaba, which will take him
to his destination in far-away Mexico. The little traveler stood the trip
from St. Louis better than most grown people and doesn't fear the sea
Journey before him in the least.
i must go on up until the Supreme Court
- finally decided it.
This procedure Mr. Fitzgerald con
sidered ill advised in that it permits of
too great delay and leaves the case open
â¢ many tecnnicalities. Brought by
mandamus before the Circuit Court the
VVells-Fargo people will have but one
i higher appeal, and if Mr. Fitzgerald
i obtains a decision in a reasonable time
'â  the people whom that patriotic corpora
i tlon hay persistently and successfully
' cinched may yet have the satisfaction of
i seeing Valentine buying his own war
stamps.
EASTERN STAR.
Only Three of the Six Elective Offi-
cers Chosen at the Session
Yesterday.
There was a large attendance of dele
pates at the pesston of the Grand Chap
ter of the Order of the Eastern Star yes
terday.
The morning session was taken up in
the discussion of a number of resolutions
which are of no interest to any one out
bid >_â¢ of the order and which will appear
in the printed proceedings to be forwaxded
to the several chapters.
The afternoon session was an unusually
i busy one, as at that time came up ths
election of the grand officers who are to
serve for the ensuing year. In the past
the election of grand patron, grand mat
ron, associate grand patron, associate
grand matron, treasurer and secretary,
has always been accomplished at the
afternoon session of the third day, but
yesterday only three officers were elect
ed, as there was a spirited contest for
each office. As announced in The Call
of last Wednesday the choice for the two
principal offices fell on the persons whose
names were given. Dr. J. w. Lawrance
of L#os Angeles was elected grand patron,
and Mrs. Marie A. Pierce of Oak Leaf
chapter, Oakland, was elected grand mat
ron. George L. Darling of Golden Gate
Chapter, 9an Francisco, was elected as
sociate grand patron, after which an ad
journment was had until this morning,
when the election of associate grand mat
ron, treasurer and secretary will be made
the special order of the morning. There
is likely to be a lively contest for the of
fice of grand secretary, as there are three
candidates for that office. Mrs. Kate J.
Willats, the incumbent, has two oppo
nents, Mrs. M. A. Wilson and Mrs. Hop
good.
Last evening there was a meeting of the
delegates in King Solomon's Hall in the
Masonic Temple to witness the work by
Carita Chapter of Alameda.
To-day, in addition to the election, the
matron elect will name the appointed offi
cers and in the afternoon all the officers
will be installed.
To-morrow the delegates will have the
choice of two excursionsâ one to Tamal
pais and the other to the Masonic Home
in Decoto.
Curious Result of Asphyxiation.
A peculiar result of gas asphyxiation
developed yesterday in the case of John

street. In a fit of despondency some two
weeks since, Rionehl attempted to com
mit suicide by turning on the gas in his
room. He was taken to the Receiving
Hospital, and after considerable difficulty
was resuscitated. Owing to the action of
the gas upon his her rt, the blood had co
agulated around that organ and when it
resumed its normal action the coagulated
blood found lodgment in his right leg
Blood poisoning developed, and Dr Weii
amputated Rionehl's right leg at the thigh
yesterday in order to save his life

The Naval Reserve Steamer Marion
Will Not Be Moved From How
ard Street Wharf for a
While.
The Pacific Mall Company experienced
great trouble In getting the steamer Chi
na away for the Orient. In the first place
there was a strike among the Chinese
and Japanese crew and then there was
such a rush of steerage passongers that a
large quantity of freight had to be put
ashore in order to make room for them.
In consequence the vessel was nearly six
hours late in getting away.
When the China was taken as a trans
i port the Chinese and Japanese crew was
engaged for the trip on a gold basis. The
regular run between here and the Orient
was on the Mexican dollar basis. When
the transport got back the coolies were
all paid off in United States gold coin,
much to their delight. The company was
satisfied, as Uncle Sam footed the bills,
; the Chinese were delighted and "all went
merry as a marriage bell."
Wednesday was the time set for the
crew to 'sign on" for the voyage to
Hongkong, and then the trouble began.
The Chinese refused to sign the articles
until their pay up to that time was forth
coming in gold. They were not gofng to
wait until the vessel reached Hongkong
and then be paid in Mexican dollars.
"Not muchee," said the boss Chinese. Thd
company was In a quandary. The Chinese
would have to be taken, whether as pas
sengers or crew was immaterial, while
the chances of getting a new crew here
were problematical. All kinds of ruses
were tried to circumvent the wily Celes
tials, but they all failed, and Wednes
day night the wages were paid in gold
coin and the Chinese stoned the ship's
articles. Yesterday about fifteen money
changers were busy around the ship
changing the American money into Mexi
can dollars.
During the Manila voyage the Japanese
were paid the same wages as white men.
When the Yokohama-Hongkong run was
resumed they refused to accept the old
pay and would not go to work. In conse
quence the China Is carrying eight of
them as passengers as far as Yokohama,
The China took away 74 cabin passen
gers, 35 second-class and 330 Chinese. The
rush of the latter came at the last mo
ment and in consequence an Immense
quantity of freight had to be put ashore
to make room for them. Nearly a thou
sand barrels of beer and large consign
ments of cigarettes were among the goods
put ashore, and somebody will have to go
short of those articles.
Madeleine Bouton, the actress, and Mrs.
Reid her chaperone, were to have sailed
on the China, but canceled their tickets at
the last moment. Among the Honolulu
Eassengers were the Rev. Fathers Lund
urg. IJlrich. Theopheile, Aloys and Vic
tor. They will make a tour of the islands
and will do some missionary work while
The Board of Harbor Commissioners
rescinded the order moving the Marion
into the stream yesterday. When the
Government presented the State with the
vessel for a naval reserve ship it was
with the understanding that she should
be kept moored alongside a wharf. The
Commissioners will now communicate
with the Secretary of the Navy and get
his permission to move the vessel into
the stream before any further action is
taken in the matter.
The Mexican schooner Novolato sailed
for Grays Harbor on the 18th lnst. While
at work on deck, Lorenzo Silva fell over
a coil of rope and broke his foot. He was
nut aboard the pilot boat Bonlta and
brought back to the city. He was sent to
the Marine Ho:pital.
The British ship Wallacetown, from

SUING THE CREMATORY.
Two Actions for Damages Brought
Against It.
The troubles of the Sanitary Reduction
Works of San Francisco are augmenting
daily. It was made the defendant in two
new suits filed Wednesday. The first al
leges that through bad management the
company's crematory dally permeates the
atmosphere ' with n#isome, poisonous
gases and half incinerated garbage,
spreading death and pestilence. The lat
ter that the company's agents are intimi
dating those who sell refuse for steam
generating purposes.
In both cases an injunction is asked.
August Vetter, plaintiff in the first ac
tion, states that with his wife and chil
dren he resides at 10 McLea court. Prior
to the erection of the crematory the lo
cality had always been healthful, but so
soon as the giant chimney began to emit
its poisonous fumes sickness visited his
home. His oldest son, aged 18 years, was
taken ill and died in the course of a few
weeks. Physicians informed him that his
son's death was due to the inhalation of
the crematory fumes. Since that time the
statement has been borne out by the fact
that his entire family has been afflicted
in a similar manner. In consequence the
court is asked to issue an injunction pro
hibiting the company from operating its
plant in a manner calculated to spread
disease in its immediate neighborhood.
A. F. Martel, the complainant in the
second action, affirms that prior to the
organization of the defendant corpora
tion he had been conducting a power gen
erating business at 16 Stevenson street.
Half of the fuel used in generating steam
for power consists of straw, shavings, old
boxes and other refuse. This he pur
chases from other persons, but of lat9 he
has had difficulty in procuring sufficient
refuse for use from regular sources by
reason of the methods pursued by the
company to prevent its purchase by him.
Agents of the company, it is alleged, sta
tion themselves near his place of business
and warn and Intimidate persons hauling
refuse for his use. He asks relief at the
hands of the court.
WOES OF DR. F. T. BOND.
His Action for a Divorce Will Be
Heard Shortly by Judge Troutt.
Dr. Frederick T. Bond's story of his un
happy married life, and the reason he
seeks a divorce from his wife, Annie A.
Bond, will be heard by JudgeTrouttport
ly. Dr. Bond's complaint is an uninter
rupted recital of narrow escapes from
death at the hands of his wife, abuse,
persecution and slander. On many occa
sions Mrs. Bond, it is alleged, tried to
brain her husband with an ax. At times
Bhe hÂ»ld him up at the point of a pistol
and threatened the rid the world of his
presence.
Again she would curse him. batter him,
slander htm and disgrace him; chop into
his office, ruin his desks and destroy h .->
effects; accuse him of being a poisoner
and make life generally a burden. In
consequence Bond wants a divorce and
the custody of his minor child. A peti
tion, on benalf of Mrs. Bond for the suo
tody of t'.ie child, was heard by Judge
Troutt yesterday, but on permission be
ing granted the petitioner to see her baby,
the petition was stricken from the calen
dar.

TELEPHONE GIRLS ANNOYED.
A Crank Hands Them Letters Ad
dressed to President McKinley
and Threatens Their Lives
The operators in the telegraph office at
607 Market street have been annoyed for
some time by the actions of a crank who
made his appearance in the mornings be*
tween 9 and 11 o'clock and handed them
letters addressed to President McKlnlt-y
and threatening to kill them unless the
letters were forwarded. The contents
of the letters showed that the man was
insane.
The police weTe notified and yesterday
afternoon Policeman W. M. RosÂ»s arrest
ed the man as he handed a letter to one
of the girls. Ross took the man before
Captain Spillane, who saw at once that
he was out of his mind, and instructed
Rosb to place him in the insane ward
in the Receiving Hospital. He is a man
about 40 years of age, shabbily dressed
and said his name was John Schausen. '
War Tax.
It Is the opinion of nine-tenths of the
bankers and other business men of the
country that the stamp tax on checks
will remain In force many years, and
perhaps permanently. It is a popular tax,
convenient to collect and difficult to re
peal. In view of this â¢uid the further
fact that our Government has settled
upon a policy of territorial expansion and
naval construction the opinion is well
founded.
The last civil war stamp tax on checks
remained about twenty years. This will
probably remain as long, so quit licking
stamps and have your checks made and

Marcus Marquardsen Insane.
Marcus Marquardsen, who lives at 19
Scott place, was committed to the asy

Troutt yesterday. Ten days ago the un
fortunate patient was convicted of a
petty theft and was sentenced to three
months' imprisonment in the County
Jail. He served four days of the sentence
and then began to manifest signs of in
sanity. He was removed to the Receiving
Hospital, where he was declard Insane
by the Insanity Commissioners.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Oct. 20- Considering the
apathy and indifference which have recently
been asserted on the stock market, the resist
ance made to-day on the depressing- influences
existing in all of the security markets waa
rather remarkable. Even at the opening prices
refused to yield to a parity of those estab
lished in London for Americans, but our open-
Ing and the rather heavy volume of offerings
for London account was easily absorbed at a
level sufficiently higher to make a very nice
profit for the arbitrage brokers. After the
1* r.i.n selling had ceased In the forenoon, the
market took on a hardening tendency and
broadened out to a very perceptible extent.
Prices of the grangers and other railroad
stock?. Including some In the list of those dealt
In on foreign exchanges, rose above yesterday's
level, or, at ihe least, retrieved the early losses.
Many recent;, inactive stocks were brought
Into the movement, and there was a resump
tion of the buying in small lots of some of the
â¢well secured dividend-paying stocks. The ex
planation of ths lay In the fact that what Is
European poison is to a certain extent our
meat. The striking evidence of this was dis
closed in the grain and provision markets,
â which were all excited and higher on the
eager competition for our products reflected
from all European markets as a result of the
lears of coming hostilities between Great Brit
ain and France. With a wheat crop of unpre
cedented dimensions to move, this development
â¢was bound to have an Influence on the grain
carrying roads. In former times threats of
â war in Europe had brought with It the dread
that the large foreign holdings of American
securities wuld be forced to liquidation on
the New York market. The Indifferent mood
In which this possibility was viewed to-day is
a striking proof of the large reduction which
lias been worked In the foreign holdings of
our securit.es as payment for last year's trade
balance In our favor. With the trade balance
all in our f.ivor is also the ground for indiffer
ence of the money markets abroad. European
government securities declined a sharp trac
tion and money rates advanced In sympathy
at all European centers. Yet the only effect
In the New York market was to harden the
rates for foreign exchange a fraction. As for
the local money market, not a ripple was
caused and rates for call money actually de
clined to IV4 per cent against the recent mini
mum of 2 per cent, with a range up to 24 per
cent. The strength of this country's financial
position could not be more strikingly illus
trated. Sugar found support at a moderate
decline and Tobacco was firm all day.
The market for bonds was not actire, but
prices wc-re well held. Total sales, $1,765,000
United States 2s declined 4, the 6s coupon
% and the old 4s registered and the new 4s
coupon and the 5s registered % in the bid
price.

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Oct. 20.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here were flat throughout to-day de
spite a feeble attempt at a rally at mldday
and prices closed at the lowest. The depres
sion was increased by the rise In the Bank of
France rate. Nevertheless the Paris bourse
was surprisingly calm, and even bought some
of its specialties. The decline here was led by
consols on bear sales, 11-16 per cent being paid
for put options In consols until the end of No
vember and small insurance risks on stork
transactions nt Lloyds against war with
France being effected as high as twenty guineas
until the end of the year.
Americans were flat. German specialties
were sold from Berlin.
Politics is checking and even demoralizing
business, but there is no real alarm as yet.
The stock exchange Is well prepared for event
ualities in the sense that the speculative ac
count for a rise is very small, but on the
other hand there Is scarcely any bear position
to support prices.
The London discount market was stronger
again to-day. The bank Is getting firm con
â  the market ami the market to-day had
to borrow from It. French exchange is much
unsettled at yesterday's high figure, the Paris
open market having risen sharply.

AVAILABLE GRAIN SUPPLY.
NEW YORK, Oct. 20â There was more ac
tivity In the wheat market to-day. The sharp
rise of 3d In prices at Liverpool, the recent
continued heavy export business and the war
like character of the news from Paris and
London over the dispute between England and
France combined to stimulate a revival of
speculation. The market was excited here and
2c higher at 76?jc for December, and maintain
ed the advance despite commission house profit
taking sales and the action of Western opera
tors continuing their previous policy of oppos
ing the improvement. There was a big export
business despite the advance and the higher
freight rates asked and over 150 car loads or
1,200,000 bushels were taken here and at the
outports up to the close. Some houses said
there were upward of 200 loads taken, but ex
porters were reticent and no more than 1,200,000
could be confirmed. As has been recently the
case, the demand was both from the United
Kingdom and the Continent. This makes the
total export engagements of the week to about
4,000,000 bushels, against 6,000,000 taken last
week.
This is the largest business transacted In
wheat for export for the period since the great
scramble to buy here in IS'JI, when the Rus
sian crop was Insufficient to meet that coun
try's requirements and exports were prohibited.
There was also a big export demand for corn
and the foreigners took over 1.000,000 bushels
here and at the outports for shipments, prin
cipally to the Continent.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Oct. 20.â An old-fashioned Euro
pean war scare, with all the trimmings, was
the controlling Influence In Wheat at the open
ing. Before business started here reports from
the other side were to the. effect that grain
markets were excited and up equal to &%@6Kc,
and English consols %(it% lower. In addition
to that, , there were reports from New York of
enormous ; export engagements of Wheat by
Europe. Minneapolis reported sales. of 130,000
barrala of Flour yesterday, of which a third
were for export, and .: there were advices of
eight inches of snow In portions of the North
west, which had been relied upon to supply a
good portion of the coming movement of spring
Wheat from first hands. - An enormous business
was transacted here, for instance, one firm
that had bought calls Tuesday night on fully
2,000,000 bushels of Wheat were credited with
having sold 1,500,000 bushels ,of it during the
first hour. The demand ' was such that the
grain was steadily absorbed, and the price,
after a slight dip on some profit - taking, ad
vanced to . a higher figure than It , had ; yet
reached. By noon December, which had started
2&2% c higher than Tuesday's close at 67%f365c,
had advanced to 68% c, and May. kept about lc
higher. The highest prices of . the day were
reached when December rose to 68Vi@6S%c, due
to the covering of a large . line of Wheat â¢by a
local speculator. At its conclusion- the market
sagged back to about the opening figure, De
cember selling at 68c sellers. '
The foreign situation was reflected , In â  Corn,
which started at a - sharp ; advance. â  Cable
acceptances were enormous. â  The ' gain at the
opening was well i held ' throughout, f December
closing with a gain of %<fMc on the day.
The speculative : considerations which moved
the other grains were shared In by Oats. There
was an . excellent demand . for cash and prices

CALIFORNIA FIGS IN THE EAST.
NEW YORK, Oct. 20.â The Journal of Com
merce says: The scarcity of Smyrna layer
Figs Is affording an opportunity for the intro
duction here of California fruit on a much
larger scale than ever before attempted, and
already we hear that large sales have been
mad* in Eastern markets, nnd much more
could be sold were stock available. The goods
come In layers In ten-pound boxes and also
In one-pound bricks packed in ten-pound cases,
the latter seeming to be more popular owing
to the ease with which they can be handled
by the retail trade. The quality of California
Figs, particularly those from the northern sec
tion, has been very much Improved, and gives
fair satisfaction to Eastern buyers. So far this
year receipts of Smyrna Figs In ciiÃes have
amounted to but 13m cases, against 7592 cases
to same date last year, when there was a com
paratively- small crop.
BOSTON, Oct. 20.â The Earl Fruit Company
auctioned California fruit to-day as follows:
Grapesâ Tokay, $I@l 65, average $1 27; double

"Some lines of leather are active, and In
consequence Hides continue firm. Harness ana
skirting have created a demand for the nea\

has materially lessened the output of tallow,

MEADORS
ACQUITTED
OF MURDER
Slayer of Jonas Ury
Goes Free.
HE PLEADED SELF-DEFENSE
THE ACCUSED "WAS WITHOUT
FRIENDS DURING TRIAL.
The Verdict Did Not Surprise the
Prisoner â Statement That He
May Be Court-Mar
tialed.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
W Broadway, Oct. 20.
James Nathaniel Meadors, charged with
having murdered Jonas Dry with his
pocket knife on August 16 last, while the
Eighth Regiment of Volunteers was en
camped at Camp Barrett, was acquitted
to-night.
The jury was out abotit three hours
and ten minutes. Meadors expressed no
surprise, and there was no one at hand
to congratulate him or cheer him. He
left the County Jail as unconcerned as
If out for an evening constitutional.
It was stated to-night that Meadors will
have to return to Company C, now at
Benicia, where he will probably be court
martialed. This is regarded as improb
able, however, for the disposition of his
case was voluntarily handed over by the
military to the civil authorities.
When Meadors appeared in court this
morning he looked worn out.
The defense closed by 11 o'clock. Attor
ney Deuprey's last witness was Eli Bran
nan, whose testimony brought out no new
points, and there being no testimony of
fered in rebuttal. Deputy District Attor
ney Melvin opened his argument to the
Jury. Attorney Melvin made a very
forceful argument, reciting at length
every detail brought out by wltnessses,
and contended that the defense had not
shown that which Attorney Deuprey in
his opening statement to the Jury prom
ised to showâ that Meadors' victim. Try.
was a man of bad repute for peace and
quiet, a prize-lighter by profession and
a bully by nature.
"When Attorney Deuprey began his ar
gument for the defense this afternoon
Judge Ellsworth's court room was crowd
ed to the doors. The famous defender
of Theodore Dun-ant spoke eloquently
and earnestly. He drew a beautiful word
picture of that patriotism with which a
man is endowed who rushes to the front
In response to the President's call for i
volunteers when the emblem of the na
tton is in danger, and pointed to Meadors
as one of the first to take up the weap
ons of warfare in defense of his country's
cause. He argued forcefully from the
standpoint of self-defense and empha
sized the idea that if Meadors had pre
meditated the murder of Ury he would
not have used the smaller blade of his
knife but the largest, or some other weap
on. Witnesses Foster and Silas were
pcorcht-d with words doubting their ye- ,
racity. nnd Mr. Deuprey aim. st lntl- â 
mated that Foster showed prejudice.
Attorney Melvin occupi< d another hour '<
in his concluding argument, and at 5
o'clock" the fate of Meadors was given :
over to the jury for deliberation.
Throughout the trial one fact has stood
out prominently. There have been no j
friends to by the accused. The de- j
fendant almost alone testified in his own i
behalf, and so far as the defense goes his
fate rested almost wholly upon his own
story. Few trials are recorded in Ala- !
raeda County that have proved so lack- I
ing In defense as that of Meadors.
DISCUSSED WOMAN'S SPHERE.
Advocates of Woman's Life in the
Home Carry Off the Honors.
Judges Had Easy Task.
BERKELEY. Oct. 20.â The routine pro
ceedings of the Woman's Christian Tem
perance Union Convention. now In
progress In the university town, were
enlivened this afternoon by an animated
discussion upon the time-worn question
of woman's sphere.
The occasion was a formal debate, with
two affirmative and two neg-ative speak
ers. The advocates of woman's life in
the home carried the day.
Formally stated the question was:
"Resolved, That it would be better for
humanity if women spent less time and
energy in public work." Mrs. M. Willis
of Sacramento and Dr. Alida C. Avery
spoke in its favor; Mrs. J. L. Everts and
Mrs. J. C. de Veiling upheld the negative.
The Judges decided for the affirmative;
and agreed also that everything said by
the opposing side was but argument di
rected against themselves.
The speech of the afternoon was made
by Dr. Allda C. Avery. She argued elo
quently upon woman's home duties.
â¢'Humanity's great need," she declared,
"was good homes and good mothers. Time '
end energy constitute the common capital
of the race, and prudence demands that !
this should not be appropriated for selfish
interests. Women should conserve vital
ity for their children; but this is impossi
ble where time and energy are exhausted
in public work. How much wholesome
homemaklng energy is devoted to church
fads. And what is the outcome? Thous

An Honest Thief.
OAKLAND, Oct. There is nothing
unusual In a thief covering up his tracks,
but when in addition he returns the stolen

No Lobby -Graces the
Water-Front Case.
PATIENCE ON THE RACK
EXHIBITS ENOUGH TO FILL A
FREIGHT CAR.
Desultory Evidence, Day After Day,
and No One Dare Predict
When It May
Cease.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
K)S Broadway. Oct. 20.
"Exhibit No. 442. if it please the court,"
and derk Robinson brushed the dreary
look from his eyes long enough to enter
In the record that exhibit 442 in the appa
rently Interminable water front case had
been duly registered.
Six attorneys, two or three witnesses,
Judge Ogden and a vast mass of dusty
and musty old tomes and stained maps
have been occupying a small portion of
Department 2 of the Superior Court for
some weeks. There is never any one in
he lobby and consequently no Incentive
to argument among the learned counsel.
'â¢Will this case be finished by Christ
map?" asked one attorney to-day of an
other.
"Of this year?" was the reply. And
nothing more was said.
The proceedings to-day were just a little
less dull than those of yesterday. Har
vey Brown occupied a considerable por
tion of the time by reading from ancient
assessment books, showing that year af
;â  r year the Water Frant Company had
paid" taxes on large parcels of the land
-put'-. There were many entries to
a page, many pages to a book, many
bo( ks and many piles of books, and as
Mr. Brown read on and on, he did not
stop to comment, but merely called the
court's attention to the fact that he was
reading from such a page of such a liber.
Judge Ogden nodded good naturedly to
the counsel a.s be paced restlessly to and
on the rostrum, thus giving Mr.
Brown assuraniv that the court was cog
nisant of the fact that he was still pre
senting evidence.
City Clerk Tompkins. who had been
subpenaed to give some evidence regard
ing books of ancient record in his control
â¢ . Clerk, pat in a chair with his back
toward everybody and indulged in an
afternoon nap. Ex-Assessor Leckie, who
handles assessment books as readily as
a Cuban a machete, passed the old books
to the counsel so a.s to avoid any break
in the proceedings. Attorney Powell
jooked on and apparently listened, mak
ing notes occasionally, all the while Mr.
Brown was patiently reading. Mr.
Brown's evidence that he presented was
not particularly sensational. A sample of
it is this: "A plot -if Kind, sixty and on"
hundred acres, I>< srinning at a point north
of the Peralta Grant line on Eighth street,
running northeasterly eight hundred feet,
southerly to a stake situated," et<\
etc.â and at the'end of each recitation Mr.
Brown would say, "All of which was
assessed" at sucb a time and for such an
amount to such a corporation, which af
terward became merged in tht> Water
Front Company.
Attorney A. A. Moore. If the case lasts
much longer, should provide the county
with a new wi<hh of carpet, for his con
tinual pacing t-> and fro like a restless
lion in a cage has left a permanent im
pression on the courthouse floor. No one
expects the case to end for some weefts
as it is said to be necessary to have the I
record absolutely straight. The keeping
straight f>f the record seems to trouble I
all the attorneys, though to an outsider
it would seem to be of secondary txnpor- i
tance. because the record is getting so
lengthy that whether it was straight or I
not could hardly be determined in one ;
ordinary lifetime.
Mr. Brown will continue his recitations i
to-morrow.

WIDOW INSTIGATES INQUIRY
STORY OP A SUDDEN DEATH
AND A BOGUS FORTUNE.
Fifty Thousand Dollars in Alleged
Currency That Excited the
Cupidity of a Horde of
Relatives.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 20.â The mythical for
tune of John Cummins, who dropped dead
in Alameda about two years ago, has an
other claimant. Cummins' life in this city
and the circumstances surrounding his
death were enveloped in much mystery.
Some of it was cleared up, but much of
it remains a secret, which, it was thought,
died with him.
To-day the secretary of one of the local
Masonic lodges received the following
communication, dated City of Mexico.
October 14:
I a?k as a favor for some Information about
my husband's death (John Cummins), who
died at Mrs. Soverign's house and was buried
by her husband, who is an undertaker. He
died two years aeo in January. Mrs. Sover-
Ign was his first wife, they having a son.
i'lease cive me his full name. When Mr.
Cummins went to San Francisco he was In
-.'ialth. The next I learned of him was
his death in Alameda. He was worth a great
amount of money. I understand his supi><-<K>>d
f n and mother report his dyine a pauper.
row will do me a Kreat favor to make private
and confidential Investigation of all particu
lars of his sickness and death, also about his
financial standing three years a.go and at the
present time; hla social standing and his pro
fession. Did Mr. Cummins have a physician,
and If so who? Give me one Mr. Porter's ad
dress, a friend of my husband in Alameda.
MRS. CARRINOTON CUMMINS.
Mrs. Cummins is chasing a rainbow â the
same rainbow that many Alamedans
chased to their sorrow at the time of
Cummins' death. 'When the man came
to Alameda he represented himself as the
owner of a rich silver mine in Mexico.
One morning in January, 1897, he was
found dead in bed. An autopsy developed
that he had died of beaut disease.
He was supposed to have left $50,000 in
currency and many olainucnts came for
ward. Attorney R. B. Tappan was ap
pointed administrator. He advised the
claimants to come together and compro
mise their differences. They accordingly
met in his office. The unopened packages
of wealth were produced and the seals
were broken. The four packages taken
from the satchel contained many hundred
pieces of tissue paper, cut the size of a
bank note. The Colorado securities were
valueless.
It developed later that the man was
a dealer in green goods. The letter from
the widow in Mexico has revived Interest
in the case among those who have un
paid bills against the estate.
His widow asserts that he was worth a
great amount of money, and from the
tone of her letter evidently t-ntertains the
impression that the mother and son have,
for a purpose, represented that Cummins
died a pauper.
The matter will be brought to the atten
tion of the local Masonic fraternity and
an investigation will probably be made.
Cummins was not a Mason, but the widow
has sought their assistance on the claim
that her father stands high in the fra
ternity.
AN ATTORNEY'S RASH THREAT.
Blandin Would Jump in the Bay if
He Lost His Case.
OAKLAND, Oct. 20.â "1f I lose this suit
I will throw myself into the bay." These
were the words used to-day by Attorney
| Charles F. Blandin in conversation with
opposing counsel, Robert Edgar. The
suit on trial was that ol Antonio BerODlo
against Sarah T. Ingalls, Maria Moore
Nagle and Blandin.
It appears that Blandin, as assignee for
Mrs. Ingalls, had released a mortgage of
on her Berkeley home, upon the stip
' ulatlon that she give, a $2000 mortgage
!on the same property to Beronlo. Ac
cording to Attorney Edgar, Klandin ap
propriated this UM9 to his own use and
further secured a third mortgage himself
on the balance of the property for $1000.
Now Beronio seeks to foreclose, and is
opposed by the three defendants, who are
at loggerheads.
To-day Attorney Robinson, on behalf of
one of the defendants, commenced to un
veil the history of the famous (,'ajifield
Canal Coal Company, of which Mrs. Nagle
was secretary and Blandin president.
Mrs. Nagle testified that ehe was worth
j $100,000 eight years ago. At that time she
met Blandin and he became her business
i manager. Now she Is penniless.
Blandin objected to any further expose
of the coal company, and the court sus
tained him.

Chairman Tarpey of the Democratic
County Central Committee appeared be
fore the Supervisors to-day and handed
In a communication which reads as fol
lows:
Pursuant to authority vested in me by a
formal resolution of the Union Campaign Com
mittee, a copy of which, duly authenticated by
the secretary, is hereto appended and matle a
part hereof, I most respectfully submit the
j following list of appointments to your honor

I tlnn booths ut the election to take place No

I raent. Very respectfully submitted,
M. F. TARPET,
Chairman Union Campaign Committee.
Supervisor Roeth asked the District At
torney to provide the board with an opin
ion as to whether they were legally re
quired to take the lists of names of elec
tion officers submitted by the different
parties.
District Attorney Snook said he had
looked up the matter and was prepared to
render his opinion. He safd it was purely
a matter of policy as far as the board was
concerned. He. said it was the duty of the
board to select the election officers from
among the various political parties, but
there was no law which provided a
method for doing so, although it might be
good policy for the Supervisors to confer
with the leaders of the several parties.
Mr. Snook read from the Political Code,
showing that the legal requirement is ful
filled if every party casting 5 per cent of
the total vote is represented on the Elec
tion Board.
Mr. Roeth said that in making up their
lists the Supervisors, with all the knowl
edge they had before them, believed they
had legally distributed the offices among
all pariies", and he wanted to know who
hid the right to question the qualifica
tion of any man appointed by the board
to serve. The District Attorney replied
that it was a matter for the courts to
decide, as only the court could positively
ascertain the party affiliations of a man.
In reply to a question from Roeth, Mr.
Snook said that a county central com
mittee had no more authority in this mat
ter than an individual.
Mr Tnrpey's communication was re
ceiv.d and placed on file. Upon examin
ing the lists it was found that in a great
many instances the names submitted by
Mr Tarpey were already on the board's
list. .

MBS. KEENAN STILL LIVES.
Chief Sullivan of the Fire Depart
ment Has Her Removed to the
German Hospital.
Mrs. Anna Keenan, who was, It was
thought, fatally shot by her husband,
"Patsy Hogan," the ex-pugillst, at 122
Olive avenue, Wednesday afternoon, was
taken to the German Hospital yesterday
afternoon by orders of Chief Sullivan of
the Fire Department. She Is in a low
condition and In the opinion of Dr. Wart
ley cannot possibly recover.
She made an amended ante-mortem
statement yesterday, in which she tried
to throw as little blame aH possible upon
her husband. She requested that, in the
event of her death, he would not be
banked, and thus bring disgrace to their
five children. Four or Keenan's wounds
have already healed and the fifth Is heal
ing rapidly. He will be removed from the
hospital to the City Prison to-day and
charged. He expresses deep contrition
for his act.
Two of the children were taken to Oak
land yesterday by a friend of the family,
who wanted to adopt them, but Mrs.
Keenan expressed a desire that the child
ren should not be separated and the Sis
ters of the Holy Family will take charge
of them. Efforts are being made to get
the position of janltress in the Crocker
building for the oldest girl In order that
she may succeed her mother.

She May Not Be Able to Get Out
Until Springâ Bescue Vessel
Fitting Out.
NEW YORK, Oct. 20.â A special dis
patch from St. John, N. 8., to the
Herald says: Captain William Bartlett,
a brother of the captain of the Wind
ward, Perry's vessel, has returned from
Turnsvick, bringing reports that seem to
shew that the explorer will not be able
to get out of the frozen seas before the
ppriiiff. He says the Indications along the
Labrador coast foreshadow an early and
severe fall. He never saw the Ice form
more rapidly than about his vessel on the
night of the 16th.
The Windward intended to go to Sheer
ard, Osborne Fiord, to land the Peary
party. Lieutenant Peary thought it
probable that the vessel might get frozen
in there and have to remain all winter.
This contingency was provided for by
carrying eighteen months 1 provisions, so
no fear is felt for ..heir safety should the
vessel not return this fall. Whalers are
frequently nipped and frozen In all winter.
The Windward went 100 miles farther
north than the whalers go. Captain Bart
lett thinks the Windward may get clear.
She is a slow ship, and may be steaming,
or, if out of coal, probably sailing south
ward.
J interviewed Walter Bayne Grieve, the
agent of the Hope. He Bays he has no ex
pectation of Peary getting back this year.
He Ik fitting up the Hope to start for his
reocue next spring.

THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL., FRIDAY, OCTOBER 21, 1898.
DETECTED THIEF
KILLS HIMSELF
Omaha Public Library
Sensation.
BURGLAR AFTER RARE COINS
HAD HIDDEN HIMSELF IN THE
BUILDING.
Watchman Aroused by Violent Ring-
Ing of Alarms â Being Cornered
the Man Blows Out
His Brains. '
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OMAHA, Oct. 20.â An unknown man
has committed suicide at the public
library here under mysterious circum
stances. Everything points to the fact
that he had secreted himself in the
building the night before with the in
tention of stealing the priceless collec
tion of coins of the Byron Heed dona
tion. "U'hen detection and capture con
fronted him he coolly placed a revolver
to his temple and fired a bullet into j
his brain. When the watchman rushed
upon the scene the man was dead.
The body appears to be that of a man
of culture, but there Is nothing by
which It may be identified.
The police believe the man was a vis
itor at the exposition who possessed
technical knowledge, and was, perhaps,
a collector of rare coins himself. Rec
ognizing the vaiue of the treasure, sep
arated from him only by a glass case,
they think he determined to seize it,
and for that purpose visited the library
In the evening and secreted himself
ready for the work. Early in the morn
ing the watchman noticed the burglar
alarms leading to the Reed collection
ringing violently. An investigation fol- I
lowed, and then the suicide's weapon
exploded and the man fell dead In the I
hail in front of the watchman.
The door leading to the Reed collec- J
tlon had been tampered with. This is I
the fourth time burglars have attempt
ed to loot the exhibit. The thousands
of gold coins of all nations it includes
represent a large fortune, to say noth
ing of the value o? the coins as rare
specimens and complete sets of the
specie of all nations.

BRIDGE DEDICATED
Four Thousand Persons Participate
in the Ceremony and Subse-
quent Festivities.
VENTURA, Oct. 20.â The new county
bridge, spanning Santa Clara River be
tween El Rio and Montalvo, was dedi
cated to-day in the presence of over 4000
people. Delegations from the east and
west sides of the river met at their re
epective approaches to the bridge under
the leadership of T. A. Rice for the east
side and B. W. Dudley for the west side.
The processions started at 11 o'clock.
Each division halted at the center of the
bridge Btructure at the speaker's plat
form. The Ventura City Band and Huen
eme Band furnished music. D. W. Mott
delivered an address of welcome and then
introduced C. L. Bard, president of the
Ventura County Pioneer Society, who
took oharKe of the proceedings. Mrs. M.
E Dudley read an original poem, and \V*.
A. Burrell, president of the California
Bridge and Construction Company, made
a few remarks. Hon. W. E. Shepherd
was orator of the day. Numerous prom
inent county citlzenÃ also made short ad
dressee.
The next feature was the driving of a
golden spike with golden hummers by
two young ladies, native daughters of the
valleyâ Mies Mt-rrlli Rice and Miss Ethel
Dudleyâ assisted by Misses Annie Hart
man Iva Kelsey, Dora Crane. Carrie
Borchurd, Grace Flynn and Arlie Mott
as guards of honor. Miss Zadle Soule of

Veteran*.
After the ceremonies there was a grand
barbecue and basket picnic.
This celebration was one of the largest
in the history of the county. Large dele
gations from all sections were present.
All places of business in this city were
closed during the entire day. Besides
two regular trains there was a special
train to the bridge, which proved inade
quate for tnuispurtlng all who desired to
go by ra.ll, and many went in carriages.
This bridge spans one of the widest
river bottoms in Southern California.
This river in winter Is also one of the
most dangerous in the State. Many
lives have been lost in attempting to ford
the stream in the rainy season. VI ork on
the structure was commenced early laet
spring, the total cost to the county being
about $40,000.
DESPERATE EFFORT TO
VINDICATE BOSS REA
Arguments of His Counsel Consume
Another Day and Are Tet
Unfinished.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 20.â Argument was con
tinued in the Jarman-Rea slander suit to
day, and the case will probably go to the
Jury to-morrow evening. Counsel for de
fense argued all day.
Attorney Burchard took up his argu
ment where he left off at the adjourn
ment of the court yeaterday afternoon.
He claimed that the suit for slander was
not brought in good faith but was a po
litical scheme and begun for political pur
poses only. The attorney took up the evi
dence and analyzed It. lie said no slan
der had been committed, and attempted
to prove there was no evidence to sun
tain the charge. Roa. according to the
speaker, was the Injured party and the
one persecuted.
Senator H. V. Morehouse followed also
for the defense. He made an eloquent ap
peal to the Jury. The law of slander was
fully and clearly explained. The testi
mony waa reviewed. It was claimed that
th^ witness.-* who heard Rea's utterances
did not understand them to be slanderous,
and consequently It was not slanderous.
The attorney said Rea had used the
words charged to him, but they were not
in the nature of charging Jarman with
receiving a bribe. Jarman was not in
the council at the time the roller was
purchased and at the time of the alterca
tion the roller had not been purchased,
and consequently the words, "There was
} r Â«n) paid to some of the Councilmen on
the purchase and you got $400 of it," ad
dressed to Jarman, wen; not slanderous.
He spoke the balance of the afternoon and
will occupy to-morrow forenoon.
Attorney Delmas will follow with his
closing statement.

ROOSEVELT'S
REPORT HAS
BEEN STIFLED
But It Makes Noise in
Staff Departments.
CONDITION OF ROUGH RIDERS
DEPRIVATIONS THEY WERE
CAUSED TO STTFÂ±Â£R.
The Colonel Submits Information !
That Will Eventually Beach
the War Investigation
Commission.
Special Dispatch to The- Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 20.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: If Colonel Roosevelt's report
has been stifled by the administration
under the mass of reports of other
colonels It has nevertheless made some
noise In each of the staff departments.
It has been submitted to the commis
sary general, quartermaster general
and surgeon general, who have been re
quested to make replies to the allega
tions it contains.
The report, together with these re
plies, will be turned over to the Army
Investigation Commission. The replies
in some instances are quite spirited.
Colonel Roosevelt's report does not con
tain more than three or four pages of
typewritten matter, but It deals mi
nutely with the condition of the Hough
Riders, noting the causes thereof from
the time of landing until the close of
the campaign. Its tone is one of com
plaint throughout, with special refer
ence to deprivations which the Rough
Riders are said to have suffered.
It is written in the frank, aggressive
style of Colonel Roosevelt, and t.he copy
handed to the Secretary of War was
wrlten in pencil, the others being
copies of this. There is no reference to
General Shafter by way of criticism
nor to the round robin. The chief com
plaint lies against the department of
the quartermaster general, which failed
to land and carry forward supplies that
seemed to have been fully supplied by
other departments.
The only complaint against the com
missary general's department lay in
what was termed the unpalatableness
of the "tinned roast bevf." While not
making specific complaints the report
tells of the condition of the Rough
Riders In any other than rosy terms.
COLONEL BRYAN IS
EXCUSED FROM TESTIFYING
JACKSONVILLE, Via., Oct. 20.â The
War Investigation Commisssion con
cluded Its labors at Jacksonville to-day
and shortly after 10 o'clock left for At
lanta, expecting to take up business
there.
The commission has been here four
days, this being the first of the camps
to be visited, and It has been awarded
Bomewhat more time than will be given
to other points, with the possible ex
ception of Chickamauga.
The Commissioners are generally
pleased with the result of their labors
there. They have naturally met with
complaints, but these have been dealt
with and they did not indicate neglect
or mismanagement. Generally one
private or non-commissioned officer
fmm each regiment has been called,
and in many cases more than one. In
the case of enlisted men they wore se
.lected at random, the Commissioners
merely asking that men be sent to
them without any specification of the
purpose for which they were called.
They have without exception said that
they were receiving enough to eat and
wear. There were occasional com
plaints of defects in clothing or a re
quest for a greater variety of food, but
In no Instance has a spirit of fault
finding been developed among this class
of witnesses. In some cases a defi
ciency of supplies at the beginning of
the camp's history was shown, and
there has been more or less tainted
meat received by the men, but it was
agreed by all the witnesses that the
first condition was duo to the conges
tion at Tampa, and the latter to the
climate.
(General McCook and Colonel Saxton
returned to-day from their Investiga
tion of conditions at Tampa. They
found that the congestion that oc
curred at that point at the beginning
of the war was due to the fact that
cars were shipped from all over the
country without being labeled and
without forwarding bills of lading-.
At to-day's session Lieutenant Mor-
I row, acting commissary of the Third
j Nebrnksa, Colonel Bryan's regiment,
' testified to the general good character
iof the commissary supplies. He men
tioned one or two instances when poor
bacon had been received, and said there
were occasional complaints from the
men, though not of a serio-uH character.
Colonel William J. Bryan was next
called. He asked to be excused from
testifying, requesting that his lieuten
ant colonel be examined in his stead.
"You will, I have no doubt, under
stand my reasons for the request?" he
said. .
"I think the request very proper and
reasonable," responded Governor
Beaver, and as the entire commission
assented to this concession. Colonel
Hryan was excused.

PHELAN'S COLONISTS
DISFRANCHISED
Lost Their Right to Vote, and in
Consequence They Cannot
Hold Office.
The "Hefting" Mayor's Little Scheme to Beat One-
Half of the City Out of Representation
Fails Because It Is a Fraud.
When James D. Phelan, the "hefting"
Mayor of San Francisco, connived at
the crime by which Wldber looted the
city treasury through his dereliction of
duty, incompetence was the worst that
was charged against him. In his de-
fense of ward colonization on the part
of his henchmen there Is something
worse than incompetence â he delib
erately indorses a fraud against the
ballot.
The Call has shown that Bylngton.
Bartlett, Qutte and Deasy have regis
tered aa voters in wards other than
those in which they live. Eugene P.
Murphy also registered in the Ninth
Ward when he lived In the Eleventh,
but his heart failed him and he threw
up the nomination and went back
"home."
When Murphy weakened It became
necessary to get some one else to fill
the place, and as there Is no Democrat
In the whole of the Ninth Ward with
â¢whom Boss Phelan cares to associate,
Charles Gildea of 1020 Mission street
â was 'â¢advised" to move down to 456
Sixth streetâ temporarilyâ and qualify
by registering from there. Gildea
moved and registered, but he, like By
lngton, Bartlett, Deasy and Outte, still
retains his home at the old place and
is living a dual existenceâ living a lie
in the Ninth Ward while he has his
home at 1020 Mission street.
At 1020 Mission it is said that Gildea
sM'I lives there, hi* morning paper is
still delivered at 1020 Mission and a
light may be seen burning in his room
at 3/>2O Mission every nieht.
According to the published state
ments of Phelan and the Examiner,
the accepted Democratic organ, these
chances of residence were "temporary."
According to the Political Code of the
State temporary residence does not
give the necessary qualifications to en
title a man to vote. According to the
best legal opinion disqualification as a
voter disqualifies as a candidate, and
It matters not wTiether the man at
tempts to vote or not, for a man to be
eligible as a candi-date must be a quali
fied voter.
This, then. Is thue position of Lewis
F. Byington. Lewis de F. Bartlett, Jere
miah Deasy, Isadore Gutte and Charles
Gildea: They have illegally registered
in ivards other than those in which
they live: they dare not attempt to vote
for fear they will be compelled to swear
that they have permanently changed
their residence: they are not legal
voters of the city and county of San
Francisco, and consequently are not
eligible for office In the city and county
of San Francisco.
The question of the location of a
man's home wag never more tersely
specified than by Jo Hamilton, ex-At
torney General of the State, when he
said: "Home is whar Betsy and the
babies live." Not one of these men
took "Betsy and the babies" with him
when he moved from a luxurious home
to the cramped quarters of a cheap
lodging-house, and while all may not be
so fortunate as to have "Betsy and
babies" they have their little house
hold gods, their lares and penates, their
books and little comforts that every
man, be he married or single, accumu
lates about him in the place he calls
"home."
So much fOT the catspaws which -vere
to be used in raking political chestnuts
from the fire for Monkey Phelan. They
have transgressed the election laws of
the State, and as the Grand Jury Is In
session it is for that body to say what
Investigation shall be made into the
matter.
Phelan has used these men to further
his own ends. Thanking God that he
is not like other men he decides that
there is no Democrat in the Third,
Fifth, Seventh, Ninth or Tenth wards
who is honest enough or fit to sit in
council with him. In order to get Just
the kind of men he wants he sends five
men from the aristocratic portions of
the city to lord it over the residents of
those wards and then asks the men
whom he condemns to vote for his
henchmen. He doffs his Bilk hat, kid
gloves and fine raiment, and, dressed in
old clothes, a slouch hat and with bare
hands, goes down among the working
men and tells them how "he loves the
sons of toll"â and then he quarrels with
the gas company because it pays its
workmen $40 a month, saying that $25
is enough for a laborer.
Then the Subsidized Bulletin, the
paper which has done more to keep
down wages than any other influence cm
the coast, brays loudly in commenda
tion of Phelan because he condescends
to shake hands with a worklngman.
The puerile Examiner meets the
charge of fraud against Pfcelan and
ADVERTISEMENTS.

CURED BY CUTICURA
For ten years I suffered untold agonies from
Eczema, my lower limbs being so swollen and
broken oat that I could hardly go about. My
brother, a physician of thirty years 1 practice,
and other physicians of splendid ability, tried
in vain to effect a cure and signally failed. I
became absolutely disheartened, and had lost
nil hope, when a friend induced me to giro

his satellites with the old cry of the
schoolboy, "You are another." It
gravely announces that five Republi
can candidates have also changed their
residences and gone into wards and
registered illegally. On this statement
it Justifies the action of the "hefting"
Mayor, claiming that these five men
are doing exactly what The Call showed
had been done by the Democrats.
The Call has no sympathy with the
men who will attempt to gain political
preferment through fraud of any hind,
and it announced yesterday, before any
charge was made against a single Re
publican, that if any man had regis
tered illegally or had changed his resi
dence illegally, "whether he be Demo
crat, Populist, Republican or of any
other party," his name should be taken
from the ticket. It is the duty of Mr.
Higgy to cite these men to appear and
show cause why their names should
not be stricken from the great register.
The Call has shown conclusively that
five men on the Democratic ticket are
attempting to get office through fraud.
They flaunt their effrontery In the
faces of honest voters, and in this are
aided and abetted by James D. Phelan,
the "holier than thou" candidate for
Mayor who pays that the Democrats of
the Third, Fifth, Seventh. Ninth and
Tenth wards are not honest or fit
men.
These men have violated the law,
they have lost their right of suffrage
and are ineligible for office. Yet, in
the face of this, Phelan, the man who
counted Widber's cash by '"hefting" the
bags of dummies, the man who said
Sternberg should be imprisoned for life
for a similar act, says that these men
are doing right and are better than
any man in almost half of the city.

GOLDEN GATE PABK WATER.
The New Reservoir to Be Completed
by the First of November.
Superintendent McLaren expects to have !
the extension to the water system for the j
additional supplying of the Golden Gate j
Park complete on November 1. To sup- ;
ply the entire area under cultivation in
the people's pleasure ground a second !
underground reservoir is being construct
ed which will, when completed, doubla
the capacity of the present system. This
Is 1,250,000 gallons dally.
The reservoir now under construction
will be 400 feet in length. 18 feet high by
12 feet in width. Superintendent Mc-
Laren has found it necessary to construct
this reservoir, as the additional supply
is required in order to bring under culti
vation a large area of the park lands.
Under the present appropriation of
$160,000 for the ensuing year it will re
quire the greatest economy on the part
of the Park CommlÃsioners and the su
perintendent to keep the place in Its pres
ent condition without making any radi
cal changes. The amount appropriated
for the maintenance of the park as com
pared with similar places in the Bast i
shows the economy of this city. Boston, |
with its park of $271 acres, had an ap- j
propriation last year of $1,030,000. The j
pay of the police force employed In Cen- \
tral Park, New York, aggregates more
than the entire appropriation made for
Golden Gate Park. Superintendent Mc-
Laren will, however, try to add some
thing new to the already extensive im
provements In the park. At present he
is more than pleased at the electric lights
which have been placed throughout the â¢
park and about Lake Stow.
The annual report of the Park Commis
sioners was filed with the Supervisors :
yesterday. It shows substantial Improve
ments and makes the following financial
statement: ,'
Receiptsâ From taxes. $204. 534 Â«2- rent of

CLARA DREW A
BLACK BALLOT
JMiss Tkropp, Soubrette, Springs
a Suicide yam.
f^LARA THROPP, eoubrÂ«tte, and,
according to her posters, dainty,
L^PTetty, fetching and fascinating,
has perpetrated the latest adver
tising yarn, before which thÂ« loss of
a trillion-dollar solitaire, gift of an
enslaved Czar, bends its diminished
head in abject humiliation. She has
drawn the fateful black ballot In a
suicide club.
Clara haÃ just wme over from
Londonâ "dear old Lunnon"â and
she has her shrill American tongue
all tied up in an accent that's a
cross between the prickly r's of the
Alsatian French and the snarl of
a thoroughbred Scotch terrier. Ac
cording to the soubrotte, it is Eng
lish, with the London trademark;
but that, however, is quite another
story, and not Miss Thropp's griev
ance.
Mlsa Thronp has a grievance â a
bona-flde grievance. Her managers
say It is that she hasn't nearly been
mangled in a railway accident or
kidnaped by an Infatuated blind
man. or been the heroine of any old
thing. Miss Clara says it's the 8. S.
S. F. S. C which, explained, stands
for the Secret Society San Fran
cfsco Suicide Club. According to the
actress, when she last visited this
C lty_without her London accentâ in
A. I>. 1Â£93, a friend Induced her to
become a member of a. suicide club,
with headquarters in this city. Clara
plunked down her double eagleâ the
initiation feeâ pocketed her member

QUEER DELAY IN
APPORTIONING
CITY FUNDS
Supervisors' Commit
tee Hangs Back.
NOT READY TO REPORT
IS SAID TO BE WATTING FOB
MOBTON.
An Important Change in the Schedule
Is Expected by Those Who
riaim to Have Inside
Information.
Certain peculiar actions on the part of
the Finance Committee of the Board of
Supervisors are beginning to attract at
tention. The committee has persistently
declined to present to the board a resolu
tion segregating the funds of the various
departments, although four meetings
have been held sine; the tax levy tm
fixed. It 1b ciiÃtomary for the Supervis
ors to formally segregate the fuuds at
the meeting following the fixing of the
levy. Last year there was pome delay,
owing to the turmoil occasioned by the
claims of two rival boards, but in 1596 the
apportionment or segregation was or
dered on September 28, while in 1895 It was
adopted on September 3.
According to the understood programme
of the Finance Committee this year, the
segregation will not take place untl
Monday, November 7. or possibly until
Monday, November 14. The lateness of
this date Is without precedent in tho an
nals of the board, f*\d lends color to the
statement now In circulation that the de
lay is caused by the absence of Supervis
or Morton from the city. His thirty-day
leave of absence expires on November 2,
and the next meeting of the Supervisors
takes Place on the 7th. It Is alleged that
the vote of Morton is wanted to effect
certain radical changes in the Bchedule
as heretofore prepared for apportioning
the JO 0:.', 555 03 <<t the tax levy, and to
which the board agreed prior to the de
parture of Mr. Morton for the East.
When the Supervisors met on Septem
ber 26 it was expected that the Finance
Committee would report the customary
resolution, segregating the funds. But
the committee reported that it was not
ready. Again, on October 3, the Super
visors met and the committee had no
resolution to offer. The same thing hap
pened on October 10. Again the commit
tee hold back. The fact attracted atten
tion In connection with the action of the
majority of the board In voting to lay
over until November 7 consideration of
the gaÂ« veto.
It Tias been discovered that the Finance
Committee prepared over three weeks
ago a resolution segregating the funds,
and that the same has been held in wait
ingâfor Smith. That there is a deal on
is evident from the symptoms of the
case but the Supervisors in the confi
dence of the committee keep their own
counsels, despite certain sensational
stories that are being circulated regard-
Ing their intentions. It is frequently stat
ed that the closing sessions of the present
Board of Supervisors will probably be pro
lific in jobbery, but the facts remain to
be developed. It !s safe to say, however,
that there will be EomÂ© changes in the

police protection. Miss Thropp was
apparently hysterical, and cried In
tones that suggested a soubrette
dinner. "It has come! It Is dread
ful! I must be protected! I won't
commit suicide, as this horrid letter
commands."
When the lady was finally pacified
ehe showed the manager an epistle
the fac-simlle of which ornaments
this tale of her woes. Then came
the manager's turn. "My Heaven!"
he exclaimed, "this Is the greatest
thing that ever happened. Don't be
alarmed. We will all protect you.
Go home at once and get that sui
cide contract and I'll summon a re
porter."
The reporter came. The Bupers all
stood around, dressed In stage police
men clothes. Then the fascinating,
fetching Thropp burst into sight.
"Where's the contract?" shouted the
manager. "I can't find It," said
Thropp. "I must have left It in my
box at the Stewart House in New
York. But I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll wire for It, and I'll let you have
It In the morning."
Miss Thropp plainly recalls many

Miss Thropp insists that she Is not

reality and not a myth and that she
will call Chief Lees' attention to the
threatening tone of the letter, which
she vows she did not write to her

NEW RAILROAD FOR CHINA.
The First American Line to Traverse
the Flowery Kingdom.
William Barclay Parsons, a civil en
gineer of national reputation, left here
yesterday for China for the purpose of
making a reconnolssance for a railroad
from Hankow, on the Yangtse-Kiang,
to Hongkong, a distance of about 650
miles. The concession that has been
granted by the Chinese Government to
an American syndicate covers the build
ing of the road between the points men
tioned, together with certain branches to
coal mines and neighboring districts.
The chief promoters of the enterprise
are Senator Calvin S. Brice. ex-Vice
President Morton, several representatives
of the Standard Oil Company, the Cen
tral Trust Company of New York and a
number of New York's largest private
banking houses. The Chinese Govern
ment is to repay the syndicate the cost
of the work, and a certain percentage on
that cost for profit. Then the syndicate
in to have charge of the operation of the
road for a period of forty-five years,
taking 20 per cent of the net profits, the
balance going to a Chinese company. At
the end of that period the Chinese com
pany will have complete possession of the
road.
This Is absolutely the first American
railroad enterprise In China, and if suc
cessful will undoubtedly pave the way for
many more. The total â¦ail road mileage
In China at the present lime will not ex
ceed 150 miles, and those lines are located
In the north near Peking.

The coming of Mr. Hearst was the op

THE REGISTRAR
UNEARTHS A
GREAT FRAUD
United Labor Party
Petitions Bad.
ARE FILLED WITH FORGERIES
THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED TO
THE GRAND JURY.
Grace and Smiley, the Chairmen,
May Have Trouble Over Their
Efforts to Break Into
Politics.
Registrar Biggy rejected the petitions of
the two so-called "United I^abor parties"
with W. P. Grace and James Smiley as j
chairmen. In addition to rejecting the
petitions of those two parties, covering
nineteen candidates, Mr. Biggy presented |
the petitions and other evidence to the j
Grand Jury for the information of that I
body.
The reasons for such rejection are set
forth in a specific manner by Mr. Biggy
in his letters to Grace and Smiley, which j
were sent last night. The reason for pre- j
senting the petitions to the Grand Jury
is that on all the petitions were indisput
able evidences of fraud and forgery.
The following copy of the letter sent to
Grace shows what was found upon In
vestigating the petitions:
SAN FRANCISCO. Oct. 20. 1898.
W. P. Grace, Esq., United Labor Partyâ Dear
Sir: The nomination papers of the alleged
United Labor party presented by you for fil
ing with the names of certain candidates there
on and requested to be placed upon the official
ballot have been fully examined by me aa to
the form required by law and as to the genu
ineness of the signatures of the persons whose
names purport to be thereto subscribed, and I
find a* follows:
Firstâ The United Labor party is not a party
within the meaning of Section 1186. Political
Code, and candidates nominated by electors are
not the nominees of a political party, but the
Individuals nominating them.
Secondâ facÂ« of the certificate shows
that "We represent the United Labor party."
The statutes governing nominations do not
permit the nomination of a person as the can
didate of a regularly existing political party
to be made by petition of unorganized elect
ors, and a candidate nominated by electors is
not nominated by a political party and has no
right to be placed upon U.Â« ballot as the can
didate of an organized existing party.
Thirdâ Section 11SS provides the manner In
which candidates may be nominated otherwise
than by existing parties: each elector must
sign In person and add to the same his resi
dence, giving street and number. The law
further provides that "Any person signing to
sue* certificate of nomination any name but
hla own. or any person making false oath to
such certificate of nomination, shall be pun
ished by imprisonment in the State's Prison
not exceeding five years."
Fourthâ FranK Buckley, by whom one of the
affidavits to the genuineness of signatures to
said certificate of nomination was made. Is not
one of the signers to said certificate, and Wal
ter Hlggins, who swore to the genuineness of
another paper, is not an elector of the city
and c-junty of San Francisco.
Fifth â an examination made of 1860 names
subscribed to the various nominating papers
22S are found to be forgeries, and only 467 are
registered and at the address set opposite their
names. More than 1000 are fictitious and appear
to be written by a few persons.
Sixthâ The certificate of nomination is not
signed by electors equal In number to three
per cent of the entire vote cast In the city and
county of. Ban Francisco at the last general
election.
The- various nomination papers are fraudulent
upon their face and In violation of the statutes
enacted to promote the purity of elections.
I therefore decline tn file the certificate of
nomination presented by W. P. Grace of the
"United Labor Party. " Respectfully
W. 3. RIOGT. Registrar o{ Voters.
A similar letter was sent to Smiley, In
which was the following statement:
More than tOO names presented aa signers of
a former petition of nomination which was
rejected by m* are now attached to the second
certificate of nomination containing a different
set of nominees from the first; these alleged
electors Joined in nominating other candidates
than those now presented.
Fifthâ Seventeen hundred and twenty-eight
names subscribed thereto have been examined
and 166 are forgeries. 336 are registered and at
the address set opposite their names. More
than 12(i0 names art> fictitious and are written
by a few arsons other than those they pur
port to b*.
The United Labor party represented by
Grace sent in petitions for trie following
nineteen candidates: J. H. Whitty, Frank
rtuckley. Thomas Wren. William Green,
E<l. J. Smith, D. E. Tobin. Ed. Whelan,
E Richards, John J. Lynch. Walter Hlg
gins W. P. Grace. Frank W. Neill. P. F.
Norton. G. F. Powelson, D. P. Duncan,
J. B Colbert, Peter Petersen and Charles
A. bracket.
The party represented by Smiley sent
petition* for C. W. FnkÂ»r. James Smiley,
J. W. Singleton, John Moore and William
liarner.
All other petitions have been found
proper, and dv this evening the candi
dates will all have their numbers on the
regular ticket.
The investigation of these T nlted Labor
tickets has been going on in the Regis
trar's office Plnco last Saturday night and
a remarkable state of affairs has been
unearthed. Out of a total of 3608 names
on all of the petitions it was found that
but 881 were genuine, there being 394 for
geries and 2059 names that are not on the
register. The balance of the names were
so Indefinite that It could not be decided
what they were. In order to thoroughly
sift these petitions it was necessary to
take every name and go to the certifi
cates of registration and compare the sig
natures of the signers with the genuine.
This work wns thoroughly done by the
Registrar's deputies, and the investiga
tion showed a most gigantic fraud.
The subject of personal petitions ha*)
been a troublesome one In the Registrar's
office for many years, and this is the first
time a systematic Investigation has been
made. T*he. result will be a revelation to
many candidates who have been In the
habit of donating money to the cause of
the alleged United Labor party for the
purpose of getting support there. The
petitions presented the appearance of
having been copies! to a large extent di
rectly from some list of names, and the
great majority of tho names were written
In the same handwriting.
PBOF. VAN DEH NAILLUN HOMTS.
He Made a Thorough Study of the
* Wireless Telegraphic System.
Professor A? Van der Naillen, Mrs. Van
der Naillen and their daughter Rena
have Just returned from a seven months'
tour through Europe. The professor has
visited the principal schools of mines and
universities *of France and Belgium,
and he states that our California institu
tions are equal and in many respects su
perior to them, especially by their prac
tical methods, if not in their extended
theories. The Electro-Technical Institute
Monteflore of Liege, Belgium, he finds a
school of superior merit. In It he stud
ied the new system of telegraphy without
wires, aiming at preventing collisions at
sea between vessels during dense fogs.
The professor states that accidents like
the one which sent the French liner La
Bourgoyne to the bottom can now bÂ»
avoided, as wireless telegraphy can trans
mit signals at sea during the densest fog
or darkness at a distance of thirty miles,
and real telegraphic messages can be ex
changed at seven ml leu.
