TOWER HILL.. 111., Sept. 30.â Three
hundred striking union miners from
Pana to-day held up a special Balti
more and Ohio Southwestern train con
veying fifty-five Washington, Ind.,
negro miners to Pana to take the place
of union miners. The negroes were
taken from the cars and compelled to
â¢walk back to Tower Hill, where they
â were locked up in the depot until 10
o'clock to-night. At that hour the
negroes were placed on board an east
bound train and taken back to In
diana at the expense of the Miners'
Union. g?;i "
The miners were all armed and
masked.
News of the capture of the blacks
having reached Sheriff Coburn at
Pana, he sent an armed posse ,of 100
deputies, including negroes from
Springside Camp, toward this town to
intercept the miners on their return.
Sheriff Coburn's force had not arrived
at a late hour. In case they fail to ap
pear the miners will remain here over
night and take a roundabout way home.
It Is believed a battle will be precipi
tated if the Coburn forces show up in
this vicinity. The Sheriff of this county
refused to interfere with the union
men.
PANA. 111., Sept. 30.â Light Battery B
of ialesburg arrived on a special train
from Springfield this afternoon. The j
battery consists of two Gatling guns
and sixty-eight men with side arms and
Springfield rifles, in charge of Captain J
â¢ Craig. Two companies of the Sons of i
vÂ«>t f> rang a.*ro.m^.. .\ursia~. *>n_Â«lâ Elilt- â iÂ«
â  ifitnm.ui.-' of Co'oriel Hamilton, arrived â 
this eveiilng. They were equipped with t
guns at Springfield and mustered in as j
National Guards.
: The militia is in full charge of the j
city to-night and are parading the
business streets. The utmost quiet pre- j
vails.
Last night was a terrorizing one for
the people of Pana. Two-thirds of the
residences were unoccupied and each
Df the others contained a group of fam
ilies, lit some cases all the residents
of an entire block spent the dark hours
In one home, armed, terrorized and
a-waitlng the attacks expected to be
made on 1 their homes by the negroes
a Imported from Alabama.
All :ilK&t the striking union miners,
â¢ rein: m d by brother miners from
1 Dther to"*viis, armed with shotguns and
rifles, paraded the streets or lay in am
bush on housetops and In alleys await
ing the coming of blacks from the
Spr\ -de and Pen well stockades, who
had announced an Intention to march j
Into the city and drive out the whites.
Deputy sheriffs, however, were success- |
ful in keeping the negroes within the
stockades. Many shots were fired in
the vicinity of the mines throughout j
the night, but with what result could j
not be ascertain^
To-day, In response to Sheriff Co
burn's urgent appeal. Battery B of
Galesburg and two companies of Ham- |
ilton's Sons of Veterans were ordered
to Pana. They are, by the Governor's
Instructions, to protect the lives of cit
izens and their property, but, under no j
consideration, are they to assist the j
mine owners operating the mines with j
Imported ' labor. *i ;â * . '
Many visiting miners, heavily armed,
arrived to-day.
On the arrival of the troops in Pana i
It Is intended to have all citizens, white I
X.or, black, disarmed by the militia. Sher
Â«lff Coburn, in wiring for troops last
â¢ evening, reported one black killed in
Wednesday's riot and several wounded.
' jklayor ?Â«nwell, son of Operator Pen
weiir-Â£Pent last night In the stockades.
He said he was afraid of being mobbed
by the miners and that his father had
left the city.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., Sept. 30.â
garding a report that he had refused
to send three hundred rifles to the
Sheriff at Pana, Governor Tanner to
day said:
"I never refused. On the contrary,
' when the Sheriff last Saturday made a
requisition for 200 rifles, I forwarded by
'â¢! rush order the 200 rifles and 2000 rounds ]
lof ammunition. ; Yesterday I received I
an urgent ; telegram from the Sheriff
t asking for troops. After several tele
's phone conversations with him, i became J
so impressed with the importance and
' needs of the ' situation that I ordered
the Galesburg Battery and two com
panies of the Sons of Veterans' Regi
ment to report at Pana for duty by the
. first train. I. directed Captain Craig, in
command, to arrest and disarm all per
sons carrying arms and hold such arms
ii until further orders, to protect citizens
>f and"' their property, and to maintain or

command to aid the mine owners in

HOSPITAL SCANDALS
War Investigation Commission Begins to Carry Out
the Injunction of tr;e President to "Let
No Guilty Mao Escape."
WASHINGTON, Sept. 30.â The
war investigation commission
to-day decided to ask General
Lee to follow General Wheel
er in giving testimony con
cerning the charges made against the
War Department and tamed Wednes
day of next week as a date when he
could be heard. General Wheeler will
be before the commission on Tuesday
and will be interrogate} both about
Camp Wikoff and the Santiago cam
paign, the examination concerning San
tiago covering especially the facilities
for caring for the sick and wounded
and the precautions tak m to preserve
the health of the men in the trenches.
The commissioners state their purpose
to be to make a very complete investi
gation of these features of the Santiago
siege, but Vice Denby stated
to-day that the subject of calling Gen
eral Miles or General Shafter had not
been yet under consideration. The de
cision to call General Lee was due to
the fact that he is in the city and is
liable to be soon ordered to Cuba.
The commission to-day continued Its
examination f letters bearing upon
charges of mismanagement â some call
ing attention to such charges and oth
ers attempting to refute them. Many
of the letters referred to newspaper re
ports of abuse and In most of such
cases letters were sent to the editors

The Democratic State Central Commit
te met In solemn conclave - yesterday
morning and decided that while the com
mittee of one hundred job- chasers, who
are loyal Jto Bosses^Phelan and "Whis
pering" McNab. had 'exceeded its powers,
it would be inadvisable at present to de
throne the usurpers. It was pictured, in
eloquent terms that if the Democratic
"patriots" who consider place and office
holding far above party principle were
now thrust out of power, the slight pros
pects of James Gallagher Maguire warm
ing the gubernatorial chair would be
greatly diminished. <
When the committed was called to or
der by Chairman Seth Mann there was a
stir of excitement among the members
of the "second house" who occupied
seats in the rear of the hall. They ex
pected "great things," but were doomed
to disappointment. They believed that
the State Committee would hold that the
Phelan committee of one hundred office
seekers, that was' resolved into a conven
tion to : indorse the "slate," would be se-' j
Verely condemned for not heeding the
(Suggestion of the State Convention, that
a primary be held in San Francisco for <
the election of delegates to a municipal j
nominating convention. :
The first business transacted was the I
acceptance of the resignation of Charles !
W. Logan, who has been nominated for j
State Senator from the Twenty-sixth
Senatorial District. Chairman Mann was
authorized to act in conjunction with the ;
executive committee in filling the va- â 
cancy.
M. C. Hassett, who appeared as chief j
"spieler" for the job chasers, then pre
sented a report announcing that ten mem
bers of the so-called Democratic Com-<
mittee of One Hundred had resigned in
the hope of being nominated on the local
ticket, and that the vacancies had been
filled. He asked that the State Commit] j
tee ratify the selection of the member*
who succeeded the office-seekers.
M. F. Tarpey of Alameda next claimed
tli* floor and presented a series of reso- !
lutions denouncing the Phelan-McNab's
committee for having in contravention of.
all Democratic principles resolved itself
into a convention to nominate municipal} j
county and legislative officers. The resoJ
lutions were as follows: - â¢ , :|

FUSIONISTS ARE
RECOGNIZED AS
PEOPLE'S PARTY
The Supreme Court Decides
Against Shanahan and
His Associates.
â 
Middle-of-the-Road Candidate for Governor
Fails to Open His Campaign at
Metropolitan Hall.
The Supreme Court yesterday put to
deuth the middle-of-the-road People's
party of California, and last night at
Metropolitan Hall. A. Bretz of Oakland,
the "Father of Populism" In this State'
delivered the funeral oration before a
small gathering df the faithful.
T. W. H. Shanahan, the "Tall Syca
more of Shasta," who was nominated for
Governor hy the middle-of-the-road fac
tion, and his associates on the State
ticket are bereft of any standing as reg
ular nominees of a party under the de
cision handed down by the Supreme Court,
and James G. Maguire and the other fu
sion candidates will go on the official bal
lot in November as the regular Populist
nominees.
The decision was in the case in man
damus brought by E. L. Hutchison and
E. M. T .Vardall to compel Secretary of
State L. H. Brown to place the fusion
candidates on the State ticket and to re
move th^ names of the middle-of-the-road
men therefrom. Chief Justice Beatty
wrote the decision, which was in favor
of the petitioners, and it was concurred
in by ali the other Justices.
That it had a most depressing effect
upon the. middle-of-the-road Populists
was shown by the fact that for several
days Shanahan had been announced to
formally open the compnign in this clty
at Metropolitan Hall last night, but he
failed to mukc his appearance. Neither
did T. V. Cator nor Carleton Johnson, or
any of the other leaders of the middle-of
the-road faction, except A. Brttz, who
had been billed to preside at the meet
ing. By 8 o'clock probably 300 people were
scattered over the big hall and for naif
an hour they amused themselves with
calls for Shanahan. Tnat gentleman did
not make his appearance, however, and
finally Mr. Brett sorrowfully announced
that he feared that upon him had fallen
the duty of delivering the funeral ora
tion over the People's party. This he pro
ceeded to do. reviewing the birth, growth
and decay of that branch which refused |

conform their action to the plan of
fusion, then such nominees should be
withdrawn and the nominees of the
Democrats and Silver-Republicans
substituted. Before this plan was re
Â£ortert to the convention James G.
laguireâ a Democratâ had been nomi
nated for Governor, and, although that
was an office alloted to the Democrats
in tho plan of fusion, it was excepted
from the arrangement for withdraw
ing candidates in favor of the nomi
nees of the other parties. In other
words Judge Maguire was to be the
i opullst candidate for Governor,
whatever happened, provided only if
he would accept the nomination.
As soon as Judge Maguire was nom
inated a minority of the conventionâ
protesting against the action of the
majorityâ withdrew and organized an
other convention in another room. Of
about ICO delegates actually present 53
participated In the new organization
Ihe remaining delegates went on and
nominated a full ticket, appointed
committees and adjourned. Hutchi
son and Gregory were chairman and
secretary of the original convention,
anrj Fowlor and Johnson chairman
and secretary of the rival convention
organized by the minority. Each set
of officers presented to the respond
ent certificates containing the lists of
the nominees of their respective
conventions. He filed that of the mi
nority convention, and refused to file
that of the majority convention. This
proceeding has been instituted to com
pel him to reverse his action.-
The law governing the case is found
In the Political Code (sec. 11S5 et seq )
as construed by this court in a
number of eases which we have had
occasion to consider. It was deter
mined in McDonald m Hinton, 114
vai., 484, that a political party can be
represented by but one convention,
and In case the chairmen and secreta
ries of two rival conventions present
certified lists of nominees for filing
the officer whose duty It Is to file such
certificates should determine which of

course, a full ticket of Populists, and
that if there was to be any fusion or
joint action with other parties, it was
only to be the action prescribed by
the executive committee and put
forth as part of the call for the con
vention.
As to this, it is enough to say that
according to universal party usage in
California, the central or executive
committee of a party has no function
after one election \s over, except to
preserve the organization and take the
necessary preliminary steps for the
assembling of the next convention.
It has no right to forestall or in any
manner limit or curtail the powers of
the convention which it calls. The
convention, when assembled, is the
depositary of all party power, ana so
continues until it adjourns, after
which a new committee comes into
power for the mere purpose of sub
serving the party interests pending
the election, and of doing thereafter
such things as may be provisionally
necessary to keep up the regular or
ganization and call another conven
tion. It is, therefore, of no conse
quence what resolutions the executive
committee chose to couple with us call
for the People's party Convention. They
were merely advisory, and as advis
ers were worth just what the conven
tion chose to rate them at.
This case is not like the Michigan
cases upon which the respondent re
lies to sustain his action. The Peo
ple's convention did not adjourn, and
Its members unite with other conven
tions in the formation of a new con
vention whereby its identity would
have been destroyed. It continued its
session by itself and by itself nomi
nated a full ticket as a Populist ticKet.
It proceeded regularly, and its action
cannot be questioned, because it nomi
nated men who were not Populists and
made a bargain by which some who
were not Populists were to retire in
favor of Democrats or Silver Repub
licans. It may be true that the result
i? the same as it would have been if
the three conventions had fused.
But the result is not what the bal
lot law is concerned with. What it
demands is not a Simon-pure Populist
ticket, but a ticket certified by the
chairman and secretary of a regular
Populist convention. The character
and politics of the candidates are not
the subject of inquiry for the Secre
tary of State, but only for the voters.
There is a wide difference between a
fusion convention and a fusion ticket.
A fusion convention represents no par
ticular party. A fusion ticket may .
represent several particular parties, but
is none the less entitled to a place on
the official ballot for that reason. Sev
eral conventions holding separate ses
sions do not lose their identity by se
lecting the same set of nominees. The
effect may be to causo difficulty at the
next election from the -Impossibility of
ascertaining the vote of the respect
ive parties, but that is a difficulty to
be dealt with when we come to it.
For the present we have no doubt that
the certificate presented by Hutchi
son and Gregory is the one that should
have been filed, and. consequently,
that the other certificate presented
by Fowler and Johnson should have
b<-en rejected.
The same observations apply to the
certificates of nominations of district
officers and members of Congress.
It is ordered that a peremptory writ
of mandate issue as prayed.

BUCKLEY IS
THE FRIEND Of
THE MATOH
Bound by Ties of Mu
tual Interest.
INSIDE POLITICAL HISTORY
CORDIAL RELATIONS EXISTING
BETWEEN THE BOSSES.
y
Phelan Is Under Obligations to the
Sage of Ravens wooa for â¢
Favors Done in
the Past.
Christopher A. Buckley has re-entered
the local political arena *s an active
worker in the interest of reform. He is
ready, nay, anxious, to do 'ill in his
power to further the success of the Phe
lans, the Fays and the committee of one
hundred, for which he has sundry times
expressed his highest admiration.
This personal pride on the part of Buck
ley in the achievement of the committee
of one hundred is excusable when the
past relations of many of its members
and the former Democratic leader are
taken into consideration. There is scarce
ly a man in the organization who, at some
time or other during his political career,
was not a devotee at the shrine of the
blind boss when he did business at the
old stand on Bush street.
There was a start of surprise among
the friends of Mayor Phelan when the
rumor became prevalent that he was
pleased to accept any favors that Buck
ley.might throw in his way. But the
initial shock attending the breaking of
the news has Quite worn off and now
all are reconciled to march side by side
with their old-time leader.
When Mr. Phelan entered politics as a
means of attaining public distinction, he
publicly and privately repudiated all and
everything with which Mr. Buckley was
in any way connected. The doings of
the blind boss were held up to public
scorn and ridicule and his very presence
was branded as something to be feared.
Under the banner of reform and James
Phelan these former Buckley lambs
herded themselves together, and after a
due process of evolution developed into
the hermetically sealed "committee of
one hundred." So great and good has
been the influence of this body on public
and political morals that Christopher A
Buckley, whose downfall was the cause
or its being, has repented of his past
w f a ys and means and has entered the fold
of Phelan. That he favors all the reform
measures suggested by the daring spirits
who direct the course of the committee
is â  not X believed even by his worst ene
mies, but the undisputed service that he
has rendered the Mayor on more than
one occasion of late places him 'among
the stoutest supporters of the young mil
lionaire.
Mx. Buckley , and Mr. Phelan came to
gether politically for- the first time when
hehrht art T Thr h Ol^ tlon fl^t was at its
neignt. n The Mayor admitted that he
the div the assistance available to win
the day.' Every office in the City Hall
was combined in opposition to the char- i

were leagued against it to the death.

out Â£ in , face of the programme carried
out by the committee of one hundred
no one seems able to explain. The only
plausible theory so far offered is that
Buckley and Phelan have had a personal
understanding since the chrater flgnt.
Mr. Buckley naturally feels a bit hurt
over the treatment he has received at the
hands of some members of the commit
tee of one hundred. Senator Sammy
Braunhart, for instance, has been saying
unkind things of late about his former
patron. It was Mr. Buckley who elevated
the Senator from a streetcar conductor
to a political heeler shortly after his ar
rival here from Slavonia, In those days
the Senator spoke little English and had
not acquired that rich dialect which has

The Board of Election Commissioners
had another tilt with Registrar Biggy
yesterday over bis discharge of Cleric
Cleary for alleged Impertinence to the
chief clerk In the offio . The Registrar
contender that he had a right to dis
charge whomever he chose without con
sulting Lhe board. The latter thought dif
ferently and retaliated b> awarding salary
to Cleary up to the end of the month,
althougn he had not bÂ«.on at work for
several days.
Mr. Biggy stated that he would need
ten clerks from this tinK on, but sebse
quer.tly reduced the number to six which
were allowed him.
Contractor Hughes, who is repairing
and r.painting the election booths was
granted $2000 in part payment for the
work. On recommendation of the Regis

j manhood. This was due, largely; to -their
j active out-door life. Nevertheless, they
had the wisdom to know that an active life
in the open air alone, would not keep a
man healthy. They had their medicine-
men, who gathered herbs from field and
> forest and brewed decoctions to assist the
j natural processes of the various vital
I organs.
! Modern civilized men do not as a usual
thing recognize the same necessity until it
is too late. They ignore medicine until
they are within the grasp of some serious
or fatal disease. The time for a man to be-
gin taking medicine is when he begins to
feel out of sorts. If a man is thoroughly
: well and healthy he docs not feel that way.
If he does feel that way he may be pretty
! sure that he is half sick. When he is half
sick it does not take long before he is
"whole-sick." Dr. Pierces Golden Med-
ical Discovery is the best medicine for
man when he is sick or getting sick. It
puts him all right all round. It puts his
stomach right to begin with, and that is the
most important point. It puts his liver,
right, ana that is the second most import-
ant point. It purifies his blood and fills it
with the life-giving elements of the food
he eats, and that is the third important
point. It drives out all disease germs and j
impurities of every discription. It makes
the appetite keen and hearty. It is the
greatest blood-maker and flesh-builder. . It
cures 08 per cent, of all cases of consump-
tion, weak lungs, spitting of blood, obsti-
nate coughs and kindred ailments. Thou-
sands who were given up to die have testi-
fied to their recovery under this marvelous
medicine. An honest dealer will not urge â¢

Probably Voicing the Views of the Administra

Is Significant.
CLEVELAND, Sept. 30.â The Leader
has from its Washington correspondent
the following interview with Senator
Hanna concerning the Philippine ques
tion, which is believed to represent
the views of President McKinley.
"I do not know what the instructions j
given to our Commissioners are," said i
Mr. Hanna, "but so far as concerns the
negotiations which will be instituted in j
Paris to-morrow I can see no other re
sult than that Spain will have to re
linquish h.*-r sovereignty over not only
Luzon Island, but the entire Philippine
archipelago. Spain has no reason to
expect to be able to retain any portion
of the group. She went into the war
and lost, and now ought to be prepared
to suffer the consequences which such
a defeat implies. I regard the Philip
pines as lost to Spain, and that being
a foregone conclusion, In my opinion,
the problem which next confronts us
relates to the form of government
which we will give th<-- islands.
"When, the Philip' Ine question first
presented itself there was a strong sen
timent among conservative, far-seeing
and thinking men in this country
which favored tho retention by the
United States of merely a naval base
and coaling station in the islands â this
base presumably being Manila and the
bay contiguous thereto. Since, then,
however, this sentiment apparently has
undergone a very marked change, and j
It now appears that for the most part |
these same men who at first believed
we should occupy Manila alone are
advocating the termination of Spain's
rule in the whole group.
"Aside from the fact that the general
RÂ°ntlment of the country seems to be
apainst returning any of the islands !
to Spain, the United States is under ob
ligations to the insurgents to establish
a stable and enlightened form of gov
ernrr,r>nt throughout the entire archi

pelago. When the war broke out the
I Philippine Islands insurgents became
in a certain sense the allies of the
Americans, and it is, therefore, our
moral duty to see to it that in the fu
ture they will be assured safe and civil
ized rule, and until the United States
determines in just what manner the
Philippines ultimately shall be gov
erned, we necessarily will have to con
sider the Philippine? our wards.
"During this transitional period, the
United States will be called upon to ex
ercise a primitive or rather arbitrary
form of control over the islands and
continue it until Congres finally
evolves a system of government, In
other words, it seems to me we will
have to maintain a temporary protec
torate over the archipelago, and this
will be accomplished by means of the
army and navy now in the Philippines
and Philippine waters. What will be
the ultimate fate of the islands is of
course, a problem cf the future. Wheth
er the Philippines will become an inde
pendent nation or a colony of the
United States or whether a long-time
American protectorate will be estab
lished will be a subject for Congress to
decide.
"It is well understood that Spain
must abide by the verdict of our peace
commissioners, whatever they may
prove to be, for she is in no fit condition
to renew the conflict which has result
ed so disastrously to her. She has no
reason to expect that our commlssion
era will agree to any proposition which
contemplates the continuation of Span
ish control over any part or all of the
groups. I feel confident that we â will
have no further trouble in an armed
way with Spain. The only obstacle
with which we may have to contend is
the opposition of the insurgents to our
plans. It is not at all certain, of
course, that we will encounter any such
obstacles, though it is assuredly among
the probabilities. However, from "what
I have read of the mission of Agon
cillo, the personal representative of
Aguinaldo, the insurgent chieftain, we
may find the Filipinos tractable and
willing to accept whatever form of gov
ernment we will finally decide upon, so
long as Spain will have no hand in Its
administration."
Regarding tho reports which come
from Paris thnt o opn p of Spain's proposi
tions to our commissioners will be that
the United States pay her $400,000,000
for the relinquishment of the Philip
pines, Senator Hanna said, signifi
cantly:
"We are not paying morey for or
buying territory which we now con
trol."

THE PHILIPPINES
Special dispatch to The Call and the New York

MADRID, Sept. 30. â Senor Montero
Rlos telegraphed to-day to Senor Sa
gasta, saying that he had received a
most satisfactory impression from the
attitude, of the American Peace Com
missioners. .
The Nacional to-day strikes a note
which reflects the sentiment of the
most serious men here. It boldly advo
cates Spain's giving up the Philippines.
This attitude now is taken by many of
the leading papers throughout the
country. At the same time the Govern
ment holds Â£000 men ready to send to
the Philippines.
The Minister of State to-day lament
ed-before the Queen the fact that cer
tain papers were in favor of the cession
of the Philippines. The Minister of
State considers that Spain should
maintain her sovereignty over the en
tire Archipelago, and in such spirit. the
Spanish delegates at the conference are
inspired. .

WARSHIPS HELD RHADY
FOR A DEMONSTRATION
NEW YORK, Sept. 30.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: The
Secretary of the Navy has directed that
all of the warships now in service be
retained in commission. The adminis

PLANS OF SPAIN FOR
EVACUATING CUBA
Special cable to The Call and the Net? York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett.
HAVANA, Sept. 30.â At a meeting of
the Spanish Commission last nieht it
was decided to send to-morrow a reply
to the note of evacuation. After much
discussion the Spanish Commission de
cided not to name a date, as they were
expected to do. but insist on the dates
of the beginning and evacuation of
Cuba as contained in the first reply to
the American demands. In explaining
the change of plan, a member of the
Spanish Commission said to me to-day:
"A joint session of the commission is
now necessary and will bo held within
a few days. We can then explain io
the Americans all the difficulties of
sending the entire army in Cuba back
to Spain. We think we can prove to
them that it is far better to name a
sufficient time in which we are abso
lutely certain we can perform our con
tract and complete evacuation than to
accept a shorter and earlier period at
the end of which it might seem that we
had not fulfilled our offer."

Kid McCoy's Version of
the " Divvy."
BLAMES THE CALIFORNIAN
DECLARES THE EX-CHAMPION
INSISTED ON DIVISION.
After All the Fuss and Talk There Is
Yet a Prospect of a Fight
Between the Twer""
Heavyweights.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 30.â There were a
few more developments to-day in the
controversy between James J. Corbett
and "Kid" McCoy relative to the divis
ion of the purse money offered by the
Hawthorne Athletic Club of Buffalo
for a glove contest.
It was McCoy's day for statement
making, and he and his manager,
William B. Gm- availed themselves of
the opportunity. In reply to Corbett's
charge, Gray said that Corbett was the
person who had insisted upon the purse
money being divided, and had he
(Gray) not agreed to a division, Cor
bett would have refused to sign the
articles. Gray followed up the state
ment by going before a notary public
and swearing to its truthfulness.
When George Considine, manager for
Corbett, was told of the contents of
Gray's statement on behalf of McCoy,
he smiled and said: "They have a lot
of nerve, and Gray's statement is false
In every particular."
"Corbett," he continued, "is wiling to
fight McCoy. He admits receiving $2000
advance money from the Hawthorne
Athletic Club, and is willing to keep
faith with that organization. He will
be at the plnce appointed by the club
on October 15. He will only agree to
box McCoy on condition that the win
ner t'lkes all the purse money of $20,000,
and that no pictures of the fight are
taken. He will sicrn new articles to this
effect at once."
When informed of Consldine's state-
ment. Gray said that new articles were
not necessary. Considine could destroy
the secret agreement and the public
agreement could govern the fight. In
dications, therefore, are that a battle
between the heavy weights may take
place after all.
MANAGER WILSON
VERY CONFIDENT
BUFFALO, Sept. 30.â Manager C.
Wilson of the Hawthorne Athletic Club
in an, interview with the News to-day
detailed a conversation which he had
with W. B. Gray, McCoy's manager,
by telephone, yesterday, in which the
latter said: "I will sign no agree
ments until I see you, which will be
some time between now and Monday;
but I can pull off the Corbett-McCoy
match in New York State outside of
Erie County on October 15. I will not
say over -wire where, but will tell you
when I get to Buffalo. The people I
have been talking with are dead anx
ious to hnve the ftÂ«;ht ?nd guarantee
that there will be no interference."
Mr. Wilson said the stories to the ef
fect that thp fight would take place in
Plttsburgr were all nonsense.
The News predicts that, Che^ktow
aga, being- barred, the McCoy fight will
take place under the auspices of the
Hawthorne Club in Syracuse. This pre
diction, the News says. Is based on
more than idle speculation or rumor.

CITY OF COLUMBIA
Aq iQitial Voyage, in Wtych Sol
Berliner Had His S^ull
Fractured.
Arrests Made by thje Captain, Followed by Suits
for False Imprisonment and the Tying
Up of the Stearoer.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, Sept. 23.â The steam- i
ship City of Columbia, which arrived !
here September 10 from Seattle, is in ,
the hands of the Marshal and tied uv i
under four libels aggregating $24,936.
Criminal proceedings were also brought
against its master, Walter S. Milnor, !
for assault and battery and false im- i
prisonment, and after the testimony j
was all in, Deputy Attorney-General !
Dole asked that the proceedings be !
nolle prossed. which was done.
Then followed the libels, in which the
plaintiffs were allowed to prosecute
without filing a bond, and the
ship refused the privilege of going a
bottomry bond, in order that the vessel
might proceed to its home port.
The admiralty suits were the result
of a fight on board the steamshiD.
which occurred on Sunday evening,
September 4. Solomon Berliner of San
Francisco, a member of the Rosa
America Comedy company, which was
en route to the islands, had hi 3 skull
fractured and received several scalD
wounds. He and B. H. Colgrove of
Washington, D. C, had quarreled,
clinched and fell on the hurricane deck.
Whether Berliner received his injuries
by falling on a cleat or was struck on
the head with an iron belaying pin by
Colgrove will always remain a mystery.
Berliner's condition was considered ser
ious for twenty-four hours, and Cap
tain Milnor placed Colgrove under ar
rest. His brother, Russell Colgrove,
former associate manaerer of the steam
ship company, Mrs. Solomon Berliner
anJ daughter, Rosa, were also put in
irons as being accessories to the crime.
The Colgroves spent the night in the
forecastle, and the women were locked
in a second-class state room under a
guard.
At Hilo the matter was reported to
the United States Consular agent, whr
held an investigation and discharged
the prisoners.
Russell Colgrove was the first to seek
redress at Honolulu. He libeled the
ship for $15,000 for false imprisonment,
and his suit is now being tried. Rosa
Berliner, who has frequently appeared
on the vaudeville stage in San Fran
cisco, and is extensively advertised here
as "The California Magnet," claims
$5000 damages for being assaulted and
maliciously imprisoned. B. H. Col
grove, who was recently deposed as the
agent for the company at Honolulu,
demands $2000 for breach of contract,
and Harvey Johnston, lessee of the bar.
wants $2936 for losses he sustained
for having his place of business closed
during the voyage and In port.
Although the vessel has been here ten
days overtime, but two witnesses have
been heard In the first suit. The pas
sengers are being detained against their
will, and have made a demand upon the
company that the^ be sent to San
Francisco on the first outgoing vessel.
The Columbia has no funds and can do
nothing for them. The United States
Cojisul was also appealed to In vain.
The City of Columbia is en its initial
trip to Honolulu, the object being to es
tablish, if possible, commercial rela
tions between Puget Sound and the Ha
waiian Islands, but the* proposed new
line has met with no encouragement
whatever at this port. In fact Hono
lulu and San Francisco interests are
so closely allied that the business men
from Washington State who are here so
lichinsr trade have failed to receive an
order in which the proviso is not made
that all foods must be shipped via San
Francisco. The return cargo <from here
on the Columbia will not amount to
anything. This, too, in the face of the
fact that an exceptionally low rate has
been offered, and also that a transcon
tinental railroad will carry freight from
Seattle to the East cheaper than it can
be shipped over the Southern Pacific
road.
ASSEMBLY" NOMINATION
NO ONE WILL ACCEPT
Seventieth District Fusionists Have a
Gold Brick They Wish to
Dispose Of.
LOS ANGELES. Sept. 30.â There is a
vacancy on the Union county ticket in
the Seventieth Assembly District, and
the fusionists can find no one to accept
the nomination. A fusion nomination in
that district is really a gold brick, given
to whoever will take it, for he stands not
tne remotest chance of election. The
district commences up in Antelope Val
ley and runs through down to the ocean,
taking in Santa Monica and the Soldiers'
Homo. The Republican nominee in this
district two years ago was W. S. Melick.
and he has been renominated. Two years
ago he received 3821 votes, while' only
2634 votes were cast by the opposition.
Melick got 831 votes at the Soldiers'
Home, while his opponent received but
-4 J.
This year in the fusion combination the
Silver Republicans were given the Sev
entieth District, as it was impossible for
any one but a straight Republican to
carry it. But the Silver Republicans im
apined thejÂ» were doing a remarkably
brilliant thing by nominating Colonel
Moses Wiley, one of the inmates of the
home. The nomination came to Colonel
Wiley unbidden and unasked, but when
the colonel found it out he was furious.
He wanted to thrash the man who placed
him in nomination. This being impossi
ble, he took vengeance by filing a written
protest and withdrawing from the ticket.
For over a week now the fusionists have
been casting about for a candidate, but
they have not been able to find one. The
chances are that Melick, the Republican
nominee, will have a lone field.
KNOCKOUT BLOW TO

ing the Hawthorne race track, against

CHARACTER
Speculation as to Kind
of Government.
VAIN HOPES OF HAWAIIANS
THEY CONTINUE TO LOOK FOB
INDEPENDENCE.
By a Peculiar Way of Reasoning
Some Natives Expect to Yet
Have Annexation Plans
Changed.
BY HORACE WRIGHT.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, Sept. 23.â The Hawaiian
Commission has completed its labors
in Hawaii and the members from the
mainland are booked to leave for their
homes by the steamship Gaelic to-day.
It is probable that Associate Justice
Frear will join his colleagues in Wash
ington in November, and possibly
President Dole may accompany him,
but at present writing this point If un
decided.
The commission has very wisely pre
vented any leakage of the character of
its report and has determined to prac
tically prepare it in Washington. The
Impression, however, which appears to
most prominently prevail among
thoughtful and conservative men, who
value more the best interests of both
countries than political preferment, is
that Hawaii will for some few years be
allotted a territorial form of govern
ment of a probationary character,
somewhat akin to that granted to
Louisiana. In support of this view
sympathy is accorded to the commis
sion in its labors, the numerous and
contradictory memorials presented to
the commission are direct evidence that
if left to ourselves we are not prepared
to select a form of government that will
be satisfactory to the several conflict
ing interests and political parties, and
further, that the best interests of the
United States and probably also of Ha
waii, will be conserved by, temporarily
at least, preventing a renewal of po
litical antagonisms and giving the land
rest until such time as our people as a
-whole thoroughly appreciate the fact
that we are no longer an independent
sovereignty, but an integral part of the
United States.
Even the annexatlonists claim that
they did not surrender the country with
the intention of maintaining in power
the Dole-Judd faction and they claim
"a new deal"; the planters and the
commercial interests require protection
not in consonance with the wishes of
the mainland, while the Hawaiians are
bo divided under their reckless and
foolish leaders that it is difficult to say
what would satisfy the majority except
the general principles of American
rights of equality and the franchise.
Even the shrewd women of Hawaii,
while recognizing the political change,
still hanker after restoration of the
monarchy, assisting a large number of
the men in their openly expressed pro
tests against annexation and in favor
of restoration. It is useless to disguise
the fact, but for some time to come no
kindly and forcible advice from Sena
tors Cullom and Morgan or Mr. Hltt
or from those white residents who have
been their warmest friends for years
and have fought with them side by side
against annexation can convince a very
large number, perhaps a majority, of
the native Hawaiians that annexation
is permanent. They insist upon believ
ing (from reliable information) that a
Democratic or Populist President will
next reign at the White House and that
then Congress and the President will
review the ex-Queen's protest and the
annexation proceedings and restore
Liliuokalani to the throne under an
American protectorate. It is no won
der, then, that cautious men are not
anxious to bestow the electoial fran
chise too liberaHy until an equipoise
can be obtained and they prefer to sac
rifice their accustomed privileges of
control until times are more settled and
political animosities less bitter.
But on the other hand there are but
few who wish to see this promising
little commonwealth purely a rich
man's paradise and politically con
trolled for their especial benefit. The
predilection, -which is growing in
Btrength, in favor of the principal Fed
eral officers being appointed from the
mainland is not because we have noi
men of equal brain power and executive
ability to thosetfwho might be thenct
selected, but because for years past the
governing influence has been really
drawn from one section or faction of
the community and we want a change.
It may be admitted that there are a
few strong men, in the Annexation
party and in the National Republic
ranks who are opposed to the Dole-
Judd faction, but it is doubtful whether
their influence is sufficiently strong to
"catch the speaker's eye" at Washing,
ton and whether, if appointed, they
would' enjoy our confidence.
As another illustration consider the
Internecine warfare in the Republican-
Annexation ranks in their respective
crgans between the Sewall and Dole
factions. The Sewallltes are roundly

abusing the President and his Cabinet
for not placing before the Hawaiian
Commission the views entertained by
the Government on behalf of the coun
try as to our future form of govern
ment. How can they do so? Mr. Dole
cannot be one moment chief executive
of the Hawaiian Cabinet and the next
Mr. McKinley's commissioner, and
furthermore who and what Influence
do the Cabinet represent? Until an
nexation was accomplished they had a
political following, but that has gone
over almost bodily into the Sewall
camp. They cannot openly advocate
the plans suggested by either the plant
ers or the Chamber of Commerce for
that would create disruption, and they
cannot advocate a people's policy for
there is none. They are wise to be
reticent and to content themselves with
furnishing the commission with sta
tistical information from their bureau
and present their views as indi
viduals and not as rulers. This na
turally places considerable power in
the hands of Dole and Frear, but for
tunately they both bear the character
of being trustful for the future inter
ests of the country rather than anxious
for personal preferment.
The labor problem is engaging the
serious study of all and It is felt that
some concessions must be made for a
year or two to our sugar, rice and cof
fee industries. It is estimated that at
least 10,000 more Asiatics will be re
quired to carry on these industries un
til a different class of labor can be im
ported on the share system. The Chi
nese whose three-year contracts have
expired are gradually being taken on as
day laborers at the improved rate of
$16 a month, and the planters are doing
their best to improve the condition of
their laborers xind preventing ill-treat
ment. The Japanese on the other is
lands have commenced suits to test the
constitutionality of the labor contract
laws and desertions to the coffee lands
are increasing .i numbers.
STEAMER SENATOR
WEATHERS A TYPHOON
While Returning From Manila the
Troop Transport Puts Into
Honolulu.
HONOLULU, Sept. 24.â The Senator,
which was one of the troopships of the
tirst expedition, sailed from Manila Au
gust 24. and arrived off this port on the
ISth inst. She returned without stopping
at Nagasaki because she carried coal
enough for the trip. She put in here be
cause the coal was in her hold and could
not be advantageously transferred to her
bunkers at sea. ShÂ« will remain here long
enough to shift her coal, and perhaps take
on some more as ballast, give her.machin
ery an overhauling and clean her boilers,
which have become very dirty. While in
the China Sea she encountered a typhoon,
probably the one that overtook the Zea
landia, "and lay to for thirty-two hours
She had most of the railing and every
thing movable on her forward deck torn
away, but suffered but little serious dam-
age.
The Senator brings a number of non
commissioned officers and privates from
the Eighteenth and Twenty-third Infan
try and the Third Artillery, whose term
of enlistment had expired, though none
of them left the ranks until after the cap
ture of Manila.
The military funeral of Private Waiter
Johnson of Battery A, First Battalion
Heavy Artillery, California Volunteers,
took place on the 18th Inst. The unfortu
nate soldier died of ty"noid fever at the
I'nited States Hospital on the day pre
vious. The services were conducted by
the army chaplain from St. Andrew's
Cathedral.
There are 400 men sick at Catnp McKin
ley and Camp Otis. Honolulu. They are
not ill enough to be sent to the hospital .
but are suffering from a sort of epidemic,
due, it is thought, to the water.
The percentage of officers and men will

United States troops for garrison service
here is so very small that the Idea has
been given up. Both General Merriam
and General King are in favor of keeping
up the present National Guard organiza
tion. ___________^__

THE SAN FRAKCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, pfaTOBER 1, 1898.
HAWAIIANS
COMPLAIN OF
UNFAIRNESS
Not Given the Desired
Hearing.
ONE MEMORIAL REFUSED
IT APPEALED POINTEDLY TO
THE UNITED STATES.
Asked That Before Annexation Was
Carried Out the Natives Be
Consulted by a
Plebiscite.
To the Editor of the San Francisco
CaJl: The Hawaiian United States Com
missioners have finished their part of the
work here, and to-day they are preparing
to leave us for Washington, D. C, by the
steamer Gaelic, via San Francisco. They
have hardly been here two months. Dur
ing all this time they worked behind
closed doors, and nobody knows yet what
form of government they have decided for
us. But they say it was all "cut and
dried" in Washington before they came
here.
Senator Cullom and Representative Hitt
were deceived by their Hawaiian col
leagues when tnuy iirst came here. They
were told then that during the Hying of
the stars and stripes all the Hawaiians
would submit and come in and ask to be
come United States citizens and abandon
the idea of standing firm for their coun
try. With this idea they all went to the
islands of Maui and Hawaii and delivered
speeches Derore the Hawaiians, stating
tnut the United States liag should wave
over the Hawaiian Islands forever. All
the Hawaiians listened to thorn wherever
they went, but answered nothing. The
Hawaiians in the meantime called a
meeting and elected delegates in ail parts
of the islands and sent them to Honolulu
to meet the Commissioners. They gave
their answers in memorial form, which
surprised the Commissioners. The an
swers are united on one most important
pointâ the restoration of the independ
ence of their beloved country. The only
Hawaiian organization which complied
with the wish of the Commissioners was a
new association, composed mostly of Gov
ernment officials and a few lawyers. The
KaUtiaina and Aloha Aina societies are
for the restoration of monarchy. They
claimed that United States Minister Stev
ens, with the aid of naval forces, the
cruiser Boston, overthrew the monarchy
on January 17, 1h93, and placed the Dole
oligarchy in power. This important fact
is undisputed.
At last come the Hui Kaulana o Leant
with a memorial protesting against the
annexation of Hawaii to the United
States and asking that a plebiscite be
taken by the United States to decide the
fate of Hawaii. But the Commissioners
refused to receive or listen to the desire
of this society. This is a gross blunder
on the part of the Commissioners, as this
society is composed of the flower of the
Hawaiian people, and most of them are
those who participated in the revolution
of January, lS9fÂ», against the Dole oli
garchy and to restore the true Hawaiian
Government. And they are the favorites
of the Hawaiians.
The following is the memorial which
the Commissioners refused to receive
from the Kaulana o Leahi:
MEMORIAL.
To the President, the Congress and the People
of the United States of America:
W>. an organization formed under the tltl*
of "Hul Kaulana o l^eahl," by those who par
ticipated in the revolution of January 6 ana
7, A. D. 1895, whose object was to restore tht.
Independence of our country, do hereby re
spectfully submit the following rnemorta.
through your commissioners. Senator K. M.
Cullom, chairman; Senator John T. Morgan,
Representative Robert R. Hitt, Hon. S. H. Dole
and Judge WÂ« B. Frear, to be embodied In yuur
report:
Whereas, The legal and constitutional Na
tlonal Government of Hawaii was, on the 17th
day of January, A. D. 1893, overthrown by a
handful of foreign conspirators, started, aided
and abetted by the United States Mlnlstei
Resident Stewns, under the direct and un
lawful protection of the I'nited States naval
forces, landed from the United States warship
Boston;
Whoreas. the said overthrow of the Hawaiian
Government would never have taken place
without this criminal armed pressure of this
same Minister Stevens;
Whereas, Our constitutional sovereign only
cded to the force of the United States war
ship, under protest, and resigned, not Into the
hands of the conspirators, but unto tht- United
States Government, on whose equity she fully
relied, and to whose honesty she appealed for
redress;
Whereas, The so-called Hawaiian Republic,
which succeeded, wan merely an oligarchy of
usurpers, which hus never been legalized by
any appeal to the people at large, but, on the
contrary, relied solely for Its support on paid
foreign mercenary soldiers and on the sham
and mockery of a parliament elected by a
fraction only, a minority of 2000 electors, care
fully chosen out of the total of 16,000 men le
gally registered and entitled to civil rights
anil to the eiereise of the political vote, who
wer,? brutally and unjustly debarred of their
rights acquired after more than fifty years of
pca r eful exercise;
Whereas, The Hawaiian Republic never rep
resented the real Hawaiian population, and has
never been recognized by them nor empowered
to art or negotiate in their name and behaJf;
Whereas, The treaty of annexation submitted
to the United States- Government by the
usurpers, who owe their position and power to
Minister Stevens' crime, does not emanate
from the Hawaiian people and was never sub
mitted to thotr approval through their legal
voters or their duly elected representatives, but
was passed upon merely by a mercenary Par
liament elected by the afore mentioned minor
ity of arbitrarily chosen voters, nearly all for
eigners;
whereas, The Hawaiian people hnve no wish
or de-Hire for annexation to the United States
of America, but do prefer the Independence of
their beloved country, under their own legal
and constitutional government, chosen by tho
rule of the ballot and by the majority of all
the men entitled to vote;
Whereas. The United States Congress has
been deceived by the misrepresentations and
Illegal assumptions of the self-chosen rulers of
the said misnamed Hawaiian Republic;
Whereas. The constitution and laws of the
United States Republic are Justly "for the
People, by the people," whereby the unnexa
tlon of this country of Hawaii ought to be
made for the people through the people and by
the people, and not In the Interest and at the
demand of a class or clique, and ought to be
submitted to and approved by the whole of the
Hawaiian population;
Whereas, The said annexation under the
Newlands Joint resolution has been made la
violation of the constitutions of both countries
(United States and Hawaiian Republic);
Therefore, We, lepal citizens and duly quail
fled voters of Hawaii, In meeting assembled,
on the 19th day of September, A." D. I.'*:
Firstâ Do hereby protest against annexation
to the United States as now obtained under
false pretenses through the Newlands Joint
resolution, because this annexation constltutad
only an act of oppression and piracy, commit
ted unwittingly by a great and powerful na
tion over a. weak and defenseless one, and is
equivalent to receiving stolen goods, whereby
an everlasting stain will be thrown on the
glory and honor of America.
Hccond- i -We emphatically appeal to the
United States Congress and to the United
StatPi people at large, for redress against this
unjust annexation; we appenl for equity; we
appeal as a helpless and friendly nation to the
honor, the Justice, the magnanimity and friend
ship of the Congress and people of the United
Htates of America, and ask that, before this
annexation is definitely consummated, we, all
men with civil rights, be consulted by ple
biscite; and in the event of this being for the
negative, that we be allowed to select our own
legal national constitutional government, under
the magnanimous protection of the United
States. Respectfully yours,
JOHN L. LANS,
ROBERT W. WILCOX.

Honolulu. Hawaiian Islands, Sept. 20, IS9B.
The people of the United States ought
to console the Hawailans, who are their
friends, by ordering Congress to repeal
the Ncwlands joint resolution and restore
the independence of the Hawaiian Islands,
according to the method set forth by the
above memorial. Thus the United States
will relieve itself from a grave responsi
bility. The United States only needs here
a coaling station, which can be easily ob
tained from the Hawailans themselves by
a treaty. The selection may be left to the
United States to choose any part she
wants on any island. Pearl Harbor may
be put In the treaty and place United
States jurisdiction over it at once, and
that will settle the only need of tne
United States here.
All the European powers, also Japan,
are willing to Join with the United States
to guarantee Hawaii to be a neutral state
as generally understood. Yours truly.
R. W. WILCOX.

IN PURSUIT OF
WIFE AND MONEY
Van Alstine Following
His Fickle Spouse.
RACING ACROSS THE ATLANTIC
BUT THE FLEEING WOMAN HAS
THREE DAYS' STAR'i.
Romance of the Klondike in Which
an Honest Yukon Miner Has
Been Cleverly
Duped.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 30.â The mystery
surrounding the disappearance of Mrs.
Charles Van Alstlne, the "bride of the
Klondike," who walked out of St.
Mark's Hospital with $48,100 belonging
to her husband, as was telegraphed to
The Call, has been solved. Mrs. Van
Alstine is a passenger, under an as
sumed name, on the White Star line
steamer Majestic, which is due to ar
rive at Liverpool to-morrow.
Plowing the ocean only three days
behind the Majestic is the steamer
Umbria of the Cunard line and which is
due to arrive two days later than the
White Star ship. Pacing the deck of
the Umbria is a tall, weather-beaten
miner, who made Mrs. Van Alstine his
wife three months ago and trusted her
with the proceeds of his labors in the
gold fields of the Klondike. He met his
bride while he was traveling down the
Yukon Kiver on his way to San Fran
cisco, where he proposed to invest
34f>,G00, the proceeds of his interest in
a valuable claim in the Klondike.
Mrs. Van Alstine told him she was
from San Francisco and had been to
the gold fields to look over the ground
to see whether her money, of which
she had a little, could not be profitably
invested there. The courtship was
very brief, and before the steamer
reached her destination Van Alstine
had taken her as his wife. When he
had changed his nuggets into drafts he
had them made out in his wife's name.
From Srn Francisco the couple came to
this city, where, as told in The Call,
they obtained apartments in the Hoff
man House and devoted their time to
eninving- their honeymoon.
Then Mrs. Van Alstine fell 111. Now
her husband says that this was only a
subterfuge to get away from him and
complete her plans, and she insisted
upon going to the hospital. She was
placed in St. Mark's Hospital, as a pri
vate patient, but r Mned there only
one night, leaving alone on the follow
ing morning. Van Alstine had a stern,
determined look on his face when he
stood on the deck of the IJmbria last
Saturday. He expressed himself as
thoroughly satisfied that he had been
the victim of a scheme concocted by a
clever woman for the purpose of get
ting possession of his money, and
stated that he believed there
others In the game with her.

READY TO FIX
ON THE FATE
OF HAWAII
Commissioners Home
From the Islands.
NO WORD OF FUTURE PLANS
WILL PROBABLY BE MADE A
TERRITORY.
Another Session Will Be Held,
and Then the Bill
Will Go to
Congress.
The Hawaiian Commission, or those
members who were appointed from
this country, arrived from the Islands
on the Gaelic yesterday morning. The
commission has completed its work at
Honolulu and it has d*"W to prepare a
form of government for the islands
that will fit the needs of the people
and the situation of the country.
Senator Shelby M. Cullorn, chairman
of the commission, Senator John T.
Morgan and Congressman Robert R.
Hltt formed the delegation which ar
rived yesterday. They will proceed to
Washington with as little delay as pos
sible, and there they will be joined by
Judge Frear of the Hawaiian Supreme
Court and probably by President Dole,
the two island members, and a confer
ence will be held. It is hoped to be
able to submit a bill to Congress as
soon as it opens, and for that reason
the commissioners are losing no time
In their work.
Of what they have seen and heard
the commissioners are not averse to
talking, but about what plans they
have discussed for the future govern
ment of the islands they remain dis
creetly silent. They are in favor of a
Territorial form of government; but
there are many details which must be
provided for to suit the conditions ex
isting, and it is these which are most
interesting and these that the commis
sioners will not discuss.
"We have done a great deal of work
in the short time "c were in the is
lands," said Senator Cullom yester
day, "but when we got there we found
that the two island commissioners had
arranged for everything and they were
so familiar with every phase of the
question and with the conditions exist
ing at the islands that the work went
along rapidly. We n-ere anxious to
get through and sometimes sat all the
evening after being in session all day.
We hope to have our report ready to
present to Congress as soon as it meets
in December next, and we have no
time to lose.
"We visited all the Islands of the
group and made ourselves thoroughly
familiar with the whole situation. We
received the most courteous treatment
from every one, and so we managed
to do all that was necessary in the
month we stayed there. The natives
do not yet realize that annexation is
a permanent thing. They expect that
with the changing of the administra
tion the flag will be pulled down again
and the old order of things will rule
once more. They say it was so onee â
when the flag was first raised over the
islands, and they are living in the hope
that the same thing will happen again.
"The island Government Is running
smoothly just now, and it will do very
well until Congress shall have enacted
new laws to fit the conditions of the
islands. We will have to consider a
great many things, and there will have
to be many special statutes. As a
Territory, Congress can enact such
laws for the new possession as it
wishes; it has not the right of self
government that belongs to a State,
and so we may make such local laws
as we please and as the situation de
mands."
The commissioners found the labor
question as grave a one as any, but
they do not seem to think there is
much danger to the laboring classes
here from the competition of the coolies
of the islands. The Chinese the com
missioners found second to the Japan
ese question, but In either case they
say the laws of the United States will
keep coolie and contract labor out of
the Islands, and so it cannot harm this
country. As to the Chinese and Ja
panese already there on contract, Con
gressman Hltt says they must all go
home as soon as their contracts ex
pire.
"It is part of the contract," said Mr.
Hitt, "that they leave the country as
soon as their contract expires unless
they make another contract. They
must deposit money with the Govern
ment to take them back, too, and the
law can easily be enforced. If they
are under contract they cannot leave
their work on the islands, and if they
must go back to China when their con
tract expires I do not see how they can
get to this country. They are trying
now to restrict the immigration of Ja
panese by rigidly enforcing the pauper
law. Every Japanese must have at
least $50 to show when he comes to
land. Recently there were 700 shipped
back to Japan, not because they had
not the $50, but because it was found
that each man had been given the
necessary amount to show the officials
of the Government."
The sentiment at the islands was di
vided on the subject of shipping laws
and so a good part of the time of the
commission was spent in investigating
that phase of the situation. The is
landers think less of the shipping In
terests than they do here, however, for
already the commissioners have re
ceived from the Chamber of Commerce
of this city a petition asking that Ha
waii be brought under the shipping
laws of the United States. The peti
tion was presented tot Senator Cul
lom yesterday.
It is expected thar there will be a
long and heated discussion over the
question when it finally comes up be
fore Congress, for the creating of new
governments is something Congress is
not used to, and there are so many
points to furnish food for debate.
"But it is not as if it were a strange
people," said Congressman Hitt.
"These people are Americans and their
Government Is modeled after ours and
their desire is to Join the Union of
States. It will be much harder when
it comes to governing other territory
recently acquired." a

WATCHES THE FIRST GAME OF
THE SEASON.
Finds Good Material Among the
Varsity Men â First Washington
Volunteers Are Not

Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Sept. 30.
â Coach Cross arrived to-day on the
noon train. He was accompanied from
San Francisco by Captain Fisher, Man
ager Prichard and Acting Treasurer
Berry and was met at the station by
a large crowd of enthusiastic students
who escorted him to the campus. Cross 1
reception was no less hearty from the
members of the faculty, with whom he
is very popular.
Coach Cross went to work at once,
appearing on the field for the game be
tween the Washington Volunteers and
the Stanford men. He watched the
game closely and coached the men in
their play. In speaking of the game he
said that there was lots of good ma
terial on hand from which to work up
a good team. He will first begin to de
velop the line men.
Harry P. Cross was graduated from
Yale with the class of '96. While in
college he played first as guard on
Yale's second eleven against Hickok
and McCrea, and later as center against
Stlllman. When Stillman was gradu
ated Cross stepped Into his place on the
Yale 'varsity of '95, which was victori
ous over Princeton by a score of 20â10.
Mr. Cross was born in Wakefield,
Rhode Island. He received his prepar
atory school education at St. Pauls,

cruise day before yesterday fire was dis
covered in one of ncr coal bunkers when

in different parts of the vessel to indicate
and signal when an undue temperature
exists anywhere.
After the arrival of the flag-ship In port
the bunker in which the fire broKe out
was entirely emptlod and thoroughly
cleaned. An examination of all the coal
bunkers and every part of the ship baa
been made. â _
The fire was discovered so promptly and
made so little headway that only about
a ton of coal was burned. No cause for
the fire Is known, but it is supposed to
have been from spontaneous combustion.

Attendance at the Park Also a Great
Improvement Over Preceding
Days of the

Social Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 20.â attend
ance at the park to-day was an improve
ment over the preceding days of the week
and the sport, for the most part, clean
and healthy looking:. Marplot ran a very
catchy mile, and Fig Leaf, P F, Gold Fin
and Manzanllla, all pronounced favorites
In the betting, had their numbers hung
out. Thorpe was seen in the saddle out
twice, and on both occasions was success
ful.
After one or two stormy trips in the
past. "Curly" Shields' mare, Fig Leaf,
finally landed a purse. She was a 9 to 5
favorite for the opening, a six and a half
furlong run, decided under selling condi
tions, and, with Eddio Ames up, won driv
ing, a length before Rose Maid. The lat
ter was away from the post badly or the
result would have been reversed. Saucy
Eyes was a comfortable tnird.
P F was started again to-day, and, fall
ing in with some easy company, was a
prohibitive choice for tEe six-furlong
sprint that followed. Kaiser Ludwigr, pet
ting away in front, set a fast pace, and
at the wire was beaten but a length by
the favorite which scored with little to
spare. The roan horse Pat Murphy, after
many vicissitudes, got trie show from
The' mile selling event saw Marplot,
with 95 pounds up, go to the post a 4 to o
favorite over Moringa an.! Hey del
Tierra. The former at first enjoyed hrst
call in the betting, but tn. Marplot coin
was out in full array, and His odds drifted
to 9 to 6. It was the prettiest contest of
the meeting. Houck quicÃly assumed the
lead with Marplot, with the other two
starters as close company. At the end
the favorite drew away, winning by a
couple of lengths in 1:41%. In a. nerce
drive for the place Devin, on Moringa,
got the decision by a head.

and finally succumbed by a length in a
driving finish. Gilt Edge strolled in from
the rear, securing show honors. The
others were a bad lot.
It was only by dint of hard riding that
Thorpe got Manzanilla, the 8 to 5 favor

Clate. After leading into fhe stretch the
lack mare tired badly, and at the wire
was but half a length in iront of Dolore,

DEMOCRATIC EX-MAYORS
WHO WILL VOTE FOR GAGE
Straw Showing the Estimation in Which the
Republican Standard-Bearer Is
Held at Home.
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 30.â Two of the ex-Mayors of Los Angeles,
both Democrats of the old school, have come forth into the open and
declared their intention to suDDort Henry T. Gage for Governor. The
first of these is John Bryson. After the county and city of Los Ange
les had given Benjamin Harrison a majority of over 4000 in 1888.
John Bryson (Democrat) was elected Mayor .of the city by 1000 majority
Mr. Bryson has always supported the nominees of his party, gener
ally speaking, but this year he declares that thirty years' acquaint
ance with Henry T. Gage will compel him to disregard party ties and
vote for his friend. In the campaign of 1596 Mr. Bryson, who is one of
the wealthiest men in the city, was an ardent supporter of Bryan.
Thomas E. Rowan was from 1893 to 1895 Mayor of this city, elect
ed as a Democrat. He has resided in the city for over thirty years,
and has held the positions of Supervisor and Treasurer, and has al
ways been looked up to as a leader of the Democratic forces. Yet he
is openly out for Gage. In speaking of the matter he said:
"I have known Henry Gage ever since he came to the city from
the ranch. He was a green country boy then, and now he is one of
the foremost citizens of the State. I have always been his close
friend, and I tell you that he is as true as steel. He was never guilty
of a dishonorable act or deed, and he has as generous and a kind
heart as I ever knew any man to have. Vote for him for Governor?
Why, of course I will, and a right good Governor he will make if he
Is elected. I know of a number of Democrats here In Los Angeles
County and throughout Southern California who are going to vote
just as I intend my vote shall go in on the Bth of next November."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
HANFORD, Sept. 30.â James G. Ma
guire, fusion candidate for Governor,
and E. L. Hutchison, nominee for
Lieutenant Governor, addressed the
people this evening on the issues of the
campaign. They arrived from Visalia
this afternoon and were met at the
train by a committee of Democrats and
Populists and escorted to the Hotel Ar
! tt-sia, where an informal reception was
! held for several hours. The speaking
, was held in Hill's Hall and a large au
dience greeted the speakers.
Mr. Maguire spuke for two hours
and a half and was given the closest
attention by the audience, his remarks
being frequently interrupted by ap
plause. He began by referring to tne
present contest as one between the
masses and the classesâ the Republican
party standing for Hannaism and mo
! nopolies, while the fusion party stood
> for equal rights to all. He said that
â  the Republican ticket was put up by
the Southern Pacific Company, and that
the platform adopted was essentially
in favor of railroad domination in poil
i tics. He also cited as proof of his as
j sertions the positio-n of the Los Angeles
| Times and asserted that the ticket had
been named by The Call before any of
the names had been considered by the
convention. He said that Congressman
Barham, who had always been in fa
vor of refunding until the last session,
had been renominated by the Republi
cans, while Congressman Hilborn, who
was always opposed to refunding, had
been turned down and Loud had been
pardoned for not voting at all.
He then paid his respects to General
Barnes, saying that he was in the em
ploy of the Southern Pacific. He de
nied that the Democratic party placed
obstacles in the way of the conduct of
the war, claiming that it had attempted
to shift the burdens of the war to the
i rich rather than the poor. He said the
j war with Spain was not a Republican
' war, but an American war, fought out
! by men from all sections of the coun-
I try, but he thought the war had a chap-
I ter of shame, and that was the manner
' in which the authorities had conducted
it.
A telegram was read from Seth Mann,
chairman of the Democratic State Cen
tral Committee, informing Maguire
i that the Supreme Court had unani
| mously knocked out the middle-of-the-
I road Populists, which was received with
cheers.
The meeting was closed by a short
address by Mr. Hutchison, the fusion
candidate for Lieutenant Governor.
BURGLAIt SHOT NEAR REDDING.
Deliberate Act of a Farmer Whose
House Was Entered.
REDDING, Sept. 30.â About 7:30 o'clock
on Thursday morning Albert Thomas, a
farmer residing fifteen miles from this
city, shot, perhaps fatally, a man' who,
he claims, was a burglar. Thomas was
returning to his house after having start
ed for town, and seeing a man leaving the
house, deliberately shot him down, the
! bullet entering at the top of his hip just
left of the spinal column and passing out
! of the right groin. The wounded man was
left lying in the sun until 3 o'clock in the
afternoon.
When the officers were notified of the
! affair both men were placed under arrest.
The wounded man gives the name of Y\ .
Boughen. He will probably die. He
! claims that, being hungry, he entered the
1 house through an unlocked door to obtain
; something to eat. Finding nothing, he
was leaving when shot without warning
from behind by Thomas. Thomas says
his cabin has been burglarized several
times, and he was on the lookout for a
repetition of the offense.

was one of the liveliest and cleverest
which has taken place in this arena.
Toward the close of the fight the stiff
pace told on Leon, while the Philadel
phia man showed very little signs of
distress. In fact, the "Quaker" seemed
to grow stronger toward the conclusion
of the bout.
The referee satisfied the majority of
those who witnessed the contest when
he declared the bou# a draw, as neither
had gained a material advantage.
Johnny White of England was the
referee. Neither seemed to have suf
fered much up to the twenty-third
round. In the middle of the round the
fighting was very fast, and the crowd
cheered wildly as each landed some
very heavy blows, and at the ciose of
the round they were fighting fiercely.
Flanagan was the first to lead in the
twenty-fourth, landing a still right
hand punch on the body. He put in
four successive left facers without a
return. Leon fought back, but Flana
gan was much the stronger. Leon left
himself open and Flanagan swung his
right heavily on the chest. The pace
was very hot just then, considering the
distance they had gone. When they
shook hands for the last round it look
ed to be either man's fight. Flanagan
put in some stiff punches in this round,
while Leon sent a couple of hot rights
on the jaw. Leon tried to land his
right on the vital spot, but Flanagan
withstood every attack and met Leon's
every rush with pood rights in the
wind.

THE REPUBLICAN RALLY TO-NIGHT.
PREPARATIONS made for the Republican
mass meeting at Woodward's Pavilion this
evening are of a nature to warrant 1 the atten
dance not only of all Republicans, but of all classes
of citizens who desire to hear a thorough presenta
tion of the issues of the campaign.
Mr. Gage, the Republican candidate for Governor,
who will make the principal address of the evening,
lias just accomplished a triumphant canvass in the
southern counties, in the course of which he proved
himself to be one of the best campaigners in the his
tory of our politics. Although without previous ex
perience as a candidate for office, and although
matched against such an habitual campaigner m Ma
guire, he has shown himself easily superior to his
adversary. Maguire opened the canvass in the south
with a vicious aggressiveness, but already Mr. Gage
has forced him to the defensive, and about all that
Maguire is doing now is to go about complaining of
the attack on him.
Under any circumstances the public would take a
large interest in a man who has so brilliantly at
tained the front rank of campaign orators, but there
are other reasons than a desire to gratify intellectual
curiosity which will impel intelligent men to make
their way to the Pavilion early this evening to hear
and to see the Republican candidate.
Upon Mr. Gage is to rest the responsibility of
carrying out in the administration of State affairs the
pledges of the Republican party. A knowledge of his
character, therefore, is as important to the voter as
a knowledge of his ability as an orator, and to at
tain that knowledge the voters of the city should see
the man. Where he is best known he is most
highly esteemed. The voters of San Francisco who
hear and sre him to-night will understand his popu
larity in hi? horne â why it is that all Maguire's at
tack? upon him were futile, and why his short can
vass in the south has beÂ«n a moral as well as an in
tellectual triumph.
An added interest will be given to the meetincr by
the fact that it is to be presided over by the Repub
lican candidate for Lieutenant Governor, Jacob H.
Neff. All CsJifornians regard with more than or
dinary affection this old pioneer, whom they
familiarly call "Honest Jake NefT." Mr. Neff comes
nearer to being a citizen of the whole State than any
c'her man in it. No one ever thinks of him among
the prominent citizens of a particular locality. He
is identified with the entire commonwealth, and is at
home in the valleys or in the mountains, in the city
or in the forests.
Mr. NefT is not only to preside over the meeting,
but will speak. Senator Perkins will also be among
the oratbrs of the evening. The occasion will be one
of the most notable of the canvass, and perhaps the
; most interesting that will be held in San Francisco
during the campaign. The issues before the voters
are to be discussed on the highest plane of politics
by then who are not only eminent as orators, but
have leadership and official responsibility to give
authority to their words. It is safe to say the at
tendance will be large, and independent voters,
sound money Democrats, conservative citizens and
taxpayers of all parties will unite with Republicans in
giving a rousing welcome to our Senator and our
coming Governor and Lieutenant Governor.
NOTHING BUT FACTS WANTED.
THERE can be no excuse in this campaign, or
in any other, for indulging in misrepresentation.
In the heat of partisan debate even men who mean
to be fair may permit their prejudices to unduly color
their opinions and their expressions. Neither side is
apt to be wholly free from this fault. But to falsify
and distort is to confess the absence of ground for
argument.
These few remarks are provoked by the action of
the Examiner We cannot view its course with sur
prise, but are soiry it thinks necessary to bolster its
cnuse with a lie. We cite only a single one of these,
as space is not Htnitiess. That paper stated that
Irving M. Scott, having been approached with a
proposition to become the Republican candidate for
Mayor, replied that he would not accept, that he was
in favor of Phelan. Mr. Scott never said this, never
sajs anything like it. He is not in favor of Phelan.
He never said he was in favor of Phelan.
' As. the days go by occasion may arise for calling at
tention to similar lapses from the way of truth. We will
not enjoy the performance of the duty, and yet when
it shall arise, will not shrink.
It is not surprising that the downfall of the Chinese
Erdperor should be ascribed to his weakness for
European clothing. Perhaps in the lot he had some
of the rainbow neckties and sunset shirts which il
ium* the environment of the modern dude.

NON-PARTISAN EMBARRASSMENT.
DEACON FITCH'S Non-Partisans have been
placed in a very embarrassing position by the
excellent platform adopted and the strong can
didates nominated by the Republican convention.
Mr. Fitch is himself a Republican, and, like most men
who believe in fhe principles of that party, he prefers
Republicans to Democrats in olnce. That is to say,
all things being equal, Deacon Fitch would prefer,
from a non-partisan standpoint, to indorse good Re
publicans. As two-thirds of the members of the
Non-Partisan convention are Republicans, and as
four-fifths of the vote marshaled by the party on
election day is Republican, we may say that the sen
timent we have attributed to Mr. Fitch is shared
generally by his party.
The pledges adopted by the Republican convention
are the counterpart of those formulated in past years
by the Non-Partisans. Some of the Republican can
didates have long been recognized as the special fa
vorites of that party. In short, the Republican plat
form and the Republican ticket is all that the most
ardent Non-Partisan could desire, provided his feel
ings and sentiments are Republican. Even Deacon
Fitch, the most uncompromising of local civic re
tormers, cannot deny this.
We have said that the action of the Republican
convention has placed the Non-Partisans in an em
' barrassing position. This statement requires expla
! nation. For a long time Mayor Phelan has been
connubiating with Deacon Fitch's party with a view
to making it an addendum to his machine. The re
sult of his work is found in the fact that the Non-
Partisans did not await the action of any convention
as to Mayor, but renominated Phelan even before he
had been named by his own convention. In ether
words, the Non-Partisans declared that no man in
San Francisco was fit to be Mayor except Mr.
Phelan, and that as to him they would tolerate no
rivalry. They declined even to await the result of a
search by the Republicans.
The only thing necessary after this to establish the
fact that Mayor Phelan was doing business with the
Non-Partisans on a Democratic basis would have
been the prompt indorsement of all the other Demo
crats named by that gentleman for office. Why this
was not done does not appear. Probably the Re
publican Non-Partisans thought a delay would better
subserve their purpose. Undoubtedly Phelan con
sented to a postponement on the theory that the Re
publicans would adopt a bad platform and nominate
a weak or machine ticket. â  Had this been done the
contrast between Mayor Phelan's "honest" candidates
and those of the opposing party would have been
sufficiently striking to have justified the Non
ms in becoming a tail to the Mayor's kite.
F.ut Mr. Phelan doubtless now perceives his mis
take. The Republicans have completely demolished
his campaign of buncombe and flap-doodle. Their
platform is as good as his. and their candidates are
stronger and better. What will the Non-Partisans
now do? They cannot indorse Phelan's ticket
without losing their claim to the title of indepen
dents, and they cannot indorse the Republican ticket
without breaking faith with the Mayor. In short, the
Non-Partisans are in what is known in local politics
as a "hole." If the Phelan programme is carried out
not only will a split result in the convention, but the
cespect now entertained by the public for the Non-
Partisans will be succeeded by disgust and contempt.
It has often been paid that the Deacon Fitch party
was designed to aid the aspirations of Democratic
office-seekers, and that the Republicans in it were
used to perfect the scheme. Whether this is true or
not will be ascertained during the next few days.
DEOTH AFLOAT AT SEA.
LUMBERMEN arc debating whether there is
profit in the towing of gigantic rafts, which go
to pieces in the ocean. They look at the matter
purely from the standpoint of financiers. It is time
the public should be considered. No more remorse
less instrument of death ever threatened the passen
ger on the deep than one of these same rafts, derelict,
swirling in the current, tossed by the waves, and
lea\ing in its uncertain wake a thousand logs, each
one a menace to life. Such a possibility is horrible
to contemplate, and yet the lumbermen question only
as to whether the raft will pay.
When the Santa Rosa arrived yesterday it brought
a story of one of the narrowest escapes ever recorded.
It had been in actual contact with a huge piece of
a castaway raft. So close had the monster come to
it that the paint had been scraped from the boat and
its patent log had been torn away. Had the weather
not been ciear the peril could not have been avoided,
and but for the sharp eye and quick action of the
lookout destruction would have been inevitable and
complete. The raft would have cut the hull from the
Santa Rosa, and in all probability every soul on board
have perished miserably. The boat was carrying 211.
Are there so few tragedies of the sea that steps must
deliberately be taken to create more?
A few days before the Humboldt was picking its
course through a flock of piles, the wreckage of part
of the raft. For hours it was in the gravest peril. Had
the fog hung low, as often it does, the craft would
have been helpless, and its probable destiny the bot
tom. Had there been fog when the Santa Rosa met
its share of the raft, escape would have been impos
sible.
When next the lumbermen shall figure on setting a
raft loose in the Pacific, let them take into considera
tion that people go down to the sea in ships. They
have no more right to set at large a monster raft.
v hich no towline can control, than a railroad com
pany would to ?et a train unmanned on a down grade
to rush into the city under full head of steam.
THE SITUATION AT FfISHODA.
BRITISH and French dealings with one another
at Fashoda have some of the elements of
comic opera, some of sound common sense,
and some of the truest chivalry. Two armed forces
engaged in a struggle for conquest and dominion
meet at a strategic point of vast importance, but in
stead of fighting they merely warn one another to
retire, and then both proceed to camp on the dis
puted field and to act as if they had met for a picnic
rather than a fight.
The chivalrous touch to the situation is given in the
recent report that the British have furnished the
French with the food on which they are now living.
It appears that Marchand, the commander of the
French force, in his haste to reach Fashoda before
the British, had neglected to provide supplies ample
to maintain himself, and was in such sore straits
when the British arrived that he. would, have been
compelled to retire had they not furnished him with
provisions. To the daring Frenchman, therefore, the
coming of Kitchener's advance guard was something
more like the arrival of a relief expedition than of a
hostile force.
The French and the British at Fashoda are now
virtually drinking out of the same canteen. They are'
drawing their supplies from the same store. They
naturally feel for one another the sympathies of civil
ized men meeting in the desert and surrounded by
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1898.
barbarians. They wait with more or less Eagerness
what is to be done by the diplomatists of London and
Paris. They are living as friends, and it depends
upon others to decide whether they shall part that
way or be set to fighting before they separate.
Fortunately for both parties there is little proba
bility of war. The concert of Europe has not been
very potent in dealing with problems for the solution
of which action is required, but it has managed very
successfully all that could be arranged by non-action.
It has been a peace preserver of great merit, and is
not likely to break down at this juncture. The situa
tion at Fashoda is too good a comedy to be spoiled
by converting it into a tragedy.
PACIFIC OCEAN COMMERCE.
JAMES J. HILL, president of the Great North
ern Railroad, who for some time past has been
making a careful study of Pacific Ocean com
merce, has, although a Democrat, reached the con
clusion that the Republican party is right in advo
cating the adoption by the Government of a policy
designed to promote American shipping interests.
This conclusion he has announced in recent inter
views, and not long ago, in an address at St. Paul,
he made it the theme of an elaborate and notable
speech, backing it with arguments of indisputable
validity and strength.
Mr. Hill began by pointing out that the Pacific
Ocean offers at this time a better field for American
shipping enterprise than the Atlantic, for the reason
that while Atlantic commerce is carried on "by steam
ferries leaving almost every hour of the day from one
side or the other of the Atlantic Ocean," there is on
the Pacific a comparative freedom from that exces
sive competition. Moreover, beyond the Pacific
there is an enormous market awaiting our products,
and that market is of vast importance to us.
At the present time Great Britain is virtually the
only foreign consumer of our wheat, cotton and raw
material generally, and we have to sell in competition
with all other producing countries in the Liverpool
market at the price offered there. By establishing
adequate transportation facilities between our Pacific
Coast and the Orient we would find in Asia a market
for all American food products west of the Rocky
Mountains, and thus save the Pacific Coast producers
from having to compete with Eastern producers in
the markets of Great Britain.
It is clear that until we have sufficient ships to
carry our produce to Asiatic ports we cannot profit
by the increasing demand there for our goods. Nor
can these ships be constructed and operated profitably
without some form of protection from the Govern
ment. The merchant marine of other great commer
cial nations is aided by liberal subsidies, and it is in
vain that American ships, unaided and unprotected,
have attempted to compete with them. Thus it is
that the absence of legislation favorable to the
ocean-going ships of the country has prevented our
merchant marine from advancing as rapidly as other
great American industries.
As to the advantages to be gained from the exten
sion of our Pacific Ocean commerce, Mr. Hill said:
"If the surplus wheat from the Pacific Coast were
carried to Asia, in place of being carried to Europe,
and there compete with the agricultural products of
the States east of the Rocky Mountains, you would
advance the price of wheat from 10 to 20 cents a
bushel. It would reduce the exports to Europe from
one hundred million to sixty or seventy million
bushels a year."
The evil effect of having only the European market
for our produce has long been evident to all stu
dents of our commercial and industrial problems.
Mr. Hill has outlined the true remedy. The nation
needs an extension of Pacific Ocean commerce, and
to achieve that it has only to provide for the up
building of the American merchant marine on this
coast.
A MODEL document of its kind is the platform
of principles and policies applicable to muni
cipal affairs adopted by the Republican conven
tion. It is comprehensive in its scope and clear and
emphatic in every utterance. There is not an eva
sive plank in it. It deals with live issues and is free
from those platitudes of "glittering generalities"
which of late years have been so common in thfe plat
forms of all parties. The committee that drew up the
document did the work well, and the convention is to
be congratulated on being so ably served.
In some respects this declaration, coming from the
Republican party, may be regarded as marking an
epoch in local politics. It outlines a broad scheme of
municipal improvement and development, and pro
pores measures calculated to advance the interests not
only of the community as a whole, but of individuals.
It is", in fact, a manifesto in favor of progress all
along the line, and gives promise of a new era in the
development of the city.
Notable among the declarations are those pledging
the legislative nominees of the convention to vote for
the ratification of the new charter by the Legislature,
favoring the ownership by the municipality of all pub
lic utilities, pledging the nominees for Supervisors to
fix water rates at an amount which will yield to the
water company a revenue not exceeding 5 per
cent on its capital stock, to provide for the bet
ter lighting of streets, and to conduct the affairs of
the municipality with such honesty and economy as
to enable the whole expense to be defrayed by the
revenue derived from a tax rate not exceeding $i
on the $too of assessed valuation not exceeding
$350,000,000.
Other important portions of the platform declare
for street improvements, the elimination from the
public schools of all useless text-books, a daily wage
of not less than $2 for eight hours' work to be stipu
lated in all contracts for public work, and that white
bbor and California material must be made terms
of al! public franchises.
The document is in itself, however, too concise and
terse to admit of digest. It should be studied by every
voter. It is unquestionably the most important poli
tical paper, from a local point of view, that has been
put forth for many years, and as the men who have
been nominated to make the canvass upon it can be
counted on to fulfill its pledges so far as lies in their
power, the progressive element of the people should,
without regard to. party, support i'and them in the
interests of a progressive San Francisco.
Since the jobbery planned between Corbett and
McCoy has been exposed, pugilists are likely to no
longer enjoy that high public esteem in which they
have basked heretofore. The knowledge that a pugi
list would be dishonorable, or, as he would express
it, "give the guys a jolly," comes with a shock.
President McKinley will have a special car in which
to travel between Washington and Omaha, and very
properly. The attempt to sneer at the scheme merely
shows thnt here and there a Democratic editor has a
small soul he wishes to put on display.
Perhaps Judge Mogan would do well to hire a
small boy when there is necessity foÂ«- such important
work as the issuing of a warrant.

THE MAN FOR THE PEOPLE.
A CONSCIENTIOUS CITIZEN.
The nomination of Charles L. Patton for Mayor of San Francisco
lifts the Republican canvass upon what ought to be a winning
plane. Mr. Patton, though always a Republican, has never been a
politician; though highly competent to lead, he has never sought the
position of a boss; and though zealous in his desire for honest muni
cipal politics and lower taxes, he has never made a trade of reform
for the sake of putting himself into power. In his case the nomina
tion for Mayor sought the man, and in finding him hit upon a con
scientious citizen who would not accept it until he had made sure
that his principles would permit him to run on the intended platform.
It is c.c of the personal advantages of Mr. Patton that he is a
native son, and perfectly familiar through a long residence in this
city, with its municipal needs. His father was a pioneer; he himself
was born In Petaluma thirty- six fears ago. His education was
gained in he East, from which he returned to San Francisco in 1885
to enter the practice of the law. Outside of the duties of hia profes
sion but little has attracted him hitherto into the arena of publicity.
But tha* little stamped him as a man of energy and rare executive
parts; for it was Charles L. Patton who made* such an astonishing
financial success of the Masonic Fair which was held for the purpose
of raising funds for the home at Decoto.
If Mr. Patton is elected Mayor he will give the city a business
administration to match the one that Henry T. Gage will give the
State. There will be no pretense and spectacular posturing about
It. Mr. Patton Is not a man to spend time which the people pay him
to use in "seeing and counting" the public funds, in the preparation
of self-lai datory speeches about the reformer In politics. Nor is he a
man to usurp the right to name Boards of Supervisors. He has no
taste for grand-stand plays; but he is the man to make a vigilant,
common-sense, matter-of-fact, honest and efficient city executive, who
believes in reduced expenses, lower taxes and square dealing, and
will live up to that belief if elected.â The Chronicle.
HE KEPT HIS WORD.
"I have made no fight for the nomination, and I have no lnten
tion of making one. Some days ago it was suggested to me that I
might have a chance, but I then announced to the friends who spoke
to me that I would not take the nomination under any circumstan
ces. Since that time more friends have seen me and presented the
matter in such a light that I consented to allow the i se of my name
In the convention. But let me make it emphatic that I have made
no fight for it. It must come in the nature of a unanimous desire of
the party members. If the party thinks it might be advantageous to
have me act as Mayor, I will accept the honor. In such an event I
would then enter actively into the campaign.
"The mere unanimity among the party members would not be In
itself sufficient. I should insist, before accepting the nomination, that
the platform be in line with my views. I am a taxpayer and I want
the dollar limit. I also want the municipal ownership of public utili
ties. I should Insist that the platform include a demand for the con
firmation of the new charter. I am thoroughly in sympathy with it,
and will use every effort, whether nominated or not, to make it oper
ative. I am allied to no corporations, I am not held by any strings,
I haven't sought nomination and I propose to work on this sort of
line. If the nomination should come to me unanimously and if the
platform were satisfactory I would take the nomination ana look to
the welfare of the people should I be elected." â C. I*. Patton in
Wednesday's Examiner.
THE REPORT KNOWS HIM.
Charles L. Patton has finally agreed to the use of his name as a
candidate for the Republican nomination of Mayor. He is doubtless
the strongest man In the Republican ranks. He is the strongest be
cause he is a fine, frank, manly, fearless citizen, with a flawless rec
ord, tireless zeal and marked intelligence. â Daily Report.

to the game and you will determine who
goes out. If at the close of the game A
has three to go and B has five to go, B
should have made cards, spades and aces
and A made bis and little casino, B would
count first, and having made more than
what was wanted would go out. Had B
made but cards and spades and one ace
he would go out, as he would have the
requisite five.

Country Devastated.
Fpeelal Dispatch to The Call.
DENVER, Colo., Sept. 30.â Reports
from the Western portion of the State
continue to tell of the ravages of the
forest fires -which bid fair to devastate
the greater part of the forests of the
State. A special from Glenwood
Springs, the center of the burning dis
trict, says: The fires in the mountains
near here have taken fresh life to-day,
owing to high winds. The sun has been
nearly obscured all day and the at
mosphere is heavy with smoke. The
fire east of Glenwood is, fortunately, in
an unsettled portion of the county, and
aside from the Immense loss by the
burning of timber, no loss has occurred
up to the present time. The stock on
the range, as far as heard from, has
escaped the fire.
A special to the Nfws from Kokomo,
Colo., says: Forest /Ires are raping on
every hand here. Sheep Mountain, on
the north side, if a mass of flames,
which reach within a quarter of a mile
of this camp. Great apprehension is
felt here for the safety of the town.
The origin of the fire here is supposed
to be sparks from engines.
A special from Montrose, Colo., says:
The forest fire southeast of town about
twenty-live miles has now reached
large proportions and can plainly be
seen from town. The range between
Hairpin Mesa and Sawtooth Mountain
is nearly devastated.
The weather man can offer no hope
for those on the western slope whose
homes and crops are threatened by the
forest tires. There are no indications
whatever of rain, and this seems to be
the only element to stay the flames'
fury. Throughout Eagle County high
winds have prevailed, giving a fresh
impetus t<i the forest fires that are
devastating the timber domain.
In consequence, new territory is being
devoured. The blaze is rapidly extend
ing along the grand reserves of Girard
Mountain, West of Homestake Creek,
and from present appearances will
sweep the country to Bear Mountain, at
Mint urn.
Back of Minturn. to the heads of Wil
low and Two Elks, the country is de
vastated, little remaining to feed the
flames. From Hoosler Mountain fhe
wind has driven the fire to the edge of
Gypsum Creek. The aottlew of L'pper
Gypsum, Gannon, Collins and others
are fighting desperately to save their
homes and stop its passage across into
the magnificent forest of West Brush.
If it gets into Brush the finest body of
timber in the Â£tate is gone. No loss of
lift- has been reported, but several peo
ple have lost their homes and their
crops. All the game is leaving the
country, escaping the smoke and heat
of the blazing woods.
Dispatches received here say that
Wheyley's Peak, between North and
Middle Park, is now a mass of flames,
and it is greatly feared that the fire
will extend to both of those beautiful
camping grounds. The flames have al
ready cut a swathe thirty- five miles
long from the Grand River almost to
Dillon, in Summit County. The width
is as yet unknown. Kremmling, in
Grand County, has had a narrow escape
and the danger is not yet entirely over.
The fires in the vicinity of Ouray are
not as bad as they were during several
days previous, but the smoldering em
bers may be fanned into an awful con
flagration by i-iÂ« slightest wind.
The flrea Jii-rr^"! Aspen are working
down the mountain side toward the
town, although it is not burning with
the force it has been. At Gunnison,
Crested Butte. Wolcott and Glenwood
Springs, the fires are still raging. No
estimate of the damage to timber and
ranches can be given, but it will un
questionably run far into the thou
sands.

LOS ANGELES, Sept. 30.â Governor A.

During the day he suffered from high

Farms and Towns in the Fiery
Path Destroyed and Loss
of Life Reported.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHIPPEWA FALLS, Wls., Sept. 30.
âForest fires which have been spread
ing for days show no signs of abating
in Chipp.-wa and Clark counties. Out
side these two counties the fires have
generally been checked by rain or have
burned everything in sight.
The devastated district extends
through the counties running from Ab
bottsford along the Wisconsin Central
for 200 miles and north for 75 or 100
miles. It is estimated that 200,000,000
fetH of pine have been destroyed. Many
farm houses have been destroyed. Many
hundreds of farms in this county alone
have lost all their buildings and grain.
Organized bands of farmers have been
trying to stop the flames, but with lit
tle success. No estimate can be placed
upon the damage done to gathered
crops, buildings, lumber and growing
timber. The fires are thought to have
been started by farmers in clearing
their lands.
MILWAUKEE, Sept. 30.â Reports re
ceived at the railroad office in this city
are to the effect that the forest fires in
the northern part of the State were
quenched by a heavy fall of rain late
last night. The heaviest loss was suf
fered at Cumberland, where twenty
five families were rendered homeless by
the flames and a large sawmill plant,
valued at $225,000, was wiped out.
Only one death, as far as known, has
resulted, that of Mrs. Jacob Correson,
at Drywood. Two children of Mrs. Cor
reson were seriously burned while at
tempting to rescue their mother. The
pecuniary loss is not expected to reach
over $1,000,000.
ST. PAUL, Sept. 30.â A Cumberland
(Wis.) special to the Dispatch says:
Cumberland presents a sad sight to
day. The mill portion of the city is a
smoldering heap of ruins. The loss is
about $185,000. The forest fires were
swept into the city from the southwest
at about 5 o'clock last night by a tor
nado. The air was filled with smoke
and burning cinders, and the fire start
ed on the east and west sides of town
about the same time. The flames spread
with a rapidity that threatened not only
the entire city but the lives of the in
habitants. Every part of the town was
filled with smoke and flying firebrands,
and the people were running in every
direction panic-stricken with horror.
Two freight trains took about a hun
dred people to Shell Lake, and hun
dreds more sought the western lake
shore for safety.
Meanwhile the Volunteer Fire De
partment did heroic work In trying to
save the business portion of the city.
The wind had now assumed the voloc
ity of a tornado, and the atmosphere
was lurid with flames and the air was
filled with flying firebrands. A timely
downpour of rain, lasting about twenty
minutes, enabled the firemen to check
the progress of the flames on the west
side of the city, but no human power
could save the city east of the Omaha
Railroad, including the lumber yard and
mills of the Beaver Dam Lumber Com
pany and residences, among the latter
the fine house of Mayor Waterman.
MILWAUKEE, Wis., Sept. 30.â A dis
patch from Rice Lake says the forest
fires in that vicinity were checked by
light rains last night. Fifty farmers
near Rice Lake lost all their posses
sions. The Johnson Bros.' Lumber
Company, six miles west, lost its mill
and stock of hardwood lumber, with
no insurance.
The town of Alemena, near Rice
Lake, is reported destroyed. The Soo
Railroad bridge near Alemena was
burntd, stopping all trains on that line.
No loss of life has been reported. The
greatest damage has been done In the
townships of Cumberland, Turtle Lake,
Clinton, Stanford, Barron, Oak Grove
and Cedar.
A special from Eau Claire says the
Northwestern Lumber Company lost
2,000,000 feet of saw logs above Stan
ley.
Fifield, Wis., reports much damage
in that region. The road from the Pike
Lake summer resort to Fifield is im
passable on account of fallen timber,
and a number of guests will be obliged
to remain there until the road Is
cleared.
New Richmond, Wis., reports that the
fires around Clear Lake and Glenwood,
â which for a time threatened to destroy
those towns, are now nearly out, al
though much damage has been done.
Sprague, a small town on the Omaha
road, is rumored to have been partially
destroyed. Communication with the
place Is interrupted.

MERRITT PRAISES
WORK OF AMERICAN
TROOPS AT MANILA
Hardships Endured Without Mur
n)ur ar)d Great Bravery
Displayed.
Siege and Capture of MaQila Told Iq Detail by
the Military Governor's Official
Report.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 30.â The report
of Major General Wesley Merritt of the
operations about Manila was made
public at the War Department to-day.
It is dated on board the transport
China, August 31. After giving briefly
the story of his embarkation and ar
rival at Manila and the disposition of
the troops there he. says:
I found General Greene's command en
camped on a strip of sandy land running
parallel to the shore of the bay and not
far distant from the beach, but, owing
to the great difficulties of landing sup
plies, the greater portion of the force had
shelter tents only and were suffering
many discomforts, the camp being situ
ated in a low, flat place, without shelter
from the heat of the tropical sun or ade
quate protection during the terrific down
pours of rain, so frequent at this season.
I was at once struck by the exemplary
spirit of patient, even cheerful, endur
ance shown by the officers and men under
such circumstances, and this feeling of
admiration for the manner in which
American soldiers, volunteers and regu
lars alike, accept the necessary hardships
of the work they have undertaken to do,
has grown and increased with every
phase of the difficult and trying campaign
which the troops of the Philippine expedi
tion have brought to such a brililant and
successful conclusion.
The Filipinos, or insurgent forces at -war
with Spain, had, prior to the arrival of
the American land forces, been waging a
desultory warfare with the Spaniards for
several months, and were at the time of
my arrival in considerable force, various
ly estimated and never accurately ascer
tained, but probably not far from 25,000.
These troops, well supplied with small
arms, with plenty of ammunition and sev
eral field guns, had obtained positions of
investment opposite the Spanish line of
detached works throughout their entire
extent.
General Merritt then speaks of what
Agulnaldo had accomplished previous
to his arrival, and continues:
General Aguinaldo did not visit me on
my arrival nor offer his services as a sub
ordinate military leader, and, as my in
structions from the President fullf con
templated the occupation of the Islands
by the American land forces, as it was
' stated that the powers of the military oc
cupant are absolute and supreme and Im
mediately operate on the political condi
tion of the inhabitants, I did not consider
j it wise to hold any direct communication
with the insurgent leader until i should
be in possession of the city of Manila, es
pecially as I would not, until then, be in
a position to issue a proclamation and en
force my authority, in the event that his
pretensions should clash with my designs.
For these reasons the preparations for
the attack on the city were pressed and
military operations conducted without
reference to the situation of the insurgent
forces. The wisdom of this course was
subsequently fully established by the fact
that when the troops of my command car
ried the Spanish intrenehments, extending
from the sea to the Pasay road on the ex
treme Spanish right, we were under no
obligations, by prearranged plans of mu
tual attack, to turn to the right and clear
the front still held against the insurgents,
but were able to move forward at once
and occupy the city and suburbs.
To return to the situation of General
Greene's brigade, as 1 found it on riy
arrival, it will be seen that the difficulty
in gaining an avenue of approach to the
Spanish line lay In the fact of my dis
inclination to ask General Aguinaldo to
withdraw from the beach and "Calle
Real," so that Greene could move for
ward. This was overcome by Instructions
to General Greene to arrange, if possible,
with the insurgent brigade commander in
his immediate vicinity to move to the
right and allow the American forces un
obstructed control of the roads In their
immediate front. No objection was made,
and accordingly General Greene's brigade
threw forward a heavy outpost line on
the "Calle Real" and the beach and con
structed a trench in which some of the
guns of the Utah Battery were placed.
The Spanish, observing this activity on
our part, made a very sharp attack with
Infantry and artillery on the night of
July 31. The behavior of our troops dur
ing this night attack was all that i;ould
be desired, and I have in cablegrams to
the "War Department taken occasion to
commend by name those who deserve spe
cial mention for good conduct in the af
fair. Our position was extended' and
strengthened after this, and we resisted
successfully repeated night attacks, our
forces suffering, however, considerable
loss In wounded and killed, while the
losses of the enemy, owing to the dark
ness, could nnt bo ascertained.
The strain of the night fighting and the
heavy details for outpost duty mad,- it
Imperative to reinforce General Greene's
troops with General Mac Arthur's brigade,
which had arrived in the transports on
the 31st of July. The difficulties of this
operation can hardly be overestimated.
The transports were at anchor off Ca
vlte, five miles from a point on the beach
where it wns desired to disembark the
j men. A number of soualls accompanied by
floods of rain raged day after day. and
the only way to get the troops and sup
plies ashore was to load them from the
ship's side Into natjve lighters (called
cascos) or small steamboats, move them
to a point opposite the camp and then dis
embark thorn through the surf ni small
| boats or by running the lighters head on
to the beach. The landing was finally
accomplished, after days of hard work
and hardship, and 1 desire here to ex
press again my admiration for the forti
tude and cheerful willingness of the men
of all commands engaged In this opora-
Upon the assembly of Mac Arthur's brig
ade in support of Greene's I had about
8500 men in position to attack, and I
doomed the time had come for final ac
tion. During the time of the night at
tacks I had communicated my desire to
' Admiral Dewey that he would allow his
< ships to open fire on the right of tne
Spanish line of entrenchments. Relieving
that such action would stop the light I'r
irg and loss of life, but the admiril had
declined to order It unless we were in
danger of losing our position by the as
saults of the Spanish, for the reason that.
In his opinion, it would precipitate a gor;
' oral engagement, for which lie was not
' ready. Now, however, the brigade of Gen
! eral Mac Arthur was in position and the
Monterey hnd arrived, and under d;ito of
August G Admiral Dewey agreed to my
suggestion that we should send a joint
' letter to captain general notifying
him that "c should remove from the city
all non-combatants within fom--elght
1 hours and that operations against the de
i fenses of Manila might bocrin at any time
aicer the expiration of that period.
By orders Issued some time previously,
Mac Arthur'Â« and Greene's brigades were
organized as the second division of the
Eighth Army Corps, Brigadier General
Thomas M. Anderson commanding, and
In anticipation of the attack General An
derson moved -his headquarters from Ca
vite to the brigade camps and assumed
direct command in the Hold. Copies of
the written and verbal instructions re
ferred to above and appended hereto
I were given to the division and brigade
! commanders on the 12th, and all the
> troops wore in position on the 13th at an
early hour in the morning.
About 9 a. m. on that day our fleet
steamed forward from Cavite and before
10 a. m. opened a hot and accurate fire
of heavy snells and rapid fire projectiles
on the sea flank of the Spanish entrench
ments at the powder magazine fort and
at the same time the Utah batteries, in
position in our trenches near the Calle
Real, began firing with great accuracy.
At 10:25, on a prearranged signal from our
trenches that it was believed our troops
could advance, the navy ceased firing and
Immediately a light line of skirmishers
from the Colorado regiment of Greene's
brigade passed over our trenches and de
ployed rapidly forward, another lin^ from
the same regiment from the left flank of
our earthworks advancing swiftly up the
beach in open order. Both these linew
found the powder magazine fort and the
trenches flanking it deserted, but as they
passed over the Spanish works they were
met by a sharp fire from a second line
situated in the streets of Malate by
which a number of men were killed and
wounded, among others one soldier who
pulled down the Spanish colors still fly
ing on the fort and raised our own.
The works of the second line soon gave
way to the determined advance of
Greene's troops, and that officer pushed i
his brigade rapidly through Malate and j
over the bridges to occupy Binondo and
San Miguel, as contemplated in his in- |
structions. In the meantime the bri- i
gade of General Mac Arthur,' advancing
simultaneously on the Pasay road, en- j
countered a very sharp fire, coming from
the blockhouses, trenches and woods in
front, positions which it was very dlffl
cult to carry, owing to the swampy con- j
dltion of the ground on both sides of i
the roads and the heavy undergrowth '
concealing the enemy. With much gal- j
lantry and excellent judgment on the
part of the brigade commander and the
troops engaged these difficulties were
-^overcome with a minimum loss, and Mac-
Arthur advanced and held the bridges
and the town of Malate. as was contem
plated by his instructions.
The city of Malate was now in our pos
session, excepting the walled town, but
shortly after the entry of our troops into
Malate a white flag was displayed on the
walls, whereupon Lieutenant Colonel C.
A. Whittler, O. S. V.. of my staff, and
Lieutenant Brumby, U. S. N., represent
ing Admiral Dewey. were sent ashore
to communicate with the captain general.
I soon personally followed these officers
into the town, going at once to the palace j
of the Governor General, and there, after j
a conversation with the Spanish authori- |
ties a preliminary agreement of the j
terms of capitulation was signed by the;
captain general and myself. This agree-;
ment was subsequently incorporated into 1
the formal terms of capitulation, as ar
ranged by the officers representing tne
two forces. . _.
Immediately after the surrender the
Spanish colors on the sea front were
hauled down and the American Hag dis
played and saluted by the guns of the
navy The Second Oregon Regiment,
wnich had proceeded by sea from Cavite.
was disembarked and entered the walled
town as a provost guard and the colonel
was directed to receive the Spanish arms
and deposit them in places of security.
The town was filled with troops of the
enemy driven in from the entrenchments,
regiments formed and standing in line in
the streets, but the work of disarming
proceeded quietly and nothing unpleasant
occurred. In leaving the subject of the
operations of the 13th I desire here to
record my appreciation of the aamiranlo
manner in which the orders for attack
and the plan for occupation of the city
were carried out by the troops exactly
as contemplated. I submit that for troops
to enter under fire a town covering a
wide area, to rapidly deploy and guard
all principal points in the extensive sub
urbs, to keep out the insurgent forces
pressing for admission, to quietly disarm
an army of Spaniards more than equal in
number to the American troops, and final
ly by all this to prevent entirely all
rapine, pillage and disorder and gain en
tire and complete possession of a city of
300,000 people, filled with natives hostile
to European interests and stirred up by
the knowledge that their own people were |
fighting in the outside trenches was an
act which only the law abiding, temper
ate, rf-solute American soldier, well and
skillfully handled by his regimental and
brigade commanders, could accomplish.
General Merritt then details the in
auguration of the military govern
ment of Manila by the Americans. Fur
ther, he says:
On the 16th a cablegram containing the
text of the Presidents proclamation di
recting a cessation of hostilities was re
ceived by me a^nd at the same time an
order to make the fact known to the
Spanish authorities, which was done at
once. This resulted in a formal protest
from the Governor General in regard to
the transfer of public funds then taking
place, on the ground that the proclama
tion was dated prior to the surrender.
To this I replied that the status quo In
which we were left with the cessation
of hostilities was that existing at the
time of the receipt by me of official no
tice, and that J must insist upon the do
livery of the funds. The delivery was
made under protest.
After the issue of my proclamation, and
the establishment of my office as Mili
tary Governor, I had direct written com
munication with General Aguinaldo on
several occasions. He recognized my au
thority as Military Governor of the town
of Manila and suburbs, and made profes
sions of his willingness to withdraw his
troops to a line which I might indicate,
but at the same time asking certain fa
vors for himself. The matters in this

connection had not been settled at the
date of my departure. Doubtless much
dissatisfaction is felt by the rank and file
of the Insurgents that they have not been
permitted to enjoy the occupancy of Ma
nila, and there is some good ground for
trouble with them owing to the fact, but
notwithstanding many rumors to the con
trary, I am of the opinion that the lead
ers will be able to prevent serious dis
turbances, as they are sufficiently intelli
gent and educated to know that to an
tagonize the United States would be to
destroy their only chance of future politi
cal improvement.
I may add that great changes for the
better have taken place In Manila since
the occupancy of the city by American
troops. The streets have been cleaned
under the management of General Mac-
Arthur, and the police, under Colonel
Reeve, Thirteenth Minnesota, were most
efficient in preserving order. A stranger
to the city might easily imagine that the
American forces had been in control for
months rather than days.
In concluding his report General
Merrltt declares his indebtedness for
the success of the expedition to the bri
gade division commanders, the mem
bers of his staff and his personal aids.
He commends especially Brigadier R.
H. Hughes. Brigadier General Babcock,
Major McClure, Major Whipple and
Captain Mott for valuable services ren
dered.
All the documents, orders and procla
mations referred to in the report and
appended to the same have heretofore

SINGULAR STATEMENT.
From Mrs. Bank to Mrs. Pinkham.
The following letter to Mrs. Pink-
ham from Mrs. M. Rank, No. 2,354
East Susquehanna Aye., Philadelphia,
Pa., is a remarkable statement of re-
lief from utter discouragement. She
says:..
11 1 never can find words with which
to thank you for what Lydia E. Pink-
i ham's Vegetable Compound has done
forme. v
. '.' Some years ago I had womb trouble
and doctored for a long time, not see-
ing any improvement. At times I
would feel well enough, and other
I times . was miserable. So it went on
i until last October, I felt something
; terrible creeping over me, I knew not
I what, but kept getting worse. I can
hardly explain my feelings at that
j time. I was so depressed in spirits
that I did not wish to live, although I
had everything to live for. Had hys-
teria, was very nervous; could not
sleep and was not safe :to be left
alone. , : ' r
" Indeed, I thought I would lose my
mind. No one knows what I endured.
" 1 continued this way until the last
I of February, when I saw in a paper a
j testimonial of a lady whose case was
, similar to mine, and who r had ' been
; cured by Lydia, E. Pinkham's Vegeta-
I ble Compound. I determined to try it,
and felt better after the first dose. I
continued taking it, and to-day am a
well woman, and can say from my
heart, 'Thank God for such a medi-
cine.'" .â¢ :. . ,- -to : Y ;y

SPORTSMAN'S DAY
ON THE
FIELD AND MARSH
Blng! Bing! Here they come again, to
your right! Get down close! Now give
It to 'em! Good boy! Splendid, shot; got
'cm both!
Remarks of this kind will be heard
bright and. early this morning in the tules
where wild ducks are numerous and
where the.duck hunters will be ensconced
waiting for the coming of the dawn.
The moment there, will be light sufficient
on the Suisun marshes to-day for the
sportsmen to aim with any degree of cer
tainty the cracking of guns, and the
quacking of mallards will be something
extraordinary. â¢ Â° . ; '-v^-Â«
It is very safe to say that a ton of lead
will be scattered to-day on the Suisun
marshes. Latest reports from there state
that the ponds over the Ibis Club preserve
are literally black with ducks and that
thousands of mallard, sprig and teal will
be bagged. â  â¢
During the rainstorm last Monday night
several flocks of ducks passed over, the
city on their way south. There should be
very fair shooting on the Alviso marshes
this morning. â  ' â  . â¢ â¢ . -
The lovers of quail shooting will also
be strongly represented to-day and to
morrow on the uplands. W. J. Ahem will
try for quail to-morrow with Alphonse
Ligourl near Mount Eden; Lloyd Eaton/
.Charles Dietz, P. Johnson^ John Lcmmer,
W. Macrae and other members of the
Black Jack Club will try their luck near
Antioch. Jack Willis will locate at the
drawbridge near Alviso. George Hans
will be after quail in Redwood Canyon. ,
Dave Thorn and Clarence Haight will look
for snipe near Suisun. Professor Dick
Herring will scour the Meeks ranch, back
of Haywards, for quail. Jim Bell will
visit his old grounds back of Berkeley.
Among the many hunters who will be.
out to-morrow are Fred Dyche, Tom Gil
more, Judge Carey of East Oakland, Hon.
Thomas Casey and his dog Dot, Fred
Murdock. Bill Murdock, George Dennis,
Charles Cate, Ed Ladd, F. Vernon, Edgar
Foster and \V. Price. The members of the
Tamalpals and Country clubs will also be
on their preserves to-day bagging, quail
and snipe. It is said that the Supervisors
of Contra Costa County have limited by
ordinance the quail shooting in Contra
Costa to three days. ;
'Until recently the preservation of wild
game and the employment of keepers to
protect certain areas of land from intru
sion by unauthorized persons were viewed
with much disfavor, but as population
and with it the number of hunters has
Increased it has been found necessary to
adopt certain precautions against the ex
termination or game animals and birds.
So that at the present day large tracts of
upland or marsh are preserved by clubs
for the enjoyment of their..Â«mbers. The
most extensive preserves near San Fran
cisco are those of thef Country Club,
whose members have therjlght of hunt
ing over the picturesque region near
Point Reyes station, on the<San Francisco
and North Pacific Coast Raiiroau. . The
preserved . area comprises- the Howard,
Shatter and Hamilton ranches, and con
tains 76.000 acres. The deer during the
season just over have been quite as nu
merous as in any past year, and the fish
ing, especially for black bass in a lake
opened this year for the first time, has
been quite good. Quail are unusually nu
merous, and tne prospect for snipe on
the club marsh is promising. The fol
lowing are the officers of the Country
Club for 1898: President. Robert Oxnard;
vice president, H. R. Mann; secretary
and treasurer, Bernard Faymonville; di
rectorsâthe president, vice president,
secretary, F. W. Van Bidden, James Le
roy Nickel, C. F. Muilins, C. S. Wheeler
and John I. Sabin. : . :
One of the oldest sporting clubs in the
State is the Alameda County Sports
men's Club, the headquarters of which
is near McGllls station, on the Sonoma I
.Creek. The officers are as follows: Pres
ident, F. R. Noyes; vice president, George
Leviston; secretary and treasurer, M. D.
Falrchild. The club has thirty membersâ
a smaller number than it has had at some
earlier periods of its history, but enough
for good sport and good fellowship. The
stanch ark Alameda, anchored at the
head of the slough, furnishes comfortable
quarters for the gunners. The club will
be quite content if the coming season is
as good as was the last, and, though it is
too early to speak witn certainty, it may
be said that the prospects are fair.
: The Mlra Monte Gun Club has 10.000
acnes of uoland and 2000 acres of marsh
near Burdells, Marin County. It has a
handsome and very roomy club house,
with a frontage of 134 feet, and containing
a living-room, with a large open fireplace,
a. dining room, kitchen, pantries, twelve
bedrooms, two bathrooms and a billiard
room. . The club owns three gasoline
launches and half a dozen row boats. The
following are the officers: President, J.
B. Burdell ; secretary and treasurer, N.
N. Wilson; directorsâ president, sec
retary, J. H. Follis. G. A. Martin and H.
B. Houghton.
The Olympic Gun Club has grounds at
Ingleside, and has just concluded a very
successful trap shooting season. On Pet
aluma Creek it has 30,000 acres of marsh,
where for the past six weeks a keeper has
been employed in baiting the ponds. TWt
flight of the northern birds has not yet
begun, but there are plenty of mallard
and sprig, which breed on the marshes.
If we should have, as may reasonably be
expected, an early and wet winter, the
Olympic gunners will enjoy plenty of
sport. The club formerly occupied rooms
at 1309 "Van Ness avenue, but will soon
hold a formal house warming in Its new
and handsome quarters at the corner of
Morton and Kearny streets. On the Pet
aluma Creek tne club has a dormitory
accommodating twenty-five members, and
there is also a handsome private shooting
ark. The following are the officers for
, 1S98: President, Harlow H. White; re
cording and corresponding secretary,
Merton C. Allen; financial secretary, C. A.
Haight; treasurer, A. A. Borlini; direc
torsâ W. J. Golcher, E. T. Allen, C. W.
Hlbbard and C. F. Grant. The Olympic
Gun Club has 140 members.
, The Tamalpais Sportsmen's Club hunts
over the Morse, Stinson and Throckmor
ton ranches in Marln County, between
Point Bonlta and Mill Valley. During the
past season seventeen bucks were killed
by the members, . being two more than
â¢were run down in 1897 and eight fewer
than in 1896. The club, which is limited
to forty, has at present thirty contribut
ing members. President Otto Muser re
ports that the fishing has been fair dur
ing the past winter and spring, and that
the creek is full of small fish, which
promise good sport next season. The out
look for quail hunting is very favorable;
the birds nave bred well and large bevies
are to be seen. During the past season
many quail were trapped and transferred,
but the president considers that the
money spent thus was wasted. The offi
cers of the club for the coming season
pro: President, Otto Muser; vice presi
dent. J. Bergez; secretary, J. F. Siebe;
assistant secretary, F. P. Butler; direc
tors â the president, vies president, secre
tary. W. Berg, A. Pissis, A. Roos, J. 11.
Dickinson, W. L. Gerstle and F. Lacoste.
The principal clubs on the Suisun
marshes are the Cordelia, Ibis. Teai and
Tule. C. W. Kellogg is president of the
Cordelia Gun Club. Of the Tule Shooting
Club C. Josselyn Is president and Alexan
der Hamilton vice president. Among the
members are F. R. Webster Herman Oel
richs. F. Sharon, Baron J. H. yon Schroe
ser and J. Harvey Downey. The marshes
over which the Tule Club members shoot
lie between Benicla and Sulsun, and are
1000 acres In extent. The keepers report
plenty of birds. ..' :â  â 
Of the Ibis Gun Club 11. Babcock Is
president and M. H. McAllister secretary
fend treasurer. The directors of the club,
which is incorporated, are the president,
the secretary,- C. P. Eells, E. J. McCutch
en and E. Donohoe. The marshes over

pounty, near the drawbridge on the Cen
tral Pacific line. Ducks, snipe and geese
ire found there in abundance.
The headquarters of the Teal Club is
at Teal station, on the Suisun marshes,
and the preserves extend,, over about 2000
Â»ores. The keeper reports a goodly num
ber of ducks. J. B. Stetson Is president,
W. F. Whlttler vice president and Edwin
Soodall' secretary, and among the mem
bers are W. B. Gerber, A. Borel, Henry

THE FIELD OF SPORT
NOTES AND GOSSIP
OF
THE DIAMOND.
O"wÂ«ing to the scheduled football contest
there will be no game at Recreation
Park to-day.
Now that the time has arrived for the
college students to tear one another to
pieces. Recreation Park will very seldom
Ibe at leisure to entertain those other
knights of the field known as baseball
toasers on Saturdays. A change will,
therefore, be necessary, and from indica
! tions all Saturday games will be trans
ferred to Central Park. There was some
talk regarding the Sixteenth and Folsom
street grounds, but as they are situated
so far from the natural drift of things it
is not likely that any of the games will
be played there. It would, in my opinion,
be a bad move to play at such an out of
the way park. It took some time to draw
those lovers of the great game down to
Eighth and Harrison, and many went
there under protest. It is certain that
they would not travel to Sixteenth and
Folgom streets to see any kind of a game,
and therefore. In view of this fact. Cen
tral Park is quite deserving of the prefer
ence.
The emergency board is having its trou
bles agaJn. The only "Josh" Rellly, be
cause of a deficiency in regard to salary
matters, .severed connections with tha'
once-famous athletic collection, and
donned the uniform of tin- Uilt Edy<-.s.
The game in which he participated was
won by his side, and in consequence the
vanquished protested the contest, claim
ing that Reilly had no right to play with
any other club but the Athletics.
If I am not mistaken there is a rule
covering this Important question, the sub
stance of which implies: "If a player be
not paid after a certain date he is privi
leged to go where he wishes." Reilly, as
everybody is aware, was virtually mulct
ed of two months' salary, and that he
had a right to sign with another organi
zation I have no doubt. How the emer
gency board will handle those protests
remains to be seen. One thing, however,
Is this: Reilly should receive what money
is due him. No player in the league has
done more for the advancement and good
of the game than this man Reilly. If he
had been located properly an opportunity
for a protest would never have presented
itself. The emergency board should set
tle his salary and let the protested
games remain on the slate. By so doing
the good of the rooters will be theirs,
and this, by the way, is a something
worth catering to, especially so at this
stage of uncertainty.
Pat Mecney, the new acquisition of the
San Franciscos, acquitted himself nobly,
ho Manager Coffroth states, in his first
game on Sunday last. "He is a great
player," says "Fairest James," "and will
be of untold worth to the team. At pres
ent he is out of condition and is neces
sarily incapacitated, to a certain extent,
but a few days' practice will condition
him so as to 'enable him to be right :n
the frame."
Meeney is an Eastern League player,
and comes with a ciean record. With him
and one or two more â I might have said
with five or six moreâ the Friscos
should put up a much better game. Man
ager Bunker also states that he has en
gaged a pitcher on Meeney's recommen
dation, and if he turns out as expected
nothing in the league will be near them.
Bunker is a fluent speaker.

MANY PRIZES
WON BY
MARKSMEN.
The fall shooting festival of the Cali
fornia Schuetzen Club at Schuetzen Park
last Sunday and Monday was a very suc
cessful affair in a social and financial
way. While many of the scores made by
the marksmen were published at the time
It was not until several days later that
the committee having the management
of the affair was able to figure up all of
the records and the winners. To-morrow
the club will hold a grand reunion and
distribution of prizes at the Schuetzen
Park and range. In the forenoon the
monthly medal shoot will take place, and
the afternoon will be devoted to handing
to the winners the cash prizes and tro
phies they shot so well for to win. So
ciability and games will be the order of
the afternoon. Annexed are the winners

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1898.
"THE HUNTER'S MOON'S BEGUN!"
ALL ABOUT DOGS
AND THEIR OWNERS
On Wednesday last the convention of
dog clubs of July 27 was reconvened at
the Occidental Hotel by Dr. F. W.D'Eve
lyn, who signed the call as "chairman
of preliminary meeting," the object of the
meeting being for the purpose of "taking
such action as may be deemed advisable
for the best interests of Pacific Coast
dogdom." H. T. Payne and John E. Doak
were again to the fore with some half
dozen proxies each. It was a Payne
meeting from Btart to finish.
The delegates were: J. P. Norman for
Pacific Mastiff Club, G. W. Debenham for
Fox Terrier Club, R. J. Stewart for Col
lie Club, C. R. Harker and P. Ward for
San Jose Kennel Club, Dr. D'Evelyn and
J. G. Barker for San Francisco, M. Cof
fey for Sacramento, C. R. White for Oak
land, and H. T. Payne and John E. Doak
for four other clubs.
The proceedings opened with a debate
on the character of the meeting, J. P.
Norman refusing to act as secretary on
the ground that the meeting at which he
had served in that capacity had accom
plished its purpose and had no further
raison d' etre. J. C Barker of the San
Francisco Kennel Club supported this
view. H. T. Payne, however, moved that
the meeting resolve itself into a continu
ation of the former convention. This
motion was carried, and C. R. Harker,
who had been elected secretary pro tern,
vacated the seat in favor of Mr. Norman.
Mr. Payne controlled the meeting with
his proxies, and on taking a vote seces
sion was carried by a vote of 11 to 4. The
delegates of the San Francisco Kennel
Club refused to vote, having received
no instructions, but nevertheless it was
plainly indicated by them and by J. E.
deÃuyter, their vice president, who was
present, that the local club Is deadset
against secession. The Pacific Mastiff.
Fox Terrier and Oakland clubs voted
against the resolution, and their delegates
withdrew from further part In the pro
ceedings.
H. T. Payne nominated Dr. D'Evelyn
for president, Marshall P. Snell of Ta
coma for vice president, C. R. Harker for
secretary-treasurer, and seconded N. J.
Stewart and M. Coffey for the other vice
presidents. These gentlemen were con
sequently elected.
The league will have no regular meet
ing-place, but will meet at the different
shows held, and those unable to attend
will send proxies.

ously ill, and is going to San Diego ta

OARSMEN WILL
MEET AT
BOHEMIAN LAKE.
Little is talked of at present among the
rowing men except the regatta at Guerne
ville The Guerneville Improvement Club
is sparing no pains to make the event a
success, and the oarsmen of San Fran
cisco have responded enthusiastically to
their invitation. The course is one and a
quarter miles straightaway, and from the
level banks of the river every incident ot
the races can be clearly seen. The river
has been dammed up and forma a sheet
of water known as Bohemian Lake; hard
by are the noble redwoods of Bohemian
Grove
As it was expected that the champion
shin regatta would be held toward the
close of October, several large crews and
skiff men are already in good practice
and glad of the opportunity to race The
Olympic Boat Club would like to send a
crew, but as their boathouse is at Tiburon
the members cannot practice on any day
except Sunday; if they can obtain per
mission to use a barge belonging to any
"her club, a four will >je got together.
It will probably consist of Julius Morton,
H. CoUins, Frank Grim and Paul Sturde
vant; H. Herzer will not be available, as
he starts on his vacation to - d , a >',- a I n .l,^J. l i
not return for two weeks. The Olympics
hope also to enter a crew at the cham
pionship regatta. A meeting will be held
next Tuesday to discuss this and other
rowing matters. .
The South End Rowing Club will send
a barge crew and some single scullers to
Guerneville, and will have a senior ana
junior barge crews In the championship
regatta Dr. C. C. Dennis, M. Breen and
J. Lyons are going out frequently in
Skiffs; V. Koster and G. Bates will prob
ably enter the junior skiff event at the
Long Bridge regatta.
A performance will be given at union
Square Hall on Saturday evening, Octo
ber 8, for the benefit of the parents of
the late Daniel D. Connolly, a well-known
and highly esteemed member of the South
End Kowing Club. El Dorado Parlor No.
52, N. S. G. W., and Golden Gate Coun
cil No. 34, Young Men's Institute, will
W. O. Patch of the Dolphins will pull
in the skiff race at Guerneville, and A. W.
Pape and V. Caglieri will enter the swim
ming races. The Dolphin intermediate
barge crew Is keeping up its regular prac
tice.
The Tritons, who do a good deal of
rowing during the winter, are having all
their boats put in order. Though they
have joined the association they will not
enter any barge crew for the champion
ship regatta; they may possibly enter a
skiff-man.
The Pioneers have two crews in train
ing, and will send their junior barge crew
to Guerneville. C. Ochs will pull in the
skiff race on Bohemian Lake, and many
members will attend; two tents have been
engaged already. George Callopy has re
turned from the Klondike, and is expect
ed to reach this city in a few days; he
will pull either in the intermediate barge
crew or in the championship junior skiff
event. The Pioneer men who are to take
part in the Guerneville regatta will go
up either on Friday night, October 14, or
on Saturday morning, October 15.
The Alameda Boat Club, at its last
meeting decided to take part in the
Guerneville regatta, to which it will send
a barge crew and skiff-men. Many of the
members will attend. It was also decided
to buy pleasure boats for the use of mem
bers. There is much activity around the
clubhouse, especially on moonlight nights.
George Hagy was elected a member at the
last meeting. The Alameda junior four
is made up thus: Chester Ayers, bow;
Bert Guild, No. 2; D. Greenleaf, No. 3,
and E. Hunter, stroke.
J. O'Connell and Archie Taylor of the
Ariels met with a mishap last Sunday;
they were rowing in a pair-oared shell,
one of the oars snapped and over went
the boat; they were in the water for a
quarter of an hour before a Pioneer barge
crew picked them up. F. Wilson and
John Fickert are regularly training for
the championship regatta. G. Phelan and
C. Sternberg- will represent the Ariels in
the skiff race at Guerneville. There will
be a tryout to-morrow between the Wil
son and the Lynch barge crews; the win
ners will be tried against another crew
on Sunday, October 9. A set of barge
oars and two pairs of sculls have been
received from Donahue, the Eastern mak
er, and the new barge built by Al Roger's
is expected to be ready to-morrow. The
Ariel barge crews have been In training'
for three weeks already.
CYCLERS' ANNUAL
HANDICAP
AT TEN MILES.
The annual ten-mile handicap of the
Associated Cycling Clubs over the
straightaway course from Pruitvale to
Haywards will be helC a week from to
morrow, and a large number of men are
in training for the event. This race
offers more attractions to the individual
wheelmen than a team race. In the team
race, such as the 100-mile relay and the
twenty mile, each man shares the glory
with the other members of the team if
his club wins the race, and there is con
siderable espirit de corps manifested; but
in the twenty-five mile and the ten mile
there is a chance for him to win a val
uable prize for himself, such as a gold
watch, a diamond and many other arti
cles of lesser value. Hence, the twenty
five mile in February and the ten mile
to be run Sunday week attract the great
er number of riders.
Entries close with W. L. Loos, chair
man of the road-racing committee, 14
Golden Gate avenue. The committee has
made a cast-iron rule that no entry will
be accepted unless accompanied by the
entrance fee of $1, and this will be rigidly
adhered to.
The Imperial Cycling Club will hold a
five-mile road race over the San Leandro
course to-morrow, preparatory for the
ten mile the following Sunday. Captain
Ed W. Schneider has called a run to wit
ness the race, taking the 9 a. m. boat
Training quarters have been established
by the club at 12i locust avenue, near
Van Ness. The next members' meeting
of the club will be held Monday, October
3, at the clubrooms, 14 McAllister street
A whist tournament, theater party, smok
er and dance are on the cards for the Im
perials in thi near future.
What promises to be one of the most
Important meetings the Associated Clubs
have held fn many months will take place
to-night at the California Club rooms
Twenty-second and Folsom streets. The
principal interest will center in the
position the association will take
regarding the racing situation now
that all the prominent Eastern
racing men have aeserteU the League
of American Wheelmen, .and the Califor
nia Association has been invited to take
up the reins of government. "Uncle Rob
ert" Welch, Charley Adams, Tom Hill and
other prominent speakers are priming for
the occasion, and the harrangue will prob
ably be long and earnest.
The Reliance Club Wheelmen will hold
a five-mile road race t&-morrow morning
at 11 o'clock sharp at SSh Leandro. In
the afternoon a series of club races will
be run on the Elmhurst track.
Vincent A. Dodd, vice-president of the
C. A. C. C, was in the city Thursday
from Sacramento.
Sol Pelser, the leader in cycling circles
at Chico, has been In town for the past
week renewing old acquaintances.
The Olympic Club Wheelmen celebrated
the winning of the Baker & Hamilton
trophy by an entertainment at the club
house last Tuesday evening, which was
largely attended.
The proposed race meet between the
Olympics and the Bay Citys will probably
be dropped until next year, owing to the
lateness of the season and the liability of
a rainstorm spoiling all their preparaJona.
THE OLYMPICS AND
CALIFORNIAS
WILL LINE UP
A few weeks ahead of the chrysanthe
mums the football season will be ush
ered in this afternoon when the Olym
pics line up against the eleven wearing
the blue and gold stripes. It will bo the
first game since the intercollegiate match
of Thanksgiving day, 1897, and the enthu
siasts have been waiting for it with im
patience. Whether it will be good or
bad foosball does not matter ao long as
It is football. It is not likely that the
game will show the latter day perfection,
but It will be a contest worthy of the
seeing.
The Olympics took their first practice
last Monday on the Recreation Grounds,
Eighth and Harrison streets, where the
game will be played to-day. About sev
enteen men turned out â¢ and the prelim
inary work was begun. On account of
the scarcity of men the Olympics will not
have a second eleven for daily practice,
but this is really not a hardship as it
at first seems. The Olympics are with
very few exceptions all train- d players
who have fought on tht- line shoulder tÂ»
shoulder. As far as defensive work goes
the Olympic athletes are not in a serious
condition at present. Later on when the
college men improve their play ami are
steauily advancing to the perfection of
their Thanksgiving day form the Olym
pics will be handicapped by this lack of
active practice. The offensive work will
be a matter of signal practice and tha
execution of plays without opposition.
On the Berkeley campus a new system
of training and preparation has been in
stituted by Coach Cochran. He allows
the men to smoke and to take an oc a
sional stimulant, deeming it wise not to
restrict them to a rigid course Â£
training at this early day. He thinks thtit
the deteat of Princeton with its sup
posed invincible team at the hands or
Yale last year was due to a premature
training and a consequent going stale of
the team. The Californians line up for
active practice, but no one man is kept
in position for any length of time, Coch
ran's coaching is a pk-asure to watch.
One has only to see him in action for
live minutes to appreciate the greatness
of his football intelligence. His eye is
as sharp as the edge of a. knife, and there
is hardly a detail of the practice which
ho does not grasp. He seems to know
just how each man conducts himself in
every play. One thing is noticeable about
his coaching, and that is a freedom from
profanity. Â . Â
The greatest blow to the blue and gold
eleven is the withdrawal of Cadwalader
from the ranks. It is hoped that he will
reconsider his intention not to play with
California this year and don the grui
iron moleskin. The rule which the big
Eastern colleges have adopted which pro
hibits a man from playing with a college
eleven unless he has been a year In tne
university prior to the beginning of the
season is what is assigned by Cadwalader
as his reason for not playing w'lth Cali
fornia. He intends to return to Yale next
year, and if he played here this season
that would prevent his playing in the
that will line up this
afternoon will be a very heavy one. There
is some doubt about Hobbs playing cen
ter Counting him out of the line-up
Ward or Bandy will play center. V*fâ¢
is the lighter of the two, weighing in the
neighborhood of 185 pounds. Bandy is a
man of gigantic proportions, tipping the
fclÂ°eatâ¢ Smith, the best left guard
on the coast, will play his old Position.
Middlemas, who has shown up well dur
ing the games of the last two years un
der the Olympic standards, will be on
the other side of the center. The three
tackle positions will be distributed among
Billy Sexton, Erskine and Nelson. Bex
ton will Play left tackle and either Ers
kine or Nelson right tackle and perhaps
both. Fletcher McNutt, who played
right end for the University of California
eleven under Butterworth's coaching, will
guard the right end of the Olympic line.
Tausig will play the other end position.
Back of the line the Olympics will have
some new and some old plfiyers. If Code
can by any possibility turn out on the
field he will play quarter; otherwise Roy
Weldon, the former fallback, will appear
in his place. Weldon, who is by no means
a Tight man,, will play quarter because the
Olympic material is all of a heavier or
der. Joyce, who played half on the Low
ell High School team, will play half or
end. Sheehy, the big guard who is re
puted the best on the coast, will have to
?)lay back of the line. He will be found
n the line-up as left half, a new position
for him. King will play right half. If
Code plays quarter. Weldon will go to
full, otherwise De Ballister or Atkinson

A Remarkable Case.
The following case was printed original-
ly in the Monitor, a newspaper published
at Meaford, Ontario. Doubts were raised
as to its truthfulness, consequently a
close watch was kept on the case for two
years, and the original statement has now
been completely verified.
Mr. Petch had been a hopeless paralytic
for five years. His case has had wide at-
tention. He was confined to his bed, was
bloated almost beyond recognition and
could not take solid food. Doctors called
the disease spinal sclerosis, and all said
he could not live. The Canadian Mutual
Life Association, after a thorough exami-
nation, paid him his total disability claim
of $1650, regarding him as forever incur-
able.
For three years he lingered in this con-
aitioii. Al-
ter taking

was a slight

Oliver Lindsay, a delegate from the
First Ward, who has been seen in many
conventions, moved thai unless the lobby

FEWER PRIBYLOFF SKINS.
Pelagic Sealing Is "Petering Out" in
the Bering Sea.
J. Stanley Brown, accompanied by his
wife, arrived on the Leelanaw yesterday
from the Pribyloff Islands, where Mr.
Brown has been stationed during the en
tire summer. He 1b the general agent of
the North American Commercial Com
pany, and while in the north looks out
specially for that company's vast sealing
interests.
"The catch this year will fall short of
that of last season," he said yesterday
at the Occidental. "The exact number of
Beals which we have taken this year on
the island is 18,032, which is 2uoo less than
last year. There is no doubt that the
seal industry on the Pribyloff Islands, is
petering out. Year by year there is a
falling off, and the diminution is very
noticeable.
"The pelagic sealing shows even poorer
results. The total catch of all the schoo
ners in the Bering Sea does not exceed
15.000. I should place the number of seals
caught at between 1..000 and 15,000. The
owners of schooners engaged In seal fish
ing are really Buffering from the poor
success they "meet with. 1 know a num
ber of them who would willingly sell
their ships and <;"it the business if they
could see their way out of it."
Mr Brown was in Dutch Harbor the
greater part of the time that he spent in
the Pribyloffs. He says that affairs are
in a flourishing condUion there on ac
count of its position. The harbor offers
fine coaling and docking facilities and is
on the l:!K>" wa >' to St. Michael. There
has been a great deal of shipbuilding in
Dutrh Harbor this year for the Yukon

THE REPUBLICANS

A BIG DEMONSTRATION IS
I 810 DEMONSTRATION IS
PLANNED.
The Republican Clubs of This City
Will Close the Campaign in a
Fitting Manner.
A meeting of representatives of leading
Republican .clubs of this city was held
last evening at 405 Montgomery street,
pursuant to a call to organize and perfect
a plan for a grand torchlight parade In
honor of Gage and Neff and the State
ticket to close the campaign. ;
The meeting was large and enthusias-
Bof Gage and Neff and the State
to close the campaign,
meeting was large and enthusias
tic. Representatives from fourteen clubs
were present. It was the consensus of
opinion of those present at the meeting
that a grand pardde before the election to
fittingly close the campaign In this city
should be given. The meeting was called
to order by E. M. Galvin.
Mr. Galvin explained the objects of the
meeting, and that the Republican ticket
must win this year, and the only way to
bring out the latent strength of the party
was to call out the clubs not only of his
city but of surrounding towns. This was
done in 1896, and did more than any other
one thing to reduce a Democratic plu
rality, of 11,000 to a plurality of 400 for
McKinley.
On motion of L. J. Warren Jr. the meet
ing elected the following temporary offi
cers: Chairman, E. M. Galvin; secretary,
A. H. Burton..
The chairman appointed J. Morrison, C.
T. Caldwell and J. C. Austin a committee
on permanent organization, and the com
mittee reported in favor of the election of
the following officers: E. M. Galvin,
president; Colonel H. I. Kowalsky, first
vice president; Hon. Julius Kahn, second
vice president; Han. A. 8., Treadwell,
third vice president; secretary. Hon. A.
H. Burton; assistant secretary, John H.
Costlgan; treasurer, Hon. I. J. Truman.
After considerable discussion, the trend
of which was that the time was getting
short and the committee must get to
work, it was resolved on motion of Judge
T. F. Bachelder to proceed with the elec
tion of grand marshal for the parade.
A. de la Torre Jr. was placed in nomi
nation by Judge Bachelder for the posi
tion of grand marshal, seconded by A. H.
Burton, and there being no further nomi
nations Mr. de la Torre Jr. was elected
grand marshal of the parade by a unani
mous vote. f- . â 
The chairman was authorized to ap
point a committee of five to confer with
the Republican State Central Committee
and the county committee with regard to
the preparation for the grand demonstra
tion. It was decided to invite all Repub
lican uniformed and ununiformed clubs
of this city, as well as surrounding coun
ties to participate in the parade. Brief
speeches were made by a number of rep
resentatives of the various clubs on the
issues of the campaign.
It was decided to invite all clubs of this
city not represented at the meeting to
send their delegates to the next meeting,
to be held next Thursday night.
The meeting then adjourned with three
cheers for Gage and Neft and the entire
ticket.

ladies of the local circles of the Com

attended at the tents at the Presidi ) for
the purpose of furnishing the sick and I
convalescent EOldii rs stationed there with ,
palatable soups, t> ;is and delicacies which I
are not furnished by the Government, and
in pursuance of that object they did a
great deal of good. Last ni^ht it was re
ported that some time during the night of

tent, tioken open the trunks in which the
delicacies were kept and had stolen every
thing I'.iat could be carried away.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1898.
WINE CROP OF
1838 WILL BE
VERY SHORT
Unusual Dry Weather
the Cause.
GOOD COMES OUT OF EVIL
THE SURPLUS STOCKS WILL
BE READILY SOLD.
A Remarkable Demand in the Ne-7
Orleans Market Favorably
Affects the Situa
tion.
"The vintage of '98 will prove to be one
of the smallest in the recent history of
the State," said W. J. Hotchkiss, secre
tary of the Wine-Makers' Corporation,
which is composed of about 80 per cent of
the wine producers of California, "Our
advices Indicate that the yield of dry
wines is in the neighborhood of 8,000,
000 gallons, as against '27,000,000 last year.
Sweet wines will show about one-half the
product of last year.
"The falling off In the production Is par
ticularly marked in Santa Clara County.
"We estimate the output at 30 per cent of
last year. The decrease is due to ex
treme drought and the over-production
of last year. Usually this district is one
of the great producers. Climatic condi
tions were extremely unusual this year.
For instance, while Santa Clara has
yielded such a poor crop, owing largely to
the lack of rain, Sonoma had good treat
ment from the weather clerk, and the re
sult is a comparatively heavy yield. In
Spect to quality we feel confident that
s vintage will be one of the best that
loua old section has evef produced
the same time the crop will be onJy
about 45 per cent of that or '97.
"In the Livermore district we estlmato
the yield at about 400,000 gallons, as
against 1,500,000 last year. Napa makes a
poorer showing. This vintage aggregates
about 500,000 gallons, as compared with
about 3,000,000 in '97. Aside from the fao
noma County wine the quality, owing to
the poor development of the grapes, will
not be what was expected or desired.
That is, it will not be as full-bodied as
the average product. At the same time
its other qualities can be satisfactory.
"These facts have a great bearing on
the prospective crop of '99. The dry
weather has prevented the proper growth
of the shoots, which is necessary to the
production of a good crop next year, and
furthermore, phylloxera is now in every
district. We therefore look for a reduced
yield in '99.
"This is the dark side of the story, but
it is a ease in which good comes out of
evil. r
"The stocks of wine in the State do not
aggregate over 16,000,000 gallons, and,
while the production for the time being
is decreasing', the consumption is increas
ing largely. The proof of this statement
is shown in the New Orleans market.
Last spring wo went into that field and
made arrangements to sell direct from
producer to consumer. The result is that
whereas the average annual consumption
there was 4,000,000 gallons, the sales dur
ing the months of June, July and August
were 2.300.W0 gallons. This is an enor
mous increase, and the promise is for a
still greater demand. Incidentally it may
i be remarked that within the past few
days the prices in that market nave ad
| vanced 5 cents per gallon.
"The satisfactory feature of the situa
tion is the fact that before another large
crop can be produced and made market
able, this 16.000.000 of stock will have gone
into consumption. With the existing
growing demand prices must necessarily
advance, and good figures should be ob
tained for the 'SS crop."

poundmen laasoed his horse, and while
taking the animal away they threw it
down against the curbstone,, cutting its
back and flank .in a shocking manner. He
had the horse examined by Dr. Creely.

FONG SUEY

OF THE COURT
Notorious Procuress
Allowed to Escape.
CHINESE BUREAU TO BLAME
THEY FILED NO COMPLAINT
TO DETAIN HER.
Failed to Notify the United States
Attorney or the Court That a
Serious Charge Was
Pending.
The notorlons procuress, Fong Suey,
dealer in Chinese girl slaves, made her
escape yesterday by reason of incompe
tency or worse in the management of the
Chinese Bureau.
It is a clear cut case, and Chief Mere
dith is unable to give anything like a
satisfactory or even plausible explana
tion for his conduct in the matter.
The woman was captured in the raid by-
Federal officers last Tuesday under the
direction of Special Agents Moore and
Putnam. When the captives were taken
to the Presbyterian and Methodist mls-
Blons Miss Cameron identified Fong Suey
as the wife of Kwan Leung, former part
ner of Little Pete in the slave trade.
Several Chinese girl Inmates of the mis
sion also identified the woman as the one
who had brought them from China and
sold them to the keepers of bagnios in
this city.
Jhen these facts became known to the
era! officials they refused to release
woman upon the production of her
certificate of registration and ordered ncr
to be held in custody for prosecution on
the charge of being a procuress, the pen
alty for which offense is imprisonment in
the penitentiary for live years. The evi
dence was taken at the home by members
of the bureau, but, strange and inexpli
cable as it may appear, the chief of the
bureau neglected to inform the District
Attorney's office that he intended to pros
ecute the prisoner for that offense. He
said not a word to the United States Mar
shal, not a word to Commissioner Hea
cock. In fact, he left every door open by
which the woman might escape. The orig
inal warrant for being in the country
without a registration certificate was the
only paper that h*Md her in custody, and
the bureau chief knew that the nrodue
tion by her of her certificate of registra
tion would be all that was necessary to
procure her release.
Yesterday morning Fong Suey and
Leung Tsoy Wan were brought before
Commissioner Heacock by a Deputy
United States Marshal. No one
appeared from the Chinese Bureau or
from the District Attorney's office to
watch the case. A lawyer produced
the certificates of the two women and had
the original certificate of the procurers
brought from the Internal Revenue Office.
The Commissioner at once said that he
would recommenii their discharge.
The prisoners were taken to the Mar
shal's office and there kept until 2 o'clock
in the afternoon, awaiting the opening of
Judge de Haven's court, and the bureau
was still in ignorance of what was going
on. At tbr> hour named the report of
Commissioner Heacock was handed to
Judge de Haven and the women were im
mediately released.
When Major Moore, the Special Agent
of the treasury, who had planned th*Â» re
cent raid, heard what had hanpened he
was furious and spoke his mind regarding
the action of Chief Meredith, whose con
duct of the bureau has given rise to much
severe criticism and suspicions of wrong
doing somewhere within its sacred por
tals.
Officers were at once dispatched Into
Chinatown an hour and a half after the
release of the woman, but she had too
good a start, and they were obliged to
return empty handed. Sho is expacted to
be in court this morning.
It is expected that Major Moore will file
charges, in Washington against Meredith
for criminal negligence.

A Box of Them Sent to a Lady by an
Unknown Person.
T. J. Ford, Superintendent of Mails, re
ported to Postmaster Montague yester
day a Btrange find that he had made in
the mails. He found a small pasteboard
box in a wrapper, addressed to a lady at
5 Golden place. Under the address was
written the following: "Now will you be
good. Hope they will fit. " Try them and
see. I found these in. the alley. Think
they will do."
Mr. Ford opened the box, and a swarm
of sandhill fleas Jumped Into his shirt
bosom and made .themselves at home in
his underwear. Mr. Ford, in his report
to the Postmaster, stated that he had
withdrawn the box and contents from the
mails and destroyed them.

ANOTHER DEAL
THAT AFFECTS
WESTERN SUGAR
Spreckels Sells to Pol
litz & Co.
AFTER MUCH NEGOTIATION
HAWAIIAN COMMEBCIAL COM
PANY'S NEW MANAGEMENT.
The Old Directorate Besigns and Pol
litz and His Friends Go In,
Tin More Changes
Contempated.
One of the biggest deals of the season
was consummated yesterday when Ed
ward Pollitz 3fc Co. and their business as
sociates assumed the directorate and
business management of the Hawaiian
Commercial and Sugar Company, and
the resignations of C. A. and Rudolph
Bpreckels and the rest of the old board
of directors were announced.
The retiring directors are: C. A.
Spreckels, Rudolph Spreckels, M. H.
Hecht. Mountford Wilson and Charles S.
Wheeler. The new board is composed of
Edward Pollitz, Albert Mayer, Charles
Sutro, E. M. Walsh ana R. G. Brown.
Since the early part of the year thÂ«
members of the old board have been grad
ually diminishing their holdings of the
stock of the concern. It has been their
intention to retire from the business as
soon as the change could be effected with
out in any way Injuring the business
through throwing the management into
new and inexperienced hands.
In the meantime Mr. Pollltz and his
friends, knowing the worth and promise
of the stock, have been gradually buying
it up and now control the major portion
of it.
When asked yesterday for the reasons
that caused the general resignation, Mr.
Pollitz said: "The resignations do not
come as a surprise, for the Spreckels
brothers announced at our last annual
meeting, on the 11th of May last, that
they had been disposing of their stock
and did not desire to be re-elected to the
directorate, as they intended soon to
withdraw from the company. As we were
afraid to have the management go into
inexperienced hands we prevailed upon
them to stay, agreeing that as soon as
it could be done without jeopardizing the
interests of the company we would re
lieve them from their duties as directors.
"Since that time they and their asso
ciates have continued to dispose of their
stock, and a few days ago the last large
block came into our office for transfer
to my name and the names of my asso
ciates. From this the old board inferred
that we must now have control, and they
requested that instead of being com
pelled to wait until May 1 to resign they
be permitted to do so now. This they
did this morning in favor of my friends
and myself, rendering an election un
necessary-
"There will be no change in the work
ing force or the plans so far as I know
now. I have succeeded as temporary
manager to Mr. C. A. Spreckels, though
whether or not I shall retain that office
I have not decided."

His Preliminary Examination for As

by having a new complaint drawn up
and sworn to by Sergeant Perrin.

ceed at any time. It was decided to go
on with the preliminary examination next
Thursday. Chief Lees was in court and

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Kept. 30.â The stock market dis
played a rising tendency for a brief period to
day under the influence of higher London
prices and a moderate commission house de
mand. Support was also extended to the spe
cialties, and for the half hour succeeding the
opening prices gathered headway under the
lively bidding. This condition of affairs, how
ever, proved to be only of the flash in the pan
order, for as soon as the bears were ready to
attack they found material enough in the coun
try gossip regarding the character of the Man
hattan "L" earnings. The uncertainty exist
ing as to the nature of the contemplated imÂ»
provements and the period for their final adop
tion of the announced electrical equipments
aided the bears in their efforts and a sharp
decline occurred on heavy offerings. Frequent
feeble rallies were made, but there was nÂ»,
strong support. A drive against the rubber
stocks met with unusual success, the com
mon losing 2'* 2 and the preferred 6>4. The fact
Is that the holders of investment stocks are
pretty nervous over the operations of the bear
cliques and when a raid Is made, stop-loss or
ders come tumbling out on every half oft.
There was no definite explanation to account
for the rubber slump, but the street was ready
to advance plausible reasons. The recent ac
quisition of a rival concession apparently cul
minated an upward movement in the stock and
profit taking was a natural consequence. To
what extent this operation was carried and
whether trade developments favored a diminu
tion of holdings -can only be inferred. Rumors
that local hanking institutions had discrim
lnated against the stock as collateral 5n loans
found some credence, owing- to the rapidity
of the break. The general railway list sagged
steadily and along in the" afternoon took the
lead. Discussion of the monetary conditions
was more favorable and expectations are enter
tained that to-morrow bank's statement will
make an encouraging showing. Sugar and To
bacco commanded market attention, but there
were no developments of consequence concern
ing these properties and their price movement
was of the violent up and down order, as for
some time. Toward the close the market firm
ed up In spots and ended with a fairly stead>
tone. Final prices indicated substantial losses
In the specialties, but the railways figure for
only fraction?.
The bond market moved In an erratic manner. |
but variations were of Blight fractions, with !
Denver and Oulf Ists notably strong. Total
Bales, $2,162, 0 M. Gox-ernment bonds were press
ed for sale and the new 4s, registered, rulea
% and the 2s, registered, % lower on bid
transactions.
Total sales of stocks to-day were 383,780
shares, including: Atohlson preferred, 11.100;

NEW YORK, Sept. 30.â The Evening Post's
financial cablegram from London sas's: The
stock markets here were quiet and irregular
to-day. Argentines and Brazils contnued good.
Americans after a firm opening closed decid
edly flat on New York selling. Grand Trunk
was lower In sympathy.
Mines were easier, but there was a -sudden
Jump In De Beers on a favorable telegram con
cerning the output.
London market discount rate is 2% per cent.
The decline is mainly due to anticipation for
the release of Â£5,000,000 in Government divi
dends of October 5. The eaÂ»e may continue for
a week or two, but probably not for long.
New York to-day bought about Â£70,000 in

FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, Sept. SO.â Bradstreet's Finan
cial Review to-morrow will say: Attention has
again been centered upon the Industrial stocks,
a heavy decline in American Tobacco being the
disturbing factor in the week's speculation.
Money has ceased to be a source of anxiety,
the arrival of gold from Europe and the fact
that the treasury disbursements are once more
exceeding its receipts resulting in freer offer
ings and easier rates for some time and call
loans. While the European markets showed
symptoms of alarm over the political outlook
in France, . in China and in Egypt, London has,
nevertheless, been on the whole a buyer of
Americans, particular of the Pacific railroad
stocks. Exchange was stronger early in the
week, but though further large gold engage
ments are announced, over $600,000 specie was
taken in London during the week for American
account, and there are also rumors of gold
shipments from Australia to San Francisco.
Sugar at times rivaled Tobacco In weakness,
if not In activity, and other Industrials Bold
off to an extent which gave support to the idea
that a large, manipulative interest which has
made a bull campaign in that group had con
cluded that their speculative possibilities were
exhausted. ..
While money showed Increasing ease the se
vere decline In the leading industrial naturally
occasioned some temporary unsettling of loans.
This, as much as anything else, influenced
speculation in railroad shares and checked pub
lic activity. In fact It might be said that the
trading for the week was to an unusual de
gree professional In character. Thursday a
rally set in which checked the gradual decline,
Its progress being facilitated by the covering
of the short interest the decline had "caused
to accumulate. On Friday the market was
again unsettled and railroad shares shared in
the depression and bear attacks, the close be
ing heavy at concessions. There were, how
ever some few strong features, the most con
spicuous being Northern Pacific common and
Union Pacific, both of which were the objects
of extensive foreir" purchases.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CAJjTj, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1898.
eepung the fall ol cotton to the lowest point
for fifty years, and even the loweist prices of
IS4B, considering difference of qualities, were,
perhaps, not lower than prices this week. If
there were not on hand commercial and mill
stocks unusually large, or If manufacturing
were more successful, early recovery might
seem probable, but the heavy fall in material
has affected the demand for goods, causing
buyers to expect still lower prices for cotton.
Although there was a decline last week, good*
now average lower than ever before. While the
stagnation in wool continues and sales are
smaller than In the same month in the panic
year, 1893, numerous mills have started tempor
arily in order to get out sample pieces. There
has been no quotable decline in wool and
scarcely any in goods, the recent reduction
having stimulated a large demand.
The demand for boots and shoes seems a
little better and recorded shipments have been
larger than in September of any year, except
the last, and larger than in any other year
from January 1 to date. In the minor metals
slight weakness in tin and lead does not indi
cate smaller consumption, while copper is
strong at 12% c for lake and spelter strong at
4.32% c. Nickel is higher at 35@3Se and tin
plates unchanged, in spite of the enormous In
crease Jn production, though the desire to
push smaller works into the consolidation which
now commands 114 mills, is said to threaten
temporary decline. With pig iron firm every
where, in spite of the extraordinary output,
and Bessemer held at $10 45 at Pittgburg, while
valley producers report 330,000 tons sold for
delivery- before June next, the consumption is
evidently growing.
The week's reported contracts Include one for
17,000 tons of pipe from Basic steel by the
Standard Oil Company, material for 2000 cars
ordered by the Pennsylvania, structural work
for twelve ordinary and two large
buildings, and heavy orders for plates,
partly for two lake vessels and partly
for Eastern ship yards, which have
larger business than ever. The demand for
iron bars, owing to Increased use or steel, is
In some quarters below expectation, and ship
ments are less active at Pittsburg, though the
mills are full of orders. Rail producers are
negotiating a compact and the usual price, 918.
Is said to be shaded in some quarters while it
Is pending. But car, locomotive, bridge and
structural work is exceedingly hfcavy, and there
are no signs of decrease in the demand.
Wheat rose 2%c r but on Thursday declined
sharply, closing 2Â» lower for the week, not
withstanding very heavy exports, amounting
for the week to 4,911.022 bushels, against 5,092,
186 bushels last year, and for four week.=i to
15,011,962 bushels, against 20.661,316 last year,
flour included. The usual babel- of guesses does
not gtiange the belief that the crop will be the
largPst ever grown, and while farmers through
out the West are holding back grain largely
because ni low prices, the Western receipts are
now running above the extraordinary movement
of a year ago, both for the week and month.
Failures for the week have been 195 in the
United States, against 194 last year, and 17
In Canada, against 34 last year.
BRADSTREETS REVIEW.
NEW YORK, Sept. 30.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say: Though rather quiet conditions
were reported in a number of lines of trade
the volume of business doing the country over,
a very heavy one, is slightly smaller, so far
as bank clearings Indicate, than in September
a year ago, but comparing very favorably with
corresponding periods in all preceding years.
While the edge appears to have been tÃken
off the active demand for some time, noted in
the West and Northwest, and the imposition of
yellow fever quarantines and the low prices
of cotton In the South have hurt trade In that
section, there have been, on the other hand,
rather better reports received from the lead
ing Eastern and Middle State cities, pointing
to a fuller development of the long-expected
| fall trade. Acompanylng this slight shifting of
I activity from one section of the country to the
other has been a continued heavy export move
ment of leading cereals, unprecedented activity
in the manufacture of nearly all lines of iron
and steel and continued good reports as to
gross railway earnings, comparisons in this
respect, it being remembered, being made with
particularly favorable conditions one year ago.
Rather less pronounced strength is noticeable
in the price situation. Wheat, after quite a
heavy bulge early in the week c n undoubtedly
good export demand, foreign buying and ner
vousness of September shorts, has quieted
down slightly and prices are a few cents lower
on the week, the result mainly of lncreaeed de
liveries by farmers taking advantage of the
tempting premium existing for choice wheat.
Sympathetic weakness in other cereals is like
wise noted. Pork products are lower, partly
because of less favorable Southern advices. The
feature of the situation In iron, steel, and, in
fact, nearly all metals, Is the strength of
values, which reflects the unprecedentedly
heavy consumption now going on throughout
the country, though new business is quieter,
I pending progress making on orders already
booked. Export trade in iron and steel is re
ported feeling the effect of the advance made
in freight rates, resulting from heavy ship
ments of our cereals and other products abroad.
Wheat, Including flour, shipments for the week
aggregate 5,306,R79 bushels, against 5.024,927
bushels last' week and 5,834,246 bushels this
week one year ago.
Business failures for the third quarter of
1898, as reported to Bradstreet's. were the
smallest for at least six years paat, but be
cause of one very large failure in September the
liabilities are larger than one year ago. For
the nine months' period the total number of
failures is 8555. 10 per cent fewer than in 1597
and 21 per cent smaller than In 1896. though 19
per cent larger than in 1892. Liabilities In
volved aggregate $102,197,887, 13 per cent smaller
than in 1891, but 32 per cent larger than In
1892.
Failures In the Dominion of Canada for the
nine months number 1091. with aggregate lia
bilities of $7,592,510, a decrease of 26 per cent
In number and of 29 per cent in liabilities from
last year, and are the smallest alike in number
and liabilities Involved for any year for at
least ten years.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Sept. 30.â The opening In wheat
was at a Bhade under yesterday's closing i>rire,
December starting at 62% c. There was mod
erate liquidation -for a time, principally by
local operators, due to the lower prices and
weak markets at Liverpool and Paris and to
heavy receipts both here and In the Northwest.
Minneapolis and Duluth reported arrivals of
1266 cars, compared with 955 a week ago,' and
1096 last year. Chicago receipts were 280 cars,
33 of which were of contract grade. Outside of
this, however, there was nothing in the news
to encourage selling, and after the first flurry
of liquidation had passed, prices began to
mend, December recovering to 62%@63c, from
C2%i3<62%c, to which point It had declined
shortly after the opening. There was some
Incentive to buying In the news which came
In from the seaboard. Later cables from Ltv
erpool showed a partial recovery from the
early decline. New York reported that yes
terday's export sales would amount to nearly
one and a quarter million bushels. Outside
markets as a rule were slightly easier, b"ut
none showed weakness, Duluth quotations be
ing, In fact, a little higher. Argentine shipped
no wheat this week.
Trading became excessively dull, and con
sisted mostly of evening up transactions, many
of the active traders departing for Omaha to
night for the exposition. After noon the market
developed genuine weakness, partly on account
of dispatches from Liverpool confirming reports
of heavy Russian offerings. This caused al
most total disappearance of the languid support
the market had been receiving, but did not
cause much increase In selling. OutHlde mar
kets all closed considerably lower for cash
wheat. A visible Increase of from 750,000 to
1,000,000 bushels was looked for. Atlantic port
clearances of wheat and flour amounted to 706.
000 bushels. The market was at Its weakest
near the close, closing at about %c down.
Corn opened weak at a fractional decline, but
soon recovered, and for the rest of the ses
sion changed very little.
Oats were dull but steady.
Provisions were firm on small amount of
trading.

II COUNTER
CHARGES MAT
BE DROPPED
Rev. Lamar May Not
Be Tried at AH.
DR. BRIGGS' DEFENSE BEGUN
THIRD DAY OF M. E. CHURCH
SOUTH CONFERENCE.
Two Applicants Appear for Deacon's
â Ministers Report on
Their Different
Charges.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
. '.'.' 90S Broadway, Sept. 30. ,
It was stated this afternoon by the
knowing ones that the counter charges
brought up against Rev. Mr. Umar at the
Pacific Coast conference of the Metho
dist Episcopal Church South, the third
day's, session of which was held to-day,
â will come to naught. And the secret
triai-of Rev. Dr. Briggs Was to be rushed
as last as discretion will- permit, because
one of the thirteen jurors is anxious to
leave on account of sickness in his lam
ily. ;-..-.
At this mornl#fe's session of the confer
ence Bishop Hendrix presiding, the re
ports of the different ministers in re
gard- to their churches were heard, and
most of the preachers reported the
finances of their charges to be somewhat
depleted. .. -
J. D. F. Houck and W. A. Lindsey came
before -the bar of the conference to re
ceive their preliminary charge from the
Bishop before ordination as deacons.
which 'will- follow next Sunday after,
fasting and prayer. 1 In charging appli
cants Bishop Hendrix pointed out the
fact that a fallen minister scatters his
discouraged flock to the four winds, un
doing the work of other pastors before
him for years. He admonished them to
keep from mental lethargy and to take
special care in the training of the chil
dren of their pastorates.
During the session Bishop Hendrix read
a notice from Rev. Mr. Carpenter asking
that certain of the brethren, whose names
he read, be within easy call during the
afternoon. The.-- were presumably the
names of witnesses for the defense in the
Dr. Brlggs trial, which was . resumed to
night. â¢â â 'â¢S'-y^-ih
Bishop Hendrix also announced that
Dr. J. C. Simmons would preside over
the conference to-morrow morning In his
stead. This is regarded as an indication
that the trial of Rev. Mr. Briggs will
occupy an all-night session and part of
the morning, the purpose being to con
clude the .trial .without any further de
lays and so as to permit the juror men
tioned to return to his family. The con
ference, however, will not adjourn prob
ably until Monday afternoon. ;-* â¢â â =. â â â :.
Dr.' H. M. Dub..-.-, secretary of the Ep
worth League and editor of the Epworth
Era. delivered the ' annual address to
night before the Foreign Missionary So
ciety, and during the afternoon the Home
Mission held another session. To-morrow
the various committees will make their
final reports, and in the evening- the Sun
day-school board will hold its anniver
sary. m . __

ment, and since it has been at the health

THE ELECTRIC WIRE TRAGEDY.
Coroner's Jury Finds That It Was the
Result of Criminal Carelessness.
ALAMEDA, Sept. :w.â A Coroner's jury
to-day Investigated the cause of deatn of
Mrs. Martin Davoust of 1242 Pearl street,
who met an awful death by coming in
contact with a live electric wire dangling
from a pole.
City Electrician Wlese was the principal
witness and a cautious one. He stated
that be went to the scene of the affair
and found the live wire was one that had
been used as a guy rope from the electric
light pole to a telephone pole across the
street He Paid that the deadly current
In the wire might have come from some
other source than the city wires. "It
might have come from a wire a mile
away."
In reply to a direct question, "Wiese said
that the wire was made "live" by dan
gling against the electric light wires on
the same pole. Incidentally, he stated tnat
the indicator at the works did not show
that any wire had been grounded at me
time of the accident.
The fact appeared that the fatal wire
had been used as a guy a long while ago,
but had broken, and some one had coiled
it up and hung it on the electric light pole..
It had fallen from its support and swayed
to and fro. rubbing against one of the
electric light wires, and thus became
charged.
The jury returned a verdict reciting the
facts and declaring that "death was
caused by shock. belnÂ£ entangled and
burned by an electric light wire attacned
to a pole belonging to the city of Ala
meda; and we do further find that some
party unknown to the jury has been
guilty of criminal negligence in allowing
a dangerous wire to exist in a position
dangerous to life and limb."
Whether a suit against the city will fol
low is not known, but it ts the opinion of
thus.' conv< rsant with the facts that the
husband of the dead woman has a good
case.

TRAGEDY IN THE KLONDIKE
ISAAC MARTIN Reported to Have Been
flurdered for His Fortune in Alaska.
t-n ELATI V JKS ami friends of Isaac Martin, the Alaskan trader whose
I J terrible death was announced in the dispatches from the Klondike
1 region on Monday last, were shocked by the news. They are still
-I- v hopeful, however, that the body found on the trail by returning
gold-seekers may prove to be that of some one other than Mr. Martin.
They hope that he will soon put in
an appearance, and end their sus
pense. This hope is based on the com
plete knowledge of the country they
knew him to have possessed, due to
his long residence there, and on the
fact that his brother Dave, who is
now in Juneau, will surely discover his
whereabouts.
The diepatch stated that Martin had
been found with his throat cut and
that $4000 he was known to have had
with him was missing. The crime, if
tht-re was one, has been charged to
native Indians, but his relatives
affirni that the charge is unfounded,
as the missing man was known and
loved by them. They cite as an in
stance of their affection that when
Martin was dangerously ill they cared
for him in their crude way. If he has
been murdered it is chargeable to the
rough element that has gone into the
anow-covered land.
Mr. Martin has earned some fame In
the land of the midnight sun through
his partnership with "Jim" Dalton,
well-known in those regions. He aided
the latter to cut the long and now use
ful trail that bears Dalton's name and
â â â iittii in other pioneer work. â 
The supposedly dead man entered
the barren country with his father
when sixteen years of age. He would
now be thirty-thrve years old and dur
ing his long residence in the north haa

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 1, 189 S.
JUDGE OGDEN
LONGS FOR A
WHIPPING POST
Thinks It Would Fit
the Kleupfer Case.
FEARFUL TALE OF CRUELTY
MOTHER AND CHILDREN IN
FEAR OF DEATH.
Attempts to Kill Are Freely Re
called by Witnesses
in the Divorce
Suit.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Sept. 30.
After twenty years of terror, Mrs. Lucy
S. Kleupfer is free. She was granted a
divorce by Judge Ogden this afternoon.
Never has a story of an 111-treated wife
told in an Alameda court contained so
many alarming- features as that related
by Mrs. Kleupfer. For many years the
mother and her live children have been
subjected to Indignities, harsh treatment,
beatings and cursings. Knives,-pitch
forks and bricks have been the weapons
with which Kleupfer has shown his un
governable temper toward his family, and
all the time he has been gradually losing
his fortune by gambling in the Stock Ex
change.
About six years ago Mrs. Kleupfer toid
j her husband he should be ashamed of
himself for so cruelly ill treating- their j
; child. This caused him to break loose,
! and he clubbed and beat his wife so brut
i ally that she has been a nervous and
: physical wreck ever since and has refused
to live with him.
Kleupfer's fearful tempir used to mani
i fest itself in a variety or ways. On one
! occasion, wanting to show his anger, he !
j went into the yard and butted a board off j
i a fence with his head. Once again he !
i was prevented from beating his children, i
| so he went into the garden and beat a !
! chicken to death. At other times he has j
! vented his spite on a pig or a calf. Kleup- j
i fer once drove his daughter out of the
hoilse, then took a gun and threatened to
kill her, and finally wound up by taking
a chair and breaking every bit of crockery
in the house. He was next observed chaw- i
: ing his daughter over the farm with
I stones in each hand, shouting that he
: would take her life, and was only pre- i
I vented from doing something desperate '
! by Frank Garcia, one of the hired men. i
Some of the children testified that they i
believed their father was still intent on !
killing their mother, and they are afraid â 
of him.
Wht-n the case was called this afternoon
I neither Kleupfer nor his attorney was
present, and Judge Ogden awarded a de
cree to Mrs. Kieupfer. .
"There ought to be a whipping post." ;
t paid the court, "for a man who beats his i
! wife. Such a man is naturally a coward.
and a coward fears such punishment."
TO PROMOTE VAUDEVILLE.
Harry Jackson, the Alhambra's New
Manager, Arrives From. New
York.
"Harry" Jackson hns come out from
the E.-jPt to take upon his shoulders the
management of the Alhumbra Theater,
and though he arrived but last night he
has already entered upon the many du
ties of his new position.
Mr. Jackson is by no means unknown
to old San Franciscans. He is a pioneer
of the coast in matters theatrical, and
a short chat with him lust evening re
called former times to his many friends.
Said he:
"I started my career in the profession
in 1836 as a child actor at Mag-uire's old
theater in this city. My father was at
that time stage mannger and come
dian th. â !â¢(=â¢. Since that time I-have trav
eled all over Europe, and it was in Eng
land that I managed my tirst company.
At the agp of 16 I took out an organ
ization from the Princess Theater there,
and since that time have been constantly
in the business. I was also representative
for the late Charles Reade, who was a
partner of my father, until in 18S2 when
I took the stage for the late John Stetson
of New York, and afterward handled
many road companies."
When the vaudeville field was opened
Mr. Jackson saw the possibilities, and at
once entered the field and became con
nected with some of the most successful
theaters in the East, and has devoted
himself to the task of finding out what
the public require, both behind and in
front of the curtain.
Manager Jackson's many friends
throughout the profession in every branch
are delighted to know that he has se
cured the management of the Alhambra,
and predict a great success for the house
under his generalshljk.
There are thousands of people in the
city who remember both Harry Jackson
and his late father, and many are calling
at the- Alhambra to bid a hearty welcome
to the manager, who as a boy entertained
them, but none can appreciate the pleas
ure Manager Jackson feels at being able
to locate in the city where he first viewed
the footlights.
Mr. Jackson says there is plenty of tal
ent to be secured, and that San Francisco
can support his theater. Therefore he
does not come into the field in opposi
tion to any one, but merely to cater to
the taste of the public, which he believes
runs to vaudeville, and will for many
seasons to come.
IS AGAINST IMPERIALISM.
David Starr Jordan Repeats His Cele-
brated Lecture on the Lessons
of the War.
We should give the people of the Phil
ippines a chance to take care of them
selves. Lend them Dewey and our army
and send them men higrh in all the pro
fessions of art, industry and learning to
educate them. The sensible thing for
our Government to do, however, is to pull
out some dark night when nobody is
looking, get out as suddenly as we g<U
Into this matter of the Philippines."
This was the summing up of the ques
tion of territorial expansion, so generally
discussed by Americans since the close
of the war, that David Starr Jordan
made in a lecture last night.
The distinguished educator chose for
his text the line from Kipling's master
piece, "The Recessional": "Lest we tor
get." This is the second time within a
fortnight that he has delivered the lec
ture here. HJs broad grasp of the pres
ent situation in this country will appar
ently bear many repetitions, judged by
the appreciative applause which marked
the progress of his lecture.
The trend of his remarks was against
imperialism, against the acquisition of
territory which the United States could
never govern properly under its consti
tution which has served so well on this
continent.
He said the majority of the inhabitants
of the Philippine Islands. never heard of
Spain, nor of the United States, and do
not know that there has been a War. To
show how hard the people of the islands
in the Pacific and to civilize he repeated
what he termed "one of the relati\Hy
few true things" Ingerjjoll has said: "If
you placed a shipload of New England
preachers married to schoolmarms on one
of those islands the third generation
would be riding bareback to cockfights on
Sundays."
The lecture was given under the patron
age of the educational' department of
Young Men's Christian Association in the
Association Auditorium, which was
thronged.

A LADIES' NIGHT.
Given by San Francisco Camp of the
Woodmen of the World in Mis-
sion Masonic Temple.
San Francisco Camp of the Woodmen
of the *>Vorld gave a ladles' night last
evening 'n the banquet hall of the Mission
Masonic Temple, and there was an at
tendance of members and their lady rela
tives and lady friends that filled the hu.ll

programme there was dancing until mid
night.
THE PARISH FAIR POPULAR.
Music, Games and Sociability Afford
Pleasing Entertainment.
Thp third day of the St. Patrick's par
ish bazaar was fully as great a success
In every respect as have boon tho two
previous days. Yesterday the prettily
decorated basement of St. Patrick's
Church on Mission street was thronged
jind business in the booths went on with
a swing.
The tables at the lunch hour were well
filled, though they did not attract BO
much attention that the whirr of the
wheel of fortune on its lively rounds, nor
the snap of the rifles in the shooting gal
lery, were stopped for a minute.
T"he evening's programme was well se
leot<-d and cleverly carried out. To-night
additional interest will be added to the
programme, as Father Brannan proposes
to speak to those present upon the live
topics of the day, and Father Brannan
is always an interesting talker.

NARROWLY ESCAPED DESTRUCTION.
The Steamep Santa Rosa as She Appeared Jlfcer the Derelict Raft Jiad Scpaped Jllong
.Hep Port Side.
OVER two hundred people escaped a watery grave by
a hair's breadth yesterday morning-. Had it not been
for the fact that the man on the lookout had once
before been in a similar predicament and recognized
the peril," nothing could have averted the disaster.
When six miles west-northwest of Pigeon Point, the
steamer Santa Rosa almost ran at full speed Into a raft
of logs. The vessels course was only changed in time for
the raft to scrape along her p>.rt side and carry away the
patent log which was over hi>r stern.
The Santa Rosa was bound from San Diego, via Port
Angeles and Santa Barbara. She had aboard 103 first
class, 12 second-class passengers and a crew of S7 all told.
The raft was very low in the water and had the steamer
struck it her bottom would have been torn out ana not
one of the 202 souls aboard would have lived to tell the
tale.
The raft, which has become such a menace to naviga
tion, left Astoria In tow of the steamer Progreso on the
Ifuh Inst. At the same time a raft of sawn lumber left in
toy.- of the tugs M"::arch and Rescue. Hoth ventures were
failures. The pile raft was in trouble from the start. Part
of it broke away off Cape Mendocino, and when off Point
Reyes the Progreso lost the remainder and came into port
on the 2Sth inst., dragging sixty tons of chain, used In tOW
ing the logs. The other raft also broke up and a small
portion of it reached port > .sterday in tow of the Re
WL.-n the news that the Progreso had lost her tow was
made public, the steamer Humboldt went out to try
and pick it up. She came back without it on Thursday
night. The northwest wind and the strong current had
taken charge and yesterday morning the raft was off
Pigeon Point right in the track of the Santa Rosa.
At the time, Third Officer Reed was in charge of the
Santa Rosa and Quartermaster Fred Peterson was on the
lookout.
"I was scared, and I had reason to be," said Peterson
yesteray. "I was on the vessel that ran into a derelict
raft on the Atlantic, and that experience was enough for
me. The raft was being towed from Montreal to New
Tork and broke adrift. Unfortunately, our vessel ran into
it and you can imagine the rest. Had It been our previous
voyage on the Santa Rosa, nothing on earth could have

MANY SALES NEGOTIATED
BUILDING OPERATIONS ARE
STEADILY INCREASING.
A Complete Synopsis of the Records,
Recent Sales, New Building
Contracts â Other
Notes.
The condition of the real estate market
for the past week has been encouraging
to both property-owners and realty brok
ers. The uncertainty which characterized
Its progress, owing to the existent
as to whether the new tax levy would
tend toward precipitating it into that con
dition of business stagnation from which
it so lately evolved, has been entirely
forgotten. As a consequence, there seems
absolutely nothing to deter the "stream
of realty" from seeking and maintaining
a well-defined and successful course of
prosperity and progress.
Sales for the week, although Individual
ly of but comparatively small value, were,
â  nevertheless, of a considerable number
and a good aggregate value. Many firms
throughout the city recorded a largo
number of successful negotiations and
disposals, which fact alone shows con
clusively that the prospect of the market
for the near future i 3 both bright and
encouraging.
Building operations arp still increasing.
The record for the past week shows a
marked improvement and increase both
in number and extent over the record of
the preceding week.
REVIEW OF THE RECORDS.
During the week there were fifty-nine mort
gages and trust deeds recorded, amounting to
1175, 655. For the same period forty-eight re
leases and reconveyances passed to record In
the total sum of $191,399.
The principal mortgages and trust deeds re
corded are as follows: By the Hibernla Sav
ings and Loan (Society to Ellen S., Hugh 3.
and Dennis S. Diamond, $12,000 for one year

west 137:6 by south 127:S\i, the southerly line
of Sacramento, 137:6 east of Larkin, east
by south 137:6, and tho easterly line of Capp,
saved us. On that occasion it was very foggy and we
could not Bee a hundred feet from the ship, but on this
occasion it was a bright moonlight night.
"W< U, 1 v. on the l">kout. and, the moon being full,
I could see quite a, distance. I noticed something black
on the water and set it down for kelp, as there is a
good deal <â¢{ that stuff met with at Pigeon Point. We
were racing toward it and it seemed to be coming to meet
us. Then I thought it was a dead whale. Suddenly I re
membered reading about the raft having broken up and
it flashed on me at once that we were rusnlng on a por
tion of it.
"I took another look and ran aft yelling, 'a derelict
raft ahead, hard a port!' The third mate came out of the
el .r: house and took a look ahead and then stopped the
vessel and called, 'Hard a port!' to the helmsman, and
then T heard him say, 'Jam her over.' The next minute
that rpass of logs was bobbing along and scraping our
port side: Yes, i was a bit scared."
"I had just come out Of the captain's cabin, where the
'old man' had been giving me the new course, when I heard
kout cry out, "A derelict raft dead ahead!'" said.
Mate Reed, when asked abuu the matter. "I walked to the
side of the ship and saw the thing bearing right down on
us. I at once reversed the engines and put the helm hard
a port. When the rnft had scraped its way along to our
port quarter, I put the helhi hard a starboard so as to try
and save our propeller blades. The raft caught our patent
log which was over the stern find carried it away."
"When I heard the engines stopped I lost ho time In
getting on deck, I can tell you," said. Captain Alexander.
"The ship was beginning to pay off and I saw that the
worst we would pet would be: a bumping. Luckily, the
ship was light and the wind was on the. port bow, so she
came around like a top. Had the conditions been reversed
I don't think I -would' be here to tell the tale. It was with
out exception the most marvelous escape I have ever
heard of. A week ago the steamer was heavily laden and
It -was as thick as mush. This morning we "were flying
light and it was as bright as day almost. But even with
all that in our favor we might all have gone to Davy
Jones' locker had it not been for the lookout's former
experience with a derelict raft." â 
Of the 115 passengers who came up on the Santa Rosa
there Is probably not one who will know Of his or her nar
row escape until this article is read.

Health and Police Committee Decide
Against Abrogating It.
The Committee on Health and Police
of the Board of Supervisors, met yester
day and considered the petition of forty
firms doing business in the city, for a
repeal of the ilfty-year franchise for col
lecting garbage awarded to F. E. Sharon
in 18%, and subsequently assigned by him
to the Sanitary Reduction Works. The
petitioners held that Sharon received too
many privileges. The committee thought
differently and decided to report adverse
ly to the petitioner's request, giving, as
a reason, that there was no powser vested
in the Supervisors to abrogate the con
tract, as its provisions had not been vlo
latod by the contractor.
The committee also decided to postpone
for one week action upon the petition to
extend the pound limits so as to Include
the greater part of South San Francisco,
which, it is claimed, is overrun with goats.

The O. and O. Company's steamer Gaelic
arrived from Hongkong via Yokohama
and Honolulu yesterday with fifty-eight
cabin and 267 Chinese passengers yeaterv.
day. She brings word that the United
States steamer Raleigh had just come ort
the drydock at Hongkong the day she
sailed and that the cruiser Olympia was
preparing to take her place. The sailors
of the warships, who had not enjoyed
shore leave for five months, were making
things lively in Hongkong in a good
natured way. The transport Zealandia was
still on the drydock at Nagasaki, and it
was unofficially reported that her. repairs
would occupy another month. â  The trans
port Senator was at Honolulu, having put
in there for coal, and the Indiana was at
Nagasaki. â¢ :
The British bark Heathfield, from
Shanghai for Tacpma, had to put into
Yokohama In distress while the Gaelic
was there. She was caught in the typhoon
that damaged .the Zealandta* and very
nearly went to' the bottom. She was on
her beam ends, with the main yard buried
in the water, and the topsail yardarms
were frequently washed by the waves lor
nearly twenty-four hours. When the
I ballast shifted. Mate Grant and Seaman
i Kelly were burled under it, and marly
killed. The stanchions in the wake of tne
main hatch were bent and broken, a spare
spar and the two lee lifeboats were
washed away, the starboard bulwarks
from the fore rigging to poop were started
and most of the stanchions and dog
shores were carried away. Twelve planks
were ripped up from the deck, the gi^ was
smashed, the skids carried away and the
forecastle door was washed overboard.
It will be many a day before the Heath
field reaches Tacoma.
The steamer Leelanaw arrived from St.
Michael yes.terday via the Pribyloff
Islands. She brought down a full pas
senger list and a very valuable cargo. In
fact, not one of the treasure ships has
made as good a showing. Besides the
treasure from the Klondike, she brought
down 18,032 seal skins, 655 fox skins and 25
other skins from St. Paul and St. George
Island. These will mount up Into big
figures, and will materially swell the Lee
lanaw's record. Among those who came
down on her were: J. C. Kedpath, the
North American Company's agf-nt at fc>i.
Paul Island, and J. Stanley Brown, the
company's general agent. T. P. H. White
law and the men who went up with him
on the Sintram to build the company's i
river steamers and barges also came \
down. There was a great deal of grum
bling and much trouble when the com
pany of boatbuilders first arrived at
Dutch Harbor, but things were finally
straightened out and there was no fric
tion toward the end.
J. W. Ivy, Collector of Customs for
Alaska, came down from St. Michael. He
reports that all the river steamers had
started for Dawson but that none of them
expect to get farther than Rampart, where
they will winter. There is plenty of pro
visions on the river, Mr. Ivy says, and
there will be no starvation. There are
lota of people at St. Michael anxious to
get back to San Francisco, but they have
no money, and they will have a hard time
of it if they have to stay up there all
winter.
The Leeelanaw is to have all her deck
houses and "gingerbread work" taken off
and she will go into the Seattle coal trade.
The steamer Alviwo nearly broke her
back In the Alviso slough last Thursday
night. She was on her way to San Fran
cisco, when she got across the slough by
some unaccountable means and stuck
fast. The opposition steamer. F. M.
Smith, came along shortly afterward, and
in order to get out herself nad topull the
Alviso out of her tight place. The tide
was running out at the time, and had tne
Alviso been left with her bow on one
bank and her stern wheel on the other
her back would have been broken when
the water left her high and dry.
The lighthouse that guides the Oakland
ferry-boats into their slips at the new
depot was on fire Thursday night. A
crossed electric wire started the blaze.
The services of the fire tug Governor Ir
win were called In. and the water tower
on her was used for the first time. It
proved most effective, and put the tire
out in a few minutes.
THEY ARE OUT FOR
THE PULLMAN SCALP
THE RAILROAD COMMISSIONERS
ARE PROBING.
An Accounting Is Made by Colonel
Polk of the Condition of the
Affairs of the Com
pany.
The Railroad Commissioners are begin
ning their work upon the Pullman Palace
Car Company. TJie expert accountant,
Colonel Polk, who is employed by thÂ£
commission, has made an examination
Into the affairs of the Pullman Company
and the most startling disclosures have
resulted. It is safe to say that the re
turns of the Pullman Company exceed
those of any railroad corporation in the
country- The commission will attempt
to bring about a reduction of rates, and
the Commissioners will use the report of
Mr. Polk as a basis of operations.
The examination of Colonel Polk shows
that the capital stock of the company is
estimated at J36.000.000. The statement for
the fiscal year ending July 31. 1898. is as
follows: Gross earnings. $8,074^1 21; op
erating expenses, $3,5H.56S 62, leaving as
net receipts from operating $5,403,019 59.
Other expenses figure up $512.16.) 15. mak
ing the net earnings $4,650,850 44. A divi
dend of 8 per cent was paid, whlcii in the
aggregate amounted to $2,880,000, leaving
a surplus of $1,770,850 44.
The income from the surplus account
on July 31 amounted to $25,247,648 34. When
it is considered that the company started
with an original capitalization in 1867 of
$100,000, the enormous and unnatural prof
its of the company will readily be seen.

Three rolice officers and Prosecuting
Attorney Graham of Judge Joaehimsen's
court are after the scalp of Policeman
Nell Reardon, and he will have to face
the Police Commissioners and explain
why he made charges against them In a
statement to Captain Gillen. :
The trouble lias arisen over the arrest
of Robert Smith, a boy living in the Mis
sion, on a charge of robbing Chew Suey,
a Chinese, on June 18 last. A complaint
was sworn to by the Chinese on June 20,
charging Smith and three other boys with
the robbery. The other three were arrest
ed and discharged, as the Chinese could
not Identify them, but Smith left the city.
He returned last Sunday and was arrested
by Reardon.
When the case was called In Judge
Low's court on Wednesday the complaint
could not be found, and Reardon made a
statement to .Lieutenant Price and later
a written statement to Captain Glllen that
Smith had told him that the case had
been "fixed," as the complaint and war
rant had been destroyed and his friends
had written him to come back to the city,
as everything was fixed. Reardon added
that the complaint had been taken from
Judge Low's court by Prosecuting Attor
ney Graham and Detectives Fitzgerald
and Graham of the Mission district and
destroyed, and tnat $10u had been divided
among the three for the job. Smith's
parents having mortgaged their home to
get the money. Reardon also told Judge
Low the same story last Wednesday.
f Lees Thursday morning started j
an Investigation, and after a diltj/ent ,
search the complaint was found in Clerk
li;ii;kins' desk in Judge Low's court. It
had bit n overlooked from the fact that
the clerk had omitted to fill in the blanks
on the back. The warrant was also found
at the Seventeenth street police station.
Prosecuting Attorney Graham had ab
solutely nothing to do with the case, as
it was not in his court, and he was
amazed when he learifod of Reardon's
charge against him. He at once saw
Chief Lees and preferred charges against
Reardon. Detectives Fitzgerald and Gra
ham also indignantly denied receiving any
money in connection wtih the case, and
demanded a full investigation before the
Commissioners. Policeman George Tracey
ha? also demanded an investigation, as
Reardon stated that he had talked with
Smith before MB arrest by Reardon and
neplectfd his duty by not placing the boy
under arrest.
Smith's preliminary examination was
commenced in Judge Low's court yester
day afternoon, and Reardon under oath
repeated the story that Smith, he said,
had tola him about the case being "fixed"
and the complaint and warrant being de-
Btroyed, all of which is denied by Smith.
He also testified that Smith's stepmother
had accosted hi*" outside the courtrooom
or. Wednesday and cautioned him not to
testify against the boy. otherwise he
would get into trouble, as the boy had
lots of friends. Smith's attorney alleged
that Heard on- s statement? from begin
ning to end "v re pure, inventions of his
own brain. The Judge paid that was a \
matter for the Police Commissioners to j
Investigate.

The question as to whether the confes-

LEE JOHNSON, the popular sang

his complaint has been rightly diag
nosed. He is palpably smitten, and
he has a wife â features of the case
which speak for themselves. John

La Rue down with a righthand body blow
TWe^event of the evening ended rather
unfavorably for the talent, who had wa
gered on Stelzner. who sold .a favorite at
110 to $7 in the pools.
Kennedy "put up" a very pood argy
ment for a green 'un, and with a little
training under a drilled boxer should
prove a hard game for any of the present
aspirants to heavy-weight i onors. One
of his greatest drawbacks i:-. a "thump
ing left foot," which invariably announces
the coining of a lefthand lead or swing.
Each time that Kennedy tried a left
swing at Stelzner' s jaw down went that
powerful left foot on the carnet and out
shot the glove just in time to fall short
by quite a distance of the spot on which
For ten rounds the Kennedy-Stelzner
bout was nbout evenly contested, but
from the tenth to the seventeenth round
Kennedy had the better of the argument,
keeping Stelzner repeatedly on the re
treat and occasionally landing a hard
left swing on StÂ«laner's cauliflower ear.
Btelzner's only effective blow was a right
in the short ribs, which was always fol
lowed by a clinch. Each time that Stelz
ner planted a straight left on Kennedys
nose he anticipated trouble, as the re
ceiver of the glove waxed angry and
! made -wild and dangerous Bwings at Stelz
i r.er's head, any of which blow? would
j have had serious effect had not the box
ing partner of Champion Fltzsimmons
! danced out of the way of danger.
Stelzner scored first blood in the eighth
round by landing a hard left on Ken
nedy's nose.
In the fourteenth round Strlzner clev
erly avoided by quick rtu<-klog three
wicked swings that were intended for his
iaw and just as the gong sounded he fell
in his corner to avoid trouble. In the fif
teenth Stelzner got ?om<- hard punches
in neck and body which compelled him to
dance quickly around the ring. In the
sixteenth there was considerable clinch
ing but according to rule the referee had
no business to go between the contest
ants notwithstanding that the stupids In
the gallery w< re anxious that he sepa
rate the contestants.
Tn the nineteenth round Stelzner fell
three times, twice without any good rea
son for going down. In the twentieth
both men tried hard to land a knock-out
blow, but failed. Kennedy got the de
i cision.

cinating Mabel conquered.
Since that eventful day Johnson has
suffered intensely and continuously.
The "two-week" period was reached,
but the disease stubbornly refused to
yield to all supposedly successful rem
edies, and the composer, in the throes
of a delirious fever, dashed off a song,
"The Belle of Honolulu," In which he
gave the secret of his passion to the
world in indicting this, his latest
brain child, to Miss Mabel Bowman.

DEATH OF A PROMINENT BUTCHER.
Mark Strouse, Proprietor of the Bay City Market,
Succumbs to La Grippe.
MARK STROUSE, the well-known butcher and proprietor of the Bay
City Market, died at his residence, 2412 Pacific avenue, yesterday.
Ills death was not sudden, he having contracted la grippe two
weeks ago while selecting meat among the refrigerators, He was
at work in his establishment when the attack came on, and physicians
were immediately sent for. Mr. Strouse was orders 1 to his bed, and Dr.
Prossek, his family physician, and Dr. Miller were called in to attend
him. Despite their ministrations, their patient did not survive the attack.
Mr Strouse was a native of Germany and 53 years old. For the past
nineteen years he has personally looked after his immense interests. It
was his wont to leave his house at 4 o'clock each morning and drive to
his place of business. There he set an example to his assistants by doff
ing his coat and cutting up the meat to be disposed of during the day.
At 9 o'clock he visited the refrigerators and ordered meat for the follow
ing day. and would then continue laboring over accounts and sales until
nearly midnight. Being of a rooust constitution, the work did not cause
him any inconvenience.
The deceased was popular among his associates in business, and his
death will be deeply felt. He leaves a widow and three childrenâ Mrs.
William A. Hewitt and Albert and Mark Strouse. He was a member of
various fraternal organizations, and will be buried under t"he auspices
of South San Francisco Lodge No. 212, F and A. M. The funeral set vices
will be held in Masonic Temple to-morrow at 1:30 p. m., and he will be in
terred in the I. O. O. F. Cemetery.

HEWITT'S PLAN
FOR LIGHTING
MARKET STREET
Also a Franchise for
Trolley Cars.
NO EXPENSE TO THE CITY
WOULD ERECT ORNAMENTAL
IRON COLUMNS.
These Wouid Support Trolleys and
Free Electric Lights, Also Fur
nish Refuges for
Pedestrians.

"San Francisco can have one of the
most beautiful avenues in the world if
the proper steps are taken at this time,"
remarked Superintendent Hewitt of the
Fire Alarm and Police Telegraph yester
day. "And what is more the improvement
that I have in view need not cost the city
a cent. My idea is that Market street
when bituminized, can be transformed
Into a magnificent boulevard, made es
pecially attractive at night by brilliant
ly Illuminating it with electric light tow
ers running down the center of the thor
oughfare. Here Is the plan:
"I would make a proposition to the
Market Street Railroad Company to per
mit it to change the present cable system
to an overheard trolley one, provided
that it would, in consideration of the
concession, erect ornamental iron columns
with outreaching arms, to support the
trolley wires, and higher up two smaller
ORNAMENTAL IRON COLUMN.

arms, to each of which would be fas.
tenec 1 " arc light. These columns, or
Buppi be placed 146 feet apart
in t' i. t;r of the street, between the
I car jatKs, wh-ere there is very little ve
j hide travel, ample space existing on the
I outer portions of the street. At the base
I of each column there: would be a small
| platform five feet square, raised live
I inches above the level of the street. This
platform would be a sort of station, or
refuge, for pedestrians crossing. The
vast number of vehicles and street cars
which now use Market street make it
very difficult at all times for persons on
foot to cross from one curb to the other.
The width of the thoroughfare is so great
that it takes considerable agility to dodge
across among the vehicles. After the
bitumen is down on the entire street the
crush of travel will be redoubled and the
dilttculties and dangers to pedestrians
proportionately Increased. What, then,
could be nicer than a refuge station at
the base of an iron column every 145 feet?
The slightly raised platform would pre
vent vehicles from crossing it. Persons
could stand there in security and wait
their chance to continue acro#s the street
or board cars when they chose to do so.
"The two arc lights at the top of each
column, on the smaller arms, would be
furnished by the street car company and
kept burning all n!;:ht free of charge to
the city. This would, in fact, represent
the price of the concession. The extra
expense to the company would not be ex
cessive, inasmuch as It would have its
own electric plant, while San Francisco
would secure one of the most attractive
boulevards in the world. Just imagine
rand effect that would be produced
by the two continuous lines of electric
air lamps gleaming the whole length of
the street. Night would be transformed
into day. Market street would become
an avenue more popular in the evening
than it is now in the day time. As a
fn-omenado it would be without a peer
n the country. Carriages would throng
upon it. Last, but not least, business In
the stores w< iM be increased 50 per cent,
and all at no cosi to the taxpayers. I
believe thai the Market Street Company
would consent to the scheme for the sake
of getting their expensive cables re
moved and the more economical trolley
system substituted. The citizens would
gain by the change as much, or more,
than the company. Why not suggest the
plan? Personally. lam in favor of bury
ing electric wires in most cases, but here
is one where the city would be really
improved in appearance by putting wires
up. There would bo but two wires, and
the ornamental iron columns would add
to the beauty of the bituminized street
rather than detract from it. Here is a
sketch of the iron supports as 1 would
have them made."
"Would you seek to bury all other wires
along the street?'" was asked.
"Yes, but not immediately. It costs
money to bury telephone and telegraph
wires, electric tight wires and the like.
In fact, the expense is very heavy. I
would, therefore, give the various com
panies a littie time in which to effect the
change, say live yean, obliging them to
do a part of the work each year. In the
outlying districts, where there are not so
many wires as in the downtown districts,
they could all be ordered underground
within a year. But it Is best to give more
time In tne business sections. The city
does not want to be unreasonable. As
far as Market street is concerned, 1 would
favor placing wires in. two conduits, one
along the outer edge of each sidewalk.
The conduits could be easily reached
without tearing up the street. There is
plenty of space along the odge of the
waiks for such conduits.
"One more point* With thp wires buried
along both sides of Market street and
only the tall, ornamental iron columns in
the center the entire appearance of the'
street will not only be transformed but
the dangers arising from fires will be
greatly reduced. The present network
of wires makes it hard to use any appa
ratus at fires, especially ladders. "When
the wires are once buried they will require
but little attention, lasting in their insu
lated coverings for years.
"You can present this plan for improv
ing Market street with my expressed
judgment that it ought to be tried. I will
fuarantee that the result would be satls
actory."
Auditor Rroderirk. when informed of
Mr. Hewitt's project, at once expressed
approval of it.
"The Merchants' Association, " said he,
"is now trying to get the city to light Mer
k'-t street with uniform electric lamps.
Hewitt's scheme would save all of the. ex
pense. The city would got more out of
the trolley franchise thus granted than
out of most other franchises. The cost of
lighting Market streel with arc lights
would be 55 cents pÂ«*r lamp per night if
done on the basis of existing contracts.
That would mean -several thousand dol
lars per month. My idea is that the Mar
ket Street Company will have to change
to a trolley before long, and this plan
would suit both sides and be a lasting
benefit to the city."
