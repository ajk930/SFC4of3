among the thousands of depositors who

important fact that the schemers may I

laws of this. State and through proper
legal means some part of the . stolen
property may .be recovered.. It was
thought that the statute of limitation
operated against the prosecution of the'
offenders, but this is not. so in the case

Among the letters of Frank. McDon
ald that are published to-day -are the
records; of a. gigantic' crime committed
by R. H. McDonald and his two' sons. .
In the correspondence of Frank' V. Mc-
Donald and in -tlje books of the Pacific
Bank are. the proofs of the theft of.
.â 5142,000. This, dishonest transaction
was concealed- by Frank' McDonald,
who wrote that he- feared that the Pa
cific Bank could : xiqi bear up. much
longer under the- crushing load of the
Los Angeles Electric .Railway, bonds
placed upon the institution by M. H.
Sherman. â  : â 
In anticipation .of the impending
crash Frank. McDonald instructed his
brother Richard to falsify the books j
Â«,nd e?*>nr'. their fa-th'er's -name ci" a debt
of $142. 000 to the Pacific Bank. The in
structions were explicit. Dick was to
take the debt out of the regular bond
account of Dr. R. H. McDonald, create
a special bond account for the old man
and then sweep away the debt by a
falsification of the books. Not satisfied
with cheating the depositors out of this
enormous sum of. money,. Frank
planned a double stroke of rascality
and sugegsted that the burden of this
enormous debt be taken- off the Pacific
Bank and thrust ' upon the People's
Bank, thus robbing the poor depositors
of that institution. . : Â
Under this plan A. F. Johns, who had
no money that either institution could
command, was to give his note for $100,
000, and A. L.. Jenkins was to give his.
note for $50,000. .Frank . then briefly re
marked that the debt: of the â¢ Pacific
Bank to the People's Bank would thus .
be reduced to the extent of $150,000.
Nothing more -is. necessary- . to show
how the robbers of the Pacific Bank
made the People's Bank, the feeder to I
replace their thefts. This phase' of the !
correspondence of Frank McDonald is j
of vital importance and demonstrates i
for the first 'time' to the public, beyond
any possible, quest-ion, the gigantic fob
beries that were perpetrated in the sav
ings institution established by the Mc-
Donalds. In the letters published this
FRANK McDONALD COMMANDS HIS BROTHER TO STEAL.
The above fac-similes are excerpts from the letter of Frank V. McDonald to his brother Richard. In this letter Frank commands Dick to falsify the records of the
Pacific Bank so as- to save their father from the payment of his just obligation of $142,000. At that time Frank momentarily expected that the banks would
crumble, and he wished to save his father from the actions of a prospective receiver. The young banker declared his belief that the banks could not hold up
much longer unCer the crushing load placed upon them by M. H. Sherman and the bonds of his Los Angeles Electric Railway. In anticipation of disaster.
Frank McDonald commanded Dick to steal $142,000 for their father's sake In all the secret fiistory of the Pacific Bank conspiracy there is no more shameful
crime than this which is presented in all its ugliness in the very handwriting of Frank McDonald himself

The San Francisco Call
I morning there Is another important fea-
I ture. On more than one occasion Frank
McDonald writes that he is glad that
| his brother has escaped in safety
through the ordeal of examination by
I the Bank Commissioners. This is the
j first indication- that the conspirators
I sought to control the official acts of the
" Bank. Commissioners.
'â . The fact is important, as it is the
presentation of the first steps of the
conspiracy to tie the hands of the Com
missioners. It will be shown later what
part M. H. Sherman, D. S. Dorn and J.
E. Farnum played in this conspiracy
to silence the Commissioners. In this
connection Sherman had one duty to
perform, Dorn another and Farnum a
third. There are few letters in the long
correspondence that are of more im
portance to the depositors of the two
banks tha : i those published this morn
ing. They w. re written, as indicated be
fore, by Frank V. McDonald to his
brother Richard.
THE PLOT TO DECEIVE THE BANK
COMMISSION.
Frank's hopes of money did not ma
terialize. Gold was as hard to find as
what should have been his own senti
ments of personal honor, and on Sep
tember 11, 1592, he telegraphed to his
brother an instruction that he foolishly
believed VTOuM deceive the Bank Com
missioners In reference to the true con
dition of the Pacific Bank. This tele
gram was as follows:
NEW YORK. Sept. 11, 1892.
R. H. McDonald Jr., 813 Sutter street,
San Francisco, Cal. : Neither father nor
I approve of closing up D. until he
has had more show here. His pros
pects now being good for his institu
tion now to issue to us larger certifi
cates or large bill payable would be
unwise for all concerned. If you will
send on immediately those two hun
dred thousand renewed papers we
think we can so fix matters by Octo
ber 1 that Examiners will find little
to criticize. D. says we are abun
dantly secured in notes we have, but
if you wish I will try to get his per
senal note to secure .overdraft which
we can keen all confidential. I leave
to-morrow night for Norfolk to attend
to matters for father. Hope to return
within week. Address Atlantic Hotel.

FRANK'S SCHEME TO RUIN HIS
; UNCLE, JAMES McDONALD.
On September 17, 1892, Frank McDon
ald wrote a most remarkable letter to
his brother, Richard. In this epistle
'â  Frank clearly discussed the impending
1 ruin of the Pacific Bank and shame
! lessly suggested to his brother a cow
i ardly scheme in which he hoped to
j throw the odium of disaster upon his
uncle, James McDonald. Frank went
farther than that and discussed the
probabilities of his own father's death
and the prospect of realizing from that
1 death the best possible financial terms.
SAN FRANCISCO, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 1898.
The organization of a gigantic Mc-
Donald Company was urged, Frank de
liberately expressing the hope that the
brothers would succeed in robbing the
bank and save their own private for
tunes. Excerpts from the letter are as
follows:
NEW YORK, Sept. 17, 1892.
My Dear Brother: I fully appreci
ate the enormous strain under which
you have long been laboring, and It
drives me nearly wild to think I can
bring you no moneyed relief. It does
seem as if everything was at sixes
and sevens. In regard to Dyer I have
nothing further to advise, as I wrote
you before. Get all the security you
can consistently with your plan and
then do as you think wisest.
Now, in regard to what you have to
pay. You must not think of trying to
pay Captain until you can afford it
even if years hence. Place on him the
responsibility of disaster in demand
ing it. Nay, more than this. If worst
comes and* you need more money and
can get it nowhere else, make him
take his county bonds and borrow from
the savings bank for you. If he
wishes us to close, let him force It.
He must know we are safe enough,
only our money is tied up. and if he is
not" willing to help us then let the
public blame him for it.
I have beon down to Norfolk and I
tell you while things there in real es
tate are suffering from a reaction
from a big boom, yet Norfolk is grow
ing and is going to be a big city, and
father's property 13 getting valuable
rapidly, and if we have nothing left us
but this property and can hold It a
few years we shall have all we need.
I went to Norfolk at father's re
quest to get deeds to his Norfolk
pnperty made out for his thre<> chil
dren for acknowledgment by him now
and to be placed on record at his
death unless otherwise disposed by
him previously. I found the laws of
Virpinia different from ours in that
respect, and had to return to consult
father for further Instruction. Now
he will make a codicil to his will pro
viding especially for his Virginia prop
erty, and making you and me his ex
ecutors without bonds with power to
sell for all three of his children
equally. I have been urging him to
do better than that, viz.: To form now
in his lifetime a stock company to be
railed the R. H. McDonald Company.
Let it be stocked for $5,000,000 and let
the company issue to him all the stork
in exchange for his property, which
he will deed and sell to the company.
Then you see his estate will all be
Itept together, each of us will receive
so much stock and whatever bequests
he makes will be carried out by the
company. You see at once the high
character this would impart to every
thing. In the event of his death it
would be a shame to see his property
slaughtered by some heir wishing a
division at once, whether the time waÂ»
ripe or not for such, and then you
know that Mattie is not over happily
married, and if real estate came to
her there might be endless complica
tions, while with nothing but stock for
her share her position would be prac
tically independent. The company
would be a close corporation consist-
Ing of pa, you, myself, Mattie and
no others. The more I think of this,
the more it seems to me to be the
thing.
If we wait until his death to form
such an association some heir may
not be willing or other difficulties may
arise, and so far as I can see no ad
vantage is gained and heavy probate
RECORD OF THE CRIME OF R. H. McDONALD AND HIS TWO SONS.
In all the secret correspondence of the Pacific Bank there is no more startling or Important letter than that which Frank McDonald prpte commanding his brother
Richard to falsify the books of the Pacific Bank and thus save their father from being a debtor to that institution to the afaoiini of 5M2.000 â¢Â» letter
Proves the conception of the crime and the records of the Pacific Bank establish its accomplishment. Facsimiles ot the bank books and the checks.neces
sary to conceal the gigantic uieft are given above, Frank commanded his brother Richard to take the record of their father s enormous debt out of the ojd
man's bond account, create a special account, and in that account release their father from his obligation to the institution, 2Â£LÂ£SLt32i ln â¢

this way may all be avoided. He can
issue his stock Intended for his chil
dren in certificates to himself in
dorsed to them, and hold these certifi
cates with instructions in an envelope
for each to be opened at his death.
When we take these certificates under
a contract to cany out his instruc
tions t*ien ther* .'= no will, no prolate
and each receives his stock and every
thing moves along smoothly. What
do you think of this plan? Consult
some lawyer about it and see If there
is any hitch in the plan, for I may
telegraph you to tend to the execution
of it. You see the very fact of the
existence of such a company of paid
up capital of five million dollars would ,
be a great help to your credit. Al
though if the Lord permits us to
weather this winter and unload some
of our burdens I hope we shall never
again need credit. I think we shall
have some little peace of mind and
not be eternally struggling for daily
breath and existence. Your loving
brother, FRANK.
P. S. â While father has been very
sick, still with care he ought to pull
through and live a good long time yet,
but he must be careful of himself.
Keep all matters concerning his health
religiously to yourself.
LOOKING FORWARD TO THE
TREACHERY OF A. F. JOHNS.
On October 17, 1892, Frank McDonald
gave In a letter another evidence of his
strangely treacherous character. With
a premonition that was subsequently
developed into a reality he expressed a
distrust of A. F. Johns, the confidential
agent and shrewd manipulator, who
knew the plots and carried out the
schemes of the McDonalds. Frank
wrote In part as follows:
I have taken Johns' name out from
the trustees of the Madera proposition
and substituted my own, making you,
Edminster and myself the three.
Johns can be superintendent and so
forth, but a trustee is for ten years,
and you do not know what his rela
tionships may be to us in that time.
Besides, it is unfair to tie him up In
any such long undertaking where he
has no capital of his own invested.
THE CONSPIRATORS ESCAPE THE
BANK EXAMINERS AGAtN.
A few days later Frank McDonald, in
writing to Dick, indicated with studied
clearness that he was a fool. A certain
transaction In which M. H. Sherman
was Involved gave Frank a splendid
opportunity to show that he did not
possess common sense. He believed
that he had imposed on Sherman, but
thf! latter, as a matter of fact, had de
ceived the young banker and ha<l tak?n
the first step toward foisting upon the
Pcop'e's Home Bank another practical
ly worthless security. In this letter
Frank discusses incidentally his evi
dent satisfaction of the fact that Dick
and the Insolvent Pacific Bank had
again escaped the scrutiny of the Bank
Commissioners. The bank was again
insolvent and had been for over a year.
The ?lder McDonald, his two sons and
the parasites that fed upon them knew
that fact and congratulated themselves
that another period of robbery had
been Insured. The letter was as fol
lows:
N. V., Oct. 31, 1592.
My Dear Brother: I am so glad you
are through with the B. C. ordeal, and
now we shall have a breathing 1 spell
in which to wonk harder than ever,
but not under quite the same nervous
strain. I hope In the next few weeks
to get you in some money from one
source or another, but things move
slowly. Those around me of little use
now. I am glad those thieving Millers
were not able to block us entirely, al
though they had delayed us several
weeks. As you will see from inclosed
letters from the United States Na
tional, I have been tending to that
matter, but they are rather fussy and
finicky, and in the long run will not be
a correspondent you will wish to keep.
Their cashier is not cut on a broad
enough gauge, although In many re
spects a very nice young man. I first
took him $100,000 in Electrics, but he
seemed not to wish any bonds that
were not listed in the market here, and
said he would prefer our bills receivable.
He said he did not know and could not
inquire about what was at the basis
of a bond value, so as to explain the
same to a bank examiner, taut that
bills receivable spoke for themselves
and were divided risks, and etc., etc.,
as you will readily understand. I then
waited until the Dyer matter was ad
justed, at father's request and to suit
father's idea of what was the best
that you could do under the circum
stances, and took down such collat
eral as I have already advised you to
the United States National, and the
cashier accepted it. He asked me
Dyer's financial strength, and I told
him I Â«tonsidered him worth $500,000.
It may be I can work in $10,000 of .
Gage notes, and if so I will return you
the difference. Sherman is hereâar
rived yesterdayâ but he has been so
busy with some matter cabled for by
Mr. Murphy in London that I have
had hardly a glimpse of him, but ex
pect to see him to-morrow. I hope you
will tell Crank nothing. He has been
false to us in every particular, and you
must he very cautious of him and his
ally Woodard. They are neither of
them fair-minded or honest In their
dealings. I am very sorry you ever
let them know anything of these af
fairs, as it will make it that much
harder to work out.
I congratulate you on the Callfor
nian. It is growing to be an institu
tion in the land. I also congratulate
you on getting by the B. C. so well.
It lifts a great load from my mind.
I am sorry I have nothing but talk so
far to send you, but with D.'s affairs
forever hanging so in the balance and
pa sick and Mattle's affair, besides the
eternal delay,'! have been almost sick
The hundred thousand Electrics that
I first left with the U. S. I took and
left with the Chemical. I thought, in
view of the tight market here now, it
would look good to bring in a lot of
collateral of our own accord.

SHERMAN AIDS 0. T. DYER, AND
THEN WANTS TO KILL HIM.
A few days later Frank attempted to
frighten O. T. Dyer, the manager at
the Riverside Bank, and threatened to
force him to the wall. The result was
natural. The incident cost Frank Mc-
Donald 1 a large sum of money, forced
from M. H. Sherman a desire to mur
der Dyer and thrust upon the PeoDle's
Home Bank another poor security.
Frank wrote as follows:
N. V., November 3. 1892.
My Dear Brother: These last days
have been most painful ones with D.
and his bank matters, and have re
vealed another mine of his secrecy
ami duplicity. It seems all along the
Water Company baa had a deposit
in his bank of $40,000. which has been
held as a trust fund, payable at order
of the trustees and is now, that they
are refunding the bonds available for
payment of the company's debts;
therefore they now ask that D. pay
their notes out of this fund and as we
had them, either he had to surrender
the notes, or the knowledge he could
not would have closed him up. I would -
not surrender them without substan
tial payment, as I told him that I had
taken enough blame on his account
and these notes were the only things
we saw any early money in and the
only thing we had we could look to
for coin relief. I asked him for at
least twenty thousand dollars, but ten
thousand was all he was able to raise,
and that he got from Reynolds after a
hard struggle.
I refused to deliver up the notes
for that, amount, and then Sherman,
who happened to be here in connec
tion with the electric matter, said if
D. went overboard it would hurt all
our trades, and D. must be kept up if
possible. M. H. went out with D. to
try and raise more, but they could not
make it. D. is the principal one in
handling this New York Electric syn
dicate that wish to purchase our elec
tric interest, and M. H. feels it would
be ruinous to have D.'s disaster come
now. and Johns and the doctor feel
the same way. and so do I. But I
said the money was not enough, so
finally M. H. said that the crash
would ruin him, too, by undermining,
his credit, and he would rather pay
five thousand dollars himself on D.'s
account, although he, M. H., was so
terribly hard up and money poor. So
I took his check, five days' sight, on
Valley Bank of P.. for five thousand
dollars, and promised to hold it five
days until he could make arrange
ments with Christy to have it met. I
thought it better to have D. get an
other fellow hounding him for $5000,
as well as ourselves. I made Sherman
take D.'s note and an assignment of
5000 of our term certificates to be is
sued to M. H. as collateral on that
note.
I also took from D. and assignment
back to us of 30,000 of the 60.000 coupon
term certificates to be issued to him.
I had to go to the Republic Bank and
get 10,000 of the water notes there,
left as collateral, and as I had noth
ing to put in their place I had Johns
make a note of $15,000 tÂ«> the Pacific
Bank and I put up the Marble Com
pany's stock with it, and put that note
and stock in the place of the water
notes. This ends this new disgusting
phase of these matters. I saw no other
way out of it.
M. H. is heartily disgusted that D.
had to bleed him for that $5000, and he
would like to kill D. Your loving
brother, FRANK.
dr. r. h. McDonald once more
deceives commissioners.
Wher the Pacific Bank finally crum
bled and thousands of men and women
found themselves robbed of their
money, the claim was made that Dr.
R. H. McDonald knew nothing of the
rottenness of the Pacific Bank, nor of
the thievery of his sons. There is now
I-.rocf that Dr. R. H. McDonald knew
every phase of his sons' robberies. He
was a party to their schemes. He de
manded one son to steal enough money
to provide him for six months. He fled
from the State to evade the Bank Com
mit sioners and to save himself from
fulfilling his promise that he would
give up his private fortune to the
bank. As an indication of the elder
McDonald's deception, Frank sent the
following telegram to Dick:
NEW YORK, November 15, 1R92.
R. H. McDonald Jr., Pacific Bank, San
Francisco, Cal: B. C. have just tele
graphed father to know when he will
return. He wired that it would be
soon, and that he would write particu
lars. FRANK.
ABSOLUTE PROOF OF A GIGANTIC
THEFT BY DR. McDONALD
AND HIS SONS.
It seldom happens that a man over
his own signature may be convicted a
thief. It seldom happens that the
clever rascality of a banker may be
exDosed to the nubile The Call Is en
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
abled to say, however, that Frank V.
McDonald is by his o.wn confession a
thief. In a letter written on November
21, 1892, Frank McDonald instructed
his brother. R. H. McDonald Jr., how
to steal $142,000 from the Pacific Bank
and through it rob the People's Home
Bank of that sum of money. This
thieving operation was performed by
R. H. McDonald Jr. The records of
the Pacific Bank constitute the proof
of the embezzlement. In this case both
sons stole the money for their father,
to save the elder McDonald $142,000
that he owed to the Pacific Bank and
should rightly have paid that institu
tion. Frank McDonald's letter on this
subject is one of the most remarkable
in the entire collection. In reading it.
It should be remembered that the Mc-
Donalds had already listened to the
flattering schemers who preyed upon
the Pacific and the People's banks and
led the managers in ruinously chimeri
cal projects. When the letter of No
vember 21, 1892, was penned, the Pa
cific Bank and the People's Bank had
been ruined. The money of thousands
and thousands of depositors had been
squandered in . worthless properties.
The McDonalds and their coterie of
manipulators were attempting to foist
upon the - public practically worthless
stocks and bonds. The crash of the
Pacific and People's banks was im
pending, and the McDonalds, not satis
fied with- having squandered the funds
in their care, determined also to steal.
They knew that in support of any sug
gestion they might make they would
have the assistance of willing agents.
Excerpts from this Important letter
are as follows: .
My Dear Brother: This week will
probably decide much. We hope to
make the turn in Electrics by which
we shall get two hundred thousand
to three hundred thousand in a loan
at 6- per cent for six months, secured
by 600,000 in Electrics and thirty
six hundred shares electric stock. The
lender is to have option of purchasing
these six hundred electrics and stock
for six hundred thousand dollars.
This will make a loss of one hundred
thousand dollars on our books, but
better that and get out than bear this
crushing load indefinitely. This is
the way things look now. D. and M.
H. have to guarantee to adjust all
Chicago matters and effect the con
solidation with the help of the new
parties. We to be paid if they elect to
exercise option two hundred thou
sand dollars in six months, two hun
dred thousand dollars in twelve
months and two hundred thousand
dollars in eighteen months, but they
advance us at least two hundred
thousand dollars now and possibly
three hundred thousand dollars.
Since you seem to think D. must
be closed up soon â although I hope if
this electric deal goes through we
may see some way in safety to our
selves to let him work out â let us
make our position as strong as pos
sible. Although I feel assured the re
sults of the step you have no idea of,
and I think you better put through
all father and I agreed to until just
before you close him up in order that
no overdraft may appear on our
books to speak of.
Furthermore, as the fall may car
ry us down too, I hope you will get
everything in best shape to protect
all our various interests as much as
possible. And among other things I
hope you will change at once from
R. H. McDonald bond account that
$142,000 to our own Pacific stock
and bond account, for if an accident
is to happen we do not want it to ap
pear on our books that father seems
a debtor to the bank of that amount,
as a receiver might attempt to make2
him pay that amount and distress
him for same. Be sure and not for
get to attend to this. We are all in
terested in not being placed in this
false position any longer since the
examiners dp not seem to . appreciate
the sacrifices we make in our posi
tion. If you prefer not to have it ap
pear among your stocks and bonds
let Jenkins give his note f.or the
$142,000 at & per cent interest, pay
able when coupons mature December
1 and June l,.a'nd hold the bonds as
collateral. Only take it off . from
father's name and it better first, pass
through your stock and bond account
and then into your bills receivable.
â¢ I have to-day written to Farnum
suggesting he ask his uoard to take
two notes from usj one of A. T.
Johns, payable thirty days after de
mand for one hundred thousand dol
lars at 6 per cent interest, payable
semi-annually, secured by these 140
-zater bonds and the indorsement of
the Pacific; second, of A. L. Jenkins
for fifty thousand dollars; tame char
acter as the preceding one, secured
by the 66 Valley street, bonds and]
our indorsement. These would make
two good loans and would cut down
the deposit account with us by one
hundred and fifty thousand dollars;
then on our books we could credit up
the sale of a one hundred thousand
cf one and fifty thousand of the
other, leaving our apparent holding
of these securities only 42 plus 16 or
58 in the place of 142 plus 66 or 208.
You see we would, as it were, sell to.
Johns one hundred thousand of the
bonds, but would agree to deposit
our other forty-two as : collateral on
his notes and indorse his notes for
him and the same to Jenkins and we
would so notify them, if necessary.
This would make two good loans for
the P. H. S. B. and reduce their de
posit with us by $150,000,. If this
is feasible it should hi done, but un
less Farnum speaks to you about it
you better not mentron it to him, and
even then you better, not .say. I dis
cussed it with you. In the event
this should go through i at the P. H.
S. 8., I must have the bonds returned !
from the Chemical to you and then
you better send me the Mohawks that
1 will leave with them. Whenever |
you begin closing up on D. remem
ber you must send me other good j
bills receivable to substitute in the I.
Republic and U. S. National for the j
Riverside paper left there, and you
better send it a little ahead. They j
will not care to hold paper of an in- j
stitutipn in trouble, such as his
would be. It looks bad fcr so many
of our officers to be away so long and
people ask how we can bqt*-- be away. j .
I learn here that Murphy and |
other San Francisco banks allow in-;
terest oh bankers' deposits, and I
think you better do the seme. It is
folly for. us. to allow these deposits
to lloat away from us, as we have al- ',
ways done. Your lovin.g brother,;
FRANK.
P. S. â If only our health â¢ holds
OVt and you can peg along a while '
yet, I think we will relieve you in !
one way or another, gradually. In j
regard to the Motor road, you under- ;
stand our position. The Motor prep- '
osition is not a Riverside matter. ]
You need not feel uneasy about that i
road. It is valuable and will bring i
us a good price, whether sold to the
Southern Pacific, the A. P. or the j
Denver and Rio Grande. We were
seemingly beaten in the suit, by the
S. P. probably corrupting the court,
but it does not, after all, seriously â

CLEVER BOXING AT
THE MERCHANTS' CLUB
TWO KNOCKOUTS AND A DRAW
WAS THE RECORD.
Pat Lynch Defeated by Frank Mc-
Donald in a Speedy Battle
of Six Rounds.
Two knockouts in the three bouts was
the excellent entertainment which the
Merchants' Athletic Club presented the
large crowd of lovers of the manly art
which filled the rooms of the club on
Davis street last evening. The club is
comparatively new, but ever since Its or
ganization has been making friends and
Is rapidly becoming one of the best liked
associations of its kind in the city.
The principal event last night was an
eight-round go between Jack McDonald
of. the Princeton Athletic Club and Pat
Lynch, the champion of the Excelsior
Club. It was rt-fereod by Joe Rea. A right
cross on the point of the -"W laid Lynch
out in the sixth round. Throughout the
bout the fighting was fast and furious,
both- men receiving considerable punish
ment. McDonald had a trifle the Dest of
it during all of the rounds, using short
arm body blows with great effect.
Julius "Tillman of the Merchants' Club
knocked out Charles Emmons of the same
club in the second round of the four
round bout, which onened the evening's
entertainment. Emmons acted queerly
when he entered the ring, and was out of
the fight from tne start. Joe GagHardo
of Stockton and "Young Jeffries" of San
Francisco fought six rapid rounds to a
draw.
"Billy" Jordan acted as master of cere
monies, and incidentally made a political
speech in his own behalf, rienry Martin,
the Republican candidate for Sheriff, and
Edward Sweeney, candidate for Police
Judge, were called unon aaid made short
ta The San Francisco AMUetlc Club gave a
decidedly interesting fistic entertainment
Wednesday evening at its club rooms on
Sixth street. After the members had wit
nessed several preliminary bouts the
events of the evening were ushered in.
The first was a six-round bout be
tween Billy Deane and Billy Condon,
which terminated in a draw.
The last event was to have been an
eight-round contest between J. Webster,
an old-time boxer, and A. H. Vaughan, a
rising star in pugilism. Vaughan smoth

BIGGY MANDAMUSED.
Two Writs Asked For to Compel Him
to Perform Specific Acts.
Two petitions for alternate writs of
mandate to compel Registrar Biggy to
perform specific acts which he has re
fused to perform were filed yesterday.
Finlay Cook, Democratic. People's Par
ty and Non-Partisan candidate for Police
Judge, asks that the Registrar be com
pelled to send sample ballots to all voters
of Ban Francisco containing the fact that
he'is a nominee of the Citizens' Non-Par
tisan party. Through some error when
the sampfe ballots were issued it was
found that Cook's nomination by the Non-
Partisan party did not appear. He de
manded that new ballots be issued with
the correction, but Blggy, notwithstand
ing the fact that the Election Commis
sioners autorized the issuance of new bal
lots, refused to do as directed. Hence the
action for a writ of mandate.
Charles H. Murray has mandamused
the Registrar to compel him to plpce his
name on the register that he may not be
deprived of the right of suffrage on No
vember 8. Murray states that during the
months set aside for registration he was
on the high seas as an engineer on the
United States transr*>rt Senator. On his
return the Registrar refused to place his
â¢name on the register, thereby denying
him the right to vote. The writ will be
heard by Judge Dunne to-day.
Kane After Bacon Place.
Secretary Kane of the Society for the
Prevention of Vice is still actively at
work attempting to close Bacon place and
prove to Chief Lees that he can do it
without ". any assistance. Warrants
have â  been sworn out for a num
ber of the inmates of the houses
and also for the men who let
them. Several of the women were ar
rested Wednesday night and last evening.
Irene Waddel and Marcel.a Delordie wore
taken to the California street police sta
tion and charged with vagrancy. Joseph
â¢Michael and Robert C. Clapp were also
arrested and booked for letting tenements
for immoral purposes.
Says His Son Could Hear.
John Sherman, the father of Abe Sher
man, the deaf mute, whose teachers re
cently discovered that he could hear, says
the boy could hear and talk up to the
time he was 2 years old. He fell off a
platform when about 2 years old and in
jured his tongue. A swelling came in the
mouth of the child, and on account of this
he was not able to talk for a long time.
Ha did not know the child had regained
his speech until the teacher of the insti
tution told him.

FUSION RALLIES IN ALAMEDA
MAGTJIRE DECLARES SILVER
QUESTION IS STILL ALIVE.
The Judge Thinks Henry T. Gage
Is in Too Great a Hurry
to Get to the
Top.
OAKLAND, Nov. 3.â The union forces
held two rallies to-day. This afternoon
Judge Maguire spoke to a gathering at
San Leandro. To-night the Democratic
standard bearers occupied the Exposition
building.
The building was well filled when Seth
Mann introduced R. M. Fitzgerald as
chairman. In a brief speech he intro
duced J. Aubrey Jones, fusion candidate
for Congress. He said that the economic,
commercial and industrial conditions of
the country are not right and can only
be remedied by electing a Congress that
will entirely change the financial methods
now in vogue.
Governor Budd was the next speaker.
He was very enthusiastically received.
He said:
"What is the issue in this campaign?
There is but one. Maguire is the issue,
of the Democracy, the Populists, the Sil
ver Republicans and of the people. Al
lied against him the Republican party
presents as an issue everything that is
opposed to him. Every bank, every trust,
every newspaper controlled by them is
the enemy of Maguire in this campaign.
Judge Maguire in Congress for four years
fought the Southern Pacific and its allied
forces and caused Congress a year or so
ago to kill the refunding bill. And he did
this, not for Maguire, but for the people
of California."
In referring to single tax Governor
Budd said that under the constitution of
the State single tax could not be inaugu
rated. "The only single 'tacks,' " he said,
"are those upon which our political oppo
nents are now sitting." Governor re
viewed Mr. Maguire's political and official
career and declared he is the only man
in the State who can keep the railroad out
of politics. He said the railroad was anx
j ious to beat Maguire so that if a State
Equalizer should die or a Railroad .Com
â¢ missioner should die he shouTH not ftp
point their successor. He closed by re
ferring to the increased majorities given
Maguire at the last three elections and
predicting his success next week.
Judge Maguire was next introduced. He'
was received with a rousing cheer. "I
shall not attempt," he said "to discuss
the issues of the campaign. This con-
I test, as it progresses, develops into a con-
I test between tae monopolies on one side
and the people who want equal rights on
the other. We are told the silver ques-
I tion is dead. It is not. It will never be
settled until it is settled rightly. We
stand where we stood in 1896. My Democ
racy has been questioned by the Republi
cas. I am sorry that I have not pleased
them because jl think Democracy is good
enough for all.'
Mr. Magiiire then reviewed his career,
giving in detail his official acts, holding
and arguing therefrom that his Democ
! racy seemed to be satisfactory to his
; party, and that was all he cared about.
"I think Mr. Gage is in a hurry, " said
Mr. Maguire. "He wants to begin his
political career in the university instead
of in the primary school. I have been
through all the grades and now I want to
be Governor. Mr. Gage shoula begin as I
did, at the Assembly, and work his way
upward. I would advise him to let this
campaign go by default."
The speaked closed with extended re
marks on the Pacinc railroads bill. Re
ferring to the single tax Mr. Maguire
| said that it is yet in its academic or edu
cational stage and has not been taken up
by any party in this campaign.
Senator White spoke briefly. "I know
both of the candidates for Governor," he
said, "and I know them well. I respect
them both. But you must choose between
an untried man and one who has gone
through the fire and is true. Both are my
personal friends, but I have no difficulty
in making my cuoice, and I unhesitat
ingly say that you should make Mr. Ma
guire your next Governor. You know by
his past that you can trust him. He has
acted conscientiously in every office he
has held and is worthy of your support."
E. L. Hutchison closed the meeting with
a brief address.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CINCINNATI, Nov. 3. â General
Dodge, Colonel Sexton and Dr. Connor
of the War Investigation Commission
reached Fort Thomas, Ky., at 10 a. m.
In company with Major Hall, the sur
geon in charge of the hospitals at that
place, the Commissioners proceeded on
a tour of inspection of the hospitals.
They also inspected the camp of the
Sixth Regiment, which is in tents on
the grounds adjoining the hospitals.
This regiment was cut to pieces in the
Santiago campaign and has since been
recruited.
General Dodge put many questions to
the patients concerning their treat
ment, but found no one complaining.
He was especially interested In those
transported the previous day from Lex
ington, They were all in good spirits
and apparently not affected by the rail
road journey. The inspection of the
camp was thorough. At the dinner
hour General Dodge and Colonel Sexton
went to the mess tents and inspected
the food. A call was also made on
General Egbert, who commanded the
Sixth at Santiago.
The afternoon session was occupied
in hearing three witnesses, mostly on
the condition of the division hospital at
Chickamauga. The first was Major E.
F. Helburn of the Second Kentucky,
now mustered out. The death list of
his regiment, he stated, was twenty
six, most of whom died at home on fur
lough. The sickness in Chickamauga
increased very rapidly. He knew that
there was a shortage of cots in the hos
pitals, as well as of tents. In answer
to questions by Dr. Connor, he stated
that he served on a commission ap
pointed on account of a complaint of
the colonel of the First Arkansas to
investigate the division hospital.
Dr. Ward, the witness and Major
Johnson formed the commission. This
commission was appointed in the lat
ter part of August and reported about
September 5. The patients were then
being removed to the hospital and the
hospital was in a chaotic condition.
The sinks were as close as tÂ«n feet
from the wards and were in an unclean
condition. There was a dumping
ground where other refuse was thrown.-
There was a gully running right
through the site. I The sick were in
fairly good condition. The committee
examined two or three hundred wit
nesses, including commander, chap
lain, privates, hospital corps, nurses
and visitors. The committee concluded
that at first the hospital was In a bad
condition, but it got better, and during
Major Smith's control It was In good
condition. The committee found that
the cause for its bad condition arose
from the fact that it was not intended
to be more than a temporary hospital,
but the sick increased so rapidly that
it was overcrowded. Another cause
was the incompetency of men detailed
from regiments for nurses. In many
regiments the most worthless men were
detailed for that duty. The detail was
made according to regulation. The
fault was not of the medical depart
ment, but of the system.
The committee found unnecessary
suffering because of lack of tents and
cots, so that the patients were exposed
to the rain and compelled to lie on the
ground. This was the fault of the
quartermaster's department. Requisi
tions were not filled for from two to ten
days, and in some instances were not
filled at all.
When asked if there were many
deaths resulting from these neglects
he said there was an order from Dr.
Hoff to Major Smith to send fifty of the
worst patients to Sternborg Hospital.
Of these two died In a short time after
the removal. It was claimed by Dr.
Hoff that the order was to send fifty
patients, and not fifty of the worst pa
tients. The original order was not pro
duced. The witness admitted that he
would not charge these deaths to neg
lect, but to want of judgment in send
ing men out not fit to bear the fatigue.
The only complaint against the med
ical corps was in the case of one Major
Hubbard, who required ,Â«the sick to
stand at "attention" while attending
sick calls. The medical corps was not
neglectful, but was disheartened be
cause of inability to get supplies, medi
cine and proper nursing.
The witness cited an instance of a
thermometer given to an orderly to be
used for taking the temperature of pa
tients, and when asked for it the next
day he said he did not know what it
was good for and had given it away.
As instances of neglect the witness said
his committee had much testimony that
patients were allowed to remain filthy
in their beds and were actually fly
blown. This neglect was chargeable to
the nurses directly. The nurses were
frequently changed, and the officers in
charge were also frequently changed.
Some were asked to resign and others
broke down. The witness saw many
patients on cots on the ground. The
wards were not all floored until in
August.
The evidence before the committee
showed that the medical officers were
conscientious and did their utmost to
remedy the evils prevailing in the hos
pitals. The witness read the statement
of Major Smith and of Colonel Hoff,
made to his committee. The former
was a scathing arraignment of the In
efficiency of the supply department.
Medicines, medical apparatus, ice and
drinking water and other necessities
were not furnished. He also complained
bitterly of the incompetency of the
nurses.
In answer to a question by General
Dodge the witness said he did not know
at the time he made this investigation
that the hospital commandant had any
authority to purchase any medical and
commissary supplies, and he did not
think the commandant knew it, for all
the medical corps complained Â©f in
ability to get supplies.
Speaking of the water supply being
unwholesome, he said he *"ot his im
pression of its unwholesomeneÃS from
an order issued by the commander that
all drinking water should be boiled.
Colonel Hoff's statement before the
committee dealt with a defense of the
field hospital, which, he said, was orig
inally intended to accommodate 200
sick, but the sickness increased so
rapidly and unexpectedly that the sup
ply department was not able to meet
the demand. Requisitions for supplies
met many obstacles. The railroads
were said to be unable to carry goods.
Then the equipment of the First Corps
before the Third was given as a rea
son why supplies could not be fur
nished.
The witness, being asked his own
opinion about the great amount of sick
ness at Chickamauga, said he thought
that two-thirds of It was due to negli
gence of the men themselves. In his
own command men who were temper
ate and reasonably careful of their
health kept healthy. Many of them
drank stale beer after hot drills and
would lie about, cooling off suddenly.
There was a vast amount of unwhole
some food and drink sold by hucksters
until they were prohibited. The witness
cited the Eighth and Ninth New York
Regiments, which had canteens, and he
said almost the entire regiments were
stricken by disease.
This witness also read the statement
of Captain Charles Price of the Second
Kentucky, who told of hearing shrieks
from the Ninth New York ward, and
upon investigating he found that
Major Hubbard was trying to admin
ister medicine to a patient. The major
was brutal. Price interfered and
Hubbard said that was the only way to
handle a patient. The only explanation
he gave was that the patient refused to
take the medicine.
The reading was at this point Inter
rupted by the appearance of Captain
Price and he was examined. He testi
fied that on one occasion when he went
to the hospital to see one of his men,
who was ill with measles, he was in
formed that the patient had been de
tailed to carry water. The measles
wards were crowded, the men being
packed in like sardines. The same was
true of the typhoid and malarial wards.
The witness in describing the action of
Major Hubbard said that he choked the
patient and forcibly pressed him down
on the cot. He then caught the pa
tient's hands and wrenched them until
the poor man shrieked with pain. At
this point the witness said to Hub
bard:
"I do not know your name or your
rank, but this brutality must stop."
Hubbard did not stop, but said some
thing about showing a patient how to
refuse to take medicine.
Captain Price said he made it a point
to go every day to the hospital to see
about treatment of the men of his com
pany and he found that in that way his
men were not permitted to suffer.
CAMP THOMAS UNFIT
FOR A HUMAN ABODE
WASHINGTON, Nov. B.â Dr. M.
Hartsuff, who was chief surgeon of the
army at Camp Thomas from the 21st of
April until the 27th of July last, was
examined to-day by Colonel Denby of
the War Investigating Commission
concerning the conduct of the camp
from a medical point of view. He criti
cized various features In the manage
ment of the camp, beginning with the
location of some of the regiments. He
said the park was, upon general prin
ciples, a good camp ground, but that
some of the regiments were located in
swampy sections and others on rocky
ground, where it was impossible to get
the sinks of sufficient depth. In other
cases the camp was poorly drained and
in most instances the tents were too
close together. He said the sites were
selected by General Brooke, and not
withstanding his own position as chief
medical officer he had not been con
sulted in regard to the location. He had
made a formal protest at the time, but
It was not heeded.
Dr. Hartsuff took positive ground
against the establishment of division
hospitals at the expense of the regi
ments. He said that the law for the
organization of volunteer forces did not
provide for the enlistment of a hospital
corpÃ, and as a consequence there was
no force for the hospital work, and the
only way to get one was to transfer
men from the volunteer force to the
regular force. Often these men were
not the most efficient. He thought a
division or a field hospital was a neces
sity, but he did not think it should be
built up, as at present, by taking sur
geons, stewards and ambulances from
the regiments, but rather as an inde
pendent institution. He had found that
the regimental surgeons and nurses
transferred to the division hospital
were not bo capable of rendering good
services, as many were quite useless.
Furthermore, there was Immense con
fusion in the hospital. It was, he said,
a case of confusion worse confounded.
"Do you," asked Colonel Denby,
"think the establishment of division
hospitals a bad policy?" *_,*Â».
"Very bad, as done, responded the
witness.
"Couldn't you, as chief medical offi
cer, have controlled the matter?" he
was next asked.
"No, sir; it was an order of the Sec
retary of War, and under this order no
regimental hospital could be main
tained." . , .
He thought this order unfortunate,
and said that in carrying it into effect
the work of caring for the sick was
greatly interfered with and that no one
was benefited by it.
Dr. Hartsuff also expressed the opin
ion that the water supply of the camp
was not good. He said that when the
troops began to pour in the discovery
was made with alarm that the supply
was insufficient, and that he, General
Brooke and others had set about to in
crease it. A hasty decision was made
to take water from the Chickamauga
River, but notwithstanding the in-take
pipe was located about the mouth of
the creek, draining the camp, he did not
consider the water of the river whole
some and he had recommended even
after the pipe line was established to
meet the emergency that arrangements
be made to extend the system so as to
obtain water from Crawfish Spring. He
said the men often insisted upon using
surface water, which was nothing
more than drainage from the camps.
Another feature of the camp system
which Dr. Hartsuff criticized was that
of allowing each regiment to have a
refuse dump of its own. This had ren
dered the camp very objectionable
from a hygienic point of view. He had
recommeded to General Brooke the
cremation of the garbage. This recom
mendation had not been acted upon. In
response to a question from Colonel
Denby, the witness said a medical of
ficer could not execute, but could only
recommend. He attributed the failure
to adopt his recommendations to the
confusion incident to preparation of the
army for the field.
Asked if the volunteer army sur
geons under him were competent, D^-.
Hartsuff replied that some were, while
others were not. The great difficulty
had been to secure men of adminis
trative ability to conduct the hospitals.
He thought there had been suffering
because of this ignorance, and in
stanced one case in which he had found
a big hospital practically out of food
because some of the surgeons con
nected with it did not know how to
make a ration return. Summing up,
Dr. Hartsuff said:
"In my opinion, that sickness at
Camp Thomas was due largely to the
Inexperience and in many cases the in
efficiency of the medical officers, and
also to the Inefficiency and inexperi
ence of line officers who ' did not fur
nish the support they should have fur
nished to the medical department. The
execution of any plan of operation
restÃ largely with the line officers, the
duties of surgeons being largely to
make recommendations. They are
therefore unable to correct abuses
themselves and must depend upon
J others to do that. â¢ This applies to the
officers of reelments. as well as to gen
j eral officers."
Dr. Hartsuff holds the rank of col
onel In the regular army, and is now
chief surgeon of the Department of the
Lakes, with headquarters at Chicago.

been chafing under the yoke, but a
clash has been avoided.
The closing of the campaign, how
ever, brings a remarkable change in
duced by the incendiary methods of the
negroes and their white Republican
leaders. Every night for a week negro
mass-meetings have been held, and
speakers, fired by the news of trouble
in other sections of the State, have ad
vised every kind of lawlessness, even
to bloodshed on election day.
At a meeting of white citizens to-day
a plan was suggested to seize the pub
lic halls and prevent further demon
strations. This was done, and no fur
ther meetings can be held by the blacks
except in the open air.
The discharging of negroes from em
ployment has begun. One manufac
turer to-day discharged forty negro
hands. He is compelled to shut down
until white employes are. secured, but
his action is voluntary and will be rol
lowed by others. Most of the manufac
turers employing negro labor have
given notice that negroes will be
dropped from the payrollÃ after this
week. Negro tenants on all farms in
this county were given notice simul
taneously to-day to vacate at once.
Many of them have growing crops, but
this condition is not considered.
The demand for guns and ammuni
tion continues. The negroes can only
get supplies from outside sources and
secretly, as local dealers will not sell
to the negroeÃ at any price. White
farmers living in the vicinity of towns
seem to be as much against negro dom
ination as merchants and property
owners.
Republican county and city officials
are making no effort to jail negroes for
offenses, as they are needed at the
polls, they think. This adds to the
seriousness of the situation.
GUNS SHIPPED TO SCENE
OF THE RACE TROUBLES
RICHMOND, W. Va., Nov. 3.â Gun
stores here have shipped many rifles
and large quantities of ammunition to
the section of North Carolina where
race troubles are now rife. One firm
shipped seventy-five rifles in two days
and others have sent large orders. Most
of these are being sent to Eastern Caro
lina, where trouble is feared on and
before election day. The men who are
buying have been very quiet in their
purchases, but it is thought most of the
weapons are being sent to whites. Ef
forts were made by negroes to buy
rifles in Norfolk, but they were refused.
NEGRO SOLDIERS
AGAINST WHITE OFFICERS
KNOXVIL.LE, Term., Nov. 3.â The
Sixth Virginia (colored) Regiment has
quieted down from yesterday's turmoil.
The negroes who rebelled against their
white leaders have developed a remark
able spirit of weakness and nine offi
cers to whom such vigorous objections
were raised now hold full sway. The
negroes are, however, preparing a me
morial to Governor Tyler of Virginia
asking for the appointment of colored
officers. Colonel L. C. Croxton. com
manding the regiment, to-day addressed
a letter to Governor Tyler explaining
the affair of yesterday and asking the
Governor as to what assurances he
should offer the discontented negroes.
Three white regiments slept on their
arms last night, ready for any emer
gency that might call them to the Vir
ginia camp.

TUG AND SHIP IN DANGER
CLOSE CALL OF THE SIR ROBERT
FERNIE.
For Hours the Little Fairfield Strug
gles to Keep the Heavily Laden
Sailing Vessel From
Crashing Ashore.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Nov. 3.â During the severÂ©
gale last night the British ship Sir
Robert Fernie was blown ashore on the
north side of Tacoma Harbor and came
very near sustaining serious damage.
Thrice she sent up signal rockets of
distress and the tug Fairfleld bad the
hardest job she ever encountered in
keeping the Fernie away from shore
after getting hawsers aboard her.
The Fernie's predicament last even
ing was caused by her buoy moorings
going adrift To make matters wors,e
her steam winch, recently broken at
Port Townsend, was undergoing repairs
and she was unable to drop or hoist
anchor. Captain Cannon sent up signal
rockets as soon as . he found himself
adrift, realizing that his ship, valued
at $130,000, and 40,000 tons of wheat be
neath her hatches were in a perilous
situation. She was rapidly blown across
the harbor by the southwest wind,
blowing at a velocity of twenty-six
miles an hour. The Fernie's keel was
commencing to touch the mud flats on
the opposite shore when the tug Fair
field came bounding through the waves
with seas constantly breaking over her
stern.
From 1O:.3O until 1 o'clock this morn
ing the tug tussled with the elementÃ
in her efforts to keep the heavily laden
clipper from going hard aground. To-
ward 11 o'clock, it. seemed that the *
struggle was to prove .futile, the Fernie
gradually nearing the . beach. Then
came a lull in the .'gale .'arid the Fair
field gained about a quarter of a mile
to windward. . â  "â¢ â¢ . "=* â¢
The storm, however, came on with re
! nevved violence and again ship and tug
| dragged toward the beaph. This was
the most critical moment of the night.
' One of the ship's lifeboats was lowered
| and with five men at the oars and the
tug's mate steering started for Tacoraa
to obtain assistance. The boat was two
hours in pulling across the bay against
wind and sea, only to find the fires
banked aboard every, tug at the d'^cks.
By this time ..the Fernie was again
close in to the beach- &nd . rockets were
' again sent up. Another lull enabled
the tug and ship to puli. out a half
mile and the balance, of the night was
spent keeping the ship away from the
shore. It was daylight before the Fer
j nic was safely docked. Captain Cannon
says it was the narrowest escape â  he
ever had.
The' Fernie is chartered by Balfour,
Guthrie & Co. and will sail in a few
days for Europe.
Texas to Undergo Bepairs.
NEW YORK, Nov. 3.â The United

PROCTOR SAYS WE MUST
KEEP THE PHILIPPINES
MONTPELIER, Vt., Nov. 3.â United j
States Senator Redfield Proctor, who
arrived here yesterday after a trip
abroad, this afternoon addressed the
Joint Assembly of the House and Sen
ate, which last month re-elected him.
Senator" Proctor's address was brief and
was confined' to an outline of the for
eign situation, which confronts the Gov
ernment of the United States. The Sen
ator, said: " â¢ â¢.
The future policy of this country I s
the greatest question before our people.
Hawaii and- Porto Rico have been added
to the nation's domain and we have be
come sponsors for "the good government
of Cuba!- We must assume some respon
sibility, do the far East, whether it be
greater or less. In' my opinion the re
sponsibilities : in the far East are bound j
to be. greater. Many wise and patriotic j
men. in' $he country believe we should re- â 
tain no territory nor control any part |
of .the Philippines beyond a coaling sta- i
tion. or possibly a sipgle island. I rec- ;
pgnize the cogency of their argument, but ;
have failed to see clearly any practical ;
vc-ay of tarrying out their views. If any |
jurisdiction Is assumed in tho East there ;
no. logical stopping place short, of tne |
. whole of the Philippines. To establish
p. divided sovereignty would invite trou- ;
ble. Since that May morning when tne ;
S!pantsh fleet was destroyed it has seemed
tp : me practically Bettlefl that Spain must i
surrender her entire control of the F mi- j
ippines. You will pardon me if I na\ c .
spoken too plainly, but it swme- i to me
that a frank state.m-nt of what I Relieve
woald be the inevitable outcome t\as not
itnpTpper at this time.

SPAIN HAS FRIENDS
AMONG PARIS PAPERS^
PARIS. Nov. 3.â The generally ac
cepted view here Of the peace negotia
; tiona la that the Spaniards will not
agree to the propositions submitted by
; the Americans to take the Philippine
' Islands and to reimburse Spain for the
I money spent upon permanent improve
i merits in those islands. But there is a
eo-nnict of opinion as to whether or not
the Spanish Commissioners will to
morrow present a counter-proposition.
This matter, it is added, was undecided
at 2 o'clock this afternoon.
The Echo de Paris to-day expresses
strong approval of the speech delivered
at Worcester, Mass., by Senator Hoar,
in which he denounced the so-called
policy bf American extension. The -pa
per mentioned quotes the speech fully
and remarks that all American political
men "apparently do not agree with the
policy of conquest."
. The Figaro says: "The peace nego
tiations have reached a very critical
point. Up to yesterday the Spanish
.delegates had received no definite in
structions from Madrid. Will the Span
ish Government accept the American
i proposition? We doubt it."
The Petit Bleu remarks: "One must
admit, in looking beneath the surface,
that the late war has completely
changed the American character. Out
side of being anxious merely for com
mercial supremacy and playing a small
political part, save regarding the South
American republics, the United States
felt no desire to interfere in European
politics. But everything changes very
suddenly. After the success against
Spain the American Government felt
herself capable of taking part in Euro
pean politics, and the advances of Great
Britain showed the American Ministers
they could speak up. This popular feel
ing* has induced the American Govern
ment to demand the whole of the Phil
ippine archipelago, when, at the outset,
a part of the Philippines was all that
was demanded. This new demand ex
ceeds a war indemnity, and this is the
weak point which American diplomacy
has to encounter. The Spanish Govern
ment is at the end of her resources,
and hopeless as it is for her to attempt
to master the insurrection in the Phil
ippine Islands, even if they were hand
ed over to her to-morrow, it is evident
that if, instead of using the word
'abandonment,' 'cession' against a cash
indemnity is spoken of, the Spanish and
American delegates may come to terms.
The American delegates have made
several offers and have at the present
time proposed the sum of $40,000,000.
The Spaniards want more and have de
manded $100,000,000."
GRAHAM" RETIRES WITH
UNFEIGNED REGRET
His Frankness Believed to Have
Increased Displeasure at
Washington.
"HARRISBURG. Pa.. Nov. 3.â The retire
ment of General Graham from the com
mand of the Second. Corps was announced
in ramp to-day in an order signed with his
nemo. Tn it he says:
In severing his relations with the corps
he d[oea so with unfeigned regret. His as
sociation with the officers and men of the
corps has always been of the most pleas
a.ht character, and he believes that he has
â¢always received the most loyal support,
which is attested by the fine condition of
the corps to-day in -discipline and instruc
tion.
General 'Graham's removal is believed
by many officers and other soldiers at
Camp Mearic- to have been due to his
.frankness in asserting his rights, and that
as a resuÃ he excited disfavor of the War
Department. The General is much disap
pointed at not having been permitted to
take the Second Corps to Cuba. General
Graham is said to have been assured by
President MeKinley in Washington a
short time ago that he would be retained
in command of the Second Corps until it
was located in Cuba.

HAS RUSSIA DARED
TO TAKE NEWCHWANG?
WASHINGTON, Nov. 3.â The Chi
nese Minister, Mr. Wu, is following
with much interest the developments in
the East, where the conflicting interests
of Russia and England seem to be on
the verge of open hostilities. Concern
ing the latest report that Russia had
taken the treaty port of Newchwang,
thus giving her control of all Man
churia and shutting out the British
from trade in that great section, Mr.
Wu says it is hardly credible that Rus
sia has taken such a step, as New
chwang, being a treaty port, is of al
most as much interest to the outside
world as it is to China.
The treaty ports are freely open to
foreign trade, and as a result large for
eign colonies have been built up in
them. It is at the treaty ports that the
United States has established her trade
with China. For this reason Mr. Wu
feels satisfied that any such important
movement by Russia as the taking of
a treaty port would be speedily report
ed by the United States Minister at
Peking and all other foreign repre

CAMP MEADE INQUIRY
WILL BEGIN TO-DAY
CAMP MEADE, MIDDLETOWN,
Pa., Nov. 3.â The war investigating
sub-committee has not yet reached
Camp Meade. It is expected to-mor
row. It is not thought that any -testi
mony will be taken, as only three of
the investigators are coming here.
They heard Major General Graham's
story at Washington a month ago and
Major General Young has told what he
knows of the alleged abuses at Camp
Wikoff.
The vote of the Two Hundred and
Third New York Regiment was taken
to-day, the polls being open f rom -8 to
4. The regiment is Isolated among the
Conewaga Hills on account of an out
break of typhoid fever after reaching
here and less than half of the com
mand is on duty. The rest are in city
hospitals or home on furlough.
General Graham's condition was im
proved to-day and he left on a morn
ing train for New York to join his fam
ily. Colonel Girard says the general
is a very sick man and went home on
his advice.
Indications are that General Young
will continue in command of the Sec
ond Corps for some time after the
South is reached, as General Lawton
is to go to Cuba and arrange for the
disposition of his corps there.
running from Tientsin to Kinchow,
which was designed to be extended to
Newchwang and thence northward,
tapping the richest sections of Man
churia. It is at the head of the Gulf of
Pechlli and is so situated as to be of
great strategic value in connection
with Port Arthur, now occupied by
Russia under a lease from China. Port
Arthur is at the extreme end of the
Liaotung peninsula, while New
chwang is at the threshold of the
peninsula, so that together they com
mand all of that territory which seems
shaped by nature for military and na
val purposes. It is this which has led
to such activity in the British naval
stations, particularly 'at Wei-Hal-Wei,
across the gulf from Port Arthur.
While Mr. Wu does not believe Rus
sia has occupied Newchwang, yet he
says Russia may have given color for
puch reports by pushing forward some
of her troops to Newchwang. It is in
the natural line of development, if
Russia diverts the Trans-Siberian Rail
way so as to make a terminus at Port
Arthur, and for that reason is doubtless
much coveted by the foreign commer
cial interests.
A private telegram received yester
day announces that the engineers of
the American syndicate which has se
cured extensive concessions in China
have arrived at Shanghai. They will
begin surveys from the proposed line
from Hankow to Canton, connecting
some of the largest cities and opening
up some of the richest country in
China.
PLACES FOR VETERANS
OF THE SPANISH WAR
President Will Urge Congress to
Amend the Civil Service
Rules.
NEW YORK. Nov. 3.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs: I
understand that President McKlnley pro
poses to make a recommendation to Con
gress that the civil service rules be so
amended as to direct that preference be
given to veterans of the Spanish war as
well as the civil war in appointments to
all Government offices.
Anticipating the adoption of the Presi
dent's recommendation Secretary Long
will issue an amendment to navy yard
regulations within a few days di
recting that In the employment of
labor preference be given, as in
the case of veterans of the
war of the rebellion, to men who served
in the Spanish war. This order contem
plates that preference be shown first to
those who were wounded in battle or
who were actually at the front.
Mother of Fitzhugh Lee Dead.
RICHMOND, Va., Nov. 3.â The mother

Special Dispatch to The CalL
LONDO.. Nov. 3.â An official note
issued this evening says: "There is
now good reason to hope that the po
litical situation is ameliorating. It
can be confidently stated that when
the cause of the irritation which un
fortunately recently existed in France
and Great Britain over the Upper Nile
is removed, which is expected soon to
be the case, the door will again be open
for a resumption of those friendly ne
gotiations which happily characterize
the normal state of the relations be
tween the two countries."
NEW YORK, Nov. 3.â The London
correspondent of the Evening Post
cables to-day that a general and satis-
factory arrangement has been reached
between Great Britain and France on
the Fashoda question.
GREAT BRITAIN'S SHOW
OF WARLIKE STRENGTH
KINGSTON, Jamaica, Nov. 3.â The
British naval authorities at Port Royal,
the naval headquarters here, express
the opinion that the order for the
mobilization of the British North
American and West Indian squadron
forms part of a grand and comprehen
sive scheme for a naval demonstration
on the Pacific and Atlantic, intended to
indicate Great Britain's readiness to
face any and all possible hostile de
velopments. Great Britain, it is said,
fully realizes the menaces of the future
and will accept war now with France
or Russia or both, and the present
demonstration indicates that neither
will accept the challenge. But, should
they do so, Great Britain can never be
more prepared than now, especially in
view of the possible arraneement of
an American understanding, and in
view of the fact that the Marquis of
Salisbury's Government has the sup
port of all the political parties in Great
Britain.
MAJOR MARCHAND
ARRIVES AT CAIRO
CAIRO, Nov. 3.â Major Marchand,
the commander of the French expedi
tion at Fashoda, arrived here at 7
o'clock this evening. He was met at
the railroad station by the French
officials and residents. The explorer
looked thin and worried. Directly the
major appeared at the door of the
train the spectators rushed forward,
waving hats, sticks and handkerchiefs,
and crying "Vive Marchand!" The
latter, who was much pleased and
touched at the reception accorded him,
drove off to the French diplomatic
agency amid cheering.
Only two Sena^alese soldiers accom
panied Major Marchand, whose future
movements depend upon the instruc
tions which Captain â Baratier brings
him to-morrow.
At the French agency It was for
mally announced that no one would
be permitted to interview the French
officer, as M. del Casse, the French
Minister of Foreign Affairs and the
Marquis of Salisbury must be the
first "to receive all news which may
contribute to the harmony of the two
countries."
The major reports that he left all his
companions in good health, and he
adds that they had abundant pro
visions and a plentiful supply of am
munition.
The French commander also ex
pressed himself as being much grati
fied at the kindness shown him by the
British officers during his Journey to
this place.

UTES STILL CAUSING
ANXIETY IN COLORADO
Beassuring Dispatches That Do Not
Explain the Absence of the
Game Wardens.
DENVER, Nov. 3.â General Sumner,
commanding the Department of Colorado,
to-day received this dispatch from the
commanding officer at Fort Duchesne:
Hava Â»ent details to each agency to make
thorough inquiries as to absent Indians. They
will report back to-morrow night. The rumnr
of Indians being In Colorado is a mistake, as
the Indians are now being paid grass money
kn 1 there are no absentees on the rolls so
far A general Indinn council Is to be held
at \he agency Saturday. All Indians are ex
rerted then.
Despite this reassuring information
anxiety is still felt here in regard to the
came wardens who went to the western
nart of the State to investigate the situa
tion, as no word has been received from
1 A^speclal to the News from Rifle. Colo ,
says- James Rector, a prominent cow
man from Rangely. reports about 400 Utes
in Colorado in the vicinity of Rangely.
They are killing a great amount of game,
and say they will stay out until they get
all the game they want. They are not
molesting the settlers in any way but
should force be attempted to take them
to the reservation the Indians, would
probably make a fight. Mr. Rector states
that a company of soldiers is now sta
tioned at Rangely, and the Utes will prob
ably be persuaded to return to their res
ervation without any trouble.
Election Ballots Damaged.
SAN DIEGO, Nov. 3.â Fire broke out in
the basement of the County Court House
at noon to-day from the carelessness of
some smoker in throwing a cigar among
papers. The election supplies and ballots
were all in this portion of the building
and before the fire was subdued they
came near being destroyed. As it is, the
ballots and forms of returns from elec
tion precincts were badly damaged.

GAGE AND PATTON ADDRESS SEVEN GREAT GATHERINGS
.*-â¢â * * .â¢***â '
Voters in Every Quarter of the City Rally to Cheer the Republican Candidates and to Applaud the Grand and
Lasting Principles Which They Represent and Which Will Triumph Over All.
THE Germans and the Austrlans have
had their nights, Italy has been in
vaded, the French quarter has turned
out in the glare of much red fire, and
the Mexican colony has been offering up
ayes to Republican success since the cam
paign opened, but it remained for the
Slavs to cap the climax in the enthusiasm
of foreign-born voters for all things Re
publican with a booming rally last even-
Ing at Pioneer Hall.
And the party paid a tribute to the
power for good that San Francisco's
Slavic population wields in affairs by
sending to speak to those who came its
standard bearer, Henry T. Gage, and the
full list of its municipal nominees. Julius
Kahn and Tirey L. Ford were also there,
and Myron H. Woolf. whose splendid
oratory has been heard in every section
of the State since the campaign opened,
was down as the leading speaker of the
evening.
There wns not a hitch to mar the ar
rangements that had been made by Presi
dent Zan, of the Slavonic Republican
Club, and his numerous list of vice-presi
dents. Those whu assisted him In the
success of the evening were C"hÂ«rles Bliss,
G. J. Matulich. A. Sorich, Count J. K.
Zedwitz. F. I.astufka, J. J. Justice,
Adolph Kacoilr. F. Katner. R. Dumarez.
S. Yuoosagevlch, M. Tasovaz, A. Gecan,
M. Zaro, S. Sargentlch. R. Marolvioh, Dr.
J. J. Gergrerevich, S. Gerunovich and R.
S. Sawhuok.
The tnettlnsr was opened by Charles
Bliss, wh" introduced the president of the
evening. Frank Zan. and he. In an elo
quent exposition of the current political
Issues, presented to his audience the
speaker of the evening. H. Myron WooU.
Said Mr. Woolf: "We are in a peculiar
and critical campaign for the reason that
the great American people have in the
past few months been engaged in an un
usual occupation, that of making history,
and this. election that we are about to hold
is to give-us an opportunity to voice our
sentfments.
"And I believe from what I have heard
and what I have seen all over the State
In the past few weeks that we are. al
most as tt' whole people, going to indorse j
our great President and the statesman- j
like -course that he has pursued, and send
to him in Congress a solid delegation !
that' will stand with him Jn the - plans I
that- he has for' the broadening of this j
country and its resources.
"The Republican party has always
stood for one solid principle from the time !
it was born fighting against slavery, and '
In this campaign we find it standing for i
:' one principle still. Opposed to It is that
Popocratic and erratic conglomeration â !
known as the Fusion party, standing for i
all sorts of things and hardly any two of |
them agreeing. The Populists repudiate
the course of the present Governor of this
State; the Democrats indorse it; yet the
Governor accepts both parties as one. The
Silver Republicans indorse President Mc-
Kinley, the Democrats condemn him, yet
we find Maguire straddling the platform
of both those parties. This confusion
. rijeans the death of the new Democracy,
and I think you will be cpljed to ait as a
Coroner's jury on the remains after the
Bth."
Charles L. Pattern's arrival and enthu
siastic reception cut short Mr. Woolf's
powerful argument for a solid Republican
vote and he smilingly gave way to the
: new coiner.
"Thank you.' said Mr. Patton, when
â¢ things had quieted enough for him to be
heard. "Every meeting that I attend
".' lately reminds me that our Democratic
friends are not so Jubilant as they used to
â  be. This walkover that was to have been
is not to be if this spirit that you have
shown is to prevail. This fight has re
solved itself so far as the other side is
concerned into a fight between James D.
Phelan and his millions and Charles L.
Patton and his friends, and I am going to
go right along making friends as fast as I
.* can. I think I have grot a few of them
' here in this audience.
"I am in favor of the confirmation of
"thÂ© charter and if elected I shall do every
thing in my power to have it confirmed.
That charter is . going to make a good
many things possible that we have wanted
. for a long time. It will make it possible
for th 6 public to own all public utilities,
and it will, make It possible to force the
gre-at corporations to satisfy themselves
â with an interest of 5 per cent instead ot
demanding the enormous profits that they
get now. These things I am in favor of
and shall work for with all there is in
me." â  â¢
Mr. Patton assured his hearers that he
was not and would not be bound by the
Influence of any corporation or bosses,
and pledged himself to an economic and
business-like administration. He had
scarcely finished when the band, the audi
". ence and everything else in the hall that
'.â¢could make a Jiojse announced the ex
' 'pected arrival of Mr. Gage. A delegation
of the club's officers had been stationed
at the door all the evening waiting hfs
. arrival, and they escorted him to the
etage through a mob of excited partisans,
â¢ who were eager for a handshake.
. Sir. Gage had seven meetings to appear
before last evening, and his talks were
, short. He thanked his hearers for their
splendid demonstration to Republican
principles, and told them that if they
would do their share on Tuesday next
success would be assured, for outside of
; San Francisco the State would go Repub
lican to. a certainty. It was perfectly evi
dent, he said, that his audience was fully
awake to the dangers of the success of
the fusion ticket, and he thought they
needed no explanation of the many ques
tions that had come up In the campaign.
He reiterated his assurance of undoubted
Â° party success in the State at large and
siaid that he spoke from Information that
could not be questioned. With a hearty
good-by and a bow to the wild applause,
he left the stage to Tirey L. Ford and
took a carriage for his next stand.
Mr. Ford said that it was a privilege he
had sought to appear before the represen
â¢ tatives of a people that had been always
the warmest friend of this country. He
referred to the time, during the late Civil
.War, when the North was threatened by
the interference of a great naval power
' from across the sea and the great Russfan
bear raised his paw in this country's pro
tectlon.
"We were fighting for freedom then,"
said Mr. Ford. "It was the fight of the
Republican party against slavery, and the
love that Tlussla showed us then is ours
to-day. What more natural than that you
who have left that country should affil
iate with the Republican party when
you arrive here?" Mr. Ford also men
tioned that America had shaaken hands
with Russia across Bering Straits, and
that the two countries are now neighbors
in the far East, and, said he, "since we
have been such good friends in the past
why on God's earth should we not con
tinue?" His hearers were evidently of
the same mind. They cheered him to the
echo, and he had to lengthen his speech
materially before he was allowed to make
room for Julius Kahn.
Mr. Kahn spoke for but a few minutes
upon the necessity of returning a solid
Republican delegation to Congress as an
Indorsement of President McKinley, and
to assist and sympathize in his plans for
ttoe future. He said that he had other
meetings, and that the municipal candi
dates wanted to speak, so he made way
for them.
Nearly all of the municipal nominees
took their turns at short talks on local
issues. Judge Murphy was on hand, as
were Asa Wells, I. J. Truman and Ed I.
Sheehan. William A. Deane came In late
and brought the Police Judges-to-be with
him, and they were followed by Martin
Fragley and A. C. Berthier. All of them
were introduced and made hearty prom
ises of fealty to the people's cause before
the meeting stood adjourned.
LATIN \/OTE
IS SOLID
FOR GAGE
Citizens of Latin descent turned out en
masse last night and filled Garibaldi Hall
to overflowing, and they were all there to
shout for Gage, Patton and the Republi
can ticket. It was a grand ante-election
mass-meeting, under the auspices of the
. Scavengers' Union.
Men who toil from early morning till
late at night put off fatigue and attended
| the meeting to listen to remarks by ne
men for whom they intend to cast their
ballots on election day. Although many
of the men present were unfamiliar with
rostrum English, they recognized tne
speakers and thoroughly understood their
intentions, and indorsed the principles
which they represent. These men, who
! came from far off foreign climes, love
' liberty and justice, and. appreciating the
protection guaranteed them by the stars
and stripes, they are enrolled in the ranks
i of the Republican party, secure in the
; faith that the continuance of that party
; In power assures them continued liberty,
equality and an opportunity to earn an
I honest livelihood.
Dr. Calegaris, formerly a Democrat,
presided, and urged his hearers to vote
the ticket they .had adopted at a previous
meeting of the union â Gage for Governor
and Patton for Mayor. Mr. Patton's en
trance shortly after the meeting was
called to order interrupted the gentleman
who waÂ« speaking, and he gracefully re
tired, while the hall resounded with plaud
its for the Republican champion. Mr.
Patton spoke only a few moments, defin
ing his position on the issues of the cam
paign and the questions which interest
the taxpayers of this city.
Referring to the new charter he de
clared that he was heart and soul in
favor of it, because the people had voted
for its adoption. On the matter of taxes
he emphatically expressed himself in
favor of the dollar limit, and assured the
audience that If elected he would strenu-
POTRERO REPUBLICANS
ously endeavor to so administer the af
fairs of the city that the tax rate would,
not exceed that figure. On assessments
he firmly pledged his honor that he would
strive, with the assistance of the Asses
sor, to equalize the burden of taxation
and do justice to the workingmen who
own their own .homes, by compelling the
gas, water and street railroad companies
to pay their just proportion of the ex
penses of the city government.
Mr. Patton finished speaking just as
Henry T. Gage arrived, and the cheers
for him were continued for Mr. Gage,
who was immediately presented to the
audience. He renewed his pledge to give
the people an honest, clean and untram
meled administration, If elected Governor,
and briefly reviewed the issues of the day,
closing with a prophecy that nothing
could prevent the success of the Republi
can ticket next Tuesday. His assurance
that rich and poor alike would receive
exact Justice at his hands appealed to
the sentiment of the crowd, and he was
given a magnificent ovation as he left
the stage.
Henry N. Clement followed Mr. Gage
and urged the election of the Republican
candidates. Hon. A. B. Splivalo addressed
the meeting in English and Italian, and
judging by the applause which frequently
interrupted his remarks he convinced the
voters that they would subserve their
own and the interests of the whole peo
ple by voting the straight ticket. State,
Congressional and municipal. Dr. Cale
garls also spoke a few words !n Italian
for A. C. Berthier. Judge Low, A. C.
Berthier, Justices of the Peace Kerrigan
and Groexlnger, and others were presented
and received merited approbation. M. H.
Barry, candidate for Assembly from the
Forty-fourth District, made a short
speech.
POTRERO
GIVES GAGE
IA/ELCOME
Henry T. Gage tested the temper of the
people of the Potrero laat night and the
response was unanimous in its indorse
ment of Mr. Gage, the party and the plat
form on which the standard bearer of the
Republicans stands. The meeting was held
in Maennerbund Hall, Potrero avenue and
Twenty-fourth street. Fully 700 people
were present, and the welcome that
they accorded to Mr. Gage, after waiting
for over two hours for him to arrive, as
well as the manner in which they
received what he had to say, left no doubt
in any one's mind as to which of the gu
bernatorial candidates will carry that par
ticular district.
T. C. Maher was introduced by State
Central Committeeman Frank Mitchell as
the chairman of the meeting. Mr. Maher
first Introduced Julius Kahn, candidate
for Congress, who was warmly received.
Mr. Kahn was loudly cheered before he
began his remarks. He started by citing
the fact that when the President called
for volunteers the men of California were
among the first to offer their lives for
their country, thus proving to the world
their patriotism and also their Indorse
ment of the administration. He asked the
question if the men of the State proposed
to go back on the President and the ad
ministration now by Bending to Congress
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 1898.
men who were not in touch with the ad
ministration. Loud cries of "Not" greeted
his question from all over the hall.
Mr. Kahn went on to show that Cali
fornia had of late been overlooked in the
matter of appropriations and public pat
ronage because her Congressmen were not
in touch with the administration, in fact,
because, on the other hand, they were
usually to be found fighting the adminis
tration and opposing the President. He
said that if we stood by the President
now we could secure the commerce of the
Pacific Ocean. This remark evoked great
applause. Mr. Kahn clearly demonstrated
how the holding of the Philippines would
benefit this country materially and San
Francisco in particular. He showed from
the consular reports that while we spent
$4,000,000 in the Philippines annually our
exports were only $162,000 for each year,
while every other nation's exports to the
same islands was up in the millions of
dollars. This state of affairs, he said,
could and should be reversed, and he
made so bold as to state that it
would be reversed If a Republi
can Congress was elected to sup-
port the administration. Mr. Kahn point
ed out the fact that the Republican party
had always been the friend of the work
ingman, and he emphatically denied that
he had ever been under the control of any
railroad or corporation. He stated that
he wanted the yellow journal that made
the false assertion to prove it or else
shut up.
Pending the arrival of Mr. Gage, I. J.
Truman, candidate for City Treasurer,
spoke. Judge Van Duzer spoke in behalf
of Julius Kahn and the Republican party.
It was shortly after 10 o'clock when Mr.
Gage entered the hall. His entrance was
the signal for an outburst of applause
that shook the building. Cheers and cries
of "Gage! Gage.' Gage!" rent the air, and
the crowd pressed so closely around him
In their efforts to grasp his hands that
it was with difficulty he was able to make
his way to the platform. As he stepped
forward the cheering and applause broke
out afresh, and it was five minutes befort
it subsided, and then just as Mr. Gage
started to speak some one in the audience
called for three cheers for Maguire. This
suggestion, which was made by some lone
individual, roused a perfect storm of
hisses. A Gage follower then shouted,
"Three cheers for Gage," and the cheer
ing broke out anew, and another five min
utes was spent by the crowd in welcoming
the next Governor of the State.
After thanking the crowd for Its kind
reception, Mr. Gage stated that the en
thusiasm with which he had been re
ceived showed him that the people of the
Potrero were awake to the issues of the
campaign and that they were not to be
deceived by the fallacies of Maguire or
his party.
Mr. Gage boldly made the prediction
that he would be the next Governor, and
he stated that he made to the people the
promise that he would administer the af
fairs of the State in a fair and impartial
manner, and that he would see that rich
and poor alike received common justice in
all matters that were within his juris
diction. At the conclusion of his speech
Mr. Gago was given a splendid ovation,
and as he left the hall he was cheered to
the echo.
F^LOOD TIDE
F*O R PATTO N
AND GAGE
The tide of popular approbation which
is surely carrying Henry T. Gage to the
Governorship of California swept through
the north end of the city last evening,
beginning with a rousing mass-meeting
In Apollo Hall, on Pacific street, near
Stockton. Like all the Republican meet
ings of the campaign, the hall was crowd
ed to Its full capacity with enthusiastic
citizens. Arrangements for the gathering
had been made by the Austrian-Slavonian
Republican Club. M. Sabadtn, president
of the organization, officiated as chair
man.
The chief attraction of the evening was,
of course, Henry T. Gage and Charles Lv
Patton, but interest in the entire muni
cipal ticket was shown by the fact that
all the voters present remained after the
leaders had left to listen to the remarks
of other speakers and candidates, and the

tioned. Julius Kahn, Tirey L. Ford, Leon
Dennery, J. Wade McDonald, FreS Lund
quist and T. B. O'Brien were on the pro
gramme.
Hon. Charles L. Patton was the first to
address the audience. He said: "I do
not intend to make an extended speech,
but as briefly as possible I shall state my
position on certain municipal matters
which are of the greatest interest and
moment to the people of this municipality.
The Republican convention adopted a
platform pledging its legislative candi
dates to support the new charter, which,
as you know, has been adopted by a ma
jority vote of our citizens. Now, whether
I am elected Mayor or not, I will do all
in my power to assist in putting the
charter into operation.
"I believe in the municipal ownership
of the gas and water supplies of our city
and other public utilities, which will be
possible under the provision of the new
charter. And until this is brought about
I believe the rate charged for these neces
sities should be regulated so that the cor
porations now conducting them would
realize 5 per cent on the capital actually
invested in the plant in actual operation.
"I believe in the dollar limit on an
assessed valuation of $850,000,000 of prop
erty, and thore is no reason why this
amount would not be sufficient to pay
the expenses of the city government. I
approve of the plank guaranteeing $2 as
a minimum for a day's wage on all city
contracts, and if elected I will see that
every agreement for municipal work con
tains that clause. I will be the people's
Mayor and not the creature of bosses."
Mr. Patton's declarations were received
with emphatic satisfaction by his audl-
ence, and he â was heartily cheered. Just
as he closed Henry T. Gage entered the
hall and was immediately recognized.
Some one shouted his name and a tumult
resulted. Upon being presented he spoke
for several moments in a felicitous vein,
saying:
"It Is not surprising that I. as one of
the representatives of the Republican
party, should receive this splendid re
ception at your hands, for this reason:
Your country has long been free, and
still remains unconquered. Your ances
tors battled for their freedom and you
are a worthy progeny. I came here to
night to make your acquaintance and pay
my respects which are due to you. The
Republican party la the party of free,
liberty-loving men, and I am glad to see
you marching beneath its standard.
"I predict a triumphant victory for the
grand old party on November 8, and I
promise you an economic, just and clean
administration."
Another rousing cheer greeted tho gub
ernatorial candidate as he left the hall to
proceed to other meetings.
The crowd remained and listened at
tentively to the remarks of T. B. O'Brien,
who urged the election of the straight Re
publican ticket. A number of local can
didates were also presented before ad
journment.
SUCCESSFUL
OPEN AIR
RECEPTION
The Republicans in the Forty-fifth Dis
trict honored Henry T. Gage. Charles L..
Patton and other prominent candidates
for high office on the State and munici
pal tickets last evening with an open air
reception at the corner of Battery and
Vallejo streets.
The demonstration of enthusiasm with
which the standard bearers were received
clearly showed that the citizens in this
section of the city are in favor and heart-
Ily indorse the men placed before them
by their party for their suffrages and
universal support. One of the features
of the reception was the appearance of
the Phoenix Republican Club, numbering
about seventy-five men, armed with
torches and dressed in uniforms consist
ing of white duck suits and caps of the
same material.
The chairman of the evening was Frank
Powers, who was specially chosen by the
members of the James M. Troutt Club,
under whose auspices the reception was
given, as the man best capable of plac
ing before the voters in the district the
true principles of Republicanism and ot
outlining their duty toward the party
which has done so much for them.
In Introducing the subject of the initial
address, and as a sort of prelude to Mr.
Powers' speech, he characterized McKin
ley's attitude in attempting to turn the
current of prosperity from the hands of
the rich into those of the poor, and there
by benefiting the entire country. In the
course of the address the rights and privi
leges which are now afforded the fisher
men under Republican administration
were outlined and emphasized.
Mr. Gage spoke in brief on the present
political crisis and its probable outcome
in a general and overwhelming: victory
for the Republican party. He spoke at
length on the many advantages the resi
dentsâparticularly the workingmen of
this sectionâ have received from the pure
and liberal administration of the Republi
cans.
"This part of the city is as good as
any," said the speaker, "and there is no
reason why this fact should not be gen
erally conceded. Some of you have too
long remained bound to an opposite party
that has done nothing for you but ex
tend its flatteries to procure your votes.
After this ia accomplished you and your
children are forgotten. You ask for cer
tain reforms, but your appeals are suf
fered to remain unanswered.
"It is generally understood and con
ceded by all that during the present ad
ministration of McKinley the country and
nation has gained a greater prestige
financially and otherwise than at any
time since the days of Abraham Lincoln.
Before Grover Cleveland was elected ho
told you, In order to obtain your suffrages,
RALLY IN THE OPEN AIR
that he would give you free trade. When
he waÂ» elected, however, he closed the
mills, the factories and crippled nearly
every industry at which you made your
living.
"For these national benefits and for the
good you yourselves have derived indi
vidually from the Republican party it is
your duty to vote for it and do all you
can to further the existence of its prin
ciples and uphold the noble and liberal
platform upon which it is grounded."
Charles L. Patton attd the prominent
candidates who express their sentiments
before the voters of this section of the
city followed in the main the course in
troduced by Gage.
OPEN-AIR
ASSEMBLY IN
THE POTRERO
The open air meeting held under the
auspices of the Republican County Com
mittee at Twentieth and Illinois streetÃ
last night was a success from every point
of view. Enthusiasm was manifested by
the vast assemblage from the time the
band grave the first toot until the last
speaker stepped from the platform, and
hundreds of stalwart workingmen, with
cheers for the Republican leaders, start
ed homeward.
The scene was most picturesque and in
spiring, and both speakers and audience
caught the spirit of the affair in a man
ner which augurs well for the ticket on
election day. If last night's meeting is
any criterion, the Republicans will carry
the Potrero by storm.
A speaker's stand was erected on Illi
nois street, near Twentieth, and bonfires
on adjacent corners cast a fitful light on
the faces of the throng. The air was
mild and balmy, and the little banks of
fog failed to dampen the ardor of the
auditors, who stayed almost to a man
until the meeting adjourned.
Edward T. Morris was chairman of the
evening and introduced the speakers in
turn. Julius Kahn, candidate for Con
gress in the Fourth District, was the first
speaker. He called attention to the good
administration of President McKinley
and the necessity of electing Republican
Congressmen and Senators to support
him throughout his administration. "It
is just about fifteen months since Mc-
Kinley was inaugurated," he said. "At
that time Coxey armies were tramping
from State to State and from city to city,
begging for work. With McKlnley came
a protective tariff, and Coxey armies. are
things of the past. Send good Republi
cans to Washington who will aid instead
of hamper him and you will have still
better times. You all remember how,
when a bond issue was found necessary
a short time ago, the bonds were sold to
foreign syndicates. In McKinley's time
a war loan was asked and he went right
out and asked the good American citizens
to loan the money. They did it, and will
do it again if necessary. We have no
need for the foreign syndicate, and the
Republican party is opposed to it."
Charles L. Patton made a brief address,
as his time was limited. He introduced
himself by sayins that he believed a can
didate should tell the people just what he
Intended doing If elected and then decide
whether they liked him or not. He said:
"I am in favor of the new charter, as 1
think it far ahead of the old consolidation
act under which we are working. I am in
favor of the municipal ownership of pub
lic utilities. The city can and should
own the gas, water and electric light
works, and perhaps In time the street
car lines. As for my candidacy,. I
have this to say: I am in this fight with
out party affiliations or pledges. I have
made no promises to political bosses of
either party; therefore I will neither be
obliged to break my word or hamper my
usefulness by catering to professional
politicians. I am In this fight to win, and
if elected will do my best to discharge the
duties of the office."
Short addresses were made by William
A. Deane, A. B. Treadwell, Asa R. Wells,
John D. Biebe, John B. Carson, Charles
W. Collins, J. B. Cole and Joseph E.
Barry. Jud^e Murphy was booked for a
speech, but was prevented from attending
by Illness.

HIS FRIENDS
WITH CHEERS
RECEIVE HIM
The audience which greeted Henry T.
Gage at B'nai B'rith Hall, 121 Eddy street,
last evening, was composed of his friends.
It packed the large hall to suffocation,
and was. perhaps, more representative in
its character than any other meeting
which has been held since the struggle for
Republican rights and principles, which
are synonymous with liberty and pros-
perlty, began. Business men were there;
so were their clerks.
The meeting: was conducted under the
auspices of the Associated League of
United Labor Clubs.
Henry T. Gage needed no introduction,
although formalities required that he
should be accorded one. Ine moment he
appeared in the hall the audience arose
and cheered him. It was several minutes
after he had been standing on the plat
form before the ovation ceased sufflciently
to permit him to commence his remarks.
In part he said:
"Mr. President, ladles and gentlemen:
This enthusiastic and magnificent demon
stration presages to my mind the ulti
mate success of the Republican party, In
this locality at least, and I am pleased to
say to you that I have just attended a
number of other meetings and have wit
nessed no less ardor anywhere.
"It is safe to predict that the Republi
can party will record the greatest victory
that it has ever known. The reasons of
this are obvious to my mind. I have stated
them many timesâ yes, thirty times before
audiences in this cityâ and it would seem
as if I had repeated them often enough.
I will therefore confine myself to a state
ment of what I will do If I am elected
Governor of California, and I will be
(applause) If the Republican party stands
true to the principles which mean the
redemption of the nation. If I bo Gov
ernor, let me inform you workingmen that
you will have a man who Is your friend
In the gubernatorial chair. Ido not speak
this with the spirit of a demagogue, but
I say that the beggar of the street, when
he comes to me to right his wrongs, will
receive the same consideration as the man
who lives under the roof of a palace. I
will conduct the affairs of my office In a
clean, fearless, business-like, economic and
honest manner, and will not be dominated
by corporate influence or permit my of
ficial acts to be swerved by fear, prejudice
or favor. My policy will be to do what is
just and right by my fellow-creatures.
(Great applause.)
"I am grateful to you for your friendly
greeting, but the Republican committee
has arranged for me to'address a number
of meetings this evening, many of which
are to follow this one, so I hope, my dear
friends, that you will excuse me and per
mit me to go forth and carry out the
mandates of my party."
Colonel Kowalsky followed Henry T.
Gage. He said that the Democratic party
was composed of two families in this city,
the Phelans and the Barrys; and of two
In the State, the Maguires and the Budds.
"They," he remarked, "are importing
a false issue in this campaign. They tell
you that the railroad Question is para
mount. But it is a lie. I appeal to you,
my people, and ask you the frank ques
tion, if this were the issue would it not
be safer to trust its solution to a man
who has been an anti-railroad man all his
life? And I know that he is. A few years
ago, when the Southern Pacific attempted
to rob me of valuable property in this
State, I searched throughout its bound
aries with much difficulty to secure an
attorney who would, like a man, appear
and fight a corporation Â»h my interest. I
found at length Henry T. Gage, and he
possesses to-day the same manly qualities
which commended him to me as an inde
pendent, honest citizen as he did then."
Tlrey I* Ford addressed the meeting
and mentioned the necessity of grasping
the golden opportunity which has been
laid before the people by the possession of
Oriental territoryâ that of making San
Francisco one of the greatest commer
cial ports in the world. This can be ac
complished by sending to Washington
men who are in accord with the adminis
tration, and who will assist it In pursu
ing the policy it has adopted. _
Julius Kahn was warmly welcomed, and
was followed by Dr. Hawkins, H. Q. Da
vis, A. B. Treadwell, W. H. Phelps and
Master Joseph Egan. The latter deliv
ered a decidedly fine speech and read aa
article from The Call stating that Phelan
had urged the gas companies to lower
their scale of wages. This article brought
down the house.
The people who passed in and out off
the hall were accosted by John A. Brown^
Democratic candidate for County Cleric^
who had resorted to that unique, little
boy-like and unprecedented means oft
furthering his chances of election bÂ»
standing in the doorway with a bunch of
his cards, peddling them to any one whoi
would take them.

GAGE TALKS
TO THE MEN

The laboring: men. upon whose brawny}

city, gave cordial greeting to Henry IV
Gage last night.
The nominee of- the Republican party?
for the governorship addressed the toil- 1
Ing sons from the workshops and from
the foundries, and was welcomed cordiaU
ly. The meeting was held in Drew's Hall,
New Montgomery street, near Howard,
and attracted an attendance too large for
the capacity of the hall.
Mr. Gage entered the auditorium while
W. F. Fitzgerald was speaking. The
man of the hour was recognized aÂ» he.
entered the hall, and a great cheer went
up from the assemblage. Mr. Fitzgerald
soon brought his remarks to a close in j
order to permit Mr. Gage to speak and
be off to the other throngs waiting to
greet him- "._ "â¢ 'â â â¢-â _.
He said in part: . "I thank yon for this
splendid reception Which you offer to the
principles of the Republican party. I
have traveled through fifty of the fifty
seven counties in this State since I last
addressed you from this platform. From
my observations during this pilgrimage
to the north and to the east and to the
south I saw everywhere the signs of a
glorious Republican victory at the polls
on Tuesday next. On that day the Re
publican party will record the grandest
triumph of the last quarter of a century.
"It is not necessary for me to talk to
you on the issues of the campaign. I will
speak to you as working men. If elected
to the governorshipâ and I am as certain
i will be elected as a human being can be
certain of anythingâ l will always guard
the interests of the working men. No
Governor, no officer has ever occupied
that position who was a truer friend to
labor than the man addressing 1 you. I
promise you a plain, economical, business
like administration. In ill matters re
quiring my attention I will give every in
dividual who seeks an audience with me
fair and hjst treatment. It will make no
difference how humble the life of a man
may be, he will be treated as well as the
head of the greatest corporation in the
State."
Mr. Gage then hastened away to keep
his appointments at other meetings.
W. F. Fitzgerald, at present Attorney
General of the State and candidate for
the office of City and County Attorney,
nwent down the list of Republican nor-
inees, reviewing their qualifications fo*
office. Some had records as faithful pub
lic servants in the past or were men of
standing in the business community. Ha
complimented the men who have been
named for both State and municipal of
fices. He drew a cheer from his auditors
when he spoke of Charles L. Patton,
nominee for Mayor, as "a manly, strong
hearted, straightforward fellowâ a man
who will: be a credit to the ciy and will bÂ«
a friend to the laboring man." (A voice,
"xnat's what he will!")
Mr. Fitzgerald said the Republicans
were pledged to press the ratification of
the new charter for this city before tha
next Legislature. He said that, the Dem
ocrats to the contrary, the charter wan
adopted by the votes of the Republicans
of this city. They also favor the public
ownership Of the utilities, water, gas and
street railway companies; white labor
and the use of California material orÂ»
all State work.
T. H. Selfage, Julius Kahn and other
orators addressed the meeting, while
Joseph Hanson. P. Flaherty and Mr.
Kepsner contributed campaign songs.
The meeting was. held under the auspices
of the Republican State , Central Commit
tee. J. J. Donohue acted as chairman and
H. D. Miller was secretary.

as â & candidate for the office to which
he now aspires. At that time the Ex

and other men-.identified with railrQad
interests. â¢.'"""â¢*.
The Examiner's opinion, of Slt. Bor
den's fitness for public office was â¢ ex
pressed in ah. editorial printed Septem
ber 28, 1896. Whether- its estimate was
at that tinie right- or wrong this paper
is not prepared to say. It was at that
time the Examiner's opLnion.
The times have changed, and the Ex
aminer can see no relation now between
Rhodes Borden and the railroad. He
is a nominee of tir. Phelan's Committee
of One Hundred, and as such the organ
of the' "hefting" boss can see no wrong
in him. The Examiner is thus ob
viously not waging a battle for prin
ciple, but for policy.
Here is the Examiner's estimate of
Rhodes Borden as expressed in its col
umns September 29, 1896. If it were true
, tkpt) it should be equally true to-day:
THE CONVENTION'S WORK.
The Non - Partisan convention
made its first mistafce last night in
putting the name of Rhodes Borden
on its official ticket. Mr. Borden
may be a most estimable gentleman
in private life. We are willing to
take the word of his friends for that.
His record in public life is colorless
and speaks neither for nor against
him. But when a man who is un
known comes before the public seek
ing office, it is inevitable . that he
should be judged by the. friends who
present his claims and urge his elec
tion. Among the friends who urge
Mr. Borden's election we find such
men as'T.B. Bishop, Joe Napthaly,
W. F. Herrin, Eugene Garberand the
rest of. the coterie that carry on poli
tics for the Southern Pacific Com
pany. As these men have never in
the â  past allowed their personal
friendship to interfere with their de
votion to corporation interests, their
advocacy is something to be ex
plained away.
The error of the convention is not
a capital one. It is an error that the
voters of the city can readily correct.
But if reminds the convention of the
need of extreme care in selecting the
other important "parts of the ticket.
The part of the ticket in which bad
influences are most to be feared, in
which they can act most harmfully
to the public interest, is in the selec
tion of candidates for Supervisors.
The men who manipulate politics for
the corporations will bend all their
energies to get a corrupt majority
into the next Board of Supervisors.
Tney will seek" to load down the Non-
Partisan ticket with purchasable
men, and it will take a most watch
ful care to keep them off. The mem
bers of the convention should re
member that as the charter stands
to-day an honest Board of Supervis
ors is worth all the rest of the city
government put together. It will be
of great importance even under the
new charter. If they succeed in pre
senting the citizens with a model
ticket in this regard they will have
performed a great public service.

nounced that the club has it m for a poli
tician who, it is alleged, has claimed to
carry the Bay street vote tucked snugly
away in his inside vest pocket.
Geo.- I-ovegTove, who is an independent
candidate for Supervisor in Mr. Church's
district, asserts that the organization is
supporting him, and all the while the offi
cers of the club are bitterly denouncing
one of Mr. Lovegrove's most ardent back
ers.
Alameda will send a big delegation to
the Talcott rally to-morrow night at Di
mond Canyon. The present Supervisor
from the Second District is making an ex
cellent fight for re-election and his friends
are daily becoming more confident of his â¢
success.
Interest in the local township fight con
tinues unabated. The Call's story this
morning: of the combination between
George Clark, Republican nominee for
Constable, and D. T. Hard, independent j
candidate for Justice, to defeat Henry
Morris, regular Republican nominee for j
Justice of the Peace, was the main topic
of discussion among the politicians, j
Clark's actions are condemned by Repub- i
licans and Democrats alike, who are now j
openly working against Clark and prom- â 
ise to .reprimand him severely at the I
polls for his disloyalty. Hard has cut no |
figure in the local fight. His candidacy is j
not looked upon with any degree of seri
ousness.
MEETING OF UNION FORCES.
Judge Maguire, Governor Budd and j
Other Democrats Will Speak

ion To-Night
The largest gathering of union forces,
both State and local, during the present
campaign, will be held to-night at Me
chanics' Pavilion.
Judge William P. Lawlor, chairman of
the union campaign committee, has per
fected elaborate arrangements for the
exercises of the evening. The Democrats
arid others will be reminded of the dem
onstration by the firing of a salute of fifty
guns. This will commence at 7 o'clock.
It will summon the clubs to form and
move on the Pavilion from their respec
tive headquarters.
Judge Maguire will return in due season
for the meeting, from the north. Before
going to the Pavilion he will address a
meeting at Sailors' Hall, Mission and
East streets. Walter Macarthur will pre
side. Mr. Maguire will then proceed to
the Pavilion under escor* of the uniformed
corps of the Democratic Central Cluu.
The following speakers will address the

Patton Club Meets.
The Patton Republican Club met last
evening at its clubrooms at 148 Sixth
street, with the president. W. T. Burke,
presiding. The chairman impressed upon
the members the necessity for lots of
good, hard work for Gage and the whole
Republican ticket during the rest of the
campaign, and he made an especial ap
peal on behalf of Frank Murasky for Su
perior Judge. James Lawlor presented
the name of Henry S. Martin, and the
club gave its unanimous indorsement to
his candidacy for Sheriff. Indorsement
and three cheers were also given Ed
Algeltlnger, who is running for Super
visor from the Twelfth Ward.
Judge Louderback. I
A reform in tne administration of
justice is needed, and it can best be
accomplished by a change of Judges.
Those who want a stop put to the sys
tem of jury frauds and professional
Jurors and the courts raised above cor
poration control and political interfer
ence are supporting Judge Davis
Louderback for Judge of the Superior
Court. His judicial record is that of a
conscientious and independent Judge.
He is an able jurist of extensive ex
perience, whose usefulness on the Su
perior Court bench would be of public
benefit.
Martin Club Jinks.
The H. 8. Martin Club of the Forty
fourth District met last evening at Kear
ney's Hall with E. J. Ford in the chair.
The meeting was held for the purpose of
arranging for the club jinks to be held
to-morrow evening at Apollo Hall, 810 Pa
cific Btreet. Speeches were made by M.
H Barry. M. Smith, E. Lunstedt, G. G.
Bolsson and J. H. Nelson.
THE SAIST FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 1898.
THE HARP WITH BUT A SINGLE STRING.
FINLAY COOK DEFEATED.
Biggy Will Not Have to Beprlnt
Sample Ballots.
Finlay Cook, the Democratic and Non-
Partisan nominee for Police Judge, re
ceived a setback yesterday at the hands
of the Justices of the Supreme Court.
Mr. Cook on examining the sample ballot
sent out to the voters of the city by
Registrar Biggy, found that the indorse
ment by the Non-Partisans had been
omitted and he . was very angry. He
called upon the Registrar and demanded
that an entirely new lot of sample ballo'-.a
he, printed and sent out. Mr. Biggy said
that he couid not see his way clear to
comply with Mr. Cook's demand. In the
first place the time would not permit, and
again the cost of printing about 65,000 of
these big papers would cost more than
the office of Police Judge is worth. Mr.
Cook appealed to the Election Commis
sioners, Put with no better results.
Yesterday he thought of the Supreme
Court and in a little time be had a peti
tion for a writ of mandate to compel the
Registrar to print a new lot of sample
ballots containing the name of Cook.
Democratic candidate with Non-Partisan
indorsement. The higher court quickly
disposed of the matter by denying the
writ, without prejudice, to proceedings in
the Superior Court in tfie same matter.
Affiliated Republican Clubs Meet.
The Affiliated Republican Clubs and the
Republican parade committee held a
meeting last evening In the Union League
Club rooms at the Palace, A. O. Perkins
presiding. Thirty-one clubs were repre
sented ,and full arrangements were made
for a mass-meeting, in conjunction with
the State Central Committee, at Wood
ward's Pavilion to-morrow night. The

GAGE CONFIDENT OF A GREAT
VICTORY FOR REPUBLICANISM
From the Enthusiasm Manifested He Predicts an
Overwhelming Majority for the Entire Ticket.
HENRY T. GAGE, Republican nominee for Governor, has finished
his tour of the interior counties and is confident that a great
Republican victory will be won next Tuesday. He arrived in
the city Tuesday night from San Jose and Santa Cruz, where he
addressed immense audiences. He addressed three meetings in this
city Wednesday night and eight last night. So far he has met every
engagement made for him by the Republican State Central
Committee.
Speaking of the outlook last evening he said the enthusiasm
everywhere manifested and the large audiences that assembled to
hear the issues of the day discussed convinced him that the Re
publican triumph next Tuesday would be one of the greatest ever
achieved in California. He said he based his Judgment in this re
spect on diligent inquiry made during his tour of the State from
San Diego to Shasta. He observed the people, and especially the
farmers and miners were deeply concerned on the subject of single
tax, and believed that many voters who formerly acted with the
Democratic and Populist parties would vote next Tuesday with the
Republicans to defeat the fusion scheme of single tax. While Mr.
Gage did not care to make estimates concerning his own majority
he predicted the success of the entire Republican ticket and expressed
the opinion that Jacob Neff's majority would exceed 40,000.
Politics in the Thirty-First.
A large and enthusiastic meeting of the
citizens of the Thirty-first Assembly Dis
trict was held last evening at Teutonla
Hall. The meeting was called to order
by P. H. Kerrigan, who acted as chair
man, and was assisted in his dutieÃ by
L,ouls Berger and J. F. Goodwin, who
acted as secretaries. Addresses were
made by P. H. Kerrigan, H. Bernard,
Charles Curry, William Deane, Martin
Fragley. Thomas Brophy, H. Byrne, J.
J. Harrigan and others.
Thomas E. Brophy was Indorsed in his
candidacy for the Assembly, and those
who were present resolved to make a
strong canvass in his interests. Every
thing points to his success on Tuesday.
Deane, Curry and Fragley were alÃo
given the Indorsement of the meeting and
adjournment was taken amid rousing
cheers for the ticket.
AT GREGGIN'S HALL.
The Orators Closing Up Their Cam-
paign South of Market Street.
Greggln's Hall, on Sixth and Shipley
streets, contained a goodly number of the
voting population of that portion of the
section known as the south of Market
street last night, all of whom assembled
to hear such of the Democratic orators
as contained vocal power enough to make
themselves heard above a whisper.
Dr. Dodge was about the only speaker
that aroused the audience out of Its leth
argic condition by his scathing remarks
on his opponent's method of "not" as
sessing corporations and banks. It was
expected that Hefting Jimmy would show
up and give a last parting rally to his
tens of thousands of political enemies be
fore his demise on next Tuesday, but up
to 10 o'clock Jimmy had not shown up,
and at that hour the audience got sleepy
and left the hall. The following-named
light-weights made their last speech In
Greggln's Hall for the '98 campaign:
Judge Rhodes, Burden, James Denman,
William Hinton, Finlay Cook, Hull Mc-
Claughery, R. P. Doolan, Isador Gutte,
Dr. T. B. Leland. Edward Hanrahan. Wil
liam G. Burke and George H. Cabaniss.
The honor of presiding at the meeting fell
to J. Farrell, who performed his part well.
Indorsed Kahn and Curry.
Potrero Hall was crowded on Tuesday
evening with the members of the J. A.
Hoey Club, who had turned out to talk
over plans for the last few days of tne
campaign and to indorse their favorite
candidates. Julius Kahn, Charles F.
Curry. W. A. Deane, Henry Martin and
Ed Algeltinger (who is out for the Super
visor's chair for the Twelfth Ward) were
all given the sanction of the olub in strong
speeches by different members. The offi
cers of the club are: President, Charles

PREMONITION
OF VICTORY
FOR GAGE
Republican Commit
tee Confident.
AN HONEST COUNT ASSURED
CERTAINTY OF TSrOTIPH DOES
NOT DIMINISH WORK.
Major Frank , McLaughlin Restored
to Health â Returns to Ac
tive Duty at Head
quarters. . "
In political campaigns one of the dan
gers is over-confldence: ' The leaders in
the Republican cause In this campaign aje
confident that Henry T. G*age .â¢ will be
elected next Tuesday, but they have not
permitted that, feeling of confidence '4n
the outcome of the balloting- to diminish
their efforts to" bring out.t"he full voting
strength of the party. ' â¢"
Major Frank Mclaughlin, chairman of
the Republican State Committee, returned
from Santa Crufc last evening, much im
proved in health and strength, and Is now
on active duty at headquarters. He and
his associates in- the management of the
campaign appreciate the fact that the
law provides for an honest count of the
ballots, but they will take measures to
assist the election, authorities to enforce
the law. Assurance is given that the
ballots' cast next Tuesday wBl be hon
estly counted. Special care will be taken
that the will of the people shall not be
thwarted by crooked work in the count.
The managers of the campaign at Re
publican headquarters are confident of the
election of Gage and Keff "and the entire
Republican ticket. Estimates as to the
probable result have been obtained from
each county in the State, but ihe figures
have not been given out for publication.
In many respects political campaigns
are conducted in California according to
old-fashioned methods. There is not an
actual canvass of each precinct of the
State to determine how each elector will
vote, but there is general inquiry in every
precinct. In Ohio, Indiana and other
States the canvass in advance is so thor
ough that the State committee is able to
forecast the result within 500 votes. In
time California committees will reject ob
solete methods and adopt modern forms
of conducting a political campaign.
â¢ From a general talk with committeemen
The Call ascertains that the committee
expects that Gage's majority will exceed
15,000. Early in the campaign it was
thought that Masrulre would get 5000 or
6000 majority in San Francisco, but now
many Republicans believe that Gage may
carry this city.
The most encouraging reports are re
ceived from Southern California. Middle
of the Road Populists and sound money
Democrats are daily deserting the fusion,
cause. The great surprise of the cam
paign may be the magnitude of the Re
publican majorities.
DOES NOT KNOW THAT
TARPEY IS A CANDIDATE
W. W. FOOTE DENIES SUPPORT
ING HIM FOB SENATOR.
Was Never Present at Any Caucus
of Democrats When the Mat
ter Was Broached.
It was stated in an afternoon paper
yesterday that M. F. Tarpey of Alameda
was a candidate for the "United States
Senate. It was also affirmed that Gov
ernor Budd, W. TV. Foote and other In
fluential Democrats had met in caucus
and had determined to support his can
didacy. The paper stated that Governor
Budd advanced the cause of Mr. Tarpey,
who, while not satisfactory to Mr. Foote,
was finally accepted by that gentleman.
When shown the published statement
last night Mr. Foote said:
"This is quite a surprise to me, as I
have attended no such caucus with Gov
ernor Budd or any one else. I did not
know and do not now know that Mr. Tar
pey is a candidate for the United States
Senate. I have neither advocated nor op
posed his claims. I had supposed that it
the Republicans lost the next Legislature
that Mayor Phelan would be the logical
man for the Senatorship.
"Never until I saw the article .in the
Post did I suppose Mr. Tarpey was a
candidate. From my long association
with Mr. Tarpey in Democratic politics I
believe that if he were a candidate for
this office he would have notified me him
self. As he has not done so I assume, of
course, that he is not a candidate.
"I have seen Mr. Tarpey but once since
the Democratic State convention, and he
did not then Intimate to me that he was
a candidate for the United States Sen
atorship or any other office."
Swiss Society Indorsements.
At a regular meeting of the Swiss Union
Society, held at 315 Pacific street last
evening, at which William G. Camoxzl
presided, the following candidates on the
State ticket were indorsed: Secretary of
State, Charles F. Curry; State Printer, A.
J. Johnson.
On the municipal ticket John D. Siebe.
through the efforts of Eugene Valente,
was especially indorsed for Assessor, and
the whole or the Republican municipal
ticket was given the society's approval.
Oscar C. Lewis made an eloquent ad
dress on behalf of Charles F. Curry, and
Eugene Valente, by a brilliant eulogy,
gained for A. J. Johnson the indorsement
of the society.
Charles L. Jenks Dead.
The friends of Charles L. Jenks were
shocked yesterday to learn of his sudden
death from pneumonia in Chicago, 111.
Mr. Jenks was for many years a resident
of San Francisco. Thirteen years ago he
removed to Chicago, where he has since
been acting manager of his father's in
terests. He was a brother of Livingston
Jenks.
The Oakland Laid Up.
OAKLAND. Nov. 3.â The Southern Pa
cific Company's ferry steamer Oakland Is
laid up for repairs. On one of her early
trips from San Francisco to-night the
steering gear and some of her machinery
became disabled, and she was temporarily
withdrawn from the broad-gauge run and
steamed up alongside the pier. _

LOOK OUT FOR THE ROORBACK-
WITH the closing days of the campaign the
risoal Democratic roorback is due. The gen
eral public is so familiar with that. form of dem
agogue trickpry it is not likely any great evil will re
suit from the roorback when it comes, and yet it is
just as well for the. voters to be on guard.
The situation of the Democratic managers is so
desperate that some" audacious stroke to deceive the
unwary and to catch fools may be expected at any
-time- The effort of the -Phelanites to win the inde
pendent vote has failed, the attempt to buy with one
third the patronage of the., city the Rainey push has
"failed, the struggle to get self-respecting Democrats
to. -'rally to the support of a ticket nominated by a self
constituted; Committee of One Hundred job-chasers
has failed. There is but one resource leftâ Phelan is
defeated unless a large number of voters can be
stampeded at the last moment by the promulgation of
some extravagant lie.
./ .From the beginning the fused factions have made
.their campaign in the city and through the State by
incessant misrepresentations, humbug and downright
"falsehoods. The managers and the candidates of the
party from Maguire down have dodged every genuine
issue at stake in the contest and have sought some
times to elude the vigilance of the people by the si
lence of a sneak canvass, commonly known as a "still
â¢ bunt," and sometimes to frighten them with a buga
boo accompanied by a hideous discord of whoops,
hoots and yells.
. -Such a party is ready for the launching of a roor
back, and the situation prompts them to produce
one. It may.be postponed until Monday, the last day
of: the canvass, but it may come sooner. At any rate
the people should be on the lookout for it.
The real issues of the campaign have all been clearly
stated to the voters, and the characters of all the can
didates are. now well known. Any new story sprung
at this time is very" apt to be false. The public, there
fore, must not. be misled if a. series of interviews
should be- published in .the Examiner with ColHs P.
Huntingtbn- the Spanish Prime Minister and the
Emperor. ; of. China,- iii which each of those dignitaries
will be made to declare a' desire for the defeat of Ma
guire and Phelan in order that California may be
made permanently subject to the Southern Pacific,
annexed t-q Spain and opened to Chinese immigration
through' the success of the Republican party.
ATTORNEY NEUBERGER'S NOSE.
THERE are few occasions on which a nose be
comes of particular interest save to the owner.
One, of these is when a race is won by it, a
second when it ispolced into other people's affairs,
and a third when it. finds its way between a hostile
.thumb and finger and is subjected to the pang of
being tweaked.
The claim has been set up that Moses Gunst has
tweaked the nose of Attorney Neuberger, with intent
to clinch a political argument. Such episodes be
tween gentlemen might be passed over ordinarily,
â¢ out the position held by Gunst in this community
makes ignoring of the incident dereliction of duty.
He i> a Police Commissioner, who spends much time
in Europe studying how to patrol Bernal Heights
artistically, the ethics of the locust club, and the
amount of food needed by- a department horse.
When he sails, admirers say, "Mose Gunst has went."
Upon his return they herald the glad tidings from
sea to sea â "Mose Gunst has came." Therefore so
serious a matter as his pulling a nose other than his
own becomes a municipal, if not a national, concern.
We do not "hesitate to say that Mr. Gunst, if he did
this, was hasty. H* ought, for the sake of dignity â
providing, of course, the organ was really reprehen
sible â have ordered a policeman to do the work.
Then he could have had the policeman on the carpet,
fined him and paid the fine. There would have been
satisfaction, but no distressing scandal.
A complication arises from the allegation of Mr.
. Nsuberger that the nose was not pulled, tweaked,
pinched or otherwise maltreated. He was on the
spot with the nose and ought to be qualified to judge.
Of course there were no disinterested witnesses. When
such events are to be observed everybody who hap
pens to see is interested. Probably, still enveloped
in mystery, the episode will go thundering down the
ages.
A visitor from Oregon complains bitterly that he
was charged $20 for a bottle of wine. The reason he
was charged this sum was doubtless that he had no
more coin about him. Some people do not seem to
know when to felicitate themselves.
Whatever sacrifice may justly be required of an
American soldier in tinre of war, it is beyond reason
that-tre should be expected during peace to eat bacon
made displeasing by the presence of worms.
Cubans will never consent to having their swords
beaten into pruning hooks. Some impertinent for
eigner might venture to inquire why they did not use
the hooks.
MAGUIRE AND LAND CONFISCATION.
IN his Napa speech, and in other speeches, Maguire
says that he will not discuss land confiscation by
the single tax with Mr. Gage, because Mr. Gage
does not understand the subject.
We think Judge Maguire is mistaken. Not only
Mr. Gage, but all men who can read, understand that
subject very clearly. Judge Maguire's voluminous
exposition of it has left no chance for any misunder
standing. True, he has infused into his exposition a
great deal of abusive invective. He has called land
owners monopolists, robbers, schemers, and has
charged upon them thÂ« guilt of all the poverty and
sorrow and crime in the country, and to trace their
guilt in all this to their buying land instead of per
sonal property may be something hard to compre
hend, but that has nothing to do with the issue it
self. It is merely the Maguire way of making an ar
gument to prove the rightfulness of land confiscation.
The issue is that confiscation itself, not the atgument
made to sustain it.
In his speech to the Single Tax Club of St. Louis,
published in "The National Single Taxer" for Decem
ber 15, 1897, volume 6, No. 46, Judge Maguire said:
"We propose to do away with all vested rights and
titles and ownership in land, and raise the public rev
enue from land rental."
There is nothing intricate nor hard to understand
about that. The argument to sustain it may be com
plex and involved and difficult to understand, but the
statement of the thing itself is perfectly plain.
When Judge Maguire was asked within a few days,
"If you are elected Governor will you use your best
endeavors to have the single tax embodied in the con
stitution and laws of this State?" he answered, "I will
not answer yes or no."
Having stated the purpose of the single tax to be
the "doing away with all vested rights and titles and
ownership in land," he refuses to answer yes or no
when asked if he will promote that policy as Gov
ernor. All this is perfectly plain. Every land-owner
has a vested right and title to his land. He has a right
to know whether Maguire will try, as Governor, to
take it away from him, and Maguire refuses to say
that he will not try to destroy the vested rights, titles
and ownership of land.
This makes the issue perfectly plain. Every land
owner in California who sees this comprehends it
perfectly. Mr. Gage needs no illumination from Ma
guire's argument to understand it. The matter is so
plain that explanation can only darken it. Maguire
says what he proposes to do; he says, "We propose
to destroy all vested rights, title and ownership to
land." Those who want to do this should vote for
him, as they will. The holders of the endangered
vested rights and titles, the owners of land, should
not vote for him.
He seeks votes by attacking the railroad. The sins
of the Southern Pacific might be as scarlet, but we
ask the people of California, in all calmness and
soberness of mind, if those sins as stated by Maguire
are facts, what damage have they inflicted upon the
people at all comparable to the blight that will fall
upon the State by instant and complete destruction of
all vested rights and titles and ownership of land?
Henry George says the moment the single tax is
made operative land becomes worth nothing, "the
community would get the tax, the owner would get
nothing."
This is a burning issue. It cannot be trifled with.
The Call has persistently presented it in Maguire's
own language, and his only answer is that he will not
promise not to promote land confiscation as Gov
ernor. All men who know him know that he will
promote it, that all of the influence of the Governor's
office will be used to effect it. All men know that his
election will stimulate the men who believe in land
confiscation and will solidify and encourage them to
move on the unfortunate land-owner to destroy his
vested right, title and ownership.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE.
AMONG the offices at stake in this contest which
the Republican party must win in order to as
sure a thoroughly efficient administration at
Sacramento is that of Secretary of State. The duties
of the Secretary are many, and are of grave respon
sibility. It is, therefore, important that a Republican
Governor should have in the State Office a stanch
Republican to co-operate with him.
For this office the Republicans have nominated
Charles F. Curry, a man who is well known as one of
the most earnest and loyal Republican workers in the
State. Born in Illinois in 1858, he came to San Fran
cisco with his family in 1873, and, with the exception
of two years spent in Washington, has ever since
been a resident of this city.
He has always taken a keen interest in public af
fairs and in politics. In 1887 he was elected to the
General Assembly from this city, and, although that
was his first term of legislative experience, he was
chosen chairman of the San Francisco Assembly
delegation. In 1894 he was made Republican nominee
for County Clerk, and such was his personal popular
ity that he was elected, notwithstanding the fact that
it was a Democratic year and most of the municipal
offices were filled by the candidates of that party.
It will be seen from this record that Mr. Curry has
had ample experience in public service. He has
borne official responsibility and is not an unknown
man. His party loyalty has never been questioned,
and he merits the support of the party throughout the
State.
THE MAN FOR ADMINISTRATOR.
ONE of the strongest nominations made by the
Republicans was that of J. A. Drinkhouse to
be Public Administrator. From the first
there seemed to be no doubt as to the election of
Mr. Drinkhouse, but throughout the campaign he
has gathered support so rapidly that his victory gives
every indication of being overwhelming.
There is no position in which the requirements of
honesty and executive ability are more absolute than
in that of Administrator. This official must handle
vast interests, often concerning heirs who are at a
distance. It falls to him to protect the widow and
the orphan. No one in whom the public did not
have the utmost confidence would ever be intrusted
with the duties of this place, nor even receive a nom
ination at the hands of the Republican party.
The candidate is known in business circles as the
head of the great J. A. Drinkhouse Tobacco Com
pany, established in 1850, and now located at Sacra
mento and Battery streets. Aside from a high stand
ing in the commercial world, he is esteemed for per
sonal qualities, and known to take a generous inter
est in all matters of public concern. In his long rec
ord there has been no stain. He will carry into
office the same characteristics which in private life
have won success. So popular is Mr. Drinkhouse
that, unsolicited, he has received the indorsement of
clubs embracing a membership of over 3000. Each
acquaintance is a friend and an active supporter.
Not only has the candidate these advantages, but
the weakness of his opposition leaves him little to
overcome. He is sure to receive the full party vote
and the votes of many Democrats.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 1898.
MAKE IT fl COMPLETE ROUT.
WITH the closing days of the campaign comes
the critical period of the political contest.
During these days, therefore, all good citizens
should take an active part in the canvass against the
factions of discontent and make their defeat a com
plete and overwhelming rout.
The course of the contest up to this time assures
a Republican victory all along the line. The san
guine boasts of the factions that nominated Maguire
have been turned to yells of desperation. Maguire
himself is more busily engaged in dodging his single
tax and sandlot record than in discussing the issues
of the time, and his followers are equally demoralized.
Mr. Gage has increased in strength as the canvass
has proceeded. His character, his record, his plat
form and his method of conducting the campaign
have alike merited and won the favor of the people,
and now, if all earnest citizens will unite to bring out
the full vote of the conservative masses of the people,
Maguireism and all other "isms" associated with it
will be eliminated from State politics for the rest of
this generation.
In the Congressional districts the same promise of
Republican victory is seen. The people understand
that in the election of Representatives the chief issue
is that of supporting the administration, and that the
time has come for California to stand by the Phesi
dent, to uphold him in the great policies that tend to
domestic prosperity, and in the settlement of the com
plex foreign problems growing out of the war with
Spain.
Fully understood, too, is the importance of electing
a Legislature which will return a Republican to the
United States Senate, which will carry out reforms
needed in State affairs, and guard against the folly of
single tax schemes and other vagaries of the represen
tatives of the "ists," the "ites" and the survivors
of the sandlots.
In the city campaign Phelan and gang, who
thought themselves invincible, have been completely
demoralized by the strength of popular sentiment in
favor of Patton. After trying in vain to catch the in
dependent Republican vote the Phelanites have now
turned to Rainey and his push and have promised
them one-third of the patronage of the city and
county in return for votes. It is the last play of a
desperate political gamester, and can have no other
effect than that of opening the eyes of independent
Republicans to the true character of Phelan, and giv
ing them a right understanding of his hypocrisy and
falseness.
Throughout the field, therefore, there is promise of
victory. Now is the time to press the demoralized
foe. The vicious and unscrupulous demagogues who
have risen to power in the Democratic and Populist
parties, and who have used those organizations to
advance their personal ambitions, who have made a
campaign that threatens every industry and every in
terest, should be utterly driven out of politics.
Good Democrats and good Populists should unite
with Republicans in this effort for the redemption of
their own parties. It will work for the benefit of all
thrifty and law-abiding citizens without respect to
party to unite with the Republicans in this issue and
win a great popular victory for the administration, for
good government in the State, and for honest politics
in the city.
THE second number of Boss Fitch's esteemed
Non-Partisan is upon our desk. The publica
tion is more than usually interesting this week.
It contains: A hopeful article on the acquisition
of the Philippines, in the course of which the writer
argues that unless the Phelan gang is elected on Tues
day our brilliant prospects in the Orient will be
dimmed; several attacks on the bosses and "corrup
tionists," the identity of the latter being concealed
under a strong appeal to vote for Phelan and his
Mexican candidate for District Attorney; a card
from a merchant telling why he is a Non-Partisan,
which bears the earmarks of the Deacon himself; an
editorial laudatory of dollar limit parsimony and real
estate booms, and various small assaults on Kelly,
Crimmins, Rainey, Harney and other bosses who are
not named.
This issue of the Non-Partisan comprises four
pages of closely printed matter. We have searched
through it carefully for the purpose of discovering
some reference to Mayor Phelan's offer to trade
one-third of his patronage to Rainey and Harney for
their votes. Apparently Editor Fitch is entirely
oblivious to that interesting incident. Nowhere in
his paper does he mention it. He prints a number
of biographies of the candidates whose patronage
the Mayor offered to barter, and in all of them ' x he
speaks in glowing terms of how efficient these men
would be if elected; yet he neglects to state his
opinion of their efficiency with Harney and Rainey
men as subordinates.
We are not disposed to regard this omission as an
oversight. Deacon Fitch knew when he put his
paper to press that Phelan's offer was being consid
ered by Rainey; that is, he knew it unless he had
ceased to read the newspapers. The Call published
full particulars of the negotiations last week, and we
have reason to believe that he reads this paper. He
read it when he used to run it, and certainly it is a
better paper and more readable now than it was then.
What does Deacon Fitch mean by ignoring in his
publication this important development of "reform"
politics? Does he want the people to think he fa
vored the bargain with Rainey and is discomfited
because it could not be consummated? Two-thirds
of the ticket he is supporting wa^ nominated by
Phelan, and if it is elected one-third of the patronage
within the control of its candidates would, under the
proposition of Phelan, have been turned over to Boss
Rainey. Are we to understand that Mr. Fitch fa
vored this combination and that he was willing
Rainey and Harney, in return for their votes, should
have one-third of the municipal patronage?
We trust that in the next issue of the Non-Partisan
the Deacon will devote an article to* this subject.
Sixty thousand voters are panting to know how the
Non-Partisans reconcile their professions of reform
with Phelan's latest manifestation of political
"purity."
We venture the guess that there are on the Pacific
at this moment as seasick a lot of soldiers as ever
sailed from this port. Most of the Tennessee troops
had never seen salt water until they came here, and
many of them suffered qualms while crossing the bay
from Oakland.
Careful study of official reports of the destruction of
Cervera's fleet tend to show that each vessel of the
American fleet did a little more work than any other.
It is a great fleet.
Esterhazy is said to ha\*e gone into the business of
blackmailing, and there is hope that he may be suc
cessful to the extent of getting into a strong and
commodious jail.
While residents of undesirable resorts are being
crowded off certain streets, morality must not felici
tate itself upon the belief that they are being crowded
off the earth.
A STRANGE OMISSION.
COUNTING THE COST.
NUMBER THIRTEEN.
Editor Call: The plain citizen is not accustomed to take people at
their own valuation of themselves. You and I judge them not by their
words, but by their actions. We have inspected certain portions of Mr.
Phelan's record and we are not satisfied. We have seen him agitate for
good government when good government meant his own election. We have
seen him drop good government like a hot coal when he thought that good
government might cost him the support of a few. Mr. Phelan's dealings
with the charter question were inspired by the desire to help himself and not
to help the charter. For that reason we are justified in suspecting that all his
tactics now tend not to the good of the people, but to the good of Mr. Phelan.
MR. PHELAN'S ARDENT SUPPORTERS
Are never tired of pointing to the new pavement on Market street as a
proof of his public spirit and as a result of his good government. The
plain citizen is no doubt delighted that Market street is paved. But in the
midst of his delight he asks himself who is benefited thereby and who is
paying for it. When the streets near your lot or mine are to be paved or
improved you and I have to go down into our pockets to pay for the as
sessment. But Market street is an accepted street The improvements on
Market street do not come out of the pockets of the property-owners; they
are paid for by the city, that is, by the plain people, by you and by me.
The property-owners on Market street are nearly all millionaires. They
could stand the assessment on their property far more easily tha\i we can
stand the assessments on our property. Yet where the plain citizen has to
pay his own money the millionaire is able to tap the city treasury.
Of course the plain citizen benefits in some way by the repaying of Mar
ket street. But the chief benefit of the noiseless pavements accrues to the
great property-holders with the big buildings, and chief among these prop
erty-holders is Mr. Phelan himself.
BUT THEN MR. PHELAN
Has laid down the pavement in front of his own building at his own ex
pense. It is true that the pavement laid down in front of the Phelan building
is said to be laid at Mr. Phelan's expense. But the plain person who has
ever taken the trouble to look at the real estate map knows that the Phelan
building is not the only holding of the Phelan estate on the improved area of
Market street. The Phelan pavement is an experiment, an advertisement.
The use of the streets for advertising purposes may be as valuable as the
use of the streets for railroad purposes. Mr. Phelan receives this use for the
expense of putting down the patent pavement, and the plain citizen â that
is, you and Iâis1 â is very anxious to know just how much interest Mr. Phelan
has in the new pavement and what are his holdings in the company that con
trols it.
IN THE LONG RUN
Everything comes from the plain people, from you and from me. When rich
men improve their property we pay for it. The plain citizen may well stop
and think what has the paving of Market street cost. Mr. Phelan is an
ardent advocate of a low tax levy. If the city is to make such extensive and
elaborate improvements as the paving of Market street ,the city must stand
the expense. If the expense is not provided for in the tax levy some depart
ment of the municipal government must suffer. And what department does
suffer? Of course that which has the least influence. The poor people in
the City and County Hospital have no pull, and the poor people in the City
and County Hospital have been robbed Dy Mr. Phelan in order to improve
Mr. Phelan's property and the property of rich men like Mr. Phelan.
FOR YEARS THESE TWO PROJECTS
Have been before the people, the repaying of Market street and the building
of a decent hospital for the sick poor. If the two projects are to be carried
out plain people like you and me expect to pay for them. Mr. Phelan's
campaign cry of a low tax levy makes it impossible to carry out the two
projects simultaneously. One must be dropped. The plain citizen, like you
and me, would have no difficulty in making the choice. You and I may be
come poor and sick. While we are strong we pay our taxes as an assurance
that the city will take care of us when we are helpless. Every one knows
how the sick poor are housed now. Therefore our own interest, our natural
sympathy, would lead us to let Market street go and build suitable accommo
dations for the sick.
Mr. Phelan has not been bad to the poor. He has built a library for
them at the Almshouse. Plain people are pleased that he has done so. But
the limitations of Mr. Phelan's character and the lack of sound sense in his
policy manifest themselves in the nature of his gifts. A library at
the Almshouse is as useful as a silk hat to a shipwrecked sailor.
The people need more for their bodies than for their minds. Still Mr. Phe
lan's intentions were good, even though they are carried out with the
charming inconsequence of Mrs. Jellaby.
But with the City and County Hospital Mr. Phelan's policy has resulted
in a grievous wrong. No doubt without meaning it the sick poor have been
sacrificed to the demands of the rich owners of Market street frontage.
Every time the plain citizen looks on that pavement he remembers the cost.
It is a black border that tells of neglected deathbeds and the pauper's grave
The noiseless passage of the vehicles reminds you and me of the hush of the
funeral and the quiet of the dead. Mr. James D. Phelan has repaved Market
street and the price has been paid in the sore distress of the sick and poor

EUGENE LOUD'S
GOOD WORK
Editor of Call: I take much interest
in the pending campaign. I notice the
press and speakers representing that
party to which I belong have failed, it
seems to me, to give adequate empha
sis to the good work our member of
Congress from the Fifth District, Hon.
E. F. Loud, has given to the country
while he has been our representative.
While looking out upon Market street
and noticing those white cars (mes
sengers of peace or war) speeding along
that we who live away from the center
of the town may get our mail before we
start out for our daily work; this was
brought about by him.
I received a letter the other day from
a farmer who lives some five miles from
his postofflce, saying, "We have the
first mall delivery to-day. Think it a
grand success." These are the acts
that tend more than almost any others
to make a farmer boy contented with
his vocation, and acquaints him with
the affairs of his country by enabling
him to get the daily paper.
All our prosperity comes from the
soil, and those who cultivate it are our
benefactors. So all credit should be
paid to him who makes this isolated life
more enjoyable. This was all brought
about by our member. His labors in
and out of session and season have
been earnest and zealous to reform our
postal laws to the end that private and
incorporate advertisers' greed should
not so weigh down the mails, as they
have heretofore done, that really
beneficent service for the public good
has to be often dropped.
The speculative uses of the mails are
a crying evil that our member has suc
ceeded in abating so far as that branch
of Congress could to which he has been
accredited.
The first step a man oÂ£ good common
sense takes when he wants to employ a
member of any profession or engage a
person to manage the affairs of a cor
poration In which he has an interest is
to select some one that will guard well
his Interest and bring it to success.
Equally so should the voter exert liis
best Judgment in selecting his repre
sentative. It would take a new man
and an able one five years to equip
himself for the usefulness of our pres
ent member. To what sad end would
our greet corporations come should
they change their manager every two
years.
The only objection I hear to Mr. Loud
is he has not "suavlter in mode," says
a public speaker. "Do you want to send
a dancing master to Congress?" he
added. Let us have the man of level
head and untiring industry.
Few voters, I fear, fully appreciate
the difficulties that are coming with a
proper settlement of the questions
growing out of our late war. Wo wtiU
remember the bitterness that was en
gendered by the debates upon the re
constructive measure after the Civil
War, when the President was brought
to the bar. of the Senate and tried for
Impeachment, and now no one reading,
after the cooling lapse of thirty odd
years, the messages, papers and 'rial
of President Johnson, as recently p b
lished by authority of <"ongress by
James D. Richardson, member of Con
gress from Tennessee, can come to any
other conclusion than the folly and the
wrong of It all. Why not look for as
great errors now unless wisdom and
sound judgment control? Very truly
yours, MARK SHELDON.

INDIAN OUTBREAK OF 1862â M., Mil
ler, Mendocino County. Cal. During the
spring and early summer ' of 1862 there
were frequent reports " of dissatisfaction
and threatened trouble among, the Tn
dian tribes of Minnesota' and' Dakota. The
causes of the discontent were complaints
that annuities were' not paid, 'that an at
tempt was made to" pay in greenbacks,
instead of gold, and 'there w.ere minor
complaints. The first. attack was made
by the Sioux under Little Crow on the
Yellow Medicine Agency. August 18, 1862,
where nearly all the whites, old and
young, were murdered. New Ulm was at
tacked August 23 and many ' whites
were killed, but the citizens banded for
defense and repulsed the Indians. The
next day a force of soldiers came to their
relief. Fort Ridgley was besieged, 'for
nine days, and its small garrison re
pulsed three attacke before reinforce
ments came. The Indians then went
northward toward Fort Aber.crombie,'
massaereing and plundering as they -went. â¢
In the meantime Governor Ramsey cajled .
out all the militia, a special session -of
the Legislature was summoned- and an' 1 ,
appeal was made to the General Govern- = â¢
ment. General Pope was detailed to com- '
mand the department and .the United â¢'
States soldiers were sent 'from various
points. The Indians made two assaults â 
on Fort Abercrombie in September, but
were repulsed with heavy loss. They re
treated westward, were followed by the
soldiers and forced to make a stand at ' '
Wood Lake, where they were utterly de- : .
f eated. About 500 were taken prisoners and" '
tried by court-martial; 300 of the number
were ordered hanged, but the President
commuted the sentence of all but thirty
eight, the remainder being placed =\n con
finement and given lighter punishment.
There were about 1000 of .the Minnesota
Sioux who took part in -the trouble, and
it is believed that the greater part were".
captured and the remainder killed. It
was estimated that about 500 whites Were '
killed by the Indians or died from sick- "
ness or exposure caused by their hasty
flight from their homes. .For several
months several thousand people were de
pendent on charity for food and shelter
The loss of property through the out
break was estimated at from two to three
millions of dollars. . â¢â¢'â â¢.

THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL., FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 1898.
WOMAN CLEARS
A MYSTERY OF
NEVADA DESERT
Man Accused of Two
Murders.
IS ARRESTED AT FULLERTON
ALLEGED CiaOIE COMMITTED BY
JOHN HANCOCK.
Charged With Having Put to Death
Dr. George Engelke and Peter
Edmiston for Their
Belongings.
Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
SAN BERNARDINO, Nov. 3.â John
Hancock, formerly of Perris, Riverside
County, an ex-convict, is in the Santa
Ana Jail, charged with the murder of
George Engelke and Peter Edmiston.
The crime is alleged to have taken place
on the desert in Southern Nevada in
April of last year. Hancock was ar
rested on the strength of a confession
made by Mrs. Winifred Myers. En
gelke was a veterinary surgeon, well
known in Southern California, and Ed
miston was a Canadian and a con
tractor by occupation.
The confession was made to Justice
of the Peace Edgar Johnson of Fuller
ton. Constable A. A. Pendergast suc
ceeded in capturing the murderer and
landing him in jail.
Mrs. Meyers was married on Tuesday
to George G. Gross of Fullerton. She
has been in constant dread of Hancock
ever since the murder, lest he take her
life and thus remove the only witness
of his deed. She took the opportunity
of her marriage to divulge the parti
culars of the crime.
Her story is a thrilling narrative.
She left Perris in company with Han
cock, bound for Salt Lake. Her seven
year-old son accompanied them. They
had a train of horses, and when one
gave out at Daggett Hancock stole an
other there to take its place. At Pah
rump, .Nye County. Nev., they fell in
with Dr. Engelke and his partner, Ld
miston, who were going to drive to Og
den, Ltah. The two parties traveled
together, and Hancock revealed to Mrs.
Meyers his intention to murder the two
men for their belongings.
ahe attempted to dissuade him, but
failed and that night when they were
camped in a wild, mountainous region,
Hancock shot both men in the head
while they slept. Fearful that they were
not dead he took an ax and chopped
their heads to pieces. He then gathered
together all th*ir erfects of value, bur
ied the bodies under piles of rocks,
burned the bloody clothes and with the
woman and boy went on to Salt Lake.
Hancock was employed at the Santa
Fe oil wells, near Fullerton, when ar
rested. Prior to his departure for the
aanta Ana Jail Hancock was inter
viewed. Tne statement of Mrs. Meyers
was read to him. He listened atten
tively to the damaging assertions and
a slight pallor overspread his counte
nance. At the conclusion of the read
ing he said:
â¢The part about my having killed
any one is a lie. It is true I have lived
with Mrs. Meyers six years and took
this trip to Nevada with her, but when
she tells of my stealing a horse, joining
Engelke and Edmiston and later on
killing them and disposing of their
bodies and effects it is false. It is true
I was shot in Oregon. I have a 'game'
leg yet. I believe Mrs. Meyers has gone
crazy or made the statement through
spite. She is a flirt, and I got tired of
her foolishness and told her to get. I
never threatened her life, although I
did say when I quit her at Fullerton
that if she was a man I'd knock her
head off. As far as her being afraid
to tell because I said I would kill her
it is all bosh. Why, there were lots of
times when she's been away from me
when she could have told if there was
anything to tell and I never could have
touched her. I suppose I will have to
fight the case, and I will do my very
best, for I am innocent."
THE BANKRUPTCY LAW'S
INVOLUNTARY FEATURE
Department of Justice Satisfies
Many Business Men and
Lawyers.
â  WASHINGTON, Nov. 3.â The Depart
ment of Justice during the past few day*
has been importuned by a largo number
of business men and lawyers to define
the status of the involuntary feature of
the bankruptcy laws passed during the
last session of Congress.
Congress provided that when the invol
untary feature of the measure should go
into effect it should be accompanied , by
a set of rules and orders formulated by
the Supreme Court for its execution. The
Supreme Court not having compiled these
rules and orders, some question was
raised as to whether the law could be
properly enforced at the time provided
November 1.
The Department of Justice to-day, how
ever, held that the absence of these or
ders will not materially affect the en
forcement of the law, and that they are
not absolutely essential to the execution
of the act and that there is no need to
wait on the Supreme Court rules. .

donation of money and provisions. Ac
cording to Dr. Stanley Brown this expe
dition is entitled to rank with that of Dr.

STEALING IDEAS
MAGUIRE'S FORTE
Barnes on the Judge's
Failings.
SPEECH TO STOCKTON VOTERS
SEVEN THOUSAND PERSONS IN
THE AUDIENCE.
Uproarious Applause Greets the Gen
erals Mention of the Name
of Hon. Henry T.
Gage.
Special TMspateh to The Call.
STOCKTON. Nov. 3. â General W. H.
L. Barnes addressed a magnificent con
course of citizens of San Joaquin
County in the pavilion to-night. The
eloquent champion of Republicanism
was given a rousing welcome when he
faced the assembled thousands. The
general had the multitude with him.
and under his oratorical power storms
of applause and waves of merriment
swept over the throng.
General Barnes said that If Maguire
should suddenly expire he feared the
name "Barnes" would be found written
on the dead man's gizzard as he (Barnes)
seemed to be the evil genius of the pop
ocratic candidate. As to being a South
ern Pacific attorney he said it was the
ethics of the profession to defend even
bad people. He pleaded guilty to hav
ing had the Examiner for a client, and
even thought he could stretch his sense
of duty far enough to include Maguire,
should that gentleman need his ser
vices. He said Maguire was a brilliant
man, and had the most magnificent
faculty of appropriating other people's
ideas of any one he knew.
The speaker denounced the Populist
platform to which Maguire had sub
scribed in the desperate hope of office.
He traced Maguire's record in Congress
and asked the people if this was the
kind of a man they wanted for Gov
ernor of the great State which in
twenty years would be the gateway
through" which the trade of the Orient
must pass.
The mention of Gage evoked a storm
of applause. To the Republican stand
ard bearer he paid the tribute that he
was the most stubborn and honest man
he knew, a man who would prove a
Jonah to the Southern Pacific or any
corporation or clique which might try
to handle him when he became Gov
ernor.
The address was a complete review
of the issues of the campaign. It was
listened to by 7000 persons.
HUNDREDS UNABLE
TO GAIN ADMITTANCE
Congressman Barham Addresses a
Large Throng in the San Ra
fael Opera-House.
SAN RAFAEL, Nov. 3.-So large a con
course of citizens assembled this evening
to listen to addresses by Congressman
John A. Barham and State Senator Frank
McGowan that Gordon's Opera-house
was filled to overflowing and hundreds
were unable to gain admittance. Special
trains from Sausalito. Mill Valley and
Tiburon brought large delegations of vot
ers, and Richardson's Band, which assist
ed the San Rafael Band in supplying mu
sic for the parade. Bonfires and pyro
technic displays added to the brilliancy of
the occasion. â¢
The speakers were escorted from the
train to the opera-house by County Clerk
Bonneau and Thomas P. Boyd. Captain
H A Gorley officiated as chairman and
the following vice presidents occupied the
platform: James f. Taylor, Thomas Bon
neau Judge Fryor. William Brown, W.
N Anderson, S. H. Olmstead, Judge Ma
hon, T. P. Boyd. W. C. Brown and Will
iam Barr.
i Judge Barham opened his address by
declaring himself in favor of America re
taining possession of all the territory ac
quired by the war with Spain. He as
serted that while Democrats and Republi
cans were a unit for the war, the Repub
lican policy of conducting it was undoubt
edly far superior to the Democratic the
ory. Referring to the financial question,
the speaker said it amounted to idiocy to
try to make 50 cents' worth of "(liver
worth a dollar. Every time the Democrats
got control of the Government, he con
cluded, trade was paralyzed and me
chanics clamored for work to support
their families. On the other hand, the
Republicans had never failed to cause
prosperity and contentment.
Senator McGowan spoke at some length
on campaign issues. State and -national.
Both speakers were heartily applauded
and the meeting ended with three rous
ing cheers for the pa^ty and its -candi
dates. Afterward the speakers were sere
naded by the Louvre Quartet and ban
queted at Hotel Rafael.

WILL RAISE NO MORE
SPANISH WARSHIPS
But the Government Will Entertain
Propositions From Private
Sources.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 3. â Secretary
Long said this afternoon that the Gov
ernment would take no further steps to
raise the rest of the Spanish warships
destroyed by Admiral Sampson's fleet
off the coast of Santiago, but that the
department would receive propositions
to that end from any private firm that
cared to undertake the work. He added
that this determination was based upon
the report of the Board of Contsruction,
which recently had a consultation on the
subject with Naval Constructor Hobson,
who was personally, supervising the
wrecking operations. The existing con
tract with the Merritt-Chapman Com
pany will be abrogated and operations en
tirely suspended on the Colon and other
vessels pending the consideration of prop
ositions from private firms to do the
work independent of the Government. It
Is understood that there are two compa
nies willing to undertake the work at
their own risk; one a Swedish company
and the other a company on the Pacific
Coast. _

Five Soldiers Succumb
to the Disease.
AN EPIDEMIC AT HONOLULU
FIFTY CASES IN THE CAMP
HOSPITAL.
Volunteers on the Transport Senator
Made Violently 111 by the
Food Served Aboard
the Vessel.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C Nov. 3.â Honolulu
advices per her Majesty's ship Aorangi,
which arrived here to-day, are to the ;
effect that work has been stopped at |
Camp McKinley. The entire camp will |
be moved to the Moanalua tract, which
General Merriam has recommended as j
a site for a permanent post. The
typhoid fever was the cause of the
abandonment of the camp. The troops j
in Camp Otis will remain there until
the arrival of the transport Arizona
from Manila.
Typhoid fever was sown broadcast j
during the time the ordinary rules of j
sanitation were disregarded in the mill- j
tary camps. There are said to be fifty I
cases, but trained nurses have been i
added to the force at the hospital from
the city and it is believed the death
rate will be very small. Malaria is on
the decrease.
When the Aorangi left there were 160
patients in the hospital, fifty showing ;
typhoid symptoms. General King says ,
the patients at the hospital will be
moved as quickly as possible to some
place near the hills, where it is dryer
and cooler. He says the hospital
should never have been located where
it is.
General King will sail on the Arizona
for Manila with the troops at Camp
Otis. The New Yorkers and Engineers
will remain at Honolulu indefinitely
for garrison duty. Five deaths from
typhoid occurred during the week pre
vious to the sailing of the Aorangi.
The names of the dead are:
CHARLES H. THOMPSON, First
New York Regiment.
THOMAS BEAVER, Eighteenth In
fantry.
PRIVATE TIMBERLAKE, Eigh
teenth Infantry.
JULIUS N. MILLER, Company B,
Nebraska Volunteers.
D. W. DAWSON, Company F, Colo
rado recruits.
Brigadier General King fcid quite a
controversy with Police Judge Wilcox.
The Judge while sentencing some pri
vates for disorderly conduct Is reported
to have said that if there were any
surety of the men being punished by
court-martial he would let them off
easily, but on a previous occasion when
men made a disturbance the command
ing officer could not be found, but was
sick in bed, although the same night
he gave a big dinner party and the men
were whitewashed. General King
wrote to "Wilcox asking him if he used
that language and the Judge replied
that the report was correct. King then
asked for an apology, which the court
declined to give, and there the matter
rests for the present.
It is stated that a new bank will
commence business in Honolulu the
first of the year with a capital of $SO,
000, with power to increase it to $3,000,
000. Part of the capital Is local. It
will not be a national bank, but organ
ized under the laws of Hawaii.
Police Marshal Brown learves Hono
lulu on November 9 for San Francisco
to visit the principal coast cities, with
a view of getting into closer touch with
them, annexation having made some
changes desirable.
The steamer City of Columbia has
been released on bonds. She was to
have sailed for Seattle the day after
the Aorangi left.
The election at Camp Otis was to
have taken place one week after the
Aorangi left. Senator Steele had left
the necessary blanks and gone on to
Manila for the same purpose.
The transport Senator arrived the
day before the Aorangi sailed. She
will coal at Honolulu and proceed to
Manila. The voyage was uneventful,
but the men complained of poor food
and crowded quarters. On the night
of the 22d 300 men were attacked with
a violent nausea, the result of eating
tainted food. All recovered.
CANAL MUST NOT SLIP
THROUGH OUR HANDS
Washington Authorities Watching
Nicaragua With Regard to
Concessions.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 3.â lt is said at
the State Department that our Govern
ment has not protested against the re
ported action of the Nicaraguan Govern
ment in granting a concession for the
construction of the Nicaraguan canal to
Eyre and Cragln after the expiration of
the Maritime Company's concession next
October. What the department has done
is not of recent date and consists solely of
the making of representations to the
Nicaraguan authorities to the effect that
the United States deemed only fair and
proper that the status quo should be main
tained in matters relating to the Nicara
guan Canal until the board headed by
Admiral Walker has had a chance to re
port and Congress an opportunity to con
sider that report. This is, diplomatically,
something very different from a protest.
The reason that this action is taken is
that the making of a new concession by
the Nicaraguan Government, even though
it would tane effect only upon the expira
tion of the present concession to the Mari
time Canaf Company, might operate to
prevent the latter from obtaining an ex
tension of Its concession, to which it
might be justly entitled. In the event
that Congress should legislate upon the
basis of a construction of the work under
the auspices of the Maritime Company,
this, of course, would seriously jeopardize
the interests of the United States.
The McCulloch Coming Home.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 3.â The revenue

Dewey's fleet at Manila, has been de

UNCLE SAM HAS
WEALTH GALORE

REPORT OF THE TREASURER
GOLD POURING IN FROM ALL
SOURCES.
War Only Serves to Increase the Na
tional Stock Figures of In
terest to the Whole
Country.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 3.â The Treas
urer of the United States, Hon. Ellis H.
Roberts, has submitted to the Secretary
of the Treasury his annual report on
the transactions and condition of the
treasury for the past fiscal year. The
net ordinary revenues of the Govern
ment were $405,321,335, an increase of
$57,597,630 over those of the previous
year, while the net ordinary expenses
were $443,3(58 582, an increase of $77,594,
423. The resulting deficiency of $38,
047,247 exceeds that of the preceding
year by $19,994,793.
In the receipts are Included $64,751,
223 paid into the treasury on account of
the sale of the Union Pacific and Kan
sas Pacific railroads. Out of them were
paid $29,850,952 of the bonds issued for
the construction of the Pacific rail
roads, which went to increase the ex
penditures.
Up to the close of the fiscal year the
increase of the expenditures on account
of the war with Spain was $43,041,732 for
the War Department and $24,262,438 for
the Navy Department. For the four
months of July, August, September and
October, 1898, the expenditures of the
War Department were $107,520,368, be
ing $81,613,131 greater than for the same
months in 1897. For the same months
this year the Navy Department ex
pended $27,459,577, which was $16,014,026
more than it spent in the like period in
1897. Up to October 31 the war with
Spain added to the disbursements of
these two departments the sum of $164,
932,228.
Independently of the prospect of rev
enue or expenditure, the Treasurer re
gards the treasury as having been
stronger* at the close than at the open
ing of the fiscal year, the insignificant
shrinkage in the amount of the assets
having been more than compensated
for in th% improvement which took
piace in this character. Against a net
loss of $7.500,u(J0 in the total holdings
available for the fiscal operations of the
Government there was a gain of up
ward of $26,000,000 in free gold, coupled
with an increase of nearly $23,000,000
in absolutely secured deposits with
banks, and these changes were effected
at no greater cost than the loss of so
much in silver and treasury notes.
The total available assets were
$874,764,377 on June 30, 1897 and $839,
606 736 a year later. By the addition of
the unavailable assets carried by the
department these totals are swelled to
$904 411,776 and $849,202,941, respectively.
On June 30, 1898, the Treasurer's ha
biiitv to the general treasury fund was
$575 751,368, with one of $66,465,160 sus
tained in his capacity as the depositary
of public officers, and one of $26,956,413
for moneys paid into his hand, but not
yet covered by^warrant into the general
account.
The outstanding notes of the denomi
nations of $20 and under, which de
creased in volume by $11,522,157 from
September 30, 1896, to the same date in
1897, increased by $41,657,037 in the
twelve months ending September 30,
1898. The gold in circulation rose stead
ily by .$49,327,263 in the former of the
two periods and by $94,551,059 in the
latter. The total currency of all kinds
in circulation shows an increase of $96,
539,249 in the former year, and one of
$137,775,854 in the latter, a gain of $234,
294,103 for the two years.
In answer to inquiries from the west
and Northwest the Treasurer has pre
pared a table which shows the amount
of the capital, surplus, undivided profits
and deposits of the national banks in
the territory north of the Ohio and
west of the Mississippi in July in each
of the three last years. The aggregates
for the three periods are successively
$923,979,746, $918,252,479, and $987,840,166.
While these figures do not show the re
sources of this sort in their complete
ness, they furnish irresistible proof of
the strength which this immense region
has gathered in the instruments of
commerce.
In a chapter in which the Treasurer
reviews the history of the net gold bal
ance in the country he says that prior
to September 1, 1898, the highest point
which this balance had ever attained
was $219,059,232, on April 3, 1898. On
June 6, 1893, the amount was $89,589,364,
the lowest in fifteen years, or since
June, 1878. By the exchange of notes
of gold with the banks the net gold
balance was brought up to $103,863,290
by August 10, 1893. Another minimum
mark was reached February 1, 1894, at
$65,438,378. By the proceeds of a sale
of bonds amounting to $58,660,917 the
ne.t gold balance was increased to $107,
446,802 by March 6. Under reaction,
however, It again fell to $34,975,607 by
the end of July, 1894. Another sale of
bonds in November and December of
that year brought in $58,719,710, and the
gold balance on December 4, 1894, was
again $111,142,021. The remedy was ef
fectual for only a brief period, for on
February 11, 1895, the treasury held
only $41,340,181 in free gold. Again
bonds were sold, for which payments
aggregating $65,428,056 were received
from February to June. Thus the net
gold balance was carried up to $107,591,
230 by July 8, 1895.
Once more the relief was but tempo
rary, and by February 8, 1896, the gold
balance had fallen to $44,563,493. For
the fourth time resort was had to a
sale of bonds, which produced, up to
June, $111,355,612 and brought the gold
balance up to a maximum of $128,713,
700, from which point it sank again by
July 22, 1896, to $89,669,975. Since that
month the reserve of $100,000,000 has not
been trenched upon. With some fluc
tuations the tendency of the gold bal
ance has been steadily upward. The
sources of supply have been the mines
of the Northwestern States, Alaska and
Australia, with importatkms from Eu
rope, the customs and the hoards of the
banks. Until the beginning of the cal
endar year 1898 the receipts of gold at
the New York Custom-house were a
negligable quantity, but in March they
rose to 17.6 per cent of the whole, in
April to 52.7 per cent and after some
fluctuations reached 78 per cent in Sep
tember and 79.6 in October. The tend
ers of gold from banks and individuals
in exchange for paper have been greater
than the resources of the Treasury
have enabled it to accept.
Large Starch Works Consumed.
NEW YORK, Nov. 3.â The works of the
National Starch Company at Glencove,
L. 1., were visited by a disastrous fire
to-day. The volunteer flre department
from Glencove and surrounding places
were unable to check the flames. The
loss will be about $200,000.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 3.â The War
Department has issued a general order
for the movement of troops to Cuba.

gade under Brigadier General Carpen
ter. The brigade will be taken from the
Seventh Army Corps, and one of the
regiments to go will be the Third Geor
gia, The brigade will be sent to Neu
vitas ajid Puerto Principe.
The order was issued only after very
careful consideration of the reports of
the military officers now In Cuba, and
of the Hecker Board and other expert
commissioners, who have been in the
field. The order looks to the occupation
of two points to begin with, namely,
Neuvitas and Puerto Principe, but the
occupation will be extended as rapidly
as the Spanish evacuation proceeds.
The order directs the movement to be
gin at once, but, according to the calcu
lations of the department, it will
scarcely be possible to make the first
landing before November 22. Head
quarters of the new corps which has
been created for the purpose of begin
ning the occupation will be at Neuvitas
under the command of General L. H.
Carpenter.
Following is the order as to the dis
position of the troops:
The headquarters of six troops of the
Eighth United States Cavalry and the
Third Georgia Volunteers will be at Neu-
Slx' troops of the Eighth United States
Cavalry and the Fifteenth Infantry go to
Puerto Principe.
The regiment will be prepared to em
bark at once and the subsistence depart
ment will arrange for the necessary ra
tions. The command will be equipped
and rationed for sixty days.
The Quartermaster General s Depart
ment will furnish the necessary wagon
transportation for use at the new sta
tions.
The surgeon general will make provision
for hospital and medical supplies.
Brigadier General L. H. Carpenter, U.
S. A., is assigned to command the troops,
with headquarters at Neuvitas.
The cavalry brigade, composed or the
Seventh and Eighth United States Caval
ry, Is discontinued. The Seventh i.s as
signed to the First Army Corps and the
Eighth to the Second Army Corps.
The Fifteenth United States Infantry is
â¢detached from the Fourth Army Corps,
an infantry brigade created, composed of
the Third Georgia Volunteers and the. Fif
teentb I'nited States Infantry, and desig
nated as the Second Brigade, Third Divi
sion, Second Corps.
The orders sending the Second Brigade,
Third Division, Second Corps, to Athens,
Ga., have been revoked.
RATE TROUBLE ADJUSTED.
Canadian Pacific and Grand Trunk
on the Same Basis.
MONTREAL, Nov. 3.â The award of the
board of arbitration in the differential ap
peal of the Canadian Pacific against the
decision of the board of managers of the
Joint Traffic Association, which upheld
the differential rate of the Grand Trunk
from Toronto to New York, has been an
nounced and puts the Canadian Pacific
on the same basis as the Grand Trunk.
As the Canadian Pacific runs over the
New York Central, which I* not a dif
ferential road, it had to charge Jl 25
higher than the Grand Trunk. Both roads
can now quote the same rate out of
Toronto. â

ADMIRAL MILLER
ON THE LATE WAR
Importance of Pacific
Naval Station.
SECOND TO NONE WE HAVF
NICARA^UAN CANAL MUST BE
BUILT.
Shown by Recent Experience to Be
the Foremost Necessity â Fast
er Battleships Are Also
deeded.
Special IMepatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Nov. 3.â Rear Admiral J.
N. Miller, who hoisted the flag over the
Hawaiian Islands and proclaimed them
part of the United States, left this city
this morning, after a day's stay, for
Springfield, 0., his boyhood home. Ad
miral Miller will retire from the ser
vice in the navy on November 22. Be
fore leaving Admiral Miller said:
"I believe the Pacific station to be
only second in importance, if not the
most important, naval station we have.
I think so not because I have com
manded our fleets in those waters so
many years, but because the rapid
growth of the West Coast cities indi
cates that a large population will
eventually reside there. I am, there
fore, greatly gratified that the Gov
ernment has seen fit to send two such
magnificent battleships as the Oregon
and the lowa to the Pacific station."
Speaking of his prospective retire
ment, Admiral Miller said:
"I greatly regret the necessity of
quitting the service at a time when I
feel I am well able to fulfill my duties,
but I must give way to younger men.
I have had my inning and must give
others a chance."
With regard to the lessons gained by
the late war he said:
"First and foremost, I think the ne
cessity for the Nicaragua canal is the
thing of prime importance to our navy.
A country which has such a vast coast
line on two oceans needs a route by
which warships can be transferred from
ocean to ocean without incurring the
necessity of circumnavigating a conti
nent. I think the Nicaragua canal will
be built in eight years. It is the only
practical passage.
"The chief difficulty to be surmounted
in Nicaragua is the establishment of a
port at Greytown. The shifting sands
thereabouts render navigation difficult
and considerable expense will be In
curred in fixing the harbor up.
"Another necessity shown by the war
is that of having a large number, of
first-class battleships capable of sail
ing eighteen knots an hour. We must
have them, and I think we will have
them. We want more ships like the
recently launched Illinois.
"With regard to Hawaii, it was es
pecially pleasant for me to close a long
service by presenting my country
with a large and fertile territory. Ever
since my first visit to Hawaii in '5o I
have been convinced that the islands
should belong to us. I have visited
Honolulu many times and have always
been accorded a royal welcome there.
It is now a thoroughly American city
and we did right in taking it in."
ENTIBELY TTN~FO"UNDED.
No Bad Behavior Among Soldiers at
Ponce.
WASHINGTON. Nov. B.â The following
telegram from General Brooke has been
received :
"SAN JUAN. Porto Rico. Nov. 2.
"Adjutant General, Washington: Re
ported bad behavior of our soldiers in
Ponce Province is news to me. Colonel
Castleton, commanding the provisional
brigade there, is now with me, and says
report is entirely unfounded. New regi
ments coming in were unsettled for a few
days, but all are away from there now
and at their regular stations.

Three Favorites Defeated â The Ring
Still losing Money â .Excur
sion Badly Cut Down in
the Last Race.
The fates certainly are good to the tal
ent at the track across the bay. Ever
since the meettng opened on Saturday last
heavily backed horaes have tome trudging
In first, and more than one penciler has
been compelled to wire father for more
coin. Yesterday the card had a light,
fluffy look, and did not attract a very ven
turesome crowd. It was prolific of up
sets, though, but two favorites â Mount
McGregor II and Shasta Waterâ scoring.
The most bewildering effect in the rac
ing line that was sprung during the after
noon was Morinel's win of the mile purse
event at odds of 15 to 1. Mat Storn's
mare was the rank outsider of the quar
tet, the knowing money being played on
the chances of Buckwa and Recreation,
the latter closing a slight choice. Buckwa
had the best of the weights, but is pounas
below his true form. Garrigan. on Mori
nel, for once failed to take the overland
route, but laid away in a good position
until the stretch was reached, where ue
made a cutaway and won easily in 1:40^.
In a fierce drive Rutter, on Buckwa, man
aged to take the place from La Qoleta by
a head. Recreation was all. out of the
going at six furlongs.
In the opening sfx-furlong sprint Mount
McGregor II had nothing to beat, and
starting a prohibitive 1 to 6 favorite won
easily from Una Colorado.
A straggling start in the two-year-old
event, a five and a half furlong scramble,
for maidens, did not improve the chances
of the 1 to 2 favorite Lothian. Crossmo
lina got away in front and maintained his
lead to the wire, winning easily by four
lengths The first choice was second, over
half a dozen lengths before Peach Blos-
Bookmaker Caesar Young's black inara
Mamie G had many friends in the betting
on the mile and a sixteenth selling affair,
but Shasta Water, the odds-on choice,
proved more than capable of taking her
measure. The pair raced well together
to the stretch, where the latter forged
ahead and. with something in reserve,
won by a length. Hazard was third.
Tiny Reiff. the midget rider, got home
first on Oraibee in the concluding six-fur
long jaunt for two-year-olds. At the head
of the stretch his chance of winning
looked very slight, but he found his way
through the bunch and in a drive beat
Rutter on Rio Chico out a head. The
favorite, Excursion, was badly cut down.

The stewards will look into the races of
the horse San Mateo at a meeting to be

Axnerlcan Democratic Club,
THE CITIZENS ABE REQUESTED TO BRING THE AMERICAN FL.AO WITH THEM.
WILLIAM P. LAWLOR, Chairman Unioa Campaign Committee.
able success over the Montana circuit last
summer, arrived from Portland yesterday.
Charley Thorpe had two winning mounts
yesterday, both horses from the Burns &
Waterhouse stable.
The chances of La Goleta were not ma
terially Increased by a severe bump she
got at the first turn from Buckwa. Rut
ter rode the latter, and apparently suffers
from the delusion that the horse he is up
on has the right of way privilege. He was
later fined $2o by i-Â»e stand for his rough
riding tactics.
Perry Hildreth purchased Anchored
from Garret Ferguson for $50. After the
youngster's good race on Tuesday, when
he finished third to Ventoro and Horton,
$1000 was offered and refused for him.
George Rose, the bookmaker, who ar
rived from Chicago Wednesday night, was
about the ring yesterday, and at next
drawing will go on the block.
Handicapper Sullivan, the man of many
curious figures from St. Louis, is also a
fresh arrival, and yesterday made book
for Harrison & Co.
Wednesday's game was too fast and fu
rious for Jack Atkins, and the board of
the Golden Gate Club was turned toward
the wall yesterday. It was not the only
one, for August Less found his bank roll
so lessened by Wednesday's onslaught
that he also temporarily suspended book
ing. He expects another carload of green
backs by to-day's fast freight.
The stables of Louis Ezell and Doss &
j Co. got in from Chicago yesterday morn-
I ing. Doss & Co. were obliged to leave
Enchanter at Ogden on account of sick
ness. The latter is said to be a phenom
enally fast horse, but his bad antics at ue
post have lost him a bushel of races.
Jack Reilly of "Jack's Tips" fame sur
veyed the sport from the steps of the
stand. He dropped in from the East in
the morning, and says fie will give his
patrons five winners the first time out.
Dr. Rowell says he intends to make a
first-class pilot out of Charlie Gray, and
as a starter has advised him to shorten
his rein and stirrup. Sloan and Maher
both ride with a short stirrup, and the
j pointer seems a good one.

XEW TORK, Nov. 3.â The market practically
. : . .retrieved to-day the- losses of the last two
' . days, the majority of .railroad stock 3 closing I
: .within a small fraction of the prices of last
â¢. Monday. There, was considerable Irregularity
. -at the opening due to the depression In Lon- i
.. don. There was a good deal of activity during j
the first hour, mainly centered In the special- j
' fties, and the changes. ln the railroad list were I
: almost unappreeiable, though the market held
. .at.very hard surface. Trading was dull, almost
-. to the point of stagnation until the last 15
miuutes,. when the most notable gains were
!mad.e-. The movement started with a sudden
advance of nearly five points in Metropolitan I
Steel, and Consolidated Gas follewed with an
almost- equal grain. St. Paul sold at 162^. a
new high record, and Great Northern preferred j
: Jumped over a point. Other railroad stocks
which extended their gains to a point or over
â¢â¢were. 'Omaha, Northwest and Denver preferred.
. Gains were made In the Grangers and North
â  crn Pacific and In one of two other stocks ap- i
proximating a point. The market was held j
â  .throughout the early dealings by the strength
of Sugar,' which rose above 115 and closed after ,
various fluctuations. Tobacco and Federal !
; Steel preferred' also showed a hardening tend- !
ency; but .were much more active than of late, j
The. recoverj' of the stocks was attributed to ;
relief over the more peaceful prospects abroad, j
! as Indicated by" the recovery of consols, the I
â¢ easing of the discount rate in London and the j
â  weakness of the wheat market. London bought
In' this market for the first time in several !
. days'... In- view, of these developments and- the !
continued' ea,se of .the- money market the ad
. vatiee -in ' sterling silver and Continental ex- I
change is difficult to account for.
' .An incident of the outside was the declaration â 
on-Standard Oil "assignments" of what Is, In j
. spite Of circumlocution employed in announc
ing- it, a dividend of 3 per cent regular quar- â¢
tfrly'.and 4 per cent- extra, bringing the. divi
dends for the' year- up to 30 per cent, against
33 -per cent last year and 31 per cent the year :
before. The" traffic statement of St: Paul .
showing an increase for the- fourth week In
October of $141,"464 .was . a sustaining force |
â¢ throughout the railroad list.
'.â¢â¢; There was a rood business done In bonds, j
especially "In reorganization fours, which '
B-howed a tendency to advance. '
The liquidation nf some, heavy blocks of j
Atehison adjustments carried the prii-* down â¢
; % with a subsequent recovery. Southern Rail

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Nov. 3.â Wheat opened weak
enough to suggest that an era of universal
I peace had suddenly supplanted the late pro
; tracted period of belligerency. English Gov
ernment securities, however, opened somewhat
â¢ lower than they closed the day before, and
! according to rumors floating around the pit,
England appeared to be spoiling for an Im
mediate tussle with Russia as well as France.
! An inkling of what subsequent cablegrams re
vealed must, however, have been known to
j some traders who at the start had December
wheat for sale at from ViS%c below last night's
1 close. Some of the early selling was doubt
i less due also to the appearance of fine weather
i and the probable effect of prolonging the time
: of heavy, deliveries by farmers.
I â¢ A Liverpool cablegram . reporting Odessa
; stocks of wheat officially to be over six million
, bushels instead of only 3,400,000 bushels as re
â  ported at the end of October had a considerable
I bearish influence. Another depressing feature
i of the d%y's news was Beerbohm's statement
which made European and on passage stocks of
â¢ wheat and flour 9,700,000 bushels larger than
I estimated October 1. December closed %@ : jic
lower.
Trading In corn was not of an important
1 character, and although the feeling was rather
i heavy at times on account â of the declining
; tendency of wheat, the loss for the day was
all accomplished at the start. December lost
%c
' Oats was particularly active and decidedly
' strong at times. Continued light receipts and
i good general cash demand inspired heavy buy
i ing of futures. May closed lc advance.
Liberal hog receipts and the weakness in
: grains started provisions weak. There were
I more buyers for the offerings, however, than
; could be supplied at the lower figures with
which the market began. Buying on a moder
i ate scale continued even when prices rose be
i yond yesterday's closing.

CALIFORNIA DRIED FRUITS.
NEW YORK, Nov. 3.â The Journal of Com
merce under date of November 2 says: Ar
rivals of the new crop of California dried fruita
are small, but there seemed to be less demand.
Light spot supplies cause a firm feeltntr and
prices are unchanged. We hear of few In
quiries for goods for forward delivery. Cali
fornia loose muscatel raisins are quiet. The
delay In deliveries of goods shipped from the
coast owing to the apparent inability of car
riers to bring them up from New Orleans,
where we understand there is considerable ac
cumulation of stock, is causing a good deal of
embarrassment to sellers, who guaranteed de
liveries at a certain dote, ami the railroad
company over whose lines shipments were made
i Is made the subject of a good deal of uncom
j pllmentary comment.
I California London layers and clusters are
wanted for holiday trade, but business is re
stricted because of the smaJl available supply.
There continues to be a brisk demand fur
seeded raisins, and seeders are still behind in
their orders. The market is firm though not
quotably higher. There is a very firm feel-
Ing In the market for prunes, based on the
scarcity of desirable sizes In all positions.
Forties are unobtainable, except In conjunc
tion with other sizes, either here or on the
coast. There is a moderate demand for Inter
mediate grades at our quotations. Apricots
are quiet, but under small offerings the market
remains firm.

â¢.' ' the amount was due to plaintiff, but over
' ruled the allegation that it had been ap

â¢â = benefits â o . * â  â¢
: "^ -The' ease. was concluded the 24th of last

"court's-"- findings were practically as fol
lows* WEen Mrs. Harris. became- a widow
.' -sh,e :h'sid /a fortune of $150,000. She came
.-. =to California and tier brother took almost
.--â¢ entire". charge of her affairs. .She had en
'.-.:'.tire.-confidence t in. him, and- gave liberal
v presehts-'to her brothers John and Josiah
:\ v and her sister' Martha, In 1&5 the de
' ' idant, .desiring to go into business, got
. -mission from. .Mrs. Harris to pledge
; her forty-ihree bonds, worth $25,000, and
O' other property to him, in return for
â â  - : which she received Judge Ames' note, in
.â¢.doi :-by" Ames and Deitrich. Ames sold
"the bonds -five years later for J48.575 and
â  "made- a- large profit. Referring to some of
;. -.her transfers of property, the court said:
â¢ . Two' "year's prior Mrs. â -Harris had given to
â¢-'â¢ her brother Â«oh'n sixteen houses in- this city,
valued at 175,000, reserving for herself a life
interest, with right to the rent and interest
during life. I believe the agreement of Febru
ary 5, .1895, -rta^ made in response to a demand
-. on" the part of '-plaintiff that he should have
â  a part of 'her fortune. He probably urged that
' she" should .-.make him a gift as she had done
â¢ -' to his brother. .â  'â -'â , . ' .
In IS96, 'it is . said, the plaintiff relinquished
her claim and took in lieu thereof five notes.
â  By th& bid eem'ent in 1895 defendant had
to pay to plaintiff a large yearly income until
â¢'her death, but under the new arrangement he
'-.was to pay an additional sum of 11236 per an-
V: â¢num for five years and nothing thereafter. The
. bonds and- -property should then be his.
â¢ It is this instrument of September 30, 1896,
that the plaintiff claims she never signed, and
many plausible theories have been advanced by
her to *hoW how such "a document lived and
.â â¢ yet was CGI signed. . â¢ :
â¢ ' : By a careful perusal of the evidence this
court U forced. 'to the conclusion that the
â V plaintiff never signed tKe agreement, knowing
â¢ its lull import. It Is not reasonable to sup
â¢.yose that she would supplement her already
' generous gifts . by additional ones, when her
'= heart was so bitterly opposed to her brother,
â¢ and was desirous of securing that which she
: " had already- given. It therefore devolves upon
: 'the defendant under these circumstances to
â¢ ' Bhbw that his agreement was valid and legal.
'.:" â¢ Hen a this court does cancel the agreement
' â of September, 1536. _
With reference to the agreement of IS9i> I
...have experienced- more difficulty. I do not
hold gtte defendant guilty of conversion, but
"while he is not guilty of this charge he has
â f; concealed' from his sister bis real, action in
many^ is maintained : that the defendant should
â¢ have $25 000 out of the . value of the bonds to
â¢ start' in' business this Is an erroneous posi
tion.*- The contention that this amount- was
' ' given- to defendant to offset the similar amount
â ' given to John Ames, is aiso wrong. In all
- other transactions Mrs. Harris secured herself
by- notes and she would, have done 80 In these
"'â¢ Â° With' 'reference to the letter of retraction
â¢â¢ . made by plalnilff and signed by her in which
' ehe -took .back all her charges against her
â¢brother I have but few wor^s. That she wrote
â¢ â¢- it thxre is no doubt.- That did so at the re
" nusrst .of. her nephew Whom she held in high
-.'â ' esteem .there is -no doubt. But we are still
" laced with the fact that. from ISBB to 35&5 the
."â¢plnihtfff was trying to* obtain from her brother
; . an account of 'hfs transactions- This she was
â¢ "unable to. do*, "except such a one as. could not

YOUNG WIDOW
ENDS HER LIFE
WITH POISON
Willed Her Body to
Dr. Hamlin.
HUSBAND RECENTLY DIED
SHE WAS A MRS. ANGELIN3
CROCKER.
Despondent Since Left Alone, She
Bade Her Child Good-By and
Drank Morphine in
a Hotel.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 3.
Mrs. Angeline Crocker, a young woman
who has been despondent for some time,
was found dead in her room at the Crel
lln Hotel at noon to-day. Alongside her
dead body was a loaded revolver, but
none of the chambers were empty, and
Its companion, on the table, an empty
morphine bottle, told the whole story.
The woman registered at the hotel last
night as "Mrs. Crocker, Alameda." She
was shown to a room, and when the at
tendants found her door fastened at noon
to-day and could get no response, they
entered the chamber and discovered the
suicide.
One of the first things to greet the
eye of the Deputy Coroner was a visit
ing card. On one side was the deceased's
1 name and on the other side the following
reQuest :
"Please turn my body over to Dr. Ham
lln and l>r. Wright for dissection as soon
as you have finished with it. Morphine."
On the table was another card showing
that Mrs. Crocker had made very thor
ough preparations to leave this world free
of debt. On the card was written, "Room
rent " and in small change alongside of I
it she had placed $1 05. In one of the i
! pockets of her dress was found a purse
containing $1 25, a morphine tablet, a ball I
programme pencil and a manicure tool.
The woman was a perfect stranger to the
hotel people, and her body was taken
away by the Coroner.
Dr". Hamlin aays he has known the wo
man for several years. Her husband was
a railroad man and a few r months ago he
went to Nevada hoping to improve his
healtht. but he became worse and died.
Two days ago Mrs. Crocker called on Dr.
Hamlin, at which time she was suffering
from extreme nervousness. While he"was
treating her she appeared very despond
ent and told him that she would certainly I
end her troubles by taking her life. The
doctor told her she was foolish to think of
such things, and advised her to turn her
mind to brighter topics. She replied that
she had been subject to nervousness and j
suicidal tendency since her childhood.
She made her home with her mother-in
law, Mrs. Lena Crocker, 2036 Encinal ave
nue, Alameda, where the deceased has a
son 5 years old, whom she visited last
night.
â¢'My daughter-in-law spent the evening
with her little son," said Mrs. Lena Crock
er to-day, "and she seemed to be unusual
ly happy. When she left she did not bid
him good-by any more affectionately than i
on other occasions and left no intimation
of her intent to commit suicide.
"She has grieved a great deal over her
husband's death. About two months after
his demise she attempted to drcrwn her
self In the estuary."
The dead woman's maiden name was
Angelina Parker, and she is a daughter of
Frank L. Parker, who iormerly resided at
1332 Versailles avenue, Alameda. but who
recently moved to 437^ Page street, San
Francisco.
An Inquest was held to-night and the
jury brought in a verdict of suicide.
TOOK BOUGH ON RATS.
But the Thought of His Family Made
J. Hallensheaa Change
His Mind.
OAKLAND, Nov. 3.â Because his wife
told him she loved him no longer James
Hallenshead, a lumber talller, aged 48
3'ears, took a dose of "rough on rats" to
day with suicidal intent, and when he
felt the horrible pains coming on he
changed his mind and hastened to the
Receiving Hospital In the hope of saving
his life.
He fairly crawled into the door at the
hospital, and was so far gone he was
unable to tell Steward Tobin anything
except that he "took rough on rats."
Then he swooned and fell.
At the same time a Dr. Wachendorf
was lying on the operating table. He had
been "taken sick at a restaurant, or at
leaÃt feigned it, and when Steward To
bin realized that the doctor was faking
he ordered him off the table to make room
for the dying Hallenshead, but he refused
and was told that If he did not depart
the police would be called, whereupon he
left.
In the meantime Dr. Stratton was tele
phoned for to attend Hallenehead, but
realizing the latter's critical condition
Steward Tobin quickly gave him an an
tidote for arsenic poison and applied the
stomach pump, and before Dr. Stratton
arrived Hallenshead's life had been saved.
STONE AT LIBERTY.
Grand Jury Indictment Would Never
Convict Bum.
OAKLAND, Nov. 3.â Manuel Stone, the
editor of the Portuguese paper, who was
indicted by the Grand Jury for cashing
his warrants against the county to three
different parties, will not be put to the
trouble of defending himself in court. His
indictment, like nearly all the others is
sued by the long-lived Grand Jury Juat
discharged, Is defective. This information
was imparted to Judge Ellsworth to-day
by District Attorney L. S. Church. Mr.
Stone was therefore discharged from cus
tody by the court and the Indictment dis
missed. It is hardly probable that the
next Grand Jury will pay any attention to
the incident.

OF HIS INFANT

AN APPEAL FROM PRISON
THE MOTHER WILLINGLY LET
THE CHILD GO.
After Suffering a Few Weeks It Died
in a Shelter Where Its True
Name Was Not

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,

SAN QUENTIN, Oct. 29, 1898.â To the
Court Commissioner, Alameda County â Dear
Sir: I take the liberty of writing you then*
few lines to ask If you will be so kind as
to ask my wife, Mrs. Louisa MaimgTen,
what she has done with our little daughter
that was born July 3, 1897. There le noth
ing mentioned about her In the divorce
complaint that has Just been served on me
here by my wife. When I was free I tried
to find her, but they told me that she was
dead. They have no death certificate or
any proof to show It and It" is my firm be
lief that if my child Is dead my wife or
her mother or the. midwife that attended
her murdered It. I am in here, with no
friends or means to do anything toward
finding out the truth, but If the child Is
dead I am sure that they murdered It to
get It out of the way.
Coroner Baldwin looked Into the case
some and said that it looked bad, but when
I got in here he dropped it. If you would
make her produce the child In court, you
would have the thanks of an unfortunate
man in trouble. I remain, very respect
fully yours.
SANDY J. MALMGREN (No. 17,669).
The above letter has been received by
Court Commissioner Babcock from a
young convict who two years ago mar
ried Louisa Cruze of Alameda and who a
few months after his marriage was ar
rested for bicycle stealing. He served a
term in the County Jail and after his re
lease was again arrested for felony, con
victed and sent to San Quentin. His wife
applied for a divorcÂ« while he was In jail,
but the decree was denied because the
court held that a man in prison could not
be deemed guilty of failure to provide.
A few days ago young Mrs. Malmgr^.n
again decided to be freed from her convict
husband. She filed an amended complaint,
adding the record of his conviction for
felony. This complaint was recently
served on Malmgren and induced him to
write the letter to Commissioner Babcock.
The little child of the young parents is
dead, but it was not murdered. It lived
twenty-two days, and during that britÂ»f
life the little one passed through some
strange experiences. After its birth the
young mother decided to part with it and
a part of the record in the case is a depo
sition from Louisa Malmgren in which
she says: "Having been abandoned by my
husband, he now Deing in the County Jail
in Alameda, and being absolutely without
means and unable to provide financially
or physically for any support of my child
Louisa, do hereby authorize Dr. E. Funke
of 1416 Eighth street, Alameda, for the best
interests of my said child, and to the best
of her judgment, to provide a temporary
home In some respectable family who In j
the judgment of Dr. Funke will take good |
care of my child for a period "of six ]
months or until my health and means
will allow my taking the child myself."
The convict's child did not live for six
months. Dr. Funke found a home for it
in a family where a value is placed on lit
tle children and before it had been with
its foster parents a couple of weeks
knowledge came to them that little
Louisa's father might make trouble when I
he came out of jail and the little Infant !
was returned.
The next record is that in the health of
fice in San Francisco, from which it ap
pear^ that on July 25. 1897, an Infant
known to the world as May Smith, but
who in reality is said to be Louisa Malm
gren, died at St. Joseph's Shelter in San
Francisco from pneumonia, after being
attended by Dr. McLaughlln.
Attorney Garrity. who re-presents Mrs.
Malmgren, said the record of the death of
the child is quite straight and that the
complaint merely recites the facts that
the issue of the marriage was one child
now dead. He says he will inform Malm
gren of the details of the little girr"s life
and death.

THE RECEPTION
GIVEN HUGHES
WHS GREAT
In Sacramento Thou
sands Saw Him.
HE MUST PITCH HERE
THE PEOPLE OF THIS CITY WILL
WELCOME HIM.
Hughes' Record of Last Season Places
Him in the Front Rank of
Star Twirlers in the
States.
By Joe Corbett.
"Jlmmle" Hughes, .Baltimore's great
and star twlrler, j was - accorded a most
flattering and * tremendous reception on
Sunday last when he appeared In his "old
uniform and position at the league
grounds. One of the biggest crowds that
ever attended a ball game turned out to
welcome the baseball phenom. of last sea
son and just to show him how much he
was thought of \by the people of Sacra
mento, a handsome gold watch and chain
were â  given him. :" ,' . â¢.."â Â» ':'- '
It was a wonder to me that "Jimmie"
pitched bo well at the outset, after going
through such a rousing ordeal, yet the
boy has demonstrated in a season just
passed that nothing, whether it be the
presenting of a handsome piece of jew
elry midst the howling of thousands, or
the hooting of an opposition audience,
can in any way interfere with his work.
There are, however, players who really
fail in the face of a great welcome, yet
are demons when it comes to close situa
tions. "Our Jimmie" is a wonder though
in every particular, and we , inhabitants
of San Francisco are Just as anxious to
see the boy perform as were those of his
own city. I will not guarantee that he
will receive any gold watches, but base
balldom will turn out in full force and
give him a â¢ reception . that will prove to
him how well he Is thought of by the
I baseball lovers of this community.'
His record as a young pitcher, . I dare
say, has never been equaled. I do not know
of a case. such as his when a pitcher en
tered the National League without ex
perience and the coaching so necessary to
every youngster, and came out as one of
the greatest, if not the greatest twirlers
of them all. ;
During my brief sojourn in that organ
ization I did what has been termed "ex
ceedingly well for a youngster." While
there I learned what a hard time young |
pitchers have when dealing with the old j
experienced hands, but I am on friendly 1
terms with these facts, not by pitching '
regularly, but by sitting on the bench for ;
nearly an entire season, studying the pe
culiarities of the game and and players. \
When I was finally called upon to take my 'â 
turn in the box I entertained, as I said pre- j
viously, a knowledge of the manner in ,
which the old heads played the game,
and I knew most of the players. I had ;
been told many things; had practiced day
in and day : out, with the great Balti
more team, and , was not. therefore." the \
perfect â¢ stranger to 'my surroundings as !
was "our Jimmie" Hughes. . I made a fair
record, but goodness knows my entrance
Into ! the , National League was nothing
when -compared to that of Mr. Hughes.
His pitching, especially, at the â¢ outset, j
was really phenomenal. - He knew noth- â 
ing of National -League^methods; was a
perfect stranger, to everything and every- â 
body; yet with it all he defeated, and in
a * few instances, shut out ' the greatest
teams -in the country. True he i lost 'a !
game once In a while, but that is -base
ball. The pitcher I am certain does not
live who. in a season's work, has not met
with' defeat. And, again, there were
games that Hughes lost which, were he
accredited that support supposed to ibe
given a pitcher at alPtlmes, would have
. been victorious. This, however, is of lit
tle consequence when one is assured that
both pitchers and players 'have what is
called an "off day." Players often lose a '
game for a pitcher, and again they often j
come to his rescue by pulling In a contest i
| from the very. Jaws of through the
assistance of a string of base hits Â«or sen
sational stops.' ' ' 'â '.-- --^
So on this question pitcher and field- i
ers always agree. . They both have their
'â¢ good and â  bad days, which is, and ; al
ways will â  be, baseball, â¢AY â Â»" the game
would not be worth : seeing if errors and '
the other mishaps, which give that glori
ous uncertainty to it. were eliminated. '
While Mr. Hughes has, therefore, lost I
a few games, this fact does not and
should not be thought, of as it Is, as I ;
have said before, : baseball. He . has
made the grandest record of any young
player that has ever left : this State, :or j
any other, and is to-day .â â â¢ one -of the }
oriehtest stars of the major league. His
entrance into that organization will
long be remembered, particularly by the
public of this State, and I hope he will
oblige us San . Francisco fans by con
descending to pitch the next time the
famous Gilt Edges play in our midst.
.We are all on edge waiting for you,
"Jimmie," and if you disappointâ well, the j
fans, I am sure, will never forgive you.
One can't take things too easy - when
twirling against the players of the Pa
cific Coast League. You will find them
much faster than when you left, take my
word for; it. : Why : on last Sunday at
Recreation Park they put up the grandest
exhibition of the game seen here in years,
and I heard one of them say that "you
National Leaguers had better slow." f
I inÂ£?r from this rather insignificant re- ;
mark that they â  are going to show your- }
self, Lango,' : Sandow, : and the rest : that !
they are not so bad ag some of the news
papers have said. 1 If they can continue
to play , as they i did last Sunday ,we will
soon have up-to-date National League
games. __â_____-Â»ââ
WELLS, FARGO & CO.
TO BE PROSECUTED!
WAR REVENUE TAX CASE FOR
THE SUPERIOR COURT.
Taken to the Supreme Court First as
a Flier to Save Time if
Possible.
The Supreme Court has decided that the j
case of the people, represented by Attor
ney General Fitzgerald, against Wells,
Fargo & Co., to compel the corporation to
pay Its part of the war revenue tax,
should be heard first In the Superior
Court. On the 25th of last month Deputy
Attorney General Anderson, presented at
the company's office a package to be de
livered in Sacramento. Wells. Fargo &
Co.'s employe refused to accept the
charge unless Mr. Anderson paid the one
cent war tax that must be attached to
every receipt, bill of lading, etc. The
State's attorney took the position that
Congress intended that the tax should be
paid by the transportation company and
not by the shipper or consignee.
This question has been decided by sev
eral of the courts of the East and every
decision was on the line of Mr. Ander
son's views. When the first cases- came
up in the East it was the understanding
that the express companies would abide
by the decisions, but in no instance have
they done so, and the people have been
obliged to pay. not only their own share
of the war tax, but that of the express
companies. On this coast no effort was
made to compel these corporations to
stand their share of the nation's expenses
until the present action by the Attorney
General.
After the company refused to issue a re
ceipt with a one-cent stamp thereon duly
canceled, Mr. Anderson applied to the Su
preme Court for a writ of mandate to
compel Wells, Fargo & Co. to comply
with the law in this respect and issue to
every shipper a receipt, bill of lading, etc
with a war revenue stamp thereon duly
canceled at the expense of the company.
Yesterday the court dismissed the ap
peal in the following manner; "Writ de
nied upon the ground that no sufficient
cause appears for making an original ap
plication to this court, and without preju
dice to any new proceeding in the Su
perior Court."
Deputy Anderson stated that he was not
surprised at the decision, but that he
had hoped that the matter would be first
heard in the higher tribunal, thus saving
the bother of taking the matter through
two courts, for an appeal was sure to fol
low any decision, of the lower court. With
in a day .or two he will t&k<Â» the case into
the Superior Court. The only change nec
essary is an alteration in the title of the
causs.
BECHT IN TROUBLE.
His Wife Sues Him for a Divorce on
the Ground of Infidelity.
George C Becht, the well-known mana
ger of the American Soda Fountain Com
pany, has been made the defendant in
an action for divorce. His wife, Lizzie
C. Becht, charges him with infidelity and
asks that the decree be issued on that,
ground. The Arlington House is given
as the scene of Becht's illicit relations
with some unknown woman, which, it is
alleged, was of frequent occurrence.
Mrs. Becht states that her husband is
the owner of all the stock in the Amer
ica Soda Fountain Company and tne G. J.
Becht Company. Besides this he has ten
valuable lots in Los Angeles. She asks
for a Judgment giving her all the com
munity property, alimony in the sum of
$125 a month and the custody of her minor
children, George J. and Esther C. Becht.
Deserted by Her Husband.
Lutie P. Gibson has sued her husband,
Fred W. Gibson, for maintenance. Mrs.
Gibson alleges that in April of 1596 her
husband deserted her and nas since failed
to contribute to her support.

Diggings That May Become More Desirable Than

BY SAM W. WALL.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
DAWSON, N. W. T., Sept. 27.â 1 to
day returned from a run down the river
by steamer to Circle City, finding op
" portunity to call at all the mining
â¢.camps between here and there. So
.many reports had come up by the fre
: -. quent steamboats of rich strikes and
: growing towns further down the river
that I felt the necessity of investigat
ing them before the ice should close the
river. I found so much of specific cor
â¢ rbboration for all the vague stories that
have reached me through the three
months past that I am convinced the
.. " center of interest for the world of peo
pje who are looking this way lies, for
â¢ : the coming â¢ winter, over the line in
. . . American territory. It was impossible
: - â¢ for me at this season to do more than
' touch at the camps along the river, of
. course, for to attempt to go back into
the mines would mean to isolate myself
for- weeks, as ice, which now forms
nightly in the pools and eddies, may be
expected to start running any day.
The .discovery of gold on the American
side in anything like the big pay that
is found on Bonanza and El Dorado
â¢ ; woufd create a new era on the Yukon,
â¢ such as a like extension of the mining
area in the Xorthwest Territory would
not do. The conditions are all so hate
ful, here that the American citizen,
who composes so large a proportion of
the population, ever has his ear strained
for reports of the expected strike some
. -where, anywhere, on the American side
.of the line. I believe that the reports
that have been published outside con
cerning these conditions â the excessive
' royalty tax, the reduction of the size
of a miner's claim, the absorption by
the crown of half the claims on a creek,
the granting of special privileges to
corporations in every department of
effort, and then the long line of petty
interferences by the Government, which
not only hamper and humiliate him, but
often take from him, and at all times
cause him to fear that they will take
from him without remuneration or even
explanation, the result of his effort and
struggleâ has had the effect of keeping
at home very many who feel a desire
to cross the Chilkoot and take a try at
fc-rtune in this moss-covered, mosquito
bitten and frozen wilderness.
1 have often referred to ttie more not
able of these burdensome things, but only
those who suffer the fretting embarrass
ments of the daily life here, the hamper
ing* of the incompetents and intriguers
in officeâ from whose rulings' there is no
appealâ added to the privation, suffering
and the tremendous struggle with natural
conditions that is exacttd of all who, af
â  ter arrival, really undertake to wrest
lrom the frozen earth the fortune whicli I
is there and for which they came, can ex
â¢ plain what a strike on the American side
.â¢ would mean to them. 1 have told how
.â¢ complaints are made constantly in the
locai newspaper, in public meetings and
by- individuals, and I have to say now
- that. complaint and protests have availed
nothing. Much has been hoped from the
administration that came into existence
' with the arrival of Mr. Ogilvie, during
Boy run down the river, and the people
, are waiting with the patience for which
. Americans and Englishmen- take great
credit to themselves, but which, under
all the circumstances, is the only thing
they can do. All the while, however, that
. .great crowd that has not already struck
it so rich here as to compel them to be
satisfied wfth a fraction of their output
(or income.), have their ear to the ground,
. listening for "news from below." For an
other great crowd has already gone there
and is prospecting the country. lam told
by a dozen apparently reliable men that
there are 2500 miners and prospectors on
. the creeks that are considered as tribu
tors to the new town of Eagle City, which
is at the mouth of Mission Creek, and
that on some of theso creeks very rich
, dirt has been found.
-In constant touch with men coming
from and going, to the lower river uig
''â  &ings as I nave been, I was nevertheless
surprised during this little journey at
what I had to learn concerning them.
There are. as many creeks now listed in
what is known as the Eagle City district
(which includes the Forty Mile district) as
having high-grade prospects as there are
in the Klondike diHtrict,- notwithstanding
all the stampeding that was done last
winter. And all tiese creeks that are now
glibly enumerated by the people of the
tower river are as thoroughly staked as
â¢are the creeks of the KlonQlke. It seems
th.'it a large proportion of that big throng
that left the lakes with the breaking of
the last- spring filtered through Dawson
. -and are hard at work on the American
Bide, and I met none that were not well
' content that they had gone there â none,
I mean, of those who went earnestly to
work. The first town below Dawson on
the river is Forty Mile, at the mouth of
Forty Mile River, so called because it is
â¢forty miles below old Fort Reliance,
which was about nine miles below Daw
â¢son. Fort Reliance is now a ruin. P'orty
Mile is a trading post of the Alaska Com
mercial Company. Opposite, on the lower
Â§ide of Forty Mile River, is Fort Cudahy.
a trading post of the North American
Transportation and Trading Company.
Th~ Northwest mounted police have a
post at Cudahy. The stores of the two
companies, the cabins of their employes
and a half-dozen others made up the com
position of these places last winter. To
each of them has been added a saloon
this year, that being the sum of their
development. Fifty miles farther down
is the mouth of Mission Creek, twelve
miles beyond, the international boundary
line. The boundary line is distinctly
marked by a wide swath cut through the
forest down the mountainside and show
ing clearly and sharply against the sky.
There was a miner's cabin there last win
terâone of those cabins built by me
Miners' Association for the convenience
of the traveler, all having the equal privi
lege of taking shelter there. There Is now
a bustling little town at the mouth of
Mission Creek, and the old miners' cabin
is lost In the crowd of new ones. The
town iP called Kagle City. Both of the
old trading companies are building ware
and store houses there, as is also the Al
aska Exploration Company, another San
Francisco concern, and known here ;is the
JJebes Company- Other companies are
also preparing to put in stores. There
are al>out 300 people in tfie place, and
Front-street lots are held at about $1000.
A considerable number of small industries
are re-presented, with saloons and dance
houses particularly doing a thriving busi-
The town already has its news
paper. A half-mile farther up the river
another but much smaller settlement has
started in to compete with Eagle for su
premacy at this' point.
Twenty miles farther down the river
is the rrinuth of Seventy Mile Creek, and
here again two territories are located,
one directly at the moutJi. called Seventy
Mile, and the other a few miles further
up stream, called Star City. The excuse
for the existence of Star City is that the
river Is shallow at Seventy Mile, making
% a difficult landing for steamers that at
, low water becomes impossible. Seventy
i Mile was established last winter, spring
floods submerged it and the residents
nearly all moved to the higher ground,
where is now Star City, although with
I the subsidence of the flood many went
! back to the old location, and the towns
i are now neck and neck in the race.
About twelve miles farther down, near
the mouth of Fourth of July Creek, where
discoveries were recently made, is Nation
I City, with Ivy City, its competitor, a lit
i tie farther down. These are as yet little
; more than groups of tents. At Coal
, Creek, fifty-three miles above Circle City,
' is McQuesten City, also a mere camping-
I place as yet. The stretch of fifty-three
! miles of river between this point and Cir
i cle is entirely bare of cities. Circle City
shows but little improvement over the
same season last year, that little taking
form in two restaurants, two watchmak
ers' shops and a tinsmith. Last fall it
was not possible to buy a meal In the
town. There is very little more to be said
concerning the Birch Creek mines, upon
which Circle City is founded. They are
being worked in the same desultory fash
ion as heretofore. There is plenty of good
property there, but it is or lower grade
than the more recent discoveries, and is
therefore neglected. Jack Gregor and Pat
Keneally, long time partners in the rich
est ground, or at least the most thor
oughly worked in the district, both took
a steamer for the outside early in Sep
tember, to remain all winter. They have
enough to warrant them in taking a rest.
While many continue to express unbound
ed faith in the future of Circle City, I
found the miners there chiefly interested
in the recent discoveries farther up the
river. These discoveries I will now treat
in their Â«rder of location, up from
I Circle City, giving it as it was given to
me by the many whom I met on the trip
coming from and going to" the new fields.
Of Coal Creek, a little more than fifty
miles above Circle, little is to be said
except that it was staked last winter.
It has its disciples and is being pros
pected. A coal ledge is said to have been
located there.
Charlie River, a few miles farther up,
is reported as discovering excellent pros
pects, especially on Big Bonanza and Dra
ham creeks. Good prospects are found j
also on McConnell, Marie, Fine Gold !
and Little El Dorado, tributaries of Big !
Bonanza Creek. It is promised by the j
miners prospecting there that these
creeks will all be heard from later.
About twelve miles above Charlie River
is a group of creeks that are attracting
much attention on the American side just
now. Discoveries were made there as re
cently as the 4th .of last July, and the
creek that is the center of interest in this
group is named Fourth of July, because
of that. Prospectors found it impossible
to get to bedrock ..because of water, but
coarse gold as high as 'â¢six bits" to the
pan is said to have been found in gravel
Just under the moss. This, not in a sin
gle instance, but in many, and at points i
of considerable distance from each other.
The discovery being reported at Circle a !
stampede took place and the creek is |
staked from end to end. Michigan, Re- I
publican and Dewey creeks empty into
the same slough of the Yukon, within three!
miles of the mouth of Fourth of July. | A i
little farther down is Bull Creek and
Schley Creek and a little further up is
Treat, all of which are staked and are
being prospected with such results as to
awaken the highest hopes of the pros
pectors. An island obscures the mouth of
Fourth of July, Dewey and Michigan
creeks to those following the main chan
nel of the river, and this is offered as a
reason why the rich ground there has not
been discovered before.
Seventy Mile is the next point -of inter
est. It is 180 miles up from Circle and a
little less than 120 down from Dawson. It
is called Seventy Mile because it is sev
enty miles from Forty Mile, and Forty
Mile is so called because it is, or was, for
ty miles from old Fort Reliance, which
was old Jack McQuesten's early trading
post, and was located about eight miles
below Dawson. Seventy Mile was pros
pected and much of it staked prior to the
Klondike strike. It yielded what was
then considered good returns. It was de
serted in favor of the Klondike. Last
February it was stampeded again and
the townsite located. The creek is long
and has many short tributaries, many of
which are said to be now. discovered un
der the much prospecting that the new
era has brought about to be rich in
coarse gold. Among the many tributaries
of Seventy Mile that are being prospected
Barney Creek is chiefly spoken of.
Eagle City, at the mouth of Mission
Creek, is the next camp met with in the
ascent of the river. It claims as tribu
tary to it all the upper Forty Mile dis- I
trict on the east and the Seventy Mile
district on the west, as well as of the
Mission Creek district. Miners say that
they can get into the North Fork of Forty
Mile by a trail leading over a low divide I
and that the distance is only about forty :
miles, very much shorter than up the I
Forty Mile River. All the rich diggings
of the Forty Mile district are in American '
territory, while Forty Mile post, at the
mouth of the river, is in American terri

REACHING FOR TRADE
IN NEW POSSESSIONS
Elaborate System of Transportation
Is Being Arranged by Vari
ous Companies.
CHICAGO, Nov. 3â Much interest has
been shown throughout the "West among
the business and traveling public as to
the recently acquired territory in the
West Indies. It seems that the transpor
tation companies have been actively at
work to establish a direct connection from
the West, as well as from the East, for
Santiago, Havana and Porto Rico, and
their plans in this line have been ad
vanced so far as to enable them to an
nounce at least a part of their arrange
ments for reaching these places from
Chicago and the entire West.
There are two steamships weekly con
necting Port Tampa with Havana. After
December 1 the service will be increased
to four ships weekly, and possibly to five.
Direct connections with Port Tampa from
Chicago and the West will be made over
the Chicago and Eastern Illinois and
Louisville and Nashville, the plant sys
tem of railroads, connecting with the
Louisville and Nashville Railroad at
Montgomery-, Alabama. Through sleepers
and direct connections will be made with
Port Tampa, where connections will be
made with the steamship line.
It Is contemplated that arrangements
will be made with the various steamship
companies at Havana to establish dur
ing the winter a regular line of steam
ships, running between Havana. Santiago,
Porto Rico and Kingston, Jamaica. Def
inite arrangements have not been made
for a permanent line, but a combination
is being formed for a regular steamship
service touching these points. There will
be railroad connection between Havana
and Cienfuegofi. From there regular j
Bteamship lines will soon be put in ope- j
ration.

WHY CUT?
Many a life has been sacrificed .by much
needless suffering inflicted by those who rely
upon the knife as the chief remedy for affec-
tions of the female sexual organs, when . a
more rational treatment could have been suc-
cessfully pursued by using Vitallsm-Cardine
for weak heart, Cerebrlne for brain fag, etc.,
Ovarlne for amenorrhea, hysteria, sterility;
Uterine Â« for > nervous exhaustion, . etc. ;. great
restoratives and vltalizers; they strengthen
â weakened organs ; drugs only irritate. The
treatment of 1898 for all female ~ complaints.

manent in action. Ask for PROFESSOR DES-

MAJOR MOORE
ORDERED TO
INVESTIGATE
Light on Fong Suey
Won's Escape.
../CHIEF MEREDITH IS BLAMED
INQUIRY WILL BE PROCEEDED
WITH WITHOUT DELAY.
' .Secretary of the Treasury Is Sur
prised at Meredith's Fail
â¢ â¢ lire to Prosecute
Her.
â¢ : WASHINGTON, Nov. 3.â Thorough in
â ; Vestlgatlon will be made by the Treasury
. .Department Into the case of Fong Suey
. Won, the Chinese woman, who, as alleged.
'â¢â was permitted to escape prosecution for
" â¢ -felony, even though evidence was before
.*â¢ the Chiru.se bureau of San Francisco
"showing that she had Imported Chinese
-women for immoral purposes. The pre
. â liminary report of Major Moore, chief of
â¢ : . .the Treasury Department inspectors at
â¢ San Francisco, was received at the Treas
ury Department to-day. Major Moore
â¢ Â»ays that he will immediately institute an
Investigation, and he has been directed
by the Treasury Department to proceed
â with' such investigation without delay.
Major Moore in his report does not seek
to locate blame for Fong Suey Won's i
.* escape from the law's clutches, but it is
evident from a conversation with the
Treasury Department officials that Chief
Meredith of the Chinese bureau is con
sidered chiefly to blame in the matter.
According to the understanding of the
Treasury Department officials Fong Suey
Won was only one of twenty-eight women
arrested in the raid by- the San Fran
â¢ Cisco police in the Chinese quarter of San
Francisco. This raid was made in an en
deavor to locate and arrest some twenty
"' five or thirty Chinese women who were
allowed to enter American ports for the J
ostensible purpose of taking part in the
Omaha Exp&sition.
â¢ But like other Chinese' who were ad
mitted to the Chicago World's Fair and
the Atlanta and Nashville expositions,
they did not return to China, but re
â¢ mained here to lead immoral lives. Fong
' Suey Won was arrested among others,
charged with being unlawfully in this
country but when she produced her cejr- |
tilioate of registration, as required by the
Geary act, she was released, although .
according to Major Moore's statement ne ;
had already placed in possession of Chief ;
Meredith evidence showing that she was :
guiHv of felony, to wit, importing women
Into the -United States in violation of the
restriction act. This offense is felony
punishable by imprisonment not exceeding !
ten years or $10,000 fine, or both, in the
discretion of the court.
It is alleged that various Chinese women I
â at the Methodist and Presbyterian mis
sions at San Francisco positively identi
fleil Fong Suev Won as the woman who I
' had brought them to the United States. !
. This evidence, it is alleged, was in pos- I
. cession of Chief Meredith at the time the
woman was turned loose and, although
the Treasury Department approves of the i
release ot Fong when she produced her j
registration certificate showing she was .
entitled to be within the United States, j
â  they fail to understand why she should
not have been held and prosecuted for
' the graver charge.
Chief Meredith of the Chinese Bureau
made a peculiar "break" yesterday. He
was in Collector Jackson's office engaged
in conversation with the Collector and a
reporter, ani the conversation turned
on the article in The Call of yesterday
morning, and particularly to the episodo
of the payment of money in a certain
lawyer's office to a Chinese Inspector de
ecribed as having the ends of his mus
tache tightly curled.
"I never was in Lawyer 's office in j
my life," said Meredith
As the lawyer's name had not been i
mentioned in the published story, nor by j
the reporter in the interview, both the
Collector and the reporter expressed sur
prise that Chief Meredith should know
the name of the lawyer who, it was al
leged, had paid money to a Chinese In
spector who tightly curled the ends of
his mustache.
"How did you know who the lawyer j
was, if you knew nothing of the circum- j
Btances?" asked the reporter.
"Yes, how did you know it?" inquired
the Collector.
Meredith explained that he had known i
that the lawyer had been interested in j
landing Chinese some time back, and that j
he had seen his name in papers and other I
documents and that he had presumed
that the lawyer he had named was the
person meant in The Call's article.
The peculiarity of the incident lies in
the fact that the attorney mentioned by
Chief Meredith went out of the Chinese
business some time ago, although he was
the identical attorney of the story.
The trick of substitution has been fre
quently resorted to by the Chinese and
their brokers when all other means fail.
It consists in substituting for a valuable
glave who has been ordered deported
come cheap old woman who wants to re
turn to China free of expense. One of
these cases was discovered by Miss Lake,
matron of the Methodist Chinese Mission
'Home at 916 Washington street. She told
Â°the following Â§tory yesterday: A Chinese
slave girl who recoiled in horror from the
life to which she was destined by her
purchaser confessed to a missionary on
board the steamer that she was about to
be landed on false representations. The
missionary had her brought before Col
â¢ lector Wise, to whom, in the presence of
Chinese Inspector Meredith, she repeated
o the confeKslon. This happened within a
â¢week of Collector Wise's retirement from
office to make way for Colonel Jackson,
his successor. Of course there was noth
ing to be done under the circumstances
and the publicity given to the girl's story
Â»but to deport her. She had, however,
confided to the missionaries that there
â¢was on board the same steamer a Chinese
â woman who had led the abandoned life
of a slave and who desired to be rescued.
She had friends in China and she wanted
to be sent back to them. Two mission
aries who spoke the Chinese language
were sent to the Bteamer to talk with the
woman, but whenever they approached
her a Chinaman lounged up to her side,
so that she was afraid to converse with
them. They turned to interview other
â women on board, and whan they looked
again for the slave she had disappeared.
Glancing to the upper deck where there
were no other Chinese, they saw her
hanging up clothes on a line. In response
to a sign made by her they approached
her and she told them her story. The

matter was laid before Collector Wise
and the woman was ordered deportea.
Pending the sailing of the steamer for
China she was confined in the Methodist
Mission Home, and when the day a r . ri Y^
on which the steamer was to sail tne
woman was taken from the home to t>e
placed on board the steamer, Three da js
after the steamer had sailed Miss Latte
was informed by three reputable Chi
nese women that the slave who had been
ordered deported had been taken to a
bagnio In Chinatown and that another
woman who wanted to return to China
had been placed on the steamer in her
8 Much surprise has been expressed that
Collector Jackson allows Harry Huff
to be employed by the bureau from
time to time as Chinese inspector.
Mr. Huff was an official interpreter
at the time that the. boodling
schemes of Interpreter Dick \\ il
liams were exposed, and he was so close
to Williams that the department found
it necesary to compel him to resign. L.n
der the Jackson-Meredith administration
of the bureau Huff obtains employment
very often as interpreter, in spite of the
distrust which had been entertained by
the department. When Major Moore,
Special Agent of the Treasury, was plan
ning the recent raid to capture a score or
more of Chinese women slaves who had
escaped from the Omaha Exposition he
urgently requested Collector Jackson not
to acquaint Huff with the fact that a
raid was contemplated or allow him to
accompany the raiders. In spite of his
protest Huff was sent wflh the raiders,

Chinese bureau was strongly recommend

had a well-established reputation as an
honorable, capable, incorruptible and in

"It is true," added the official who

COLLISION OF

AFTER THE COLLISION.
day night. Both vessels are very badly
damaged, and it will be at least a month
before either of them will begin to look
shipshape.
The Peters still lies on the Belvedere
shore of Richardson Bay. Her lower
deck is submerged at high water, and in
consequence nearly all her cargo is de
stroyed. Her entire stem is stove in, but
otherwise she Is, not much damaged.
H. J. Corcoran, superintendent of the j
California Navigation and Improvement
Company, came down from Stockton yes
terday, and at once went over to the
wreck of the Peters. She is lying in about
twenty feet of water, but there will be no
difficulty in raising her by means of pon
toons. The chances are that she will be
patched up where she is and then be
towed to Stockton for an overhauling.
Pilot McNeil was in charge of the
Peters when the collision took place, it
being Captain Hollisworth's watch below.
The purser, four of the crew and six
women got into a boat and were landed
at Angel Island. All the women were
without hats, and one of them was in
her night clothes, as she had undressed
as soon as the steamer left, the wharf.
One of the crew was cut by the falling
Jackstaff and his injuries were dressed at
the post hospital on the island. Both men
and women came over on the McDowell
on her first trip to San Francisco, and
will start for Stockton again to-night on
the Mary Garratt. One of the women
left her hand satchel with all her money
in it on the Peters, and when she got
ashore from the McDowell had to borrow
money with which to get home.
The Czarina is now at Howard-street
wharf with a hole in her port bow
through which a coach and four could be
driven. There is another hole below the
water which would undoubtedly have
sunk the collier had it not been for her
water tight compartments. The big hole
was plugged up with a portion of the
Peters' bow, and when it was removed
the full extent of the Czarina's damage
could be seen.
An Investigation will be held by the in
spectors of nulls and boilers early next
week and until that Is concluded it will
not be known for certain who was to
blame for the collision. Both Captain
Hollisworth and Pilot McNeil of the
Peters positively refuse to make a state
BAY GIVES UP ANOTHER OF ITS DEAD
THE dead body of Frank "W. Oatman, at one time city passenger agent
for the San Francisco and North Pacific Railroad Company, was
found floating in the bay yesterday morning at the foot of Powell
street. The discovery of the floating corpse was made by a young man
named Ed Veale, who, with the assistance of I. Anthon and L. Hartman.
towed the body ashore and noti
fied the Morgue. From papers
found in his clothing the dead
man was Identified, and hia
brother-in-law, J. H. DeWitt. of
the Breeder and Sportsman, was
at once notified. Mr. DeWitt
took charge of the body and
will see to its burial.
Oatman at one time stood high
in railroad circles, both here and
in the East, but the love of hard
liquor got the better of him and
downed him. Prior to his con
nection with the North Pacific
people he had held positions of
trust with the Chicago, Burling
ton and Quincy at Chicago and
with the Union Pacific. His
last employment In this city was
with the Johnson Creamerie
on Market street, where he
served as cellar man. He was at one time a member of the Masonic
order and the Knights of Pythias. It is the opinion of Mr. DeWitt that
his brother-in-law took his own life, and pawn tickets found In the cloth

the Czarina has already been printed.
The following dispatch has been re
ceived from Stockton:
STOCKTON, Nov. 3.â A -variety of opinions
have been expressed here by passengers of the
111-fated steamer J D Peters, who returned liere
this morning on the Captain Weber as to where
rests the blame for the accident.
Alexander Cohen, one of the Peters pas
sengers, says he saw a man Jump overheard
and heard him cry for help; he Is of the opin
ion that the man was drowned. It Is also
believed that some Chinamen were burled be
neath heavy piles of merchandise knocked over

being unable to extricate themselves, were
drowned. So far as known, no one is mlss\n#,

The transports St. Paul and Morgan
City, from Manila, docked yesterday. The
Morgan City brought only one passenger,
while the St. Paul brought twenty-six,
four of whom were officers, eighteen pri
vates and four prisoners. The latter were
all sailors from the cruiser Charleston and
are under sentence for desertion and
drunkenness. They are James Conlan. J.
P. Hathaway. J. H. Savage and John
Wetherby. They were removed to the
Harbor Police Station by Sergeant Bun
ner and later in the day were sent to the
Mare Island prison on the Unadilla.
The officers who came up on the St.
Paul were Dr. F. W. Harre'l of the vol
unteers and Major S. C. Kellog. Major F.
J. Kernan and Dr. Louis L, Young of the
regulars.
Captain Hays of the St. Paul says the
stories of sickness at Manila are greatly
exaggerated. The majority of those on
the sick list are not very bad, and there
are not any more of them than there was
at the Presidio when all the troops were
there. "Even as it is. there would not he
nearly so many of the boys sick." said
Captain Hays, "if they would only take
care of themselves and regulate their
diet."

vessels were fitted out here for a voyage
to St. Michael. On the return trip they
loaded coal at Puget Sound for San Pe

were libeled by the crew for wages. The

People's Mutual and
the Supervisors.
THE DECISION DELAYED;
PUBLIC PRINTING BIDS ARE
THROWN OUT.
New Proposals for the City's Wcrk to
Be Sought From the Reputable
Newspapers of San
Francisco.
The Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors met yesterday and considered
an application made by the People's Mu
tual Telephone Company asking for one
year's extension of the terms under which
their franchise was granted. The attor
ney for the company, who was present,
stated that one provision of the agree
ment had not been fulfilled, viz., that the
People's Mutual was to expend $100,000
during the first twelve months following
the acquirement of its franchise. He ex
plained that the franchise had been con
tested in the courts, and for that reason
the company had delayed making invest
ments of money in a plant, etc. Now that
there was no longer a legal question as
to the rights of the Mutual to operate in
the city the company stood ready and
willing to invest the $100,000 as contemplat
ed when the franchise was granted, pro
vided that an additional twelve months
were granted for that purpose.
Herman Laguna, who has in the past
persistently fought the Mutual Company,
was present, and at once made objections.
He declared that the telephone people had
not lived up to the terms of their agree
ment with the city and that they were
not entitled to a further extension of
Jme. Laguna's peculiar interest in thwart
ing the plans of the new company have
for some time subjected him to the sus
picion of being in the employ of rival in
terests, and the question was put
to him after he had finished his speech
yesterday as to whom he represented.
"Myself" was the only answer that he
deigned to give.
The committee, after hearing all of the
pleas for and against the extension of
time, decided to take the matter under
consideration for one week.
The Printing Committee of the Super
visors also held a meeting yesterday
morning, and decided to reject all three
of the bids which had been made for the
public printing for the next two years.
These bids came from the Evening Re
port, Evening Post and Daily Journal of
Commerce. Each of the papers offered to
do the city's printing for nothing and the
Journal of Commerce, in addition, made
a bonus offer of $500. Supervisor Britt,
in discussing the matter, said: "We don't
quite understand these bids. There is a
remarkable amount of pulling and haul
ing going on to secure the printing. I
never saw more leg-pulling over any mat
ter since I have been a Supervisor. There
must be some 'graft 1 in the contract, or
these people would not be fighting so
hard. The committee will look into the
matter thoroughly before any final action
is taken."
The action of the Printing Committee In
rejecting the three bids was supplemented
by an order directing the clerk to readver
tise for proposals for the public printing
In accordance with the provisions of the

The section south of Golden Gate Park

boon the residents are very grateful for
from the fact that heretofore it was nec
essary to have a lantern at night to guide
persons on their way. In addition to this
there are other permanent Improvements
continually going on throughout the en

ments on I street have received a tempo

Seawell In the protest of the Sutro heirs
against improvements on that street.
Nineteenth avenue is receiving some at
tention now at the hands of the graders.
Promises have been received from the
Board of Supervisors to use a portion of
the street funds for the purpose of ex

Fourteenth avenue to H street.
Through the similarity of the names of
streets (alphabetically) and the avenues
(numerically) considerable complaint has
been made that mail matter intended for
one or the other of the sections is as
often miscarried as not. To avoid this
the secretary of the improvement club
was instructed to addiess a letter to the
Postmaster to have the word "south"
prefixed in future.

NEWS OF THE
ACTOR WORLD
The Blanche Bates-Prawley company
performance of "A Doll's House" at the
Baldwin this afternoon at 3 o'clock
promises to be the event of the season.
Of all the Ibsen plays, this one has been
the most frequently presented. It deals
with fewer philosophical complexities, and
portrays home life without the ultra-mor
bidness of "Ghosts" or "Hedda Gabler."
The story is simple. Nora Helmer, who
from her earliest childhood haa been
petted and indulged, is married to a
grave man of business, Torvald Helmer.
She has never been allowed to know of
or share in her husband's anxieties. His
health breaks down, and a continental
trip is advised by the doctors. Nora, act
ing under the best of impulses, and know
ing Torvalds strong objections to incur
ring debts, secretly borrows money to
pay the expenses of the journey. As se
curity is demanded, she forges her
father's name to the note, her education
having failed to teach her the gravity of
her act. Torvaid regains his health and
is promoted to a position of trust in the
bank, and among his first acts in his of
ficial capacity dismisses a clerk by the
name of Krogstad. It is this Krogstad
who has loaned the money to Nora, and
now, to hold his position, he threatens to
expose her. Through the agency of a
friend of hers, a Mrs. Linden, and
through her own efforts, Nora manages
to put off the evil day. The exposure
comes, however, and with it indignation
and rage from Helmer, who thinks only
of what the world will say. Krogstad is
influenced, however, to wri:Â« to say that
he will not make the exposure public.
It is at this moment of Torvald's relief
that Ibsen asserts his style; for Nora, in
stead of accepting Torvald's protestations
of forgiveness now that reputations are
safe, declares her intention of leaving
him She has expected "the miracle of
miracles"â that Torvald would take her
own guilt upon himself. His fear of the
world' s criticisms, and the fact that he
has thought of the world, and not of her,
convinces her that though married in law
they are not man and wife in spirit.
Meantime the regular Frawley season
is coming to an end. ''The Transit of
Leo" -will play up to Sunday night, when
the farewell will be celebrated in a re
auest repetition of "An Enemy to the
Kine " The regular Baldwin season
commences Monday with "Mistakes Will
Happen," a piece by Grant Stewart, who
describes it as a "farcical study.'
At the Comedy last night "A Scrap of
Paper" gave way to "The Crust of Soci
ety an adaptation of Dumas' "The
Demimonde." which has been seen here
before Edward Bell and the Henderson
Company contributed to the cast. "The
C?ust of Society" will be the bill for the
rest of the week. "The Heart of Chi
cago," a turbulent melodrama, follows.
The popular hit of the week is "Hogan's
Alley, which continues to crowd the
California at every performance. Mur
ray and Mack, Irish comedians, follow
Sunday in "Finnlgan's Ball."
"Sowing the Wind" has only the week
to run at the Columbia. Kellar, the ma
gician, comes Monday.
William Armstrong, the eminent music
critic, will lecture on American compos
ers at the Columbia Theater next Thurs
day afternoon. Fritz Scheel and a sym
phony orchestra will furnish the musical
illustrations.
A benefit will be given Prank Mathieu
of the Frawley company next Wednes
day evening in the Native Sons' Hall.
"Ambition" is drawing well at the Alca
zar. "Dr. Bill" follows.
Morrison's melodrama, "The Indian," is
making out a good week at Morosco's.
At the Tivoli "The Grand Duchess" fin
ishes with the Sunday night performance.
The new week will be devoted to revivals
of "Girofle-Girofia" and "The Circus
Queen."
The Orpheum is attracting the usual
throng with an excellent vaudeville bill.
Orpheum Symphonies.
The Orpheum will house the Symphony
Society's new series of concerts, which
commences November 17. Frjtz Scheel
will direct, as before, and H. J. Stewart
will furnish the analytic programmes. ,
