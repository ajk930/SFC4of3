GIBRALTAR, May 4.- -The most alarming rumors
prevail here regarding the situation in Madrid. It is reported
that General Martinez Campos and Senor Moret have been
assassinated and that Premier Sagasta has taken refuge in
the British Embassy from the fury of the mob.
VALENCIA, May 3. â A state of siege has been pro
claimed. The city is under martial law. An angry mob,
with republican proclivities, attempted a hostile demonstra
tion, but was quickly dispersed by mounted police.
GIBRALTAR, May 3.â From a high official source here I have information that
the situation in Madrid is exceedingly serious. Not only is the city in a state of siege,
but there has been rioting and firing in the streets. 1 have no means of verifying this
news.
The Carlists are exceedingly active, and are sending out circulars to excite the
Spanish people to revolution. I have just seen a circular received by a Spaniard
here. It holds Don Carlos up as being the only true patriot in Spain and fiercely at
tacks the Government for treachery. It says the moment for revolution has come.
LONDON, May 4.â The Madrid
correspondent of the Daily Mail, tele
graphing Tuesday, says: There is
no longer any doubt that the internal
situation is causing the Government
almost as much uneasiness as the
external. Last night's demonstration
â¢was one of the most serious in some
time, since those openly participating
showed their revolutionary tenden
cies.
Cries were raised of "Down With
the Bourbons!" "Long Live Don Car
*'los!" "Long Live the Republic!"
ftnd "Long Live Weyler!"
The first move of the demonstra
tors, over a thousand strong, was to
the house of General Weyler, with
the object of cheering him. He did
not appear, and the crowd then went
to the residence of Senor Sagasta,
where the Ministers were in confer
ence and shouted in favor of his res
ignation. Senor Agullera, Civil Gov
ernor of Madrid, broke up the pro
cession with the aid of the police,
who were badly stoned and had to
charge the crowd. The authorities
thereupon met with Senor Aguilera,
who announced his intention of re
signing, saying that it cost him
great trouble to repress such mani
festations ana that he was not able
to answer for order with the powers
at his disposal.
Thereupon the edict was issued,
placing Madrid under irartial law,
and the military Governor, Daban,
received stringent orders from Gene
ral Correa, the Minister of ' War, for
ONE MORE DAY
WITHOUT A WORD
FROM BRAVE DEWEY
WASHINGTON, May 3. â The day passed without a single word from
the American fleet in the Philippines, and in view of the long-contii ued in
terruption in cable communication the officials are beginning to resign them
selves to the belief that they must await further official news until a boat
arrives at Hongkong. This will not necessarily be a naval vessel, for it is
not believed that Commodore Dewey, who will be admiral as soon as he can
be reached by cable, could have spared any of his ships, even the McCul
loch, to carry dispatches before the bombardment. In ordinar-- times
there is ; lenty of commu ication by steamers, as well as by native vessels,
between the Philippines and the mainland, and the officials will be rather sur
mised if some news does not come by this means by to-morrow.

The San Francisco Call
the preservation of peace.
Meanwhile the Cabinet Council is
' discussing the political situation in
Spain. Admiral Bermejo, Minister
I of Marine, and General Correa, are
j strongly in favor of an immediate
; suspension of the constitutional
j guarantees, a step which requires
I closing the Cortes. The other mem
bers of the Cabinet, however, con
sider this inconvenient at the pres
ent moment, because it would wipe
j out many years' history of the Libe
ral party. There is a general belief
that a Cabinet crisis is imminent,
| and it will probably end in a con- j
! siderable modification of the present
i Government, possibly in the forma
' tion of a national Ministry under the
j presidency of Marshal Martinez Cam
pos. In any case, Parliament is cer
tain to be closed shortly.
The events of the last few days
have undoubtedly increased the pop
ularity of General Weyler, who fay
! ors an out and out war policy. At
the same time there is no real ground ,
for anticipating that he will come to ,
the head of affairs. General Weyler
is a notorious, but not a prominent
person in Spanish politics. Poli- j
ticians and the people at large have â 
been paying little attention to him I
recently. His party is composed of
a few persons of no very high stand
ing.
Moreover, every one recognized that
Weyler's cruelty in Cuba and his
policy as to the reconcentrados
largely contributed to bringing about
SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY, MAY 4, 1898.
I the present state of affairs, while his
rJieged notorious laxity w.ith regard
to public money has made him much
disliked. Public opinion is always
likely to mistrust him, and he is un
popular with the Queen Begent. The
country en masse is opposed to the
idea of a republic. The people prefer
Don Carlos if anything to such a
change.
They had enough of the republic
in 1873. The indignation which is
felt at present is not against the
present dynasty, but against the
Government and the politicians in
general.
If a military dictatorship should
come it would most probably be un
der the Queen Regent and possibly
General Martinez Campos. Even
General Polavieja has more chance
than General Weyler. Such a dicta
torship would take the form of con
ferring the Premiership on one of
these generals with full power.
SUPPOSED SPY ON
THE CRUISER ST. PAUL
Detected While Trying to Gain Ad
mission to the Magazine-Boom
of the Vessel.
NEW YORK, May 3.â A late special
to the Herald from ' Philadelphia says-
One of the efew of the St. Paul, which
is being fitted out as an auxiliary for
the United States navy at Cramps' ship
yard, was detected trying to gain ad
mission to the magazine room of the
vessel shortly before midnight and is
now lying in double irons awaiting the
action of Captain Sigsbee when he
comes on board this morning. The name
of the man could not be learned, but he
is known to have been recruited within
the last couple of days as an oiler. He
was first noticed acting suspiciously on
one of the coal bunkers, and a guard
was placed over him. When searched,
drawings of the vessel were found se
creted about his clothes.

VIENNA, May 3.â A very despondent
view has been taken here since the Ma

I the Spanish dynasty is nearing its
{ end and great sympathy is expressed
for the Queen Regent in her dire trou-

FIELD OFFICERS OF FIRST REGIMENT UNITED STATES VOLUNTEERS.
CALLED FOR DUTY
ACROSS THE SEAS
NEW YORK, May 3: â The Herald's Washington corrrespondent telegraphs: The plans for occupation of the
Philippine Islands by military force have been practically perfected, and will be put into effect as soon as Co mmodore
Dewey reports to Washington the situation in the East.
As a result of the consultation to-day between the President, Secretaries Long and A'ger and Major -General Miles
instructions were sent to General Merriam, commander of the Department of California, to concentrate without delay
regular and volunteer troops in San Francisco. Arrangements are being made for transports which will convey American
troops to Manila, and authorities have been in consultation with Senator Perkins and others in regard to steamer accom
modations that can be had.
Secretary Long has also been considering to-day the question of dispatching supplies to Commodore Dewey and
of providing a guard to convoy transports and supply ships to Manila* Telegraphic instructions were sent to the
Navy Pay Office in San Francisco to invite proposals for furnishing transports and colliers.
Instructions were also sent to Rear-Admiral Kirkland, commanding at Mare Island Navy-yard, to expedite work of
repairing the cruisers Charleston and Philadelphia so that these ships can be available, for the Charleston is practically
ready for immediate service. She will be commanded by Captain Henry Glass, and her detail of officers will be at once
prepared by Captain A. S. Crowinshield, chief of the Bureau of Navigation.
It is said that at least io.ooo troops will comprise the military expedition. They will include infantry
and artillery, in all probability heavy artillery will also be sent. his balievad by nival expires that the' Spaniards be
fore surrendering to Commodore Dewey disabled all the guns under their control, and that it will be absolutely neces
sary to replace them so as to defend the city against any attempt on the part of Spain to retake it. On account of the
withdrawal of a great number of regulars from Western departments to the South it will be impossible to place a large
percentage of these men in the expedition, but as many as possible will be sent, and their places in California will be
taken by volunteers, who will be trained as quickly as possible.
The plans now prepared by the War and Navy departments are naturally of a tentative character, and nothing
will be done looking to their execution until official advices are received from Commodore Dewey. That officer will re-j
port to Secretary Long the character of supplies he needs and whether an army should be sent to his support.
it is believed in departmental circles that he will be able to preserve order at Manila, but, should he be unsuc
cessful, then it is expected he will invite British and German men-of-war in the harbor to land sailors and marines to
protect their own property while he takes necessary steps to provide protection for the remainder of the city.
Commander R. B. Bradford, chief of Bureau of Equipment, said to me to-day: "I see no reason for anxiety in
the matter of coal for vessels of Commodore'Dewey's fleet. The position of Commodore Dewey is not, I believe, a
difficult one, and he will be able to overcome it. It is understood here that Commodore Dewey made contracts with
Hongkong merchants for delivery of coal on the high seas. It was also pointed out that there are several English coal
dealers residents in Manila who will be able to buy coaf in China and Hongkong to transport it to Manila for sale for
Commodore Dewey's ships. Should Commodore Dewey be unable to purchase sufficient coal for his vessels a large
supply will be sent to him from San Francisco, where the Government has 4000 tons. Captain Charles O'Neil, chief of
the Bureau of Ordnance, intends to make arrangements for shipping a large supply of ammunition to the American
squadron at Manila. Enough will be sent to refill the magazines of all the ships in the far East."

THE FIRST WILL BE
MUSTERED TO-DAY
The Seventh Will Follow Closely on Their
Heels and Then All Will Be Ready
for War.
To-day the First Infantry Regiment
of the National Guard of California
will be mustered into the United States
army as volunteers. Immediately fol
lowing this transfer from State to Fed
eral service the Seventh Infantry Regi
ment, with headquarters at Los An
geles, will be transported by rail to
this city and mu3tered into Uncle Sam's
army of volunteers.
The news of Commodore Dewey's
splendid victory at Manila, the mes
sages from the East that Illinois and
Ohio troops were clamoring to be sent
to San Francisco to join an expedition
to re-enforce the gallant Dewey at the
Philippines, the general impatience in
California over the long delay In mus
tering into the volunteer service the
troops of this State, all conduced to im
part life and vigor yesterday to the
operations at headquarters in the Cali
fornia Hotel. Little time was lust in
the consideration of trivial details. It
â¢was at once obvious t<> the adjutant
general, to Captain Carrington and tin
numerous staff officers on duty at
headquarters that the Governor was
determined to wait no longer for blanks
and forms. It ivas realized that the
chance of getting a California regi
ment to the Gulf front had about van
ished, hence there was a determina
tion to move at once in order to have
troops ready to join the proposed
column for the Philippines.
Fortunately for all concerned the
mail that arrived from the Bast early
yesterday morning brought to Captain
Carrington, the mustering officer, the
anxiously awaited blank*. Governor
Budd at once directed Adjutant-Gen
eral Barrett to inform the mustering
officer that California's quota as
for by the President was awaiting or
ders to pret-eed to the point of rendez
vous. Captain Cvrfngton at once offi
cially replied that he would be ready at
8 o'clock this morning to begin muster
ing in the men of California's quota
under the call.
This positive statement was received
satisfaction. Thereupon Governor

Captain Louis H. Turner of the

He wired from Seattle last night to
General Barrett to this effect. Turner
is in command of the Naval Militia of
California and is hastening home for

battalion will accept the offer of the
Secretary of the Navy to enter the
United States navy as acting officers,
as the pay is small and they all want
to stay with their organizations.

alive with Interest and enthusiasm this

California has seventeen fine additional companies of infantry of the Na

twenty-four hours' notice. They i-onsisist of two regiments, one of eight

States as volunteers. If the national Government will refurnish the Na

so as to allow us to furnish three full regiments of infantry of twelve com
panies each.

came excitement.
Colonel J. R. Berry, in speaking of the
matter this evening", said: The Seventh
Regiment is in as fine condition as any
regiment of the guard in California, We
are simply overjoyed at the opportunity
which h;;s been afforded us to go to the
front, and we will demonstrate by deeds
the truth of this declaration."
The officers and men of the Seventh all
feel that they will experience no difficulty
in passing muster. The truth is they are
a stalwart lot of well-developed young
men, and but few of them are lacking in
physical requirements. They are all well
drilled and are really up-to-date soldiers.
Headquarters for the volunteer regi
ment raised here last week have been
opened at the Nadeau Hotel. The ser
vices of the regiment have been proffered
to the President by Congressman Barlow
and Senator White. No difficulty will be
experienced here in recruiting the Nation
al Guard up to th% standard after the
Seventh Regiment has departed..

THE ANGEL ISLAND BAND.
Musicians of the Third Artillery Came
Over Yesterday and Gave
Music at Retreat.
Aside from the feeling of suspense pre- |
vailing among the regular army stationed {
at the Presidio there is very little of im- j
portance going on. Kach mail, however,
is expected to bring orders from General !
Merriam, commander of the departments j
of California and the Columbia, which it
is hoped will break the monotony of wait- '
ing and give some definite information re- |
garding the future movements of troops j
stationed at and near San Francisco, j
Many of the officers signify their earnest
desire to go to Manila, and it is reasoned
that such officers as may be designated !
by the Government to go with the troops
from this coast should be selected from
among the regular army officers stationed ]
here, on account of their being at the
nearest military post to the Philippine j
Islands and because they believe it to j
be the most feasible plan to adopt; be-
Bidafl, there is the consideration, of both '
time and expense.
The artillery officers located at the va
rious military posts in the harbor of San
Francisco, said to be the most efficient
of any in thttt branch of the army, ar< ,
especially anxious to make a practical '
demonstration of their ability, and for ,
that reason desire to be sent to some
point where there is a possibility of an
early opportunity to do so.
In'speaking of the encampment of Cali
fornia volunteers on the reservation, the
Officers as a unit express themselves as :
being emphatically opposed thereto, but |
for sanitary reasons only. The place said
to have been selected is west of the Golf .
Ijinks, and lies adjacent to the lake from
which the Marine Hospital and military
post water supply is obtained, and la the
natural watershed from the drainage of. i
which the lake is supplied. It is therefore
believed to be a dangerous place to make
camp, as the seepage would impregnate
the water of the lake and thus imperil the
lives of the men. Point Lobos and Point
Bontta were suggested as being well
adapted for the purposes of a camp; be- â¢
sides affording excellent landing places
from the water, both points should be :
garrisoned^ Â ;
The army regulations governing the po
licing of military posts are being strictly
enforced at the Presidio, and no one need
be surprised to be commanded to halt ana
instructed to turn back at any point in t
the reservation. While visitors have not ,
j been altogether excluded, they are. how
i ever, kept at a reasonable distance from
any point at which guns are located,
i X portion of the road formerly used has
1 been closed to the public, and sentries
have been posted there to stop all who

Some excitement was caused yesterday j
by the capture of a man in the act of
stealing bottles from the ''Canteen. As
the bottles were discovered to be empty,
his captors concluded that the man must
be demented, so after investigating the
matter Lieutenant Nolan had the culprit
escorted from the reservation.

BIG SEA
BATTLE
Sampson Must Meet and
Destroy the Powerful
Spanish Fleet.
Until That Is Done There Will
Be No Attempt Made to
Invade Cuba.
NEW YORK, May 3.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: Spain's fleet in the Atlantic
must be annihilated before an attempt
Is made to capture Havana. This was
the conclusion arrived at by the War
Board to-day, and it is probable that
a naval engagement will be fought be
tween the Spanish fleet now on its way
across the Atlantic and the armored
vessels of Admiral Sampson's* com
mand, re-enforced by C<-:fhmodore
Schley's flying squadron, before any
steps are taken to land an army of in
vasion In the island of Cuba, The pol
icy of the administration will be to
make the campaign against Havana
short, sharp and decisive. In order to
do this, an adequate force must have
the co-operation of all of the armored
vessels that can be brought into ser
vice for the bombardment of Morro
Castle and the other defenses of Ha
vana harbor.
With Spain's fleet rapidly steaming
westward, there would not be time to
reduce Havana before the fleet must be
met. It is also thought to be unadvis
able to risk the disabling of any of the
armored vessels at Sampson's com
mand by the guns of Morro Castle be
fore the Spanish fleet has been met.
With this fleet once swept from the
Atlantic, Admiral Sampson could con
centrate for the attack on Havana an
overwhelming force. If the present
plans of the War Department are car
ried out there is reason to believe there
will soon be a union of the heaviest
ships under Admiral Sampson's com
mand -with the vessels of the flying
squadron. The combined fleet that
â¢would thus be available for operation
against the Spanish fleet would consist
of the armored cruisers New York and
Brooklyn, the first-class battle-ships
lowa, Indiana and Massachusetts, and
the second-class battle-ship Texas,
combined with such cruisers, converted
yachts and other small crart as Ad
miral Sampson might deem advisable
to use for scouts and torpedo-boat de-
Btroyers.
Three auxiliary cruisersâ the St.
l/oui6, Harvard and Taleâ are now
scouring the Atlantic in search of the
Spanish fleet. The St. Paul will also
go out as soon as her armament has
been oompleted. Each of these ves
sels has a defined cruising araa, and
the ocean Is divided between them in
Euch a way that it is believed to be im
possible for the Spaniards to avoid
them. _
Captain Sigsbee of the St. Paul and
Captain "Wise of the Yale have the ad
vantage of knowing from the Herald's
Bpecial cable from St. Vincent the direc
tion in -which the Spanish fleet sailed,
ANGRY REPLY
TO ENGLAND
Spain Resents an Offer
for the Protection of
Chinese.
Witt Not Permit a British Pro
tectorate Over Those at
Manila.
PrÂ»tead> to Perceive Some. Ulterior
Moti-r* in th* Suggestion From
London.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MADRID, May 3.â Captain General \
Atlgusti wires that the British Consul j
called upon him to say that .he would '
take the Chinese subjects in the Philip- j
pines under the protection of the Brit
ish flag to safeguard their lives and i
property. The Captain General added
that a number of rich and influential
Chinese at Manila had assured him that
they were satisfied with the protection
of Spain. â , ,
Moret, Minister of the Colonies re
plied to Captain General Augusti that
there was no reason to accept the pro
toctorate which the British Consul
wished to exercise.
The British Consul's offer has been
communicated to the powers. The wV- J
eminent apparently sees some deep la,id
machination on the part of Great Brit- j
am, for the official note says: j
"This news caused surprise, although
people are accustomed to the methods
of those who direct British interests.
"What can be the object of the Brit- ,
lsh request? China is not in a position
to expect thlr. or any other protectorate, ,
but the British take it upon themselves
to be the protectors < : the Celestial em
pire against the French, Russians and !
Germany, undoubtedly to acquire a j
new title to the protectorate of Chinese j
In the Philippine: Th* Spanish Gov- |
ernment cannot accept the rule offered '
it, and rejects the proposition, at the j
same time informing thÂ« powers who j
are not disposed to allow Great Britain
to protect China that they have squad
rons in the far east themselves for that
purpose." â 
Testing a Poll-Tax Law.
CARSON, May B.â The application for a
â¢writ of mandate marlp by the Morning
Appeal to compel the registration of John
Wilson, a printer in its office who had
not paid a poll tax, was argued by Hon.
William Woodburn before the Supreme
Court to-day and submitted. The case
will test the validity of the poll tax law
and affect the right of nearly half the
citizens of Nevada to vote at the forth
oomlng eleotlon.
and this will be of great use to them
in locating it upon the ocean, as its
approximate speed is known and its
probable location at any given hour
can be figured out. As soon as one of
| the auxiliary vessels sights the Span
! ish fleet and ascertains its location and
| direction the commanding officer will
| proceed with all the speed to the near-
I est cable station and communicate with
Washington.
The movements of the fighting fleet
under Admiral Sampson will be gov
erned by this information. It will be
his object to meet the Spaniards and
give battle before they can either reach
a coaling base or strike any American
point, toM-ard which they may be head
ed. If two of the scouting vessels
i should fall in with the Spaniards about
, the same time it will be the duty of
! one of them to keep in touch with the
i enemy and report any change of di
rection that may be made after the first
vessel has left. No fear is fel for
the safety of the scouts, as they are
all fast enough to get out of the way of
the Spanish fleet if any attempt should
j be made to attack them.
The exact strength of the Spanish
: fleet is not known. It is known to con
| sist of at least four armored cruisers
j and three torpedo-boat destroyers.
Whether the three torpedo-boats which
first sailed with the fleet put back into
St. Vincent and then went to sea again
have finally joined the fleet is not
known. Neither is it known whether
! the armored cruiser Carlos V is with
the fleet. If she is it includes five
armored cruisers. There is little
: anxiety felt here as to the outcome of
the battle that will ensue when Ad
miral Sampson finally falls in with the
! Spanish fleet. The armored vessels of
'' his command outnumber the enemy's
ships. His four battleships outclass
them in guns and armor. The Spanish
armored cruisers, however, are all very
efficient vessels, and three high-speed
i torpedo-boat destroyers are not to be
I despised. It can hardly be hoped that
the American fleet will come out of the
I battle -without serious losses. It is be
lieved, however, that Captain Samp
i son's men are far superior in gunnery
I practice to the Spanish sailors, and
| victory is expected to result as much
I from this superiority as from the su
i perior force of the American ships.
Rather more anxiety is felt on ac
count of the Spanish torpedo-boat de
stroyers than on account of the
j armored cruisers, and Captain Samp
son's first efforts will doubtless be di
rected toward sinking these dangerous
little crafts before they can get close
enough to any of his vessels to use
their torpedoes with effect. To accom
â  plish their destruction reliance will be
placed on the steadiness and accuracy
of the crews of secondary batteries on
the American ships.

KEY WEST, Fla., May 3.â Skirmishes
between the vessels of the blockading j
squadron and Spanish forces on the j
Island are becoming almost of daily j
occurrence. Early this morning the
cruiser Wilmington and the torpedo
boat Ericsson were patrolling the coast
about five miles east of Cojimar. A
force of several hundred Spanish cay- j
airy and infantry emerged from a ra- i
vine between two wooded hills and de- |
ployed on the shore in a defiant man- j
ner. Both vessels were unusually close
in shore, the Ericsson being not more
than 800 yards from the breakers.
On observing the soldiers the Wil- '
mington and Ericsson started to get out j
of the line of fire and the torpedo boat |
turned and started seaward like a gull. I
When the Spanish noticed this seeming j
withdrawal they emitted a roar of i
"Vivas," plainly audible, and sent a j
volley after the Ericsson. Balls fell like
hail about the little craft, but no one
aboard was struck.
The Wilmington returned the fire
with shrapnel] shells from her four-inch
guns. One burst in the midst of a troop I
of cavalry, causing great damage and i
consternation. One horse was observed 'â 
to go down with its rider.
The Spanish retired precipitately, 'â¢
carrying off their injured. The full loss I
they sustained is not known.

THE SA3* FRANCISCO CALI,, WEDNESDAY, MAY 4, 1898.
NO SENSE OF HONOR,
NO SENSE OF HUMOR
Richard Harding Davis on the Pecu=
culiarities of the Modern Spanish
Character.
ON BOARD the United States fl agship New York, of the blockading squadron, off Havana, via Key West,
May 3.â More harm is likely to be done the navy of the United States by General Blanco's dispatches than by Span
ish batteries; that is. harm may be done in Europe, if Europe believes General Blanco's dispatches.
General Blanco is a well-meaning officer, but he is dependent for his information upon inferior officers, a class of
men who have prolonged the war in Cuba because it meant for them more pay, more stripes and counties; decorations.
It is impossible, even if it were worth while, to enumerate and deny all the false stones that have been sent to
Madrid since the war was declared, but it may be of interest to dissect some of them.
Of the bombardment of the earthworks at Matanzas Blanco says in his official report: Three American cruis
ers fired on the batteries at Fort Morrillo, Matanzas. without doing any harm. We fired fourteen shots, to which the
Americans replied with a multitude of mitrailleuse shots, which did not do us any damage."
This was received in Madrid with gre.it rejoicing as an American repulse at Matanzas. The truth 19 that Ad
miral Sampson was practicing with his guns and steadying his crew, with the same purpose that a theatrical man
ager will go into the gallery and tell the stage hand to speak to him on the stage that he may test the acoustic prop
erties of the house. What the stage hand says is of no importance to the manager; all he wants to know is that the
house is adapted for the real performance, yet to come.
Troops may be landed later at Matanzas, and it was to discourage work on the batteries which covered tne
point of their possible landing that the shots were fired. The mitrailleuse referred to were eight-inch guns throwing
250-pound shells, and they did some damage. I saw them cut the ramparts down and lift them into doud3 of earth
fifty feet high. , Â .
One out of three of the shells fired sunk fairly into the breast of the earthworks. At 4000 and 7000 yards, which
were the distances, this was good marksmanship. Had the ramparts been battle-ships of the same length, 300 leet,
they would have been disabled or sunk in five minutes. Captain Mac Hugh of the London Artillery Company, who
watched the bombardment from the Herald yacht, described it to me to-day as the most accurate and rapid firing he
had ever witnessed at that range.
Contrary to Blanco's statement, none of the American ships was hit.
Another dispatch to Madrid describes the cruiser Montgomery as running ashore, and three cruisers dragging
her off in a badly damaged condition. .
This is correct, except at that time the Montgomery was 1000 miles away, coming south from Norfolk, and
that no American ship has run ashore or been damaged. This dispatch was to show how badly the American war
ships were handled. . , , ,
The report of the victorious repute of three American torpedo boats at Cardenas by one Spanish torpedo boat
and their retreat in a shattered condition was founded on the fact that the Foote ran into the bay of Cardenas and ex
changed shots with two torpedo boats. She then turned and left the harbor. The Machias was running into help
her but turned bacj< when she saw the Foote was returning. None of the boats was hit on either side. I his was
described as a naval victory for Spain. In fact, all that these people say or do at present is an exaggeration
They are not responsible. They are excited and they twist events out of their proper proportion. They are all
blown out by bursts of passion, fits of hysterics. In Madrid the mob pulls down the wooden American eagle ad
vertising an insurance company and feels better. In Havana a man bites his arm and sucks his blood to show that he
longs for that of his enemy. They are children, with all of a child's unreasonable rage. Their idea as to how civil
ized warfare is conducted is shown by the fact that the crew of every prize vessel we have taken receives the boarding
officer either on their kness or with their hands above their heads in token of submission Some beg for mercy,
some to" to leap overboard, some lock themselves in the cabins. They expect to be shot down or hanged to the yard
arm ' We had one Spanish officer on board here who told the wardroom that had he known war was declared he
would sooner than have been captured, blown his brains out with his revolver. This impressed us until an inquisitive
"middy" examined his revolver and disclosed the fact that it was empty and that the breech would not work.
The other day the Foote, a s nail torpedo boat, ran into the harbor of Matanzas and the batteries fired six shots

THE FRENCH
ARE AMAZED
At the Lack of Fore
thought Shown by
Spaniards.
Should Never Have Permitted
Americans to Enter Manila
Bay.
It Would Not BÂ« Safe Now for
Europe to Intervene for
Peace.
Copyrighted. 189S, by James Gordon Bennett.
PARIS, May 3. â A deep Impression
has been' produced in Paris by the vic
tory of Cavlte, which is the absorbing
topic of conversation, not only among
public men, but in clubs, saloons, and,
indeed, every place where people con
gregate. I conversed with several
French officers and admirals respect-
Ing the battle of Monday. Most of
them considered resistance on the part
of the Spaniards out of the question,
in view of the superiority of the Amer
ican vessels, but they did not expect
such rapid and crushing defeat.
"What passes comprehension," said
an admiral, "is the want of forethought
and the absence of serious preparation
for defense revealed by this first dis
aster.' The entrance of the American
ships into the bay of Manila without
being perceived or disturbed by torpe
does, electric searchlights or the bat
teries of the island of Corregidor seems
to me almost as impossible an event as
might have been the appearance of a
foreign ironclad in time of war in the
harbor of Brest.
"The unlucky Spanish vessels, badly
protected and armed, once confronted
with American cannon were doomed to
certain destruction."
"Do you think it probable that an
other battle with the Spanish fleet
would end in a similar way? '
â¢It is always hazardous to make pre
, dictions in such cases, hut it appears
I to me that with the exception of three
! or four Spanish vessels, such as the
Pelayo or Vizcayn. few ships of their
navy are capable of meeting the Ameri
can ironclads, but the results of battles
are not limited to question of numbers
and armaments. Other elements must
be taken into account, unfortunately
for the Spaniards. What we have seen
of their tirst efforts at defense testifies
only to their bravery and not to their
experience or forethought."
At the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
the most absolute reserve is maintain
ed, the officials being concerned above
everything in not departing from the
strict neutrality which the French Gov
ernment has adopted. In an interview
with one of the highest officials there
I alluded to circumstances which pos
sibly in the ne^r future might give rise
to the friendly intervention of Euro
pean powers.
"Assuredly,* he said, "one would
have to despair of the progress of hu

in the eyes of the stronger of the two

incontestable superiority, cannot bat be
regarded as a war of extermination.

HERALD-CALL'S
WAR NEWS IS
YET THE BEST
First and Only Accurate Story
Published of the Great Vic=
tory in Manila Bay.
NEW YORK, May 3.â The Herald will say editorially to-morrow: The
Herald yesterday pave another striking proof of the superior efficiency of
Its war news service. It was the first newspaper In the world to receive
direct from Manila the news of the great naval battle, as it was
the first and with the exception of these papers in other parts of the
country which have secured the privilege of using its special cable dis
patches, was the only newspaper in America able to publish an account of
the engagement from an American source, all previous reports having been
from Spanish sources, supplemented by brief consular announcements to
the British Government.
The Herald's graphic dispatch not only gave the American public the first
direct independent intelligence that Commodore Dewey had annihilated the
Spanish squadron without material injury to his own fleet, but it was wel
comed with relief by President McKinley and official circles in Washington
anxiously awaiting direct news from the distant scene of conflict.
Needless to say the Herald news. In this instance of exceptional im
portance as it always is. was entirely genuine. It was written in Manila
and cabled to tho Paris ani New York offices by a Herald correspondent
on the spot, who had been expressly sent there some time ago in antici
pation of this very emergency- We may add that the Herald also has a
special correupondent, who is a trained naval expert, with Commodore
Dewey's fleet. He was therefore an eyewitness of the memorable battle
of Sunday and the subsequent action of our fleet against Manila.
The first of his special dispatches to the Herald has been hourly ex
pected It will be sent the moment that Commodore Dewey succeeds In
effecting cable communication with the outer world and will be duly pub
lished in the Herald. Readers of the Herald may therefore look out for a
eraphic account of the glorious victory in Manila Bay, which will be as in
structive to student* of naval warfare as it will be absorbing to the general
public.
But, however, much we may desire to
find' an acceptable solution, when there |
has been rapid advantage gained on I
one side and defeat has been honorably :
borne by the other, it would be a dan
gerous illusion to believe in the possibil
ity of intervention if it were prema
turely or Indiscreetly offered. The only
thing is to wait until events render it,
in the opinion of all, necessary, or until
it is desired by the parties concerned.'
NEVILLS-AZHDERIAN
SENSATION GROWS.
Mrs. Williams Sues the Capitalist
and Is in Turn Accused of At
tempted Extortion.
FRESNO, May 3.â The fight between
Captain W. A. Nevills, the capitalist.
and M. H. Azhderian, Mrs. Elsie Wil
liams and her sister, Mrs. Grace E.
Loose, a few preliminary skirmishes
in which have taken place in the courts,
is rapidly nearing a focus. To-day
both sides opened fire and the result
is awaited with much interest. This
afternoon Mrs. Williams commenced a
sensational action against the wealthy
vineyardist and mine owner, suing him
for betrayal, or rather for the balance
claimed to be due on account of be
trayal. The complaint alleges . that
the captain betrayed the fair plaintiff
and promised to pay her $12,500, in
which amount she is alleged to have
suff'-red in health and reputation. She
states that she was paid $2000, but the
balance still is unpaid.
A retaliatory measure on the part of
Nevills was a warrant for arrest on a
charge of attempted extortion. The
complaint was prepared in this city to
day by Neville 1 attorneys and a war

rant was Issued by Judge St. John. It
was placed in the hands of Constable
Dumas for service and this evening he
arrested Mrs. Loose, but Mrs. Williams
and Azhderain could not be found.
They were seen to drive off in a buggy
shortly before 5 o'clock.
The complaint was not sworn to by
Captain Nevills. as one would suppose,
but by his son, W. E. Nevills, who was
in the city to-day, having come down
for that purpose. Father and son have
not been on good terms for some time,
but a reconciliation at this opportune
time has been effected. It is said that
one of the trio wrote a letter to the son
asking him to "stand in" against his
father, and that is how he happens to
be the complainant.

NEW YORK, May 3.â The Herald's

made by the Spanish commander to re

Diplomatic representatives of the

RELATIVE OF
WEYLER TAKEN
Identity of the Colonel
> Caught on the Prize
Argonauta.
Believed to Be thÂ© Bearer of
Important Instructions
to Blanco.
Temerity of thÂ« Spanish Gunboats
In Defense of the Vessel
Explained.
Copyrighted. 1898, by James Gordon Bennett.
KEY WEST, May 3.â ThÂ© Spanish
steamer Argonauta, which was cap
tured of Cienfuegos last Saturday by
the cruiser Marblehead and the gun
boats Nashville and Eagle after a live
ly skirmish with Spanish gunboats, was
towed into this port to-day by the Mar
blehead. She carried important mail
and dispatches for General Blanco and
had on board a relative of General
Weyler, bound for Cuba, which proba
bly explains the desperate chances he
took in trying to run the blockade and
the astonishing temerity displayed by
the Spanish gunboats in a vain attempt
to defend her.
The dispatches are in the possession
of Admiral Sampson, and it is said
that they will prove valuable to the
fleet commander as indicating Spain's
intentions and Captain Blanco's Â»itua
tion.
Colonel Vicente de Cortijo, who was
captured with his staff and a detail of
soldiers, disclaims any blood relation
ship to Weyler. Colonel de Cortijo was
formerly on General Weyler's staff in
Cuba and sustained very confidential
relations with him during his military
reign on the island. Being perfectly
familiar with the military operations in
Cuba, his advice would have been of
great value to Blanco at present. He
undoubtedly is the bearer of instruc
tions to the captain-g-eneral which were
too important to be intrusted to the or
dinary means of transmission. General
Blanco will, however, miss both Col
onel de Cortijo and his advice, for the
colonel will be courteously but securely
detained for an indefinite period at Key
West.
Cubans here, particularly General
Nunez and his staff, are jubilant over
the capture of Colonel de Cortijo and
incline to the belief that he was sent
as a forerunner of Weyler.
Right here it may be said that the
Cubans will be willing to guarantee
General Weyler a safe passport to Ha
vana If he will return to Cuba.
The Argonauta Is a serviceable
steamer of about 1200 tons, but her car
go Is light and of comparatively small
value. The Marblehead brings the news
that the damage to the Eagle, which
was reported struck by shots from the
Spanish gunboats in an engagement, Is
trivial.. There were no casualties on
the American side.
General Nunez left Key West last
night. Before leaving he consulted with
I the navy and army officer* hÂ«re. Late
gon, the gunboat Marietta and tha
cruiser Nictheroy. or Buffalo, as she 13
known in naval service, will leave Rio
to-morrow for Key West. The Nicthe
roy was sold to the United .States by
Brazil without her battery. It is under
stood in naval circles that arrange
ments have been made by Captain
Clark for the delivery of guns outside
of the three-mile limit and a respect
able battery will be on board the ship
before she proceeds very far on her
voyage. Captain Clark will, therefore,
have under his command quite a for
midable force and will be able to give
the Spaniards a hard fitrht should he
fall in with them.
While believing- that the Spanish
fleet now on its way across the Atlan
tic is bound for Porto Rico, should it
not be reported by scouts distributed
on the Atlantic before Monday next
the department's attention will be di
rected toward saving the Oregon,
which it may be seeking. Captain
Clark, it is expected, will stop at
Bahia, Brazil, on his way north, a dis
tance of 745 miles, in order to commu
nicate with the department. This dis
tance cannot be covered under three
days and a half, ro that his arrival
cannot be reported before Saturday
night.
By that time the department expects
to have heard something as to the lo
cation of the Spanish fleet and will be
able to advise Captain Clark accord
ingly. There is no intention to un
necessarily hazard the Oregon and the
ships which will accompany her, and
should it be found that Spanish men
of-war are at a point on her course
awaiting her arrival, the Oregon will
be held at Bahia until this Government
is able to send a strong force to her
aid.
Through an unofficial channel the
department learned to-day that the
Spanish battle-ship Pelayo and the
protected cruiser Alfonso XIII are still
at Cadiz. It is not known what has
become of the armored cruiser Carlos
V, and it is considered possible that
she may have joined the fleet now on
its way west. The last heard of the
Carlos V was that she had left Ferrol,
Spain, and was cruising in European
waters on the lookout for American
prizes.
this afternoon Colonel Baldamino "Acos
ta and Colonel Elsio Coloya, both of
the Cuban army, departed on a mission
similar to that of General Nunez.
Besides the Argonauta only one prize
swelled the number in the harbor to
day. This was the schooner Antonio y
Paca, which is loaded with fish. Her
destination was Havana, but she was
intercepted twenty miics off Morro Cas
tle by the Newport and Castine. The
Castine towed hor across. The value
of her -cargo is small

THE GENERALS
TO COMMAND
VOLUNTEERS
The President Decides on
Four Major and Eight
Brigadier Generals
Names That Will Be Sent Up to
the Senate for Confirma
tion Not Later Than
To-Day.
' NEW YORK, May 3.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: After due
deliberation the President has decided
to formally announce the appointment
of four major generals and eight brig
adier generals. The nominations are
expected to go to the Senate to-mor
row.
The greatest interest naturally cen
ters around the aelection of major gen
erals. Tip pr vent any insinuation of
sectionalism th<- President has selected
General Fitzhugh Lee of Virginia and
General Joseph Wheeler of Alabama as
representatives of the Southern volun
teer?, and General James EL Wilson of
Delawan ral William J. Sew
ell of New Jersey as representatives of
the Northern forces.
The l!Â«Â»t of brigadier generals who
â will be nominated to the Senate simul
taneously with the fÂ«>ur major generals
will include <'.â¢:. me! Charles E. Comp
ton of tii" Fourth Cavalry, Colonel
Thomas M. Anderson of the Fourteenth
Infantry. Colonel William Ludlow of
the engineer corps. Inspector General
J. C. Bfecklnridge, Colonel Theo
Bchwan. ad jutant general's department,
end Colonel H. W. L&wton of the in
spector general's department.
The selection of General Sewell
comes in the nature of a surprise, for
he "will hav<- to relinquish his seat in
the United States Senate, which is one i
of the most tempting prizes in national i
politics. General Sewell tendered his j
services to the President at the first
Intimation of war with Spain, and it
Tcvas not until to-day that the President
concluded to accept the offer. After a
personal Interview with the President
and Secretary Alger General Sewell in
formed his friends that a commission !
had been offered him and he had ac
cepter! it.
Later in the day General Wilson, ac
companied by Senator uray of Dela
ware, called at thÂ« White House and
received from the President the an
nouncement that his appointment had
been decided upon. General Wilson is
a fine specimen of physical manhood,
and he looks every Incn a soldier. He
made a favorable impression upon all !
â¢who met him at the \\hite House and |
at the War Department, and his np- <
p'ointmem gives general satisfaction.
The .selection of Genera] LeÂ« and!
General Wheeler had bepn discounted
by assurances the President had given
these two gallant officers and their
friends, so that their appointment had j
_been regarded as n. foregone conclu- i
Bk-n for more th;;n a week past.
There are a number of other candi
dates for major-generals' commissions,
but for the present the President has
determined to select but four volun- !
/teer officers for these high-grade p'.si- '
tions. If in the future he should deem j
It advisable to increase the number he i
Btifl has a valuable supply of military !
material to draw upo-n.
â¢ One of the most conspicuous names;
recently ETrought to the consideration i
of tho President for a major-general's i
commission is that of ex-Senator But- !
ler of South Carolina. General Butler!
â¢was one of the most daring and skill- j
ful -cavalry commanders in the <'on-J
federate service, and although he is <
past 60 years, lie Is one of the best-pre- I
eerved men in public life to-day. His j
name was presented to the President by
Wb political rival and partisan enemy j
Senator TNlman. As- soon as it was j
known that the name of General But- ,
ler had been suggested to the President
all the leading members .of the Senate, j
Republicans and Democrats alike, I
with whom General Butler had served!
his three terms in the Senate, united !
In the request to the President for his
appointment. It is quite an unusual
thing for Senators of all factions and j
parties to come together when an im
portant appointment is at stake.
.General Butler had an interview with
the .President and Secretary Alger to
daY and assured them that while he ap- I
predated the high compliment ten- j
dered him by his Senatorial friends he j
did not wish the President to be infill- !
enced in his behalf by their recommen- ]
dation. .He added that he was ready j
and willing to serve his country in any
capacity and any position to which he !
might be assigned, and expressed the
hope that the President would not con- j
sider him as a seeker for military or
sivic honors..
I learn to-night that the President ;
ha 9 determined to commission all of the ]
present brigadier-generals in the regu- !
lar army as major-generals in the vol
unteer army, and that their nomina
tions for increased rank will probably ]
go to the Senate to-morrow^ with the j
other four major-generals and eight j
fcrigadier- generals decided upon early
In the day.
The Bix brigadier-generals of the
regular army who will thus receive j
major-general commissions are Gen- |

Washington. May 3.
According to advices heretofore re
ceived by Adjutant-General Corbin, the
mustering of the soldiers of the volun
teer army was to have begun in most
of the States to-day. As soon as this
â¢ formality is accomplished they become
regular United States troops, avail
able for any service which the Presi
dent may call upon them to perform.
Ip to the close of office hours, however,
reports on that subject had been re
ceived only from Massachusetts and
Arizona.
With the limited force in charge of j
this work at the various rendezvous
points the mustering necessarily will
tske from two days to ten or more, ac
cording to the size of the States' I
quotas. One regiment a day is consid- |
ered very fair progress. The officials I
are now giving their attention to ques- j
tions of mobilization, .transportation I
and subsistence, and by the time the j
soldiers are ready to move these ques
tions will have been settled.
Secretary Alger to-day directed that
an amendment be made to the army
regulations which will require that
during the time of war all officers of
the army and navy shall wear ihe uni
form of their rank at the placed where
they may be stationed. This change
was determined upon at a Cabinet
meeting to-day. Especially is this
change desirable in the offices of the
War and Navy Departments in this
city, where, during certain hours of_ the
day a strict surveillance is kept of

MADRID, May 4.â The floors and
galleries of the Oortes were crowded at
to-day's sitting and some lively scenes
ensued. Senor Salmeron said that be
fore questioning the Government the
house ought to pay its tribute of ad
miration to the Spanish sailors at
Cavite, adding:
"When It has been ascertained how
much blood has been shed and how
much money expended, it will be neces
sary to establish the responsibility at
taching to the crown as well as to the
least citizen."
Murmurs of protest followed this re
mark. The president of the chamber
caller! Sen ir Salmeron to order, and
directed his attention to the article of
the constitution establishing the in
violability of the crown.
Senor Salmeron continued, demand
ing information as to the situation in
Manila Bay, and insisting that this
question should be discussed after the
Government had given its explana
tions. He proceeded to criticize the
monarchical governments of the last
half century, notably that of the
Restoration, declaring that they were
responsible for the situation.
Senor Silvela interposed, "We are
now threatened with an impotent dic
tatorship, inspired by the genius of the
disciples of Loyola," a remark which
provoked protests from the conserva
tive benches.
Senor Salmeron renewed his demands
for an explanation ef the cause of the
reverse the fleet had sustained.
Just at this moment General Weyler
entered the chamber and seated him
self between the Republican and the
Carlist groups. Salmeron continued,
deploring the unpatriotic attitude of
the conservatives, and attributed the
country's ills to the "worn out regime
under which he lives." He concluded:
"We expend millions to maintain the
monarchy, but have not enough to buy
ironclads. Whoever will destroy the
existing regime will be a great pat
riot."
This declaration was received with
loud conservative protests.
Senor Sagasta made a determined re
: ply, which was loudly applauded by a
large majority of the Chamber. He
began by deploring the fact that the
; Spaniards were not united "in the pres
ent circumstances, when the country is
i involved in a war forced upon it." If
jit ever were criminal to attack the
j fatherland, he said, it was surely more
jso now. Eulogizing the men who had
; fallen in battle, he declared it impera
j tlve that Spaniards should show them
selves energetic and he appealed to all
parties to unite. He begged the Cham
! ber to adopt the necessary war credits.
"I ask it," he said, "in the name of
1 the soldiers and In the name of the
fatherland."
The republicans and Carlists greeted
I Senor Sagasta with angry denuncia
tions, shaking their fists and giving
other marks of disapproval, while the
republicans and monarchists exchanged
i hot recriminations. But the debate
â  itself fell short of expectations, Senor
i Sa&asta's reservation of the desired ex
planations depriving it of interest.
The heads of all political sections
agreed not to oppose any measures the
Government required to conduct the
war. The chief interest attached to the
speech of Senor Jose Canalejas, who
declared that he 1 elonged to no politi
cal party and could speak with entire
independence.
The editor of El Heraldo severely
criticized the unpreparedness of the
Government. He said that he learned
while on his visit to America and Cuba
that the Americans meant war and
were rapidly preparing for it, being per
fectly acquainted with Spain's means of
attack and defense, but, he said, had
the Spanish Government not been so
yielding and had It confronted the !
Yankees with a powerful army they :
would never have gone to war. He 'â 
said he considered it preferable to give
Cuba independence than embark on a
foreign war without preparation.
An incident of the day was the spec
tacle of such strange companions as
Senor Salmeron voting with Senor Mel
la, the Carlist, and Senor Romero y-
Robledo, the Conservative. It caused
one member to cry ironically:
"Good company."
Senor Robledo retorted: "Good Span
ish company."
It is believed the Government Intends
to close the parliament as soon as the
budget is voted. Senor Gasetfs pro
posal to vote a censure upon the Gov
ernment is likely to produce a warm
debate. The minority, though small, is
in possession of brains far above the
average of the deputies.
In the Senate Admiral Beranger.
after an eloquent eulogy of the seamen
who died at Manila, offered his services
to the Government unconditionally.
Senor Sanchez Toca violently pro
tested against the breach of interna
tional law involved In the capture of
Spanish ships by the United States
warships before war had been declared,
and characterized America's conduct as
amounting to piracy.
Senor Capdepon. Minister of the In
terior, explained that a state of siege
had been declared, "because certain
elements had sought to turn the mis
fortunes of the cour/rv' to their own
advantage by trying to arouse political
passions."
Marshal Campos offered the Govern
ment his unconditional support.
Monsignor Herreria, Cardinal Arch
bishop of Santiago de Compostela, said
he spoke because he desired to "stir up
the public mind against the cowardly
Americans." He declared that the
Spanish nations were the victim of the
power of gold."
Senor Gullon, Foreign Minister,
thanked Monsignor Herreria for his pa
triotic speech.

DEMOCRATS
ATTACKED BY
DEMOCRATS
Attempt in the House to
Read Six Members Out
of the Party.
Bitterly Assailed Because They
Voted With the Republicans
on the War Revenue
Call Office. Rlprgs House,
Washington, May 3.
â¢ What promised to be an uneventful
and uninteresting session of the House
was thrown suddenly, after three hours
of consideration of private bills, into a
session of spirited speechmaking among
Democratic members that savored at,
times much of acrimony. The storm
was precipitated by Lewis (D.) of
Washington, who referred in the course
of a speech to the recent vote of Cum
mings of New York in support of the
j war revenue bill, with Its incorporated
bond feature. He made reference to
Cummings' assertion that this period
| was a time for placing country above
party, intimating that the New York
1 "member had served the Republican
' party and perhaps contributed to the
satisfaction of unpatriotic monopolists
and capitalists.
This brought an impassioned speech
j in reply from Cummings, interspersed
â  with some sarcastic comments that in
tensified the interest and called an out
pouring of members from the cloak
i rooms.
Clark (D.) of Missouri entered the
j lists and proceeded to criticize unre
, servedly the six Democrats who had
voted for the revenue bill on its pas
' sage and questioned their Democracy.
Fitzgerald of Massachusetts and Mc
i Aleer of Pennsylvania, two other Dem
| ocrats who voted for the bill, were
I heard in defense of their votes and In
: refutation of the imputations of the
Missouri member. Just before the re
cess until the night session was taken
the leader of the Democrats, Bailey of
! Texas, spoke briefly in deprecation of
I the speeches of the Democratic mem
bers as being subject to misconstruc
tion indicative of more serious differ
ences within the party than really cx
i isted. He reviewed the record to show
1 that no appreciable ground for such
i construction existed.
Lewis (D.) of Washington, recognized
during the consideration of a private pen
sion. Addressed the House, cautioning' it
', against freely removing disabilities from
those who participated in the civil war.
and, proceeding, spoke generally in de
. nunciation of men and corporations who
would seize upon the existence of war as
an opportunity to form trusts and use
the extremity of the Government to se
cure improper profits. Lewis cautioned
: the House against yielding too readily to
the cry of pat riot ism as justification for
' the passage of so-called emergency meas
ures. He declared patriotism was being
â¢ used where reason did not exist to force
unmoritorious propositions through the
House. He referred to members who
"speak magnificently and voted unhap
i plly," and begged the House not to for
. got to look always to the fundamental
principles and justice underlying every
! proposition.
During his speech Lewis referred to the
statement of Cummings <D. t of New
; York in speaking of his vote on the rev
' enue measure, that now was a time to
i place country above party, and. contin
uing, intimated that Cummlngs was ready
to put country above the Democratic
party, but not above the Republican
1 Cummings, replying, declared with
much force that he was. in the time of
the country's need, and at all times, an
American and a Democrat.
"I admire." said the New York member,
good naturedly. "the gentleman from
I Washington. His raiment is spotless, his
hirsute adornments are exquisite and
even his spats are effulgent, all in de-
I lightful accord with the finish and bril
liance of his intellect."
Proceeding, he declared it was the duty
of members intent upon asserting that
their Government's agents were corrupt
;in administration, first to produce their
; evidence, lay It before the House and not
rush to an "indulgence in bald assertion
without substance of basis. Slander of
the Government, either by direct asser
tion or Insinuation, was too sci'ious an oc
cupation to be entered upon ligbtly.
Speaking of his support of Ine revenue
i measure embodying the bond provision
Cummlngs said it was to authorize
the President to issue the bonds in the
nature of a popular loan, rather limn to
deny the express authority of the coun
try in a war emergency with a bond is
sue probably unavoidable, and subject to
the absolute dictation of a syndicate
later on.
Lewis disavowed any purpose to
reflect seriously upon the patriotic mo
tives of the New York member. He said
that his references to him were only in
cidental and his criticism had been
directed at the monoo:>iles which the
j press had declared had already used, and
; expected to use. th* war emergency as a
1 source of unholy profit.
Clark (D.) of Missiouri made quite a
vicious attack upon ex-President Cleve
land, axid denied that be was a Democrat.
Speaking of dimming:;' speech.
Clark said it was the most outrageous
that had been mnde on the floor of the
House. He characterized the votes of Mr.
Cummings and other Democrats who
voted for the bond bill as unpardonable.
He said that they should be read out of
the party. He said Cleveland w;is numi
na'ted because the Democrats thought ho
was the only man who could be elected.
Addressing the Republican side he said
that they talked of the war as a Repub
lican war. This he denied.
"We took you by the scruff of the neck
and dragged' you into it." he said. "It's
our war."
The Democrats, he said, had a right t'"
claim the war. together with the Popu
lists and Silver Republicans, who are
with the Democrats in almost everything.
Mr. Clark made a patriotic reference to
Commodore Dewey.
Cummlngs, responding to Clark, said
he reciprocated fully all the "kind" tilings
said concerning him by the geiHlemaji
from Missouri. Continuing, he briefly
pointed out in a pointed anecdote that
the Missourian was himself responsible
for Missouri having advocated the last
nomination of Mr. Cleveland.
Fitzgerald (D.) of Massachusetts said
he was one of the six Democrats whom
the Missouri member had assumed to
read out of the Democratic party. The
revenue bill was in some particulars nut
strictly In line with Democratic principles.
but he had voted for it as an emergency
measure necessary in this critical period.
and he had supported it just as the mem
ber from Missouri and all Democrats had
supported the $50,000,000 defense bill, which
was not technically Democratic.
McAleer (D.) of Pennsylvania, one of
the six members of his party who sup
ported the revenue bill, declared himself
rev^r more satisfied with a vote than be
was with the one cast in support of the
bill, the immediate passage of which he
considered the country's need demanded.
He denied the right of any man who ad
mitted himself to be a Democrat exactly
in accord with the Populists to question
his Democracy.
Cochrane (D.) of Missouri thought in
the exuberance of the discussion of the
members' patriotism, the merits of the
revenue bill had been forgotten and pro
ceeded to discuss the bill which had
passed the House. He denied that any
necessity for a bond issue would exist.
He !Â»aid"the war could be prosecuted for
$300,000,000 a year and he believed the
American forces could crush Spain be
fore the bonds could Vie sold.
When Cochrnne concluded, Bailey (D.)
of Texas was recognized. He regretted,
he saw. the speeches of the afternoon as
likely to be misconstrued. There has been
a tendency, if not an effort, to magnify
the differences in the Democratic ranks.
The record showed that upon all votes
up to the last upon the revenue bill, all
Democrats had votori together, and whan
the final veto, trying to all, came, but
five or .six Democrats, accustomed to
stand together, had regretfully, but con
scientiously voted for the bill and against
the other Democrats.
TORPEDO-BOAT ROWAN
TESTED BY BUILDERS.
Indications That It Will Exceed the
Required Speed of Twenty-Six
Knots an Hour.
SEATTLE. May 3.â The builders'
preliminary test of the United State*
torpedo-boat Rowan was had to-day.
The boat was in temporary command
of Naval Constructor Lawrence Spear.
For two hours the long, low, knife-like
hull cut the waters of Puget Sound,
leaving scarcely a ripple in its wak*.
The machinery worked satisfactorily
and no doubt is felt as to the boat's
capability of making more than the re
quired Â£6 knots an hour. The official
trial trip will be made in about two
weeks, after which the Rowan will be
ready to do Government service.

NOT BE TAKEN
AT THIS TIME
Aooexation as a War Measure
Falls Through, ar)d the Sena
tors ir) Opposition Are
Firm.
NEW YORK. May 3.â A Washington special to the Herald says:
M< mbers of the Committee on Foreign Relations were In conference
With the President to-day relative to the proposition to annex the
Hawaiian Islands. Senator Davis, Senator Lodge and other Senator
who believe that Hawaii should be annexed to the United States as a
â war measure, if no other good and sufficient reasons can be assigned,
are now convinced that the pending treaty cannot be ratified by the
Senate at this tim<\
They informed the President that opposition to annexation in the
Senate Is just as strong to-day as it was weeks ago. when the subject
was regularly up for discussion. Recent developments in the" Pacific
a, Including the argument that Commodore Dewey's fleet might
be operated to advantage with Hawaii as a base of supplies, appear
to have no effect on the opposition. Within the las! ttfro days the ques
tion has bees discussed In an Informal way by Senators, and there is
a good strong majority in favor of annexation. The position of the
majority has been greatly strengthened by the victory of Commodore
Dewey at Manila, and those who had previously discouraged the idea
that We would need a coaling station in the Pacific Ocean are now
firmly convinced that Hawaii would be of inestimable value to the
United States at the present moment.
AM the old arguments in favor of annexation have been revived,
and to them has been added the new conditions which have arisen
since last Sunday.
In spite of the force and persistency with which the question of
annexation has been urged, it? most earnest and confident advocates
are forced to confess that there is a sentiment against it in the Senate
of sufficient strength and determination to prevent any action in that
direction.
This condition of affairs has been fully explained to the Presi
dent, and it is hardly probable that any further agitation of the ques
tion will be had until the opposition in the Senate experiences a radical
change of heart.

INDIANAPOLIS. May 3.â This after
:-â .*;â¢ noon at Camp Mount, where 5000 Indi
' â¢ ana volunteers are assembled, General
; Harrison made his first public utter
. â¢ anee on the war in presenting a flag to
Battery A, on behalf of society ladies.
After complimenting the officers and
men of the battery upon their efficiency
in drill General Harrison said:
You have, as a trained and organized
militia, a great advantage over me vol
unteers of 1861-62. Our foes now are not,
thank God, those of our own household.
That was a war for the life of the Un
ion, this a war for humanity. That for
: ourselves; this for the oppressed of an
other race. We could not escape this
â¢â¢; conflict. Spanish rule had become ef
; fete. We dare not say that we have
God's commission to deliver the oppressed
: the world around. To the distant Ar
menians we could send only the succor
â¢ of a faith that overcomes death and the
â  alleviations which the nurse and the com
unissary can give.
But the oppressed Cubans and their
: starving women and children are knock
ing at our doors; their cries penetrate our
slumbers. They are closely within what .
: â¢we have defined to be the sphere of Amer
ican influence. We have said, "To us,
i not to Europe." and we cannot shrink
the responsibility and the dangers of this
". old and settled American policy. Wo
have, as a nation, toward Cuba tne same
â¢ high commission which every brave
: hearted man has to strike down the ruf
â  flan who in his presence beats a woman
or a child and will not desist. For what
If not for this does God make a man or
a nation strong?
We have disclaimed in the face of the
nations of Europe who are now dividing
continents much as hungry boys might
divide a melon that ,we have no purpose
to seize and appropriate Cuba. We go to
Bel her free, to give to her own people |
that which we have claimed and estab- i
lished for ourselves â the right to set up j
and maintain a Government suitable to !
.their own necessities, controlled by their
own suffrages. We covet from her, as ;
from all the nations of America, only the j
offices of good neighbors and the fair i
and natural exchanges of commerce. We j
. do not deny dominion in Europe in
order to seize it for ourselves. But we j
may justly, 1 think, in the West Indies
and in the Far Eastern sea, where our |
gallant navy has won bo splendid a vic
tory, hold some little unpeopled harbors
where our cruising warships may coal and
find a refuge when in stress.
I do not doubt that â though no
man can set the times which God plansâ
this great work to which the United States
has addressed itself will be completely
and permanently accomplished. I , con- j
gratulate you. my young friends, that |
you. are to have a part in it. I challenge i
your interest and your duty, that you ac- |
ouit yourselves like men; that you enter

BLANCO FACES
OPEN REVOLT
Exhausting His Resources
to Prevent Riots at
Havana.
Revives His Soldiers' Courage
by Issuing Bombastic
Proclamations.

KEY WEST, May 3.â General Blanco
is beginning to feel the desperation of
his position. I.olatcd from and prac
tically abandoned by Spain, he is con
centrating such resources as he has in
Cuba for at least one desperate battle
before he hauls down th. yellow em
blem of Castile.
He is beginning to feel the pressure
within his own lines and the week may
not end without his ! eing compelled to
use his soldiers to put down riots in
Havana. â !;;*:
The citizens of Havana are tiring of
the blockade. Blanco has kindled their
martial spirit with sonorous proclama
tions, but stomachs cannot be satisfied
with words.
Captain Fernandez of the schooner
Antonio y Poca, which was captured
off Havana yesterday by the gunboats
Newport and Casting, brings the latest
reports of the condition of the popula
tion, which has become dissatisfied to
the verge of open revolt. Every day
crowds of hungry women and children
besiege the palace and demand to be
fed. As Blanco rides through the streets
with his staff and guard he is assailed
with violent importunities, not unmixed
with imprecations.
So far the soldiers have not felt the
pinch of the blockade, but. in quarters
of the city where are huddled the poor
want already stalksâ a grim but fa
miliar spectre. The first enthusiasm of
the war is subsiding, and in its place
are complaint and insistent demand.
These men have already formally pro
tested to Captain-General Blanco
against certain regulations. The feel
ing that Spain has abandoned her chil
dren to their ."ate has taken deep root
among the military, checkmg the ef
fervescence of the volunteers. The peo
pie are : beginning to realize that there
is little ~ +iope of the blockade being
. raised 'â > by the Spanish fleet, and that
reinforcements cannot be successfully
transported from Spain. fleet, and that

I have information from a reliable

GREAT BATTLE
IS IMPENDING
Spain's Atlantic Fleet Yet
to Be Met and Con
quered.
Little Doubt That It Will Be
Sent to Cuba on a For
lorn Hope.
Probably the Last Combat of the War
Likely to Be Fought NetÂ»r
Havana.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, RigÃs House,
Washington, May 3.
The President believes that Dewey*a
magnificent victory over the Spanish
Reel at Manila is the beginning of the
end. Spain \vill not yield promptly nor
with pood grace, but the administration
is confident she will yield within a com
paratively short time. She is bank
rupt, and no matter how enthusiastic
the Spanish masses may bo they are
p..or. and even a forced loan could
wring only a few million pesatas from
the scanty hoards of impoverished
peasants and artisans.
The United States has spent $50,000.
000 in thirty days, and will spend as
much more within the next two months
whether the war comes promptly to an
end or not. What then can Spain do
with an empty treasury, her foreign
credit gone and a score of angry Bhy
locks demanding the return of loans
r,,\\ overdue and leaguing with the
money kings of Europe to prevent the
purchase of a single Spanish bond, no
matter what rate of interest is offered.
But although the President and his
advisers think the war cloud is now
lifted, they are not over sanguine, and
do not underrate their foe. Another
naval battle in all probability must be
fought, in which ships more numerous
and more powerful than the contending
squadrons at Manila will be engaged on
both sides.
The cable advices that Spain is has
tily fitting out other ships at Cadiz
are borne out by iater messages, and
the most experienced naval officers
predict that the closing battle of the
war will soon be fought in Cuban
waters. The concentrated Spanish
ships of the Cape Verde squadron, the
Cadiz fleet and such auxiliary cruisers
as can be pressed into service, it is pre
dicted, will cross the Atlantic to make
one desperate effort to relieve Havana
and to preserve to the Spanish crown
the Pearl of the Antilles. In no other
way, it is argued, can Spain hope to
strike a decisive blow, and unless such
a blow is struck the end can only be a
question of time.
Under instructions from Washington
Admiral Sampson has held his fleet in
tact to meet the Spanish squadrons.
Should it be made clear that they do
not intend to cross the ocean the signal
will be given for the seizure of Porto
Rico and the bombardment of Havana.
The subtle but no less powerful in
fluence of the powers is already being
brought to bear upon the Queen to
yield without further waste of money
and lives, and if Spain surrenders with
out another blow our victory will be
due as much to European diplomacy as
to the skill and courage of our mili
tary forces.
The State of Texas lies at Key West
loaded with food supplies intended for
the reconcentrados. It is useless t.>
forward the supplies until they can be
landed in Cuba under the protection of
American guns, and even their distri
bution must follow in the wake of the
army's advance.
The Spaniards, with an opportunity,
would seize and appropriate them to
their own ttÂ«e, for they would not hesi
tate to intercept a charity intended for
people whom they have already re
duced to beggary and starvation. T'n
der these circumstances it is natural
that naval officers should feel the ut
most impatience to learn of the where
abouts and plans of the Spanish fleets
Sampson cannot divide his force t<, <]â  -
fend a base, of supplies and fight the
strongest squadron Spain can send
Definite news is looked for at almost
any hour that will disclose the Spanish
programme and enable Sampson re
inforced by Sehley and the flying
squadron, either to sail to meet the
Spanish fleet or to drive Blanco and his
forces from Cuban Boil.
The navy makes little choice be
tween these two contingencies. Action
is all it asks, and action is promised
shortly.
The Navy Department is not sur
prised that no official intelligence has
been received from Commodore Dewey.
It is assumed that the Manila cable
waa cut before he occupied the city, if
indeed he has done so, and that h*
would not havedetaohed the smallest Of
his vessels until convinced that h.^
could Spare her gains. Hence his dis
patches probably did not leave Manila
until Sunday night or Monday morn
ins? and are not due here until some
time to-morrow.
In the meantime the belief is general
that the stars and stripes have replaced
the Spanish ensign on the Mag- staff of
Manila's broad citadel.

HEAVY FIRING
OFF CAPE RACE
Cannonading Heard in
the Bay South of
Trepassey.
Combat Waged on Saturday
and Again on Sunday
Morning.
Belief That a Battle Has Been Fought
Off the Newfoundland
Coast.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. JOHNS, N. F., May 3.â Heavf
firing is reported to have been heard
in the bay south of Trepassey before
daybreak Sunday. This was distinct
from the cannonading heard off Cape
Race Saturday night.
The telegraph operator at Trepassey j
reports concerning the mysterious can- j
nonading off that port Saturday night j
as follows: About 10 o'clock Saturday j
night heavy firing could be distinctly j
heard in the bay south of Trepassey, j
lasting about fifteen minutes. The j
shots came very quickly after each !
other, some being very loud and heavy, j
sufficient to cause the houses here to j
tremble. Others were short and sharp, I
as if from lighter pieces.
Another cannonading was heard be- |
fore daybreak on Sunday. This lasted :
about twenty minutes. Crowds of peo- j
pie. aroused by the first reports,
flocked to the water's edge. The first j
impression VU that some steamer In â¢
distress in the bay was firing rockets,
but the discharges were too heavy and
too rapid fur that. Then it was agreed '
that perhaps there was a naval battle '
in progress.
About 4 o'clock Saturday afternoon
a number of Trepassey people saw a
large steamer in the offiing. They be- j
lleve it was a warship. It was two- \
masted, with two funnels and high in i
the middle. It was about eight miles
off shore, going dead slow and bound
west. For nearly an hour it was in i
sight.
In Saturday night's cannonading ,
from fifty to sixty shots were fired. \
The telegraph operator at Cape Race, j
which is fifteen miles oast of Trepassey.
confirms the report of the Trepassey
operator as to the firing of guns be- !
tween 10 and 11 o'clock Saturday night. I
He asserts that the firing was heard by !
both himself and his brother. The ;
weather was not foggy at the time, but
only hazy; and there was consequently
no reason for the firing because of dan
ger on that score. The operator said ;
the firing lasted about ten minutes,
and that the shots were different from
and too heavy for explosive rockets.
No wreckage could have drifted
ashore since then, because the wind
has been off the island, and no steam
ers are due from Sydney or Halifax be
fore to-morrow night, which would be \
likely to sight either of the combatants, i
if the firing was a battle.
THIRD TRIAL OF THE
PARKER WILL CONTEST.
Day Spent in the Selection of Five
of the Twelve Jurors to Try
the Case.
SAN JOSE. May B.â The third trial of
the contest of the will of the late George
H. Parker l>y Kmma T.. Parker, a daugh- \
ter-in-law, commenced to-day in Judge
Hyland's court.
The Parker estate is worth about $300,- !
000. At the death of Parker in 1893 he â 
gave to his only son, Edward L. Parker, j
a life interest in the estate, after which
the. property was to be distributed among
nieces and nephews. No provision was
made for his son's family. Edward L. :
Parker died within a year after his
father. Tlis widow, Emma I>. Parker, at '
once begun a contest of her father-in- !
law's will, the grounds being unsoujidness
of mind and the use of undue influence
by testator's sister.
"The first trial of the contest resulted
In a disagreement, and the second in a :
victory for contestant, the jury standing
9 to 3. The executors of Parker's will ap- i
plied for and were granted a new trial
on the ground that errors had been com
mitted during: the proceedings.
\n unusual array of legal talent is en- |
gaged in the trial. Mrs. Parker, the con
testant, is represented by Charles W.
Slack. Rodgers & Paterson and T. C.
Coogan of San Francisco and Nicholas
Bowden of this city. For the proponents
there are D. M. Delmas, D. W. Burchard,
E. A. Wilcox, R. R. Syer and J. R. Pat- i
ton.
The day was occupied In selecting five
of the jurors to try the case.
ACCIDENTAL EXPLOSION.
CORONER WILL DECIDE.,
EiTort? to Trace the Santa Crus Di -
Pester to Spanish Spies H>vi> So
Far Failed.
SANTA CRUa,May 3â Coroner Clark
saya that every clew leading toward the
suspicion that a Spaniard caused the
explosion at the powder works has been
followed, but nothing tangible has yet
been found. If spies did it he thinks
they are among the men killed. In that
case the truth will never be learned,
unless confederates make a confession.
In the absence of positive evidence the
verdict of the Coroner's jury will be
that the explosion was caused by acci
dent. The inquest will last two days.
The output at the powder works is
now 5000 pounds of smokeless and 12,000
pounds of brown powder daily. Tho
only delay will be in the manufacture
of infantry smokeless powder, but there
is enough on hand to furnish 60,000 men
for three months. This powder was
manufactured In the destroyed mills.
The powder used at Manila was made
at the works here and was shipped to
Hongkong nine weeks ago.
A guard of thirty men is now at the
mills. Every employe must have a
password, the same as though under
military rule, before gaining entrance.
About sixty men are now employed in
rebuilding the destroyed plant, which
will )>*â  in operation in three weeks.
None but skilled labor is employed. An
average of sixty men apply for work
daily.
THOMPSONS RESIGNATION
WILL BE DEMANDED.
SAN DIEGO, May 3.â lt is probable
that County Treasurer J. W. Thomp
son will tender his resignation to-mor
row. Should he not do so his bonds
men express determination to take
steps to oust him from office. Recent
ly, en an examination being made of
the bonds of various county officials, it
was found that the sureties on $40,000
of the $100,000 bond furnished by
Treasurer Thompson were unsatisfac
tory. He was requested to furnish new
sureties to the extent of $40,000. The
other bondsmen then placed J. D. Rush
in the Treasurer's office as deputy and
a partial examination was made. The
principal bondsmen now threaten to
withdraw, and rather than attempt to
obtain new sureties Thompson will give I
up the office. J

FOR BONDS
Appears Before the Sen
ate Committee of
Finance.
Information as to the Cost of
War Submitted by the
Secretary.
No Certainty as to When the Work
on the Kevenue Bill Will
Be Concluded.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
;;V; Washington, May 3.
The Senate Committee on Finance re
sumed its sitting at 10:30 a. m. to-day,
hearing Secretary Gage on the neces
sity for including in the war revenue
bill authority for the issuance of bonds.
The Secretary supplied the committee
all the information in his possession as
to the cost of the war up to date, and
also the best estimates obtainable of
future expenses.
Secretary Gage told the committee
that the best estimates obtainable in
dicate that for the next two months the
war will increase the Governmental ex
penditure about $50,000,000. By that
time the entire amount in the treasury,
with the exception of the gold reserve,
will be exhausted and $30,000,000 of the
l fscr\ c also taken.
Mr. Gage also stated it to be his
opinion that the revenue would de
crease on account of the war. In
view of these facts he considered an
authorization for the issue of bonds
necessary. He said no estimate had been
made of the cost (if war for a year
hence, as no one could say how iong it
would continue.
Secretary Gage told the committee
that he had not been furnished any ac
curate estimates of the cost of the war
by the War and Navy departments and
the committee then decided to summon
the heads of those two departments for
the purpose of getting their ideas.
Secretary Alger told the Finance
Committee that he thought $150,000,000
would be sufficient for the extraordi
nary expenses of the War Department
for the next year, occasioned by the
Spanish war.
Secretary Long said he had not the
data upon which to furnish the com
mittee with estimate for his depart
ment, but that he would sent a com
munication covering the points.
When the committee adjourned to
night there was no certainty when the
work on the war revenue bill would be
concluded. The Democrats had not
offered any other proposition and the
bond provision had not been taken up
with a view of disposing of it. The
only two points of importance which
are regarded as settled are that the
tonnage tax will go out and that the
tobacco tax provision will be so modi
fied as to exempt stock on hand.
THE SCOUT BOATS
TAKE TWO PRIZES.
St. Louis and Harvard Pass the
Bahamas With Two Spanish
Steamers in Their Wake.

NASSAU, Bahama Islands, May 3.â
Two steamers, whose names could not
be made out, but from all appearances
Spanish vessels, in company of two
supposed United States men-of-war,
passed on the south side of this island
to-day. They apparently were steering
for the tongue of the ocean on their
way to Cuban waters.
It is believed here that the men-of
war were the St. Louis and Harvard,
which sailed from New York on last
Saturday, on scout duty in Porto Rican
waters.
The British steamer Ironapolis ar
rived here this morning from Havana,
having been stopped by the United
States blockading fleet. She is from
Cardiff with a cargo of 3000 tons of coal
and comes here for orders. The British
cruiser Pearl arrived early this morn
ing from Jamaica.

Philippine Insurgents Are
at the Gates of
Manila.
Pillage and Massacre Follow
the Capture of Several
Villages.
â¢
Mail Advices Report Frequent
Clashes Between Spaniards
and Natives.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, May 3.â Manila advices to
April 6, received to-day via Hongkonp,
state the Philippine insurgents were
then crowding around Manila, gradu
ally working their way into the sub
urbs. They had just manufactured
gome cannon, with which thew were
causing town after town to surrender.
Thesp cannon were made of boiler tubes
bound tight with telegraph wire se
cured from demolished land lines be
tween Manila and the cable station at
Bolinao. Miles of telegraph wire were
carried off to make cannon, which the
nativps call lantaccos.
Subsequent to March 15 the railroad
running out of Manila was thrice torn
up to prevent the transportation of
Spanish troops.
Invariably these raids were followed
by the destruction of neighboring vil- i
| lage?. The plan generally pursued was
to mount a battery of their improvised
cannon on a hill overlooking a village,
compelling its surrender.
The insurgents have been animated
by one desireâ to pillage and destroy In
order to induce the peaceably inclined
native classes to share in their desper
ate endeavor to overthrow Spanish
domination. With this object they have
overrun the provinces of Nueva Excija,
Bulacan, Tarlac and Pangasinan.
j Wherever they have appeared ruin and
I rapine has been recorded, while villa
ges were burned and rice crops de
stroyed. The former insurgent leaders
were men of high intelligence, while the
I present leaders are brutal and destruct
i ive, some wanting to be bought off as
were General Aguinaldo and his asso
ciates in January.
The insurgents have become so
strong that the loyalty of native Span
ish troops in the islands was consid
ered doubtful two months ago, and late
in March volunteers were disarmed.
j Desertions from the two remaining na
j tive regiments continued to be numer
| ous, the deserters being welcomed by
| the rebels because they brought arms
I and ammunition.
Spanish General Monet and 1000 sol
diers arrived at Bolinao in March to
protect the cable station there. En
route from Lingayen they had five en
counters with the insurgents, both
sides suffering losses. The garrisons
and the priests of seven neighboring
villages had been killed, only six sol
diers escaping. The garrison at Bolinao
was spared only because the English
cable staff resided there. Some of the
other villages were surrendered on
condition that the garrisons, after lay
ing down their arms, should be allowed
to go to the nearest friendly villages.
The insurgents failed to keep their
promises and soldiers were killed as
soon as disarmed.
General Monet left 500 soldiers at
Bolinao and returned to Manila with
the other 500 by cruiser. The rebels en
deavored on March 11 to seize the
Bolinao cable station, but were driven
back. They were preparing: for an
other attack when a Spanish gunboat
arrived and landed a company of ma
rines. Heavy firing continued between
the station and the rebel camp, many
rebels and one soldier being killed.
On March 13 a British gunboat ar
rived and the rebels retired. The
Spanish were thus undoubtedly in pos
session of the cable station when the
battle of Manila was fought last Sun
day.

IN THE NAME OF JUSTICE.
THE country feels a thrill of jubilant pride at the
achievements of Commodore Dewey. Never
was there dash more impressive, never has a
joldier of the sea gone more bravely into a situation
which meant victory or death. As he approached the
hostile fleet off Manilla, as he forced a way in the
darkness, he could not know but the channel he
threaded was thick with torpedoes. He did not know
the strength of the forts on either side. He was tak
ing his chances, the stern chances of war.
The people of the United States do not rejoice in
carnage. They do not approve of the thunder of the
tannon when every reverberation means that death
has been hurled. In the abstract they detest the
ihedding of blood. But the pulses thrill in contem
plation of the achievement of Dewey. There is in the
Dreast of every American a feeling of pride that our
â¢hips and our men have proved themselves fit to be
long to the navy of a great nation, able to hold up its
tolors, able to defend its citizenship.
But over all the pride there rises the belief that
(ustice has been done, the stern justice which de
nands an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. No
leed to recite the story of the Maine. It is familiar
rherever the English tongue is spoken. But the
Maine has been avenged. No matter what necessity
â¢f diplomacy caused Dewey to sink the fleet of Spain,
vhen the news reached this country the thought
lashed through every mind that a fit punishment had
teen meted out to an assassin. Had it not been for
he overt act which sent a friendly ship to the bot
om of the harbor of Havana the people of this coun
ry could never have looked on a war with Spain as
ustifiable. Now they are glad to see that power
trushed. It invited ruin when it provoked them to
vrath, and in the moment of extremity there is no
Â»ity for it. Deep in the heart of humanity there is
imbedded a respect for the old Mosaic law.
But it is not to be dreamed by the Castilian that
laving aroused the spirit of a mighty vengeance it is
o be lulled by this one blow, fie did not merely

The doom of Spain is written. There is no salvation
or that monarchy of half-forgotten glory. The valor
if the great new world is armed to banish the hateful
eign of a half-barbaric race. Before the demand of
u=;tiee shall be surely satisfied the stars and stripes
rill be floating above every possession on this hem-
Bphere which Spain now claims. As the Philip
pines have gone from her. so will Oba go. As to
he future of the islands wrested from her grasp there
t no need to conjecture. America does not know
ror care. She glories in the fact that Spanish power
* melting before her wrath, and looks forward to
he near time when the haughty Don shall on bended
mcc beg for the mercy he does not deserve. There
re other Deweys in the navy, and back of them is the
pptiment of millions of people who despise Spain for
rr shameful history, her violence, her treachery and
or sneers.
Possibly Mr. McKinley may survive the fact that
he Supervisors did not indorse his war policy. In
Oe first place it aas none of their business to do so.
nd in the second place it was not of the slightest
onsequence whether they feel an inclination to mo
rse it or not.

'IV,
NO TIME FOR SCHEMES.
IT is nearly 3000 miles from Honolulu to Manila,
yet the Hawaiian annexationists are saying that
Honolulu would have been a valuable base of oper
ations for Dewe,y. If a coaling station 2000 miles
from our coast and 3000 miles from the scene of our
great naval victory is of any use, we have it already
in Pearl Harbor. That station is ours to occupy, for
tify and use to any advantage it may be to us without
taking upon us the civil embarrassments that will at
tend annexation.
It will be remembered that heretofore all argu
ments in favor of annexation from a military view
have been addressed to the defensive idea, that they
were needed for defense of this coast. The fact is that
any man-of-war coaling at Honolulu and steaming
under forced draught for this coast is out of coal when
she gets within striking distance, and would be about
as valuable as a fighting machine as a floating water
melon. Spain has islands and coaling stations every
where, and what good are they doing her in her
emergency? Every one is a weakness. If she sat
upon her peninsula she would be unconquerable, as
she has always been at home. She has islands and
naval stations, and we, without any, are blowing her
out of water.
Instead of this war demonstrating our need of
extracontinental possessions it proves that the na
tion which has them is at the mercy of one that has
them not.
This is no time to work schemes. The island poli
ticians will improve it, of course, but the American
people are not under any glamour that shuts their
eyes to the clear facts. The speculative yellow press
has tried to use the war feeling to validate Cuban
bonds, which has been the price of its abuse of their
own Government. They failed, and the island
schemers will fail also.
During the quiet which ensued upon the defeat of
the treaty over 2000 Japanese coolies have been intro
duced into the islands as contract laborers, although
the Legislature pretended an intention to repeal the
contract labor law.
It may as well be understood that the American
people are for this war and will fight it to the end
with Spain and all the allies she can get on land and
6ea. But they don't intend to permit speculators to
use their patriotic feeling to cover such deals as the
annexation of Hawaii. There is no more reason now
for such action than there was last December, when
the defeated treaty was introduced.
Oligarch Dole professes fear that Spain will come
and take him in, when everybody knows that Spain
couldn't take in anything, and that he, being a neu
tral, would be safe if the world were at war. His
Legislature is inquisitive about the sumptuous items
in his bill of expenses paid during his recent junket
to Washington, and it is convenient for him to get
nfraid of Spain to turn attention away from his cash
accounts. Spain can't hold what she has, and Mr.
Dole estimates the intelligence of his own people and
ours at a low plane if he think 3 such black-mammy
nonsense will scare anybody.
SUPPLIES FOR THE SCHOOLS.
DISCLOSURES made by the Grand Jury in
the investigation of the supplies of lumber
purchased for the schools of the city clearly
demonstrate the need of providing a better system
for purchasing all such supplies. Whether evidence
sufficient in the eye of the law to convict the guilty
parties in past frauds should be obtained or not,
steps should be taken to prevent any more of like na
ture in the future.
It appears from testimony given in the course of
the investigation that no effective check exists at the
present time upon the purchase of lumber and
shingles for the schools. Nor is there any check
upon the amount of hauling to and fro of lumber
from one school to another whenever it is desired to
give a job to the teams of any friend of those in
authority. Lumber bought and hauled for one
school building may be hauled to another and then
hauled back again whenever it suits the convenience
of the authorities to do so.
The very fact that despite the disclosure of abun
dant evidence of frauds in the lumber deals that have
been investigated there is still a widespread belief that
no one will be punished is itself a proof of the im
portance" of a radical change from the present sys
tem. When thousands of feet of lumber and hun
dreds of bundles of shingles are charged to the city
and paid for which were never received by the city
it is certainly time to devise and enforce a new way
of doing business in the School Department.
The system of providing supplies for the Fire De
partment serves as an excellent model on which to
rearrange the school system. There should be pro
vided a general storehouse or corporation yard for
the school supplies, at which should be kept all that
the school buildings are likely to require in the way
of repairs. From this yard supplies should be issued
only on the order of the proper authorities, and
these orders should be kept as a record of every
transaction of the kind. In that way it would be
possible to determine with certainty who was re
sponsible for each bill of supplies sent out. and also
where the supplies went and who received them.
It is the duty of the Board of Education to give at
tention to this needed reform at once, and if it fails
to do so the Grand Jury sho/ild take the matter up.
Let us by all means probe the frauds of the past to
the bottom and procure evidence to convict the
guilty parties who committed them, but let us also
guard the future by providing a system of checks on
the purchase of scljpol supplies, so that such frauds
cannot be committed again. The punishment of of
fenders is always good, but the prevention of of
fenses is better.
ANARCHY IN SPAIN.
A SPIRIT of distrust and unrest, verging on rev
olution and tending to anarchy, has now be
come so clearly manifest among the Spanish
people that it constitutes a menace to the kingdom
even more formidable than that of war. American
victory will do no more than overthrow Spanish sov
ereignty in this hemisphere, and possibly deprive
Spain of the colonies she possesses in other parts of
the world, but the threatened outbreak of the over
taxed and long-suffering people may mean the utter
collapse of all the forms of her government, leaving
behind not even as much of the monarchical struc
ture as survived in France when the Bourbons were
driven from Versailles and Robespierre ruled by vir
tue of the guillotine.
The testimony on which the belief in the growing
revolutionary spirit in Spain rests is not derived to
any great extent from American sources. It comes
from Europe, and much of it directly from Spain. It
is known that the Government has been compelled
very frequently of late to call out troops to keep or
der in the capital itself. The recent address of thou-
sands of Spaniards to Castelar nominally congratulat
ing him on his recovery from illness, but virtually
urging him to proclaim a republic, is a striking
THE SA^ FRAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 4, 1898.
evidence of the extent to which popub- dissatisfac
tion with the present regime has gone and the will
ingness with which the people would rise in any well
directed effort at its overthrow.
There is every reason to believe the Spanish Gov
ernment deliberately involved the country in war
with the United States for the purpose of preventing
an insurrection at home. With the Carlists planning
for revolt on one side and the republicans on the
other, while anarchists are plotting everywhere and
ready to strike as they did at Barcelona or in the
assassination of Canovas, the Ministers of the Queen
decided that a foreign war, however disastrous, could
not be as bad as the threatened civil uprising, and
therefore they held on their way in Cuba, though
they knew the war was hopeless, that it was bringing
the nation to bankruptcy and would involve conflict
with the United States.
Governments that go to war for the purpose of quiet
ing domestic disturbances do not always succeed. Na
poleon 111 found to his cost that a war with Germany
profited him nothing. The Spanish Government of
the boy King may have the same experience. The
throne of Spain is tottering to its fall. Free Cufta
may mean free Spain as well, though a iierce civil
war will have to burn out many a foul chimney of
ancient institutions before Spanish freedom will
mean all that it ought to for her people. It is to that
war Spain is evidently tending. Revolution and an
archy are before her, but beyond them may lie a new
Spain with a freer people and a destiny even more
glorious than that of the past when Gonsalvo de Cor
dova led her armies and Cervantes inspired her litera
ture.
MAKING A CAMPAIGN ISSUE.
ACCORDING to reports from Washington the
war revenue bill adopted by the House last
week will be but a short time in the hands of
the Finance Committee of the Senate before it is re
ported to that body. It is believed the committee
will act so promptly that the bill may be reported as
early as Wednesday. At that point, however, prompt
ness of action will cease and the usual slow Senatorial
methods will begin.
The expectation of delay in the passageof the meas
ure is due to the fact that the Democrats will vigor
ously oppose the adoption of the bill as it now
stands. The first efforts of the opposition will be
made in the committee, but it is not believed these
will be sufficient to postpone the report for any great
length of time. This will cause the whole force of
the opposition to show itself in open debates in the
Senate, and will therefore have the effect of more
clearly outlining the issues on which the Democrats
and the Populists intend to make their campaign this
fall.
The tactics adopted in this line of conduct by the
opposition are not surprising. In fact, hardly any
other course is open for any party or faction that in-
tends to oppose the administration and its supporters
in the coming campaign. The silver question is
clearly an out-of-date programme. It would be im
possible to muster anything like an opposition to the
administration on the direct issue of the war. Noth
ing is left for the opponents of Republicanism, there
fore, but the one policy they have adopted â that of
making a fight on the war revenue bill.
The fight on the bill in the Senate will follow the
lines laid down by the opposition leaders in the
House. The main attack will be upon the bond feat
ure of the measure, though some effort will be made
to alter the schedules of taxes. The debate in the
House was so short that comparatively little time
was given to the opposition to formulate their policy,
but in the Senate they will have time enough, and as
a consequence we may expect to learn from the dis
cussion there the issues that will be made the points
of contention between the parties in the campaign
before the people.
The Call has already pointed out that the Republi
can party can easily defend the proposed bond issue
from any attack that may be made upon it. When
the Democrats of the Senate have formulated their
policy of war taxation it will be time to consider the
question more fully. That they will strive hard to
make a platform on which the candidates of their
party can make a fight with at least a prospect of
success is a matter of course, and the coming debate
in the Senate therefore is likely to prove one of the
most interesting of recent years. It will make poli
tics and possibly may make history.
BLIND DISCIPLES OF CONTENTION.
EVER since the first indication of hostilities there
has been an effort to show that the question of
religion had entered into the situation and de
tracted from the unanimity of American citizenship.
That the effort had no basis in reason, that it was
a blind and bigoted attempt to stir up needless strife,
has been amply demonstrated. Protestant and Cath
olic stand together under the flag, and to each of them
it is equally dear. No soldier in the ranks cares what
may be the beliefs of the soldier who marches by his
side. No general about to make a charge pauses to
ask what church may be attended by the men of his
command. Wherever in battle the stars and stripes
have waved, beneath their shadow the Catholic and
the Protestant have fought and died as brothers.
The minister leaves his pulpit to go to the front, the
priest leaves his parish. The same feeling of patriot
ism and charity actuates both.
A dispatch coming by way of London states that
90 per cent of the Catholics of Ireland are favorable
to Spain in the present struggle. Even if correct, the
information may be devoid of significance. There are
people in Germany, in Austria, in France and in Rus
sia who are against us. Why put the opposition on
religious grounds as to Ireland alone? And the peo
ple in Ireland may not be well informed as to the
merits of the case. It is quite possible they take their
stand on the principle of believing England wrong
always. The opinion of the Catholics in Ireland or
of the Protestants there is of no consequence. If
they were in this country they would fight for the
country. The men who handle our guns are of va
rious creeds, and that they are does not weaken the
arm of the republic. In the matter of citizenship, as
to love for the flag, they stand on common ground,
and the honor of our arms by land and sea is safe in
their hands.
Judge Campbell has sent another wife-beater to
jail for six months. Perhaps there has been at times
some occasion for finding fault with the Judge, and
the public generally has referred lightly to his
whiskers, but when he gets the low-browed wife
beater before him he does much to cover up any
qualities which might be regarded as shortcomings.
While the Spanish insist on calling the Yankees
pigs, it is to be noticed that the Spanish themselves
are doing the squealing.
Spanish announcement that the war is to be fought
to the bitter end does not indicate likelihood of a
long struggle.
GENERAL GRANT'S ELDEST GRANDSON,
ALGERNON EDWARD SARTORTS. the eldest child of Mrs. Nellie Grant
Sartoris and the eldest grandson of General Ulysses S. Grant, was born
In Washington, D. C, twenty-one years ago. He was in his second year
in the Columbia Law School in New York. But as soon as war was ex
pected he wrote to General Fitzhugh Lee asking an appointment on his staff, and
immediately received the reply, "If I am in the saddle this time you shall ride
with me." Mr. Sartoris is now in Washington, so as not to lose a moment's
time when General Lee receives his commission. He has received no military
education, but has a taste for arms, and has been an assiduous student of the
campaigns of his grandfather and of Napoleon.

A SONG FOR CUBA.
The nations of Europe, all girded in greed.
Behold thee. O Cuba! and heed not thy cries;
Had they hearts thou hadst long since been
happily freed;
Thou hadst liberty long since If they had but
eyes.
They call themselves Christians, yet prey on
the weak;
They fawn on the Turk and they tolerate
Spain;
They worship the strong, and they scoff at the
meek,
They are worÂ«e than the vultures that feÂ«d
on the slain.
But Cuba, the dawn of thy freedom Is near;
Already its sunburst Is seen in the east;
The heart of thy tyrant is quaking with fear,
And the vulture in terror forsakes his grim
feast.
The eagles of war are abroad In their might;
The rush of their wings drowns the roar of
the seas:
They are seeking thy foe; he will soon b* in
flight.
For the Star-Spangled Banner is flung to the
breeze.
We have kindled our crucibles white with the
steel
That shall free thee; our forges are red as
thy wrongs ;
They are shaping new weapons of war for thy
weal,
Whilst, for thee, our great furnaces sing
PYf-edom's songs.
O! Thank God! for the manhood that speaks
in this hour;
For the hearts that respond to thy pitiful
story ;
For the spirit, O Cuba! that fears not the
pow'r
Of thy foe; and thank God for our banner.
Old Glory!
âJohn E. Barrett in Scranton Truth.
SWIFTWATER BILL, OUTDONE.
"James Daughtry, best known to fame
as 'Nigger Jim,' is spending hia Klondike
coin with a lavish hand, as if he had
the money of the Rothschilds," said G.
R. Mayfleld of Seattle to a Washington
Post reporter.
"He has been leaving a carmine streak
in our town during the past fortnight,
and saloon-keepers, night liners and other
folks who cater to the hilarious think
he is the only real good thing that has
hit the place in many moons. Yet there
was a time, and not so very long ago,
when 'Nigger Jim' was not ordering up
quart bottles with the redundancy that
now characterizes his game. He was a
very dejected and impecunious individual
when, after working at Circle City for
some months without striking pay' dirt
he started for the Klondike late in the
winter 'of 1896-97, and with a debt of
$3000 resting upon him.. But fortune
smiled on him soon after his arrival in
Dawson.
"An old friend, one of the richest men in
camp, gave him a chance to get in on
the ground floor, and pretty quickly
Daughtry had a half interest in one of
the best claims on Bonanza. After less
than a year's residence at Dawson he
pulled out with a fortune estimated in
the neighborhood of $300,000. Lately he
was cabled an offer of $100,000 by an Eng
lish syndicate for four of his "claims on
Bonanza Creek, and it was this latest
boost of fortune that led him to Â«Â»et a '
pace in Seattle a little more rapid than '
ever Swiftwater Bill attained. 'Nigger I
Jim" Isn't any sort of an African, but he
got the name by his penchant for singing
all the latest coon songs."
BYRON ON SPAIN.
Here all were noble save nobility.
None hugged a conqueror's chain save fallen
chivalry.
Such be the sons of Spain, and stranir* the
fateâ
They fight for freedom who were never free!
A kingless people for a nerveless state.
Her vassals combat when their chieftians flee.
True to the veriest slave of treachery.
Fond of a land which gave them naught but
life.
Pride -joints a path that leads to liberty.
Back to the struggle, baffled in the strife,
War, war is still the cryâ even to the
knife!
Te who would more of Spain and Spaniards
know,
Go read whate'er Is writ of bloodiest strife.
Whate'er keen vengeance urged on foreigh foe
Can act 1b acting there against man's life.
From flashing srlmiter to secret knife.
War moldeth there each weapon to his need
So he may guard the sister and the wife.
So may he make each curst oppressor bleed.
So may such foes deserve the moat remorse
less deed!
Flows there a tear of pity for the dead?
Look o'er the ravage of the reeking plain;
Look on the hands with female slaughter red.
Then to the dogs resign the unburled slain;
Then to the vulture let each corse remain.
Albeit unworthy of the prey bird's maw,
Let their blearh'd bones and blood's un
bleaching stain
Long mark the battlefield with hideous awe.
Thus only may our sons conceive the scenes we
saw. â Childe Harold.

FJSH LADDERSâ J. E. C, Sonora, CM.
A fish ladder, also called a flshway, is an
arrangement for enabling fish to ascend
a fall or a dam. In tho pool flshways the
water falls through small vertical heights,
the velocity being retarded by means or
rocks and boulders or by falling into
pools, whence it is allowed to fall again
through a slight vertical distance to be
again retarded, and so on to the bottom.

Special Officer McPartland .was pass

Furlong he found the fire had spread
with such rapidity that the entire upper
floor was enveloped in flames, and they
were already forcing their way into
Francis, Valentine & Co.'s rooms on the
floor below.
On the Clay-streel side the upper
floors were unoccupied, but there were
many wooden partitions, dry as tinder,
for the tire to feed upon, and although

The Commercial-street side of the

is also stored there. The first floor
tied the presses and paper. The
company employed about thirty-five
men and was working a full force.

fire to a certain extent, .is they had

Frank Eastman & Co., pnnrcrH, were
on the second story of th^ burned
building. Their loss will be great both
from fire and water, and the stock was
probably completely ruined. The dam
age is estimated at $5000.
Paul Brunette, a gunsmith, cutler
and locksmith, occupied the building
adjoining Valentine. He had on Land
a large stock of guns and knives which
were damaged- more or less by .vater.
Considerable ammunition | was stored
in his place and if the fire had not
been kept from spreading to his store
an explosion might have occurred. Next
door to Brunotte is Dunphy Bros., lith
ogrphers. They had* on hand a
great number of lithographs for the
theatrical companies in the city at
present and some which are to come.
This . stock was damaged some by
water, but a great part of It is safe, as
the patrol company spread their blan
kets over the paper a short time after
the streams were turned on the fire.
Captain Comstock of the fire patrol
paid that he was unable to place an
estimate on the loss. The damage to
th printing establishments will amount
to almost an entire loss he thinks. In
his opinion the building will not be
safe, as it has passed through several
fires, and the walls are greatly weak
ened. He placed the total loss on the
building- at $10,000.
On Christmas day, 1893, fire broke out
in the same building, causing a loss of
$250,000. Francis. Valentine & Co. and
The Call being the principal sufferers.
'.': Just three years later. Christmas day,
1896, the building was again partly de
stroyed by "fire-, though it did not gain
such headway as on the previous" occa

fully cover the damage by last night's

OAKLAND. May 3.â Phtllas Henry
Lamoureux. one of the best known men
in town and secretary of the Remillard
Brick Company, committed suicide to
night in a most mysterious manner. lie
sought the darkest spot on Webster
street wharf to end his life, and when he
had reached the edge close to the water
he tired a bullet through his head. The
missile passed clear through the brain, !
and the unfortunate man died just two
hours later at the Receiving Hospital.
Just as the lire bells rang to-night at i
9 o'clock the watchman on Webster-street
wharf heard the report of a pistol. He
had noticed a solitary man walking out
on the wharf, but as the night was fine,
and there was some moonlight, it was not
at all unusual to notice people walking
out on the wharves. The watchman paid
no heed to ; the stranger till lie heard the
shot, and when he went in the direction 1
of the report he found a man lying on ]
his back on the wharf. The police office
was at once told of the fact and the pa
trol wagon took the wounded man to the
Receiving Hospital.
When the watchman found the would
be suicide he was still breathing-, but
totally unconscious and not a word did
he utter, but gradually sank at the hos- j
pital until he breathed his last.
Drs. Porter and Stratton operated on
the skull and tried to stop the hemorrhage
of the brain, but their efforts were of no
use, for. the bullet had ploughed com
pletely through from one temple to the j
other.
At the hospital the wounded man was
at once recognized as P. M. Lamoureux, â¢
who has been in business here many :
years. He was for a long time foreman
of the Remlllard Brick Company, and for
some time has been the secretary. Ho
married into the Kimillard family some
years ago and had three children. The
family has lived for a long time in a
very comfortable home at 9G4 Jefferson
street. Not the slightest reason can be j
advanced for this desire to end his life,
and his relatives and friends are totally !
at a loss to account for his action. He
has never appeared to be morbid and has I
never been known to hint at taking his
life or to express any opinion that could
possibly lead to the supposition â â¢ that he I
was otherwise than perfectly contented '
with his lot.
â¢His home relations are said by his i
nephew, Phil millard. to have been (
most pleasant, and he was In good finan
cial circumstances and moved in the best
social circle*.
Mis. Lamoureux arrived at the hospital
just a minute after her husband had
breathed his last. The effect upon her
was so great that for a time she needed
the attention of the doctors. She per
sisted, however, in seeing the body before
being taken to her desolated home, and
the scene in the hospital was the most
pitiful in years.
"I am totally at a loss to account for
this," said Phil rtemillard to-night.
"There is not so far as we are aware the
slightest reason, for such an act. His
finances are in good shape, everything in
the company is all right and the whole
affair is a profound mystery."
Philias H. I.amoureux had for some
years taken an .active part in Republican
politics and had frequently been elected
a delegate to city and county conventions
from the Sixth Ward. He was a member
of Oakland Oommandery, Knights Vein
plar. of University Lodge of Odd Fellows
and of Live Oak Lodge, P. and A. M. He

THE GERMAN BANK WINS.
Judge Hebbard Renders an Impor
tant Decision Bearing on
Corporate Titles.
Judge Hebbard yesterday rendered a
.imiKment that Is of importance to the
local banks. Some few weeks ago arti
cles of incorporation were filed by the
German-American Bank which was for
merly known as Che California Mortgage
and Savings Bank. The German Savings I
and Loan Society, generally known as the
German Bank, which has been in exist
ence for nearly thirty years, at once com
menced proceedings to enjoin the newly
named corporation from doing business
under the corporate title, claiming that
there was a possibility of its Interests be
ing injured by a confusion of names. A
temporary Injunction wa.s granted pend
ing the proceedings being heard. The !
German-American Bank interposed a de
murrer to the proceedings commenced by
the German Savings and Loan Society
and the matter was argued at length by
counsel representing the contesting cor
porations.
Judge Hebbard. In a lengthy opinion
filed yesterday, overruled the demurrer,
and the temporary injunction still re
mains in force and effect. After citing
from many cases bearing nn the point
involved Judgre Hebbard held that the
new corporation had no right to use the
proposed name. -- .- J

THE PASSION PLAY.
Delightful Afternoon Entertainments ]
at the Baldwin Theater.
One of the most beautiful anl Instruc
tive entertainments ever presented in this
city is the â¢â¢Passion Play," now being
shown at the Baldwin Theater by means
of a series of moving pictures. The ex
cellence of the work is just being realized
and the attendance grows largerwlth each
presentation.
There are forty scenes in all, beginning j
with views of the Horitz and 'he neigh- |
borhood of Oberamnr.ergau. Tnen come I
the scenes In the life of Christ v.-hen upon i
earth. The blessing of the little children, !
the Last Supper, the trial before Pilate,
the crucifixion and the shining glory of
the resurrection are wonderfully por
trayed. Every scene an>l action, every
gesture of those participating in the per
formance at Oberammwrgau. are repro- |
duced in life-like manner, and the interest
never flags for an instant.
Not a little of the success of the enter
tainment is due to the excellence of the
singing contributed by Mrs. John Morri
sey and the lecture given upon different
parts of the play. The play is g'.ven every j
afternoon except Saturday.

Chauneey M. Johnson, for many years

several weeks' duration. Mr. Johnson
was well known in this city, having filled
several positions that brought him before

ice. J_ater on he was called to public

when he undertook to corrupt Johnson,

QUERY FROM THE GALLERY
An Interesting Programme HÂ»s Been
Prepared for To-Day's Consid
eration.
Yesterday was reform clay at the
Woman's Congress. Each annual meet
ing has boasted of some reform to be
promulgated, and Tuesday's meeting nat
urally fell Into line. That old and reliable
stand-by, dress reform, was, for the sake
of other days, given a gentle little tap.
leaving the vigor and the eloquence to be
expended on the latest reformâ that of
the press.
Professor <'. A. Dunlway of Stanford
took charge of the chastisement of news
paper editors, and while he administered
punishment reminded one "forcibly of the
parent, with active slipper, who declares
he suffers more than the receiving of
fender.
In these five successive years of
woman's congress man has risen grad
ually In estimation, until now but little
stands against him in the Judgment of the
ladies. However, his latest offense is his
opposition to dress reform, and speakers
with ttghtly corseted forms ascribed to
dissenting mankind all their lack of com
1 fort ami artistic loveliness. There were
several bursts of patriotic enthusiasm at
the. afternoon session, and when a Daugh
ter of the Revolution explained that the
aim and object of the society was to
instill patriotism and to honor the names
! of those who made this country possible
the applause was long and loud.
The only .iivertisement of the day was
I furnished by a dashing, big-hatted blonde
in tiie gallery. One speaker had suggested
that women who did not know what to do
with their time devote their superfluous
leisure to the children, when the blonde
vision propounded the momentous ques
tion: "Whin are you to do if you have no
children and can't get married?" A yig-
, cjrous voice responded: "Adopt an orphan
asylum," and the blonde subsided, cvi
â  dently satisfied.
The first paper of the afternoon was
i read by Mrs. Sara B. Gamble. She
; treated* her subiect, * rJohemla and P.ill
i latla," boldly, drawing her comparisons
i and conclusions in vigorous fashion.
She called Phllistia "a titled commun-
i ty ruled by conventionalities, where
' friendship and love cannot flourish," and
i alluded to Bohemia as "the proud land
i of promise which fascinates and furnishes
tin picturesque to the world, while sow
ing for Philistia to reap."
the lady said in part:
"In republics there is no aristocracy, no
populace: so there is theoretically a little
i silver spoon in every baby's mouth. The
presidency is open to every boy baby and
will soon be to every little defrauded girl
baby Genius does not flourish in Philis
tlan borders and neither is Phlllstla
I troubled with a conscience.
"The ideals of Philistia are the vagaries
of fashion.
"Whoever has a hobby finds himself
welcomed in Bohemia. A Bohemia:n, like
a lost Pleiad, may wander in Philistia and
a l'liilistian now and then lays aside his
dress coat and saunters Into Bohemia."
Miss Sidney R. Yarrow followed with a
paper on "The Church as a Source of Fel
lowship." The lady's essay was made up
largely of quotations, the gist of which
conveyed the sentiment that the Christian
church is a fellowship as born in the heart
of Jesus, whose message was love.
The first speaker of the evening session
was Mrs. Mary Roberts Smith of Stan
ford University. Mrs. Smith dealt with
her subject. "Clothes and Character," In
an easy, fluent manner, showing much
familiarity with her subject.
She took her auditors back to primitive
times, and traced the gradual rise of

A TRAVELING MAN.
Gives Some Valuable Hints Regard-
ing the Care of the Health
While Traveling.
Mr. R. W. Wincherdon, a commer-
cial traveler from Birmingham, whose
business keops him almost constantly
on the road, relates in the Sunday
News the dangers to health resulting
I from constant change of residence and
the way he overcame the usual injuri-
ous effects.
He says: One thing people traveling
cannot very well avoid is the constant
change in water and food; the stomach
never has an opportunity to become
accustomed to anything and in a few
years or much sooner the average trav-
eling man becomes a hopeless dyspeptic.
For several years I suffered more or
less from indigestion, sour stomachs,
headaches, distaste for food, often no
appetite, gas on the stomach and the
usual unpleasant effects of Imperfect
digestion.
Nearly every traveling man has his
favorite remedy for different troubles
and I tried all of them with Indifferent
results. Finally on the train between
Pittsburg and Philadelphia one day, I
overheard a conversation between two
ladies, one of whom had suffered se-
verely from indierestlon and stated she
had been completely cured by a remedy
which she called Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets; I remembered the conversa-
tion because it directly interested me,
and at the next town I inquired at the
first drug store and bought a package
for 50 cents, and from that day to this
I have never been without them. They
are pleasant tasting tablets, not a se-
cret patent medicine, but composed of
vegetable essences, pure pepsin, fruit
salts and Golden Seal; being in tablet
form they never lose their good quali-
ties like a liquid medicine would, but
are always fresh and ready for use.
I carry a box in my pocket continu-
ally, and whenever I see any symp-
toms of indigestion I take one, also one
after each meal, and for a year and a
half I have not lost a day by reason of
poor health and can eat anything and
relish what I eat; my digestion Is ab-
solutely perfect as far as I can judge
from my feelings, and although there
may be other stomach medicines just
as good as Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
I do not know what they are. Certainly
for people who travel they are far
ahead of any liquid medicine, as they
are so convenient, they can be carried
in the pocket and used whenever
needed.
I believe they are sold by all drug-
gists at 50 cents, and believe any one
who will try them will agree with me,
that for indigestion and stomach
trouble Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are
unequaled.
dress from the comfortable necessity to
the oranmental, ugly, disfiguring garb of
modern time.
"With men," said the speaker, "clothes
represented utility first, with women It
was fashion. Women's dress was indica
tive of the wealth of her owner in ancient
times. Now women's dress is the expres
sion of the affluency of the man to whom
she la attached, a conspicuous indication
of her husband's or father's wealth. The
facilities of manufacture have made
clothing common and that has brought
about the changes of fashion.
"The natural effect of fashions on char
acter is that they destroy the fundamental
love of beauty: they make us vain: they
develop a love of ronspicuousness; they
make us morbidly conscious: destroying
independence of character. The constant
change of fashion destroys stability.

do not respectâ those who lead the fash
ions. Therefore there is need of dress re
form.
"The dress of woman now expresses the
status of woman long gone by, because
It violates the principles of beauty and
health.
"Women will never dress rationally till
they know how their body is made and
when woman expresses her own efficiency
and not frivolity.
, "Reform in woman's dress must come
from within. A woman's dress must be
what she is. Woman must want to be
well, beautiful and lovable. Dress re
form is a matter of development of the
whole human race, making the outward
respond to the inner."
This paper called Mrs. Carr to the dis
cussion, and she declared that as soon as
man approved of dress reform all women
stood ready to adopt it.
Professor C. A. Duniway chastised the
press in his paper "Social Functions and
the Newspapers."
Professor Duniway, in true pedagague
fashion, went back to primitive days and
traced the press from its glorious origin
to the present degenerate times. He
sympathized with the news-demandlne;
public and the editor, whose ideals he
declared were shattered in the interest of
the business office.
"The newspaper in modern times," he
said "is said to stand for the utmost lib
erty of expression. But it represents the
inculcator of some particular doctrine, is
the mouth piece of some trust, some
political party. The editor is ruled by the
business office, and the reporter who
goes out is from that same business of
fice standpoint told to 'roast' this man
and praise this one.
"The ideal editor cannot exist. Every
editor must have regard to the opinions of
his subscribers. It is a mistake to say
the press is free. It is subordinated to
the business office interests."
The yellow Journals also came in for a
scoring, and the professor vigorously ad
vanced the theory: "If you don't like a
nasty newspaper, keep It out of your
bouse."
The programme for to-day's session is
as follows:
Social Activities â Afternoon session:
"The Influence of Women's Clubs on So
cial Life," J. W. Orr.

f "" Special Correspondence of The Call.
" HONOLULU, April 27.â The Marfpo
ca arrived this morning: and will prob
ably sail before the Alameda, from San
Francisco, arrives in part, consequent
ly Honolulu is on the tenter-hooks of
expectation of important news.
The Minister of the Interior, Captain
J. A- King, returned in excellent health
by the Mariposa. It is understood that
"he will make a report in connection
â¢with a large dry and repairing dock
that the Government feels inclined to
Tecommend the construction of in the
.Vicinity of the Nuuanu stream, or Bwa
elde of the harbor, but it is scarcely
probable that an appropriation will be
made at this session of the Legisla
ture, except perhaps for the c.ost of
preliminary exeminations and reports,
as the unsettled condition of the ques
tion of annexation interferes with such
contemplated improvements. Fur
thermore, the Government is being pes
tered with questions and reports on the
work already done in the line of harbor
improvements. The outlook is that it
has earned tedious and costly litiga
tion fn several matters in this connec
tion, including the Oahu La^nd and
Railroad and the Kahului matter..
In one controversy â that in regard to
the erection of the C. L. Carter memo
rial In Palace Square â the Government
has been very sorely handled by both
houses of the Legislature, which
adopted almost unanimously a concur
rent resolution compelling the removal
of the memorial fountain, the construc
tion of which had already been com
menced with the illegal sanction of the
Government.
and Smith, would have enforced its re
tirement from office, but under this
"republican" constitution votes of cen- '
sure are powerless and unavailing to
remove.
The opposition does not desire a
change of administration until the
elections next year, when it hopes the
popular will as expressed at the ballot
box will be sufficiently appreciative of
the disastrous policy of the Government
to relegate it to political oblivion.
Out of the wreck of political ambi
tions unsatisfied the only apparent
probability is that the Minister of t
Finance will receive the nomination
for President to succeed Mr. Dole. He
is thought to be the only man who
could break the threatened deadlock in
.the Senate at the next Presidential
election, when eight votes in the Sen
ate will control the situation.
If Mr. Damon is not having his wires
installed for this nomination, then the
politicians of all parties are much de- :
ceived. So far, his policy has been in
ternal developments, coupled with
economy; regard annexation as a pos
sibility, not a probability; be Just and
Hrenerous to the Hawaiians; forgive and
forget the past rather than lrritatingly
recall it, and broaden the people's lib
erties and trust them as friends and
equals, not with suspicion and dis- j
trust.
The British steamer Mogul arrived j
in port on Monday last with 643 Japa- :
nese contract laborers â 511 men, 128 >
women and 4 children.
The Government has published a de
tailed account of the taxes assessed,
collected and delinquent for 1897, from
â which are culled the following items,
showing the nationalities of the tax
payers: Hawaiians and half castes,
paid, $112,884; delinquent, $21,701 27.
American and European, $131,384 51;
delinquent, $5916 38. Portuguese, $28,
224 43; delinquent, $2626 35. Chinese,
$119,602 72; delinquent. $5761 59. Japa
nese, $95,719 47; delinquent, $662 40.
Various nationalities. $832 90; delin
quent. $75 10. American and European
corporation?, $230,170 85; delinquent,
$162 57. American and European firms,
i 540,885 10; delinquent, $223 20; or a
total of assessed taxes of $796,752 84;
collected $759,703 9S and delinquent $37,
048 06â not a very bad showing for
"hard times" and political disturbance.
President Dole has signed the first
bill for the payment of an Indemnity
to a British subject, a native of
Jamaica, for illegal imprisonment and
cruel treatment during, as the special
service certificates of the Government
term it, "the rebellion against the re
public of Hawaii during the month of
January, 1895. )
In a very short time now the action
JOt the British Government will be
lenown in regard to nine other claims
for which a specific demand has been
made and refused by the Hawaiian
Government.
The importance of this question of
compensation lies in the fact that sev- j
eral other governments are awaiting !
the action of the British Govern- I
ment, and that it has been intimat- i
ed on fairly reliable authority that the I
Washington government desires to see j
Its claims settled by Hawaii before an- j
nexatlon is consummated.
ALASKA PACK TRAIN
OFF TO CHICKAMAUGA.
Abandoned Belief Expedition Starts
Eastward to Join the Volun
teer Army.
SEATTLE, May 3.â A special train
left Seattle to-night over the North Pa
cific Railway to St. Louis via Billings.
It consisted of eight cars and its de
parture is caused by war emergencies
â¢which have resulted in orders to the
members of the Government aban
boned relief expedition to repair with
its equipment to the army station at
St. Louis. The party consists of twenty
men under the command of Lieutenant
Ryan of the Ninth United States Cav
alry. They took with them ten days'
traveling rations, issued by Captain
William W. Robinson Jr. These men
constitute the only organized pack
train in the United States army, and
they^were sent north to take provisions
into Dawson.
The destination of the cavalry de
tachment is problematical. The spe
cial train conveys the men, their per
sonal baggage and camp equipment,
ninety-two pack mules and eight horses
to St. Louis. It is not believed that
they will be detained there, but sent >>n
to the mobilisation army at rhick.-i
mauga, at which point they will ops
rate as the exigencies of the war may
demand.
The orders that were first sent to
lieutenant Ryan at Dyea were for him
to proceed to Vancouver Barracks.
Upon his arrival here other orders 11
recting him to St. Louis changed these

NAPA'S FIRE HOSE
RUINED BY THE ACT
OF AN INCENDIARY
Department Rendered Helpless and an At
tempt Then Made to Destroy the
KAPA, May 3.â Early this morning an incendiary made an attempt to
destroy Napa by fire. The Fire Department, which is composed of four
volunteer companies, was called out by an alarm at about 1:30, and the
fire was located In a barn belonging to C. Mansfield. No sooner was
water turned into the- hose than the discovery was made that some one had
cut the hose of every one of the companies. Long gashes were made
and, of course, the hose was useless. The barn of Mansfield was de
stroyed with all Its contents, including several tons of hay.
When the enraged firemen returned to their respective stations with
their paraphernalia a second alarm was turned in. The fire this ttme was
In the confer of town and in the rear of William Hunter's blacksmith
shop. A pile of rags and rubbish saturated with coal oil ' gave evidence
of the Incendiary's methods. The fire In Hunter's blacksmith shop had not
got well under way. and it was extinguished by a few buckets of water.
It was a fortunate thing that the second alarm 's&unded so promptly,
for if the fire had gained any headway It would have razed the main part
of Napa,

Superintendent Black Tells of the
Progress of Education In â¢ (
California.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, . May To-day's j
session of the Teachers' Institute was j
interesting from various points of view,
mainly on account of the personality
of the lecturers. These were Professor
Edward Howard Griggs of Stanford
University, Professor L. D. P. Syle of
Berkeley and State Superintendent of
Public Instruction Samuel P. Black. |
Both the morning and afternoon ses
sions . were preceded and followed by
patriotic songs, and \ the various . fea- !
tures of the programme were inter- ,
spersed with vocal and instrumental
selections, which are the especial care
of Professor Charles N. Watson. ,'â 
Professor Syle gave the first lecture
at the morning session, his theme be
ing "School Discipline." Professor
Griggs followed with an essay on "In- I
spired Teaching." Both themes were 'â 
elucidated in a masterful manner and
drew forth discussion by the institute.
After recess Professor Syle descant
ed on the subject "English in Elemen
tary Schools" and Professor Griggs on
"The Use of Literature in Teaching
History." ;
At the afternoon session a forceful '
address was delivered by Superinten
dent Black. He referred to the sub
ject of education generally, speaking
briefly on the immense educational
strides taken of late years, and. giving
the younger teachers especially some
excellent ideas in "teaching the young
idea how to shoot." . ProfessoT Syle lee- ;
tured at this session on "Do Our Uni- j
versities Stand for Progress?" He
answered himself in the affirmative. j
To-morrow's session will doubtless j
prrrve fully as interesting as to-day's.
The teachers are all enjoying them- \
selves keenly and are looking forward j
to next Thursday, when the institute ;
in a body will visit the Oakland
schools. _____ ____Â«Â«â .
ARIZONA COWBOYS TO
ROUND UP THE DONS.
The Territory the First to Muster 1..S
Quota of Volunteers for the
War.
PHOENIX, May 3.â Sixteen stalwart
cowboys arrived here to-day from Gila
County, having traveled overland from
Globe, a distance of 130 miles, to Join
the volunteer eavarlymen recruiting at
Whipple Barracks.
They left on the regular train leaving
here at 9:30. Globe is about 60 miles
from the nearest railroad, and news of
the recruiting did not reach the people
there until late Friday. They received
their quota and wired Governor McCord
on Monday to reserve a piace for them.
It was close work, but the Governor re
ceived word this afternoon from Major
Brodie at Whipple that they would be
received If they could reach the bar
racks to-night. All the Gila County
men are veteran cowboys and one of
them served seven years In the British
army.
A handsome silk flag will be pre
sented to-morrow to the cowboy cav
alrymen from Arizona by Governor
McCord, who left here to-night for
Whipple Barracks for that purpose.
The flag was made by the Women's
Relief Corps of Phoenix. The Governor
is accompanied by Territorial Secre
tary Akers, Adjutant-General Lewis.
Captain Baldwin. U. S. A., and Attor
ney-General Frazier.
Arizona has the honor of having re
cruited the first volunteers in the pres
ent war, the work havinr commenced,
in fact, some time befqre hostilities
opened. This honor was acknowledged
to-day by the President in reply to a
telegram sent by Governor McCord.
ALMOST A LYNCHING
AT THE MOBILE CAMP.
Adjutant-General Johnson Saves a
Negro From the Fury of a Crowd
of Soldiers.
MOBILE, Ala.. May* 3.â A riot was
narrowly averted at the State camp of
the National Guard to-day. During a
dispute between a private and Louis
Reed, a negro vender of soft drinks,
over the payment for a bottle of soda
water, several members of Company X,
Birmingham Rifles, closed in upon th<e
disputants. The negro, becoming
scared, drew a pistol and fired into the
soldiers, shooting Sergeant Hugh Col
lins. The negro then ran, pursued by
500 soldiers and citizens, who ran him
to cover under a doorstep on South
Carolina street.
The negro's life probably was saved
by Adjutant-General Johnson, who ap
peared with two drawn revolvers and
stood the men off until the police could
take the negro away.

temple, died to-night.

LEARNING THE
TRUTH AT LAST
Madrid Press Denounces
the Government's
Deception.
Spaniards Had Been Led to
Believe the Manila Har
bor Impregnable.
Sagasta Regime Said to Have Deliv
ered Seotrwi Over to Ameri
can Grapeshot.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MADRID, May 3.â Referring to the
Increased censorship and the cautions
issued by General Daban with refer
ence to the publication of news, re
pressing the transmission even of
editorials from the Madrid Journals, El
Nacional exclaims:
â  "What is taking place In the tele
graphic service is truly scandalous. So
far as provincial correspondents are
concerned, the 'Black Cabinet' has
seldom worked so thoroughly as at the
present moment, when it depends upon
a Minister who calls himself a Liberal.
This irritation is sharply provoked by
the Government's suppressions as to
the battle at Manila,"
Commenting upon it El Nacional,
which is the organ of the Weylerite
party, says: "Yesterday, when the
first intelligence arrived, nothing better
occurred to Admiral Bermejo (Minister
of Marine) than to send to all the
newspapers comparative statistics of
the two contending squadrons. By this
comparison he sought to direct public
attention to the immense superiority of
a squadron of ironclads over a squad
ron of wooden vessels, dried by the
heat In those latitudes.
"Spain undoubtedly sees therein the
heroism of our marines, but she also
and above all sees the nefarious crime
of the Government. It Is unfair to
blame the enemy for possessing forces
superior to ours, but what is worthy of
being blamed with all possible vehe
mence is this infamous Government,
which allowed our inferiority without
neutralizing it by some means of pre
parations."
With reference to the catastrophe
El Nacional continues: "A good bat
tery off Corregidor Island with great
reflectors and guns capable of sweep-
Ing the seas for miles around would
have kept the American squadron out
of the- bay. In Corregidor there were
only a few wretched guns taken from
warships a few days ago. This is the
truth. Our sailors have been basely
delivered over to the grapeshot of the
Yankees, a fate nobler and more
worthy of respect than those baneful
Ministers who brought about the first
victory' and its first victims."
El Heraldo de Madrid says: "It was
no caprice of the fortunes of war. From
the very first cannon shot our fragile
ships were at the mercy of the formid
able hostile squadron. They were con
demned to fall, one after another, un
der the fire of the American batteries,
powerless to strike, and were defended
only by the valor in the breasts of their
sailors. What has been gained by the
illusion that Manila was fortified?
What has been gained by the intima
tion that the broad and beautiful bay
on whose bosom the Spanish fleet per
ished had been rendered inaccessible?
What u?e was made of the Island of
Corregidor? What was done with its
guns? Where were the torpedoes?
Where were those defensive prepara
tions concerning which we were re
quested to keep silent?"
El Heraldo, referring further on to
the extent of the disaster, says: "We
cannot define it. The Government has
not defined it for the information of the
country, and although the greater por
tion of yesterday's cabinet council was
devoted to the subject the Government
has refused to issue even. a note, leav
ing us in ignorance respecting its views
on this fateful event. There is nothing
rash in the suspicion that the Govern
ment's attitude in this matter is a de
sire to hide a part of the truth. This,
however, is a baneful mistake."

LIGHTWEIGHTS
PUNCH HEADS
The San Francisco Athletic Club
Holds a Successful Tour
nament.
Priest Proves a Surprise and Makes
Things Warm for His Op
ponents.
Last night's lightweight tournament of
the San Francisco Athletic Club devel
oped a boxer who Is a pocket edition of
doughty Joe Choynskl In appearance,
science and hitting powers. His name
is Priest, and from the exhibition he gave
of his prowess he will doubtless convert
such clever youngsters as Lawler, Ott
and other leaders In his class into "has
beens." He only appeared twice in the
tournament, and the showing he made
against his opponents led every ringgoer
In the packed club-room to pick him as a
winner.
But for the humane and just Interfer
ence of popular Sergeant Brophy, the
tournament would have been completed.
In the semi-final round of the tourna
ment, young, gritty and willing "Billy"
Dirk and Priest were the contestants.
Although the boys were of the same
height, yet it could be easily seen that
Priest had the advantage In reach,
science, generalship and hitting powers.
The minute the gong sounded, both lads
began fiddling, and Priest drew Dirk out
with a clever feint and landed a stifr
left swing on the latter's head, knocking
him to his knees. Dirk regained his pins,
and after countering. Dirk in attempting
to duck a vicious left hook Just escaped
a heavy right uppercut which would have
lifted his head off had it landed. Seeing
that the plucky lad stood no chance
against Priest's onslaught, Sergeant
Brophy Interfered, and although he was
hissed the majority of those present ap
plauded his humane action. As was
proper. Referee E. J. Smith of the Acmes
decided it no contest.
The evening's sport opened with Perry
and McCarthy as cards. The four rounds
were filled in with wild swings, which en
dangered those seated outside the ropes
more than the contestants themselves.
Eventually the judges. Professor J. P. Be
han and H. Tank of the Acmes, gave
Perry a decision.
William Savage, a youth who bore out
his cognomen both in brutality and
power to take a beating, and Johnny Mc-
Donald, a lanky scrapper, entertained the
crowd with a lively set-to, In which Sav
age gained the honors.
It took Mr. Priest just two rounds to
show his superiority over Mr. Flannigan.
He outboxed the latter, outpunched nim
and nearly made him swallow his gum.
All this tired Mr. Flannigan and some
people were uncharitable enough to say
that he knew he was "up against it" and
lay down. At all events he was knocked
out.
"Billy" Dirk and Walter Dean put up
the grittiest battle of the tournament.
Dean outclassed Dirk in reach and
science, but the little fellow made up for
It In determination and willingness, which
won him a decision.
While the winners were resting Joe
Hftjisen sang and. Professor Franks gave
a bMndfold trapeze performance.
Porry and Savage, winners of the first
am! second bouts, then went at It for four
rounds and their work was so even that
another round was ordered. Perry's clean
hitting and fair tactics won him the deci
sion.
Perry and Priest will come together be
fore the club on the ISth lnst., when an
other exciting evenings entertainment
will be given.
Deserted His Family.
Gustave Tesch. a printer employed at
532 Commercial street, was arrested by Of

Tesrh that she is an invalid but has to
support her children, although her hus
band earns good wages at his trade.
DEWEY WILL
BE PROMOTED
Hero of Manila to Be
Made an Acting
Admiral.
Later He Will Be Elevated in
the Usual Course by Nomi
nation.
Message of Congratulation to Be Sent
as Soon a* He Has Been
Heard From.
BpÂ«cUl Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, May 3.
Secretary Long announced to-day
that as soon as the department received
any official word from Commodore
Dewey confirming the press accounts of
his victory In the battle of Manila a
cablegram would be sent to the officer
congratulating him upon the splendid
performance of the American fleet un
der his direction.
"Moreover," said the Secretary, "as
soon as the necessary confirmation is
at .hand. Commodore Dewey will be
made an admiral In recognition of his
valor. This will be accomplished imme
diately by an executive order designat
ing him acting admiral, just as was
done in the case of Captain Sampson.
Later he probably will be nominated
to the Senate in the usual course for
promotion to the rank of admiral."
None of the stories coming from
Spanish sources as to the battle of Ma
nila appears quite so ridiculous to na
val eyes as the solemn statement that
Commodore Dewey flred Manila and
the Spanish ships by the use of pe
troleum bombs. As a matter of fact,
there is no such weapon of warfare in
the American navy. The ordinary ser
vice shell Is very much more destruc
tive and quite capable of causing a lire
among combustible material. This i 3
plainly shown by the destruction of
ships through fires caused by service
shells during the Japanese-Chinese
war.
It was a disclosure of the great dan
ger to men-of-war thus bought prpmi
nently forward that led Secretary Her
bert to order reduced to a minimum all
the wood work on American ships and
to have all of this wood made fireproof.
One of the flr6t results of the battle of
Manila therefore is likely to be the
cessation of the efforts which had been
making for some time past to abandon
the fire-proofing treatment of wood
work because of certain minor incon
veniences from the use of wood thus
treated. _______________

POLYCLINIC
DAY A SUCCESS
Large and Stylish Crowd
Viewed the Racing
at Oakland.
Fleet- Footed May W Scam
pered Away With the
Handicap.
Mr. Hobart Â«nd Joe Ullman Took the
Gentlemen Riders' Race â Three
Favorites Were Beaten.
"Polyclinic day" at Oakland track yes
terday attracted a large crowd. Racing
folks are apparently no different from
other people, and when asked to donate to
a worthy cause will respond. The regular
race-goers were mustered In full force
and society was well represented In the
grand stand. The varying fortunes of one
following the turf received vivid Illustra
tion as though arranged for the occasion,
heavily played favorites and the loosely
backed and despised outsider passing the
wire in front. For the benefit of the up
per ten, a race for gentlemen riders was
arranged which served as the occasion for
Mr. Walter Hobart to show off his horse
manship to grood advantage.
The sport throughout was far above the
average, the different events all being
well contested. The game appears to be
still traveling along at an even clip, for
although this will be the final meeting of
the racing season sixteen bookmakers
were laying prices in the ring. After
ftiree favorites had been bowled over the
remaining three won in clever fashion.
The polyclinic handicap was rather a
disappointment, for of the original large
number of entries but five faced the bar
rier. The fast Calgary mare, May W, was
played down in the betting from 7 to 5
to 4 to 5, and with Gouln on her back won
in a common canter in 1:41^. In a hard
drive Fonsovannah took tho place from
Bernadillo.
The race for gentlemen riders was de
prived of all interest from the fact that
Joe Ullman, the mount of Mr. Hobart,
outclassed the others shoes to plates. A
prohibitive favorite in the betting, he won
easing up from Wawona, VVawona,
Huntsman and Metaire finished In the or
der named.
The sport began with the downfall of a
heavily played choice. Belllcoso was sent
to the pos.t a 6 to 5 chance, but Zamar led
all the way and won hands down from
Mocorito, with the favorite in the show.
Then Bonibel, another pronounced fa
vorite, was completely snowed under in
the two-year-old event at five furlongs.
Modwena, the third choice, with Piggott
fh the saddle, was out in the lead from
the start, and at the wire downed Sweet
Cakes in a gallop.
The starters In the mile and a sixteenth
were a most ordinary lot and an upset
was looked for. It came when Olive, a.
40 to 1 chance In the ring, led Hermanita
out with pounds to spare. The latter with
Lodestar held first call in the- betting.
Clawson on Lodestar managed to get
away last of the bunch and never Im
proved his position.
In the final five furlong dash St. Cala
tine outclassed her company, and ruling a
slight favorite over Stepabout in the ring,
passed her company in the stretch and
led Amasa, a 15 to 1 shot, out by a couple
of lengths with plenty in reserve. Lady
Ashley was a good third.

GREGGAINS ON
THE BIG FIGHT
The Pugilist Who Will Resort
to Foul Tactics % Must
Suffer.
Betting Is Now Very Spirited Â»nd
Mich Monsy Is Being ..â¢'*â¢â .
Wagered.
Jim Jeffries, who Is now looked upon by ;
the Eastern experts on boxing as the
greatest heavy-weight pugilist of the i
present day, has very little to say con
cerning the battle he will engage In on
Friday evening at Mechanics' Pavilion j
with Tom Sharkey.
In fact, when Jeffries Is asked for an i
opinion, he looks at you In amazement
for a moment, and then, with a big, good
natured smile, which illuminates his
countenance, says:
"Well, what the deuce do I know about
j It? I'll be there on time and I guess the
i sailor will be on deck to meet me. I can't
; venture an opinion, as I have not had the
I pleasure of meeting my prospective ap
i ponent In a glove shake, but I think the
large gathering of sport lovers who will
i witness the contest will not retire from
j the pavilion disappointedâ at least, so far
! as my part of the engagement Is con
i cerned.
"I certainly expect to win the match
: and without boasting I feel that four or
1 five rounds will end the big dispute. I
j am ready for a short siege or a long
' siege. Of course I shall fight entirely
i under instructions from my manager,
! Billy Delaney, and what he does not
know about the game is certainly not
worm much to any man In the business.
[ I think he is the greatest general of
i them all. 1 am in excellent condition,
In fact, never felt better in my life."
Alexander Greg-gains, the referee, will
have an opportunity on this occasion of
i earning a reputation for one of two
; things: By deciding the contest prompt
1 ly and regardless of what the gamblers
may think, in favor of the man who will
light strictly In accordance with the rules
i of Queensberry, he will earn an honora
ble record and the respect of all fair
minded sportsmen; while, on the other
hand, if Ureggalns shall permit of such !
palpable Infringement or the rules as will i
I disgust the spectators, who expect to see
! a clean contest, then he can safely count
upon receiving tne same treatment that
has been accorded some o? the local
referees whose conduct as referees haa
been unpardonable.
Of course there will be unintentional
fouls. In every fistic contest some foul
blows are struck, but the referee gen
erally overlooks them after having cau
tioned the contestant to be careful.
Greggains is well aware of the fact that
Bharkey so far forgets himself when he
once enters Into the heat of battle that
blows aimlessly directed may land on any
part of his opponent's anatomy. Accord
ing to an agreement entered into between
the referee and the contestants, Greg
gains distinctly informed both men that
he will not tolerate any foul fighting, and !
that the man who shall resort to rough and ;
unfair work in the hope of thereby win
ning the match will most assuredly lose
the contest.
"I may overlook a few unintentional er
rors," said Greggains, "but after I have
once cautioned either man, then the of
fender may expect to hoar judgment
passed against him should he disobey my
orders."
In conversing yesterday on the probable
outcome of the contest, Greggains said
that he will not show the least spark of
favor to either man and that he will fol
low the rules out to the letter.
"You see," remarked Referee Greggains,
"both of the men know just as well as I

THIS EXPEDITION TO THE NEW Dis-

companied by mining experts, together with
experienced guides. A mining party will ac-
company this expedition and direct passengers
to the richest claims In Alaska.
The steamship will arrive at Hotham Inlet
about June 18, which will be as early as the
flow of lcÂ« will admit navigation to Kotzebue
Sound.
Don't be deceived by various representations
of entering the sound before the date named.
On this expedition we will allow no more
than the steamship's cabin capacity will
admit.
She will make two trip* to Hotham Inlet,
leaving Hotham Inlet as late as September 16,
possibly ap late as September 25, giving ample
time for those going on her flret trip to locate
claims and return to San Francisco for the
winter.
Tickets for this sailing will be sold at the
very low rate of $200 per passenger, which In-
cludes 1000 pounds of baggage or freight free.
Additional freight at a low rate. Full Informa-

Laura. I bought my first supply of Ripans Tabules
more out of curiosity than anything else,
and was very much surprised at the good
results which followed their use. I had
often seen them advertised, but being a little
prejudiced against patent medicines I thought
they would do me no good. In future I
never want to be without them. I had been
troubled with indigestion and dyspepsia for
along time, and although I tried many kinds
of medicine, I never found anything really
to do me much good until I tried Ripans
Tabules.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YOKK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. May After yesterday's vio- j
lent advance In prices on stocks some reaction
was to be expected to-day^ The market opened
with Heavy selling orders by . large oprators,
â¢who were desirous of taking profits. '.. London
refused to 'accept* to the full ; extent the can- '
guine view taken yesterday by Wall street of >
the benefits to accrue from Commodore I>ew- ,
ty'u victory at Manila. American securities,
with one or two exceptions, showed declines on
the London Exchange before the opening here.
Yesterday's events in Wall street, had so far
uwakeneil outside Interest in the market that
commission houses found their books filled with
buying orders. The heaviness in London af
wtejf opening quotations, but â¢ they â  were not
down to the London parity.' The failure of the
market to advance served to discourage the
outside Interest and buying order* were with
drawn., ,the market gradually sagging to a
lower level. There was rather an inviting field
presented for, a bear raid, but the fact that to
morrow will be a - holiday made the profes
sional s"tlmld about putting out short contracts.
The firmness of the market and the strength
shown by somÂ« special stocks turned . the pro
fessional sentiment In the final hour to the
bull- Mile. There was quite, a heavy buying
movement which carried the prices of the mar
ket leaders nearly buck to last night's level
and established various gains through the list.
The ; scope of the trading .was : broad and em
braced .'i large number of stocks.
The money market showed | some tendency to
harden In the commercial paper ' department
and for call loans. A further engagement of
$2,000,000 of gold Import was a result. The rise
i â ! v t rent In the actual- rate tot Sterling Ex
change, In the â  wee of these developments was
unexplained. ' - . â¢ -.-..,
The bond market was active and strong
early, but- later reo-llratlons carried the prices
beta* last' night's level. Total sales, $l.7:>0,000.

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, May The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says:,. The stock
markets here opened good to-day on the Ameri
can war news, Americans naturally leading, j
but the support here was entirely bears' cover- !
lag on professional operations. There was no j
general buying and prices closed under the ,
best. Two more failures In the West Aus
tralian account are announced. The worst Is [
now over financially, but the matter possibly i
may reappear in the courts of. Justice. â¢.. \
Spanish 4s were neglected and dull.
The revival in Kaffirs continues.
A feature to-day was the sharp rise In In- |
dian stock and the fall of sliver on the an
nouncement of proposals of the Indian Govern
ment for an Immediate gold standard and on j
sales of silver stocks by the Government. The
details of the scheme, however, are so weak, |
Illogical and impracticable that they are not I
likely to be passed by the committee in their
present form.

NOTICE TO MARINERS.
Branch Hydrographlc Office, San Francisco,
Cal., May 3, 1898.
The following forecast of wind and weather
In the North Pacific Ocean for May, 1898, has
Just been received from the Hydrographic
Office in Washington:
During the month of May. the sun being
well . north of the equator, the wind and
weather may be expected to undergo marked
changes in several parts of the ocean.
The sub-chart of isobars and Isotherms which
appears ;on the pilot chart - and which express
generally the meterological conditions, shows
an almost permanent high, with its center
near latitude 35 degrees north and longitude:
140 degrees west. Around the high the general
circulation of the wind Is with the sun. Along
the south side, the northeast trade winds will
be found with an average-: force of 4 or 5
(Beaufort scale), varying In direction from
northeast to east-northeast, and with northern
limit near the thirtieth parallel.to the west of
the Hawaiian Islands, in the vicinity of
the twentieth parallel, ; they will prob
ably be from the east. Near the American
coast, within the trade wind limits, northerly
and northwesterly winds may be expected In
stead at northeasterly winds. The southern
limit of the .northeast and northern limit of
the southeast trades will be found farther
north than during April. In the doldrums, or
calm region between the trades, much rain
and frequent thunderstorms may be expected,
accompanied by calms, light variable winds,
or squalls. A moderate amount of fog may
be . expected along the coast of the -. United
States. Occasionally thunderstorms may be ex
pected along the coast of .Central America.
Over the , Aleutian -Islands will be found an
almost permanent low of considerable depth.
The general â¢ circulation of the winds â  around
this low Is against the sun. In this low area-
It will be observed, by an inspection of the
sub-chart, that the pressure diminishes more
gradually than last month, hence lighter winds
are to be expected. Between this low and high j
there Is a general movement of the atmosphere !
from Asia to America, as evidenced by the I
westerly and southwesterly winds. In the zone :
between 35 degrees and. 50 degrees north fre- j
i quent ' moderate westerly gales may be ex- '
pected, accompanied by rain, and. north .of "43 i
'â¢ degrees north latitude with occasional hail and
snow. These gale* may be expected, â¢ however, |
to be less frequent as compared with Â last )
month. In this region occasional fog may also
be expected. â  . â¢ â â 
Occasional spiral circulations, viz. the cy- j
clonic (against the- sun), with low barometer, â¢
and the anticyclonlc (with the sun), with high ;
barometer, ? will be â  found moving -In a gen
eral easterly- direction across u- e ocean. Gen- ;
erally, in front of the cyclonic area, or the
low, i the weather Is damp, with thermometer '
rising and barometer, falling, while in front j
of â  the t anticyclonlc - circulation, or the high, i
'it is dry, cooler and the barometer rises. The i
"average storm : track" . traced on the chart ;
shows the average path of the centers of these |
lows, and as this crosses the Pacific: above -50 i
degrees north latitude the storms and .gales
experienced in this ocean to the southward of ]
the track : and above 35 degrees north latitude,
are generally from southwest through west to
northwest. - ,
As a consequence of the changes In meteoro
logical ? conditions over Asia during this sea
son we may expect "to find the northeast mon
goon dying out, It being Interrupted with var
iable winds and calms until the southwest
monsoon sets In steadily along the southeast
coast of Asia, toward* the end of. the month.
This monsoon brines the wet season . with/ It.
and, hot. sultry and rainy, weaker may be ex-
P *Fog. mist and rain will be prevalent about
the Japan Islands -and coast of China. and
frequent squalls and thum'.er . storms may. be
expected in the vicinity of the Philippine Is

CLUB BY-LAWS
ARE MISSING

Others.

Friends of Pardea and Davis Sea
the Need of a Little Diplo
macy.
; iT* Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Mar 3.
The Young Men's Republican Club of
â¢": the Seventh Ward has lost its original
by-laws and constitution. The losing of
'a few pages of manuscript does not ap
pear to be a very momentous affair, but
-Hn this particular instance it is of some
Interest. Two years ago, when the club
was organized, by-laws were passed and
.' there are a few who think that under
the original constitution the club is for
bidden to indorse any candidate before
the convention- Recently the Seventh |
> ? TVard Young Men's Republican Club in
â  tlorsed Dr. Pardee as its candidate for the
taomt nation for Governor. This action
vac said to be unanimous, but some one
iiaa raised the question that under the
by-laws the clnb cannot become a per- J
tonal organization, but stands for Repub-
licanism and Republican candidates only.
. j ' The point, however, cannot be settled,
! because the by-laws are lost. It is sup
posed that Dick Aj'er or Turn Suden was
Keeper of the records, but neither is able
to produce them at this time.
To-morrow night the executive commit- j
lee will meet in Attorney Dodge's office
and frame new by-laws which will un- j
xioubtedly be ratified by a large major
ity of the club, if not unanimously, as '
the Seventh Ward is admittedly a Far- \
nee stronghold.
Much interest is now attached to thÂ» !
invention of the State League of Re
gfnblican Clubs, which Is to tie held In
Baa Francisco at the end of this month.
The league in this county was organized :
mainly by Hon. W. k. Davis, and he also
traveled over the State in the interest,
of the Republican national candidates in
the last general campaign. On the even- ;
Ing of the convention day the State com
mittee has announced that there will be
& mass meeting, at which addresses will
' be made by speakers of national repute. |
This is considered by the respective gub- ;
Â«rnatorlal factions In this county as be
ing a port of challenge as to who of all
the orators In the State are worthy of .
being classed as speakers of national rep- j
ulatlon. The friends of W. R. Davis re ;
fer to his record and will do their best
. to have his name on the programme. The
friends of Dr. Pardee are also anxious â 
that the coveted honor shall be his, It
being hardly expected that any two
speakers will be chosen from one county, j
COUNCIL DOINGS.
'Action Taken by the City Lawmakers
on Various Items.
J OAKLAND, May 3.â President Heitman
â will appoint Councilman Earl. Pringle and
Watklnson as a committee to examine
and report to the Council on the supplies
of the two water companies. At last
Â»!ghts meeting they refused to alternate
the fire hydrants between the two com
panies. They refused to grant Dr. Di nn,
Jlealth Officer, an additional $25 per month I
for horse hire, which caused President j
Heitman to announce that he would In- j
tro<3uce a resolution at the next meeting |
cutting off the $25 recently allowed Su- j
â  perintendent of Streets Miller.
It was decided to wait upon Division Su- :
perintendent Agler of the Southern Pacific !
Company and request the company to re- â 
move the Broadway ferry slip to the west
ward when rebuilding it. in order that the
Btxeet may be left open.
An anti-pool selling ordinance was In- !
troduced and referred to the Ordinance
and Judiciary Committee. The ordinance
authorizing the Board of Public Works '
to advertise for bids for the printing of '
;the delinquent tax list was finally passp.l.
JThe protest against the removal of the j
Idirket street gore building was set for !
May 16 at 8:30 p.m. for hearing.
On the opinion of City Attorney Dow, '
the contracting company doing the work !
On East Twelfth street was refused par- j
tlal payments. It desired pay for each i
block as completed, but the contract
states plainly that It is to be paid for
trhen completed.
The City Clerk was instructed to ad- |
vertise for bids for street lighting for the I
ccmlng year.
Amended Complaint, No Summons.
OAKLAND, May 3.â Edson F. Adams et ;
al, executors of the estate of Hannah
Adams, deceased, to-day 'filed an amend
ed complaint in their case against the I
City of Oakland to recover taxes paid un
der protest. The original complaint was '
flled May 15, IÂ£!>7. but no summons was
ever issued. The law allows a year's
delay, hence the time Is about up. No
summons was requested on the filing of
the amended complaint, and it may be ',
that another will go before any fur- I
ther action is taken. The taxes involved
are on 150 acres of the Adams tract, be
tween the old charter line and th<"- char
ter line before the recent annexation. The \
County Assessor assessed it at $228,150,
â while the Board of Equalization reduced
It to $152,150. The City Assessor took thÂ«>
County Assessor's figures before being
equalized, and the City Treasurer com
pelled Mr. Adams to pay $1162 IS for each
installment of taxes. If the equalized
figure had been taken the two sums
would have been $769 30 each, a difference
of $3*3 86 on each Installment, which he
seeks to recover with interest.

LOW WATER,
HIGH BEER
Council to Inspect and
Report on Reservoirs
and Springs.
Brewers Have Declared a Rise
in the Price of Malt
Liquors.
Thirsty People Do Not Think of the
Dry Summer With Great
Pleasure.
Oakland Office, San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 3.
With the prospect of a diminished sup
ply of water and the fact that the Oak
land brewers have raised the price of
beer materially the condition of Oak
landers is one to cause much concern.
When the City Council met last night
the resolution introduced by Mr. Pringlo
regarding economy in the using of water
was discussed. Its author stated that he
did not introduce it at the request or in
the interest of either of the water com
panies, but because he thought it better
to warn the people in time than to have
a water famine.
After some debate it was decided to ap
point a committee to report on the avail
able supplies of both companies and Pres
ident Hcitman named Messrs. Earl, Prln
gle and Watkinson to undertake the duty.
In past years the Alvarado supply has
been fitful, but its officers now declare
that there is no danger of a shortage. The
Contra Costa people are more conserva
tive nnd aeciare that there may be a lack
of water if people are as careless in the
future as at present.
Whereas, in some cities the total con
sumption of water averages nineteen gal
lons per capita per day, in Oakland the
consumption reaches the enormous figure
of ISO gallons per day. It is this great
waste that Induced Mr. Pringle to call
public attention to the necessity of ex
ercising discretion.
When the water rates were fixed for
the next fiscal year it was freely stated
that it would be cheaper to drink beer
instead of water. But this pleasing pros
pect has received a severe setback by thÂ«
sudden increase in the price of beer. The
retail dealers have announced that thera
will be no increase in the price of a glass
or schooner, but they say nothing about
decreasing the size of the drink and this
is what is causing such grave concern.
The raise in price is already In force
with a prospect that drought, scarcity of
wheat and barley and prevalence of war
may send it still higher.
JEFFRIES WILL
MEET STELZNER
Lively Boxing Arranged by
the Reliance Club for
To-Night.
Phil Green, thÂ« Acrobatic Fighter, Is
to Meat Lewis fop Eight
Rounds.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, May 3.
A very lively boxing programme is i
mapped out by the Reliance Club for to- I
morrow evening. The feature of the en- j
tertainment will be a three-round spar- j
ring contest between Jeffries and Stelz- !
ner. Although there is no prospect that !
this event will witness a knockout, a j
promise has been given that the set-to !
shall be sufficiently lively to make it in- j
teresting. This will bo the last appear- !
ance of Jeffries before his great fight with j
Sharkey and there will be a large contin
gent from San Francisco to size up their
man.
Jeffries has done most of his training j
at the Reliance Club, and his appearance j
to-morrow night is for the purpose of add
ing to the Interest in the wheelmen's
benefit.
There will be three preliminaries, after
which Kid McFadden of the Manhattan â 
Athletic Club and William Murmane of
the San Francisco Athletic Club will con- [
test for eight rounds, each to weigh 115 !
pounds.
Phi! Green, the local whirlwind, who
surprised the sports a month ago by his
peculiar methods, will meet Billy Lewis of
Vallejo for eight rounds. On his last ap- i
pearance Green showed that he was as I
much of an acrobat as a boxer, and con
siderable of both, and the match is creat
ing much Interest because there has been
a general desire to see him again in the
ring. Both men will weigh in at 150
pounds.
The new plan of appointing two judges j
as well as the referee will be carried out
at these contests.
Lon Agnew, the local boxer, and Mike j
McCormick have been matched to box ten |
rounds before the Oakland Athletic Club '
on the 12th of this month. This is the first \
time for several years that a contest has |
been arranged for ten rounds, eight hay- j
ing been the limit granted the club. It |
has been generally conceded that all the j
dissatisfaction arising from past contests j
could have been avoided had the contest- j
ants been permitted to stay In the ring ten
rounds, as eight is rather too little to try !
out two good men sufficiently to give a !
popular and just decision.
Lieutenant Bird's Narrow Escape.
OAKLAND, May Lieutenant Manly !
D. Bird of the Boys' Brigade was nearly
killed last night by being run into by a
team driven by a man named Frank. The
team was going at a rapid gait and threw
Lieutenant Bird from his wheel on Tel- :

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 4, 1898.
ALL MONEY IS
ACCOUNTED FOR
Elder Wishart's Name
Used by Some One
Else.
Says Rev. Mr. Davis Has Faults,
but He Certainly Merits
Fair Play.
Only the Grace of God Can Work
Needed Reform In the Late
Christian Pastor.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, May 3.
Rev. Edwards Davis is not without
friends. Although much has been said
â¢ and published about the ex-pastor of the
i Central Christian Church, there is one
j man who does not intend that more shall
; be said about him than he deserves.
i James W. Wlshart declares that some of
j the reports given out last Sunday by In
terested parties regarding the incidents
! of the meeting at the elder's house and
I also at the church are highly colored in
i some respects. Mr. Wishart wishes it dis
, tlnctly understood that, whatever faults
Rev. Mr. Davis may possess, he has no
differences with the church regarding
finances.
To-day Elder Wishart made public the
following statement:
"I wish to correct a very serious charge
which has appeiared in print regarding
Rev. Edwards Davis, former pastor of
the- Central Christian Church of Oakland.
The statement I refer to is as follows:
" 'On Friday evening last a meeting of
the officers of the church was held at the
home of Elder James M. Wishart. who
has been one of Davis' stanchest friends.
The elders a.nd deacons found there had
been a large amount of money paid into
the church during the time Davis was
pastor, for which no account was given.
The total amounted to quite a sum.'
"In the first place, the financial part
of the church was not named at the above
meeting, nor were any money matters
discussed in connection with Mr. Davis.
Second, as an elder of the church I do
not know of any money having been paid
to Rev. Mr. Davis for church purposes but
what was accounted for. Third, a full
report of the finances of the church was
made at or near the close of Rev. Mr.
Davis' pastorate, which was passed upon
and approved by the church. Fourth, the
books that were kept by Rev. Mr. Davis"
secretaries for the past three years can
be seen at any time and examined if need
be.
"I make this statement in order to give
the public to understand that the party
which so unkindly accused Rev. Mr. Davis
of the misappropriation of funds under
my name had no business to do so.
"However, I am free to admit that Rev.
Edwards Davis, as a young man. has his
faults, which I pray he will, by the grace
of God, be able to overcome, in order that
his power as a preacher, which is hard to
ecjuai, may be turned to the honor axid
glory of our Lord.
"JAMES M. WISHART."

FREIGHT RATES
MAY BE LOWERED
The Southern Pacific Company
Has Made Some New
Promises.
It Asks the Help of the Manufac
turers* and Producers' Asso
ciation.
There were several matters of no small
i Interest discussed yesterday at the meet
ing of the directors of the Manufacturers 1
and Producers' Association, over which
the new president, A. Sbarboro, presided.
> The first was a report by E. Everett of
I the traffic committee upon the inequali
i ties in the matter of rates between east
; and westbound freights. Several weeks
i ago a letter was sent to the members of
I the association giving figures that showed
that hundreds of articles of merchandise
can be sent from the East to this coa-st
much cheaper than the similar articles
can be sent from this coast to the East.
Mr. Everett stated that Mr. Stubbs of the
Southern Pacific Company was much an
j noyed at tho publication of the letter, but
I nevertheless the officials of the railroad
I showed a manifest disposition to deal
fairly with the Western manufacturers.
Mr. Everett was sure of this, because
Mr. Stubbs had promised to do all in his
| power to have his company equalize the
I rates, the corporation having already
j committed itself in this direction. That
railroad official stated that his company
will work to accomplish the wishes of the
association at the meeting of the trans
continental convention of railroad men,
which takes place in Milwaukee within
the next week or two. Mr. Stubbs told
Mr. Everett that the Southern Pacific
Company has not all of the say In the
matter of changing the rates so as to
conform to the wishes of the Western
shippers and manufacturers, the Eastern
roads, no doubt, being determined to
favor the Eastern peopla as much as pos
sible. Looking at the situation, Mr.
Stubbs said he expects to have a tight on
his hands when he stands up in the In
terests of the Western people at the com
ing 1 convention.
The same official told Mr. Everett that
he would like to have a committee from
the association attend the convention
co as to show the representatives uf the,
Eastern roads that the Western manufac
turers and public are making the demanc
for justice and fairness in the matter
rates. J. W. Kerr stated that the Sout
crn Pacific Company has found that
must assist In the development of th
industries of the West, for the Easter
roads are no longer feeders of that sy
tern. It was decided that Mr. Evere
should attend the convention as the re
resentatlve of the association and get a
many more of the members as he can
accompany him.
The matter of pure food was dlscusse
at length. It was the belief of the d
rectors that much good could be accom
nlished by having the Government reg
late the issuance of the proposed wa
tax stamps by making the tax on pu
foods much lighter than upon stuff th
is not pure or mixed. To this end Pres
dent Sbarboro was directed to send the
following dispatch to the Pacific Coast
representatives in Washington :
"In framing new revenue law the Man
ufacturers' and Producers' Association o
California requests discrimination
favor of pure food articles by light stam
taxes on pure food products and heavle
taxes on mixed and substitute foo
products."
The directors decided to accept the In
vltntion of Chief Sullivan of the Fire De
partment to witness an exhibition of h
new fire tower to-day at the foot of Ba
street, and also to extend to him a vo
of thanks for his close attention to th
interests of the manufacturing district o
this city. Five new members were elcc
cd. Manager Lewis reported tha> a lo
of Oregon beer Is being brought, into this
city to the injury of a number of the
members of the association, who are
brewers. The matter was left in his
hands for investigation.

IN THE REAL
ESTATE WORLD
A Week Brings Little
Improvement in the
Market.
Building Is Also Dull and Few
Large Contracts Are Being
Made.
Glance at the Records, Sales and
General Heal Estate
Notes-
The lapse of a week has done little
toward bettering the condition of the real
estate market of this city and the realty
realm generally throughout the State. But
! few salos, and very trivial ones at best,
have kept business alive in the various
I offices throughout the city, and life in the
j country markets seems well nigh extinct.
Building, with but a few exceptions, has
been extremely slow here, with no im
provement In the country- The only sale
that a broker can at the present time
i boast of can easily be narrowed down to
I the ordinary random note.
The theory advanced in explanation of
| the stagnant condition of affairs is gen
erally attributed to hostilities with Spain
and the confusion In the markets that
the war will naturally produce In active
progression.
The mortgages a.nd trust deeds re
corded for the last seven days are slightly
in advance of the record for the preced
ing week, amounting to several hundred
dollars more than the sum total of re
leases and reconveyances.
REVIEW OF THE RECORDS.
During the week there were seventy
six mortgages and trust deeds recorded,
! amounting to $226,547. For the same period
forty-eight relrasf-s and reconveyances
> passed to record in the total sum of
$457,069.
The principal mortgages and trust deeds
were as follows:

of the Park and Ocean Railway, met with
a fearful death yesterday morning. Ha
was sitting on a load of railroad ties on a
flat car which was being pushed ahead
by a locomotive. A sudden jolt
caused the ties to slip off. and Kerrigan
was thrown off. falling in front of the car.
The wheels passed over the legs and abdo

mangled, bleeding and senseless when
picked up.
He was taken to the Park Receiving
Hospital, but died soon after reaching
that place.
The deceased was a native of Ireland,
aged 40 years. He resided at 135 Boyco
street, and was married only six months
ago.
The engineer, John Spark, surrendered
i to the police and was booked for man
i slaughter.

MAJOR HOOPER,
THE ESTHETE
His Love of the Beautiful
Made Manifest Yes
terday.
A 1 the Maids From Now on
Must Appear in French
Caps.
Other Innovations of Equal Magnitude
Sor n to Take Place in the Mont
gomery-Street Hostelry.
Major Hooper, the esthetio manager of
the Occidental Hotel, having completed
various Improvements in the hostelry
over which he presides, has determined
to cap the climax of his house's adorn
ment by capping all the handsome maid
servants whom he employs, and thus of
fering an additional attraction to the ap
preciative commercial and the casual
globe-trotter who occasionally drifts to
our shores In search of adventure. The
elrla themselves don't seem to take kindly
to the Innovation. They are all good
Irish lassies, from the large, buxom
maiden who halls from Kerry to the lit
tle girl who speaks with affection of the
"auld foks" In Athlone, and they object.
with a stubbornness inherited from gen
erations of fighting ancestry, to covering
their shining locks with a "flimsy bit aye
Frinch monkey business fur th' sake aye
sthoyle."
When the major's order was first made
known there was a conclave held, and
loud and angry were the protests against
the new order of things. Some of the
more hot-headed ones gave notice on the
spot, and those who did not leave vowed
they would not have their Independence
curtailed In the matter of dress nor be
placed on the level of common nurse
maids whose best boast is that they
have some time or other been the cus-
dhressed me own hair fur th
last fifty years,' said Mary Ann McGrath,
"an 1 no'major, captln or glneral can make
th' likes aye me put wan aye thim things
an me head at this toime aye lolfe.
Kate McGinness was even more emphatic.
"Sure there's more nor wan by aye half
th' age aye th' auld major who has been
willin 1 to take me, hair an' all, an Ol 11
love." And she did.
But despite the kicks the major was
bent on having his way. and consequently
every maid who remained in the house
appeared yesterday morning in a brand
new cap and a white apron. The new
arrangement has met with such univer
sal satisfaction, and the major Is so
pleased with the effect of his enterprise
Ihat it is whispered, he contemplates go-
Ing even further Into the new and beau
tiful, and it will not be long before other
changes are noticed in his establishment.
What these changes will be no one con
nected with the house will say, but it is
believed that the bell boys will soon be
attired in yellow livery, the elevator boys
nrf to have electric wires attached to
their spines, and every waiter will appear
on the floor of the dining room with a
smoothly shaven face and a flower in his
buttonhole. The major himself will re
ceive distinguished guests attired In the
uniform of the Loyal Legion, while his
son George will stand behind the desk
wrapped in a smile and the consciousness
of his own virtue.
"HURRAH FOR DEWEYI"
A Public Meeting to Congratulate
the Pacific Squadron's Com
mander.
The commercial people of this city are
rejoicing at the victory of the United
States navy in the Philippine Islands for
more reasons than one. If the Spanish
fleet had been so fortunate as to cripple
or defeat the ships under the command of
Commodore Dewey there was much fear
that San Francisco would be the first
place that the squadron of the Dons
would head for. With coal In plenty at
any number of ports along the coast
and much treasure In the Federal and
municipal vaults, It was believed that
the Spanish commander would make
for this port as fast as steam
and s<fUls could carry him and
his ships. Even If the guns at
the port of San Francisco called a halt
in their progress, there would still be a
rich coastwise shipping for the Spanish
to prey upon. All of these matters wor
ried the commercial men not a little.
In truth, they were so uneasy that the
Chamber of Commerce sent a strong pe
tition to the War Department to fit out a
number of the available steamers on the
coast as cruisers to go forth and face the
privateers and other hostile ships that
might come this way. The recent victory
of commodore Dewey has set all of their
fears at rest, and now they propose to
show their gladness of heart hv having
a general public meeting called for 2
o'clock- to-day In the Chamber of Com
merce, the purpose of which Is to con
gratulate Commodore Dewpy upon his
grand success In the Philippine engage
ment, which means that the Pacific Ocean
is tn be free, open and unobstructed to
commerce. The call for this meeting was
mad*" upon President Hugh Craig by five
Influential members of the chamber, and
the Intention Is to have all of the large
public, mercantile and commercial bodies
present, a)?" SUJ many prominent citizens
and army and navy officers as possible.
Spirited speeches will be made by the
president (Mr. Craig), Irving M. Scott,
Captain Taylor, Mayor Phelan and many
others. Patriotic resolutions and con
gratulations will be framed and forwarded
to the War Department, and a general
rejoicing may be expected.
ENTHUSIASTIC MASONS.
Working Hard for the Fair to Aid
the Widows' and Orphans'
Home.
Arrangements arc now almost com- j
pleted for the great Masonic festival.
Committees and the ladles In charge of j
the different booths have been hard at '
work much has been done. A feature j
of Crescent Court of the Amaranth will j
be the disposal of a handsome bedroom ;
suit which has been donated by W. & J. ;
Sloane & Co., and it will be won by the
most lucky and most popular individual j
who visits the booth. Frledlander, Gott
lob & Co. have offered to give a matinee
for the benefit of the Widows' and Or- !
phans' fund. In their communication
making the offer the theatrical managers
eav: Not one cent, as far as we are
concerned, shall be taken for expenses of
any sort. We desire the fund to get the
whole benefit." '
The members of Oakland Commandery
of the -lights Templar will appear in
evening dress during the festival, and
they will entertain extensively. They
have succeeded in getting an excellently
appointed annex and Hie fairer sex has
secured sufficient creature comfort . for
the souls and the bodies of all visitors..
Mrs. J. S. Emery is in charge of the
booth and B. S. Selling promises abund
ant floral decorations. â â â _â â¢
To-night Carita Chapter. O. E. S., will
give an entertainment at Masonic TempiÂ©
in Alameda in aid of the Widows' and
Orphans', fund. There , will be living
pictures, fancy dances, vocal and instru
mental solos : and glees by a ' chorus of
lifty voices. ' >'. / . ,v
Crockett Lodge has secured by tele
gram from the East a cabinet of myster

DESERTED, BUT
NOT HIS "WIFE"
Charles W. Baumann's
Friends Deny That He
Has Run Away.
Say That the Woman in the
Case Is Not Mrs. Baumann,
but Mrs. C. Hermann.
Owners of the Whaler Roaarlo Re
munerate Mate Tilton of the
Belvedere.
Charles W. Bauraann, the clgarmaker
who sailed for the Kotzebue Sound gold
fields on the bark Alaska last Friday, did j
not desert, his family, as was asserted
last Sunday by a person claiming to be
his wife. The woman Is said to be In
fatuated with the handsome ex-dealer In
prime Ilavanas, and as he left without
letting her know, his friends say she made
up the scheme of posing as a deserted
wife who was willing to face the perils
of the Arctic in order to rejoin her err
ing spouse. .
Baumann was' formerly a member of
the Pacific Coast Co-operative Cigar
Manufacturing Company, and Henry
Knobel, secretary of the company, Is with
him on the Alaska. One of Baumann's
partners told the story of his troubles
yesterday as follows:
"About two years ago Charley went to
live at the New Washington Hotel on
Fourth street, and there he met Mrs. Her
mann, wife of the manager of the place.
The woman soon became Infatuated with
him, and it ended in her deserting her
husband and trying to get Charley to
leave the hotel with her. This he posi- i
tively refused to do, and he continued
at the New Washington up to the day
he left for Kotzebue Sound on the Alaska.
"Things went from bad to worse, and j
on a couple of occasions the woman got
so insanely Jealous that she tried to kill
him, and once tried to kill herself. When
an appointment had been broken by Bau
mann I have known Mrs. Hermann to
walk up and down in front of the store
waiting for him from 7 o'clock in the
morning to 6 o'clock at, night. Then they
would make it up and all would be plain
sailing for a while.
"Fin;,.!y things came to such a pass
that Baumann had to get away. One of
the men who had bought a passage on
the Alaska could not go, so Charley quiet
ly bought his ticket and slipped away.
He never lived with Mrs. Hermann, and
the child she speaks of is her husband's.
For the sake of the little one Mr. Her
mann has several times offered to forgive
and make a home for her, but she spurned
the offers. Baumann has never been
married, so you see he could not have
deserted his wife and child."
Captain Whiteside of the Northern
Light was to have met "Mrs. Baumann"
yesterday, in order to make arrangements
"to take "her to Kotzebue Sound to Join
her husband, but she failed to keep her
appointment. She evidently knew that
as soon as her story became known the
truth of the matter would come out.
George F. Tilton, the brave mate of
the Belvedere, who brought the news
from the imprisoned whalers at Point
Barrow, is going back to Kotzebue Sound
on a gold hunting expedition. He is go
ing as mate of the bark Northern Light
to the Kubuck River. During his tramp
over the Ice and snow, Tilton learned of
a creek emptying Into the Kubuck that
is fabulously rich in free gold. That spot
he is going up on the Northern Light to
locate, and he expects to come back in a
year's time rich beyond the dreams of
avarice.
E. 11. Sheldon, Captain W. Matson and
George E. Douglas, part owners in the
whaling schooner Rosario, now in the ice
at Point Barrow, did a very graceful
thing by Mate Tilton the other day. They j
sent a note to him asking- him to call j
at Mr. Sheldon's office, and when Tilton
got there Sheldon said to him: "Mr. j
Tilton, you have brought a letter out' to j
us from the schooner Rosario on which ;
we think there Is $60 postage due. Any
how the information in that letter was j
worth $30 to us, and we think you are |
entitled to it." With that the gold pieces
were handed over to the surprised whale
man, who could hardly find words to
thank the generous owners of the schoon
er. "I did not care so much for the
money as I did for the way in which it
was given," said Tilton. "It was like
striking an oasis in the desert after the
way in which I have been treated by the
managing owner of the Belvedere."
The bark Aureola that was caught In
the recent northwester and had to put
Into Santa Cruz In distress, arrived in tow
of the tug Sea King yesterday. Several
heavy seas broke aboard her and smashed
down the poop deck, carried away the
skyllphts, smashed in the cabin doors and
gutted the cabin. She was off the Faral
lones last Thursday night, but could not
make this port owing to the heavy
weather. Captain Hughes of the Aureola
was left at Willapa sick and Captain
Merseer brought the vessel down.
Captain Harry Marshall, late of the tug
Active, has taken command of the Mon
arch, chartered by the Spreckels Tow
boat Company from the Shipowners' and
Merchants' Towboat Company. Captain
John Silovich, late of the Vigilant, takes
command of the Alert, and Captain "Joe"
Trewre* 1 of the Alert goes as mate of the
Monarc*.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
new steamer Senator had her trial trip
yesterday. She left with a large party of
the company's guests aboard and steamed
around the harbor for about four hours.
The vessel behaved splendidly and every
body had a most enjoyable time.
PROGRESSIVE SUNSET DISTRICT
Street Grading With an Abundance
of Water and Lights Promised.
A condition of general progress has
lately seized the Sunset district.
From reports received by the Improve
ment club through lta executive commit
tee, of which Edward Ewald Is the chair
man. Ninth avenue, from X to P street,
has been ordered graded and macadam-
lzed. When this and a few other streets
running in parallel lines are put in con
dition the Spring Valley Water Company
will proceed to lay its mains for the sup
plying of water to the residents. Follow
ing in the wake of this the Supervisors
have promised to have the valley supplied
with electric lights after the Ist of next
I August.
The work on the electric road over
| which the old steam dummies had been
] running for the last ten years is progrcss
| ing rapidly to a finish and will be in run- j
| ntng order by the Ist of June. When this j
| service is inaugurated the cars will run
i every ten minutes from the ferry to the
1 ocean via Fillmore, Frederick and H
streets. It Is proposed to have the cars
I of this line painted a light blue color,
I emblematic of the blue waters of the
1 great ocean to which they will convey the
â  public over a most picturesque route.
With this advancement on the more
i eastern boundary of the valley steps are
j about to be taken to open up Nineteenth
i avenue from the base of Strawberry hill
â  to the Balboa boulevard and eventually
into the Ingleside roadway.
The electric lights lately placed in Gold
en Gate Park by the Commissioners have j
given great satisfaction to the Sunset
1 ! residents.
! The sewers for which the people have
! been contending so long are in a fair way
to be in working order inside of a few
weeks now. This will undoubtedly give
an Impetus to building and otherwise set
tling the district into a handsome subur
ban place of residence.
DEAN WILL NOT HANG.
A Lenient Jury Allows Him to Es
cape With Life Imprisonment.
Charles Dean, the half-breed Chinese
who stabbed and killed Wong Yut Sing,
with whom he had been living, has been
disappointed in his hope of dying on the
scaffold. Dean pleaded guilty to mur
der in the first degree and asked to be
hanged. At the solicitation of attorneys
he withdrew his plea and was tried by
THE SAN FRAN CISCO CAL.L, WEDNESDAY, MAY 4, 1893
a jury In Judge Wallace's court. The
jury, after being out all Monday night, re
turned to court yesterday morning with
a verdict of guilty, but fixed the pen
alty at life Imprisonment. Ten of the
jurors were in favor of hanging, but
rather than have a disagreement, gave
way to the jurors who favored life im
prisonment as a penalty for the crime.

HARRY PIPER
PLACED UNDER
SUSPENSION
He May Never Return to His Desk.
Clerk Curry Says He Will
Investigate.
Piper's Losses Estimated Between $10,000
and $50,000â Borrowed From Many
Deputies.
Harry Piper has been suspended pending: an Investigation.
His suspension will continue until I have looked into the mat
ter and have ascertained the number of warrants he has hy
pothecated and to whom. I have made an examination of his
accounts and they are correct to a cent. 16c will not draw a
single dollar of salary during- his ''suspension. If I find, after
investigation, that he has done what he in charged with having
done he will never come hack. That is all I have to say on the
subject nt the present time.â Jnteiview with County Clerk Curry relative to
the misdoings of his chief deputy.
If a Spanish warship had cast a shell
into the City Hall it would probably
not have caused more surprise and
consternation than did the exclusive
publication in The Call yesterday of i
the peculiar financiering of Chief I>ep- j
uty County Clerk Harry Pipt"-. It wan j
not second as a sensation to even the j
Widbcr defalcation.
It has been no secret for the past i
few months that Piper had been play- !
ing the races heavily, and rumors had
been current of questionable manipula
tion of his warrants, but no one had
any idea of the magnitude of Piper's
operations.
It now appears from information ob- ;
tamed from one of the deputies In the ;
County Clerk's office that not only j
did Piper "blow in" his own money and
the money he wrongfully procured
from the money lenders, but he bor
rowed the salaries of a large number
of the deputies who Berved under him I
and also played and lost this money on
the ponies. It wag impossible to in
duce any of the Bufferers at the hands I
of Piper to make any statement yes
terday, as thes were ."till In hopes tlv.it !
their loans would be returned.
Piper";; losses on the race track were
variously estimated yesterday about
the City Hall to bo from $10,000 to $50;
000. It was stated that he "droi
$2000 on May W alone in one race. She
lost by a nose.
County Clerk Curry tak.es Piper's
downfall very much to heart, and was
Inclined to be very reticent in refer
ence to the matter. Late in the a.fter-

STOCKING TROUT STREAMS.
The Commissioners Are Now Giving
Attention to Yosemite Waters.
The Striped Bass.
The State Fish Commissioners have
promised local anglers that they would
possibly stock the Paper Mill. Sonoma and
ras Creeks In May or June with
large number* ot rainbow and cut-throat
trout fry. and that the stocking would
be done In o scientific and a systematic
manner.
The Commlsslomrs are now stocking the
streams of the Yosemite Valley and it la
believed that when they will have fin
ished in that quarter they will turn tholr
attention to the coast creeks, which are
badly in need of stocking, and which ase
within easy reach of the thousands of
local anglers who cannot afford the time
or expense attached to a trip to the Yo
semite.
Two years ago the Paper Mill was
stocked in a way, but it is hoped that lÂ»-;
ter Judgra< nt will be exercised this year
in the distribution of trout fry.

The Oceanic Steamship Company's Mari

finished what Captain Haywards styles
a be "our trip a day ahead of time. She
I noon, however, he made the statement 1
which opens this article.
Harry Piper declined to have any
thing further to say about the matter.

j further for him to say.

at Twenty-sixth and Douelas streets.
After spending an hour or so there he
started homeward, and when he reached

THE SAIS ITKAJVCISCO CALL, WEPXESDAY, MAY 4, 1898.
SAYS HE IS
THE SAVIOR
OF THE STATE
Huntington Pats Himself on the
Back, but Tells No
Tales.
He Artfully Dodges All Pertinent Questions
That Are Put by the Railroad
Commission
The Railroad Commissioners made
another water haul yesterday. They
cast their nets of inquiry into the
limpid depths of C. P. Huntington's
mind, and at the end of the day they
found that they had caught a choice
collection of anecdotes, reminiscences,
sparkling bits of repartee and an occa
sional chunk of advice, but the most
patient search failed to reveal a single
fact pertinent to the inquiry.
The commission wanted tcr ascertain j
the cost of the various roads of the j
Southern Pacific system and their
present value. Mr. Huntlngton was j
qufte willing that they should do so,
and expressed a desire to aid the In
quiry in every way In his power. It
would give him the greatest pleasure,
he said, to tell all he knew concerning
the cost of constructing and operating
the roads, because he wanted the peo
ple of California to understand that he
and his accociates had the interests Â«>f
the State at heart. They could not j
understand this, he thought, unless j
they were acquainted with all the facts ;
In the case.
Once or twice the proceed
ings the veteran railroad builder
showed his teeth, but he never for a
moment lost command of the situation
or allowed a word to escape his lips
that could be of the leant present or
prospective value to the members of
the commission.
At one stage of the proceedings Com
missioner Hlntcm intiniatecl that it was
the intention of himself and his col
league to protect the interests Â«f the
people of the State, and if by doing so
the interests of the Southern Pacific
Company suffered, so much the worse
for the company.
"We will locrk for Justice from the
Judicial branch of the Government,"
replied Huntingdon. "We have no fear
that our rights will be made to suffer
on account of the acts of this commis
sion."
At another time Mr. Hinton laid
claim to some considerable knowledge
<â â ( interning the building: of railroads.
"I am glad of that," retorted Uncle
Collis. "I have been building railroads
for forty years and have some slight
knowledge of the subject, but when I
want to learn something new I will
come to you."
And so it went on during the entire
day. When some question more direct
than another would be put to him
Huntlngton would coquette with it for
a moment and then branch off into
some interesting anecdote of his early
life, or would tell the commission how
impossible it would have been for Cali
fornia to have become anything more
than an unexplored wilderness If he
had not come upon the seen i in time
to save it and make its present popu
lation the happiest and most prosper
ous the sun shiner, upon.
"I am vain enough to think," he said,
"that there was no man west of the
Rocky Mountains who could have ac
complished what I have accomplished."
To which sentiment the commission
mutely assented.
"What was the original cost of all of
the properties of the Southern Pacific
Company?" was asked.
"Now, that is a hard question to an
swer," repHed the magnate. "You see,
these roads have been built in such a
way that at the present time it would
be hard for me to tell just what they
cost in dollars and cents. If there is
any way in which I can assist the
commission In arriving at some definite
conclusion I am only too willing to do
so. It is my desire to do all that I can
to help you out."
"Can you tell us what these roads
cost?"
"I think bo. At least there must be
some way of finding out. I haven't
the figures in my head, but I will do
all that I can to assist you In getting
them."
"Will you supply us with these fig
ures?"
"Yes; at least I suppose so. I pre
sume the books will show what is
wanted. I want to do all that I can
to help you out, for I appreciate tho
fact that some of the people of this
State have been misinformed as to our
motives and it will be a pleasure to
me to clear up all doubt in the matter.
I wish to be entirely frank with you."
"What are the profits derived from
the roads of the Southern Pacific sys
tem?"
"The profits? Well, you must un
derstand that such a ciuestion covers
a very wide range of Inquiry. You
know, of course, that the profits are
very small, because much of the earn
ings is expended in the betterment of
the roads. We expect that sometime
the rates will go up or the tonnage will
increase so as to give us some small
return on the money invested. I have
thouphr it hotter to put the earnings
of the road into betterments of the
propertyâ that is, to keep the property
in lirst-class shape and let the share
holders wait for their profits."
"Do you hold any of the bonds of
these roads?"
"I don't hold v single bond that came
to me from the stock issues. Of course
I own a few shares of stock that first
went to the public and were afterward
purchased by me."
"What is the average bonded in
debtedness per mile of the lines in this
State?"
"1 cannot state exactly, but It should
be easy to ascertain that fact. I sup
pose the books will shew; at least, that
is my impression."
"Clin you prtve us the present valu*
of the property?"
"I think That can ho arrived at. At
least, I will do all that I can to ascer
tain thÂ» farts, j do not wish to con~
ceal anything. "
But the aid that ho rendered consist
ed in multiplying words and kicking
up such a dnÂ«t of speculation that at
the end of tho day the Commissioners
found nol one grain of fact in all of
the chaff that had been winnowed dur
ing the loner hours of the session.
Growing tired of the profitless sub
ject of profits ar.d values, Commis
sioner La Rue, who acted as interlo
cutor tried a new tack.
"It is a fact," he said, "that the
amount of stock owned by the South
ern Pacific Company this year is
greater than last. Was this stock pur
chased out of the earnings of thÂ«
roads?"
"I am inclined to say that it was not.
I do not know where the money came
from. It came from somewhere, of
course, but just what particular ac
count it was taken from I cannot at
this moment state."
"Do you know what was paid for this
stock? "
"I cannnt say that I do. I might he
able to find out for you. but at this mo
ment I am unable to state definitely."
Two hours having been spent in this
sort of questioning on the part of the
commission and evasions on the part of
the witness an adjournment was taken
until 2 o'clock in the afternoon. Up to
this time the game had been so one
sided that it furnished very little sport
even to the spectators. At 2 o'clock La
Rue again took up his burden.
"Is it not a fact," he asked, "that the
only income-producing properties of the
Southern Pacific Company are in Cali
fornia?"
"I am inclined to think that such Is j
not the case. It Is my impression that j
! the road between Yuina and El Paso |
i is paying in some small degree, but I j
iam not sure. 1 may be able to ascer- ;
tain that fact for you. I will willingly j
do so if I can."
"Are the California roads made to j
bear the losses of the roads outside of i
the State that do not pay?"
"That is hardly a fair question. You I
: must understand that the entire sys- !
| tern is operated as a whole. We figure j
those things, you know, on the entire ;
: system and not on any individual lines
I or pieces of lines."
Being on the subject of philanthropy
! Huntingt<Â»n proceeded to pat himself on
i the back in connection with the ferry
, service and other great benefits that |
have been thrown into the lap of the!
people "f this city and State by the phi- ,
ianthroplc corporation of which he is
the guiding spirit.
"I believe the time will come," he i
i concluded, "when the people of Cali- |
; fornia will be willing to let the builders !
! of these roads get a fair return for the :
â  money that has been invested. I say j
this who ought N^ know, and I think ;
the people believe me to be an honest
; man."
This ended the profitless Inquisition
for the day. The Inquiry will be con
tinued this afternoon.

This morning at 7 o'clock the mus
tering-in of the National Guard of Cal
ifornia will begin. They are bound,
probably, for Manila.
This afternoon at 3:30 the executive
committee of the Red Cross League
and Sanitary Commission of California
holds it first meeting. It is bound, not
physically, but in imagination, for
Manila, too, In honor bound to serve
the soldiers who go to serve Uncle
Sam.
This sudden realization of the hopes
and fears of California's men and
women, this expected bugle-call to
arms, is a double appeal. It calls 5000
men to the Orient. It calls a million
men and women to humanity's Red
Cross army. It transforms civilians
into soldiers, into heroes, into martyrs.
It changes society into enthusiasts and
benefactors and saints. It is an an
swer to those who counseled the wis
dom of proceeding slowly. It is a
trumpet to those whose hearts, whose
experience, whose sympathies urged
the necessity for immediate action. It
is an announcement that the time has
come. It is an ucmlstakable sign
pointing to the duty which is nearest
â sanitary provision for the National
Guard.
The business of furthering the ob
jects for which the Red Cross League
was organized rests now in the hands
of the executive committee, to meet
this afternoon at the residence of Mrs.
John F. Merrill. 1722 Washington
street. Leaders of society, organizers
of charitable and philanthropic work,
devotees of culture and of art, physi
slcianfl, bankers, ministers and business
men are members of this committee,
California has entrusted with the care
and comfort of her soldiers.
To-day will see this remarkable as
semblage working earnestly and faith
fully, appointing committees, sys-
tematlzing plans for filling its ex
chequer, pointing out the way for the
willing hands and hearts whose best
efforts have been placed at the com
) mission's disposal.
Offers of aid of all kinds continue to
pour in upon these busy people, who
have given and will continue to give
till peace is declared, the heart of their
day, full to overflowing, to humanity's
cause. Among the latest, Jennie V/ard
Hayes, the poet and musician, offers
the sale of the patriotic songs she has
composed. There is a hall. Mayor Phe
lan says, In the City Hall, which is at
the services of the lecturers who desire
to labor for the Red Cross. The
Sorosis Club donates the use of its
rooms and will be* among the many
clubs and societies to enlist under
Humanity's Banner. All of those who
have vr.'.unteersd for the Red Cross
army will be accepted. There is no
possibility of failure to pass. All one
requires is loyalty and generosity.
And when did California lack either of
these great qualifications?
But the work must be swift now and
sure. Our men leave In a week, in
ten days, in a fortnight, according to
various rumors. Whatever the term
may be it is the intention of California's
Sanitary Commission to do all that lies
in its power to hurry on the creation
of its various committees, the swelling
of its bank account, the outfitting of its
depot of supplies. What Dr. Hopkins,
surgeon-general of the State, calls an
"excellent peace footing" shall be
changed into a sturdy war basis, or
Callfornian and unstinted liberality will
no more be synonymous terms.
The first thing to be done is to at
tack that $9000 deficit, which makes the
Sanitary Corps look grave when the
anticipated orders to the Philippines
are mentioned. "Charity begins at
home," quotes an experienced surgeon
of the corps.

TO KEEP OUT
EASTERN MARBLE
Employer and Employe Join
Hands in a Struggle
for Life.
Competition Threatens to Crush Out
a Big California In
dustry.
The membprs of the local Marble Cut
ters' and Polishers' Union have a hard
fight on their hands to keep out Eastern
goods and Incidentally avoid a reduction
of from 23 to 50 per cent In their wages.
The fight against Eastern and foreign
goods has been on for a long time, and
recently the members of the union de
cided not to handle any goods cut outside
the State.
A committee from the union has worked
hard among architects and builders to
have clauses Inserted In the contracts to
the effect that only marble cut In this
State be used in construction. In some
cases they have been succesful. but In
many others they have failed, as the work
of the Eastern firms is done largely by
prison labor, and In many cases women
and children do a good deal of the work
for a mere pittance. This competition Is
gradually killing the local enterprises,
and the men have been notified that if
they cannot keep the work inside the
State wages will be reduced from 25 to 50
per cent, or to the wages paid by Eastern
competitors. If on the other hand they
are succcssiul there will be a correspond
ing increase.
In speaking of the matter last night a
member of the union said: "We have
practically Leen requested by our em
ployers to" build a fence around the State
of California to keep the work here, and
H our business people could only be in
duced to open their eyes and show a lit
tle patriotism we could do It. At present
the wages here are none too good, but
we realize the position of our employers
and the ciass of labor they are forced to
compete with. Our home merchants are
constantly raising the cry of "patronize
home industries and keep the muney
here," yet as soon as one of them start's
to erect a building he will let the con
tracts go to Cincinnati, Chicngo or any
where else to save $50. The result of this
Is a stagnation at present in our business
which threatens to drive the marble in
dustry out of the State.
"The marble cutters here are as good
workmen as can be found anywhere, but
they won't stay In the city and subsist on
two or three days' work in the week. Out
of my own acquaintance I can count
twenty men who have left the city with
in the past three months, simply because
San Francisco work was going East and
they went East to do it. L,ast week two
of my shopmntes sailed for Italy. A con
tract for a big piece of marble for a
church now being erected in this city was
lot in Italy. If they get there soon enough
perhaps they will get a chance to do
some work on it, and spend in Europe the
money they would otherwise have spent"
here.
"None of our men will handle any mar
ble cut outside- the State and the propri
etors will refuse to sell to any contractor
who lets his contract outside and happens

$1000 to Academy of Sciences'
Publication Fund.
A resolution was passed at the meeting
of the Academy of Sciences on Monday
thanking President C. P. Huntingdon of
the Southern Pacific Company for a dona
tion of $1000 to the society. It was read

Whereas. Realizing that the publications of
the Academy are the most important feature
of Its work and that they take rank among
the best scientific Journals of this country ana
Europe, and
Whereas, That in !ts effort to print all the pa
pers presented which are worthy of publica
tion, the society Is constantly hampered by the
lnrulp'iuacy of the funds at Its disposal, an ap
peal was made to Mr. C. P. Huntington, who,
without the slightest hesitation, generously
subscribed the sum of one thousand dollar*
toward the publication fund; therefore, be It
KMorrcd, That the California Academy of
Sciences, appreciating the generosity of Mr.
Huntington, hereby tenders him its sincere
thanks; and be It further

Difference Between Animals and Plants?"
Church Steps on Fire.
A small blaze with but little damage
took place yesterday at Olivet Presby
terian Church on Nineteenth avenue and
Mississippi street, in South San Francisco.
It was caused by some children playing
"war" with matches ,and explaining to
each other how Commodore Dewey cap
tured Manila.

Doctors
Don't like us!
Druggists
Don't like us !
WHY?
Because we give no commissions, but
save that half of price of prescriptions
to you. Because we sell the best goods
for less money than others. Because
we expose a system of robbery that we
think the public should know about^
the giving and taking of commissions
by some druggists and some doctors.
While we have thus Incurred the
enmity of the commission druggists,
and a few doctors, we have made
friends of physicians who do not ac-
cept commission and of the public who
do not want to be robbed.
