STUBBED TO
THE HEART
Terrible Deed Con)n)itted
by an Italian at Geneva,
Switzerland.
One of the Most Popular and Be
loved Women in Europe Ruth
lessly Cut Down by an
Assassii}.
GENEVA, Switzerland, Sept. 10.â The Empress of
Austria was assassinated near the Hotel Beaurivage this
afternoon by an anarchist named Luigi Laochini, who
was arrested. He stabbed her Majesty with an instru
ment supposed to be a triangular file.
It appears that her Majesty was walking from her
hotel to the landing place of the steamer at about 1
o'clock when an Italian anarchist suddenly approached
and stabbed her to the heart. The Empress fell, got up
again and was carried to the steamer unconscious.
The boat started, but seeing the Empress had not recov
ered consciousness the captain returned and the Em
press was carried to tne notei tseaurivage, where she
expired.
The stretcher upon which the Em- |
pr'-M whp carried to the hotel was hast- \
ily improvised with oars and sail cloth. I
Doctors and priests were immediately '
summoned and a telegram was sent to
Emperor Francis Joseph.
All efforts to revive her Majesty were
unavailing, and she expired at 3 o'clock. ;
The rrjedtcal examination shows that ,
the assassin must have us%d a small ,
triangular file. The wound was just
over the left breast. There was hardly
any bleeding.
Aft^r striking the blow he ran along
the Rue dcs Alpes, with the evident in
tention of entering the Square Les
Alpes, but before reaching it he was
seized by two cabmen who had wit
nessed the crime. They handed him
over to a boatman and a gendarme,
who conveyed him to the police sta
tion.
The prisoner made no resistance. He
even sang as he walked along, saying,
"I diil it," and "She must be dead."
At the police station he declared that
he was a â¢starving anarchist, with no
hatred for the poor, but only for the
rich."
Later, when taken to the courthouse
and interrogated by a magistrate in
the presence of three members of the
local government and the police offi
cials, he pretended not to know French,
ar.d refused to answer questioi.s. The
police, on searching him, lound a docu
ment showing his name to be Luigi
Laochinl, born in Paris in 1874, and an
Italian soldier.
A great crowd quickly assembled
around the Hotel Beaurivage, where
the officials proceeded after interrogat
ing the prisoner. The police searched
the scene of the crime for- the weapon
and the accomplices of the assassin.
It appears that a boatman noticed
three persons closely following the Em
press, who was making purchases in
the shops.
The local government, immediately
on receiving the news of her MajeÃty's
death, half-masted the flag on the
Hotel de Ville, the municipal office, and
proceeded in a body to the Hotel Beau
rivage as a token of respect. The shops
on the Kursaal were closed.
The assassin told the magistrate that
he came to Geneva In order to assassi
nate "another important person," but
h; d been unable to execute the project.
The reason of his failure he did not
give, but he declared that it was only
by accident he had learned of the pres
ence of the Austrian Empress in Ge
neva.
The assassin, on being interrogated
by the magistrate, said he came to
Geneva with the intention of killing
the Due d'Orleans, but the latter had
already left. He foKowed the Due to
Evian, about 25 miles north of Geneva,
on the lake, where he was again un
successful. He then returned to Gene
va and learned of the arrival of the
Empress. Yesterday he dogged her
footsteps, but found no opportunity to
carry out his purpone, though he
watched the Hotel Beaurivage all day.
This afternoon about half past 1
o'clock, he said, he saw the valet of the
Empress leaving the hotel and going
toward the landing. He inferred from
this that the Empress "vas going to
take the steamboat and he hid him
self behind a tree on the quay with the
knife concealed in his rigkt hand. In
v f*w minutes the Empress, accompa
nied by her lady of honor, appeared
and the assassin struck the knife home.
Urn coalesced that he has jeen an an

archlst since he was 13 years of age.
"If all anarchists did their duty as
I have done mine," he said, "bourgeoise
society would soon disappear."
He admitted that he" knew the crime
was useless, but said he committed It
for "the sake of example.''
In spite ' of minute searching, the
weapon of the murderer has not been
found. Dense crowds still surround
the Hotel Beaurivage this evening.
SWISS OFFICIALS
HORRIFIED BY THE
FEARFUL CRIME
BERNE, Switzerland, Sept. 10.âAn
other account of the assassination of
the Empress of Austria says: After
having been stabbed from behind the
Empress rose and walked on board the
steamer, where she fell fainting. The
captain did not wish to put off from the
quay, but did so at the request of the
Empress and her suite, there being no
apprehension that she was seriously
hurt. The steamer was turned back,
however, before it reached the open
lake, and the Empress, unconscious,
was carried to the hotel on a stretcher.
The Empress had been stopping at the
Hotel Beaurivage for several days.
The President of Switzerland , and
other members of the Government were
stunned with horror and grief when the
news reached the palace that the Em
press, so beloved by all Europeans, had
fallen a victim to an assassin within
the borders of their country. They im
mediately arranged to hold an extraor
dinary Federal Council on Sunday
morning in order to consider the meas
ures to take against the assassin.
The latter must be tried according to
the statutes of the Canton, which for-
bid capital punishment, and makes life
Imprisonment the most severe penalty
which can be imposed. When the Aus
trian Minister, Count Kuerfstein, was
Informed of the tragedy, he hurried to
the palace and was met with expres
sions of the utmost sympathy. So soon
as a special train could be arranged the
Minister started for Geneva, accom
panied by the Deputy Prosecutor Gen
eral, who took up the case at once, his
chief being on a vacation. He will hold
a preliminary inquiry at Geneva to
night or as soon as possible, and re
turn to-morrow in order to report to
the federal council.
The federal authorities had been in
formed of the visit of the Empress,
and they notified the Governors of the
Canton the Empress expected to visit,
instructing them to take special po
lice measures for her comfort and safe
ty if it appeared necessary. They were
not notified of her Majesty's intention
to visit Geneva, nor were the local of
ficials there aware of her presence, as
she was traveling incognito. The po
lice are not blamed, though the circum
stances responsible for the lack of pre
cautions are widely regretted. All
Switzerland is profoundly stirred with
sorrow and indignation. The papers in
all the cities have printed extra edi
tions expressing horror of the crime.
INDESCRIBABLE
GRIEF OVERPOWERS
AUSTRIA'S PEOPLE
VIENNA, Sept. 10.â The news of the
assassination became known here
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 11; 1898â THIRTY-TWO PAGES.
EMPRESS ELIZABETH OF AUSTRIA, THE VICTIM OF AN ANARCHIST ASSASSIN.
shortly before 6 o'clock. It spread like
lightning. The streets were suddenly
filled with multitudes of people, many
of them becoming impassable for vehi
cles.
Extra editions were issued by all the
papers. Many Viennese considered the
report incredible until the semi-official
Wiener Abend Post appeared, confirm
ing the statements of the other papers.
All the papers accompanied the an
nouncement with warm tributes to the
Empress. They were eagerly snatched
from the hands of the sellers and were
read aloud to groups of citizens.
An Indescribable grief overpowers the
the people. The performances at the
court theatres and the jubilee exhibi
tion have been canceled.
Emperor Francis Joseph received the
news at Schoenbruhn. His Majesty's
journey to attend the maneuvers at
Zips, Hungary, was, of course, aban
doned.
All the theaters here and in the pro
vincial towns are closed.
The extra edition of the Weiner
Abend Post appeared with black bor
ders. It expresses the universal sorrow
felt at the loss of the noble Empress,
whose life was one long case of philan
throphy, adding: "She had gone
abroad in order to obtain fresh strength
but only to become the victim of a
wicked and mad attack."
It concludes with an expression of
"sincere sympathy with the Emperor,
upon whose beloved head such grief
has fallen in the year of his jubilee."
THOUGHT A THIEF
HAD ASSAILED HER
PARIS, Sept. 11.â The Figaro states
that the weapon used by the assassin
of the Empress of Austria was found
in the lake. It was a three-sided file,
very slender and sharp. The postmor
tem examination showed one almost
imperceptible wound, the file having 1
penetrated the heart and not causing
exterior bleeding. The Empress, it
seems, only supposed that she had re
ceived a violent blow. At first she
maintained great coolness. When asked
if she wished to return to the hotel she
replied: "No; he only struck me on the
breast and doubtless wished to steal
my watch."
The assassin made a complete con
fession, adding that he regrets that the
death penalty does not exist in the,
Canton where the tragedy occurred.
The Geneva police believe that they
are on the track of two accomplices of
the assassin.
FEARS FOR THE EFFECT
ON FRANCIS JOSEPH
LONDON, Sept. 10.â Grave fearÃ are
expressed here regarding the effect
which the assassination of the Empress
of Austria may have upon the Em
peror, whose health has never recov
ered from the blow of Crown Prince
Rudolph's tragic death. It is known
that hiÃ Majesty has been very feeble
of late.
GREAT SENSATION AT
THE FRENCH CAPITAL
LONDON, Sept. 11.â A special dis-
patch to the Sunday Times from Paris
says: The assassination of the Em
press Elizabeth of Austria has created
an immense sensation in the French
capital, where the sympathy of the
people is all the greater because it is
remembered that her sister, the
Duchess D'Alencon, perished in the ter
rible charity bazaar fire last year. Her
other sister, the former Queen of Na
ples, has resided in Paris since the
death of her husband, and the mur
dered Empress was a frequent visitor
here and familiar to Parisians. Sym
pathetic crowds gathered near the Aus
trian Embassy soon after the sad news
began to spread through the city.
The Vienna correspondent of the Ob
server says: When Count Goluchow
skl, the Austro-Hungari&n Foreign
Minister, communicated the news to
the Emperor the latter sank speechless
into a chair and remained for a long
time motionless. The remains of th*
Empress will be brought to Vienna at
once for a state funeral. The Emperor
Is reported to have said: "Shall I not
be freed from grief and pain In this
world?"
M'KINLEY'S MESSAGE

lowing message has been received at

PARIS, Sept. 11.â The Figaro pub
lishes this morning the following from
Geneva: The Tribune de Geneva pub
lished an interview with M. Teisset,
a merchant member of the Chamber
of Commerce at Clermont-Ferrand,
who was an eyewitness of the death
scene of the Empress Elizabeth of
Austria. Accompanied by a party be
went on board the steamer at Geneva
at 20 minutes to 2 o'clock p. m.
He was exchanging a few words
with the captain on deck when a lady
came forward, walking with difficul
ty and supported by another lady. M.
Teisset, without knowing who the
lady was, took her in his arms, carried
her across the deck and seated her on
a bench. The lady then opened her
eyes and gave him a look of grati
tude. M. Teisset left the boat and re
turned to the Hotel Beaurivage. A
short time afterward messengers came
up shouting that the steamer had re
turned and a misfortune happened.
M. Teiaset ran to ask Dr. Golay to
go to the landing 1 stage as his services
would profoably be required. Captain
Roux had already given all attention
to the Empress, who was accompanied
only by one lady In waiting and a
servant.
Gebel, the pilot of the boat, had cut
the stays of the Empress and found a
very small wound only one centimeter
In width above the left breast from
which issued only two or three drops
of blood.
The lady in waiting asked the Em
press, who for a moment regained con
sciousness, "Are you suffering?"
The reply was "No."
Captain Roux then brought the ves
sel around and made straight for the
landing place. Gebel had a litter al
ready prepared of two bars, four camp
stools and velvet cushions. The Em
press was laid upon it and carried to
the Hotel Beaurivage by Captain
Roux, M. Teisset and two of the crew.
M. Teisset carried her Majesty in his
arms up the stairs to her apartment on
the first floor, which she had just left,
and laid her on a bed.
Dr. Golay, assisted by M. Teisset and
the lady in waiting, and also by a nurse
who was in the hotel, rapidly undressed
her Majesty and endeavored to induce
artificial respiration by friction and
the application of eau de cologne and
vinegar.
All efforts, however, were in vain.
Golay sent for Dr. Mayer, who has
tened to the hotel at the request of
the lady In waiting. A slight incision
was made in the patient's right wrist,
but all was over in a short time.
Before her Majesty's death a par
ish priest had come and administered
extreme unction. Everything possible,
humanly speaking, was done. The
body was laid out by Mme. Mayer.
M. Teisset believes the Empress
breathed her last at the moment he
laid her head on the bed. When her
Majesty's death was announced all
present knelt down in prayer.
The murderer has finally given some
explanation regarding the crime. He
says he came to Geneva to assassinate
some high personage, and he added
that he chiefly had in view the Due
d'Orleansâ probably Prince Henriâ but
he could not put his scheme into^exe
cution for reasons which he does not
give. It was quite by chance that he
heard that the Empress of Austria was
in Geneva.
HAD PREMONITIONS THAT
HER END WAS NEAR
Became a Changed Woman Since the
Suicide of Her Son
Rudolph.
Of late Empress Elizabeth had fallen
upon the idea that her end was near
and that she would soon die. Since the
death of her son Rudolnh she has built
memorial chapels and monuments
throughout the empire, and thes"e she
visited from time to time as the fancy
seized her.
Her latest employment in this line
was to arrange for her final resting
place at great expense. She had built
at Corfu, upon plans approved by her
self, a magnificent villa, and had chris
tened it "L'Achilleion." To her will she
added a codicil in which she said:
"I wish to be interred at Corfu, near
the sea, so that the waters can con
tinually break on my tomb."
Empress Elizabeth was the daughter
of Maximilian Joseph, Duke of Bavarfa.
She was born December 24, 1837, and
wedded the Emperor in 1854.
For five years, since the tragic sui
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
cide of Prince Rudolph, heir to the
crown of the Hapsburgs, Empress
Elizabeth had been failing both in body
and mind. The decay was so slow as
to be almost imperceptible at ttrst. It
was shown to have grown out of her
grief for the tragic death of her only
son. But the outbreaks of the Em
press and had of late passed the bounds
mere eccentricity, and it was necessary
to keep her in a sense under surveil
lance. She was not crossed or inter
fered with. Her whims were not no
ticed seriously, albeit they were some
times expensive, and she did practically
as she pleased. None the less, she was
lovingly watched and guarded.
Ten years ago the Empress was still
one of the most beautiful women in
Europe, just as her husband, Francis
Joseph, was one of the handsomest men
of his years to be found anywhere. The
Empress was then one of the best
horsewomen of her time. She surprised
even the daring cross-country riders of
England and Ireland when she visited
those countries by her grace, courage
and dash. Of late she was but a
wreck of her former self. Sbe lost her
high spirits, shunned the companion
ship of former favorites and spent her
time in mourning and brooding over the
pasv.
The case of Empress Elizabeth is
markedly pathetic. It may truthfully
be said of her that she was a good
woman, 'Who had done her duty since
she shared with her husband the ruling
of Austria-Hungary. When they were
married it was said of the royal, bride
groom and bride that they were the
handsomest couple in Europe. He was
(as he is still) broad-shouldered and
tall, handsome and frank of face, and
as courteous as a knight of old. She
was fair, vivacious, brilliant in conver
sation, and at the same time with the
dignity of a Queen.
Many changes have occurred since
the marriage of the Princess Elizabeth
to the ruler of Austria, and some of
these have been such as to sadden the"
lives of the Austrian Emperor and Em
press. First the favorite brother of the
Emperor married a dancer. Stripped of
his honors and offices, he bought a mer
chant vessel â he had been trained for
the nayy â and, taking his bride with
him, started in to make his own living
by trading. His ship is supposed to
have gone down at sea. At any rate it
disappeared, and the Archduke is still
among the missing. Then came the hu
miliation of Austria by Germany, and
the Maximilian episode, and finally the
tragedy in which Prince Rudolph
figured. All of these things have served
to make Francis Joseph a melancholy,
much broken man, and the effect upon
his wife has been much more severe.
Even the influence of her husband, who
was devoted to her, and her one mar
ried daughter, the Princess Valeric,
were lost upon her.
About ten years ago, when Empress
Elizabeth became infatuated with the
English sport of fox-hunting, she was
a striking woman in appearance. She
looked much younger than she really
was, and she created a furore in Eng
land. She spoke English like a native,
was unconventional, cordial in manner
and witty. She speedily became popu
lar. Following the hounds was a pas
sion with her. The Empress of Aus
tria was a familiar figure on the hunt
ing field, and, to use a sporting expres
sion, she rode straight. Thefle was no
fence or hedge too high, and no ditch
or water Jump too broad for her. In
her first season she won more praises
for her good riding and her pluck than
for her accomplishments as Empress of
Austria.
In her own court Empress Elizabeth
always displayed these same amiable
qualities. In no court in Europe is eti
quette more strict, in none are the
nobles more proud or more jealous of
their rights and privileges. Even Fran
cis Joseph, an amiable, easy-going
man, has been bound as with hooks of
steel to all the old rules and traditions
of the Hapsburgs, the "Austrian
Caesars," as they proudly call them
selves. Empress Elizabeth showed that
she was able to ride roughshod over
old fogy traditions and unwritten rules.
But she did this with such tact, so
quietly, and yet so thoroughly, that the
old court favorites that had ruled the
roost prior to the coming of the clever
young Empress scarcely knew how it
was that they graduallly fell to the
rear and left their places to be filled
by another coterie younger, more lib
eral, more brilliant and more in accord
with the tastes of the Empress.
The young woman went further. The
old court at Vienna had been more cor
rupt than any other in Europe. It was
a hotbed of scandal. Royal names had
been smirched, and even that of the
Emperor himself was not free from
scandal. The young Empress set her
self to the task of working out re
form in this direction. It was a diffi
cult task. Indeed, itlwas one in which
she could hope to suaceed only In part.
But she accomplished* more than it had
been thought she would, and she made
the court at Vienna more healthy as to
morals than it had ever been in the
past. "What is more, she enlisted good
natured, easy-goinsr Francis Joseph in
her work. He, perhaps, had no real
interest in it or sympathy for it. But
he loved his clever wife with a deep
and abiding love that has never waver
ed and that still abides.
Yet it seems a sort of tragic out- "2

purify the Austrian court that there
Bhould still have existed a condition

TrrÂ« broke the Empress" heart. The
Empress had been ambitious for her
son. She believed be had great abilities
obscured and undeveloped by a life of
pleasure in youth that would be put in
evidence later. Later she saw the weak
Archduke Charles, heir to the throne,
shrink from th" position that awaited
him and transfer his right to the Aus
trian throne to his son, Francis, who is
now destined to be the next Emperor of
Austria.
All these things seared deeply the
heart of the proud and ambitious Em
pri ss. Those who have seen the Em
press recently Bay that she was white
haired, bent and pitiably broken,
though she was yet far from being an
old woman. She took part in court cere
monies in a perfunctory manner. It
was easy to see that she considered her
n life broken.
Perhaps the best side of the charac
ter of Emperor Francis Joseph was
never before so admirably shown as in
his tender, loving guardianship of his
stricken consort. Were she still the
young Empress whose beauty and
grace all Europe once admired, her
husband could not have be*Â»n more
painstaking and thoughtful In looking
to her comfort.
It was necessary to watch the Em
press closely. Her moods were change
able, and each recurring remembrance
of her unfortunate son led to some out
break, if such an expression may be
used. It might be at midnight and in
a storm when the humor would seize
her t j go and pray in the little chapel
where Prince Rudolph's remains are
laid. The Emperor's orders were that
she must have her way in these whims,
and she had careful attendants wait on
her until thÂ«=se fits of morbid melan
cholia passed over and she became her
self again.
On other occasions she would take a
fancy for journeys into the interior,
and on these occasions a special car
would be prepared, acompanied by offi
cials and attendants, and she would
travel until this fit. too, was spent.

MANILA, Sept. 10.â Persistent ru
mors are in circulation that the idea
of attacking the city is gaining
strength among the rebels, and it is as
serted that some of the leaders are
boldly urging such a plan. Owing to
these reports . General Otis has been
taking precautions to prevent the pos
sibility of such a rising. He has dis
patched strong detachments of Ameri
can troops to occupy strategic posi
tions in the suburbs.
The work of disarming the Filipinos
is being carried on with even greater
energy than before in view of new de
velopments. I do not think, however,
that any attack by Filipinos is prob
able. Such a course at this time, when
the fate of the Philippines will soon be
a subject of discussion at the Paris
conference, would be suicidal. Any at
tack the rebels onuld make with the
forces they could muster now would
be almost certain to be ineffective.
Aguinaldo, despite his efforts to for
tify the position he has assumed as
"dictator," Is beyond doubt losing con
trol over the lawless spirits among the
natives.
The residents of Manila are not at all
alarmed over the intentions of the
rebels. The administration of General
Merrltt prior to his departure for Paris
and the course taken by General Otis
since he has assumed command have
convinced the Inhabitants of Manila
that they can live in complete security
under the protection of the Americans.
OTIS HAS SUFFICIENT
TROOPS FOR HIS NEEDS

NEW YORK, Sept. 10.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Further advices from Major General
Otis shoVing that he is able with his
present force to cope with Aguinaldo
and his forces in case of emergency has
convinced the authorities that there is
no present need of sending reinforce
ments. A dispatch was sent by the
War Department to-day to the Gov
ernor of a Northern State explaining
that in view of present advices there is
no need of the dispatch of additional
troops to Manila,
The department, however, has deter
mined to be prepared, and, therefore,
will execute its plan of stationing a
strong body of troops at Honolulu.
A clerk of the department will ac
company the commission as disbursing
agent, and a number of stenographers
and translators in the employ of the
State Department will be assigned to
duty with the commission.
Neither the ftate Department nor the
French embassy had any information
to-day bearing on the report that the
Madrid Government had directed the
French embassy to make a protest to
the State Department at the action of
the military forces in capturing Manila
after an armistice had been declared.

of the intention of the Spanish Govern

little consideration, however, in view of
many precedents which history fur

The authorities appreciate, however,

GENERAL OTIS CHECKS
PHILIPPINE REBELS
NEW YORK, Sept. 10.â A Sun spe
cial from Manila says: The Spanish
have been endeavoring to provoke a
conflict, telling the Filipinos that the
Americans intend to return the islands
to Spain. Many Filipinos believe and
think the Americans' intend to re-es
tablish Spanish power. There has been
much kidnaping, robberies, assaults,
etc. The perpetrators generally were
insurgents in uniform. Information
reached the American authorities that
the Spanish were inciting trouble be
tween the insurgents and Americans.
General Otis determined to stop this
equivocal situation and notified Agui
naldo that the insurgents must with
draw before a fixed date, or he will
use force, as they cannot occupy ter
ritory surrendered to Americans while
not recognized as allies.
A Filipino councilor close to Agui
naldo informed your correspondent that
the insurgents would insist upon re
ceiving assurance of recognition even
at the cost of a conflict with Americans.
The uselessness of such a course beipg
explained to him, he replied: "We can
only die."
Aguinaldo himself said to your cor
respondent yesterday: "When the re
bellion started independence was the
Eole idea of the Filipinos. Since the
Americans have been forced to inter
fere the Filipinos hope to gain some
reward from Americans for their sac
rifices of blood, life and treasure. They
live for the recognition of their lib-
erty."
This is the first public admission
from Aguinaldo that the Filipinos
â¢would be satisfied with anything less
than absolute independence.

PETTY REVENGE OF
A LOS ANGELES PAPER.
Refuses to Support Gage to Get
Even on Some Personal
Enemies.
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 10.â The Dally
Times of this city will to-morrow, under
the heading, "An Initial Mistake," print
the following editorial:
The best and most loyal friends of
Henry T. Gage, Republican nominee for
Governor, note with pained surprise that
he has entered the camp of the enemy to
select his political lieutenants from Los
Angeles, in appointing W. F. X. Parker,
a particularly offensive "push" politician,
and H. Z. Osborne, whose Southern Pa
cific record is notorious, as members of
the executive committee of the Republi
can State Central Committee.
The people of Southern California re
member .or It happened not so long ago
that they have been enabled to forget it)
that W. F. X. Parker, then clerk of the
Mayor of Los Angeles, railroaded through
the City Council a resolution In favor of
Mr. Huntington's private harbor at Santa
Monica and caused it to be telegraphed to
Washington. And they do not forget thai
It was in the office of the Evening Ex
press, then edited and managed by H. Z.
Osborne, that certain bogus petitions were
prepared and sent to Washington in the
interest of the private enterprise of Mr.
Huntington in opposition to the will ot
the people of this section and in contra
vention of the public interests of the na
tion.
Remembering these things, the friends
and admirers of Mr. Gage cannot but
wonder how it is that the Republican
nominee for Governor should have forgot
ten them, and why he should have gone
out of his way to exalt as his campaign
managers two men, at least, who are
known to be subservient tonls and active
allies of the Southern Pacific Company
of Kentucky.
It would 'surely have been possible to
have found among the thousands of vo
ters in Los Angeles County two Repub
li> ans, other than Parker and Osborne, in
whom the gubernatorial nominee might
have reposed his confidence, without giv
ing a slap in the face to the mass of the
people who know these two worthies for
what they really are â remnants
of that Lindleylsm in Los An
geles which the people some time
ago crushed out, as they fondly hoped,
for all time, but which by this recognition
of these two Llndley henchmen has been
galvanized into a semblance of life for the
time being. As is well known, Osborne.
and Parker were cheek by jowl with Her
vey Llndley while the latter was "doing
politics" In Los Angeles, and each of
them was ever ready to do the bidding of
that small boss and his greater boss, the
Southern Pacific Company.
The Times has no ambition to dictate
nor any desire to even suggest whom Mr. I
Oage shall appoint as his political Ueu
tenants and managers, but it does be
lieve that he should not have gone out
or his way to select men who discredited
nis campaign before its commencement.
The claim is being made adroitly by the
Democratic press that the Republican
ticket this year is a "railroad ticket,"
and Mr. Gage, when he deliberately ap
points two pronounced henchmen of the' !
boutnern Paciiic as his campaign mana- :
gers, lends positive strength to that ;
claim and disarms the faithful friends ;

does not recognize a blunder when it
meets the thing meandering along the
street.
It is clearly evident that Mr. Gage has
been imposed upon by his advisers and

that he has done something in making
these appointments which his friends will
have to made explanations of and apolo
gies for from now until- the day of elec
tion, and if disaster to his cause shall re
sult from this deplorable act, Mr. Gage
and the men who have counseled him to
do this thing alone are to blame.
If Mr. Gage can win his election with
such handicaps as these he will certainly
achieve a victory that will be memorable;
in the political history of the State of Cal- ;
As for the Times, it "will not sit passive
and refrain from protesting when such
acts as these are done; it will not compro
mise with the enemy, and it will not be
gagged by friend or foe. It is to the in
terest cf the Republicaan party" and to
the interest of the State that the
bosses and corruptionists Âbe . de
nounced and their sins made
so plain to the people that they who run
may read, and so long as there are ink
and presses in this establishment the
Times will, prepared for any sacrifice, if
sacrifice be necessary, continue to stand
for the right with a stout heart and a
bold front, leaving to time the vindica
tion of its course.
If a friend be ground between the up
Â§er and the nether millstones of its con
emnation, however much we may regret
it, It is a misfortune for which we de
cline to accept the responsibility. Mr.
Gage's mistake is his and that of his po
litical advisers, and, as already said,
there the onus must remain if disaster to
the Republican cause shall result.

CONFLAGRATION RAGING
IN THE CAPITAL CITY
SACRAMENTO. Sept. 11â Fire broke
out at 2 o'clock this morning in the rear
of Schad Bros.' livery stable on X street,
between Fifth and Sixth. It rapidly
spread to W. S. Frazer's branch lumber
yard, and at this hour (2:30 o'clock) the
stable, lumber yard and several adjoining
dwellings are burning fiercely.
The first alarm was followed by a gen
eral alarm and soon the city's entire fire
department was fighting the flames.
The scene of the fire is one of the busi
ness blocks, and the conflagration is hard
to fight
At this hour the guests of the Berkshire
lodging house, whence this message is be
ing sent by telephone, are packing their
effects preparatory to fleeing before the
advance of the flames, which threaten to
reach the building unless they are soon
checked.
Many of the horses in Schad Bros. 1 sta
ble, which was an expensive affair, have
been Incinerated. The loss, if the blaze
could be checked where it is now, would
exceed $15,000, and the Indications are it
will be several times that amount before
the flames are got under control.
STATE FAIB'S SUCCESS.

night of the first week of the State Fair

concentrating the people in one end of
the hall, somewhat to the detriment of
the exhibitors elsewhere in the building.
However, this objection doubtless will
not be urged next week, when the at
tendance will be so large as to insure
more even distribution throughout the
building.
Happily the board of agriculture has
done away with the traditional ceremony
of having an annual address delivered,
wh.ch formerly had the effect of making
some public notable realize the impotency
of oratory when in conflict with a brass
band and skirt dance elsewhere in the
building.

this c!ty and Charles Turner of Stockton
fought a 15-round draw at the Pavilion
to-night before a large crowd. The

Turner displayed the most science, but
his antagonist was heavier and a glut

JELLISONS SUCCESSOR.
F. B. Graves Will Probably Be Ap-
pointed Librarian to Fill the
Existing Vacancy.
A larfee number of members attended
the regular quarterly meeting- of the
Mechanics' Institute last evening. Presi
dent DÂ«-nicke spoke of the death of the
librarian, A. M. Jellison. He tnen had
the resolutions of respect adopted to his
memory by the board of trustees read.
The vacancy in the board caused by the
resignation of Charles D. Steiger was
fllled by the election of J. P. Fraser.
. Considerable discussion was had over
the policy of holding an industrial ex
position next year. A majority of tha
member.s were in favor of such an affair,
and a resolution was adopted to that
end.
Trustee Horace Wilson offered an
amendment to the constitution affecting
the manner of electing trustees. If
adopted at the next quarterly meeting it
will do away with the present method of
voting. A. W. Stott asked what had been
done toward appointing a new librarian,

That popular Coon Song, *
"I Don't Like No Cheap
Man," that's being sung at
the Orpheum, hits a little
subject that we want to
talk to you about.
Now, nobody likes a cheap
man or, what we mean, a
cheap-looking man, and
clothes are what give ap-
pearance. Clothes may
not make a man alto-
gether, but they have a
heap to do with itâ espe-
cially the kind of clothes
you get from Raphael's.
They're the kind that have
snap, life, vimâ the niceties
of fine tailoring, the ad-
vanced and modern ideas
of modern tailoring. These
are yours, and you'll never
look like a cheap man if
Raphael's dress you. She'll
admire you. So will he.
He'll be more than anxious
to know where you got your
clothes, because the kind
we have shine out â quite
different from those of
other stores, because we
put all our own ideas, the
progressive ones, into our
clothes.
A Serge Suit like this is the
essence of refinement and good
taste.

the spread.
As the hours passed the ladies turned
out in greater numbers, until those in
charge of the affair estimated that as
many of the fair sex were in attend
ance as there were of the men. The
girls came singly and in couples, trios
and finally in bevies, disdaining the es
cort of their brothers, intent only on
sharing in the feast. From the adja
cent country, too, people came. Farm
ers and their wives with waeons filled
with native sons and daughters drove
in and mingled with those already on
the scene.
The good humor that prevailed be
came infectious in an incredibly short
time. People arrived on the grounds al
most overcome from the exertions of
yesterday, away short on sleep, raven
ous and intent only on getting to the
nearest table. Before they reached the
dancing platform all their cares were
forgotten, the after effects of yester
day vanished, and instead of com
plaints because they had to wait they
found pleasure in standing around
commenting on the activity of their
more fortunate fellows at the tables,
who, by the way, were altogether too
busy to essay more than a facial con

time of it for a while. He managed to
get filled up, however, after a com
pound of the tables â there were no
less than thirty of them. But Curry had
the prize appetite. The other three
fared better. Harry was short on beef,

but never refusing a rib, provided said
rib was well laden with meat.
Incidents like these were numerous,

staffs, drove to the Palace. They were j
formally presented to the Spanish com

FRENCH TAKE FASHODA,
ON THE UPPER NILE
Disastrous Setback to the British
Victories Over the Fanatical
Khalifa.
LONDON, Sept. 10.â The dramatic news
received from Omdurman to-day, show
ing apparently that Fashoda, on the
White Nile, about 400 miles north of
Khartoum, has been occupied by a white
force, causes the greatest sensation. As
there seems little room to doubt that
the troops occupying that place ars
French, this will prove a disastrous set
back to the British victories in the Nile
and at once dispose of the questions of
a British water way to the Upper Nnle.
Of course, it is possible the force at
Fashoda may be British troops under
Major McDonald, but this is most un
likely, as the latest news received from
Uganda announced that McDonald had
not left there at the end of May, and It
is extremely improbable that McDonald's
force could have covered the distance
from Uganda to Fashoda, in this time,
more especially as, so far as is known,
he had only one small steel boat with
which to navigate the Nile.
Almost every one regards the stories of
a French expedition under Major Mar-
chand being:, near Fashoda as being noth
ing more than -"bluff," but now there 13
little reason to, hope that this is the case.
The news that British gunboats have
started for Fashoda opens the question
whether a conflict is likely to occur be
tween them and the force occupying
Fashoda. The great clanger is that the
headstrong young French officer may
open fire on the gunboats.

V^ It; * snt muc trouble
Xyj^âg*^^ for a really healthy man
to be good humored.
Jollity and exhuberant health are a pro-
verbial combination. The hearty man who
is- always latighing doesn't have any trouble
with his digestion. It has been said that
laughing makes people healthy. The truth
is that health makes people laugh.
It is impossible to estimate the tre-
mendous influence of health upon human
character. A man with a headache will
not be in a happy, contented frame of
mind. A man who suffers from a weak
stomach and an impaired digestion will sit
and grumble through the best meal ever
prepared. A bilious man who is. not a
bore, is deserving of a place in a museum.
A nervous man who is not petulent and
fault-finding iÂ» a curiosity. All these con-
ditions lead tograve diseases, when the
victim becomes not only disagreeable, but
dependent as well. A wise wife will real-
ize that while the old saying that a " man's
heart is in his stomach," is not literally
true, it is a fact that his stomach sweetens
or : sours his character according as it is
healthy or unhealthy. Dr. Pierce Golden
Medical Discovery is the best of medicines
for the conditions described. It makes
the weak stomach strong, the impaired
digestion perfect, invigorates the liver,
purifies and enriches the blood and tones
' the nerves. It tears down half-dead, inert
tissues and replaces them with the firm
muscular tissues of health. 'It builds new
and healthy nerve fibres and brain cells,'
It dissipates nervousness â¢ and melancholy
and imparts mental elasticity and courage.
It is the best of all known medicines for
nervous disorder. ?

WASHINGTON, Sept. iaâ Will you render the
country a great service by accepting my appointment
as a member of the committee to examine into the
conduct of the Commissary, Quartermaster and Medi
cal bureaus of the War Department during the war
and into the extent, causes and treatment of sickness
in the field and in the camps ? It is my desire that the
full and exact truth shall he ascertained and made
known. I cannot too strongly impress upon you my
earnest wish that this committee shall be of such high
character as will command the complete confidence of
the country, and I trust you will consent to serve.
This is the message which the Presi
dent addressed to each of the following
gentlemen in compliance with the re

This committee may consist of nine
members, or there may be only seven,
but I was informed by a member of the
Cabinet to-day that It is the Intention
of the President to have its personnel
so to give it such a broad scone
of inquiry that" its conclusions will
command the respect and confidence of
the country. I wag told that each of
the staff departments mentioned in the
President's dispatch would be Inves
tigated from top to bottom. All rec
ords will be thrown open to the com
mittee, which will be charged with
finding out just where the difficulty
was in each instance. These investi
gators are to take up the transactions
of former departments and follow them
from the head of the bureau in Wash
ington down through intermediate
channels to the lowest subordinate and
find out where the breakdowns were.

charges against his administration of
the War Department, the Secretary re
plied:
"Now, what do you want me to do?
Get down in the sewer with these sen
sational people? They are not worry

charges excepting somebody's desire to
make political capital. I have asked
the President to appoint the strongest
commission it is possible to secure to
conduct an inquiry into the conduct of
the war. It will be made up of some
of the ablest army officers and itÃ work
will be of the greatest Importance, as
applied to the past and as affecting the

perfecting the entire organization of
the army and applying in this provision
the lessons of the past."

PARI.-', Sept. 10.â Expectation was
disappointed to-day. The Ministerial
Council was to have held a special sit
ting with the object of hearing the
War Minister's account of the Dreyfus
case and the newly discovered delin- j
quencies of the staff officers. But Gen- j
eral Zurlinden, finding he had not yet j
the ground upon which to form a
sound opinion, asked for an adjourn
ment. He is a serious honorable
minded, worthy colleague of the con
scientious Brisson, and was chosen to |
investigate the Dreyfus affair as War
Minister because he is not biased and is
weighted with a sense of the responsi
bUity involved in the matter. Being a
Protestant and of Bourgeois breeding, (
he does not share the ultra-Catholic, '
anti-Jewish feeling noticeable at the '
War Office. Having been a prisoner of |
war in Germany in 1870 and being an i
Alsacian, he is warmly patriotic and
would sympathize with th ; military
judges of Dreyfus should he find cvi- ;
dence of guilt. General Zurlinden was
to have given a verdict to-day. If i
against reopening the case he would j
have retired to leave the Government
a free hand.
Judging frwm the disappointment
when newÃ was received that the coun
cil had adjourned, the Dreyfus case is in
a good channel. The Minister of Jus
tice has named six accomplished, ex
perienced, keen jurists to examine the
secret papers and everything connected
with the Dreyfus case. The reopening
will entirely depend upon this commit
tee. Not one of the six is a Jew, but
one of them, M. Crepot, has been a stu
dent all his life of Jewish history. An
other member of the committee, M. Lo
pellettier, has found relaxation from
legal toil in Greek literature. All six
are men of unblemished character and
in the habit of sifting evidence. The
six will set to work directly the War
Minister gives his opinion.
The country being now violently
anti-Semitic, and Dreyfus being a Jew,
the Government will have to act with
a wily creep, rather than walk forward.
The late Lieutenant Colonel Henry's
confession brought public opinion
around to a revision, but the hostility
to Dreyfus is not abated. The people
feel that a mist of Iniquity is involved
in the affair, and they will attempt to
penetrate it. They are beginning to
understand that the general staff is
no better than when it rendered the
military disasters of 1870 inevitable.
The resignation of General Boisdere
as chief of the general staff is a stand
ing puzzle, and it arouses suspicions
that only a public trial can quiet. The
people ask, "Was Dreyfus an accom
plice of Esterhazy? Were they both
able to hold rods in pickle for their
superiors? Was such power the rea
son why the trial was strangely con
ducted and Dreyfus delegated to the
solitude of Devils Island?"
The darkest conjectures are seem
ingly justified by the circumstances
connected with Colonel Henry's sui
cide, which, the Jews remark, was ac
complished on the day the Scientists'
Congress broke up. That event utterly
discredits the Intelligence Department
of the War Office, and, indeed, dis
credits the whole general staff.
No more grewsome event has ever
shocked human sentiment and con
science, and though it happened -within
sight of Paris, it is shrouded in mys
tery. Colonel Henry's is the secon-i
suicide connected with the Dreyfus af
fair. The first suicide was that of Le
Mercier Pickard, an intelligence agent
of the general staff of Colonel
Schwartzkoppen, the German military
attache here, and of the Italian Em
bassy. He was found suspended from
a lamp hook in a celling. Was he mur
dered? Was he a suicide? The sus
picious facts of his death were hushed
up by the late Government and M. Lu
pine, the former prefect of police.
The reported suicide of Major Count
Esterhazy was a canard. He knows
where too many skeletons are concealed
not to feel safe. He will die a nat
ural death, but fresh revelations may
lead to others following Colonel Henry.
The fairies, as in the Greek tragedies,
seem to enter into this drama. The
fall of General Boisdeffre brings the
drama home to the imperial court of
Russia, where, as a brilliant aristo
cratic military attache, he was a great
favorite. He was admitted to the in
timate festivities of the imperial fam
ily and was a favorite waltzing partner
of the Empress Dowager in her danc
ing days. The French republic sent
him and a special Embassy to the late
Czar's funeral and to the present Czar's
coronation. Great sums of money
were allowed him to cut a dash. Final
ly, President Faure took him to St.
Petersburg to assist in the preparation
of the Franco-Russian treaty. Why
such a great personage deems himself
guilty with Henry and resigns a splen
did poet passes comprehension. The
reopening of the Dreyfus case may
solve the puzzle.

SHINE AT THE
' DUBLIN SHOW
Great Annual Event
Is Described.
FAMOUS HISTORY RECALLED
GROWTH OF A SOCIETY FORMED
OVER A CENTURY AGO.
During the Assemblage of Country
People "The Belle of New
York" Makes a Decided
Hit.
BY J. J. CLANCY.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
DUBLIN, Aug. 27.â This has been
â what is known as horse show week in
Dublin. Only to those who know what
the annual Dublin Horse Show is and
what it brings in its train will this
phrase convey its full meaning. For
the show is not only the greatest of its
kind in Europe probablyâ in England,
Scotland or Irelund certainly â but it
has now grown into a sort of national
carnival. It is held under the auspices
of the Royal Dublin Society, which has
itself had a rather historic past. Over
a century and a half ago fourteen resi
dents of Dublin met in the rooms of the
Philosophical Society in Trinity Col
lege and there resolved to form a soci
ety called the "Dublin Society," the ob
ject of which would be "to promote the
Improvement of all kinds of husbandry,
manufactures and other useful arts and
Bclences."
In IS2O King George IVâ "the last of
the fools and oppressors called George,"
as Byron callt-d him In his "Irish Ava
tar" â became patron of the society, and
thenceforward it became the Royal
Dublin Society. In 1815 the body was
sufficiently affluent to purchase Leln-
House, the town residence of the
Duke of Leinster, ami the it has been
located since. In IS6B it held Its first
horse show in the grounds of Leinster
House, and it was so successful that it
was resolved to make it annual. In
the course of a dozen years the entries
had increased from 300 to nearly 600,
and the attendance from 17,000 to over
Fresh and more extensive
grounds were then acquired at Balls
bridge, a place on the River Dodder,
Outside the city bounds, on the south
side. Here progress has been the con
spicuous watchword of the great show.
Last year the entries numbered nearly
1600, and the attendance amounted to
nearly 70,000. This year the figures for
both are larger still.
This i>hÂ«-n.>menal success â phenom
enal, that is, for Ireland, where so
many things have gone to the bad un
der English ruleâ is undoubtedly due to
the superiority of the Irish-bred horse.
The soil and climate of Ireland are pe
culiarly suitable for producing first
class thoroughbreds and hunters, as
has been sh'nvn conclusively of late
specially on the English turf;
ami accordingly no such collection can
anywhere be had in Europe as is now
to be seen every year at Ballsbridge of
thoroughbred sires, thoroughbred mares
and thoroughbred colts and fillies,
while the hunters are, if possible, better
still than anything of the kind which
can bo produc-il in England. The re
sult la that the horse show is now pa
tronized not only by people from all
parts of Ireland but from E)ngland,
Scotland, France, Italy, Germany and
Russia, who come to see and to buy,
and who often pay fancy prices. The
greater number, however, of the visit
ors come from the provinces of Ireland
itself, and "horse bljow week" is for
t.hÂ»-m th" great week of the whole year.
They come up to Dublin in all their
finery &nd in such crowds as almost to
transform the look of the principal
Dublin streets, to fill the restaurants to
overflowing and to crowd the regular
lJ':blin playgoers out of the theaters
and music halls. The ladies, of course,
are the more conspicuous. They s^em
to dominate the whole place, and a
â¢wonderful sight they present for female
beauty as they are all gathered to
gether, clad in charming costumes and
furnished with that splendid complex
lon which can only he obtained in the
pure air of the country, in the grand
semi-circular stand in the great Jump-
Ing paddock. Apropos of the Irish la
dies, however, a Dublin paper to-day
draws a distinction between the present
and the past, which may interest Irish-
Americans. The modern Irish girl, it
says, is much taller than her mother.
Th^ country beauties "up for the horse
show," it adds, "nearly all tower above
th'ir attendant chaperons. So far as
actual beauty, however goes, the
mothers, we are informed, bear away
the palm, the pretty girl of the present
generation seldom having the perfect
f.-atures, never the gracious pose, of
the belle of say 1860. She is, it ap
pears, a finer woman physically, but
she is wanting in detail. Her complex
ion is good and her figure well devel
oped, but her eyes are ordinary, and
She does not show up well in evening
dress, because her violent athletic di
versions have made her just a little
stringy." I confess I am not myself
able to say whether all this is true, but
I have asked some ladies of my ac
quaint ;m<o whether it is, on the whole,
accurate or not, and they not only ad
mit that it is but they, moreover, at
tribute to the now almost universal use
of the bicycle the contrast between the
present and the past.
Th<- horse show has among Its chief
concomitants extra attractions in our
public places of amusement, and this
week, accordingly, both our leading
tht-au-rs have "put their best side out"
and have been rewarded by gala at
tendances. In the Theater Royal we
have "The BHle of New York," and <il
though the hardy and seasoned thea
tergoers of the city profess to think
rather little of the piece, it is quite evi
dent that our country cousins hold a
very different opinion of It. Night ufier
night during the past week they have
rushed to see it and have applauded it
tumultuously; and, as for the operas
at the (Jaiety, it goes without saying
that it has been almost impossible <o
get to see them during the last fe^Y
nights. Apropos of opera, it is worth
r f.ting that Italy, which used to give
us in this country and in England, too,
the greatest operatic artists, does so
no longer. America was the first coun
try to throw down the gauge and chal
lenge Italy's proud title of "the Land
nf Pong," and at the present time Al
banl, Nordica and Ella Russell (who is
singing in Dublin this week) are amonK
the best sopranos we have. But Aus
tralia, ir; about the last country one
-*"ul<l expect to see entering the lists,
and yet that continent has given us
some of the very best singer* of the
day. Between the companies in the
Thefitei Royal and Gaiety this week
Du'oi'n people and visitors to Dublin
can see and hear no less than four Aus
tralian artists playing leading parts In
opera, namely Lemfrieru Prlnglc, a.
fine basso; Miss Omerod, RoVert Cun
r.ingheiji, r tenor, and Miss Nellie Ste
wart, who plays the Salvation Army
lass in the "Belle of New York." Let
me add that Ireland itself is "well in"
in this matter. The young Dublin star,
William Dever, who is singing here
just now and made a decided hit in
"Lohengrin" a few nights ago, prom
ises to turn out a first-class artist, and
Ludwig (or Ledwich, as they call the
name in Dublin), Barton McGuckin
(another Dublin man) and Joseph
O'Meara of Limerick have long since
brought renown in "the old country."
I am glad to say that not only Dub
lin but Ireland also is full of visitors
and tourists. They aro swarming over
the 1000 lakes amid the hills of Conne
mara; they are crowding the southern
hotels recently erected in the most pic
turesque regions of Kerry; they are
thronging the Shannon steamers which
traverse what is known an "the Duke
of York's route." In fact, we are hav
ing " a tourist boom" in Ireland at last,
and from all I can hear the foreigners
who have come to Ireland this summer
for the first time are bo pleased with
what they have st>en and with the trav
eling and hotel accommodations they
have met with that a still larger influx
of visitors may be expected next year.
We have had some notable "Intruders"
among us. On the Strand at Grey
stones, about twelve miles from Dub
lin, for instance, within the past few
days we have had the unwonted spec
tacle of the Lord Chancellor of Eng
land and the Lord Chancellor of Ire
land pacing up and down side by side,
and no doubt discussing not only the
Irish question but the affairs of the em
pire, for they are both Cabinet Minis
ters. The English Lord Chancellor, by
the way, is of Irish extraction, and, in
deed, but for the accident of birth
would be just as much an Irishman as
the Irish I^ord Chancellor, Lord Ash
bourne. Hardinge Olfford, as the Earl
of Halsbury was known before he was
ennobled, was the .name of a Dublin
citizen who was very prominent in pol
itics on the English side In the last cen
tury, and Lord Halsbury is his direct
descendant. Indeed, I believe there are
several members of the family still res
ident in Ireland, some of them in Dub
lin. The two Chancellors are pretty
fortunate men. The English one has
ten thousand pounds sterling a year, a
peerage of the United Kingdom, and a
seat in the Cabinet, with "a pension of
four thousand pounds a year at any
time he goes out of office; the Irish has
all this, too, with the exception that his
salary is eight thousand pounds a year
Instead of ten. Considering that both
"rose from the ranks." I think that
they may both be considered rather
fortunate, I may add that the Irish
Chancellor's brothers and some other
relatives have also been fortunate. One
of his brothers is a Judge; another is a
paid magistrate in a country district;
another is an officer under the local
Government Board, and a brother-in
law occupies a valuable post in the
lunacy department of the Court of
Chancery. Some criticism is occasion
ally passed â mostly in private â on the
manner in which "the Gibsons" have
been quartered in the country; but I
must confess that I do not altogether
sympathize with it. Doubtless the
Lord chancellor was the making of the
fortunes of the other members of his
family; but he himself got his post
through his own ability in the House
of Commons, and why should he not
promote or help in the promotion of his
relatives if they were fit for the posts
they have got. as they are? On the
other hand, the English Lord Chancel
lor has got, from the manner in which
he has exercised his very considerable
powers of patronage, the name of "the
Lord Hieh Jobber." How far he de
serves the somewhat opprobrious ap
pellation I do not know, though I have
heard of some rather queer appoint
ments made by him from time to time.
The opening day of the horse show
was chosen by the Irish Daily Inde
pendent â the Dublin organ of the Par
nelllte party â for an exhibition of en
terprise which will be of interest to
Irish-Americans. On that day it ap
peared in an enlarged size, with some
of its pages printed in two colors by a
new printing press. The machine is an
American one â the Goss, from Chicago
â and is the first of its kind, not merely
in Ireland or in the United Kingdom,
but in Europe.
COMPANY F BREAKS
CAMP AT SANTA CRUZ
SANTA CRUZ, Sept. 10.â In obedience
to marching orders Company F, Sixth
California Volunteers, who for the past
three months have been on guard duty
at the California Powder Works, left this
morning for San Francisco. Yesterday
the tents and camp paraphernalia were
packed and shipped, and the last night at
Camp Merriam was spent under the
Fhf-!tÂ«-r tents.
This morning before 6 o'clock the two
and a half miles march from Camp Mer
riam was commenced. On River street the
men were all presented with floral bou
tonnieres by young ladies.
The boys in blue cheered Mrs. Rodgers
as they passed up the avenue, as they did
the McLaughllna while passing Golden
Gate Villa.
At the depot they were drawn up in line
ami Lieutenant Governor Jeter stepped
forward and spoke in behalf of the people
of Santa Cruz. He said he know the boys
Were disappointed in not bolng sent to the
front, but they would all return home. If
they were at the front one-half might be
sick of fever or dead, and perhaps no
body but Captain Rottanzi would get back
safely.
( 'aptain Lucey, on behalf of the com
pany, said words could not express tho
gratitude of the soldiers to the people of
Sunta Cruz for their kindness, and he
called for three cheers for Santa Cruz,
which the men gave in a most hearty
manner.
Lieutenant Governor Jeter proposed
three choirs for Captain Lucey and the
members of Company F. The people took
it up and they were rousers.
At 7 o'clock the train pulled out with the
band playing and whistles blowing.

MOGUIRES PRIVILEGED CLASSES.
JUDGE MAGUIRE will try in vain to limit the
issues of the campaign to a discussion of the
Southern Pacific road. That unfortunate and
much berated enterprise reminds one of Byron's
apostrophe to woman:
"Thou shouldst have no. sins of thine own to answer
for.
Thou art the author of such a book of follies in
man."
If the Southern Pacific Company answers for the
book of follies in California in the record of dema
gogues who have achieved office by fighting it, it
should be excused for any peccadillos of its own.
But, after all, the railroad" has no complaint to
make. It is a secondary offender, in a lower class
than the land-owner. Men can carry their goods on a
pack mule or wagon. The owners of railroads have
not taken away from the people anything they had
before. The wagon roads and rivers, the bay and
the ocean are left. If the shippers don't like the rates
they can resort to other means of transportation.
Judge Maguire does not say that the railroad has
robbed the people of anything as essential to their
life as air and sunshine. But he clues make this serious
charge against the land-owner.
The private owners of land, who have put their
money into real estate, are likened by Maguire unto
those who would monopolize the air and sunshine.
While he denounces railroads he proposes to destroy
the land-owners.
In his campaign against "special privileges" he puts
the land-owner first among monopolists and charges
him with all the crime and poverty in the world.
Indeed in his letter to the single taxers of the State of
Washington he says if land everywhere can be con
fiscated and taken away from the private owner, the
whole world will immediately become a republic!
This being so, the sins of the land-owner are as
scarlet. He is not only a "cunning aggressor" and
robber of "the weak and undesigning," but he is re
sponsible for all the monarchies and autocracies of
the world as well.
The Judge has not yet charged that to the South
ern Pacific Railroad, nor has he said that Govern
ment ownership of railroads will immediately repub
licanize the world.
A study of his system of politics seems to demon
strate that, carried out, it will create more privileged
classes than it destroys. By putting all the taxes on
land he intends to destroy the private owners and get
them out of the way as a privileged class. These un
fortunates have chosen to put their earnings in land
instead of in railroads. The owners of railroads
are to be exempted from taxes on their money,
tracks, stations, terminals, ferry-boats, cars, loco
motives, coal, ties and material.
Exemption from taxation is surely a high privilege
and those who enjoy it are a privileged class.
When it is considered that nine-tenths of the cost
of government is for the benefit of the owners of per
sonal property, exemption of such owners from the
payment of any of that cost is a distinct privilege.
The Police and Fire departments of this city are
maintained solely in the interest and for the protec
tion of the personal property and improvements
which Maguire proposes to exempt from taxation.
No one can steal and carry off town lots nor set fire
to them. The owners of land need no such protec
tion. Land goes infrequently into the courts. It
passes probate once in every generation, and that is
about all. The courts are kept a*nd paid to protect
the rights of personal property, compel payment of
insurance on buildings and enforce the collection of
debt?. All of these choses in action are exempted
from tax by Magtrire, and the cost of protecting and
adjusting them is to be taken out of the land.
The common man wiH see that this exemption
clearly creates a privileged class. Again, it is the spirit
of our institutions to put church organizations on a
Irvel and tax them, for it is a law inexorable that
property accumulates at the point of non-taxation.
It has been held against public policy, under our sys
tem, to encourage the accumulation of property in
ecclesiastical ownership. Does Maguire think it is
good policy to encourage such ownership? His pro
posed exemption will tend to accelerate it.
General Miles declines to talk any more. Unlike
some political speakers he has the prescience to know
when he has got through.
There is every probability that after the November
election Judge Maguire will resume the practice of
law in this city.
It is to be regretted that in the late war red tape
stood between many a soldier and his abdominal
badge.
People who believe in the single tax also entertain
the cheering belief that the other fellow will pay the
tax.
PIETY AND_TfJX SHIRKING.
\A R. JOHN J. VALENTINE, known as presi
/ \ dent of Wells, Fargo & Co., and noted for
piety, will go to church this morning and
thank God he is not as other men. In his unctuous
fervor he will express gratitude to Providence that
while other men have to pay war taxes he has found
a means of evading them. He may even feel so
uplifted in his conceit of this matter that he will drop
an extra nickel in the collection box and rejoice that
the Lord has provided him a means of getting it
back again by making the patrons of his express
company pay it.
Such may be the devotions of the pious tax shirker
this Sunday, but other Sundays are coming when he
will not be so grateful â when he may even be heard
complaining that the Lord has forsaken him and
left him in his old age subject to taxes just as any
ordinary citizen whose piety is not ostentatious
enough to be conspicuous through the city.
The reason why this change is likely to come over
the devotions of the prayerful preyer upon the public is
that Wells, Fargo & Co. may have to pay their taxes
after all. As will be seen by our local columns this
morning a suit has been begun by W. E. Costey to
compel the express company to accept freight for
shipment from him without his paying the revenue
duties. This suit raises an issue for the courts, and
with its decision will come an end to the petty rob
bery which the company and its psalm singing presi
dent have been practicing upon the people.
It is to be noted that the position taken by Mr.
Coster is exactly that taken by The Call and other
newspapers of the city. Wells, Fargo & Co. not
long ago declared the newspapers must pay the cost
of revenue stamps on packages of papers shipped by
them through the company's express, and the pious
president suggested a cunning means by which the
papers could cheat the Government and ship a whole
wagonload of papers as one package. The Call and
other newspapers of the city refused. They main
tained that it was the duty of the express company
to pay the tax, and after some bluster the company
yielded.
Every citizen has the same right to ship packages
by Wells, Fargo & Co. without paying the revenue
duties, that newspapers have. The express company
demands the cost of the stamps from the ordinary
shipper simply because the officers of the company
believe the shipper will not fight. The suit begun
by Mr. Costey is therefore a battle for the public
good. It is a notice to the corporation that the
people, no more than the press, will submit to extor
tion on the part of unpatriotic tax shirkers.
The company has recently issued a pamphlet de
fending its attempt to rob the public and cheat the
Government. This production is prefaced with the
statement: "It is of the essential nature of a docu
mentary stamp tax that the burden falls upon the
beneficiary." This queer sentence, whose curious
construction could have been the result only of a
most prayerful consideration, means that whoever is
to get the benefit of a taxed article or transaction is
to pay the tax; that is to say, if a purchaser of patent
pills gets any benefit from them he must pay the tax;
if not, then the seller must pay the tax. By this
reasoning the man who draws a check ought not to
pay the tax, because the man to whom k is payable
gets the benefit.
Wells, Fargo & Co., taking their sentence as an
axiom, not to be disputed, argue from it that their
company is a public benefactor and that all who pat
ronize it are the recipients of benefits. Mr. John J.
Valentine, it will be seen, is determined to pose as
a philanthropist as well as a steady church goer. The
general public, however, even if they accept the
axiom, will not accept the conclusion. They will
hold that the company is the beneficiary, the ship
pers are the benefactors, and that by the rule as laid
down the company should pay the tax.
The justice of the popular contention is beyond
refutation. The express company is capitalized at
$8,000,000, and the earnings last year amounted to 10
per cent on that sum. Of the vast capital only
$500,000 represents money paid in. The rest is ficti
tious. With a capital that has so largely expanded
and with an income so large it is clear that Wells,
Fargo & Co. have been very extensive beneficiaries
of the trade of the public and are. by their own reas
oning, in duty bound to pay the tax the Government
imposed upon them.
This pamphlet, like all the other arguments and
bluffs of the express company, is simply a move to
gain time, a trick to get the people to wait. When
the merchants of San Francisco began to take steps
to bring about a decision on the right of the com
pany to exact the revenue tax from its patrons, the
officials persuaded them to abandon the project by as
serting that the same issue was to be raised in the East
and would be speedily heard and settled there. Time
has passed, but no decision has come from the East.
The merchants were tricked.
When the combined express companies of the
country, by a collusion which was itself unlawful, de
cided to unite for the purpose of shirking the tax, an
opinion was obtained on the question from Attorney
General Griggs to the effect that the companies must
pay. Some time afterward the attorney for the ex
press companies, John J. McCook, of New York, a
man eminent at the bar, in politics and in the church,
and having three several kinds of pulls, induced the
Attorney General to so far change his original declar
ation as to declare that as to the issue between the
shippers and the express companies the Government
was indifferent. In other words, so long as the
Government derives the required revenue, it matters
not who pays it.
In that condition the controversy stands now, and
the action brought by Mr. Costey is a veritable gain
for the people. It brings the issue to a point where
neither the company, by its tricks and Its bluffing, nor
the president, by his prayers or his pamphlets, can
keep it from determination by the courts. If now
the case can be forced to a speedy hearing and de
cision, all will be well.
In the meantime the people must not forget that
a Legislature is to be elected, from which relief may
be expected. A recent decision by a court in Wash
ington City holds that the rates of telephone com
panies are subject to revision by legislative authority.
The telephone company of the District of Columbia
by that decision has been compelled to serve the pub
lic at the rates fixed by Congress.
What has been done there can be done in Cali
fornia. The enormously rich express company,
whose capital has expanded from $500,000 to $8,000,
000 and whose earnings are 10 per cent, most of whose
business is done in this State, while nine-tenths of
the stock is held in the East, is a legitimate subject
for taxation and regulation at the coming session of
the State legislative body.
The people should see to it that men are elected in
every Assembly district who will investigate the af-.
fairs of the company and arrange for taxation and
rate regulation according as justice dictated.
This subject is one which the telephone company
as well as the express company should heed. The
people are weary of the tricks and frauds of wealthy
tax-shirking corporations, and all of them will have
a day of reckoning when the Legislature meets this
winter.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1898.
BY the hand of the assassin who struck to death
the Empress of Austria the anarchists of
Europe have accomplished another of those ter
rible crimes which they call triumphs. A woman,
venerable for her years, loved for her virtues and
made sacred to every noble heart by the many sor
rows that have fallen upon her august head, has been
stabbed and murdered for no other reason than that
of being the wife of the sovereign of a great people.
This latest crime of anarchy is in many respects
the worst and most revolting of all. The wretches
who aimed their bombs or their poniards at
the Czar of Russia, the President of France
or the Prime Minister of Spain, could
at least claim that they struck at men; but
this scoundrel who perpetrated the crime at the Hotel
Beaurivage was of that unredeemable baseness that
not only commits causeless murder through devilish
malignancy, but strikes at womanhood itself, even
when crowned with gray hairs and robed in garments
of mourning.
The fated house of Atreus, whose many calamities
furnished the Greek dramatists with the awful trage
dies which still move the hearts of men, was not
subject to a more direful doom than that which has
befallen the ill-fated house of Hapsburg in this gen
eration. By a strange contrast with their terrible for
tunes, the Emperor and the Empress have been
among the worthiest that ever sat upon a throne.
Francis Joseph has long been familiarly spoken of
as "the beloved Emperor." The Empress herself was
one of the most popular women in Europe, revered
in her own land for her bountiful charities and
gracious ways, and respected everywhere for her
courtesy of manner, her frank kindliness and her
genuine goodness of heart.
It was to her generous confidence in the general
love of the people and her unassuming simplicity of
manner that her assassin owed the opportunity he
found to strike his cowardly blow. The Empress was
without guards. She was living amid the Swiss
mountains in the simplicity of Swiss life. Any one
could approach her without let or hindrance. She
feared none, for she had done wrong to none. She
forgot that to the anarchist it is not necessary that
there should be a cause for a crime â that to him all
that is necessary is an opportunity.
It will be remembered that when the Immigration
restriction bill was under consideration in the House
of Representatives the friends of the measure urged
as one strong argument in its favor that it would ex
clude from the United States the class of people who
have committed the crimes of anarchy in Europe.
Judge Maguire not only opposed the bill, but avowed
his antagonism to any policy of excluding such men.
In the course of a speech delivered in the House
January 27, 1897, on the restricts 1 bill he declared
the exclusion of anarchists, socialists and nihilists
was not desirable, and said: "They are generally
educated men, many of them holding university de
grees, whose offending consists of resistance to ty
ranny, which in the conditions under which they live
is obedience to God. Who are the nihilists? They
are the Democrats of Russia, who are struggling
against almost hopeless odds to establish the in
alienable rights of man in that country as against
the tyranny and false pretense of divine right on the
part of the Czar."
Since that speech was delivered the anarchists of
Europe have struck two blows, and Canovas of
Spain and Elizabeth of Austria are dead; and now
the Congressman who wished the doors of this coun
try kept open to the coming of such criminals is a
candidate for the governorship of California.
POLITICS fIND THE TAX LEVY.
NO satisfactory evidence has been pVoduced to !
prove that the Finance Committee of the Board
of Supervisors has ever, as charged by the !
$30,000 "advertising" contract Examiner, contem
plated the imposition of a tax levy for the current |
fiscal year of $2 10. The committee has as yet held
no meetings and given no consideration to the sub
ject. In fact, two members of the committee are out
of town. Captain Rottanzi is with his company at j
the Santa Cruz powder-mill, and Devany is at Skaggs j
Springs recovering from a fit of sickness. The re- j
maining member, Haskins, says the coming tax levy
has never been discussed.
The alarming cry raised by the ex-railroad organ,
therefore, is political claptrap, and is probably intro
duced at this time for the purpose of diverting atten
tion from its operations with the Southern Pacific
and other corporations with which it usually does
business at election times. It will be remembered
that the $30,000 "advertising" contract with the rail
road monopoly was negotiated at the beginning of a
campaign, and was made payable in installments of
$1000 a month in order to keep the organ in line for
thirty months.
But even if it were a fact that the Finance Com
mittee contemplated an excessive tax levy â that is to
say, a tax levy which would produce more money
than the necessities of the city require â the Exam
iner should be the last to be heard in complaint. The
Board of Supervisors is Democratic, and the Finance
Committee is composed entirely of Democrats. Not
only this, but the entire board, and two members at
least of the Finance Committee, were named by
Mayor Phelan by and with the advice and consent
of the Examiner. It is a well-known fact that Mr.
Phelan declined to accept the nomination for Mayor
two years ago unless he could select the Supervisors.
It was stated at the time, and never has been denied,
that upon receiving this ultimatum Boss Rainey
transferred the nomination of the board to Phelan.
Of course that gentleman acted only after consulta
tion with the Third Street Boodler.
The Examiner buncombe howl about the tax levy,
however, is not based upon a desire to conceal its
responsibility for the existence of the "Shitty Eight"
and the record that muchly abused aggregation of
good Democrats have made. That sheet cares noth
ing for responsibility in any form. The howl is
launched solely for the purpose of setting up a false
issue and calling attention to the Spartan virtue of its
especial pet, the Mayor.
If a tax levy of $2 10 is levied the Third Street
Boodler will claim that it raised the alarm and did
what it could to avert the calamity. If no such levy
is imposed it will, with equal effrontery, claim that it
averted the calamity. In either event the Boodler
has a "sure thing."
If the Examiner were as certain of getting another
$30,000 "advertising" contract out of the Southern
Pacific this year as it is of establishing a reputation
as an irretrievable ass, it would indeed be a happy
sheet. But the grass is now too short for a contract.
The dry year has cut down railroad receipts, and Mr.
Huntington cannot afford to extend his payroll. The
only hope left for Hearst, therefore, is to blackmail
the water and gas companies and make what he can
out of local politics. Mr. Phelan ought to pay well
for the laudatory notices and pictures now being
printed in aid of his candidacy. The Mayor's leg will
stand a good pulling.
In many instances fusion has resulted in confusion,
and Colorado has added effusion to the list.
fINARCHY'S LATEST CRIME.
WITH ENTIRE FRANKNESS.
According- to report, one Macfarlane,
a person concerned In the trial of Cur
tis for the murder of Policeman Grant,
passed through this city as a member
of the Astor Battery. If this is true,
he should remain at Manila, whether
above or below gTound does not par
ticularly matter. While, as a newspa
per man, I have observed some trials
not marked by regard either for law
or Justice, I think in all the history of
American jurisprudence there was
never another trial so farcical, bo rot
ten, such a travesty as that of Curtis.
That he was guilty nobody doubted, no
body who read the evidence could doubt;
and as for the jurymen who voted
to acquit, every one of them should
have been sent to jail. Not only was
the trial a succession of palpable per
juries, but there was scarcely an at
tempt at secrecy concerning this fact.
There could not have been a clearer
case. That Curtis went unpunished
was a lasting disgrace. Macfarlane
had to do. with fixing the matter.
Probably he did not accept this respon
sibility for fun. Still, there is a
bright side to the affair. Since bun
koing the rallows Curtis has stayed
away from California.
I have not the slightest ambition to
try the case of Mrs. Botkin. Last week
there were indications that the case
against her was groundless. At this
writing the shadows are gathering
about her. It may be they will van
ish as quickly as they came. The strik
ing point about the whole matter has
been the readiness of people to rush
forward with evidence apparently dam
aging, or designed to cloud the issue.
Most of them were quickly proved to
be pretenders, but this does not ac
count for their eagerness to be known
as voluntary bearers of false witness.
Another thing has been the amateur
analysis of the woman's demeanor.
Whether she is innocent or guilty is a
conclusion not to be drawn from her
conduct as a prisoner. Charged with
an awful crime, it would not be sur
prising were she to break down utter
ly, and it is not surprising that she
presents a cool and collected air. Jhere
is no rule about these things. To say
Bhe is guilty because she is calm as
a Durrant is precisely as illogical as
for the same reason to proclaim her
Innocence. She is to be pitied if her
fate is in any measure to hang upon
the testimony of handwritlne: experts.
Probably they deserve the title, but I
have observed that they will swear
warmly for the side that happens to
retain them. The only evidence upon
which a prisoner can be fairly tried
is that appealing to the senses. The
prisoner ought not to be judged either
by the dictum of an expert hired by
the other side or by the hysterics in
which the police are Indulging.

As a rule there cannot be sympathy
for the young woman who secures a
pistol and seta out to redress her own
wrongs, but I would make an excep
tion In behalf of Evelyn Holt, who took
a shot at Carl Fecker. The gravest
error chargeable to her is that she did
not manage to reach a vital spot. Not
that Evelyn is any rosebud of inno
cence herself, but she seems far supe
rior to the Fecker creature. He is one
of the cumberers of the earth who
ought to be killed on general princi
ples. It would appear that he lived
by fraud, and that the Holt woman
was one of his most profitable victims.
She gave him her money, which he
was too lazy to earn, and she gave him
her affection. It was all she had.
That she was weak and foolish to love
a brute of his unhallowed type is true,
but in no measure excuses him. She
ought to be able to get out of her dif
ficulty. A female who believes the
man who tells her he will marry her
after a while, meantime assuming to
ward him the relations of wifehood. Is
so big a fool that the plea of Idiocy
surely would set her free.
Some of the French officials claim
there Is evidence outside of the forged
letter of Captain Henry sufficient to
convict Dreyfus. Reference 19 doubt
less had to more forged letters. There
is a growing prejudice against evidence
of this sort. Nobody, outside of France
ever considered Dreyfus guilty and no
body, with the exception of a few who
were persecuted for it, ever seemed. to
care. There was a cry from the aris
tocracy that the man be sacrificed, and
he was. There have been times in the
history of France when the aristocracy
has failed to have things its own way,
and with all the ardor of absinthe, the
aristocracy is trying to induce history
to hasten the Inevitable repetition of it
self.

the nerve of the mining man who got
taken in by one of these traps with a
widow for bait, In having her put in
jail and endeavoring to break up the
concern. The widow is said to be
known to the police, and if she Is not

trifle of nerve herself. She denounces
the unhappy victim of her wiles as lack

social equal. Well now! She de

There Is many an incident in local life I
worth writing a story about. In the j
daily record there are touches of pa
thos, even of heroism. I have in mind
the Widow Wilson, with whom for
years two hackmen have been in love.
One did his wooing by night and the
other by day. and the joy of neither
was marred by the knowledge that he
did not have a monopoly of the widow's
great heart. Some women can keep a
secret. Year after year was the widow
courted by the pair, each putting In a
twelve-hour shift. But at last the
men found each other out, and there
had to be a final choice, an ordeal
which no doubt wrung the tender sen
sibilities of the charmer. She made
her selection and there may be expected
shortly a fisticuff function, wherein two
hackmen will be principals and the po
lice will referee. Whether the pres
ent status of the matter is satisfac
tory to the widow's daughter has not
been ascertained, as this young lady
has gone for a time to the Magdalen
Home, and is what the Spanish term
incommunicado. This affair consti
tutes one of the incidents to which ref
erence was made in the opening line.
Minna street society is said to be all

"When a man sends weekly political
letters to the country papers, all the
letters presenting a single side of the
situation, and does it "without remun
eration," I take this to mean without
remuneration from the papers. Doubt
less he gets paid at the other end of
the line, and does not take it in the
form of glory either. The patriot who
beats his breast and yowls from the
stump seldom becomes so enthusiastic
as to do it with an eye single to the
betterment of any cause to the neglect
of his purse. The scribbling patriot
is built on the same lines.
Phil Francis of the Stockton Mall has
been perpetrating poetry. He presents
It with an intimation that he expects
bricks to be shied at him. I am al
ways loaded for the amateur poet, but
reading this verse I laid down the brick
which had been ready poised. The
verse was a tribute to "The Man In the
Ranks." It was gentle, patriotic, re
sonant with melody. If I could write
poetry as well as Francis can I would
do it oftener than he do^s.
Among the best letters sent back
from Manila have been those of Fred
Healy, a private in the ranks of the
First California. When the call to
arms came Healy was quick to re
spond. He was a reporter on this pa
per, a gentleman by birth and instinct
and culture. He went because he
thought it his duty to go. After he
had enlisted he told mo that he had
not much confidence in himself. He did
not know how he would act under fire,
"and yet," said he, "I would hate to
come back from Manila without hav
ing been tried out." He has been
"tried out" and he acted as everybody
who knew him was sure he would. I
see from a private letter from a com
rade who stood next to him In the
ranks that a bullet cut a branch from
a tree not a foot above Healy's head.
Of course this circumstance was not
in itself remarkable, but in Healy's
own communication it was not men
tioned. Like the brave young Ameri
can that he is, he would not boast. He
would not even speak of his own sen
sations, or the ordeal through which
he had passed. I glory in the spunk
of Healy, and venture to say that
when he returns the staff will have him
as guest of honor at a better dinner
than the Philippine Islands ever saw.
At the latest "attempt to assassinate
the Czar" I say "bosh," and probably
in his own language that potentate
made a remark to the same effect. It
seems that a house was blown up by
gas just about the time the Czar was
to pass. The explosion occurred pre
maturely, so the royal family escaped,
but the brave anarchist who stayed in
the house until it had become so full of
the deadly monoxide that a match sent
it into smithereens, perished in several
pieces. I wonder how, while he was
waiting, the anarchist had refrained
from breathing. Had he lived in the
atmosphere he is supposed to have cre
ated, he would have died of it, and hav
ing died could not have struck a light
at the critical moment. I think it
more probable that there was no gas
in the case. More likely the anarchist

The Tulare News is the latest to start
a special department wherein genius
may disport at will. The department
is called "Oozings" and it oozes in a
manner to cheer the drooping- sons of
men. To some extent it has patterned
after the Musings, of which it has been
my pleasure to give occasional speci
mens, but this is nothing to its dis
credit. There are few masters in lit
erature, and while one might emulate
the style of Milton or Poe he would be
apt to fall abjectly or write over the
heads of his readers. So the OoÂ«er
copies the Muser, and I think with
happy results. I venture to quote a
sample:
"Of writing verse I never tire, '
Although at times I do perspire.'
I leave to the judgment of. the world
whether the Muser himself ever did a
finer stroke. The' Oozer is a soul
thriller from way back. There was a
poetic spirit in Colorado once who
wrote verse. Happily I have forgot
ten most of it. but one couplet clings
to memory like a burr. It is this:
"Many well-known people perished In this
horrifying fire,
And others less well known did also then
expire."
The suspicion forces Itself upon me
that the Muser has secured a copy of
my Colorado friend's work, and that
the Inspiration seeps through his font
of poesy so markedly that the Oozer
gets the benefit, and less directly, we
all do.

ANACONDA, Mont., Sept. 10.â Th*
twenty-seven-day race meeting which
closed here to-day has been one of the
most successful ever held in the Stare.
With many outside influences to com
bat against the attendance has been
fully up to that of last year. Notwith
standing the absence of many big
plungers nearly $1,000,000 has passed
through the pool boxes. From a cere
ful computation Manager Ed Tipton
states that over $2,000,000 has changed
hands at the Butte and Anacnnda
meeting together. The rich $5000 Labor
Day handicap, decided on Monday, Sep
tember 5, was the big event of the
meeting, and the win of Marcus Daly's
brown horse Scottish Chieftain was a
popular one. He shouldered 120 pounds
and in a fierce drive Duffy snatched
victory by a nose from the despised
Ider Tempo, with 88 pounds in the
saddle. The latter horse was formerly
the roperty of E. A. Tipton and was
but recently sold for the meager sum
of $70.
The fortunate purchaser has since
been offered $1500 for the colt. The fa
vorlte, Senator Bland, ran well for a
mile and then pulled out of the game,
. ssly beaten. His past trials were
the cause of many depleted pockets.
lian dOr, the Eustern candidate for
the prize, was never in the hunt. Ru

Daggie Smith left for California last
week, credited with being over $4000
ahead on the trip. He purchased Hor
ton from the Holly estate, paying $1500
for the colt.
Smith's reputation was slightly tar
nished by the disgraceful showing
made by Torslda in the Yellowstone
handicap run at Butte, for which she
ruled a heavy favorite and finished
last. Inside gossip has it that the issues
were pooled and all the coin bet on
Highland Ball. If the Job did exist it
was foiled, for t 1 - < latter was defeated
in a hard drive by Imp. Missloner. The
fact remains that six days lat-r Tor
sida came out and took the rich Daly
stake in a gallon with the stable boy
(llenn on her back.
Farrer & Tuberville started off good
winners, but Flashlight and the bal
ance of their horses "trained off," leav
ing them in the lurch toward the end.
Farrer left for Sacramento some days
ago, but Tuberville Is still here with a
portion of the stable.

Jeckey Johnny Sullivan of California
heads the list of winning jockeys here,
with Shaw and Morgan following in the
order named. Gus Wilson's work in the
saddle has been far above anything he
had done before. Sullivan will go to
Texas with J. W. Fuller, owner of Rat
tler. Honest John. Jack and o-ther fast
ones. He should be the stur of the
Texas circuit. William Fllnn, who suf
fered a fracture of the arm at the Den

member in splints, having broken it
again while skylarking.
H. L. Frank, a heavy loser on the
ban Francisco track last winter is
reported far behind the game here On
a recent day he backed his bone Sena
tor Bland extensively and is said to
have dropped $8000 <-n th>- lay's specu

will probably secure a lease of the
horses, as Owner Frank is disgusted
with the game.

BLACK VENUS TAKES
THE GREAT EASTERN
St. Lorenzo Falls During the Bace
and Jockey Barrett Is Badly
Injured.
NEW YORK, Sept. 10.â Perfect weather,
a fast track and a good card attracted
a large crowd to the closing day of the
Sheepshead Bay meeting to-day. Two
stakes were down for decision, the Great
Eastern and the Autumn Cup. Four
teen of the best two-year-olds in train
ing faced the starter in the Great East
ern, with Black Venus a hot favorite, and
Martimas, the Futurity winner, second
choice. Black Venus, rushing to the
front, made all the running and won well
in hand by a length and a half from
Ethelbert and Martimaa, who llnished
heads apart in that order.
During the race St. Lorenzo, with Bar
rett up, fell reavily In the middle of the
bunch at the head of the stretch, and it
is fiared that Barrett was badly injured.
The Autumn Cup furnished a sensational
finish between The Friar and George
Boyd, the latter, with Sloan up, winning
in a drive by a neck. The Morris pair.
The Friar and Mirthful, were favorites at
odds on. The Friar made the running all
the way, but George Boyd, with a puil in
the weights, got up in tne stretcn and
won in a drive.

TO REPLACE THE MAINE.
Great Battleship Will Be Construct-
Ed by the Cramps.
PHILADELPHIA. Sept. 10â It Is un
officially announced that Phil lelphla
will build for the American avy the
battleship that is to replace the Maine
â a ship that will be a rival of the tre
mendous Royal Sovereign of the Eng
lish navy and the Camot of the French
navy. The shipbuilders all made pro
posals to build vessels of eighteen knots
speed and exceeding by more than 1000
tons the displacement contemplated by
Congress. Of the different types pro
posed in the three bids, that offered by
the Cramps, it is said, found the most
favor. The result was that the board
concluded to recommend that an award
be made of one battleship to each of
the three bidders, provided the other
two would accept the Cramps scheme
in lieu of thore offered by themselves.
The ship, lengthened and otherwise
modified according to Cramps' original
scheme, will be of about 12,189 tons dis
placement.
VICTORY CAUSES
MUCH EXULTATION
England's Sentiment as
to the Soudan.
FOREBODINGS ARE DISPELLED
BRITONS JOYOUS OVER KITCHE
NER'S VICTORY.
At Home, However, the Army Is
Not Well Supplied, and There
Was Much Misery at
Salisbury Plain. ,
Copyrighted, 1898. by the Associated Press.
LONDON, Sept. 10.â The event of
the week, the capture of Omdurman
and, incidentally, of Khartoum, by the
Anglo-Egyptian army, under General
Sir Herbert Kitchener, has produced a
feeling of exultation throughout Great
Britain, which is in marked contrast
with the gloomy forebodings of the
past months, during which every one
has been finding fault with the Gov
ernment, and it was generally be
lieved that the country's rivals were
overmatching her at every point. The
completeness of the victory has had a
most exhilarating effect and has un
doubtedly impressed the Continental
nations, while the cordial praise cabled
from the American press has been
much appreciated here.
The understanding arrived at be
tween Great Britain and Germany al
lows the former's plans In South Af
rica to be carried out without fear of
a German-Boer alliance and the dis
missal of L,i Hung Chang from the Chi
nese Foreign Office, following the
Czar's proposals, is taken as evidence
of the complete triumph of British di
plomacy in the far East.
Vanity Fair, an ardent supporter of
the Government, in a gleeful review of
the situation, says: "Looking east
ward we see pauperized Russia ready
to climb at our desire."
"And, last of all," continues Vanity
Fair, which of late has been most in
genious and persistent in its abuse and
misrepresentation of America, "if we
look at America we are confronted with
the sight of a friendly nation ready to
back us up whenever our desires are
mutual. Who will say now that the
horizon is not clear and that Old Eng
land, instead of having taken a lower
place, sits on a still higher pinnacle?"
While the transport and commis
sariat departments of the British army,
as exemplified by the admirable con
duct of the Soudan campaign, appear
tn be beyond reproach in active service,
there is no lack of allegations that
there was a serious breakdown during
the recent army maneuvers on Salis
bury plain. In the Jirst place, owing to
the resources of the War Office uu-ing
inadequate to the demands, the con
tract for the catering was given to Sir
Thomas Lipton, and, if the reports are
to be believed, the soldiers suffered con
siderable privations. Indeed, it would
seem some of them suffered bo much
that they committed offenses, prefer
ring prison to the treatment they were
receiving on Salisbury plain. This is
corroborated by the fact that the mili
tary prisons in the neighborhood were
so overcrowded that the officials de
clared they would not receive any fur
ther prisoners. Besides this, the suf
ferers from sickness and accidents
complain of great neglect. They say
they were without food and drink for
hours, or until civilians succored them.
The tourist agencies are planning
trips to Khartoum, which this week
has demonstrated to be less than nine
days from London. Last Saturday Gen
eral Kitchener dispatched Colonel Hope
from Omdurman, the former Dervish
stronghold on the River Nile, near
Khartoum, to Cairo, and he accom
plished the journey in eighty-seven
and a half hours.
A long-cabled interview with Joseph
Chamberlain, the British Secretary for
the Colonies, who is now in the United
States on a visit to his wife's parents,
has been received with incredulity by
the English press. The Daily Chronicle
says: "That he should have talked of
a railroad through the Transvaal from
Khartoum to the cape, or have dis
closed the Anglo-German understand
ing, or performed other feats of a like
description is beyond believing. If
these stories are true, then indeed Lord
Salisbury's 'blazers' are quenched for
ever in the white light of Mr. Chamber
lain's indiscretions."
Tropical weather continues here and
on the Continent. The thermometer in
London on Thursday last registered 90
degrees, which is the record for the
summer, while the returns for the past
thirty years do not show any previous
record above 87 for the month of Sep
tember.
Tbt whole of Great Britain continues
without rain, and the almost unbreath
ftble atmosphere in London Is inten
sified by a sultry, white mist, which
was so thick on the Thames that the
steamboats had to stop running. There
have been innumerable cases of sun
stroke of apoplexy, and the iron
works of Birmingham and the "Black
Country" are closing on account of the
heat. Fires are occurring among the
tieep and in 4he grass on the commons.
The conditions prevailing in the east
mcl of London are especially pitiable.
There has been the usual water famine,
and for three weeks over 1,000,000 peo
ple, to say nothing of animals, have
been suffering from the shortage. The
situation is daily growing worse, fevers
are breaking out, and as the indications
of rain are as scarce as the signs of
snow, the supply of water has already
been curtailed three hours daily, and
promises to be further shortened.
The heat has also been very great in
Paris, where an ice famine prevails,
and the French soldiers have been suf
fering so much during the army man
euvers that the latter ->ad to be aban
doned. The Paris meteorological au
thorities hold that a sun spot is re
sponsible for the extreme heat.
It now appears that George N. Cur
zon, the former Parliamentary Secre
tary of the Foreign Office, and newly
appointed Viceroy of India, will not be
raised to the peerage before he goes to
India.
The health authorities have issued a
warning against the use of Americ'i
chewing gum, which is becoming the
rage among children in the. East Enu.
The authorities consider it more dan
gerous than the icecream which the
Italians sell in the street, and against
which there has been a rigorous cru
sade.
To-Day, which is now edited by
Barry Paine, instead of Jerome K.
Jerome, devotes pages this week to the
exposure of the alleged "Klondike
Fiasco," especially to the reported cor
ruption of officials. It publishes a let>
ter from a prominent Englishman who
says: "The police, land office, post
office, Gold Commissioner's office and
mounted police are all corrupt. The
Americans are having the laugh over
the British about pure government. I
would rather see the whole country
t,banded over to the Yankees than see
such a shameful state of affairs under
our flag."
Yachtsmen are delighted at the fact
that "big ships" have again been
chosen for the America's cup contest,
as this class of yacht promises to be
very strong here in 1899. Charles Day
Rose and the Duke of Abbruzzi,
nephew of the King of Italy, have both
ordered new ninety-footers.
British society is still scattered over
the country and continent. The Prince
of Wales landed on Thursday from the
royal yacht and will spend a fortnight
at Osborne.
The Queen, who is in excellent health,
witnessed the Bremomar gathering at
Balmoral on Thursday. Unusual inter
est was taken in the celebration, as it
was the fiftieth anniversary of the oc
casion on which the Queen first patron
ized the games.
The Donca.ster races during the week
attracted many fashionable people.
There were many large house parties at
Tranby Court, where the Wilsons are
again greatly to the fore. They took a
special train from Hull with a party
which included Lady Randolph Church
ill, the Earl and Countess of Essex and
the Duke of Roxburgh.
W r ith the reopening of the Haymarket
Theater with "The Little Minister" last
Saturday and the first performance of
the Kendalls' season at the St. James
next Thursday the London autumn sea
son will have fairly begun. But the
heat naturally is affecting the attend
ance at the places of amusement.
STOCKTON LAND DEAL
OF VAST PROPORTIONS
Eastern and London Syndicate Pur-
chases Victoria Island for
$320,000.
STOCKTON, Sept. 10.â One of the larg
est land sales in years has virtually been
made in this city, whereby John Herd,
the well-known promoter, has sold Vic
toria Inland, sixteen miles from this city,
to an Eastern and London syndicate.
Victoria Island is a new body of land
to most people. It was formerly a por
tion of Union Island, but has been sep
arated from that body of land by a canal
and was recently named after tile Eng
lish Queen. The island contains B*oo acres.
Some months ago Mr. Herd made ar
rangements with Williams & Bixler of
Union Island lor the reclamation of 13,000
acres of tule lands. By that agreement
it is understood that he was to get 8000
acres and the use of the other 5000 acres
for a period of live years free of charge.
He interested several persons in the
scheme and the work is now In progress.
Victoria Island has been made by the
cutting of a navigable channel through
a great acreage, and the whole domain
belongs to Mr. Herd, or did before this
sale was consummated. It is reported
that the purchase price is fixed at $40 an
I acre, which Involves a deal of $320,000 â
one of the largest in the county for years.
BRITISH GUNBOAT
AT SANTA BARBARA
Leander Stops to Coal After Fighting
for American Citizens at
Acapulco.
SANTA BARBARA, Sept. 10.â The Brit
ish gunboat Leander came into this port
at about 4 o'clock this morning for a sup
ply of provisions to last her until she
reaches Vancouver, where she will obtain
a fresh supply and coal. The Leander left
Esquimalt about three months ago on a
cruise to South American ports, and is
now on her return trip.
This is the boat which opened fire on the
natives at Acapulco when they were
butchering the American citizens there a
short time ago.
The last port she called at was Magda
lena. She reports having met the Al
batross, one of our auxiliary cruisers,
when near tho Straits of Magellan, a lit
tle over two months ago.
When the leander reaches Ksqulmalt
she will immediately go on patrol duty,
which she will continue for about three
months, and will then proceed to some of
the British ports in the Mediterranean.
Speuking of the late war with Spain one
of the officers said. "Why, that row In
Manila Bay was not a fight; it was simply
a walk-over."

CANCER 7
For humanity sake, and wishing to benefit
! all sufferers of Cancer and Tumor, I will state
that my di-ar mother after having tried various
â  means to be cured of Cancer finally yielded to
! the knife, and as a result succumbed to the
I Inevitable â deathâ and having a cancer myself
on the breast I was advised to try the knife,
also the plaster and electricity treatments,
each of which Is a failure. Having heard of a
simple and comparatively painless process for
their removal in this city, I tried it. I must
say I am positively and completely cured. , To
all those that have Cancer on Tumor I will
gladly tell of my cure, and this wonderful
method and refer them to many in this city
that have been cured by It If they will call
any afternoon except Sunday at my home, 204

DEAD HEAT FOR THE PLACE

DIVIDE SECOND MONEY.
Osculation, Ventoro and Rey del
Tierra Three 'Good Things"
Put Over the Plate at ths
State Fair Track.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 10.-The first
week's racing under the auspices of the
State Agricultural Society came to a
close with a most interesting day's sport.
As four favorites, one second choice and
v much-liked outsider were victorious,
the bookmakers must have been out and
Injured, even though the odds laid would
delight the heart of the average poolroom
keeper. The racing was exciting through
out and the fields of runners were larger
than during any day since the meeting
began. The crowd also was a large one.
A dead heat for place between Buckwa
and Scarborough in the Capital City
Handicap was one of the clever features
of the day's pport. Three "good things"
went through with a rushâ Osculation,
Ventoro and Rey del Tierra. Ventoros
name was incorrectly spelled last night
and all bets on him were called oft in con
nce. As those in "on the know" got
their money on at 8 to 1, and had to take
from 1 to 2 to even money to-day, there
was no joy in the souls of those that cut
thp watermelon.
Osculation was made a red hot favorite
for the opening event at six furlongs, be
ing played down from 2 to 1 to even mon
ey. Lost Girl was n^xt in demand at 11
to 5, Sport McAllister and Major Cook 2^
to l. and the others went at odds of 10 to
30 to 1. To a fair send-off Amasa essayed
to act as leader of the band and did so
past the half, with Mollie A and Oscula
tion well up. and Sport McAllister fourth,
a length and a half behind the favorite.
Mollie A was done for as the final turn
was reached and Osculation soon there
after took command. Half way down the
homestretch Sport McAllister looked dan
gerous, but Gouin could not help him,
and Osculation won all out by a length.
Sport McAllister second, a half length be
fore Amasn. Time. I:lsVÂ£.
The California Annual stakes, six fur
longs, net value to owner of winner $420,
had five starters and Jennie Reid for a
favorite, her price being 4 to 5, Obsidian
even money (6 to 5 most of the time).
Rainier 44 to 1, Faversham 15 and Alca
traz 3 to 1. To a rather poor start Faver
sham led. Hp was three lengths in front
Of Jennie Reid at the half-mile ground
and but a length at the three-quarters,
Obsidian about two lengths further away.
Pigpott had ridden Jennie Reid hard from
the forward of the rubber band.
The bunch was less than a furlong from
home when Jennie caught Faversham,
but she Just galloped the last fifty yards,
winning by two lengths. Faversham was
second, five lengths before the false
alarm. Obsidian. Time. 1:16.
The Capital City handicap, one mile and
a furlong, had four starters and Buckwa
for a first choice, his closing price being
3 to 5. Marplot was at 2 to 1, Scarbor
ough 2^> ai.a Grady 3 to 1. To a good
get-away Marplot took a slight, lead mo
mentarily, but Buckwa was in front be
fore a quarter of a mile had been trav
ersed, and held his slight advantage for
nearly seven furlongs. Turning for home
it was Scarborough first by a head,
Buckwa second, a length before Marplot
and Grady, head and head. Grady was a
neck in front half way down the home
Ftrotch, and. coming away the last part,
won handily by three lengths. Buckwa
and Scarborough, all out, made a dead
heat of it for the place. Marplot was a
popr last. Time. 1:56.
Next si* two-year-olds lined up for a
five and a half furlong run. Ventoro, a
new one from Rancho del Paso, was made
a 1 to 2 favorite, and Magdalenas was
next In demand at 2^ to 1. Gold Fin and '

all he could do to beat Lomo for plact. Nonchalance- outolaaetd.
Leo Vertner were at 4 to 1, Cleodora 7
and The Miller 10 to 1. Ventoro got away
in the lead and on the fly, and though
Magdalenas got up to him nearing tne
three-quarter mark, Ventoro drew away
again with slight urging and won easily
at the end by three lengths, Magdaienas
second, as far from The Miller. Leo Vert
ner, who had run prominently for over
three furlongs, was fourth. Time, 1:10.
Morlnga was a 1 to 7 favorite for the
seven and a half furlong selling race.
After a good Btart had I aen made and
Stoic had led for about three-sixteenths
of a mile Moringa took command, and
was not thereafter headed, though Ocktu
ruck got up when they had gone a little
over a quarter of a mile, in the home
stretch Ockturuek tired and Moringa won
with ease by ten lengths. Roulette Wheel
was second easily, two lengths before
Ockturuck. Time, I:39â a slow race.
For the last race, seven and a half
furlongs, Harry Thoburn was a 7 to 10

start Lomo went into the lead and held
it past the quarter by two lengths, past
the half by one length. Thoburn, who
had been lying second, passed into the
lead before the three-quarter pole had
been reached, but Rey del Tierra, whose
jockey had been at the bat from the
quarter pole, came fast on the outside and
won handily at the finish by three lengths,
Thoburn beat Lomo a neck in a hard
drive and through good riding. Time,

The State Agricultural Society has en
gaged an expert to judge all the live
stock entered for premiums at the fair.
His name is James Whitcomb and he
hails from Hillsboro, Oregon. Heretofore
there have been three judges to pass on
each class of animals entered in com
petition. Mr. Whitcomb, whose work
began this morning, is very thorough, and
explains the defects of each animal by
means of a blackboard. His first labor
was on Durham cattle, and those present
were charmed with his manner of pass
ing on. the merits and demerits of those
trying for the liberal prizes. It is ex
pected that it will take close figuring to
pick the best of the Jerseys.
The substitute for race No. 59 will be for
2:14 pacers, mile and repeat. This event
is booked for next Friday.

GENERAL SHAFTER

BATES FOR CAMP WIKOFF
SIGNIFICANT OFFICIAL VISITS
AT WASHINGTON.

Friends,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept 10.â A special to
the Herald from Camp Wikoff says:
Camp Wikoff will ccc no mow of Gen
eral Shatter. General Bates, who is
now in command, received orders from
Washington to-day ihat General Shaf
ter had been placed in command of the
Department of the East, with head
quarters at Governor's Island GeneraJ
Shatter will enter his new command
at once, and General Bates will remain
here.
The Washington correspondent of the
Herald telegraphs: General Shatter
this morning called upon Acting Sec
retary Meiklejohn, upon General Cor
bln in an adjoining room and then
upon Major General Miles. Then Gen
eral Shafter called upon the President.
The conference between General Shaf
ter and General Miles was apparently
most cordial and touched for the most
part only upon the phases of the Cuban
and Porto Rican camoaigns. Although
the main object of General Shafter's
visit to Washington was to present his
report of the battle of Santiago, he has
not yet been able to complete the docu
ment and will not present It before
Monday.
Word was sent by me to General
Shafter that he was reported in the
morning papers as saying that General
Miles was present at Santiago only "as
a visitor." General Shafter sent an ex
plicit denial of this statement, and Ma
jor Miley said he had had no interviews
with any one and refused to consider
any question touching upon any point
between himself and General Miles.
Major Miley said the two generals were
the best of friends, and that there was
no cause for this agitation in connec
tion with them. General Shafter will
remain here at least until Tuesday and
perhaps longer at the solicitation of
friends, though ke desires to get back
to Montauk as soon as possible.

THE HARES WERE
GAME AND FAST
They Know the Escapes
and Win Out Easily.
SOME FAVORITES THAT LOST
MUCH MONEY ON FOR FREEDOM
AND ROSETTE.
The Great Championship Stakes Will
Be Run To-Day at Ingleside
and Union Parks-' â A
Fine Card.
The selling stakeâ ttoe run down of
which was decided yesterday at Union
Coursing Parkâ resulted in many surprises
for those who pretended to know a good
thing in the coursing field.
The shortenders had a gala day and the
moÃt pleased men of the large gathering
that was present were the soldier boys,
who played the short end of each course.
The first upset of the day was when
the much fancied Magic was bowled over
by the llttle-thought-of Bendigo. Magic
sold at $6, while Bendigo found but few
takers at $1. Magic led for quite a dis
tance, but the hare was a traveler, and
when near the escape Bendigo forged
ahead and scored a go-by just as Bunny
passed out of sight. The judge declared
the course a "no go," but in the run off
Bendigo led to the hare, took first turn
and then it was give and take until Ben
digo killed, winning the course.
The second upset to the talent occurred
when Sportsman, on the $5 end, was sent
to his kennel by White Tip. who had few
supporters at $1 a ticket. White Tip ran
a fairly good course.
Then came the defeat of the Denver
dog, Bryan, by Sylvanite. Bonfire, an
other Eastern dog, was played heavily
to win, because of some alleged great
performance he was credited with hav
ing made, but he proved himself to be the
worst kind of a duffer, and was easily
beaten by Burlington.
Golden Kaglc defeated the favorite
Kathleen handily. This was a a .to 1
shot. Arapahoe disposed of LlÃsak. a 2
to 1 favorite. The most amusing feature
of the day's sport was the three "no go"
courses between the duffers Jimmie Hope
and Defender. Neither dog was able to
exercise any of the hares they met, but
the judge finally decided in favor of De
fender on the ground of "speed" shown
to the hare.
Peaceful Glen, who sold at $1 as against
U on Eclipse, disposed of the favorite in
a good long run to the lower escape. The
soldier boys maae quite a "raise" on this
course. Quite a number of "no goes"
resulted in the run down. The results
were:
Belling stake, the run downâ BemJalong beat
Ruth Ashmure; Babe Murphy beat Lucerne>
Bendigo beat Magic; Van Knapp beat Wild
flower; White Tip beat Sportsman; Sylvanite
beat Bryan; Revenge beat White Chief; Little

This stake will be finished to-day, as
will also th i champion stake, which will
be the great and much looked for event
of the afternoon.
The winner of the selling stake looks
like either Gilt Edge or Seldom.
NOVATO WINS A STAKE.
A Number of Promising Young Sap
lings Ran Their First Course
at Ingleside Yesterday.
Yesterday was the hares' day at the
Ingleside Coursing Park, as they seemed
to have charmed lives. In the sapling
stake In the first nine courses only one
hare was killed, the others reaching the
escape safely, and an official remarked
joculary, "That this was only a 'warm up'
for the harea and that the sharp sprint
they made yesterday would only make
them the more fit for the run to-day."
The sport yesterday was excellent, and
as the atmosphere was clear from fog the
spectators were enabled to watch every
course to its finish.
The betting public was happy yester
day, as the day was full of surprises, in
several instances long shots winning, the
most notable being Master Mat at 7 to 1,
defeating Thad Stevens after the latter
dog had led up for a considerable dis
tance. Miss Dividends also aroused a
cheer from the short-enders, as the white
flag was raised announcing that the clever
little bitch had defeated the hot favorite
Matchless at the price of 3 to 1. Among
the other short-enders that earned their
followers' dinner money were Miss Phoebe
Torraine and little Dorrit. Kill Boy also
defeated Bell of Moscow at 6 to I, but
few had tickets to cash on the dog. as
the Belle of Moscow was considered a
moral cinch.
In the sapling stake the youngsters
made an exceptionally good showing,
Eleven Spot, Novato and Chief of Hill all
running well. Olympus was selected by
the wise ones to win the stal.e but the
dog was unlucky, being beaten in a short
course in the second round by Novato,
who made a drive and pick up. The stake
was finally won by Novato, the runner
up being Eleven Spot, the last course
being an easy thing for film, as Eleven
Spot was considerably weakened by hav
ing earlier In the day to run a couple of
very long and severe courses.

TO PRESERVE
CALIFORNIA'S
FOREST LANDS
U. S. Receiver Carter
Gives His Views.
FOREST RESERVATION NEEDED
THE NORTHERN PART OF THE
STATE WANTS PROTECTION.
A Proper Fire Patrol Should Be
Established and Steps Taken
to Check Waste of
Lumber.
The efforts of The Call to secure legis
lation for the better preservation of our
forest areas have met with full apprecia
tion In Shasta County. Lloyd L. Carter,
the United States Receiver for the Shasta
Land District, who is now enjoying a hol
iday in this city, states that the residents
of Shasta and Redding highly approve of
the protest entered by The Call aganlst the
poisoning of the country roundabout by
the fumes from the Keawick smelters.
Certain business people in Keswlck and
Redding do not like to admit the truth,
because it might be prejudicial to their
commercial interests. But the majority
of the residents, and especially the fruit-
growers and ranchers, would welcome a
law compelling the Mountain Mining
Company to consume its sulphurous
fumes, which at present are devastating
the whole countryside.
"My land district,' said Mr. Carter,
"covers the whole of Shasta County, as
well as p'ortlons of Siskiyou, Trinity, Mo
doc, Lassen and Tehama. It includes most
of the pine belt around Mount Shasta,
where there are vast areas covered wuh
magnificent sugar and yellow pines, let
if torest destruction goes on at the pres
ent rate the whole area wiTl be devastated
in less than forty years. With modern ap
pliances and the milling machinery now
In use the lumber is cleared off at a terri
fic rate. Besides, there is a great amount
of wasta. Only the best is taken and the
worst is left behind. I met a lumberman
from the East the other day, and he was
simply astounded at the way our forests
are being taken up. In the Eastern States
they use every particle of wood for one
purpose or another. Here they only take
the best of the tree, the lower portion,
and leave the rest to rot on the ground."
Mr. Carter thinks that much good
might be accomplished if the Federal and
State governments could agree upon a
common ground of action. "The establish
ment of an efficient fire patrol," he re
marks, "would in Itself do a great deal
of good. It Is already an Indictable of
fense to start a forest fire, but owing to
the lack of supervision, convictions can
not be secured. Then the State might es
tablish nurseries on some of the vacant
land it owns, where experiments could be
made with all kinds of exotic trees to as
certain which were most suitable for prop
agation in this climate. Also steps could
be taken to check waste, and to prevent
the destruction of trees under a certain
size. Land which has already been dev
astated could be replanted with the kind
of timber most suitable to the locality,
and where the young pines are coming up
naturally they should be thinned out, so
as to insure an even crop of timber.
Measures of this kind are necessary, if
only to preserve the rivers of the State.
Owing to the felling of the timber and the
frequent bush fires much of the rainfall
fails to reach the rivers, and I know of
many springs in Shasta County which
have dried up from this cause. There
should be forest reservations all over the
State Instead of merely In one portion of
it."
It is a singular fact that although the
Federal Government has reserved large
areas of land in the southern portion of
the State for forest purposes, not a sin
gle acre has been protected north of San
Francisco. J. M. Gleaves. the United
States Surveyor General in this city, fur
nishes the following list of Federal tim
ber reservations in California, all of
which, it will be noted, are south of San
Francisco: San Gabriel, 573.04S acres;
Sierra Forest, 4.079,360 acres; San Bernar
dino, 731,17<> acres. Arahueo Canyon, 49,
7fiO acres: San Jaclnto. 664 Â«78 acres; Stan
islaus. 70F..340 acres: Pine Mountain. 1.735.
083 acres. The total area thus reserved
is no less than 8,538,445 acres.
"What we want." insists Mr. Carter, "Is
to get some of the rich timber lands in
my district reserved. We have to deal
with an area of over 3.000.000 acres, and
there 1b plenty of room for a forest res
ervation. That 1b If steps are taken in
time. We hope soon to get a forest res
ervation proclaimed In Lessen County,
and also one In Siaklyou."
AMATEURS HELD
THE RIBBONS
Exciting Harness Racing
at Ingleside.
A DRIVER WAS DISQUALIFIED
BETTORS WHO LOST MADE A
DEMONSTRATION.
Correct, the Favorite, Swerved^ Cut
ting Off Newman, and in Con
sequence Was Placed
Last.
The closing day's sport of the Golden
Gate Park Driving Association meeting
did not attract so large an attendance as
on Admission day, but the sport through
out was of the highest class. The pro
gramme of six races was not completed
until dusk.
The third race provided the Bensation
of the day in the disqualification of Cor
rect, owned and driven by Nick Hottua,
a shock-headed lad of 16 years. He was
second In the first heat, won the second
and finished first in the third heat, but
was disqualified. The horse has a bad
habit of swerving-, and the youthful
driver was repeatedly cautioned by the
judges. This did not seem to have the
desired effect. In the third heat the
driver of Maud Newman protested, claim
ing to have been cut off in the stretch.
The Judges allowed the protest, placing
Correct last.
The decision raised a storm of disap
proval from the holders of tickets on Cor
rect. They gathered about the stand and
hissed Judge Crowley when he announced
the result. The majority of the bets made
were on Correct to win.
In the first heat of the race the horses
scored many times. Driver Callan with
Carry C being chiefly to blame. The

horses were finally dispatched to a strag
gling start. It was Fanadma all the way,
the brown mare having a lead of four
lengths at the half, which she Increased
Indefinitely. Correct broke badly at a
critical point of the race, finally finishing
second.
The second heat was won by Correct
by four lengths, pulling up. It was any
body's race up to the last quarter, when
Correct came on an<! won, Fanadma tir
ing badly in the stretch.
Correct was played to win the third
heat as though there was nothing else
to it. He led a couple of lengths at the
quarter, but down the backstretch waa
lapped by Fanadma. They went to tho
half like a double team. In the home
stretch the leaders were joined by Maud
Newman and Azabia. The result was in
doubt to the Judging post, where Correct
just won out. The judges gave the heat
to Maud Newman, the second horse, dis
qualifying Correct for cutting her off.
The final looked a certainty for Correct.
He opened at 1 to 3, Newman 2 to 1, and
Fanadma 5 to 2. Soon after the start
Correct broke, and the race seemed to be
between Fanadma and Maud Newman.
Once Correct settled down to his stride
and he closed the gap rapidly, but his
pilot commenced to drive too late. Ha
was finally beaten half a length by Maud
Newman. Fanadma third. The summary

After receiving the nomination Lau

ARGUMENTS BEFORE BROWN
SECRETARY TAKES THE CASE
UNDER ADVISEMENT.
Fusionists and Mlddle-of-the-Road
sters Disagree as to Which
Should Be Styled tha
"People's Paxty."
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 10.â Secretary
of State Brown to-day listened to ar
guments as to which faction of Popu
lists of this State should have party
designation on the tickets to be used
at the approaching election, and at the
close of the hearing announced that
he would give his decision on Monday,
or after he had completed an investiga
tion into the facts of the case as laid
before him in documents filed by the
warring factions. There Is a possibil
ity that a decision may not be reached
Monday and not until witnesses have
been heard touching the points in
volved.
Thomas V. Cator, representing the
middle-of-the-road Populists, put in
the time of the morning session, held
in the Supreme Court chamber, in
reading the petitions of his faction. He
laid stress on the contention that there
was no objection or protest in the Dem
ocratic State Convention against fu
sion, or in the Silver Republican con
vention, and that by reason thereof the
fusion candidates will, in any event,
have a place and designation or desig
nations upon the official ballot, even
though they be not allowed the right to
use the name "People's party," and
without the circulation of a petition;
whereas, if the candidates of the
straight out Populist convention were
denied the right to file their certificates
of nomination under the name "Peo
ple's party," they could have no place
upon the official ballot, without the
great expense of a petition nor in any
event unless they misrepresented them
selves by taking a name which would,
under the circumstances, be false, as
they were not and never had been any
thing but members of the People's
party.
This afternoon, when arguments were
entered upon, Cator said the subject
involved legal consideration principal
ly, and that the Secretary of State
would have to look at the case simply
in its legal phases. He held that the
law clearly stated that a convention
was an organized assemblage of dele
gates, representing a pqlitical party
which at a general election had polled
not less than 3 per cent of the votes
cast in the State. Now the question
was for the Secretary of State to de
termine, which party held the conven
tion as contemplated by law. Was it
the straight out Populists or the fu
sionistst The Populists called the
convention and it has been decided that
the regularly constituted State com
mittee of a party was the trustee or
agent of that party, bound to keep
within and never to exceed the powers
piven it by the party creating it. When
this agent, Cator continued, kept
within the scope of legal authority its
actions were binding. Union with
other parties having a uniform plat
form was permitted by the call, but not
union with any party whose platform
disagreed with, or contained planks not
included in, the platform of the origi
nal Populist party organization. That
convention only is legal which at its
conclusion may have its labors certi
fied by the chairman and secretary.
E. S. Van Meter of Fresno r.nd Judge
E. A. Bridgford of San Francisco ap
peared on behalf of the fusionist wing
of the Populist party. Their contention
was that the certificate of nomination
of James G. Maguire as the Populist
candidate for Governor and various
other candidates mentioned in the cer
tificate of nomination by a majority of
the delegates of the regularly organized
convention, called together under the
call of the State Central Committee of
the Populist party of the State, and
that the certificate signed by D. T.
Fowler as chairman and Carlton H.
Johnson as secretary was a certificate
of nomination made by a pretended
convention of delegates who constitut
ed a minority of the delegates to the
regularly called State convention of the
Populists, and that T. W. H. Shanahan
and the other candidates mentioned in
the certificate were not candidates of
the regularly called convention of ,the
Populist party of the State of Califor
nia, but were attempted to be nomin
ated by a minority of delegates to the
regularly called State \ convention,
which minority withdrew from the reg
ularly called State convention after
having acted with the majority thereof
as set forth.
Interested witnesses to the proceed
ings were Seth Mann, chairman of the
Democratic Central Committee, and J.
C. Spelling of San Franci3co. Spelling
and James H. Barry are contestants
for designation as Democratic candi
dates for Congress of the Fourth Dis
trict in San Francisco. Barry will be
up with his forces on Monday, when
the case will be heard.

Vries in Congress were applauded. The

vention also expressed its approval of the

The Democratic County Central Com
mittee met to-night to arrange for the
primaries and conventions. There was a
good representation from all parts of the
county. Alameda was cared for by Judge
St. Sure and T. C. Stoddard.

Logan represented the wards In the city
of Oakland.
From Eden Township came A. Decamp,
John Obermuller, Carl Iverson and E. J.
Holland, and from Oakland Township
John Cavanagh and T. H. Murray.
Chairman Brosnahan stated that the
flrs; business was the framing of the call
for the convention. It was decided to ap
portion the delegates by wards and town
ships on a basis of one delegate for every
fifty votes and major fraction thereof cast
in 1896 for J. W. Martin for Presidential
elector.
This apportionment provides for the fol
lowing number: First Ward, 591 votes,
12 delegates; Second Ward, 741 votes, 15
delegates; Third Ward. 677 votes, 12 dele
gates; Fourth Ward, 600 votes, 12 dele
gates; Fifth Ward, 415 votes, 8 delegates;
Sixth Ward, 613 votes, 13 delegates; Sev
enth Ward, 627 votes, 13 delegates; Ala
meda, 898 votes, 18 delegates; Berkeley, 685
votes, 14 delegates; Oakland Township,
618 votes, 12 delegates; Brooklyn Town
ship, 434 votes, 9 delegates; Eden Town
ship, 569 votes, 11 delegates; Washington
Township, 278 votes, 8 delegates; Murray
Township, 576 votes, 12 delegates. Total,
166.
Primary or club elections will be held
in the townships of the county and wards
of the city of Oakland September 20, and
there shall be no enrollment after 9 p. m.
on September 19.
The convention will be held in Germanla
Hall September 24. opening at 10 a. m.
The test for voting at the said election
will be as follows:
"I am a Democrat and will support the
nominees at the election to be held on the
Bth day of November, 1898."
It was suggested that it were decided to
fuse with the Populists. Democrats under
the test would not be bound by
their oath to vote for any but strictly
Democratic candidates. R. M. Fitzgerald
evidently remembered the fusion that did
not fuse in Alameda County two years
ago, for he said: "It might be construed
that way, but some of them want mighty
little to absolve them from voting the
ticket, anyway."
It was ordered that a roll of member
ship in the respective wards of the city
shall be opened daily for at least five
days before the 19th of September. The
election of delegates in " Berkeley and
townships of Alameda County will be
either by club roll or primary, as the com
mitteemen from the respective townships
may decide, and the election, if by pri
mary, shall be held between the hours
of 3 p. m. and 8 p. m. on the 20th day of
September. All elections are to be under
the supervision of the committeemen of
the respective wards and townships, who
have power to appoint all necessary offi
cers of election.
Owing to the many conflicting lines of
the Senatorial, Assembly and Supervis
orial districts a discussion followed as to
the distribution of delegates to the va
rious district conventions. R. M. Fitz
gerald stated that their good friends the
Republicans had failed to find a remedy
for the conflict, and it was decided to let
each committeeman adjust matters for
the best in each case. C. M. Burke, a
committeeman from the Second Ward,
reported that there was some friction in
his district. He said he had always be
haved himself as a gentleman and rather
than not have things run Bmoothly he
would resign. Burke spoke with some
feeling.
Chairman Brosnahan said he did not
desire to see a change, and Burke said:
"Well, I will put it to the houseâ Am I a
gentleman?"
"The chair entertains the motion," said
Brosnahan, and there was a yell of ayes.
"It is the unanimous vote of this com
mittee," said the chairman, "that Mr.
Burke is a gentlmean. Mr. Burke, you
will please remain on the committee' â
and Mr. Burke assented.
The question of fusion was not brought
before the committee, but Mr. Laymance
said that he had some ideas on the sub
ject that he would divulge later.
Alameda Silver Republicans.
OAKLAND, Sept. 10.- The Silver Re-
publican county central committee met
at its headquarters, wl Ninth street, to
night and arranged for postal primary to
elect delegates to the county convention
and also appointed conference and cam
paign committees.
FUSION DEFEATED IN
MONTEREY COUNTY
Democrats Adopt a Middle-of-the-
Boad Policy by a Vote in
Convention.
SALINAS, Sept. 10.â The Democratic
county convention assembled at the opera
house to-day. During all of last night
and this morning caucuses of Supervis
orial district delegates were held and
plans arranged. Reports that attempts
would be made to break the prearranged
slate became verified when the conven
tion was called to order by B. V. Sar
gent, chairman of the county committee.
A test vote was taken on temporary
chairman, which resulted in the defeat of
the courthouse ring.
When the committee on permanent offi
cers and order of business reported
they wanted a committee of five ap
pointed to meet a like committee of
Populists on September 15 and fuse
with them on Assembleyman, claim
ing this would be acceptable, and the
Populists would swallow the balance of
the straight Democratic ticket. Immedi
ately a dozen delegates had the floor,
claiming recognition. Hot words fol
lowed, various members speaking against
the project in plain language. Cheers
greeted every word spoken against fu
sion, and when it waÃ announced that
non-fuÃion had carried by a vote there
was great cheering, mingled with hoots.
During the speaking it was confessed
that no candidate had a chance of be
ing elected unless fusion was effected.
The nominations of officers then pro
ceeded. Great excitement prevailed while
the ballotÃ were being taken for Sheriff,
Assessor, Treasurer and Coroner. The
"push" seemed to have its forces well in
band and despite the /act that it had been
defeated overwhelmingly on the question
of fusion it carried out its programme
with only one exception â that of nominee
for County Treasurer, the ring candidate
being defeated. The candidates nominat
ed are:
School Superintendent â Mrs. J. E. Chop*
of King City.
Sheriffâ H. R. Farley, Gonzales.
County Clerk â J. D. Kalar, incumbent.
Assessor â W. A. Anderson, Incumbent,
Auditorâ W. R. Coner, Salinas.
District Attorneyâ J. H. AndrÂ«sen,
Salinas.
Recorderâ J. A. G. Adcock, Salinas.
Tax Collector â E. P. Alexander, incum
bent.
Treasurerâ J. A. Taylor, Salinas.
Coronerâ W. T. Barry, Salinas.
Assemblyman â F. P. Sells, Monterey.
It is admitted by Democrats and others
that the ticket is very weak and detracts
from the strength of the State ticket.

CREATION OF A NEW "CAMP"
SAN LEANDSO PREPARES FOR
THE CONVENTION.
New Combinations That Dispel All
Possibility of the Formation
of a Successful
Slate.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 10.
Just on the eve of a primary It is some
what significant that there should be a
split In the Army and Navy Republican
League. This body of men, which has
911 names on its roster, represents one of
the strongest political elements in this
city and has done good service in the Re
publican corps since it was organized.
Last night a new camp was established
under the leadership of H. D. Talcott In
his capacity as senior vice commander
fn-chlef of the State league. It is known
as Dewey Camp No. 19. Among the
charter members are J. C. Darnell, Phil
M. Walsh, R. A. Johnson, F. M. Farwell,
A. W. Remold, who is colonel of Dewey
Camp, W. E. Wallace, who is the major,
and about twenty others.
The parent league at a lively meeting
declared that the new camp is a bold at
tempt on the part of General Talcott to
steal the influence of the older body in
the State executive committee. Some of
the older members declare that the new
camp is simply a Joke , organized to
help Talcott in his right for city Justice
of the Peace.
San Lcandro is making great prepara
tions to entertain the Republican county
convention on the 19th inst. The local
Republican club has appointed the fol
lowing committees to handle the busi-
ness. â¢*:â ;">"â â¢â -.": .\:--'

The straight Populists of â¢ Alameda
County have fared very well at the hands
of the convention held at Sacramento
some weeks ago. This county has on the
State ticket the following: Douglas P.
Fowler of Alameda, Lieutenant Governor;
Green Majors of Alameda, Attorney Gen
eral; C. 8. Preble of Berkeley, Surveyor
General: 1 A. A. Bretz, Railroad Commis
sioner; Robert Stewart, Congress; W. R
Batten of Alameda, State Board of Equal
ization. _
If anything more were needed to show
the fallacy of the statement that a Re
publican slate is made up for this county,
ft is the latest combination that has come
before the public. This combination has
taken up Firm D. Hinds of the Fourth
Ward for Tax Collector In opposition to
Barber of Alameda, and also W. 8. Hax
low for Sheriff in opposition to RobÂ«ni ot.
Alameda. A. K. Grimm is also put up
for Auditor to prevent him taking the
Recordershlp possibly from C. H. Spear.
As this plan provides for the total exclu
sion of Alameda from representation on
the county ticket, with the exception of
E. K. Taylor for State Senator, it will
certainly force the island into a com
bination with some of the townships
which cannot fall to bore holes through
any alate that may be held up before the
convention.
The latest reported agreement between
candidates is that between Assessor DÂ«J
ton of the First Ward and Judge Allen
of the Third. Four years ago this com
bination would have been considered one
of the rarest of possibilities. Now it is
said that Judge Allen Is the choice of a
large element of voters whom he could
lead to the general strength of the Re
publican ticket. As Frank Jordan and
Harry Melvin are confident of winning
out in the Seventh Ward, the nomination
for District Attorney which Mr. Melvin
seeks will of necessity become a con
vention fight unless a new deal be made.
At present it looks as though the con
vention will be made up of Jrreconcilable
nut oni tne result or whu'n will be to
upset all combinations made before the
delegates assemble.
P. J. Keller, the Mayor of Piedmont, is
the latest candidate to announce that he
will run Independently for Sheriff.
Among the likely candidates being men
tioned by the fuslonists is Charles B.
Lloyd, ex-Chief of Police,
Percy B. Preble of Oakland, who was
nominated by the People's party for the
office of State Printer, has filed nis resig
nation with County Clerk Jordan.
FRESNO EXPOSITOR
NO LONGER DEMOCRATIC
Unterrified of the Raisin Center Dis-
gruntled Over the Loss of the
Newspaper.
FRESNO, Sept. 10.â The Weekly Ex
positor, which appeared this morning for
the first time since the suspension or the
daily, was issued as a Republican paper.
The local Democrats were very indignant
at the change of front of their former
organ, and this evening there was talk of
burning the paper in effigy. It contained
editorial notices of the Republican can
didates and urged the election of the very
men whom a few weeks ago it was con
demning in the severest terms. For
twenty-four years the Expositor was the
leading Democratic organ of this part of
the valley, and its change of politics was
a surprise to every one.
Tulare Populists Indorse Pace.
TULARE, Sept. 10.â The Populists of
the Thirty-seventh Senatorial District
held their convention , here to-day and
nominated Dr. H. L. Pace of Tulare. Pace
is the Democratic nominee. The fusion
spirit was not unanimous, the vote stand
ing 9 to 7 in favor of Pace.
CORBETT SAYS HE IS
IN FINE CONDITION
NEW YORK, Sept. 10.â In an Interview
to-day Corbett aald:
"I do not hesitate to say that my phy
sical conuition is entirely satisfactory to
me and my trainers. My trip to Ban
Francisco did me no harm whatever. It is
true that I took on a few pounds in
weight during that let-up In training,
but the effect of that increase may bo
rather beneficial than otherwise. It has
given me a little more honest flesh, and
I think I shall need the surplus between
now and October 15 to work upon. I
find that the break In routine did not
affect my wind or speed to any material
extent. To-day, I may Bay, I am back
to the form In which I left my training
quarters, and from this time on all my
work will be to the good. My trainers
agree with me in/ all this, and we are at
it with tha same old confidence."

MILLER'S "TIP"
WAS EVIDENTLY
NOT CORRECT
Unlikely More Troops
Will Goto Manila.
SO SAYS GENERAL CORBIN
IN ANSWER TO A TELEGRAM
FROM GOVERNOR BUDD.
Meantime the Work of Mustering
Out the Sixth and Seventh
California Regiments
Goes On.
YpÃterflay It was stated that Brigadier
General Miller had received a tip that
possibly all the remaining expeditionary
forces might yet be forwarded from San
Kranolsco â a portion to Manila and an
other to Honolulu. This became known
and of course raised the hopes of the men
at the Presidio. It seems, however, from
the following dispatches that General
Miller's tip was misleading:
SAX FRANCISCO. Sept. 9.
H. C. Corbln. Adjutant General I'nlted
Etatos Army. Washington: If any further
troops are needed for Manila I will consider it
a Fi'polal favor that the Sixth. Seventh and
Â£ighth California regiments be Klven an op
portunity for active duty.
JAMES H. BUDD,
Governor of California.
WASHINGTON. Sept. 9.
Governor Budd. San Francisco: It is not
thought probable that any considerable num
ber of troops more than are now at Manila
will be r*H)iiirt-.l there. H. C. CORBIN,
Adjutant General.
This evidently settles the matter so far
ni> Manila is concerned, and it is not be
lieved that the prospects for sending any
more troops to Honolulu a:e any more
encouruKiiiK. Meantime the work pre
paratory t<Â» mustering out the Sixth and
Seventh California regiments Is pro
gresslng aa rapidly as possible. There is
a bare pnpsU llity, however, that the mus
ter-out ordf r of these two regiments may
l>p revoked, and that they may be re
tained tn service until the peace treaty
â with Spain Is finally "signed, sealed and
delivered." President McKinley states
thai he, does ii"t oonslder that the wur
Js ended until that is done. It now turns
cut that the dispatch that was received
liv Colonel Baldwin, In which it was inti
mated that orders for the removal of
the troops to Honolulu might be promn!
gated from Washington within forty
eight hours, was from an unofficial
Bource, General Miller stated that he Is
ii'iv of the opinion that nothing will be
done until General Merrlam returns from
Honolulu to report upon the availability
of camping Bites f'>r the soldiers. No
one seems to think that the War Depart
ment will change the order to muster out
the Sixth and Seventh California regi
ments even if the other troops are sent
away in thp near future.
The three companies of the Eighth
Regiment, umicr Major Whitton, to rt?
lieve the Sixth, come over froYn Oakland
yesterday morning and went Into, camp
nt Fort Point near the old mortar bat
tery. The companies were brought over
upon th. McDowell, as was the one com
pany that was left for duty at Alcatraa
Island. The other companies of the Sixth
arrived and went Into camp at Fort
Point near the present battalion already
there.

unbearable. His trip was purely one of
pleasure.

FITZPATRICK
PROVED EASY
The Sand Crabs Bat Him
Unmercifully.
REALLY FEATURELESS PLAYS
THE ATHLETICS PLAY AN IN
FERIOR GAME.
The Result cf the Contest Was * T ever
In Doubt, Baltz's Gameness
and Sand Crabs' Work
Being Interesting.
By Joe Corbett
Mr. Fllzpatrick. that star pitcher, with
a reputation equal in some respects to
that of our National League masters,
met with a setback yesterday afternoon
at the hands of those fast-coming 9and
Crabs, and was oompelted to retire from
the field of hostilities after the game
was irretrievably lost. Mr. Reilly, the
premier second bflseman of the league,
succeeded him amid an avaianche of
hoots and groans, the result of the gloom
he cast over the territory known as sec
ond base by his rendition which might
be sufeiy termed "Mow not to play soc
ond base."
Mr. Reilly, however, despite the fact
that he claims no relationship witÂ». the
pitcher's department, acquitted himself
notably, as he did on a former occasion;
but, wlthul, his efforts came too late, as
hlÂ« predecessor had already met the fire
of the foe, who ln the future will ue a
much dreuded one, I have no doubt, so
tar as KUzpatrick is concerned.
It will be easily conjectured, therefore,
that Mr. FHzpatrick, in the baseball ver
nacular, was Just a trifle to the bad.
The expression, however, does not, 1 fear,
convey the proper conception of- his bad
ness, baseballically speaking, of course,
and to be more pointed or rather to come
to the point without discussion, 1 will say
that Mr. Fitapatrlck was hammered un
mtrclfully by thoee Sand Crabu, and
when he did finally condescend to retire
I, for one, was infinitely obliged by hiÃ
condescension. Yet, 1 must confess, that
1 entertained a rather wearied opinion
of his successor, Reilly, who, during his
predecessor's sojourn, gave a truly
amateurish exhibition of the national
game, the kind that will easily discour
age a pitcher, ajid did in this case, for
unfortunate Fltz, like all other knights
of the box, naturally expected his second
baseman to stop base hits and do great
things ln general, for Reilly has In tiie
past demonstrated his worth and ability.
Whether my conjectures ure correct or
otherwise the fact remains that Fiiz
pitched miserable ball, and to make mai
lers less complicated, the Sand Crabs de
veloped a terrific batting streak, which,
coupled with the ragged playing of Reilly
and other members of the support, made
the game one-sided and uninteresting, ln
a sense, as the victors were never in
doubt, they having an unconquerable lead
after the third inning, the score standing
at this stage 6 to U in their favor.
In the next Inning three more runs were
mude. and in the inning following two
more, which left the score registering 10
to 1 in their favor, and from this on the
game was baseball in name only.
1 cannot say, however, despite the
score, that the contest was entirely un
interesting, for it was not.
The Sand Crabe were ln elegant trim
and played one of those fast, hard hitting,
clever games, making up by the interest
they manifested ln the contest what It
lacked ln excitement.
They really played the best game I have
seen them play this season, and have ln
the past month Improved in almost every
department.
Their battery and base running were of
the pennant order, and the dashing spirit
apparent ln their every effort has gained
for them much applause.
It is really a pleasure to see them per
form; that Is, When they move as they
did yesterday, and if the other clubs
would make as much noise, and thereby
make up ln this manner what they lack
in the art of real baseball, I have no
doubt of their also winning the admira
tion of all.
There is no disputing the fact that a
lively manifestation of true interest in
I the outcome of Die game Is admired by
the fans.
Baltz, who did the twirling for the Sand
Crabs, displayed an unreasonable amount
of lively spirit, and ln consequence hurt
his ankle. It is not necessary to go into
the extreme while endeavoring to emerge
victorious, but even after condescending
to slide. Baits continued ln the game, and
this display of spirit and gameness, while
not meeting with the appreciation of all,
lor many considered htm too badly in
jured to play further, was, nevertheless,
greatly applauded.
With his Injured ankle, which must
have made pitching a most tedious task,
Baltz labored on, doing masterly work.
When his cohorts placed the game be
yond danger for him, he let up enough
to allow his opponents a few runs, but
never once did he permit them an op
portunity to rally.
His support, while not perfect, was truly
elegant. But few mistakes were cred
ited to them, which pale into insignifi
cance ln the face of Rellly's mistakes
alone.
Many long hits were sent to the field,
but Strieb covered himself with glory by
the way he handled five of them, all of
which were taken on the run, and one
in particular being captured only after
a noble effort.
The game was, therefore, interesting at
times, but all credit is due the Sand
' Crabs, for it wan their beautiful work
which held (he crowd the entire game.
The feature of the contest waa the poor
throwing of the Athletics, and the awful
mistakes of Reilly, the emergency pitcher.

PRESIDIO NOTES.
Punishment of Private Scruggs
of the First Tennessee
Regiment.
Private W. 11. EdwartJa, Company I,
Seventh California, and Private Jultus
Witthoff of the Steward Hospital Corsps
died at the Division Fieia Hospital yes
terday.
I/cave of absence for eight and ten daya
has been granted By General Miller to
Captains W. F. Steepy and J. M. Walker
of the Fifty-first lowa Regiment respec
tively.
The patrols outside of the Presidio res
ervation in the neighborhood of Green
and Baker streets were increased last
night to guard against any demonstration
upon the part or such soldiers as might
be inclined to be noisy or create trouble.
The findings of the court-martlaJ in the
case of Private Andrew W. Scruggs,
Company E, First Tennessee Regiment,
tried upon the charge of a^nault and bat
tery and conduct prejudicial to good or
der and military discipline, were approved
by General Miller yesterday. The court
sentenced Scruggs to three months' con
finement at hara labor, and advised that
this part of the sentence should be ex
ecuted at Alcatra* Island. He was also
Sentenced to be dishonorably discharged
rom the service of the United States and
to forfeit all allowances due him or about
ti) be due him. It will be remembered that
Scruggs was the soldier who struck Dan
Thomas on the head with an Iron bar
after he was ln the custody of an officer
and wa* being escorted to the Tennessee
camp. Lieutenant Hauserman of the
Twentieth Kansas Regiment, who was
counsel for Scruggs, has replied to the
letter written to General Miller by the
soldier. In which he denies that he aavleed
Scruggs to plead guilty. On the contrary,
he states that he told him to tell the
truth. He also declares that Soruggs Is

THE HARDYS
ARE CHAMPIONS
Easily Defeat O. Picher
and L. Freeman.
END OF THE TOURNAMENT
MISS MARION JONES WINS THE
LADIES' SINGLES.
Weihe and Adams Fall Victims
to the Superior" Playing
of Picher and Free
man,
The last day of the Pacific Lawn
Tennis Association's championship
doubles was not as well attended as
the opening, due no doubt to the early
departure of the defeated and their
friends who manifested no further in
terest In the tournament. There were
three matches left over from Friday,
the finals between Messrs. Freeman
aÂ«d Plcher and WVihe and Adams, the
championship event between the for
mer team and the Hardys and the la
dles' single championship, in which
Miss Marlon Jones and Miss Martin
contested. Freeman and Picher de
feaied Welhe and Adams, but when
they met the Hardys from Oakland
the pill of defeat was prescribed for
them. They took It with good grace
and went back to Palo Alto without
the crown, sadder but wiser men.
The same faces, the same expressions
of enraptured Joy emanated from the
grandstand that lines the courts, and
the same water pitcher did service as
of old. The only novelty of the day
was the new occupation which Code,
old In years but young ln looks and In
the ways of the world, took unto him
self. He fumed for some service. The
management refused to allow him to
direct the tournament or to stand on
the side lines, so he accepted the only
other occupation, that of lord chief car
rier of the Ice water. He was a com
plete success and hereafter will figure
in that capacity at all big tennis af
falrÃ. The ladle* commented upon his
grace as he presided over the water
pot, and his heart was glad.
It was a blistering day, as the feet of
the players will attest. When Picher
and Freeman stepped on the courts to
battle with Welhe and Adams, the
"ponies." the asphalt was almost red
hot. ThÂ« "ponies>" did wonders in the
first net. Every point was contested,
and for a moment there was a wave
of Joy spreading over the faces of the
California Club supporters. Game by
game the score advanced until it was
five all. Then the Stanford men brush
ed up a bit and won ever- vantage
game until they finished the match at
10â8. The score read 9âB, 40â30, in fa
vor of the Beasoned team from Palo
Alto. Freeman smashed the ball and it
hit Adams outside the court, but ac
cording to the ruJes of the game the
point was given to the smasher, and
that ended the set.
Picher and Freeman won the second
set, 6âl.6 â 1. This took the courage out of
Weihe and Adams and they lost the
third set.
Then society put on mourning, for
the "ponies" are beloved by the old
and young of the elect.
In the morning Miss Marion Jones of
Nevada and Santa Monica struggled
with. Miss Martin In the finals of the
ladles' tournament. Miss Jones started
a pace which Miss Martin could not ap
proach. In three straight sets the
young lady from the Silver State set
tled the hopes of Miss Martin. The
score was 6âl, 6â2, 6â2.
The championship match was as
pretty an exhibition of tennis as has
been seen in this State. The Hardys
never played better ball In all their
glittering career. This was due in a
great measure to the weakness of their
opponents, Freeman and Picher, who
served as subjects for the Hardys' clev
erness. The three sets were won by
Sumner and Sam Hardy, 6â2,6 â 2, 6â2,6 â 2, Â« â 3.
Stanford's tennis blood will be en
riched by the presence of Sam Hardy,
who has entered that college.
Freeman showed great Improvement
in his playing, especially in his high
smashes. Both he and Picher played
remarkably good tennis. The "pony"
team in the first set with Picher and
Freeman won the applause of all, Welhe
playing the better game of the two.
With maturity and judgment, Weihe
and Adams should develop into one of
if not the strongest team on the coast.

CAME ACROab THE BAY
Two Battalions of the Eighth
California Regiment Have
Left Camp Barrett.
CAMP BARRETT, Sather Tract. Sept.
10.â Colonel Henshaw, the staff, head
quarters, band and eight companies left
Camp Barrett this morning at 10:30. As
the time for departure drew nigh the offi
cers gathered about headquarters; the
band drew near; the Hag was alowiy low
ered to the strains of a national .Hymn, >
and the parting companies and Lieuten- :
ant Colonel Cairingtons battalion, which
tarries behind a lew days, bid each other :
goo<l-by. The parting scene -was really
touching, for the men have been a most
harmonious and contented lot of soldiers, i
Three cheers were given for the officers;
and then the two battalions marched to
the tune of "The Girl 1 LÂ«ft Behind Me"
to the train. Before the two battalions
left camp Colonel Henshaw took occasion !
to refute the statement made by a San i
Francisco paper in last evening's Issue.
"It comes at a time when it cannot be i
answered very well." said the colonel. ,
"It is full of deductions that contain not ;
a grain of truth, and is full of lying in
sinuations about our 'pulls, 1 etc. It was
born of jealousy and was written by some
one who has failed In some of his plans. ;
Lieutenant Colonel Carrington Intends
to have the lines of tents left in camp
brought together at once, but the cook
tents will remain where they are. The ,
Red Cross and Catholic Truth Societies
will continue their good work with the
remaining companies; and the big Chris- |
tlan Commission tent is also left stand- ,
ing The officers, however, have no mess â 
tent now. and will probably eat with
their companies.
Corporal Harris, who was removed to I
the County Infirmary yesterday, suffering
from typhoid, is reported dying.
The organization of the band was a
big undertaking, and was successfully
accomplished by Lieutenant Colonel Car
rington but the latter is now in a dllem
ma as to how he is going to pay for the
instruments purchased. Many towns
Dromlsed to contribute, and Cntoo sent
ii r)lr )l Santa Rosa $60, San Jose $100. Grass
Valley $100. San Rafael $50 four little
Colusa girls $5 .7). In all the promotor
Of the band received $356 50. leaving a bal
ance duo to Sherman. Clay & Co. and
other firms of $244. Lieutenant Colonel
Carrington O. X.'d the bills and will now
probably have to "pungle up,' as he
puts it.

A PECK OF TROUBLE.
Admission Day Is Still Peing Ceie
brated on the Front and Ship
ping Is Quiet in Con-
The celebration of Admission day will j
not end on the water front until to-night, j
Little of anything was done In shipping j
circles yesterday, and the ship carpenters |
employed on the Willscott and Blairmore j
took advantage of the occasion to go out i
on strike. Even that incident did not J
raise any excitement, and Captain Dun
levy and a squad of officers from the Har
bor police station had their march to |
Spear street wharf for nothing. The
coasting fleet also took a day off. and not !
a wind-jammer hove in sight until late i
In the afternoon. Then the bark Merom
and ships Centennial and Indiana from the j
canneries and the schooners Sparrow, i
Mary E. Russ, J. G. North and Challen- ;
ger from lumber ports and Hawaii all
showed up off the Golden Gate at once
and made port before sundown.
During the past five years the harbor j
has never been as bare of ships as It ia j
to-day. The total tonnage of vessels on
the way is only 151..507. while in 1535 at this
time it was 340.070 tons. From this it will ;
be seen that the prospects for a big fleet â 
arriving before Christmas are not good.
Included in the tonnage "on the way"'
are the bark George F. Manson and the ]
schooners Actea and Stowell Sherman. ,
The Manson is 130 days out from Sydney,
N. S. \\\, and 40 per cent reinsurance is
being paid on her. The Actea is IP" days
out from New York with a party of
Klondikers, and as they are stranded in
Rio de Janeiro the chances are she will
never come to San Francisco. The Sher
man is 253 days out from Boston, but her
gold hunters deserted her at Montevideo,
and there she is liable to remain. Other
vessels that are making long passages
are the steamer Morning Star, out 35.
days; bark C. D. Bryant, out 32 days, and ,
bark Mauna Ala, 21 days from Honolulu. â¢
There are at present In port sixteen dis- i
engaged vessels laid up in Mission Bay, I
Oakland Creek and at Sausalito, awaiting
better times. Of these one is a British
bark, one an Italian bark, two American
ships and twelve British ships. One of
these, the Thorniiebank, made the run
from Newcastle, N. S. W.. in 67 days, and
has not as yet discharged an ounce of her
Inward cargo. Captain McÃrlde says that
If something is not done soon 1. 1 will have
to purchase a couple of goats to keep the
grass from growing over the ship's bul
warks.
A couple of Berkeley students had their
Admission day outing spoiled by the river
steamer Sonoma. They chartered the
naphtha launch Petrel and Becured a man
named Fraser to Â«tlot them up the San
. Joaquin River. All went wen until the
excursionists were about fifty milea from
Stockton, and then the Sonoma came
around a bend of the river and bore down
on them. Fraser and the two collegians
Jumped for their lives and the Petrel
turned over, but did not sink. The river
steamer Droceeded on her way. and after
getting their boat into the tules the ship
wrecked holiday-makers made their way
to Jersey Landing- and took the steamer
T. C. -Walker for San Francisco. Tester
day they hunted up the owners of the So
noma* they are g-olnjr to bring- the Pe
trol tg the city and repair her. >â¢;
Captain Fellows of the British ship Wa
terloo will not forget Admission day in a
urry. His dog Snip got him. into a peck
of trouble, and it was only by the appli
cation of some hard cash that the matter
was straightened out. The captain Is a
Jolly good fellow, and is very fond of
dngs. in consequence half a dozen of
the animals find a happy home on thÂ«
g->od ship Waterloo. Snip, however, is
the pride of the kennel. He Is a Chow
dig. procured after a great deal of bar
tering and some tall swearing when Cap
tain Fellows was last in China. Now If
there Is one thing that Snip can do bet
ter than another it is flght. He 1b
ready at a moment's notice for a scrap
with anything that goes on four legs, but
his choice, if he has a choice, is a cat.
Since the Waterloo has been docked at
Lombard street wharf cats have disap
peared from the vicinity of Telegraph
Hill, and yet Snip does not bear any vlsi
ble signs of the conflicts. The hair on
his back Is as thick and as soft and
Filky %s a seal's, and a cat's claws do not
seem to be able to penetrate it. â â 
Well, on Admission day Captain Fel
lowa took Snip out for a walk. He was
nccompanied by Captain McÃride of the
: liebank and one or two others, and
thc-y wended their way in the direction
of Market street. Passing- alonp Kearny
Ftreet Snip spied a largre cat and made
for it. The- feline sunnlnsr itself In
front of a millinery store and nea.r to
a show case which had been temporarily
moved into the doorway. When the cat
paw the dog coming it jumped on the
Fhow case and arched Its back. Snip
didn't scare worth a cent, and jumped
on the show case also. As dog grabbed
cat the top of the show case broke and
let the animals down inside. Then for
five minutes there was nothinp to be
seen but flying fur. broken glass and
the dog and cat going round and round
like a whirligig. The owners of the mil
linery store wrunp their : hands . and
begged all and sundry to save their cat.
Captain Fellows called Snip, but Snip was
too busy to pay any attention, and the
crowd that blocked the street yelled with
excitement as first one animal was on
top and then the other.
At the end of the first round the fipht
was over. Snip was triumphant and the
cat was dead. Captain Fellows put- the
crooked end of his walkinp stick in
through the broken show case and pulled
Snip out by the collar. Before he could
>ret away, however, he received an ur
gf-nt reauest to go into the millinery
store. The gallant captain went In. and
was profuse In his apologies. They were
all accepted, but at the same time a de
mand for $12 50 damages was made, and
In spitr- of many protests It had to be
paid. Snip's shore leave is stopped, and
when Captain Fellows goes for a walk
now along the water front his pet Is left
chained up in the cabin.
The ferry steamer Oakland, after hav
ing now boilers put in and being thor

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1398.
YOUNG BUCK
DISINHERITED
Thomas Carter's Will
Filed for Probate.
IT CONTAINED A SURPRISE
FAILED TO REMEMBER HIS
OLDEST NEPHEW.
The Man Uho Started a Legal Battle
Finds He Is in Error When
the Document Is Pre
sented.
Toung William G. Black was In error
when he stated that ho believed he was
named as a devisee in the will of his
uncle, the late Thomas Carter, the mil
lionaire car builder of Newark. His name
does not appear in the will of hie de
ceased relative, which disposes of an es
tate valued at over $1,000,000.
Last Thursday Black filed a petition
in the Superior Court for special letters
of administration upon the rich estate.
In the petition he alleged that a brother
of the deceased, Martin Carter, junior
member of the firm of Carter Bros., car
builders, had a will, left by the dece
dent, in his possession, which he refused
to offer for probate. Young Black stated
that the deceased left no lineal heirs, and
that those who were entitled to the prop
erty were two brothers, two sisters, a
niece and a nephew of the deceased, he
being the last named. He alleged that
he was named in the will as one of the
legatees, and in consequence is anxious
that the estate be probated and distrib
uted to the heirs.
Although frequently requested, he says
that his uncle refused to offer the will for
probate and refused to disclose the nature
of the estate and its exact value. This
being the fact, the petitioner believed
that the estate was suffering great dam
age, and asked to be allowed to admlh
ister upon it, that further loss might be
prevented.
The will, regaraing which the petition
er displayed such anxiety, materialized
yesterday, and was offered for probate
by the accused uncle. It was written and
signed by the deceased, and was witness
ed by J. F. Leicester and W. N. Drown
of this city. Martin Carter and John Car
ter, both brothers of the testator, are
not mentioned as devisees In the will. All
bequests are made in one paragraph,
which follows:
"After the payment of all my just
debts and expenses of my last illness and
funeral, I give, devise and bequeath all
of the rest, residue and remainder of
the property and estate, real and per
sonal and of whatever kind and where
soever situated, which shall belong to
me, or to which. I shall be entitled, at
the time of my death. In equal shares,
and share and share alike, to my neph
ews, Thomas Newton Carter, Frank M.
Carter, Leland Carter and Martin Car
ter, the four sons of my brother, Martin
Carter, now residing In Newark, County
of Alameda. State of California; my
niece, Georgie Black, daughter of my de
ceased sister, Margaret BlÂ£ck, now re
siding at Newark aforesaid, and my
nieces Mary and Margaret, the two eld
est daughters ot my brother John Car
ter, who now reaide at Buffalo, State of
I New York. The two last mentioned were
born Carter, but are married, and at
present their names are not known to
me." The testator then provides for the
settlement of all his accounts, and re
quests that the assets of the estate be
negotiated in such manner that the prop
erty may be divided according to his
Martin Carter, who was accused by
young Black with having withheld the
will, la named as sole executor, to serve
without bonds.

FERGUSON IN TROUBLE.
V-
The Well-Known Starter Arouses the
Wrath of Montana Race Tracu.
Followers.
J. & Ferguson, the well-known race
horse starter, is in bad odor with the
people of Montana. It is openly charged
that he has "given the best of the start
to certain horses, and that he escaped
being mobbed a few days ago at Ana
conda was due to the presence of a squad
of police officers.
The trouble and the causes leading up
to it can best be gleaned from the fol
lowing extracts taken from a Montana
! paper:
"There were four horses entered for the
race â I Don't Know, Bill Howard, Omah
Wood and Quicksilver, and the distance
five and a half furlongs. In the pools I
Don't Know was looked upon as a sure
winner and sold at $40, Bill Howard going
at 523, Quicksilver $15 and Omah Wood
about the same. Quite a large number of
tickets were sold; in fact, the race was a
good betting one.
"The horses went to the post promptly
on time and made several breaks to get
away, but each time they were called
back by Ferguson. Finally, after they
had been endeavoring to start for fully
half an hour, the flag dropped with
Quicksilver fully six lengths in a flying
stcrt ahead of Bill Howard. Omah Wood
was two lengths back, and I Don't Know
two more back of the mare. A howl of
indignation at once went up from the
crowd In the grand stand and there
about, and it was evident that -ne delay
at the post was for the purpose of giving
Quicksilver a flying start, a la Maud
Ferguson in stakÂ« races. In a few strides
Quicksilver had increased his lead to sev
eral lengths, it having taken the others
'too long to get under way, and ai the
wire he was a length in advance of Omah
Wood. I DoVt Know was two lengths
bark of Wood.
"Shortly after the horses came In
Starter Ferguson alighted from his rig
and started for the Judges' stand, but
the people were mad and at once jumped
Ferguson to know why he had given tho
animals such a rank start. Ferguson had
littlf to say. and began to get out of
reach by ascending the steps of the
judges' stand. Frank Reed, who owns I
Don't Know, opened on him with a tirade
of abuse that made the air rattle and
Ferguson shake in his boots, and In a
second or two more than a dozen people
had joined Reed in their denunciation of
the starter. It was one occasion on which
Ferguson did not seem to be in "great
form," an expression frequently used by
a San Francisco correspondent in con
nection with him. When near the top of
the steps Ferguson turned about and
told Reed to get off the earth, but Reed
would not do it.
" 'You'll not run any more horses on a
track that I have anything to do with,'
said Ferguson.
" 'I don't know about that,' answered
Reed, in a manner Indicating that he
would like to get hold of the flying starter
for about a minute. 'You can t start
horses, anyway. You can rule me off
here if you want to, but I can run my
horses in other places and get a square
deal, too."
"At this juncture Trainer "Webb walked
up and remarked: 'Here, Ferguson, is
my badge. Take it and keep it. Take It
and rule me off.'
"Webb's face was white with rage, and
so were the faces of a hundred others
around him. He called Ferguson all the
pet names he could think of, and Fergu
son began looking for a higher point of
view. He appeared to be looking for an
elevator.
"Just then two women took a whirl at
Ferguson and roasted him to a brown
turn. One of them called him a dirty,
thieving rascal and a Sheepshead Bay cur,
and added that if she had a gun she would
blow out his brains.
"While the women and men were de
nouncing Ferguson, a uniformed track
policeman grabbed Webb and escorted
him out of the gate, but Webb kept up
his tirade of abuse just the same. In go-
Ing out at the gate he remarked: 'Yes,
a man has to stand and be robbed by a
gang of thieves and then robbed by a
the grounds for daring to protest against
a skin game.'
"The roast on Ferguson has been brew-
Ing for some time. No less than half a
dozen times since the Anaconda races be
gan, people say, he has given horses the
same kind of a start as that of yesterday,
especially his own animal, Maud Fergu
son, and people have noticed it. A few
days ago he started Scotch Rose in the
same manner, but the Rose faded before
reaching the wire and no great howl
was made about it.
"When the Butte contingent was re
turning home on the train that leaves
Anaconda at 8 o'clock last night the work
of Starter Ferguson was discussed, and
one woman, after remaining quiet some
time, smiled and stated that she had won
on Quisksllver, because Just before the
race she had received a tip that the ani
mal would win the race. Asked how she
had received the tip, she said that Fer
guson had sent word to a woman friend
In the grand stand to put her money on
Quicksilver, and the woman had told her
about It.
"This morning a Butte man who has
had considerable to do with race tracks
and likes to play the races said there
were many things In connection with the
races this year that looked bad. For in
stance, a good horse would win a race
easy and come out a day or two later
and be beaten by a lot of dogs, when peo
ple were playing their money on him."
The people of Anaconda claim that Fer
guson has been doing anything but what
was right In the matter of starting the
horses, and if he gets out of Montana
without violence he will be decidedly

MRS. ALLISON ARRAIGNED.
The "Wealthy Widow" of Bain's Mat
rimonial Agency in Court.
Mrs. Grace Allison, the "wealthy
widow" of Bain's matrimonial agency,
appeared in Judge Joachlmsen's court
yesterday to answer the charge of grand
larceny, preferred against her by H. C.
Franks, the miner from El Paso. Tex.
The case was continued till Tuesday, and
her bonds were reduced from $3000 to
$1000, or $500 cash. .Bain put up the cash
and phe was released from custody.
Franks obtained two search warrants
yesterday for the recovery of the
presents he had sent Mrs. Allison,
and later Detective Dillon recov
ered them from Hilbert Brothers,
saloon-keepers on Powell street, with
whom they had been deposited Friday by
arrangement. Franks may not prosecute
the case, but the police are urging him to
make an example of the woman.
The postal authorities will in all proba
bility proceed against her for fraudu
lently using the mails if the grand lar
ceny charge falls through.
Guilty of Libel.
The Supreme Court has affirmed the
judgment and sentence of the Superior
Court of Santa Clara County In the case
of W. W. Miller of the Illustrated World,
who was convicted of libel. The libel con
sisted of published reflections upon the
honor and Judicial integrity of Superior
Judge John Reynolds and Attorney
CharleÃ D. "Wright of that county. The
position of the defendant, that It was not
proved that he was the editor and pro
prietor of the sheet and responsible for
what appeared in its columns, had no ef
fect upon the higher tribunal, and he will
have to serve out the sentence of 150
days In the County Jail.
The Pace Was Too Swift.
Miss Alice Tolly, an old lady living at
620 Vallejo street, took a ride on the
"Rocky Road to Dublin" at the Irish
fair yesterday afternoon, but the pace
was too swift for her and she fell oft,
sustaining a nasty cut on the forehead.
She was taken to the Receiving Hospitf.l
where Dr. Bunnell stitched and dressed
the wound.

YUKON HAS NO
DEEP OUTLET
Word Received From
the Survey Party.
A CONTINUOUS BAR EXIST?
DREDGING BEQT7IBED TO AC
MIT OCEAN VESSELS.
Captain Pratt Will Return to This
Port a Vain Search,
for a Deep Chan
nel.
The latest advices received in this city
from the Government survey party at the
mouth of the Yukon are to the effect that
failure has attended the effort to discover
an entrance for deep sea vessels. It is
now believed that no such entrance ex
ists and that before the Yukon can be
made naviguble for ocean craft, consider
able dredging will have to be done on the
bar which cuts Bering Sea off from the
deep waters of the river.
This news will prove a great disappoint
ment to all persons interested in the de
velopment of Alaska. For a long time
past there has been a widespread belief
that a so-called "true mouth" existed,
through which large steamships could en
ter the Yukon. Once in the stream it
would be an easy matter for them to
ascend nearly SOO miles, regardless of the
fluctuating stages of the river, which
maintains an average width of ten miles
to the lower ramparts and a depth vary
ing from 40 to 150 feet. By using this
water highway up to the Tanana and
Nulato, supplies could be placed in the
heart of Alaska almost as cheaply as
though shipped to St. Michaels. Such
facilities would mean an enormous devel
opment of mining industries, inasmuch as
many claims which are now unprofitable
on account of the high prices charged for
supplies could be worked to good account.
Moreover, plentiful supplies In Central
Alaska would mean an enormous increase
In the amount of prospecting done. Ex
perience has shown that river steamboats
on the Yukon are expensive and unreli
able.
It was with a thorough understanding
of these facts that the United States
coast and geodetic survey office outfitted
a party last spring to go to the mouth of
the Yukon and make a careful survey
and ascertain whether or not the rumored
deep sea entrance was a reality or a
myth. Captain Pratt had the work in
charge, and since beginning nearly the
entire area has been covered but without
result. A uniform bar appears to exist
crossing all of the various outlets, with
about six feet of water on it at high
tide. This bar is of soft muck and varies
from a quarter to a half mile in width.
It is apparent that the bar originated
through the long continued deposit of
river sediments. In fact, it has been
found that the sea itself has been partly
fillfid up by the sediment for some dis
tance out from the bar. The deepest
water exists toward the southern outlets.
PROBABLY A SUICIDE.
Con O'Neill Cut His Throat and
Jumped Off the End of a i
Wharf.
Boatmen D. Fitzgerald and H. Peterson
while enjoying a row on the bay at 6:45
o'clock yesterday morning found the body
of a man with the throat cut floating near
the end of Powell Ptreet wharf.
The body was taken to the Morgue and
the Injuries were examined by Autopsy
Surgeon Gallagher. There were found a
gash three Inches long In the front of the
neck, severing th windpipe, and a cut
across the left wrist. Drowning was the
cause of death. The man had not been in
the water more than a few hours. The
only thing found about his person that
could serve to identify him was an em
ployes' time card of the Southern Pacific
Railroad Company, form 11, No. 4557, good
for passage between San Francisco and
Sixteenth street station and West Oak
land. -Tne name on the card was, "Con
O'Niel."
Deputy Coroner McCormlck Inquired at
railroad headquarters respecting the iden
tity of Con O Niel and received informa
tion to the effect that a man of that name
was a section hand on the Oakland mole
in-M. Nelson's crew. The indications are
that O'Niel committed suicide by first cut
ting his throat and then jumping oft a
wharf. "

ness head. He had a friend In the Hey- ,

home he was paying for on monthly pay- |
ments that Just amounted to what he had !
been paying but In rent. ' James followed ;
the advice of his Irlend and has since been j
enjoying a cozy, i comfortable â¢ home, that j
now ta almost paid for. John still pays his !
monthly rent and has-not- a thing show
for it. To all j who - have not a home and

CONFLICTING LAWS
CHECK THE RUSH
TO LAKE ATLIN
Miners Unwilling to Stake Out
Claims Under Present Con
ditions,
Doubt as to Whether the Diggings Are in British
Columbia or the British North
west Territory.
BY HAL HOFFMAN.
JUNEAU, Sept. 7, by steamship City
of Topeka to Victoria, Sept. 10.â The
Call's special emissary to the new pla
cer diggings near Lake Atlin has re
turned with a report of the difficulties
there, and the news that many of the
original stampeders have gone back to
the coast towns until the situation is
straightened out, so as to give all an
equal chance on the ground and enough
of the surface to make it pay to stay
there. The matter will be laid before
the British Columbia Parliament at
Victoria next winter and favorable ac
tion is expected. Any other kind of
action, it is clear from the expressions
of experienced and conservative min
ers who have returned, would result in
depopulating the new settlements of
all except a few who have rich claims
and checking, if not entirely stopping,
explorations for gold in a new and
promising region.
It is not a question of whether there
is gold on the new creeks. Nuggets
with a great deal more value in them
than in $10 pieces have been taken out
and are still being found in the sluice
boxes. From this the size runs down
to fine gold. The trouble is over the
width of the claims.
At first it was generally understood,
after a review of the maps and before
there was time for a further investiga
tion, that the lake, and particularly its
eastern shore, up which the new dig
gings are located, were in British
Northwest Territory. But the Gold
Commissioner for British Columbia,
Major Rant, asserted that the creeks
were in British Columbia and took
possession without much dispute. The
few British Northwest, police on the
ground made way before him and re
tired. There is still some assertion
that the region is in the same territory
the Klondike is situated in and a de
mand for a further official survey to
determine the boundary. The settle
ment of this question involves the own
ership of heaps of gold for those who
were on the ground among the first and
were fortunate enough to stake good
claims.
A creek claii.i in British Northwest
Territory is 250 feet 'ong and running
from rim to rim thre* feeet above the
water level. "Lnder British Columbia
laws a creek claim is 100 feet long and
running from rim to rim. It is thus
apparent why it is hoped around the
campfires of the small army on the
banks of the placid Atlin that the di
mensions of claims shall be dictated at
Ottawa and not at Victoria. At the
general cost of working a claim it is
contended that 100 feet is not sufficient
ground to make it pay.
This is the situation which has pre
vented development work on hundreds
of prospects on the surface of which
colors have been found, but has not
stopped the continuance of work on
claims which are already panning out
well. The number of such claims does
not now exceed fifty.
Though many â¢re leaving the dig
gings and the rush has abated, still a
large number of men continue to go in.
Concerted and organized action will be
taken to lay the case before Ottawa
as well as the Victoria Parliament.

THE SAN FKAJV CISCO CALL, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1898.
Kobert Moore, an experienced miner of
Juneau, says:
"I do not think the ground as a rule
is rich enough to work under the Brit
ish Columbia laws. Of course there are
now some claims that are paying con
siderably more than wages. On the day
I left Miller and McKinnon took out a
nugget which weighed $15 60, which is
the largest yet found. They employ
three men and clean up from 27 to 30
ounces every three days, which is
pretty good for a starter. This is one
of the first claims staked. I looked
over two of the best creeks.
"The action of the railroad hands
who have stampeded in from Skagway
Is outrageous. They overrun the coun
try like a wild mob, knocking down
stakes that had already been located
by those who had preceded them, and
putting up stakes of their own. They
were on top for a while, but were pretty
soon called down for this, in some in
stances very forcibly. When we came
out we met a good many men still go
ing In, but the starch is pretty well
knocked out of the general outlook by
the mining laws, and a disappointment
over the surface prospects.
"About 1000 men are in there now.
There will be a winter camp all right,
but I do not think it will compare with
Dawson. At the mouth of Pine Creek
the largest camp is located. A few
stores are selling provisions and there
are some tents where liquor is sold."
The Juneau expedition under the
leadership of Surveyor A. E. Johnson,
sent out by the Chamber of Commerce
on August 18 to discover a short trail
to Lake Atlin, has returned and re
ports success. The object of the Cham
ber is to run small steamers to the head
of the Takou inlet and river, twelve
miles away, and then put on a pack
train over a portage about forty miles
to the lake. Others who composed the
expedition were Messrs. Pond and Hill
and several Indian packers. The dis
tance up the inlet to the mouth of Ta
kou River is seventeen miles; then
there are forty-two miles of summer
navigation for small steamers to Ink
lin River or South Forks, thence ten
to thirteen miles of trail or canoe to Sil
ver Salmon River, thence forty miles of
dry level gravel portage to Lake Atlin,
which the expedition traversed by well
denned Indian trails in eighteen hours.
Pine Creek is then eight miles away.
There are three small lakes and lots of
game on the trail. Mr. Johnson said:
"From the Silver Salmon it is a low,
open country with no noticeable di
vide. We get fresh moose meat from
the Indians, and also had plenty of
berries. There are oceans of fine grass.
It is the best trail for cattle I know of
in this section. In my judgment It Is
the easiest and quickest route to Lake
Atlin. The total distance from Juneau
is about 111 miles. A first-class horse
trail from the head of navigation
could be made for about $2000."
Last night at a meeting of the
Chamber of Commerce steps were
taken to raise money for the purpose
of improving this trail. A letter was
read at the meeting from Portland,
Or., projectors stating the capital Is,
since the failure of the Rtickeen River
railroad, being interested to construct
a railroad over the Takou trail to Lake
Toslin. which has long been considered
one of the shortest and most practic
able routes to the headwaters of the
Yukon.

THE RINGSTERS.
Will Support the Republican State
Ticket â Stirring Speeches
Made at the Conven
tion.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Sept. 10.â The Good Gov
ernment League county convention
practically finished its work of select
ing a county ticket to-da^ and at its
conclusion resolved itself into a ratifi
cation meeting of the State Republican
ticket.
This is the first ratification meeting
held in Santa Clara County since the
nomination of Gage for Governor, and
many Republicans about town are
highly pleased with the advance , step
taken by the league to-day. The failure
of the Rea County Central Committee
to ratify the State ticket is accredited
to the turning down Â«-' Rea's man Aus
tin for Secretary of State.
Henry T. Gage and the entire State
ticket received much praise, and the
sentiment expressed showed that the
Good Government League intends to
make a hard fight for the State Repub
lican ticket in Santa Clara County.
Speeches were made by Judge J. R.
Lewis, S. P. Sanders and D. H. Bryant.
B. D. Murphy, a prominent Democrat,
who was present in the hall, was called
to the platform. He praised the Good
Government League for Its effective
work in county politics, and urged it to
go right on purging the party of gang
methods. The speaker was loudly
cheered.
The nominations made to-day were:
Sheriff, James H. Lyndon; Auditor, A.
L, Veuve; Recorder, T. W. Treanor;
Coroner, Martin D. Kell; City Justice.
COMMODORE KAUTZ
TO COMMAND THE
PACIFIC STATION
flssigoed to Succeed Rear Ad
miral Miller, Who Will Soon
Retire.
Washington Authorities Have Several F^easons
for Keeping a Strong Naval Force
in trje Far East.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 10.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: Commodore Albert Kautz,
commandant of the naval station at
Newport, R. 1., has been definitely se
lected as the successor of Rear Admi
ral J. N. Miller In the command of the
Pacific station.
The formal announcement was made
at the Navy Department to-day that
the battleships Oregon and lowa would
be sent to the Pacific Coast and at
tached to the station there, and ar
rangements for their voyage are being
made by the department. These two
developments are significant as indi
cating the importance with which the
administration now .views the Pacific
station. The authorities appreciate
that the questions which will arise in
the Pacific during the next two years
will be of a character requiring the
closest attention, and they have been
careful to get a commanding officer in
whose Judgment they could place Im
plicit reliance.
There is danger of trouble arising
with Germany in Samoa, although the
Berlin Government appreciates that it
will be in a minority in questions which
may arise in view of the apparent pol
icy of Great Britain to accept the view
of the United Stales In matters affect-
W. T. Aggeler; Township Justices, J.
T. Wallace and E. M. Rosenthal; Con
stables, A. G. Hinman and R. L. Hen-
inger.
Nominations for the following offices
were made at the last meeting: Su
perior Judge, A. S. Kittredge; County
Clerk, H. A. Pf later; Treasurer, E.
W. (,'onant; Assessor, L. A. Spitzer;
Tax Collector, W. A. January; Super
intendent of Schools, L. J. Chtpman;
Surveyor, A. T. Herrimann; Super
visor, First District, R. M. Phelps.
The ticket completed to-day is the
strongest ever placed before the voters
of Santa Clara County, and is certain
of election. It is anti-gang from top
to bottom, and its victory means the
dethronement of Boss Rea. With few
exceptions the ticket is that of the
Populists. Democrats and Good Gov
ernment League.
The County Committee of twenty
five selected by the Good Government
League met after the convention and
organized. E. A. Hayes was elected
chairman, W. H. Wright vice-chair
man, and H. G. Squier secretary. A
committee of five, consisting of E. A.
Hayes, W. H. Wright. J. R. Johns, J.
R. Lewis and S. P. Sanders, was ap
pointed to wait upon the State Central
Committee and urge the recognition of
their County Committee.
The removal of the Rea County Com
mittee is deemed advisable in order to
secure the election of the legislative
ticket. Republicans all through the
county favor this move. The Good Gov
ernment League has not named a leg
islative ticket, hoping the State Com
mittee will interfere with Rea's candi
dates and thus insure a Republican leg
islative delegation from Santa Clara
County. ___________________

CALTHOS, the Great French Remedy
5 DAYS' TRIAL TREATMENT SENT FREE
BY SEALED MAIL
No C. O. D. or Deposit Scheme
Jules Laborde, the great French physician,
has said: "The American uses up his health
to make money and then Is forced to spend ,
money in seeking to regain his health." True j
It is that the strain of business cares and the |
sexual excesses Incident to this nervous ten
sionâinherited or acquiredâ are fast wrecking I
the health of American men to-day. This !
alarming condition has long been fully under- j
stood by physicians and the greatest minds of j
the profession in this and foreign countries
have given their best efforts to meet It. It re
mained for France, the nation that leads the
world In scientific medical research, to dis
cover at last a specific that will supply to
the system those vital forces which men of this I
generation waste so wantonly In youth and I
early manhood.
Professor Laborde is the most eminent of all
his countrymen in this one great branch of
medical science. After many years expert- j
mentlng he discovered the preparation called
"CAI/THOS," which has created more talk
In medical circles than any other prepara
tion in the past fifty years. It is. in fact, J
such a certain cure for Lost Manhood and Sex
ual Weakness that the French and German }
governments have by law adopted It for use
in tlv-lr standing armies. That Is why the sol
diers of those countries are known the world
over as the finest specimens of manhood ever
seen.
The Yon Mohl Co., of Cincinnati, Ohio, a
long-established house, who are the largest
Importers in the United States of standard
preparations, sent a representative to Europe j
to investigate the claims made for "C4L
THOS." Finding- the remedy all that physi- |
Ing the government of the Samoan Isl
ands. But the Washington authorities
apprehend that Germany, in her desire
to extend her territorial domain, may
go to extreme lengths and they are
prepared for emergencies. Commodore
Kautz will go overland to San Fran
cisco in October, by which time Rear
Admiral Miller will have reached that
port from Honolulu. Rear Admiral
Miller's retirement in November neces
sitates his detachment next month.
Commodore Harrison's name was men
tioned in connection with the Pacific
command, but the fact that he will re
tire a year hence prevented his selec
tion. Commodore Kautz was the next
officer of flag rank available, and after
considering his previous record he was
determined upon.
Eventually the two battle-ships will
be ordered to Honolulu, which will be
made by the Government the military
and naval base for operations in the
Philippines in case they should be ne
cessary.
Acting Secretary of War Meikeljnhn
said to-night that no orders for the dis
patch of troops from San Francisco to
Honolulu had been issued, but that the
troops may sail any day. The regi
ments will be among those now at San
Francisco, but as to the number to be
sent or which particular ones Secre
tary Meikeljohn could not now state.

TULARE, Sept. 10.â The Valley Road
has reached Tulare, and the people here
are happy. Competition, with all that
the term means, is at our door. The
tracks have been laid across those of
the Southern Pacific, and active build
ing; is going forward in the way of
pushing the line to the junction, four
teen miles west of Tulare.
Work will be commenced upon the
new depot as soon as the material can
be shipped in over the Valley line. The
depot will be a handsome one and will
be similar to those erected at Hanford
and Visalia. Sidetracks. passing
tracks and switches have all been put
in, and with the completion of the west
end of the road and the Tulare depot
all things will be in order for business.
Our celebration committee is at work

In the United States. Upon the return of the
representative, preparations were made to put
the remedy In the hands of sufferers by a
plnn that is far-reaching, as deserved, and
extremely generous on the part of the Yon
Mohl Co. All persons who write this house,
no matter how prominent or how humble their
circumstances, will have the satisfaction to
know that they will be treated In a straightfor
ward, honorable way, and that their letters
will be read and preserved in perfect con
fidence.
Free Trial Treatment.
To prove the gTeat curative virtues of
"CALTHOB" we will send 'ree to all a five
days' trial treatment of it. It will be sent by
sealed mall in a plain wrapper. In the privacy
of- home it can be tried, and If the result is
an improvement in strength and vigor, the full
treatment of the preparation can be purchased
later. In any event, not a cent is to be paid
for the trial treatment. It is as free as air
to those who are weak because of bad habits
in youth, or excesses, or overwork, or business
troubles.

celebration, and quaint, quiet old Tu
lare on that day will "wake the
echoes."
The tracks of the Valley Road pass
within two blocks of the business cen
ter of the town, and the depot Is lo
cated upon the principal business
street. The town has kept faith with
the valley Road people, who will fare
well at the hands of Tulare.
Tulare has long been one of the best
shipping points in the valley, and with
her stock, fruit, grain and hay she
hopes in the future to keep the Valley

A new era is dawning upon this val
ley, and the old order of things is
passing away.

ECHO OF AN
OLD SCANDAL
Woodward Tells How
He Got Cash.
NO BRIBE FROM DINGEE
HIS FAMILY MADE MONEY
BAGS FOR THE MINT.
The Councilman Does Not Think He
Was Treated Right After
His Vote on Water
Rates.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
EOS Broadway, Sept. 10.
Colonel George Hoguet, before the
Army and Navy Republican League, made
a statement that has renewed the Inter
est shown In Councilman Woodward a
ew^months ago. The colonel said:
"Now, let me tell you something which
Mayor W. R. Thomas has told me. You
know it was understood when E. W.
Woodward voted for the water ordinance
lost spring that money was paid him by
Dlngee. and that with it he fitted up a
house. That money, the Mayor â  explains
to me, was earned by Woodward's family
â working in the mint. When Woodward
voted In the Council for that water bill,
hia stepdaughter was at once dismissed
from service in the mint. Woodward
went to Leach and asked the cause, and
Leach told him it was because â he had
voted for the water bill. Now, that is
what your Mayor tells me, and he wanted
ycu to know the facts."
Councilman -Woodward .stated to-day
that Colonel Hoguet had slightly twisted
matters in his statement. " "The Inside
facts are these." said Mr. Woodward: "I
have a stepdaughter. Miss Florence
Atheam. and some little time ago when
we resided at i) 6 Thirteenth street I went
home one night and found at our house
two bolts or duck for. the purpose of i
making coin bags for the mint. I inquired
of Mrs. Woodward what the merchandise
meant, not having been informed of Its
coming. She stated that through the in
tercession of two very close friends with
Frank Leach the work of making these
bags had been procured for Miss Athearn.
Of course, this was news to me. and my
wife remarked that she thought she
would surprise me with the help ren
dered by our daughter and Mrs. Wood
ward. The work was done for a while
and orders were received repeatedly i
thereafter. The work was regarded the
best in this line and was satisfactory to
the storekeeper at the mint. " .
'â¢Soon after my appointment as City
Councilman the orders were all with
drawn, and my stepdaughter received no :
rr.nre merchandise for mittens or bags. \
Our people waited patiently from Feb- 'â 
ruary until June to learn the cause, and !
on June 10 I went to the mint to inter- !
view Mr. Leach. I met him in the hall !
and as<i.ed to see him just a moment, i
He replied he was very busy, and I told
him it would take only a second; that I;
simply wanted to ask him a question. ;
Then we went into his private office, i
where I asked: . â â 
"Did you withdraw the work that has i
been given to my sick stepdaughter on
account of the position I have taken on
the water question?' Mr. Leach replied
In the affirmative. Then I asked whether
he would continue to withdraw the pat
ronage from the sick girl for thoae rea
sons. I said that I would wait for him
to take the matter under consideration
for a reasonable time and that- I- would !
then decide what course I should take
in the premises. Mr. Leach said he had
given the stepdaughter the work on my I
account originally. That is too thin. I
never asked Mr. Leach for the favor, as
God is my judge. I was not that small
kind of a man to ask for work for my
stepdaughter. S--Â» far as seeking any- 1
thing Is concerned, I will say that I was
looking ior an appointment, but not un- '
der Mr. Leach nor through him. Now
these are the facts, free from all color
ing."
Mayor Thomas admits that he spoke
to Colonel Hoguet about Woodward. "It
wae on the day of the recent primaries,"
Bald the Mayor. "I remarked to Hoguet
that there had been a great d,eal of talk
about Woodward having received money
for his vote on the water question, since
he had fitted up his new house and had
obtained a release on hl3 furniture. 'But,' â 
eaid I, "Woodward told me that he had
obtained the release through money Mrs.
Woodward and the stepdaughter ha/1- re
ceived for making bags and mittens for ,
the United States Mint.' Of course I do
not know that Woodward ever got any I
money from Dingee, only I*Â»waj- the talk]
at that time."
Mr. Leach said to-night that he did not
care to say anything regarding Mr. j
Woodward or his doings.

VALENTIN:' HOME IN DISPUTE.
An Effort Made to Put the Widow
Out of the Placeâ Neighbors
to the Rescue.
ALAMEDA, Sept. 10.â W. T. Valentine,
who died in this city a week ago, left his
-ty in a queer condition, and as a re
sult an attempt was made to-day to force
the widow to leave the house by taking
all the furniture away from her. There
is no dispute as to the title to the prop
erty, it being conceded that it belongs to
the widow.
Valentine and his wife did not agree,
and some months ago, it is claimed, she
signed a quitclaim deed to her interest
in the community property in considera
tion of the sum of $1100. When Valentine
died Mrs. Valentine came over from San
Francisco, where she waa living with her
â .lighter, and remained in the family
home after the funeral. She applied for
letters of administration on the estate,
and the application is still pending.
Some time prior to his death Valentine
executed a deed to Thomas White, an
intimate friend, conveying the house and
lot to him. Mrs. Valentine, however,
claims that this deed is Invalid and took
possession of the house, while White aiso
occupied a room in it.
ilrs. Valentine says that White asked
ht-r yesterday to sign a quitclaim deed to
him for the real property, promising in
return not to oppose the granting of let
ters to her when the case comes up on
Monday. This Mrs. Valentine refused to
do.
Early this morning, while Mrs. Valen
tine was getting her breakfast, several
men rushed into the house, without
knocking or otherwise applying for ad
mission, and while two or them, armed
with canes, stood guard over her. the
others, under direction of White, tore up
the carpets, quickly loaded the furniture
and belongings on wagons, and took it off
â to a warehouse.
It was evidently the idea that if the
furniture were taken away Mrs. Valen
would have to abandon the house.
But in this White and his men were dis
appointed. Mrs. Valentine absolutely re
fused to leave the premises, and declared
-he and her daughter would sleep on
the bare floor if necessary in order to re
tain possession of the place. But they
were not obliged to do this. As soon as
the neighbors heard of the affair they
took food to the two women and bedding
was also furnished them from the same
source so that they might sleep there in
comfort. Mrs. Valentine declares her in
tention to hold the fort and says that if
she had been armed she would have shot
the first man who Intruded or dared to
lay a hand on her furniture without her
permission. Some lively litigation is ex
pected before the matter is settled. The
property in dispute is worth about $4000.
CUVELLIER'S VIEWS ARE
STRONGLY INDORSED
PRESIDENT JORDAN GUARDED
IN HIS REMARKS.
Many Parents Want a Change â John
P. Irish on the Demagogic
View.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
903 Broadway, Sept. 10.
President Jordan of Stanford University
has entered into the controversy of the
Oakland" 1 schools. ..This evening the Trib
une published the following letter:.
' I do not feel any call to discuss the matter,
which is one of which I have not much direct
personal knowledge.
I have, hcvrever. placed the communication
in the hands of Mr. Cubberley, our assistant
professor of education, who may feel like say
ing something' about It.
1 am correctly quoted as saying that young:
children ought not to be required to do school
"work by" artificial light. That' statement re
garding pupils coming from the city high
schools is, however, made too sweeping.
Our representatives from the Oakiax.d High
School have been for the most part students
of high gTade.
. There is no doubt that the colleges in In
sisting on certain technical requirements have
often added to the difficulty of shaping the
high school to the needs of the people.
There is no doubt that the best training for
actual life and the best training for college
ought to be identical.
â  But the collegee have not demanded what
ie really the best training. They have rather
called for the preparation which is most easily
measured. On the other hand the public has
shown very crude notions of what Is wanted
for practical affairs. -
Very truly yours.
DAVID S. JORDAN.
Councilman Cuveuier. whose strongly
worded circular called forth the discus
sion. is receiving . many letters from
parents, all of whom heartily approve of
his stand. Superintendent S. B. MeLenegan
of the Hay wards electric road says the
statements of Cuvelller voice the senti
ments of thousands.
Rector F. J. Mynard of St. John's pays
that In his parish calls he has seen enough
to convince him that radical changes are
necessary- Judge Fred V. Wood says he
indorses cry word of the circular. Ed
ward S. Finch sav3 the criticism is honest
and tnithfil. E. T. Henshaw admires
Ciivellier for his backbone to go before the
Board of Education and read his letter.
Mrs. A. R. Wood says that the Board of
Education should obtain a consensus of
opinion from parents and teachers on this
subject and It would give them the sur
prise of their lives.
John P. Irish expresses the following
views:
I have read ' with interest the new contro
versy over an old Issue,' that has been roused
by Mr. Cuvellier's paper on the Oakland
schools. This issue was Joined forty years ago.
The president of one of the great State uni
versities in the East, in a commencement ad
dress, long ago, took up the subject -of
using the common schools as preparatory
schools for the State universities.- and op
posed it. His grounds were that our common
school system, as Its name Implies, is Ito im
part that education which can be common : to
all. He declared . the purpose of the common
schools to be the thorough training of pupils
in reading, writing, and spelling the English
language, and the rudiments of Its grammar,
In arithmetic and geography. If a pupil desire
academic or collegiate education above these ;
fundamental branches, let him use the train- j
Ing their acquisition gave his mind to prepare
for the higher culture.
I heard that address and witnessed the dema
gogue clamor which followed. The champion |
of the poor man was Immediately In evidence,
enduring vicariously the sorrows of the poor
and incidentally running for office. The presi- '
dent of the university was speedily run out of
his position and out of the State. He was de
nounced as an aristocrat who sought to deprive j
the poor man's child of the "higher education."
The plain people were appealed to, to rally for '
their rights and elect only their friends to
office, and they rallied, with the result that
throughout the East the primordial purpose
of the common schools, to give a complete edu- i
cation to all comers in the branches upon 'â¢
which all culture is founded, was lost sight of
entirely, and the curriculum was loaded with
studies preparatory to the university. - *â â ,
For two score years this process has gone on.
The friends â ' of. the poor man have had their
â way, until Just what that wise old university
president predicted has come to pass. The
ptrtCcy demanded in behalf of the poor man has
proved to be his undoing, and instead of open- ;
ing to his child an easy path to the higher edu- !
cation, is making It less easy for him to get j
any education at all. â¢
The expected having happened, the dema- j
gogue is again in evidence, weeping proxy
tears for ' the sorrows of the poor, who are '
victims of a policy ordered Into being by dema
gogues In the Interest of their class, â¢ less than
half a century ago. :
It Is unwise to individualize the Oakland ;
schools in this matter: it is folly to call upon
the Oakland School Board the contempt' of tfie ''
city. Our schools are part of a systam - which
the board. cannot change. It was the fruit oi
demagogy.' and in changing it back to the sane i
yystem of the paÂ«t the demagogue comes again '
as an impediment, a damage and a danger. '
unwisely discussing wise things and inviting
the activity of bigotry to give such impulse to I
a movement as to endanger turning the, reform !
of the schools ; into their destruction. - â¢-. â

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1898.
DR. ROSS IS
NOT UNKNOWN
His Second Wife Tells
of His Resources.
BOUGHT HIM A DIPLOMA
CREDITORS REACH FROM TA
COMA TO PASO ROBLES.
Was Quite a Dude in Oakland, but
Two Years Ago Could Not
Purchase a Marriage
License.
<-> i t a o t^ ,i
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 10.
A former wife of Dr. A. Ross, who now i
llves on Powell street, San Francisco, was j
somewhat surprised to learn that the doc- â 
tor had recently been In Oakland, from '
which city he disappeared forgetting to |
secle up with his landlady and others. !
Dr. Ross Is evidently a man of great '
resources in the matter of being able to â 
tax the resources of others.
"I met Dr. Ross," says his second wife,
from whom he was divorced some time
ago, '"at a doctor's office in Seattle. He :
had not long been divorced from his first
wife. He was rather a seedy looking fel- '.
low, poorly dressed and wore old shoes.
I do not know why I was attracted to â 
him, but he had a very pleasant, plausible
manner and was very' gentlemanly. When
we were married he had not a cent, and
I bought the wedding ring, and the tailor
in Tacoma is still mourning that he mads
the wedding suit. This was in August, ,
1896. We lived together for five months,
but when we came to San Frantysco he
bought out a drug store on Powell and
OFarrell streets, but a settlement has not
yet been made. He bought his diploma
to Philadelphia for $25, with money that
I gave him. On the day of our wedding
he could not even raise enough to buy
the license.
"At Paso Robles he had an experience '
with a Dr. Steiner, and I understand that
Mr. Ruggles, an Oakland capitalist, :
brought him to Oakland from Paso ,
Robles. He has had many experiences
around the bay. His scenes of difficulty
embrace the Winchester House on Third
â tract, the Yosemite House and the Bald- >
win Hotel, at which last place I paid the
board bill to save further trouble.
"When I got my divorce I was awarded
$30 per month alimony, but I have not
yet nad a cent and did not know where
the doctor was until I read of his experi
ence in Oakland. The doctor Is a very*
shrewd fellow and I am sorry that I ever
met him. I understand that while in â 
Oakland he was a perfect dude and cut
quite a dash I can well imagine how
he did it. My experience with him was
very expensive, but left me considerably
wiser. I understand that Mrs. Req.ua has
in her possession some of the doctor's
property, and I am thinking of attach
ing It to satisfy my claim for delinquent ;
alimony."
PARK LOST HIS JOB.
Miss Dille Kestores His Ring, but
Persists in Believing She
Was Drugged.
OAKLAND. Sept. 10â Edward Park,
.the California-street motorman, has lost
his Job because of his treatment of Miss
Jane Dille, and he furthermore knovf
what the Oakland police department
thinks of him. He came from San Fran
cisco to-day and asked the police to give
him the ring which was found on Miss
Dille. The request was refused unless he
should produce an order from the lady.
Miss Dille very willingly returned the
gilt and Park was given the ring. Park
also told Sergeant Morrison that he had
lost his job because of the letter written
to the superintendent.
In an interview to-day Miss Dille said:
"Park and I used to go together, but as
my mother never approved of our engage
ment it was broken off. I have been mar
ried and divorced since then and had lost
track of Ed.
"He learned my address from some one
recently, and called on me when 1 was
out. As he lefjt his addrefc I wrote him a
note saying I was sorry he had missed
me. By return mail a note came saying
he would be over Thursday evening. I
wish now he had not come. He arrived
about 9 o'clock at the house of my friend
where I am stopping, and while we were
talking over old times I said: 'You have
a pretty ring,' and started to take It off.
He said: 'Don't take It off, Flo, it will
cut our friendship." He then took It off
his finger and put it on mine. After some
further conversation he asked me to go
with him to a restaurant for something
to eat. I refused. He Insisted, and so we
went to the Market-street restaurant,
where we took a private room. Ed or
dered oysters for two, and asked me what
I would have to drink.
"After the first drink he twitted me
with not being game, and said If I wanted
to be a sport I would have to drink whis
ky. I took whisky, and everything is a
perfect blank from that time till I awoke
in jail. I am sure I was drugged."

The New Army Engineer.
ALAMEDA, Sept. 10.â The news of the
transfer of Colonel Suter to Boston and
the coming- here of Colonel Mansfield, in.
his place, is received with pleasure by
the people of Alameda. They do not
know why the change has been made and
have had no hand In it so far as known,
but they regard Suter as inimical to the
interests of this city, as he has demon
strated by his action in condemning- the
tidal canal project and his recommenda
tion of discontinuance of the work. They
believe that the new engineer will recog
nize the great utility of the work, and
that he will not advise the abandonment
of work which has already cost the Gov
ernment hundreds of thousands of dollars
and which can be completed for a moder
ate amount in addition.

MRS. CARTER
WAS LEES'
LATEST HOPE
Mrs. Botkin Visited
Her August 3.
BUT THAT WAS ABOUT ALL
GOVERNOR BUDD SETS TUESDAY
TOR THE HEARING.
He Will Hold an Open Session at the
Palace Hotel â Gathering Up
the Last Threads of
the Case.
Another witness has "broken Into"
the case against Mrs. Cordelia Botkin,
and the record of the new evidence was
filed yesterday with the numerous
other statements that Chief Lees has
been preparing for the consideration of
Governor Budd.
The new affidavit is not the corpulent
document that the prosecution had
hoped it would be, nor does the story
it tells strengthen to the extent that
was expected the case of the pros
ecution against the prisoner.
It recites, in fact, that on the after
noon of August 3, Mrs. Cordelia Botkin
called upon Mrs. J. M. Carter at her
apartments at the Hotel Wentworth on
Bush street. Of the conversation that
ensued Mrs. Carter retained no clear
remembrance except that Mrs. Botkin
announced upon taking leave that on
tho next day she expected to leave for
Healdsburg, and bade her friend good
by.
Though it had been the custom of
Mrs. Carter and Mrs. Botkin to ex
change visits from time to time, Mrs.
Carter could recall no occasion upon
which she had accompanied Mrs. Bot
kin upon any of her numerousshopping
tours. She was positive that she had
not done so during the month of July.
Upon this point and with regard to
the general conversation. Mrs. Carter
was rigidly questioned, but not all the I
adeptness of her inquisitors elicited cmc !
compromising word, nor uncovered one |
positive, valuable fact.
That Mrs. Carter should go the way
of the half dozen other of their star
witnesses was a body blow to the pros
ecution. Since it was discovered that
the handkerchief that covered the
deadly chocolates had been purchased
at the <'ity of Paris the best energies
of the Chief and of Detectives Gibson
and McVey have been expended in a
combined effort to trace the course of
Mrs. Botkin through some one of her
more recent shopping tours.
There were witnesses in plenty
among the clerks of the City of Paris
who knew Mrs. Botkin and who had,
on divers occasions, waited upon her
wants or cashed the numerous postal
notes that she was in the habit of
bringing to the store for that purpose.
But no one of them could recall the
names or faces of the friends who are
known to have accompanied her, nor
could one be found to fix a date nor
the goods she purchased. The one con
necting link that from the beginning
has set at naught their best efforts was
evidently not to be found in the City
of Paris.
Chief Lees, however, persisted in his
search, though through other channels,
and a day or so ago in some way, just
how he declines to- say. discovered the
missing link in Mrs. Carter.
She was haled forthwith into the
presence of the inquisition and there, in
words, demonstrated that as the link
in a very few minutes and very few
she was a non-success.
For the present Chief Lees wiU give
no more time or energy in a hunt
for fresh evidence. The case will
go before Governor Budd on Tues
day as it now stands. The subse
quent campaign of the prosecu
tion will be decided by his action upon
the requisition.
COMPLETING THE
PROSECUTION'S CASE
Chier Lees Secures Some Signatures
to Affidavitsâ A Yellow Bub
ble Exploded.
Yesterday was a quiet day with the
Chief and his retinue; the morning was
spent in the signing of the numerous
affidavits; the afternoon, for the most
part, in a general, though silent, prayer

I take pleasure in letting yon know how

During the morning Miss Lizzie Liv
ernash called to revise and add her
signature to the statement of her
knowledge of the case. Miss Heney and
Miss Dittmer followed suit, and last
followed Expert Kytka, who, with be
coming modesty, retired to the privacy
of the Chief's conning tower to again
change his mind as to who really wrote
the anonymous letters. As Kytka's
raiment of vari-colored opinions does
not yet suit the Chief's fastidious
fancy, he has not been permitted the
distinction of signing an affidavit.
Another witness is lost to the prose
cution in the person of George L. Beck,
the druggist, who is much incensed at
the brazen attempt made in the Ex
aminer of yesterday morning to con
nect him with the Botkin case as a
probable witness of importance to the
prosecution.
After referring to an alleged "gay
night" with Mrs. Botkin at 927 Geary
street, the yellow faker goes on to say
that it has been discovered that Beck
is a long time friend of George W.
Haas, the confectioner, and a frequent
visitor to the Haas store. Further,
that at the proper time Mr. Beck would
be prepared to give evidence corrob
orating that of Miss Heney and Miss
Dittmer, the two candy girls who,
it is alleged, remember having sold a
box of candy to a woman answering
the description of Mrs. Botkin.
To Chief Lees and to a Call repre
sentative Mr. Beck last evening said:
"The story in the Examiner of this
morning is a lie out of whole cloth. I
never have known Mr. Haas nor do
I know him now; neither am I ac
quainted with any of the young women
who are employed by him. In fact, I
do not think that I have ever been in
his store. Until the 30th of July I
was away from town and all I know
of Mr. Haas since that time I have
learned from the papers."
NO STAR CHAMBER TRIAL â¢
FOR GOVERNOR BUDD
The Delaware Extradition Petition
Will Be Heard on Tuesday in
Public.
Governor Budd last evening positive
ly fixed Tuesday as the day upon which
he will hear the petition on the part
of the Delaware authorities for the ex
tradition of Mrs. Botkin.
Following: faithfully the absurd pol
icy of absolute secrecy that! has char
acterized his course throughout the
case. Chief Lees has every day during
the past week refused to make public
the day that he would appear with nis
case before the Governor.
The only fact that he has given out
is that if his efforts should prevail, the
proceedings would be held in private.
The.se tactics have not only tired the
public, but have decidedly wearied the
Governor himself, and he has finally
set the day himself. He has also de
cided that he will hear the petition and
review the evidence in this city, and
with that plan in view has selected the
Palace Hotel as the place of meeting.
It may also be stated that the ef
forts of Chief Lees will not prevailâ the
proceedings will be public.
Just how long it will be before Gov
ernor Budd will render his decision, he
himself cannot say. Should the review
ing of the prosecution's evidence not be
finished on Tuesday it will have to go
over until Thursday, as on Wednesday
the Executive has important State
business that will require his presence
in Sacramento.
As Chief Lees has accumulated an
immense amount of matter it will prob
ably be the last of the week before
the case can be disposed of. Chief Lees
said last night that he expected to have
his evidence in shape by Monday night,
as he is working on the last of the
affidavits.
CHAIR OF SURGERY IN
THE STATE UNIVERSITY
STILL VACANT FOB DR. SHIELS,
THE LOGICAL CANDIDATE,
Dr. Williamson Is Simply Recom
mended as Lecturer on Sur
gery for One Year.
The recent action of the faculty of the
State University in voting to recommend
Dr. J. M. 'Wiliamson as lecturer on sur
gery for the term of one year has been
misconstrued by some of the friends of
Dr. Shiels as an act of unfair treatment
to the latter. The facts, however, do not
warrant any such conclusion.
Dr. Shiels, who was associate professor
of the principles and practice of surgery
in the medical department of the uni
versity, obtained a leave "of absence and
went to Manila as brigade surgeon, un
der Brigadier General Harrison Grey
Otis.
Soon after his depiirture Dr. William
E. Taylor, professor of the principles and
practice of surgery, concluded, on ac
count of poor health, to go to Honolulu
and there take up his permanent resi
dence. Accordingly, at the last regular
meeting of the faculty he tendered his
resignation of the chair, and it wad for
warded to the Board of Regents.
Provision, therefore, had to be made for
the carrying on of the course of surgery.
Dr. Shiels, the logical candidate for the
chair, was absent In Manila, and the fac
ulty at a special meeting simply recom
mended Dr. Williamson, professor of
anatomy In the medical and dental de
partment, to fill the position of lecturer on
surgery for one year:
This action leaves the chair of surgery
still vacant, but provides for the course
of surgery to be carried on without inter
ruption. Thus it will be readily sepn that
no injustice has been done Dr. Shiels. nor
has any undue advantage been taken of
his absence.

Mount Zion Hospital.
Another meeting was held by the build
ing committee of the Mount Zion Hospital
last night in Dr. Rosenstlrns office. The
plans submitted by Architect Lyons will
be accepted after some changes have been
made. As was stated in yesterday's Call
the new hospital building to be erected
at 2313 Sutter street is to cost $40,000 and
It is to be two stories high. Owing to the
Increase of patients at the well-known
hospital this change was decided on by
the board of directors.
The other day 2000 Irish laborers left
Dublin by Bpeclal Bteamer for the harvest
In England.
THE SAltf FBAKCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1898.
WELLS-FARGO
FINDS ITSELF
IN A CORNER
Must Show Why It
Shirks a War Tax.
REFUSED TO CARRY PACKAGE
DEMANDED THE SENDER PAY
FOR BEVENUE STAMP.
Wherefore William E. Costley Took
His Case to the Courts and Put
the Corporation in a Del
icate Situation.
"vVells-Fargo people have been contend
ing that they were under no obligation
to pay the war tax levied upon them by
Congress. They had not the slightest ob
jection to having somebody else pay the
tax, and so have been holding up pat
rons for it. As a rule the patrons have
submitted to the imposition rather than
enter into a controversy. At last a new
sort of patron has come into the field.
Suit against the company has been begun
by William E. Costley, who asks damages
in the sum of $250. He brings the action
under section 2169 of the Civil Code, which
reads as follows:
"A common carrier must, if able
to do so, accept and carry whatever
is offered to him, at a reasonable
time and place, of a kind that he un
dertakes or is accustomed to carry."
That AVells-Fargo is a common carrier
will hardly be denied even by the presi
dential pamphlets issued by Mr. Valen
tine wherein black is set forth as white.
Thursday William Costley, as appears
in his complaint, took to the office of the
Wells-Fargo Express Company a pack
age of books to be forwarded to Sacra
mento. The package was duly weighed
and Mr. Costley was told that the charge
tor transmission would be 40 cents. This
he was willing to pay, but the agent
wanted to assess him an extra cent.
"What is the cent for?" naturally in
quired Air. Costley. He was told that it
was to pay for a revenue stamp, and he
declined to pay it knowing that the duty
of the company was to affix the stamp
at its own expense. "We cannot take
your package then," said the agent firmly.
There was a brief but ineffective argu
ment, at the end of which Mr. Costley
left the omce, taking his property with
him.
"I do not like the idea of a suit," said
the gentleman later to a representative
of The Call, "but It seems to me a prin
ciple Is involved, and I propose to find
out who is right. Of course, the cent is
not in itself worth consideration, but pri
vate citizens have had to pay the war
tax and have done It uncomplainingly. It
seems to me that the Wells-Fargo people
can afford to pay theirs and not try to
sneak from under and let their patrons
bear the burden. At least 1 am ready to
submit the matter to the proper tribunal."
Costley was as good as his word, and
yesterday the suit was filed by his at
torneys, MeGowan & Squires. It is based
upon "the refusal of the companY to ac
cept the package although the cost of
transmission had been tendered, and
places the defendant in a position where
it must show why refusal was made.
That this is a delicate position, and one
likely to strain the literary ability of the
distinguished writer of pamphlets goes
without saying. As to the outcome, peo
ple will wait with interest. The corpora
tion will doubtless fight for delay, and
the other side do everything possible to
expedite a decision.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 9, 1898.
Editor Call, San Francisco: I inclose
the cover of a pamphlet the Southern Pa
cific distributes on its trains under the
title of "The Hotel Gazette." The editor
ial page I clipped out, as I thought you
might like to see it.
John J. Valentine, president of Wells. Fargro
* Co., has Issued an Interesting little pam
phlet discussing the attitude of the express
companies on the war revenue stamp tax. It
Is a concise statement of the case for the ex
press companies, the pith of the whole mat
ter being expressed In the following para
graph:
"It Is certainly most economical for ship
pers to furnish the stamp, as any revised ex
press rates Including It would, unavoidably, at
least double the expense to them." Every fair
minded business man must realize that an In
crease In the ordinary expenses of doing busi
ness will necessarily be followed by an in
crease in the cost of the product or service to
patrons, and the wax revenue tax makes a
very real and vital Increase In the cost of
conducting an express business.
In other words, the express company
shall not be taxed. It shall raise its rates
to include the war tax so that the cus
tomer pays it! The war revenue tax
makes a "very real and vital increase in
the cost of conducting an express busi
ness"; but docs not a war revenue tax
make a "very real and vital Increase" in
the cost of conducting, for instance, a
wine business â or any other business? A
wine dealer places a stamp on each bottle
of wine, but as yet we have not heard
of any of the wine dealers raising the
price for a bottle of wine so as to include
the tax.
The position of the express company, as
shown by the quotedNparagraph, is wholly
untenable. In that it shows that the ex
press company refuses to be taxed and
paddles the burden upon the customer
who has already paid his war tax in a va
riety of ways.

She went down to investigate and found
the sounds came from the bathroom.
Fearing to enter the room herself, she
summoned William Ludwig, a grocery
clerk in the same block. He entered the
room and found Mr. Betzel in the bath
tub, unconscious from the gas, but still
breathing. Dr. Pillsbury was called in,
but Mr. Betzel was dead before he ar
rived.
Mr. Betzel is said to have attempted
suicide two or three months ago by tak

CONDEMNED THE MISSION ZOO.
Meeting of Real Estate Owners to
Discuss the Tax Levy for the
Coming Year.
An informal meting of property-owners
was held in the offices of A. M. Speck &
Co. last night to discuss the tax levy for
the coming year. As there were only a
few present and the levy has not yet
been set no definite action was taken,
although it was the opinion of all pres
ent that the figures should be below $2,
$1 80 being set as a fair limit.
There was a unanimous opposition to
the Mission Park and Zoo project, which
was characterized as a scheme to de
fraud taxpayers and put money in the
pockets of a few owners of undesirable
property in the outskirts of the city. -A
committee of ten will be appointed in the
near future to present a petition to the
Supervisors urging a low tax rate for the
following reasons:
Firstâ Rents have decreased In the past three
years from 15 to 25 per cent.
Secondâ Property has depreciated In value,
while assessments have increased.
The effect of the high tax rate will tend to
discourage Investors and will increase the rate
of the mortgage interest and reduce the rate
of Interest to savings bank depositors.
Fourthâ Local capital will be forced to other
States and securities other than realty.
Four were appointed to serve on the
committee of ten, the others will be cho
sen at a meeting to be held during the
coming week. The four selected were:
Captain W. J. Bryan Sr., Captain Wil
liam Ede, A. W. Wilson and M. J. Plat
shek.

Working Ardently for Its
Success.
A meeting of the general committee
which is planning a benefit for the family
of the late Captain Reinhold Ricluer, who
fell at Manila, was held at the National
Guard headquarters yesterday afternoon.
Colonel McDonald, an old friend of Cap
tain Richter's, addressed the meeting. He
spoke of the good services rendered by
the deceased in the National Guard, and
the widow and four children left desti
tute, concluding by expressing the hope
that the benefit to be held in Mechanics'
Pavilion on September 24 would be so suc
cessful as to render to the family that
financial assistance it needs so much.
The names of the various committees
were then discussed and settled as fol
lows: '
Executive and finance committee â Colonel
Thomas M. Cluff, chairman; Lieuten

jor J. A. Margo.
The various committees were then au
thorized to add to their numbers, as
seemed best to them, and the districting
of the city and the appointing of various
committees therefor was left to the execu
tive and finance committee after many
suggestions had been made as to the best
methods of doing this work.
Lieutenant Colonel Huber stated that he
had many offers of assistance from
various organization in the city to help
in the entertainment; that certain gentle
men in the printing trade had already
donated the stock and work for printing
6000 tickets and 600 quarter cards, and that
the offers for refreshments, etc., were
most gratifying.
The benefit is to be given in the inter
est of the orphans and widow, and every
one is imbued with the idea of keeping
the expenses of the affair at a minimum,
thereby realizing as much as possible for
the family of Captain Richter.
WARNING FROM HONOLULU.
Knights of Pythias Are Advised
That the Islands Are Only for
Men With Large Capital.
Past Chancellor F. Waldron, Ed Towse
and J. Neill and G. Erickson. a Joint com
mittee representing Oahu Lodge No. 1 and
Mystic Lodge No. 2 of the Knights of
Pythias of Honolulu, have sent a circu
lar letter to all Pythians in the United
States, warning them to keep away from
the Hawaiian Islands. The communica
tion is in the following words:
The annexation of these Islands by the
United States has caused many of the brethren
to project attempts to better their condition
or to find employment in what they consider
a new country. Such we consider It our duty
to warn and to speak to in plain terms.
The social and business communities of these
Islands were old and well established before
the rush to California. This is in no sense a
new country. The only opportunity here Is
for the man of large capital. There is no em
ployment here for mechanics 01 any kind or
for unskilled labor. Many men of ability, of
good habits and first-class recommendations
are now here practically stranded. There were
idle men In Honolulu before the American flag
replaced the Hawaiian flag. All lines of small
business are fully filled and in most cases
overcrowded. Do not come here unless you
have the assurance in advance of steady em
ployment or have the capital to engage in land
development enterprises requiring large means.
We spread this positive advice because we wish
to save brethren disappointment and distress.
We state the facts as in more than honor
bound and trust sincerely this circular will
accomplish Its mission.
HAPPY MACCABEES.

Notified That They Will Have to

'".-â . â "..:
"Cold Feet" Wlttman has levied another
assessment on his unfortunate subordin
ates. This time he demands 25 cents
from each of them, the total amount to bo
used in buying instruments for the drum
and fife corps. Not satisiied with com
pelling them to part with a portion of
their salaries to purchase swords for him
and his sergeants, he has had the audac
ity to inform them that they must con
tribute to the fund for the purchase of
drums and flfes for the recently organized
corps. Yesterday he appeared before his
men, dressed In a new uniform, his frosty
feet lending a chilly effect to the other
wise warm atmosphere.
"We need a drum corps," he remarked,
his breast swelling with pride, "and we
must have one. It always seemed to me
that we lacked something as we marched
along the principal streets, admired by
countless thousands. After careful study
I have come to the conclusion that music
is the missing factor. You all remember
the time-worn expression that 'music hath
charms to soothe the savage breast.' If
we continue to parade the streets without
the soothing notes of a brass band or a
fife and drum corps we might as well go
out of business. I have already selected
a suitable corps and In order to provide
the boys with the necessary instruments
It becomes Incumbent upon me to Inform
you that we are short of the necessary
money with which to fit them out. How
ever, I have decided to tax you all 25
cents each, the amount to bo expended
in buying drums and fifes."
Noticing the scowls which darkened the
countenances of many men Wittman said
that he was aware that some of the offi
cers were not In favor of paying the as
sessment, but that he Intended to see that
they were forced to do so.
One of the policemen who is opposed to
giving up a portion of his salary each
month toward satisfying the whims of
the raptaln of the Central station said:
"It Is time that Wlttman got on to him
self. During the past year we have been
assessed at least a half dozen times, and
unless the Commissioners call a halt
Wlttman will soon have us all In debt.
He is well fixed financially and does not
seem to think that we need every dollar
we earn. I suppose that in a few days
he will ask us to subscribe sufficient
money to build a monument over his
grave' when he will have passed away."
COURT-MARTIAL OF
CHAPLAIN M'INTYRE
AFFIDAVITS ARE FORWARDED
FROM DENVER.
Testifying to the Correctness of the
Newspaper Report of His
Lecture.
It was stated a few days ago in a dis
patch from Washington that Chaplain
Mclntyre, of the battleship Oregon,. now
visiting in San Francisco, is to be court
martialed for criticizing certain naval offi
cers who took part in the destruction of
Cervera's fleet. It will be remembered
that the chaplain's trouble arose from a
lecture which he delivered in Denver. He
claimed that the report of his lecture in
one of the Eastern newspapers was a
malicious misrepresentation of what he
said.
A letter received In this city yesterday
from Denver states that several well
known citizens of that city who heard the
lecture have, in response to a request
from Washington, forwarded to the Navy
Department affidavits to the effect that
the newspaper report with which the
chaplain finds fault was absolutely cor
rect. As the court-martial will be based
principally on the newspaper report of the
lecture it would seem that Chaplain Mc
lntyre has got himself into troublous
water.

Williams was employed as receiver of a
Philadelphia railroad, and skipped out
with about $1000 belonging to the com
pany. A short time after he came to this
city and joined the First Infantry, United
States army, stationed at the Presidio.
He was discharged about three years ago
and was given a position with W. B. Ful
ler.
Learning that he was in this city his
former employers sent Chief Lees a pic
ture of him. together with a brief state
ment of his crime. Gibson and Wren were
detailed to find him, and convinced tnat
they had the man located they went to

placed Williams under arrest. He offered
no resistance, and was at once taken to

Williams admits that he is the man
who is wanted. He declared to the de

arrested him, as he was anxious to re

BUNKOED A WIDOW.
John L. Sherman, a Clothing Sales
man, Wanted on a Charge of
Embezzlement.
OAKLAND, Sept. 10.â John L. Sherman
is wanted on a charge of embezzlement.
Sherman is a clothing salesman, having
lately been engaged in numerous Broad
way stores. He is also the gay young
man of sporty proclivities who has been
basking in the smiles of Mrs. Small, an
unsuspecting widow residing on New
Broadway and who to-day swore out a
warrant for his arrest.
If Mrs. Small's story as told by her to
the police be true, she has been cleverly
bunkoed out of JoOO in good hard cash
Last week Sherman called on her, so she
says, representing that he had an excel
lent opportunity for investment. He
could buy a cigar stand for $500 which
would in a very short time realize its pur
chase price. He whispered sweet and
honeyed sentences into her ear and
begged her to advance him the necessary
money on the strength of their friendship.
Long he pleaded and finally won out. On
last Wednesday she drew the money on
her bank account, handed it to him and
he hurriedly left her to purchaseâ a rail
road ticket to the south somewhere, and
has not been seen since. The unfortunate
widow feels the loss all the more since
she has three children to support besides
herself, while the clothing salesman has
been living high.
Sherman has been stopping at Mrs. J
Parsons' boarding house, 830 Webster
street, and It is understood that he has
a wife and some children living in Oregon
Advances made on furniture and pianos, with
or without removal. J. Noonan. 1017-1023 Mission.
Burned a Rat Alive.
Otto Maysoen, a grocery clerk, was ar

declares that the rat was dead when he
rolled it in a piece of paper saturated
with coal oil and set fire to it.
Spurious coins are legally made In
China. They are used to put in the
coffins of the dead and the supersti
tion prevails that they make the dead
happy.

LAST OF THE KAHUNAS
g i >N( (L.UL.U, Sept. 3, IS9S.â I stood before the door
of Kahaleauki, the Kahuna.
I^4 On his porch the mornlng-grlorj' hang's her
matted curtain, starn-d with blossoms blue and
innocent us babies' eyes. Over his low coral
Â« walls the scarlet hibiscus twines and the Pon
ciania regia flames upward to the But in his
garden prows only the tiâ tree beloved of all Ha
waiian sods â and used by the Kahunas in all their
mystic rites.
The Kahuna is the witch doctor of the old Ha
waiian faith. His gifts are manifold and his number
few. He practices his strange powers of sorcery now
against the Christian and the civil law. He is still
respected, feared, implicitly believed in, jealously hid
den by some Hawaiian educated to broader faJth and
even these will smile and tell you quietly that Ka
huna ism is dead. The hack driver who brings you a
trustful strang* r from the steamer and offers himself
as guide, philosopher and friend will promise to take
you t" see a Kahuna or bring one to see you.
Is there anything that the hack driver of Honolulu
will not offer and charge you for?
But neither he nor you can pass the wall of sacred
Buperstition and the very earthly fear of punishment
which the native builds about this doctor, seer, sage,
witch and prophet of his race; and the dingy, respect
able and clothed Kanaka who comes to mutter over
a bowl of water and read your future in two leaves
at the bottom of it is no more Kahuna than Chris
tian â and perhaps not quite so much.
â¢ I am come here with a little bundle of the awa
root in my hands to know why I pass sleepless nights.
Kahaleauki will tell me. He knows all the secrets
of heaven and earth. He walks with the gods in
dreams. All time belongs to him â the then, the now,
the fterward. Looking in the awa cup he reads the
cause of every human ill, the face of friend or foe,
discovers treachery and foretells death. He can strike
the death fire from the sandal wood, and brew its
antidote from sandal bark. He can change coldest
hearts to flame, divorce the passions from the reason
â supposing they are ever wed. He can inspire and
cure love, jeaiousy. infidelity and disease. He can
recall the absent, change the heart, lay on the curse
of madness and pray human life away.
Besides my little bundle of awa root I have brought
a live chicken, tied neatly by the legs. Poor innocent
fowl! Saved from the butcher and the festal board
to be prayed to death by Kahaleauki aud served up
on the altar of my education.
I beat Boftly on Kahalcauki's door. I know it will
be opened to me for I brought a passport signed by
a hand that opens all Hawaiian doors. I heard a soft
musical jabber within. I said, as I had been told to
say:
"Aloha! I am the foreign woman. I have brought
the letter to Kahaleauki."
There was no answer, only a stirring sound close
by the door. While I waited with my hand against
it a tall, young 1 Hawaiian â '-1 came toward me round
the corner or the porch. She was about fourteen, a
slender, gracious, supple shape. She walked with the
undulating, passionate grace of the Hawaiian wo
man's youth; she had the beautee damnee dv diable
which belonjre to the youth of woman in every land.
Her feet and legs were bare and the hot sun shone
on their smooth surface as on polished copper bronze.
Her loose sacque fell away from her full brown throat
and her sweet virginal breast; her hair hung a single,
splendid inky braid nearly to her knees, and her eyes
were lovely, liquid, calm, asleep in deep, sweet, stupid
peace.
She put out a suppl Â« brown hand to receive the
letter and went, silent and smiling adorably, as she
came. Presently another door opened on the porch
and another brown hand, older but as supple, beckoned
me through.
The room was very long, very low, darkened by
drawn blinds, lighted by the sunlight streaming into
the lauai beyond. The lauai is the wide porch, either
open or enclosed, and always vine-hung, palm-set and
sweetly cool, where the Hawaiian sits, eats, sleeps,
and has his being while at home. I see, in passing,
the nervous shadow of tall Kahili, shaken by the
draught from the door, upon the wall; the gleam of
polished calabashes ranged on shelves along the wall;
the glow of yellow leis made from the priceless single
yellow feather that grows beneath the dark wing of
the Oo; strange shapeless forms in wood and stone,
huge gourds, barbaric sp irs and ancient drums,
weapons and ornaments of shark's teeth and human
bone, leis braided from human hair, great polished
surf DO&rdJ shaped like coffin lids, on which the fathers
of Kahaleauki traveled, secure as in a ship, from isle
to isle over smooth or troubled seas, to charm, to
prophesy, to heal and to destroy.
I merely recognize their outlines as I pass. I have
popn such matters â priceless relics of the picturesque
Hawaiian barbarism in other Hawaiian homes. My
eyes are for the lauai and Kahaleauki.
He sits a wild, impressive, savage figure cross
legged upon the floor. He wears a malo of white
]j n ,, n â a breech clout, a mere strip of cloth wound
about the loins. A square of tapa. dyed dull red, is
folded, three-cornered, like a shawl over his left
shoulder and knotted under the left breast. On his
head a scarlet cloth is folded likewise, but from the
other side, with the knot above the right temple and
the point falling over the left cheek. His face is fine
of feature, full of splendid strength. His eyes are
black brilliant, compelling-: his firm, straight nose,
set close to the face, ending in a flattened point with
nostrils curving upward to the cheek, looks like an
anchor cut on a bronze mask; his lips are full, firm,
sensuous, his teeth pure, perfect white of cruel regu
larity. He wears a beard which is grown very white,
but the thick mop of black uppn his head is only
powdered delicately with , white hairs growing few
and far between. He must be very old. His face and
his hands are wrinkled; but his beautiful, nearly
naked body is smoottfand brown as a boy's.
Befiore him on the floor lay a mat of tapa, folded
In a square, set forth with leaves of the ti, bunches
of herbs, bits of sugar cane, strips of bark, pieces
of sandal wood, knots of awa root and straw, two
bowls one smaller than the other, cut rudely from
the cocoanut with blunt lips from which to pour a
little cup containing spotted seeds, a smooth round,
tapered stick as long as a n.an's arm. of beautifully
polished wood that looks like koa, and at one
corner of the tapa a small, smooth, round, black
stone. ; __ â â¢- -'
I had been told to look for this stone. When placed
thus, at the corner of the mat, it lifts the tabu from
the Kahuna's presence and one may enter, speak,
move about before him. But woe to him who seeks
to lift the spell laid by the gods when the speaking
stone Is not upon the mat.
"Aloha!" I say,- pausing at the door.
Kahaleauki does not speak. He fixes his brilliant
eyes on mine* and, by my faith, as a sinner and a
journalist, they turn me faint and cold. I grasp my
chicken firmly with a sense of near, dear, live, human
companionship, which is by no manner of means ap
preciated. I do not know how long I have stood
there when, under the spell of those eyes, I creep
nearer and nearer to the Kahuna and sink upon the
floor before his mat with my poor doomed fowl in
one hand, my little bundle of the awa root in the
1 Kahaleauki does not speak. He raps on the floor
vith one hand and a brown boy comes out Into the
lauai and drops beside me on the floor. He will in
terpret for me, he explains, smiling in the security of
his familiarity with the compelling eyes. He tells me
that from the sandal wood upon the tapa mat Kaha
leaukl strikes death fire that will travel -hundreds of
miles to kill* and with the two pieces of sandal bark.
one cut from the right and one from the left side of
the tree he brews a drink and a lotion that if taken
.and applied within thr*-*> days will prove an antidote.
From the other barks he. brews potions- to cure or to
destroy from the manu-rn"le. the striped red and
yellow cane and a few of the little spotted milo seedn
he works a love charm; with the pili-mai. the white
sugar cane, and a drink brewed from the laukalu
leaver he brings back wandering love. The smooth
and polished stick is the Kauwila, the Kahuna's stick,
a wand which tossed upward from his hand toward
the gods, in ' the presence of the one he wishes to
<sestroy,*^rir.srs a curse down upon him when it falls.
Other curses, that of the death fire, of madness, even
of death by prayer, may be lifted by other Kahunas;
but the curse of the Kauwtla is supreme with the
gods and only he who casts it out can with the gods'
permission call it back. The cocoanut bowls were the
ahu-awa in which the awa root when chewed is
steeped in water and strained through the bunches
of straw, which, dipped into it and squeezed by the
hands, catf'h all the liber and leave the liquid pure.
And all these things must be done with prayer and
chanting over the ahu-awa, wherein signs of all sorts
also are read. And no Kahuna breathes between the
measures of his prayer. This breathless chant comes
to him by nature or by heredity, for Kahunas are
born not mn.de. And then' they are educated in the
prayers and chants and charms and curses and their
power is twice tested before they are permitted to
pray over man. First a hen â just such a hapless fowl
a# nestles in trustful ignorance on my knees â is
brought before the student in the gentle art of pray
ing things to death. If the bird falls beneath the
spell the student goes up on to a mountain rock and
prays away the stones. If the stones crumble before
him it is known that the gods are pleased to have
him work their will for good or evil on his race.
After having told m; a., these strange things with
the eyes of Kahaleauki upon us both, the brown boy
asks me if I am ready to begin.
NEW PENSION LIST OF THE WAR
The First Applications Have Been piled and They're All Waiting Their Turn. What Applicants Must Do When They Present Tfoeir Claims
and the Amounts the Government Allows Its Dependent Soldiers.
THE war record of the lato Priv
ate William H. Hook of Wiscon
sin forms an exact counterpart
to the career of Solomon Grundy,
who was born on Monday, chris-
tened on Tuesday, married on
Wednesday, filled t>ut the remainder of
his checkered career and died on the
following Sunday.
Private Kook enlisted for the war on
Thursday, went into camp on Friday,
fell ill on Saturday, died on Sunday,
and on the following Wednesday his
widow went before a magistrate and
executed an application for a pension.
Mr. Hook enlisted on May 12, at Mil
waukee, Wisconsin. On the 13th he
went into camp at Camp Harvey, near
Milwaukee. On the loth he died. On
the 18th his widow, Lida M. Hook, exe
cuted her pension application, and on
the Ist of June it was filed in the Pen
sion Office.
She was the first applicant for a pen
sion growing: out of the pending war
with Spain. The witnesses to her ap
plication are Steven Hook and Henry
Hinkel. She gives her age as 24, and
her addrens at 275 Ceape street, Osh
kosh, Wisconsin. Her husband was a
member of Company F, Second Wis
consin Infantry. He was born in
England and was the son of Richard
Hook. At the time of his enlistment
he was a mill hand in Oshkosh. Mrs.
Hook's father was a Mr. Morreil, and
her mother bore the poetical name of
Jennie Van Dome.
The application, with a number of
KAHALEAUKI SITS A WILD, IMPRESSIVE, SAVAGE FIGURE, CROSS-LEGGED UPON THE FLOOR.
The truth is, I am not. I have a womanish fear.
I fear the potent eyes of Kahaleauki. I fear the
strange, cool, sluggish touch they lay upon my blood.
I fear the air that broods about this place. The sun
is g-one. The wind is dead, '-he sky is overhung with
dreadful clouds. It is almost dark in the laual except
close by the vine-shrouded windows through which
the solitary, passionate hibiscus burns "and burns
against the coral wall.
The brown boy speaks to the Kahuna, who makes
a sign of assent.
"He will pray the love prayer for you before I
chew the awa."
Kahaleauki throws his body forward, resting on
his outspread hands. His full lips part over his cruel
teeth. The prayer begins:
"Eia ka ai tku makua elono makua omaa kua ia
ahu ula aka pili pili aka hina hina oka holona aka
ia kea okolo pua okolo anuenue o ahu okuko alia
ouluku omaka alahia omoe ole aka po mac Iho iko

wehe okanwe ma ke kua ake loha make alo e aha
ana ekuko ana ella ana c uluku ana eniakala hia
ana he mau kane ma nuuhlna aka hina ia. aJce kapu
apeloaku!"
It is spoken thus, as I have copied it, from the
mystic Kahuna book of prayer on which the eyes of
the unanointed have seldom looked. There is no
others, is in the office of the chief clerk
of the Bureau of Pensions, where all
await the completion of the records
necessary to their adjudication. Up
to date about a hundred applications
have come in, and for the present all
sleep together. All pension applica
tions have to be referred to the War
Department for the record of the sol
dier involved. The muster rolls of the
recent volunteer army are not yet in,
and the records of the soldiers are very
incomplete. Until these records are in
better shape, which may be several
monthÃ, the Pension Office is held at a
standstill in the adjudication of appli
cations growing out of the existing
war.
The Pension Office has plenty of
work to do, however, ac Commissioner
Evans remarked to me a shert while
ago, because there are pending in that
bureau 635,000 old applications. These
include applications for original pen
sions, increases, accrued and new disa
bilities.
As soon as the official records will al
low a new division will ,be created to
handle the applications growing aut of
the Spanish-American war, work will
be begun upon them and the records
of them will be kept separate from
the other records of the Pension Bu
reau.
The creation of a division to handle
this class of pensions will not involve
any increase in the Pension Office force.
That force was fixed by the law which
went into effect on July 1. The new dl
viyion will be made up of clerks de
tailed from old divisions.
A good number of the new applica
tions now in come from the navy. The
fchips represented are the Winslo-w, the
Hugh McCulloch, the Richmond, the
St. Paul, the Charleston, the Newark,
the Vesuvius, the Yankee, the Marble
head, the Olympia, the Pompoii, the
Vermont, the 'Marion, the Saturn, the
Wabaah, the Puritan, the lowa and the
Brooklyn. The list is somewhat indica
tive of the ships that have been en
gaped in the various mix-ups.
The pension applications indicate that
Elijah B. Tunnell, who was killed on
board the Winslow in Cardenas har
bor, was not only a good sailor, but an
important man to his people. His
widow, Eliza J. Tunnell, follows Mrs.
Hook as second on the list of appli
cants. A little further down the list
comes Sarah Tunnell, who claims a
pension as the dependent mother of
Elijah B. In the investigation to fol
low the claim of the widow will be first
considered. Frank Randall, the late
chief engineer of the Hugh McCulloch,
furnishes another instance of double
applications. His mother and his minor
children have applied for pensions on
account of his death.
Two applications have come in from
the Richmond, Oscar L. Rose.- as an in
valid sailor, and Margaret Walker, the
widow of Charles W. Walker.
The tragic death on the Brooklyn, the
only death to occur in the famous de
struction of Cervera.'s fleet, is already
recorded in the Pension Office. It will
be remembered that George H. Ellis,
while standing within two feet of Com
modore Schley during the memorable
chase of the Cristobal Colon, had hia
head taken off by a shell. The instance
was mentioned in Commodore Schley's
report to Admiral Sampson, except
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1898.
pause in the breathless flow of soft short syllables,
no modulation in the single tone of Kahaleauki's
voice. It was like the deep voice of the surf pounding
on the shore, like the sullen roar of fire caged, like
the voice of Pele burning in her hills. The love that
comes in answer to that call must be a strange, un
holy thing.
"It means nothing," says the brown boy, "because
it was not done over the awa and because there is
no woman to eat the sugar cane and the little milo
seeds.
But I was glad that it was done.
"Now," said the brown boy, "give him your awa
root."
I put forward the little bundle I had brought.
Kahaleauki touched the smooth, black stone and it
was swallowed in his hand. The spell of silence was
cast. Spreading it wide in his brown fingers, still
supple as a child'?, the Kahuna Kahaleauki read in
the ir.vr root the story of my sleepless nights. He
laid It before him on the tapa square and as I looked
upon it the smooth black stone was there beside the
rest.
I shivered and awoke my hen. It struggled feebly
and I stroked it with my Judas hand. Kahaleauki
spoke to the brown boy and the brown boy translated
him to me.
"Night falls on Hawaii nei and she sleeps. Only
that the modest commodore did not in
timate that but for the accident of a
few inches of space the shell might
have taken off his own head instead of
that of Chief Yeoman Ellis.
Ellis was enrolled on the Brooklyn as
chief yeoman on May 3, 1597, in the city
of Brooklyn, Kings County, N. Y. The
application for a pension was made by
his widow, a young woman of 22, be
fore a notary in Brooklyn on July 13
and filed in the Pension Office July 14.
It states that her husband "died at
Santiago July 3, 189S, struck by a
shell."
John G. Switzenich applies for a pen
sion as the dependent father of Ernest
Switzenich, who lost his life on the
Marblehead.
Among the applicants for invalid
pensions are Charles McCarthy of th".
"Vesuvius, Thomas Devine of the Ma
rion, Charles Lowry of the Saturn and
James Quinney of the Wabash.
The only high officer of the army in
whose name a pension has been asked
is Lieutenant Colonel John M. Hamil
ton of the Ninth United States Cav
alry. The application is made by his
widow, Isabel Bowie Hamilton, and it
states in thrilling phrase that he was
killed July 1 at the head of his com
mand while storming a hill at San
Juan.
It is noticeable that so far not an ap
plication has been received on account
of any of Roosevelt's Rough Riders,
who experienced the heaviest loss of
the war while driving the Spaniards
back into Santiago.
While only a hundred pension appli-

the foreign woman lies sleepless. The awa will tell."
The eyes of Kahaleauki held me. I could not close
mine and yet they felt strangely heavy, weighted by
something that was not sleep.
"Now," said the brown boy, "he says I must chew
tha awa."
But I had not heard him speak. I saw the stone
was gone again*. from the corner of the tapa mat.
Kahaleauki fell forward in the position of Kahuna
prayer. His smooth brown legs crossed before him.
his smooth brown arms outspread, his wrinkled hands
with their supple fingers resting on the floor. His
eyes were lowered. The lids were still; the bronze
anchor of his nostrils undisturbed by any passing
breath. The red of the cloth upon his head took some
light from the returning sun and cast a glow over his
immobile mask. He sat like a thing of bronze. And
the brown boy beside him chewed and chewed the
awa root. As he chewed he swallowed the Juice,
which is the essence of dreams and drunken ecstasies,
and cast the pulp from his mouth into the larger
ahu awa on the mat. And when there was enough
he poured water over it and taking a bunch of the
straw he rolled it between his hands and dipped it
into the cup In which the fluid had gathered the color
and consistency of muddy coffee and squeezed it about
like a sponge and wrung it out nearly dry with the
particles of the awa root clinging all over it; these
he shook off and dipped and squeezed the straw again
and again until the liquid pure remained in the awa
cup.
The Kahuna raised his eyes. He took a ti leaf
from the tapa and stripped a thin piece from its
center and dipped it in the awa cup. Then he laid it,
wet, into the smaller cup and poured the awa from
the other over it. Then he returned to the posture
of prayer and began again that breathless chant.
No, not that â another. This monotone was' vibrant
with meaning, vitality, force, fire, all that the other,
dreadful as it was, had lacked. It surged, a single
exhalation, above the awa cup and watching, listening
always, I saw the bubbles rise. The Kahuna rocked
and swayed. The light was on his face that never
was on land or sea. My head swam, my hands shook.
I said to myself, "It is the power of this sound." But
I did not know then what power it was nor do I now.
The prayer ceased. The stone was gone. The Kahuna
spoke. The brown boy translated.
"The foreign woman has enemies. A curse is laid
on her pillow to keep sleep away. The awa teils."
Kahaleauki stretches out his hands toward the awa
cup. His eyes are tixed upon the hen that lies across
my knees. The stone is gone. The brown boy sits
motionless, his calm, soft glance is on his master's
face. It shows neither fear nor expectancy. My own
I know is filled with both. The Kahuna sounds his
dreadful note. He has fallen forward, praying, on
his hands. His baleful eyes glow closer to the bird.
His lips curl upward from his teeth. They gleam
white upon white against his beard. His head rocks
to and fro, his body sways between his rigid arms,
his supple fingers bent upon the Hour.
Something crawls over me, stopping the beat of
my heart, chilling the breath in my nostrils. I feel
a weight on my temples, a weight on my breast, a
weight on my nerveless hands. I long to cry out and
I cannot. I long to rise and I cannot. Then all long-
Ing passes away. I think that I am sleeping and I
do not care to wake. I think that I am dying and I
do not care to live. Sound, sound, sound! It is all
that I am conscious of.
And slowly I come to know that this sound has
ceased. I hear nothing but I see again. I see the
Kahuna sitting cross-legged before his tapa mat,
drinking the awa from the bowl. I see the brown boy
with his soft, calm glance upon his master's face.
I feel the blood returning to my heart, the warmth
to my hands. I can rise easily now, I think, and I
am mad to be gone. I stir slightly and slip back
again. The brown boy gives me his hands and I rise
unsteadily to my feet. Something falls from my skirts.
I look down and see the hen lying dead upon the floor.18

bo small. â .. .
He is probably the smallest man that
ever supported the dignified title of
general. In his long-tailed coat and
Bilk hat he is a quaint little figure. His
countenance beams with kindliness
and gentleness, and it seems strange
that a body of such minute proportions
should be the tenement of so large a
soul. Despite the sixty-five winters
and summers that have passed over the
little man's head, old Father Time has
treated him most kindly, for not one
white hair has he dropped in passing.
The general has had a remarkable
career as well as an interesting per
sonal history. He was born In Louis
ville, Ky., and when the Civil War
broke out was one of the first to offer
his services to his country. Leaving be
hind him a property valued at $2,000,
000, as a common private he commenced
his scramble up the ladder of fame.
Nor did he once stop until he had
reached the rung upon which was in
scribed "Brevet Brigadier General."
In his capacity as private secretary
to General Joseph E. Johnston, and af
terward to Jefferson Davis, most of the
secret correspondence of the war passed
through his hands. He also drew the
plan of the battle of Bull Run. At the
termination of the war he emerged to
find his property destroyed and that he
had not so much as a 10-cent piece.
For all his lost fortune, for the
merry time he might have had, he has
no regrets. He says he is a better man
than he would have been had he had
his vast fortune to squander in riotous
living, for he frankly admits that when
the war began he was rapidly progress
ing toward the canines.
The general is a blithesome little bach
elor. He has managed to steer his bark
clear of the shoals and breakers that
beset the sea of matrimony, although
he had one hair-breadth escape. So
anxious was the "woman in the case"
to place the halter round his neck that
when somebody as a jest remarked that
she and the general wore engaged she
at once sent out cards announcing their
engagement. The first indication he
had that the remark had "taken" was
when, accosted by a friend the follow
ing day, he was offered congratula
tions. However, he managed to escape
without any serious injury.
General Bamberger's eye is probably
the most remarkable of its kind in the
world. He wears a number four myo
pic glass, which is nearly the strongest
made and which is entirely inadequate
to his needs.
Interesting and extraordinary as this
gentleman's vision appears to the lay
mind, it must be ever more so to that
of the man of science. The peculiarity
of the eye lies in the formation of the
retina, for an eye capable of distin
guishing objects of extraordinary min
uteness must have a retina in
which the rods a d cones are extraor
dinarily minute. A part of General
Bamberger's abnormal acuity of vision
for near objects is explained by his ex
treme myopia (nearsightedness), for a
myopic eye is in a sense a magnifying
glass. There is nothing unusual in the
appearance of the eye. It is clear and
bright, there is no undue distension or
contraction of the pupil, nor fullness of
tho cornea. The writing which General
Bamberger has been kind enough to
do for The Call, and which, it will be
seen, fills a space that can easily be
covered by a nickel, will, if placed un
der a powerful microscope, be found to
be the following poem of Schiller, "The
Greatness of the World":
Through the world, which the Spirit,
creative and kind,
First formed out of chaos, I fly like
the wind
Until, on the strand
Of its billows I land.
My anchor cast forth where the
breeze blows no mere,
And Creation's last boundary stands
on the shore.
I saw infant stars into Being arise.
For thousands of years to roll on

STRANGE MARRIAGE CEREMONIES.
Marriage by capture, says the Spec
tator, is symbolized more or less in
ceremonies all the world over, except
in such places where it is still the habit
to secure a wif j by knocking her down
first, as the Australian does with his
"waddy" or his "nullanulla." The
Chinaman, if tha parents of his in
tended are obstinate, carries her off;
the Abyssinian carries his wife round
her own house or to his own; and the
Kabyle carries his bride across the
threshold, as do also the Chinese, and
the Swiss in some parts. The Druses
have a regular sham fight in which the
brirle's party drive the bridegroom's
into his own village; and in some Arab
tribes, the Aenezes, for instance, the
bride runs from tent to tent before she
is caught. Crossing the threshold was
and is the most critical period of the
wedding day with all races, not even
excepting the Anglo-Saxon.
I Bail tow'rd the land where tha
breeze blows no more.
And Creation's last boundary standa
on the shore."
"Stay, thou sailest In vain! 'Tlb In
finity yonder!"
" 'Tis Infinity, too, where thou, Pil
grim, would'st wander!
Eagle thoughts that aspire
Let your proud ptnions tirel
For 'tis here that sweet Phantasy,
bold to i. â¢ last.
Her anchor In hopeless dejection must
cast!"
The superstitious fears of the many,
always particularly alert on the occa
sion of a marriage, culminate in this
final act of the drama. The lifting of
the bride over the threshold or her
stepping across it is the signal in Per
sia, .rf.rabia, and among the Kopts of
EÂ°~'pt for the sacrifice of a groat or a
sheep. Among the Aenezes, according
to Burckhardt, the bridegroom simply
kills a lamb in front of his father-in
law's tent, and the ceremony, but for
the running of the bride from one tent
to another, is complete. Perhaps the
purest symbolical act is that of the
Tranpylvanian Saxon Drida.l pair, who
etep over the threshold with their
hands tied together. Some of these
Transylvanian customs are remark
able, and must be survivals from a
very ancient period. The bridegroom
never wears the shirt made for him by
the bride except on his wedding day
and at his burial, just as the veil of
tha Japanese bride becomes one day
her shroud.WHAT A MAN CAN SEE IN SIX WEEKS WITHOUT MONEY
J. W. Goodkind was stranded in New York without any money* In this predicament he decided to start across the continent for San Francisco, What singular adventures he met with, how he fared and
what sights he saw will be found below:
IT is possible to cross the continent
from New York to Fan Francisco
without a cent of money to start
with and have a gojd time in the
bargain.
J. W. Goodkind has just proved it by
actual trial. He arrived in this city a
few days ago and is now stopping at a
Third street hotel, li-" 1 was six weeks
on the journey and seems to be none
.the worse for his venture.
While traveling in this "Goodkind
fashion" has its disadvantage it is not
a speedy way. and at times becomes
dangerous, but on the other hand it has
its bright side.
Everything depends on how the trav
eler regards life.
While â >!'. th>- j.iurr.ey across the con
tinent Goodkind had some of the most
enjoyable days. Without a cent in his
pock-'t he was whirled ihmugh beauti
ful valleys on fast express trains. He
rode on palace steamers and enjoyed
the sichts "f the great lakes. He vis
ited many cities. He witnessed a num
ber of imp"sins ceremonies. And as a
sort of side jaunt he visited several
noted summer resorts.
Many people would be inclined to
look upon Goodkind's achievement as
a a Ties of hardships, and such indeed
It might be, provided only the hard
ships were picked out. But to a man
who looks at the bright side it has a
good deal of the pleasure trip ;jbout it.
Groodkind* telis his story, it is
plain that he suffered little and en
SOMALILAND, August 3.â Toward the end of my leave
we heard from the natives that elephants had fol
lowed tht- rain down from the hills. The place where
they had been seen was fully three days' march dis
taru. so we struck camp at once and moved off.
On the third day, when returning from an unsuccessful
hunt after a lioness we unexpectedly came acrosp a small
herd of wild elephants. They had evidently got our wind
and were already on the move. So, hurrying around to
leeward, we lay down in the track which they seemed to
be fallowing. As soon as the elephants lost our wind they
apparently lost their heads also for the time being and
for several moments moved round and round in a circle.
This should have been our opportunity, but the shikaries
(trackers) were, over-cautious, ::r.d W-fore we could get
within shot they had disappeared. The following day we
struck off in the direction which yesterday's elephants
seemed to have taken, and during the morning came on the
fresh tracks of what was probably another herd of about
the same size.
Three or four hours' tracking brought us up with the
elephants, which were scattered through the bush, feeding
as they went. The wind was hanily right. As we moved
round we came in full view of a large female elephant, and
BO had to lie motionless where we found ourselves till she
shifted her position, which was not until the whole herd
had moved off. It seemed as if they wert going to escape
us: but we followed steadily and an hour later again came
up with them, this time gathered together in the one place.
I was determined to get a shot if possible, and so, fol
lowed by my shikaries, ran up to the herd in a crouching
position. At first there appeared to be nothing but cows
and calves, the former of which did not charge, as they
often do in similar circumstances, but, herding the calves
together with their trunks, shambled off through the bush.
As I hesitated a moment what to do the bull came crashing
in to join the herd, but turned away the moment he caught
eight of me.
This compelled me to do something at once or allow the
elephant to escape. The only chance was a slim one and
a dangerous one.
Knowing full well that I could not kill the monster I
fired at what I could see of him. The shot took effect In
the way I had expected.
Instantly he stopped, allowing the rest of the herd to
break away through the forest. Then he turned and
caught sight of me. With a snort of rage and pain he
charged through the underbrush. Trees as thick as a
mnn's body he smashed like matches and the earth shook
under his heavy tread as if a railroad train were passing.
This was a most trying moment and called for the
A LIVING TOAD IN A SNAKE.
I should bo obliged by your insr-rting the
following experience if you think it re
markable:
Yesterday we killed an adder (?) here
about 38 inches long, and seeing that he
had made a meal evidently some little
time before, out of curiosity we opened
him and extracted a large tond, which
was about half-way down the snake's in
terior, or about eighteen inchos.
The toad, whose head wa i much wider
than the snake's and whose body was
many times as large as his enemy's head,
we of course all thought must be dead;
and we laid him on a flower bed, wonder-
Inp how h4? could have got inside the
snake at ail, for it certainly seemed a
case of the greater being contained in the
less. Of course we knew the marvelous
stretching powers of a snake's jaws, but
this seemed to eclipse them all.
As we watched the toad he seemed to
move, so we bethought ourselves of try-
Ing to revive him, and, alter pouring
water freely over him and whisky and
water down his throat, we were intense
ly astonished to see him revive, so much
so that he stood upon all-fours, blown out
like a balloon, and made a kind of a dart
at a stick in the most comical way.
Eventually "Jonah," Rn we promptly
christened him, disappeared among the
flowers. ' Can any of your readers quote
a like case of resuscitation? Perhaps
some of them might be able to afford In
formation as to the probable duration of
the toad's entombment.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1893.
road.
"Landing in Buffalo. I went into the
regular washroom at the depot, just
like a first-class passenger, and re
moved all marks of travel. This wash
room was as free to me as if I had been
a paying patron of the road. My
clothes were fairly good and as I sur
veyed myself in the glass I saw that
I presented a fairly good appearance.
"I then hunted a restaurant and told
the proprietor I wanted a bite to eat.
He told me to be seated and brought
out the best he had in the place. You
may be sure I filled up. Then I started
to hunt a job.
"Work was plentiful in Buffalo and
I was soon engaged by a man on the
docks. I had considerable time to my
self and visited all points of interest in
the town. The beautiful parks, the
fine public buildings and any number
of other attractions were all as free as
air.
"But I never forgot while sightsee
ing that I was on my way to San Fran
cisco, so I staid in Buffalo only a few
days, although I must say the town
treated me mighty well.
"Cleveland was my next stopping
place, and I started out with a little
money in my nocket. For 50 cents I
bought a ticket on a lake propeller and
started early in the evening. It was
a most enjoyable moonlight night and
I lay back in a steamer chair, getting
the full benefit of it. . Cabin passen
gers who paid big prices for state
rooms were no better off than I. for it
was too hot to live inside. About mid
night I dozed off and slept until morn
ing.
"Work was not plentiful in Cleveland,
so I put in my time taking in the sights
of the town. I strolled about on the
handsome streets, listened to the mu
sic in the parks and visited all the pub
lic institutions. I staid there only one
day and then took a steamer for To
ledo.
"My second night on the lake was
almost as pleasant as the first. I had
no steamer chair, but had to stretch
out on the deck. However, I slept
comfortably and early in the morning
reached Toledo.
"I got an easy job without any trou
ble and staid in the town several days,
finding the people hospitable and gen
erous. I saw all there was to see and
thoroughly enjoyed myself.
"My next stop was at Detroit, also
on the lake. This stage was not as
romantically pleasant as the others, be-
cause it was not moonlight; but I had
nothing to complain of.
"The Detroit people proved a sorry
lot to me. Work was scarce and grub
was more expensive than at the other
places I had stopped at. I had to econ
omize. But I slept in a eood bed, ate
plenty of fruit, which was cheap, and
had plenty of other things. I kept
myself looking fairly well. There was
not much to see here, but such as it
was I took in and then concluded to
get out.
"Jackson, Mich., was my next stop.
On account of a constitutional short
age in cash I was not spending any
more money than I had to, so I made
the journey on a freight train. There
was no hardship connected with it only
a slight discomfort. The worst blow
I suffered on the trip was when I ar
rived at Jackson and found that it
didn't have a public wash room at the
station just as there had been at all
the other places. You see it was a great
point with me to always look as spruce
and clean as I could when I entered a
city. Work and seeing: sights seemed
to come easier. 1 looked nretty battered
and found out the effect when I struck
a man for a job. He had no use for me.
"This was a lesson that had been
rubbed into me enough and after that
I always specially managed to look
decent whenever I asked for work.
"From now on I simply wandered as
my fancy suited me. Sometimes I
paid small fares and rode for short
distances on the elegant trains chat are
ice Itself could desire, but not by me, nor by this paper, nor by any mortal
tongue could be described the anxiety and the sorrows of my body and
mind, and the destitution and dangers of my son, of my brother and of
my friends.
Ten years already we are bound to this place, lodged <">n the uncovered
decks of, our ships thrown ashore, one against the other; those of my men
who were healthy have deserted me under the Porrasi of Sevilla; my
friends, who remained true to me, are mostly sick or dying; we have con
sumed all food supplies of the Indians, and these have left us now. So, we
are all exposed to starve, and these misfortunes are accompanied by the
worst circumstances, that make me the most unfortunate victim of fate that
this world has ever seen. It seems like God's anger has favored the envy
of Spain, and would punish as criminal deeds the undertakings and dis
coveries that the past ages would have recognized as grand and worthy.
It is evident that one resorts to every means to cut the thread
which is about to break, since I am in my old age, oppressed and afflicted
with unbearable pains of gout, and I am now languishing and dying of this
and other sickness, among the savages, where I cannot find any medicines,
nor proper food for the body, nor a priest, nor sacraments for the soul.
My men are rebelling against me; my brother, my son and those who
remained faithful to me are sick, hungry, dying; the Indians have forsaken
us. The Governor of San Domingo sent to see whether I was dead, rather
than to help us, or to bring me away alive from here, for his boat did not
bring us any letter, nor has communicated with us, nor did they want to
receive any letter from us. I conclude, therefore, that the officers of your
Highness intend that here must end my travels and my life.
Q, holy Mother of God, who has pity on the oppressed, why did not
Bobadilla's knife kill me when he deprived me and my brother of the gold
earned iv such hard manner, and sent us back to Spain without any trial,
constantly running through the coun
try. Sometimes I rode in box cars and
sometimes I walked over the fine coun
try roads. Occasionally I got a lift
from a farmer, but I always made
progress toward the Pacific Coast.
"Whenever a day's work turned up I
did it. If there was no work I kept
moving west. After working a couple
of days at a farm it wes generally the
custom for the people to give me a big
bundle of grub in addition to my pay.
It was always enough to last me sev
eral days. As the weather was pleas
ant I nearly always slept ontdoors
under the shelter of some friendly hay
stack. So you see I needed very little
money.
"Before leaching the Mississippi
River I visited Kalamazoo, Mich., and
spent several hours in the beautiful
public library there. Then I moved
over Into Indiana and took in all the
principal towns, including Wabash,
Logansport. Danville, Decatur, Bloom
ington, Peoria and Burlington. In
most of these cities I was well treated
and could have obtained steady work
at any of the places. But I was bound
for California, the land of plenty. I
was on Westward, ho! business.
'â¢I crossed the Mississippi on a fine
ferryboat and landed in Burlington, la.,
in the best of shape. I was feeling fine
after my three weeks on the road. The
trip did me good physically and I am
sure I improved my mind, for I saw
many strange and curious things.
"There was very little work to be had
in lowa, as I discovered almost as soon
as I arrived. As my few dollars were
growing smaller I concluded to shake
the dust of the State from my feet as
soon as possible. I stuck to freight
cars as much as possible, but occasion
ally got bounced. I managed to see
what there was to see of Dcs Moines
and Ottumwa and got across the State
in three days. lowa is a beautiful
State and a good producer of farm
products, but the people are cold and
work is scarce for walking gentlemen
of the road.
"From Council Bluffs I crossed the
Missouri on a trolley car and landed in
Omaha, where the big exposition was
in progress. I spent a couple of days
taking in the sights. The exposition
alone was well worth my trip. Words
cannot describe it. I saw more than I
ever expect to see again and thorough
ly enjoyed myself. Just a much so as
if I paid to get in and stopped at the
tinest hotel in town. Omaha is very
hospitable. That is, without any money
I found it so.
"Almost broke I pulled out of Omaha,
on a stock train. Then my troubles
began. I had struck the thin edge of
the Western country. Food was scarce,
work scarcer and the landscape deary.
Across Nebraska it was flat and bare,
and then desolate mountains rose on all
sides as I got into Wyoming..
"Utah was no more encouraging.
"By the time I crossed the Nebraska
line my money was practically all gone
and I had to go along as a 'bum.'
Water to wash with there was none,
and I even went thirsty on more than
one occasion. Food was hard to get be
cause the people who might have given
it to me had not enough for them
selves.
"At night I always slept on the
ground, and occasionally I passed
nights of horror when I heard- the wild
beasts howling around me. Frequently
I heard rattlesnakes hissing near me,
and had to get up and build a fire to
keep them away.
"Ogden was an oasis in the desert,
but times are hard in the State and I
could not get work there. However, I
was well fed and given a place to sleep,
so that the few days I was there I
thoroughly recuperated, and with a
scant layer of fat on my ribs I pushed
on West.
"I got a job in a hay field near Bat
tle Mountain for a few days. The
monpy I earned there got me some
clothes when I got to Reno, so that
when I neared the California line I was
looking like a gentleman. Once more
I began to really enjoy life after those
horrible weeks I had spent on the
deserts of Wyoming, Utah and Nevada.
"At Truckee I thought I had struck
Paradise. Beautiful mountains, cool
streams, big trees and hospitable peo
ple. Food was plenty and nobody

Having shot one elephant I now only wanted one more
specimen. That night elephants watered in a water hole
close to the zeriba (camp). We went after them before
daybreak and were still following 'at â¢ midday when we
found where the tracks had been crossed during the night
by a larger herd, in which were several bulls. These latter
we followed and presently â  discovered gathered together
under a shady forest tree, where the flies seemed to bother
them less than elsew here. The wind blew, in the right direc
tion so the stalk was comparatively easy. I gave the
nearest bull the heart shot with the right barrel, and as
they. paused before moving. off, ran forward and fired the
left into what I thought was the head of the same elephant.
All disappeared in the bush, but, on following up, trumpet
ing in front told us the bullets had taken effect. We found
not only one elephant lying dead, as I had expected but
two.
I had evidently fired at two different animals and thus
unintentionally killed a third elephant. Both had fallen
fully fifteen miles from camp, so we found it necessary to
return at once.
Heavy rain fell during the night and by the time we left
the zeriba the following morning all tracks seemed to an.
unpracticed eye obliterated. The Somalis, however, soon
picked up what remained of the trail, by means of which
we were enabled to discover the dead elephants, cut out
the ivory and take these photographs.

who see all my sufferings, have mercy

poor Christopher Columbus, when they will learn that he. risking his own
life and that of his brother, with very little or no expense to the crown

mortal being has ever rendered to any prince or to any country, and not

â¢what I have done, just as if the discovery of this new world should be of
harm to the old one, and as a punishment for this it would allow my life
to end in this miserable place, you, good angels, you, who help the oppressed
and the innocents, bring this sheet to my grand lady. She knows how much
I have done; she will believe what I have suffered for her glory and service;
she will be just and kind enough not to allow that the children of the one
who gave Spain such untold wealth, such vast and unknown kingdoms and
empires, should be without any food and should only live of alms.
She, if she lives, will consider that cruelty and ungratefulness will ex

Spain will suffer what just now her envious, malignant and ungrateful teo

diminished from a little over five and
a half persons to a little less than five.
Figures prove that people in the
Southern States have the largest num
ber of children, while in New England
the families axe smallest. For an il
lustration, Louisiana has double as
many children under five years as
Maine, in proportion to population.
Out of every 100 persons in the
United States 51.21 are males and 45.79
are females. The excess of men over
women in the entire country, there
fore, is very large. Ten per cent of
the women and 1 per cent of the mi n
marry between 15 and 20. In the total
population the proportion of divorced to
married persons is about one to 100; but
among- the native whites it is a little
higher than that, and among the ne
groes it is largest. The proportion of
divorced people in the Atlantic States
is less than half of 1 per cent; in the
Mississippi Valley it is between one
half and 1 per cent, and in the far
West it ranges from 1 to- 2 per cent.
Thirteen out of every 10,000 people in
the United States are in prison. Sev
enteen out of every 10,000 are insane,
the number being divided almost
equally between- the sexes. Race
seems to have a marked relation to
mental disturbances. Nineteen out of
every 10,000 whites are crazy, while
only nine out of every 10.000 colored
folks are similarly afflicted. Of the na
tive whites fourteen out of every 10,0*30
are mad, and of the foreign-born 39
out of every 10,000. This fieems to
prove that colored folks are much
less liable to insanity than whites, and
the foreign-born much more so "than
native Americans.
The tendency to insanity is greatest
among the Irish and next among the
Hungarians. It is comparatively small
among the Germans and British, and
least of all among the Canadians.
Women go crazy later In life than men
do, apparently.
Fifteen out of every 10.000 people in
this country are idiots or feeble-mind
ed. Of these 55 per cent are males and
45 per cent females. Race again
seems to have an important influence
in this matter. Sixteen out of every
10.000 whites are feeble-minded and
only fourteen out of every 10,000 col
ored. The tendency toward idiocy ap
pears to be greatest among those of
Hungarian stock and least among
those of Italian oriein.
Seven out of every 10,000 inhabitants
of the United States . are deaf and
dumb. Of these 55 percent are males
and 45 per cent females. The affliction
is much less common among colored
people â¢ than among whites. Agafn in
this case the Hungarians are the great
est sufferers, fourteen out of every 10,

are the Russians, while the Italians
are but little troubled with this sort
of defect. Eight out of every 10,000

Measles range most persistently in the

AN EARTHQUAKE
0 lustration Is from a photograph, and gives some idea of the
â \ loience of the gTeat earthquake which visited India on June 12,
commencing at 5:10 p. m., and lasting from three to seven minutes.
It was a far-reaching earthquake. On the east it was reported to
have been felt even at the farthest extremity of Assam and Akya
in Burma; on the south at Masulipatum in Madras and at Ellichphur, in
Berar. On the north it was felt at Khatmandu, the capital of Nepal
and at Gnatong, on the frontier of Sikkim, it was severe enough to over
throw some of the barrack chimneys. it was reported to have disturbed
the Grand Llama at Lhassa! Thus the range of the shock extended over
an area 1500 miles long and 1000 miles broad, or 1,275,000 square miles in all
The Government asked the station masters and railway men to report the
damage done in their districts, and among the matter sent in in reply were
the two photographs which we reproduce. One shows the effect of the
earthquake on the rails; and the other shows gaps and chasms made in
proximity to the railway line.
The destructive force of the earthquake reached its maximum in Shjl
long, Cherrapunji and Tura. In Shillong it may be said without exagger
ation, that the Biblical curse was carried out literally, and not one stone
was left standing on another. All masonry buildings in this place had
been leveled to the ground, and this not by overthrow merely, but by a bat
tering of the walls into fragments, on the top of which the roof subsided
parachutewise. According to the seismometers at Shillong, the shock
while it lasted was at least equal to a backward and forward shake of 7

RENE BACHE.ARE STRUGGLING TO REACH THE POLES
TO THE NORTH POLE
BY ICE BREAKER.
ADMIRAL MAKAROFr, the well
known explorer of the North
Pacific, is making preparations
to reach the north pole. And
he declares that he is sure of
success.
His Intention If to cut a way through
the ice fields by means of powerful ice
breakers thnt at present are in course
of construction.
The ice breaker is a craft with a good
record behind it. The first one put in
use whs at Cronstadt, Russia, in 1864.
Since then numbers have been built in
this country. Alon<? the Eastern Ca
nadian const they are In constant use

TO THE SOUTH POLE
BY DOG TEAM.
THE fine steam bark Southern
Cross has just sailed on her ad
venturous voyage to reach the
south pole. The desolate regions
which girdle the southern, end of
the axis upon which our globe Is
ever spinning have the great merit of
offering a terra Incognita to the ex
plorer. C. E. Borchgrevink, who will
lead the expedition, tells us that he
would not be surprised to find a new
race of men. Who knows, then, that
he may not bring an Antarctic de
Rougemont back with him? No polar
bear has ever been seen in these white
wiMernesses. But there is no reason
why that animal may not be encoun
tered â a new variety.
It is the supposed absence of mam- j
mals, however, in the interior which
will form one of the chief difficulties of
the expedition. A mere tabloid is but
an indifferent substitute for a bear
Bteak hot and smoking. Luckily, how
ever, the country teems with sea birds,
arid these and their eggs will be large
ly used to supplement the bounteous
stores which Sir George Newnes, who
haa generously fitted out the expedi
tion, has crammed into the hold of the
Southern Cross. From morn till night
stowed away an amaz
ing variety of fixidstuffs.
The vefcss< 1 in which the venture will
be made was originally a whaler and

could instantly convert Itself into a fly

The general appearance of the hull
of an ice breaker differs little from an
ordinary steamer. But it is built
of heavy steel and its prow is heavily
armored. Each vessel is fitted with
twin screws at the stern and a single
large screw at the prow. The engines
are of the finest and the horsepower is
always very high.

The ingenuities that are devised now
adays for expeditions of all sorts,
whether they are to penetrate the frigid
or the torrid zone, are innumerable,
once the basis o* supplies is reached
the question of transport is all-govern
ing; so a pound of beef may be repre
sented by a dozen lozenges. The gal
lant adventurers of old had no such
facilities, and scurvy brought many a
party to a deadly and horrible end.
Not one ease occurred on the Fiam.
But it is not for the food alone that
the equipment of this Antarctic expe
dition is remarkable. Guns, skis, kay
aks, Bnow shoes, ice axes, sledges, furs,
sleeping bags, instrumentsâ all have
been selected with a view to the work
in contemplation, and are really a re
markable collection. The ninety Sa
tnoyed dogs alone cost close on to $10,
000, and to gather them an agent was
specially dispatched to Siberia, mak
ing a journey of 4000 miles for the pur
pose. Sir ( leorge Newncs placed $100,
000 at the disposal of Borchgrevink to
outfit the expedition.
Mr. Borchgrevink expresses himself
very hopeful that most valuable re
sults will be the issue of the expedition.
In 1841 Sir James Ross first sighted
the vast ice fields which he called Vic
toria Land, lie made the best of his
way around a small bit of the coast,
saw and named Mount Erebus, a vol
cano 12,000 feet in height, Mount Ter
ror and many other points. But his
passage to the Interior was barred by
a lofty ice wall, which seemed to pro
hibit all attacks upon it. Mr. Borch
grevink, who was the first man to land
the- re since those remote days, regards
this barrier with less diffidence. His
appliances will enable him to storm it,
and when once atop he hopes to find a
vast table land of snow, over which

Taking into account that, according
to Nansen, the ice walls (toroaes) in
the Arctic basin seldom attain thy /
height of 25 feet, and that the Polar
Sea is free from ice over, at least, a
third of its surface, while all the ice
is weakened in summer by thawms,
and especially by interior canals due
to accumulations of salt, and by crev
ices, Admiral Makaroff concludes that
an ice-breaking steamer of 20,000 horse- |
power would overcome all the llfficul
ties which polar ice may oppose to her
progress. j
The distance between the latitude of '
78 degrees north to the pole being .20
miles, he calculates the various speeds

her way through ice of various thick

Moreover, instead Of one ice brciKer j

jment in Russia that two ice breakers ,

rear one pushing the front one by
â  means of a special wooden frame, act
as effectively as one single ice breaker
of a double force.
Admiral Makaroff's intention is,

and autumn to make things snug, climb
the ice wall and get the hang of the
country before the long and dreary
winter sets in. The Antarctic spring,
that is about September, 1899, they will
expect the Southern Cross.
According to the plan adopted the
land party and sea party will then Join
forces and make a bold dash for the

Mr. Borchgrevink goes with the
strong belief that Victoria Land may
prove another Greenland. Nansen's
chief difficulty in that venture was the
landing. Once ashore he, too, had
an ice wall to surmount, and having
reached it found the vast table land
over which he and his men sailed and
sledged to the other side." Of course
there Is no "other side" to Victoria
Land â at least they will never try to
reach it, Antartica covering an area of
some ten million square miles. But if
there is a plateau, no matter how
scored with crevasses, they should give
a good account of themselves.
Here is what Mr. Borchgrevink has
to say of the venture: "While the main
object of the expedition will be to col
lect scientific data, full attention will
also be given to further investigation of
the commercial possibilities of the
southern seas, of the islands and of the
shores of Victoria Land, and the ship
will therefore be fitted out with the ne
cessary implements for such research.
I still maintain my belief in a future
for commercial energy in those parts,
both In regard to the gruano beds and
also in respect to whaling and sealing.
However, my scientific staff will have
their entire energy directed to scientific
research.

WHY OUR NAVY
SHOOTS SO WELL
SINCE the welcome news of Admir
al Dewey's remarkable victory at
Manila on the Ist of May It has
been a matter for wonder every
where, not less in the United States
than in Europe, that the American
gunners were able to destroy a Spanish
squadron in a Spanish harbor without
the loss of a single American life. When
history repeated itself at Santiago two
months later the wonder was intensi
fied.
In the Government building at the
Trana-Mississippi Exposition is an ex
hibit which in a measure explains the
mystery. This Is a naval range finder,
the invention of a United States naval
officer. Up to date no one outside of
Uncle Sam's service has been able to
discover how it is operated. The in
strument is shown In a glass case with
various other nautical paraphernalia,
and of course the attendants refuse to
answer questions as to its method of
working.
One of the naval officers in charge of
the exhibit says:
an adequate outfit of instruments, pro
visions, dogs and sledges and to estab
lish my winter quarters at that spot.
Semi-globular huts, constructed on the
Eskimo principle and \uilt out of hard

been landed the vessel will proceed

76 degrees south, where my companions
and I will be landed (all must neces
sarily be snow-shoe runners), with our
instruments, dogs, sledges, provisions
and other necessaries for the inland
"It fs a fact that no other navy has
any means of finding the range that
does not involve a mathematical cal
culation. This implies a good deal of
time lost, and in most cases they find
it quicker to get the range by actual
experiment. The Spaniards, for in
stance, have to fire several shots be
fore they can get the range of one of
Uncle Sam's ships. If their first shot
falls short they try again and then
they are apt to overshoot, and by that
time the position of the vessels may
have been altered and they are still at
sea. Meanwhile the officer in the con
ning tower of the American ship has
located them almost exactly with this
instrument and reported the range by
telephone to the various gun captains
This has only consumed a few seconds,
and while the Spaniards are still trying
to get their range the shells from the
American guns are sweeping their
decks.
"The. peculiar thing about the instru
ment," continued the officer, "is that
while it is one of the simplest things
in the world to any one who knows Its
secrets, the most expert mechanic or
inventor might examine it as long as
he wanted to and still be unable to dis
cover how it works. This is why rep
resentatives of other navies have been
Journey toward the sou h magnetic
pole.
"If I succed in landing on Victoria
Land at that latitude I shall have to
cross about ten degrees of longitude in
a westerly direction to reach the place
where the south magnetic pole (accord
ing to dip-compass observations) ought
to be situated In latitude 75 degrees 5
minutes south, longitude 150 degrees
east, or about 150 English miles; thÂ«
longitudes at 76 degrees south being
about fifteen miles apart.
"I hope to have covered the distance
inland and back in two months, in
which time I shall have made the
necessary magnetic observations, and
again join the camp at Cape Adalr be
fore the Antarctic winter sets in.
"My scientific staff at Cape Adair will
meanwhile have been occupied in ex
ploring the bay at Victorlla Land, in
taking deep water soundings, investi
gating the fjords, and in collecting
specimens of the fauna and flora, be
completely baffled In their efforts to
find it out. They have range finders of
their own. but none that give the same
instantaneous and accurate results.
And as long as they can be kopt in
the dark we shall be able to outshoot
any nation on earth, even if there was
no difference in the skill of the gun
ners."
There is another advantage In the use
of the instrument which amounts to
considerable in the course of half a
dozen naval engagements. It costs
$1360 to fire a pair of 13-inch guns once.
If the Spaniards go into a fight they
must fire at least two shots to secure
the range. Frequently these do not
answer, and they go on shooting $680
charges in the air, while every pound
of powder that goes into the United
States' gun is utilized. The ability of
the American gunners to obtain the ex
act position of the enemy before a gun
is fired saves thousands of dollars in
ammunition in every engagement.
COLONIAL POSSESSIONS OF THE
NATIONS.
Now that the question of colonial ex
pansion and "imperialism" is up for
discussion the following figures show
sides making pendulum observations,
taking meteorological data, etc.
"The whaler wil lreturn to Australia
or Tasmania, both because it would be
safer for the vessel and because It
could do so valuable work among the
islands between Australia and Victoria
Land during the latter part of the An
tipodean winter. It would be safer, be
cause it would avoid the danger of the
ice pressure in winter and because It
could start fresh for Victoria Land
the succeeding spring for the purpose
of bringing the members of the expe
dition back to civilization.
"In zoological direction I expect great
discoveries to be made, especially on
the Victoria continent itself. So far we
know that the Antarctic circle is the
home of fish, whales, seals and birds of
the most widely different kinds, but
undoubtedly ther* are also In those re
gions hitherto unknown mammals."
COUNTING ThE STROKES.
"Now that you have finished shaving
me, how many strokes of the razor did
it require?" asked the man in the chair,
as he straightened up to have his hair
combed.
"That's pretty hard to tell," said the
barber. . , ..

"Fifteen years."
"You ought to know by this time about

"All right. What's your guess? Re
member that I have a hard beard."
"Well. I should say about 125."
"You're a pood guesser, I don't think.
Some time ago I got into the habit of

time I was being shaved. It's a good way
to employ your mind. In shaving me you

awaited him. But he was cheerful
about It and seemed in as good health
as he had for two or three years,
though wearied by recent overwork.
Having passed the age of 91 and done

years before the great Mormon Temple
at Salt Lake was completed, and tÂ»-n
years before the site was selected, it
â¢was revealed to him that he should
dedicate to the Lord a temple on the
Bhore of a new Diad Sea. He had not
then the slightest intimation where tint
temple would be builded, nor In what
part of the world the counterpart of
the Dead Sea in Palestine might be
found.
The dedication occurred on the Cth of
April. 1593, the ceremonies covering sev
eral days. He had been in feeble
health for some time and the activity
of mind and body occasioned by his
duties in those events caused a slight
relapse, from which, however, he fioon
recovered.
On March first of that year occurred
the last public celebration of his and
his wife's birthday, when he sent out
to the people the following invitation:
"On Monday, March 1, is my
birthday, and the birthday of
Mrs. Emma Woodruff. On that
day I shall be 90 years of agre

si r.s elony the way.
From childhood Wilford Woodruff's
lifi was v series of chapters of acci
dents and events. In the last general
conference of the Mormon church, held
at the Salt Lake Tabernacle in the 7th
day of last April, he delivered his last
public address to the whole peooie. It
was accepted as prophetic of . the end
that he should then tell the story of his
life Hf related many ir.ckler.ts, as it
seemed to him, of miraculous escapes
from .death. He had almost every bone
tn his body broken, except the neck
and the back; was thrown into a cal-
dron of toiling water when threa years
old; was barely saved from drowning
in his yi uth, and Â«-;is badly frozen in
a Connecticut blizzard at the ago of 15.
Among other remarkable instances of
escape from death he related this:
"President Young said he wanted
me to take my family and go to Hus
ton, and stay there till I could gather
all the Saints of God in New England
and Canada and brin-- them to Zion.
That was the mission he gave me on
my return from the pioneer -lourney to
winter quarters. I went in the spring,
as he told me, and took my family.
We came one evening to one of the
brethren's houses in Indiana. Several
of us were there. Orson Hyde had a
team as well as myself. We drove
ir.t" a l<>n?r yard. I set my carriage
within six inches of hip. I had my
wife and children with me. I tied my
animals to an oak tree on the side of
where we camped. I went to bed in
my carriage. As I lay down the
spirit of the Lord told me to get up
and move ny carriage. I did not ask
the Lord what he meant. I did as I
wns told. The Fame spirit told me to
go 'and move my animals away from
that tree. I did that. My wife asked
me why I did it. I told her I did not
know. I had r.ot been in bed twenty
minutes when there came a whirlwind
and took that oak tree, which had
stood there perhaps fifty years, split it
right through the trunk, and it swept
both of those fences where my carriage
had stood. It never touched Brqther
Hyde's carriage, but it would have
crushed me and my family to the 'earth
if I had not listened to the voice of the
spirit.
"That preserving power," he con
tinued. " has followed me all the way
through my life. It has been with me
upon my missions abroad as well as at
home. It has followed me until the
present day, and I have been placed in
a great many strange places.
"I was ordained to dedicate this Salt
Lake Temple fifty years before it was
dedicated. I knew I should live to ded
icate that temple. I did live to do it."
While President Woodruff held that
the miraculous preservation of his life
formed the chief Incidents and the ded
ication of the temple the greatest event
fads of older cities, but at last she has
made up her mind to give her citizens
of his career, I am disposed, writing
as I do from a Gentile point of view,
to count as the most remarkable page
in the unique history of the Mormons
and Utah that one written by him in
September, 1890, which contained the
startling proclamation that polygamous
marriage would no longer be cele
brated by the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints. When this de
cision was sustained on the 6th day of
October of that year by nearly fifteen
thousand members of the church as
sembled at the tabernacle in annual
conference, and issued as a manifesto
that proclamation opened the door to^
statehood for Utah and revolutionized
her social fabric. It made possible the
separation of church and state and the
reconstruction of the civil policy of the
Territory on national party lines.
In 1833, at the age of 26, Wilford
Woodruff journeyed with his father
from his birthplace at Farmington,
Conn., to Oswego, N. V., and Joined the
Mormons. When they were driven into
exile and came to Nauvoo, 111., young
Woodruff accompanied them, and wnen
Brigliam Young crossed the plains and
desert to the modern land of Canaan
at the head of an ambitious band of
pioneers Wilford Woodruff accom
panied him as one of the twelve
apostles of the church and helped to
lay out the site of the present city of
Salt Lake.
For many years Apostle Woodruff
was the most' successful of the mission
aries sent out from Utah by Brigham
Young. It was he that drew into the
church some two thousand United
Brethren and fifty ordained ministers
of that faith. It was in the time of
Joseph Smith tliat he made the Journey
to Fox Island in 1539 at the time of the
great apostasy in Kirtland, N. V., and
there received the letter from the
an opportunity to display their cat
treasures.
There are three regular "catteries,"
or "cat kennels," which are run by San
Franciscans at the present time, and
all of these are devoted, because* ot
the popular demand for members of this
particular breed, to the raising of An
goras. All the long-haired cats are
comprised in the four varieties pre
viously mentioned and were formerly
known under the generic appellation of
"French cats," as they were originally
imported into England, and thence to
the United States, from France, where
they were, for many years valued as
pets before the English people awoke
to a sense of their real beauty and de
sirable Qualities.
A San Francisco gentleman, the pro
prietor of the Alameda County Kennels
in Fruitvale, was the first one in this
vicinity to recognize the fact that cat
raising can, if managed intelligently,
be made a profitable business. The first
female cat that he owned was the cel
ebrated Lady Tatters, one of the gems
of the Johnson collection, and Beauty
Boy, a fine silver gray, was brought
across the continent for a mate. Mar

is a granddaughter of this couple, and
is almost a perfect likeness of her
grandsire, who was unfortunately ac
cidentally killed before he had been
long on the coast.
Leon, son of the famous Duke Haw
thorne of Walnut Ridge farm, in Mas
sachusetts, was sent for to take his
place, and his kittens are in great de
mand among Western cat fanciers. He
is a pure white cat with blue eyes and
a magnificent coat, ruff and tail, and
is one of the largest of his kind.
Lady Tatters is a tortoise-shell An
gora, and outside of her multiplicity
of "points" Is especially noted for her
love for kittens. The share of philo
pfogenitiveness which has fallen to her
lot altogether exceeds the demand rrJade
upon it by her own numerous offspring.
She is nevor contented with the num
ber of kittens which fate bestows uron
her, but makes a practice of adopting
every litter from which she can man
age to drive tÂ»o rightful owner. Very
recently she added two different fami
lies of* three kittens each to her own
four and cared for the whole success
fully. At the present time she is

baptized one hundred persons on the
island. There are many other instances
of his missionary work that would be

seivt-s.
President Woodruff war the fourth
pucctssive ruler of the Mormon church.
Hripham Young succeeded Joseph
Smith, who died in jail at Nauvoo. 111.,
on June 27, 1844; John Taylor became
president in 1877 at the death of Brig
ham Young, and in IsÃ7, at the death
of Taylor, Apostle Woodruff succeeded
to the presidency. He retained as his
counselors George Q. Cannon and
Joseph F. Smith, who were selected by
his immediate predecessor.
Following is the complete list of the
apostles as they stood before the death
of President Woodruff, riven in the
order that tht-y should succeed to the
old and three of Marvel's who have
blindly stumbled through only forty
eight hours of existence.
Lady Tatters has line manners, as
becomes her aristocratic lineage. She
is the owner of an elegantly carved
high chair, presented to her by some
of her numerous admirers, in which she
sits at mealtimes on a silk cushion with
a bib tied about her neck, and eats her
food daintily from a china plate, sip
ping milk occasionally the while from
a china cup placed beside it.
There are about thirty cats in this
establishment, of which the most not
able, besides those already mentioned,
are Valentine, Esau, Royal and Dandy
of the white variety. Trilby, with jet
black fur that almost sweeps the
ground, and Topaz, a handsome red
colored cat with Tabby markings and
eyes that just match his coat.
H. McCracken of the Presidio St.
Bernard Kennels is not only fond of
cats, but recognizes their commercial
value and is making arrangements to
add to his breeding establishment in
the very near future by importing a
famous cat from Europe.
Among his present stock is specially
noticeable Cinderella, a Chartreuse blue
Angora, whose grandfather, Duke
Hawthorne, cost the small fortune of
$1000 and took first prize at the Crystal
Palace cat show on his first public ap
pearance. Cinderella is now attending
to the wants of the six pure white male
kittens, of which she is the proud
mamma, and Apollo, a handsome blue
eyed, white furred creature, is the cold
ly indifferent father.
Apollo and Daphne, who Is also a
pure white pussy with all the charac
teristics which mark the Persian-An
gora, are the parents of six-months-old
Dewey, a round ball of swan's down
for which $50 has already been offered
and refused. In the opinion of those
who are authorities on such subjects
Dewey is certain to be a "big winner
when he has the opportunity to exhibit
his perfections in public.
The only woman who has yet gone
into the business of cat breeding on a
wide scale is Mrs. A. H. Hoag, who has
a large establishment on Ellis street
entirely devoted to the raising of the
much-prized long-hair varieties Airs
Hoag's two-year-old White Muggins is
acknowledged to be the largest Angora
on the coast and he is as beautiful as
he is sizable. Sweetheart, his mother
is a very large female and is noted not
only for her personal attractiveness
but for the number of kittens which
she presents to her beloved mistress

At the moment of the death of Presi
dent Woodruff Apostle Lorenzo Snow,
who is now 84 years of age, became
president of the apostles and will no
doubt be elevated, as all his predeces
sors had been, to the presidency of the
church, with power to select two coun
selors. Until that occurs, however.

kittens in a f mily is no uncommon
thing for this enterprising feline, and
when one realizes that none of her lit
tle ones ever sell for less than $15 each
her value as a source of income be
comes very apparent.
Among Mrs. Hoag's other white cats
are Adelina Patti, Tiixy, Pet. Jack and
Bijou, the latter a lovely snowy little
creature whose father is White Mug
gins and mother Friskerina. Pet's
father was Prince Poniatowski's fa

Brown Muggins is a tiger cat strik

lambent yellow eyes. His father is Mr.
Paxton's well-known and highly valued
Black Tom, who is said to be one of the
finest tiger Angoras in the country.
Friskerina is the dean of the estab
lishment. She is also a "tiger" and is
the daughter of Mrs. Johnson's almost
priceless Captain Jinks.
Three little orphan kittens are at the
present time engaging Mrs. Hoag's
special attention. Their mother, for
reasons best known to herself, has con

concerning them and in consequence

from this artificial source and at the
same time claw the air to make the
flow come quicker is something to be
remembered.
Besides "professional" cats there are,
as has been said, many privately owned
beauties who will undoubtedly compete
for prizes. Among the long-haired
species Dr. Fred W. D'Evelyn's Sheik
of El Tab, a pure Persian, which won
the silver cup at the Newton (England)
cat show, will attract much notice. It
is hoped also that Mrs. A. G. Rodriguez
will consent to exhibit her Mewmew,
as he is said to be the handsomest and
most valuable short-haired cat on the
coast. Mewmew is one of the famous
and Shard-to-obtain royal cats of Siam.
He is absolutely pure blooded and was
brought by Mrs. Rodriguez herself
from Bangkok. He weighs over twenty
pounds, is only two years old and looks,
as to his fur, far more like an otter
than a member of the cat family. He
has all the distinguishing marks of the
true royal breedâ black muzzle, ears
legs and tail, seal brown back, fawn
colored collar and cream-colored breast
and turquoise-blue eyes. Unlike most
of his kind, however, which snap and
bite like dogs instead of scratching like
other cats when annoyed, Mewmew Is
the soul of amiability. He does not '
care for milk and will not eat meat of
any kind, either raw or cooked His
sole diet is boiled fish, carefuly freed
from bones, and plenty of clear cold
water. v
DEWEY.Presidio kennels; six months old;
biue-eyed white Angora.How
I Was Presented
To the Pope
BY A CALIFORNIA GIRL.
WE accidentally made the ac
quaintance of one of the
dignitaries of the church,
Monsignore V.. who proved
to be a valuable and charm
ing friend. We availed our
selves of his invitation and visited him
several times in his apartments, Rue
Crociferi. We were received by an aged
and dignified female who, after our
first visit, greeted us most effusively
and always insisted upon our waiting if
Monsignore happened to be out, thus
indicating that our presence was agree
able to the master. We were discreet
enough not to call for nearly a wwk,
but our curiosity to see how a priest
lived and received in Rome induced us
finally to venture.
The apartments consisted of a num
ber of rooms, those we saw being lofty
and vast and distinguished by that
coldness and somberness that is so
characteristic of Italian interiors. Our
host was very unaffected and commun
icative and we passed many pleasant
and profitable hours with him. On the
floor above was the apartment of his
aged father, of whom he spoke in the
most affectionate terms, declaring that
upon his death he should retire to a
monastic life. On the ground floor wts
his private chapel and we were invited
and attended a special function therein
at a later date.
Before leaving we were asked why
â¢we had not figured at a large reception
held by his Holiness the preceding day.
We answered that we were only pass
ing through Rome and knew no one
nor had we brought any credentials
with us. We had heard that it was
very difficult to obtain admission to one
of these receptions and we had not evtn
dreamed of attempting it.
< uir kind host immediately Informed
us that he would be delighted to reader
us this little service.
Little! when we knew of people who
had traveled thousands of miles and
had spent many dollars in vain efforts
tn attain this privilege.
We were unfortunately out when
Munsignore called upon us a few days
later, but he left word that the Pope
would accord a private reception to a
select few in a couple of days and that
we had but to sec our Consul and ob
tain his guarantee and he would attend
to the rest. Our dear little hostess
was all in a flutter over the advent of
our distinguished visitor whom she had
received in our absence and assured us
that we were most fortunate in having
such a powerful friend. The next
evening the huissier of the Pope ar
rived in his quaint costume, bringing
us our formal invitation, for vvhich he
received his proper pourboire.
Fortunately for us, the regulation
toilet was of the simplest â a plain black
dress, a black veil in iieu "f a bonnet
and no gloves. Even our Blender ward
robe was equal to this emergency, with
the aid of our lively hostess who lent
up one lace scarf and who arranged
our headgear for us in graceful and
picturesque manner. My friend looked
very handsome with her beautiful
white hair framed In by the black lace,
and I, being dark, could easily have
passed for an Italian.
Before dressing, my thoughtful com
panion, who was born a Catholic and
â  luently understood the value of
BUCfI things, bought a number of rosa
ries, crosses and medals, intending to
have them blessed and then distribute
them among more fervent devotees
than herself.
As we drove in our open carriage the
rntire length of Rome, for our apart
ments were near the Pincio, we felt a
very unchristian spirit of pride animat
ing us, for we knew that every om> was
aware of our destination. It seemed
estrange when we arrived in front of the
magnificent temple of St. Peter to turn
to the left, and entering a gate, drive
behind the immense pile. We were duly
jlted and armed with our invita
tion, were piloted along corridors and
up a noble staircase, through several
handsome apartments from the win
dows of which we could see into the
pleasant gardens, where his Holiness
takes his exercise and his simple recre
ation.
The room into which we were fln-vlly
ushered was square and lofty, with a
green carpet on the floor and hung
with superb tapestries which we had
full leisure to admire. Otherwise it
was devoid of furniture save a row of
chatrs along the four walls. We were
among the last to enter and inter-?Bt r ;d
ourselves while waiting with watching
our companions and wondering what
motives hnd brought them there,
(imibting not but that as many came
from pride or curiosity as from real de
votion.
We were surprised to find that the
men outnumbered the women, and th^t
most of thÂ«*m had uninteresting and
unintelligent faces. TheTe were seve
lal priests and one very large fine look-
Ing German. Most of the company
were supplied with souvenirs like our-
BflveÃ. and a priest who sat next to us
had ;t large flat box flUed with tiuy
medalr. There must have been hun
dred 9 of them.
HÂ« will draw a fine revenue from
thnt." whlspprod my friend. "There
are thousands of people who would nny
liinr'-somHy for a medal blessed by the
Prpf's own hands."
Whilf- we were waiting, a lady nrnl
hr daughter passed through the rwm
in*o the apartment beyond, in which
his Holiness was ready to receive them.
Many wprÂ» the whispers around us ?S
to her wpalth and influence which, in
deed, must he great to. have attained
puch a signal honor. She was a for
eigner, of course, and had spent iPJiny
thousands of dollars on the church.
It was probably true, but we knew
that money was not always necessary
t.- obtnln such privileges. In a quar
t<M of an hour the ladles came bustling
th;ough with an air of great Impor
tance* Tt seemed to ub that they hid
vislMy swelled.
Suddenly there waa a slight hum ard
two uphers entered and announced his
Holiness. *
Fvery one rose, and then, as th*Â» ven
erable man entered, all kneltâwith the
ovrei'tlon of the tall German nml his
buxom wife. Though a wretched he

Veforo the reverend man who stooil bt
fore up. partly supported by two 'â¢â sh
ers. â¢ Thepe usherÃ had coats of red
brocaded pUk. short breeches, stockings
and low phoes.
Hiii Holineps wore a long full gown
of plain white wool, a whito nkull cap
and a heavy flnwing red cloak, which
was sustained by the uphers. H'b face,
bo familiar to the world from his ex
cellent r)ortrritp, in not hnnfliome, but
It. In full of a lofty intelligence, a
â¢phrewd pommnn sen*Â« and a. kindly hu
manity tbtt mÂ«Vo It sinffularly sympa
thetl<Â» and winnlnir.
Aftsr p. nhort prayer be i made the
rounds. The master of ceremonies took
the invitation from the hand of each
person, looked at his list and read the
name and address to his Holiness, who
addressed him a polite phrase, and
then raising his folded hands above the
head blessed the individual and passed
on tn the next,
I remember the first one presented
was a priest and that he wished to kiss
the sandal of the Pope, who gently but
firmly prevented him.
When he arrived before the German
he shook hands with him as man to
man and commenced speaking in Eng
lish, asking him some appropriate
questions about Dublin.
The German answered in his native
language, which caused the Pope to
look inquiringly at the master of cere
monies.
"Berlin, your Holiness, not Dublin,"
answered the latter.
His Holiness looked annoyed, but re
sumed the conversation in German, and
we distinctly caught the name of Bis
marck.
When he addressed us my friend re
plied in French and he responded in
that tongue. He spoke of the distance
we had come from California" and asked
several questions about the church
here, to which my friend was able to
answer intelligently.
He added, looking at me. "This is
your daughter," to which she replied,
"Yes, though I enjoy that privilege
only by adoption."
"She will live to be a blessing to you
in your old age." he said in the kindest
tone. "Bless her. your Holiness," said
tny friend, and he gently laid his hands
on my head, not over it, and blessed me
so warmly that * felt the tears come
to my oyps.
Then my friend seized his hands in
her own and actually placed them on
her parcel, running his fingers over the
medals.
It was an audacious act, but he only
smiled and blessed her with a suspicion
of humor in his bright kindly eyes.
We asked the master of ceremonies
to return our invitation, as we wished
to keep it as a souvenir, but he inform
ed us it was utterly against the rules.
But I have never yet found any nni
who could resist my white haired
friend, and he finally yielded, ftaring,
I believe, that she might appeal to his
Holiness himself.
A general blessing finished the cere
monies and we were all dismissed.
What pleasure those medals blessed
by the Pope's own hands have given to
the friends to whom they were distrib
uted! One fervent believer is sure that
it cured her of a painful disease. An
other dear old lady, to whom a rosary
had been given, died not long after in
the firm belief that it had procured her
admission to Paradise and begged that
it be -burled with her.
By accident my friend had seized her
purse with the other articles and she is
positive that she will never lack money
as long as she possesses this charmed
purse.
As for myself, I am convinced that I
have seen and talked with one of the
greatest and best men of our times
and I am sure that the blessing of this
dear old man can only bring me good
fortune.
ELIZABETH C. BUNNER
FIRST AID IN
NAVAL BATTLES.
IT is not generally known that the
men at the puns of an American
warship are provided by the navy
surgeons with apolinnces for quick
ly ministering to the needs of their
wounded comrades during the progress
of a fight.
There is a supply of rubber bandages
and dressing near each of the big guns,
and the crew is told just what ' i do for
an injured man before it is possible for
the dt tors to attend to him. The im
portant thing Is to stay the loss of
blood, which is the cause of at least
three-fourths of the deaths h battle.
Wives and mothers will agree that it
is better to save one of our own injured
men than to slaughter a doun of the
enemy, and this principle is accepted
in the navy. As soon as a man falls
one of his comrades runs to his aid If
he is wounded in the leg the limb is
quickly bound with rubber tubing in
Buch a way as to Btop the hemorrhage,
if possible, and antiseptic dressing are
applied according to the instructions
already given by the surgeons. The
injured limb is then bound to the -"in
jured one for protection and support,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1898.
and the man is dragged to a place of
safety. Then his comrade, who has
acted as surgeon for the tilei le being,
rushes back to his place by the gun.
In the most protected places on the
ship dressing stations are established.
In this way the wounded can be more
quickly attended to than was possible
in the old days whpi they had to be
carried to the sic'.;- bay before receiv
ing the first assistance.
There is a male nurse assigned to
each of the doctors. This nurse carries
dressings and other things necessary
for immediate use. and assist:; the doc
tor in any way required. Th? nurse's
duty may be anything, from binding up
a wound to giving a hypodermic in
jection of morphine to ease some poor
fellow's sufferings.
In a modern naval battle most
wounds are caused by fragments of
bursting shells. Such wounds are said
by so competent an authority as Sur
geon General Stevenson to be gener
ally less dangerous to life than those
produced by the ordinary small bore
bullets on the field of battle. They are
often superficial rather than deen.
though the flesh is generally much
bruised and torn.
"THEN THE POPE RAISED HIS HANDS AND BLESSED US ALL,"
"After a short prayer his Holiness made the rounds, The master of ceremonies
took the invitation from the hand of each person, looked at his list
and read the name and address to his Holiness, who addressed lhrim a
polite phrase, and then raising his folded hands above the head
blessed the individual and passed on to the next."
In the case of wounds from frag
ments of shell there is much danger
from the lodgment of foreign sub
stances; bits of the projec :ie itself,
shreds of clothing, etc., often being
deeply imbedded in the flesh. These
must be carefully removed or they will
infect the wound and cause serious
trouble. The clothing immediately over
the wound is always carefully exam
ined to see if any portion of it is miss
ing, which has probably been carried
into the flesh.
The men at the guns are carefully in
structed to avoid touching wounds with
their hands, smeared as they must be
with powder and grease.
The golden rose which the Pope gives
every year to a royal lady distinguished
for loyalty both to the Pope and to the
Church of Rome is made of pure gold,
and is valued at Â£2000. There is a golden
rose in the center, in which the Pope
pours balsam, this being surrounded
with smaller rosebuds and leaves, all of
the purest gold, and chiseled with ex
quisite workmanship.
Japanese officials are less corrupt
than any other In the world. There
may be exceptions, but these are as
tonishingly few. In strict attention to
duty the Japanese officials of all rank
rival the Germans, but while the latter
are somewhat stiff and overbearing In
manner, the Japanese are very polite.
Two cannle Scots walking to Auch
termuchty saw an uncouth figure
standing in a distant field. After gaz
ing intently one said:
"It's never moving, so it's tatta (po

"It's no tatta bogie," replied the
other. "It's a man working by the
day."
There are in the entire world 51,000
breweries. Germany easily heads the
list with 26.240; next comes England
with 12,874, then the United States with
2300. Austria has 1942 breweries, Bel
glum 1270, and France 1044.
All poisonous serpents have movable
fangs, which are found in the upper
jaw, and when not In use close up like

provided with a duct leading to the
poison sac, and the virus Is ejected
through this duct by pressure. At the
base of every poison fang there are
numerous germs of others, and the
fang broken or lost is replaced In a few
weeks by the growth of another.
Outdoor Sports
Make a Nation
FEW people realize how great is
the part played by sport in the
life of a nation. Most of us think
of the hour or two spent at some
form of exercise as a pastime
which has little or no bearing
upon the political or economic life about
us. It is when the figures of expenses
paid for sport are put before us that
we realize that such enormous sums of
money represent an element, either for
good or for evil.
But let us look at the matter from
another standpoint. An accepted au
thority upon all matters of sport in
Great Britain has compiled within the
last few years some figures as to the
investments and expenditures upon
sport by the, in round numbers, 40,000,
000 inhabitants of th(,-se islands. His
estimates, which have been criticized
mainly, be it said, because they are too
low, are:
Spent
Invested. Annually.
Fox hunting $78,035,000 $43,700,000
Shooting 20,335,000 40,640,000
Fishing 2,750,000 2,!M5,u00
Racing 41,610,000 52,9t>5,000
Yachting 25.000.000 15,160,000
$170,730,000 $155,500,000
But ev*Â»n these enormous sums are
by ho means the whole of the budget.
The same writer estimates that cours-
ing costs, in investment, $2,600,000, and
in yearly expenditures $1,587,000; coach
ing, $1,451,250 in investment and $1,188,
1*75 in yearly expenditure; polo costs its
votaries $425,000 in invested capital and
$552,500 in annual expenditure; golf
(there are some 700 golf links in Great
Britain now), $2,625,000 invested in lay
ing out of links, building of clubhouses,
purchase of clubs, bags, etc., and $3,627,
750 annual expenditures for labor, keep
ing up clubhouses, caddies, professional
salaries, golf balls and the other neces
sary expenses, including traveling; row
ing, invested, $1,420,000, annual expendi
ture $2,871,500; football and cricket, in
vested, $53,81^,000, annual expenditure,
$58,560,000. .as these figures have not
been seriously questioned among the
sportsmen of Great Britain we may in
fer that some $233,066,250 are invested
permanently and $223,887,725 spent an
nually for sport. When the aggregate
expenditures in any one direction reach
such proportions as these we may be
sure that the people who tax them
selves thus heavily have, at any rate
the great majority of them, satisfied
themselves that there is an equivalent
of some kind that justifies the expendi
ture. These two amounts combined
only fall short c/f equaling the total
value of our exports to Great Britain
and her dependencies for the year 1897
by less than $150,000,000.
Perhaps an Englishman would say
that these expenditures had had a good
deal to do with the fact that Great
Britain has now supreme lordship over
eleven million square miles of the
earth's surface, inhabited by a popula
tion equaling in the aggregate probably
one-fourth of the total population of
the earth. But whatever explanation
is offered the fact remains the same,
and this particular fact looms so large,
not only in Great Britain, but in
America, that it is worth considering.
How has it come about that we are now
willing to give so much time, money
and attention to sport? What returns
do we get for our money? What does
sport teach us of such great value that
our cousins across the water are will
ing to pay this new pedagogue so Brod
dingnaglan a salary?
We may answer these questions, and
find our explanation of the present ap
parently exaggerated position of sport â
if such explanation exists at all â by
grouping the benefits to be derived
from sport under their two main heads,
namely, the benefit to be derived from
training and the benefit to be derived
from diversion. Not only are muscles
and sinews strengthened and hardened,
but the temper and the will are trained
as well. The man who learns to spar,
for example, not only schools his eye,
v his hands and his feet to respond
quickly when called upon, but he learns
also, and what is far more important,
to keep his temper under control and
to take a -^minding cheerfully; and if
a man can translate these lessons to
eerve In the larger affairs of life, where
temper is often tempted, and where
poundings are meted out to all of us
with pretty even impartiality, he has
learned a valuable lesson.
But every sport has also the valuable
effect of diverting both mind and body.
A sharp gallop, a round of golf, a
â¢week's yachting, < hanges the current
of one' 3 thoughts, and rests the mind
as well as the body. Every sport, in
short, offers its votaries training and
diversion; all the benefits to be had
' from sport group themselves under
these two heads. The lad at his row
ing, his football, his baseball or his
tennis, needs the training more than
the diversion, while his father riding,
shooting, golfing or yachting, needs the
diversion more than the training. But
both the boy and the man get both a
necessary training and a necessary di
version from their pastimes, whatever
they are.
If, however, training and diversion
are all sport has to offer, can such ben
efits as these account for the huge ex
penditures or for the honorable posi
tion of the beÃt class of advocates of
sport? The answer must be "Yes."
But the answer is willingly "Yes," if
we stop to consider the value of train
ing and diversion, if we remember also
that nothing â¢ offers them in such
agreeable form as this, that or the
other game.
The lirst settlers in this country
needed no sports for their training or
for their diversion. Building their own
houses, their own roads and bridges,
and defending the same from their sav
age neighbors, were enough. Civiliza
tion in those rough years was a gym
nasium in itself, a gymnasium, too, that
every citizen was obliged to attend. But
increased prosperity, and, above all,
steam and electricity, not only in
America, but in Europe, have done
away with the necessity for daily dar
ing and for constant physical exercise.
Mankind, however, knows intuitively
that luxury is his most insidious foe. If
we are no longer obliged to ride, or to
walk, in order to see our friends or to
attend to our business, then we turn
to and make a business of riding or
â¢walking, of shooting and fishing, of
climbing mountains and hunting wild
game, to keep alive in us the hardier
virtues, which in the beginning made
our forefathers capable of winning a
place for us in the world. As the neces
sity for physical exertion lessens among
us, the artificial incentives to physical
exercise increase, and make ever more
and more disciples. As wars become
less frequent gymnasiums and field
sports increase in number and popu
larity.
It is oft< - said, as an objection to
this argument, that a man can learn
self-control and show high courage
Just as well by r"oing his duty, what
ever and wherever it happens to be. It
is not necessary that we should have
wars, or rough games like football or
polo, to steady the nerves of ou*- young
men, to give them courage and to teach
them to take car of themselves. The
controversies and temptations and hard
tasks of daily life are enough. This is
quite true. Taking care of a sick and
peevi3h child is a tremendous test of
patience and gentleness. Bearing the
frowns of fortune with cheerfulness and
In silence shows courage. Keeping
oneself well in hand through the vari
ous worries of daily life, in business,
profession, or in the home, is a con
stant schooling of the nerves.
Riding a horse over a five-barred
gate or across a water-jump is a test
of horsemanship, but before these can
be successfully negotiated it is neces
sary to have som: training at simpler
feats of riding. Thus it is with those
other matters. The lad who has learnt
self-control, fair play and good temper
at his games finds it easier to exercise
these same high qualities in the more
complicated emergencies of daily life.
The boy who has ridden about the pad
dock on his pony with a blanket for a
saddle will take the water-jump just so
much more easily.
There is a German proverb which
runs. "When the devil cannot go him
self he sends an old woman!" There is
just enough of truth in this old-woman
argument against our rougher games
to lead one to believe that the devil
sent her.
The nation which governs almost
one-fourth of the earth's population,
and upon the whole governs well,
spends over two hundred millions an
nually upon sport, and has invested in
the same way an even greater sum.
Perhaps there is no higher test of a
man's all-round abilities than his power
to govern wisely; at any rate, it is a
truth to be borne in mind, in this con
nection, that the governing races to
day are races of sportsmen.
The peoples who play games are in
heriting the earth, perhaps because it
makes them meek. As a matter of fact,
we think it does just that, among other
things.
The French do not play games, and
Benjamin Kidd has shown how the
population of France is steadily de
creasing, the deaths having outnum
bered the births there for several years
past.
The Spaniards do not play games,
and travelers in and students of Spain,
and the Spanish, agree that their two
most salient characteristics are over
weening personal pride and cruelty.
The Chinese despise unnecessary
physical exercise, and can scarcely ba
driven to fight, even for their country,
and their lack of decision and their
pulpy condition of dependence are no^sy
all too manifest. â From Outing.

It appears that war correspondents
were used long before our time, as far
back as the time of Edward 11. Scribes,
specially commissioned, were sent up
with the English army which invaded
Scotland at that time. One of them
completed his task, but the other was
captured at the battle of Bannockburn.
Incredible as it may sound, not one of
the London newspapers was specially
represented at the battle of Waterloo,
and the descriptions we have of the fight
are from the pens of officers present.
Thirty years ago ten or twelve knots
an hour was reckoned to be the highest
speed attainable by our warships. This
was in sailing ships, and the speed of our
first fleet of ironclads did not exceed this.
The speed of the ships of the present day
shows how vastly superior they are to
the battleship of '66. The 20 or 21 knots
which our largest battleships steam at
to-day represents something like 23 miles
an hour, and several of the torpedo boat
destroyers now undergoing their trials
can steam nearly 35 miles an hour.
Some interesting notes have just been

redhot for days, had their contents

PRESENTLY TrjE PORTIERE WAS PUSHED ASIDE AND HE ENTERED.
"A man's past will catch him sooner or later."
THEY had been five days over the sea. the young
man and the girl. He had forgotten whether this
were the Atlantic or the sea that sweeps the
snore of Elysium. Now, on the fifth day, they
were on dock, and talking somewhat in this way:
"Toil must walk with me," she called from her
reclining chair.
'It's .1 rit-iightful punishment."
"Thanks: 1 believe that's a compliment."
"Truth's a compliment, eh?" ho said, smiling.
"The best compliments. I suppose, are those that pre
tend to be truths, but are lies."
"I am afraid this is getting rather too fast for me," he
saiil. "Wait until I think about it."
â¢To carry out what you have begun, you should say to
me 'I can't think about it. for I have to think about
you."
â¢Is i* r..(-dful to say that?" he said, looking down at
the girl. 'How beautiful you are!"

DIPLOMATIC CONTEST
For the
GOVERNORSHIP OF HAWAII
Special to The Sunday Call.
HONOLULU. Sept. 3.â The rela
tions are strained between Pres
ident Dole and ex-Minister Har
old Sewall. For both have as
piration* Bfl to the governorship
of Hawaii, and each has a co
terie sufficiently larpe to keep the other
on a nerve-shattering tension.
"When Mr. Dole was President and
Mr. Sewall was Minister from the
United States, when annexation seemed
In the dim future and each man's po
sition was all his own. everything was
serene and the Doles and Sewalls were
cairn in their stability, but now that
neither knows where he is at, so to
speak, each is dc-termined to find out,
and their regard for one another is
tinped with a growing suspicion.
Mr. Sewall has been politic. He has
not allowed himself to drift along in
a tropical, easy, "sufficient until the
day' dream of security.
His public receptions, his dinners and
his open-handed hospitality of every
description have not all been given to
the people f'>r love of a good time alone.
Th. cool forethought of this man from
Maine has given to Honolulu many an
entertainment born of a steady look
ahead.
Mr. Sewall is a young man. an am
bitious man and a very nervous man.
His manner, cordial, pleasant and cul
tured, is made characteristic by his
quick, nervous gestures and impetuous
way of speaking. In the first stages of
a conversation Mr. Sewall leans back
in his chair, but gradually he is on the
edge, and as the topic waxes to a cli
max he throws back his coat until at
times one wonders if the garment is in
danger of being utterly discarded.
To the mind of many an irreverent
listener has come the well-known,
hackneyed words, "Pull down your
vest:"
His impetuosity is unique in a land
that sees so much repose of gesture
and attitude.
Mr. Bewail is a small man, slender,
quick and full of nervous activity; in
every way the opposite of Mr. Dole,
whose tall, stately form, benign face.
Imposing, quiet manner and gentle
spee>h makes him a model of strength,
a type of dignity and a figure apart to
attract the stranger's eye and impress
him with a conviction of nobility.
Mrs. BewaJL who was Miss Millie
Ashe of San Francisco, is a tall, hand
some woman of fine physique, in whom
seems concentrated all the tranquillity
and composure lacking in her husband,
while Mis. Dole, though extremely gra
cious, is decisive., at times abrupt, and
as much the opposite of her placid hus
band as is Mrs. Sewall of her excitable
one.
If a difference in temperament is
conducive to matrimonial bliss, these
two couples bo prominent in Hawaii
should have enough happiness in their
lives to be able to regard with indif
ference any political issue.
When the tfaer was to be raised there
was creat excitement in Honolulu over
the question of governorship, as it was
thought that the future Governor
â would be named at the ceremonials.
It was, however, learned that President
McKinley had determined to leave Mr.
Dole as acting President; so the excite
ment over the question still continues.
Those in favor of Mr. Dole are not
necessarily against Mr. Sewall person
ally, but the large majority think that
as Mr. Dole has brought the country
through trials and perils to a haven of
rest and security, he now deserves the
position of first man in the land as a
reward for his courageous attitude In
days of peril, and as a recognition of
York, and work, and to see her no more.
Two elderly persons wrapped to their ears were watch
ing the two.
"What a remarkable girl Nell Wolverton is." one was
saying.
"She's certainly carrying on a remarkable flirtation
with thit young man. Who is he?" said the other with
the severity of position gained by effort.
"Some scrt of engineer in the employ of the Winfield
Company. Mary Winfirld introduced him to Nell."
"That girl would flirt with anybody. She seems to find
all men infinitely amusing. Isn't she handsome? Now you
would suppose she was somebody or other. But the Wol
vertons â oh, you know!" quoth the other lady.
"Her mother was one of the most pushing women I
ever Knew,' assented her companion.
"Of the dead, nihil nisi bonum," said the Imposing one.
"She was an extraordinarily ambitious woman. With
pluck and ten mllions and a daughter like that an ambi
tious. clev?r woman can do anything in New York. The
Wolverton money is said to be indefinite millions instead.
And now they belong in Far Westchester. Oh, dear; how
many men have been after that girl! There was the Mar
quis di Rodlrl. and the little Duke of Sussex, and Freddy
Van Br-Ue. andâ she flirts and laughs at 'em all. Just as
she does vith that young man."
Mary Winfield was watching the two with much the
same thoughts. This poor young man didn't understand
sophistl-'rued young women; it was abominable of Nell
Wolverton: she was sorry she had introduced them; she
might have known that Nell would play with any man as
she would with a cat or a dog. Oh. dear; this Melville was
so out of it: so busy and capable, and such an efficient ser
vant of the Winfleld Company. But Nell was Nell, and
Mary oueht to have known better.
his earnest and conscientious efforts for
the country's good.
Mr. Sewall's Influence in Washington
makes him a powerful rival, and he has
undoubtedly won for himself the fa
vor of a small element of the Annexa
tion Club which is composed of men of
the jingo variety. Mr. Dole has done
nothing to curry favor. Mr. Sewall has.
He has also lain himself open to criti
cism in consenting to have his name
sent to Washington while yet acting in
the capacity of Minister from the
United States.
These two men have their friends and
their enemies. But neither friend nor
foe can hurry or influence Congress,
and Mr. Dole's presidency may be pro
longed and indefinite.
In the meantime Honolulu questions,
and wonders, and speculates â and
waits. MA DOE VAN HORN.
HOW LONG CAN YOU
KEEP AWAKE?
How long can a man work without
sleep, and how long can he endure days
in which twenty hours are given to
wakefulness, if not to work? I have
always been anxious to know the true
answer to these questions, and have
asked many experienced people for an
opinion.
One learned doctor solemnly stated
that no healthy man could overwork;
after a certain time he would fall
asleep at his task. The general opinion
is not In agreement with this theory,
doctors being generally agreed that
man's inclination is prone to forget all
natural limitations.
During the past week two Journalists
of the hard-working species have given
me their views. One claims to have
worked for seventy-two hours, with
three intervals of two hours for repose;
the other claims to be content with four
or five hours' sleep out of the twenty
four.
The only statistics as to limits of en
durance comes from China, where a
form of torture is to keep the victims
from sleeping. They die on or before
the fifth day.â London Sketch.
MfIRD ON CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE
HERE !s the hardest thing yet said
in the East about California's
climate:
"In the year 1873 a man from
Massachusetts came to California
with a chronic liver complaint. He
searched all over the coast for a mineral
spring to cure the disease, and finally he
found down in the San Joaquin Valley a
â¢sprinp the waters of which almost In
stantly cored him. He thereupon started
a sanitarium, and people all over tha
world came and were cured quickly.
"Last year this man died, and so power
ful had been the action of the waters that
they had to take his liver out and kill it
with a club."
An old lady from Oxford, Mich, who,
with her husband, had spent the winter
in California, was asked b- one of her
neighbors if she had heard an earth
quake while in California.
"Yes, I heard one," she answered,
"and rather enjoyed it, for it was the
first thing that happened since John
and I have been married that he did
not think I was to blame for." â San
Francisco Argonaut.
The trade of the British empire is
estimated to amount to about $5,200,
000,000 per annum, which is nearly equal
to the combined trade of France, Ger

carry on this gigantic traffic exceeds
126,000,000 tons.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1898.
Poisonours Plants OF California
AN important publication has just
been Issued by V. K. Chesnut,
a Californian associated with
the Department of Agriculture,
describing the poisonous plants
of the United States. The bulletin con
tains much information as to the
poisonous plants of California that will
be of value to farmers, stock growers,
tourists and all who are likely to come
In contact with these objectionable
vegetable growths. i
Mr. Chesnut cites numerous incidents
of fatalities resulting from plant
poison. One species of water hemlock
(cicuta) is estimated as killing scores
of cattle every year. To rid itself of
this pest the State of Colorado paid
out nearly $200,000 in bounties between
1881 and 1885. The number of cases of
individual distress due to poison oak
and poison ivy could not easily be
counted. Toadstool poisoning is not un
common; especial interest was aroused
In it by the death at Washington In
November of last year of Count de
Vecchi, who thought that he was par
taking of mushrooms at his dinner.
There are twenty-five to thirty
species of the mushroom and very few
of them edible. The most common of
the poisonous species are popularly
known as the fly amanita and the
death cup. The first named is free of
larval pests and highly attractive in
appearance, taste and smell. It is dis
tinguishable from the edible mushroom
by its having white instead of purple
gills and spores, and by its warty cap
and bulbous stem.
The death cup may be distinguished
from the edible mushroom by its cup.
Its white gills and white spores, and
by its growth in woods instead of in
meadows. It acts on the blood corp
uscles, which it dissolves, and thus de
vitalizes. The effects usually are not
apparent until nine to fourteen hours
after eating.
Treatment is exceedingly difficult and
precarious because there Is no known
antidote to phallin.
Poison oak has many names, accord
ing to the locality in which it is found.
Its bright red leaves add to its at
tractive appearance and increase the
probability of persons who are not ac
quainted with the plant endangering
themselves by handling it. In 1895 Dr.
Franz Pfaff of Harvard University
showed that the poison is in reality a
non-volatile oil. It is found in all parts
of the plant,' even in the wood after
long drying. Like all oils, it is insolu
ble in water, and cannot therefore be
washed off the skin with water alone.
Numerous experiments prosecuted by
Mr. Chesnut show that the poison oak
oil produces the same effect as the plant
itself.
Remedies for poison oak are without
end. embracing everything from hot
soapsuds to patent medicine. Mr
Chesnut deems the sugar of lead treat
ment adequate to all cases. An alco
holic solution of from 50 to 75 per cent
is recommended: powdered sugar of
lead to be added until no more will dis
solve. The milky fluid should then be
well rubbed Into the affected skin, and
the operation repeated several times
during the course of a few days. This
at once relieves the Itching and checks
THE MARKED CARDS
If Neil were Nell, phe was proving it with a vengeance.
She was nuking Melville tell her of himself, and she was
giving him nothing of herself in return. They were seated
now, looking out of the frothing white and green in the
ship's wake. She' was glancing at him again and again
with mild, interested eyes. He was forgetting himself, and
was telling how his father had left him only money
enough for school and college, which he had increased by
some tutoring; of how he had worked and won a position
in a machine shop of the Winiield Company; of how he
had progressed farther, and now was near the head of his
department, and he had been sent to London on an im
portant mission, andâ
A young man came lightly across the deck, and bowed,
and exchanged some remarks with Miss Wolverton. and
nodded at Melville with a "who-the-devil-are-you?" air,
and passed on after a moment. Melville's confidences
suddenly chilled. This youngster represented what he had
never known. The girl by his side understood.
"Don't mind Bertie; he's just Bertie."
"Oh, you know," Melville began, "I'm so out of that
set."
"It's the Far Weschester set, you mean," she said gra
ciously, as if she would imply politely that there were
many other?, which he doubtless freo.uented. "The men
are very stupid in it. It is all very stupid. It's just sport
and gossip. For my \ .rt give me men that do things."
"I think," said t .â¢ .oung-man-maJdng-his-way. "that
I prefer ether met. . do things, and leave 'em to me al
ready done. Now. .Ny fatherâ"
He paused, wondering whether he had better tell her,
and then it seemed to him. now that he rememberd it. that
this put bim on a sort of equality with Miss Wolverton. us
though the Inequality that stood between them was sud
denly swept away by the thought of this story. But had
he a right tc tell her? No. she wouldn't, couldn't know;
that was so long ago. and forgotten.
"And your father? Go on. I am interested."
"He might have had the things, the money to have put
me in your friend Bertie's position, if luck had been his
way, and if he hadn't been cheatedâ"
"I never can think of you as a man like Bertie," Miss
Wolverton said, decisively, with that calm confidence in
her eyes; thp eyes may have been rather more expressive
because this was the last day of all, and he would slip out
of her life so soon. She was' fair to look upon, clever, ac
complished, charming: this fence of the sexes was her de
light: she ciuld no more avoid it than she could breathing.
Our unsophisticated young man failed to understand her.
Later, common sense was to reach out from the grim,
matter-of-fact depths of his nature, and grasp his senti
mentality until it hurt him.
"Oh, it'p a little story of what might have been years
ago in Red Nugget Gulch, California. My father was out
there after gold, like the rest, and he fell in with a man
with yhom he made a partnership in n general store.
Sometimes, in exchange for goods, they took claims. At
lirst th?y made a lot of money, and then they lost nearly
every penny in trying to develop a claim that failed. Well,
each blamed the other, and they decided to separate. They
could decide on no other way than to cut the cards. So
they sat dowr. one day and cut. and some things fell to my
father, and some to his partner. And the- papers were
drawn up. and the division made. A week after that a
claim which had gone to my father's partner began to
develop. It proven a find; my father's partner made the
beginning oi a great fortune that way."
"WelT?" said the girl.
"Now, the shanty that served for the store had fallen
to my father, not the stock, which went to pky the firm's
debts. Three weeks after this my father sat talking with
a mining expert, who spoke of the big find on my father's
former j.-.irtner's lucky claim; and he stated boastfully, to
show his value as an expert probably, that he had told
my father's partner â we will call him Smithâ that the
claim was extremely valuable. This set my father to
thinking; Smith had believed the claim to be valuable.
But my father could but acknowledge that the man had
given him a chance, even if he had dishonestly hidden his
notion ( f the claim. That day my father happened in the
abando.T'd store. On the table were the two packs of
dirty cards, just as they had been left on the day of the
division. They had cut in the bare inner room, which
hadn't beon disturbed since. My father picked up these
instruments of his bad luck, and he saw that the pack
Smith had used had been marked."
"How awful!" the listener said. "And you might have
had money, if It hadn't beenâ"
"If it hadn't been for Smith's dishonesty, yes, Miss
Wolver* >ri. But to return to the story. My father went
to Smith, vhom he accused, but Smith looked him in th<?
face and laughed. 'You are crazy, man. And you haven't
any "ro >f Who'd believe you? 1 "
"W is that the end of it?" the' girl asked, gently.
"No, not the end of it. My father could prove nothing,
indeed. His affairs went from bad to worse. He left Cali
fornia penniless. Later, in. the East, he accumulated the
little money he was able to leave me. But it was always
a hard struggle for him and my mother, who died shortly
after I was born."
"And Smith? that's not the name."
Melville hesitated.
"No, that's not the name. It's a well-known name, but
the further spread of the eruption.
The abundant pink family furnishes
the poison corn cockle, sometimes
known as the rose campion, a whitish,
woolly annual, one to three feet high,
with an erect stem, showy, violet-red
flowers and numerous rough, black, ir
regularly rounded seeds. The poison
ous constituent is saponin, which is
found in nearly all parts of the plant,
but mainly in the kernel of the seed.
Machinery is used by millers to sepa
rate the cockle, but it is not always
successful.
The symptoms of the poison are in
tense irritation of the whole digestive
tract, vomiting, headache, nausea, ver
tigo, diarrhea, hot skin, sharp pains in
the spine, difficult locomotion and de
pressed breathing. The action is an
tagonized by the use of digitalis, a dan
gerous poison, which should be admin
istered only by a physician.
The aconite plant occurs in California
only as far south as Lake County. It
is an erect, smooth, single-stemmed
plant, two to six feet high, with a leafy
base and an elongated terminal cluster
of showy blue flowers. All parts of the
plant are poisonous, but the seeds and
roots are most dangerous.
No specific antidote is recognized,
but physicians have used atropine or
digitalis and nitrate of arnyl.
Another very common poison, espe
cially on the coast of this State, ip the
larkspur. It exists in several varieties.
Along the coast northward from this
city is a variety which is somewhat
hairy, tuberous-rooted, about a foot
high, with a basal cluster of finely di
vided, long stemmed leaves, with a
single column of showy blue flowers,
which appear between April and July.
Its effects are fatal to sheep, often re
sulting in the death of 50 per cent of
the animals partaking of it.
The poisonous action of larkspur re
sembles that of aconite or monkshood,
the plants themselves resembling
aconite. Aconite antidotes therefore
are recommended, namely atropine.
Loco weed has long been an affliction,
especially to the livestock of the south
ern part of the State. It also subsists
in several varieties, under the popular
names of "woolly loco weed." "stemless
loco weed," and "rattlebox." Its pea
pod formation is familiar to all Califor
nians. The effect is not acute, but in
its slow progress simulates diseases
caused by bacteria, worms, or other
parasites or such as are caused In man
by the continued use of alcohol, to
bacco or morphine.
No effectual antidotes have as yet
been published, so the only positive
remedy for the evil is to remove the
animals from the vicinity of the plants
as earl'- as possible.
The so-called spurga family (euphor
bia) is less well known popularly, but
is widely distributed on this coast. Its
characteristic is a milky juice and in
complete and inconspicuous flowers.
Contact of the milky juice inflames and
poisons the skin. An overdose of the
herb for medicine results in serious if
not fatal injury.
A so-mewhat common plant In West
ern States, although it Is not so well
known in this State, is the hemlock,
the famous plant of Socrates* undoing.
The American water hemlock is one
of the most poisonous plants native to
the United States. The underground
parts are the meat poisonous. Children*
mistake them for horseradish, pars
nips, artichokes, sweet cicely and other
we will let it remain Smith. Everything Smith touched
became mo: ey; he was accused of dishonesty many times
in the course of his career; but nothing ever was proven;
he sucfceeUed, and is to-day one of the powerful men of the
country."
They were silent, the girl grave.
"And fiat's the reason you think you are not in tne
class of Bertie Townley. Well, I don't want you to be in
"If you would care that much?" said he, half lightly,
half earnestly. . , . .
"Oh, 1 like you." she said, cheerily, as she might have
said she liked a fox terrier.
"And the man's dishonesty was really your blessing;
ft made you do things. Oh, I know a lot of men.and the
men of the Far Westchester set are so tiresome.
"Oh, lhanks!" said he, lamely. .
"But you mustn't be tiresome. Do you see that line
there? That's Sandy Hook; I know it. I have seen it that
way a dozen times. Andâ l must be going below. Oh, I
have been so much interested."
And she went away brightly smiling, and he felt sud
denly the least like a fool. This feeling was increased
when he found in the bustle of landing that she had f only
a cool hand and a distant "So glad to have met you, and
no acknowledgment of the fact that he had asked to call,
which she plainly had evaded. He felt revengeful and a
bit like an anarchist. And the next morning when he was
reporting tn Mr Winfield his success in London, and being
complimented by the company's head, his success seemed
cheap: h-^ had a picture before him of a bright, high-bred
looking exquisitely gowned young woman, surrounded by
flippanilv gay pers"ons whose world was not his. and never
could be; for when one is making his way ploddingly, with
no particular capital, he can't reasonably expect that way
to be made before he may be gray and all the desire for
pleasure, li;>'s good things, quite gone.
It may be supposed that Miss Wolvertnn put the young
man of the Atlantic out of her mind. Perhaps she had
some thoughts of him or else she would never have re
peated th" story he had told her at a dinner w.here her
father was, most unusually, her escort. At a dinner one
owes it as a duty to do his part. Nell did not care to be
lacking, and wanted her bon mot to be as natty as an
other's and her story as spirited. For she waged a little
strife to mak" the world she knew hold her clever. Now
she couldn't try as she would, think of another story than
the one Melville had told her.
â¢"Mary Winfield introduced me to a very entertaining
man on the Lucaniaâ a man who does things, you knowâ"
"What does he do, horses or yachts?" said Bertie
Townley. 'Oh, I say, Nell, you don't mean that serious
faced chan you were mooning about with so much?"
"The very man," Miss Wolverton said, without turn
ing color.
And she told Melville's story.
"How extraordinary!" gasped Mrs. Pemberton. "You
meet such strange people at sea."
"Busupess methods are oftentimes dishonest, said
Judge Torpid, pompously. "Yetâ"
"Your story isn't funny enough, criticized Bertie
Townlay.
Samuel Wolvertonâ l should say "Sam, the great Sam
âhold his nose in his port; he's a thin, sharp-featured, si
lent mm. r.r.d looking at him, one always wonders how ho
succeeded in possessing such a daughter.
Drivi?ig home, he said to Nell:
"If I were you I don't think I'd try to tell stories at
dinner."
"Why. papa?"
"It's undignified."
"Do you think so?" she said, petulantly. She usually
had nirri well in hand.
"What did you say that man's name is?" he asked,
after p. moment.
"Burke Melville."
Su.lier.ly she turned.
"Pana, you were in California?"
"Yo-s, what of it?"
"Did you ever hear a story like that?"
"I have heard a lot of stories; California is full of 'em.
Read Bret Harte. As for your acquaintance, he was prob
ably yarmng."
"No, no, he wasn't."
"What rrakea you think that?"
"He Isn't that kind of a man."
"Nsll. I think you ran take care of yourself, but I
don't r>o!i?ve you can judge men."
"Oh. trust me for that." she said, airily; and at the
moment she was trying to judge no less a person that her
father. She had thought that she understood him. Had
she? He was fond of her; he denied her nothing, and she
loved him. But â there were depths she could not fathom;
and she knew no nio>e of his real life, even less, than an
outsider.
But now a sudden fear possessed her. She rushed up
stairs to a little room which she used for her writing
table md her books, and eagerly she looked for a paper
In a certain English magazine. "American Millionaires.
No. X. Samuel Wnlvertnn." Had she been mistaken?
And tliÂ°n she read: "The beginning- of this extraordinary

he stopped at his doctor's. "I am troubled v.-ith that in

As he entered the house he heard Nell s voice. |He
paused in the hall and listened.
"I am triad to see you, Mr. Melville, she was saying.
â¢'I had your note, and came here promptly, I think."
"Yes, promptly." . -, _, ,%. Â«. Â .
"I have passed you several times, but I don t believe â¢

He was thinking how charming she appeared here In -
her own house. He was blaming himself for all that he
had thought of her; when her world, of which he had that
brief glimpse, had been shut out. -' .
"I sent for you," Nell went on. "to ask you why you
told me thai story whenâ when you knew that your fa
ther's partner then wasâ myâ father?"
The listener started, and moved toward the door,. ana
drew back.
At last he heard:
"Miss Welvertonâ yes, it wag so, It is so, and I was a
coward to tell you."
"I am glad you told me." Nell said humbly, for this
was no longer the proud Miss Wolverton; she wondered
at herself, tears were in her eyes, and self-control was
far away.
"I lon't know what made me tell you. and yet I do
know. I have lied: Ido know now. You seemed so far out
of my reach and I wanted you to be in my reach. Do you
understand?" â 
"I don't know that I understand," the girl said. "I
can't seem to understand."
"Andâ oh, you are crying. I have hurt you. I wouldn't
hurt you for the world." :' : .
"Don't." she said, "please don't."
Tsut he was saying:
"I know the reason now. It was â you â didn't
you sea?" â¢ ; .
After a moment the listener heard Nell's voice:
"It's best so. If you do it rights itself. Andâ l see It
â clearly. I know now why I didn't want you to be of
Bertie Townley's class. You are a man who does things
â and wiilâ a man for a woman to be proud of, and yes
it's all clear to meâ l thought I was just flirting with you
But since that night I know it was more."
Presently the portiere was pushed aside.

at the two. and then went on: "Mr. Melville what's it the

YOL, gentlemen, who have served
In Southwestern Texas," began a
jolly West Point captain, while
sitting before the campflre with
the volunteers recently, "have
seen the Seminole negro-Indian scouts
In the early eighties, when I was a
lieutenant, my regiment was stationed
at old Fort Clark, and was assigned to
command these same scouts.
"Southwestern Texas at that time
was a pretty wild stretch of country
Civilization stopped at San Antone, and
the duty of these negro Indians was to
keep that border free from smugglers,
marauding parties and hostile Indians.
Once every four months they came to
Clark for their money, and then, you
will pardon the expression, gentlemen,
there was hell to pay.
"The men ha I had arod many sharp
brushes with the redskins and when
they were warmed up with liquor they
liked to tell of these affairs. The com
mander at Fort Clark was a little skep
tical about these Indian stories and one
day he said to me in a joking way: 'I
don't believe there is an Indian in West
Texas, and I'll give $50 to any man in
your command who will bring in a dead
redskin.' '
"There was on Mexican in the com
mand, Julian Longonio by name, and
he was one of the best trailers -the
Southwest ever saw. Longonio heard
the colonel's remark and his beadlike
eyes snapped as he turned away. For
myself I thought no more of it until it
was forcibly recalled to my mind some
time later.
"The next day we left Fort Clark for
a scouting trip. At Newtown, uher:
the Las Moras empties into the Rio
Grande, Longonio rode up and asked
permission to cross the river. Fancy
ing that he wanted to visit some
friends, and knowing that there was no
immediate need of his services, I read
ily gave my consent. The greaser swam
his pony across the river and disap
peared in the chapparal.
"The next I saw of him was two days
later, when I rode into Fort Clark for
my mail. In the afternoon Longonio
rode .down to the officers' line and
stopped in front of the adjutant's office.
Several officers were standing around
and gazed in open-mouthed astonish
ment at sight of the Mexican with a
dead Indian behind him. He refused to
answer any of their queries and asked
for 'El Colonel.' Hearing the commo
tion, the colonel came out, and before
he could say anything Julian cut the
rope that bound the Indian to his sad
dle, threw the corvse on the porch at
the colonel's feet, and in that soft,
drawling voice so peculiar to the Mex
icans, said:
" 'Cincuenta pesos, senor el colonel.'
"Well, gentlemen, the colonel was so
thunderstruck at first that he was
speechless, but recovering Limself* pres
ently he gave Longorio such a cussing
out as= I never heard before or since.
The Mexican sat like a sphinx on his
horse, pretending not to understand
English, and when the colonel was
through. he simply pointed to the dead
Indian and again said:
* "Cincuenta pesos, senor el colonel.'
"He got his 'cincuenta pesos" finally,
but the colonel intimated that if he
ever caught him around there again
he'd have him shot. Longorio pocketed
the money and rode away with a broad
grin on his face, to rejoin the scouts.
It seems he had lassoed the Indian
first and started to bring him in alive,
but after draereing him a miie over the
cactus plain, poor Lo's spiri* fled and
another bad Indian was made a good
one via the Paradise Valley route."

and
AT ITS BEST
"QUICKER THAN IT TAKES TO TELL IT HE HAD SHOT HENDERSON THROUGH THE SHOULDER."
Special to The Sunday Call.
AN item is going the rounds of
the newspapers to the effect that
there are more active church
members in Tombstone in pro
portion to the population than
in any community in Arizona or
New Mexico, and also that the temper
ance sentiment Is stronger there than
elsewhere in the Southwest Territory.
"Yes, Tombstone is a model moral
Christian community now," said ex-
Senator Harvey Williams of Benson to
the writer the other day. "It is the
most wonderful transformation in pub
lic sentiment of any town I ever knew.
I say candidly that the very wickedest,
cussedest wild West town that I ever
knew (and I have been in all of them
except Bodie and Deadwood) was that
mining town of Tombstone seventeen
years ago this season. Whew! but that
was a tough place! Dodge City, Kans.,
â was never so generally depravei. Lead
ville had some horrible shooting
s< rapes, but none that ever compared
with those at Tombstone. Sherman,
Tex., was also mighty tough along
about 1873, but it never touched Torab-
Btone as it was seven years later. Crip
ple Creek was said to be tough, but it
was a model town by the . id^ of Tomb
stone. No, there'll never be another
mining town so recklessly bad and
thoroughly lawless as Tombstone. The
conditions, you know, were just right to
make Tombstone the abandoned, hard
ened community it was for two years. I
believe there were twenty-two men shot
down in cold blood while I was there
from June to September."
Tombstone, Arizona, is now one of
the quietest and sedatest little villages
in the land. The visitor there these
da; . who looks for landmarks that will
remind him of the thrilling: scenes of
sixteen or seventeen years ago finds
but a few gaunt, weather-beaten old
buildings, where bats and owls abide,
and a little graveyard among the sun
baked hills where some s' 'v bodies of
men and women who died tragic
deaths find their first genuine rest.
Tombstone is in the southern part of
Arizona, southeast from the old Mexi
can pueblo of Tucson, and a few miles
from the boundary between Sonora,
Mexico, and the United States. There
are now about 1200 people in Tomb
stone, and but little mining is done
there. In 1880 Tombstone and her mines
were in every one's mouth in the West, i
The newspapers everywhere â East and '
"Westâ published columns about the â¢
marvelous gold and silver finds in the !
Tombstone district, and newspaper sto- j
ries of the hard life in the town went I
everywhere. Seven men there were j
each having an income of over $1300 a |
day from the mine?, and they had been
as poor as Job's proverbial turkey a â 
yoar before. There were 10,000 men and i
about 300 women in the town and its j
suburbs.
The reports of the extreme wealth of }
the ledges at Tombstone set the whole i
West crazy. The news went abroad
that the Gird and Schaeffelln crowd
â¢were taking out 500 pounds of silver {
from the rocks besides a dozen pounds j
of gold every day. Could there be any- j
thing that would inflame more the '
minds of eager, restless men? Dodge
City and Newton, Kans., the hard
towns in Texas and the depraved
camps in Colorado were dwindling
away then by the advancement of the
railroads, so when Tombstone became
the new El Dorado the most spontane
ous stampede of all the murderers, out
laws, ex-convicts, hardened frontiers
men and tough gamblers of the plains
set in, with Tombstone as the objective
point.
In two months the town gained 3000
male Inhabitants. The mining district
being near the boundary line between
the United States and Mexico, fugi
tives from justice both from , Mexico
and the United States went to Tomb
stone, while several hundred of the
meanest" and lowest half-breed Mexi
cans and Indians flocked to the new
town to prey upon the tenderfeet there.
Cowboys quit cowpunching and went
to Tombstone to live on their wits and
hard names. Saloon-keepers went there
from all over California and every
State and Territory along the Rocky
Moutains. There was no prison or pe
nal institution worthy the name in the
whole Territory of Arizona in those
days, and whatever there was of police
system was at once demoralized upon
the discovery of enormous wealth in
the Santa Rita Mountains. What man
would serve as constable or marshal
for a few hundred dollars a year, and
risk his life every hour in the day with
the most desperate characters In the
world, when there seemed a possibility
of finding a gold or silver mine there
with a fortune?
From January, 1880, to March, 1881, it
was a never-ending battle between
these lawbreakers on one side and the
men who knew no law on the other.
From first to last, forty-seven men were
killed with their boots on. Ex-Govern
or Filkins saw nine men shot down be
fore his eyes at that time. At least
Ity-five gambling houses had places
he main street, keeping their doors
c open day time and night time,
day and all time. One of them, the
1 Room, was capable of holding 500
300 people. Every known kind of
lbling was practiced. A sight was
l in this place one Sunday ntght
t is not often witnessed. A Meth
odist preacher went to the bogs of the
place, Jack Trowbridge, and requested
permission to hold divine services. It
waa granted, and with every gambling
Â§c running, the bar sending out its
Id hell, that preacher, the Rev. Mr.
m, stood up and told the story of
mÂ»n of Nazareth. Before he had
finished his sermon a quarrel arose at
one of the card tables, and a man was
shot. A detailed account of the killing
and murders is not intended. If a- gang
of Mexican vaqueros rode into town
the smallest provocation would set their
guns going, and going to kill.
Mike Fitzpatrkk kept a dive he called
the "Side Door." The unlucky chap
that got in there found himself "side
doored" until his money was gone.
Some of the decent people were bold
enough to protest against some of his
robberies, among others a prominent
merchant. Mike did not like any inter
ference with hiF business, and one
morning he loaded himself a little fuller
than usual with his vile whisky and
started out to do a little slaughtering.
The merchant was sought, but hap
pened to be out of his store. Mike
went up the street, terrorizing every
body, and walked into a saloon. There
he saw the city's Police Judge, George
Halliday, and without the slightest
provocation or a word of warning he
shot him through the heart. The Mar
shal, Jack Johnson, had been advised
that Mike was on a raid and had
started to capture him. Seeing Mike
coming out of the saloon Johnson took
a rest for his Winchester rifle on the
well curb and shot him down.
This was Tombstone's last killing. In
an hour afterward the citizens had
formed a league and the suspicious
characters were notified to leave. They
left. Only a few incidents are men
tioned; only a few of the shootings de
tailed. Tom Carson, a nephew of old
Kit Carson, was sent for and came to
take tho marshalship of the town. He
j stayed three weeks. The toughs had
I it in for him, and to save his life he
skipped.
All life in Tombstone centered about
the saloons and dance halls. If one
wanted to see- a mining boss, a pros
pector, an editor, a ranchman or a
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1898.
United States Marshal he would almost
always find him of an evening in some
saloon and gambling place. These in
stitutions were worthy an artist's
study. They were always crowded
from sunset till dawn with human be
ings. Bars extended nearly the entire
length of the deep halls, over which
Arizona whisky was freely dealt out at
25 cents ("two bits") a glass.
A score or more of gambling tables
were in operation in each place. At
the bar was a maudlin crowd, subject
to no moral restraint, pouring without
stint fiery liquid down its throat. Pro
fessional gamblers, cool and calculating,
presided at the gaming tables. Among
these were red-faced women wearing
derby hats, dealing faro. The players
sat around the table, silent and with
anxious faces, and a sympathizing
crowd looked on. Mexican musicians
sat on elevated seats discoursing mu
sic that drowned the chinking of gold
and silver coins. The harvest was usu
ally reaped between Saturday night
and Monday morning. A thousand
miners flocked from the hills to spend
these intervals in the city and to try
their luck at the gaming tables. Hun
dreds were left without money enough
on Monday morning to pay for a drink
before starting for the mountains. It
was in these weekly intervals that mur
der was rife among the gamblers. But
affrays in Tombstone were of not much
account at that time. If a report of a
pistol was heard and some one was
wounded or even killed, the game was
interrupted only for a few minutes.
Many a time the little Tombstone daily
newspaper dismissed a murder with
four or five lines.
Men who have been in every mining
camp in the West and have lived along
the frontier for a generation say that
the dance houses at Tombstone were
the worst of all. There were nine dance
halls in full blast seven nights in the
week at Tombstone in 1880. They were
$25,000 SPENT ON A PET DOG
TWO thousand seven hundred and
fifty dollars isi a great deal to
spend on a dog's collar, but the
lucky canine possessing this cost
ly bauble â an ornament that a
belle at the Metropolitan during the
opera season might have been proud
to wear about her â white throatâ had
$26,000 spent upon him. His kennel
was marble and his platter, on which
his bone was put, was solid gold. This
king of dogdom lived in London in
1806, and was the property, if such a
term can be applied to so wealthy and
aristocratic a dog, of a peer.
Fifteen thousand dollars is the high
est price, probably, ever paid for a dog
collar, which was ordered in London
in 1832 by Lady Mackln for her pet
pug. The collar was made in India,
and was a marvel of art. It was inlaid
in gold, silver and ivory and heavily
incrusted with diamonds that a rajah
of old might have coveted.
Lady MacK.n called her pet Stars
and Stripes, because he was the gift
of an attache of the American Lega
tion. No matter how formal a dinner
party this charming hostess gaveâ and
she secured the chef that made the
Coldstreams, the crack regiment of
England, famousâ whether at her town
house or at her castle, Stars and
Stripes was in evidence. With great
ceremony the butler admitted the pug
as coffee was served, and before the
assembled company he took his dailj
quota of bonbons.
Only upon one occasion was the order
given to absent Stars and Stripea. The
recruited from all the human pest spots
from New Orleans to San Francisco,
and the hardened managers of the
dance halls kept agents constantly
scouring the cities for female recruits.
The dance halls were all in great barn
like structures, that covered an area of
60 feet wide by 150 feet long. A fancy
bar 70 feet long ran along one si#e of
the hall. Benches of pine wood served
as seats along the walls. The men
there who would not treat the women
to drinks several times every evening
were marked as unfit for association
with the society of Tombstone. On
many a night the bar at a dance house
has taken in over $200. On Sundays it
would always be $250 to $300.
The dancing was free, but the man
who did not respond frequently to the
manager's stentorian call of "all parties
waltz to the bar," at two-bits a head,
became unpopular. The females danced
more than fifty times a nigUt. As they
could no^ possibly drink every time
they danced, those who abstained were
given tickets which were afterward
cashed at % cents apiece at the bar.
These wild orgies beggar description.
It seemed as though there never could
be more reckless depravity. When death
occurred among the unfortunate wo
men the newspapers c ntained eulogis
tic and touching obituaries.
The greater part of the shooting
affairs in Tombstone started either in a
gambling saloon or a dance hall. In
July, 1880, a rather good-looking Mexi
can girl named Ponchita came to
Tombstone from Sonora. Hank Allen,
who was running the town about this
time, by virtue of having killed Bill
Emmons, the boss of the toughs, a few
weeks before, fell in love with Pon
chita. Hank was a six-footer about 40
years old, and had been a refugee tioui
justice in the Panhandle of Texas for
ten years before he struck Tombi'cne,
and had become a wonderfully expert
Prime Minister was the guest of honor
this evening. Lady Mackin, who was a
power in politics, was opposed to the
foreign policy of the Minister. The wily
diplomat saw a way to remove his
great stumbling block and he proceed
ed to do so, much to the disgust of the
opposition. He requested his hostess
not to allow Stars and Stripes to hold
him responsible for the banishment,
and tactfully hinted that even he, with
all his honors, would not care to win
the enmity of such a personage as Stars
and Stripes. The pug was admitted,
and deserted the velvet cushions at his
mistress' side to eat bonbons from the
plate of the grand old man of the hour.
Lady Mackin and the members of her
salon, whom she influenced by her tact
and diplomacy, went over to the Min
ister, and the opposition cursed Stars
and Stripes not only loudly but deeply.
So the girls of to-day, who go into
ecstacies over doggie, may learn that
they are not creating a fad, and though
they squander from $10 to $200
on the bracelets all dogs of fashion
wear on their left forepaws, or invest
enormous sums in collars, or put their
pretty eyes out embroidering costly
blankets and cushions for his dogship
to wear and rest upon. It has all been
done before. In other times there have
been other silly ones.
The rate at which ships of war take
In coal nowadays is simply marvelous.
Recently one of Britain's first-class bat
tleships in the Mediterranean, the Magnifi
cent, averaged over 160 tone an hour, that
is at the rate of nearly three tons a min

CROMWELL IN WESTHINSTER AT LAST.
Shall Cromwell have a statue ? An old question, often discussed in our boyhood, and upon ivhioh
Carlyle wrote most eloquently, has now been answered in the affirmative by the placing
in Wcsiminster Hall of this bust of the Great Protector. The statue is by Bernini, the fa
mous Florentine sculptor (1598-1680), who also executed several busts of Charles I. It
has been presented to Parliament by Charles Wertheinier, in recognition of Cromwell's
kindness to the Jewish race.

Interest In a roulette gambling device,
and he went about town with two or
three revolvers in his belt. He always
went in the middle of the street, so
that he could better see any one who
lay in wait for him, and that he mignt
have an unimpeded view in case he was
attacked. Fortunately for the general
community he was seldom intoxicated,
for then he was very cross and ugly,
and would shoot on the least provoca
tion. His favorite amusement witn a
tanderfoot whom he did not like was to
fire bullets a yard or two from the ter
rified person's head, "just to give him
some music." so Hank said.
Hank was not slow in telling Pon
chita that he loved her and that she
must love him, that he was boss of
Tombstone at that time, and that it
would not only be an honor to her to
have his attentions at the Golden
Eagle dance hall, but safer for other
admirers to keep their distance when
he was about. But Ponchita had eyes
for a young man of good family named
Henderson, just out from Michigan.
For some time Hank never suspected
he had a secret rival in Ponchita's
affections. One night when Hank had
gone over to a neighboring camp, Hen
derson could not resist the opportunity
to drink and dance with the Mexican
girl at the dance hall. About midnight
Hank suddenly strode into the place.
He was mad in a moment and several
dancers who saw him draw his gun got
out of the way. Quicker than it takes
to tell it he had shot Henderson
through the shoulder. The dancing
stopped, and upon Ponchita's assur
ance of her affection for Hank he put
up his weapon. Henderson went out
with some friends, apparently to hunt
up a physician, while Hank Allen called
the house up to the bar to drink vrifh
him, never giving a second thought to
how his shooting might result. Once
out of the dance hall Henderson's an
ger became violent. He went and bur
rowed a sawed-off shotgun from a
gambler down the street, and while
dripping with blood from his wound he
loaded it with buckshot. Then, with
two companions, he was on his way
around a rear window to the Jance
hall, where he could draw aim on Hank
Allen.
Some one must have hastened to the
later and warned him of the impending
assassination, for just as Henderson
and his companions were creeoin>< part
the dance hall Allen hastened out. He
drew one of his pistols just as HenderÂ»
son raised to shoot him. The ?un and
pistol went off exactly at the same mo
ment.
Henderson staggered and fell, and
Allen staggered Into the arms of a by
stander.
Although Hank Allen's shest ~*as
pierced by seven buckshot, he raised
himself sufficiently to shoot eight ti.nes
at the fallen Henderson. Both men
were dead in a minute more.
In June, 1880, the Elephant saloon
and dance house was opened by Bill
Watson and Jake Jacobs, two old-time
sports, who had made money in Deni
son, Texas. They decided to run a
high-toned place, where the rich mine
owners and the moneyed men from Cal
ifornia could have a good time at gam
bling and drinking and flirting with the
blondes that danced there. It was
thought that this was to fill a long-felt
want, and in a measure would separate
the sheep from the goats among the
masculine population of Tombstone.
Around the walls of the hall were
showbill pictures. At one side wera
smaller rooms where faro, poker, stud
poker and roulette were played.
Everything went well at Watson &
Jacob's Elephant for a few days. The
place did a land office business. Four
bartenders were kept on the jump half
the time, and the fiddlers sank from
exhaustion in their chairs. Suddenly
the dance girls struck and declared
that they would not lend their presence
to the Elephant, if Mexicans were al
lowed to come there. They claimed
that the agent who had hired them in
San Francisco had said there were only
white gt-.tlemen in the new mining
camp. Jake Jacobs issued an order to
doorkeepers to permit none but good
white men to enter, no matter how
much gold they might display.
There was no serious trouble result
ing from this refusal to admit all of
the citizens of Tombstone until the fol
lowing . aturday evening when the
miners had been paid off, and the town
was unusually hilarious. A dozen men
attempted to enter the Elr-phant and
were told to kepp out. They held a
consultation. That always meant in
those days a quiet talk as to their re
spective armaments.
In a twinkling the Elephant was
fired upon with pistols from the out
side. The place was In full blast at the
time. The dance girls went shrieking
behind the bar. The gamblers at the
tables snatched their money and chips
and huddled in groups for protection
behind one another, while the men
dancers drew their own shooting irons.
The outsiders were careful not to shoot
an men on the inside, but one stray
shot did kill a barkeepor. The mirrors
behind the bar were ruined by bullets
through the windows. The lamps were
extinguished b- bullets. The fancy
woodwork in front of the bar was bat
tered by lead, and the big bass viol
in the orchestra was shot through sev
eral times.
The scare was so great to many peo
ple in the Elephant that It never re
gained its popularity, and dancing 1 went
back to the other and earlier saloons in
the town.
The people of Tombstone, in spite of
all their shooting proclivities, had a
great time. There was a killing every
day or two, but that did not check the
prevailing hilarity. They were great
jokers. A favorite joke on strangers
was to take them out hunting antelope.
Mayor Robinson had a fine pack of
hounds and two horses, one called Ca
lamity and Greyhound. Calamity could
only go a few miles when he was wind
ed and almost useless. He was reserved
for the stranger. On the way Robinson
would incidentally talk of hostile Apa
ches and the possibility of meeting
them until the tenderfoot's hair began
to raise. In a gulch a score of Tomb
stone fellows would be hid, all rigged
up in complete Indian outfits. Robin
son would manage to lose all the hunt
ers and be alone with the â¢ stranger
when they reached the gulch. Thm
out would come the bogus Indians with
a blood-curdling war whoop.
"Fly for your life!" Robinson would
yell, and. sticking his spurs into Grey
hound, he would be out of sight in a
minute.
It was a sight to see the tenderfoot
trying to mend the pace of Calamity
with the Indians always a little in the
rear. The Indians would retreat at the
edge of town, and all the town would
be out to see the tenderfoot's arrival
and tell him with grave faces what a
narrow escape he had had. They never
gave the snap away and the game vent
right along by the year. Some of the
tenderfeet told hair-raising stories, a ia
Falstaff, of how they had slain a num
ber of the hostiles, but none ever told
they had been hoaxed.
When the mines began to peter out,
when the railroad built through South
ern Arizona, and when the ranches be
gan to be well-settled upon, new blood
went to Tombstone and the town quick
ly became an orderly, respectable busi
ness-like town. The hurdy-gurdys, the
dance houses, faro banks, the cowboys
with their red sashes, sombreros, high
heeled boots and clanking spurs, are
gone forever, but for two years never a
livelier town flourished in wealth and
wickedness than Tombstone.

LAST STAND OF THE TRIBESMEN
IN THE SUN-BAKED SOUDAN
Africa, Routed From Her Last Defense, Gives Way to the European.
One need not be an Englishman to appreciate the situation in Egypt. For years England has been haying her
own troubles with the bloodthirsty, treacherous fanatics who infest the vague region of desolation known as the Sou
dan. Who does not remember the fate of "CHinese" Gordon at Khartoum and the blot on En ands name winch
was a consequence of his abandonment? The present campaign under the leadership of General Kitchener is one of he
most picturesque and most thrilling in the annals of modern warfare. The results of the victory will be momentous
for it practically throw* the Dark Continent open to uninterrupted European trade from Cape Town in the south to
Egypt in th Â» north , C^cll Khodes 1 dream of a railroad across the continent from north to south may soon become a
relmv now and it ma^run all the , way over British territory. This last battle of the tribesmen against the combined
Egyptian and British force, was practically the last stand of the native against invading civilization. Africa is now
open to trade and its consequences.
ABOVT:. a scorching blue sky,
emitting tongues of fire; be
neath, scorching brown sand,
reflecting tongues of fire;
around, a scorching atmos
phere, parching the skin and blinding
the eyes; every man's, mule's, aye, even
camel's tongue dry with thirst and |
water a precious boon that has to be I
husbanded carefully. This is the ro
mance of the desert as known to Brit
ish troops, the romance through which :
British warriors, black and white,
Egyptian and Tommy Atkins, Moham
medan and Highlander, hurled them
selves against the power of the Mahdl
and gained two of the most brilliant
and far-reaching victories of modern
days.
Twelve thousand men, following the
Union Jack, marshaled against sixty
thousand Dervishes! Truly it might
have looked to outsiders as though
General Hunter were deliberately sac
rificing a "forlorn hope" to the dignity
of the British empire. "What were
these among sj many?" Moreover the
Mahdi's Dervishes were reputed the i
best fighters in all torrid Africa; men !
who fought with frenzied fanaticism, j
who died on the battlefield with visions j
of Paradise and beckoning houris; men j
who took precautionary measures for
not dying superfluously; who planned
zaribas carefully stockaded with im
penetrable hedge of prickly mimosa, \
its stems inside, its thorns massed
against the limbs of the enemy; men
who, believing in heaven-born substi
tutes, made unto themselves a living j
fence of miserable slaves, chained to
gether in the trenches and ready to
fight with maniacal energy in the hope j
of deliverance by death. And against
this fevered, determined, well discip
lined host Hunter could only pit his
mixed regiments, one-fifth of the enemy
in number, and mainly recruited from
the despised Egyptian who had proved
his worthlessness some sixteen years
ago.
When Arab! Pasha rose In 1882, when
Alexandria was bombarded and Wolse
ley by his brilliant and decisive flank
movement won permanent laurels at !
Tel-el-Keb'*\ the knell of the black sol- j
dier was exposed to be rung. He had j
proved himself hopelessly incompetent;
whatever his muscular value might be :
his head and heart were in the wrong j
place; as a fighting machine he was J
utterly worthless and for all available \
purposes he might as well be buried. i
This was what Mahmoud Pasha re- j
membered when, in 1898, he made grim *
preparations to receive the British j
forces at Atbara. He had numbers, I
but he did not rely on numbers alone !
as he carefully planned his zariba, pre- |
paring every trap that could trip un- !
wary limb or break active back. Cun- i
ning shelter pits, unsuspected holes, |
"surprise" trenches, ambush hillocks, j
all hidden in nature's tangle of palm j
stem, sharp thorn and prickly grass.
Around, the impenetrable stockade and
the triple trench with its slave gangs,
desperate between their two fires. What
white man could come out of this devil's
device unscathed? And the white man
must be already weakened by his
desert miseries, by heat and its attend

NEW PENSION LIST.
Continued From Page 17.
cations have been received, it is esti
mated at the War Department that
there are already from three thousand
to four thousand cases which form the
basis of pension claims. In speaking
to-day of the pensions growing out of
the present war, Commissioner of Pen
sions Evans said to me:
"No additional legislation will be
necessary for adjudicating these pen
sion claims. They come under the
general pension law of 1862. Ido not
anticipate any great rush of applica
tions. We will create a new division,
in order to keep these records to them
selves, but we will not Increase the
office force. We are now waiting for
the completion of the War Department
records. The disabilities from this
war will not be nearly so great as from
our last war. Wounded soldiers who
would have died in the former war now
get well. This is owing to more hu
mane implements of warfare and extra
skill in surgery. Formerly a doctor
went along with a broadax and a
butcher knife, and cut off a leg where
a foot was injured. Surgeons now make
few amputations.
"By the way, they have been jump
ing on me lately about dropping from
the pension rolls soldiers of the last
war who have re-enlisted in this.
There are about fifty of these cases.
But they have no right to say that I
dropped them. The law dropped them.
The law distinctly provides that a sol
dier or sailor who Is on duty and draw
ing a salary for services cannot draw a
pension at the same time. If they
prefer the salary to the pension that
is all right, but they should not ex
pect both when the law distinctly
states that they should have but one."
The existing pension laws, without
any necessity for passing more, make
ample provision for pensioning sol
diers of the piesent war and their de
scendants. They come under the law
of July 4, 1862, and the law of March
3, 1873, which was amendatory of the
former law. This law, as amended,
provides that any person of the several
classes In the military service of the
United States after March 4, IS6I, and
who has been or 1b disabled subsequent
to that date, shall, upon making new
ant sickness, by lack of water and
above all by lack of sleep; for night in
the desert meant eternal watchfulness,
lying under canvas with the fear of
murder, or lying In the open with one
eye for the enemy.
Yet white men are notoriously long
suffering and unflinching, and if Queen
Victoria's white men had been coming
along 2000 strong even Mahmoud Pasha
might have had his doubts. But the
real Britishers were a handful, not
half a dozen regiments; all the rest
were trumpery Soudanese and Egypt
ians, cravens who stood in awe of the
Dervishes and were bound to give in
at the first scare. If the Mahdi's fa
vorite general could ignore his dignity
it is probable that Mahmoud Pasha
snapped his fingers in triumph.
Mahmoud Pasha had forgotten
Tommy Atkins.
The British non-commissioned officer
of Klplingnesque repute is not noted
for polished behavior, neither is his
yoke easy to bear. The recruit who
falls unto his drilling mercies does not
light on pleasant places nor is his ear
accustomed to sweet language; he
wishes many times a day that he had
never been born â so does his drill ser
geant. Yet the day comes when each
is proud of the other and their coun
try of both; and Tommy Atkins had
decreed that that day should dawn for
the black Egyptian. Undoubtedly he
was the most unpromising product that
had ever been swept into the ranks,
but since he was elected to fight for
The Widow he should become worthy
of his high calling if British oaths and
British energy could accomplish the
feat. And so Tommy Atkins drilled and
swore and execrated and "licked into
shape" till at last he foresaw the day
when he should weep with pride over
the doings of his graceless black re
cruits.
The day dawned on that morning
when the romance of war in its trail
ing horror, its untamed ferocity, its
sublime self-abnegation, swept on to
ward the mimosa-circled zariba of At
bara. There were white-skinned heroes,
with time-honored battle-cries in the
van that day; Warwickshires and men
of Lincoln, Seaforths and Camerons in
their vivid tartans, surged up and on,
their ranks thinning before the deadly
Dervish fire; surged on irresistibly to
the sound of bugle and pipe and the
crash of artillery, till at length the
mimosa hedge was wrenched asunder
and the pitiless hand-to-hand fight be
gan. But that which blanched the Der
vish heart was the unforeseen on
slaught of the blacks, the de
spised blacks, who thirsted
madly for revenge and who
had learned from Tommy Atkins how
to take it. Their brains afire, their
eyes blood red with rage, reckless of
death, their men dropping at the rate
of one to seven, yet blindly faithful to
their white leaders, they swarmed up
ridge and swooped down bank, carrying
everything before them. It was their
maddened, vengeful black faces that
the Dervishes first saw bursting
through the mimosa hedge; the black
faces that they last saw as they sank
in heaps adown the river's bed; the
black faces that they fled from across
the inflamed sand. And when the hour
of battle was over, that awful hour,
forty minutes in duration, which reck
oned its dead by thousands, it was the
despised, heroic black who was the
hero of the hour, who looked into his
officer's face with radiant, adoring
fealty, while Tommy Atkins wept tears
of joy to think that his drill-swearing
should have produced such results.
Yet was that fateful hour but the
Initiatory triumph of Tommy and his
proof of the fact according to such
forms and regulations as are or may be
provided, be placed on the list of in
valid pensioners of the United States,
and be entitled to receive for a total
disability or a permanent specific dis
ability certain amounts according to
his rating.
The cases of widows and dependent
parents are provided for by section 1
of the dependent pension act of June
7, 1890, "Under the conditions and lim
itations of existing laws."
The Pension Office ratings under the
old law have long been established.
The loss of both hands or legs entitles
one to a pension of $100 a month. A
total disability in both hands or legs
entitles the soldier to $72 a month. The
list is graduated down to $6 a month
for the loss of the big toe and $2 a
month for the loss of any other toe.
The loss of sight in one eye brings a
pension of $12 a month, while the loss
of the eye itself Increases the bounty
to $17 a month.
The several successive steps through
which a pension application passes
when it reaches the Pension Office are
as follows: First: It is received in the
mailing division and the date of its
receipt stamped upon it. Second: It
is forwarded to the record division, re
corded, given a number, and the official
character and identity of the officer be
fore whom it was executed is verified.
The verification is generally made
through court certificates.
The third step is to send the appli
cation to an examiner In one of the
five adjudicating divisions, where it is
put on file. Its fourth experience
comes when it is reached in order and
charged out to the examiner who is to
handle it. He calls on the War De
partment for the record of the service
of the soldier named in the application
his discharge, his hospital treatment!
etc.
As a fifth step the claimant, if a sol
dier, is ordered before a local examin
ing board, given a physical examination
and required to furnish such evidence
as may be necessary to complete his
claim. (Claims as they come in are
generally incomplete.) The completion
of the claim may take weeks, or months
or years, depending upon the prompt
ness and the accuracy with which the
evidence is supplied.
A widow must file evidence showing
the legality of her widowhood, that she
has not remarried and establishing the
fact that the death of her husband was
due to disabilities Incurred in the ser
vice.
On the completion of a claim the ex
aminer refers the case with proper rec
ommendations to the board of review.
It is placed in the hands of some special
reviewer, who indorses his recommend
ation on the face of the brief of the
case, and the case is again charged up
to a re-reviewer. After this it is either
refem-d back to the first examiner for
correction of Informalities or further
evidence or it comes for approval to
the chief of the board of review. If
approved it is sent to the medical di
vision in order that the rates to which
the claimant is entitled may be written
in. The papers finally go to the cer
tificate division, where the certificates
Â»re written, and the claimant or his
attorney or his member of Congresj Is
notified of the admission of the claJm.
The certificates must be signed by the
Secretary of the Interior and the Com
missioner of Pensions.
The States from which applications
have so far co-n'ie in for volunteer ser
vice are Wisconsin, Illinois, Pennsyl
vania, Indiana, Connecticut, Massachu
setts, Maryland, Tennessee, Alabama
Michigan, Maine, New York, Kansas'
Nebraska and South Dakota. Very
well distributed, surely.
dark-skinned pupil. The Dervish force,
with its inexhaustible elasticity, wag
routed, not subdued, and the final day
of reckoning had yet to come. Tommy
and his black chum knew it as they
wrung each other's ha.Js and looked
into each other's vengeful eyes; over
yonder, where the Khalifa's black flag
waved above Khartoum, the black
man longed to wipe out old scores, the
white man had to avenge something
worse, an insult to "the widow," a be
trayal of the w ; low's hero martyr. As
the twain loosened their soldier grip,
each knew that the Union Jack must
float in the place of the black flag.
The Dervishes knew it too. It was
the fanaticism of despair, not hope, that
hurled them against General Kitchener
and his Anglo-Egyptian forces at the
battle of Omdurma.i. A generation has
passed away since Europe was con
vulsed by the throes of such a struggle
as raged from sunrise to sundown on
September 2; a battle where Mussul
manic barbarism massed itself against
Christian civilization, when the glitr
tering banners of the Khalifa, his cop
per and brass drums, defied the sober
British colors, the sound of fife and
bagpipe; when thousands of white
robed Dervishes, their eyes aflame with
visions of Paradise, swept down upon
grenadiers and Irish fusiliers, on men.
of Lancashire and Northumberland,
Warwickshire and Lincoln, on High
land Camerons, Egyptians and Sou
danese, all fighting, not for dear life,
but for the honor of the British Em
pire, the future of the African con
tinent.
Such a battle has scarcely raged
since barbaric days; in its mad fervor,
its grim recklessness, its relentless
cruelty, it recalls the hours of Moham
med's personal power. The wildest
limits of courage and hate were reach
ed the British troops, thrilled with ad
miration for an enemy who carried
flags to within a hundred feet of their
lines and dropped with the Mohamme
dan's war cry on his lins. But even that
dying heroism had its fiendish side, as
many a brave man found to his cost;
the Dervish falls with murder in hia
heart, drops when wounded only to
sham death; again and again as a
white soldier or surgeon bent over a
stricken form, the apparently dead
quickened, the wounded regained
strength, and the Christian helper was
struck down. And so it happened that
British soldiers had to do that deed of
horror which appals even Tommy At
kins, hail to kill the dying in mercy to
his own living, to kill with a wild
thought throb remembering how his
own wounded were being treated, while
the Twenty-first Lancers were inspired
to a feat of heroism unrivaled since the
hour of the famous Six Hundered.

NEW YORK, Sept. 9. -It is a
great honor to be invited to
Larchmont on ladies' day.
Larchmont is the home of the
great yachting club, and here
there gather all the millionaire
yachtsmen of the East.
Tt was a long time before Larchmont
had a ladies' day. The old millionaire !
talts and the half million tars wanted
Larchmont all to themselves. It was so i
comfortable to sit out under the trees
and view the water, and so delightful
to lounge in the boats in yachting rig j
without a. thought of dressing for dinner.
The sturdiest opposition to ladies' day
came from the rocking chair tleet. The
rocking chair fleet at Larchmont is fa
mous the world over. It is composed of '
men who go to a yacht club, yet never j
go to sea. The captain has not been
upon a boat for twenty years, except
out of necessity; and not one of the rock-
Ing chair fleet would be guilty of own-
Ing a yacht. There they sit all summer
long under the trees rocking and watch- '
ing the yachts v they toss on the Hud
son. But Larchmont has a younger mem
bership, and the young men really want
ed a Indies' day. They had young wives,
and there never lived a yoUng wife who
did not want to visit her husband's club,
fjo ladies' day at Larchmont has come
to be one of the very fashionable func
tions which swell New Yorkers love to
attend. The handsomest and newest
fashions are seen there, and for nn>' day
the old salts have the pleasure of ming
ling In the very up-to-date ultra world.
You would be surprised at the names of
Borne "f the "salts." They an- the fam
< us millionaires of New York and of
Newportâ yes, and all the large cities,
for Larchmont has a large out of town
membership, and yachtsmen from all
OVBT the country make their home at !
Larchmont when they visit New York.
Here they spend their evenings, and day
times they po tv town and transact busi
:n VVall street. As soon as they
reach "home" at night they cast off ail
habiliments of business and gel Into a
negligee and a pair of white duck trou-
Theo they enjoy life! It was these
comfort seeking yachtsmen who fought
a vigorous protest against a reception !
day.
I saw one fair Larchmont visitor a? she
â¢1 from the ears the other day and
turned her head toward the walk which
to the hotel. She wore a dress
which was of blue, out of deference to
1 :"or the army and navy; and be- j
time for the autumn rose,
Fhe wore a bunch of American Beauties

Her gown was of the new material.

This dress was made very airily aa

Another eharmiiis costume seen at I
mom was an old rose ladies' cloth

Fall Skirts,
rose dressâ green. The green was an old
green, not too bright, but of that soft, rich
hue which would harmonize so perfectly
with old rose. This dress was embroid
ered in black. Great stripes of the em
broidery extended down the waist and
down the skirt. At first sight it looked
like passementerie, but as you touched
the figure you saw that it was black silk
hand embroidery. Around the foot of the
skirt there was a very deep lace ruffle,
and there was a great deal of lace upon
the sleeves and over the shoulders.
The hat was trimmed in old rose and
green, and the wearer certainly attracted
a great deal of attention on account of
the shades of her dress, although she was
not an extremely pretty woman.
They are going to dress a great deal
this fall in the shades that are not the
standards. For example, they will wear
trianon brown, which is something like a
tobacco brown, and old rose and old
green. Thistle purple will be seen also,
and there is a shade of red which Is al
most a mauve which will be popular.
The plain brown, the plain green, the
black, the natural blue and the pink have
been somewhat put aside for these new
shades.
It is extremely trying, this verging from
the standard colors to the new ones on
account of the difliculty of matching. It is
almost impossible to duplicate the old col
ors with the new ones or even to combine
them, and on that account the new fall
suits seem impossible to many women.
They will hold to the comfortable chem
ls< tte as long as possible, and waists are
being cut with very low necks in order
to accommodate it.
There is a story told of a Larchmont
for one must now talk of yachting
resorts on account of the new cup ehal
lenge â U.at she went to a fashionable
house with only one dress. Daytimes she
wore it with a chemisette and in the
evening she wore it without a chemisette
as a low-neck dress. This may be some
thing of a stretch of comfort, but it is a
fact that very remarkable things are done
by the addition or subtraction of a neck
yoke.
They say that dresses are to be very
clinging this winter, but as yet they do
not show it. The Paris models, to be
sure, are a little close to the figure, but
the American modistes have not yet fol
lowed suit to any great extent. The only
BSlon to the clinging skirt is In its
set around th<- hips, which is certainly
very titrht. Glove fitting skirts over the
hips are very popular and skirts are
gored to the exact size of the waist and
they fit so tight that it seems almost im
possible to get Into them. This Is man
aged by a very long seam cut in the
Bide Of the skirt which is fastened with
hook and eye. All the fall skirts are
trimmed except the traveling skirt, which
is sometimes made plain, but even the
traveling skirt has its band of braid.
Stfeet dresses ,-ire ruffled sometimes to
the waist and you see every variety of
trimming upon them, from embroidery to
braid.
Indian summer comes in a few days
and then the Jackets that were worn a
week ago will be laid aside for the warm
after summer, which is so fortunately
ours. For three or four weeks It is as
balmy as In midsummer and the fall
dresses mt:st be light weight, in order to
be comfortable. HELEN WARD.

Special to the Sunday Call from Paris.
AT this sc.'!Â« 'n of the year It is hard
to find aoveltlea in dress at the
dressmakers', but sporting: cos
tumes have the greatest attrac
tions, aw therefore give illustra
tions of a few. Tne riding habit repro
duced, designed by Creed, can be as well
In either alpaca or pique, as can
also the costume reproduced from a
model by NlcbolL This style of habit has
already been worn for some time. But
tn< re is nothing more that is novel.
The costume by Creed, Rue de la Palx,
is of light black cloth. Over the skirt
is a hi) bit rounded behind, opening down
the middle in front and loose at the sides.
The corsage is maue to fit in the back by
seams, taken in su as to fit the body per
fectly, and adjusted in front by a bev
eled seam. It fastens down the left side
with black cloth buttons. The lapels are
faced with black velvet. Beneath the
habit is a cambric chemisette with linen
front, and the collar, which is very high
is aiso of linen. The scarf is of black
satin, tied in a sailor's knot. A boating
hat of sowi: straw, rather wide in the
brim, is worn with the habit. I'h'e crown
!s bound with wide black ribbon, fastened
in front with a hatter's knot.
The costume for driving in an automo
bile is reproduced from a model seen at
Petit's, E Boulevard -Ualeseherbes it is
of btigr waterproof woolen stuff. The
skirt is round at the bottom and tlgnt
>vr. the figure, i.ie front is quite flat
and plain, and made with a narrow
apron, widening and forming nicks down
to the bottom. The skirt is covered with
i flounces of different depths, the two lower
being equal and the uppermost murh
wider and set in at the waist. All three
are made without fullness and leave the
apron free. They are edged with five

rows of stitching, giving the effect of a
wide, fiat braiding. The corsage is a
close- fitting jacket, with a rather long
basque. It fastens down the left side
with three brown horn buttons, and there
are three buttons to match down the
right side. The front of the jacket is or
namented with live rows of stitching like
that on the skirt, which Is repeated down
the seams in the back and round the edge
of the basque. The lapels are square,
stitched with two rows round the edge
and fixed to the garment with horn but
tons like those on the front.
A GRACEFUL
WALK
TO BE thoroughly graceful long
steps and quick, short steps should
be equally avoided, remarks a
French woman. A stiff walk is also
very ungraceful, and that is the great
fault of English girls. They walk too
stiffly, and take too long strides.
Lines of Beauty on the Face
THE nose, which is so necessary to
the tout ensemble of the face, is
more often a subject of ridicule
than the object, as it should be,
of great care and gentleness. And
yet, how many a woman's other
wise happy existence is made utterly mis
erable by a nose that will persist in get
ting red and swelling to twice its normal
size, Just when she wants to look her best
and make a good impression.
A beautiful nose is the greatest possible
ornament to a woman's face, and so rare
that it at once excites the admiration.
Lavater, the physiognomist, declared
that there were thousands of beautiful
eyes to one beautiful nose. Sir Joshua
Reynolds says that "the line that forms
the arch of the nose Is beautiful when it
is straight."
It is said that only about three in every
hundred noses are to be found directly in
the middle of the face. The bridge of the
nose, which should follow a straight line
drawn between the eyes, usually di
gresses if only in a slight degree from
this line.
In these days of scientific advancement
thÂ« nose can be molded to almost any
shape desired. Where the bridge of the
none has been broken or destroyed by dis
ease a surgical operation may be per
formed, a new bridge inserted and the
now nose look quite as well as the old one
over did. Crooked noses can be straight
ened even after maturity, and in early
childhood, owing to the soft nature of the
Spanish women have a very pretty
walk, naturally, as also have Italian
country girls, and all accustomed to car
ry weights on their heads.
To exercise walking, a weight on the
head is a very good lesson. You must
not be content, however, to walk Straight
before you without letting the weight fall
from your head. You must turn back
ward and forward, and from side to side,
as Italian country girls do when they
carry their water jars from the well, and
can turn In all directions without a drop
of water being spilled from the jar on
their head. More marriages are made
up at the well In Italy than at any other
public place. Young rustic fellows stand
by the well to watch the girls fill their
jars and carry them away on their heads
with a grace given only to them; and the
most graceful among them has the most
admirers from whom to choose her hus
band.
The French are also very graceful walk
iTS.
Study your walk, girls. Tnke dancing

self, and every one who will can acquire

cartilages that form the nostrils, the
shape of the lower part of the nose may
be greatly improved by gentle, continued
pressure. Stroking the nose downward
will often straighten out the saucy curve
of a "tip-tilted" nose.
The nose is an extremely sensitive feat
ure, and resents roughness by becoming
red and swollen and assuming curves that
detract from its symmetry. However, any
noae, be it ever so perfectly modeled, is a
sore trial to a woman, when, without any
apparent provocation, it becomes red and
blotchy or develops an unsightly crop of
blackheads. And when the nose shines
equal to an inextinguishable searchlight
woman feols that she would like to go,
like the ostrich, and bury her head in the
sand.
A red nose is usually an outward sign
of some stomach derangement, althougn
it may result from a variety of causes,
such as a weakened circulation, garments
which are too tight or from irritation
produced by too rough usage of the hand
kerchief. And very often it is caused by
a tendency to erysipelas.
Outward applications will be of lfttle
use until the presumable cause has been
removed. If it is indigestion, remedy this
by rigid abstemiousness from all greasy
foods. Look not upon the paÃtrles when
they are tempting, and close your nostrils
to the appetizing odor of cakes and
goodies as they issue from the oven. Acid
ity of the stomach, which is a cause of
red noses, can sometimes be entirely
overcome by drinking several times a day
a glass of pure water, as hot as can be
taken.
When the trouble arises from poor vir
culation the following treatment is often
successful. It is what the French call in

NEW LEATHER
BELT
THE latest fashionable belt Is of
leather, and Is woven in a many
stranded flat braid. The leather, of
the usual width for a belt, Is cut In
even strands about an eighth of an inch
wide, and these strands are woven In a
basket weave its full length; that is,
close to the buckle and eyelets.
This belt clings closer to the waist than
any other, and is pliable, which no other
leather belt can be. It is also less heat
ing and stretches lengthwise, making
the waist appear smaller instead of larg
er and more bulky, as most leather belts
do. These belts are furnished with the
popular harness buckle, and are made in
all colors, but preferably of tan or black
Bicarbonate of soda, 250 grammes.
Pour the boiling water on the leaves;
let stand half an hour; strain; add the
soda, and pour all into the warm water
prepared for the bath. While the inward
cause is being removed, outward applica
tions may be made. About the best of
thepe is witch hazel. Dabble this on the
inflamed nose several times a day.
A shiny nose is an infallible sign of an
overindulgence in those things which one
should not eat. Mineral waters are a most
excellent corrective for a skin which is
too liberally endowed with natural oils.
Eat plenty of green crisp salad, and in
vest your next month's pin money in a
box of big, ripe, rosy-cheeked apples.
A noted P:iris specialist says that a
woman who cats three or four' apples a
day cannot be ugly. The apple acts on
the liver, gives a beautiful complexion
and is fattening. Sometimes a shiny nose
may be entirely cured by bathing the
whole face daily in a quart of warm wa
ter in which a very small lump of com
mon washing soda has been dissolved.
Another excellent remedy which will
often prove a rapid transit line to happi
ness for the woman whose nose persists
in outshining every electric light In the
neighborhood Is the following:
Lavender Lotion.
Alcohol, four ounces.
Ammonia, one ounce.
Oil of lavender, one dram.
Mix, by shaking in a six-ounce bottles
Add one scant teaspoonful of this to
two quarts of warm water when the face
is washed. t'sed in such proportions it
is excellent, but if more of the lotion is
added it will, in time, make the skin too
dry and harsh. This is one of 'the things
that will have a very good effect If used
in snail quantity, but will have a decld-

edly bad effect if used too lavishly.
Do not do as did the man whose phy
sician prescribed arsenic to be taken in
small doses. Thinking that if the medi
cine were beneficial taken in such small
doses it must be doubly so taken in
twice the quantity, he immediately dou
bled the dose. A couple of days later his
friends, with much pomp and ceremony,
â buried him.
So, remember, one scant tablespoonful
(not a drop more) to two quarts of water.
After washing the face with this, apply
a little rosewater and the powder well.
Answers to Corresponderjts.
INFORMATIONâ I can recommend no
way of bringing about the end you de
sire, save a general reducing of flesh. All
sorts of injuries can come about by try
ing the remedies that are said to make
the bust smaller.
TROUBLED ONEâ Massage the collar
bones every night with cocoanut oil, and
oat goGd fattening foods. The high col
lar is responsible for most of the yellow,
wrinkled necks that all girls compla'n
so bitterly of. The distressing condition
of your skin must be caused by some
physical disorder, and the wise plan is
to find the seat of the trouble and do
away with htat. All the lotions and out
ward applications in the world will do
you no good as long as the cause re
mains. Avoid pastries, sweets and
pickles, and pin your faith to fruits, par
ticularly apples or oranges and Isabella
grapes. Then while you are getting the
blood in good condition, sponge the pim
ples with diluted listerine or tincture
of myrrh. When the pimples disappear,
THE CURIOUS LITTLE MUFF OF SEPTEMBER.
attack the blackheads by scrubbing the
face thoroughly each night with a cam
el's hair face scrubbing brush, warm wa
ter and white castile soap. Also, take
two hot baths a week, scrubbing the en
tire body with a flesh brush and soap. Do
not stay in the hot wator long enough
for It to debilitate you, and do not neg
lect the daily tepid sponge bath. If you
follow this treatment rigorously I am
quite certain the pimples will disappear
for all time. You were not quite delinite
enough about your hair. Let me kno^y
if it is oily or dry. What would be bene
ficial in the one case would be detrimen
tal in the other. Also, is it light or dark?
HATTIE J.â Here is the formula for or
ange flower skin food: Spermaceti, %
ounce; white wax, % ounce; sweet al
mond oil, 1 ounce; lanoline, 1 ounce; co
coanut oil, 1 ounce; simple tincture ben
zoin, 10 drops; orange flower water, 1
ounce. There is no reason why you
should not acquire the development you
desire even under the circumstances you
mention.
Massage with the cocoanut oil each
night, rubbing gently around and up. Dis
card all pads, see to it that the clothing is
loose, exercise with the arms and eat
plenty of fattening foods. Patience .and
time are necessary, for it will be at least
two months before you will notice any
change.
JUPITERâ Try bathing the dark circles
under and over the eyes with witch hazel,
but take care not to get it in the eyes.
Among simple home-made tonics for the
hair there is nothing better than a gen
tle massage of the scalp with the lingers
dipped in warm, pure olive oii. Brush
well each night and wash once in two or
three weeks with this wash, which will
make the hair glossy and remove from
the scalp the unsightly little (lakes: Yolk
of one egg, one pint of distilled water and
one ounce rosemary spirit. Boat up and
use warm, rubbing well into the skin of
the head. Rinse carefully in several
waters or the hair will be left sticky and
horrid Instead of silky and smooth. Do
not use soda on the hair and the soap
you mention is very much over estimated.
Compound talcum powder is excellent for
the skin. If it adheres to your face, I can
suggest nothing better.
E. E. E. E.â l do not prescribe medicine
or tonics. My mission is tv enlighten
womenkind as to the hygiene of proper
living and in the art of making simple
remedies at home wherewith they may,
if possible, improve upon Nature's handi
work. If your physician's medicine does
not agree with you, tell him so and he will
probably change it. If you feel that he
dors not understand your case, I should
advise you to call in some one else. As
CLOTH RIDING HABIT: By Creed.
soon as the cause of debility is overcome
and the system built up, the hair will
probably cease falling. An excellent tonic
i for promoting the growth of the hair is
made after the following formula: â¢
Eau de cologne, 8 ounces; tincture of
I cantharides, 1 ounce; oil of lavender, \<z
dram; oil of rosemary. dram. Mix
thoroughly and apply to the roots of the
hair every day or two. Moth patches are
very hard to do away with, as they are
usually the sign of deep-seated disease of
the liver. The standing remedy for this is
taraxacum, the extract of dandelion root,
and the usual dose is a large pill four
nights in a week, sometimes for months.
Then you might buy some of the limes
that are now in market, cut one in two
pieces and rub the piece on the dark
spots. Let it dry in, and then apply coM
cream, letting it remain on the face over
i night. Ask your physician's advice as to
i the patent medicine you have been using.
FREDERICAâ Am pleased that you
found the skin food so delightful. Many
of my correspondents have written me
the same nice things about it. I would
I advise you not to attempt to remove the
! large moles. The acid is all right for the
1 small moles, but let the large ones alone,
| as the scars resulting will be more un
sightly than the moles.
BURDENE- Follow directions given to
Jupiter. In rubbing the oil on the scalp
see that it does not get on to the hair it
self, else it will give it an oily look that
; is anything but lovely. Lemon juices and
glycerine are all right for the neck and
hands, but for the face I should prefer
mixing the lemon juice with equal parts
of rose water and rectified spirit. Mix
these together; next day decant the clear
portion and strain It through muslin.
Bathe the face night and morning with
the lotion, wiping the skin afterward with
a soft towel. If this irritates or roughens
the skin rub in a good cold cream after
using it at night.
LUCY A. T.â ln order to gain flesh
there must be absolute freedom from care
and anxiety. Sleep at least ten hours out
of the twenty-four. Eat liberally of food
containing starch and sugar, such as po
tatoes, fresh sweet butter, milk, cream,
fruits cooked and served with cream,
corn, sweet potatoes, beans, peas, fish and
oysters and desserts without pastry. Stay
out of doors as much as possible and take
moderate exercise. Sleep in a well-venti
lated room; but above everything else do
not worry and do not permit your nerves
to get the better of you. Rosy cheeks
come with health, good circulation, firm
muscles and a perfect digestion.
ALBERTINAâ A very good rouge may
be made by taking four ounces of finely
bolted talc and two drams of carmine
and mixing them together with a little
warm and diluted solution of gum traga
canth. Form into a smooth tablet and al
low it to dry. For the dry lips use a good
camphor ice, such as may be made from
this formula: Gum camphor, % ounce;
Bpermacetl, V* ounce; white wax, jounce;
sweet almond oil, 4 ounces. Melt In a hot
water bath. Take out of bath and stir in,
while cooling, a few drops of attar of

itiation, and six applications were pre
sented. On account of the Inability of L.
N. Boukofsky to attend meetings regu
larly, his resignation as trustee was ac
cepted, and W. Murray was elected to till
the vacancy. Considerable activity has
been manifested In this court of late by
reason of the fact that there is a race
among members for a gold medal, to be
awarded to the one bringing in the great
est number of candidates during a stated
time. Past Chief Ranger T. Woiters, who
during the previous term brought in the
greatest number of members, received at
the meeting a handsome badge, presented
by San L. Waller, past deputy chief
ranger. At the close of the meeting the
membership organized as the Sutro
mights Social Club and had high jinks
under the direction of George J. Strong.
A varied programme of a very interesting
character was presented, and there was
served up a flne collation, with light re
freshments.

INDEPENDENT FORESTERS.
Court Precita of the Independent Order

entertainment and dance to be given in
Mission Masonic Temple on Mission
street, near Twenty-third, on Saturday
next.AT THE THEATRES
SOME time ago in these columns
attention was called to the pass
ing of the great actors of the
world and to the painfully evident
fact that > worthy successors to
their arts and genius are not coming
to the foro or for that matter are there
any displaying talents that give prom
ise of carrying them on to the proud
heights upon which their predecessors
set the .standards of the world dra
matic.
Now comes the Dramatic News of
York and, taking up the subject
still further, asserts that the
situation i? oven worse than the con
clusions stated in the article referred
to.
"One of the crying needs of the stage
to-day," says that Journal, "is talented
young men who possess sufficient ex
perienoe to acquit themselves credit
ably in what are technically termed
leading parts."
On the nther hand it is found that the
supply of leading women is much more
generous and their promise of future
development of a high order of ability
far more encouraging. It is a surpris
ing fact that managers often find a
dearth of capable leading men and
many times perforce go to \he fast
disappearing ranks of the old school
for their lovers, and heroes. It may be
that our girls are smarter than their
brothers, that they are possessed of
greater ambition and not afraid to bat
tle with th.se endless obstacles to suc
cess known as hard work; but this does
not satisfactorily account for existing
conditions.
Among the hundreds of recruits that
annually j'>in the <irand Army if Thes
pians there should be enough good ma
terial to meet the demand. However,
the stubborn fact remains and it must
be confessed that it doesn't require
many pegs on a cribbage board to
enumerate the really first-class all
'round men in that branch of
the profession. Too many of
those who pose as leading
men are constructed on the stick
order and walk through a part with
regrettable similarity to an automaton,
while they carefully avoid the rules of
elocution and ignore the dramatic
â  f words and sentences.

Several explanations of this puzzle
are offered, none of which are satisfac
tory. The most acceptable starts with
the proposition that the combination
system is responsible for the trouble.
"First, on the ground that It drove out
the old standard stock companies and
kept them off the boards for many
years.
Second, that these stock companies
were trying schools, where incessant,
hard ami widely varied work developed
the best qualities of the true actor and
weeded out the incompetents and slug
gards.
Third, the combination system has
done little more than bring forth some
intelligent machines who, as ail 'round
artists, no more compare with the
products of those old-time stock com
panies than Richard Mansfield does
with a great star. In fact, it cannot
be truly said that the combination
plan is entitled to the credit of pro
ducing a single finished actor, judged
by the standard of those other days,
and that standard still remains for
comparison.
Some managers express the hope that
the revival of the stock company sys
tem will be lasting and that in the
course of a few years through the
threshing-out process the chaff will be
separated from the wheat, and the
average talking: gentleman of to-day
who is not graceful enough to be a
capable walking gentleman will be
relegated to his proper sphere â the rib
bon counter or the tail end of a street
car. May these times soon be with us.
By means of a little a^istance from
the lawmakers and the force of public
opinion, the high theater-hat nuisance
has become a thing of the past In this
; city, and people not in the front rows
j can now obtain an unobstructed view
; of the stage â a luxury unknown a few
| years ago.
While reform is the order of the day
some means should be found to abolish
a practice that in a degree is as great
an imposition as was the big hat. The
! late comers are the annoyance referred
| to. Th^y usually delay their arrival
: until the play is well under way, and
succeed in disturbing the whole house
'< and putting a majority of the specta
! tors in a bad temper. Some do this to
1 display their good clothes, others be
cause it is "different" from the practice
; of the common herd, and others still be
cause they were born to be late every
i where.
A manager in Denver has taken the
dilemma by the horns, so to speak, and
settled the aggravating quest o:. He
proceeded on the fact that the major
ity of his patrons were rot late com
ers and should not be imposed upon by
the minority who were. His plan,
which has been found entirely success
ful, is embodied in the fallowing rule.
which is printed in the programmes and
strictly enforced:

The Baldwin.
Now comes Modjeska at the Baldwin,
presenting a number of the great char
acters that have made her famous
throughout the world and stamped her
as one of the few elevators and digni
flers of the art dramatic. Her aims have
ever been lofty, she has always striven
for thr> true and perfect in her work and
her sniendid success proves how closely
she has followed her ideals. However,
for a woman of her refinement, intelli
gence and strength of character it would
be difficult for hc-r to be otherwise. Her
versatility is as wide as the legitimate
drama und she appears to be equally per
fect in one line as another.
The repertoire for this week will be:
On Monday and Thursday nights, "Mary
Stuart"; Tuesday. "Mac-da"; Wednesday
an<l Saturday nights. "Macbeth"; Friday,
"Camille." and Saturday matinee, "As
You Like It."

elaborate and splendid production of "An

The reception of "The Leading Man"
it is stated has more than met the expec
tations of the authoress, and the pres
entation might be prolonged beyond the
current week were it not that Mrs. Pa
checo is under contract to produce one
of her comedies each week during the
engagement.
On next Monday night at this theater
the latest work of this clever California
â¢authoress. "Woman's Wit," will b>Â» pre

be extremely funny and drawn on wider
and more grotesque lines than the pres

Traviata," will be given.
JYlorosco's.
Another thoroughgoing melodrama, full
of action and striking situations, will be
presented at Morosco's during the coming
week. It Is entitled, "The Land of the
Living," and was produced at this house
four years agd, after a run of 300 nights
in London. The story Is laid in England
"and Cape Oelony, the principal Bcenes be
ing a diamond robbery, a supposed mur
der, a great explosion and the apprehen
sion and punishment of the robber and
would-be assassin. It is, in fact, full of
exciting incidents, with proper propor
tions of pathos and comedy to make the
play particularly entertaining.
Miss Gertrude Foster, the clever emo
tional actress of the former Alcazar Com
pany, has been engaged for this special
occasion and will take the prominent part
assumed by Lucille La Verne in the ear
lier production. Isis Maynard, who comes
well recommended from Chicago and St.
Louis, where she is a favorite, and little
Rosie Bennett are also in the cast.
jKe Golumbia.
Hoyfs "A Milk White Flag" will be the
attraction at the Columbia during this
week. It has been remodeled and its
songs, catch lines and situations made
appropriate to the changed conditions
since the war with Spain. The play is
an exceedingly funny one and the well
trained company sends it through from
curtain to curtain with a snap and go
that keeps ah audience on the gui vive
constantly trying to conceive what the
next turn in the humor will be. The
most attractive feature of the perform
ance Is Mary Marble in the part of an
orphan.
Tf\2 y\lhambra.
At the Alhambra, the new home of
vaudeville, the present bill will be contin
ued during the coming week. However,
there will be a rearrangement of the pro
gramme in order to make a better dis
tribution of the star parts. Del Puente,
the noted barytone, will give new selec
tions, as will also Edith Hall, Corinne,
De Villiors, the illusionist, and John
Byrne, the momologulst.
"[he Orpheum.
Another strong bill is offered by the
Orpheum this week and while there are
only two new acts a number of the hold
overs give different turns, making almost
a new show. The headllner of the new
bill is Bessie Bonehill, whose work as a
character comedienne has made her fa
mous all over America. She is one of
the most talented little women that Eng
land has ever sent us. Hines and Rem
ington, whose picture of the tough boy
and his girl have given them a front
rank among vaudevillians, come with a
new act, entitled "The Road Queen."
Miss Remington's impersonation of "the
new woman tramp" is said to be exceed
ingly clever. Felix Morris and company
will appear in "The Old Musician." Mr.
Morris does some of his cleverest work
in the title role of this act. The Pas

is rapidly becoming a prime favorite m

They have shown themselves highly ca
pable in comedy and farce, even more so
than their predecessors, and now we see
them giving a very meritorious produc

transpose themselves into Mongolians,
enacting their lives and conscientiously
and admirably working out the weird
pathos and tragedy of the play.

a marvelous success, surpassing even
Sothern's other drama, "The Prisoner of
Zenda."
No less than four stars announce new
plays in which a duel scene is a conspicu
ous feature. The controversy between
Wilton Laekaye and Andrew -iack as to
the priority of their rights to a certain
original duel waxes hotter as the time ap
proaches for Mr. Mack to open his season
with "A Ragged Earl." Threats of in
junctions and lawsuits are in the air. Now
comes the announcement that Chaurtcey
Olcott's new play is to have as one of its
important episodes a stage duel of a novel
sort. Tim Murphy also makes known the
fact that his play, "The Carpetbagger."
contains a duel with knives, which is sure
to surprise even the old theatergoers,
whose memory goes back to Bowery
times when at least one Stage duel was
fought every night.
The memorial window presented to the
Church of the Transfiguration, New York,
by the Players' Club as a memorial to
Edwin Booth was put in place last week.
It was designed by John La Farge, and
is in form a single lancet. The subject
represents an actor seated and holding in
his hand a mask, at which he gazes con
templatively. "Vanitas Vanitatum" is
the title of the picture, which is supposed
to symbolize the futility of human effort
in relation to the greater problems of the
world. This figure occupies the upper
part of the window, which ends in a
sharp Gothic point. The face is not un
like Edwin Booth's. On the bottom part
of the window is this inscription:
As one in suffering all suffereth nothing,
A man that fortune" s buffets and rewards
Has ta'en with equal thanks.
Below the verse are the lines: "To the
glory of God and in loving memory of Ed
win Booth this window has been placed
here by the Players in 1898."

of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" Marks' donkey
positively refused to quit the scene in
time for little Eva to die. He had to be
carried out of view by the stage hands,
and he was vigorously protesting with all

without the customary pathos.

JOKE ON WEBSTER.
Tisdale, who many years ago was a
nail manufacturer in Agra warn, was an
intimate friend of Daniel Webster, and
many were the gunning and fishing
trips they enjoyed together, accom
panied only by a great big, strapping,
good-natured fellow named Seth Bump.
Calling the dogs and Seth early one
sunny summer's morning, they started
off. well supplied with refreshments.
traps and everything necessary to make
a gunning trip successful.
Suddenly arriving at the shores of a
pond, the dog swam across, leaving the
party to follow the best that they could.
"Say, Tisdale,." said Webster, looking
a little glum at the prospect, "how deep
is this water?"
"It's "all of fifteen feet and twenty
yards across. Why, going to swim it?"
answered Tisdate, laughing, although
it meant a walk of more than three
miles to go around the pond to the
point opposite.
"No, but I'm going across this stream
somehow."
"Say, Seth, I'll give you a dollar to
swim me across on your back," said
Tisdale, winking to Seth, w r ho grinned,
but shook his head rather doubtfully.
"O, come on! I'm a lightweight,"
coaxed Tisdale.
Finally Seth agreed and Tisdale was
soon safely landed on the other side.
"Now, Seth, I'll give you a dollar to
swim me over as you did Tisdale," said
Webster, who weighed more than 100
pounds heavier than Tisdale.
A dollar was a big sum to Seth. but
Webster's weight looked like a bigger
Job than he cared to tackle.
"Look here, Seth, I'll give you $2,"
said Webster, showing him the money.
This was too much for Seth and he
readily agreed.
When they had got well out into deep
water Tisdale shouted: "Look here,
Seth! Webster just winked to me that
he wasn't going to give you anything.
He's fooling you."
No sooner said than done, Seth Imme
diately sunk under water, carrying
Webster out of sight, and when he
came up spitting and spluttering, he
shouted to Seth, "I'll give you any
thing you say, Seth. Get me there and
you can name your own price."
"No fooling, Mr. Webster, this time,
or down you go to stay," said Seth
grimly.
When Seth with his live freight had
all but reached shore Webster smiled
although the water was running in
rivulets down his cheeks.
"Say, Seth, he's just winked again!"
shouted Tisdale.
Down went Seth for a second time,
carrying Webster out of sight, while
Tisdale rolled in agony on the shore.
When they reappeared language that
would hardly grace a Methodist prayer
meeting was heard in that vicinity.
"Say, it's all right, Tisdale, and I'll
settle. But If I ever get an opportunity
you and that dod rotted fool of a Seth
Bump'll swing for It," groaned Web-
ster, as he wrung the water from his
garments. â Medford, Mass., Mercury.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Sept. 10.â The stock market !
opened higher to-day under the impetus of
better prices for Americans in London. The
London advance was apparently manipulated
from this side, for the rise here was met by
quite heavy offerings in continuation of the
liquidation of the last few day:;, forced by the
calling of loans. The extent of this liquida
tion is reflected in the contraction of $6,775.7u0
in loans shown by the weekly statement of the
cltaring-house banks. Northern Pacific pre
ferred and New York Central showed the larg
est gain* in the railroad list, the latter on
short covering. The advance in Central was
lost but Northern Pacific preferred held per
sistently firm in- the reaction after the open
ing.
The reaction at the opening invited some
buying, especially in St. Paul, which rallied
near the close on the traffic statement for the
first week in September showing an increase
over last year's unprecedented high level of
UttiJ.272. The Industrials came more Into notice
in the second hour especially Tobacco, which
showed a violent recovery from yesterday's
weakness, recovering seven points on forced
covering of shorts. The - news which caused
the advance was not forthcoming, but pre
sumably had to do with the plug tobacco
agreement, the alleged failure of which caused
yesterday's decline. Sugar, Rubber, Steel and
Wire and Hawaiian Commercial were also con
spicuously strong. The continued shrinkage
of cash reserves of New York banks has been
the prevailing factor In the stock market dur
ing the week. The large demands of the
treasury on New York banks for cash In pay
ment of bond subscriptions are reflected in the
heavy decreases In all items of the hank state
ment. The large decreaso of $13,036,200 In the
actual cash balance is more than accounted
for by the diversion of cash from the banks
to the sub-treasury on bond subscriptions.
The condition of the money market has re
stricted transactions in the bonds as well as
in the stocks and prloes are generally lower.

LONDON MARKET. ]j :
NEW YORK, Sept. 10.â The Evening Post's
financial cablegram says: The stock market*
here were on the eve of the settlement.
Americans were slow and fell In
sympathy with the falling prices. Dinars hÂ«re
are covering in St. Paul. The money market
was firm on the New York exchange. Over
Â£100.000 was delivered from the Bank of Eng
land to-day.
Canadian Pacific, 91; Grand Trunk, 7%. Bar

PARIS, Sept. 10.â Spanish 4s closed to-day at

ASSOCIATED BANKS' STATEMENT.
NEW YORK, Sept. 10.â The Financier says:
The surplus reserves of the New York asso
ciated banks are now lower than at any time
slnre the panic of ISS3. Two years ago this
month, the surplus doprc-ssed to something
like $8,100,000, but call money then was at pro
hibitive figures, and imports of gold followed
immediately. Now confronted by on Interior
demand which has averaged In past seasons
over thirty millions, ivlth the treasury absorb
ing additional millions each week on bond pay
ments, and with business expanding In every
direction, money Is loaning at 4 per cent, al
though the fact of the matter Is that the banks
have little If any money to loan. The excess
reserve of the New York banks Is in the hands
, of a few institutions.
I The majority of tao banks *rÂ» loaned up to
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1898.
and beyond the required limit. The statement
of the current week is about what was antici
pated. The treasury took $14,000,000 from the
banks on bond account, and the loss to the in
terior between one and two millions. The clear
ing-house report makes the loss of cash about
J13.000.000. The decrease In deposits reached
the unusually large sum of $20,487,700. which was
due to the cash contraction named, and the
falling off of $6,778,700 in loans. It is to be
noted that had not the banks not called In out
standing loans, the surplus reserve would have
practically disappeared. The present financial
situation is anomalous. The country never had
bo much money, but it is distributed so that
It Is unavailable for use, and It Is needed more
than ever. The treasury, it Is true, by an
ticipating interest and maturity on bonds, is
exhausting every resource to restore to circu
lation Its idle funds, but the effects of this
policy are not yet apparent. As the circum
stances which have brought about an unpre
cedented condition are about to continue for
some time, the banks up to this time have dis
couraged the idea of a stringency In money,
but unless some relief 1b speedily obtained It
Is difficult to see how present rates can long
prevail. The promised Increase In bank circu
lation is slow in materializing and will prob
ably come, as has been the case In past years,
after the real demand for it hflc. passed. As
matters stand to-day the continued contraction
of loans with reluctant higher quotations seems
Inevitable.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Sept. 10.â easier tone in wheat
at the start was caused by the very heavy re
ceipts of wheat in the northwest. A break of
1% cent a bushel In the price of cash wheat at
Duluth which became known here about half
an hour after the opening converted the easier
opening tone into one of positive weakness.
Liverpool was firm at %d advance for Sep
tember and *id for December.' About the time
the news of the l%c break was received from
Duluth, a recess of the board was taken here
to view the procession of returning Chicago
volunteers. After the recess there waa half
an hour's brisk trading, but the weakness was ;
; the prevailing feature of the session. The close ,
was at a decline of lc for September and De
cember lost %Â©lc on the day. S
Corn States had no frost last night and the
cold weather bulls were most disappointed.
There was liberal selling of long corn bought
yesterday and the pit crowd was generally
bearish. December lost %c. â  .â  : -
Oats were weak in sympathy with the 'other
grains. May closed %@%c lower.
Provisions opened weak on a dull trade, but
good buying of lard by a prominent packer
brought about a general Improvement In prices
later on. Pork and lard left off 2Vic lower
each, while ribs gained 2%<?5c. â

THE STOCK MARKET.
The latter part of the week was distinguished
by a revival of interest in mining Hhares, due
to the prospects for resumption of deep mining,
and the whole line of Comstocks advanced more
or less, as will he seen by the appended table
of fluctuations. Concerning the possible re
sults of this deep mining a local contemporary
says: "In 1680 a body of ore extending down
ward from the 2500 to the 2600 level was passed
through in sinking the Sierra Nevada, Union
Consolidated and Mexican Joint winze assay
ing $36 a ton, but was not explored in any di
rection, as at that time ore of that quality
was passed by.
"On February 12, 18S2, an overflow of water
tapped in extending a drift from the Yellow
Jacket new shaft $000 level station Into Ex
chequer ground flooded the Gold Hill mines
above the 2600 level and caused a suspension of
operations on the Belcher 2700 level, where a
large body of high grade ore had been found.
"In March, 1882, fair grade ore was developed
on the 2900 level of the Mexican, and a large
body was cut In the Union Consolidated, ex
tending downward from the 2500 to the 2700
levels."
There was a lively business In local securities
yesterday, especially in Hawaiian Commercial,
which sold between $26 75 and $27 25, the tran
sactions amounting to 2155 shares. Hutchlnson
Plantation was rather easier at $58 RO@SS 87^-
The Great Eastern Mining Company of Utah
lias levied an assessment of H a cent per share
delinquent October 10.
The Spring Valley Water Company will omit
the payment of Its usual dividend of 50 cents
per share this month.

NED IN CUBA.
CHAPTER VIII.
HARRY Ostend Judge correct
ly that the bloodhounds were at
least two miles distant. He
pondered only an instant. Then
he decided that it was impos
sible to get away and escape the at
tack of the hounds at this time; and
that the Spaniards would follow close
upon the heels of the hounds.
"There are as many as three of the
brutes, Binnle." he said quietly.
"They will necessarily come from
the same direction and near together.
We have five or six minutes to make
ready and receive them. Then there
â will be a little longer interval before
the Spaniards will be here. You must
meet the hounds, Binnie, and I will do
what I can to prepare a rough breast
work of loes while you stand guard. If
you need any help I will come to you.
Take my rifle and your own. Give a
good account of yourself. We are in a
tight place, I will not deny that; but
that will be something to talk about
hereafter; now go."
At the word Harry Ostend, who had
marvelous strength, began to make a
breastwork of the fallen branches of
the forest trees, using a thick fragment
of a limb as a sledge to drive stakes
into the soft and yielding ground.
Meanwhile Binnie, taking a position on
a slight knoll, which overlooked the
trail for some distance, that they had
cut through the forest with their ma
chetes, drew up a log as a rest for his
rifles and there awaited the attack of
the ferocious bloodhounds, whose bay-
Ing gave evidence that t'.iey drew
steadily nearer. Another person took
position quietly beside him. It was
Julia.
"Back, girl," commanded Binnie: "the
danger here is too much; think if you
should be torn by the hounds."
"I will stay right here, Binnie," was
the determined answer.
Binnie looked in the girl's eyes and
now thpre reflected courage and dar
fng equal to his own.
"You are a heroine. Julia, if ever
there was one," he said warmly; but I
already know that. Hark, do you not
hear the brutes crashing through the
forest?" â¢
Blnnie wag not mistaken. The wind
was blowing directly toward the hounds
and their scent guided them. The re
sult was that the hounds did not fol
low thf trail when they drew near, but
took the shortest route, which was
through the thicket.
"Stand firm, Julia," said Binnie,
"and act quickly that we may not be
taken at a disadvantage."
It was now made clear there that
there were three hounds on the trail.
The baying was In three distinct tones.
How fierce it sounded. The hounds
had been employed by the Spaniards to
hunt down Cuban refugees. To make
them eager for the work the brutes
were kept half starved. They were as
dangerous and as savage as tigers
TluMr speed was terrifying: as they
darted forth in search of victims.
The Spanish captain, who had been
bo M-ell tricked by Julia, had released
them from their leashes for this work
and had said grimly as he did so
"The Americans will hnve a busy time
trying to fool these dogs."
Hardly had Birinie cautioned Julia
as to her duty when the throe hounds
dashed, in a murderous pack, through
the undergrowth of the forest, with
terrific leaps, their red mouths Wide
open, showing thHr horrible teeth
They were on Binnie's side of the for-
CRt, and they rushed at him ferocious
ly, each trying to outstrip the other
Their yells made the forest ring with
startling echoes.
Binnie was kneeling", and held one
ready rifle in his iron grasp. His other
ri.-e was not a foot away. A sharp re
port of a rifle was followed by a yelp
of pain. One hound had br>pn hit by
Binnie Not for i. second faltered the
brute, but on he came, limping alon?
with less speed, but as fiercely intent
upon tearing Binnie to pl<->pf> p as bpf ore
The first hound was crowded aside by
one of his companions, a groat animal
as large as a young lioness. Binnie
was ready and fired the r?cond time
What a phot ho mnde. The bullet en
tered squarely into one ey<"> of the
hound and pierced his brain, and befell
dead. The third hound at this paused
but hardly for an inr'int. Binnie drew
a bead on the brute enemy. His rifle
missed fire â missed Âupt when the sec
onds seemed to be fraught with life
and death.
Bef->re he could rise the hound was
upon him, and its shar*-- teeth were
hurled in the flesh of his right nrm.
Binnie knew, -vhile h** had patted
thro- h many perils, and he had faced
without flinching many dangers, that

this was the most critical moment of
his life. Overborne by the great weight
of the hound and the force of its as
sault upon him, he was thrown upon
his back. The hi ute let go its hold
upon his arm sought to seize the
boy by the throat. Binnie threw up his
hands to push the beast away, only to
have them torn and brushed aside.
Surely the brute would fix his deadly
grasp now, and 11 would be over in
another instant. Julia was busy en
gaging the wounded hound and could
not help him. But when was Harry
Ostend ever known to fail in an emer
gency? He saw, with horror, the
hound upon Binnle's prostrate form.
Ostend's pistol wis in his belt, but he
leveled it like a flash. Surely and
swiftly sped his bullet and th" hound
fel' over, mortally wounded, upon Bin
nie's cheat, the weight nearly suffocat
ing him.
Binnie uttered a cry of joy as he
struggled to his feet once more and saw
that Julia was not hurt. Shehart madea

pling the third houn<* which lay upon
the ground. With Y'~ machete Binnie
dispatched the brute.
"Hark," he said, "the Spaniards are
near; come away."
When the Spaniards arrived in this
threatening neighborhood they were
surprised, as they peered through the
trees, to see the three dead hounds, and
still more to observe the hastily con
structed breastwork behind which
but keeping out of sight Harry Ostend,
Binnie and Julia were at bay.
What happened next was character
istic of the cruelty of the Spanish sol
diers. They decided not to risk an at
tack upon the sharpshooting Ameri
cans. What then? They would burn
the forest and roast the Americans
Mive No Apache ever conceived
greater cruelty. To think was to
act. Torches of dry wood were applied
to the resinous trees in a dozen differ
ent places, and the branches crackled
into ready flame. High into the air sped
upward the flames, roaring and hiss
ing Close to the ground the dry grass
took flame like tinder and filled the air
with thick, heavy smoke, threatening
suffocation to all persons concealed in
the fire-engirdled area. From limb to
limb the fire leaped, and now tall trees
were like huge faggots, aflame from
the ground to the uttermost twigs.
Closer and closer drew the flames with
an awful roar, to the breastworks,
making deadly headway from all sides.
Mingled with the noises made by the
fire were other sounds, not less fierce.
The exulting Spaniards were cheering;
they were sure that they at last had
their most dangerous enemies trapped,
and waited for the flames to do their
work, standing near to fire upon the
trio if they should make a determined
attempt to escape from this fiery trap.
When Harry Ostend saw the flames
coming in his direction he only said:
"This c-nly forces us to retreat sooner
than I had expected. Never mind; the
Spaniards are so sure that they have
us now that they will not have their
eves open as they usually do when they
are on the watch. That circumstance

will make for us."
"How shall we escape?" asked Binnie
and Julia in the same instant.
"A good engineer never builds a fort
without providing a way to retreat
if it should be necessary to retreat. I
will not mystify you. When I was driv
ing 1 the stakes for this breastwork I
noticed that the ground seemed hollow
over by yonder tree. I dropped a peb
ble in a hole that suddenly developed,
and then listened. I am sure that the
ground is hollow under our feet, and
that we have a â "
"That we have a cave?" interrupted
Binnie, impatiently."
"Yes, a cave, and we will see about it
without delay."
It was remarkable â the confident
manner that Harry Ostend had, when
all seemed lost; but Binnie had learned
to have confident trust in him at all
times and did not doubt him now.
Shielded by the clouds of smoke, the
brave friends were able to ti>il unob
served. They tore down the breast
work and. used the limbs to dig with.
Suddenly the dirt began to slide, and a
mass of soil disappeared below.
"Hurrah, now," said Harry Ostend,
cheerily; "down with you, Binnie, and
explore, while I fix up the damage that
you have done."
Binnie's voice was heard from below
at once: "Ah, this is great; we have a
sure way to escape here if only we can
hide the entrance. Here is a cave, sure
enough."
"Down there, then, Julia," command
ed Harry Ostend, an order that Julia
promptly obeyed.
While Binnie had been below Harry
Ostend had pulled the tree limbs to
the hole in the ground. He now placed
them across the hole and heaped dirt
high above them, leaving, however, a
place large enough for hiÃ body to
pass through. When his feet struck
the bottom of the subterranean pas
sage he was still able to reach
the limbs above him. A strong pull
drew them over the hole, and the soil
slid in upon them and covered them
completely. The fire, burning off the
limbs of the forest trees, sent down a
mass of flaming debris, which was
heaped over the entrance to the cave,
and so effectually nceale-1 it.
When the Spaniards some time later,
seeking among the still smoldering
ashes, sought evidence of the death of
the Americans, they were unable to
even say definitely where the breast
work hat. been.
"The Americans were burned to
ashes," was the rep which the eager
soldiers of Spain : ade to their com
mander.
In the deep bed of a creek, miles
away, three smoke blackened persons
were moving slowly and cautiously,
without speaking, away from the scene
of the fire. Need I say that these three
were Harry Ostend, Binnie and Ned?
They were shaded fi m prying eyes by
the thick foliaged trees and by
the bushes which fringed the water.
In Harry Ostend's hands was a small
compass. With the aid of this the
party traveled, undeviatingly, in the
direction of the const. Where the
creek b me a brawling torrent, in its
flow toward the ocean, and filled its
banks, forcing the travelers to seek
safer footing above, the trio cautiously
emerged from the darkness to the full
light nf day.
They were upon a hill, and the land
scape below was wide and clearly in
view. They saw a fleet of transport
ships lying off shore, the decks of
which were crowded with soldiers.
Scores of small boats, laden to the edge
with armed mr>n, were coming ashore
from the transports. The hillsides In
all directions teemed with soldiers, and
Harry Ostend clearly saw that the gen
eral advance of the American army
upon the fortifications surrounding
Santiago de Cuba would soon be made.
The sight put elasticity into the steps
of the three friends and they hurried
forward until they were halted by
American soldiers. Uniformed like the
Spanish, Harry Ostend, Binnie and
Julia were regarded with suspicion by
the soldiers. They were marched a
short distance and were again halted,
while a soldier pushed his way through
a thicket and searched for an officer in
hiph rank.
rpon the scene now appeared two
eunbrowned men of commanding mien.
Harry Ostend knew them both at once.
"Colonel Wood," he said, "I have the
honor to report that we have come
through the Spanish lines in these dis
guises; that we have information of
value to furnish; that we are all good
American citizens."
The officer who had been addressed
as Colonel Wood turned to his comrade
in arms and said: "Roosevelt, let me
introduce to you the brave Harry Os
tend."
Harry Ostend was glad to be recog
nized, as he would now have no diffi
culty in carrying out a plan which was
dear to his heart. The reader undoubt
edly knows that Colonel Wood and
Lieutenant Colonel Roosevelt, the two
officers who stood before our friends,
led the famous Rough Riders before
Santiago. When Binnie heard their
names and knew who they were his
eyes sparkled.
"I have heard of you before, Binnie,
and through a good friend of yours, an
other brave California boy, your friend
Ned. He is, I may tell you, at work for
Admiral Sampson, and you are already
known by reputation. May I have the
honor, gentlemen," interposed Colonel
Wood, "to attach you to my command."
"I am yours to command," said Har
ry Ostend, who had hoped to be permit
ted to serve with the Rough Riders.
Binnie was overwhelmed at the good
fortune that had befallen him. Julia
alone held back.
'"And what says your boy friend,
Binnie?" asked Colonel Wood.
"He, that is she," aaid Binnie, trying
bard not to laugh, "Is a girl."'
"A girl!" ejaculated both of the offi
cers in surprise.
Harry Ostend briefly told Julia's his
tory to the officers. They were filled
with admiration for her fidelity and her
courage as they listen*- . to the story.
"Colonel," pteade'd Julia, "let me, too,
serve with the Rough Riders."
"Sorry, but that cannot be done," re
sponded Colonel Wood
"Nothing to authorize it in the army
regulations," added Lieutenant Colonel
Roosevelt.
"Couldn't you make a regulation to
fit my case?" asked the girl, archly but
eagerly. "I can shoot and I have been
under fire. Ask Mr. Ostend."
"No, it cannot be done." This was
the verdict reached.
"Very well," said Julia, her face hav
ing a very determined look as she
spoke, "when the fighting begins you
will find me there."
"Then you will "be a mutineer."
"You forget, Colonel Wood, that I
am a member of the army of Cuba
Libre."
As she spoke a bugle upon a distant
hill was blown. The cry was an
swered upon a nearer hill. Other
bugles took up the strain.
"That is the signal for the advance
of the American army, my brave girl,
and it is now too late to send you to
the rear. You shall go on as one of
my staff, if you will, if you think you
are strong enough to face privation
and death."
Julia, with a quick motion, and be
fore she could be prevented, took the
rough right hand of Colonel Wood in
her hands and kissed it.
"I will not disgrace you nor yet the
service," she said, passionately.
And now it was onward all along the
line. Onward to peri's which the
bravest man might shrink from. On
ward, onward, to victory or to death!

JACK NORTON'S RIDE.
BY ALMA S. BEMENDERFER,
ANGELS CAMP.
JACK NORTON lived with his
father and mother in a fruit or
chard near Newcastle. It was sit
uated on one of the high hills. The
red, newly "plowed ground was a
pretty setting for the peach trees,
which, seen from a distance, made one
think of a checkerboard so evenly were
they planted. In lieu of spending
money Jack was given peaches to sell
on his own account, which he did by
going along outside of the through
trains which stopped before going over
the Sierra Nevada Mountains into the
desert beyond.
Although there were many engaged
in that business, Jack, at nearly the
close of the season had $6, and every
time he counted that money in his
pocket he wanted to get more. Jack
at once consulted his friend, Tom Mar
tin, taking the money out and arrang
ing it even in piles on some fruit boxes
near the depot.
"Look at that. All saved since the
season began, and I haven't spent one
cent of it. No, sir. I intend to save
An' when my mommer says we may.
Toward niglit, when things get pink and
gray,
An' lonesome, we creep in an sit

In summertime.
till I get $10, then may be I will buy
a pony or put it in the bank."
"I am glad you have saved so
much," said Tom, slowly. "You have
far more than any boy we know, and
some of the boys and girls of our school
told me to ask if you would not give
some money to help buy an album for
the teacher."
"Well," said Jack, angrily; "so that's
what gets for telling he has
money. Want some, do you? No, not
now," jumping up and putting the
money carefully away. Jack ran quick
ly around the corner of the depot and
was just in time to see one of the
trains coming swiftly in. Getting his
peaches, Jack was soon going along
the side of the train. The windows
were open and many a 5-cent piece
dropped into his hat in exchange for a
small basket.
GRANDMOTHER'S BIRTHDAY.
BY ALICE TEBBETTS.
IT was in the year of 1848 when a
boat laden with passengers sailed
into San Francisco harbor. Among
the passengers was a little girl 12
years old. This little girl came from
Boston Her name was Muriel Halifax.
So to make the story short, Muriel
Fletcher as her nage was changed by
marriage, became my grandma. One
day in her old age she told us of her
childhood. . ,
When grandma was a little girl sne
never had any amusement to amount
to anything. Grandma was sitting
cozily on a rustic seat in the garden
when she said. "I will be 62 years old
two weeks from this Friday coming
and I never had a birthday party in my
life "
So May, Jessie and myself said that
on her birthday she should have a
party The girls had planned that
grandma should not know a thing
about the affair until the day should

hurried up. "What do you say to get
ting on board and selling in the cars.
There is plenty of time before the
train starts."
So they got on, and were soon going
from car to car, selling faster than
they could make change. Jack was sc
busy and excited that he did not heax
the whistle. The train started before
he noticed. Then he ran through the
aisle, out onto th"c platform and was
about to jump from the swiftly mov
ing train, when he was caught by the
conductor, who was standing there.
"No, no," young man. "That is not
allowed here," and taking firm hold ol
Jack's collar he led him into the car.
"Now take a seat and make yoursell
comfortable. It is useless for you tc
try to jump off and it is dangerous.
"When the next stop is made at a sta
tion I will see you off. Now. aboul
your ticket; who will pay for that?"
"Do I need one?" groaned Jack.
"Yes," said the conductor.

"How much will it cost to the next
station?"
"Three dollars."
Jack took half his money and paid
for a ticket. But that was not all.
Some of the passengers, hearing about
his awkward plight, came into the car
to laugh and offer suggestions as to
how to return home.
Finally the station was reached,
where Jack waited four hours to take
the train for Newcastle. He reached
that town with only 30 cents in his
pocket. Half a dozen boys, sitting on
fruit boxes, were there to 'laugh and
welcome him.
"Well, Norton," said Tom Martin, as
he met him later on the way home. "I
am sorry it happened: but haven't you
even 10 cents left for that album?"
Jack handed him his 30 cents.

grandma about the party, as we wished
to surprise her.
May and I led grandma into the par

grandma's coming.
"Oh! oh! what does all this mean?"
said grandma.
"Your birthday, your birthday," said
May.
"What, a birthday party for me? Oh,
you dear girls. How kind to think of
such an old woman as I. Some day I
may be able to repay you for your
kindness, I hope."
Then we introduced grandma to the
guests.
After a repast we all went into the
garden and had a nice tim- playing
games. Grandma enjoyed herself very
much and said that was one of the hap
piest days of her life.
The next year grandma was dead,
and we all felt sad when the birthday
anniversary came t-i she was not
with us.

NEWS OF THE MINES.
A big deal in hydraulic mining ground,
with promise of important future devel
opments, was one of the mining features
of the week. The old and well known
Boss and McCleary mine at Trinity Cen
ter, Trinity County, which has for two
or three years been the subject of occa
sional reports of its bonding or sale, has
just been transferred to new owners, or
at least the p-eater share of it. The
principal purchasers are Thomas and
Luke McDonald of French Gulch, miners
and capitalists, the former of whom is
a large owner of San Francisco prop
erty. The consideration is reported to
be $40,000.
The property consists of about 1000 acres
of river benches and ancient channels

rising from the Trinity River at place
named, sixty-five miles west of Redding.
The lowest channel lies 67 feet above the
present river and the highest SOO feet. The
average value of the gravel is good and
the total amount of gold contained has
been estimated by experts at $19,000,000.
During past years a million or more has
been taken out and work on a small
scale has been going on profitably dur
ing recent times. The property has been
waltinc for capital to establish the ooetly
plant and large scale of operations need
ed. This will now be done. The present
water supply of 500 inches, brought eight
miles from Swift Creek and delivered at
200 feet, will be trebled. A new flume
I'laJtuied will cost $15,000. Contracts for
400,000 feet of lumber have been let. New
giants, pipe lines, sluices, etc., and a
gravel elevator for the lower channel are
among the improvements planned. A
large number of men will be employed
and there will be busy Ecenes at Trinity
Center which 1b destined to move one of
these days and see Its overy lot washed
away to bed rock, for the town site is a
good hydraullcking proposition. It is a
common practice there for the loafers to
scoop up a panful of the street when ten
derfeet come along pan it out In the wat
ering trough and dhow by colors what a
rich country that Is.
A new and progressive feature Is noted
In the neighborhood of Oroville. one of
! the moet important regions of the State,
i in which capital is interesting itself in
the problem of working, mainly with
dredgers, large tracts of dry, low-gTade
gravel, as well as the river banks, bars
| juid beds. Of course, prospecting a bed
: of gravel to determine its average rich
, ness at various depths is the first thing
; necessary. Heretofore sinking shafts to
| bed rock has been the method pursued.
j The other day W. H. Mammon and others
I associated with him received at Oroville
I a steam drill, which Is expected to rap
â  idly bore to bed rock a six-inch hole tak
> ing out sufficient gravel for assays at a
j fraction of the Qsual cost. The pfospect
| Ing will be comparatively speedy and
j cheap, and so more prospecting will be
done.
There are a number of new dredger
i projects being got into shape or planned
; along the Feather River, and in a very
I few years this method of gold mining
: will be a big feature of the industry
! along the Feather and elsewhere. Among
| the dredgers now in process of building
| on the Feather are two near Biggs, a few
miles below Orovillle. Their cost will be
i about $20,000 each and each will handle
about 200 yards of material a day. In

elsewhere the gravel Is worked at a cost
of about 3 cents a cubic yard, or about

I cents a cubic yard in gold, which can
never be worked by the i.ydraullc pro

The Anaconda Mining Company has
added a new feature to the staff of men
who care for its great copper operations
at Butte, Mont It has hired a regular
"geologist" in the person of Horace B.
Winchell, who for some years has been
the able assistant of the State Geologist
of Michigan. He receives a fine raise of
salary. Heretofore mining companies have
expected their high-salaried mining en
gineers to attend to their geology.
Butte is just now, by the way, probabfy
the most prosperous mining camp on the
continent, and its own present census of
the year 1903 is about 100,000 population.

Miss Ryan, our millinery buyer, and imported pattern hats just arrived from the East.
Its great copper and silver mines and the
present boom in copper mining are re
sponsible. All the mining companies are
operating at their fullest capacity, hoist
ing 11,000 tons of ore a day. The develop
ment work now being pushed promises a
daily output of 15,000 tons a year hence.
One shaft of the Anaconda Company is
rapidly approaching the depth of 5000
feet planned for it. A story something
like this will be told some day of the
great, now undeveloped copper belt of
Shasta County In this State.
James H. Tibbitts. the mining engineer
of San Francisco and Redding, has been
for some time busy examining gold prop
erties for a Canadian syndicate at the
bead of which is Hon. A. G. Blair,
Canadian Minister of Railways and
Canals. It was for these people that he
experted tho Mountain mine in Sierra
County some weeks ago when he found
his mine samples salted. This syndicate
is considering some mother lode proper

SiÃklyou County mines for them.
Colonel yon Leight, formerly superin
tendent of the Alameda and Quicksilver

ore, which assays high in gold and silver.
A large gasoline engine will furnish the

About 500 flasks of quicksilver are being
shipped monthly from the Altoona mine
at Cinnabar. Most of it goes to Caetella
by pack train, but often 200 flasks a
month reach the railroad at Redding by
freighting team.
According to the Mountain Democrat of
Placeryille, Poverty Point, north of that
town, is one of the ricn spots of El Dorado
I County. It says; "Ix)w down on the
I north side of it John Melton is running a
; tunnel 600 feet below the shaft on the old
Jo White mine, which from recent and re
liable tests Is known to be one of the rich
est mines in the county. By going 500 feet
further down and running a tunnel under
the whole group of mines on Poverty
Point, including the Gentle Annie, he can
drain and work them all. That this Is the
ultimate object of his enterprise we are
well assured. While the undertaking is
great, the bonanza In sight is greater."
The Placerville Nugget T?ives briefly an
other of those abandoned mine stories as
follows: "In the Sonnet mine, near the
Riverside, a rich chute of ore has recently
been uncovered. This mine was formerly
worked by Geo. A. Koch & Co., who op
erated it for a few seasons and took out
gold to the value of $7G,000. They lost the
chute and the mine was abandoned.
Messrs. Davis & Lane located it a number
of years ago, have worked persevering] y,
and their efforts have been rewarded with
success. The rock mills from $80 to $100 a
ton and over, the estimated value of eight
tons now on the dump being $800."

IMPORTANT TO MINERS.
A New Apparatus That Will Revolu-
tionize Hydraulic Mining.
The canal being constructed in front of
the water-pumping works in Golden Gate
Park will be completed within the next
six weeks. It will be 18 feet deep, 450 feet
long and will supply all the water neces
sary for use In the park. It was at first
thought that it would require months of
time to dig the trench, but by the use of
the Krogh dredging pump, a new device
for this character of work and manu
factured by the Krogh Manufacturing
Company, at 9 to 17 Stevenson street, this
city, a great saving in time, labor and
money was made possible. The Krogh
dredging pump is compact and portable.
It Is worth the time of any one interested
In machinery to visit the park and see
the dredger in operation. While only an
eight-inch pump, yet it raises over 12609
cubic feet per hour, and over 25 per cent
of the mixture is sand and gravel. An
idea of the work performed by the
dredger can best be formed when it is
stated that it requires the combined and
untiring efforts of eight men to clear
away the sand and gravel from the dis
charge elulce. In fact, the dredger piles
up the wet sand so fast that at times- it
is necessary to cloÃe it down in order to
get the sluice cleared. The dredger not
alone carries up sand while in use at the
park, but It has been shown to be par
ticularly adaptable for mining purposes.
Some of the workmen disputed yesterday
as to the suction power of the dredger.
To settle the question a piece of rock as
large as a man's fist was thrown into the
canal. An instant later it was drawn up
and thrown out on the discharge sluice.
The machine Is particularly adapted to
elevating gravel and working hydraulic
monitors by electrical power.
'Ihe dredger Is being operated by the
Pelton water wheel, manufactured by the
Pelton Water Wheel Company, at 121-123
Main street. "The Pelton wheel," said
Engineer H. D. Saville, who is in charge
of the work of constructing the canal,
"Is a most valuable adjunct. It does the
work required with little labor or cost;
In fact, it does more work than a thirty
horse power engine and is easily moved
from place to place. I was looking for a
good motive power," said he, "and after
close investigation I concluded that the
Pelton wheel was what was needed. That
I was correct in that and also the selec
tion of the Krogh dredger has been
shown by the expeditious manner in
which the work so far has been accom
plished. Without them I doubt very much
if we would have more than one-quarter
of the canal excavated at the present
time."
The Peltoa wheel Is a California inven.

Division Headquarters Waiting for
the Commander-in-Chief to Move
as to Reorganization.
At division headquarters the reply to
the question, "What Eteps are being taken
to reorganize the National Guard?" is,
"We are waiting for Governor Budd, the
Commander-in-chief, to move in the mat
ter, that and nothing more."
As the commander-in-chief is not yet
ready to move in the matter, all affairs of
the guard remain as they have been for
the past two months. No one seems to
know when anything will be done.
Colonel Frank H. Powers of the Cali
fornia University (retired), who had been
detailed as aid on the staff of the com
mander-in-chief, has been relieved from
that duty.
Colonel W. E. Hopkins, surgeon general,
Colonel Gallwey and Colonel W. R. Smed
berg have been appointed a board to ex
amine into the merits of the Merriam
field pack as a proper equipment for sol
diers in active service. The board is to
examine into this with a view, if the re
port is favorable, to adopt it for the Na
tional Guard of the State in case the
guard, when it is re-established, should be
called into active service.

cently dismissed from the auxiliary navy.
Captain L. H. Turner, who commanded
the Iroquois of the auxiliary navy, has
returned to this city, and is now engaged
in the business he followed before he en
listed. He has not yet announced If he
will return to his former command in the
militia.
All the men who were mustered out of
the naval militia were under the impres
sion that they were to come under the
provisions granting all volunters a year's
leave of absence, but they discovered
their mistake a few days since, w..en they
were ordered to return to their respective
commands without delay. If they do not
within a specified time do so they will be
discharged from the service of the State.
Last Tuesday night a large number of
the men who were discharged from the
auxiliary navy met on board of the

CATS AND DOGS
DONE TO DEATH
POISON AND ACID USED ON
HAVES VALLEY PETS.
An Ag-ed Woman Suspected of Shock
ing Cruelty to Her Neigh
bor's Animals.
For several days the officers of the So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals have been investigating" a num
ber of cases of shocking cruelty to ani
mals in Hayes Valley. Half a dozen
valuable dogs have been poisoned to death
and as many cats have had their eyes de
stroyed by acids. Among those who have
lost valuable canines are M. Greer Kid
der of 123 Oak street, whose fine Irish
setter was killed with poison. James
Dockum of 128 Oak street is also the loser
of a dog in the same way. Francis Hagan
of 121 1 - Oak street, and four others on
the block below, are mourning the loss
of their pets. In fact the slaughter of
these animals assumed a wholesale nature
that caused consternation among all in
the valley who have these faithful beasts
for pets and to guard their property.
About the time the dogs were killed the
cats in the neighborhood were shockingly
mutilated. Mrs. M. Dowell of 111 Oak
street owned two valuable felines, and
one night she was awakened by their
cries, which were pitiful in the extreme.
She opened the door and the two poor
brutes staggered in, their eyes burned by
some kind of acid. The next day found
them sightless. Mrs. Clark of 109 Oak
street had a similar experience. Her fav
orite cat came home so badly burned that
the skin came off. and the cat died soon
after. Officer Walton, of the society,
made a careful investigation and found
that the suspicions of all who had lost
animals and the people in general in the
neighborhood were directed to an old
woman who was said to have an aversion
for such pets. Their suspicions were
based upon complaints recently made by
her to the police and others that the
barking of the dogs and the noise made
by the cats disturbed her so that she
could not sleep. Several days before the
poisoning and acid throwing began Mrs.
Green, of 117 Oak street, requested the
police officer on the beat to stop the dis
turbance.
Officer Walton found a number of peo
ple who had heard her say that if the
nuisance was not stopped she would use
poison. One of these is Mrs. Wightman,
of 24 Lily avenue, upon whom Mrs. Green
called with the request that she take care
of her cats or they would be poisoned.
Officer Walton visited Mrs. Green, who is
between 65 and 70 years of age, but she
denied that she had poisoned the dogs or
thrown nclcl on the oats.
RETURN OF LONGSTREET.
The Ex-Confederate Leader Con
cludes His Inspection of the
Northern Railroads.
Major General James B. Longstreet. the
famous ex-Confederate leader and lately
appointed United States Commissioner of
Railroads, reached this city early yester
day morning on the Oregon special nnd
left for Del Monte in the afternoon for a
three days' stay. The aged Commissioner
was accompanied by his wife, Colonel and
Mrs. C. C. Sanders, Miss Mortial Sanders,
Mrs. M. A. Sandors and Mrs. J. H. Hurt,
all from Gainesville, Ga., his native State.
Before leaving for the train the general
said that he was enjoying the best of
health, due to the active work in which he
was engaged. When asked about Tils im
pressions of the various land grant rail
roads that he has inspected, the distin
guished visitor replied that anything said
upon the subject would be uninteresting
to the public. He did say, however, that
the Central Pacific Railroad from Ogden
to this city was well organized and in
fine working order.
The general is delighted with this State
and intends returning next year for a pro
longed visit if conditions are favorable.
He also found Washington and Oregon to
be interesting States, but did not think
the run from Salt Lake to this State
cheerful. He admits having taken copious
notes with a view to using them in hl3
report, which he says must be in Wash
ington by the Ist of October.
, Engineer Curtis of the Southern Pacific
Company will accompany the Commis
sioner to Monterey and point out the in
teresting spots along the line. The party
will return to this city on Tuesday and
leave for Washington via the Southern
route. If time will permit it is the inten
tion to visit the City of Mexico before re
turning.
