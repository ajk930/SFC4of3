FIRE FIEND WOULD DESTROY
THE OCEAN BEACH PAVILION
The Massive Structure Saved
by the Timely Appearance
of Watchman Wilkins.
Officials of both the Police and the
Fire departments axe investigating a
case of incendiarism that gives promise
of sensational developments. The
great Ocean House Pavilion, at the
foot of the hill leading to the Cliff
House, â was found on fire at an early
hour yesterday morning, and every
Indication points to the fact that it was
fired by an ex-employe of Henry
Doscher, the proprietor. The building
covers a great area, and. being built
of the most Inflammable material,
-would prove easy prey to the fire king
if that consuming element once secured
the mastery. Whittlings of wood and
rags saturated with coal oil show how
desperate was the incendiary. Revenge
Is supposed to have actuated the man
to destroy property and endanger
many lives.
Shortly after 4 o'clock yesterday
morning W. T. Wilkins, night watch
man at the Cliff House, was making
his customary rounds of the great
building. He had been through the
stablys, the kitchen and other portions
of the establishment, and stepped out
on the main veranda. A~ ne did so
his attention was attracted by a great
blaze to the southward. One glance
was sufficient to show him that the
n House Pavilion was in flames.
Without a moment's hesitation he
started off at top speed for the scene
of the conflagration. Although Mr.
her, the proprietor, was sleeping
in the adjoining building, the Seal Rock
â¢â , neither he nor his wife nor ser
vants had been â¢ awakened by the
â¢ 'ing timbers. Mr. Wllkins was
the first on the spot.
H is iirst thought was for the persons
p in the pavilion and adjoining
houses, and he made a great outcry to
awakes them. Startled out of their
sleep, they appeared on the scene in all
Stages of hes-habille.
It was but the work of a moment to
organize an amateur fire department,
its v was readily seen that before an
alarm could be turned in for the near
:Â«ine in Richmond District the
building would be but a mass of smok
ing ruins. A bucket brigade was first
organized, but this did not prove effec
tive. "Billy" Geishen, bartender of the
Rock House, bethought himself of
a stout garden hose and soon had this
attached to a near-by standpipe. The
tire had been started at the corner of
the building, on the main road, near
the terminus of the Park and Ocean
Railway, and the flames were mount
ing up high. Mr. "Wilkins and Mr.
Geishen took the hose and practically
fought their way through the flames
that were bursting out from under the
building. Once under there they di
rected the water on the seat of the
trouble and soon had it under control.
The smoke and heat were stifling, and
several times they were nearly over
come. It was nearly daylight when the
fire was finally extinguished, and then
the cause was investigated. The work
of the dastardly incendiary was evident
on every hand. In addition to the
heavy fumes of coal oil, with which
the atmosphere seemed charged, there
was a hint of pitch pine about.
The investigators soon found more
material evidence of the work of the
incendiary. First to attract their at
tention was a heap of wood shavings
which some one had apparently
whittled out on the spot from some
pieces of soft wood. Mixed with these
was a lot of old rags, all redolent of the
odor of coal oil. The would-be incen
diary had planned his vicious deed
well, and it was only the elements
which saved the great building from
total destruction. Not a breath of air
was stirring to fan the flames started
with such malicious intent. Had they
pr-rured any headway no power avail
able would have stopped them until
they had laid waste the building and
those adjoining it. The match had
been cunningly applied, at the corner
where the flames would have had a
full sweep of the great structure, and
where they would have left nothing but
â  few burning embers to mark the
havoc they had wrought. The building,
whirh is partly insured, is the property
of A. P. Hotaling & Co., and is leased
by Mr. Doscher. He has a small
amount of insurance on his property in
th<-> pavilion.
Mr. Doscher is convinced that he can
his hand on the man who applied
the torch to his property. He was in a
highly nervous state yesterday after
liis experiences of the early morning
hours, saying: "I am satisfied I havean
enemy who has determined to take des
perate chances to break me up in busi
!.<-ss. The man I have in mind w.us
recently discharged by me. and when
hi- left he swore he would do some
tl.ng desperate to injure me. I thought
his threats were merely idle words, but
I soon saw he intended to carry them
into effect. The first evidence of his
enmity was shown on Sunday when the
pet bvar which I have had for a lone
time was found dead in its house. It
had been poisoned during the night.
I am not going to take any more
chances and have employed a watch
man, who has instructions to deal harsh
ly with any suspicious characters he
may see prowling about the place."
Mr. Doscher was so much disturbed
by the exciting scenes through which
ho had passed that so soon as he could
place his business affairs in order he
went away .to the country, where he
could rest in seclusion and cjuietness.
W. T. Wilkins, night watchman at

occasion. He is a cousin of Manager
Wilkins, of the world famous hostelry
on the edge of the ocean. "I had made
my customary rounds of the Cliff
House," he said yesterday. "and
stepped out on the southern balcony.
As I did so my attention was at once
attracted by a bright light at a corner
of the Ocean House Pavilion. One
glance was sufficient to tell me that the
place was on fire, and I ran as fast as
I could down the hill to render what
ever assistance I could. My first
thought was to turn in an alarm, but
it was evident from the start the fire
had made that it could burn the build
ing down in a few minutes: certainly
long before the firemen could hope to
arrive. There was not a soul about
when I reached the *./ene, so I at once
awakened Mr. Doscher and his wife,
the barkeepers and all the men about
the place. We first started to fight the
fire with buckets, and then 'Billy'
Geishen secured a garden hose and we
went at it with that. The two of us
went in under the porch through the
smoke and thus got at the seat of the
fire. There was a strong smell of coal
oil and something that smelled like
pitch. After we put the fire out we
found rags and whittlings of wood all
saturated with oil at the place where
the fire started. It was fortunate that
no wind was blowing, as had there
been any the pavilion would have been
wiped out of existence, as nothing we
could have done with the appliances at
hand could have checked it."
The building, with its great organ,
is well known to all persons who have
ever visited the Ocean Beach. It is a
popular place for dancing parties fre
quented by people of a certain class.
It has also gained renown as the head
quarters of Tom Sharkey whenever he
is preparing for a ring engagement in
this city. Here he had his gymnasium,
and from the door nearest where this
fire originated he used to sally forth
twice a day, clothed in his faded bath
robe, for a swim out in the breakers,
which often roll mountains high and
sound like thunder as they break on
the sandy beach.
The authorities expect to apprehend
the fire fiend, and will deal with him
in a summary manner.
JOINT GUARDIANS
OF THE CANAL
America to Act With
England.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. 6.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: The Senate committee on
the Nicaraguan canal will add to
the canal bill now pending a provision
intended to bring about a treaty with
Great Britain for a joint guaranty of
the neutrality of the canal. This pro
vision is embodied in an amendment
which has been prepared by Senator
SAX FRAXCISCO, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1898.
Harris of Kansas, who is one of the
closest students of problems relating to
to the construction of the canal, as well
as one of the most earnest supporters
of the canal project in Congress.
The Senate committee, of which
Senator Morgan is chairman, will meet
to-morrow to consider this amendment,
as well as to formulate a supplemental
report concerning the new concession
which was granted by Nicaragua dur
ing the recess of Congress. At this
meeting the plans of the friends of the
canal will probably take shape. The
fact that the report of the commission
of which Admiral Walker is chairman
will not be ready before about January
1 is regarded by Senator Morgan and
other strong supporters of the canal as
unfortunate, and it is feared that the
result of this delay, taken in connec
tion with a desire of Republican leaders
to confine this session to absolutely
necessary matters, will be that the
canal will have to go over to the new
Congress.
The Harris amendment will authorize
the President to negotiate a treaty
agreement with Great Britain for a
joint guaranty of the permanent neu
trality of the canal.
It is designed to meet the English ob
jections that the plans of Congress for
American construction and control fly
in the teeth of the expressed terms of
the Clayton-Bulwer treaty.
The failure of the President to make
any mention in his message of the ex
istence of that treaty has called forth
a note of criticism from London news
papers, particularly those which are re
garded as representing the views of the
British Govemmf-nt. The President's
failure to refer to the treaty is con
strued as an encouragement to Con
gress to go ahead without any refer
ence to the terms of that document
which Great Britain contends are and
ought to be still in force. The Ameri
can contention has. of course, been that
Great Britain's violation of the terms
of that treaty have been such as t<^ give
this Government full warrant in going
ahead with the construction of the
canal without any reference to its pro
visions.
It is Senator Harris* idea, and Sen
ator Morgan agrees with him, that the
simplest way to prevent any misunder
standing is to authorize the President
to make an agreement of the kind con
templated by the Rmendment.
LOS ANGELENOS TO
BOOM THE CANAL
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 6.â At the
Chamber of Commerce in this city to
day a meeting of prominent business
men was held to map out a plan of ac
tion for the booming of the building of
the Nicaragua canal. It was decided to
send a number of workers to Washing
ton to carry on a campaign for the
canal there. Another* meeting to select
the men to represent this section in
Washington was called for next week.

CRAWLS FOR HOURS
ON HIS STOMACH
Wounded Man Covers Two and One-
Half Miles Before He Finds
Assistance.
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 6.â With his left
kneecap shot away and his leg mangled,
Frank Miller, a prominent young farmer
of Sacramento, crawled on the flat of his
stomach a distance of two and a half
miles over the Yolo basin this morning,
and, summoning all the strength he had
remaining in him, waved his hat above aia
prostrate borly and cried aloud for help.
His appeals were heard by a teamster in
the distance, who llft'd him Into his
wagon and brought him to the Receiving
Hospital at Saeramentr for treatment.
Miller, who has lived n Yolo County all
his life, started from his farm at an early
hour this morning to collect some bills in
Sacramento. He placed a loaded shot
gun in the wagon. When about four miles
from Davisville, driving along an aban
doned road, Miller's wagon struck a
bowlder and turned over, throwing out
himself and the gun. In striking the
ground the gun was discharged, the en
tire charge entering Miller's left thigh and
shattering his kneecap into splinters.
Miller lay helpless on the ground in the
bitter cold waiting for some passer-by,
and, none coming, he snatched at clumps
of grass ahead of him and drew his body
along over a tortuous stretch of two and
a half miles until rescued in the manner
described.
Surgeons were at once called to his as
sistance when he was brought to the Re
ceiving Hospital, and, while he will oe
crippled for life, it is thought his leg may
be saved from amputation.

GILLETT IN CHIHTJAHUA.
Has Not Been Arrested and Is Not
Likely to Be.
DENVER, Colo., Dec. 6.â A special to
the News from El Paso, Texas, says: A
private dispatch from Chihuahua con
firms the report that Grant C. Gillett, the
cattle plunger, is in that city. He has not
been arrested, according to the dispatch,
and is not likely to be. Shaeffer of Kansas
City and a Pinkerton detective arrived in
Chihuahua yesterday in quest of Gil
lett. They have a warrant for his arrest
for obtaining money under false pre-
tenses, but persons familiar with the ex
tradition treaties say mat the Mexican
Government will not surrender Gillett,
similar cases having frequently arisen in
the past. It is believed that Shaeffer will
endeavor to coerce or persuade Gillett to
settle with him.
Total Loss by Fire of the
Lumber Laden Ship
W. H. Starbuck.
Another marine disaster has to be re
corded. The American ship "William A.
Starbuck while on her way from Port
Blakeley for South Africa caught fire
and was burned to the water's edge.
The captain, his wife and three children
and some of the crew escaped in the
boats and reached Hawaii, but the sec
ond mate, steward and four sailors are
missing. The cook was drowned.
A passenger who arrived on the
steamer Australia from Honolulu yes
terday told the following story of the
disaster:
"Captain McDonald was fairly well
when I saw him on the island of Maui
last month, but Mrs. McDonald was
prostrated by what she had gone
through, and it will be a long time be
fore she will be well again. The chil
dren bore the exposure well and
seemed to be none the worse for their
trip of twenty days in an open boat.
"The William H. Starbuck was load
ed by Renton, Holmes & Co. at Port
Blakeley, and she sailed for Cape Town
on October 15. She had aboard 1,012,585
feet of pine and redwood lumber and a
great number of doors and windows.
All went well until early in the night of
November 5. At 10 p. m. a flre was dis
covered in the forepeak and all hands
wgre called. A cursory examination
showed that all on board were in a
precarious position. The only way in
which the seat of the flre could be
reached was by the small hatch over the
chain locker, and the water that could
be passed in that way only seemed to
make the flre burn more fiercely.
"The captain and his officers held a
brief consultation and it was decided to
jettison some of the deck load in order
to reach the fore hatch. Over 30,000
feet of lumber was thrown overboard,
and about 3 a. m. the fore hatch was
clear and the covering raised. In a
moment the flames burst up as high as
f!i<i forelopo'iiliu.nt mast, and some of
the crew had to jump overboard to save
themselves from being burned. Lines
were thrown to them and they easily
scrambled aboard again. A glance
showed that the interior of the ship was
a raging mass of fire, so the captain or
dered everybody into the boats. Three
of the boats were provisioned and
launched, the captain in command of
one, the first mate of another and the
second mate of the third.
"The three boats stayed by the burn
ing ship all of the 6th and all that
night. The morning of the 7th she was
burned to the water's edge, so the boats

came together and another consultation
was held. The question to be decided
was, should the boats remain in the
track of passing ships and take the
chances of being picked up, or should
they make for Hawaii, 2000 miles away.
Owing to the limited supply of water it
was decided to try to reach Hawaii.
"The only boat that had a compass
and navigating instruments was the
captain's, so the other two had to fol
low him as closely as possible. After
three days of fine weather a storm
came up and blew very hard during
the night. The next morning the third
boat, containing the second mate, stew
ard and four sailors, was missing and
was not seen again. When the ship
wrecked men in the two remaining
boats were twelve days on their way to
Hawaii another storm came up and
the mate's boat capsized. The cook was
hurt in the accident and sank before
help could reach him. The mate's craft
was now damaged and useless, so the
captain had to take him and his crew
into his boat. In order to do so nearly
all the provisions and stuff in the cap
tain's boat had to be thrown overboard
to make room for the men.
"Everybody was then placed on short
allowance and for eight days Captain
McDonald, his wife and three children
and the nine members of the crew knew
what starvation diet meant. Finally
they made the island of Maui and land
ed at Hookeua, where they were hos
pitably received and everything possi
ble was done for their comfort.
"The ship was burned in latitude 13.10
north, 131 west. No one knows what
started the fire. The men lost all their
effects and had nothing but what they
stood in when they landed at Hookeua.
Captain McDonald and his family will
probably come up from Honolulu on
the next steamer."
The agents for tke William H. Star
bucfc in San Francisco were the firm of
Hind, Holph & Co. From Cape Town
she was to have gone to Newcastle, N.
S. W., in ballast, thence to Kahului
with a load of coal, and thence to New
York with a load of sugar. She was
1272 tons net burden and was built in
1882 by Goss, Sawyer & Packard of
Bath Maine. She was 194:1 feet long, 39
feet broad and 24:3 feet deep. She was
owned by the "Sailing Ship William H.
Starbuck Company."
The news of the loss of the Starbuck
reached Honolulu by the steamer Mau
na Loa the day the Australia sailed for
San Francisco.2

Precautions Taken to Prevent the

Labor in the New
Territory.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.â The
President to-day transmitted
to Congress the report of the
Hawaiian Commission, con
sisting of Senators Cullomand
Morgan, Representative Hitt. President
Dole and Judge Frear of Hawaii, to
gether with the text of the bills drawn
by the commission for the government
of the islands as a portion of the United
States.
The preliminary portion of the report
is mainly descriptive of the Hawaiian
Islands, the inhabitants, the existing
Institutions, the public domain, produc
tion, climate, harbors and shipping fa
cilities, and various conditions of gen
eral interest. The remaining portion is
mainly devoted to the discussion of the
legislation proposed by the commission,
giving in the appendix the various re
ports of sub-committees and copies of
the bills suggested.
Three bills are formulated for the
considi- 'ion of Congress. The first and
principal one outlines a general plan of
government, and the other two deal
with subordinate questions. Of the
main bill the commissioners express the
opinion that it will prove to be "such a
measure f the government of the Ha
waiian Isla- as will best promote the
interests of their people at the same
time that it promotes the interests and
maintains the sovereignty of the peo
ple of the United States."
It provides for the erection of the isl
ands into a territory of the United
States, to be styled the Territory of
Hawaii. The bill contains provisions
for the government of the Territory,
giving it executive, legislative and ju
dicial officers. A Governor, Secretary
of the Territory, a United States Dis
trict Judge, a " nited States District At
torney and a Unled States Marshal are
to be appointed by the President, and
an internal revenue district and a cus
toms district are created.
The offices of President, Ministers of
Foreign Affairs, Finance and Public
Instruction, Auditor General, Deputy
Auditor General, Surveyor General and
Marshal are abolished. The officers of
the Territory under the new regime are
an Attorney General, with similar pow
er and duties as now possessed by the
Attorney General of th' republic of Ha
waii, with a few exceptions; a Treasur
er, with similar powers and duties to
the present Minister of Finance, and
such powers and duties regarding
licenses, corporations and companies
and partnerships and registration of
prints, labels and trademarks as are
now possessed by the Minister of the
Interior, except as changed; also a
Superintendent of Public Works, a
Superintendent of Public Instruction,
an Auditor and a Deputy Auditor, a
Surveyor with the powers and duties
of a Surveyor General, and a Chief
Sheriff, to succeed to the duties of
Marshal of the republic, all to be ap
pointed by the Governor.
Probably the most important portion
of the bill is section 4, defining citizen
ship, which provides that "all white
persons, including Portuguese and per
sons of African descent, and all persons
descending from the Hawaiian race on
either the paternal or maternal side,
who were citizens of the republic of
Hawaii immediately prior to the trans
fer of sovereignty thereof to the United
States, are hereby declared to be citi
zens of the United States."
Provision is made for a Legislature to
consist of two houses, a Senate to con
sist of fifteen members, as at present,
and a House of Representatives, con
sisting of thirty members, double the
membership of the House under the
Hawaiian republic. The members are
to be elected at a general election to be
held on the Tuesday after the first
Monday in November, 1899, and bien
nially thereafter. The Supreme Court
is to be the sole judge of the legality
of election to a seat in either house in
case of contest. No member of the
Legislature is to be eligible for appoint
ment or election to any office of the

MEMBERS OF THE HAWAIIAN COMMISSION.
Territory, and no officer or employe, no
tary public or agent of the Territory is
to be eligible to election as a legislator.
There is also a provision that no per
son who, having been entitled to qual
ify and vote prior to October, 1897, and
since July, 1894, failed to register as
such voter, shall have a vote, unless he
shall take an oath to support the con
stitution of the United States. The ses
sions of the Legislature are limited to
sixty days in duration, and each mem
ber is allowed $400 as a salary and 10
cents a mile for traveling expenses.
A Senator is required to be a male
citizen of the T "nited States, 30 years of
age, to have resided in the territory
three years, to be the owner in his owe
right of $2000 worth of property, or vo
have during the preceding y-ar re
ceived $1000 income. Representatives
must be 25 years old, male citizens,
must have lived three years in Hawaii
and must own property or have an in
come of $250 a year.
Voters for Representatives are re
quired to be male citizens, 21 years old
and of one year's residence in the ter
ritory, to have registered, to have paid
all taxes due the Government and to be
able "understandlngly to speak, read
and write the English or Hawaiian
language."
To be qualified to vote for Senators a
person must possess all these qualifica
tions and be subject to all the condi
tions required of voters for Represen
tatives, and, in addition, must own in
his own right real property worth $1000
upon which valuation legal taxes shall
have been paid for the year preceding
that in which he offers to register or he
must have actually received a money
income of not less than $600 during the
previous year.
Five registration districts are pro
vided and the Governor of the Terri
tory is authorized to appoint registra
tion boards with the advice of the Sen
ate.
The bill also provides for the election
of a delegate to the House of Represen
tatives in Congress by the voters quali
fied to vote for representatives in the
Legislature, this delegate to possess
the same powers and privileges now
accorded to other delegates in Congress.
The Governor is to appoint a Chief
Justice and two Associate Justices of
the Supreme Court, the Judees of the
Circuit Court, the members of the
Board of Health, Commissioners of
Public Instruction, Prison Inspectors,
Boards of Registration, Inspectors of
Election and other public boards that
may be created by law and all officers
whose salaries exceed $2000 per annum.
Other provisions of the bill are as fol
lows:
The Governor is to possess the veto
power, but his veto may be overridden
by a two-thirds vote of both houses of
the Legislature.
The Legislature is authorized to
create town, city or county municipali
ties. -." â¢ r . j
Foreign roods and articles imported
into the islands after July 7, 1898. are.
if afterward brought into the United
States, to pay the same duties charged
upon like articles when imported from
any foreign country. The existing
laws of Hawaii, not inconsistent with
the constitution and laws of the United
States or this act, continue in force,
subject to repeal or amendment by
the Legislature of Hawaii or by Con
gress.
The laws of Hawaii relating to pub
lic or private lands continue in force
until changed by Congress, but no
leases of agricultural lands are to be
granted, sold or renewed for a longer
term than five years, unless Congress
shall direct.
This is the usual provision found in
the acts of Congress providing for the
establishment of Territorial govern
ments in the United States, but the
Commissioners regard the provision aa
exceptionally important in this bill for
many reasons, among which they men
tion the continued Importation of Chin
ese labor into Hawaii. Remarking on
this point they say: "It has been the
policy of the government of Hawaii,
before and since the establishment of
the republic, to import men under labor
contracts for a term of "ears at the ex
piration of which they are to return to
the countries from which they came.
Those brought in are mainly from Chi
na and Japan. Since the act of Con
gress annexing Hawaii was passed pro
hibiting Chinese immigration, Ha
waiian sugar planters have seemed to
be making an unusual effort in securing
the importation of Japanese laborem,
fearing trouble and embarrassment on
account of Jnsu "lent labor for the
care and carrying on of their sugar
plantations. Of course, it becomes
necessary to extend our labor laws
over the islands, so i to prohibit all
kinds of foreign contract labor from
coming to the territory, first, because it
is the policy of this country to keep out
all kinds of cheap foreign labor, includ
ing coolie labor, and thereby prevent
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1898.
ing such labor from interfering with
the wages of American labor, and sec
ondly, to protect our manufactured
products from competition with manu
factured goods produced by cheap alien
labor. The general laws of the United
States will place the people of the Ter
ritory on the same footing as the people
of the States and other Territories of
the United States in regard to foreign
labor.
"The question whether white labor
can profitably be used in the susrar
plantations is yet a problem, but the
planters are preparing to give such '&
bor a trial and some of thorn believe
it will prove superior to the labor of
either Chinese or Japanese.'
The Commissioners take pains to ex
press their united opinion that die plan
outlined for the government of Ha
waii cannot be regarded as a prece
dent for Porto Rico and the Fnilip
pines, saying on this point: "Much has
been said to the effect that the policy
of the scheme of government for the
Hawaiian Islands will be taken anl ac
cepted as an index or precedent to be
followed In the plan of government for
Porto Rico and the Philippines. In
view of this apparent expectation or
belief on the part of many good people
in the United States, the commission
deems it proper to say that the people cf
Hawaii are capable of self-government
and have proven this by the establish
ment of the republic of Hawaii and the
adoption of a constitution and a code of
laws which would compare favorably
with those of any other government,
and under such constitution and laws
have maintained a stable government
for several years worthy of a free peo
ple. The people of these Islands are
more or less familiar with the institu
tions and laws of the United States,
while the laws of the little republic
are largely taken .from the laws of
this country. It cannot be said that
either the Porto Rlcans or the Fili
pinos are at all familiar with our sys
tem of government or with any other
based on the principles of liberty. The
underlying theory of our government
is the right of self-government and a
people must be fitted for self-govern
ment before they can be trusted with
responsibilites and duties attaching to
free government." These remarks are
made to negative the Idea that because
the people of the Hawaiian Islands
cdn, in the Judgment of the commis
sion, be consistently given self-govern
ment to an extent almost equal to that
given the people in the Stales, it can be
safely Inferred that other Insular pos
sessions which the United States has
acquired or may acquire by treaty
with Spain can be granted equal free
dom in government.
The report is unanimous except on
one point, on which President Dole
makes a minority recommendation.
This recommendatio is for a board of
advisers to the Governor of the Ter
ritory, and he recommends that the
Treasurer, Attorney General, Superin
tendent of Public Works, and Commis
sioner of Public Lunds shall be con
stituted special counselors of the Gov
ernor, to be consulted by him concern
ing all matters of public policy.
Mr. Dole gives as his reason for this
recommendation the fear that without
some such provision the Governor may
arrogate to himself greater power than
is contemplated.
The weight of the objection will be
better understood in view of the recom
mendation of the Commissioners that
the Legislature shall hold regular ses
sions but once in two years as hereto
fore, which circumstance would furnish
the Governor with the opportunity, if
he should choose to seize it, of remov
ing any or all the heads of departments
immediately after the termination of
the regular session o" the Legislature
and filling their places with persons
whose positions would be valid until
the next session of the Senate, which
might not occur for nearly two years.
The majority in their report express
the opinion that the precaution is not
necessary, saying that "the history of
Territories of the United States, cov
ering many years of experience, has
not, in the opinion of the commission,
shown a necessity for the creation of
any number of advisers."
Of the other two bills, one relates to
Hawaiian Bilver and the treasury note*
and the other to postal savings banka
in Hawaii. The first provides that un
mutilated Hawaiian silver coins shall
be received at par value in payment of
all dues to the Government of Hawaii
and the United States, and shall not
again be issued, but shall, on presenta
tion in sums of $500 to either Govern
ment, be purchased and recolned as
bullion at the United States Mint at
San Francisco. All Hawaiian silver
certificates are to be redeemed by Ha
waii on or before January 1. 1902.
The other is a bill which repeals the
Hawaiian laws establishing poÃtal
savings banks, and directs the Secre
tary of the Treasury to pay the
amounts on deposit In the postal say
ings banks In Hawaii to the persons
entitled thereto, terminating the in
terest on all deposits on the Ist of July,
1899, and forbidding further deposits
after that date. The report contains
an inventory of the public property of
the republic, which now inures to the
United States, which is of an estimated
value of $10,418,740, distributed as fol
lows: Government public lands, $4,
147,700; Government lots, sites, etc., $1,
481.800; department property, $4,789,240.
The report gives considerable data
in regard to duties collected, showing
that under the Dingley bill the amount
would have been much greater than it
was. This comparison shows that the
collection for 1897, which was $548,483,
would have been under the American
law $902,706. The report recommends
the construction of a cable to the isl
ands, to be under the control of the
United States, which, it says, is de
manded by the military condition ex
isting or liable to exist at any time.
INDEPENDENCE

Special Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, Nov. 29.â Yesterday
was Hawaiian Independence day, the
anniversary of the signing of the joint
declaration of Great Britain and
France on November 28, 1843, recogniz
ing the independence of Hawaii as a
sovereign state and agreeing never to
take possession, either directly or under
the title of a protectorate or under any
other form of any part of the territory
of which it was composed. It wag the
final act by which the Hawaiian king
dom was admitted within the pale of
civilized nations. Hitherto It has been
a great day of rejoicing with the Ha
waiianÃ, but this year it waa only the
formal fact of a national holiday by an
act of the Legislature of 1896, and while
all Government offices were closed and
the Government band played there was
no observance on the part of the peo
ple except by a few moonlight sere
naders in search of reward. The Amer

Good News for Those Who

It Comes From All Over the Landâ
"Dyspepsia Is Cured."
It is a well known fact that Hood's
Sarsaparilla cures dyspepsia. It has
been curing it for years, it is curing it
to-day and it will continue to cure it
whenever it is given a fair and faithful
trial by those who s-ffer from this dis-
ease. Some of the cures indeed seem
wonderful, but when it is considered
that Hood's Sarsaparilla is a medicine
scientifically prepared by educated and
experienced pharmacists for the pur-
pose of curing dyspepsia and all stom-
ach troubles; when it is remembered
I that it has power to give strength to
the stomach and tone up the whole di-
gestive apparatus, its cures seem only
natural and logical. If you have dys-

The transport Pennsylvania sailed for

The United States laws in regard to
Chinese immigration have been put into
practical effect by Commissioner
Joshua K. Brown and came into opera
tion for the first time on the arrival of
the Belgic. Hitherto, under the Ha
waiian law, return permits to return af
ter one year's absence have been grant
ed to Chinese laborers who have re
sided in the country p certain number
of years (it now is seven years), and no
further qualification was required. Mr.
Brown notified the Chinese Consul and
the Chinese bureau of the Foreign Of
fice that return permits could only be
granted under United States laws,
which require the laborer to be the
possessor of $1000 worth of property and
a family. j.'his disarranged all previous
arrangements, the notice being given
the very day the steamer was in port,
but matters have been satisfactorily ar
ranged by the return of the permit
money by the Government to those who
could not comply with the law. This
ruling will naturally have an effect on
the Chinese labor market for no laborer
can make $1000 out of his three years'
contract at $15 a month, with more than
half that amount expended for his rice
alone, and $36 is deducted for return
passage. The result will be either that
the men will remain in the country and
rehire, as they are doing, at higher
wages, from $18 to $20 a month, or else
they will leave the country for good
and all. If the restriction laws are as
faithfully administered in the future
as they have been in the past then
Chinese immigration to Hawaii has
practically ceased, for by the terms of
their contracts and the law nearly all
of which will expire within eighteen
months, the laborers must either work
at agricultural labor or leave the coun
try.
As regards Gallician laborers on
strike, it was ascertained that twenty
one of those who signed their contracts
in Austria were minors. Judge Wilcox
accordingly released them from their
contracts and they returned to the
plantation to work as day laborers.
They now want eight hours a day labor
Instead of the usual ten hours. The
other striking twenty-two were again
taken before the Police Judge for again
declining to work. They were sent to
jail at hard labor until they were will
ing to complete the terms of their con
tract and they are now working on the
roads and they claim that they prefer
this labor, with three good meals a day
and kind treatment under the jailer, to
plantation labor, and can afford to wait
for three or four months in the hope
that the United States will abolish con
tract labor entirely.
The engagement has been formally
announced of Major Davis, chief sur
geon of the United States Military Hos
pital here, to Mrs. Charles L. Carter,
the widow of the Mr. Carter who was
shot at Diamond Head at the opening
of the emeute of 1895, and who was one
of the most promising of our young
lawyers and local statesmen. The an
nouncement was made at a dinner at
which President Dole, Colonel r Barber
and other prominent people were pres
ent.
One of the principal figures In the
sensational failure of the Pacific Bank
is now here engaged in the commission
business, and the recent publication or
Dr. McDonald's letters to his son
"Dick" in The Call was particularly
interesting to Dr. William Jenningson.
At the time of the failure of the banK
Dr Jenningson was its European agent
and was encaged in floating a loan on
the Los Angeles Tramway Company,
one of the ventures of the McDonalds.
The epistles of Dr. McDonald were
specially vindictive against Jenning
son, who in speaking of them to-day
remarked that the whole issue was a
dead one to him and he did not under
stand the motive of reviving the fam
ous scandal. The only cause he could
divine was that it was in the interest
of the depositors, whom he was ready
to aid if they or The Call would de
finitely show him how his knowledge
could be applied in any effective man
ner. He knew The Call had always
done its best for the depositors.
"MYSTERIOUS" SMITH
OUTPOINTS WALCOTT
Given the DÂ«cision at the End o"
Twenty Hard-Fought
Bounds.
NEW YORK. Dec. 6.â "Mysterious BiÂ»
ly" Smith met Joe Walcott, the colored
fighter, at the Lenox Athletic Club to
night, and after twenty hard rounds Ref
eree Charley White decided on him as the
winner. The men weighed l*i pounds.
Smith outfought Walcott, and in the elev
enth round be knocked Walcott off his
feet with a right swing on tne jaw. A few
moments later both men went to the floor
from a clinch and Walcott stayed down on
one knee eight seconds. It looked then as
though Walcott would go out with anoth
er good blow, but by repeated clinching
he lasted the round out. as Smith was un
able to get to the mark.
Walcott was rather siow in his move
ments and got In so close to Smith that
the latter was unable to do much damage
at close quarters. Walcott was favorite
in the betting. His friends bet 100 to 80
on the colored man, on the ground that
Smith's recent fight with Tommy West at
Bridgeport. Conn., was not up to winning
form, and they argued that the last time
Smith and Walcotr met. also in Bridge
Â§ort. the negro had the upper hand,
mith won cleverly to-night, and when
the referee's decision was announced there
was very little adverse criticism.
Before the big fight Kid Broad of Cleve
land knocked out Mike Kearnes of Phila
delphia in the seventh round.
MASKED MEN
LOOT A POSTOFFICE
FRESNO, Dec. 6.â At about 6 o'clock
this evening two masked men entered
the postofflce at Clifton, twenty miles
south of Fresno, on the Valley Road,
and held up A. T. Wilkinson, the post
master.
After searching him for weapons and
money one of the robbers watched over *^
the postmaster, pistol in hand, while
the other looted the mail and the till
of the store. The robbers then took
their departure, commanding Wilkinson
not to budge from the store for ten
minutes, threatening to do him up if he
disobeyed.
Deputy United States Marshal Boust
of this city was notified of the robbery
and has organized a posse to pursue
the miscreants.
No additional Information concerning
the hold-up at Clifton postofflce is ob
tainable here at a late hour to-night.
The amount the robbers got away
with is not known, but It must have
been small.
No description of the men was given
by Wilkinson.
Deputy Marshal Boust leaves for the
scene of the hold-up in the morning.TERMS OF

PARIS, Dec. 6.â The peace
treaty of Paris is practically
an accomplished fact. To-day's
session disposed of the essential
features of the treaty, which will
be embodied in the following
eight articles:
First â The customary pre
face of treaties in the na-
ture of an expression of
amity and of hope for per
petual peace.
Second â The relinquish
ment by Spain of her sover
eignty over Cuba.
Thirdâ The withdrawal of
tho Spanish troops.
Fourthâ The relinquish
ment by Spain of her sover
eignty over Porto Rico.
Fifthâ Spain's cession of
the Philippines.
Sixthâ The withdrawal of
the Spanish troops there.
Seventhâ Payment by the
United States of $20,000,
000 for the Philippines.
Eighthâ The provision for
the "open door" commer
cial policy in the Philip
pines.
The rough draft of the treaty,
which may be considerably

the United States Peace Com

one of the most interesting pa

So completely are the details of

such as arranged for the Spanish

will be unnecessary.

settled, however, are the coaling

American offer.
The Americans have agreed
to transport Spanish prisoners
home, including the garrison and
sailors at Manila captured by Ad
miral Dewey and General Merritt,
as well as the soldiers and civil
ians held by the Filipinos, whose
return the Americans have guar
anteed.
As compensation Spain prom
ises to liberate all Cuban, Porto
Rican and Philippine political
prisoners. Spanish soldiers elect
ing to remain in the colonies may
do so, but it is more a matter of
economy for the Americans to
return the others, as they must
be fed as long as they are kept,
and Spain is unable to bear the
expense of repatriation.
Also the Americans have re
jected Spain's request for free
shipping for ten years in Cuban
and Porto Rican waters, they
having given the Spanish Com
missioners such poor consolation
as the latter may derive from the
permission to reapply when the
diplomatic relations have been
renewed for shipping conces
sions under the reciprocity
scheme of the Dingley law, for
which Senor Dupuy de Lome
was negotiating in Washington
when the war broke out.
There are still under discussion eight
secondary subjects which the Spanish
Commissioners broached last week, in
duing the status of patents and copy
rights.
The American Commissioners to-day
landed to Senor Montero Rios a writ
ten reply covering these questions.
There will probably be no joint session
to-morrow, as the Spaniards desire
time to consider this document.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.â The advices
from Paris to the effect that it might
be reasonably presumed that the Peace
Commissioners will be ready to sign a
treaty of peace within a day nr two are
fully confirmed here. It is learned that
the President's instructions to Judge
Day were to hasten the conclusion, and
to that end the American Commission
ers have been authorized to limit the
treaty closely to protocol points, leav
ing other matters, such as the aonuisi
tion of cable stations and naval sta
tions, to be dealt with hereafter.
As such separation of points Is en
tirely in line with the expressed desire
of the Spanish Commissioners, there
appears to be no reason, now that an
agreement has been reached as to all
of the protocol points, why those should
not be Immediately reduced to the form
in which it is desired they should ap
pear in a treaty and be at once signed
by the Commissioners. In this case, it
is possible that the treaty of peace may
be submitted to Congress even before
the Christmas recess.
GOULD WILL NOT
LOSE A FORTUNE
No Penalty Incurred by
His Marriage.
NEW YORK, Dec. 6.â lt is now defi
nitely established that Howard Gould
will not be called upon to sacrifice any
part of his fortune as a result of his
recently marrying Miss Katherine
Clemmons. This has Just been deter
mined at a family council at which it
was agreed that Howard should be left
In undisturbed possession of his fortune
of $10,000,000, one-half of which he
would have been called upon to forfeit
under an enforcement of a clause in his
father's will. This clause expressly de
clared that any one of Mr. Gould's chil
dren who should marry without the
consent of the others should forfeit one
half of his or her fortune, which should
be equally divided among the other
children.
There was strong opposition in the
family from the first to Howard's at
tentions to Miss Clemmons, and it was
unquestionably this opposition, which
was backed by the forceful argu
ment of an entailed sacrifice of $5,000,
000, that so delayed Mr. Gould's mar
riage. When at last his long courtship
was brought to a close by the quiet
wedding in the bride's apartments in
the Holland House, no member of the
bridegroom's family waÃ present. This
was generally accepted as an indication
that the other heirs were irreconcilably
opposed to tho match, and the predic
tion was freely made that the punitive
condition of the will would be enforced.
It is probable that the attitude of the
heirs would have been defined at an
earlier date had it not been for the fact
that at the time of the marriage there
were lacking only a few weeks before
the coming of age of Jay Gould's
youngest child, Frank, whose twenty
first birthday was celebrated on Mon
day, when he came into possession of
his $10,000,000 share of the estate and
was entitled to a voice in the decision
affecting the fortune of his brother. He
then fully concurred in the decision of
the other heirs that no penalty should
attach to his brother's marriage, no
matter how much the family might de
plore the alliance.

Will Be Submitted to Congress After
It Shall Have Been Passed

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.â The meas
ure which will serve as the basis for
the action of Congress this . session
looking to the increase and remodeling
of the regular United States army has
been completed by the commanding
general of the army, and to-day was
handed by him to Secretary Alger, who
will transmit it to Congress, probably
through the chairman of the House
Committee on Military Affairs, Repre

may deem desirable.

strength of one soldier to one thousand
of the population of the United States,
and two soldiers to one thousand of the
population in the dependent coloniesâap
proximately 100,000 men. '; â 
My recommendations are for what I be
lieve to- be the best Interests of the Gov
ernment, not only at present, but, as
far as we are able to see, for the future.
The recommendations have been made re
gardless of any personal consideration of
any officer or soldier now connected with
the military service.
The proposition of artillery, cavalry and
infantry is in accordance with the imme
diate necessities of the United States,
we have 4000 miles of coast, with twenty
se,ven Principal harbors, where are locat
ed millions of people and property of al
most inestimable value. That they ShOUld
properly be defended is demanded by
e\ery consideration of- prudence and good
administration. In addition to this we
have the important harbors in Porto Rico,

VEST OPENS THE
FIGHT AGAINST
EXPANSIONISTS
Holding of Colonies
Unconstitutional.
SO CLAIMED IN A RESOLUTION
MEASURE TO REWARD SER
VICES OF DEWEY.
Bill Presented by Hale to Revive
the Grades of Admiral
and Vice Ad
miral.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.â The first
note of the anti-expansionists was
sounded in the Senate to-day by Sen
ator Vest of Missouri, who introduced
the following joint resolution:
That under the constitution of the Uni
ted States no power is given to the Feder
al Government to acquire territory to be
held and governed permanently as colo
nies. The colonial -system of European
nations cannot be established under our
present constitution; but all territory ac
quired by the Government, except such
small amount as may be necessary for coal
ing stations, correction of Doundaries and
similar governmental purposes, must be
acquired and governed with the purpose
of ultimately organizing such territory
into States suitable for admission into the
Union.
A brief discussion of the navigation
laws was precipitated by the considera
tion of a bill amending those laws by
the addition of a provision that for
eign built vessels wrecked in the Unit
ed States, purchased by citizens of this
country and repaired to the extent of
thne-fourths of their value, shall b?
subject to forfeiture if they engage
subsequently in the coastwise trade of
the United States.
Vest, a member of the Committee on
Commerce, expressed his opposition to
the bill, principally because it afforded
protection to the coastwise trade, which
needed no protection. Under the pres
ent system of navigation laws this
trade had decreased from 75 per cent
to 11 per cent, and this country is now
paying $150,000,000 annually to foreign
shipowners for carrying trade that
ought to be carried in American bot
toms. This condition of affairs. Vest
declared, "was a scandal and dis
grace." He said he had been amused
at the suggestion of the President,
made in his message submitted yester
day, that our carrying trade be encour
aged by the payment of subsidies
"In other words," he said, "it is pro
posed to substitute for the vicious sys
tem of navigation laws a scheme of
subsidies that is even more vicious
than is the evil it proposes to ..emedy.
"Under the proposed policy of the
administration," continued Vest, "we
are to build a great navy. We are to
cease to be a nation of traders and.
under the impulse of the policy of ex
pansion, become a nation of warriors.
It would appear to me to be better
first to build up our carrying trade.
I would also let our people, through the
beneficent effects of such trade, buy
where they can buy cheapest."
Caffery of Louisiana, as a member
of the Committee on Commerce, op
posed the bill.
Finally it was made a special order
for next Monday.
Morrill reported a petition from the
Legislature of Vermont asking for the
revival of the grade of admiral and the
recognition of Rear Admiral Dewey.
Hale presented a bill to revive the
grade of admiral and vice admiral.
At 1:30 p. m. the Senate adjourned.
IN THE HOUSE.
Bill for the Government of the Ha
waiian Islands.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.â The House
was in session less than half an hour
to-day, when the death of Representa
tives Northway of Ohio and Love of
Mississippi were announced and an ad
journment was taken until to-morrow
out of respect to their memory.
The customary resolution for the dis
tribut.ion of the President's message to
the several committees having juris
diction was adopted and the deficiency
bill, carrying appropriations for the ex
traordinary expenses of the army and
navy, from January 1 to July 1, 1899,
was reported and will be taken' up by
the House to-morrow.
The report of the Hawaiian Commis
sion, transmitted to the President, was
laid before the House and referred to
the Committee on Territories, together
with a bill offered by Mr. Hitt, to carry
out the recommendations of the com
mittee.
ELECTRIC CuMPANIES
IN A MERRY WAR
SANTA CRUZ, Dec. 6.â Last evening
there was trouble between the Big Creek
Company and the Electric Light and
Power Company, resulting in eleven ar
rests on charges of unlawfully taking
possession of the latter company's planl
on Pacific avenue.
The Big Creek Company has a contract
to operate incandescent lights and fur
nish power to the powder works, in or
der to carry out its contract the piant of
the Electric Light and Power Comi>iiny
was leased until next month. The latter
corporation, by James McNeil, its presi
dent, thought that too much strain was
being placed on the machinery, so on
Sunday evening it took possession. Last
evening the Big Creek employes again
took charge, and fhe other corporation
had them arrested.
While the defendants were in court the
Electric Light and Power Company em
ployes gained entrance to the building.
Later the Big Creek Company had the
Electric Light and Power Company's
employes arrested. While the latter were
in court the Big Creek employes again
took possession and held it.
The Big Creek people say they inter.J
to remain in possession until the lease ex
pires. Last evening tho Big Creek wires
were cut. with the result that East Santa
Cruz was in darkness and no lights were
on the covered bridge. In consequence
two teams collided and Miss Estell was
thrown out of a" vehicle and bruised.
All the defendants arrested last night
will plead to-morow in the Justice Court.

SECRETARY GAGE'S
ANNUAL REPORT
The Treasury Accounts
Show a Deficit.
RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES
COST OF GOVERNMENT IN THE
WAR YEAR.
Benefits of the New Tariff Just Be
coming Manifest â Workings
of the Chinese Exclu
sion Act.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.â The annual
report of Secretary of the Treasury^
Gage shows that the revenues Of the
Government for the fiscal year ending
June 30 were $494,333,953 75 and the ex
penditures $532,381,201 35, leaving a de
ficit of $38,047,247 60. As compared with
the fiscal year 1897, the receipts for 1898
increased $63,946,785 86, but there was
an increase of $77,594,423 23 in the ordi
nary expenditures.
The revenues of the Government for
the current fiscal year are thus esti
mated at $577,874,647 37, and the expend
itures for the same period are esti
mated at $689,874,647 37, or a deficit of
$112,000,000.
Regarding the working of the tariff,
the report says:
Domestic industrial enterprises are un
questionably benefited by the tariff act
of 1897, designed as well to encourage
home industries as to increase the rev
enues of the Government. By reason of
the fact that importers, anticipating the
passage of the act referred to^ provided
themselves with large stocks of merchan
dise of every description, the tariff of 1897
cannot be regarded as fairly tested by the
receipts immediately following its pass
age. As an illustration of the correctness
of this view it may be stated that during
the first four months of the fiscal year
1899 the receipts from customs (exclusive
of the duty on tea provided by the_ war
revenue law.) amounted to $62,i<6,080,
which is $4,633,026 in excess of the receipts
for a similar period in any year since 1892.
As to immigration, the report says:
The report of the Commissioner General
of Immigration shows that 229,299 immi
grants arrived during the year, a de
crease, compared with the preceding fiscal
year, of 1533. The number of those de
barred and refused landing was 3229, as
compared with 1880 for the preceding year,
and was composed of 417 alien contract
laborers, 2261 paupers, 258 diseased per
sons, 1 idiot, 12 insane, 2 convicts. 79 as
sisted immigrants and who were re
turned within one year after their arrival,
having become public charges. More par
ticular attention has recently been given
to the cases of immigrants suspected of
being affected with disease. During the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1897, only one
immigrant was ..ebarred as being afflicted
with a "loathsome or dangerous contag
ious disease," while during the last year
258 were denied admission on that account.
The report gives some interesting
facts regarding Chinese exclusion, as
follows:
The total number of Chinese persons ad
mitted to the United States in the last
fiscal year was 7195. Of this number 5273
were of the exempt class, principally mer
chants, students, etc.; 425 were so-called
artists, actors, artisans and laborers, ad
mitted for the Trans-Mississippi and In
ternational Exposition at Omaha, and 1497.
were returning registered laborers. There
were also 865 who passed through the
United States under bond in transit to
other countries. Two hundred and eighty
Chinese were refused admission.
It. is believed that many Chinese labor
ers have gained unlawful admission by
representing themselves to have been
born in the United States. In such cases
they present themselves to the customs
officers at the frontier and seek arrest.
On being taken before the United States
Commissioner for deportation proceedings
they are frequently discharged on their
own testimony and that of their alleged
fathers. In many cases such testimony
is believed to have been untrue, and in a
number of instances the applicants or the
alleged fathers, or both, have been suc
cessfully prosecuted for perjury.

NERVOUS DEPRESSION.
[A TALK WITH MRS. PINKHAVI.] V*
A woman with the blues is a very un-
comfortable person. She is illogical,
unhappy and frequently hysterical. .
The condition of the mind known as
" the blues," nearly always, with wo-
men , results from diseased organs of
generation.
It is a source of wonder that in this
age of advanced medical science, any
person should still believe that mere
force of will and determination will
overcome depressed spirits and nerv-
ousness in women. ; These troubles are
indications of disease.
Every woman who doesn't under-
stand her condition should write to
Lynn, Mass., to Mrs. Pinkham for her
advice. Her advice is thorough com-
mon sense, and is the counsel /of a
learned' woman of great experience.
; Read the story of Mrs. F. S. Bennett,
i Westphalia, Kansas, as told in the fol-
lowing letter: -
" Dear Mrs. Pinkham:â l have suf-
fered for over two years with falling,
enlargement and ulceration of the
womb, and this spring, being in such
a weakened condition, caused me to
: flow for nearly six months. ; Some time
â¢ago, urged by friends, I wrote to, you
for advice. After using the treatment
which . you advised for a short time,;
that terrible flow stopped. -
"I am - now gaining strength and
flesh, and have better health than I
have - had for the past ten years. I
wish to say to all distressed, suffer-
ing women, do not suffer longer, when,
there is one so kind and willing to
aid you." i^ â  '

pound is a woman's remedy for wo-

FORCE, THE RAILROAD
ARGUMENT FOR BURNS
Members of the Legislature Resent
the Insulting Tyranny of Mal=
odorous Herrin.
A PHANTOM SACK STUFFED WITH GOLD BRICKS
Rumors of a Resumption of the Unholy Alliance Be=
tween the Examiner and the Southern Pacific.
Frantic Efforts to Boost the Mexi=
can ExÂ°Boss.
Now that William F. Herrin has
been whipped into silence by his more
discreet superiors, the Senatorial candi
dacy of Colonel Dan Burns is being
promoted in the old familiar way by
the railroad company and the off-color
politicians who live by its favor.
Threats and promises are being freely
made, and when these fail recourse is
had to the "sack," the ever potent fac
tor in the important business that has
been placed in the inartistic hands of
untruthful Herrin.
The disclosures that have been made
within the past week concerning the
manner in which the Southern I'aciflc
Company is seeking to steal from the
people of the State the Sen
atorial toga and place 't on the
shoulders of malodorous Coionel Burns
have brought such a storm of protest
from all parts of the State that the
railroad manipulators have beeji forced
to come out into the open and seek to
â win votes by means peculiarly their
own. Where it is necessary to offer
bribes, bribes have been offered; where
threats of political death and business
ruin are of avail, they have not been
withheld; where promises of prefer
ment are potent to cause legislators to
betray their constituents, such prom
ises have been made. Force is the
weapon now being brandished over the
heads of legislators, and if force pre
vails Dan Burns will represent the
State of California in the United States
Senate.
As an illustration of what is being
done in behal%of Burns' candidacy the
threat concerning the organization of
the State Senate may be cited. It has
been given uut by Burns' friends that
his supporters will organize the Senate
and that all members who refuse to de
clare in favor of Burnrf candidacy for
United States Senator will be left out
in the co-Id. That is to say, they will not
be permitted to name any of the at
taches, nor will they be given chair
manships of any of the numerous com
mittees. Also that all bills which they
seek to have passed by the -Legislature
will be smothered.
This threat has not had the desired
effect, as many of the Senators who are
bitterly opposed to Burns' candidacy
declare that if such a programme is
carried out they will Join with the mi
nority if necessary and fight the Burns
combination to the bitter end. Among
those who are of this way of thinking
are many who are personally friendly
to Burns, but who feel that his desire
to become United States Senator is
detrimental to the best interests of the
Republican party and contrary to the
wishes of a great majority of people of
the State. They resent the attempt
that is being made to whip them into
line and will exert every effort to de
feat the end so much desire^, by the
railroad.
"Billy" Hamilton, who is one of the
most active wn-'- ors j n behalf of Burns'
after-dark candidacy, on Monday ap
proached a member of the Senate from
the interior with the remark: "I sup
pose you fellows are going to stand in
all right for Burns for Senator?" The
member replied that he did not think
it necessary to express himself in the
matter, as Colonel Burns had not yet
declared his candidacy, and in an even
inp paper he is quoted as saying that
he did not want the office.
"Oh, that's all right." replied Hamil
ton, "suppose he does declare himself;
how will it be then?"
"My advice is," returned the Senator,
"that if he depends upon the support
of my district for his election he had
better not declare himself."
It so happens that this same Senator
Is personally friendly to Burns. This
is how he views the present situation:
I would assist Burns in any legiti
mate way, because I have always been
his friend. But there is such a thing as
asking too much of a man. I want to
go back to my district after the close of
the session, and if I voted to make
Burns United States Senator I could
not do so. The people do not want him
and will not have him, and I am not
going to ruin myself and betray the
people who elected me by voting for
him."
It may be that there are members of
the Legislature who are not as con
scientious as the gentleman Just
quoted and for these Burns and the
tricky Herrln have another argument.
Even the railroad manipulators con
cede that the use of money will be
necessary to overcome the scruples of
many of the legislators, and plans were
made for the provision of this money
from the funds of the railroad com
pany.
Having in mind past judicial inquiries
as to the manner in which the funds of
the corporation were expended for po
litical purposes, thrifty Herrin and his
co-laborers arranged that the bribe
money necessary should be taken from
the treasury of the corporation and
charged to the "bridges and buildings"
account.
When news of thiÃ arrangement
reached New York there came a pro
test from an official who represents
an interest in the Southern Pacific
Company not always in harmony with
that of the main Interest controlled by
Huntington. The official in question is
no less a persoi. 'nan T. H. Hubbard
first vice president of the company
His protest took the form of a tele
gram to the conspirators In San Fran
cisco in which he conveyed an impera
tive order that the "bridges and
buildings" account should not be held
accountable for funds expended for
political purposes, and also that no
funds should be bo used, as contem
plated, whether charged to "bridges
and buildings" or any other account.
The existence of this telegram may
possibly account for Colonel Burns' de
lay in announcing his candidacy. With
the Hubbard telegram are Borne others
not exactly complimentary to the un
truthful Herrin. As a consequence the
chief of Huntlngton's political bureau
has, within the past few days, been
straining every nerve and pulling every
string In an effort to prove to hlsangry
superiors that he does not deserve the
roasting they have administered to
hi. i and that, thanks to his shrewd
manipulations. Burns' strength is so
great that his election is assured. This
accounts for the activity of the rail
road lickspittles and the personal sup
porters of Burns, as well as for the
reticence of the colonel himself after
the awkward blunder made by Herrin
in announcing Burns' candidacy on be
half of the Southern Pacific Company.
The Senatorial situation as it now
presents itself is causing much appre
hension in the Democratic camp on ac
count of the attitude of the Examiner.
Since the rupture of the private rela
tftons between that paper and the
Southern Pacific Compan- the Ex
aminer has posed as the champion of
the people and the enemy of the great
corporation headed by Collis P. Hunt
ington. Now that Mr.. Hearst's organ
has come out as the champion of the
candidacy of Colonel Burns and the
mouthpiece of the iniquitous Herrin,
the Democrats are all at sea and the
Republicans are giving ear to tales
concerning an underground passage
from the yellow building to Mr.
Hearst's headquarters at the corner of
Third and Market streets.
Herrin himself has added an element
erf mystery to the situation by flaunt
ing what he is pleased to call the "Ex
aminer's scalp," which he claims to
have taken at the late election. Irre
sponsible people who Moat about on the
outskirts of the political whirlpool are
amusing themselves by telling sober
tales of a renewal of the secret com
pact between the railroad and the Ex
aminer. These same misguided individ
uals, who are not in a position to know
the facts, but who wish to get credit for
knowledge they do not posses, point
out, in eoiToboration of their weird
tale, the fact that the Examiner has
abandoned its hostility to the corpora
tion and has Indorsed the candidacy of
Colonel Burns, who is avowedly the
railroads choice for United States
Senator. The contract, they say, cov
ers "two sessions of the Legislature
and one general election." During this
period the corporation is to "enjoy im
munity from hostile attack" on the
part of the paper.
They even g<* so far as to declare that
the $8000 still due and unpaid on ac
count of a former contract of a similar
nature, is to be paid by the railroad
without prejudice to the stipulations of
the present agreement, and that it is
wholly a secret agreement and is
not hedged about by the pretense of an
advertising contract as was the case in
the former contract.
It is, of course, incredible in view of
what has gone before it in the history
of the railroad company that there was
any necessity for entering Into a secret
agreement to purchase the Examiner's
silence and good will. The only
plausible explanation of the wild
story is that the railroad people, know
ing that the act of putting Burns for
ward as the railroad's candidate for
Senator would have the immediate
effect of antagonizing every reputable
newspaper in the State, deemed it ad
visable to procure the support of the
Examiner and thus be in a position to
ward off the attacks that were fore
seen. Whichever way the truth lies, it
is certain that the Examiner now occu
pies the enviable position of being the
mouthpiece of Colonel Burns and the
untruthful Herrin.
Perhaps the most regrettable fea
ture of the situation as it stands to
day is the attempt made yesterday by
an afternoon paper, presumably at the
instigation of the unspeakable Herrin.
to drag the name of an estimable and
philanthropic lady into the muck in
which the railroad's political agents
are wallowing. The cowardly attack
will, of course, be without effect, but it
serves to show to what ends the pro
moters of Burns' candidacy will go in
order to influence the public mind.
Members of the Legislature who re
side in the interior and who come to
San Francisco are being subjected to
every conceivable blackmailing scheme
in an endeavor to secure their support
for Burns. An instance in point is that
of a member of the Assembly who
came to the city two days ago for the
purpose of doing what he could to se
cure for a personal friend a position on
the police force.
He went to a member of the Board of
Police Commissioners and preferred his
request and was astonished when the
honorable Commissioner named as the
price of his favor the con
dition that the Assemblyman
should vote for Burns for Senator.
The Assemblyman, to his credit be it
said, put an abrupt end to the nego
tiations by declaring that under no con
sideration would he ever consent to cast
his vote for Burns. Needless to say
the Assemblyman's friend will not ob
tain the desired position in the ranks
of San Francisco's finest.

Meeting of the State Central Commit
tee Adjourns for Lack of a
Quorumâ Candidates for
Empty Honors.
Seven members of the Democratic
State Central Committee responded to the
call for a meeting yesterday at the Cali
fornia Hotel. They were: Governor
Budd, Mayor Phelan. M. F. Tarpey,
Charles Fay, W. F. Alford, J. C. Mc-
Kinstry and Chairman Seth Mann.
The ostensible object of the meeting
was to select somebody to receive the
complimentary vote of the minority for
United States Senator, and to provide
ways and means to meet a deficit of $3800,
but, like many gatherings of a similar
nature, it also had a secret meaning, of
which but a few were aware.
This set ret purpose, if it may be so
termed, was to promote the wish of Wil
liam K. Hearst, proprietor of the Ex
aminer, to place the control of the Demo
cratic party of the city and State in the
hands ot" M. F. Tarpey. Mr. Hearst's
proposal, as has been outlined to some of
the leaders of the party, is that if Mr.
Tarpey be given the, chairmanship of the
Democratic State Central Committee and
be permitted to reorganize the State and
local Democracy on lines of his own, he
(Hearst; will assume the indebtedness of
the State organization, which at the pres
ent time amounts to $3M*), and will also I
lend the support of the Examiner to pro- j
mote the interests of the party as a j
whole.
This proposition has been made to sev- I
eral leading Democrats during the past
few days by Mr. Tarpey, who claimed to
act as the mouthpiece of Mr. Hearst.
That the scheme has not met with a fa- I
vorable reception is not due to a lack of <
appreciation of the fact that it will be \
necessary to reorganize the party. Local
leaders still retain a vivid recollection of j
the success which attended the organiza- !
tion of the malodorous and discredited i
Committee of One HunÃred, as well as
the highly satisfactory and wholly cred
itable reform measures of Gavin McNab,
sometimes known as the "Whispering
Boss."
Local Democrats also remember that
Mr. Hearst undertook to reorganize the
New York State Democracy. The suc
cess attending his efforts in that direction
is a matter of history to which reference i
is made only in whispers. Then, too, the |
part the Examiner is playing in the ,
present Senatorial campaign as regards
the interests of the Southern Pacific Com
pany and its candidate for the position,
has become a subject of grave suspicion
in the minds of many Democrats who i
have the interest of their party at heart
The spectacle of the Democratic party
of this State reorganized on the basis of
free silver, free beer and free everythingâ
"not only hoisted, but nailed"â would no
doubt be an edifying spectable, but it is
a dream that falls just short of realiza
tion.
However, owing to the fact there was
no quorum present ho definite action was
taken on any of the propositions, though
the members locked themselves in a room
and informally discussed them all
One of those present inquired of the
chairman whether the complimentary
vote for Senator would be presented to
Stephen M. White, and as Chairman Mann
could not enlighten him and the other
members would not the matter was !
dropped. A few smiles greeted the in
quiry, as three of, those present have a '
longing for the compliment. M. F Tar- i
pey intends going to Mexico soon and
would not mind delaying his trip if he '
could be assured that he would receive I
it. Mayor Phelan is not adverse to the '
compliment, because it might aid him in I
obtaining the coveted title at a future !
date. Governor Budd has labored hard ;
for his party and therefore feels it would
be no more that right to present him with
the vote.
This question, as well as the others will I
be brought up again when next the com
mittee meets. A meeting is scheduled for
a week from to-day.

UTTERS A WARNING SPEECH
SAYS FORBEARANCE SOON MAY
CEASE.
Provocative Words of Sir Edmund
J. Monson at a British Chamber
of Commerce Banquet in
Paris.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Dec. 6.â At the silver jubilee
banquet of the British Chamber of
Commerce here this evening, the Em
bassador, Sir Edmund J. Monson, re
ferring to the "new diplomacy" which
is said to have come into fashion dur
ing the past year, said it was chiefly
due to the enterprise of the press, but
also it was in a measure due to mother
country Innovations and to the origin
ality of the American mmd â ever rest
lessly watching to improve everything â
which would perhaps end by wiping
the diplomats of the old school off the
face of the earth.
Sir Edmund Monson then proceeded
to dilate on the recent remarkable out
burst of public feeling in Great Britain,
provoked by the Fashoda incident, and
said he ventured to express the hope
that the idea of Great Britain being un
duly squeezable and prone to make
graceful but impolitic concessions was
thoroughly exploded.
He appealed to France to disabuse
herself of all suspicion of unfair inten
tion upon the part of Great Britain; to
try to believe there was no general
animosity in England toward France,
and to meet England on every ques
tion at issue with an honest desire for
an equitable arrangement. He con
cluded as follows:
"I would earnestly ask officials in
power and unofficial exponents of pub
lic opinion to discountenance and ab
stain from a continuance of the policy
of pin-pricks, which, while It can only
procure an ephemeral satisfaction to
a short-lived Ministry, must inevitably
perpetuate across the channel an in
tolerable irritation.
"I would entreat them to resist the
temptation to thwart British enter
prise by petty maneuvers such as the
proposal to start colleges as rivals of
General Kitchener's â ojected institu
tion in the reconquered Soudan. Such
ill-considered provocation might have
the effect of converting Great Britain's
policy of forbearance in Egypt into the
adoption of measures at which I pre
sume French sentiment is not aiming."
LONDON. Dec. 7.â Sir Edmund Mon
son's remarkable speech in Paris last
evening has created a sensation here.
Most of the newspapers regard it as
an unfortunate indiscretion, pointing
out that the American Embassadors
he referred to, despite their leanings
to the new diplomacy, would never
have addressed such a warning to
Great Britain.
There Is little doubt that the speech
will be deeply resented In France,
especially as it was evidently carefully
prepared and was read in the delivery.
COURSING PARK CHANGES.
Mrs. Dalton and M. J. Donovan Have
Sold Their Interests to the
Ingleside Club.
The directors 01 the Ingleside Coursing
Club held a very Important meeting last
evening in Pythian Hall, the object of
which was to settle up accounts with Mrs.
John Dalton and M. J. Donovan.
The club Incorporated on Monday last
under the name of the Ingleside Coursing
Association, and mmediately after a
committee composed of D. Shannon, H.
Deckelman, William Halpln. D. Dillon,
William Thompson, W. Elmore and
Charles Morris interviewed Mrs. Dalton
and M. J. Donovan, with the object in
view of purchasing their Interests in the
Ingleside Coursing Park. Mrs. Dalton
was pleased to relinquish her half inter
est In the park, and her case was quickly
disposed of by paying her In cash the sum
of $4000.
Donovan was not such an easy game to
handle and he fought to a finish, but final
ly disposed of one-quarter of his inter
est with the understanding that the re
maining quarter interest may be pur
chased by the club when It is prepared to
square up final accounts.
Neither Donovan nor Mrs. Dalton, In ac
cordance with the agreement entered into
last evening, shall in future have any
voice in the management of the park af
fairs. The directors of the park are now
composed of D. Shannon, William Halpin,
D. Dillon, H. Deckelman and W. Elmore.
Three hundred shares of stock which
were issued yesterday were quickly pur
chased by members. In fact, there is not
a share left for purchase. In the near fu
ture there will be many improvements
made in the park, such as an alteration of
the grand stand and a first class picnic
ground where ladies and gentlemen can
enjoy pleasant outings.
On Sunday the club will give an open
stake, which has already been filled, the
entrance being $2 50, with $600 added. The
drawing will be held on Thursday even-
Ing.
John Grace, the popular judge, under in
vitation from Mr. Black of the Los An-"
geles Coursing Club, will judge the grand
Christmas day open meeting which will
be held In the Los Angeles Coursing Park.
WILL NOT BE REBUILT.
There is a general belief among those
who take an Interest In the matter that
a new theater will be constructed to take
the place of the Baldwin, either on the
old site or elsewhere. J. J. Qottlob Is
authority for the declaration that there Is
no new theater coming.
"I am sorry to have to deny these ru
mors," said Mr. Gottlob. last evening,
"but you can say for me that all these
stories about the proposed construction
of a new theater are 'in the air.'
"Mr. Baldwin has assured me that in
the event he rebuilds the Baldwin Hotel
there will be no theater or opera house j
embodied In it and there is no one else
looking for such an investment. Of course.
If one of the old houses should be de
stroyed there would be a field for a new
one. I am confident It will be a long time
before the people of San Francisco will
secure a new and flr6t-class playhouse.

Prestige.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BERLIN, Dec. 6.â Emperor William
opened the Reichstag in the White
Hall of the Royal Castle here to-day, in
the presence of the members of the
Bundesrath, the generals and other
military officers, who were grouped
around the throne, In front of which
the Reichstag Deputies assembled. The
Empress sat in the grand balcony, and
the members of the diplomatic corps
occupied the adjoining gallery.
His Majesty, who arrived at noon,
was accompanied by his sons and by
the Persian Prince Mirza. After the
Centrist leader, Lingens, called for
cheers for his Majesty, the imperial
Chancellor, Prince Hohenlohe. handed
the speech to the Emperor, who read it
in a loud voice.
One of the first bills mentioned was
an anti-strike measure, providing for
the punishment of those who Intimidate
non-strikers, but not interfering with
the workmen's right of coalition.
The Emperor said that Germany's re
lations with all the foreign powers con
tinued friendly and the principal object
of his policy would be to contribute to
the maintenance of peace. Therefore
his Majesty hailed with warm approval
the Czar's magnanimous proposal for
the furtherance of that object.
Continuing, the Emperor referred to
the assassination of the Empress of
Austria as a savage and ruthless act
which had caused him deep pain and
which had evoked the most sincere
sympathy throughout Germany.
Alluding to the war between Spain
and the United States, his Majesty said
Germany's neutrality was conscienti
ously and loyally observed toward
both belligerents. Then, taking up
colonial affairs, Emperor William
pointed out the measures taken for the
economic development of Kiaochau,
declaring that, while conscientiously
respecting the well-acquired rights of
third parties, the German Government
would direct its efforts to the further
promotion of its economic relations
with China, which are yearly growing
more complete.
There was a special passage devoted
to the inspection of meat, on which
subject his Majesty said:
"In order to avert the dangers in
volved in the traffic of unexaminedmeat
intended for human beings whether of
home or foreign origin, the question of
the general introduction of a system
of inspection for slaughter houses and
meat is being considered. The federal
government's bill regulating the sub
ject will.' l hope, occupy your attention
during the nresent session."
Emperor William concluded by say
ing that it was with deep emotion that
he had visited, with the Empress, the
spots rendered dear to the whole of
Christendom by the sufferings of the
Savior, adding:
"The anxious desire of my predeces
sors on the throne of Prussia was to
erect there a place of worship of the
evangelical confession. That it was
granted to me to fulfill this desire and
hand over the Redeemer's Church at
Jerusalem to the Chief Lord is a fresh
incentive to me to further employ the
power vested in me by the grace of God

Mr. Wilson : I knew an Ohio farmer nameu Enochs. He
was about fifty years old and was bothered for years with some
trouble the doctors didn't understand. He told me the story
himself. "I kept getting weaker," said he, "and fairly got so
weak my food done me no good, what little I did cat, and I
went from 135 pounds down to 98." It was the druggist who
suggested that he try Ripans Tabules, and he .says that he had
not used a dozen of them before he felt much better, and after
a month he was cured sound and well, and In less than a ycaf

IN THE HALL
OF JUSTICE
Contractors Say That Under Favorable Conditions They
Expect to Finish the Noted Structure Within
the Next Ninety Days.
Others Declare It Will Take Another Yearâ Anxiety as to
Whether the Legislature Will Provide in Advance for the
Famishing of the Building.
The completion of the Hall of Justice,
which has been so long and exasperating
ly postponed, concerns the general public,
and is of particular moment to the resi
dents of the north side. There have been
delays of all kinds, and the people, after
filing numberless protests and petitions,
have concluded that this municipal enter
prise is on a par with the infamous con
struction of the new City Hall, which
stands to-day as an architectural monu
ment to colossal jobbery.
However, it is said that all things come
to the individual who is willing: to wait,
and it now appears that the more or less
patient Northenders are to be rewarded
with the realization of their desires.
It is announced by the contractors, who
have persistently asked for all kinds of
further time within which to complete
their labors, that while they were losing
money on the contract, they would have
the great structure ready for occupancy
within ninety days. Here is where the
complications come in. and there are pos
sibilities that this pet building of the me
tropolis may not be officially occupied for
the next two and a half years.
To the casual observer it appears that
the structure has been well built, with
the possible exception of the experimental
wire lathing, which is being usefi in the
place of standard devices to hold the plas
i;d at the same time be fire proof.
It may be found that some other ma
terial is required, in which event there
would be considerable delay in the com
pletion of the building.
When the contractors shall have fin
ished their work it must be submitted to
the incoming Board of Supervisors for
acceptance. Discounting all possible de
lays, this proffer of the building, accord
ing to the ideas of the contractors, could
not occur before the early part of March,
and there are reasonable doubts as to the
possibility of completing it by that time.
The upper stories and tower have only the
iron framework to show, and at present
there are no indications that the roof will
b( put in place at an early date. Should
this particular work be delayed until the
* rpected heavy winter rains come it
would delay the completion of the in
BOARD OF EDUCATION
SCORED BY THE COURT
KATHERINE BALL EEINSTATED
IN HER POSITION.
In Abolishing- Her Office the Appoint
ing Body Exceeded Its
Powers.
Judge Belcher yesterday handed down
an opinion directing that a writ of man
date issue against the Board of Educa
tion compelling that body to reinstate
MiM Katharine M. Ball to the position of
special teacher of drawing in the School
Department.
Miss Ball served in the capacity of spe
cial teacher of drawing for three years,
and her salary was authorised by the
Board of Education. Subsequently the
position was abolished, and she brought
Buit for reinstatement. Judge Belcher, in
the opinion, decided that the board had
no summary power of removal and that
it> attempt to use it was illegal. In con
cluding his opinion, Judge Belcher scores
the hoard, insisting that abolition of the
office was simply a pretext to get rid of
the u-achcr. The concluding paragraph
of the opinion, which gives Judge Bel
cher's views upon this point, is as follows:
In attempting to remove the petitioner from
h<>r imÂ«ition in the department no charges
â ufrp brought against her, and. as heretofore
etat.-d, neither then nor subsequently was she
crlticizable upon any of the grounds men
tioned in section 1792, Politcal Code, concern-
ing removals or disqualifications, or in any
way unfltttd to discharge her duties. There
â¢was merely a bald attempt to oust her lrom
her position â apparently for no other purpose
than to make room for another appointment
or appointments. Of coarse, it cannot sue-
The Hoard of Education is not invested
â¢with any arbitrary and autocratic powers such
as it has attempted to exercise. Unfortunately
the exercise of such powers has been attempted
many times in this city, and it would not be
Btrange if the teachers would come to believe
they are without protection save from the
courts.

A serious question has arisen within the
last two days as to the furnishing of the
hall. The Supervisors have been strug
gling with the matter for some time and
making desperate efforts to enter into
contracts for its performance. To this
end they allowed $85,000, and now have
bids in hand for the delivery of the goods.
However, Auditor Broderick has shied his
beaver into the ring announcing that the
city and county has no authority to ex
pend money for such a purposeâ that it
must first be empowered by the Legisla
ture to do so, and that contractors will be
proceeding at their own risk if they enter
into an engagement with the Board of
Supervisors.
The feature of the situation that is now
creating particular anxiety, especially
among the Northenders, is the probable
attitude of the next Legislature. It will
devolve upon that body to see that the
equipment of the big building is provided
for, and it is presumed that if the proper
showing is made by rejpresentative citi
zens the required bill â will be passed. But
if the completion of the hall continues to
lag as in the past the Solons may refuse
to act favorably. In which event the fa
mous Hall of Justice would not be avail
able for public use until some time in
1902.
This is a prospect that will arouse prop
erty-ffwners in that district to the reali
zation of the fact that it is necessary to
do some effective work immediately.
Another aspect of the conditioos is the
declaration of those alleged to be compe
tent judges that the building will not be
entirely out of the hands of the contrac
tors until the latteV part of 1900. They
present convincing arguments to back
their assertions, but the men who are
erecting the structure are making ninety
day promises
In the case of prolonged delay in con
struction it is a grave question as to
whether or not the Legislature will pro
vide for the furnishing of the building be
fore its completion. If they fail to do so
a wail will arise from the North side that
will be heard even in Sacramento. It is
stated that a committee will be appoint
ed by the residents of that section to at
tend the Legislature and urge prompt
and favorable action upon all matters af
fecting the early completion of the Hall
of Justice.

DRINKS A DEADLY POTION,
THEN CALMLY WAITS THE END
Mrs. M. Wittmeier, Widow of "Bottle" Meier, Concert-Hall Keeper,
Takes Her Life Apparently Without Cause.
MRS. Magdalena Wittmeier, widow
of "Bottle" Meier, was found dead
in her bed by her servants â "â¢ester
day mornin- Beside her was a
phial of strychnine, while a wine
glass half full of water also con
tained crystals of the same poison. For
a time the police thought she had been
the victim of foul play as all her money
was missing. After a more thorough
search this was found hidden away in an
old valise.
The dead woman is known to seafaring
men the world over. For nearly thirty
years she has conducted a music hall, of
which the men who ".o down to the sea
in ships have been the principal patrons.
McGLADE WENT
SADLY BACK TO
THE TANKS
Could Not Secure Suf
ficient Bonds.
Peter W. McGlade, the defaulting book
keeper in the Street Superintendent's of
fice, appeared in Judge Joachimsen's
court yesterday and was greeted by a
large number of friends who had gath
ered in the courtroom. He was kept
shaking hands for some time and looked
pleased and confident.
The case was called and by consent was
continued until Friday. Attorney Metson,
who appeared for the defendant, asked
that the bonds of $10,000 be reduced to
$5000, and the Judge said he would consult
the Chief of Police and give his decision
later, as he understood other charges
were to be preferred against the defend-
ant.
During the afternoon McGlade's friends
thinking the bonds had been reduced got
John C. Peterson. 719 Liberty street, and
H. S. Dlmond of Williams. Dimond & Co.
to become his sureties and the bond was
accepted by Judge Conlan on the under
standing that it had been reduced. Chief
Lees declined to release the defendant un
less on $10,000 bonds, and when Judge
Joachimsen was notified he agreed with
the Chief.
"I do not know what action will be
taken in the matter of investigating the
operations of Peter McGlade," saiu Super
intendent of Streets Ambrose last night,
when asn.ed if the search would go beyond
the August accounts. "Whoever did this
crooked work did not manipulate my
books. They are entirely straight, and if
there has been any other stealing of the
kind it can be very easily discovered by
'comparing the pay roll with the accounts
in the Auditor's office, and my books are
open to investigation.
"I must confess that I do not know how
the job could be carried through success
fully. In the first place the voucher had
to""be made out in the name of the ficti
tious laborer and should be sworn to by
the claimant before the clerk of tne Board
of Supervisors. It then had to be signed
by the Street Committee. From there it
would go to the Finance Committee and
receive their signatures. Then it would
come back to me for certification and
from my office it would go to the Auditor
for his signature. These bogus claims
never came before me. If they had I
would have readily detected them. They
were stamped with my signature and
signed 'Peter McGlade, deputy.'
"This might have gone on indefinitely if
lt had not been discovered that some one
had been swindling salary brokers to the
extent of hundreds of dollars, the opera
tions dating since last May. As soon as I
discovered these things I notified the
Mayor that the city was being defrauded
and also informed his Honor that my
bookkeeper was missing. The exposure
followed.
"McGlade, if he is the culprit, had no
excuse whatever for his conduct. He had
a good position under me and was well
treated. Furthermore he was so popular
and capable that he could always have
procured a desirable job in Borne one of
the municipal offices. I have no idea as to
what may develop further in this case. I
do know, however, t-.at I have not been
to see Mr. McGlade and do not want to
see him or have anything to do with him.
My sympathy goes to his innocent wife.
Whether or not McGlado had anything to
do with the operations of Cardova i have
no knowledge."
It is said that those responsible for the
safety of the city's funds suspect that
this clever bunko work has been going on
for a long time, and that they will take
measures to thoroughly investigate the
matter. All that is necessary is to com
pare the Auditor's books with those of the
Street Department to ascertain the ex
tent of the Bteal.
McGlade confidently expected to be re
leased on bail, but when it came to the
"show down" he could not furnish the re
quired $10,000 bonds and had to return to
the tanks for the night.

Her husband was the first man in Cali
fornia to place beer in bottles, hence his
sobriquet of "Bottle"Meier, by which
he was better known than by his own
name of "Wittmeier.
He amassed a fortune at the business
of bottling beer and died four years ago
with an estate appraised at $25,000. It
consisted of a ranch in Santa Clara Coun
ty; the property, 513 Pacific street, where
the concert hall is conducted and where
the woman died; a house and lot on
Stockton street, near Jackson, and flats
on Baker street, between Fulton and
Grove. At his death there were certain
incumbrances, and to remove these the
widow mortgaged the Pacific street prop
erty for $6000. The property was all left
to the widow, but she had' to defend her
right to it as a son of the dead man, issue
of a former marriage, contested the will.
The court gave the widow all.
The police can find no cause for the
woman taking her life. The nearest ap-
ELECTED A VETERAN
FOR THEIR COMMANDER
Edward A. Bullis, Who Is Now the Head of George H Thomas
Post, 6. A. R., Served in the Rebellion.
GEORGE H. THOMAS POST, G. A. R., met last evening in Ruby Hall and
elected officers for the ensuing year and also fifteen delegates to the Depart
ment Encampment to be held next spring at San Diego. The election of offi
cers resulted aa follows: Post commander, Edward A. Bullis; senior vice
commander, A. Mautner; junior vice commander, Eugene Wiegand ; quartermaster,
C. H. Blinn; surgeon, George Hardcastle; chaplain, William Royal; officer of the
day. P. Welch; officer of the guard, W. E. B. Bartholow; trusteesâ W. R. Parnell,
C E. Wilson and Philip I. Fisher. Beyond the election of the officers and delegates
there was no other business transacted by the post.
Edward A. Bullis, the newly elected commander, was born in Fort Coving
ton, N. V., and when 17 years old he enlisted as a private, in 1861, in the Ninety
eighth Regiment, New York Volunteer Infantry, which joined the Army of the
Potomac under the command of General George B. McClellan at the beginning
of the siege of Yorktown in the spring of .1562.
The regiment was assigned to Naglees brigade. Keyes' Fourth Army Corps.
After the capture of Yorktown the regiment participated in the battle of Wll
llamsburg, and later was in the extreme advance, following the enemy under the
command of the Confederate general, Joseph E. Johnston, up the peninsula. The
regiment, being in Casey's division, bore the brunt of the enemy's savage attack
at the battle of Fair Oaks, and lost everything except what the men had on their
backs when they went into the fight, the division being driven back across the
Chickahominy and its camps captured by the enemy. Eight thousand men on
either side were lost in the engagement. The Ninety-eighth sustained heavy
loss in the seven days' battles terminating with Malvern Hill. During this series
of engagements the Federal losses footed up 33.000 men, and the total loss to the
Union army during the disastrous peninsula campaign was 74,000 men.
In December, 1862, the regiment -was detached from the Army of the Potomac
and assigned to an expedition which sailed from Fortress Monroe under command
of General Foster to capture Charleston, S. C. The fleet was scattered by a
heavy gale off Cape Hatteras. in which Ericsson's Monitor foundered and sank
Later the attack on Charleston by the Union fleet was repulsed, eight monitors
being disabled in forty minutes by the Confederates' terrific cannonade. The
regiment was then sent to North Carolina and assigned the duty of guarding the
railroad in the extensive swamps between Morehead City and Newbern. By this
time the Ninety-eighth was reduced by death and disease from its original 1000
men to less than 400, and was consolidated into a battalion. In this unhealthy
location young Bullis was stricken with malarial fever, which necessitated his
discharge from the army.
He arrived In this city In 1864, where he has since resided. After the death
of the late Nathaniel Hunter In 1893 Mr. Bullis was appointed by the Board of
Supervisors to succeed him as Superintendent of Interment of ex-Union Soldiers,
which position he still holds.

was on the bond of M. Garten in the sum
of $1000, and the prisoner failed to answer
to his name when his case was called on
Monday morning. The bonds were de
clared forfeited and proceedings were to
be commenced to collect. Garten
is charged with having embezzled dia

The body of decedent was found by
Fred Jacobsen. an attache of the concert

and summoned Jacobsen. He went to her
room and found her dead. She had ap
parently retired, taken the deadly po

calmly awaited death. Her only known
relative is a brother, who resides on the
Santa Clara ranch. He was notified im

RIVALED THE
FROG, HOT THE
NIGHTINGALE
Di Franchi Thought
He Could Sing.
The trouble between Antonio Rosso and
Francisco di Franchi, which resulted in
the murder of the one by the other last
Sunday night, was found yesterday to
have been occasioned by a wager Franchi
had made with a saloon-keeper that he
could sing better than the dispenser of
liquid refreshments. Rosso was the judge
in the test of the respective vocal abili
ties of the two men, and deciding against
Franchi incurred that gentleman's dis
pleasure. A quarrel followed, and in self
defense Rosso shot the loser. of the bet.
Rosso, who until recently had been
â working in this city, but for the past
month had been employed in the mines
at Black Diamond, returned to San Fran
cisco Sunday. In the evening, at the sa
loon of Giacomo Verdugi, 324 Broadway,
he met Franchi. Over their cups Ver
dugi and Franchi both claimed to be sing
ers, and each thought that his voice was
better than that of the other. A wager
of a dollar a side was made, and Rosso
was chosen as stakeholder and Judge.
Each of the contestants rendered his best
selection in his best manner, and after
careful consideration Rosso awarded the
decision to the saloon-keeper.
The contest being decided, a question
arose as to what should be done with the
stakes. An agreement was finally made
that Verdugi's dollar should be returned
to him and that of Franchi spent for
liquor. When 70 cents had gone over the
bar and its value in drinks had been
passed back and had been consumed all
had as much "thirst poison" as was
wanted. Rosso offered the remaining 30
cents to Franchi, who refused it, and ag
gressively demanded what right Rosso
had to spend his money. An explanation
was made to him, but he was not satis
fied, and left the saloon with the threat
that Rosso would not sleep in bed that
night. Rosso staid in the saloon a short
time, and when he went out into the
street he was accosted by Franchi, and
the quarrel began anew. Franchi drew a
gun, and, according to Rosso, fired it
Thinking himself about to be murdered.
Rosso brought his pistol into action and
fired three times at Franchi, killing him
instantly.
Franchi has had a bad reputation for
some time, and was formerly connected
with the Mafia in New Orleans. About ten
years ago he was in San Francisco and
served a term of six months in the Coun
ty Jail. While eating in a restaurant a
woman who knew him entered the place
and as a joke took some shrimps from a
plate in front of him. HÂ« assaulted her,
and a gentleman who saw the disturb
ance interfered. Franchi drew a revolv
er, but was disarmed. Later he was ar
rested and convicted of assault. Soon
after his release from jail he went to j
New Orleans and was connected with the
Mafia during the trouble there. He was
deputized by the Mafia to kill Domenico
Pari, a barber who had offended the or- |
der. He followed Pari to Boston, from i
there to Chicago, and from there to San
Francisco. Pari left this city and Fran- I
chi also disappeared. While he was away
from hero he had trouble at various
places, among others at Denver, from
which city he was driven by the police.
The first of the present year Pari, who is
godfather of a daughter of Dr. Galeoto,
residing at 423 Montgomery avenue, re
turned to San Francisco to visit his
friends. Last July he learned that
Franchi was still on his trail, so he left
for Chicago. Franchi came back to the
city two months later. Par' intended to
come to San Francisco for the Christmas
holidays, and the death of Franchi will
probably render the carrying out of this
intention more certain.
Franchi has been regarded as a bad
man, but was thought to be a good deal
of a bluffer. In New Orleans he had
trouble with a man named Angelo Fer
rant and drew a gun on him. Ferrant
knocked the pistol from his hands, bit a
piece out of his nose and shot him in the
leg. The scars on the nose and leg were
found on the body as it lay in the Morgue
Three weeks ago in the saloon of Sal
vador Smario, 424 Broadway, Franchi
drew a revolver on a man during a quar
rel, but the saloon-keeper took it away
before he could do any damage. Franchi
was ordered away from the place and
told not to return. He came back, how
ever, about a week ago, and in a quarrel
over a game of cards he again made a
show of a pistol and was disarmed. Tb-*
night he was shot ne again returned <o
Smario'e saloon and was ejected on ac
count of bis quarrelsome disposition.

FIREPROOF BUILDINGS.
THE recent fire which attacked some of the high
est buildings in New York City demonstrated
the utility of the fireproof method of construc
tion. The ordinary layman, with but cursory knowl
edge oi architecture, is of course unable to discuss
this matter in more than general terms. Anybody
can realize, however, that what would in other days
have been a frightful conflagration, resulted only in
the loss of half a million dollars, a large part of this
embraced in the destruction of an old building, in
construction of which modern methods oi fireproof
ing had not been employed.
The term "fireproof" is relative. There is no sub
stance which may utterly defy the action of heat.
Science holds the theory that in the untold future the
earth itself may be dissolved by the heat generated j
through contact with some other planet. Architects j
have done much, however, to baffle the flames. Imag- .
me an edifice twenty or more stories in height catch- j
ing fire so high up as to be almost out of reach of j
the strongest streams the engines can throw, a gale !
blowing at sixty miles an hour, and yet the fire j
beaten back with only a trifling loss. The circum
tance is a tribute to the genius of designer and crafts- j
man.
When wooden or inflammable buildings catch fire
a great danger arises from the flying particles. A
shower of blazing shingles may carry ignition to a
distant point. In the fireproof building there is noth
ing light to fly. Metal, brick and stone make up the
substance, and while flames may cause it to disinte
grate or melt, to do so they would have to be applied
directly and for a long time. In fact, the peril has
been so modified that with the general introduction of
fireproof structures it would disappear.
The lesson should not be lost on San Francisco.
We have had our Baldwin, and to-day the dead are
dug from its blackened ruins. Yet there are others
now being put up which, at least to the untrained
eye, have all the seeming of a Baldwin flimsiness.
A QUESTION OF HEROISM.
THE widow of the late train-robber, Beam, he who
went hence laden with buckshot, does not ap
pear to be of the hysterical sort. Her emotions
are not expressed to the accompaniment of tears.
In fact, the widow, while she does not say so, is sen
sible enough to be glad. She does not regard the
deceased as having been a hero, although surprised at
his exhibition of nerve. "A man who beats hi 9
wife," she says calmly, "is mean enough to do any
thing," and doubtless she is right. Such a man ought
to be buck shot whether o: not he ventured into
bolder crime. The widow stands ready to identify
the bandit's pistol, because she had once been struck
on the head with it and acquired a vivid and lasting
impression of its aspect.
There is manifest now and then a tendency to
look upon the train-robber as brave and dashing.
When the fact is considered that he may be a vulgar
wife-beater, and, if so, certainly a coward, the dime
rovel glamour departs. Outside of Missouri the
train-robber never achieved personal popularity. In
California he is distinctly persona non grata, and
when he is killed we applaud. There might be a
passing impulse to give him credit for courage, and
to fancy that desperation had driven him to wicked
ness, but learning that he was wont to beat his wife,
Was a lazy loafer and a gambler of the variety known
as "tin horn," we readily dismiss the prompting of
charity. The train-robber is not a hero, and the con
ditions under which an Indian is good apply to him
also.
THE ZANTE CURRENT.
THE tariff on Zante currants is the tariff on
raisins, no matter what duty is put on Valencias

The President's recommendation that Zante cur
rants be made free will alarm the raisin-growers of
California, who know well the effect of free currants
en their prosperity. . '.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1898.
THE PERILS OF VICTORY.
AT the meeting of the New York State Bar Asso
ciation in 1896 were delivered two addresses of
remarkable power, and each had a distinct
bearing upon the situation which develops at the close
of our Spanish war. One of these addresses was by
Chauncey M. Depew, on "Patriotism and Jingoism."
It was intended as a criticism of President Cleveland's
Venezuelan message, but in it was a vein of profound
philosophy. Sketching the downfall of Roman lib
erty he said:
"A craze for conquest had created armies, wonder
ful victories had made famous generals, and triumphal
processions had inflamed and intoxicated the people.
Cicero saw what no other statesman of
his period did, that beside the captive
chained to the chariot of the conqueror as it
proudly rolled along the Appian way with the acclaim
of the multitude stalked also in chains the figure of
Roman liberty. * * * When Cicero's throat was
cut upon the highway by the soldiers of Antony, the
body of the Roman law, which protected life and
property, and judicially decided rights and remedied
wrongs, and which had been five hundred years in
slow and laborious construction, was buried with his
blood. * * * The falling temple of liberty car
ried down in its ruins civilization, law, learning, art,
humanity and religion."
Mr. Depew continued with an argument for the ar
bitration of all international disputes and differences,
to the end that war might be averted and the sleep
ing tiger in the breasts of men might not be roused
by a lust of conquest and the glitter of arms. Describ
ing our relations to surrounding countries, he said:
"To the south of us is Mexico, with only twelve mil
lions of people, of whom ten millions are Indians,
uneducated and degraded. We need fear nothing from
Mexico, nor do we want her. That population incor
porated into our political system would corrupt our
suffrage. The Presidency of the United States and
the political control of the republic might be decided
by the Indians of Mexico."
It does not destroy the strength of his protest,
against militarism and imperialism that Depew has
changed and is now an expansionist of high degree. It
rather enforces his classic analogy from the history
of Rome. Cicero, overawed by the steady advance of
Caesar's power, abated his high opposition to im
perialism, though his death was brought about by
Antony's lack of faith in the sincerity of his abandon
ment of former opinions. â¢
The other address at the same meeting was deliv
ered by Hon. Moorfield Storey, president of the
American Bar Association. He expressed the satis
faction with which he had listened to Mr. Depew,
and said:
"I fear for our country a successful war more than
any other calamity. We can survive defeat, but it will
be very difficult to preserve our institutions against
victory. The triumph of Rome in the second Punic
war paved the way for the downfall of the Roman re
public. We must be certain that we are different from
every other nation before we expose ourselves reck
lessly to the evil influences which they have failed to
resist. * * * It is at least clear that we do not
want one foot of foreign territory. There is no neigh
boring people that are so clearly able to govern
themselves honestly and well that we can afford to let
them take part in governing us. Does it seem wise
to you for us to undertake the labor of instructing
Senators from Hawaii or Cuba m the principles of
sound currency, when we cannot teach them to the
Senators from our new States, or even to those from
Pennsylvania? Is it not idle for us to attempt to gov
ern Cuba when we find it so difficult to govern the
city of New York? Reformers all over the country
are continually claiming that the g-eat difficulty which
we have in the administration of this government
comes from the presence, in the midst of us, of for
eigners. Those foreigners are here, under our sys
tem, subject to our police, educated in our
schools and by our press, and taking part
in the solution of problems with which we
are called upon to deal. If we cannot control them,
what, do you think, would be the result of adding
I to our body politic whole states of foreigners, not sub
ject to our police, unfamiliar with our institutions, or
I even with our language, and not subject to any of the
{ influences of education or association to which our
I nationalized citizens are now exposed? â¢ * â¦ The
I best war that was ever fought was the War of the Re
bellion, but it left behind a legacy of party spirit, of
extravagance, of taxation, of corruption, which has
stood between us and good government for thirty
years. We are finding it impossible to decide what
I our dollar is now, thirty years after that war closed.
Can we afford to let our rulers, for no cause that
concerns us. expose us not only to the material con
j sequences of another war in the loss of life and prop
erty, increased taxation and fresh pensions, but to the
far more terrible demoralization which war causes?"
It will be noticed in what we have quoted of these
addresses that neither of these eminent lawyers con
ceded that foreign territory and people could be
added to our system for any other purpose than in
corporation into our body politic. Neither they nor
any other Americans, as recently as 1896, conceived
such a thing possible as stretching our system to
cover either the military or civil control of distant
provinces as imperial colonies, to be held subject to
our power but not to the laws by which the republic
is governed.
Depew and Storey were expressing the traditions
and uttering the spirit of the laws of the republic only
two years ago, and the fact that what they considered
so foreign to both as not to be mentioned as a part of
our national policy is now supported as a legitimate
and proper national concern illustrates the wide de
parture we have taken and gives sharp edge to Mr.
Storey's belief that our institutions would hardly sur
vive victory in a foreign war.
THE LAST MOPE OF THE SILVERITES.
SENATOR MORGAN of Alabama is old and
sick, but he is one of the kind of pugnacious
creatures to whom fighting is an instinct, and,
weak as he is, he is still challenging the world on the
silver question. He has succeeded in convincing him
self that the stars in their courses are fighting for free
silver, and in that conviction is striving to arouse the
despondent Bryanites to renewed battle.
The new hope of the old fighter is ba<ed upon the
assumption that the imperialistic jingoes will carry
out their policy of expansion by annexing all the
former colonies of Spain, and that the addition of
these silver-using peoples to our population will make
a demand for silver, which our Government can meet
only by granting the free coinage of that metal.
The Senator believes not only that free silver will
win after imperialistic expansion, but that it will win
without a fight. He is quoted as having stated in a
recent interview: "The expulsion of Spanish money,
which is silver, from Porto Rico and the Philippines,
and its replacement by American money, together
with the vastly increased demands of trade, will, in
my judgment, increase the value of silver bullion to
such an extent that there will be no more contention
over the coinage question."
Here we have more trouble in sight; clouding the
prospects of the annexation policy. We are not only
to annex the pestilential islands of the Oriental
tropics, add their mongrel inhabitants to our popula
tion, expose our workingmen to the competition of
coolies worked by gigantic trusts, but we are also to
bring our money down to their level. Once started
on such a career, our expansionists and money
tinkers may proceed to annex some Chinese province
with millions of people and then demand the free
coinage of copper.
However, the situation is not so bad as it seems
from the statement of the Alabama Senator. His
conclusions are not founded upon any basis of rea
son. Even if we annex all the islands in sight, there
will be no change in the monetary situation. The
price of silver bullion will not be affected in the least
by the substitution of the star-spangled banner for
the Spanish flag at Manila and San Juan. The money
standard of the islanders will be adjusted to our own,
and ours will remain the same.
The Senators words are not unworthy of note,
however, and should not be overlooked. They show
what hopes are animating some of the annexationists.
The expansion of the republic into a colonial empire
is to be made, if possible, a means of expanding our
monetary system beyond the solid gold standard into
free silver and fiatism.
THE NICARfIGUAN CANfIL.
rROM the statements made in the Presidential
message concerning the Nicaraguan canal, it is
likely that long discussed project will be brought
to an issue during the coming winter. At any rate
very strong reasons will be required to bring about
a further delay after the urgent recommendations of
the President for immediate action.
The message gives a clear statement of the circum
stances which make prompt action imperative. It
appears that overtures have been made to the Gov
ernments of Nicaragua -and Costa Rica for a new
canal concession, predicated on the assumed ap
proaching lapse of the Maritime Canal Company.
Now it is upon the basis of the contracts, plans and
surveys of the Maritime Canal Company that our
governmental inquiries into the enterprises have been
made, and if that company loses its rights and a new
concession is granted, a serious complication will
ensue.
The President has not hesitated, he says, to ex
press his convictions "that considerations of ex
pediency and international policy between the sev
eral governments interested in the construction and
control of an interoceanic canal by this route require
the maintenance of the status quo until the canal com
mission shall have reported, and the United States
Congress shall have had an opportunity to pass fin
ally upon the whole matter during the present sep
sion."
It appears that, nevertheless, the Government of
Nicaragua, as one of its last acts before becoming
one of the United States of Central America, granted
an optional concession to another association to be
come effective on the expiration of the present grant.
Upon that showing the President says:
"All these circumstances suggest the urgency of
some definite action by Congress at this session if the
labors of the past arc to be utilized and the linking
of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by a practical
waterway is to be realized. That the construction of
such a maritime highway is now more
than ever indispensable to that intimate and
ready intercommunication between our East
ern and Western seaboards demanded by the an
nexation of the Hawaiian Islands and the prospective
expansion of our influence and commerce to the Pa
cific, and that our national policy now more impera
tively than ever calls for its control by this Govern-
ment, are propositions which I doubt not Congress
will duly appreciate and wisely act upon."
Strong as are the reasons given why the measure
should be acted upon at once, and popular as the en
terprise is with the people, the subject is not going
to be brought to an issue without a hard fight. It
may prove to be the great contest of the session. A
persistent effort will be made to prove that a canal
across the isthmus anywhere would not pay because
there is no regular trade route through that portion of
the globe, and that if there is to be a canal it would
be better at Panama than at Nicaragua. The Panama
Company has a strong lobby at Washington and is
organized for the work that will be required of it.
The critical period in the history of the great en
terprise has been reached. The time for action has
arrived. The friends of the measure should now put
forth every energy and make the fight vigorously in
both houses.
NOT (\ PRISON REFORM.
IT is not at all difficult to agree with Prison Director
Devlin, whose minority report on prison discipline
â¢has just been published, that one of the worst
things which the coming Legislature could do would
be to adapt the indeterminate sentence system to the
State prisons of California.
It is easy to talk about the benefits the adoption of
such a system would confer upon persons sent to
prison for crime, but once the thing is contemplated
in all its phases it is seen that it would completely rob
the bastile of its terrors and substitute for the sen
tences of the Judges the pull of the politicians. No
man could be kept in prison a moment if he had a
pull, and the effect of placing it within the power of
anybody to terminate sentences at pleasure would be
a general jail delivery at Folsom and San Quentin.
It may be, as Director Devlin says, that such a plan
could profitably be adapted to a separate institution
and so organized as to apply to offenders under a cer
tain age, but we doubt even that. The chief efficacy
of punishment for offenses against the law is the cer
tainty with which it is inflicted. The moment crim
inals are informed that they can get out of prison with j
the aid of their friends, one strong restraint upon
crime will be broken down. One great objection to
the present pardon system is that it holds out hope to
every man in prison of ultimately getting out. One
half the time of the Governor and the Prison Direct- I
ors is taken up hearing applications for pardon which
are entirely without merit, but which it is difficult for
them to resist.
If the Legislature is going to do anything it should
amend the laws so as to sweep away all chance of a
man getting out of prison who has once been sen
tenced. Commutations and reprieves are all right, but
pardons may be safely dispensed with. To introduce
indeterminate sentences would break down prison dis
cipline entirely, and they should not be thought of for
a moment.
We are astonished that the Prison Directors should
have recommended any such change. They ought to
know that in a State like California, where the admin
istration of justice at the very best is weak, the inno
vation would prove disastrous. There is too much
politics in the prisons already.
All that can be asked of the Alameda jury to try
Mrs. Mentel is that it shall not permit sympathetic
tears to blind its eyes to facts.
To be Governor of Illinois in strike times is an
honor not wholly free from discomfort
THE LATE JUDGE BORDER
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 5, 1898.
To the 1 -itor of The San Francisco Callâ Dear Sir: It is fitting that
the late Rhodes Borden be held up before young men as a shining example
of the achievements of an unobstrusive gentleman, possessed of character
and of intellect. In a professional sense he was a genuine product of this
State and of all the contributions of the past that have entered into its
highest civilization. His success was due to merit. He was not a sham,
but a reality. He wore no pretentious decorations, typifying the selfish
element in fraternity. He had no following among the battered faces of bar
room politicians. He was totally devoid of the strut of blended dishonesty,
ignorance and cheek. And yet he won distinction and died in a judicial
office which symbolizes the strongest element in popular institutions.
All this resulted from unostentatious labor and lofty integrity, appre
ciated by the public. His election in November was in line with the num
erous other evidences of the discrimination and judgment of American
citizens. When he studied for the bar he applied his strong brain to the
absorption of principles and the development of the rare faculty of consecu
tive reasoning. He lost no time. He discarded frivolous amusements and
dissipations. He claimed no genius, the frequent excuse for laziness, but de
termined to become a lawyer and not a charlatan. When he commenced
practice it was soon observed that, while he was argumentative and tena
cious, he looked at all sides of every question, and that, without procras
tination, he was yet slow and careful in reaching conclusions, which, though
firmly held, were modestly and temperately expressed. Thus It happened
that, long before he was named for the office in which he died he was dis
cussed among leading members of the bar as singularly adapted to a judicial
career. I think it probable that before he was appointed by Governor Budd,
from a list which included worthy competitors, such voluntary letters in
his favor as have not often been written reached the executive office. He
had to follow the routine of our Superior Court and was assigned to the
trial of persons charged with crime, but, even there, in the brief interval
which preceded his death, he impressed the bar, his associates and the whole
community.
And so, amidst all the political evils which infest the State, Rhodes Bor
dent died, a recognized scholar, an accomplished lawyer, a pure and com
petent judge, a refined and well-mannered gentleman, a faithful citizen,
beloved and respected by his family and by his friends, and lamented
wherever he touched humanity.
Finis coronat opus. This life is worth the study and the imitation of
young men. PUBLICOL.A.
MR. BURNS AND HIS CANDIDACY.
It Excites the Derision oi the Newspapers That Do Not
Bend the Knee When Herrin Nods.
REASON WHY BURNS IS PRO
POSED.
(Los Angeles Herald.)
It is announced, almost or quite offi
cially, that Henchman Dan Burns of
San Francisco is slated by Uncle Collis
for the place now occupied in the Unit
ed States Senate by Hon. Stephen M.
White. People in this neighborhood
will readily grasp the meaning of tho
selection, so far as our local interests
are concerned.. It means that the
shrewd and tireless old lobbyist of the
Southern Pacific is preparing for a final
and formidable move to kill the harbor
project at San Pedro.
This is no false alarm. During the
late campaign Senator White earnestly
warned our people that the San Pedro
harbor project was by no means safe.
He intimated, in fact, that he had suf
ficient reason for the belief that Hunt
ington would aim to throttle the har
bor scheme if he secured control of the
State government, with the assurance
of a United States Senator, who would
do his bidding. And now comes the se
quel to that warning in the announce
ment that the notorious professor of
Southern Pacific politics, Dan Burns,
is the instrument selected by Hunting
ton to take the active lead in fighting
the harbor.
And now we may expect, when Sena
ator Dan Burns gets his chair fairly
warmed, that the wily old king of the
lobby will intimate that the Govern
ment is wasting money at San Pedro.
The influence of Huntington in the Sen
ate was shown before, and the friends
of San Pedro needed all the influence
they could command. There is a fit
ting adage to the effect that "as you
make your bed, so shall you lie."

the power of Huntington in the Repub
lican party, and they evidently believe
there is danger ahead. From a parti
san standpoint nothing could be better
for the Democratic party than the elec
tion of Burns, but there is something
greater to consider than partisanship,
and that is the interests of the State of
California. The Republican voters of
this State have shown a willingness to
stand almost anything, but we believe
they wfll draw the line on Dan Burns
for Senator.
WHY NOT HUNTINGTONP
(Del Monte Record.)
Colonel Burns, the Republican boss
of San Francisco, is being boomed for
the United States Senatorship from
California. Why not elect Huntington?
He and Depew of New York would
make a strong team in that corpora
tion bossed body.
COUNTRY PRESS AGAINST
BURNS.
(Santa Rosa Republican.)
That Colonel D. M. Burns is the
choice of the Southern Pacific Company
for the Senate is the general belief. The
company cannot afford to play fast and
loose with that gentleman and its po
litical manager was fairly trapped by
Messrs. de Young and Spreckels into
the disclosing of its intent in the mat;
ter. There is no getting away from
the proposition that the company de
sires the election of Colonel Burns. At
the same time it is a patent fact that
the company is against U. S. Grant
more determinedly than it is against
any other candidate under considera
tion.
The three leading Republican papers
of the State have declared against the
railroad and the man receiving its sup
port. There can be little doubt of the
country press falling in line with this
sentiment. The people do not wish the
railroad to elect the Senator and they
are opposed to the conferring of this
honor upon the man receiving the sup
port of the company. That the country
press -will quickly, declare this senti
ment is quite certain.

RELICS OF OLDEN TIMES.
Ancient Car Rails Soon to Be Re-
moved From Washington Street.
The officers of the Merchants' Associa
tion have been successful In gettinj? all of
the property owners on Washington
street, between Kearny and Montgomery,
to sign for a modern noiseless pavement.
In consequence the association has peti
tioned the Board of Supervisors to adver
tise for bids to have this work done. As
the property owners wish to have the en
tire roadway paved the request Is mado
that the Supervisors remove the unusad
street-car rails that have been an eyesore
ever since the old two-horse cars ran on
Washington and Montgomery streets.
The removal of these old rails will be
the destruction of the relics of the first
street-car line in this city, for it was
over Washington and Sansome streets
that the first cars ran so far back that
only the oldest inhabitants remember the
date. Nearly all of the pioneers who mado
the trial trip over the road :>.n> now dead,
but it Is told that on that occasion there
was great excitement and not a few wera
decidedly opposed to the then modern In
novation. Walking was good enough for
the majority and the opposition to pro
gress was led by men who were interested
in bus lines that carried passengers to
what were then the suburbs of San Fran
cisco. The first fare over these old rails
was "two bits," although the distance
was not much over half a dozen blocks.
NOVEMBER IMMIGRANTS.

The November report of United States
Immigration Commissioner North con
tains many interesting items. During
that month there were admitted at the
port of San Francisco 414 immigrants, of
whom 297 were males. The following na
tionalities were represented: Japan, 99;
England, 91; British Columbia, 64; Ha
waii, 26; Guam (Ladrone Islands). 25;
Australia, 16; Ireland, 10; Portugal, 4;
Siam, 1; Korea, 1. The remainder were
from Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Russia,
Italy and other countries.
Forty of the immigrants are under 14
years of age and thirty-five are over 45
years old. There were twenty illiterates â
unable to read their own languageâdi
vided as follows: 9 Guam Islanders, 7
Japanese, 1 Greek and 2 Mexicans. One
contract laborer was deported.
The following religions were represent
ed: Protestant, 229; Catholic, 91; Bud

Part of the New York

NO MORE "HONOLULU LADY"
THAT TUNE IS NOW xABOOED BY
THE GOTHAMITES.
The Men, as a Body, Do Not Like
Hawaii, and Are Delighted to
Be on Their Way Home
Once More.
The officers and men of the New York
Regiment who returned from "the Para
dise of the Pacific" on the steamer Aus
tralia yesterday do not like Hawaii, and
have no scruples about saying so. As the
mail boat was making the dock the band
played "My Honolulu Lady" and then
threw the music overboard. When they
got on the wharf one of them said: "Now
let anybody say Honolulu lady or Hono
lulu anything, and see what a clubbing

The Australia brought up Companies
A, B, D, I and L, comprising 472 men and
the following officers:
Colonel F. H. Barber, Lieutenant Colonel H.
r. Stacpole, Major W. Scott, Adjutant C. Stre
vlll. Captain F. R. Palmer. Lieutenant \\in
throp Lieutenant H. C. Staats, Lieutenant "W .

Twelve convalescents ocupied first-class
cabins.
It was thought that the men would look
worn out with their experience in Hawaii,
but instead every one of them looked fit
to fight for a kingdom. They had a splen
did time coming: up on the Australia, and
one and all swear by Chief Steward Jo
seph Seeley. Not only he but every officer
on the ship did everything possible to
make the trip a pleasant one. and in con
nce there is no ship like the Aus
tralia when the New York boys are
it round. Every day the band played on
deck and every night there was a concert j
In the cabin. "In fact," said Colonel Bar- j
i.'-r when leaving the vessel, "my men I
hayÂ« so thoroughly enjoyed the voyage !
up from Honolulu that I don't know how ;
i will get them away from the wharf, j
thing possible was done for our
comfort, and the result you see."
An impression has gone abroad that
< Clonf-1 Barber is not liked by his men.
The fact is Just the opposite. No man
could be better loved by his subordinates.
"The reports are all false and were made
out of whole cloth," said Captain Palmer
of Company A. "There never was a truer
or kinder gentleman, and his regiment
would do anything for him. It is also
false that the people of Honolulu were
unfriendly to him. The only people who
opposed him were a few city officials who
were Jealous. They tried to make it un
comfortable for him, and to some extent
succeeded. That is all there was to the
matter."

and the cabin passengers had gone ashore
the soldiers were marched down the gang
plank, company by company. They then
formed in line on the wharf and stacked
arms. The command "Open order," was
given, after which the men removed their
knapsacks and laid them on the wharf.
Deputy Surveyor of the Port St. John and
a force of twenty inspectors were on
the ground, and they went to work
and quickly inspected all the knapsackÃ.
The customs authorities were determined
that no more stories about smuggled
cigars should be circulated; hence the
rigid search. When the work was done
the men were marched away for the Pre
sidio, via Market street and Van Ness
avenue.
J. J. Flnnegan and wife of Utica, N. V.,
were two of a number of disappointed
people who were down to meet the Aus
tralia. They were expecting their son
and a nephew to come back with the
troops, and had come all the way from
Utica to meet them. They drove down
from the Palace in a couple of hacks, and
were ready to take the young men away,
bag and bagage. They felt greatly dis
appointed when they learned that the
young men had not come. They will ar-

J Out of the full strength of the regiment
j (1300 officers and men) there were thirteen
j deaths, from various causes, while the
soldiers were In Hawaii. On Thanksgiv
ing day there were 150 men on the sick list
In the military hospital in Independence
Park and 125 In the hospital at Buena
Vista Park. These were all fed on jellies
and gooâ¬ things by the people of Hono
lulu, but the news that they were going
home did more toward their recovery than
the kindnesses showered on them.
In talking about his regiment, Colonel
Barber said the men were all sorry they
had not got as far as Manila. He knew
his men regretted they had not reached
the Philippines, but he felt that it took
as much courage to do what they had
done from the first as would be required
In active campaigning. He pointed with
pride to the brotherly manner in which
the sick comrades had been cared for.
The colonel spoke feelingly of the ladies
of Honolulu. They were at the wharf
; when the transports arrived, and grave the
i boys fruit and flowers. They did a
j thousand and one things to help the boys
: along, and he felt sure that their great
I kindnesses were fully appreciated.
The soldiers will await the coming of
their comrades at the Presidio, where
quarters have been prepared for them,
and when the regiment is all together it
will proceed to New York to be mustered
out.

WEATHER CONDITIONS AND GENERAL
FORECAST.
An area of very high pressure is central in
Idaho, where the barometer reads above 30.80
inches. From this section the pressure rapidly
diminishes toward the coast. Generally cloudy
weather prevails In California and fair weather
In other sections west of the Rocky Moun
tains. There are some Indications that a
storm exists off the Southern California coast,
â¢which is being prevented from approaching the
coast by the very high pressure in the in
terior. It is as yet too soon to determine
whether this storm will cause general rain in
California, Conditions, however, are some
what favorable for rain on the Southern Cali
fornia coast by Wednesday night.
Forecast made at San Francisco for 30 hours
ending at midnight December 7, 1898:
Northern Californiaâ Partly cloudy Wednes
day; brisk north to east wind.
Southern Californiaâ Cloudy Wednesday and
probably occasional light rain In southwest
portion; fresh east wind.
Nevada â Fair Wednesday.
Utahâ Fair Wednesday.
Arizona â Generally cloudy Wednesday, prob
' ably with occasional light rain in "extreme
:eouth portion.
. For San Francisco and vicinityâ Generally
cloudy Wednesday; brisk easterly wind.
Special report from Mount Tamalpaisâ Partly
cloudy; wind north. 12 miles; maximum tem
perature, 50; current, 50.

NEW TORK. Dec. 6.â Fractional gains
throughout the list were the results of the
trading to-day. Decided strength of the early
market was In sympathy with London's im
proved prices and London was a purchaser on
balance. Profit taking at times checked the
advance In the local market, which became dull
In the aft-eraocn with quotations generally well
maintained. Sugar, after an early advance,
sold off as usual on the announcement of the
regular dividend disbursement. The transac
tions in this specialty were -cry large and
covering of Bhorts brought about full recov
ery to the best advance of the day. leaving the
price a point below yesterday's close. A fea
ture of the' importance was the coalers, which
were buoyant on the assumption that a new
trade agreement would be in effect next month.
Pacific stocks were strong and at periods of
depression in the day's trading rallied the rest
of the list. Central Pacific rose 2Vi points on
the dissemination of a report that the Govern
ment might extend the time for that road to
pay its obligations to the Government The
actions of the day's market reflected the con
tinued operations as for some time of large
speculative interests in having diverted their
operations Into low-priced shares which give
promise of increased or impending dividend
disbursement.
Considerable amounts of stock ruling In the
forties were taken in hand, conspicuous ex
amples bejng Southern preferred and North
ern Pacific. The Granger group showed spurts
of activity at times and moved in sympathy
with the general market, although improve
ments as a rule were less pronounced.
The bond market showed decided strength at

LONDON MARKET.
NEW TORK. Dec. 6.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here were dull and â¢ ulet to-day, the
only feature being the strength of Americans
and mines. The former were srood on New
York support and on professional buying here,
and closed at the best. Northern Pacific and
Union Pacific were especially strong. The
President's message had no effect, the market
here merely awaiting New York's lead. The dis
count market here is distinctly weak, the po
sition being that a large mass of bills are
maturing, while the supply of new bills is very
scarce. This releases capital and the Increased
supply of uninvested funds depressed rates.
Kaffirs were good on the reported renewal of
the dynamite contract by the Transvaal Govern
ment at lower prices. Argentines were easy
on damage to crops by rain.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Dec. 6.â For two hours following
the opening in wheat, it looked as if specula
tion in that commodity . had been abandoned.
The . ranee of prices â¢ during that time was
scarcely more than %c and trades of any kind
were few and far between. 5 There I was abso
lutely no outside interest, a little knot of local
speculators doing all the little scalping busi
ness that was transacted. ' The opening was
6tÂ£a(?> at %c over yesterday's closing price.
May starting at 66@66%c, and there the price
remained until near the close. In spite of the
oullness the market during the morning showed
no indications of wekaness. Cables showed .\
little cOvance at Liverpool due, it 'was. :!ald.
to report? of crop damage in Argentine on ac
count of unfavorable weather. The increase
in the visibit was only 764,000 bushels, or r.bout
half of what had been expected.
The cloe-me.of DeceribT holdings had 1 some
effect on May trading late in the session, in
creasing the slight selling pressure enough to
cause a slight decline from the price that had
remained almost unchanged from the start.
May j declined â¢to ; 63%@65%c, and closed heavy
at the price.
Corn was dull, but the lack of interest was
not so pronounced as in -wheat. The market
as a whole was weak. Influenced by the cold
weather, the increasing receipts and lower ca
bles. May closed %c lower. . .
Oats were decidedly weak. There was a good
deal of â  liquidation by prominent holders. In
crease in the receipts apparently shaking the
confidence of. bulls. May closed %@%c lower.
Provisions, though ' rather quiet, were firm
most of the day at a slight advance.; There
was a good demand and as packers did not
come Into the market to any great extent,
quotations ruled somewhat higher. Late In the
session, however, the weakness in all the grain
markets affected provisions and prices slid
off. the market being heavy at the close. May
pork closed 7%c lower. May lard 2%@5c lower
and May ribs 5c lower. - -- . . _.-

COMMITTEE
IS SNUBBED
Vermont Marble Com
pany the Snubber.
BOOKS ARE NOT PRODUCED
MR. HAWLEY WILL BE REPORT
ED TO THE LEGISLATURE.
Progress of the Senate Investigation
Relating to the Construction
of the Union Ferry
Depot.
The events of yesterday morning's res
nlon of the Senate committee of invcsti
that tlie inside facts and
: !!;<> new ferry depot scandal
7 will <n!ed to the public of Cali
fornia until the "gislature convenes and
tti power to compel the produc
tion of important books and data.
The committee's authority was deued
by M. J. Hawtejr. the manager of the Ver
mont Marble Company. On the advice of
the company's attorney he declined to
produce the books of original entry and
bearing on the price paid by the con
tractor, C. F. McCarthy, for marble used
in the construction of the building.
Yesterday toorning Manager Hawley
was before the committee at the time
-mated. He was called to the witness
Btand and interrogated by Senator Dick
inson, chairman. The Questions and an
swers were:
Questionâ Have you the date and original en
try-book called for by the committee?
Answer â Our attorney ftdvtaM v* that we
have- no connection with the State in this mat
ter, and as wo do not care to advertise our
private business. -we shall decline to produce
our book*. except upon order of the court. 'â â 
Q. â As 1 understand it, you are the general
manager of the company and have charge of
its affairs?
A.â YeÂ«; manager of thÂ« San Francisco
branch of the coijÂ»pany.
Â«J. â I understand now that you decline i to
produce data, on which you based your collec
tions as to the cost of the marble work?
âExcept en the order of court.
a.â You have that data in your possession
and under your control?
A.â Yea, sir.
y.â And you also decline to produce your
"Vtnoks of original entry, covering everything
â¢ mentioned in this marble transaction with Mr.
McCarthy?
âYes. sir.
Q.â Are those books In your possession and
under your control?
.A. -Yes, sir. . .
The chairman, after consulting with his
associates on the committee â Senators
l'rlsk and lioyceâ said:
r that the matter may be formal, the
committee directs you to produce without delay
this data, also the books containing the orig
inal entries regarding the marble furnished by
' naed In this Union Ferry building, and
all entries connected with the same as far as
relates to matters between you and Mr. Mc-
Carthy, or as between you and any architect
i r any other person connected with or having
anything to do with this building, and you de
cline to do that?
A.â Yes, air.
General Dickinsonâ That is all.
. The committee then adjourned until 1
p. m.
During the recess General Dickinson
Bald to a reporter of The Call:
"Nothing more can be done until the
Legislature convenes. Then Mr. Hawley
chn be called before the Senate to explain.
The cases two- years ago, involving ; the
' power of 'the Senate, went before the Su
perior Court and Supreme Court of the
mate and the United States court. The
power of the Senate to punish for con
tempt is established by the decisions."
The general comment is to the effect
that the marble company was not well
advised when it decided to defy the Sen
ate committee. In order to give the com
pany further light in the premises Gen
eraJ Dickinson will send to Manager Haw
ley a copy of the resolution under which
the committee is conducting the. present
.investigation. The Legislature has power
â¢(to compel the production of papers and
l\:o punish witnesses for contempt. Sooner
%t later all the facts and incidents of the
ferry depot scandal must be brought to
lipht. -\lr Hawley's refusal to furnish
the committee with information -in his
possession will tend to make the public
more eager and insistent- than ever in
pressing the Inquiry.
At the afternoon session William Cronin
was called as a witness by the chairman
to give his figures and details as to the
cost of the marble capitals.
The witness said he did not have his
data, and could not give the details. "I
made the capitals in my shop,", he said.
"I could not, without going over the de
tails again, give you the figures by which
I calculated that the capitals cost $24
apiece. When the shop on the premises
was torn down the data was destroyed.
1 have not the detailed plan now."
Regarding the painting the witness tes
tified: "I figured on the amount of iron
used. These figures gave 170.000 square
feet of fiat iron and 143,013 square feet of
corrugated iron. The iron was painted on
both sides.
chairmanâ How did you arrive at this quan
\VitnÂ«sÂ»â I measured the roof. For painting
the flat iron I charged one cent a foot and half
a cent a foot for the corrugated iron.
Mr. Cronin. replying to Senator Dick
lnt>on, aaid there was nothing contained in
ginal proposals in regard to paint
ing.
H.aator D!cklnÂ»onâ You make a proposal on
this date to paint concealed surfaces and you
dl the Iron. Did you feel yourself called
upon to point all the galvanized iron?
Mr. Croninâ My understanding was to paint
all the corrugated Iron.
Q â What estimates did you make on con
cealed portions?
A.â l made none.
Q -Do you mean tc say that this la your
proposition?
A.â lt was rheaper to paint all than to paint
Xthe concealed portion. It was the Intention of
1 y bid to I aint all.
The specifications and records were pro
duced to show that a coat of red paint
wa* to be put on by the painting con
tractor.
It was further testified by Mr. Cronin
that he sublet some of his own painting to
Bmlth & Son. The witness said he could
not produce data or figures as to the price
designated In the subletting. There v.-as a
verbal arrangement with George Smith.
Mr. Cronin further testified that the
work In some respect was not done ac
cording: to the specifications, but that the
architect permitted him to go ahead and
rtn the Job in workman-like manner. The
CEREAL.
DR. HALE DOES NOT
Write Testimonials, but Does Good
In Another Way.
My husband, Dr. Hale, does not write
but he always rec-
smmends to his patients the use of
Postum Food Coffee in place of com-
mon coffee.
We mix the Postum with just enough
egg (white and yolk beaten together)
to moisten it a little, then the Postum
does not boil up around the edges of
the coffee pot as it does when moist-
ened with water alone, and we think
It tastes richer and seems clearer.
This does not take the place of con-
tinued boiling, for we have no way to
get the rich taste out of Postum ex-
- pt by knowing that it has been al-
"â¦ ved 10 boil fifteen or twenty min-
xes, after the real boiling begins.
Many make a mistake by counting
'he fifteen minutes from the time they
rut the pot on the stove, but this will
not do. I have never had any liver
trouble since I began the use of Pos-
tum, whereas before I was constantly
troubled with a sluggish liver.
Mrs. Morrie Hale, 417 Quapau ave-
nue, Hot Springs, Ark.
record was then made in the official In
quiry that the specifications were not fol- |
lowed.
Answering questions put by his counsel,
E. B. Young, Mr. Cronin testified that he
did not desire to be understood as saying
that the architect or Harbor Commission
ers authorized him to ignore the specifica
tions, but advised him to do the work in
a workman-like manner.
In the evening the Senate investigating
committee convened at 8 o'clock, and inci
dentally tested the iluminating facilities
Â°i t l? e J} a â  lOf Commissioners' apa-tmen'.s
of the Lnion Depot while giving attention
to the statements of Contractor J. C.
Bateman. who had the contract for car
p.cÂ« nt J* r 'v- pla6 , ter a P d glazing work. He tes
tified that iron braces, steel beams, joist
anchors, and other material cost a great
deal more money than the prices esti
mated by the expert. The cost of his work
w , a ? '"creased by numerous delays for
which he was not responsible. He said he
complained of the obstructions and placed
many of his complaints before Mr. Robin
son, who was superintendent of construc
tion.
Senator Dickinson called E. L. Colnon,
Harbor Commissioner, to the witness
stand. Mr. Colnon, replying to questions,
testified: "I began my duties as Commis
sioner in March. 1895. The foundation of
the depot was then half finished and the
plans for thYÂ» superstructure had been pre
pared. The sum of $4000 -had been allowed
the architect. A. Page Brown, but no pro
posals had been invited. No other archi
tect than Mr. Brown, so far as I know,
had been consulted. My fellow Commis
sioners were Dan T. Cole and V. S. Chad
bourne. Contracts were awarded Decem
ber 24. 1595. on plans prepared by Mr.
Brown. Architect Percy was employed to
expert the plans. There was a great deal
of newspaper criticism about this time.
It was said that the plans had been so
drawn that local *ron men were excluded
from bidding. 1 was the private secretary
of Governor Budd Just before my appoint
ment, and I thought It best U) have the
foundation experted, as newspaper re
ports represented the foundation work as
inferior.
"Mr. Perov did not change the plans
drawn by Mr. Brown and bids were re
ceived on the original plans, but no work
was ilune until nearly a year had elapsed.
"\Ye had a long period of litigation. The
change in the material from Oregon to
Coiusa stone went to the Supreme Court.
I was opposed to changing material after
a proposal had been made. I did not vote
for the change until the court and the
Attorney General of the State decided
that we had the right to change. The
contract price of the stone was $230,000."
Replying to further questions by the
chairman Mr. Colnon testified that the
mistake in building the depot was the
failure to ke*p within the limit of J60P.000.
Exhaustive tt-sts were made of the stone
and no mistake wa:s made in accepting
the Coiusa material, as the tests demon
strated its superiority.
Senator Dickinson asked what right the
board had to exceed $600,000 or adopt.
changes.
The Corrfmi6Bioner said the board con
sulted the Governor and Attorney Gen
eral. Some of the changes were suggest
ed by the demands of the transportation
companies.
In the course of his testimony the wit
ness testified that he did not participate,
in the changes, but subsequently added
that the Harbor Commissioners were
unanimous on all questions relating to
the construction of i.he building."

THE SAIST FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1898.
LA GOLETA
TOO SPEEDY
FOR NAPAMAX
Downed the Maxim
Filly in Fast Time.
RAINIER STRUCK HIS CLASS
IN THE LAST EVENT BERNAR
DILLO SHONE BEILLIANTLY.
lam|e Q Outsprinted by Midlight.
Elizabeth It Left the Maiden
Ciass â Four First Choices
in Front.
With the exception of Briar Sweet, It
is quite evident after yesterday's per
formance that La Goleta, the Santa
Anita stable's flyer, holds all of the other
three-year-old fillies in California safe.
She met Napamax in the fourth race on
the card at Oakland, over a mile, and
never very hard pressed, won as she
pleased in 1:40 flat. The winner opened
in the betting at 4 to 5, and was played
down to 1 to 2. Napamax, as usual, ran
gamely, but was simply carried off her
feet by the superior piece of racing fur
niture. Cromwell was the only other
starter.
The card looked a hard one to guess,
still it proved the means of attracting a
large and persevering crowd. Some very
warm tips were passed around, but the
majority of them were tried out and
found wanting. The favorites passed a
pleasurable afternoon, attaching them
selves to four of the purses offered.
In the opening four and a half furlong
scramble for maiden two-year-olds Engea
demonstrated beyond doubt that she is
not a stayer. Starting a 6 to 5 favorite,
she led to the stretch and then closed up
like a jackknife. It was then smooth
sailing for Charley Gray on Elizabeth R,
â which won romping from Limatus.
Twelve evenly classed selling platers
lined up in the sprint over the Futurity
course that followed, and spicy prices
were obtainable against any of them.
Through a most persuasive piece of saddle
work. Cash Sloan, on Cardwell, a 6 to 1
shot, landed his mount winner a neck in
front of Jack o' Lantern, the favorite.
Brown Prince, a despised outsider, took
the show.
The mile selling event was nothing more
than a warming-up gal!op for the two
year-old Rainier. The ring laid 6 to 5
about him. and McCarthy made a run
away race of it. Guilder, with Spencer up,
secured the place from Prince Blazes in
a hard drive.
The Kettleman Brothers won their first
race of the meeting with Midlight. The
filly was a pronounced favorite for the
six-furlong spin, fifth on the card, and
after lying In third position to the stretch
drew away, winning easily from Mamie G.
Little Johnny Relff got up with Libertine
in time to get the show from the 100 to 1
shot, Ricardo.
In the final milo and a sixteenth run,
Bernardlllo, starting a mild favorite,
looked all the way like ready money, and
called to a drive the last few yards led
Gotobed out a head in 1:47&. "W'hitcomb
was third.
Track Notes.
John O'Neil, the partner of Frank Eck
ert in the bookmaking business, arrived
from the East Monday night and was
about the ring yesterday.
Tiring of the game here, "Virginia"
Carroll, the layer of odds, left for New
Orleans last evening.
"Kentucky" John Givens Is meeting
with considerable success with his public
training stable. The winners, Polka, Jer
ilderio and Cardwell, were sent out from
his barn.
Spencer rode two winners yesterday and
was second once. The tall boy has quite
a following.

A LITTLE STATEMENT
OF THEIR OWN
SCHOOL DIBECTOES PROMPTLY
HURL THE LIE.
With Figures From the Books They
Will Put the Grand Jury Re
port to the Blush.
School Directors Waller and Gallagher
arc not satisfied with the report of
School Department discrepancies and
shortages furnished the Grand Jury by
Chairman Irving. Neither for that mat
ter is purchasing agent Bantel, nor his
assistant. Secretary Welch, and in three
days by the watch a true statement, duly
certified and attested, will issue from
somewhere in the inner workings of the
department. This by the word of Waller.
And the new statement is already cal
culated by its proposed promulgators to
put to the blush the awful array of fig
ures that Irving and Kllpatrick have tak
en from such untrustworthy sources as
the books of Auditor Broderick and the
Treasurer. The figures of the department
reports will come right off the depart
ment books and will be the only Simon
pure thing yet unloaded on the public
since the School Board kettle has been
a-bubbling. This, also, by the word of
Waller.
Almost every one of the Directors took
occasion yesterday to deny the figures
published from the report submitted to
the Grand Jury. That there is a deficit
of $271,000 to bequeath to the incoming
board is declared a malicious lie. But
the board, individually, are equally unan
imous that no dne of them Is familiar
with the department books or knows
within a wide approximation how the fig
ures will stack up. But everything before
the Grand Jury is a lie on general princi
ples, and it is the object of the threat
ened forthcoming "official statement" to
net the He right and retire Juryman Irv
ing to embarrassed obscurity, which is
also vouched for by Waller.
LIEUT. NOLAN'S FUNERAL.
He Will Be Buried at 2 O'clock This

BALDWIN RUINS
YIELD ANOTHER
VICTIM'S BODY
Remains of Judge J. J.
Carter Recovered.
IDENTIFIED BY THE HEAD
WRAPPED IN A WET SHEET HE
MET HIS DOOM.
Progress of the Work of Removing
the Debris â Accident to
One of the La
borers.
The body of "Judge" Jofin J. Carter, the
raring official who lost his life In the
Baldwin Hotel fire, was recovered from
the ruins at about 10 o'clock yesterday
morning by workmen engaged In clearing
away the debris. The body was found
near the room occupied by the deceased
on the fifth floor, in the Ellis and Powell
street corner of the building, and next to
the room occupied by Jonathan L. White,
who was killed by falling to the sidewalk
on the same occasion.
The trunk was - charred mass, the legs
having been burned off. The face had
beÂ«n destroyed by the flames, and tne
only way by which he was identified was
by the shape of his head and by the fill
ing of his teeth. The body was taken to
an undertaker's, and will be shipped to
Nashville, Term. the old home of the de
ceased. The body was viewed by a Cor
oner's Jury, and the inquest will be held
at the same time as that of the other
victims of the fire.
The dead man was 48 years old, and was
born in Nashville. He had been a famil
iar figure on the race tracks all through
the United States, formerly as an owner
and racer of horses, and more recently
as a judge at racing contests. On the
night of the fire he retired at about 12
o'clock to his room, and was aroused by
his roommate, George Carroll, also a
sporting man. Carter wrapped a wet
sheet around himself and left the room,
but Carroll lost sight of him in the dense
smoke.
The finest emeralds known are said to
be those belonging to the Spanish crown.

HARVEY TELLS
OF BRANDES'
BRUTALITY
Startling Testimony
Is Adduced.
STORY OF MIDNIGHT CRUELTY
LILLIAN DRAGGED FJvOM HEB
BED AND BEATEN.
Mrs. Brandes Appears in Court to
Have Her Preliminary Exam
ination Continued for
One Week.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Dec. 6.
William A. Brandes. charged with beat
ing his daughter to death, marched for
ward a big pace toward the hangman's
tree to-day when his alleged fiendish bru
tality was portrayed by the startling tes
timony given by Witness J. S. Harvey,
who was called for the first time during
the preliminary hearing and who showed
considerable reluctance in answering.
Mr. ;Â»ml Mrs. Brandes had told Harvey
that Lillian, the murdered girl, was incor
rigibk', and witness had suggested that
If she were brought to account she might
ward become a good girl. Witness
then went on to give facts concerning
i iasion on which he knew the girl
had been ""brought to account." That oc
. said the witness, was just prior to
November 13.
"It happened about 1 or 2 o'clock in the
morning, said he, "when Brandes had
ju.-t returned from his watch. I was
awakened by the noise in the- room above
my apartment at Brandes' home, where
1 roomed. It sounded as though a child
waa being struck with a strap, and she
I out for mercy. I also heard Brandes
talking loud and profanely."
Thus the murdered girl had been treated
after being dragged from her bed, be
cause the father had accused her of not
only stealing a dollar, which she tried to
borrow from a baker to return, but also
$15 put away for the rent and a bottle of
Btrychnlne.
Witness Harvey had last seen Lillian
Brandes at dinner on Friday, the even
ing before she breathed her last.
â¢'She did not eat with the rest of us,
â !." continued the witness, "for, ac
cording to Mr. Brandes, she wasn't fit be
cause of the alleged theft. Her meal,
therefore, was served in the kitchen. That
day she had hunted in the back yard for
the articles she had lest.
"When Brandes knocked on my door on
Saturday morning he was excited and
said, 'Fur God's sake. Harvey, get up; the
girl has taken poison.' He was dressed
even to his tie. but was without a coat.
He went for a doctor, but I did not hear
him leave the yard with the horse.
"When Brandes again came into my
room, after Dr. Whitworth's arrival, he
paid that Lillian had taken poisonâ had
'strung herseif up.' and that the girl 'had
new spoiled her i.'hristmas.' because she
had 'stolen the money and poison.' "
In testifying as to the beating, witness
said that he heard at least a dozen blows
with an interval between each blow and
during these Brandes was very profane.
When asked as to whether Brandes was
usually ,<;ood and kind to his family, wit
ness said: "Brandes occasionally did his
family a good turn."
During this morning Mrs. M, Godfrey
was cross-examined by Attorney F. w.
Sawyer, but the latter was unable to
make this witness contradict one iota of
her testimony regarding the facts of
Lillian's terrible beating the night she
(Mrs. Godfrey) was in the parlor with
Mrs. Brandes.
The hearing will be resumed to-morrow
morning at 10 o'clock* and at its conclu
sion the preliminary examination of Mrs.
Ella Brandes will take place. The prose
cution has a separate case against her,
though many of the witnesses will be the
same. Mrs. Brandes was brought into
Justice Cliffs court this morning to have
her case continued until next Tuesday
morning.
OAKLAND'S POLICEMEN
ARE SEASONED VETERANS
CHIEF FLETCHER COMPILES HIS
ANNUAL REPORT.
The Two Youngest Officers Are Aged
Twenty-Eight Years Each â Some
Who Are Entitled to
Retirement.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Dec. 6.
Age is at present the prevailing char
acteristic of the Oakland Police Depart
ment, according to the report just pre
pared by Chief Fletcher. Of the sixty
members of the department several are
over 55 years old. One has reached 72 and
another confesses to 62, though it is be
lieved he has somewhere forgotten a few
years.
Twenty-one Oakland "finest" are native
sons; five are from Maine; nine from Ire
land; two from Germany; one from Aus
tria, and one from Africa. But the lat
ter, Officer Wood, is not a colored man.
There are some officers who, under the
law, are subject for retirement, having
passed their sixtieth year. Detective
Shoitey has just passed the limit, and has
been in the employ of the city but a few
months short of the exact half of his life.
Should Shorey retire now he would receive
a pension of $62 50 a month.
Officer Phillips is also 60 years old and
has been on the force twenty years. Offi
cer Greenwald is 62, but he has only been
in the department seventeen years and
is not therefore eligible for a pension.
Chief Fletcher is 62 years old and is
still strong and sturdy. He does not come
under the same rules as a member of the
Police Department in the matter of re
tiring, although he would now receive a
pension of $87 50 should he close his active
career.
The two youngest officers on the force
are Sherry and Pardee, who are but 28
years old and comparatively new men.
This morning the Chief applied to the
Police Commissioners to have the police
clerk appointed a regular officer. Chief
Fletcher said that every Chief's clerk In
the country has the authority of a regu
lar man and as the change means no in
crease of pay it will probably be made
especially as Chief Fletcher informed the
board that he can use a clerk with a star
in many more ways than sitting at a
desk.
Matrimonial Bonds Dissolved.
OAKLAND. Dec. 6.â Superior Judge Og
den to-day granted Lillie C. Bramhall a
divorce from Walter M. Bramhall on the
ground of habitual intemperance; also a
divorce to Josie M. Sears from Antone
J. Sears on the ground of willful neglect
In the latter case custody of three minor
children was awarded to plaintiff who
was allowed $25 for attorney fets and $20
monthly alimony.
Gertrude E. Carmen was also granted
a <}ivorce to-day from Charles \V. Carmen
oni the ground of willful neglect. Judge
Hall allowed plaintiff to resume her
maiden name, Gertrude E. Payne, and
no alimony was awarded.
Boxing at the Reliance.
OAKLAND, Dec. 6.â Wednesday evening
the Reliance Athletic Club has a fine pro
gramme for its boxing night. There will
be two tryouls and two eight-round con
tests for decisions. The main events will
be as follows: Jack McMahon, the clever
lightweight, will meet Jimmy Higgins,
Alex Greggians' crack pupil, at 128 pounds,
and Emil Dahl, who defeated George
Gates at the last night given by the club,
will meet Frank Schuler of the San Fran
cisco Athletic Club. Great interest is be
ing taken in these goes and they should
be the fastest seeu in Oakland to data.
NO CENSURE
FOR ATTENDING
A CONVENTION
Principal Fisher Is
Exonerated.
WORKED FOR DR. PARDEE
DIRECTOR CLEMENT IS NOT SAT
ISFIED.
Says He Took the Course Because an
Important Principle Is In
vclved â A Question of
Politics.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Dec. 6.
It is not opposed to public policy for
: principals of public schools to leave their
duties for a day or two and attend polit- j
leal conventions. After a long period dur-
I ing which this matter has been under j
consideration by the School Board the
Directors have decided by a big majority i
. that principals who have thus acted will
] not be censured.
The Board of Education is composed al
; most entirely of Republicans. There is
i at least one Democrat on the board, and ,
: when Principal P. M. Fisher of the Cen- |
! tral School went to Sacramento to shout ;
for Dr. Pardee the Democratic minority |
; was sorely displeased. Possibly if Prin
cipal Fisher had howled with greater suc
cesa and Dr. Pardee had been nominated
: and had now been Governor-elect of Cali
; fornia Director ClemeiM would not have
Introduced his resolution.
Director Clement has steadily pressed
: the matter since introducing his resolu
tion some months ago, and finally the
board has disposed of the incident. Prin
cipal Fisher and Principal McKissick of 'â 
: the Night School were both included in \
' the resolution recommending censure, but
neither will be disciplined. The eommit
i tee which was appointed to investigate
I the matter presented its report, which
| was very brief, last night, and merely i
I recommended that after thorough invest!- â 
>. gation it did not consider that the gentle
men in dispute had been forsaking their
1 schools or doing politics nor has the habit
j become so prevalent or the privilege so
â¢ much abused that censure is necessary.
Directors Clement and Todd took a dif
ferent view of the matter and before the
! incident closed Director Clement got in
his final rap as follows: "I am very sorry
. that anything should be brought up in this
matter that savors of political bias. I
i took this matter up not because the gen
tlemen in question were Republicans or [
Democrats, but because I considered
tht>re was a principle involved which was
being violated. If Mr. Fisher be a prin
cipal of the School Department he .
has no right to wind up his school and go
away to a political convention, leaving it
to look out for itself. I believe this mat-
I ter should be investigated and I regret i
to hear a report at this time accepted by
the board."
The incident has been generally regard- i
ed as being dependent upon whose ox is â¢
gored.
Late Dr. Slater's Widow Wins.
i ALAMEDA, Dec. 6.â The board of arbi- i
tration of the A. O. U. W. has settled in
favor of the widow the dispute over the '
life certificate of the late Dr. Thomas
Slater. The widow assigned a portion of
the death claim to Philip Seiben. finan- :
cier of Alameda Lodge No. 5, of which -
Slater was a member. When the drafts
arrived the widow refused to recogniz â¢ the
assignment to Seiben. Seiben thereupon
charged that Slater was in arrears in his
dues to the lodge at the time of his death
and that he (Seiben) had concealed the
fact from the Grand Lodge out of sympa
thy for his widow. The board of arbitra
tion gave the widow the full amount of
her husband's insurance and ignored Sei- I
ben's claim.
POTTERY MOLDED
BY WOMAN'S HAND
Unusually Fine Display of Decorative
China Painting at the California
Ceramic Art Club Exhibition.
THE ladles of the California Ceramic Art Club have exceeded their for
mer efforts in the magnificent display of decorative China painting
at their art show at the Palace Hotel. For eight consecutive
years the ladies have held an annual exhibition, and the standard they
have established was so high that even their most sanguine admirers had
been led to expect that the pinnacle of the club excellence had been reached.
The exhibition this year is conclusive proof that there is no limit to the
members' talent or artistic ability.
The Maple Hall with its beautifully arranged tables, on which are
spread the choicest specimens of the members' art, was crowded all day
yesterday. All came to learn and admire and many remained to purchase
the dainty bits that are for sale.
A new feature of this year's exhibit and one that promises to open up
magnificent possibilities for the club, is the exhibit of pottery made by
Mrs. William Irelan. The specimens of this master work are all made
from California clay and their success probably means a new California in
dustry. The vases are unique and artistic in shape and bear the impress
of the most exquisite art work. There are carved vases, hammered
vases and others with most delicate etching, all representing the artistic
spirit and original executive ability of the fair potter.
All the members of the society have exhibited their choicest work and
at every table can be found many specimens worthy of study and atten
tion. At Mrs. Church's table there are two heads that show the marked
talent of the artist. The head of Miss Church, done in Medieval style in
beautifully toned soft coloring, attracted much favorable attention. A
choir of monks in monochrome and some exquisite tankards and "stems"
are prominent in the collection.
Mrs. Theo. Gray has but few pieces on exhibition this year, but
her "Aurora" makes up by its excellence for the numerical poverty of
the exhibit.
At Mrs. Easton's table there are some exquisite plates done In Haw
thorne and pink borders that are extremely dainty and delicate. Miss Bell
shows among other things a vase with pink luster that is pronounced per
fect by art connoisseurs. At Miss Marie Thompson's table there is some
very beautiful miniature work, and a Rembrandt head In monochrome
is classed as one of the finest bits in the exhibition. Miss Helen Phillips'
"Mending the Old Flag" is the most ambitious effort of the exhibition.
The figure of the old man is perfect and the coloring effects soft and
most admirable.
Miss O'Malley shows some effective flower pieces and a very attractive
heliotrope tea set. Miss Madeline Cashman's exhibit contains some un
usually fine miniature work. Miss Nettie W. King also shows some very
beautiful miniatures. Among the many things to be admired at Miss
Evelyn M. Porter's table is a vase done in monochrome. Miss Porter has
chosen "Echo" for her subject. Her coloringâ blood redâ is beautifully
soft. A huge pitcher, all covered with rich roses, is also a much admired
piece of the lady's handiwork.
Mrs. Paul E. Scott shows some very pretty jugs in monochrome with
monk subjects, and also a very handsome crimson thistle chocolate set
and some very effective heliotrope plates with green borders.. An odd
shaped liquor jug in violet-iron and a most exquisite glaze and an at
tractive monochrome disc in green are among the many beautiful speci
mens Miss McNamara has to show. Mrs. Thomas Taylor has some tank
ards with Indian subjects in which the glaze is perfect and the coloring
beautiful. Miss Roberts shows an exquisite chocolate set, and a game set,
all of which are remarkable for the perfect blending of the colors.
Mrs. E. J. Root has on exhibition some "darky" studies that are very
popular and Miss Taylor displays some remarkably good flowers. Her
tankard and stein with mermaid and wave treatment is remarkably ef
fective.
Some very choice violet pieces are shown by Mrs. J. H. Crossett.
Mrs. M. E. Perley has one of the most extensive and artistic tables of the
whole exhibit. Mrs. Perley is famous for her raised paste work and fig
ures and she exhibits a lamp that shows her work at its best. Mrs. S. V.
Culp's exhibit contains many fruit and flower specimens, notable for their
perfect coloring. Mrs. T. J. Le Tourneaux has some very effective plates
on exhibition fn raised gold scroll work and violets.
The exhibition will continue throughout to-day.
THE SAN FRAN CISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1893.
KINARD NOW
WANTS JUSTICE
CLIFT OUSTED
Brings Charges of
Misconduct.
SAYS CLIFT WITHHELD FEES
CITATION ISSUED ORDERING DE
FENDANT TO APPEAR.
Sensations. 1 Suit Filed Against a Jus
tice Whose Term Expires
With the Close of thÂ»
Year.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Dec. 6.
A sensational suit was filed in the Su
perior Court this afternoon, wherein C. E.
Kinard prays that Justice of the Peace
Fred C. Clift be deposed on account of
various acts of alleged misconduct in
office.
What adds interest to the suit is that
it comes almost on the eve of the expira
tion of Justice Cliffs term, for on Jan
uary 1 he will be succeeded by either Mor
timer Smith or John Stetson. Hence it
will be a legal race with Justice Cliffs
natural relinquishment of office or his
ousting as a goal. At any rate, Superior
Judge Ellsworth- late this afternoon issued
a citation ordering Justice Clift to appear j
before him on the morning of December
14 at 10 o'clock. In his complaint Kinard
makes a dozen or more charges. He al
leges that during April, 1594, the suit of
C. E. Kinard vs. F. S. Holt was tried be
fore defendant Clift, who has never ren
dered a decision in the case, though Kin
ard frequently requested him so to do,
and has at all times been ready to pay
the $3 costs. He charges also that the
case of John S. Matthews against E. M. I
Paterson, heard April 26, 1593, a decision
was rendered November 6 of that year i
but entered antedated September 6, 1893;
that in the case <>t" \V. and B. Pegmen
vs. H. Hamb, charged with cruelty to ani
mals, iritd May 2Z, IS9S, Clift charged as
fees $18 instead of $6.
On October 15, 1597, C. S. Martin was
fined $20 for contempt of court. The fine,
according to Kinard's complaint, was paid ;
to Justice Clift, and entry of the trans- j
action was not made until a year later.
Plaintiff next alleges that Clift made I
illegal charge for performing marriage j
<â¢ i â  monies, the law allowing but J2, :
whereas in the following instances de
fendant ehargfed $5: February, IS9S, John j
Bianchi and Julia Griffin; March 1, IX9B,
George Sanders and Mary Stoke.s; October ;
IS, IMtS. L. L. Gilstrop and Irene May: I
September 14, 1898, John W. Stokes and
T. J. Massip; June 8, 1898, M. W. Byrne i
and E. E. Kenlock.
In conclusion Kinard alleges that de- j
fendant withheld fines and forfeitures and '
failed to turn these over to the County j
Treasurer within the proper time.
Plaintiff asks for the removal of the. j
defendant as a Justice of the Peace and '
for Judgment in the sum of $500 and costs
of suit because he was injured as a tax
payer.
At the time of the death of the late Con

Boehmer's Place Burned.
OAKLAND. Dec. 6.â The buildings of I
Fritz Boehmer's wayside resort near his
Frederichsruhe, on the Redwood Canyon
road, about half a mile above Walter
Morosco's new mansion, were burned to
the ground last night. The flames con
sumed the saloon, the main two-story
building and several other small struc
tures. The amount of the loss has not
been estimated.

MYSTERY OF THE EXPLOSION
SUPERINTENDENT C. D. KENNE
DY'S DEATH LAMENTED.
Tribute to the Noble Character of the
Manâ The Inquest Will Be
Held at San
Pablo.
The gelatine plant of the Judson Powder
Works, which was completely destroyed
in the explosion that wiped out the lives
of Superintendent Charles D. Kennedy
and five Chinese laborers Monday after
noon, is to be rebuilt at once. A gang
of men was at work bright and early
yesterday morning clearing away the
debris of the wrecked building, prepara- j
tory to the erection of a new mixing I
house, and in the course of ten days or
two weeks the plant will be again in full
operation.
The fragments of flesh and shreds of
clothing, which furnished mute and [
meager evidence of the sacrifice of human !
life which the explosion entailed, and ]
which were gathered up after the dis- j
aster by Deputy Coroner Quellin of Ala- |
meda County, will be taken to San Pablo \
in Contra Costa County Thursday, where j
an inquest will be held by Coroner |
Curry at 1 o'clock p. m. The inquest
will be a mere formality, however, as far
as ascertaining the cause of the deplor
able tragedy is concerned, for the rea
son that, as in all explosions of this
character, the only persons who could â 
throw any possible light on the mysteryj
have passed beyond the jurisdiction of j
earthly authorities.
As an official of the Judson Powder
Works Bald yesterday, the cause of the
explosion will never be known. If it
could be, future disasters of the kind
might be guarded against, but as it is, j
explosions in powder mills will continue
to occur and human lives will continue ]
to be sacrificed. Those who engage in
the actual work of manufacturing ;
high explosives knowingly take their i
lives in their hands, and explosions are \
not of sufficient rarity in California to
cause a great amount of surprise after
the first shock of horror has passed. But I
seldom has a community experienced |
such a sensation of mingled awe ntv!
grief at the death of one of its membera
its was caused by the untimely UUuag </ii
uf Charles L>. Kennedy. There is mourn
ing in the Athenian Club in Oakland, of j
which ha was a memK-r and at which he ,
resided, and there is genuine sorrow
among scores of friends and acquaint- |
anoes Who knew and appreciated the
noble character of the man.
Michael A. Kennedy, a clerk in To
briner's drug store, at the corner of
Seventh and Market streets in Oakland, is
the only relative of the deceased on the j
L'oast. Charles Kennedy hail been brother
and lather to him and the blow is doubly
severe on the young man.
"1 have heard many explosions," said
Mr. Kennedy last evening, his eyes filling
with tears as he spoke, "and never paid
any particular attention to them, but
when 1 heard that noise yesterday after- j
noon I colapsed completely, for 1 knew j
instinctively that Charley was gone."
President Lukens of the Judson Com
pany sent a message East announcing Mr.
Kennedy's death immediately after the
accident and yesterday he received a dis
patch to the effect that the family of the ,
deceased had been notified. Michael j
Kennedy also sent a message, but has us '
yet received no reply, and until he does |
no definite arrangements for the funetal
will be made.
Mr. Kennedy leaves a mother, Mrs. M.
F. Kennedy of New Bedford, Mass.; four
brothers and a sister. The latter ore:
Dr. Frank M. Kennedy and Joseph P.
Kennedy, New Bedford; John C. Ken
nedy, Boston; M. A. Kennedy, Oakland,
and Mrs. M. T. Hudner, Fall Kiver, Muss.
ALAMEDA TRUSTEES
TALKLE A TARTAR
APPOINTMENT OF CITY MAR
SHAL PRECIPITATES A ROW.
Trustee Brick Claims to Own the Po
lice Department and Says His
Colleagues Are Not
Truthful.
ALAMEDA, Dec. 6.â A1l Alameda is
agog at a disruption in the Board of City
Trustees. Trouble has been brewing for
some weeks. The members fought shy of
appointing a new City Marshal for fear
that the storm might break forth in all
its fury. Action, however, was forced up
on them and with action came the storm.
The tempest broke last night at an ex
ecutive session called for the purpose of
deciding upon changes 4n the Police De
partment, made necessary by the resig
nation of Chief Rogers. John Brick,
chairman of the police committee, started
the fuss by asserting that the patronage
belonged to him and that his colleagues
on the board should keep quiet and grit
their teeth while he made appointments
according to his own ideas. He closed his
end of the row by questioning the voracity
of the other members of the board, and,
jumping to his feet, shook his fist in
Chairman Forderer's face, shouting at
the top of his voice: "I wish you to dis
tinctly understand that you are not my
friend and never will be."
When the secret session was called to
order and its purpose had been stated.
Brick was the first to talk.
"I am chairman of the police commit
tee," he said, "and this appointment be
longs to me. I have been 'sat on' per
sistently ever since I came on this board,
and I have never been treated with any
courtesy. Sergeant Conrad, who wants
to be Marshal, asked every one o' you
to vote for him, but he did not even ask
me to support him or consult me in the
matter."
Trustees Forderer, Fletter, Clark and
Schulte denied that Conrad ever men
tioned his ambitions to them.
"I don't believe you," shouted Brick.
"I never was given a chance on this
board. I have been slighted long enough,
and this is the end of it. I am chairman
of the police committee and I will have
the appointment of Marshal as well as all
police officers."
Chairman Forderer said that inasmuch
as Brick had intimated that his colleagues
were liars, it was his opinion that Brick's
idea of courtesy was "way down." The
discussion was reaching a dangerous ten
sion when the conference broke up. The
argument was renewed on the sidewalk
in front of the City Hall, but the trustees
were led in different directions by their
friends before they came to blows.
Brick favors the appointment of Harry
Transue to the office of Marshal, while
Sergeant Conrad is the choice of the other
four members. f

MENTEL'S
SISTER
MINNIE
The Young Lady Is on Her
Way From Germany
to This City.
She Will Furnish Funds for a Vig
orous Prosecution of Her
Brother's Slayer.
A determined effort â will be made by the
Bisters of the late William Mentel to
bring about the conviction of the woman
who shot him in Alameda last Thursday
evening. The Mentels are members of
an old, wealthy family in Germany, from
which will come funds that will material
ly assist in the prosecution of the dead
man's wife. Immediately after the trag
edy a cablegram was sent to Miss Minnie
Mentel in Hamburg conveying in a mini
mum of words the sad intelligence of ncr
brother's death. Minnie was his favorite
sister, and the news that ' throbbed over
land and under sea almost prostrated her.
But she immediately cabled back that she
would start as soon as possible for San
Francisco. In all probability she 'would
be accompanied by her uncle, a wealthy
retired merchant of Hamburg. His name
is Louis Koch, a relative of the celebrated
Dr. Koch, a consumption specialist of
several years ago. Being a widower and
childless he adopted Minnie, making her
the principal heiress-presumptive of his
property. It is his intention to assist fin
ancially in the prosecution of his nephew's
â layer.
The friends of the deceased, of whom
he appears to have had a large number
in this city, are gathering evidence tend
ing to establish the fact that it was al
most morally and physically impossible
that Mantel could have abused or even
threatened to do his wife bodily harm.
He is said to have been as gentle as a
lamb and as timid as a schoolgirl. It is
claimed that his wife drove him into mat
rimony with a revolver, and held that
potent weapon over his head till the day
she shot him with it.
Prominent among those who make this
statement is John Dixon. 106 Powell street,
who waa thi- most intimate friend of the
deceased. He loaned Mentel money for
fares to San Josh, whither the couple
went to be married, and he was the last
aintfUice to speak to the pair when
they started for Alameda on that fatal
Thursday afternoon. Mr. Dixon will
state <>n the witness stand that Mrs. Men
tel, moved by her fierce and unreasonable
jealousy, menaced her husband with her
revolver till the timid fellow was in dead
ly fear for his life.
'Dr. Connor. 602 Sutter street, stated that
a week after the marriage Mentel came
to his office for safety. It was about 7
o'clock in the evening, and the young man
was frightened almost out of his few
wits. His wife was after him, he saad.
and would shoot him on sight. Presently
they saw from th^ doctor's office window
a female, her form enveloped in a dark

, Mrs. Anna Mentel has not recovered
fully from the shock she experienced a
week ago when she found that she hart
not committed suicide but had murdered
her husband. Dr. Porter has ordered that
she be kept quiet and that her visitors
be limited. Her mother is an almost daily
caller at the prison, and spends hours
with her daughter. Her father has also
visited the prisoner several times.
Although she has been formally charged
with murder, no day has been set for her
arraignment. The fact that the Coroner's
jury did not charge Mrs. Mentel with the
crime is regarded as significant, as it will
doubtless be used by her counsel to try to
secure her discharge at the preliminary
examination.

THE SAN FRAtf CISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1898.
MOORE STILL
PERSECUTING
MRS, PICKENS
Succeeds in Forcing
Her to Resign.
MEANEST ACT OF HIS CAREER
BEFUSES TO AUDIT WARRANT
FOR HER DECEMBER SALARY.
How the Special Treasury Agent Once
Managed to Secure a Feast at
the Expense of Sam
Buddell.
Major Horace A. Moore, special agent
of the Treasury Department, has suc
ceeded in driving Mrs. Pickens.thestenog
rapher in his office whom he attempted
to add to his list of victims, from the
position which enabled her to support
herself and little ones.
As chief of the office Major Moore in
dorses the salary warrant of his clerical
force. Monday Major Moore issued the
warrants, but although the lady was
regularly employed in his office and had
worked since the first of the month Moore
refused point blank to sign her warrant.
Without it she could not draw her salary,
and not having discovered the office suffi
ciently congenial to warrant her in work
ing without pay Mrs. Pickens resigned.
When she handed ,in her resignation
Mtiore told her he intended to fight her
through the newspapers. His threat did
not frighten the little woman, for she
pluckily replied that he would better find
out how many papers would support his
cause before he attempted anything of
that sort.
Mrs. Pickens talked readily yesterday
about Moore's attack upon her. and said
that as soon as she escaped from him she
went up to Bert Schlesinger's office and
asked him to protect her. Schleslnger
was then Assistant United States District
Attorney and had proved himself <â¢
stanch friend of the helpless woman on
a previous occasion. He counseled her tv
return to her duties.
Mrs. Pfckena says that last Monday, the
day The Call first narrated Moore's mis
deeds, a reporter on one of the morning
papers, who is on exceedingly friendly
terms with Moore, abused her roundly for
having charges preferred against the
major and sought to browbeat her into
admitting them untrue. She would not
be intimidated, however. Though driven
| from Moore's office Mrs. Pickens will not
vwSor, fa? 'riir:ds have already secured
her a better position.
Since The Call's exposure of Major
Moore innumerable stories of his miscon
duct are in circulation.
Around the Custom House, the em
ployes, without exception, say there was
nothing too mean for the major to stoop
to. and one story told on Sam Ruddell,
former deputy collector under W. D. Eng
lish, fairly illustrated the kind of man
Moore is. The story is true in every par
ticular. On one occasion Moore insisted
that Ruddell become his guest at lunch.
On the way up the street Ruddell asked
Moore in to have an appetizer, and the
deputy took a cocktail. At the restau
rant the major requested Ruddell to order
luncheon. Ruddell selected a pair of
sprigs. When the fowls were finally
served Ruddell ordered a small bottle of
Burgundy, while the major called for a
lemonade sweet.
Luncheon disposed of, Major Moore
arose from his seat without taking the
check for the meal, an oversight Ruddell
corrected. Not only that, but Sam later
bought the cigars for the two.
Fitzgerald's Body Recovered.
The body of John Fitzgerald, the boiler
maker who fell overboard from the wharf
at the Intersection of Spear and Bryant
streets last Monday night, was recovered
yesterday morning. It was taken to the

Ten of the twelve jurymen required to
pass judgment on the evidence to be pre
sented for and against Mrs. Cordelia Bot-
Even the Gallery Was Filled With
Spectators.
kin, accused of murdering: Mary Elizabeth
Dunning, were secured yesterday in
Judge Carroll Cook's court. Nine of these
were sworn In before the noon recess. In
all probability the jury will be completed
at this morning's session, and, after the
opening statement by Assistant District
Attorney Hosmer, the taking of testi
mony will begin thsi afternoon.
The personnel of the jury as far as se
lected is a guarantee that Mrs. Botkin
will secure a fair and impartial trial and
that justice, based upon testimony, will be
given her. Few juries are composed of as
representative men as those who have
given their oaths to perform their duty in
this case.
The proceedings yesterday, while wholly
formal, were watched intently by the
large crowd which filled the court room.
The appearance of John P. Dunning, with
Chief Lees, soon after court opened, sent
a thrill of expectancy through the audi
ence, all of whom expected a highly dra
matic scene when he came face to face
with his former paramour, whom he now
accuses of murdering his wife. Both the
principals in this tragic trial were pre
pared for this ordeal, which was sure to
come, and they suppressed all manifesta
tion of the turbia feelings which must
have surged within them. But the great
er strain is impending. When Dunning
takes the witness stand and tells under
oath all the salacious details of. his rela
tionÃ with the defendant it will be
strange, indeed, if a scene seldom wit
nessed in a court room is not enacted.
Ex-Congressman Pennington, father of
the murdered woman, was also an inter
esting and interested spectator at
the trial yesterday. He could not
restrain his curiosity to see the woman
who had caused his son-in-law to vio
late his sacred marriage vows and who
is now before the bar of justice awaiting
a decision which may condemn her as the
wanton murderess of his children. Mr.
Pennington gazed intently at Mrs. Botkin
every time he got an oportunity to see her
features, and when court took a recess at
noon he waited in the corridor to get a
square look at her, and his impressions
were neither favorable to her nor compli
mentary to Dunning's taste.
Several of the Delaware witnesses also
attended court yesterday and watched the
proceedings with evident Interest. Drs.
Down, Wolf and Bishop accompanied Mr.
Pennington and as soon as their identity
became known they were the center of in
terest to curious spectators. They were
not as surprised at the rapid progress in
securing a jury as were the Californians
present, as the Delaware courts do not
waste any time In trial preliminaries.
Mrs. Botkin, attired in black, and her
sister were almost the first persons in the
court room. The defendant's anpearance
is not as healthful as when she was ar
rested. Lack of fresh air has given her
an unwonted pallo- and she seems to lack
the vitality and vivacity which were her
predominant characteristics when she
was first accused of the crime for which
she is now on trial. She takes an active
interest in the court proceedings most of
the time, but frequently assumes an in
different attitude and lapses into an easy
position. When the jurors were interro
gated on their scruples as to inflicting
capital punishment on a woman she
scanned each face intently, and when the
talesman declares he is already convinced
of her guilt she looks at him with defiant
scorn.
Once yesterday she seemed to feel the
gravity of her position. When Assistant
District Attorney Hosmer told the tales
men they were to be examined on their
fitness to pass judgment on "Mrs. Corde
lia Botkin, who sits here, charged with
administering poison which caused the
death of Mary Elizabeth Dunning." she
dropped her head on her hand, remaining
with her head bowed until the prosecu
tor had completed reading the indictment.
All the witnesses in the case have been
ordered to be present at 2 p. m. to-day.
Unless present plans are changed John B.
Pennington will be the first witness to
testify for the prosecution.
Attorney Knight for the defense said
last night that the trial would be over in
a week. He will make every effort toward
a rjulck trial, as he feels absolutely cer
tain the defendant will be acquitted. Mr.
Knight denies the report published in an
afternoon paper that he will withdraw
from the case as soon as the jury is
completed. He will continue in charge of
the defense until the case is finally dis
posed of.
Promptly at 10 o'clock Judge Cook en
tered the court room and Bailiff Wheeler
rapped for order. Mrs. Botkin, her sis
ter and Attorneys Knight and Wheeler
had taken their seats in front of the bar
several minutes before the hour set for
the beginning of the trial. Assistant Dis
trict Attorney Hosmer arrived a moment
behind the Judge and he was followed an
instant later by Chief of Police Lees and
J. P. Dunning, the principal witness for
the prosecution. Dunning passed direct
ly behind the woman accused of poisoning
his wife and took a seat immediately in
front of the jury box. in plain view of his
former inamorata and the whole audience
He was recognized by a number of peo
ple and a subdued buzz which followed his
appearance caused every eye to turn in
his direction. Then a couple of hundred
inquisitive glances were alternately fo
cused on him and on the defendant" who
sat with downcast eyes, gazing abstract
edly at the ribbing on the back of her
gloves. Mrs. Botkin looked up at this
interesting juncture and saw Dunning co
suiting with the prosecuting officer. At
the same instant Dunning raised his eves
and squarely met the quizzical glance' of
the woman, once his friend, but no sign
of recognition was apparent on either of
their faces. Neither of the principals
in the sensational trial showed any per
turbation or gave any indication of ner
vousness at the approaching ordeal which
both must go through.
Mrs Botkin, in response to a whispered
question from Lawyer Wheeler, nodded
affirmatively at Dunning, who was look
ing toward the gallery. Wheeler nudged
Knight and the two legal luminaries
scornfully scrutinized the man who will
â¢it\,M?vi f ha l" eful stalls of his relations
with their client and why he believes she
may be a murderess.
While this silent and semi-dramatic
Rcene was being enacted the court officials
were busy preparing to proceed with the
preliminaries of the selection of a a jury
Judge Cook ordered spectators to take
seats in the gallery, and leave the down
stairs seats for jurymen. As soon as or
der was restored his Honor formally call
ed the case.
T. T " R ?? dy> " answ ered Oeorge Knight, and
Mr. Hosmer did likewise, adding that At
torney General R. H. White of Delaware
had arrived in the city, and he wished

of the defendant. The defense acquiesced
In the request, and a few moments later
when Mr. White entered, he was formally
introduced to the court, and took a seat
beside Mr. Hosmer. Court Clerk Tolle
called the roll of the talesmen who had
been summoned for jury duty, and the
majority of them answered present

did not indicate his policy in this case.
His questions led to the belief that ne
would be satisfied with any twelve im
partial citizens who had not formed opin
ions which required the defendant to in
troduce evidence of her innocence before
the people's case was submitted. His ex
aminations were short and incisive, and
there was no bickering over questions
propounded by either side.
Every man in the jury box during the
day admitted having read the extraaition
proceedings in the newspapers, and quite
a number admitted having formed unal
terable opinions that Mrs. Botkin is guil
ty. These men were, of course, excused,
W. S. Kittle, the first talesman exam
ined, said he was a classmate of J. P.
Dunning in college, and that he had been
an intimate friend of his wife. He was
excused by consent.
Five jurors were accepted and sworn in
out of the first twelve who entered the
box, and when the noon recess was taken
nine citizens had taken an oath to give
the defendant a fair and impartial trial,
and also to give her the benefit of a rea
sonable doubi as required by law. The
remarkably rapid progress made in se
curing a jury in so celebrated a case was
extremely pleasing to all concerned and
was also the subject of favorable com
ment by attorneys and others who had
gone to Judge Cook's court expecting the
usual wrangle and delay in getting twelve
men who would be satisfactory to both
prosecution and defense. During the
forenoon session the people used five of
the ten peremptory challenges allowed,
while the defense used only one, though
they are entitled to twenty. When a ju
ror was challenged by either side Judge
Cook would take him in hand and en
deavor to ascertain why opinion had been
formed or why circumstantial evidence
would not be considered. His Honor felt
that the reasons given were mere sub
terfuges to evade serving on the jury
and only when compelled to do so under
the law did he excuse the individual.
At 12 o'clock.after admonishing the nine
jurors who had been sworn in not to talk
about the Botkin case and not to read the
case in the papers, Judge Cook declared
a recess until 2 p. m. Promptly on the
moment his Honor took his seat and or
dered the case to proceed. But Mr.
Knight was tardy and his Honor sent the
bailiff to call him. He arrived in three
or four minutes, but Mr. Hosmer was still
absent. Judge Cook ordered Attorney Gen
eral AVhlte to proceed with the examina
tion of jurors. The latter demurred .saying
he preferred that Mr. Hosmer should con
duct the case.
"Mr. Hosmer knows the court convenes
at 2 o'clock." emphatically declared his
Honor, "and I will not tolerate any delay
of this sort. Proceed, Mr. White."
Mr. White was taken conipleielv by
surprise, and was at a loss how to begin.
He is not familiar with the Caiilomta
method of drawing a jury, which is quite

different from the Delaware system. He
asked two or three questions which ha
remembered had been used by Mr. Hos->
mer and was compelled to turn to George
Knight for assistance. Knight prompted
the Delaware official on formal questions,
and together they managed to kill time
until Mr. Hosmer arrived and relieved
his associate of further embarrassment
and responsibility.
The progress made during the morning
session did not continue during the after
noon, only one additional juror being se
cured. A score or more of talesmen were
t:xamined, but they proved unsatisfactory
and were either challenged or excused by
consent. During the day each side used five
peremptory challenges, the prosecution
not using any in the afternoon. Those
challenged by the prosecution were: John
Quardt, C. M. Levy, L. F. Fogg. J. .k.
Wilson and C. S. Bassett, all because of
their disposition to disregard circumstan
tial evidence unless it was absolutely in
controvertible. The defense challenged D.
Bloch because of an opinion already
formed as to the defendant's guilt; G. G.
Wickson. because he thought a Grand
Jury's indictment was a strong indication
of guilt; Charies Mattheas. for bias; E. J.
Sohultz, for bias, and D. M. Farnsworth,
by courtesy of Mr. Knight.
Among the men who were examined but
got out of serving for one cause or an
other were: Rolla V. Watt, who was
prejudiced against the defense; Jacob
Gordon, defective hearing; F. "W. Wright,
opposed to capital punishment; B. J.
Gunn, prejudice; J. K. Prior, opposed to
conviction on circumstantial evidence;
Charles Brown, opposed to capital pun
ishment: A. W. Moore, would not inflict
death penalty on a woman: Colonel A. G.
Hawes, opinion already formed: J. K.
Wilson. Henry Lackmann. Oliver Eld
ridge, W. S. Duval, J. F. Moran. Colonel
George Stone, A. C. Bush. William M.
Weil, John H. Grady and others because
they had read the newspapers and had
formed opinions.
At 3:20 the names in the jury box were
exhausted and a recess was taken until
10 a. m. to-day. Before adjourning Judge
Cook said that 25 or SO talesmen who had
been summoned had not answered and he
believed the jury could be completed
without another venire being ordered.
Clerk Tolle was directed to notify all the
absentees to be in court this morning.
Among the talesmen who failed to re
spond when their names were called were:
Thomas Magoe, G. H. T'mbsen. B. M.
Johnson. W. M. Frank. S. Jacobs J. S.

excused.
