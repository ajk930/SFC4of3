CoQVoy Considerable Car) Be
Done Before l^einforce
mer)ts Arrive.
NEW YORK. July 24.â A Washington special to the Her
ald says: Major General Miles, commanding the Porto Rico
expedition, is believed to have arrived at the port of debarka
tion decided upon on the const of Porto Rico. Adjutant General
Corbin, however, said to-day the administration did not expect
to hear from him for several days, owing to the distance that he
would have to send to reach a cable station.
Although General' Miles has less than 5000 effective fight
ing men with him, the officials of the War Department are con
fident he will be able to accomplish all he expected to do before
the arrival of reinforcements. He will establish his landing
bases under the protection of the guns of the naval convoy that
accompanied him.
Tli f landing is so far from San Juan that it will be
impossible for the Spanish commander to concentrate enough
<ps to make much resistance, and before troops could be
sent from San Juan General Miles would be reinforced by the
troops which the War Department is sending after him as rap
idly as possible.
""neral Brooke, who. is to be in command at Porto Rico,
has not yet arrived at Newport News, and it will be Wednesday
at the. -earliest before General Haines' brigade is all loaded on the
transports and is ready to start. His brigade will be followed as
soon as possible by General Fred Grant's brigade.
< n neral Shafter is sending enough transports from Santi
ago to Tampa to earn- 6000 men. It is not probable, however,
that more than half this number will go to Porto Rico from
:-a. as three regiments from there are to go to Santiago.

The Third Brigade of the First Divis

eral Wade, It was authoritatively stat
ed to-night, received orders at a late
hour this evening to rush this brigade
to Newport News as promptly as pos
sible. The brigade consists of the First

It is the understanding that the First
Brigade of the Second Division will be

ent plan regiments will continue to go
cut as f.iPt as practicable until the first
corps is exhausted.
It was raining most of to-day at

One hundred and sixty-two patients

WHY WATSON'S
DEPARTURE HAS
BEEN POSTPONED.
Reiteration by Germany of Strict
Neutrality and Desire to Place
Sfyps in the Best Condition.
NEW YORK, July 24.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald sends
the following: Two important develop
ments? are responsible io~r th<* post
ponement by the President of the' date
of departure of the Eastern squadron â
the reiteration by Germany of hÂ«r
strict neutrality and the desire of the
naval war board to place the vessels
un,der command of Commodore Watson
In ,the best possible condition before
serJidlng them abroad. The authorities
no^v declare that there is no reason for
harete in sending the ships abroad, and
that while the vessels are in fighting
tri m, It is advisable to put them in
flrrst-class cruising condition and that
the President would determine the date
widen they will leave. It was confi
dently announced to-day- that the next
ten days will reveal the ships which
will be attached to Commodore Wat
son's command. Much depends upon
their condition, and the developments
in Cuba, the Philippines and Europe.
, So far as the authorities can now see,
th â¢ political situation in Europe is
rtiorft favorable to the United States
than it has been at any time since the
dommencement of the war. The collec- j
tilon of such a large number of war
ghlpfl in the vicinity of Spain by the
European powers is not considered a
menace to the United States. Undoubt
edly, the officials ray, they have gone
to that point for observation purposes
and to protect their many interests
afloat and ashore. They give it as their
opinion that no power will Interfere
with the operations of Commodore

SHAFTER EXPLAINS
THE BANISHMENT
SANTIAGO, July 24.â General Shaf
ter pave me a cordial reception when I
called upon him to-day. He said the
expulsion of correspondents was caused
not because of any feeling toward the
newspapers represented, but owing to
the conduct of the reporters personally.
"One correspondent was a nuisance
to every one during the entire cam
paign and was guilty," he said, "of in
solence to a member of my staff and in
solent to me personally and struck at
me. This made him liable to be shot
Without trial. I did not desire to take
an extreme measure, though his action
richly deserved it.
"The othor correspondents were!

rested and sent home on the first trans
port. This is all I have to say about the j
incident.".
BANISHMENT OF
YELLOW FELLOWS
FROM SANTIAGO.
Punishment Meted Out by General
Shafter Considered Too Merci
ful by Army Officials.
NEW YORK, July 24.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
telegraphs: Secretary Alger received
to-day from Major General Shafter
an official report regarding the ban
ishment from Santiago de Cuba of
Sylvester Scovel, representing the
New York World, and the corre
spondents and artists of the New-
York Journal. The Secretary de
clined to make public the text of the
dispatch, but I learned the nature of
its contents. General Shafter report
ed that Scovel attempted to partici
pate in the ceremony of hoisting the
flag over the Governor's palace in the
city, but was ordered down by the
guard. He then sought General
Shafter. Words passed between the
two and Scovel struck at General
Shafter, his blow fortunately falling
short. He was immediately placed
under arrest. General Shafter stated
he had not ordered the man's trial
for the reason that he did not wish
to give him that much notoriety, and
had simply ordered his expulsion
from the district under his com
mand.
The banishment of the correspond- I
ents and artists of the New York
Journal was dua to their action in
posting In conspicuous places
thro\ighout Santiago a large poster
bearing the -words, "Remember the
Maine." General Shatter ordered that
they be torn down, fearing they !
might have a bad effect upon the >
residents of the city and the Spanish
prisoners, and as a measure of pub
lic safety directed the expulsion cf
the offenders.
War Department Â©fficials say that I
in both cases General Shafter acted
â with dignity and discretion, but they
believe that in the case of Scovel
he should have made his punishment
more severe.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, July 24.â
Scovel is the only World man ex
pelled from Santiago de Cuba. It is
decreed in his case that he shall not
again eater the military lines or
board the warships. The three Jour
nal men expelled were McNichol,
Mesher and Jffusgrave. They landed
in Santiago Monday night to open a
business office with 20,000 Journals
and colored posters showing the
wreck of the Maine with dead sailors
floating past. The inscription at the
top was "Bemember the Maine," and
at the bottom "Buy the Journal."
As soon as Shafter saw the posters i
he sent a detail of soldiers to arrest
the Journal men and seize their para
phernalia. The correspondents were
placed under guard ovsr night in the
Theatre F-oyal. The next day Shafter
himself saw them placed aboard the
Arkansas with Scovel. In sending
them into exile Shafter shouted, "The
Journal is ex-communicated from
Santiago.**

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July 24.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs as follows: "General Shafter
with the Fifth Corps will take the field
against Havana in the fall. Until then
the corps will rest in the United States.
As soon as the Spanish prisoners are
well out of the way General Shafter
with the -whole Fifth Corps will be or
dered back to the United States, per
haps to Montauk Point, Long Island, or
some such suitable place, where they
will rest and recuperate, so as to be
ready for the campaign in the fall
against Havana."
This statement was made to me by
one of the trusted counselors of the
President. The further statement was
made that not one of the regiments
now in Santiago would be sent to
Porto Rico; that it was thought by the
administration that in all of them
there was some danger of fever infec
tion. General Shafter will remain until
the Spanish prisoners arc disposed of,
according to the present plans of the
Government.
Many northerly camp sites are being
considered by the Government, Sea
Girt, N. J., among them. It may be
necessary to bring more Southern
troops north, but they will not be
brought unless it is necessary.
The Fifth Corps of hardened veter
ans is to be put into shape for the
Havana campaign. The Porto Rican
army also will be by fall hardened to
field and fire, and, with the Fifth Corps,
which will then join it, about 50.000 sea-
Boned men will move upon Havana.
This now the plan of the adminis
tration. These 50,000 men will form the
nucleus about which 100,000 more vol
unteers now in this country will be
formed. By fall these volunteers, it is
expected, will be in prime condition,
both as to equipment, arms and uni
forms. If the Porto Rican campaign is
to be a deliberate one, the campaign
against Havana is to be a more delib
erate one.
General Miles trill be commander-in
chief of the Havana campaign and will
start in with two trained major gen
erals In Generals Shifter and Brooke.
Lee will follow wit^ another division
and Graham with the Camp Alger
troops and 2000 men left In Chicka

total of 150,000 men.

FOREIGN POLICY
OF THIS NATION
TO BE DISCUSSED
Civic Federation of Chicago Is
sues a Call for a National
Conference.
CHICAGO, July 24.â The Civic Fed
eration of Chicago to-night gave out a
call for a national conference to be'
held at Saratoga Springs, N. V., Aug
ust 19 and 20 to discuss the future for
eign rolicy of the United States. The
call is signed by over 1000 men in every
State in the Union. It says:
The undersigned deem it necessary that
n national conference be convened at an
early day to consider the future of the
gn policy of the United States. The
war with Spain gives promise of the over
throw of Spanish power In Cuba, Porto
Rico, the Philippines and other of that
country's colonial possessions. The ques
tion of what disposition the I'nited States
should make or tnese possessions when
peace is reached is none too soon in en
gaging the thought of our people. The
question Impresses us ax being one of the
most serious the Aemrican people have
had to consh:. r. It is a new question, and
one on which heretofore very little
thought has been bestowed by the great
majority of our people. Whether the for
eign policy of the "fathers" should be ad
hered to or departed from is enough to
challenge the most careful consideration
r ablest and thougthful men.
In our opinion this conference should be
composed of men from all parts of the
country, without respect to party affilia
tions, whether they are for or against a
policy of territorial expansion, and men
whoso ability, position and character en
title their opinions to the respectful con
sideration of the peonle.

SANTIAGO DE CUBA, July 22.â The
following 1b Major General SnaXter's
Drder, Just published:
Headquarters United States Troops In
Cuba, Santiago de Cuba, July 19, 1838.
3eneral Order No. 26.
The successful accomplishment of the
campaign against Santiago, resulting in
Its downfall and the surrender of the
Spanish forces and the capture of large
amounts of military stores, together with
the destruction of the entire Spanish fleet
n the harbor, which upon the investment
of the city was forced to leave, is one of
which this army can well be proud. This
has been accomplished through the heroic
deeds of the army, and to its officers and
men the major general commanding of
fers his sincere thai.ks for their endur
ance of hardships heretofore unknown in
the American army. The work we have
accomplished may well appeal to the
pride ot your countrymen; it has been
rivaled on few occasions in the world's
history.
ling upon an unknown coast, you
fac-d dangers in embarking and overcame
obstacles that, even in looking back,
insurmountable. Seizing, with the
assistance of the navy, the towns of Bai
quiri and Siboney, you pushed boldly
forth, gallantly driving back the enemy's
outpost in the engagement of La Quaslna
and completing the concentration of the
enemy neaj Sevilla, within sight of the
Spanish stronghold at Santiago de Cuba.
The outlook from Sevilla was one that
might well have appalled the stoutest
heart. Behind you ran a narrow road,
made well nigh impassable by rains,
while to the front you looked out upon
high foothills covered with a dense trup-
Ical growth which couid only be traversed
by bridle paths terminating within range
of tiie enemy's guns.
Nothing deterred, you responded eager
ly to the order to close upon the foe, and,
attacking at Caney and San Juan, druve
him fniiii work to work until he took
refuge within his last and strongest in
trenehmenie, immediately surrounding
the city. Despite the fierce glare of a
southern sun and rains that fell in tor
rents you valiantly withstood his at
tempU to drive you from the position
valor bad won. Holding in your
vise-like grip the army oppos'"* to you,
after seventeen days of battle and siege,
you were rewarded by the surrender of
nearly 24,000 prisoners, 12,000 being tbose
In your immediate front, the others scat
tered in the various towns of Eastern
Cuba, freeing completely the eastern part
of the island from Spanish troops.
This was not done without great sacri
fices. The death of 230 gallant soldiers
and the wounding of 1814 shows but too
plainly the fierce contest In which you
were engaged. The few reported missing
are undoubtedly among tht dead; no
prisoners were lost.
For those who have fallen In battle
with you the commanding general sor
rows, and with you will ever cherish
their memory. Their devotion to duty
sets a high example of courage and pa
triotism to our fellow-countrymen. All
who have participated in the campaign,
battle and sifge of Santiago de Cuba will
recall with pride the grand deeds shared
from the sufferings, hardships and tri
umphs together. All may well feel proud
to Inscribe on their banners the name of
Santiago de Cuba. By command of

TAMPA, Fla., July 24.â A high official
was asked to-day what his idea was of
the recent orders orderin-g troops from
this place. He said that he had it from
headquarters that there was a consid
erable change in many ways. To begin
with, the army was to be moved from
Santiago as quickly as possible. It is
to go to the mountains of North Caro
lina, where the yellow fever will be i
stamped out entirely. This is to be done
in about a month and the men given a j
good rest. Then they are to fall on
Porto Rico or Havana, whichever place
may need them.

waving from her foremast. She was
churtered from the Red D line by the
Ward line, which has for many years
operated a service to Southern Cuba in
connection with the Havana and Mexican
service.
It was a noteworthy substitution to
have the American colors replace the
Spanish emblem, which was flown on the
Ward liners. The crowd on the pier broke
into ch,eers as the colors were raised on
the Philadelphia as she turned her bow
down the East River.

THE SAIST FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JULY 25, 18H8.
REVIEWING THE
WAR SITUATION
Progress Made Highly
Satisfactory.
MODERN ARMS WONDERFUL
BRAVERY OP OTJR SOLDIERS
MAGNIFICENT.
General Henry Praises Shafter and
the Officers and Men Under
Him in the Santiago
Campaign. Â«
WASHINGTON, July 24.â With the
week just closed the United States saw
the end of the third month of the war
With Spain, and the responsible offi
cials, from the President down to the
lowest employe â¢ who has had to do
with shaping the course of events, feel
nothing but satisfaction at' the prog
ress made. An army of a quarter of a
million men has been mobilized, armed
and equipped and much of it has seen
service.
The battles preceding the capture of
Santiago have been remarkable in
many respects, and in the opinion of
military experts have covered the
United States army engaged with in
effaceable glory. Modern warfare of a
type developed in these engagements
was absolutely new and untried, not
only to the United States but to the
world. No such charge is recorded in
history as that made upon the fort and
blockhousese crowning the hills of El
Caney. There have been engagements
between trained troops and savage
races in the Jungles of India and on the
hills of South Africa of late years that
conveyed in a slight manner the possi
bilities of modern weapons, but those
battles fought by the Fifth Army
Corps have been the first in which
large bodies of troops of civilized na
tions on both sides have been engaged
with all the implements of modern
warfare, and the result is bound to be
highly instructive to the military stu
dent and to extort admiration for the
splendid fighting qualities of the
United States soldiers from the most
unwilling critics.
Few officers in any army have had
more experience in hard fighting, es
pecially in rough country, than that
old Indian fighter, Genen.l Henry,
so that some weight must be attached
to the opinion of the merits of our
officers and troops expressed by him to
Adjutant General Corbln, in a letter
dated in front of Santiago, Ju. 12:
We had a pleasant sail down, but, hav
ing to row the men ashore. It took some
time to get off. We left Slboney at 2
p. m. yesterday with the Eighth' Ohio,
and came into camp here about three
miles from the front. In company with
General Brecklnridge, I rode to the front
to General Wheeler's headquarters, and,
a flag of truce being up. had an oppor
tunity to see the lines. We are almost
on top of themâ the front of Wheeler be
ing about SOO yards to themâ but the
country is rough, going down to a fall
ing and ascending, nil covered by their
fire. The country all the way is the
roughest I ever saw. We have" to follow
roads or trails and'come under heavy fire,
their position commanding every ap
proach. The work done by these troops
since landing, their heroism and patience
under discomforts, heat and rain, rails
fr: the highest praise, and the work ac
coinpllshed by Shatter, his pertinacity
and "goaheadedness" under adverse cir
cumstances and discomforts, is a revela
tion to me. I doubt if there is another
officer who would have "gotten there" as
h.- did.
Our loss was most unfortunate, but
from the character of the country could
not be avoided, "If we had to get there."
Last night the Eighth Ohio were al
most drowned out, and It pours to-day;
that's the climate, and to get out of it it
would be cheaper to lose more by fight
ing and success than by illness which is
to come by staying. We have about
thirty capes of yellow fever and many of
malaria, but the men are cheerful. Gen
eraJ Duffleld and Captain Wilcox have
yellow feverâ they say in a mild form
got from sleeping in the infected build
ings, which are now tn be burned.
Misa Clara Barton and Mrs. Addison
Porter rode to the front yesterday In rtn
army wagon over rough roads and rain
ing: they are unselfish women. Tod
much credit cannot be given the hero-
Ism, pluck and patience of those who
have borne the brunt of this work.
NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED
NEW CASES OF FEVER
As the Deaths Number Only Four,
the Epidemic Evidently Is of a
Mild Type.
WASHINGTON. July 24.â A dispatch
received to-night by Adjutant General
Corbin says that 396 new cases of fever of
all classes were reported in the camp be
fore Santiago yesterday. As the same
dispatch reports only four deathsâ and
none of them from yellow fever â
from among the hundreds of cases of
fever known to exist in camp, the war
authorities are more than ever inclined
to the belief that the cases of yellow
fever are of a mild type.
Previous dispatches from General
Shafter and the medical officers of his
corps have indicated the existence In
camp of a very large niimber of cases of
malarial fever and dengue fever, the
latter being peculiar to the Cuban
climate. Some clear cases of yellow fever
are reported, but the officials say they
are few as compared with those of other
fevers.
General Shafter's dispatch, as made
public by Adjutant General Corbln, foI
Â°"SANTIAGO DE CUBA (via HaytH,
July 24. â Number of new cases of fever of
al! classes for yesterday approximately,
396. Deaths not previously reported:

FRIENDLY TERMS
OF A NOTE FROM
KAISER WILHELM
President McKinley Pleased by a
Communication Received
From Berlin.
WASHINGTON, July 24.â Emperor
William has sent a message to Presi
dent McKinley which is exceedingly
gratifying in tone. It was communi
cated to the President on Friday, just
before the Cabinet meeting, by the Ger
man Embassador, Yon Hollenben. The
exact nature of the communication can
not be learned. It is guarded with ex
ceptional care and precautions have
been taken to prevent even an intima
tion of the character of the message
escaping official circles.
From this it is believed that the com
munication may be the forerunner of
others from which the administration
expects important results, and that it
is the beginning of negot: - ns of a
weighty character. All that is known
now is that the message was most
friendly in tone, and that its receipt
haÃ given great pleasure to the Presi
dent and his advisers. Officially there
has been no correspondence between
Washington and Berlin which has been
stiff or unfriendly.
The conduct of German ships in the
Philippines appears to be a matter thus
far solely between Admiral yon Diede
richs and Admiral Dewey. The gov
ernment at Washington has made no
representations to the government at
Berlin with regard to the incident in
Subig Bay, and the wisdom of this re
straint appears now in the friendly ap
proaches which have just been made.
If it be true, as observers in London in
timate, that Germany and England are

MAKES A PLEA TO M'KINLEY â¢
SUPPLEMENT TO THE GARCIA
LBTTEB.
Shows a Hungry Desire to Despoil
Santiago â Shafter's Firm Stand
Commended by the
Populace.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, July 23.â The
document which is being circulated for
signatures among Cuban residents in
Santiago addressed to the President of
the United States thanking him for the I
co-operation of the army of the United I
States and expressing the hope that the
American Government will recognize
Cuban sovereignty in the surrendered
portion of the province of Santiago de
Cuba, was drafted by Aras, the news
paper correspondent on the staff of the
Cuban general, Castillo, who directed
the alleged letter of protest from Gen
eral Garcia to General Shafter. The
following is the text of the document:
To President MclCinley: The under
signed, Cubans by birth, land owners and
residents of Santiago de Cuba, represent
ing with their families the non-combatant
population that suncred for many years
Spanish rule in this section of the island,
wish to express their warmest thanks to
the people of the United States for de
livering them from the insufferable yoke
of Spanish rule.
They wish also to express their absolute
confidence in the good faith and humani
tarian purposes of the United Slates and
in the pledge that territory of Cffba is not
to be conquered by the American troops
for purposes of annexation. We believe
and would urge that our own people are
capable of fuliilling the international obli
gation to establish a government for the,
island. Cuba in the future may possibly
become, in the course of a few years, part
of the territory of the United States, thus
increasing the comfort and happiness oi!
this people, but now all desire a govern
ment of our own, as compensation for the
sufferings and heroism of our army and
the definite establishment of the Cuban
republic with Cuban authorities in ac
cordance with the resolutions of the
United States Congress.
We hope that the present state of af
fairs at Santiagoâ where Spaniards are
still the administrators of our interests,
property and fateâ will be brief; that the
city may soon be turned over to the Cu
bans, and that our army may enter with
the flag of Cuba waving triumphantly be
side the American flag, as Cuban soldiers
fought side by side with the Americans
against the common enemy.
General Shafter's refusal to permit
the entrance of armed Cubans into
Santiago is an extremely wise one in
these excited days, as there might be
trouble. Unarmed persons, however,
are free to enter at all times. As soon
as the Spanish soldiers have embarked
Cubans will be allowed to enter the
city freely. The first embarkation is
expected next Thursday, in accordance
with a contract made between the
United States and the Spanish Trans
i atlantic company.
The United States transport Santiago
left this morning fY>r Newport News
with sick and wounded. The steamer
Jamaica arrived to-day with passen
gers from Jamaica and proceeded to
Guantanamo with provisions for the
United States fleet.
To-day the Spaniards turned over
their cavalry horses. Only 143 were
surrendered. The others have been
killed for food for the army.
GROSVENOR NOT GOING
AS M'KINLEY'S ENVOY
No Truth in the Story That He Is
to Broach an Anglo-Saxon
Alliance.
NEW YORK, July 24.â The Washington
correspondent of the Herald telegraphs:
General Grosvenor of Ohio arrived in
Washington this morning* on his way to
New York, whence he will sail on Tues
day for England. I saw him after he
had called at the White House to say
good-by to the President. He said the
story that he was going abroad as pro
visional representative of the President
to talk to members of the BritlÃh Govern
ment about an Anglo-American alliance
was without foundation, as he was going
for a short rest and would be in London
not more than a week at the most.
coming close together, the visit of Era
bassador yon Hollenben to the White
House on Friday may be a diplomatic
incident of the very highest import
ance.
This is not the only diplomatic inci
dent of recent occurrence which may
have an important bearing on the
progress of the war. There is reason to
believe that informal intimations have
been made by the representatives of
certain European Governments with
regard to the purpose of sending Wat
son's fleet across the Atlantic, which,
while they were in no way protests or
objections, betrayed a mild curiosity
as to the destination of the fleet, and
made it seem advisable to the admin
istration to defer for a time the send
ing of Watson on his European mis
sion.
The semi-oflicial announcemrnt that
the fleet was not to bombai'd Spanish
cities and was not directed offensively
against the Spanish coast is believed
to have been drawn out in a manner by
these intimations and to have been in
tended as an indirect response to them.
So long as the object of the visit to
European waters is to meet and de
stroy or capture the ships under Ca
mara's command there can be no pos
sible objection on the part of any neu
tral European power, and, this assur
ance having been given, the United
States will be in a position later, if
need be, to intimate that the Euro
pean powers might advantageously use
their influence with Spain to bring her
to ask that a devastating war be
brought to an end.

GOULD GIVES INSTRUCTIONS
SUNDAY CONFERENCE AT THE
ASYLUM.
Detective Frost Expected to Give
Testimony That Will Be of
Great Assistance to Dr.
Sponogle.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, July 24.â Trustees Gould,
Curnow and Hale and Dr. Sponogle
had lunch together at Agnews Asylum
to-day and afterward held a confer
ence. The coming investigation was the
sole subject of discussion. Trustee
Gould, with his usual cunning, outlined
the programme to be followed.
It is expected the charges of immoral
conduct against Mrs. Madigan and
Tourtiliott will be taken up and dis
posed of in a couple of hours. Then Dr.
Sponogle will demand that the charges
against him of the alleged killing
of his first wife for her life
insurance and the ruining of a
girl in Fresno will be investigated.
Then, as Trustee Gould has dictated,
Detective Erwin Frost will be called to
the stand. He will back down from his
previous statement about Dr. Sponogle,
and, in order to wash his hands of the
affair, will swear that he was hired by
Trustee White to dig up evidence
against the medical director's charac
ter.
The Trustees to-day discussed the !
evidence they expect to come before the
board and their plans were given to i
their workers so that the asylum em
ployes could govern their testimony ac
cordingly, if called at the investiga
tion. Dr. Sponogle told th\ose present
that he had letters that Wjould clear
him of the charges and that, a number j
of witnesses from Sacramento had vol
unteered their services if needed to ex
onerate him. \
Dr. Sponogle also expressed a desire
for redress in court against rhose who,
he claims, have defamed him^
Trustee Gould, who is accompanied
by his little daughter, has (ensconced
himself in the finest suite of \ rooms of
the asylum, and there he will until !
the investigation closes. Pie is <a mighty j
monarch there and the employes pay j
him as much homage than qfver did !
subjects to a king. He and Tourtillott
have seen most of those who
to be 6alled at the investigation and
everything now ig In readiness'^ for the
coat of kalsomlne. i
CAVALRY FREE FROM (
THEJTELLOW F^VER
There Have Been No Fatalities; but
the Outlook for the Future ik
Not Encouraging.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, July 23 (Jvia
Kingston, Jamaica, July 24).â The repjort
published in the United States that tl/iere
are thirty cases of yellow fever in (the
cavalry division proves, on investigation,
to be unfounded. Captain House requests
that the report be definitely denied. \
There have beerf no fatalities from
fever thus far, but so long- as the ijnen
are exposed to the hot sun during ithe
day. the increasing rains and the hekvy
night dews, malaria will increase and
our men grow worse. A second attalck
Is much more difficult to eradicate, Â«s
pecially in the case of men exposed (to
the present conditions. i
The cavalry is anxious to proceed \to
Porto Rico, but will be obliged to remalin
here until the Spanish prisoners of wkir
have been transported to Spain, whicui,
it is believed, will have been acconn
plished before the next month is weill
advanced. The army is mentally de
pressed by inactivity and the uncertainty
as to its future movements, together witp
the increasing malarial fever.

NO MORE ASSISTANCE
FOR GENERAL GARCIA
American Supplies Denied Him as
Long as He Maintains His
Present Attitude.
NEW YORK, July 24.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Major Gen
eral Shafter is still leaving the adminis
tration in official ignorance of tue corre
spondence that has passed between him
and General Garcia. The informaiton at
hand seems to indicate, however, that the
American commander was not discourte
ous to the Cuban general, as has been al
leged. The only substantial ground that
Garcia had, as the matter is understood
here, was that General Shafter had failed
to invite him or any member of his staff
to witness the surrender of the Spanish
forces and the raising of the American
flag over the city of Santiago de Cuba.
General Shafter's course in refusing to
turn the city of Santiago over to the Cu
bans meets with entire approval here.
Had he placed the Cubans in control he
would have in effect recognized the Cuban
republic, a thing Congress expressly re
fused to do, and which the President does
not think should be done until it is seen
whether there is a stable government on
the island to recognize. There is to be
no change in the policy of the Govern
ment in sending supplies and arms to the
Cubans, except that those under Garcia
prohnbly will not receive more assistance
as long as their leader maintains his
present attitude.

SICK AND WOUNDED
UNDER INSPECTION
Precautions Taken In Removing Pa

to New York.
NEW YORK, July 24.â The hospital
ship Relief was inspected by Health
Officer Doty at 5 o'clock to-day aiid

at anchor in the bay until to-morrow,
pending orders from the surgeon general.
It is expected the hospital ship will pro
ceed to the city during the forenoon and
her sick and wounded will be removed
to the hospitals designated by the sur
geon general. All the patients had a
comfortable day and enjoyed a refresh
ing night's rest. After discharging her
patients the Relief will take on a supply
of coal and provisions and sail again for
Santiago.

PEACE SAID TO
HAVE IMPROVED
By Way of London Comes a Hint
of Direct Negotiations Between
Washington and Madrid.
LONDON, July 25..â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Times says: Peace
prospects have greatly Improve 1 during
the last forty-eight hours. The diplo
matic exploration of the Duke Almo
dovar de Rio. the Foreign Minister,
has been more practical than was sup
posed, and It is now tolerably certain
that the Government's efforts are en
tering a new phase which may gradu
ally lead to tangible results.
The precise nature of the change !s
a secret, but there Is little doubt that
It tends to direct negotiations between
Spain and the T'nited States, there be
ing no inclination to seek the mediation
of any neutral power. The moment has
arrived when America, having reached
the parting of the ways, must choose
between war with a specific object and
an indefinable war of conquest.
The present pause in hostilities is
held to prove that the United States is
reluctant to plunge into a wider sphere
of action, and it may be confidently
predicted that if direct negotiations are
opened without delay both countries
will find their views on the main point
âthat of the future of Cubaâ far from
lrrconcllable.
The growing dissensions between the
Cuban insurgents and the Americans
are noted here with great satisfaction,
and on all sides I hear said. "If we
must lose Cuba it is better that the
islands should be annexed by America,
because the traitors would be thereby
punished and the enormous Spanish in
terests in the island would be pro
tected."
The French embassy at "Washington
seems the most likely channel for open
ing negotiations, and the semi-official
statement that America Intends to re
tain Porto Rico is regarded here as a
hint to Spain to hurry up.
There is still much talk about Cariist
intrigues and preparations, but the
Government, though vigilant and ready
to net energetically if necessary, seems
to think that at present there is no
serious danger of untoward develop
ments. The danger of Republican
movements is still less. Senor Emillo
â¢;lar has Just rendered a service to
the cause of order by publishing a long
letter in which he impresses upon all
good Spaniards the necessity of sink
ing all party differences and remain
ing firmly united at the present critical
moment. "Patriotism, like the church."
says Sennr Castellar. "Imposes unity
on us and if unity does not exist let us
be silent upon the subject." The proj

MEAT TO THE MASSES.
leading Merchants of the City Co
operating With the Americans
in the Charitable
Work.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, July 23, by
the Cail -Herald disj>atch-boat Golden
Rod to Kingston, Jamaica, July 24. â
Although the city of Santiago has
been under the protection of the Unlt
eo States for a week the food problem
Btlll Is a pressing one. The adoption
of the old customs duties haa
driven away several cargoes of sup
plies sent here from Jamaica, and for
the time being the Red Cross Is the
only agency that stands between
Santiago and starvation.
Four houses for the relief of the
starving were opened on Thursday by
George Kennan, and Red Cross nurses j
were placed In charge. Bix thousand
persons were fed that day, and the '
number of applicants since that time
has more than doubled.
Leading merchants of Santiago are
co-operating with the Americans In
this charitable work and they are
doing what they can to relieve the
distress.
Soup was at first delivered three
times a day, but the demand was so
great that the soup kitchens are now
kept open continuously, always being
Furrounded by crowds of ravenous
men, women and children, chattering
in strange tongues, clamoring for food
and scrambling indiscriminately for it
when It Is forthcoming.
For the first time since the Riege was
raised fresh meat was cooked in San
tiago. The steamships Mississippi and
Panama, of the quartermaster's de
partment, arrived with cattle for the
troop*. The beeves were slaughtered
in a building set apart for the purpose.
General Khafter contributed part of
this meat to the food supply of the
city.
Fires were built In the market place,
and as fast as the meat could be
cooked it was given to those most in
need of it. In several instances the
troops were compelled to stand guard
over white women while they ate the
portion of meat given to them. The
troops themselves have been hard
pressed for food, and this consignment
of fresh meat was gratefully received.
The civil government of the city has
been restored almost to normal condi
tions. Many Spanish officials have re
fused to take the oath acknowledging
the supremacy of the United States and
have sent in their resignations. They
are being replaced by Cubans.

definitely postponed.
The Madrid correspondent of the
Daily News, telegraphing Sunday,
says: The efforts of the Government
toward peace are meeting with insup
erable difficulties. Ministerialists say
that the chief obstacle is President Me-
Kinley's "impressionable character,"
which is more influenced, they affect to
believe, by his personal friends and the
Jingoes In Congress than by diplomatic
counsels. The President some times ap
pears inclined, they say. to negotiate
for peace on reasonable terms, but at
others he seems determined upon a war
of conquest with a "view of convincing
Europe that the United States is a
grent military power which must be
reckoned with."
LOSS OF THE CUBAN
CABLE A DIFFICULTY
LONDON, July 25.â The Gibraltar
correspondent of the Daily News, tele
graphing Sunday, says: According to
Ministerial admissions peace is further
off than it was last week. The great
difficulty is the loss of the Cuban cable.
Senor Gamazo, the Minister of Public
Instruction, threatens to resign.
The administrative haste and bustle
in Spain about port defenses are pro
digious, but who can think that all
this means business after all that has
happened. The heavy French guns
supplied from the Saint diamond
works have been lying for the last six
weeks in the drill ground at Cara
banch. They are being tested and will
be sent to replace the brass and other
old-fashioned pieces at Cadiz, but the
means of loading them are defective,
and so, too, is the smokeless powder.
However, the military engineers ex
pect that all thse defects will be set
right.
Ordinary railway traffic is almost
suspended, as the trains are wanted to
take soldiers and marines, with muni
tions of war, hither and thither.
The field artillery, which was sup
plied by France before war was de
clared, was originally centralized at
Madrid, but it is now being shipped to
the northern Sierra, where Carllst up
risings appear. The fire brigades at
the various seaports are constantly
drilling to prepare themselves to deal
â¢with burning houses during the bom
bardments. The engineers have cre
ated what appear to be strong defenses
at Cadiz, but the strength must de
pend altogether upon the range of the
guns.

Lieutenant Mlley has returned from San

four days ago to receive the surrender
of the Spanish troops. The number sur

This afternoon Lieutenant Mlley of

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JULY 25, 1898.
WHAT DISPOSITION
SHALL BE MADE OF
THE PHILIPPINES?
Natives More Capable of Self-
Government Than Cubans,
Says Dewey.
NEW YORK, July 24.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald sends
the following: Rear Admiral Dewey
has officially expressed to the Navy De
partment his opinion that the insurg
ents of the Philippines are more ca-
pable of self-government than are the
Insurgents of Cuba. So far as I have
bfH>n able to learn he has not informed
the department of any change in the
attitude of General Auglnaldo toward
the American forces, although General
Anderson said in his dispatch to the
War Department that the insurgent
leader had declared himself dictator
and proclaimed martial law.
Rear Admiral Dewey's dispatches
concerning Auginaldo's behavior have
generally been of a complimentary
character and that the two are working
in harmony is best shown, the officials
contend, by obedience of the Insurgent
leader to Rear Admiral Dewey's re
quests to suspend operations against
Manila until the arrival of the Ameri
can troops.
What shall be the final disposition of
the Philipipnes is a question which has
not even been settled by the adminis
tration. From commercial bodies the
President hns learned their anxiety for
retention of the Philippines, but from
other sources objection is raised to
their acquisition. All the President and
a majority of his Cabinet would like to
hold would be a coaling station in the
Philippines and Guam Island in the
La drones.
With the natives quite as capable of
self-government as the Cubans, it may
CHEER THEIR
CAPTORS' FLAG
Unusual Demonstration
by Spaniards.
GRATEFUL FOR KINDNESSES
THEIB METHOD OF THANKING
UNCLE SAM.
Prisoners Captured on Prize Steam
ers Salute Old Glory as They
Are About to Start for
Spain.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July 24.â Prisoners of
war cheering the flag of their captors
was the unusual sight witnessed at the
Union dock in Brooklyn to-day. The
sight was all the more significant as
the cheers came from Spanish throats.
The 254 prisoners captured on the
four prize steamer 3 now In port were
about to sail for home under the Brit
ish flag. They were on board the Hes
perla, of the Anchor line, and Just as
she backed out of the dock one of the
patrol gunboats came by. With one
accord the prisoners raised three
mighty cheers which startled the peo
ple on the Brooklyn shore and could
be heard on Governor's Island. It was
the best they could do in thanking
Uncle Sam for the kindness lavished on
them while they were prisoners.
The Hesperia left at 3 p. m., bound
for Italian ports. She will put the
prisoners on shore at Gibraltar. The
prisoners were a happy lot and their
appearance showed that they had been
well treated while in enforced idleness.
Among the 254 prisoners were six of
ficers. They have saloon accommoda
tions, while the others are In the steer
age. One of the Spanish officers said:
"If our men in the field realized the
hopelessness of our cause, or the treat
ment they would get at the hands of
the Americans they would not fight
long. The quickest and easiest way to
reach home is to surrender. I believe
in fighting where there Is a chance, but
our soldiers don't know we have not a
chance. They can get home quicker by
surrendering, and in the meantime be
well fed and taken care of. But they
think the Americans will murder
them."
The Austrian Consul paid $T7 a head
for the passage of each of the pris
oners.
SHAFTER REPLIES TO
GARCIA'S COMPLAINT
Dissensions in the Red Cross Society
Leading to Dr. Guiteras'
assignation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTIAGO, Cuba, July 23 (by Call-
Herald dispatch boat Golden Rod to
Kingston. Jamaica, July 24).â General
Phiifter has told General Garcia that
the reason why the Cubans were not
invited to participate in the ceremonies
of surrender was that he thought it
would not be good policy. His action,
he stated, was not due to any lack of
regard of his Cuban allies.
The Cubans intend to attack Holgnln
and then Manzanillo.
Dissensions have arisen among the
representatives of the Red Cross So
ciety here. Dr. cuiteras, the yellow
fever expert, has resigned and re
turned to the United States because of
unfavorable comments on his work.
More humble members of the Red
Cross say that others who are more
prominent are using the society for
their own advancement.
It is denied that there are thirty cases
of yellow fever in the cavalry division.
Thehealth of the city is generally good,
although there are many cases of ma
laria and dysentery.
Dr. Calmanero inspected the trans
ports Leona, Concho and Orizaba and
found three cases of yellow fever on the
one last named.
General Toral had a conference to
day with General Shafter relative to
the transportation of Spanish prisoners
to Spain. It was arranged to send 8000
within a week. The Spanish Govern
ment proposed to send its men free on
ships of the Trans-Atlantic line which
be the administration will determine to
maintain a force in the Islands of the
far East until a stable government Is
In operation In the Philippines and then
withdraw â just as it is proposed to do
in Cuba.
This is on <f the many suggestions
which has been presented to the Presi
dent's consideration, but it is purely
mere speculation to say whether or
not he will adopt it: It is appreciated
by the authorities that the abandon
ment of the Philippines will mean the
seizure of different Islands by Euro
pean powers, and it is questionable
whether the authorities woui.l be will
ing to abandon them. When peace ne
gotiations are entered into, the author
ities say, that matter will then be
finally considered and disposed of, but
in view of the possibilities of the
future, which may cause a policy dif
ferent from that which might now be
formed, it Is the intention of the Presi
dent not to announce any definite plan
until the war is at an end.
I understand that the monitor Mont
erey has instructions to proceed to
Yap Island, near the Pelew group, and
there hoist the* American flag. The
authorities believe that within the
next week the monitor will touch at
the point named and then proceed to
Manila, where she will arrive about
August 5.
Yap Island, also called Oouap and
Gouap, is about nine miles long and
has about 2000 inhabitants. It is one
of the Caroline group and owned by
Spain. It is In latitude 9 degrees 25
minutes north and .ongitude 13S de
grees 1 minute west. It lies just north
of the Pelew I .ands.
are now shut up in Cuban ports. The !
United States officials refused the offer ''
because they considered it a ruse to get
the vessels away. The prisoners are
elated over the near prospect of return
ing to their homes.

OUR NEW COMMERCIAL FIELDS.
1" H E United States is flush with money. This is
plainly shown in Wall street, where there is a
ided pressure of new funds for investment,
and where there is already considerable talk of the
formation of syndicates for financial ventures in
Eastern Cuba. The shrewd American mind has al
perceived the richness of the new field
being opened by onr armies in the Antilles,
and if the present alacrity to take advantage
of it be any indication, there will be vast
rcial investments in Cuba and Porto Rico
near future, to say nothing of the Philippines
later on. The Yankee has grown immensely rich at
home; he now bids fair to become still richer

n wool markets are now said to be the lowest
in the world, and it is claimed that stocks there can
not be replaced at lower prices, either here or abroad.
Shipments of boots and shoes thus far this month are
i larger than ever before in July, except in
Atlantic coast large preparations are
for extensive shipments of merchandise to
n points expected as a result of the
in occupation oi Cuba. Commercial failures
continue small, those last week being 188, or 32 less
than in the same week in 1897, 92 lesi than in ISO 6
and 51 less than in 1895.
The breaking out of the war immediately diverted
the public attention from the Klondike, but the ar
mors with large amounts of treasure and
that the production of the district this year
will amount to $20,000,000 have again brought this
industry into prominence, and more animation in the
ide is looked for in consequence.
The wheat trade of the country has been rather dis
ting of late. Supplies of the old crop are rap
appearing, and though the new crop move
ment is in excess of last year it hardly comes up to ex
>ns. and the market has ruled weak, though a
certain sensitiveness to bullish conditions
implies that it would not take much to advance quo
tations, which are rather low.
The local situation shows no particular change from
last week. The grain markets, which had been stag
nant for some time, showed unsettled symptoms,
which may develop into an advance or possibly the
reverse, though the latter is hardly expected. Corn
has gone up sharply, owing to light stocks here and
nn advance in the Western markets, and as this grain
lias been ~rd as feed for several months, the
rise may lend to a sympathetic improvement in the
minor cerenK such as barley and oats. Farm products
continue firm as a rule. Hay keeps up to its profit
able level, in spite of heavier receipts, and specula
tion in beans, which has been stagnant of late, is re
viving. Fruit continues to bring prices little dreamed
of a year ago. and the fruit-growers are consequently
in clover. Provisions are dull, as usual at this season,
and pork has been steadily declining for a week. The
hide market is also weakening, but there is rather
more tone in wool, especially for the choice descrip
tions. Canned fruits are stiff, and the tendency of
the market is upward, as the English inquiry is
strong and the output this year will be much lighter
than usual. General merchandise is moving off well,
and the merchants are not complaining of business.
Money is in abundant supply at the usual rates of
interest.
Considering the remarks they would be apt to ex
change, perhaps it is as well that Shafter and Garcia
do not speak as they pasÂ« by.
Rebellion in Wu Chau Fu seems to progress with
all the spirit of a highbinder riot in our own China
town.
THE DUTY OF REPUBLICANS.
RESOLUTIONS adopted by the Republican
State Central Committee providing for the
election of delegates to the State convention
declare: "In counties having three or more Assem
bly Districts primary elections must be held, and
must be held by Assembly Districts. The County
Committee shali give at least ten days' notice of the
primary elections, or caucus, for the selection of dele
gates to said convention, and must provide for two
oting places, and as many more as may be necessary,
in each Assembly District where primaries are held,
and the polls at such primary elections must be kept
open at least twelve hours."
These resolutions are the formal manifestation and
proof that the Republican leaders are in hearty sym
pathy and accord with the sentiment expressed by
Chairman McLaughlin in his ringing declaration of
opposition to "boss rule, corruption in politics and
domination of corporations." Under these provisions
every loyal Republican is given an equal share in the
selection of the men who are to represent his county
in the convention. The rule of the bosses is over
thrown at the start, corruption is eliminated and
honest politics has the field.
This much having been done by the State Com
mittee, the outcome rests with the rank and file of
the party. Indifference to the rights thus secured, or
negligence to attend the primaries, if prevalent to
any considerable extent among the Republicans, will
offset all that has been accomplished. No system of
political procedure, however fairly devised and hon
estly enforced, can benefit those who are not willing
to perform the work necessary to reap the benefits.
The way has been provided for independent, fair
minded and patriotic Republicans to direct the affairs
of the party in this campaign from first to last, but
unless they are earnest and resolute In fulfilling their
duties the control will pass from them to the bosses
again, in spite of all the State Committee has done.
How far a feeling of indifference to politics exists
among the people this year it is impossible to say;
but the slow way in which registration is proceeding
in this county is an evidence that it is widespread.
That feeling within the ranks of the Republican party
at any rate must be overcome. Every earnest member
of the party should make himself an active canvasser
among his friends and see that all are registered, that
all are impressed with the importance of attending
the primaries when they are called.
The Republican State Committee has made an ap
peal direct to the people. It is desirable that the re
sponse should come from the people direct. The
State convention should represent genuine Repub
licanism. All of its delegates should come straight
from the great body of the party and speak the true
voice of the majority. It is now. therefore, the prime
duty of every Republican to register and to prepare
for attending the coming primaries, so that each and
j all may do their share in ridding the organization of
i boss rule, corruption in politics, and the domination
j of corporations, and making it in every way worthy
â  of the memories of Lincoln and of Grant, and equal
j to the task of upholding the stalwart Americanism of
the McKinley administration.
THE DUTY OF REGISTRATION.
REGISTRAR BIGGY reported last Thursday
that up to that time only about 14,000 out of a
possible 74.000 voters had registered, notwith
standing the fact that the office has been open ever
since June 1. At the main office registration will
close on August 8. There is, therefore, comparatively
little time for the 60,000 citizens who yet remain to
get their names on the rolls.
It is not easy to understand why any considerable
number of intelligent men should have so long neg
lected to attend to so important a political duty as
this. The pressure of business cannot have kept
everybody back, nor is it likely that so many per
sons believe their former registration will remain
good. It has been announced over and over
that with the formation of the new great register
the old one will be canceled, and no one will be al
lowed to vote whose name is not on the new one.
Registration at the main office can be accomplished
now, before the rush begins, in about five minutes.
So small is the number of persons who are now regis
tering daily that there is almost no waiting necessary
on the part of any. The office, moreover, is open
until 9 p. m. to accommodate those wno cannot at
tend to the duty in the daytime, so that there is ample
opportunity for all to register at their convenience
without crowding and without delay.
It is hardly necessary to say that this condition of
affairs will not last much longer. The time for clos
ing registration at the main office Is drawing near.
The rush will soon begin. Those who wait will be
put to man}- inconveniences that they could now
avoid. Every argu :,ent, therefore, is on the side of
a prompt attention to the duty.
There is reason to fear that a spirit of indifference
has developed in the city in regard to the approach
ing election, and that the people are not aware of the
importance of the issues before them. It is certain
that all of the so-called "push" and "pull" element
will register and vote. If the business men of the
city neglect to be equally attentive to their political
duties they will merit the fate that will befall them
on election day.
A free government is dependent for good adminis
tration upon the free actions of its best citizens. If
they neglect their political duties because of business
or indifference, then the administration of city or
State and representation at Washington will be just
what the bosses choose to make.
HURT'S MILITARY SPIRIT.
WH. H. HART is in the throes of ambition.
He wants to take his alphabetical impressive
â¢ ness to the Philippines or somewhere and
devastate the enemy with it. The throes would not
have attracted attention had Hart kept them at
home, but he has toted them off to Washington,
where there is a possibility that they may be taken for
something important. He is a man of airy, fairy
fancy, not seriously considered here, and yet he
might spring the drummer-boy story on the Presi
dent and get a commission of some sort, a circum
stance which would tend to make the State ridiculous,
and would make Hart ridiculous also, save that there
is no way of painting the lily.
Of the drummer-boy story Hart was the hero. It
credited him with having led an army on to victory
by the martial beat of the sheepskin and the fire flash
ing from his youthful eye. It set forth that having
beheld him. the foe fled in terror. It was a beautiful
tale, and Hart had promised to pay a certain sum
for having it written, the purpose being to create a
wave of enthusiasm upon the crest of which he could
ride into office. It created the wave, and Hart rode
the crest in fine style. There was little savor of truth
in the story. In fact, it is said. Hart had not been in
the action where he was supposed to have rallied the
troops and saved the day. Moreover, the story has
not yet been paid for, although this is of course a
side issue, mention of which may be indelicate.
California's objection to the plan of the gentleman
of Vftrrs is that the State is ready to furnish in a
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JULY 25, 1898.
regular way all the troops which may be called for
by the Government. There has been a willingness
amounting to enthusiasm in this respect, and the
commonwealth has acquitted itself with honor. Now,
Hart, as an individual, could not raise a brigade, a
regiment, a company, a corporal's guard, or anything
else but a smile. His failure would be absolute, a
serio-comic feature not required by war, and yet if
lie were equipped with a commission the fiasco would
in a measure reflect upon the State. Therefore the
President is solicited by every citizen of California
save Hart himself not to be deluded into giving the
.desired commission. If the gentleman with an al
phabet for a title and an impregnable nerve as his
working capital is determined to kill Spaniards let
him hunt up his old drum and, going against the
enemy single-handed, beat them into the sea. If it's
glory he's after this feat would bring him plenty.
California appreciates Hart as a joke, but he can't
play himself on us too often.
STATE PRIDE AND THE WAR.
/-CONSIDERABLE discussion, lively at all
I times and sometimes redhot, has been occa
sioned in the East by certain claims put for
ward by New York and Massachusetts asserting a
superiority over their sister States in furnishing
troops for the war. As the controversy is waged
over the records of the expedition to the West Indies
it is hardly our fight. It happens, however, that in
carrying on their disputation both sides have made
assertions sufficiently sweeping to include the whole
war, and not the Atlantic side of it only, and as some
of these sweeping claims are unjust to California, we
are compelled to take notice of them.
The New York Times, for example, in discussing
why troops were not more rapidly sent to the front,
says: "Without question all the troops that were con
sidered available were sent. They were all regular
troops with the exception of the Rough Riders, of one
regiment from New York and of one regiment from
Massachusetts. That is to say, when the test of a well
regulated militia came, Massachusetts and New York
were the only States that were found to possess such
a militia,"
If that had specifically referred to the West In
dian expedition only we would have had no cause to
interfere, but the broad statement that when the test
came it was found that only New York and Massa
chusetts had a well regulated militia is false. Cali
fornia was the first State in the Union to furnish the
quota called for by the President, and she was able to
be the first simply because she had a militia suffi
ciently "well regulated" to respond without a mo
ment's delay. While New York and Massachusetts
were wrangling over the legal questions involved in
transferring regiments of the National Guard to the
Volunteer Army, California acted promptly and got
there first.
The Philadelphia Enquirer in disputing the claims
of the Times claims for Pennsylvania the honor of
being the first State to respond to the call for men,
and in explaining why the troops of that State have
not been more numerous* or more conspicuous at the
front says:
"The reason that New York and Massachusetts
â and, hy the way. we must not forget Michigan's
two regiments under Duffield â have been well repre
sented at the front is because those States are well
represented in the family counsel of the President
Their Cabinet officers have spared no pains to bring
to the attention of the authorities the condition of the
troops of their States, which we do not doubt in the
main was fairly good. But the guard of Pennsylvania,
which has been the pride of the commonwealth, has
been neglected and passed over until now that once
splendidly organized body of men has been scattered
and disrupted."
The plea is ingenious, but it is not exactly effec
, tive. California has no representation in the Cabinet,
! nor as strong a Congressional delegation as Penn
sylvania, yet our boys have found their way to the
front and will no doubt distinguish themselves there.
In fact, when it comes to comparing State records in
this war California will not have to advance excuses
of any kind. She has not only furnished promptly all
that the nation called upon her for, but a considerable
number of men for the regular army and other or
ganizations. Therefore when Eastern States wish to
dispute with one another over their rival pretensions
j they should confine their claims of superiority to
their side the Mississippi and not make sweeping as
j sertions that include the Union.
THE SUPERVISION OF FORESTS
A RECENTLY issued report of the Chief Fire
Warden of Minnesota, covering the year 1897,
has attracted much attention in the East by
reason of the evidence it affords of the advantages
accruing to a commonwealth from a judicious care
and guardianship of its forests. In Minnesota hardly
anything has been done in that way by the State ex
cept to guard against fires, and yet even that much
has resulted in a saving so vast that the cost of the
supervision amounts to but a trifle in comparison
with it.
According to reviews of the report given in our
exchanges, the standing timber in Minnesota is esti
mated by the Fire Warden to be worth, at the lowest
calculation, upward of $100,000,000. Minnesota is one
of the large States of the Union, and its forest area
extends over many miles. The annual destruction
of trees by fires was at one time so great that the
loss was almost incalculable. With the supervision
now established these losses, while not completely
guarded against, have been so much reduced that
according to the report under consideration the total
loss by fires in the forest for the year was but $22,455,
and on the prairies $14,554.
It would be gratifying if we could have a report
from a Cakiornian official showing as low a loss by
forest fire* as that of the Fire Warden of Minnesota.
A single one of our large fires will probably sweep
away five times the value of all the trees destroyed by
fires in Minnesota in a whole year. It is indeed high
time for us to be giving serinus consideration to this
problem. We can find in Europe and in the older
States of the East ample precedents both to warn us
and to guide us.
Germany has acrualry mn.de her forestry system pay
a revenue to the State, while at the same time the
forests themselves increase in value. Spain has lone
since destroyed her forests, and her people are suf
fering the consequences in the form of a thousand
evils. At present California is following the course
of Spain, while Minnesota has turned her steps
toward wiser courses. Our forests to-day are worth
much more than those of our sister State, but if each
persists in the course it is now pursuing it will
not be very long before the superiority will be on the
other side.
If Blanco persists in his determination to destroy
the American navy it is hoped he can be per
suaded to permit Uncle Sam to keep a few rejuven
ated ships for which Spain does not seem to have any
use.
Augusti and Blanco seem to have been designed for
thÂ» violent ward of a lunatic asylum.
NEWS OF THE MINES.
The International Exposition at Toron
to, Canada, which will open the last of
August, will, it Is gratifying to know,
display a mineral exhibit from the Rands*
burg district, if from no other part of the
State. The exhibit will be a small one.
and will be due to private enterprise, but
it points to the advertising moral con
stantly needed to be kept in mind by
every mining region of the State. It is
a pity that a splendid exhibit representing
the whole State could not have been sent
to Omaha, but that possibility is gone,
and the next great opportunity will be the
Paris Exposition. Our mineral represen
tation there depends on the next Legisla
ture.
The Randsburgr district has fortunately
got rid of its early boom and its fictitious
operations, and has developed into a pros
perous, steadily producing camp, with a
promising and lasting future before it.
The current mining news from Randsburg
and vicinity is now made up of reports of
genuine progress, important finds and
legitimate developments. The perma
nence with depth of the ora values has
been demonstrated.
According to the Los Angeles Review
the gold output of the Rand district the
current year has been about $400,000. The
output for the month of July will prob
ably be increased over that of the past
three months, as the Yellow Aster Com
pany will have their usual amount of ore
milled this month. During June the Eu
reka mill ran twenty tons of ore for the
Jltned mine, going $70 per ton; twenty
tons for the Napoleon, running 5100;
tweitty-flvf] tons of Wedge ore at $U-0,
thirteen tons of Kinyon at $150. forty tons
for the Butte, running $60 per ton.
The new two-stamp mill at the Little
Butte mine Is running day and night on
Little Butte ore. In this mine a seam
was followed down 280 feet before gold
was encountered; then a good ledge three
feet wide was found.
During June the Johannesburg Reduc
tion Works made a mill run for the Yel
low Aster Company amounting to $20,000,
and the Butte a $7000 run.
Another rich strike has been made in
Trilby No. 2, and over $3000 was taken out
In one day.
A cyanide plant is in course of construc
tion at Oarlock to work the tailings of
that camp. It is expected to handle sixty
tons per day.
In spite of the unprecedented lack of
water, involving the temporary curtail
ment or suspension of operation at "go
ing" mines, on the mother lode mining
activity in the line of development, pros
pecting, buying and bonding is as lively
as ever.
According to a Stockton dispatch one or
the richest strikes on the mother lode for
some time has been made at the Ma
zeppa mine, near Stent, in Tuolumne
County. The mine Joins thÂ« famous
Jumper claim, and only development
work has been done. At a depth of fif t> -
five feet a vein was uncovered in which
free gold in large quantities is shown. A
lump the size of an egg contained be
tween |45 and $50 of almost pure gold It
is impossible to tell the extent of the_
lead or estimate the amount of ore.
According to the Mountain Echo of
Angels Camp. Calaveras County, work
on the famous old Cherokee mine near
Altaville, is progressing rapid under its
new management. A tine hoist has just
been completed and a general improve
ment is noticeable in and around the mill
and hoisting works. Everything is now
in readiness for work under ground in the
main shaft.-. The old timers of Altaville
predict a great future for the mine under
intelligent management, and it is not at
all to be wondered at considering the fact
that all old residents of Altaville know
that the Cherokee has produced more
said in proportion to the amount of work
Performed than any other quartz mine
ever discovered in this mining section.
Preparations are making to work the
Harris mine on a larger scale. This mine
is probably one of the richest mines ever
discovered in Calaveras County.âMoun
tain Echo. , _ ,
Of the general situation in Tuolumne
County the Sonora Union-Democrat says:
"The steady growth of the mining indus
try goes on as merrily as ever, and all
indications point out that ere the close
of the year fifty modemly equipped mines
that were unknown quantities in 1597 will
be hammering away in the gold-produc
ing contest."
The American Gravel Mining Company
whose property is located near Fo^t Jim,

Coronado, Coronado, CatCAMP MERRITT WILL BE
ABANDONED THIS WEEK
THE sanltar situation at Camp
Merritt with each passing day
Is becoming more alarming.
Yesterday five soldiers who had
fallen victims to this disease
breeding camp were consigned to
the gTa The rec rd of deaths and
sickness is startling, and promises to
proportionately equal the fatalities of
the Cuban battlefields. In addition to
the illness caused by the unhealthy
condition of the camp, it is claimed
that a great deal of the sickness has
been the result of inexperience on the
part of the volunteer surgeons and reg
imental commanders in looking after
their men, and furthermore many of
the soldiers are at fault for the little
care that they take of themselves.
It is a noticeable fact that the per
centage of sickness among the regu
lars has been very much less than
among the volunteers. The latter care
lessly expose themselves to the winds
and fogs, and in some instances keep
late hours and dissipate to excess. An
order was recently issued In regard to
the time that the men are to be in
camp, but it is claimed that the regi
mental commanders have not strictly
enforced it. Another cause of sickness
is the filth of the camp, and a lack of
bathing facilities.
The authorities having the power to
move the troops to the Presidio are be
ing severely criticized for the delay In
this important matter, and nearly ev
erybody at Camp Merritt is asking
when the move is to be made.
Captain Thompson, the post quarter
master, yesterday said that he thought
the troops might be moved this week,
provided he can get the water pipes
. laid and the sinks dug at the Presidio.
This work must be done before the
troops can change their camp to the
Presidio grounds. To-day all the water
pipes that can be spared from Camp
rrltt will be taken up and hauled to
the Presidio.
General Miller stated yesterday that
the moviner of the troops-is about to be
gin, and that before the end of next
week Camp Merritt would be a thing
of the past.
The lines between the First and Sec
ond Brigades will be more distinctly
in evidence when the new camp is an
accomplished fact, as it Is planned to
locate them in different parts of the
Presidio reservation. The sites have al
ready been chosen.
It is given out that the troops to go
on the next transportsâ the St. Paul.
Pcanaia and Arizonaâ will not be
moved to the Presidio. Those to go on
the St. Paul will sail this week.
The division and post hospitals were
filled to their capacity yesterday, while
many of the Rick soldiers are in the
French and Marine hospitals. Pneumo- '
nia, typhoid fever, spinal meningitis,
dysentery and measles are the most
prevalent diseases.
Two cases of varloloid were discov
ered yesterday in the Seventh Califor
nia. These men will be completely Iso
lated.

BEST STEEL TOWBOAT ON THE WATER.
UNION IRON WORKS Ordered to Build a Sister to the Active, Which Was Sold to
the Government to Be Used as a Gunboat lor the Protection ol San
Francisco Harbor.
THE J. D. Spreckels & Brothers Company have placed an order with the Union Iron Works for the
building of a steel towboat, a sister to the Active, which the firm recently sold to the Government for
conversion into a gunboat.
As the Active was a representative of the strongest, speediest and most easily managed for her size of
any of the products of the boat-builder's art, the new towboat will be her counterpart, and will be christened
the Fearless, for she will fear nothing in the tug line that rides the waters.
The Fearless will be the exact counterpart of the Active, and will be employed in the towboat service
of the J. D. Spreckels & Brothers Company to take the place of the Active. No better model can be found
for the purpose than that of which the Active Is a representative, hence the new boat will be built on the
same lines.
The length of the Fearless will be 100 feet; breadth, 22.5 feet; Indicated horsepower, 600.
was moved to the lot It now occupies.
Lieutenant Scott Twentieth Kansas,
who was placed under arrest on Saturday
on a charge of insubordination, was re

Sergeant Rollins of the Seventh Cali
fornia, whose sad death was announced
in yesterday's Call, was uuried yester
day in the "Presidio plot. The regiment
attended the funeral in a body. The
floral pieces with which they decorated
his grave were many and beautiful. Rol
lins' father, who arrived at camp soon
after hl3 son's death, was unable to re
main for the funeral, as he was called
back to San Bernardino by the sudden
and serious illness of his wife.
The boys of the Tennessee regiment are
sincerely grateful for the good, consist
ent Christian work that has b<*r:i done
among them by Mrs. A. S. Townsend
during the past week. Mrs. Townsend
placed $IDO worth of tickets to the Sutro
baths at the disposal of the regiment,
and besides has seen to it that every
company, on one day or another, has
been provided with a substantial lunch
of things that only a bacon-fed soldier
knows how to properly appreciate. The
Red Cross Society also is coming in for
its share of praise from the appreciative
Southerners.
It has been discovered that the St. Paul
will carry but 814 men, and it has been
decided by the authorities to leave some
of the Minnesota recruits to follow on
either the Scandia or the Arizona, to sail
one week later.
Lieutenant McÃrown of the Eighteenth
named. South Ends took the outside Sta
tion, Pioneers the center and AJamedas
the inside. The start was made at 1:30 p.
m. Alameda got the best of it, and, row- j
Ing a stroke of about 37, took the lead,
followed by the Pioneers and South i
At the turn the Alameda lead had been j
cut down until there was little to choose ;
between them and the Pioneers, but un- ;
fortunately the South End cockswain
steered his boat for the Pioneer stake,
thus preventing the Koneers from round
ing; a foul ensued, and, after the Pion- j
eers and South Ends had got clear of each ;
other, the Alam>d;is bad obtained a de
cided l^ad. The Alnmed^f were :.
!;â¢ aded, and crossed the finishing-line easy j
winners. South Ends being second and
Pioneers third. Time, 11:2 4-5. The Ala-!
Mr-da stroke rowed strongly throughout
1 the race, and, though the crew Is not a '
pretty one and the men have a bad habit
of looking out of the boat, they are well
together and keep good time. The crews
were as follows:
AlamMa Boat Clubâ E. B. Hadcock, bow; W.
G. Hansen. No. 2; AtwHl Webb, No, 3; F. ;

R. J. Espy Jr., cockswain.
The South Ends having interfered with
the Pioneers and Bpoiled the latter's
chance of winning, there was some talk
of rowing the race again, but this was
not done, the Pioneers not lodging any '
protest. The South Buds were therefore
disqualified for not rounding their own
stake, and Interfering with the Pioneers, j
and second place wenl to the Pioneers.
For the Junior barge race there were
two entries, the Dolphins and Artels. The !
latter had choice of station, and took the
Inside. The Dolphins jumped away wiih
the lead, und twenty lengths frÂ«Â»'m the I
start were clear of the Ariel boat, but the i
pact- was too great to last, and they grad
ually came back until at tlv turn they
were level with the Ariels. After the turn '
the Ariris, who plugged away in a deter
mined manner, obtained a good load, took
the Dolphins' water and came in
winners by right or ten lengths. Time !
12:15 2-5. The crews were as follows;
Ariel Rowing Club Junior bargÂ» crewâ H Wll- â

Commence This
Week.
CAMP BARRETT, Sather Station, July
24.â The rumor that the Eighth Regiment
was to march around the bay to San
Francisco via San Jose Is denied by the
officials to-night. The only way to ac
count for any such absurd statement is
the fact that Colonel Henshaw and Lieu
tenant Colonel Carrlngton have been
looking about for a suitable tract of land
where the regiment may be taken out for
a drill in one body.
The concert this afternoon by the Regi
mental band was enjoyed by several

strange if any one was not patis

those holding winning tickets, and these
Kilts consisted uf all sorts of things from
a J2O gold piece to a ham.
A large number of prizes were given to
those who by feats of strength and speed
outstripped their competitors, as well as
for grace, for there was jig and reel
dancing. Some of the winners were the

Patriotic Remarks on That Subject
by Rev. Chapman of Oakland.

delivered a patriotic address at the Y. M.
Auditorium yesterday afternoon, In
which he paid a glowing tribute to
American manhood and the policy pur
by this Government in waging war
! not for conquest but for the uplifting of
humanity.
In the course of his remarks he said:
i "God has somehow put into the American
1 people the choicest blood of the nationsâ
the thin -blood, the thick blood, the red !
bloo<lâ and it has given us a nation of the
! mightiest men that ever lived. We are a
i nation of mighty men; men not only from :
j hiFt.irion! families but horn In poverty as
! well. Every American boy can say as he !
looks up to the Presidential chair 'that's
I mine, if I can earn it.'

TROOPS AT THE PRESIDIO.
Another Death in the Division
Hospital â Engineer Corps
Wants to Go to Hawaii.
Private Joseph Baker, Company B, â 
First Tennessee Regiment, who was
brought to the division hospital on Satur
day afternoon suffering with acute
dysentery, died there the same night.
The remains of Private Lewis, Com
pany H, Sixth California Regiment, who
died at the post hospital on Saturday of
pneumonia, were removed yesterday to |
Merced by his parents.
Major Owen said yesterday that the
division hospital was full, but that to-day
he would discharge a number of men as
cured, and that he would secure a num- i
ber of cots to-day so that ha would have
plenty of room.
The Third Battalion of the First Regi
ment of Washington Volunteers is ex
pected here this week. With its arrival
the regiment will be nearly together, as
the Second Battalion is doing duty in the
State.
The Utah troop of cavalry will leave
the Presidio on the sth of August. Cap
tain Came will be in command of that
portion that goes to the Yosemite Valley,
and the first lieutenant will command the
detail for Sequoia Park.
The Corps of Engineers under Major
Langfitt are ready and anxious to go to
Honolulu, and It is very probable that
the command will be sent there. The
men need a few more shoes and pants j
and a few tools, and they will be in shape |
for any kind of duty. Their services will |
certainly be required at Honolulu if the
Government Intends to build any bar
racks there.
Captain and Assistant Surgeon Edie,
Fourteenth United States Infantry, who
has just returned from Alaska, is upon
waiting- orders. If he is not sent to Porto
Rico he will probably be placed in com
mand of the expeditionary hospital forces
now here.
Yesterday was an exceedingly quiet day
in the camp of the First New York. All
drills were suspended and the men were
flven their liberty. Lieutenant Colonel
tacpole was absent and Major Chase
was in command. There was the usually
large crowd of visitors who wandered
around the camp. The Army and Navy
Christian Commission has erected a very
large tent just outside of the camp for
the convenience of the men, so that they
can have a place to read and write.
GUESTS OF THE RED CROSS
There Is no day of rest for the ladies
of the Red Cross. Visiting hospitals,
comforting the sick and supplying the
many wants of the boys in blue in these
busy war times gives them very little
time for recreation. Yesterday 1500 sol
diers, representing Camp Merritt and
Presidio, visited the ferry hospitality
rooms of the society and were refreshed
with delicious coffee, sandwiches and
fruit. Many occupied the long 1 tables
penning letters to loved ones at home,
and many read of their comrades already
in the field. Letters left with the ladies
were properly stamped and sent on to
their destination.
The committee has prepared cheer for
the 450 Washington volunteers who are
expected in to-day. Mrs. I. Lowenberg,
chairman of the hospitality committee,
asks that generous hearted people send
broad, butter, coffee and sugar to the
ferry, as many hundred soldiers visit the
rooms daily and are the guests of the
society.
Christian Commission Work.
The Christian Commission tent in the
First New York Regiment camp at the
Presidio was crowded yesterday, the first
service being held at 11 o'clock by the
chaplain. Every facility for letter-writ
ing and other conveniences as a head
quarters for men have been provided.
The two batteries at Fort Point have
also been provided with a tent, which is
highly appreciated by the men. Services
will be held there at least three evenings
a week, and the Mothers' Sewing Club
will endeavor to reach the tent once or
twice a week to sew for the boys.
The Crlttenton meetings to open at
Camp Merritt this evening promise to
be largely attended, as Mr. Crlttenton
Is a very popular speaker and the boys
have been expecting his coming.
The executive committee of the com
mission will meet this afternoon at 2:30
o'clock at the Occidental Hotel, when
steps will be taken looking toward the
organization of the commission In the
various cities of the State,
be framed and forwarded to the Super

MR. DOCKERY'S MOVING HEART
He Thouoht It Had Jumped Over to the Right Side,
hut Four Doctors Sau It Has Always
Been There.
Fan Francisco Is the home of a young man whoso henrt la on the right
side. His name is William Dockery. aged 24 years. living at 2 Rose ave
nue. Just how his heart switched from left to right is a mystery to Mr.
Dockery, who knows that the right place for the heart Is on the left side,
and that if it Is on the right side It is In the wrong place.
He is under the impression that the transfer occurred about two weeks
ago while he was at work In the Market-street power house. He Is a
plumber and was engaged in cutting a four-inch pipe when suddenly he
felt a twitching pain In his chest and experienced a. sensation as if his
heart had moved to the right side. So Impressed was he that this strange
movement had actually happened that he paid a visit to three physicians
employed by the Market Street Railway Company to be examined, and
sure enough these medical men found Dockery's heart on the right side.
The doctors agreed that it had always been there, that it was in normal
condition and that he was In good health. To further satisfy himself
Dockery called In his family physician. Dr. Jerome A. Anderson, who cor
roborated the diagnosis given by the street railway medical corps.
"Dockery's heart, although on the right side, has the right position,
but reversed." said Dr. Anderson, "and I should not be surprised if his liver
was on the left Fide and his spleen on the rightâ the reverse of the usual
order. There la really nothing startling about a heart on the right side,
although such cases are rare. In my twenty-five years' practice this is
the first case that has come under my observation. It is simply a freak of
nature."
Mr. Dockery. having been assured by Dr. Anderson that his heart Is
all right, continues at his work, not caring whether that mobile organ re
mains on the right or switches back to the left, so long as It performs its
functions.
POLICE DEPEND
ON THEORIES
Moth ing Is Accomplished

KRONER'S INQUEST TODAY
S"OT A JJIT OF TANGIBLE EVI
DENCE AGAINST LOCHNEB.
Che Suspect Will Take the Witness
Stand in His Own Behalf
and Defy the Detec
" , tives.
For eight flays tho Pollro TVpnrtmpnt
if this city lias boon making apparently
neffectlve efforts to pet a tangible clew
o the murderer of Sadie Carpenter, the
'k'tim of the Hubbard House mystery,
fa-day the result "f their work will be
irepcnted at the Coroner's inquest, and
inless they have evidence which is held
Â»ack no one can be accused of the mur
ler. The sleuths, including Chief Lees,
i-ho have charge of the case, hope that
he Coroner will be able to ascertain
.omethlng by rigid cross-examination of
he witnesses which -will bolster their
york and Justify them in charging
'oseph I-ochner with the crime.
While the Impression that I^ochner is
ruilty may be quite prencral, the police
lave not shown any material evidence to
â¢rove his guilt. Nothing has been given
tut by the department which will war
â ant the Coroner's jury In bringing in
mything more than the stereotyped ver
llct. "That the deceased came to her
lenth at the hands of a party or parties
inknown."
When Lochner was first arrested the.
jollre emphatically declared that he
:onld not possibly have had any hand in
he murder. Since the middle of the week
10 effort to find evidence against any
>ne but the man in the tanks has been
nadc. It is now Lochner or nobody.
Carpenter, the husband, has been entirely
Iropped.
Theoretically the police have a good
â¢ase against the suspect, but farts and
lot theories are necessary to convict a
nan of murder, and tho police are usually
;hort on facts, unless some outside sup
>ly Is furnished Rratuitously. In the
Carpenter caso the hoped for evidence
ras nut furnished by the newspapers, and
he police are consequently (\u\\f at sea.
Captain Seymour has secured a dozen
>r more statement* us to Lochner*a de
Â»raved character, but nothing therein
:onne<-ts him with the murder of Sadie
Carpenter. Lochner has also been re
>eate<lly '"sweated" and trapped into
â¢ viral contradictions which may or may
lot have any bearing upon hi* ruse. It
p more than reasonable to suppose he is
ruilty, but Die burden of the proof is on
he prosecution.
The chief dependence? of the police is
houerht to be that Lochner, after all the
'illainous statements about him have
ieen read before the coroner's jury, will
nake such an unfavorable impression that
l moral certainty of his kuIH will exist
n the minds of the Jurors and he will be
iccnsed of the crime. The testimony of
,Izz!e Rlley and Night Clerk I'rleur Is
ilso expected to count apuinst the sus
>ect. These witnesses contradict him in
egard to the use of the word "choking"
i-hen all three were in the hallway wali
ng for tho clerk to open the door to the
oom where the woman was found. The
tolice assert that the di.-appenranco. of
he watch and money beionplnp to the de
eased outs no figure in the case. They
rpue thnt I-Kichner had ample time anil
â¢pportunity to dispose of these things
men the night clerk left him In the room
to go for an officer and â when he subse
quently went to the Bellevue saJoon.
Lochner's conflicting statements about
llnding and untying the rag which was
around the woman's neck are expected to
bear heavily against him at the inquest.
In all her statements Lizzie Riley has
tohi of hearing a man with squeaky
shoes go along the hall and down the
street stairs soon after she was awakened
by the noise In room 10. At 1:20, about
the time of the murder, Dennis Llnihan,
who rooms on the third floor of the Hub
bard ] louse, ran hurriedly down the two
flights of stairs to the street. He had on
a pair of nev.- shoes and It is believed Liz
zie heard his footsteps and not those of
the murderer.
Lochner says he will take the witness
stand to-day and that he has no iear of
th.' letter received from Sergeant Gilllgan.
Sadie's soldier lover, who is at Chlcku
mauga. The communication contained no
information which has any bearing on
the case.
Mrs. Anderson, mother of the deceased,
came up from Monterey last evening to
attend the Inquest.

THOUGHT CREAMERWASBLIND
SAN JOSE DEFEATED BY OAK
LAND.
Eleven Innings "Were Gamely Fought
and After an Exciting Con
test the Score Stood Two
to One.
BY JOE CORBETT.
The wildest, most unjust and most en
thusiastic audience that ever graced Reo
reation Park with Its presence turned otit
yesterday afternoon and saw the Oak
lands defeat the San Jo^es in an eleven
inning contest by the close score of i
to 1.
The frame, as one will readily see by
scrutinizing: the score, was reason enough
'â¢> cause pandemonium, but the ucore
does not give a correct version of every
thing that occurred incidental to the
game.
It was the most exciting affair that I
ever hud the good fortune of witnessing,
yet with all that the unjust biasing and
hooting of an umpire doing his best .to
give satisfaction and accomplishing that
difficult feat under tho most trying of cir
cumstances hud a most dismal effect.
In justice to Mr. ("reamer, I must say
that be umpired, considering the condi
tions under which he labored, an ex
cellent game. Nearly every one of his
decisions was provokingly close, but in
them all lie exhibited the utmost pre
cision and judgment, giving perfect de
cisions on plays thut 1 have very often
seen National League umpires mistake
in.
Hanlon, when he slid to third, was out
beyond a doubt. The play was certainly
close, but that fact makes no difference.
Hanlon was out, and it was very unjust
of the crowd to ridicule Mr. Creamer
after he had made such an excellent de
cision.
Lfrockhoff was also out at the same
base, and the crowd was at. tin up
roarious. â 
A baseman has a perfect right to block
a runner in the manner Lang did Hruck
hofl. The only bad feature about that
play was the manner Lang bandied
Brockhoff after he touched him. He had
no right to shove him over, but that In
cident occurred after he had put his man
out, and therefore had nothing to do with
the decision.
Mr. Creamer's decisions at first base
were also correct, but where he did err
was In calling Sullivan back to the plate
after he had ben hit with the bull. Mr.
Ewlng protested the game on that point,
but as his team finally won out the pro
test goes for naught.
A liatsmun Is not compelled to evada a
pitched ball. If he remain* stationary
and the ball hits him he is entitled to first
Sullivan did not move one way ur
the other when hit with that ball, "and
Creamer had no right to call him back.
If he had changed his position so as to
get hit the decision would then have been
Correct.
In case of McOucken's prolonged argu
ment Creamer did not see the play, and
could therefore give no decision. My
tlueken on learning this should have re
tired.
The game was a pitchers' battle from
i start to finish, In which Russell out
1 pitched the Kr>-;it Iberg and then com
pleted hi* great day's work by scoring
the run which won the game. This hap
pened in the eleventh Inning. With two
men cut Russell hit for two bases and
Immediately scored on Donovan's single.
The game was beautifully played on
both sides, was interesting throughout,
; contained any number of exciting: situa
tions and was won by the Oaklands, as
mentioned above, through opportune hit
ting in the last of the eleventh inning. It
was anybody's <-ame, however, up to this
last rally, and were it not for the fact
that I am limited in space in Monday's
edition, I would with alacrity go into de
tails. Both teams permitted golden op
portunities to slip by when with a littles
sacrifice runs could have easily been
scored. I will take up these points on
Thursday. The score is as follows:

"DEAD CAT" IS THE LATEST
FALSEHOOD THE WEAPON OF
THE PARDEE CAMP.
A Northern State Committeeman
Compares the Quarrel to a
Punch and Jud7
Show.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, |
(roadway, July 24.
"Tin you refer to that Punch and Judy !
eh<->w playing a never ending engagement
unty?"
k.r was a member of the State
â¢nmittee from a northern coun
[e was crossing to Oakland last Sat- â 
â¢ â i;ng and was asked
thought of Alameda's
ral campaign. His answer was
; nd when requested to explain
it he took two copies of Pardee's organ
from his pocket. Kicked at them with a
way f.^cus to'his eyes and pmiled.
There was good ground for his sarcasm.
Unfortunately, Alameda's campaign for.
â  nor has degenerated into ;i stupid
and offensive personal contest. Vitupera
itlon. innuendo
il the methods known as "dirty poli-
Introduced and each side
ther for the reprehensible ;
y.
a sample paragraph from Dr.
-c.ir. of last Saturday:
Mr. Davis and Mr. Chapman have said that
they have no use for any man or set of men
â whi> have ever refused to vote for the Repub
lican nominees In municipal affairs. An,! Mr.
Chapman! has said, from the same platform
â with Mr. Pa vis, that he regarded Dr. Pardee
ns a "â dead cat"; and Mr. Davis, by his
nilence, has Indorsed what his friend, Mr.
Chapman, ?a5-1 about Dr. Pardee. When Mr.
Chapman abused Dr. Pardee, as only Mr. Chap
mnn can. Mr. Davis sat quietly by and smil
ingly assented to all that his political friend
paid. And when Mr. Chapman took occasion
to strike at all who ever voted anything: but
the straight Uppublican ticket in municipal
affairs, his friend, Mr. Davis, by his silence, if
In no other way, assented to all of Mr. Chap
man's abuse.
When political arguments get down to
""â¢.he "dead cat" basis and to falsehood
they are certainly of the Punch and Judy
show order, and that the State thus
views the Pardee-Davis wrestling match
is the i fault of the principals. In an
other copy of Dr. Pardee's organ is this
direct falsehood, known to Dr. Pardee to
be such: .
The true Jnwardness of The Call's opposi
tion to George C. Pardee In this county Is said
to be that the line of political argument and
the trend of thought adopted as gospel by the
Alameda County correspondent of John Â£>.
Spreckels' paper is formulated by the Demo
cratic boss of Oakland, Frank J. Moffltt.
Following the line of stupid logic ap
plied to Mr. Davis by Dr. Pardee. the
doctor has by his silence indorsed it. If
he rill refresh his memory he will re
member that the man whom he now ac
cuses of allowing others to think for him
wmtf for Dr. Pardee his notification to
the* Stare" tTTal'Ke" (Oft "doctor) was a can
didate for Governor. So well pleased was
Dr. Pardee with the little effort that he
pronounced it better than he could have
done for himself, and he was proud to
see it go forth in his name. And the fol
lowing evening it was copied into the
tor's organ verbatim. With the same
dissimulation entering into every detail
of the doctor's campaign is it any wonder
that the rest of the State refers to Ala
meda's Punch and Judy show.
Even the people in this county are now
to a large extent sharing the opinion of
the other counties. They realize that
they are being used in a game of bat
tledore and shuttlecock. A few months
ago the Enquirer was extolling Mr.
Davis to the skies and speaking of him
a? 'he one man who could lead the Re
publican hosts to victory. This kept up
for a time, and then Dr. Pardee came
along. He did something to that news
paper (he says he didn't buy it), and
from that time it has striven most lu
dicrously to convince the county that
the- diet* of cheese it gave them a short
time ago is not good for its political dl
gestion, and has striven to substitute
chalk. Now they would, very naturally,
like to know when another chef may be
expected with another bill of fare. 'Tis
funny, 'tis true, and 'tis true 'tis funny,
and perhaps after all it does appear to
an outsider something like a Punch and
Judy show.
It would peem also as if some of the
interior papers have caught the spirit
of the show, for Dr. Pardee publishes
this from the Eureka Standard:
Henry T. Gage, the Los Angeles lawyer. Its
being brought prominently forward by the
politicians from the south, while here It is
believed by many that the successful candl
. date will come from Alameda County, and that
Dr. Geonre C Parciee formerly Mayor of Oak
land, will be the lucky man.
Mr. Davis offsets this with a double
shot from the same paper as follows:
W. R. Davis is an able man, a clean, honest
and honorable man. The good things paid of
Mr. Davis by the Pasadena News are all true.
That the Eureka Standard now has
evidently "caught on" to the situation.
Dr. Pan! also claims that he is in
dorsed by the organ of the San Jose
"gang," but this occasions no surprise in
this county as there is much to suggest
that he has during the past few years
taken lessons in politics from Jim Rea. .
Of more Ir â tance just now than tran- :
sient politics is the question of the loca
tion of the fuse works that were blown to !
f. Ms last Tuesday. The explosion "was
a revelation to the people that lived in
the vicinity. They had not the slightest .
Jdea they were living in such close prox
imity to such a mighty engine of death
and the indignation meeting held last j
night was a very timely proceeding. If
the evidence of the officers of the works |
be true thai theVe was a much smaller j
amount of powder in the magazine at the
time of the accident than is usually on
band, there should not be any need of a j
!i to prevent the i
works being rebuilt in the same locality.
In other words, to rebuild at the scene of
last T explosion, is to wilfully ex
pose to tt anger of Instant death one j
hundred and sixty little children who at
tend the adjoining school.
most notable Incident of the catas
trophe, next to the death <if the victims,
attering ;md demolition of the
Melrose schoolhouse. It is almost be
yond belief that a powder magazine and
a public school should be neighbors In a
country as sparsely settled as Melrose.
Fortunately the explosion occurred be
fore school was open for the day and j
while the 160 little ones were in their
beds. Fortunately, also, there w;us a
"small" stock of powder on hand. There
is no guarantee that the Chinese em-
Hot again quarrel, or the
m;i(-azine be tired, and the natural infer*
rom this Is surely argument enough
to prevent the works being rebuilt on the
Old site. There is yet anothe r strong
point brought forward, and that is that
the development of the district must ,
naturally be retarded by the presence of ;
such a menace to life and property.
Not for some years have the different >
departments of the city government j
bi en running as smoothly and with so :
1 general satisfaction as at present.
Since the new heads of the Police and ;
Fire departments, the weekly squabbles I
that were brought before the Commis- :
eioners are missing, and apparently the
tt feeling prevails on all sides.
There is also a pood administration in the ,
Street Department, and If any change be j
contemplated for political reasons a loud
howl of opposition would be raised. It is
a good time to let well alone

the tracks when a friend who was with
him said: "Look out. there comes the
train." Mr. Innes wheeled quickly an.l
in doing so lost hi? balance and fell heav

SEWWG WOMEN ARE
ACTING IN HARMONY
â 
TRADEMARKS TO KNOCK OUT
CHINESE-MADE GOODS.
Another Enthusiastic Meeting at
Which the Purposes of the In
corporation Are Fully
Explained.
The -women interested in the Incorpora
tion of the Woman's Sewing Company
met in Pythian Castle yesterday after
noon and received a report of progress
from the directors. Mrs. M. E. Squire j
4ed, and pointed remarks were made j
by Mrs. Addle L. Ballou. W. W. Allen,
lira. Sehlessinger, Mrs. Naomi Anderson, j
George T. Boyd and others. The articles j
| of incorporation have been forwarded to j
i the Secreetary of State, and already nu- j
merous subscriptions for stock, of which;
shares will be Issued at $1 each, !
1 have ben received. The objects of the ,
incorporation are thus Bet forth:
To protect working women and enable j
; them to secure full value for their labor.
To contract for sewing of all kinds and
distribute the same to deserving women
at prices equal to the value of the work
: to be performed.
To furnish work to deserving women at :
i both factory and home, so the families
shall receive the benefits instead of en- |
riching contractors.
To establish, maintain and conduct a
1 factory and depot for supplying women
with sewing of all kinds, at all times, at
prices in proportion to their ability to
perform, and grade the same up to the ;
full value of the character of the labor
performed upon each class of work.
Manager W. W. Alien reported that a
suitable building had been secured, 30xS0
light and electric power
available, at the corner of Eighth and
Folsoin streets, which will be the depot of
supply. Those eligible to membership
â  company must be citizens of the
: States or become such; must be of
good moral character, competent to do
the work, and desist from politics in any
form. It is proposed to give to labor 70
per cent of the profits, retaining but SO
per cent for the running expenses. Man-
Allen believed that the company's
trademark would be almost sufficient to
Chinese work to be tabooed. All
getting work will be subjected to certain
rules, and any one may purchase stock, j
nd Japanese being excluded.
Mrs. Ballou spoke particularly of the i
benefits of organized labor, and said that
the needle will be the company's most
desperate weapon, the toneue being
curbed. She spoke of the patriotism of
women during the Civil War, and thc.r
characteristics of Independence, clever- i
ness, courage and virtue. She urged the j
sewing women to "put their shoulders to
the wheel, manfully, as it were."
Mrs. Knomi Anderson. a colored j
i woman, expressed her gratitude at being
classed with American women, and could
nee no reason for the foreign prefix in
"Afro- American."
Mr. Boyd called attention to a case '
where an unfortunate woman was of
fered $1 75 per dozen for making ladles'
wrappers, and this showed the great ne
â¢v of concerted action on the part of
the sewing women of this city.
Another meeting will be held shortly,
rlu^ notice of which will be given through ;
the papers.

i Captain Lorenson of the schooner Mari
etta, lying at the foot of Third street, re
ported at the Southern Police Station yes
terday that he had boon the victim of a
boy he had taken pity upon and given
shelter for the night.
"The boy came to me," said the cap
tain, "last night and told me that he was
destitute anu had no friends in the city,
lie said he had recently come from Chi
cago by the brake-beam route and begged
me to give him a bunk to sleep in.
"I took pity upon him and allowed him
to sleep in my cabin. This morning while
I was absent from the cabin the boy dis
appeared and I discovered that he had
tal:<n $21 which I had in my trousers'
pockets hanging up in the cabin. There
was $15 in gold and $6 in silver."
The captain described the boy as about
14 years of age, light complexion and hair
and wore a gray cap and coat, brown
apron overalls and a pair of shoes that
were too large for his feet. The police j
are hunting lor the boy. (

Captain Jones of the ship Burmah,

Intact. Fourteen days after he started
he had the misfortune to lose his fore top

tinued while the ship was off the River
Platte for about a fortnight, during which
time he lost a number of sails, a small
boat and numerous articles about the

NATIONAL GUARD
OF CALIFORNIA
SEEKING INFORMATION OF THE
STATE'S ARMED FORCE.
List of Those Who Have Been Adju
tant Generals of California,
Naval Militia.
Major General John H. Dickinson has
returned from his tour of observation In
the limits of the First Brigade and the
first thing he did upon his return, as a
means to the end of reorganizing the
armed force of the State, was the Issu
ance of a circular letter to all the com
panies in the State in which are embraced
the following questions which will serve
as the base for future operations in the
matter of putting the guard on a solid
footing once more.
What are the names of the members of the
company?
The rank of each.
What was the date of enlistment and date
of re-cnllstment?
Why are such members not In the service of
the United States?
If any member in physically disabled, what
Is the nature of the disability. If known?
What property has the company on hand?
Give the same in deta.i.
Who Is In command of the company?
If other than a commissioned officer, by
whose authority?
. Have the oaths of the enlisted men been for
warded?
What money Is due the company from the
State?
Can you recruit up to at least fifty men?
If so, how do you know?
Oive the indebtedness of the company In de
tail. What Is due the armorer? What Is due
for light for water and other indebtedness?
If these questions, simple and unmis
takable, are properly answered, there will
be no difficulty for the Board of Location
to arrive at the exact status of the guard
at this. time.
Until the answers are received nothing
will be done except to gather information
that will assist the board In placing tho
companies, that are to be reorganized, in
such parts of the State where they may
be most available. . "What the numerical
strength of the new guard is has not yet
been agreed upon, but If it Is to be one
half of what It was before the declaration
of war, there will be no difficulty in filling
the ranks, Judging from the number of
applications that have been filed by indi
viduals who have offered their services
to the State. It Is true, however, that
many of these offered themselves in an
ticipation that there might be a third call
and. their -purpose in tendering their ser
vices was to be able to go as a part of
the National Guard of the State, rather
than .as individuals who - might be as
signed to this, that or some other branch
of the service. i .
The return of the election held In Com
pany H of the Fifth Infantry, located at
Napa.has been received at Division Head
quarters. This shows that Captain Frank
W. Bush was re-elected, Harry L. Gunn
was re-elected first lieutenant and Gilbert
A. Wright was elected second lieutenant.
Major Margo of the Second Brigade staff
presided at the election.- -
The regimental armory of the First In
fantry Is located at the corner of Page
and Gough streets, but people who are
not aware of that fact are apt to be mis
led by the gilt letter sign which stands
out prominently over the entrance to the
large building pn'the south side of Market
street near Tenth. This sign which reads:
"First Regiment Infantry N. G. C," has
been there ever since the eight companies
of the First were transferred from that
building to the one at Page and Gough I
streets, where may now assemble those
members of the eight companies who did
not go' to" the front with Colonel J.F.
Smith and the rest of the fighting boys
from California. -
A correspondent has asked . who were

The parade reports of the Naval Militia
on the Fourth of July, which includes the
men on special duty, show an excess of
800. The parade in this city had in it
seventy-five men of the battalion located
here. This is looked upon as a very good
showing in view of the fact that quite a
number of the men have enlisted in other
branches of Uncle Sam's service.
A letter received from Lieutenant Tur
ner, commanding the Iroquois, formerly
the Fearless, announces that the vessel is
loading stores as rapidly as possible and
that she will soon be ready for sea. The
work on the other scouting tugs is not
being pushed as rapidly, but there is con
siderable work being done.
The men of the two divisions In this city
are being drilled weekly, and at this time
particular attention is being paid to in
fantry tactics with the view to utilize the
men for infantry, should there be a third
call for volunteers. The usual discipline
is maintained on the Marion, but not so
much attention as in the past is paid to
ship drill.
Swiss Rifle Club Celebration.
The annual picnic and outing of the
Swiss Rifle Club, which developed on
thla occasion Into a patriotic celebra
tion, was held yesterday at Fairfax. This
club Is one of the most select of the
Swiss organizations In existence In the
country and has had a life of thirty
seven years. Accbrdlngly the picnic was
private, about 150 members and invited
guests being present. The principal fea
ture of the day was a banquet in the
large pavilion. Orations were delivered
in English by A. Gehret, A. Borlini and
G. F. Cavalli; In German by L. Juri; in
Italian by Architect Tognazzinl, and in
French by C. Grandjean. They were all
patriotic In nature and numerous refer
ences were made to the American and
Swiss flags, intertwined above the speak
ers' stand.
In the afternoon a number of operatic
and patriotic songs of both coun
tries were sung by a chorus consisting of
Mr. Desmond (tenor), A. Borlini (bary
tone), A. Gehret (basso), Mrs. Christine
(soprano) and J. Baumgarten (tenor).
When the national hymns were sung hats
came off all around. Dancing followed
the exercises.

FACED DEATH
ON THE WAVE
Treasure-Seekers Have
Close Calls.
DETAILS OF TWO WRECKS
HOW THE EVANS AND BEACH
WERE LOST.
Ten Hours Consumed in Rescuing
the Passengers of One of the
Vessels After It Went
to Pieces.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
UNALASKA, Alaska, July 10.â The
steam schooner Noyo, under lease to
the Scandinavian Bank of Seattle, left
Seattle on June 21 at 6 p. m. for St.
Michael. The schooner had a deck
load of lumber for a 50 feet by 14 feet
by 3 feet stern wheeler; a 50-foot iron
boat, BO feet in length by 10 feet beam
and 3-foot hull; a steam launch 38 feet
by 10 feet by 6 feet, and lumber for a
schooner 40 feet by 12 feet by 2 1-2 feet,
besides X) lifeboats and canoes, 40 cases
coal oil, 2 barrels of oil and other
freight on a flimsy deck, hardly capable
of holding a few passengers. In the
hold was 300 tons, of freight. In her
small cabins were packed sixty-five
passengers, besides steerage and crew, i
In tow were two finely constructed j
river boats for the Yukon â the Alfred J. j
Evans, owned by Baltimore people, and i
the \V. J. Beach, owned by Chicago
people.
On the outward passage near Cape i
Flattery the 3-inch hawser between the j
Evans and Noyo parted and the Beach j
with a 3-inch hawser drifted into the
Evans, knocking her rudder off and
some of the decking. Just as the two
liver boats were drifting on the rocks
the Noyo caught them and started for
Port Angeles. At the latter place Cap
tain C. C. Hansen of the Noyo resigned
and took the train for his home in San
Francisco.
"I refused to take such boats to sea
and be responsible for the lives of i
those fools on the Evans and Beach," j
said Hansen
At this port The Call correspondent
was able to look over the Evans and ;
Beach. On the first were sixty-live
engers who had shipped as crew,
with about 350 tons of freight. On the
latter were twenty-seven passengers
who had shipped as crew, including five
women. No one on either boat had ;
ever been to sea before. Captain \V.
H. Edgett of Port Townsend took :
charge of the Noyo and after four days'
delay a second start was made. The '
tow line parted several times in smooth I
water and just what it would do at sea
no one could tell. At Dixon's Entrance
the gentle roll of the sea broke the hog i
chains of the Evans and she was soon
in a leaky condition and making a :
snake track over the waves. The flag
went up on the Evans with the Union
down, meaning "We wish to abandon
ship."
Finally the Evans and Beach were !
towed into an obscure port in Hawcan
harbor, Alaska, where she was left
with her sixty-five passengers. Just
how they will communicate with the
outside world none can tell unless some
boat happens in there. The captain of
the Noyo offered to take the Evans'
passengers, but just where they could |
be showed the captain did not inform
them, as the Noyo passengers j
are packed like sardines in a I
box and the food supply is so
unwholesome that those who are sea
pick and can't eat have a great advan
tage over those who are well. The lat
ter are all suffering with hunger or
dyspepsia. The Beach passengers set I
up a clamor to go ahead and the Noyo I
passengers joined in the general "kick"
to proceed, while the Evans people
"kicked" for time for repairs. Captain
ett was between the devil and the '
deep sea and he left port with the !
Beach in tow, the Evans people prom- i
Ising all kinds of revenge. Captain j
Lewis of the Evans says he will put ;
on his paddle wheel and beat the Noyo
to St Michael.
The ladies on the Evans remained
with their boat. The men had on their
Peattle togs for the Yukon and had the
appearance of a lot of museum freaks.
When about 300 miles out to sea, a
slight storm was encountered. The
Beach went to pieces on the morning
of July 4. and by the greatest kind of
luck the passengers were rescued from
the water. It took about ten hours to
do the rescue work, and as the Noyo
left the floating wreckage a lot of poor
dogs were pitting upon floating lumber,
barking to their owners to "come and
take us, too." The dogs were left to die
<>f thirst while the Noyo again turned
her head toward St. Michael.
Just about this time the thin upper
decking of the Noyo commenced work
ing and her passengers discovered that
the hatches were not closed and had
freight piled from top to bottom in the
hatch. With the deck house gone the
hold, would nil and the Noyo woiild join
the Beach at the bottom. The hungry,
the dyspeptics and the sick all joined,
and. working with might and main, got
the freight removed and the hatches
down about ?. a. m. on July 5. During
the panic much freight was thrown
overboard to lighten the overburdened
vessel and finally quiet was restored.
The negligence of the Seattle Collec
tor in clearing such a vessel is respon
sible for the trouble. Everybody on
board took the Noyo to be in good
shape simply because the Seandivanlan
Bank of Pent tie is running her.
Of the eighteen California passengers
aboard the Noyo. James McAnnlr.h of
Forest Hill proved himself the hero of
the hour in working to save the
Beach's passengers.

FRENCH THEORY FOR
BRITISH NAVAL ACTIVITY
Belief That Great Britain Fears
America's Growing Power More
Than Russia.
Special cable to ThÂ» Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted. 1893, by Jump* Gor
don n*>nnett
PARIS. July 24.â Mr. Goschen Intro- I
duced the supplementary naval budget In â¢
the House of Commons with the assur
ance that the step was not aggressive.
This statement has been ironically com- S
mented upon here. The papers regard
it as threatening. Le Journal dcs Debuts
Fays it is not possible to believe Russian ,
naval activity was the real reason for this
strengthening of the British marine.
Mr. Goschen, It adds, while ostensibly
looking toward the East was really in
thought regarding the West.
The Debats then builds up an elaborate !
theory to prove that England fears the
new born naval power across the Atlantic
and that she is anxious to be on the safe
side.
None of the papers seem to think Eng
land's naval activity is a good hint, yet
that It Is so is proved by the general way
the Idea of a conflict between France and
England Is poou-poohed. This might not
be tne case if they did not think England
was strong enough to hold her own.
Denis Guibert utters solemn warnings !
that France should be in a position to I
defend her colonies or terrltorv were
they threatened, presumably, by England
or America.
A. de Mangny in Gaulois takes Mr.
Gosehen to task for having introduced
Russia's name into nis remarks, while
approving the way in which he reduced to
proper proportions the fears excited in
certain parliamentary bosoms by rumored
visits of French warships to the Channel
Islands.
ARRIVES AT MADRID
TO LABOR FOR PEACE
Miss Jessie Schley Disobeys the
Command of Her Father, the
Admiral's Cousin.
MADRID (via Paris), July 24.â Miss
Jessie Schley, delegate from the Peace
Society of Paris, has arrived at Madrid
with the intention, it is asserted, of in
terviewing members of the Cabinet
with a "humanitarian object."
Miss Schley is the daughter of
Charles Schley of Milwaukee, who is a
cousin of Commodore Schley. She Is a
member of the Daughters of the Revo
lution. It was announced from Paris
last week that she was about to start
for Madrid to see the Queen Regent
and Senor Sagasta with a view of
bringiner about peace and then proceed
to Washington to visit President Mc-
Kinley in the same interest.
Last Friday the Milwaukee Sentinel
announced that Miss Schley's father,
i>n learning of his daughter's intention,
had instructed her to return home im
mediately, disapproving her course and
excusing it as the result of a warm,
sympathetic nature and a special en
thusiasm for philanthropic and peace
movements.

EMILE ZOLA HAS
NOT BEEN FOUND
But the Paris Newspapers Have Lo
cated Him at All Points of
the Compass.
Special cable to The fall and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted. IS9B, by James Gor
don Bennett.
PARIS, July 24.â M. Zola's flight has
given a note of gayety to the papers
here for the past few days. He would
possess the gift of Ã¼biquity Indeed were
he in all the plr.ces where his presence
is telegraphed to the French press. In
Ostend, Fale, Brussels, Geneva, every
where in fact, except France, is he re
ported to be staying. To-day the Etoile
Bays he has arrived at the Spa with
Mme. Zola and a lap dog. Here, how
ever. Just as In all other towns I have
just mentioned, I visited hotel after
hotel without finding a trace of the
novelist. The reason for this may be
found in a telegram from Antwerp to
the Libre Parole, which says that Zola
is leaving that port for Norway at 5
o'clock. Like every other dispatch on
the same subject, this is "riven as ab
solutely authentic. In the meantime
M. Zola has not yet been found, and
the crop of duels growing out of the
affair gives quite a cheerful idea of life
in this hot weather.

THE SAN" FBAXCISCO CALL., MONDAY, JULY 25, 1898.
BURNED ALMOST TO A CRISP.
MRS. KATE MCCARTHY, 28 Sheridan Street, Poured
Coal Oil Into Her Kitchen Stove, With Dis
astrous Results to Herself and Son,
The desire to quicken the fire in the kitchen stove nearly cost Mrs. Kate
McCarthy, 28 Sheridan street, her life yesterday morning. As it is she is
in a critical condition from burns on her body, arm? and face.
About 10 o'clock she prepared the fire to cook breakfast for herself and
two boys. She placed a piece of paper and some sticks of kindling wood in
the stove, and aa Bhe was in a hurry she took a can of kerosene oil,
which was about half full, and poured the oil on top of the wood. There
had evidently been some live embers from the previous night's fire, as a
bright flame shut up from the stove and the bottom of the can was
blown out, the burning oil being scattered over the unfortunate woman.
Frantic with pain, she endeavored with her hands to smother the
flames, and if it had not been for the presence of mind of her elder son
James, a boy of 17 years of age, she would have been burned alive. He
was reading a newspaper in the kitchen at the time, and without a
moment's hesitation rushed Into his bedroom and seizing the blankets from
the bed hastened back and wrapped them round his mother, extinguish
ing the flames.
The ambulance was summoned and Mrs. McCarthy was taken to the
Receiving Hospital. Dr. Wei! found that she was badly burned about the
chest, back, face, arms and hands. The skin of her hands pi fled off as if
the doctor had been taking off her gloves. She had fortunately kept her
eyes closed. Dr. Weil has hopes of her recovery.
The boy James walked to the hospital and had his hands attended to.
They were severely burned in his efforts to save his mother. Mrs. Mc-
Carthy's husband is employed in the gas works at Fifth and Howard
streets and was at work when the accident occurred.
Some one turned in a fire alarm from box 185, but the services of the fire
men were not required.
While the Fire Patrol on Eddy and Polk streets was going to the fire one
of the axles of the wagon broke at Mission and Tenth streets and the men
were thrown to the ground, but none of them were injured.
JAMES WREN
WAS MOBBED
BY BETTORS
Exciting Scenes at
Union Park.
FAVORITE'S CHANCES RUINED
THE "SLIPPER IS BLAMED BY
THE ANGRY SPECTATORS.
He Stumbled at a Critical Point *n
the Final Course as the
Dogs Were Bsing
Released.
Owing: to an unfortunate bungle in the
slipping of the last brace of dogs left to
run for the all-age stake at Union Cours
ing P.-;rk yesterday, the favorite. Vanity
Fair, was never in the running. The bet
tors, who were down heavily on Curtis &
Son's fawn greyhound, mobbed James
Wren, the slipper, as he left the field.
A murmur of disappointment ran
through the Mg crowd as the dogs left
the slips. They were released together,
but John Kerrigan's Lady Blanche had
opened a lead of some six lengths before
Vanity Fair seemed to got started. The
h;ire was not a strong one and the favor
ite had hardly got under way before the
n iiirsf- was over.
Instead of starting at once for the train,
as is th^lr custom, the crowd gathered at
the fence and awaited the return of tho
slipper from the field. As he approached
the inarticulate murmur of the mob grew
in Intensity. Men and women jostled one
another in an effort to gain a point of
vantage near the field. "Wren walked up
stolidly to face the trouble.
"Why didn't you hold her with a rope?"
was the first question fired at him by a
spectator.
This was the signal for a perfect tor
rent of abuse heaped upon the man who
was responsible for the bad slip. As he.
walked down to the exit from the field
the crowd followed him. One woman, in
a Frenzy of excitement, shouted, "Kill
him! the robber, the thief!" The cry of
"robber" was tak^n up by the men and
w:is mingled with hisses and groans. As
Wren left the field and reached the bet
ting ring the special police and his per
sonal friends surrounded him and pushed
| back the mob.
The women, more insistent than the
sterner sex, still kept un their cry of kill
! him. The progress of the crowd was fln
' ally stopped by the bar. Wren's friends
: bad succeeded in nuietlng the mob for the
time being and then gave three cheers
! for him. He was hurried to hi.Â« room,
and the angry bettors made their way
t" the train. They were in no amiable
frame of mind and a number of minor en
i counters ensued before the grounds were
cle:ir< '1.
According to Wren's explanation the
trouble was caused by an Inopportune ac
cident, liable to occur at any time. It
was one that would excite but little com
ment if it occurred in any except the final
rounds of the stake. When the hare was
the customary distance ahead of the dogs
I Wren started with them, both being
I sighted onAheir game. Wren hnd barely
left the beS>h. upon which he sits, when
he stumbled losing his balance and unin
tentionally unleashing the dogs. At the
moment Lady Blanche was in the proper
: position for starting and as quick as a
| flush bad settled down to her stride.
Not so with Vanity Fair, the favorite.
Her front legs were Inclined backward.
I and when the pressure of the slips was
i taken from her neck she stumbled. Before
I she could get going her opponent had
opened up a commanding lead. The hare
was not a strong one and Vanity Fair
was not fairly in the running before the
red flag went up, signaling the victory of
Lady Blanche.
Curtis & Sons, owners of Vanity Fair,
had more than their share of misfortune
during the day. Maud S, which was
played in the long odds book to win the
stake, was thrown out In the fourth
round. She wns drawn against Lady
Blanche the ultimate winner, and was
expected to score. The first hare up was
a poor one and Judge Bull signaled to
hold the dogs.
This was done and they were taken,
back for another trial. In their excite
ment to get away the dogs jumped about
and Maud 5 backed out of the slips. She
went after the hare and after a long
course killed. She was returned to the
slips at once and was badly beaten.
In the actual running the most sensa
tional course of the day was that be
tween Flying Buck and Lady Blanche in
th.' fifth round: Odds of sto 1 were
offered on The Buck. To the delight of
the bettors Lady Blanche scored every
point but one. The hare was a clinker,
leading the dogs across the field and
finally making its escape.
In the fifth round of the puppy stake
Golden Russet was drawn against Mac's
Melody, while Sunburst was to run a bye.
As Russet and Sunburst are owned by
K. V. Sullivan, he elected to run Sun
burst in the final, withdrawing Golden
Russet. Mac's Melody won. The results
of the day's sport follows:

AT INGLESIDE.
Short End Players Received
Occasional Comfort and
Much Coin
A packed grand stand and several hun
dred people in the adjacent grounds Baw
Mialmo go out and land the stake at in
grleside yesterday, it was a day Âr torrid
sport. Seventy-two doga were in the con
test at the outset. Of the number at hast
twenty were thought to oave a show at
the timil drip. The knowing onos played
Mialmo and Gladiator, the latter getting
rather the bulkier bank roll. Be waa in
vincible until he met his kennel mate
i Mialmo in the semi-final, and he then
went promptly to his kennel.
In the main the favorites proved
worthy their backing- throughout the day.
Still the short end players were not with-
OUI occasional comfort. Tom Bell started
it in the initial course by putting out the
6 to 2 favorite Rosalie. Masterpiece also
Jarred the "push" by defeating v.m
Needa. Lass o' Gowrle ran away from
ilobson In a working course, the latter
! selling favorite at 2 to 1. Some of Uie un
knowing ones made Old Glory favorite
over Crosspatch at 2 to l. Crosspatch
was the one dog in the course.
Mohawk beat the fleet Terrona, the .at
ter a 2 to 1 favorite and played as a stake
winner in the long odds book. Hot Stuff
beat the 5 to 4 favorite Myrtle; Mialmo
ran ring* around the G to 4 favorite Koo
lawn in a bye; Cladlatnr added to the
sorrows of 1 errona in a bye with Ter-
I rona, a "pipe" at 5 to 3; Crosspatch ad
i ministered another defeat to Koolawn
| in a bye, the latter the choice at 5 to 3.
Koo Lawn's work was most disappoint
| ing to her backers. She lost to Gladiator
In her first course through a short course
and a course that went no whit to her
discredit. But in the two byes which she
afterward ran it was seen that long or
short she was not in trim to win a course.
Mialmo's work was of the red letter
: order. For some time she has been in
poor condition, but she was not so yester
: Bay. She ran as she was wont to run last
fall, when she was given to landing al
most every stake in which she was en
tered.
The Eastern dog Hot Stuff put up work
consistent with his name. It was his best
performance since landing on the coast.
He put out everything with ease until he
met the stake winner Mialmo, and he
made a gallant fight to the end.
Terrona was deemed a good thing at the
outset on the grounds of speed. Terrona
was speedy, but Mohawk got in some of
his close work on the hare and Terrona
was a loser. Crosspatch, the runner up,
was a hard and consistent worker
throughout the day. In the final she was
on the short end at six and seven to one,
but odds were not warranted. She held
to Mlalmo throughout and the course was
at an end only when the kul was accom
plished.
The running in detail was as follows:
D. Flynn's Tom Kell beat C. Brown's Rosa

It was dreary occupation searching: for
pleasure at the park and cliff yesterday.
The sun was obscured a goodly portion
of the day by drifting fog banks ami the
trees and were glittering with the
precipitation. In consequence the usually
snug corners and recesses around the
band stand in the park and alonp the
cliff out by the sea were practically dc
i. At the Chutes there was a good
attendance.
The aquatic sports attracted a large
crowd to Sutro baths. The juvenile races
wpre very exciting, and A. Adams, a
now-comer, won in the remarkable time
of. 33 seconds, considering: that the young
ster i.s about 10 years old.
The following is a list of the winners:
50-yard juvenile dashâ A. Adams first, L.

75-yard Juvenile dashâ G. Stark first, K.
Adams second.

DESPERATE
CRIME OF
TWO MEN
They Assault and Rob
a Boy.
GAVE THEM A HARD BATTLE
B. HOLBROOK'S BOUGH EXPEBI
ENCE IN T&.ABJJX.
After Being Knocked Senseless With
the Butt of a Rifle His Teeth
Were Kicked Out.
R Holbrook, the son of the ex-secretary
of the Society for the Prevention of Cruel
ty to Children, was brutally assaulted by
two men while visiting Ipnucio. Marln
County, yesterday. The result was that
he was compelled to go to the Receiving
Hospital last night to have a deep gash
In his head dressed.
The unfortunate young man also had
three of his front teeth kicked out by his
biutal assailants.
Holbrook and a party of friends went to
Marin County, intending to spend the day
at Ignaclo. Durin- the afternoon Hol
brook and a young man named H. Jacob-
Bon. who lives at 2909 Harrison street,
strayed away from the party. They had
their puns with them, and seeing a flock
cf doves they proceeded to display their
marksmanship. Scarcely had they loaded
their weapons when two men who, Hoi
brook says, were Spaniards, accosted
them and placed them under arrest for
trespassing. When asked to show their
authority one of the men attempted to
take Holbrook's gun away from him.
The young man refused to give up the
â weapon when the alleged Spaniard tried
to w"rest it from him. In the struggle that
followed Holbrook was struck on the
head presumably with some blunt instru
ment, felling him to the ground. He
knew nothing more until about an hour
later when he regained consciousness. To
his surprise he found himself about a
half mile from the scene of the assault.
Hi., wasÂ» covered with blood that flowed
from the wound In his head. His mouth
was r.lso bruised and bleeding and three
of his teeth were gor.o.
The injured youth staggered back to
the camp. whÂ«rÂ» h<= hnd left his friends.
After hearing hi? ptory of the assault
they decided to bring him to this city for
medical treatment.
Holbrook Bays that one of his assail
ants carried a rifie in his hand, and he
thinks that he used it on his head. After
he had fnllen unconscious to the ground
the ruffians kicked him In the mouth,
knocking out his teeth. The desperadoes
then robbed him of his gun, but made
no attempt to take- his- valuables.
The police of this city have notified the
- of Marln County, and every
effort will he made to apprehend the
boy's assailants.
ROBBED AND THROWN
INTO A WATER TROUGH
PAINFUL EXPERIENCE OF |
RICHARD NEWMAN.
Aftermath of a Dance at B'nai B'rith
Hall Winch Turned Out a
Failure.
A club of which R. M. Silvey, a barber
at 12 Eiprhth street, is the president gave
a dance at B'nai B'rith Hall Saturday
night, but it turned out a fizzle, as only
a few couples marie their appearance.
ThÂ»n there was trouble, and the musicians
tnd doorkeepers demanded their money.
It looked serious for Silvey when Richard
Newman. who was Felling badges,
jumped in and took Silvey's part.
About a dozen of them left the hall to
gether and walked along Market street
to Eighth, where Silvey left them. The
others, including Newman, continued on
their way till they reached a saloon at
Ninth and Howard streets, where they
wont in and had some drinks.
Newman is a boy about 17 years of age
and is employed as a janitor at 1209
Market street. The dispute commenced
at the hall was renewed in the saloon and
they all turned their wrath upon New
man for hacking up Silvey. When they
got outside, about i o'clock in the morn-
Ins, eight of them surround'-'l Newman,
and after taking his gold watch and 50
cents from him threw him Into the water
trough in front of the saloon.
Newman's yells for help were heard by
Policeman Hemenez, and he fished him
out of the trough. The eight men ran
along Howard street and 'Judged Into a
saloon at Tenth street, making their exit
by the rear.
Hemenez took Newman to the Southern
station, whore he told his tale of woe to
Lieutenant Hanna. He presented a pit
iable object in his bedraggled clothes. Hn
gave a description of the men and the
police expect to have them behind the
bars soon.

MAJOR McLAUGHILN
SQUELCHES "JIM" REA
The San Jose Schemer Took the Chair
man's Declaration Personally and
Says It Was Spite.
The Major Replies That if the Shoe Fits Rae He Can
Wear It, and That He Is Not Looking for
Officeâ The Slogan of the Party.
It is my desire that we get close to the hearts of the peo
ple, and I hope and trust that you will by your action here
to-day evidence the fact that the Republican party is the
party of the people, and that I represent its true sentiments
in my declaration against boss rule, corruption in every
form and the insidious inroads of the corporations upon the
rights of the people.
The spirit of the foregoing extract from the gTeat speech of Major
Frank McLaughlin before the Republican State Central Committee on
Saturday was the main topic of conversation among politicians yester
day. Among the great bulk of the people, too. It was evident that
Major McLaughlln had struck a. responsive chord.
"The Republican party is the party of the people," was a sentiment
that found ready echo wherever citizens most do congregate. It was
particularly noted as having been expressed In connection with a de
fense of the liberties of the people and as a rebuke to bossism. When
"Jim" Rea of Santa Clara County t ried to Introduce a motion muzzling

That "The Republican Partu Is the Partu of
the People."
the voters and suppressing free primaries it seemed peculiarly appro
priate that the Republican spokesman should protest. Major Mc-
Laughlin did protest, and so effectively that the delegates were electri
fied and cheered his manly stand to the echo.
"I have been congratulated upon the stand I took In my address to
the members of the Republican State Central Committee," said Major
McLaughlin at Santa Cruz yesterday. He went there during the
morning. "Assurances have been given me that it means thousands of
votes to the Republican party, for which we are all striving so hard.
Sheriff Jones of Colusa, chairman of the Republican committee of that
county, affirmed that my watch-cry of the coming campaign means an
addition of 5000 votes to the cause.
"I am firmly convinced that our party as a whole in this State is more
free from boss cule and outside influence than any other party. We
must eliminate from it every vestige of such influence and prove "by our
actions and by the selection of o U r various candidates that they are,
in fact, of and for the people. I reiterate my statement made before
the convention that if we are guided and actuated by these glorious
principles our victory in November will be a sweeping and a decisive
one. It will establish more firmly than ever the proud position where
she really belongsâ in the front rank of the Republican party."
In an interview "Jim" Rea at San Jose yesterday affirmed that Ma
jor McLaughlin was actuated by personal feeling in his address. He
charges the Chairman of the Republican State Central Committee with
having been a candidate for the United States Senatorship and for
which he desired his (Rea's) support. Rea refused it and claims that
is the basis of the presc-nt charges against him. He also alleges that
Major McLaughlin is not a politician, not knowing the first rudiments
of the game of diplomacy and laughing at his pretensions as manager of
the great party.
When these matters were called to the attention of Major M->-
Laughlin he said he never desired to occupy his present position as
Chairman of the State Centra! Committee. All the members ar^ aware
of this fact and that he has endeavored to get others to relieve him of
its responsibilities. What he said to the committee on Saturday was in
tended to apply to all bossed. If the shoe fits Rea he is welcome to wear
It is hardly necessary to say that the rank and file of the Republi
can party when the attitudes of tho two men are understood will be
with the Chairman of the State Central Committee rather thpn with the
political schemer of San Jose, and furthermore, "that Major McLaughlln's
stirring declaration will doubtless become the slogan of the party in this
campaign.
CADETS RETURN
FROM CAMP.
The First Regiment League of the Cross
Cadets Arrive in the City After an
Enjoyable Week at Santa Rosa.
Thr- First Regiment League of the Cross
Cadets, under the command of Colonel
W. P. Sullivan Jr., arrived in San Fran
cisco yesterday afternoon from Santa
Rosa, where the week's annual encamp
ment was held this year. The cadets were
all in perfect health and reported having
a most enjoyable time. Colonel Sullivan
slated last evening that tno encampment
was a great success; that the boys had
behaved wonderfully well and that the
regiment had made a very favorable im
pression on the Santa Rosa residents.
Yesterday was the last day In camp for
the boys and on account of it being Sun
day drills were dispensed with. There wa3
a military mass at 9 a. m. celebrated by
Rev. Father Cassln in camp, which was
largely attended by the residents of Santa
Rosa. Father Oussin at the commence
ment of the service statea to the boys
that the mass would be offerod up on be
half of the soldiers in Manila ana also in
behalf of the cadets present at mass. At
the close of the reading of the gospel of
the day the reverend father made the
boys a short address, congratulating them
on their good behavior and their strict
attention to discipline during the encamp
ment. On the arrival of the regiment in
the city this evening it marched up Mar
ket street to its armory, where it was dis
missed.

said it was absolutery essential to the

STRUCK A BUMPER
Three Persons Injured in a McAllis
ter-Street Car Accident.
Car 257 of the McAllister-street Hne
crashed into the bumper at Larkin street
last night, slightly injuring three of the
passengers. They are Miss Sarah Woolev
of 2118 Golden Gate avenue, left shoul<i<>r
injured; Miss Ethel Hern, 1922 Golden
Gate avenue, cut over right eye, and J.
Kaufman, 927 Sutter street, abrasion of
cheek and sprain of right thumb. The
car was crowded at the time, and when
the crash came considerable excitement
ensued.
Miss Woolev. who is an elderly woman
was thrown from her seat and it was at
first feared that she was seriously in
jured. Kaufman was sitting inside the
car, and the force of the collision hurled
him against the front window, breaking it
and cutting" his face. Miss Horn was In
jured by a piece of flying glass. The in
iured people were at once removed to the
Receiving Hospital, where their wounda
were dressed.
On account of the accident traffic on the

THE GREATEST
GOLD REGION
EVER FOUND
Capitalist C. H. Vines So Says
of the New Klondike
Country.
Impressions of an Investor â His Estimate of
This Season's Output About Twelve
Million Dollars.
"To say that I am greatly pleased with
the far north gold country would be ex
pressing my opinion too mildly, for I am
profoundly impressed with the belief that
it is the greatest gold region the world
has ever known. Its richness and possi
bilities of development are beyond con
ception."
The foregoing were the remarks of C.
H. Vines at the Palace yesterday. Mr.
Vines is the attorney for and a member
of a wealthy New York syndicate which
owns a number of the richest claims in
the Klondike and has just returned from
a trip made for the purpose of investigat
ing the properties and their titles. As his
views are from the unbiased standpoint
of a capitalist and not of an excitable
gold-seeker his opinions are of particular
interest and value.
"I had exceptional opportunities to ob
tain certain inside information, particu
larly from the Canadian officials,"' con
tinued Mr. Vines. "For instance, the
Gold Commissioner informed me that he
had on hand $3,00-0,000 in gold dust collec
ted thus far In royalties. At the same
time he said that sum was misleading as
a basis for estimating the output. It was
the opinion of the commissioner that fully
three-fourths of the gold washed out this
season had not been reported and never
would be, as it was Impossible for the au
thorities to keep posted as to the actual
product of the many mines, and they are
largely dependent upon the honesty of the
miners.
"At the herdquparters of the Alaska
Commercial Company I was informed
that they had $4,000,000 in dust, but no
iflfa a.'; to how much more would come in.
They wore alto of the opinion that the
outside world was woefully Ignorant of
the mighty gqld-prod.fecing resources of
the country.
"Tho North American Transportation,
Company was not so communicative. T
had on:;siii,-ral>lp gpl4 dust I desired them
to take care of, but they refused abso
to handle it. They said they had

tool chests full and the available space in
their storeroom was occupied with baps

While I was in their office a man came in
â¢who had born notified by the company to
call and take away a big bag of the stuff
as they would no longer be responsible for
it. All this dust loft on storage with them
was at owner's risk. I should say this
company had several millions on hand.
"As to the real output this season the j
estimates vary greatly, running from |
!t7,000,QC0 to t2a!000.0OO. Probably tii>,ooo,ooo j
to $12,000,000 Will be close to the mark.
However, the great amount sequestered
by miners will BOt be heard of from that

"WHY SPAIN CAN'T WIN."
Rev. Locke Reviews Spain's Cruel
and Tyrannical Rule.
Standing room only was the condition
of the Central Methodist Church on Ml -
Blon street last night. The Rev. C. B.
Lock* discoursed on the war and the â 
reasons "Why Spain can't win." He pre
face his remarks by saying that he made i
no attack on any one denomination, but ,
as history is history it must be repeated
as found, because it is truth.
Starting with the Inquisition in 1481,
which lasted for three centuries, .he
showed that during that time 32,0! XÂ» hu
man beings had been slaughtered by the
Spanish Government because they har
bored independent and conscientious opin
ions differing from those of the Spanish
church: From the reign of Philip II
down to the present day the history of
Spain is one of continuous cruelty. Out
Of a population of 17.000,000 only 4,000,000
can read and write, and the balance are
very little better than slaves. The his
tory of Spain since the dawn of enlight
enment in the middle ages has been as it
was in the days of the, Inquisition, one
of cruelty and tyranny.
When Admiral Cervera was about to
sail for the West Indies he assembled
his crows and told them that Spain of
to-day was the Spain of all times.- In thia I
the "admiral was correct, as Spain has
I never changed and never will until the |
suit of wealth. They say they can't af-
I ford to pay men $15 per day for pick and
shovel work and then give the Canadian
Government one-fifth of the gross yield,
and they are doubtless right.
"What greatly Impressed me is ths
wealth and extent of the bench claims.
As an instance I saw a claim on the ninth
tier in French Gulch which appeared to
be 1000 feet above the creek bed which
' was turning out $1000 per day. What ex
tent of territory this class of pround cov
ers, no man knows and the development
of the diggings will probably occupy
years. As to quartz ledges, after care
ful investigation I am strongly inclined to
the belief that they no longer exist in
that region.
"As to the future possibilitfes I would
say that they are apparently immense.
Anywhere along the Yukon for a distance
of 300 or 400 miles there is a moraine de
posit, the river now flowing in some
places 1000 feet below the old bed. The
reasonable conclusion Is that thia pre
historic river bed must be fabulously rich
in gold as a result of centuries of glacial
action. Of course this proposition Is
based on the now generally accepted .the
ory that the wealth of the Klondike is
due to such an agency.
"Those who have gone to the Yukon or
other rivers expecting to successfully
dredge the river bed for gold will be dis
appointed. The presence of Immense
quantities of detritus In all the large
streams will make such work impossible.
Incidentally If 1 wore going to prospect
for quartz I would go to the North Pacific
coast. There are several thousand miles
of coast line that bear every evidence of
being rich in gold-bearing quartz, and I
believe it Is only a question of a short
time when its existence there will be
proved.
"I crossed the Chllkoot Pass twice and
put in two months at Lake Bennett wait
ing for the ice to go out. I have not seen
I much summer this year. On the 7th of
July we crossed lak^s in which the ice
! waa thick enough to bear up pack horses
nnd the snow iv some places was from
forty to fifty fe.et 'deep. I was the first
; man to secure passage on the initial
Fteamjfr from Dawson up the Yukon.
With improved service this will become
i the favorite route. By going to the Sound
by rail a man can now make the trip to
Dawson by this route in about twelve
days with some degree of comfort, pro
vided there are no unusual delays. There
are now about five miles of the railroad
completed and the company has a force
of ;>OO men at work. I'pon its completion
with the present steamer service on the
lakes and clown the Yukon, the trip will
be comparatively easy.
"The White Horse Rapids constitute a
terrible stretch of water, as is slightly in- I
dicated.by a snapshot kodak picture Ii
took of a French-Canadian batteau mak-
Ing the shoot through the most dangerous !
part. Tho day I was there five men were
drowned and the Ftrange fact in connec

instance where a boat goes down in the
center of the rapids nothing is ever again
seen of man, boat or outfit. Fortunately
accidents are not numerous. The channel
is only about 200 feet wide and is supposed
to be equally deep.
''Truly it is a wonderful country- Not
withstanding the hard trip I have been
greatly benefited in health and I regard
the reeults of my experience as invalu

tured -was taken from thp Bible and was
purely doctrinal. Its purpose was to
draw an object lesson from the sacred
words of the Scriptures for adaptation
to Christian life of the present genera

liberal applause by the congregation was

TWO VERY REMARKABLE
RIFLE SCORES MADE
PRIZE SHOTS HIT AN EQUAL
DISTANCE FROM CENTER.
It Would Not Happen Again in a
Thousand Contests â New Stars
Appear in the Columbia
Club.
It was a pood day for rifle-shooting at
the Shell Mound range yesterday, and the
attendance was above the average, for
all that many of the shooters are now
out in the country chasing the elusive
deer.
In the San Francisco Schuetzen \e
rein's monthly bullseye contest J.
Buettler carried off the first money with
'32 points or degrees as shown by the
measuring machine. This was remark
able, for in the Germania Schuetzen
Club's monthly bullseye match J. Gefken
made the same score, 232, also carrying
off the first money. When it is remem
bered that the machine on which the
shots are measured performs its work to
I the thousandth part of an inch it is read
ily seen lhat two such scores are not
I likely to be made once in a million times.
D W- McLaughlin made his appear
i ancfl on the range after attending the big
National Bundfest that recently took
place at Glendale, L. L. and he was kept
busy telling his friends how the best
marksmen of the United States compare
with those of the Pacific Coast. Judging
from the fact that Mac carried off some
of the nrst prizes it is safe to infer that
the marksmen of other places are not so
very much ahead of those who stand at
the head in rifle matters out W est.
On tie 2nO-yard rifle range of the Co
lumbia Pistol and Rifle Club A. B. Dor
rell stood high man for the day with -IS
points Columbia target count, and J. P.
Co "grave was high on the 00-yard range
